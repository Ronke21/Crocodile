<text>Crusaders Football Club is a semi-professional Northern Irish football club playing in the NIFL Premiership. The club, founded in 1898, is based in north Belfast and plays its home matches at Seaview.

Crusaders originally played as a junior level team until 1931. They then played intermediate level football until 1949, and during that time they were one of the top non-senior teams in the country, winning the Irish Intermediate League nine times and the Steel &amp; Sons Cup on seven occasions. After the withdrawal of Belfast Celtic, Crusaders were elected to the top level in their place, in time for the start of the 1949–50 season. Since then, the club has won 32 senior trophies; seven league titles, six Irish Cups, two League Cups, eight County Antrim Shields, one Setanta Sports Cup, two Charity Shields, two Gold Cups, three Ulster Cups and one Carlsberg Cup.

The club&#x27;s traditional kit colours are red and black, and the current manager is former player Stephen Baxter, who is now the club&#x27;s longest serving manager, having been appointed in 2005. The club&#x27;s closest rivals are Cliftonville, with whom they contest the North Belfast derby. Rivalries also exist with other Belfast sides such as Linfield and Glentoran.

==History==
===Junior years (1898–1921)===
Crusaders Football Club was formed in the year 1898, although the exact date is unknown. The first meeting of the club is believed to have been held at 182 North Queen Street, Belfast, the home of Thomas Palmer who, along with James McEldowney, John Hume and Thomas Wade, was a member of the original club committee.

Various names were suggested for the club, including &#x27;Rowan Star&#x27;, &#x27;Cultra United&#x27;, &#x27;Mervue Wanderers&#x27;, &#x27;Moyola&#x27; (all names of local streets), and others such as &#x27;Queen&#x27;s Rovers&#x27;, and the &#x27;Lilliputians&#x27;. Thomas Palmer felt a name of more international significance should be adopted and he suggested &quot;Crusaders&quot;, after the medieval Christian knights. The team is informally known as the Crues.

Initially, the club was only able to undertake friendly fixtures until it was formally admitted to one of the local junior leagues. Players were compelled to pay a match fee of two pence before they could take the field; a strict &quot;no pay, no play&quot; club policy was enforced. The very first competitive game of which there is any existing written record was on 10 December 1898. It came in the North Belfast Alliance against opponents named Bedford at Alexandra Park and the report states that, &quot;after a splendid game Crusaders won by 5 to 2.&quot;

Crusaders went on to compete in the Dunville Alliance, Ormeau Junior Alliance, Alexandra Alliance, Woodvale Alliance and Irish Football Alliance (the latter of which they won three years in a row from 1916 to 1918) until their election to the Irish Intermediate League in 1921.

===Intermediate years (1921–1949)===
Crusaders rapidly became one of the top intermediate sides in the country, and won an impressive collection of trophies, including the Intermediate League championship six times in ten years from 1923 to 1933. In addition, the side were very successful in the top junior cup competition, the Steel &amp; Sons Cup, winning the competition on seven occasions as a junior side (the first team would win the same cup again many years later in 2005, after relegation to intermediate football).

The side also reached the Irish Cup semi finals three times in the 1920s. The first came in the 1923–24 season, where they were defeated by that season&#x27;s Irish League champions Queen&#x27;s Island in a replay at Pirrie Park. In the 1924–25 season the Crues knocked out senior sides Larne and Belfast Celtic before being halted by Glentoran at The Oval in the semi-finals (who also went on to be champions that year). They reached the semi-finals once again in 1927, losing 2–4 at home to derby rivals Cliftonville. The Crues also reached the final of the Belfast Charities Cup in 1923 (losing to Glentoran), also an impressive achievement as the competition was open to all senior clubs in Belfast and the surrounding area.

Despite these feats, repeated applications for entry to the senior Irish League were turned down. The frustration at the club was such that serious consideration was given to making membership applications either to the Scottish Football League or to the League of Ireland. However, the Second World War intervened and no football at all was played by the Crues between April 1941 and September 1945. Crusaders began competing once more in the Intermediate League after the war, beginning with the 1945–46 season.

===Early Irish League years (1949–1960)===
Crusaders won the 1948–49 Intermediate League with a record number of points, and coupled with the vacancy created by the dramatic withdrawal of Belfast Celtic from the senior ranks in 1949, Crusaders were finally elected to the senior Irish League in time for the start of the 1949–50 season. Their first competitive game as a senior club was on 20 August 1949 and resulted in a 1–0 City Cup win at Portadown – ex-Belfast Celtic striker Vincent Morrison, signed during that summer, had the honour of scoring the club&#x27;s first ever goal as a senior club. Morrison was the club&#x27;s top scorer of their first senior season with 11 goals in all competitions. The Crues&#x27; first league match took place on 26 November, a 1–4 defeat to Linfield at Windsor Park, and their first victory came on 10 December away to Ballymena United by 3–1, but the side would have to wait until 1 April 1950 for the first league win at Seaview, with a 4–1 victory over Glenavon. The season was tough going for the &#x27;Hatchetmen&#x27;, as they were also known, and they had to apply for re-election after finishing in 11th place out of 12 clubs.

As has always been the case, however, Crusaders never lacked determination. On 17 May 1952 they participated in their first senior final, the Festival of Britain Cup final, which they lost 0–3 to Ballymena United. Under the player-managership of Jackie Vernon they recovered to win their first senior trophy in the 1953–54 season by defeating Linfield 2–1 in the final of the Ulster Cup. The 1950s were not easy in spite of the presence in the side of some excellent individuals and the end of the 1957–58 season saw another application for re-election. The decade also saw the emergence of Curry Mulholland, who represented the club from 1951 until 1960, setting a goalscoring record of 149 which would not be beaten until the 1990s.

===Irish Cup wins and European forays (1960–1970)===
The 1960s brought much more success. On 17 May 1960 they won the County Antrim Shield for the first time, repeating the feat in 1965 with a 6–0 victory over Larne (this was the joint-biggest margin of victory in the final of the competition until Linfields 9–1 victory over Bangor in 1973). With Jimmy Murdough as coach they also picked up another Ulster Cup final win on 1 October 1963, with a reply victory of 1–0 over Glenavon. These successes were overshadowed by two unexpected victories in the Irish Cup finals of 1967 and 1968 against the might of Glentoran and Linfield respectively. This led to Crusaders&#x27; first sojourn into European competition, against Valencia CF in August 1967. Also in 1968, they narrowly missed out on winning the Blaxnit Cup and becoming champions of all of Ireland, losing 3–4 on aggregate to Shamrock Rovers. The 1960s also saw the emergence of some of the greatest players in Crusaders&#x27; history, such as Albert Campbell, (who was the club&#x27;s most capped international player until surpassed by Colin Coates), Danny Trainor, Joe Meldrum, Walter McFarland and Danny Hale, who scored an incredible 143 goals in just four seasons, including a club record of 55 goals in the 1965–66 season, which still stands to this day.

===Billy Johnston era (1971–1979)===
Jimmy Todd had won the second of those Irish Cups with the side in 1968, however by the early 1970s the Crues had declined slightly as the side of the 1960s broke up. Todd was replaced with Billy Johnston in early 1971, and he set about restructuring the squad. Under Johnston unprecedented success was to follow, with the Irish League championship trophy finding a home at Seaview in 1972–73, with the attacking duo of Tommy Finney and Jackie Fullerton scoring 47 goals between them. The club also set a record of going through the whole league campaign unbeaten at home, a feat which was repeated 40 years later in the 2012–13 season. This led to the club&#x27;s first ever participation in the European Cup, in which they faced Dinamo Bucharest and had the misfortune of setting the record for a defeat in that competition, losing 0–11 in the away leg on 3 October 1973.

In the 1975–76 season the Crues won the league for the second time, largely aided by the goalscoring of Ronnie McAteer who scored 20 league goals in 22 games. Sandwiched in between these successes was a County Antrim Shield and Carlsberg Cup success in 1973–74.

The second championship triumph resulted in the never-to-be-forgotten European Cup-tie with Liverpool which saw the brave Cruemen fall to the might of Kevin Keegan and John Toshack among others at Anfield by just 0–2 through a Phil Neal penalty and a Toshack strike. The home leg which followed was played before a crowd hanging from the rafters that would undoubtedly give the current health and safety legislators a heart attack. The Crues put up a dogged performance – Keegan scored in the 34th minute, and the Crues battled until the final ten minutes, when Liverpool&#x27;s superior fitness told with four goals coming in the final ten minutes through David Johnson (2), Terry McDermott, and Steve Heighway.

However the 1970s also saw The Troubles begin to affect Irish League football, with two incidents in particular affecting the football club. On 21 August 1979 there were more than 1,900 police officers on duty for a match between Crusaders and Cliftonville, more than has ever been recorded at a football match in the United Kingdom. Another black day shadowed the club on 12 January 1980, when RUC constable David Purse was shot dead by an IRA gunman during a match with Portadown – the only murder at a football ground during the Troubles.

===The Eighties (1980–1989)===
Johnston had left the club in 1977, and after a two-year spell of management by ex-player Norman Pavis, Ian Russell took charge of the club in 1979. While there was great promise shown initially during Russell&#x27;s spell, with the club reaching both the County Antrim Shield and Irish Cup final in 1980, they did not build on this and Russell left in 1983.

Although performances on the pitch in the 1980s were steady, they certainly were not spectacular and the club paid the penalty for not building on earlier successes. Tommy Jackson took over in 1983, and led the Crues to their sole cup triumph during the decade, with the club winning the Gold Cup for the first time in the 1985–86 season.

Jackson left in 1986 and new manager Jackie Hutton had no money with which to buy players but he did the club a great service when he somehow completed the deal which brought Roy Walker, initially as a player, to Seaview in 1988.

===Roy Walker era (1989–1998)===
Hutton was quick to recognise the leadership qualities in Walker and saw him as his potential successor. Walker took over as player-manager in September 1989, two years after his arrival as a player. One of his first tasks was to apply for re-election as the Crues finished 13th out of 14 clubs. Notable players to begin their association with the club during this era were the likes of Sid Burrows, Glenn Hunter and Kirk Hunter.

At the same time, local businessman Harry Corry, pumped some desperately needed sponsorship money into the club. As the revival began, southern businessman Tony O&#x27;Connell also became involved.

Walker&#x27;s sides – he dubbed them &quot;the team with no boots&quot; – went on to win nearly everything in sight whilst wealthier and bigger-supported clubs could only watch and wonder. There were two further championship titles won (1995 and 1997) whilst Crusaders also finished runners-up in 1993 (losing the title on goal difference) and 1996. Other trophies won were the County Antrim Shield (1992), Ulster Cup (1993) and Gold Cup (1996).

In turn, this meant more expeditions into Europe as the Crues took on teams from Switzerland, Denmark, Lithuania and Georgia within a five-year span. The team of the 1990s is regarded as one of the best in the history of the club, with a large part of the success revolving around the core of Kevin McKeown, Glenn Dunlop, Martin Murray, Sid Burrows, and the attacking duo of Glenn Hunter (who would go on to set a club goalscoring record of 157 goals) and Stephen Baxter.

The team was affectionately known as the &quot;God Squad&quot;, due to the large number of Christians in the playing squad and staff. In addition to the first team and the reserves, teams at under-16 and under-18 level were introduced for the first time as the club looked to nurture and develop local talent in the area. Roy Walker suddenly resigned as manager in May 1998, just prior to the club&#x27;s centenary dinner celebrations at Belfast City Hall. He was the longest-serving manager in the club&#x27;s history until surpassed by Stephen Baxter in October 2013.

===Gradual decline (1998–2005)===
Subsequently, a lack of funds saw the Seaview fortunes decline as the decade came to a close, with Dublin-based player-managers Aaron Callaghan and Martin Murray both resigning after one year apiece in charge. Callaghan managed to lead the club to third place in his sole season in charge, but it would be many years before the Crues would challenge at such a high level again. Former player Gary McCartney took over the managerial reins in July 2000. The team narrowly retained Premier Division status after a nail-biting play-off success over Lisburn Distillery thanks to a hat-trick from veteran Stephen Baxter in May 2001 but McCartney resigned just over twelve months later because of the limited budget at his disposal.

Popular veteran defender Alan Dornan was appointed as McCartney&#x27;s successor at the end of June 2002 and the side retained Premier Division status that season under his guidance, although the squad was very inexperienced and often included six or seven teenagers. The emphasis on youth continued in 2003–04 as the Crues achieved a mid-table finish, an improvement compared to preceding seasons.

Dornan&#x27;s next season in charge was not as successful. He was sacked just after midway through the season, as the Crues lay at the bottom of the table, despite having guided the team to the County Antrim Shield final, which they lost to Linfield. Dornan was the first ever Crusaders manager to be sacked. Former striker and fans&#x27; favourite Stephen Baxter was appointed as manager but despite an improvement in results, he could not keep the club in the Premier League, with the Crues losing out to Glenavon in a relegation play-off, the first ever Premier League team to lose to a First Division side in the play-offs. The relegation was the first time Crusaders had ever been relegated from any league, and meant an end to 56 consecutive seasons of senior football.

===Stephen Baxter era (2005–2024)===
They immediately bounced back the following year under Baxter by winning the IFA Intermediate League, the Intermediate League Cup, and Steel &amp; Sons Cup. After their first season back in the top flight after promotion, the Hatchetmen finished in a creditable 6th place, after briefly topping the table at the beginning of the season.
In the 2007–08 season, the Crues finished in 7th position in the League after a somewhat inconsistent start to the season. They appeared in two finals, losing both the County Antrim Shield 1–2 to Glentoran, and the Irish League Cup, 2–3 to Linfield.

During 2008–09 season, they finished in the top three of the League for the first time in 10 years. The club also won their first Irish Cup final since 1968, thanks to a Mark Dickson goal, in a 1–0 victory over Cliftonville at Windsor Park on 9 May 2009. The same season, Crusaders began a partnership with fellow North Belfast club Newington in a cross-community initiative, which saw Newington play their home matches at Seaview. This became their permanent venue for home matches in 2011.

As a result, Crusaders entered Europe for the first time in 12 years and faced Macedonian side FK Rabotnički in the Europa League second qualifying round. The game was drawn 1–1 with David Rainey scoring on the 89th minute. On 23 July 2009 in their second leg encounter with FK Rabotnicki in Macedonia they lost the game 4–2 and exited the competition 5–3 on aggregate.

In a move endorsed by UEFA President Michel Platini, the club changed from a grass pitch to a 4G-synthetic pitch. The artificial football turf pitch was manufactured by Act Global. They played their first game on the new pitch against Glentoran on 14 November 2009. This move has turned out to be fruitful for the club, with matches at Seaview being the only games in Northern Ireland to survive the weather over the Christmas period. The same season the side won their second major trophy in a year, picking up the County Antrim Shield after a 3–2 extra time victory over Linfield.

In the 2010–11 season Crusaders challenged Linfield for the league title, after being 13 points behind at one stage. They ended up as runners up. The Crues also reached final of the Irish Cup where they played Linfield at Windsor Park. Crusaders went 1–0 up through Declan Caddell, but goals from Peter Thompson and Mark McAllister condemned the Crues to defeat.

The Crues then entered the 2011–12 UEFA Europa League and received their biggest draw since the famous game against Liverpool 35 years before, as the side drew Premier League team Fulham in the second qualifying round. In the home tie the side put up a brave fight, with new signing Timmy Adamson scoring an equalising goal and striking the bar with the score poised at 1–1, before eventually succumbing 1–3. In the second leg, the Premier League side proved too strong for the Hatchetmen, as they dominated the game and won 4–0.

At the same time, Seaview underwent extensive renovation, with two new stands and new seating installed, making the ground all-seater and one of the most modern sports stadiums in Northern Ireland. That same season they won the Irish League Cup, defeating Coleraine 1–0 at the Ballymena Showgrounds thanks to a Chris Morrow strike. Crusaders also became champions of Ireland for the first time, after defeating Derry City in the 2012 Setanta Cup Final 5–4 in a penalty shootout after a 2–2 draw after extra time. Captain Colin Coates scored both goals during the match, with Coates, Chris Morrow, Matthew Snoddy, Stuart Dallas and Gareth McKeown successfully converting their penalties.

Crusaders played Cliftonville on 26 January 2013 in the Irish League Cup final at Windsor Park losing 0–4 – a joint-record defeat in the competition&#x27;s final. The following season, the same two teams reached the final, playing out a drab 0–0 draw at Solitude, with Cliftonville retaining the trophy by winning 3–2 on penalties.

The 2014–15 season was a groundbreaking one for Crusaders. The season started with the side earning their first win in European competition for 18 years, defeating FK Ekranas of Lithuania in the UEFA Europa League 3–1 at home. In the return leg, Crusaders earned their first ever away victory in Europe, winning 2–1 thanks to two goals from Paul Heatley, and earning their first aggregate victory in Europe. In the second qualifying round, Crusaders bowed out against Swedish side IF Brommapojkarna after a 1–4 aggregate defeat. In cup competition, Crusaders reached the quarter-final of the Northern Ireland Football League Cup and the semi-final of the County Antrim Shield, losing both ties to Bangor, and the semi-final of the Irish Cup, losing out to Glentoran. Despite this, the side saved their best performances for the league, going unbeaten from December to April and winning 12 of 13 games. A 1–0 derby victory away to Cliftonville thanks to a Paul Heatley goal all but sealed the title, with a 2–0 home win the following week against Glentoran with goals from Declan Caddell and yet another from Heatley confirming the Gibson Cup&#x27;s place at Seaview.

In the 2015–16 season, Crusaders retained the league title for the first time in their history, after a 3–1 victory over Cliftonville at Solitude on 19 April 2016. In the following season they narrowly missed out on winning the Gibson Cup for the 3rd time in a row, finishing 2nd to Linfield after a dramatic dip in Crusaders&#x27; form late in the season, with a 1–0 defeat to David Healy&#x27;s side at Windsor Park on 8 April 2017 proving to be the match that decided the league title. The 2016–17 season was the first since 2013–14 that Crusaders failed to win any silverware.

However, the Hatchetmen bounced back in the 2017–18 season, regaining the Gibson Cup in a title race that went to the final day of the season. In the end, it was a 2–1 victory at the Ballymena Showgrounds on 28 April 2018 that brought the league title back to Seaview for the 3rd time in 4 years, thanks to goals from Philip Lowry and David Cushley, after Cathair Friel opened the scoring for Ballymena United and threatened to send the title to eventual runners-up Coleraine. Crusaders also won the County Antrim Shield at the Ballymena Showgrounds after a 4–2 victory over Ballymena United on 23 January 2018. Crusaders finished the season having scored an incredible 106 league goals, with over half of this tally coming from the attacking trio of Paul Heatley, Gavin Whyte and Jordan Owens.

In the first qualifying round of the 2018–19 Champions League, Crusaders received their biggest European draw since facing Fulham 7 years earlier, being drawn against European group stage regulars and Bulgarian champions Ludogorets Razgrad. However, the tie turned out to be no contest as the Crues were thrashed 7–0 at the Ludogorets Arena, with goals from Marcelinho, Claudiu Keșerü and a 7-minute hat-trick from substitute Jakub Swierczok. The return leg at Seaview then ended 2–0 to the Bulgarian visitors, thanks to a strike from Swierczok and an own goal from left-back Rodney Brown. After an uneventful league campaign, the Crues completed a cup double by winning the County Antrim Shield with a 4–3 victory over Linfield, and the Irish Cup with a 3–0 victory over Ballinamallard United.

In the 2019–20 UEFA Europa League, Crusaders beat B36 Tórshavn 5–2 on aggregate to reach the second qualifying round, where they faced English Premier League side Wolverhampton Wanderers. In the first leg at Molineux the Crues lost 2–0, before losing 4–1 at Seaview in the second leg.

In March 2022 Crusaders members voted 236–36 at an EGM in favour of accepting investment by the IRAMA company, who were seeking to buy a majority stake in the club. This deal later fell through over tax issues. In May 2022, the club reached the final of the 2021–22 Irish Cup. Trailing 1-0 for most of the match, Josh Robinson equalised in the last minute of the game to force extra time, and with penalty kicks approaching at the end of extra time, substitute Johnny McMurray scored the winning goal with virtually the last kick of the game to seal an extraordinary victory. In May 2023, Crusaders won the Irish cup for a second time in a row, once again beating Ballymena United, this time 4–0.

During the 2023–24 season, Baxter announced he would be stepping down as manager of the club, after 19 seasons in charge, at the end of the campaign. In Baxter&#x27;s last domestic match, Crusaders defeated Coleraine 3–2 in the UEFA Conference League playoff final, to qualify for continental competition for the 12th time in 13 seasons.

===Declan Caddell (2024–)===
Former player and head of Crusaders academy Declan Caddell was announced as Baxter&#x27;s successor in March 2024, and is due to take charge for the 2024–25 season.

==Stadium==

The team played at a variety of venues before settling at Seaview in 1921, which is still their home to this day. Earlier home venues included the Glen (which later became part of Alexandra Park), Simpson&#x27;s Boiler Fields on the Cavehill Road, the Shore Road (opposite the Grove Leisure Centre) and Rokeby Park. Seaview was officially opened on 3 September 1921 by William Grant MP, prior to kick-off in a 3–1 Intermediate League fixture victory against Cliftonville Olympic.

In July 1966 the original social club, dressing rooms and administration areas were destroyed by fire. They were replaced in 1970 by the present bigger and better facilities. Lisburn Distillery (known as Distillery prior to 1999) shared Seaview with Crusaders from 1971 until 1979, after their original Grosvenor Park home was destroyed in an arson attack. Since 1972, Seaview has been the venue for the Steel &amp; Sons Cup Final, which is traditionally held on Christmas Day (unless the game falls on a Sunday). Only two finals have not been played at Seaview since then, the 1975 final and the 1984 final replay (both of which were played at Solitude).

In 2009, Crusaders became the first team in the Irish League to install a 4G artificial pitch, endorsed by UEFA. The move has ensured that postponements due to bad weather have not affected Seaview as much as some other grounds. Other clubs have since followed suit, with Cliftonville installing a 3G artificial pitch the following year and Bangor in 2013.

In 2010, after European funding was declined, funding was secured from a private investor for the club to move to a new stadium in the Duncrue area of Belfast, near the docks (about 3/4 miles from Seaview) within &quot;5 or 6 years&quot;. However, with a stadium move subsequently shelved, the club submitted plans to redevelop the current stadium, and had planning permission approved in 2015.

==Support==
Crusaders has traditionally drawn its support from the people of north Belfast, Newtownabbey, and the south and east of County Antrim. From these members it elects its committee and its particular ethos, with a strong emphasis on community relations. An example of this is their local connection with Seaview Primary School, who have a long-established connection with the club through fundraisers and charity events, as well as school fetes.

However, the club&#x27;s serious financial plight became very apparent in the early 2000s and in 2002 consideration was given to changing the structure from one of a membership-based organisation to that of a public limited company. Members voted at the AGM against such a change in May 2002. In 2009, club members voted to become a company limited by guarantee.

Crusaders attract a loyal support and had the fourth-highest average attendance in Northern Ireland for the 2014–15 season, with an average of 1,275. In the 2015–16 season, their average attendance was the second-highest in the league after Linfield.

===Average attendance===
===Rivalry===

Crusaders biggest rivals are Cliftonville, with whom they contest the North Belfast derby. Crusaders traditionally dominated the rivalry (not failing to score in home league matches against the Reds from 1949 until 1998) mainly due to Cliftonville&#x27;s amateur status; since the mid-1970s the derby has been much more competitive. Crusaders have won 153 games to Cliftonville&#x27;s 85, and since competing at the same level have won 28 senior honours to Cliftonville&#x27;s 19. The sides have contested four cup finals together, with Cliftonville winning the 1979 County Antrim Shield final, the 2013 and 2014 League Cup finals, and Crusaders winning the 2009 Irish Cup final.

Historically, Crusaders shared a rivalry with Brantwood (who play in Skegoneill Avenue about 500 yards away from Seaview) when both sides were junior teams. With Crusaders&#x27; election to the Irish League in 1949, the intense rivalry gradually faded away. Crusaders also share city rivalries with other Belfast clubs Linfield and Glentoran.

<text>Candelaria (Candelaria / Palacio Legislativo in some of the Line 4 signage) is a Mexico City Metro rail station. It is located in Venustiano Carranza municipality east of downtown Mexico City. It lies along Lines 1 and 4. From July 2022 to October 2023, the Line 1 station was closed due to modernization works on the tunnel and the line&#x27;s technical equipment.
==Name and iconography==
The station logo depicts a swimming duck. Its name and logo come from the surrounding neighbourhood of La Candelaria de los Patos (the Spanish word &quot;pato&quot; means &quot;duck&quot;) where, only a few decades ago, many duck species lived and were bred and sold in a local market.

==General information==
Metro Candelaria has a subsidiary name, Metro Palacio Legislativo (&quot;Legislative Palace&quot;), because of its proximity to the Palacio Legislativo de San Lázaro used by the Chamber of Deputies &quot;(Cámara de diputados)&quot;, the lower house of the Mexican Congress.

Candelaria is a transfer station, with Line 1 running underground and Line 4 on an elevated surface viaduct. The station features an in-corridor cultural display. The Line 1 platform for the station was opened on 5 September 1969, and the Line 4 platform was opened on 29 August 1981. Service from Candeleria to Santa Anita started on 25 May 1982.

This station has the only &quot;Lost and Found&quot; office in the entire Metro system. It displays the architecture of Félix Candela, who designed the Candelaria station and many buildings in Mexico, such as the San Lázaro metro station and the Palacio de los Deportes, which served as a venue during the 1968 Summer Olympics.

<text>Dungannon Swifts Football Club is a Northern Irish semi-professional football club playing in the NIFL Premiership. The club, founded in 1949, has risen from the Mid-Ulster league to the top tier in Northern Ireland since its election to the Irish League First Division in 1997. Dungannon earned promotion from Irish League First Division to the Premier Division in the 2002–03 season.

The Swifts hail from Dungannon, County Tyrone and plays their home matches at Stangmore Park. Club colours are royal blue with white trim (home strip) and yellow with a blue trim (away strip).

Dungannon have been known for their youth development, with many players such as Niall McGinn and Terry Devlin going onto have successful careers in the professional game.
==Club history==

===Club formation===
The history of Dungannon Swifts Football Club began in 1949 with the formation of the club. The names of the founder committee members include Thomas Neill, Jimmy Sands, Maurice Graham, Alfred Burnett, Albert Kelly, George Richards, Albert Watt, Joe Meldrum Snr., Jack Fowler, John Martin and Ben Clarke.

===The early years===
In the 1949–50 season, the Swifts won the Mid Ulster Shield on their first attempt. The Swifts defeated Portadown Juniors 3–0 at Shamrock Park. The goalscorers were Johnson (1) and Neill (2). The remainder of the side included Blair, Carson, Pierson, Lynn, Gallery, Rice, Farrell and Henry. Seven of which were local players.

The club also entered the Irish Junior Cup, at the 2nd Round stage. However, a disjointed display; a man short for part of the game, from the newly formed side resulted in a 3–1 loss to Armagh Whites, in a match held at Beechvalley Park, Dungannon. With a first half equalizer scored by S. Stewart.

The following season, the Swifts made their entry into the Mid Ulster League. In the same season they made it through to the Alexander Cup, Foster Cup and Mid Ulster Shield where they landed runners up in each.

A league title followed in the 1951–52 season; a season in which they also finished runners-up in the Irish Junior cup – after a replay. And a league and shield double in 1955–56.

The Club also spent a number of Seasons in the Irish Junior Alliance League from the late Fifties until the league folded in the early sixties, which resulted in a return to the Mid Ulster League.

Admission into the Alliance was ratified in an I.F.A. meeting held on 26 July 1957. (It was hoped that by entering this higher grade of football; with teams being classified at Intermediate level, that it would eventually lead to entry into Irish League football.) The Swifts then began to assemble a team that would be able to compete in the Alliance League, for the forthcoming season (1957–58). A 2nd XI was formed, which entered into the Mid-Ulster League.

During the 1969–70 season the swifts won the Mid Ulster League without being defeated. The team only lost twice in total during the entire season including the Mid Ulster Shield final, when they were missing key players through injury. They also amassed a total of 158 goals for and only 29 against. The top scorer being Godfrey Clarke with 37; 12 other players had reached double figures.

===Promotion to B Division===
After twenty years in the Mid Ulster League, in 1972 the Swifts were promoted to the Irish League B Division where they managed a comfortable 4th spot in their first season.

===Stangmore Park===
1975 saw Stangmore Park become the official home of the Dungannon Swifts Football Club when they bought the land from Courtaulds Ltd and erected a temporary wooden Social Club.
The stadium holds around 3,000 people

===Continued success===
In the 1980–81 season the team had one of their most successful years ever and were crowned runners up in the B Division championship. The Swifts continued to show their dominance in the Bob Radcliffe Cup over the years but the 1987–88 season showed their skills in the senior Mid-Ulster Cup when they defeated Glenavon 2–1 to bring the trophy to Stangmore Park.

In August 1982, Dungannon Swifts officially unveiled their brand new club house. The purpose-built construction replaced the old wooden club house and would provide an ideal environment for club and social affairs such as bingo, dances and dinners.

===Senior status===
In 1997, Dungannon Swifts achieved senior status on its election to the Irish League First Division.

===Promotion to Irish Premier League===
The Club reached the top tier of Northern Irish Football; for the first time in their history, after being crowned champions of Division 1 in the 2002–03 season. This earned them promotion to the newly formed and extended 16 team Irish Premier League. Also manager Joe McAree was presented the First Division Manager of the Year award. The season is also notable for the 12–1 home victory against Carrick Rangers on 21 December 2002. This was the biggest post-war victory in the Irish League and the highest number of goals in the local game for over a century.

The club finished a respectable 10th position in their first season.

===Gary Bownes===
The 26-year-old former Ballinamallard United striker died during the 2005 close season. He had been the clubs’ top goalscorer during his debut season; with 15 goals, earning the club their highest Premier League finish. He was also the Swifts first winner of the Harp player of the month award in March 2005.

An annual pre-season Memorial Cup match between the Swifts and Ballinamallard was held up until 2015; in his memory, raising money for charity.

===Setanta Cup===
Dungannon Swifts qualified for the 2006 Setanta Sports Cup by finishing 4th in the Irish Premier League during the 2004/05 season. This success also earned Joe McAree the Manager of the year award. In the competition, Dungannon were drawn in a group with Cork City, Drogheda United and Portadown and failed to qualify for the semi-finals as Cork and Drogheda grabbed the top two places. Drogheda United would later win the tournament, beating Cork City in the final.

The club also qualified for the 2007 Setanta Sports Cup. However, they failed to progress to the semi-finals from their group, despite being undefeated in their home games.

Their most recent appearance was in the 2008 Setanta Sports Cup. However a disappointing campaign ended with only one draw, drawing a blank in four consecutive games, behind eventual winners Cork City, holders Drogheda United and Cliftonville.

===Intertoto Cup===
The club qualified for its first European games by finishing 4th in the Irish Premier League during the 2005–06 season. They played Icelandic club Knattspyrnudeild Keflavík in the first round of the 2006 UEFA Intertoto Cup. However, they lost 4–1; with the away goal scored by Swifts stalwart Johnny Montgomery, in Iceland and could not make up the deficit in the home game; drawing 0–0 at Mournview Park in Lurgan, leading to elimination at the very first stage of the tournament.

=== Irish Cup Final 2007 ===
The Club; managed at the time by Harry Fay, reached their first Irish Cup final in the 2006–07 season. They played league Champions Linfield at Windsor Park on 5 May 2007. Linfield took an early lead, before an equaliser by Rory Hamill. Linfield again took the lead through Glenn Ferguson, but the Swifts equalised shortly afterward through a Rodney McAree free kick. The game was level 2–2 at the break. No further goals were scored in the second half, taking the game into extra time. Despite Linfield dominance in extra time they failed to break the deadlock taking the Irish Cup final into penalties, for the first time. Both teams failed to score from their first two spot kicks. Linfield then converted their next three, with replies from Montgomery and McAree to make the score 3–2. The decisive kick was saved by the Linfield keeper from McAllister, to secure Linfield a successive League and Cup double.

===UEFA Cup===
Despite their Cup final Defeat, the club qualified for the 2007–08 UEFA Cup as Irish Cup runners-up. They faced Lithuanian A Lyga runners up FK Sūduva Marijampolė in the first qualifying round. The 1st Leg was played on 19 July 2007 at Windsor Park, Belfast. A first half goal by Mark McAllister gave the Swifts a 1–0 advantage going into the away leg. The 2nd Leg was played on 2 August 2007, at the Sūduva Stadium in Lithuania. Suduva drew level on aggregate in the first half. And despite having a man sent off with the tie level, a second half hat-trick by Andrius Urbsys meant the Lithuanian side won 4–0 on the night and 4–1 on aggregate.

===League Cup victory===
In the 2017/18 season the club recorded its first ever senior major trophy win, defeating Ballymena United 3–1 in the final of the BetMcLean League Cup at Windsor Park, Belfast.

<text>Code 46 is a 2003 British film directed by Michael Winterbottom, written by Frank Cottrell Boyce, and starring Tim Robbins and Samantha Morton. Produced by BBC Films and Revolution Films, the film is a dystopian sci-fi love story, exploring the implications of current trends in biotechnology.

The soundtrack was composed by David Holmes and Stephen Hilton under the name &quot;Free Association&quot;. Filmed on location in Shanghai, Dubai and Rajasthan, with interiors done onstage in London, the mesh of foreign locations was chosen due to the juxtaposition of elements in these cities offering a believable futuristic setting.

==Plot==
In the year 2077, the world is divided between those who live &quot;inside&quot;, in high-density cities, and the underclass who live &quot;outside&quot; in massive concentration camps. Access to the cities is highly restricted and regulated through the use of Bio-Passports, known as &quot;papeles&quot; in the global pidgin language of the day.

William Geld, an insurance fraud investigator from the NUSA (New United States of America, the successor state to the US following a second civil war), is sent to Shanghai in the Chinese Federation, an authoritarian state which occupies all of east Asia, to interview employees at a company known as &quot;The Sphinx&quot;, which manufactures the papeles. William&#x27;s assignment is to identify employees who are suspected of forging &quot;covers&quot;. After interviewing numerous Sphinx employees, he identifies a young worker named Maria Gonzalez as the forger. William is captivated by her, and instead of turning her over to security, he identifies another employee as the forger. William then meets up with Maria and they begin an affair. As Maria sleeps, William finds a forged cover in her room and takes it.

William is reprimanded for not discovering the true Sphinx forger. He requests that someone else be sent, as there may have been an accomplice to the innocent man he fingered. However, he is ordered to deal with the problem and to return to Shanghai.

Upon his return, William discovers that Maria&#x27;s apartment is abandoned and the only clue is a medical clinic appointment. He visits the clinic and learns that Maria was pregnant and that the pregnancy was terminated due to a violation of U.N. Code 46. William knows that this means Maria is somehow genetically related to him, but he has no idea how.

William discovers that Maria has been taken by the Genetic Police to have her memory of the episode erased. He gets the clinic to release Maria into his care by telling them she is a witness in his fraud investigation. After she is released, William tells her about the memory erasure and about how he didn&#x27;t report her for fraud. Maria is disturbed by this information and becomes very distressed. William gives her a sleeping pill and, while she is sleeping, he cuts some hair from her head and takes it to a facility providing instant DNA analysis. He discovers that Maria is a biological clone of his mother. William decides to go home to his family, but is not allowed to do so, as his 24-hour cover has expired.

William then realises that his only hope of returning home is to get a papel from Maria. She goes to work to obtain a papel, but is unable to forge one herself, as she was moved to another area of work, so a co-worker makes the cover for her. While taking a train to meet William, her memory returns and she recalls her feelings for William. He decides not to leave her.

William and Maria then travel to Jebel Ali in the UAE, which does not require special travel clearance. The two hide out in the old city where they book a room. William reveals to Maria that, in addition to the memory wiping, she has been &quot;Bio-Conditioned&quot; so that she suffers extreme fear in response to physical contact with the person who brought about the Code 46 violation. He refrains from telling her the Bio-Conditioning will also force her to report the further Code 46 violation to the authorities. They rent an old car and travel away to escape the authorities who are tracking them through their implanted Bio-Passports. William crashes the car while avoiding a collision with camels and pedestrians and they are both knocked unconscious.

William awakes in the hospital in Seattle, NUSA, with his wife and child. He has no memory of Maria or the Code 46 violation, as all memories of her and their time together have been replaced with memories of a successful investigation. Maria is more severely punished by being exiled &quot;outside,&quot; to the desert, and stripped of human status, legally making her a wild animal. Her memories are altered to make her believe that she is a murderer, as she is forced to live in slavery in the radioactive wastelands for the rest of her life.

<text>The Methylocystaceae are a family of bacteria that are capable of obtaining carbon and energy from methane. Such bacteria are called methanotrophs, and in particular the Methylocystaceae comprise the type II methanotrophs, which are structurally and biochemically distinct from the Methylococcaceae or type I methanotrophs.

In this family methane is oxidized to form formaldehyde, which is assimilated by the serine pathway. This involves combining formaldehyde and glycine to form serine, which may be converted into glyceraldehyde and thus into other organic molecules. They can also fix nitrogen, like many other members of the order Hyphomicrobiales. The cells contained paired internal membranes which are arranged towards their periphery.

<doc id="1343221" wikidata="Q7491256" url="?curid=1343221" title="Shawinigan Handshake">
<text>Shawinigan Handshake is the epithet given to a chokehold executed on February 15, 1996, by Jean Chrétien, then-Prime Minister of Canada, on anti-poverty protester Bill Clennett. The phrase comes from Chrétien&#x27;s birthplace of Shawinigan, Quebec, as he often styled himself the &quot;little guy from Shawinigan&quot;.

== Background ==
On November 5, 1995, André Dallaire broke into the prime minister&#x27;s residence at 24 Sussex Drive. He was armed with a large hunting knife and had intended to kill Chrétien. Dallaire was arrested before he could injure any person, but Chrétien remained tense about the possibility of another attempt.

==The incident==

On the day of the incident, Chrétien was in Hull, Quebec to commemorate the first National Flag of Canada Day. As Chrétien addressed the assembled crowd, anti-poverty activists heckled the Prime Minister over proposed changes to Canada&#x27;s unemployment insurance program, and, as he made his way to his limousine at the cessation of the ceremonies, Chrétien was confronted by Clennett. At that moment, Chrétien grabbed Clennett by the back of the neck and chin, forcing Clennett to the ground and breaking one of his teeth. Another protester who then blocked Chrétien&#x27;s passage had his megaphone knocked away by the Prime Minister, and was promptly pushed to the ground by Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) officers.

Chrétien later defended these actions, stating: &quot;some people came my way... and I had to go, so if you&#x27;re in my way...&quot;
He also blamed the RCMP for allowing Clennett to obtain such close proximity to the Prime Minister, though the RCMP said they saw no breach of security. Chrétien also demonstrated a casual attitude towards the affair, later joking that he had used the Shawinigan Handshake because he mistook Clennett for John Nunziata, whom Chrétien had dismissed from the Liberal caucus for voting against the 1996 budget.

Reform Party Member of Parliament Deborah Grey subsequently nicknamed Chrétien &quot;The Shawinigan Strangler&quot;. This sobriquet was later used by other opposition MPs as well; in a member&#x27;s statement on February 12, 1997, Chuck Strahl sarcastically nominated Chrétien for a &quot;Parliamentary Oscar&quot; for his &quot;performance&quot; in &quot;The Shawinigan Strangler&quot;.

While Clennett did not press charges against the Prime Minister, another person, Kenneth Russell, did accuse Chrétien of assault on March 28, and the Prime Minister was formally charged by a judge in the Quebec Superior Court. These charges, however, were rejected by the Attorney General of Quebec.

== Aftermath and legacy ==
In his 2007 autobiography, Chrétien described his reaction to Clennett&#x27;s approach as stemming in part from the trauma of the assassination attempt: &quot;my reaction was instinctive and probably angrier than it would have been otherwise&quot;.

Bill Clennett has since run for provincial office, standing as a Québec solidaire candidate in Hull in Quebec&#x27;s 2007 and 2008 provincial elections, ranking third in 2008 after the Liberal Party of Quebec and the Parti Québécois. 
Poet Stuart Ross arranged the text of Chrétien&#x27;s comments on the incident into the form of a poem, &quot;Minor Altercation&quot;, published the day after the event. It has since been often reprinted, both in its original leaflet form as well as in books, newspapers and magazines.

The epithet and incident remain enduring popular local lore in Shawinigan, decades after the incident.

Following the incident, popular Canadian TV sports personality Don Cherry commented that he liked politicians being direct in this manner, and the performance of Chrétien in particular.

Shawinigan microbrewery Trou du Diable has released an award-winning beer named &quot;Shawinigan Handshake&quot; with Prime Minister Jean Chrétien strangling Cherry on its label, in honour of the local lore.

Since the incident, many celebrities and politicians have been jokingly held by Chrétien in the famous chokehold, when visiting him in Shawinigan. These include Cherry, politician Michael Ignatieff, comedian Rick Mercer, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

The incident was referenced in a 2021 Beaverton article, which (humorously) claimed that Chrétien, then age 87, had been hired as Justin Trudeau&#x27;s bodyguard. In addition to supposedly putting a protester into the famous chokehold, he was also described as carrying a riot baton, crushing a rock into dust, and threatening to attack a protester &quot;like I did with Justice Gomery&quot;.

<doc id="1343230" wikidata="Q2898551" url="?curid=1343230" title="Telshe Yeshiva">
<text>Telshe Yeshiva (; ; also spelled &quot;Telz&quot;) is a yeshiva in Wickliffe, Ohio, formerly located in Telšiai, Lithuania. During World War II the yeshiva began relocating to Wickliffe, Ohio, in the United States and is now known as the Rabbinical College of Telshe, commonly referred to as &quot;Telz Yeshiva&quot;, or &quot;Telz&quot; for short.

It is a Haredi (ultra-orthodox) institution of Torah study, with additional branches in Chicago and in New York. It is the successor of the New Haven Yeshiva of Cleveland.

==History==

The yeshiva was founded in 1875 in the town of Telshi (, , ) in Kovno Governorate of the Russian Empire. By 1900 it was &quot;one of the three largest yeshivot in Imperial Russia.&quot;

The yeshiva was established by three Orthodox rabbis and Talmudists:
* Meir Atlas, later the rabbi of Shavli) and the father-in-law of Elchonon Wasserman and Chaim Ozer Grodzensky; 
* Zvi Yaakov Oppenheim, who later became the rabbi of Kelm; and 
* Shlomo Zalman Abel, the brother-in-law of Shimon Shkop.

===Rabbi Eliezer Gordon===

In 1883, Eliezer Gordon was appointed as the chief rabbi of the town of Telz and in 1884, rosh yeshiva (dean) of the yeshiva. A student of Yisrael Salanter, he had been a &quot;maggid shiur&quot; (lecturer) in Salanter&#x27;s yeshiva, and a rabbi in Kelm, with a short stint in Slabodka (a suburb of Kaunas/Kovno). The yeshiva eventually became one of the largest in Imperial Russia. Gordon added his son-in-law, Yosef Leib Bloch, to the faculty, and in 1885, he hired Shimon Shkop.

In 1894, the yeshiva moved from its Telz community-provided building into a new facility. That year, it added a new subject of study, &quot;mussar&quot; (Jewish ethics). Ben Zion Kranitz was hired for a new faculty position: &quot;mussar mashgiach&quot; (teacher of ethics). In 1897 Gordon hired Leib Chasman, who instituted a very strict &quot;mussar&quot; regime in the yeshiva which many students opposed.

In 1902, Shkop left to become the rabbi of Breinsk, Lithuania. In 1905 Chaim Rabinowitz joined the yeshiva.

In 1910, while fundraising for the yeshiva in London, Gordon died of a heart attack.

===Rabbi Yosef Leib Bloch===
Gordon&#x27;s son-in-law Yosef Leib Bloch became the community&#x27;s rabbi and the rosh yeshiva. In 1920, he established primary schools in Telz for boys and girls, and also added a &quot;mechina&quot; (&quot;preparatory school&quot;) to the yeshiva.

Parallel to an easier version of the yeshiva curriculum, the &quot;mechina&quot; also featured secular studies, another innovation at the time. In 1924 the Lithuanian government announced its decision to accredit only those rabbinical colleges that possessed a secular studies department. The Rabbinical College of Telshe was the only such institute, although secular studies were only in its &quot;mechina&quot;.

A kollel (postgraduate institute) opened in 1922, to train graduates for the rabbinate. Bloch&#x27;s son-in-law Chaim Mordechai Katz was dean (&quot;rosh hakollel&quot;).

====Yavneh School====
In 1918, a teachers training institute was opened in Kovno but did not achieve much success. In 1925 The Yavneh School for the Training of Teachers reopened in Telz under the auspices of The Rabbinical College of Telshe. This served as a postgraduate institute, with the charter of producing teachers for Jewish schools. The curriculum at the teacher&#x27;s institute included educational skills, Hebrew Bible, Talmud, the Hebrew language and literature and mathematics.

For many years the Jewish community in Lithuania had lacked a structured educational system for teenage girls. In 1927 a high school department for girls was established in Telshe.

In 1930, a sister institute to The Yavneh Teacher&#x27;s Training Institute was opened by Joseph Leib Bloch of Telz. The school offered a two-year course to young women.

These various schools were all incorporated as a part of The Rabbinical College of Telshe.

In October 1930 Yosef Leib Bloch died and his second oldest son, Avraham Yitzchak Bloch succeeded him as both community rabbi and rosh yeshiva.

===Rabbi Avraham Yitzchak Bloch===

In the 1930s older students in the yeshiva were selected to teach for periods of time at new schools in small towns where there had previously been little or no structured schooling, and then return to continue their studies at the yeshiva.

Rabinowitz died in the year 1931 which was the year Yosef Leib Bloch and his son Azriel Rabinowitz, was appointed as a &quot;rosh yeshiva&quot;.

In 1933, the yeshiva built a new building to house the &quot;mechina&quot; (&quot;preparatory school&quot;).

==The Holocaust==
In the fall of 1939, the Russians were allowed to bring troops into Lithuania on the pretext of defending the country. In June 1940, the Russians seized control of the country and quickly transformed it into a &quot;soviet socialist republic.&quot; As part of this transformation, private Jewish organizations and schools were disbanded and the yeshiva was closed. Most of the students dispersed, with only about a hundred students remaining in Telshe. The learning was done in groups of 20-25 students, studying in various batai medrashim (&quot;small synagogues&quot;) led by the &quot;rosh yeshivas&quot;.

During the early years of World War II, Elya Meir Bloch and Chaim Mordechai Katz were in the United States on a fund-raising mission. As the war broke out, their only option to ensure the continuity of the Yeshiva was to rebuild Yeshiva on American soil. This Yeshiva was thus rebuilt in Cleveland Ohio.

In October 1940, a group of students led by Chaim Stein escaped via Russia. This group found its way to the United States in early 1941 and joined the Yeshiva in Cleveland.

==Telshe in the United States==
The yeshiva was opened in Cleveland in the house of Yitzchak &amp; Sarah Feigenbaum on November 10, 1941. As of 1954, it became officially titled the Rabbinical College of Telshe. They relocated to the present Wickliffe location in 1957.

Telshe consists of a high school, college and post-graduate school. The yeshiva is a non-profit and is accredited through the Association of Advanced Rabbinical and Talmudic Schools. The yeshiva has a department of secular studies that grants a high school diploma.

In the United States the original faculty included Elya Meir Bloch, Chaim Mordechai Katz, Boruch Sorotzkin, Mordechai Gifter, and Chaim Stein.

The 2013 student count of 130 included 80 in grades 9-12; the highest student count, in 1966, was about 425.

==Notable alumni==
Among the well-known alumni of the yeshiva are:
* Chaim Yitzchak Hacohen Bloch, Chief rabbi of Bausk and Plunge
* Noson Ordman, Rosh Yeshiva Etz Chaim Yeshiva (London)
* Naftoli Carlebach, Orthodox Jewish rabbi and accountant
* Nachum Zev Dessler, Cleveland, Ohio
* Azriel Goldfein, founding Rosh Yeshiva of Yeshivah Gedolah of Johannesburg
* Chaim Gutnick, Melbourne Australia
* Chaim Dov Keller, Chicago, Illinois. Rosh Yeshiva of Telshe Chicago
* Zev Leff, Moshav Mattityahu, Israel
* Moshe Leib Rabinovich
* Avraham Tanzer, Rosh Yeshiva at Yeshiva College of South Africa

==Branches==
* Telshe Chicago. In 1960, the yeshiva opened a branch in Chicago, Illinois. Within 10 years the branch in Chicago became independent of the yeshiva in Cleveland and no longer has an official formal connection to the yeshiva in Cleveland, although informal ties remain close.
* Kiryat Ye&#x27;arim (Telz-Stone), Israel. In 1977, Mordechai Gifter brought a group of 20 students from Cleveland to open a branch of the yeshiva in Kiryat Ye&#x27;arim (Telz-Stone), Israel. Classes took place in several apartments. In 1979, when Baruch Sorotzkin died, Gifter was asked to return to Cleveland and the Israeli branch closed.
* Yeshiva of Telshe Alumni. In the early 1980s, Avraham Ausband, a grandson of the &quot;Telzer Rov&quot; Avraham Yitzchak Bloch, was sent to open up the Yeshiva of Telshe Alumni in Riverdale, New York by his Rebbe, Mordechai Gifter.
* Birchas Chaim. In 2001 Chaim Stein&#x27;s son, Shmuel Zalman Stein, opened Yeshivah Birchas Chaim in Lakewood, New Jersey.

<text>On December 16, 1960, a United Air Lines Douglas DC-8 bound for Idlewild Airport (now John F. Kennedy International Airport) in New York City collided in midair with a TWA Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation descending toward LaGuardia Airport. The Constellation crashed on Miller Field in Staten Island and the DC-8 in Park Slope, Brooklyn, killing all 128 aboard the two aircraft and six people on the ground. The accident was the world&#x27;s deadliest aviation disaster at the time, and remains the deadliest accident in the history of United Air Lines. (United Airlines Flight 175, with close to 1000 total deaths, is excluded as the flight crashed not by accident but due to a terrorist attack.)

The accident became known as the Park Slope plane crash or the Miller Field crash after the two crash sites. The accident was also the first hull loss and first fatal accident involving a Douglas DC-8.

==Aircraft and crews==

United Air Lines Flight 826, &quot;Mainliner Will Rogers&quot;, registered as was a DC-8-11 carrying 77 passengers and 7 crew members from O&#x27;Hare International Airport in Chicago to Idlewild Airport in Queens. The crew consisted of Captain Robert Sawyer (age 46), First Officer Robert Fiebing (40), Flight Engineer Richard Pruitt (30) and four stewardesses. Captain Sawyer was a highly experienced pilot, having accumulated 19,100 flight hours, of which 344 were in the DC-8. First Officer Fiebing had accumulated 8,400 flight hours, of which 416 were in the DC-8. Flight Engineer Pruitt had accumulated 8,500 flight hours, of which 379 were in the DC-8.

Trans World Airlines Flight 266, &quot;Star of Sicily&quot;, registered as was a Super Constellation carrying 39 passengers and 5 crew members from Dayton and Columbus, Ohio, to LaGuardia Airport in Queens. The crew consisted of Captain David Wollam (age 39), First Officer Dean Bowen (32), Flight Engineer LeRoy &quot;Lee&quot; Rosenthal (30) and two stewardesses, Margaret Gernat and Patricia Post. Captain Wollam had accumulated 14,583 flight hours, 267 of which were in the Constellation. First Officer Bowen had accumulated 6,411 flight hours, of which 268 were on the Constellation. Flight Engineer Rosenthal had accumulated 3,561 flight hours, of which 204 were in the Constellation. &quot;Star of Sicily&quot; sister ship N6902C, &quot;Star of the Seine&quot;, was destroyed in another mid-air collision with a United Air Lines flight in 1956.

==Background==

At 10:21 a.m. EST, United 826 advised ARINC radio that one of its VOR receivers was inoperative, and the message was relayed to United Air Lines maintenance. However, air-traffic control (ATC) was not informed that the aircraft had only one operational receiver, which presented difficulty for the pilots of flight 826 to identify the Preston intersection, beyond which it had not received clearance.

At 10:25 a.m., ATC issued a revised clearance for the flight to shorten its route to the Preston holding point (near Laurence Harbor, New Jersey) by . That clearance included holding instructions (a standard &quot;racetrack&quot; holding pattern) for Flight 826 when it arrived at the Preston intersection. Flight 826 was expected to reduce its speed before reaching Preston to a standard holding speed of or lower. However, the aircraft was estimated to be traveling at when it collided with the TWA plane, several miles beyond the Preston clearance limit.

During the investigation, United Air Lines claimed that the Colts Neck VOR was unreliable. Preston was the point where airway V123—the 050-radial off the Robbinsville VOR—crossed the Solberg 120-degree radial and the Colts Neck 346-degree radial. However, the Civil Aeronautics Board&#x27;s final report found no problem with the Colts Neck VOR.

The prevailing conditions were light rain and fog, which had been preceded by snowfall.

==Collision and ground impacts==

According to the DC-8&#x27;s flight data recorder, the aircraft was off course, and for 81 seconds it descended at while slowing from more than to at the time of the collision.

One of the DC-8&#x27;s starboard engines struck the Constellation just ahead of its wings, tearing apart a portion of the fuselage. The Constellation entered a dive, with debris continuing to fall as it disintegrated during its spiral to the ground.

The initial impact tore the DC-8&#x27;s engine from its pylon. Having lost one engine and a large part of the right wing, the DC-8 remained airborne for another 90 seconds.

The DC-8 crashed into the Park Slope section of Brooklyn at the intersection of Seventh Avenue and Sterling Place (), scattering wreckage and setting fire to ten brownstone apartment buildings, the Pillar of Fire Church, the McCaddin Funeral Home, a Chinese laundry and a delicatessen. Six people on the ground were killed.

The crash left the remains of the DC-8 pointing southeast toward a large open field at Prospect Park, blocks from its crash site. An occupant in one of the affected apartment buildings said that his family survived because they were in the only room of their apartment that was not destroyed. The crash left a trench covering most of the length of the middle of Sterling Place. Witnesses thought that a bomb had detonated or that a building&#x27;s boiler had exploded.

The TWA plane crashed onto the northwest corner of Miller Field at , with some sections of the aircraft landing in New York Harbor. At least one passenger fell into a tree before the wreckage hit the ground.

There was no radio contact with traffic controllers from either plane after the collision, although LaGuardia had begun tracking an incoming, fast-moving, unidentified plane from Preston toward the LaGuardia &quot;Flatbush&quot; outer marker.

==Investigation==

The likely cause of the accident was identified in a report by the US Civil Aeronautics Board:

The report notes &quot;various steps to improve and strengthen the efficiency and effectiveness of its Air Traffic Control System&quot; based on the crash investigation. Listed steps include better reporting of malfunctioning communications/navigation equipment, retrofitting airplanes with distance measuring equipment, improved handoff techniques for air traffic control, and additional speed rules when approaching a destination airport.

==Victims==
The only person to initially survive the crash was Stephen Baltz, an 11-year-old boy from Wilmette, Illinois. He was traveling unaccompanied on Flight 826 to spend Christmas in Yonkers with relatives. He was thrown from the plane into a snowbank, where his burning clothing was extinguished. Although alive and conscious, he was severely burned and had inhaled burning fuel. Baltz died of pneumonia the next day.

Other notable victims included chemist Jonas Kamlet, who was on Flight 826, and Garry and Caroline Myers, the founders of the children&#x27;s magazine &quot;Highlights,&quot; both of whom were on Flight 266. Mountaineer Edmund Hillary, known for being one of the first two people to reach the summit of Mount Everest, was also booked onto Flight 826 but arrived too late to board.

==Legacy==
The total of 134 victims would not be surpassed until a Lockheed C-130B Hercules was shot down in May 1968, killing 155 people. In terms of commercial aviation, the death toll would not be surpassed until the March 1969 crash of Viasa Flight 742, which crashed on takeoff and killed all 84 people on board the aircraft, as well as 71 people on the ground.

In 2010, on the 50th anniversary of the accident, a memorial to the 134 victims of the two crashes was unveiled in Green-Wood Cemetery, Brooklyn. The cemetery is the site of the common grave containing the remains of those who could not be identified.

The collision is covered in &quot;Collision Course&quot;, the fifth episode of the first season of The Weather Channel documentary series &quot;Why Planes Crash&quot;.

The collision figures prominently in Episode 3, Season 5 of the Amazon television series &quot;The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel&quot;.

The collision is a plot point in Kristin Harmel&#x27;s book &quot;The Paris Daughter&quot;.

The collision is featured in the novella &quot;If It Bleeds&quot; by Stephen King, which was published in 2020 in the anthology of the same name.

<doc id="1343245" wikidata="Q1395728" url="?curid=1343245" title="Fanny (1961 film)">
<text>Fanny is a 1961 American Technicolor romantic drama film directed by Joshua Logan. The screenplay by Julius J. Epstein is based on the book for the 1954 stage musical of the same title by Logan and S.N. Behrman, which in turn had been adapted from Marcel Pagnol&#x27;s trilogy. Pagnol wrote two plays, &quot;Marius&quot; (1929) and &quot;Fanny&quot; (1931) and completed the trilogy by writing and directing a film, &quot;César&quot;, in 1936. Previously, &quot;Marius&quot; (1931) and &quot;Fanny&quot; (1932) had also been produced as films.

The film deleted all the songs from &quot;Fanny&quot;, the stage musical, but the music by Harold Rome served as the underscore for the soundtrack, and the title tune is used as the main title theme. It was nominated for both the Academy Award and the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score.

==Plot==
César is a barkeeper in Marseille in the early 1920s. His 18-year-old son Marius works for him at his bar, but is obsessed with going to sea and leaving his boring existence behind. The only thing holding him back is Fanny, an 18-year-old girl with whom he grew up. Fanny works selling fish with her mother down at the waterfront. Fanny has been in love with Marius her whole life. She flirts with him, but Marius always rejects her.

Fanny invites Marius to a Sunday-night dance, but he rejects her once more. Unbeknownst to Fanny, Marius is planning to leave the next day. Encouraged by his friend, the “Admiral”, he has secretly signed on as a sailor on a round-the-world scientific expedition. Offended by his rejection, Fanny leaves.

Meanwhile, Panisse, an older merchant and a widower, asks to meet with Fanny&#x27;s mother Honorine, who believes he wants to propose to her. To Honorine&#x27;s surprise, Panisse wants to marry Fanny, even though he knows she loves someone else. Although disappointed, Honorine does not object: Panisse is worth 600,000 francs.

Fanny tells Marius that she has rejected Panisse&#x27;s proposal because she loves him and is willing to wait until he returns. Marius tells her he will be away for five years and to forget about him. They declare their love for each other and go to Fanny&#x27;s house, where they sleep together.

The following morning, Honorine discovers Fanny and Marius in bed together. She and César begin to plan their children&#x27;s wedding, but Fanny urges Marius to leave and follow his heart. She even lies to him, telling him that she would rather marry a rich man like Panisse than him. But, in truth, she is afraid that, eventually, he will grow to hate her for depriving him of this great opportunity.

About two months after Marius goes off to sea, Fanny discovers that she is pregnant with his child. She tells Panisse, who is happy to marry her anyway, overjoyed by the possibility of an heir to carry on his name. They marry, and Fanny gives birth to a boy. César, knowing the baby&#x27;s true father, collaborates with Panisse to give the baby the name Césario Marius Panisse.

On Césario&#x27;s first birthday, Panisse takes the train to Paris on business. While he is gone, Marius returns, on a short leave. He visits Fanny and, upon learning her child is his, apologizes to Fanny. He knows now that she said those things only to make him follow his passion for the sea. Marius tells her that he wants her back, but César comes in before anything can happen. Panisse arrives home early. Knowing that Fanny will not leave without the boy, he says that he will not try to stop Fanny from going with Marius, but he will not part with the child. Fanny tells Marius she loves him, but she will not take Césario from Panisse. Marius leaves without Fanny or his child.

Ten years later, Césario is looking forward to his birthday party. After being taken to the waterfront, Césario wanders off and meets the Admiral. The Admiral takes the boy sailing without telling anyone and reunites him with Marius, though Césario has no idea who Marius is. Marius, who is now working in a garage, is overjoyed to see his son, but when Panisse is told the boy is missing, he is stricken and taken to his room. Fanny is shocked to find Césario with his father. She announces that Panisse is dying, and Marius drives them home.

When they arrive at the house, Panisse calls for Césario to sit with him. Fanny goes outside and talks with Cesar and Marius. Marius expresses his bitterness and announces his plans to leave for the United States the next day. Fanny explains to Marius that she never told him about the baby because on the day he left, she hoped he would turn around and not get on the boat. When he did not, she felt betrayed and angry. Fanny goes to Panisse. On his deathbed, Panisse dictates a letter asking Marius to marry Fanny and be a father to Césario. His only request is that the boy keep the last name, Panisse.

==Cast==
==Production==
Several versions of the Pagnol works had been filmed prior to this adaptation. The original film trilogy in French was directed by Alexander Korda (&quot;Marius&quot;, 1931), Marc Allégret (&quot;Fanny&quot;, 1932) and Pagnol himself (&quot;César&quot;, 1936). There was a 1933 Italian film named &quot;Fanny&quot;, the 1934 German film &quot;Der Schwarze Walfisch&quot; (&quot;The Black Whale&quot;), and &quot;Port of Seven Seas&quot;, a 1938 American film directed by James Whale, also based on the trilogy.

Jack L. Warner purchased the screen rights to the stage musical, but believing that the popularity of musical films was on the wane, he decided to eliminate the songs. &quot;West Side Story&quot;, released the same year as &quot;Fanny&quot;, proved to be a box office success. The production did benefit significantly from the decision: Charles Boyer, who had refused the role when it involved singing because he would neither sing nor allow his voice to be dubbed, gladly accepted when that was no longer necessary. Boyer and Chevalier, who were old friends, were delighted to be able to work together, at last.

Before the picture&#x27;s release, art house theater owners booked the original films, promoting the showings as the last opportunity to see them before the new picture came out. In fact, Warner&#x27;s acquisition of the screen rights removed the films from circulation for decades.

Plans for the original title, &quot;Joshua Logan&#x27;s Fanny&quot;, were scrapped when reporters pointed out the double meaning.

Screenwriter Julius J. Epstein had collaborated with Joshua Logan on &quot;Tall Story&quot; the previous year, but he initially declined the director&#x27;s offer to adapt &quot;Fanny&quot; for the screen, because he found it difficult to believe Marius&#x27; motivation for leaving Marseille. He accepted the assignment after Logan found a solution in Marius&#x27; relationship with his father. Epstein relied on Pagnol&#x27;s plays for inspiration, but retained the ending of the musical, which was quite different from the plot of Pagnol&#x27;s original film, &quot;César&quot;. Some scenes and dialogue are taken directly from the 1938 film.

Prior to Warner&#x27;s decision to film the property as a straight drama, Logan had offered Charles Boyer the role of César but the actor declined because he felt he could not sing and was unwilling to lip sync to someone else&#x27;s voice. When the songs were dropped, he accepted the offer. He and Maurice Chevalier, cast as Panisse, were old friends but had never performed together. Both welcomed the opportunity to do so.

Audrey Hepburn agreed to portray Fanny but eventually had to decline the role due to prior commitments. Assuming the French would dislike an English language interpretation of the Pagnol plays, Leslie Caron was hesitant to replace her, but she liked the script and accepted three weeks before principal photography began.

Among the Marseille locations used for filming were Notre-Dame de la Garde and Vieux Port.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; observed, &quot;Whether fan of the Pagnol films or stage show, whether partial to music or no, you can&#x27;t help but derive joy from this picture if you have a sense of humor and a heart. For Mr. Logan, with the aid of expert craftsmen and a cast of principals that we do not believe an act of divine cooperation could have greatly improved upon, has given the charming Marseilles folk play a stunning pictorial sweep, a deliciously atmospheric flavor and a flesh-touching intimacy. And, embraced by these graphic, sensuous virtues are the rich human, comic elements that flowed out of Pagnol&#x27;s little pictures and glimmered upon the Broadway stage . . . To be sure, there are flaws in the compound. The cutting is often too abrupt, some scenes are confused by intercutting, and the tempo in the early phases is much too fast. Also, occasionally the actors are costumed too prettily, and the domestic magnificence of the Panisses in the last part is tasteless and absurd . . . [But] on the whole, the appropriate atmosphere of Marseilles is literally and colorfully conveyed — in excellent color, by the way. Perhaps there will be some prim objection to the lush emotionalism of it all and to the frankness of the musical nudging, but we loved it.&quot;

===Box office===
&quot;Fanny&quot; was the highest-grossing film at Radio City Music Hall in New York City at the time, grossing $1,573,582 in nine weeks and was number one at the US box office for three weeks.

<text>The Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee ( SGPC; Supreme Gurdwara Management Committee) is an organization in India responsible for the management of &quot;gurdwaras&quot;, Sikh places of worship, in the states of Punjab and Himachal Pradesh and the union territory of Chandigarh. SGPC also administers Darbar Sahib in Amritsar.

The SGPC is governed by the president of SGPC. The SGPC manages the security, financial, facility maintenance and religious aspects of Gurdwaras as well as keeping archaeologically rare and sacred artifacts, including weapons, clothes, books and writings of the Sikh Gurus.

Bibi Jagir Kaur became the first woman to be elected president of the SGPC for the second time in September 2004. She had held the same post from March 1999 to November 2000.

==History==

===Foundation===
In 1920 the emerging Akali leadership summoned a general assembly of the Sikhs holding all shades of opinion on 15 November 1920 in vicinity of the Akal Takht in Amritsar. The purpose of this assembly was to elect a representative committee of the Sikhs to administer the Harimandir Sahib Complex and other important historical gurdwaras. Two days before the proposed conference the British government set up its own committee consisting of 36 Sikhs to manage the Harimandir Sahib. Sikhs held their scheduled meeting and elected a bigger committee consisting of 175 members and named it Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee. The members of the government appointed committee were also included in it. Harbans Singh Attari became vice president and Sunder Singh Ramgarhia became secretary of the committee. By that time Master Tara Singh had started taking interest in Sikh religious affairs. He was one of the 175 members elected to the committee. The formation of Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee provided a focal point for the movement for the reformation of Sikh religious places. The committee began to take over management of gurdwaras one by one, and were resisted by incumbent mahants.

Starting in late 1920, a large number of reformers both in urban and rural Punjab had joined to form separate and independent religious orders called jathas. The primary purpose of a jatha was to gain control over local gurdwaras. A jatha under the command of a jathedar would occupy a shrine and try to take over management in its favor from its current incumbents. Sometimes the transfer went peacefully especially in the case of smaller Gurdwaras with less income resources. This was done sometimes with the threat of force.

The Sikh leadership was fully aware of the importance of the press for the success of any movement. It enlisted the active support and sympathy of some of the important nationalist papers in the country like &#x27;The Independent&#x27;, Swaraj (Hindi), The Tribune, Liberal, Kesri (Urdu), Milap (Urdu), Zamindar (Urdu) and Bande Matram (Hindi).Two of the vernacular dailies Akali (Pbi.) and the Akali-te-Pardesi (Urdu), edited by Master Tara Singh also played an important role. It brought the necessary awakening among the Sikh masses and prepared them to undertake the struggle for reform. With the direct and indirect support of the Central Sikh League, the Indian National Congress and the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee, the Shiromani Akali Dal started a non-violent struggle against the government for the control of the Gurdwaras. The reports of some immoral acts perpetrated at Tarn-Taran reached the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee at its meeting on 14 January 1921. A fortnight earlier a local jatha was beaten up and not allowed to perform kirtan at the gurdwara. It decided to send a jatha from Amritsar under Jathedar Teja Singh Bhuchar. Jathedar Kartar Singh Jhabbar with Akalis from &#x27;Khara Sauda Bar&#x27; joined him. On 25 January, a group of about forty workers took over the control of Sri Darbar Sahib Tarn-Taran from its Mahant. In the ensuing conflict two Akalis were killed and several others wounded by the henchmen of the Mahants. The Mahants were ousted from the Gurdwara and the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee appointed a managing committee.

===Gurdwaras Act of 1925===

In early 1920s, Malcolm Hailey, the governor of the Punjab showed his readiness to assist the Sikhs in taking possession of all the important Gurdwaras in the province through a five-member committee constituted by the Sikh members of the legislative council. Hailey presented a draft of a new Gurdwara Bill to the Akali leaders imprisoned in Lahore fort. Master Tara Singh, Bhag singh Advocate, Gurcharn singh Advocate, Teja Singh Akerpuri (Jathedar AkalTakht Sahib) Sohan Singh Josh and Sardar Teja Singh Samundri studied each clause of the bill carefully. The bill met all the Akali demands and was signed into law on 28 July 1925 by the Viceroy of India after its ratification by the Punjab legislative council. The Act came into force on 1 November 1925 with a gazette notification from the government of Punjab.

The Act made a Central Gurdwara Board elected by the Sikhs to be the custodian of all important Sikh places of worship. The first meeting of the Gurdwara board passed a resolution that its designation be changed to Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee, which was accepted by the government. Thus ended what came to be known in common parlance as the &#x27;Third Sikh War&#x27;. The Punjab government withdrew its orders declaring the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee and other Akali organs as unlawful associations and recognized the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee as a representative body of the Sikhs. In making the Punjab government agree to such recognition, the Akali leadership undoubtedly scored a victory over the bureaucracy. The Sikh Gurdwara bill met most of the demands of the Sikhs, but the government was willing to release the prisoners conditionally i.e. on the understanding to be given by the Akalis that they would agree to work for the Gurdwara Act. The Shiromani Akali Dal and the executive declared conditions imposed for the release of prisoners as wholly unnecessary, unjust and derogatory. Among the prominent Akalis, Mehtab Singh and Giani Sher Singh along with twenty other Akali leaders accepted the conditional release. Master Tara Singh, Bhag Singh Advocate, Teja Singh Samundari, Teja singh Akerpuri (Jathedar Akal Takht) and Fifteen other Akalis did not come out as government emphasis on eliciting written assurance and acceptance was to Master Tara Singh, an attack on the self-respect of the Sikhs. He said, &quot;We ourselves have enacted this Act and we are responsible for implementing it, then why this condition?&quot; Teja Singh Samundari died of a heart attack in the jail after some time. The Punjab Government failed to prove the charges against Master Tara Singh and the remaining Akalis, few months later they all were released unconditionally. The courage and sacrifice shown by the Akalis during the trial very soon drove the Mehtab Singh&#x27;s group out of the political field and led to a rift in the Akali ranks, as the newly released Akalis condemned Mehtab Singh&#x27;s group as collaborators. Mehtab Singh&#x27;s group was also known as &#x27;Rai Bahadur Party&#x27;. This group had majority in the committee and Mehtab Singh was elected its president. The Akali Party launched a campaign against the conditionally released leaders. When the new elections for the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee were held, the Akali Party won majority and the newly elected Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee elected Kharak Singh as the President and Master Tara Singh as the Vice President. Since Baba Kharak Singh had not yet been released the responsibility of the president fell on the shoulders of Master Tara Singh.At the time of 1996 the first time SGPC election is held in Himachal Pradesh and the first person who won from that seat is the candidate of Panthak Akalidal whose name is Satnam Singh Gill.

===1953 amendment to Gurdwaras Act of 1925===
In 1953, an amendment to the 1925 act allowed the reservation of 20 out 140 seats on the SGPC for the members of the Sikh scheduled castes

===2016 amendment to Gurdwaras Act of 1925===
The 2016 amendment to the act by the Indian parliament stripped around 7 million &#x27;Sehajdhari&#x27; Sikhs of voting in the SGPC elections

==Presidents==
The president of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) is elected by the Members of SGPC. The president holds powers to organise the meetings of SGPC and deal with matters related with issues of Sikh religion and oversees the managements of the Gurdwaras. Since 2008, the president also serves as Chancellor of Sri Guru Granth Sahib World University.

In 1920 SGPC was established when Gurdwara Reform Movement was started. Sundar Singh Majithia was appointed first President of the committee. This post got legal status after the passing of Sikh Gurdwaras Act, 1925 by legislation in British India.

After passing of this act Baba Kharak Singh became the President. The longest-served president of SGPC till now is Gurcharan Singh Tohra and shortest-served is Gopal Singh Qaumi who served only for one day in June 1933. The first and the only woman president was Jagir Kaur.

===List of presidents===
== Controversies ==

=== Casteism ===

The SGPC has been accused of representing the interests of Jat Sikhs over other castes and its membership and leadership being dominated by members of the Jat community, which makes other castes feel left out and discriminated against. In defence, the SGPC&#x27;s early history of fighting casteism has been highlighted and the actions they take against reported instances of caste-based discrimination. Also, a former Jathedar of the Akal Takht claims to be from a lower-caste background.

=== Allegations of apathy to heritage ===

The SGPC has been criticized by Sikh organizations and individuals for having an apathetic and destructive attitude towards historical Sikh heritage sites, artwork, and architecture. In response to these criticisms, the SGPC announced that it has launched a project to document Sikh heritage. As many as ninety percent of Sikh heritage monuments have been destroyed in Punjab in the name of renovation and kar seva. Historic trees associated with Sikh history are also at risk due to neglectful and poorly made judgements without consulting botanical experts, such as strangling the roots and base with concrete and marble, covering the trees with fibre glass, and erecting steel beams around the trunks. Efforts are ongoing to revive and preserve the life of the &quot;Beri&quot; trees surrounding the Golden Temple. The SGPC has also been criticized for their lack of action on preventing &quot;beadbi&quot; (desecrations) of the Guru Granth Sahib and other Sikh scriptures from occurring. Large amounts of historical Sikh scriptural manuscripts have been systematically &quot;cremated&quot; (burnt to destruction) over the years at secretive &quot;‘Angitha Sahib’&quot; gurdwaras in Punjab.

According to Sikh scholar, Gurtej Singh, on who is to blame for the plight of Sikh historical heritage:

On 6 September 2023, the SGPC announced plans to digitize Sikh literature and scriptures kept in the collection of Sri Guru Ramdas Library in Amritsar. There are plans to make the digitized works available to the public on a website in the near future.

=== Lack of action towards missionaries ===

After being criticized for their lack of action in responding the growing number of Sikhs leaving the fold and converting to Christianity and not addressing the caste and social issues that gives impetus to the phenomenon, and as a response to the allegations and growing tension between the local Sikh and Christian communities, the SGPC had announced a drive called &quot;Ghar Ghar Andar Dharamsaal&quot; (meaning &#x27;sacred shrine within every home&#x27;) to counter missionaries targeting Sikhs and to educate the Sikh population on the tenets of their faith.

=== Monopoly on determining Sikh identity ===

The SGPC has been accused for enforcing their standards on who and who is not considered a Sikh. This leaves many heterodox sects, such as Nirmalas, Nirankaris, Udasis, and others feeling marginalized and erased from the Sikh community by the orthodox SGPC. The SGPC has clarified that members of the Udasi and Nirmala sects are &quot;Sikhs&quot;.

=== Sexism ===

Women currently are unofficially banned from singing or performing &quot;kirtan&quot; (religious devotional singing and musical performance) in sanctum sanctorum of the Golden Temple, a gurdwara under the management of the SGPC. The Punjab Legislative Assembly passed a motion to allow women to perform there in 2019. In 1999, Bibi Jagir Kaur became the first female president of the SGPC.

=== Religious discrimination ===

Traditional Muslim &quot;rababis&quot; and &quot;kirtanis&quot;, including claimed descendants of Bhai Mardana (companion of Guru Nanak), have been banned from performing at the Golden Temple since 1947 as the SGPC has altered the rules to only allow baptized Khalsa Sikhs to perform services at the Golden Temple. Before partition, they were granted special allowance to perform at the temple.

=== Corruption ===
Allegations of large-scale corruption have been claimed against the SGPC.

<text>Charles Jeremy &quot;Chaz&quot; Jankel (born 16 April 1952) is an English musician and songwriter. In a music career spanning more than 40 years, he came to prominence in the late 1970s as the guitarist and keyboardist of the rock band Ian Dury and the Blockheads. With Dury, Jankel co-wrote some of the band&#x27;s best-known songs including &quot;Sex &amp; Drugs &amp; Rock &amp; Roll&quot;, &quot;Hit Me with Your Rhythm Stick&quot; and &quot;Reasons to Be Cheerful, Part 3&quot;.

In addition to his work with the Blockheads, Jankel has had a solo career which has resulted in nine studio albums. He has a long list of credits as both a performer and as songwriter.

==Early life==
Charles Jeremy Jankel was born on 16 April 1952 in Stanmore, Middlesex. Inspired by skiffle singer Lonnie Donegan, he started to learn how to play the Spanish guitar at age 7, and then went on to study the piano. He attended the boarding school Mill Hill School and became a fan of the American rock, funk and soul band Sly and the Family Stone during his time there. Jankel&#x27;s fondness for this style was later responsible for much of the funk influence on the Blockheads&#x27; music and also influenced Jankel&#x27;s solo career. As a student at the art college Saint Martin&#x27;s School of Art he played with a folk rock band called Byzantium from 1972 to 1973.

==Career==
In 1973, Jankel contributed a track titled &quot;Let&#x27;s Go&quot; to Long John Baldry&#x27;s studio album &quot;Good to Be Alive&quot;. He then joined the folk rock band Jonathan Kelly&#x27;s Outside and worked on their only studio album &quot;...Waiting on You&quot;, released in early 1974. Jankel first started working with Ian Dury as part of the pub rock band Kilburn and the High Roads in the early part of the 1970s. He went on to work with Dury on albums such as 1977&#x27;s &quot;New Boots and Panties!!&quot; and the Blockheads&#x27; albums including the 1979 release &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; before leaving the band. He wrote funk songs such as &quot;Hit Me with your Rhythm Stick&quot;, and &quot;Sex &amp; Drugs &amp; Rock &amp; Roll&quot;. In 1981, Jankel joined Dury again, without the Blockheads, for his second solo studio album &quot;Lord Upminster&quot;, which spawned the US Top 40 dance hit &quot;Spasticus Autisticus&quot;, which he co-wrote.

After leaving the Blockheads, Jankel pursued a solo career and issued four studio albums for A&amp;M, including his 1980 self-titled debut and 1981&#x27;s &quot;Chasanova&quot;, which was also released under the title &quot;Questionnaire&quot;. This album featured major lyrical contributions from Ian Dury, and musical contributions from two of the Blockheads, bassist Norman Watt-Roy, and drummer Charlie Charles and also contained the US dance hit &quot;Glad to Know You&quot;, which was one of the tracks with lyrics written by Dury, plus the MTV music video of its title track. In 1981, Quincy Jones had a UK chart hit with a cover version of Jankel&#x27;s &quot;Ai No Corrida&quot;, which reached No. 14 in April of that year. The song was also covered by the Nylons, and Laura More with Uniting Nations. In 2005, the Uniting Nations&#x27; version peaked at No. 18 in the UK.

Jankel hit No. 1 on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart in 1982 with the triple A-side &quot;Glad to Know You&quot;/&quot;3,000,000 Synths&quot;/&quot;Ai No Corrida&quot;. His single &quot;Number One&quot; went to No. 1 in the clubs in France and was used in the 1985 film &quot;Real Genius&quot;. He went on to release the studio albums &quot;Chazablanca&quot; in 1983 and &quot;Looking at You&quot; in 1985. In 1985 Jerry Moss, the recording executive of A&amp;M, rejected the release of his fifth album, and terminated his recording career with the label.

After both of Jankel&#x27;s parents died, he moved to the US in 1988 and lived there for several years before returning to the UK to rejoin the Blockheads, working with Dury on their final two studio albums with him: &quot;Mr. Love Pants&quot; (1998), and &quot;Ten More Turnips from the Tip&quot; (2000) on which later album he took lead vocals on the song &quot;I Could Lie&quot;. After Dury&#x27;s death in 2000, Jankel continued to write and perform with the Blockheads, with Dury&#x27;s former friend and minder Derek Hussey being Dury&#x27;s replacement.

Jankel has several composer credits for films, including &quot;DOA&quot; (1988), which was co-directed by his sister Annabel Jankel, and &quot;K2&quot; (1991). Jankel composed the majority of the music for the Dury biopic &quot;Sex &amp; Drugs &amp; Rock &amp; Roll&quot; (2010), in which he was portrayed by Tom Hughes. Jankel received a BAFTA nomination for the film&#x27;s music.

In 2010, Jankel released his first compilation album titled &quot;My Occupation – The Music of Chaz Jankel&quot; which included the songs &quot;Ai No Corrida&quot;, &quot;Glad to Know You&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re My Occupation&quot;. This album also contained the additional song &quot;Get Myself Together&quot; 

Since 2001 Jankel had issued records on his own CJ Records label. Jankel recorded a single with Cherry Cameron in 2016.

==Personal life==
In September 1988 Jankel moved to Venice, Los Angeles, where he lived with his Swedish girlfriend Catharina Hemberg. They were married on the island of Kauai in Hawaii. Jankel and Hemberg have a son, Tao Hemberg Jankel, born in Hollywood in 1990. Tao lives and works in Oslo, Norway and is a successful DJ; when he was very young, his parents divorced and his mother moved back to Sweden.

In 1992 Jankel moved back to the UK, where he met artist Elaine O&#x27;Halloran, on the set of the film &quot;The Rachel Papers&quot; (1989), where she was assistant editor. The couple married and have a son, Lewis Shay Jankel, born in 1993, who is a DJ, record producer, singer and songwriter, using the stage name Shift K3Y.

His sister Annabel Jankel is a film and television director who, in 2018, directed the British film drama &quot;Tell It to the Bees&quot;; Jankel wrote a piano piece called &quot;Unresolved&quot; which features in the soundtrack.

<text>The Methylococcaceae are a family of bacteria that obtain their carbon and energy from methane, called methanotrophs.

They comprise the type I methanotrophs, in contrast to the Methylocystaceae or type II methanotrophs. They belong to Gammaproteobacteria, and are typically given their own order.

The Methylococcaceae have internal membranes in the form of flattened discs, perpendicular to the cell wall. Methane is oxidized to give formaldehyde, which is fixed by a process called the ribulose monophosphate (RuMP) cycle. Here formaldehyde is combined with sugar ribulose, producing hexulose. This, in turn, is broken down to produce glyceraldehyde, which is used to produce new ribulose and other organic compounds. Catabolism does not involve a complete citric acid cycle.

Some species of the Methylococcaceae have formed with certain marine mussels endosymbiotic relationships.

<doc id="1343282" wikidata="Q463861" url="?curid=1343282" title="Joseph Gungl">
<text>Joseph Gungl, correct: &quot;Josef Gung&#x27;l&quot; (1 December 1809 – 1 February 1889), was a Hungarian composer, bandmaster, and conductor. He was soprano Virginia Naumann-Gungl&#x27;s father.

==Biography==
Gungl was born in Schambeck, Austrian-Hungarian monarchy (now Zsámbék, Hungary). After working as a school-teacher in Buda, and learning the elements of music from the school-choirmaster, he became first oboist at Graz, and, at twenty-five, bandmaster of the 4th Regiment of Austrian Artillery. His first composition, a Hungarian march, written in 1836, attracted some notice, and in 1843 he was able to establish an orchestra in Berlin. With this band he travelled far, even to the United States in 1848–1849. Mendelssohn&#x27;s complete &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; music is said to have been first played by Gungl&#x27;s orchestra. In 1853 he became bandmaster to the 23rd Infantry Regiment at Brno, but in 1864 he moved to Munich, and in 1876 at Frankfurt, after having conducted with great success a series of promenade concerts at the Covent Garden in London in 1873. From Frankfurt, Gungl went to Weimar to live with his daughter, a well-known German opera singer, and died there.

==Compositions==
Gungl was a very prolific composer, and in his lifetime composed no less than 436 dances, the most popular of which being the waltzes &quot;Amoretten&quot;, &quot;Hydropaten&quot;, &quot;Casino&quot; and &quot;Dreams on the Ocean&quot;, the &quot;In Stiller Mitternacht&quot; polka, and the &quot;Blue Violets&quot; mazurka. His Hungarian march was transcribed by Franz Liszt. His music is characterized by the same-easy flowing melodies and well-marked rhythm that distinguish the dances of the younger Strauss, to whom alone he can be ranked second in this kind of composition.

<text>César Cedeño Encarnación (born February 25, 1951) is a Dominican former professional baseball player and coach. He played in Major League Baseball as a center fielder from 1970 to 1986, most prominently as a member of the Houston Astros where he helped the franchise win its first-ever National League Western Division title and postseason berth in .

The four-time All-Star player combined speed and power to become one of the best all around players of his era. Cedeño set the standards for major league outfielders in the early 1970s by winning five consecutive Gold Glove Awards between 1972 and 1976. He became only the second player in Major League Baseball history to hit 20 home runs and steal 50 bases in one season, and the only major leaguer to do so in three consecutive seasons. He also played for the Cincinnati Reds, St. Louis Cardinals and the Los Angeles Dodgers.

After his playing career, Cedeño spent several years as a minor league hitting coach for the Astros and Nationals organizations. In 2020, Cedeño was inducted into the Houston Astros Hall of Fame. Cedeño still holds the Astros team record for career stolen bases more than 40 years after last playing for the team.

==Baseball career==

===Houston Astros===

Signed by Houston as an amateur free agent in 1967, Cedeño debuted on June 20, 1970, at 19 years of age. His .310 batting average in his rookie season in , allowed him to finish 4th in the Rookie of the Year voting. The next season, he led the major leagues in doubles. On September 2 of that year, he hit an unusual home run: against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Astrodome, with the bases loaded, he hit a blooper that dropped between the right fielder and second baseman, who collided with one another as the ball rolled away; Cedeno and the rest of his teammates scurried quickly to reach home plate for an inside-the-park grand slam. The following season, his third, he again led in doubles, not just his league, but in the majors. He batted .320 in both 1972 and 1973. In 1972, Cedeño hit 22 home runs, had 55 stolen bases, and again led the league in doubles. He won a Gold Glove Award that season as well. Houston manager Leo Durocher once compared Cedeño to Willie Mays, saying &quot;At 22 Cedeño is as good or better than Willie was at the same age&quot;.
Possessing a rare combination of power, blazing speed, and good defense, Cedeño became the second man in Major League history (after Lou Brock in 1967) to join the 20–50 club, hitting 20 home runs and stealing 50 bases in the same season. He accomplished the feat three years in a row (1972–1974), making him the only player in major league history to do so. Further, he stole 50-plus bases the next three years (1975–1977), twice led the league in doubles (1971–1972) and collected 102 RBI in the 1974 season.

Cedeño recorded his 1,000th career hit on July 2, 1976, against the Cincinnati Reds, doing so on a single against Pat Zachry, which was the second of four hits he would record in the game (including a 14th inning home run to help boost the Astros to a 10–7 win). Before his 26th birthday, Cedeño had accumulated 1,097 hits, the 13th highest total for a 25-year-old player in MLB history, having more than Rogers Hornsby (1,073) and Mickey Mantle (1,080), both of whom were inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.

On September 9, 1981, while playing at Atlanta Stadium, Cedeño entered the stands to confront a heckler. No punches were thrown and no charges were filed, but Cedeño was ejected from the game and immediately suspended as a result. On September 11, Cedeño was fined $5,000 by National League President Chub Feeney but received no further suspension, as Cedeño apologized to the fan on the phone and in writing which Feeney cited as &quot;mitigating circumstances&quot;.

Cedeño would finish in the top ten of stolen base leaders from 1971 to 1978 and again in 1980. His 550 stolen bases rank 27th all time as of January 2018. A winner of five consecutive Gold Glove Awards (1972–1976), Cedeño appeared in four All-Star Games (1972–1974; 1976), and was a contender for the National League MVP in 1972. In the All-Star Game of that year, Cedeño beat out Roberto Clemente for the starting National League position. Cedeño also hit for the cycle in both 1972 and 1976.

On December 18, 1981, Cedeño was traded to the Cincinnati Reds for Ray Knight. At the time of his departure from the Astros, he was the team&#x27;s all-time leader in games played, runs, hits, doubles and stolen bases.

===Cincinnati Reds===

Cedeño played in 138 games to begin his Reds career, batting .289 with 142 hits with 16 stolen bases while walking/striking out 41 times each. His next few years would be shaky with the Reds, as he played a combined 291 games over the next three seasons, which had peaks of a .291 batting average in 1985 and lows of .232 in 1983, and he would have more strikeouts than walks in each season as well (after doing so nine times in his 12-year career with Houston). Cedeno collected his 2,000th career hit on April 28, 1985, doing so in the fifth inning against Mike Krukow of the San Francisco Giants. This made him the fifth member of the Reds on the roster to be part of the 2,000-hit club, which included Pete Rose, Tony Pérez, Dave Concepción and Buddy Bell.

=== St. Louis Cardinals===

On August 29, 1985, he was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals for Mark Jackson. With St. Louis he hit .434 with six home runs in 28 games, and arguably provided the necessary power for his new team to outpace the New York Mets to reach the playoffs. With only one month left in the season, Cedeño had the Cardinals&#x27; longest hitting streak during their 1985 season. He then played at first base to replace the injured Jack Clark in the final regular season games, and played in the outfield in the playoffs to help replace the injured Vince Coleman.

He finished his combined 1985 season by playing in 111 games while batting .291 with 14 stolen bases. Cedeno was granted free agency on November 12, 1985.

===Los Angeles Dodgers===

Cedeño finished his career with the Dodgers and played his final game on June 2, 1986.

===Estrellas Orientales===

In between, Cedeño played six seasons for the Estrellas Orientales club of the Dominican Winter League, and reinforced the Tigres del Licey in the 1972 Caribbean Series. He later played with the Gold Coast Suns of the Senior Professional Baseball Association in its 1989 inaugural season.

==Career statistics==

In 17 seasons, Cedeño played in 2,006 games, compiling a .285 batting average (2087-7310), with 436 doubles, 60 triples, 199 home runs, 976 RBI, 550 stolen bases, 664 walks, a .347 on-base percentage and .443 slugging percentage. In 17 post-season games, he hit only .173 (9-52). He played first base and all three outfield positions and recorded a .985 fielding percentage.

==Coaching career==

After retiring, Cedeño has been both a fielding and hitting coach in the Dominican and Venezuelan winter leagues. He also served as a coach for the rookie-level Gulf Coast League farm team of the Washington Nationals before being let go in 2009. After that, he served as a hitting coach for the Greeneville Astros of the Appalachian League.

==Personal life==
On December 11, 1973, when he was 22 years old, Cedeño was involved in an incident in his native Dominican Republic in which a gun discharged in a motel room, killing a 19-year-old woman who was in the room with him. Authorities said Cedeño and the woman were drinking and playing with a gun when the gun fired, killing the 19-year-old. He was initially charged with voluntary manslaughter and held in prison without bail, while his lawyers negotiated for a reduction of the charge to involuntary manslaughter. He was held for 20 days before he was released on bail. He was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter and fined $100. Cedeño&#x27;s reputation with fans suffered greatly for the remainder of his career, and Cedeño thereafter never achieved a popularity with fans commensurate with his formidable on-field productivity.

In 1992, Cedeño was charged with battery in Orlando, Florida, in an incident involving his then-pregnant girlfriend, Pamela Lamon. This followed a 1988 incident involving Lamon in which Cedeño was charged with assault, causing bodily injury, and resisting arrest.

<text>The Mississauga News is a local news website in Mississauga, Ontario. &quot;The Mississauga News&quot; is part of Metroland Media Group, a subsidiary of Torstar.

Originally founded as a newspaper in 1965, the &quot;News&quot; ceased publishing a physical edition in 2023 after parent company Metroland entered bankruptcy protection and now operates as a news website.

==History==

Founded in 1965, &quot;The Mississauga News&quot; is characterized by its coverage of local issues, including those relating to civic politics, arts and entertainment, sports, crime, and recreation.

Upon Eve Adams&#x27; election as an MP in Stephen Harper&#x27;s Conservative government, in the 2011 federal election, a seat in the City of Mississauga council was made available. &quot;In the interest of ensuring fair and unbiased coverage for all candidates running in the Sept. 19 Ward 5 by-election,&quot; all stories about the vote and candidates were defaulted to not allow comments.

==Publishers==

* Ron Lenyk (1978-2008)
* Ken Nugent (2009-2012)
* Dana Robbins (2013–2019)

Lenyk joined the &quot;Mississauga News&quot; in 1970 as a sports writer and a year later became the &quot;Mississauga News&quot; editor. In 1977, Lenyk was appointed publisher of The Brampton Guardian and the &quot;Mississauga News&quot; in 1978. He was named South Peel regional publisher and vice-president of Metroland Media Group Ltd. in 2004 and in 2008 the Ontario Press Council elected Lenyk as one of its four new directors to represent the newspaper industry.

Ken Nugent announced that he is retiring in January, wrapping up a 40-year career in the community newspaper business. The decision caps a successful career that began when Nugent was hired by &quot;The News&quot; to sell advertising in 1973. Nugent will retire from his post as vice-president and publisher of the Metroland&#x27;s flagship Peel and Southwestern divisions, including &quot;The News&quot; and &quot;The Brampton Guardian&quot;, and presiding over 21 other community newspapers.

Previously the publisher of The Hamilton Spectator, Dana Robbins left the post to take on the new role of the vice-president/regional publisher of Metroland&#x27;s Peel and Southwestern Ontario region as of January 3, 2013. This includes such papers as the &quot;Mississauga News&quot;, The Brampton Guardian, &quot;Orangeville Banner&quot;, &quot;Fergus Elora News Express&quot; and &quot;Wingham Advance Times&quot;.

<text>Shiveluch (), also called Sheveluch, which originates from the name &quot;suelich&quot; which means &quot;smoking mountain&quot; in Itelmen is the northernmost active volcano in Kamchatka Krai, Russia. It and Karymsky are Kamchatka&#x27;s largest, most active and most continuously erupting volcanoes, as well as one of the most active on the planet. Shiveluch erupts around of magma per year, which causes frequent and large hot avalanches and lava dome formations at the summit. Volcanic ash emissions from this volcano often disrupt air traffic connecting the Asian and North American continents.

== Geography ==
Shiveluch belongs to the Kliuchevskaya volcano group, located in central Kamchatka northwest of Ust-Kamchatsk. The nearest settlement from the volcano is Klyuchi, situated from the mountain. The settlement is small enough to evacuate rapidly in case of a major eruption.

== Geologic setting ==
Shiveluch is a volcano within the Kuril–Kamchatka volcanic arc which hosts tens of other volcanoes. As the Pacific Plate crust subducts deeper under the Okhotsk Plate, the melting points of minerals underground are reduced by other materials including water which results in the materials melting and forming into magma which rises onto the surface and forms the volcanoes.

=== Structure ===
There are three elements of the volcano: the stratovolcano Old Shiveluch (Старый Шивелуч); an ancient caldera; and the active Young Shiveluch (Молодой Шивелуч), with an elevation of about . Shiveluch is one of Kamchatka&#x27;s largest and most active volcanic structures. It is a stratovolcano composed of alternating layers of solidified ash, hardened lava and volcanic rocks.

=== Geologic history ===
Shiveluch began forming about 60,000 to 70,000 years ago during the Late Pleistocene, and it has had at least 60 large eruptions during the Holocene. During this era, the most intense period of volcanism — including frequent large and moderate eruptions — occurred around 6500–6400 BC, 2250–2000 BC, and AD 50–650. This coincides with the peak of activity in other Kamchatka volcanoes. The current active period started around 900 BC. Since then, the large and moderate eruptions have been following each other at 50-to-400-year-long intervals. Chemically a full spectrum of subduction-zone lava types occur: basalt, mafic andesite, two-pyroxene andesite, hornblende-hypersthene andesite, hornblende andesite, hornblende dacite, rhyolite.

== Modern activity ==
Catastrophic eruptions took place in 1854 and 1964, when a large part of the lava dome collapsed and created a devastating debris avalanche.

The most recent period of volcanic activity began with the eruption of Young Shiveluch on 15 August 1999, and continues . On 27 February 2015, Shiveluch erupted shooting ash into the atmosphere about crossing the Bering Sea and into Alaska.

=== April 2023 eruption ===
Since mid-2022, volcanologists were expecting an imminent large eruption of Shiveluch due to the unstable state of its lava dome. A strong eruption occurred on 11 April 2023 at 00.54 local time. A progressive increase in activity was observed since 28 March in the form of continued extrusion, fumarole activity, and ash emissions. During the initial paroxysmal explosive phase on 11 April, the volcano ejected a cloud of volcanic gas and ash that reached a height of and spread over an area of . Pyroclastic flows from the eruption traveled up to away from the volcano. The next day, other summit explosions followed, the eruption column of one of which reached an altitude of . The initial phase resulted in the region&#x27;s largest ashfall in 60 years. The Federal Air Transport Agency assigned the eruption a “red” (maximum) hazard code. Because the height of the eruption columns reached the stratosphere, 200,000 tons of sulfur dioxide were released into the upper atmosphere. According to authorities, this eruption, with the exception of heavy ashfall, did not lead to any damage to local settlements and transport infrastructure.

Analysis of radar images from satellites on 15 April showed that the main eruption occurred as a result of the collapse of the lava dome of the volcano to the south, with the formation of a 2 × 2.6 km (1.2 × 1.6 mi) collapse scar in its place. Initially, the collapse process was triggered by a breach of the dome at its base and by the subsequent lateral explosion to the southeast. Thus, the eruption classifies as Peléan. Since 12 April, the activity of the volcano decreased, but the eruption continued in the form of ash ejections of lower intensity and height, and strong fumarole activity continued. Infra-red satellite images on 16 April showed that the volcano is forming a new lava dome inside its new crater.

===August 2024 eruption===
On 18 August 2024 an eruption of Shiveluch occurred following a magnitude 7.0 earthquake off the coast of Kamchatka Krai, sending an ash cloud high, and with a length of heading east and southeast. A &quot;code red&quot; warning was issued for aircraft in the area.

<text>Red Bay is a fishing village in Labrador, notable as a significant underwater archaeological site in the Americas. Between 1530 and the early 17th century, it was a major Basque whaling area. Several whaling ships, both large galleons and small &quot;chalupas&quot;, sank there, and their discovery led to the designation of Red Bay in 2013 as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

== Geography ==

Red Bay is a natural harbour residing in the bay that gives it its name, both names in reference to the red granite cliffs of the region. Because of the sheltered harbour it was used during World War II as a mooring site for naval vessels. In the bay are Penney Island and Saddle Island, which were used by the Basques for their whaling operations. The location of the sunken vessel &quot;San Juan&quot; is near Saddle Island.

== History ==

Between 1550 and the early 17th century, Red Bay, known as &quot;Balea Baya&quot; (Whale Bay), was a centre for Basque whaling operations. Sailors from southern France and northern Spain sent 15 whaleships and 600 men a season to the remote outpost on the Strait of Belle Isle to catch the right whale and bowhead whales that populated the waters there, according to Memorial University of Newfoundland.

In 1565, &quot;San Juan&quot;, sank on a whaling expedition to Labrador. Research by Selma Barkham in Spanish archives suggested that the &quot;San Juan&quot; had been lost in Red Bay and &quot;La Madalena&quot; had sunk in Chateau Bay in the same year. By 1974, Barkham was in contact with archaeologists working for Parks Canada. In 1977, an initial shore-based survey was made of some of Labrador&#x27;s harbours of the Belle Isle Strait. Good evidence of Basque whaling expeditions was found; in Red Bay, this included many whale bones on the beaches, large numbers of clay roofing tiles (the remains of buildings put up by the whalers) and burnt animal fat associated with stone foundations.

Underwater archaeological work started in 1978 and on the third day of diving, the wreck site numbered 24M was located north of Cox Hill on Saddle Island. It is about from the shoreline. The centreline of the hull was aligned roughly north-south with the bow furthest from the beach. The site slopes; the stern was in of water and the bow in about 12 m. It is likely that the ship dragged her anchor in a north-westerly storm at the end of the whaling season when she was loaded with barrels of whale oil and nearly ready to make the transatlantic passage back to her home port. The 24M site was ultimately concluded to most likely be the wreck of &quot;San Juan&quot;. 

The entire hull structure, artefacts and other finds were mapped in situ, excavated and then archaeologically recorded in detail on land. The hull components were disassembled, as necessary, to carry out this process, From the outset of the project, it had been clear that the funds were not available to carry out the large conservation effort needed to keep the structural components of the wreck on land. Therefore, they were returned to the water, being stored in a carefully designed environment which replicates the anaerobic conditions in which the wreck had remained preserved prior to excavation. A reburial process of this scale had not been previously attempted. This was carried out in 1985, the last year of the 24M fieldwork. The reburial site is regularly monitored to confirm the effectiveness of the continued preservation of the wreck timbers. 

Other, smaller vessels, such as chalupas, have also been recovered from the waters.

Another galleon was found 25–35 feet below water in 2004. It was the fourth trans-oceanic ship to have been found in the area.

A cemetery on nearby Saddle Island holds the remains of 140 whalers. Many of the people buried there are thought to have died from drowning and exposure.

Historians believe that a decline in whale stocks eventually led to the abandonment of the whaling stations in Red Bay. Today, an interpretive centre in Red Bay explains the history to visitors.

Local legends of Red Bay make reference to a hidden treasure buried in a body of water known as &quot;Pond on the Hill&quot; at the foot of Tracey Hill by the infamous pirate Captain William Kidd. An attempt was made to find the treasure by residents of Carrol Cove by draining the pond. The attempt failed.

Red Bay has been designated a National Historic Site of Canada since 1979, and since 2013 it is one of Canada&#x27;s UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

In 2016, the Google Street View imaging service uploaded images of Red Bay. Red Bay is one of the few communities in Labrador with images on the service.

In 2021, the local school, Basque Memorial School closed due to no enrollment.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Red Bay had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

<doc id="1343329" wikidata="Q816522" url="?curid=1343329" title="Ben Hur (1907 film)">
<text>Ben Hur is a 1907 American silent drama film set in ancient Rome, the first screen adaptation of Lew Wallace&#x27;s popular 1880 novel &quot;Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ&quot;. Co-directed by Sidney Olcott and Frank Oakes Rose, this &quot;photoplay&quot; was produced by the Kalem Company of New York City, and its scenes, including the climactic chariot race, were filmed in the city&#x27;s borough of Brooklyn.

While this film is significant for being the first motion-picture adaptation of Wallace&#x27;s novel, its production also served as a landmark case of copyright infringement by an early American film studio. In 1908 Kalem was successfully sued for representing parts of Wallace&#x27;s book on screen without obtaining permission from the author&#x27;s estate. Copies of the film, which survive, are now in the public domain and are readily available for free viewing online in the collections of various digital archives and on streaming services.

==Plot==

With an original total running time of just 15 minutes, Kalem&#x27;s &quot;Roman Spectacle&quot; only highlights some of the principal events described in the novel, although notably excluding Judah Ben-Hur&#x27;s encounters with Jesus Christ or his presence at Christ&#x27;s crucifixion. The film company in its advertising in 1907 describes the release being composed of &quot;Sixteen Magnificent Scenes&quot; with intertitles introducing screen presentations such as &quot;Jerusalem Rebels Against Roman Mis-rule&quot;, &quot;The Family of Hur&quot;, &quot;Ben Hur in Chains to the Galleys&quot;, and &quot;Ben Hur and Messala—The Challenge&quot;.

A significant portion of the film&#x27;s latter content is devoted to portraying the story&#x27;s chariot race. Just four chariots, including those driven by Ben-Hur and Messala, are depicted, with each being drawn by teams of four black horses. Virtually all of the contest&#x27;s action is implied visually, occurring off-camera, and not shown to viewers of the film. Roman spectators on screen cheer as they pretend to watch the charioteers racing three laps around the track of the Circus Maximus. Only brief footage shows the contestants speeding by the static camera as their vehicles are supposedly completing each of the laps. After Judah wins the race against Messala and the two other competitors, the intertitle &quot;Ben Hur Victor&quot; appears. The film then ends with spectators continuing to cheer; Judah being awarded a laurel wreath by the emperor; and Messala, who was injured during the race, lying on a stretcher and gesturing toward his former friend.

== Cast ==
* Herman Rottjer as &quot;Chief Chariotier&quot; and possibly as Judah Ben-Hur
* William S. Hart as Messala (uncredited and unverified involvement in film)
* Gene Gauntier in unverified role 
* Harry T. Morey in unverified role
* Beal (or Peal), Sheridan, and Matler as other &quot;Drivers&quot; in chariot race

==Production==
The production was directed principally by Sidney Olcott with assistance from Frank Oakes Rose, a stage manager with Henry J. Pain&#x27;s Fireworks Company, an entertainment business at Manhattan Beach in Brooklyn, New York. Filmed outdoors in the October 1907, the project was shot in just four days with the production crew mindful that the region&#x27;s &quot;fall rains might begin at any time&quot;.

===The lead actors===

Actor William S. Hart, who would later become the silent era&#x27;s foremost star of &quot;cowboy pictures&quot;, allegedly reprised his role as Messala in Kalem&#x27;s production, having already played the part on stage in the highly successful Broadway production of &quot;Ben Hur&quot;, which ran for 194 performances between late November 1899 and May 1900. His participation in this film, however, remains unverified from period records and is therefore suspect as fact. It appears that Hart&#x27;s well-documented work in the earlier Broadway adaptation of Wallace&#x27;s novel became erroneously linked to the 1907 short. If Hart were indeed cast in the film, it is surprising that Kalem in its advertising did not widely promote the presence of an established Broadway actor in the motion picture, especially a veteran of a &quot;Ben Hur&quot; production in the &quot;legitimate&quot; theatre.

With regard to the identity of the actor who performed in the film&#x27;s title role, misinformation and confusion also persist in modern sources. Many of those sources cite a professional film actor, &quot;Herman Rottger&quot;, as Ben-Hur in Kalem’s production. Actually, only one verified cast member in the 1907 production, one who possessed a nearly identical name—&quot;Herman Rottjer&quot;—was an employee with Pain&#x27;s Fireworks Company. That entertainment company on summer nights since 1879 had staged for audiences at a &quot;massive outdoor stadium and lake at Manhattan Beach&quot; spectacular pyrotechnic displays to simulate famous battles, revolutions, historic fires, and natural disasters such as the volcanic eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD and its destruction of the Roman town of Pompeii. In the early 1900s, Pain&#x27;s live pyrodramas included elaborate sets of Roman architecture and staged chariot races.

In Kalem’s large advertisement for &quot;Ben Hur&quot; in the December 7, 1907 issue of the trade journal &quot;The Moving Picture World&quot;, the studio credits Rottjer as the &quot;Chief Chariotier&quot; in the film. That credit certainly suggests Rottjer, who was 29 years old at the time, had considerable experience driving Pain&#x27;s replicas of the two-wheeled ancient vehicles, along with experience performing in Pain&#x27;s summer Vesuvius-Pompeii shows and in other grand productions staged by the company. His chariot and show experience made him an ideal choice to act or &quot;pantomime&quot; in the role of the lead character in Kalem&#x27;s short. Although Rottjer would continue to work for Pain&#x27;s for several years after the film&#x27;s release, he would later establish a career in the film industry. Federal census records show that in 1910 the German-born Rottjer continued to reside in Brooklyn with his wife and three daughters and was still employed at the local &quot;Firework Plant&quot;, presumably Pain&#x27;s; however, by 1917 he was working as an &quot;explosion expert&quot; in Brooklyn for Vitagraph Studios, which that year purchased Kalem Company. Contrary to information given in other sources, Rottjer did not die in 1917. Later census records further document that by 1920 he had moved with his family to Hempstead in Nassau County, New York, but he was still employed in the motion-picture industry as a &quot;Pyrotechnical&quot; specialist.

===Filming at Sheepshead Bay Race Track===
Although Kalem initially planned to use props and &quot;standing scenery&quot; from Pain&#x27;s, the studio acquired most of its production needs elsewhere and opted, perhaps due to budget and scheduling constraints, to film the project&#x27;s chariot race and other scenes at the Sheepshead Bay Race Track, which was located close to Manhattan Beach. The track by October 1907 was closed for the season and was immediately available for Kalem to use. The film&#x27;s credited screenwriter or &quot;scenarist&quot;, Gene Gauntier, described the film&#x27;s setup in her series of autobiographical articles for &quot;Woman&#x27;s Home Companion&quot; in 1928:

To enhance the status of &quot;The Most Superb Motion Picture Spectacle Ever Produced in America&quot;, Kalem would later state in its advertisements that the film&#x27;s costumes were from the wardrobe collection of the Metropolitan Opera House on 39th Street in New York. In reality, the &quot;Elliott&#x27;s&quot; screenwriter Gauntier identifies as the source for the cast&#x27;s attire, was Gus Elliott, an &quot;old German&quot; prop and costume supplier, whose business was located at St. Mark&#x27;s Place in Manhattan.

===Chariot race===
While Rottjer was credited as the film&#x27;s &quot;Chief Chariotier&quot; and likely drove Ben-Hur&#x27;s chariot in the staged race at Sheepshead, the other charioteers were off-duty soldiers of Brooklyn&#x27;s &quot;3rd Battery&quot; of the National Guard. Members of that local military unit were well known for their expertise in horsemanship. As a testament to their equine abilities, soldiers of Brooklyn&#x27;s Third Battery in August 1908 would later set a world record for &quot;military endurance&quot; by riding 50 miles from Nanuet, New York to Brooklyn in just six hours, much of the time traveling at night and over mountain roads. Pain&#x27;s Fireworks Company provided the chariots driven by Rottjer and the guardsmen, along with some other props and related gear.

==Release and reception==
Released on December 7, 1907, the film received positive reviews and comments in publications around the United States. The New York-based trade journal &quot;The Moving Picture World&quot; announced in its issue that day, &quot;The Kalem Company this week put on the market the Roman spectacular subject, &#x27;Ben Hur&#x27;.&quot; In Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on February 16, 1908, the city&#x27;s &quot;Gazette Times&quot; reported on the presentation of &quot;Ben Hur&quot; at a new local theater, a showing enhanced by actors on site who performed sound effects and spoke dialog generally synchronized with the footage projected on screen:
&quot;The Moving Picture World&quot; in February 1908 also updated its readers on audience reactions to Kalem&#x27;s release. &quot;&#x27;Ben Hur&#x27;&quot;, reported the trade journal, &quot;drew such crowds to a theater in Atlanta, Ga., that the police had to aid in clearing the aisles and lobby.&quot; Later in the month the film-industry publication added, &quot;A Western newspaper in commenting on a local show refers to &#x27;Ben Hur&#x27; as &#x27;a wonderfully realistic and pleasing presentation of Lew Wallace&#x27;s famous story and a triumph of the kinetoscopic art.&#x27;&quot;

==Copyright infringement==

In addition to being the first screen adaptation of Lew Wallace&#x27;s novel, the production is noteworthy in film history as well for establishing precedent in copyright law in the United States. The motion picture was released nearly three years after Wallace&#x27;s death, but it was produced by Kalem without the permission of the author&#x27;s estate. Former Kalem screenwriter Gauntier remarked in her previously cited 1928 autobiography that in the early silent era it was a common practice for studios to ignore copyrights and dismiss any proprietary rights of original authors or creators of intellectual properties.

On March 20, 1908–14 weeks after the release of &quot;Ben Hur&quot;—the publishing house Harper &amp; Brothers, stage producers Klaw and Erlanger, and the author&#x27;s estate filed a joint copyright-infringement lawsuit against the Kalem Company as well as against the Kleine Optical Company, which had produced the copies of the film for Kalem&#x27;s distributors. The case was initially decided against Kalem, the primary defendant, in May 1908. Three and a half years later, on appeal to the United States Supreme Court, justices in the case &quot;Kalem Co. v. Harper Bros.&quot; issued their final ruling against the film company. That ruling on November 13, 1911 established the precedent that all motion picture production companies must first secure the film rights of any previously published work still under copyright before commissioning a screenplay based on that work. Ultimately, Kalem was required to pay the plaintiffs $25,000 ($ today) as well as all related court costs for the case. Earlier, in 1908, perhaps seeking to capitalize on the growing publicity of its case against Kalem and the release of the film, Harper &amp; Brothers published the lavishly designed illustrated book &quot;The Chariot Race from Ben-Hur by Lew Wallace&quot;, which highlights only that event from the novel. Complementing the book&#x27;s text are color illustrations by Ukrainian artist Sigismond Ivanowski.

==Surviving copies of the film==

Kalem&#x27;s losses in copyright litigation and the related court injunctions limiting and then preventing presentations of the company&#x27;s short, the film &quot;for the most part disappeared&quot;. For many years, even the Library of Congress did not possess a full copy of the 1907 release, but that federal institution, the Museum of Modern Art, and other repositories later located and acquired prints. Now in the public domain, additional full and partial copies of Kalem&#x27;s &quot;Ben Hur&quot; are available for public viewing on online streaming services such as YouTube.

Before court-ordered injunctions and the final copyright-infringement rulings against Kalem were effectively enforced, copies of &quot;Ben Hur&quot; circulated in Europe as well as the United States. Various distributors at the time offered to sell both standard &quot;plain stock&quot; copies as well as hand-colored prints of the 1000-foot reel, which consists of approximately 16,000 individual frames. One American film-supply catalog in 1908 offered black-and-white prints of &quot;Ben Hur&quot; for $120 ($ USD today). Color versions produced in France, painted by hand in Paris, sold for an additional $150, costing $270 per copy ($ today) or 15 cents more per foot in 1908. No copies or fragments of the hand-tinted version of the film are currently known to exist.

<text>Rocheport, also known as Rocheport Historic District, is a historic district in Rocheport, Missouri. It dates from 1830.

Rocheport was a trading post for both settlers and Native Americans. After the purchase of the Louisiana Territory in 1803, President Thomas Jefferson commissioned Meriwether Lewis and William Clark to lead an expedition to explore the western territories. On June 7, 1804, their journey led them to the convergence of the Missouri River and Moniteau Creek near the future settlement of Rocheport. Clark noted the features of the land, flora, fauna and native pictographs on the Moniteau Bluffs in his journal. Rocheport became a permanent settlement in the early 19th century.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.

<text>John Joseph McCarthy (born 1953) is an American linguist and the Provost and Senior Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs at the University of Massachusetts Amherst since July 2017. In July 2018, he assumed office as the Provost.

McCarthy is best-known for his work on Optimality Theory in phonology: with Alan Prince, he devised Correspondence Theory and alignment constraints, although he has subsequently renounced the latter. He has since written textbooks like &quot;Doing Optimality Theory: Applying Theory to Data&quot;. Earlier in his career, McCarthy was responsible, along with Prince, for extending autosegmental phonology, and later Optimality Theory, to morphology, in particular to solve the problem of nonconcatenative morphology in Semitic languages.

==Career==
HHe completed his A.B. in linguistics and Near Eastern languages at Harvard College and obtained his Ph.D. from MIT in 1979. He was a professor at the University of Texas at Austin and a visiting scientist at Bell Labs before moving to the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

<doc id="1343342" wikidata="Q180098" url="?curid=1343342" title="Ben-Hur (1959 film)">
<text>Ben-Hur is a 1959 American religious epic film directed by William Wyler, produced by Sam Zimbalist, and starring Charlton Heston as the title character. A remake of the 1925 silent film with a similar title, it was adapted from Lew Wallace&#x27;s 1880 novel &quot;Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ&quot;. The screenplay is credited to Karl Tunberg, but includes contributions from Maxwell Anderson, S. N. Behrman, Gore Vidal, and Christopher Fry. The cast also features Stephen Boyd, Jack Hawkins, Haya Harareet, Hugh Griffith, Martha Scott, Cathy O&#x27;Donnell, and Sam Jaffe.

&quot;Ben-Hur&quot; had the largest budget ($15.175 million), as well as the largest sets built, of any film produced at the time. Costume designer Elizabeth Haffenden oversaw a staff of 100 wardrobe fabricators to make the costumes, and a workshop employing 200 artists and workmen provided the hundreds of friezes and statues needed in the film. Filming commenced on May 18, 1958, and wrapped on January 7, 1959, with shooting lasting for 12 to 14 hours a day and six days a week. Pre-production began in Italy at Cinecittà around October 1957, and post-production took six months. Under cinematographer Robert L. Surtees, executives at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer made the decision to produce the film in a widescreen format. Over 200 camels and 2,500 horses were used in the shooting of the film, with some 10,000 extras. The sea battle was filmed using miniatures in a huge tank on the back lot at the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios in Culver City, California. The nine-minute chariot race has become one of cinema&#x27;s most famous action sequences, and the score, composed and conducted by Miklós Rózsa, was at the time the longest ever composed for a film, and was highly influential on cinema for over 15 years.

Following a $14.7 million marketing effort, &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; premiered at Loew&#x27;s State Theatre in New York City on November 18, 1959. It was the fastest-grossing as well as the highest-grossing film of 1959, becoming the second highest-grossing film in history at the time, after &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;. It won a record eleven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director (Wyler), Best Actor in a Leading Role (Heston), Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Griffith), and Best Cinematography – Color (Surtees); it also won Golden Globe Awards for Best Motion Picture – Drama, Best Director, and Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture for Stephen Boyd. In 1998, the American Film Institute named it the 72nd best American film and the second best American epic film in the AFI&#x27;s 10 Top 10. In 2004, the National Film Preservation Board selected &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; for preservation by the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==

In A.D. 26 Jerusalem, Judah Ben-Hur, a wealthy Jewish prince and merchant, lives with his mother, Miriam, and younger sister, Tirzah. The family&#x27;s steward, Simonides, has a daughter named Esther. Judah grants Simonides&#x27; request for Esther to marry a freeman and grants Esther her freedom as a wedding gift. Apart since childhood, Judah and Esther quickly fall in love.

Judah&#x27;s Roman childhood friend, Messala, returns to Jerusalem as commander of the Fortress Antonia. He fully embraces Rome&#x27;s glory and imperial power while Judah remains devoted to his faith and the Jewish people&#x27;s freedom. When Messala demands that Judah surrender potential rebels to Roman authorities, Judah refuses and cuts all ties.

The new Judean governor&#x27;s procession enters the city. As Judah and Tirzah watch from the upper terrace, loose roof tiles fall, spooking the governor&#x27;s horse and throwing him off. Messala realizes it was accidental but condemns Judah to the galleys and imprisons Miriam and Tirzah. Messala also arrests Simonides. While he and other prisoners are transported, they stop in Nazareth. Denied water, Judah collapses but is revived when a carpenter gives him a drink.

After three years in the galleys, Judah is assigned to Roman Consul Quintus Arrius&#x27; flagship. Arrius notices Judah&#x27;s determination and self-discipline and offers to train him as a gladiator or charioteer, which Judah refuses. When Macedonian pirates attack the Roman fleet, Arrius orders that Judah be unchained. The ship&#x27;s hull is rammed, flooding the galley. Judah frees the other rowers and then rescues Arrius, who was thrown overboard. After being rescued, Arrius learns the battle was won. He later petitions Emperor Tiberius to free Judah, and adopts him as his son. In Rome, Judah becomes a champion charioteer.

While returning to Judea, Judah meets Balthasar and Arab Sheik Ilderim. Seeing Judah&#x27;s prowess as a charioteer, the sheik asks him to drive his four horses in a race before the new Judean governor, Pontius Pilate. Judah declines, despite knowing that Messala is competing. Balthasar tells Judah about a prophet he seeks who preaches love and forgiveness and urges Judah to cast off his consuming hate and vengeance.

Judah returns to Jerusalem to search for his mother and sister. At his abandoned house, he finds Esther, who never married, living with her debilitated father and also Malluch, a mute former prisoner. Messala tortured Simonides, who has protected Judah&#x27;s fortune nonetheless. Presenting himself as Quintus Arrius&#x27; son, Judah confronts Messala and demands to know Miriam and Tirzah&#x27;s fates. Messala orders their release from the dungeons. Both are now lepers and secretly expelled to the Valley of the Lepers. Before leaving the city, the women find and beg Esther to conceal their condition from Judah. Esther tells Judah they are dead to stop him searching.

Seeking revenge, Judah agrees to drive Sheik Ilderim&#x27;s four horses against Messala in the chariot race. The sheik goads Messala into making an enormous wager on himself before revealing Judah is his driver. During the race, Messala drives a &quot;beaked chariot&quot;, having cutters on the wheel hubs to disable competitors. He attempts to destroy Judah&#x27;s chariot but wrecks his own instead. Dragged behind his horses, he is trampled by another chariot, while Judah wins the race. Before dying, Messala tells Judah his mother and sister are alive in the Valley of the Lepers.

At the leper colony, Judah encounters Esther and Malluch bringing supplies to Miriam and Tirzah. Esther persuades him to conceal himself as his family would wish. She then follows a crowd and Balthasar to hear what is possibly Jesus Christ&#x27;s Sermon on the Mount.

Judah meets with Pontius Pilate, who fears Judah&#x27;s victory will stoke rebellion against Roman rule. Judah rejects his patrimony and Roman citizenship. Returning to the leper colony, he reveals himself to Miriam and finds that Tirzah is dying. Judah and Esther take them to see Jesus Christ, but the trial of Jesus has begun. While carrying his cross through the streets, Jesus collapses. Judah recognizes him as the man who gave him water earlier and tries to give him water but a Roman soldier intervenes.

As Judah and Balthasar witness Jesus&#x27; crucifixion, Miriam and Tirzah are sheltered in a cave with Esther during a violent storm and are miraculously cured. Realizing that forgiveness is better than revenge, Judah returns to his house and finds them healed. Embracing, the four rejoice at the miracle.

==Production==


Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) originally announced a remake of the 1925 silent film &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; in December 1952, ostensibly as a way to spend its Italian assets. Stewart Granger and Robert Taylor were reported to be in the running for the lead. Nine months later, MGM announced it would make the film in CinemaScope, with shooting beginning in 1954. In November 1953, MGM announced it had assigned producer Sam Zimbalist to the picture and hired screenwriter Karl Tunberg to write it. Sidney Franklin was scheduled to direct, with Marlon Brando intended for the lead. In September 1955, Zimbalist, who continued to claim that Tunberg&#x27;s script was complete, announced that a $7 million, six- to seven- month production would begin in April 1956 in either Israel or Egypt in MGM&#x27;s new 65mm widescreen process, MGM Camera 65. MGM, however, suspended production in early 1956, following Franklin&#x27;s resignation.

By the late 1950s, the consent decree of 1948 forcing film studios to divest themselves of theater chains and the competitive pressure of television had caused significant financial distress at MGM. In a gamble to save the studio, and inspired by the success of Paramount Pictures&#x27; 1956 Biblical epic &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot;, studio head Joseph Vogel announced in 1957 that MGM would again move forward on a remake of &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;. Filming started in May 1958 and wrapped in January 1959, and post-production took six months. Although the budget for &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; was initially $7 million, it was reported to be $10 million by February 1958, reaching $15.175 million by the time shooting began—making it the costliest film ever produced up to that time. When adjusted for inflation, the budget of &quot;Ben Hur&quot; was approximately $ in constant dollars.

One notable change in the film involved the opening titles. Concerned that a roaring Leo the Lion (the MGM mascot) would create the wrong mood for the sensitive and sacred nativity scene, Wyler received permission to replace the traditional logo with one in which Leo the Lion is quiet. 

===Development===
Lew Wallace&#x27;s 1880 novel, &quot;Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ&quot;, ran to about 550 pages. Zimbalist hired a number of screenwriters to cut the story down and turn the novel into a script. According to Gore Vidal, more than 12 versions of the script had been written by various writers by the spring of 1958. Vidal himself had been asked to write a version of the script in 1957, refused, and been placed on suspension for his decision. According to Vidal, Karl Tunberg was one of the last writers to work on the script. Other sources place Tunberg&#x27;s initial involvement much earlier. Tunberg cut out everything in the book after the crucifixion of Jesus, omitted the sub-plot in which Ben-Hur fakes his death and raises a Jewish army to overthrow the Romans, and altered the manner in which the leperous women are healed. According to Wyler, Vidal, their biographers (see bibliography below) and the sources that follow them, Zimbalist was unhappy with Tunberg&#x27;s script, considering it to be &quot;pedestrian&quot; and &quot;unshootable&quot;.

The writing effort changed direction when director Sidney Franklin fell ill and was removed from the production. Zimbalist offered the project to William Wyler, who had been one of 30 assistant directors on the 1925 film, in early 1957. Wyler initially rejected it, considering the quality of the script to be &quot;very primitive, elementary&quot; and no better than hack work. Zimbalist showed Wyler some preliminary storyboards for the chariot race and informed him that MGM would be willing to spend up to $10 million, and as a result, Wyler began to express an interest in the picture. MGM permitted Wyler to start casting, and in April 1957, mainstream media outlets reported that Wyler was giving screen tests to Italian leading men, such as Cesare Danova.

Wyler did not formally agree to direct the film until September 1957, and MGM did not announce his hiring until January 3, 1958. Even though he still lacked a leading man, Wyler took the assignment for many reasons: He was promised a base salary of $350,000 as well as 8 percent of the gross box office (or 3 percent of the net profits, whichever was greater), and he wanted to work in Rome again (in Hollywood on the Tiber, where he had filmed &quot;Roman Holiday&quot;). His base salary was, at the time, the largest ever paid to a director for a single film. Professional competitive reasons also played a role in his decision to direct, and Wyler later admitted that he wished to outdo Cecil B. DeMille, and make a &quot;thinking man&#x27;s&quot; Biblical epic. In later years, William Wyler would joke that it took a Jew to make a good film about Christ.

===Writing===
Wyler felt Tunberg&#x27;s draft was too much of a morality play overlaid with current Western political overtones, and that the dialogue was too modern-sounding. Zimbalist brought in playwright S. N. Behrman (who also wrote the script for &quot;Quo Vadis&quot;) and then playwright Maxwell Anderson to write drafts. Gore Vidal biographer Fred Kaplan states that British poet and playwright Christopher Fry was hired simultaneously with Vidal, although most sources (including Vidal himself) state that Vidal followed Anderson, and that Fry did not come aboard until Vidal was close to leaving the picture. Vidal arrived in Rome in early March 1958 to meet with Wyler. Vidal claimed that Wyler had not read the script, and that when he did so (at Vidal&#x27;s urging) on his flight from the U.S. to Italy, he was upset with the modernist dialogue. Vidal agreed to work on the script for three months so that he would come off suspension and fulfill his contract with MGM, although Zimbalist pushed him to stay throughout the entire production. Vidal was researching a book on the 4th century Roman emperor Julian and knew a great deal about ancient Rome. That book was eventually published in 1964 under the title &quot;Julian&quot;.

Vidal&#x27;s working style was to finish a scene and review it with Zimbalist. Once Vidal and Zimbalist had come to agreement, the scene would be passed to Wyler. Vidal said he kept the structure of the Tunberg/Behrman/Anderson script, but rewrote nearly all the dialogue. Vidal admitted to William Morris in March 1959 that Fry rewrote as much as a third of the dialogue which Vidal had added to the first half of the script. Vidal made one structural change which was not revised, however. The Tunberg script had Ben-Hur and Messala reuniting and falling out in a single scene. Vidal broke the scene in two, so that the men first reunite at the Castle Antonia and then later argue and end their friendship at Ben-Hur&#x27;s home. Vidal also added small character touches to the script, such as Messala&#x27;s purchase of a brooch for Tirzah and Ben-Hur&#x27;s purchase of a horse for Messala. Vidal claimed that he worked on the first half of the script (everything up to the chariot race), and scripted 10 versions of the scene where Ben-Hur confronts Messala and begs for his family&#x27;s freedom.

Vidal&#x27;s claim about a homoerotic subtext is hotly debated. Vidal first made the claim in an interview in the 1995 documentary film &quot;The Celluloid Closet&quot;, and asserted that he persuaded Wyler to direct Stephen Boyd to play the role as if he were a spurned homosexual lover. Vidal said that he believed that Messala&#x27;s vindictiveness could only be motivated by the feeling of rejection that a lover would feel, and claimed to have suggested to Wyler that Stephen Boyd should play the role that way, and that Heston be kept in the dark about the Messala character&#x27;s motivations. Whether Vidal wrote the scene in question or had the acting conversation with Wyler, and whether Wyler shot what Vidal wrote, remain issues of debate. Wyler himself said that he did not remember any conversation about this part of the script or Boyd&#x27;s acting with Gore Vidal, and that he discarded Vidal&#x27;s draft in favor of Fry&#x27;s. Morgan Hudgens, publicity director for the film, however, wrote to Vidal in late May 1958 about the crucial scene, and implied there was a homosexual context: &quot;...  the big cornpone [the crew&#x27;s nickname for Heston] really threw himself into your &#x27;first meeting&#x27; scene yesterday. You should have seen those boys embrace!&quot; Film critic F. X. Feeney, in a comparison of script drafts, concludes that Vidal made significant and extensive contributions to the script.

The final writer on the film was Christopher Fry. Charlton Heston has claimed that Fry was Wyler&#x27;s first choice as screenwriter, but that Zimbalist forced him to use Vidal. Whether Fry worked on the script before Vidal or not, sources agree that Fry arrived in Rome in early May 1958 and spent six days a week on the set, writing and rewriting lines of dialogue as well as entire scenes, until the picture was finished. In particular, Fry gave the dialogue a slightly more formal and archaic tone without making it sound stilted and medieval. A highly publicized bitter dispute later broke out over screenplay credits to the film, involving Wyler, Tunberg, Vidal, Fry and the Screen Writers&#x27; Guild. In 1996, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; published a brief letter from Charlton Heston taking issue with Vidal&#x27;s version which, he wrote, &quot;irritates the hell out of me&quot;. Three months later, the paper published a 1,200 word response from Vidal, which included the statement that, with regard to the controversial scene&#x27;s subtext, he had been delegated to inform Boyd (who was &quot;delighted&quot;), but that Wyler had warned &quot;don&#x27;t tell Chuck because he&#x27;ll fall apart&quot;.

The final script ran to 230 pages. The screenplay differed more from the original novel than did the 1925 silent film version. Some changes made the film&#x27;s storyline more dramatic. The role of Esther was greatly expanded from that of the novel to provide a strong onscreen love interest throughout the film. Other changes included incorporating an admiration for the Jewish culture and people (historical and modern), as well as representing the more pluralistic society of 1950s America rather than the &quot;Christian superiority&quot; view of Wallace&#x27;s novel (though the movie retained a strongly positive religious portrayal of Early Christianity).

===Casting===
MGM opened a casting office in Rome in mid-1957 to select the 50,000 people who would act in minor roles and as extras in the film, and a total of 365 actors had speaking parts in the film, although only 45 of them were considered &quot;principal&quot; performers. In casting, Wyler placed heavy emphasis on characterization rather than looks or acting history. He typically cast the Romans with British actors and the Jews with American actors to help underscore the divide between the two groups. The Romans were the aristocrats in the film, and Wyler believed that American audiences would interpret British accents as patrician.

Several actors were offered the role of Judah Ben-Hur before it was accepted by Charlton Heston. Burt Lancaster stated he turned down the role because he found the script boring and belittling to Christianity. Paul Newman turned it down because he said he didn&#x27;t have the legs to wear a tunic. Marlon Brando, Rock Hudson, Geoffrey Horne, and Leslie Nielsen were also offered the role, as were a number of muscular, handsome Italian actors (many of whom did not speak English). Kirk Douglas was interested in the role, but was turned down in favor of Heston, who was formally cast on January 22, 1958. His salary was $250,000 for 30 weeks, a prorated salary for any time over 30 weeks, and travel expenses for his family.

Stephen Boyd was cast as the antagonist, Messala, on April 13, 1958. William Wyler originally wanted Heston for the role, but sought another actor after he moved Heston into the role of Judah Ben-Hur. Because both Boyd and Heston had blue eyes, Wyler had Boyd outfitted with brown contact lenses as a way of contrasting the two men. Marie Ney was originally cast as Miriam, but was fired after two days of work because she could not cry on cue. Heston says that he was the one who suggested that Wyler cast Martha Scott as Miriam, and she was hired on July 17, 1958. Cathy O&#x27;Donnell was Wyler&#x27;s sister-in-law, and although her career was in decline, Wyler cast her as Tirzah.

More than 30 actresses were considered for the role of Esther. The Israeli actress Haya Harareet, a relative newcomer to film, was cast as Esther on May 16, 1958, after providing a 30-second silent screen test. Wyler had met her at the Cannes Film Festival, where she impressed him with her conversational skills and force of personality. Sam Jaffe was cast as Simonides on April 3, 1958, and Finlay Currie was cast as Balthasar on the same day. Wyler had to persuade Jack Hawkins to appear in the film, because Hawkins was unwilling to act in another epic motion picture so soon after &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot;. Hugh Griffith, who gained acclaim in the post-World War II era in Ealing Studios comedies, was cast as the colorful Sheik Ilderim. The role of Jesus, whose face is never seen, was played by an uncredited Claude Heater, an American opera singer performing with the Vienna State Opera in Rome when he was asked to do a screen test for the film.

Myrna Hansen, who was crowned Miss USA in 1953, was considered for the role of a leper.

===Cinematography===
Robert L. Surtees, who had already filmed several of the most successful epics of the 1950s, was hired as cinematographer for the film. Early on in the film&#x27;s production, Zimbalist and other MGM executives made the decision to film the picture in a widescreen format. Wyler strongly disliked the widescreen format, commenting that &quot;Nothing is &quot;out&quot; of the picture, and you can&#x27;t fill it. You either have a lot of empty space, or you have two people talking and a flock of others surrounding them who have nothing to do with the scene. Your eye just wanders out of curiosity.&quot; The cameras were also quite large, heavy, and difficult and time-consuming to move. To overcome these difficulties, Surtees and Wyler collaborated on using the widescreen lenses, film stocks, and projection technologies to create highly detailed images for the film. Wyler was best known for composition in depth, a visual technique in which people, props, and architecture are not merely composed horizontally but in depth of field as well. He also had a strong preference for long takes, during which his actors could move within this highly detailed space.

The movie was filmed in a process known as &quot;MGM Camera 65&quot;. 1957&#x27;s &quot;Raintree County&quot; was the first MGM film to use the process. The MGM Camera 65 used special 65 mm Eastmancolor film stock with a 2.76:1 aspect ratio. 70 mm anamorphic camera lenses developed by the Mitchell Camera Company were manufactured to specifications submitted by MGM. These lenses squeezed the image down 1.25 times to fit on the image area of the film stock. Because the film could be adapted to the requirements of individual theaters, movie houses did not need to install special, expensive 70 mm projection equipment. Six of the 70 mm lenses, each worth $100,000, were shipped to Rome for use by the production.

===Principal photography===
Pre-production began at Cinecittà Studios around October 1957. The MGM Art Department produced more than 15,000 sketches and drawings of costumes, sets, props, and other items needed for the film (8,000 alone for the costumes); photostatted each item; and cross-referenced and catalogued them for use by the production design team and fabricators. More than a million props were ultimately manufactured. Construction of miniatures for the entrance of Quintus Arrius into Rome and for the sea battle were underway by the end of November 1957. MGM location scouts arrived in Rome to identify shooting locations in August 1957. Location shooting in Africa was actively under consideration, and in mid-January 1958, MGM said that filming in North Africa (later revealed to be Libya) would begin on March 1, 1958, and that 200 camels and 2,500 horses had already been procured for the studio&#x27;s use there. The production was then scheduled to move to Rome on April 1, where Andrew Marton had been hired as second unit director and 72 horses were being trained for the chariot race sequence. However, the Libyan government canceled the production&#x27;s film permit for religious reasons on March 11, 1958, just a week before filming was to have begun. It is unclear whether any second unit filming took place in Israel. A June 8, 1958, report in &quot;The New York Times&quot; said second unit director Andrew Marton had roamed &quot;up and down the countryside&quot; filming footage. However, the American Film Institute claims the filming permit was revoked in Israel for religious reasons as well (although when is not clear), and no footage from the planned location shooting near Jerusalem appeared in the film.

Principal photography began in Rome on May 18, 1958. The script was still unfinished when cinematography began, so that Wyler had only read the first 10 to 12 pages of it. Shooting lasted for 12 to 14 hours a day, six days a week. On Sundays, Wyler would meet with Fry and Zimbalist for story conferences. The pace of the film was so grueling that a doctor was brought onto the set to give a vitamin B complex injection to anyone who requested it (shots which Wyler and his family later suspected may have contained amphetamines). To speed things up, Wyler often kept principal actors on stand-by, in full costume and make-up, so that he could shoot pick-up scenes if the first unit slowed down. Actresses Martha Scott and Cathy O&#x27;Donnell spent almost the entire month of November 1958 in full leprosy make-up and costumes so that Wyler could shoot &quot;leper scenes&quot; when other shots did not go well. Wyler was unhappy with Heston&#x27;s performances, feeling they did not make Judah Ben-Hur a plausible character, and Heston had to reshoot &quot;I&#x27;m a Jew&quot; 16 times. Shooting took nine months, which included three months for the chariot race scene alone. Principal photography ended on January 7, 1959, with filming of the crucifixion scene, which took four days to shoot.

===Production design===
Italy was MGM&#x27;s top choice for hosting the production. However, a number of countries—including France, Mexico, Spain, and the United Kingdom—were also considered. Cinecittà Studios, a very large motion picture production facility constructed in 1937 on the outskirts of Rome, was identified early on as the primary shooting location. Zimbalist hired Wyler&#x27;s long-term production supervisor, Henry Henigson, to oversee the film, and art directors William A. Horning and Edward Carfagno created the overall look of the film, relying on the more than five years of research which had already been completed for the production. A skeleton crew of studio technicians arrived in the summer of 1956 to begin preparing the Cinecittà soundstages and back lot.

The &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; production utilized 300 sets scattered over and nine sound stages. Several sets still standing from &quot;Quo Vadis&quot; in 1951 were refurbished and used for &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;. By the end of the production more than of plaster and of lumber were used. The budget called for more than 100,000 costumes and 1,000 suits of armor to be made, for the hiring of 10,000 extras, and the procurement of hundreds of camels, donkeys, horses, and sheep. Costume designer Elizabeth Haffenden oversaw a staff of 100 wardrobe fabricators who began manufacturing the costumes for the film a year before filming began. Special silk was imported from Thailand, the armor manufactured in West Germany, and the woolens made and embroidered in the United Kingdom and various countries of South America. Many leather goods were hand-tooled in the United Kingdom as well, while Italian shoemakers manufactured the boots and shoes. The lace for costumes came from France, while costume jewelry was purchased in Switzerland. More than of hair were donated by women in the Piedmont region of Italy to make wigs and beards for the production, and of track laid down for the camera dollies. A workshop employing 200 artists and workmen provided the hundreds of friezes and statues needed. The mountain village of Arcinazzo Romano, from Rome, served as a stand-in for the town of Nazareth. Beaches near Anzio were also used, and caves just south of the city served as the leper colony. Some additional desert panoramas were shot in Arizona, and some close-up inserts taken at the MGM Studios, with the final images photographed on February 3, 1958.

The sea battle was one of the first sequences created for the film, filmed using miniatures in a huge tank on the back lot at the MGM Studios in Culver City, California, in November and December 1957. More than 40 miniature ships and two long Roman galleys, each of them seaworthy, were built for the live-action segment. The ships were constructed based on plans found in Italian museums for actual ancient Roman galleys. An artificial lake with equipment capable of generating sea-sized waves was built at the Cinecittà studios to accommodate the galleys. A massive backdrop, wide by high, was painted and erected to hide the city and hills in the background. To make the scene bloodier, Dunning sought out Italian extras who had missing limbs, then had the makeup crews rig them with fake bone and blood to make it appear as if they had lost a hand or leg during the battle. When Dunning edited his own footage later, he made sure that these men were not on screen for so long that audiences would be upset. The above-decks footage was integrated with the miniature work using process shots and traveling mattes.

One of the most lavish sets was the villa of Quintus Arrius, which included 45 working fountains and of pipes. Wealthy citizens and nobles of Rome, who wanted to portray their ancient selves, acted as extras in the villa scenes. To recreate the ancient city streets of Jerusalem, a vast set covering was built, which included a high Jaffa Gate. The sets were so vast and visually exciting that they became a tourist attraction, and various film stars visited during production. The huge sets could be seen from the outskirts of Rome, and MGM estimated that more than 5,000 people were given tours of the sets.

Dismantling the sets cost $125,000. Almost all the filmmaking equipment was turned over to the Italian government, which sold and exported it. MGM turned title to the artificial lake over to Cinecittà. MGM retained control over the costumes and the artificial lake background, which went back to the United States. The chariots were also returned to the U.S., where they were used as promotional props. The life-size galleys and pirate ships were dismantled to prevent them from being used by competing studios. Some of the horses were adopted by the men who trained them, while others were sold. Many of the camels, donkeys, and other exotic animals were sold to circuses and zoos in Europe.

===Editing===
A total of of footage was shot for the film. According to editor John D. Dunning, the first cut of the film was four and a half hours long. William Wyler stated that his goal was to bring the running time down to three and a half hours. The most difficult editing decisions, according to Dunning, came during scenes that involved Jesus Christ, as these contained almost no dialogue and most of the footage was purely reaction shots by actors. Dunning also believed that in the final cut the leper scene was too long and needed trimming. Editing was also complicated by the 70mm footage being printed. Because no editing equipment (such as the Moviola) existed which could handle the 70mm print, the 70mm footage would be reduced to 35mm and then cut. This caused much of the image to be lost. When the film was edited into its final form, it ran 213 minutes and included just of film.

===Musical score===
The film score was composed and conducted by Miklós Rózsa, who had scored &quot;Quo Vadis&quot; and most of MGM&#x27;s historical films of the 1950s. Rózsa researched Greek and Roman music, incorporating this work into his score for authenticity. Rózsa himself directed the 100-piece MGM Symphony Orchestra during the 12 recording sessions (which stretched over 72 hours). The soundtrack was recorded in six-channel stereo. More than three hours of music were composed for the film, and two-and-a-half hours of it were finally used, making it at the time the longest score ever composed for a motion picture. It was finally surpassed in 2021 by the near 4-hour long score of &quot;Zack Snyder&#x27;s Justice League&quot;.

Rózsa won his third Academy Award for his score. Like most film musical soundtracks, it was issued as an album for the public to enjoy as a distinct piece of music. The score was so lengthy that it had to be released in 1959 on three LP records, although a one-LP version with Carlo Savina conducting the Symphony Orchestra of Rome was also issued. In addition, to provide a more &quot;listenable&quot; album, Rózsa arranged his score into a &quot;&quot;Ben-Hur&quot; Suite&quot;, which was released on Lion Records (an MGM subsidiary that issued low-priced records) in 1959. This made the &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; film musical score the first to be released not only in its entirety but also as a separate album.

The &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; score has been considered the best of Rózsa&#x27;s career. The musical soundtrack to &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; remained deeply influential into the mid-1970s, when film music composed by John Williams for films such as &quot;Jaws&quot;, &quot;Star Wars&quot;, and &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; became more popular among composers and film-goers. Rózsa&#x27;s score has since seen several notable re-releases, including by the Nuremberg Symphony Orchestra on Capitol Records in 1967, several of the tracks by the United Kingdom&#x27;s National Philharmonic Orchestra and Chorus on Decca Records in 1977 and a Sony Music reissue as a two-CD set in 1991. In 2012, &quot;Film Score Monthly&quot; WaterTower Music issued a limited edition five-CD set of music from the film. A two-CD set was released by Tadlow Music in 2017 of the complete motion picture score by The City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra and Chorus.

==Chariot race sequence==
The chariot race in &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; was directed by Andrew Marton and Yakima Canutt, filmmakers who often acted as second unit directors on other people&#x27;s films. Each man had an assistant director, who shot additional footage. Among these were Sergio Leone, who was senior assistant director in the second unit and responsible for retakes. William Wyler shot the &quot;pageantry&quot; sequence that occurs before the race, scenes of the jubilant crowd, and the victory scenes after the race concludes. The &quot;pageantry&quot; sequence before the race begins is a shot-by-shot remake of the same sequence from the 1925 silent film version. Knowing that the chariot race would be primarily composed of close-up and medium shots, Wyler added the parade in formation (even though it was not historically accurate) to impress the audience with the grandeur of the arena.

===Set design===
The chariot arena was modelled on a historic circus in Jerusalem. Covering , it was the largest film set ever built at that time. Constructed at a cost of $1 million, it took a thousand workmen more than a year to carve the oval out of a rock quarry. The racetrack featured long straights and five-story-high grandstands. Over of metal tubing were used to erect the grandstands. Matte paintings created the illusion of upper stories of the grandstands and the background mountains. More than of sand were brought in from beaches on the Mediterranean to cover the track. Other elements of the &quot;circus&quot; were also historically accurate. Imperial Roman racecourses featured a raised high &quot;spina&quot; (the center section), &quot;metae&quot; (columnar goalposts at each end of the &quot;spina&quot;), dolphin-shaped lap counters, and &quot;carceres&quot; (the columned building in the rear which housed the cells where horses waited prior to the race). The four statues atop the &quot;spina&quot; were high. A chariot track identical in size was constructed next to the set and used to train the horses and lay out camera shots.

===Preparation===
Planning for the chariot race took nearly a year to complete. Seventy-eight horses were bought and imported from Yugoslavia and Sicily in November 1957, exercised into peak physical condition, and trained by Hollywood animal handler Glenn Randall to pull the &quot;quadriga&quot; (a Roman Empire chariot drawn by four horses abreast). Andalusian horses played Ben-Hur&#x27;s Arabians, while the others in the chariot race were primarily Lipizzans. A veterinarian, a harness maker, and 20 stable boys were employed to care for the horses and ensure they were outfitted for racing each day. The firm of Danesi Brothers built 18 chariots, nine of which were used for practice, each weighing . Principal cast members, stand-ins, and stunt people made 100 practice laps of the arena in preparation for shooting.

Heston and Boyd both had to learn how to drive a chariot. Heston, an experienced horseman, took daily three-hour lessons in chariot driving after he arrived in Rome and picked up the skill quickly. Heston was outfitted with special contact lenses to prevent the grit kicked up during the race from injuring his eyes. For the other charioteers, six actors with extensive experience with horses were flown in from Hollywood, including Giuseppe Tosi, who had once been a bodyguard for Victor Emmanuel III of Italy.

===Filming===
The chariot scene took five weeks (spread over three months) to film at a total cost of $1 million and required more than of racing to complete. Marton and Yakima Canutt filmed the entire chariot sequence with stunt doubles in long shot, edited the footage together, and showed the footage to Zimbalist, Wyler, and Heston to show them what the race should look like and to indicate where close-up shots with Heston and Boyd should go. Seven thousand extras were hired to cheer in the stands. Economic conditions in Italy were poor at the time, and as shooting for the chariot scene wound down, only 1,500 extras were needed on any given day. On June 6, 1958, more than 3,000 people seeking work were turned away. The crowd rioted, throwing stones and assaulting the set&#x27;s gates until police arrived and dispersed them. Dynamite charges were used to show the chariot wheels and axles splintering from the effects of Messala&#x27;s barbed-wheel attacks. Three lifelike dummies were placed at key points in the race to give the appearance of men being run over by chariots.

The cameras used during the chariot race also presented problems. The 70mm lenses had a minimum focusing distance of , and the camera was mounted on a small Italian-made car so the camera crew could keep in front of the chariots. The horses, however, accelerated down the straight much faster than the car could, and the long focal length left Marton and Canutt with too little time to get their shots. The production company purchased a more powerful American car, but the horses were still too fast, and even with a head start, the filmmakers only had a few more seconds of shot time. As filming progressed, vast amounts of footage were shot for this sequence. The ratio of footage shot to footage used was 263:1, one of the highest ratios ever for a film.

One of the most notable moments in the race came from a near-fatal accident when stunt man Joe Canutt, Yakima Canutt&#x27;s son, was tossed into the air by accident; he incurred a minor chin injury. Marton wanted to keep the shot, but Zimbalist felt the footage was unusable. Marton conceived the idea of showing that Ben-Hur was able to land on and cling to the front of his chariot, then scramble back into the &quot;quadriga&quot; while the horses kept going. The long shot of Canutt&#x27;s accident was cut together with a close-up of Heston climbing back aboard, resulting in one of the race&#x27;s most memorable moments. Boyd did all but two of his own stunts. For the sequence where Messala is dragged beneath a chariot&#x27;s horses and trampled, Boyd wore steel armor under his costume and acted out the close-up shot and the shot of him on his back, attempting to climb up into the horses&#x27; harness to escape injury. A dummy was used to obtain the trampling shot in this sequence.

Several urban legends exist regarding the chariot sequence. One claims that a stuntman died during filming, which Nosher Powell claims in his autobiography, and another states that a red Ferrari can be seen during the chariot race. The book &quot;Movie Mistakes&quot; claims this is a myth. Heston, in a DVD commentary track for the film, mentions that a third urban legend claims that he wore a wristwatch during the chariot race, but points out that he wore leather bracers up to the elbow.

==Release==
A massive $14.7 million marketing effort helped promote &quot;Ben-Hur.&quot; MGM established a special &quot;Ben-Hur Research Department&quot; which surveyed more than 2,000 high schools in 47 American cities to gauge teenage interest in the film. A high school study guide was also created and distributed. Sindlinger and Company was hired to conduct a nationwide survey to gauge the impact of the marketing campaign. In 1959 and 1960, more than $20 million in candy; children&#x27;s tricycles in the shape of chariots; gowns; hair barrettes; items of jewelry; men&#x27;s ties; bottles of perfume; &quot;Ben-Her&quot; and &quot;Ben-His&quot; towels; toy armor, helmets, and swords; umbrellas; and hardback and paperback versions of the novel (tied to the film with cover art) were sold.

&quot;Ben-Hur&quot; premiered at Loew&#x27;s State Theatre in New York City on November 18, 1959. Present at the premiere were William Wyler, Charlton Heston, Stephen Boyd, Haya Harareet, Martha Scott, Ramon Novarro (who played Judah Ben-Hur in the 1925 silent film version), Spyros Skouras (president of the 20th Century Fox), Barney Balaban (president of Paramount Pictures), Jack L. Warner (president of Warner Bros.), Leonard Goldenson (president of the American Broadcasting Company), Moss Hart (playwright), Robert Kintner (an ABC Television executive), Sidney Kingsley (playwright), and Adolph Zukor (founder of Paramount Pictures).

==Reception==
===Box office===
During its initial release the film earned $33.6 million in North American theater rentals (the distributor&#x27;s share of the box office), generating approximately $74.7 million in box office sales. It was number one at the monthly US box office for six months. Outside of North America, it earned $32.5 million in rentals (about $72.2 million at the box office) for a worldwide total of $66.1 million in rental earnings, roughly equivalent to $146.9 million in box office receipts. It was the fastest-grossing film as well as the highest-grossing film of 1959, in the process becoming the second-highest-grossing film of all-time (at that time) behind &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;. It was the highest-grossing film in Japan at the time earning $2,722,000. &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; saved MGM from financial disaster, making a profit of $20,409,000 on its initial release, and another $10.1 million in profits when re-released in 1969. By 1989, &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; had earned $90 million in worldwide theatrical rentals.

===Critical reception===
&quot;Ben-Hur&quot; received overwhelmingly positive reviews upon its release. Bosley Crowther, writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, called &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; &quot;a remarkably intelligent and engrossing human drama&quot;. While praising the acting and William Wyler&#x27;s &quot;close-to&quot; direction, he also had high praise for the chariot race: &quot;There has seldom been anything in movies to compare with this picture&#x27;s chariot race. It is a stunning complex of mighty setting, thrilling action by horses and men, panoramic observation and overwhelming use of dramatic sound.&quot; Jack Gaver, writing for United Press International, also had praise for the acting, calling it full of &quot;genuine warmth and fervor and finely acted intimate scenes&quot;.

Philip K. Scheuer of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it &quot;magnificent, inspiring, awesome, enthralling, and all the other adjectives you have been reading about it&quot;. He also called the editing &quot;generally expert&quot; although at times abrupt. Ronald Holloway, writing for &quot;Variety&quot;, called &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; &quot;a majestic achievement, representing a superb blending of the motion picture arts by master craftsmen&quot;, and concluded that &quot;&quot;Gone With the Wind&quot;, Metro&#x27;s own champion all-time top grosser, will eventually have to take a back seat&quot;. The chariot race &quot;will probably be preserved in film archives as the finest example of the use of the motion picture camera to record an action sequence. The race, directed by Andrew Marton and Yakima Canutt, represents some 40 minutes of the most hair-raising excitement that film audiences have ever witnessed.&quot;

Crowther felt the film was too long. Scheuer, while generally praising the film, felt that its biggest fault was &quot;overstatement&quot;, and that it hammered home at points long after they had been made. He singled out the galley rowing sequence, Jesus&#x27;s journey to the place of crucifixion, and nearly all the sequences involving the lepers. He also lightly criticized Charlton Heston for being more physically than emotionally compelling. John McCarten of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; was more critical of Heston, writing that he &quot;speaks English as if he&#x27;d learned it from records&quot;. Film critic Dwight Macdonald also was largely negative. He found the film so uninvolving and lengthy that he &quot;felt like a motorist trapped at a railroad crossing while a long freight train slowly trundles by&quot;. British film critic John Pym, writing for &quot;Time Out&quot;, called the film a &quot;four-hour Sunday school lesson&quot;. Many French and American film critics who subscribed to the auteur theory saw the film as confirmation of their belief that William Wyler was &quot;merely a commercial craftsman&quot; rather than a serious artist.

In December 1959, in her review for the London &quot;Sunday Times&quot;, the veteran British film critic Dilys Powell expressed many serious reservations but still lavished praise on the film:
The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 85% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 54 reviews collected, with an average rating of 8.20/10. The critics consensus reads, &quot;Uneven, but in terms of epic scope and grand spectacle, &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; still ranks among Hollywood&#x27;s finest examples of pure entertainment.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 90 out of 100 based on 9 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

The Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa cited this movie as one of his 100 favorite films.

&quot;Ben-Hur&quot; was nominated for 12 Academy Awards and won an unprecedented 11. , only &quot;Titanic&quot; in 1998 and &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot; in 2004 have matched the film&#x27;s wins. The only category that &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; did not win was for Best Adapted Screenplay (losing to &quot;Room at the Top&quot;), and most observers attributed this to the controversy over the writing credit. MGM and Panavision shared a special technical Oscar in March 1960 for developing the Camera 65 photographic process.

&quot;Ben-Hur&quot; also won three Golden Globe Awards – Best Motion Picture – Drama, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture for Stephen Boyd – and received a Special Achievement Award (which went to Andrew Marton for directing the chariot race sequence). Heston was nominated for a Golden Globe in the Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture – Drama category, but did not win. The picture also won the BAFTA Award for Best Film, the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Film, and the Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in a Motion Picture for William Wyler&#x27;s masterful direction.

&quot;Ben-Hur&quot; also appears on several &quot;best of&quot; lists generated by the American Film Institute, an independent non-profit organization created by the National Endowment for the Arts in 1967. The &quot;AFI 100 Years... series&quot; were created by juries consisting of over 1,500 artists, scholars, critics, and historians, with movies selected based on the film&#x27;s popularity over time, historical significance, and cultural impact. &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; appeared at #72 on the 100 Movies, #49 on the 100 Thrills, #21 on the Film Scores, #56 on the 100 Cheers and #2 on the AFI&#x27;s 10 Top 10 Epic film lists. In 2004, the National Film Preservation Board selected &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; for preservation by the National Film Registry for being a &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; motion picture. It was listed as number 491 on Empire&#x27;s 500 Greatest films of all time.

The film was included by the Vatican in a list of important films compiled in 1995, under the category of &quot;Religion&quot;.

===Broadcast===
The film&#x27;s first telecast took place on Sunday, February 14, 1971. In what was a television first for a Hollywood film, it was broadcast over five hours (including commercials) during a single evening by CBS, preempting all of that network&#x27;s regular programming for that one evening. It was watched by 85.82 million people for a 37.1 average rating. It was one of the highest-rated movies ever screened on television at the time (behind the broadcast premieres of &quot;The Birds&quot; and &quot;Bridge on the River Kwai&quot;).

===Home media===
&quot;Ben-Hur&quot; has been released on home video on several occasions. A two-sided single disc widescreen release occurred in the United States on March 13, 2001. This release included several featurettes, including a commentary by Charlton Heston, a making-of documentary (made for a laserdisc release in 1993), screen tests, and a photo gallery. This edition was released soon thereafter as a two-disc set in other countries. The film saw another DVD release on September 13, 2005. This four-disc edition included remastered images and audio, an additional commentary, two additional featurettes, and a complete version of the 1925 silent version of &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;. The film was also separated into two parts, with the first and second discs featuring the first and second halves respectively. A boxed &quot;Deluxe Edition&quot;, issued in the U.S. in 2002, included postcard-sized reprints of lobby cards, postcard-sized black-and-white stills with machine-reproduced autographs of cast members, a matte-framed color image from the film with a 35mm film frame mounted below it, and a reproduction film poster.

In 2011, Warner Home Video released a 50th anniversary edition on Blu-ray Disc and DVD, making it the first home release where the film is present on its original aspect ratio. For this release, the film was completely restored frame by frame from an 8K scan of the original 65mm negative. The restoration cost $1 million, and was one of the highest resolution restorations ever made by Warner Bros. A new musical soundtrack-only option and six new featurettes (one of which was an hour long) were also included.

<doc id="1343345" wikidata="Q11987930" url="?curid=1343345" title="Malcolm Hulke">
<text>Malcolm Ainsworth Hulke (21 November 1924 – 6 July 1979) was a British television writer and author of the industry &quot;bible&quot; &quot;Writing for Television in the 70s&quot;. He is remembered chiefly for his work on the science fiction series &quot;Doctor Who&quot; although he contributed to many popular television series of the era.

==Early life==
Known as &quot;Mac&quot; throughout his life, Hulke was born out of wedlock in 1924 and never knew his father. He later discussed the social stigma of illegitimacy and his personal experiences of it in a 1964 radio documentary and a 1973 op-ed piece in &quot;The Observer&quot;. He lived with his mother, Marian, until her death in 1943 in Cumberland. In 1945 he was conscripted into the Royal Navy. Impressed by the Russian prisoners of War whom he met in Norway and by the Red Army&#x27;s defeat of the Nazis on the Eastern Front, Hulke joined the Communist Party of Great Britain in 1945 and worked briefly as a typist in the party&#x27;s headquarters. He left the party in 1951, objecting to the Soviet Union&#x27;s hostility to Yugoslavia and its line on the Korean War, but soon rejoined, and appears to have remained a member of the party until the early 1960s. His politics remained firmly on the left, and this was reflected in his writings, which often explored anti-authoritarian, environmental, and humanist themes.

In January 2015, Five Leaves Press published a short study of his work, &quot;Doctor Who and the Communist: Malcolm Hulke and his career in television&quot;, written by Michael Herbert. In January 2023 Michael Herbert contributed a chapter on Malcolm Hulke to an anthology of writing on television series in the 1970s, &quot;Survival TV&quot;, edited by Rodney Marshall. Michael Herbert is working on a full length biography of Hulke.

==Career==
Hulke was involved with the socialist Unity Theatre in the 1950s and 1960s, serving as its production manager in the mid-1950s, and wrote a booklet in 1961 celebrating the theatre&#x27;s 25th anniversary. Hulke met writer Eric Paice at Unity and the two wrote as a team for television, beginning in the late 1950s with &quot;This Day in Fear&quot;, which was produced by BBC Television in 1958 as part of its &quot;Television Playwright&quot; anthology series. The pair then wrote four plays for ABC&#x27;s &quot;Armchair Theatre&quot;, produced by future &quot;Doctor Who&quot; creator Sydney Newman. Hulke and Paice also co-wrote two B-movie screenplays, &quot;Life in Danger&quot;, released in 1959 by Butcher&#x27;s Films, and &quot;The Man in the Back Seat&quot;, released in June 1961 by Independent Artists Studio.

In 1960, Newman commissioned Hulke and Paice to write a children&#x27;s science fiction serials for ABC – &quot;Target Luna&quot;. Its success led to Newman hiring them to write three more series: &quot;Pathfinders in Space&quot;, &quot;Pathfinders to Mars&quot;, and &quot;Pathfinders to Venus&quot;.

Newman went on to hire Hulke to write a total of nine episodes of &quot;The Avengers&quot;, four of which he co-wrote with Terrance Dicks, a friend and lodger at the rooming house Hulke managed and whom Hulke recruited as a co-writer when he learned of his desire to break into television.

Newman moved to BBC Television to become its Head of Drama and, in 1964, asked Hulke to write a six part story for a new series Newman had created, &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. The story, &quot;The Hidden Planet&quot;, was about a twin planet of Earth that was hidden on the other side of the Sun. Hulke&#x27;s story was not produced but he went on to write for the series, beginning in 1967.

In addition to the &quot;Pathfinders&quot; series, &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, and &quot;The Avengers&quot;, Hulke contributed scripts to a number of television series in the 1960s and 1970s including &quot;The Protectors&quot;, &quot;GS5&quot;, &quot;The Flying Swan&quot;, &quot;Danger Man&quot;, &quot;Crossroads&quot;, football soap &quot;United!&quot;, &quot;Gideon&#x27;s Way&quot;, and was script editor for &quot;Spyder&#x27;s Web&quot;.

His scripts for &quot;Doctor Who&quot; were known for avoiding black-and-white characterisation and simplistic plotting. Military figures are usually presented unfavourably – &quot;Invasion of the Dinosaurs&quot; and &quot;The Ambassadors of Death&quot; both have a general as the ultimate villain. One of his best-known contributions to the series is &quot;Doctor Who and the Silurians&quot;. This story depicts an encounter between the human race and the remnants of a technological reptilian race that ruled Earth in prehistoric times. Hulke avoids casting either side as heroes or monsters.

He was a friend and mentor to Terrance Dicks, with whom he collaborated in 1962 on &quot;The Avengers&quot; episodes &quot;The Mauritius Penny&quot;, (which was Dicks&#x27; first television credit), &quot;Intercrime&quot;, &quot;Concerto&quot; and &quot;Homicide and Old Lace&quot;; &quot;The War Games&quot;, Dicks&#x27; first &quot;Doctor Who&quot; script, and on the non-fiction book &quot;The Making of Doctor Who&quot;.

He also contributed to Target Books&#x27; range of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novelisations, adapting many of his scripts before his death, as well as 1973&#x27;s &quot;The Green Death&quot;. Hulke&#x27;s novelisations were noted for providing a wealth of additional background detail and character depth. He wrote an influential screenwriting manual, &quot;Writing for television in the 70s&quot; in 1974, and an updated version, &quot;Writing for Television&quot;, which was released posthumously in 1981.

==Death==
Hulke died of cancer on 6 July 1979, aged 54.

==The proposed stories written for &quot;Doctor Who&quot;==
The Hidden Planet

Hulke had submitted this story in January 1964 as a six-part adventure story, and would see the Doctor and his companions land on a parallel planet like Earth, but has clover leaves looking all the same. Women were the dominant race of the planet, whereas men struggle for their own rights. The story was rejected by story editor David Whitaker on 2 February 1964.

The story was resubmitted for Season 2 of the program, as a five-part serial. It was also rejected again by script editor Dennis Spooner in April 1965.

Britain 408 A.D.

This story was submitted for Season Two, but was replaced by The Romans.

The People Who Couldn&#x27;t Remember

Co-written with David Ellis, According to some fan theories, this story was to be a six-part serial. Not much is known about it. This was rejected by script editor Gerry Davis on 15 June 1966.

The Big Store

Co-written with David Ellis, this four-part serial was submitted in November 1966. Only drafts for Episode One were completed. The story would be set in a shopping mall in 1973. Gerry Davis preferred an airport setting. The story was replaced by &quot;The Faceless Ones&quot;.

<doc id="1343352" wikidata="Q3049995" url="?curid=1343352" title="Ben Hur (2003 film)">
<text>Ben Hur is a 2003 American-Canadian animated drama film based on the 1880 novel &quot;Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ&quot;, by Lew Wallace. It is the fourth film adaptation of the novel, the prior three of which were the 1907 silent short film, the 1925 silent film, and the Academy Award-winning 1959 film.

Charlton Heston&#x27;s production company, Agamemnon Films (in association with GoodTimes Entertainment), produced this direct-to-video animated version of the story, with Heston himself reprising his role as the title character. It would prove to be his final film role before his death in 2008.

==Synopsis==
The animated version tells the same story as the 1959 film, with some differences. The story begins with Balthazar waiting in the desert for the two other wise men for a journey to Bethlehem. The story of Ben-Hur begins 30 years after the birth of Jesus.

In contrast to the 1925 and 1959 versions, the face of Jesus is shown and his words are heard in this film.

The character of Messala is different from the 1959 film. Appearing lame, he approaches Ben-Hur for forgiveness, and joins Ben-Hur&#x27;s family and Balthazar to witness the passion of Jesus. Ben-Hur gives water to Jesus on the way to Calvary. As Jesus dies, Ben-Hur and his family, with Balthazar, Messala, and Esther, clasp their hands in prayer. Miracles occur when Jesus heals Ben-Hur&#x27;s family of leprosy, and enables Messala to walk again. He comes near the cross thanking Jesus for the miracle.

At the film&#x27;s end, Mary Magdalene sees Jesus emerge from the tomb and he ascends into heaven, giving the promise to the apostles to preach the gospel. Ben-Hur, now married to Esther, shares with his children his story and faith in Jesus.

==Voice cast==

* Long John Baldry as Balthazer, Roman Captain, Roman Citizen, Leading Soldier, Citizen
* French Tickner as Gaspar, Jewish Man, Doctor
* Dale Wilson as Sheik Ilderim, Angel Gabriel, Scientist

* Michael Dobson as Joseph, Soldier #2
* Lee Tockar as Judas, Shepherd #2, Guard, Slave
* Rob Court as Peter, Man, Leper
* Russell Roberts as Roman Merchant, Archery Instructor
* William Samples as Roman Soldier

==Production==
In June 2002, it was announced Charlton Heston would be playing the titular role of &quot;Ben Hur&quot; in direct-to-video to be distributed by GoodTimes Entertainment having previously played the character in the 1959 film of the same name. The project was put together by Agamemnon Films, the production company of Heston&#x27;s son Fraser Clarke Heston. Production on the film took place from January through August of 2002 utilizing a mixture of traditional animation integrated with CGI elements. The team had previously produced a series of 45 minute direct-to-video projects called &quot;The Greatest Adventure: Stories from the Bible&quot;. The production team made a conscious effort to downplay some of the more overtly Biblical aspects of the story.

<text>Bella Donna Boudreaux is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Scott Lobdel and artist Jim Lee, the character first appeared in &quot;X-Men&quot; (vol. 2) #8 (May 1992). Bella Donna is a member of the Assassins Guild. She has been involved in a star-crossed romance with the superhero Gambit, a member of the Thieves Guild.

==Publication history==
Bella Donna debuted in &quot;X-Men&quot; (vol. 2) #8 (May 1992), created by Scott Lobdel and Jim Lee. She appeared in the 1993 &quot;Gambit&quot; series, the 1994 &quot;Rogue&quot; mini-series, the 2004–2005 &quot;Gambit&quot; series and the 2018 &quot;Mr. &amp; Mrs. X&quot; series.

==Fictional character biography==
Young street-thief Remy LeBeau met Bella Donna Boudreaux when they were only children, and the pair soon became friends. Unbeknownst to them both, they came from rival Guilds (those of Thieves Guild and Assassins Guild, respectively). As they grew up and the rivalry between the Guilds increased, their fathers arranged for a marriage between the two in the hopes that it would unite the Guilds. Immediately after the wedding, Bella Donna&#x27;s brother Julien lashed out in jealousy and challenged Remy in a fight to the death. Remy won, killing Julien. As punishment, Remy was exiled from the New Orleans&#x27; Thieves Guild.

A few years later, Bella Donna sought out Gambit to help fend off the Brood, who were attacking the Guilds. Having persuaded Gambit and the X-Men to come back to New Orleans, they battled the new enemy with the aid of Dan Ketch, the second Ghost Rider. Using her new psychic powers, Bella Donna followed Psylocke into the astral plane and expended her energy, before collapsing in Gambit&#x27;s arms. Believing her dead, he told the Thieves Guild to take care of her, and went off for revenge against the Brood.

As it happened, Bella Donna was not actually dead, but merely in a coma. Gambit risked his life to bring her Candra&#x27;s Elixir of Life. In the meantime, although she was catatonic, Rogue accidentally touched her and she lost her memories. She woke up without any recollection of who she was, or who Remy was, and was taken away by her father.

Bella Donna&#x27;s memory slowly returned, and she felt as if her soul had been violated. Enraged and manipulated by Candra, she had Rogue&#x27;s comatose old boyfriend Cody kidnapped. This led to Rogue trying to rescue Cody in Louisiana. Eventually, Cody loses his life in the fight between Rogue and Candra.

Gambit returned again to New Orleans, ignorant to the multiple hits put up against him in the meantime. Bella Donna herself had taken one of the contracts, though she had no intention of killing him. Instead, she arranged it so that she could meet with him and sort out the conflicting emotions she had about him. After he was elected Viceroy of the Unified Guilds of New Orleans he passed power on to her, and returned to the X-Men. She now rules in his absence, still in love with him.

She briefly entered a relationship with Bandit, a former New Warriors member, eerily reminiscent of Gambit, but Gambit subsequently revealed he was manipulating her.

It has yet to be revealed whether Bella Donna has retained her mutant powers after the events of M-Day.

Bella Donna reappeared, still leading the Assassin&#x27;s Guild. She dispatches a group of super-villain assassins after Domino.

Much later, she clashes with Kaine who takes on the Scarlet Spider identity.

After hearing of Remy and Anna-Marie&#x27;s wedding, Bella paid her ex-fiance a quick visit at the newlywed&#x27;s humble abode right when the Thieves Guild comes crashing into it. Gambit&#x27;s old flame came to warn him that none in the guilds are all too happy with whom he married and now his subordinates are gunning for both his crown and his head. She would opt to keep the sharks in her den off of his back as long as she could, but could make no guarantees due to their rival sects history before bidding farewell.

Ms. Bordeaux would next turn up in the service of Candra once more as she proposed to unite the Thieves &amp; Assassins Guilds in wake of Nate Grey&#x27;s devastation of the X-Men and the mutant population. But found herself on the receiving end of her reborn patron&#x27;s treachery once again when the External offered a choice between her and Rogue as a sacrifice in exchange for power or exile. Gambit would choose neither however and instead opted to free his new wife while working out a new deal between his clan and their mortal enemies while putting his adopted father; Jean-Luc LeBeau in as a regent whom oversees and reports back to him while returning leadership of the Assassins Guild back to Bella Donna, who escorts the scheming patron of her clansmen away while joking of sending the now infantile manipulator to school if she does not behave.

<text>Institute Football Club is a Northern Irish semi-professional association football club playing in the NIFL Championship. The club, founded in 1905, currently play their home matches at the Brandywell Stadium, Derry. Club colours are sky blue and maroon. The club is managed by Kevin Deery.

==History==

===Early years (1905–1912)===
The Presbyterian Working Men&#x27;s Institute founded in 1882 was associated with football as early as 1893, when the North-End Football Club was founded. That club ceased to exist in 1904 and in October 1905, a number of players and supporters of North End Olympic F.C., the junior team of the late club which had folded, conceived the idea of creating a new football team. A meeting was accordingly held in the rooms of the Diamond Hotel, with the late Mr. William Buchanan, acting as chairman. It was thereupon decided to form a Junior football club known as Institute F.C. affiliated with the North West Football Association and to play only friendly matches during the 1905–06 season.

The club played their first ever match (a friendly) against St Columbs Court at Magee College grounds (which the club used as their home pitch for that season), winning the match 2–1. Those who played in this match were: J. Parkhill, D. Patton, Wm. Neely, R.A. Bogle, W. M. Wilton, D. Gillespie, J. Holland, D. McCleery, D. Gilfillan, G. Young, and A. Doherty. Institute arranged many other friendlies during that season and continued to grow in strength.

In the 1906–07 season the club entered the North-West Junior League. Their first ever junior match was a league match away to Farm Wanderers which ended in a 4–4 draw. In the season of 1907–08, Billy Gillespie began playing for the club, and went on to become one of the club&#x27;s greatest ever players. The club won the North-West Charity Cup that season, beating Derry Celtic Wanderers 4–1 in the final, making them the first Junior team ever to win the trophy. Mr William Logue became chairman of the club and remained chairman until the year 1914.

In the 1910–11 season, although the team lost Billy Gillespie to Leeds City, they managed to reach the semi-final of the Irish Junior Cup, in which they were defeated 2–1 by Broadway United at the Brandywell. The 1911–12 season saw the club reach the final of the Irish Junior Cup, narrowly losing out on winning the trophy after a 2–1 defeat by Brantwood at Grosvenor Park, Belfast.

===Intermediate years (1981–1999)===
In 1981 Institute joined the Intermediate League. Their first season in the Intermediate league (the 1981–82 season) turned out to be the club&#x27;s most successful ever in the league. Their first ever intermediate match was a league match against Roe Valley, which they won 8–1. That season they also reached the semi-finals of the Intermediate Cup, where they beat RUC on penalties at the Coleraine Showgrounds, meaning they had earned themselves a place in the first round of the Irish Cup.

They met Chimney Corner in the final, but were beaten 2–0 in an unconvincing performance. Their Irish Cup first round match against Coleraine also ended in defeat, Coleraine winning 2–1.

In 1996 Institute entered the Irish League B Division for the 1996–97 season. They also won the Smirnoff Cup that season, beating Chimney Corner 4–2 in the final. They finished 7th in the league. In the 1998–99 season the club gained promotion to the Irish First Division.

===Senior football, promotions and relegations (1999–2010)===
On 14 August 1999 the club played their first ever match as a senior football team. The match was at home to Bangor in the Irish League First Division and the result was a 3–3 draw which saw Institute come from behind. The first victory of that season was a 1–0 win away to local North-West rivals Limavady United. A visit from Armagh City at the end of the season saw a massive 7–0 victory for Institute, with top scorer Roddy McDowell going down in the record books for scoring the club&#x27;s first ever senior hat-trick (he actually scored four on the day). Institute ended the season in 6th place.

In the 2000–01 season the club finished in the top half of the league, securing 5th place. The following season, the club finished in 2nd place in the First Division, securing promotion to the Irish Premier League. That season saw four players reach 100 appearances for the club, these were Graeme Philson, Adrian Creane, Ryan Coyle and John McGarvey.

The first match of the 2002–03 season was away to Glentoran, which was lost 4–1. That season also spelt the end of Paul Kee&#x27;s 3-year reign as manager, as he left to manage Carlisle United. Despite this, the club won the North-West cup, and finished in 6th place in the league (top half), which is still the club&#x27;s highest ever league placing. In the 2003–04 season the club finished in 11th place in the league, but the 2004–05 season was a slightly more successful one for the club, with a 9th-place finish in the table.

Institute were relegated from the Premier division at the end of the 2005–06 season, after losing out in the promotion/relegation play-off against Donegal Celtic, played due to the club finishing 15th out of 16 in the Premier Division, and Donegal Celtic finishing 2nd in the First Division. The club lost the first leg 3–1 away from home and played out a 0–0 draw in the second leg at home.

In 2006–07 they were winners of the First Division, gaining promotion back to the top flight after only one season. In the 2007–08 season the club managed to avoid relegation, finishing 14th. The following season they finished in 7th place out of 12 clubs (after the league had been reduced from 16 clubs to 12 from the 2008–09 season onwards) and reached the semi-final of the Irish Cup for the first time.

The following season, after finishing last (12th) place in the Premiership, a promotion/relegation play-off – again against Donegal Celtic – would decide whether or not the club would be relegated. They narrowly lost out in this play-off, drawing 0–0 in the first leg away from home, and then losing 1–0 at home to an 85th-minute winner from Donegal Celtic&#x27;s Stephen McAlorum. This meant relegation to IFA Championship 1.

===Return of Paul Kee, promotions and relegations (2010–present)===
2010–11 season was the club&#x27;s first season return in the second tier in 4 years, and saw Paul Kee return to the club, after being appointed as Head of Development near to the end of the season. The club brought home the North West Senior Cup after beating Coleraine 3–1 in the final, and finished in 8th place in the league, having won 6 out of their last 8 league games to ease any relegation fears that there had been before this run of form.

In the 2011–12 season, the club completed a cup double having won the North West Senior Cup for the second successive season, once again beating Coleraine in the final. The result was 4–2 and the match was played at the Riverside Stadium. This was accompanied by great success in the Craig Memorial Cup, lifting the trophy after beating Tobermore United in a penalty shoot-out, when the match ended in a stalemate 1–1 result at Fortwilliam Park. The club finished in 3rd place in Championship 1.

The 2012–13 season included the appointment of Paul Kee as manager and a North West Senior Cup final defeat to Coleraine; 3–0 at the Coleraine Showgrounds. The club finished 3rd in Championship 1 for the second successive season, missing out on the promotion play-off place, finishing 3 points behind league runners-up Warrenpoint Town. The club lifted the Irish Intermediate Cup for the first ever time after defeating Ards Rangers 1–0 in the final with a late winner from Darren McFadden.

Once again the club were promoted to the top tier after being crowned champions of NIFL Championship 1 on the final day of the season, with a 1–1 draw against Harland &amp; Wolff Welders for Bangor meaning the 2–0 win in the North-West derby at home to Limavady United was enough to see the club finish top of the pile for the second time. A successful season, despite an Intermediate Cup semi-final defeat to Armagh City and including another North-West Senior Cup final appearance – ending in a defeat in a penalty shoot-out to Newbuildings United – was enjoyed by the club. A 2014–2015 NIFL Premiership season in which the club were relegated once more after a 12th (bottom) placed finish, also saw a North-West Senior Cup triumph, beating Moyola Park 3–1 in the final at the Riverside Stadium in October 2014. The season&#x27;s end also marked the end of Paul Kee&#x27;s second 4-year stint in charge after being relieved of his duties in April 2015; as well as the resignations of key board members such as chairman Keith McElhinney and vice-chairman Trevor Hewitt.

Kevin Deery was appointed as manager in late May 2015 with former Institute captain Paddy McLaughlin as his new assistant. In the first season under the new management, Institute finished in 6th place in the league but still qualified for the NIFL Premiership promotion/relegation play-off (due to all of the above teams in 2nd–5th place not acquiring a promotion license) in which they lost out 5–4 on aggregate to an injury time winning goal from Ballinamallard United to level the second leg at 3–3. Also knocked out of the league cup at the quarter-final stage in a 2–1 defeat to Warrenpoint Town; as well as a 2–1 Craig Memorial Cup final defeat to rivals Limavady United, the club managed to get success in the Irish Intermediate Cup, defeating league champions Ards 3–1 in the final.

There was a taste of success via the North West Senior Cup in the 2016–17 season, beating Coleraine in the final (1–1 full-time, 4–2 on penalties), however a 5–2 aggregate loss to Carrick Rangers in the NIFL Premiership promotion/relegation play-off final (having beaten Ballyclare Comrades 3–2 on aggregate in the semi-final), coupled with first and sixth round exits from the League Cup and Irish Cup respectively meant it made for a frustrating season overall. Manager Kevin Deery handed in his resignation following the season end, on 20 May 2017, following discussions with chairman Bill Anderson and was replaced by his assistant, and former club captain, Paddy McLaughlin, on 24 May 2017.

In the 2017–18 season, the club won the NIFL Championship and gained promotion to the NIFL Premiership once more. They retained the North West Senior Cup with a 3–1 final victory over Coleraine at the Coleraine Showgrounds, but suffered defeats in the last 16 of both the NIFL League Cup and Irish Cup, in what was seen as a fantastic season for the club considering the flooding of their Riverside Stadium home after just one home league game.

The 2018–19 season saw the club finish eighth place in the NIFL Premiership, as well as the departure of manager Paddy McLaughlin, (in February 2019), who left to take the Cliftonville job. The club appointed first team coach Kevin Doherty as caretaker manager until the end of the season, at which point, new manager John Quigg was appointed, on 22 April 2019.

Following the resignation of John Quigg on 3 August 2019 after just two matches in charge; Sean Connor was appointed as first team manager a month later, on 14 September, with the club yet to win a game in the 2019–20 season. In a season which was severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, Institute were relegated following an NIFL decision to go ahead with promotion and relegation, despite the curtailment of the season with 7 matches remaining. The club appealed the decision to no avail; having been bottom of the table, but just 3 points adrift of 11th-placed Warrenpoint Town. Prior to the pandemic, Institute had reached the NIFL League Cup semi-final for the first time in the history of the club, where a 2–0 defeat to Crusaders was the result.

Following a season without football below NIFL Premiership level in Northern Ireland, due to the pandemic; the club returned to playing competitively - now in the NIFL Championship - at the beginning of the 2021–22 season. Three heavy defeats to start the season saw the reign of Sean Connor come to an end on 17 August 2021, with former first team coach and assistant manager; Brian Donaghey appointed as the new manager days later, on 25 August. The season ended with Institute placed 9th, after a disappointing campaign which saw them exit the Irish Cup (to intermediate club Portstewart) and League Cup (due to fielding an ineligible player vs PSNI) both at the earliest hurdle and the North West Senior Cup after a 2-1 semi-final defeat to Ballinamallard United.

The 2022–23 season saw the resignation of manager, Brian Donaghey in April 2023, one game before the season&#x27;s end, where the club finished 11th place in the Championship after a run of just 2 wins from their last 21 matches.
Eddie Seydak oversaw the final league match as caretaker manager before Kevin Deery returned as manager in June 2023.
Deery&#x27;s first season on his return (2023-24), saw a second-placed finish for Institute and a 2-1 aggregate loss to Ballymena United in what was a third NIFL Premiership promotion/relegation play-off with the club, for the manager. The club also suffered a North West Senior Cup final penalty shootout loss to North-West rivals Limavady United and exited the 2023-24 Irish Cup in the quarter-finals.

==Stadium==

The club&#x27;s former home was Riverside Stadium located in Drumahoe, Derry and had a total capacity of 3,110 people with 1,540 seated.

In 1995 it was decided that the club would make plans to develop the ground to meet IFA regulation standard, to gain entry to the Irish League. Plans included new toilet facilities, new changing rooms, facilities for the disabled, purchasing two porter-cabins to use as a club shop and for hospitality, a new security fence to enclose the ground and two new turnstiles resulting in the club&#x27;s entry to the B Division of the Irish League.

In 1998 the club decided to build a 330-seater stand at the south side of the ground. The stand was named &#x27;The Billy Kee Stand&#x27; after their great player. In May 2011, 110 extra seats were added to the Billy Kee stand taking the number of seats to 440. The seats in this stand are blue, yellow, white and black. This stand is allocated to the home fans on match days.

Next they built a 200-seater stand at the north side of the ground. An extra row of 100 seats were added to the stand in May 2011, increasing its capacity to 300 seats. The seats in the stand are blue, yellow, white and black. This is simply known as the &#x27;North Stand&#x27; and is allocated to away fans on a match day.

2008 saw the club build a terraced stand. The stand was named &#x27;The Billy Henderson Stand&#x27; after the club&#x27;s main sponsor. Both home and away fans can stand here on a match day. The two sets of fans are divided/segregated by a metal gate in the stand. The away section of the stand is slightly larger than the home section.

In November 2010 the building of a new 800-seater stand at the east end of the ground began and was fully completed in August 2011. The building of the stand was the main part of a £956,000 project to both increase the capacity (for safety) and also improve the overall facilities at the ground. The major funder of the project was Sport NI with the remainder of the funding coming from the IFA and Derry City Council. The stand also contains extensive toilet facilities and a shop at the back of it, these facilities can be accessed by walking through the tunnel which was built into the middle of the stand.

In 2008, the club improved disabled access at the ground and provided a public address system, additional toilets and emergency lighting. In May 2009 the club installed new floodlights at each corner of the ground. In 2011 – included as part of the project in the building of the East Stand and the increased capacity of the Billy Kee and North stands – additional facilities were added to the ground, including both home and away turnstiles, a control room, CCTV, a media suite, a viewing area at the top of the East Stand, a disabled access lift to the viewing area and various upgrades in the security fencing surrounding the ground.

In December 2015, club chairman Bill Anderson spoke in local newspaper Londonderry Sentinel, about plans for a 4G playing surface within the ground, and asked for the backing of the club&#x27;s supporters and local councillors with the matter of acquiring the appropriate funding required from Northern Irish football&#x27;s governing bodies in order for the plans to proceed.

===Flooding and stadium closure===

Severe flooding through the North-West of Northern Ireland on the evening of 22 August 2017 devastated the club when the ground was destroyed by water reaching as high as 7-foot inside changing rooms and with 5-foot of sediment piled on top of what was left of the playing surface (which would later develop Japanese Knotweed).
The perimeter fence was ripped out and nearby trees were uprooted, some of which were washed onto the pitch.

This meant that the club would have to relocate, at least temporarily, to Wilton Park, home of North-West Junior League club Churchill United, in an agreement to share their ground, for at least the remainder of the season.

Following promotion to the NIFL Premiership, the club entered a ground sharing agreement with Derry City and the Derry City and Strabane District Council for the use of Brandywell Stadium the 2018–19 season as a temporary fix, for a ground capable of meeting the requirements set by the NIFL for a club competing in the top tier.

This agreement was continued into the 2019–20 season and a 5-year plan was put forward by the club, with an aim to relocate to a new purpose-built stadium in the Clooney Park West site, of Derry&#x27;s Waterside area.

In January 2022, the club applied to have the Riverside Stadium demolished. Planning permission was approved in June 2022, with the intention of returning the land to a greenfield site.

===Proposed new stadium===

In 2019, a 5-year plan was put forward by the club, with the aim to relocate to a new purpose-built stadium in the Clooney Park West site, of Derry&#x27;s Waterside area.

In July 2022, chairman Bill Anderson stated that the club aim to get their plans approved by the council and begin plans for moving into a new stadium within 3 seasons.

In January 2023, plans to reuse and repurpose much of the structure of the Riverside Stadium in the new-build stadium were made clear. With some of the bricks, mortar, old seats and stands to be repurposed.

The club were confirmed as the council&#x27;s preferred tenants for the Clooney Park West site in February 2023.

<doc id="1343365" wikidata="Q211475" url="?curid=1343365" title="Stavisky affair">
<text>The Stavisky affair was a financial scandal in France in 1934, involving embezzler Alexandre Stavisky. The scandal had political ramifications for the Radical-Socialist government after it was revealed that Prime Minister Camille Chautemps had protected Stavisky, who died suddenly in mysterious circumstances.

Political rightists engaged in large anti-government demonstrations on 6 February 1934, which resulted in the Paris police firing upon and killing 17 demonstrators. A right-wing &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; seemed like a possibility at the time, but historians agree that the multiple rightist forces were uncoordinated and not trying to overthrow the government.

==Stavisky==
Serge Alexandre Stavisky (1888–1934), who became known as &quot;le beau Sacha&quot; (&quot;Handsome Sasha&quot;), was a Russian Jew who was born in modern-day Ukraine; his parents had relocated to France. Stavisky tried various professions, working as a café singer, a nightclub manager, a soup factory worker and as the operator of a gambling den. During the 1930s, he managed municipal pawnshops in Bayonne and also knew people active in the financial sector. Stavisky sold worthless bonds and financed his &quot;hockshop&quot; on the surety of what he called the emeralds of the late Empress of Germany, which were later revealed to be glass.

Stavisky maintained his reputation by using his acquaintances with important people. If a newspaper tried to investigate his affairs, he paid it to stop either with large advertisement contracts or by buying the newspaper&#x27;s company.

In 1927, Stavisky was put on trial for fraud for the first time. However, the trial was postponed repeatedly, and he was granted bail nineteen times. Stavisky probably continued his scams during that time. One judge who claimed to have secret documents involving Stavisky was later found decapitated. Janet Flanner wrote: 

The scheme which finally killed Alexandre Stavisky, his political guests&#x27; reputations, and the uninvited public&#x27;s peace of mind, was his emission of hundreds of millions of francs&#x27; worth of false bonds on the city of Bayonne&#x27;s municipal pawnshop, which were bought up by life-insurance companies, counseled by the Minister of Colonies, who was counseled by the Minister of Commerce, who was counseled by the Mayor of Bayonne, who was counseled by the little manager of the hockshop, who was counseled by Stavisky.
At the risk of exposure in December 1933, Stavisky fled. On 8 January 1934, the police found him in a chalet in Chamonix; he was dead from a gunshot wound. Stavisky was officially determined to have committed suicide, but there was a persistent speculation that police officers had killed him. Fourteen Parisian newspapers reported his death as a suicide, but eight did not. The distance that the bullet had travelled caused the newspaper &quot;Le Canard enchaîné&quot; to propose sarcastically that Stavisky had &quot;&quot;.

==Political crisis of 6 February 1934==
After Stavisky&#x27;s death, details about his long criminal history, his relations with the French establishment and his controversial death became public. His involvement with so many ministers caused the resignation of Prime Minister Camille Chautemps with accusations from the right-wing opposition that he and his police had killed Stavisky intentionally to protect influential people. The new Prime Minister was Édouard Daladier, and one of his first acts was to dismiss the prefect of the Paris police, Jean Chiappe, who was notorious for his rightist sympathies and suspected of encouraging previous anti-government demonstrations. Daladier then dismissed the director of the Comédie Française, who had been staging William Shakespeare&#x27;s controversial play &quot;Coriolanus&quot;, and replaced him with the director of the Sûreté-Générale, a protégé of Chautemps and Daladier&#x27;s centre-left Radical‐Socialist Party. He also appointed a new Interior Minister, Eugène Frot, who announced that demonstrators would be shot.

The dismissal of Chiappe was the immediate cause of the 6 February 1934 crisis, which some considered as a possible rightist putsch. According to the historian Joel Colton, &quot;The consensus among scholars is that there was no concerted or unified design to seize power and that the police lacked the coherence, unity, or leadership to accomplish such an end&quot;. The historian of fascism, René Rémond, described it as &quot;barely a riot... a street demonstration&quot;.

However, leftists feared an overt fascist conspiracy. Fomented by several conservative, anti-Semitic, monarchist or fascist groups, including Action Française, the Croix-de-Feu and the Mouvement Franciste, the demonstration occurred on the night of 6–7 February 1934. The police fired upon and killed 17 people.

Daladier was forced to resign. His successor was the conservative Gaston Doumergue, who formed a coalition government. It was the first time during the Third Republic that a government had to resign as a result of riots by the opposition. Other results were the formation of anti-fascism leagues and an alliance between the French Section of the Workers&#x27; International (SFIO), the main socialist party, and the French Communist Party. That resulted in the 1936 Popular Front, which won that year&#x27;s elections.

==Further consequences==
The scandal involved a remarkable range of people from politics, wealthy society and the literary-intellectual elite of Paris. Mistinguett was asked why she had been photographed with Stavisky at a nightclub. Georges Simenon reported on the affair and Stavisky&#x27;s ex-bodyguard threatened him with physical violence. Colette, referring to the alleged inability of any of Stavisky&#x27;s important friends to remember him, described the dead con artist as &quot;a man with no face&quot;.

A trial of twenty people associated with Stavisky began in 1935. Printed charges were 1200 pages long. All of the accused, including Stavisky&#x27;s widow, two deputies and one general, were acquitted the next year. The amount defrauded was estimated to be the equivalent of $18 million at the prevailing exchange rates, plus an additional $54 million that came within months of being attained. The location of Stavisky&#x27;s wealth is still unknown.

The Stavisky affair left France weakened internally. The country remained divided politically for the rest of the decade, but the political weaknesses it exposed and exacerbated were not confined to France. The affair was emblematic of a more general decrease of popularity of democratic values and institutions in Europe during the Great Depression.

==In popular culture==
French movie director Alain Resnais told the story in the 1974 movie &quot;Stavisky&quot;, featuring Jean-Paul Belmondo with the title role and Anny Duperey as his wife Arlette.

In &quot;Forces occultes&quot;, a movie commissioned in 1942 by the &quot;Propaganda Abteilung&quot;, a delegation of Nazi Germany&#x27;s propaganda ministry within occupied France, Stavisky was presented as both a Freemason and a crook.

Hollywood released a depiction in 1937 with &quot;Stolen Holiday&quot;, featuring Claude Rains as Stavisky&#x27;s fictional counterpart, Stefan Orloff, and Kay Francis as his wife. &quot;Stolen Holiday&quot; asserted unequivocally that Orloff was shot by police and his death made to look like a suicide.

The affair also forms part of the background of the events in J. Robert Janes &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot;, one of the Kohler &amp; St. Cyre mystery novels.

<doc id="1343395" wikidata="Q214233" url="?curid=1343395" title="Benni McCarthy">
<text>Benedict Saul McCarthy (born 12 November 1977) is a South African football coach and former player who was most recently a first-team coach at Manchester United. He previously worked as head coach of South African Premier Division team AmaZulu.

A former forward, McCarthy is the South Africa national team&#x27;s all-time top scorer with 31 goals. He is also the only South African to have won the UEFA Champions League, doing so with Porto in 2003–04.

==Early life==
McCarthy was born in Cape Town and grew up in Hanover Park in the Cape Flats, an area notorious for its high unemployment rate and gang violence. He is the son of Dudley and Dora McCarthy and has two brothers and a sister. His older brother is Jerome McCarthy, a former professional footballer who played for Kaizer Chiefs and Manning Rangers, among other clubs, while his younger brother Mark played football at Franklin Pierce University in the United States.

McCarthy began playing at a local side called Young Pirates, which was managed by his uncles. He then joined the youth structures of a local amateur club called Crusaders. At age 17, he was signed by first division club Seven Stars.

==Club career==

===Seven Stars===
Playing for Seven Stars, the 18-year-old McCarthy scored 1 goal in 29 matches in the 1995–96 season, followed by another 12 goals in 20 matches, which earned him a transfer to Cape Town Spurs, which two years later merged with Seven Stars to form Dutch club Ajax&#x27;s feeder team, Ajax Cape Town.

===Ajax===
In 1997, after an impressive showing at the African Youth Championship and FIFA World Youth Championship in Malaysia, he joined Ajax in the Eredivisie, where he scored nine goals and was crowned champion in his first season. After a relatively successful 1998–99 season, he was sold to Spanish side Celta Vigo for a transfer fee reported to be over €6 million, at the time the most expensive transfer for a South African player.

===Celta Vigo===
Although regarded as one of the best African players at the time, McCarthy never established himself as a regular choice for Celta&#x27;s manager, Víctor Fernández. After two poor seasons at the Galician club, he was loaned to struggling Porto in the 2001–02 season, where he soon rediscovered the form that took him to Europe.

At Porto, McCarthy played under the then newly appointed coach José Mourinho for an underperforming team that since winning the European Cup in 1987 had never been quite good enough to challenge for the top honours in Europe. However, that would soon change.

After representing &quot;Bafana Bafana&quot; in the 2002 African Nations Cup, where his national side was eliminated in the quarter-finals, McCarthy returned to Porto, where he became the main force behind the team&#x27;s recovery. He helped them to third place in the Primeira Liga and automatic qualification for the UEFA Cup by scoring an impressive 12 goals in 11 matches, but Porto&#x27;s finances did not allow them to keep the player, despite the desire of both sides to continue.

In 2002–03, McCarthy therefore returned to Celta, where he spent much of his time on the substitutes&#x27; bench as a squad player as Porto captured the Taça de Portugal, the Portuguese League and the UEFA Cup. When Porto sold striker Hélder Postiga to Tottenham Hotspur ahead of the 2003–04 season, Porto finally acquired McCarthy for a sum of €7.856 million, (later re-sold part of the rights to GestiFute and First Portuguese Football Players Fund.)

===Porto===

For the 2003–04 Primeira Liga season, he earned the Golden Boot award (with 20 goals in 23 matches) on the season&#x27;s final matchday with a hat-trick, and was instrumental in Porto&#x27;s run in the 2003–04 UEFA Champions League, which they won. He scored two goals against Manchester United to defeat them in the second round.

===Blackburn Rovers===
On 25 July 2006, McCarthy flew out to England to undergo a medical and probable contract signing to join Blackburn Rovers. Three days later, he signed a four-year contract with Blackburn for a £2.5 million transfer fee. The move meant that Rovers regularly fielded a side that contained two South African Internationals, the other being Aaron Mokoena who joined the club the year previous.

After a disappointing performance in the side&#x27;s 3–0 defeat to Portsmouth, McCarthy found the net on his debut at Ewood Park against Everton on 23 August 2006. McCarthy further endeared himself to Rovers fans, scoring a goal on his European debut for the club in a 2–2 against Red Bull Salzburg in the UEFA Cup, and scoring another in the return leg. He finished second top scorer in the Premier League in 2006–07 with 18 league goals, as well as 24 in all competitions.

The following season got off to a poor start for McCarthy when he was stretchered off in the Premier League opening day win against Middlesbrough. McCarthy was out of action for a few weeks and found first team opportunities limited, largely because the form of new striking arrival Roque Santa Cruz. Despite being limited to largely substitute appearances, McCarthy did find the net 11 times in all competitions.

In the 2008–09 season, McCarthy appeared to be out of favour with new manager Paul Ince, as the club&#x27;s strike force was strengthened with the arrivals of Carlos Villanueva and Robbie Fowler to join the already established Roque Santa Cruz, Jason Roberts and Matt Derbyshire. However, McCarthy answered these critics by scoring his first goal of the campaign – a 94th-minute equaliser in a Premier League match against Middlesbrough.

In all competitions for Blackburn, McCarthy scored 52 goals in 140 matches.

===West Ham United===
McCarthy completed a move to West Ham United for an undisclosed fee on transfer deadline day, 1 February 2010. He signed a two-and-a-half-year contract that was due to run until the summer of 2012. He made his Premier League debut for West Ham against Burnley at Turf Moor in a 2–1 defeat on 6 February 2010, where he sustained an injury which would keep him out for six weeks. In February 2011, having played just 326 minutes of football, making only three starts and failing to score any goals for West Ham, McCarthy was omitted from West Ham&#x27;s 25-man squad for the remainder of the 2010–11 season. He was also offered a £1 million pay-off in exchange for terminating his contract prematurely. In April 2011, McCarthy left West Ham by mutual agreement after the parties agreed to terminate his contract. He made only two Premier League starts and fourteen appearances in all competitions scoring no goals.

===Orlando Pirates===
After leaving West Ham, McCarthy trained with former club Ajax Cape Town during the ABSA Premier League off-season. On 2 August, Orlando Pirates confirmed the signing of McCarthy on a two-year deal, ending his 14-year spell in Europe. On signing, McCarthy said, &quot;I&#x27;m thrilled and delighted and hope I can show my appreciation by coming in and playing good football and hope to score as many goals as possible to put the team where they belong.&quot;
 McCarthy began the season by scoring on debut and vowed to score more goals.

McCarthy scored two goals in the final half-hour to help the Pirates defeat the Golden Arrows 4–2 on 19 May 2012 to retain their Premier League title. He finished his successful season with ten league goals, ending the campaign as the fourth leading goal-scorer in the Premier League, helping the club secure their second successive treble. Having already won a league championship with Ajax in the Netherlands as well with Porto both domestically and in Europe, McCarthy would make football history by winning the league championship with Orlando Pirates in South Africa. This meant McCarthy was the first South African footballer to win three league titles with three different football clubs on two different continents.

McCarthy, who is affectionately known as &quot;Big Brother&quot; by the Orlando Pirates faithful, was handed a red card for dissent in the MTN 8 secondleg semi-final played on 25 August 2012 after he charged Franklin Cale after a reckless challenge on Daine Klate. This incident lead to protesting fans whom, in their view, Cale was equally guilty in the incident and should have also been shown red. McCarthy announced his retirement from professional football on 6 June 2013, aged 35.

===Whitehill Welfare===
On 13 July 2014, McCarthy made a guest appearance for Scottish Lowland league club Whitehill Welfare in a pre-season friendly against a Hamilton Academical XI, scoring in the 14th minute and providing an assist for Whitehill Welfare player Kerr Dodds to score in the 20th minute. McCarthy has a connection with the club through one of the Whitehill players, John Hall.

==International career==
McCarthy made his full international debut for South Africa in a friendly against the Netherlands on 4 June 1997.

Along with veteran Egyptian striker Hossam Hassan, McCarthy was the joint top scorer in the 1998 African Cup of Nations in Burkina Faso with seven goals, including four in 13 minutes against Namibia. In addition, he was named Player of the Tournament.

The 1998 FIFA World Cup in France was the first time South Africa&#x27;s national football team had reached the later stages of the competition, and McCarthy was one of their key players. After a 3–0 defeat against eventual champions France, South Africa played their second match against Denmark. Trailing since the 13th minute, McCarthy tied the game at 1–1 in the 52nd minute and gave South Africa a chance for qualification after a 1–1 draw. However, the third match also ended in a draw, against Saudi Arabia, which left the South Africans in third place and eliminated from the competition.

The 2002 World Cup saw history repeating for the South Africans. After a 2–2 draw against Paraguay and a 1–0 victory over Slovenia, McCarthy&#x27;s 30th-minute equaliser in the last match against Spain was not enough, as South Africa eventually lost 3–2 and finished with another third place in the group stage.

There was often conflict over McCarthy&#x27;s lack of participation in national team matches (whose interests often collide with his club&#x27;s) and he actually retired from international matches after the 2002 World Cup. However, he returned to the national team in 2004 and eventually set the record for most international goals for South Africa; McCarthy&#x27;s strike in the second half of a 3–0 win against Paraguay in a 2008 friendly eclipsed the previous record of 29 goals held by Shaun Bartlett.

Prior to the 2010 World Cup, held in South Africa, McCarthy announced his support for the Gun-Free World Cup campaign being run by International Action Network on Small Arms. He said, &quot;This World Cup will be the biggest in football history and the fact that it is taking place in South Africa is a chance for us to show the world everything that is good about our country. It&#x27;s great that guns will be banned from stadiums – it&#x27;s going to be a fantastic party, and guns have no place in that.&quot; After struggling with his fitness and facing criticism in his nation for being overweight, McCarthy was omitted from the final South African 23-man squad for the 2010 World Cup, which was announced on 1 June 2010.

==Managerial and coaching career==
===Hibernian===
Living in Edinburgh since 2013, McCarthy confirmed in April 2015, that he had joined the coaching staff of Alan Stubbs at Scottish club Hibernian. Stubbs had invited McCarthy so he could just learn the coaching side of things. McCarthy knew Stubbs back from their playing days when McCarthy was at Blackburn Rovers and Stubbs was at Everton. McCarthy said, that he was going to help out with the U20s, and assisting with the first team.

===Sint-Truiden===
In February 2015, he did a short internship at Sint-Truidense under Yannick Ferrera. On 8 September 2015, McCarthy was appointed assistant manager to manager Chris O&#x27;Loughlin, who replaced Yannick Ferrera. Working his way through the different tiers of the UEFA Coaching Badges system, McCarthy met O&#x27;Loughlin.

On 20 April 2016, McCarthy stopped working with Sint-Truiden for personal reasons, after it was previously announced that his contract was not renewed.

===Cape Town City===
On 13 June 2017, McCarthy was unveiled as the new Cape Town City head coach, replacing Eric Tinkler, who moved to manage SuperSport United. 
McCarthy would complete his UEFA Pro License while coaching City, and would win his first silverware as a coach in 2018 when he guided City to the MTN 8 cup. 
On 4 November 2019, McCarthy was dismissed as head coach of Cape Town City after just two wins in 18 games.

===AmaZulu===
On 14 December 2020, McCarthy was unveiled as the new AmaZulu head coach, replacing Ayanda Dlamini, who stepped down from the position on 7 December 2020. He took the club to a second-place finish in the DStv Premiership, a record high for AmaZulu in the modern era of the game in South Africa. As a result, AmaZulu qualified for the preliminary rounds of the 2021–22 CAF Champions League. McCarthy led AmaZulu to the group stages of the 2021–22 CAF Champions League in their debut season before exiting the competition. McCarthy and AmaZulu parted company on 25 March 2022.

===Manchester United===

On 30 July 2022, McCarthy was appointed as a first-team coach at Manchester United. Benni McCarthy&#x27;s contract with Manchester United ended on 27 June 2024. McCarthy chose not to renew his two-year contract so he could return to being a head coach.

==Personal life==
In 2004, McCarthy married Maria Santos from Spain. They have three daughters together: Minna, Mya and Allegra. In 2007, they separated. In May 2014, McCarthy married Scottish model Stacey Munro. Together, they have one daughter, Lima Rose, born 2012 and one son, Lio Romero, born in 2019.

In 1998, McCarthy collaborated with South African kwaito music group TKZee in &quot;Shibobo&quot;. The song released in the run-up to the 1998 World Cup in France samples greatly on &quot;The Final Countdown&quot; by Europe and features McCarthy rapping part of the lyrics. He also appears in the football-themed music video for the song. Sales of the single topped the 100,000 mark in just over a month in South Africa, making &quot;Shibobo&quot; the fastest and biggest selling CD single by TKZee or other South African recording artists. The song was also a hit in other African music charts. The song enjoyed a comeback in a re-release in 2010–11.

<doc id="1343401" wikidata="Q2633954" url="?curid=1343401" title="Methanotroph">
<text>Methanotrophs (sometimes called methanophiles) are prokaryotes that metabolize methane as their source of carbon and chemical energy. They are bacteria or archaea, can grow aerobically or anaerobically, and require single-carbon compounds to survive.

Methanotrophs are especially common in or near environments where methane is produced, although some methanotrophs can oxidize atmospheric methane. Their habitats include wetlands, soils, marshes, rice paddies, landfills, aquatic systems (lakes, oceans, streams) and more. They are of special interest to researchers studying global warming, as they play a significant role in the global methane budget, by reducing the amount of methane emitted to the atmosphere.

Methanotrophy is a special case of methylotrophy, using single-carbon compounds that are more reduced than carbon dioxide. Some methylotrophs, however, can also make use of multi-carbon compounds; this differentiates them from methanotrophs, which are usually fastidious methane and methanol oxidizers. The only facultative methanotrophs isolated to date are members of the genus &quot;Methylocella silvestris&quot;, &quot;Methylocapsa aurea&quot; and several &quot;Methylocystis&quot; strains.

In functional terms, methanotrophs are referred to as methane-oxidizing bacteria. However, methane-oxidizing bacteria encompass other organisms that are not regarded as sole methanotrophs. For this reason, methane-oxidizing bacteria have been separated into subgroups: methane-assimilating bacteria (MAB) groups, the methanotrophs, and autotrophic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AAOB), which cooxidize methane.

== Classification ==

Methanotrophs can be either bacteria or archaea. Which methanotroph species is present is mainly determined by the availability of electron acceptors. Many types of methane oxidizing bacteria (MOB) are known. Differences in the method of formaldehyde fixation and membrane structure divide these bacterial methanotrophs into several groups. There are several subgroups among the methanotrophic archaea.

Methanotrophs have been historically classified broadly into three types which are defined by physiology, mechanism of methane metabolism, and morphology: Type I, II and X More recent literature has complicated these types by identifying overlapping characteristics in genetic makeup and the environmental conditions in which they are most likely to occur. Generally, Type I methanotrophs tend to dominate in cold, anaerobic environments, meaning there is limited oxygen availability, which often have high methane concentrations. However, at a high enough salinity, Type II will dominate even in cold temperatures. Type II methanotrophs tend to be more tolerant of stress and dominate in methane limited environments and acidic pHs. As methanotroph research expands, there is less of a clear line between Type I and II methanotrophs, so familial or species classifications are more useful for grouping these organisms as seen in Table 1. This table helps illuminate that methanotrophs that favor extreme environments, like hydrothermal vents, tend to uptake methane via the Calvin-Benson-Bassham Cycle (CBB). Research to understand why certain methanotrophs favor certain conditions and assimilation pathways is ongoing and relevant to predicting methanotroph responses to climate change. 
=== Aerobic ===
Under aerobic conditions, methanotrophs combine oxygen and methane to form formaldehyde, which is then incorporated into organic compounds via the serine pathway or the ribulose monophosphate (RuMP) pathway, and carbon dioxide, which is released. Type I and type X methanotrophs are part of the Gammaproteobacteria and they use the RuMP pathway to assimilate carbon. Type II methanotrophs are part of the Alphaproteobacteria and use the serine pathway of carbon assimilation. They also characteristically have a system of internal membranes within which methane oxidation occurs. Methanotrophs in Gammaproteobacteria are known from the family &quot;Methylococcaceae&quot;. Methanotrophs from Alphaproteobacteria are found in families &quot;Methylocystaceae&quot; and &quot;Beijerinckiaceae&quot;.

Aerobic methanotrophs are also known from the &quot;Methylacidiphilaceae&quot; (phylum Verrucomicrobiota). In contrast to Gammaproteobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria, methanotrophs in the phylum Verrucomicrobiota are mixotrophs. In 2021 a bacterial bin from the phylum Gemmatimonadota called &quot;&quot;Candidatus&quot; Methylotropicum kingii&quot; showing aerobic methanotrophy was discovered thus suggesting methanotrophy to be present in the four bacterial phyla.

In some cases, aerobic methane oxidation can take place in anoxic environments. &quot;&quot;Candidatus&quot; Methylomirabilis oxyfera&quot; belongs to the phylum NC10 bacteria, and can catalyze nitrite reduction through an &quot;intra-aerobic&quot; pathway, in which internally produced oxygen is used to oxidise methane. In clear water lakes, methanotrophs can live in the anoxic water column, but receive oxygen from photosynthetic organisms, which they then directly consume to oxidize methane.

No aerobic methanotrophic archaea are known.

=== Anaerobic ===
Under anoxic conditions, methanotrophs use different electron acceptors for methane oxidation. This can happen in anoxic habitats such as marine or lake sediments, oxygen minimum zones, anoxic water columns, rice paddies and soils. Some specific methanotrophs can reduce nitrate, nitrite, iron, sulfate, or manganese ions and couple that to methane oxidation without syntrophic partner. Investigations in marine environments revealed that methane can be oxidized anaerobically by consortia of methane oxidizing archaea and sulfate-reducing bacteria. This type of anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) mainly occurs in anoxic marine sediments. The exact mechanism is still a topic of debate but the most widely accepted theory is that the archaea use the reversed methanogenesis pathway to produce carbon dioxide and another, unknown intermediate, which is then used by the sulfate-reducing bacteria to gain energy from the reduction of sulfate to hydrogen sulfide and water.

The anaerobic methanotrophs are not related to the known aerobic methanotrophs; the closest cultured relatives to the anaerobic methanotrophs are the methanogens in the order Methanosarcinales.

=== Special species ===
&quot;Methylococcus capsulatus&quot; is used to produce animal feed from natural gas.

In 2010 a new bacterium &quot;Candidatus&quot; Methylomirabilis oxyfera from the phylum NC10 was identified that can couple the anaerobic oxidation of methane to nitrite reduction without the need for a syntrophic partner. Based on studies of Ettwig et al., it is believed that &quot;M. oxyfera&quot; oxidizes methane anaerobically by utilizing oxygen produced internally from the dismutation of nitric oxide into nitrogen and oxygen gas.

In addition to providing a natural methane sink, methanotrophs provide other services for humans. In wastewater treatment plants, the application of a mix of methanotrophic bacteria has the potential to reduce costs and increase overall efficiency at removing nitrogen and byproducts. Depending upon environmental conditions, these methanotrophs can also produce biomolecules during the wastewater treatment process that are useful for a wide range of applications. For example, methanotrophs undergoing glycolysis produce exopolysaccharides (EPS) which can be extracted and used in medicine. A well-known EPS is hyaluronic acid which is used widely in cosmetics and wound care.

== Taxonomy ==
Many methanotrophic cultures have been isolated and formally characterized over the past 5 decades, starting with the classical study of Whittenbury (Whittenbury et al., 1970).  Currently, 18 genera of cultivated aerobic methanotrophic &quot;Gammaproteobacteria&quot; and 5 genera of &quot;Alphaproteobacteria&quot; are known, represented by approx. 60 different species.

== Methane oxidation ==
Methanotrophs oxidize methane by first initiating reduction of dioxygen to H2O2 and transformation of methane to CH3OH using methane monooxygenases (MMOs). Furthermore, two types of MMO have been isolated from methanotrophs: soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO) and particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO).

Cells containing pMMO have demonstrated higher growth capabilities and higher affinity for methane than sMMO containing cells. It is suspected that copper ions may play a key role in both pMMO regulation and the enzyme catalysis, thus limiting pMMO cells to more copper-rich environments than sMMO producing cells.

<text>Larne Football Club is a professional Northern Irish football club based in Larne, County Antrim, that competes in the NIFL Premiership.

==History==
The club was founded in 1889 after Rev. Turner, Mr WN Brown and L. Jackson Holmes watched a game of football between Distillery and the Black Watch regiment of the army and thus took inspiration to create Larne FC on 14 October 1889.

The club in their early days would play against Ballyclare as well as the Fisherwick club in Doagh, when, amid the rise in football interest at the turn of the century, the club experienced relative success at a junior level, winning an IFA Junior Cup in 1901, as well as winning an Intermediate Cup and a Steel &amp; Sons Cup prior to the outbreak of the First World War.

Larne would enter senior football for the first time in 1923, reaching two Irish Cup finals in the 1920s and 30s, before dropping out of senior football as a consequence of World War Two.

The following decades would see a relative amount of success for the club, with a first ever senior trophy win in the Ulster Cup in 1950, as well as a dominant period in Intermediate football over the next 20 years, winning a great deal of silverware.

As a result of the departure of Derry City from Irish League football in 1972, Larne would thus take the place of the Candystripes in senior football, with numerous relatively successful Irish Cup runs however the Invermen would never make it as far as the final.

Following the appointment of Paul Malone as player/manager in 1984, the club would have quite a strong decade that spilled into the early 90s, with several respectable league finishes and another Ulster Cup win in 1987.

The club would slip into decline from the early 90s, Malone would depart in 1991, with Larne being relegated to the old first division in 1995 with the next 8 years seeing a period of regular financial trouble and struggle to compete for promotion.

Tommy Kincaids appointment in 2001 saw a small revival for the club, achieving promotion in 2003 before Jimmy McGeough taking over in 2004. In this period the club would be defeated in the League Cup and Irish Cup finals to Cliftonville and Portadown respectively.

From 1972 until 2008, the club had senior status, but reverted to intermediate status when it failed to gain a place in the new IFA Premiership. The club regained this senior status in 2016, when the NIFL Championship became the second tier of senior football for the 2016–17 season.

Larne have notably been runners-up of the Irish Cup on six occasions (1928, 1935, 1987, 1989, 2005 and 2021) and runners-up of the League Cup twice (1991–92 and 2003–04) without ever winning either Cup - a record in both respective competitions for the most final appearances without ever winning.

=== Kenny Bruce investment era (2018–present) ===
The club in 2018 was taken over by Purplebricks co-founder Kenny Bruce, when the club sat bottom of the NIFL Championship with relegation to the third tier looking likely, the club had been locked out of their stadium on health and safety grounds, and were experiencing financial difficulty, with the prospect of administration looming. Bruce set out the aim to bring eventual European success to Larne through investment in the playing staff and facilities.

The club in January 2018 would cause significant shock in Irish League circles when Waterford United striker David McDaid opted to sign for the NIFL Championship club amid heavy interest from Premiership side Linfield.

The club lifted the 2018–19 NIFL Championship title, comfortably finishing ahead of second-placed rivals Carrick Rangers by 17 points. This was the club&#x27;s first ever senior tier league title, their first league title since an intermediate title win in 1972, and the first senior honour since lifting the Ulster Cup in 1988. This secured a return to the top flight for the first time since suffering relegation to the second tier in the 2007–08 season after failing to meet the criteria for the new IFA Premiership.

As was expected, Larne would compete in the top half of the NIFL Premiership immediately after achieving promotion, and in their first season in European competition in 2021, Larne would secure one of the biggest European wins for a Northern Irish club, knocking out Danish side Aarhus Gymnastikforening over two legs with a 2–1 win in Larne, and a draw in the away leg to set up a tie with Futebol Clube Paços de Ferreira. after a 4–0 defeat in Portugal, Larne would take a famous 1–0 win at Inver Park in the return leg.

In their fourth season back in the top flight, The Inver Reds won an historic first NIFL Premiership title in 2023 following a 2–0 win over Crusaders in April 2023. Larne were part of an intense title race with Linfield.

As a result of their title victory, the club would make their first ever appearance in the qualifiers for the UEFA Champions League in the summer of 2023, taking on Finnish giants HJK Helsinki. After a 1–0 loss in Helsinki, the Inver Reds would take the tie to extra time in Belfast, with the game ending 2–2. Larne lost 3–2 on aggregate.

Larne has won four County Antrim Shields in a row, from the 2020–21 to 2023–24 seasons. They are the only team other than Linfield to achieve this feat.

Currently, the captain of the club and their longest serving player is Tomas Cosgrove. He is known as a right back but has also been deployed in midfield by Tiernan Lynch. Cosgrove is one of many Larne players including Levi Ives and Aaron Donnelly who previously played for Cliftonville.

The 2023–24 season saw Larne go up against Cliftonville and Linfield for the title. Cliftonville fell short and finished third, while Larne edged out Linfield to claim the title for a second consecutive time.

In the 2024–25 season, Larne would defeat Ballkani on penalties and Lincoln Red Imps to reach the league stage of the 2024–25 UEFA Conference League, becoming the first side from Northern Ireland to do so in the current era of UEFA competition, with Ards competing in the group stages of the old Intertoto Cup in 1997.

Larne would struggle in the early games of the UEFA Conference League, suffering a 3-0 defeat away to Molde, and a 4-1 defeat at home to Shamrock Rovers, the latter of which was viewed as a disappointing result, as many expected Larne to compete to a better standard with the Dublin side. Larne would lose narrowly 2-1 to Swiss side St Gallen, in what was a commendable performance against much superior opposition for the Inver Reds. 

===Larne women&#x27;s team===
Larne also have a women&#x27;s team who were originally formed in November 2004, before being reincorporated back into the club in 2018, having been previously dormant for a number of years. In their inaugural season, they finished the season as the unbeaten North 2 League Champions, and also as beaten finalists in the North 2 League Cup. They now for the first time play in the top tier in 2023 (NIFL Women&#x27;s Irish Premiership) of the Northern Ireland Women&#x27;s football league system after 4 consecutive promotions.

<doc id="1343423" wikidata="Q2237584" url="?curid=1343423" title="Collective security">
<text>Collective security is arrangement between states in which 
in the institution accepts that an attack on one state is the concern of all and merits a collective response to threats by all. Collective security was a key principle underpinning the League of Nations and the United Nations. Collective security is more ambitious than systems of alliance security or collective defense in that it seeks to encompass the totality of states within a region or indeed globally.

The premise of a collective security arrangement is that it serves as a deterrent to aggression by committing an international coalition against any aggressor. While collective security is an idea with a long history, its implementation in practice has proved problematic.

Collective security is also referred to by the phrase &quot;an attack on one is an attack on all&quot;. However, usage of this phrase also frequently refers to Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, the collective security provision in NATO&#x27;s charter.

Collective Security Policy is referred to the diplomatic attempts of USSR to achieve a collective security alliance with France, Polish, Czechslovakia and Baltic countries against Nazi Germany in interwar period.

It is an important foreign policy put forward by the Soviet Union in the 1930s to stop the aggression of fascist countries and maintain world peace and national security.

==History==

===Early mentions===

Collective security is one of the most promising approaches for peace and a valuable device for power management on an international scale. Cardinal Richelieu proposed a scheme for collective security in 1629, which was partially reflected in the 1648 Peace of Westphalia. In the eighteenth century many proposals were made for collective security arrangements, especially in Europe.

The concept of a peaceful community of nations was outlined in 1795 in Immanuel Kant&#x27;s &quot;Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch&quot;. Kant outlined the idea of a league of nations that would control conflict and promote peace between states. However, he argues for the establishment of a peaceful world community not in a sense that there be a global government but in the hope that each state would declare itself as a free state that respects its citizens and welcomes foreign visitors as fellow rational beings. His key argument is that a union of free states would promote peaceful society worldwide: therefore, in his view, there can be a perpetual peace shaped by the international community rather than by a world government.

International cooperation to promote collective security originated in the Concert of Europe that developed after the Napoleonic Wars in the nineteenth century in an attempt to maintain the &quot;status quo&quot; between European states and so avoid war. This period also saw the development of international law with the first Geneva Conventions establishing laws about humanitarian relief during war and the international Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 governing rules of war and the peaceful settlement of international disputes.
The forerunner of the League of Nations, the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), was formed by peace activists William Randal Cremer and Frédéric Passy in 1889. The organization was international in scope with a third of the members of parliament, in the 24 countries with parliaments, serving as members of the IPU by 1914. Its aims were to encourage governments to solve international disputes by peaceful means and arbitration and annual conferences were held to help governments refine the process of international arbitration. The IPU&#x27;s structure consisted of a Council headed by a President which would later be reflected in the structure of the League.

At the start of the twentieth century two power blocs emerged through alliances between the European Great Powers. It was these alliances that came into effect at the start of the First World War in 1914, drawing all the major European powers into the war. This was the first major war in Europe between industrialized countries and the first time in Western Europe the results of industrialization (for example mass production) had been dedicated to war. The result of this industrial warfare was an unprecedented casualty level with eight and a half million members of armed services dead, an estimated 21 million wounded, and approximately 10 million civilian deaths.

By the time the fighting ended in November 1918, the war had had a profound impact, affecting the social, political and economic systems of Europe and inflicting psychological and physical damage on the continent. Anti-war sentiment rose across the world; the First World War was described as &quot;the war to end all wars&quot;, and its possible causes were vigorously investigated. The causes identified included arms races, alliances, secret diplomacy, and the freedom of sovereign states to enter into war for their own benefit. The perceived remedies to these were seen as the creation of an international organization whose aim was to prevent future war through disarmament, open diplomacy, international co-operation, restrictions on the right to wage wars, and penalties that made war unattractive to nations.

In a 1945 &quot;American Political Science Review&quot; article, Frederick L. Schuman criticized notions that a new collective security organization could contribute to world peace. Schuman pointed to examples from history of collective security organizations that failed to facilitate world peace. He argued that the organization that would become the United Nations could only facilitate world peace if the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom worked in unison, but that the organization would fail if there were divisions between the three powers.

==Theory==

Collective security can be understood as a security arrangement in which all states cooperate collectively to provide security for all by the actions of all against any states within the groups which might challenge the existing order by using force. That contrasts with self-help strategies of engaging in war for purely-immediate national interest. While collective security is possible, several prerequisites must be met for it to work.

Collective security also contrasts with alliances by different ways. Collective security is based on the perspective of all together in a group against any of them, rather than on unilateral idea of some against specific others. Alliances have the form of two groups against each other, such as states A+B+C against states Y+Z; however, collective security takes the form of conducting one agreement between A+B+C+Y+Z against any of them. It is different from an alliance since collective security is made to focus on internal regulation required universal membership, but alliance is made to deter or reduce an outside threat as an exclusive institution. In an alliance, a state would see its allies as an absolute gain and its enemies as a relative gains without legal obligation. In contrast, collective security follows the case of neutrality, as the whole group is required to punish the aggressor in the hope for it not to violate general norms, which are beyond the states&#x27; control, rather than by their self-interest. The opposite of short-term interest where allies fight against a common threat, collective security tends to use universal interests for global peace.

Sovereign nations eager to maintain the status quo willingly co-operate and accept a degree of vulnerability and, in some cases for minor nations, also accede to the interests of the chief contributing nations organizing the collective security. It is achieved by setting up an international co-operative organisation under the auspices of international law, which gives rise to a form of international collective governance, despite being limited in scope and effectiveness. The collective security organisation then becomes an arena for diplomacy, the balance of power, and the exercise of soft power. The use of hard power by states, unless legitimized by the collective security organisation, is considered illegitimate, reprehensible, and necessitating remediation of some kind. The collective security organisation not only gives cheaper security but also may be the only practicable means of security for smaller nations against more powerful threatening neighbours without needing to join the camp of the nations that balance their neighbours.

The concept of &quot;collective security&quot; was pioneered by Baháʼu&#x27;lláh, Michael Joseph Savage, Martin Wight, Immanuel Kant, and Woodrow Wilson and was deemed to apply interests in security in a broad manner to &quot;avoid grouping powers into opposing camps, and refusing to draw dividing lines that would leave anyone out.&quot; The term &quot;collective security&quot; has also been cited as a principle of the United Nations and earlier the League of Nations. By employing a system of collective security, the United Nations hopes to dissuade any member state from acting in a manner likely to threaten peace and thus avoid a conflict.

Collective security selectively incorporates the concept of both balance of power and global government. However, collective security is not the same as the balance of power, which is important in realism. According to Adreatta, the balance of power focuses on a state&#x27;s unilateral interests in stopping aggression. Since states look at the world as having a security dilemma because of the fear of relative gain, a state does not want any state to become predominant and so causes a mutually-restraining equilibrium. In other words, the balance of power between states supports the decentralization of power. States are separate actors and do not subordinate their autonomy or sovereignty to a central government. &quot;Singly or in combinations reflecting the coincidence of interests, States seek to influence the pattern of power distribution and to determine their own places within that pattern.&quot; The expectations of order and peace come from the belief that competing powers will somehow balance and thereby neutralize one another to produce &quot;deterrence through equilibration.&quot; In contrast, under collective security, states share the long term goal of global peace, reversing relationship between individual and community goals mentioned in the balance of power theory, which fails to maintain stability. For example, it led to break down of war during the case of Napoleonic Wars and the World Wars, when states unilaterally decided to be unwilling or unable to fight.

At the same time, the concept of global government is about centralization. Global government is a centralized institutional system that possesses the power use of force like a well-established sovereign nation-state. The concept strips states of their &quot;standing as centers of power and policy, where issues of war and peace are concerned&quot; and superimposes on them &quot;an institution possessed of the authority and capability to maintain, by unchallengeable force so far as may be necessary, the order and stability of a global community.&quot; Despite different characteristics of balance of power theory, collective security selectively incorporates both concepts, centralization and decentralization, which can boil down to the phrase &quot;order without government.&quot; Thus, collective security seems to be more reliable alternative since it gathers power as a team to punish the aggressor, and it is an attempt to improve international relations and to provide solid rules under anarchy.

===Basic assumptions===
Organski (1960) lists five basic assumptions underlying the theory of collective security:

* In an armed conflict, member nation-states can agree on which nation is the aggressor.
* All member nation-states are equally committed to contain and constrain the aggression, irrespective of its source or origin.
* All member nation-states have an identical freedom of action and ability to join in proceedings against the aggressor.
* The cumulative power of the cooperating members of the alliance for collective security is adequate and sufficient to overpower the might of the aggressor.
* In the light of the threat posed by the collective might of the nations of a collective security coalition, the aggressor nation will either modify its policies or be defeated.

===Prerequisites===
Morgenthau (1948) states that three prerequisites must be met for collective security to successfully prevent war:

* The collective security system must be able to assemble military force in strength greatly in excess to that assembled by the , thereby deterring the from attempting to change the world order that is defended by the collective security system.
* Those nations, whose combined strength would be used for deterrence as mentioned in the first prerequisite, should have identical beliefs about the security of the world order that collective security is defending.
* Nations must be willing to subordinate their conflicting interests to the common good defined in terms of the common defense of all member-states.

===Practices and Violations in International Period and The League of Nations===

After World War I, the first large-scale attempt to provide collective security in modern times was the establishment of the League of Nations in 1919 and 1920. The provisions of the League of Nations Covenant represented a weak system for decision making and collective action. According to Palmer and Perking, they pointed failure of the United States to join the League of Nations and the rise of the Soviet Union outside the League as one of major reasons for its failure to enforce collective security. Moreover, an example of the failure of the League of Nations&#x27; collective security was the Manchurian Crisis, when Japan occupied part of China, both of which were League members. After the invasion, members of the League passed a resolution that called for Japan to withdraw or face severe penalties. Since every nation had a veto power, Japan promptly vetoed the resolution, severely limiting the League&#x27;s ability to respond. After one year of deliberation, the League passed a resolution condemning the invasion without committing its members to any action against it. The Japanese replied by quitting the League.

The Collective Policy
In December 1933, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (B) adopted a resolution on waging a struggle for collective security, advocating the use of collective security forces to oppose the aggressive actions of fascist countries and prevent the outbreak of war. In preparation for its reply to the question of the French Government, the People&#x27;s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, based on the above-mentioned resolution of the Party Central Committee, prepared a proposal for the establishment of a system of collective security in Europe. The proposal was in effect a Soviet blueprint for the establishment of a European collective security system, containing the following four main points:
France is Germany&#x27;s close neighbor and old enemy, Hitler&#x27;s anti-French propaganda and breaking the treaty to expand the army also caused the French public vigilance and fear. In February 1934, the French realist politician Bardo became foreign minister, and under the promotion of other cabinet members, the foreign policy of &quot;Grand Coalition&quot; was formed. Bardo&#x27;s foreign policy has four elements:
After two months of negotiations, Bardo formally presented the draft of the Eastern Pact to the Soviet Union and Britain in June 1934. The draft proposes the conclusion of two mutually integrated agreements: the Eastern Convention in the strict sense, namely, the Convention on mutual assistance between the Soviet Union, Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Estonia, Finland, Latvia and Lithuania, and the Franco-Soviet Treaty on Mutual assistance based on the participation of the Soviet Union in the Logano Convention and the participation of France in the Eastern Convention.

In both cases, the absence of the United States deprived it of another major power that could have used economic leverage against either of the aggressor states. Inaction by the League subjected it to criticisms that it was weak and concerned more with European issues since most leading of its members were European, and it did not deter Hitler from his plans to dominate Europe. Abyssinian Emperor Haile Selassie continued to support collective security, as he assessed that impotence lay not in the principle but its covenantors&#x27; commitment to honor its tenets.

One active and articulate exponent of collective security during the immediate prewar years was Soviet Foreign Minister Maxim Litvinov.

After the Munich Agreement in September 1938, Germany, Hungary and Poland actively involved in the partition of Czechslovakia. Nazi Germany and Poland relatively annexed Sudetenland and Cechin region in the October of 1938. In Nov. 1938, Hungary annexed south Slovakia.

Soviet foreign policy was revised, and Litvinov was replaced as foreign minister in early May 1939 to facilitate the negotiations that led to the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact with Germany, which was signed by Litvinov&#x27;s successor, Vyacheslav Molotov, on August 23. The war in Europe broke out a week later with the invasion of Poland, which started on September 1. Thus, collective security may not always work because of the lack of commitment and the unwillingness of states or the international community to act in concert (Mingst 1999).

=== United Nations ===

The 1945 United Nations Charter contains stronger provisions for decision-making and collective military action than those of the League of Nations Covenant, but it represents not a complete system of collective security but a balance between collective action and the continued operation of the states system, including the continued special roles of great powers. States in the UN collective security system are selective to support or oppose UN action in certain conflicts, based on their self-interests. The UN can be somehow seen as the platform for self-interest purposes for members in Security Council because of the permanent members&#x27; veto power and the excessive assistance or aid, which have made those states to act unilaterally and to ignore the approval of or to violate resolutions of the Security Council. The Iraq crisis is a clearer example: &quot;Rather than seek the global interest of peace and security through stability in Iraq and the Middle East region, the domination oriented members amassed their vast economic, diplomatic and military resources, captured and brazenly subjugated Iraq to an unprecedented condominial regime serving their economic interest under Iraq Reconstruction Programme&quot; (Eke 2007). In addition, the lack of geographical spread of members in the Security Council causes an imbalance in the role of maintenance global peace and security. The voices of small countries can be heard, but policies are not adopted in response to them unless they serve the great powers&#x27; interests.

However, collective security in the UN has not completely failed. The role of the UN and collective security in general is evolving with the rise of civil wars. Since the end of World War II, there have been 111 military conflicts worldwide, but only 9 of them have involved two or more states going to war with one another. The others have been civil wars in which other states have intervened in some manner. That means that collective security may have to evolve towards providing a means to ensure stability and a fair international resolution to those internal conflicts. Whether that involves more powerful peacekeeping forces or a larger role for the UN diplomatically is likely to be judged on a case-by-case basis.

==Collective defense==

Collective defense is an arrangement, usually formalized by a treaty and an organization, among participant states that commit support in defense of a member state if it is attacked by another state outside the organization. NATO is the best-known collective defense organization; its famous Article 5 calls on (but does not fully commit) member states to assist another member under attack. This article was invoked only after the September 11 attacks on the United States, after which other NATO members provided assistance to the US war on terror by participating in the War in Afghanistan.

Collective defense has its roots in multiparty alliances and entails benefits as well as risks. On the one hand, by combining and pooling resources, it can reduce any single state&#x27;s cost of providing fully for its security. For example, smaller members of NATO have leeway to invest a greater proportion of their budget on nonmilitary priorities, such as education or health, since they can count on other members to come to their defense if needed.

On the other hand, collective defense also involves risky commitments. Member states can become embroiled in costly wars benefiting neither the direct victim nor the aggressor. In World War I, France was obligated to join into war with Austria-Hungary and Germany because France&#x27;s ally Russia was at war with them. Germany declared war on Russia on 1 August 1914 and on 3 August it declared war on France.

<doc id="1343424" wikidata="Q21260516" url="?curid=1343424" title="Black power movement">
<text>The Black power movement or Black liberation movement emerged in mid-1960s from the civil rights movement in the United States, reacting against its moderate, mainstream, and incremental tendencies and representing the demand for more immediate action to counter White supremacy. Many of its ideas were influenced by Malcolm X&#x27;s criticism of Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s peaceful protest methods. The 1965 assassination of Malcolm X, coupled with the urban riots of 1964 and 1965, ignited the movement. While thinkers such as Malcolm X influenced the early movement, the views of the Black Panther Party, founded in 1966, are widely seen as the cornerstone. Black power was influenced by philosophies such as pan-Africanism, Black nationalism, and socialism, as well as contemporary events such as the Cuban Revolution and the decolonization of Africa.

During the peak of the Black power movement in the late 1960s and early 1970s, many African Americans adopted &quot;Afro&quot; hairstyles, African clothes, or African names (such as Stokely Carmichael, the chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee who popularized the phrase &quot;Black power&quot; and later changed his name to Kwame Ture) to emphasize their identity. Others founded Black-owned stores, food cooperatives, bookstores, publishers, media, clinics, schools, and other organizations oriented to their communities. American universities began to offer courses in Black studies, and the word &quot;Black&quot; replaced &quot;negro&quot; as the preferred usage in the country. Other leaders of the movement included Huey P. Newton and Bobby Seale, founders of the Black Panther Party.

Some Black power organizations prioritized social programs, while others adopted a more militant approach; for instance, the Black Panther Party introduced a Free Breakfast for Children program and established community health clinics, while the Black Liberation Army carried out bombings and murdered police officers. The movement never had a central authority or structure, and its influence was diluted by legislation such as the Fair Housing Act of 1968, the expansion of federally funded welfare programs, and police action against its activists. The Black power movement declined by the mid-1970s and 1980s, as civil rights activists increasingly focused on electing Black politicians over militant struggle, though its legacy has influenced later movements, such as Black Lives Matter.

==History==
===Origin===
The first popular use of the term &quot;Black power&quot; as a social and racial slogan was by Stokely Carmichael (later known as Kwame Ture) and Willie Ricks (later known as Mukasa Dada), both organizers and spokespeople for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. On June 16, 1966, in a speech in Greenwood, Mississippi, during the March Against Fear, Carmichael led the marchers in a chant for Black power that was televised nationally.

The organization Nation of Islam began as a Black nationalist movement in the 1930s, inspiring later groups. It was strongly influenced by Pan-Asianism, especially with respect to Japan, believing in a unity between non-White peoples. Kevin Gaines has argued that in the 1950s, an early version of the Black Power movement was restrained due to Cold War tensions. This was done through methods like the restriction of passports. Figures such as W. E. B. Du Bois, Paul Robeson and Julian Mayfield were part of this and some, including Mayfield, felt forced to emigrate the United States and continue their activism elsewhere, with Mayfield going to Ghana.

Malcolm X is largely credited with the group&#x27;s dramatic increase in membership between the early 1950s and early 1960s (from 500 to 25,000 by one estimate; from 1,200 to 50,000 or 75,000 by another). In March 1964, Malcolm X left the Nation due to disagreements with Elijah Muhammad; among other things, he cited his interest in working with civil rights leaders, saying that Muhammad had prevented him from doing so. Later, Malcolm X also said Muhammad had engaged in extramarital affairs with young Nation secretariesa serious violation of the group&#x27;s teachings. On February 21, 1965, Malcolm X was shot and killed while speaking at the Audubon Ballroom in Washington Heights, New York City. Three Nation members were convicted of assassinating him. Despite this, there has long been speculation and suspicion of government involvement. The forty police officers at the scene were instructed to &quot;stand down&quot; by their commanding officers while the shooting took place.

After the Watts riots in Los Angeles in 1965, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee decided to cut ties with the mainstream civil rights movement. They argued that Blacks needed to build power of their own, rather than seek accommodations from the power structure in place. SNCC migrated from a philosophy of nonviolence to one of greater militancy after the mid-1960s. The organization established ties with radical groups such as the Students for a Democratic Society.

In late October 1966, Huey P. Newton and Bobby Seale founded the Black Panther Party. In formulating a new politics, they drew on their experiences working with a variety of Black power organizations.

===Escalation in the late 1960s===

The Black Panther Party initially utilized open-carry gun laws to protect party members and local Black communities from law enforcement. Party members also recorded incidents of police brutality by distantly following police cars around neighborhoods. Numbers grew slightly starting in February 1967, when the party provided an armed escort at the San Francisco airport for Betty Shabazz, Malcolm X&#x27;s widow and keynote speaker at a conference held in his honor. By 1967, the SNCC began to fall apart due to policy disputes in its leadership, and many members left for the Black Panthers. Throughout 1967, the Panthers staged rallies and disrupted the California State Assembly with armed marchers. In 1956 the FBI developed COINTELPRO to investigate Black nationalist groups and others. By 1969, the Black Panthers and their allies had become primary COINTELPRO targets, singled out in 233 of the 295 authorized &quot;Black nationalist&quot; COINTELPRO actions. In 1968, the Republic of New Afrika was founded, a separatist group seeking a Black country in the southern United States, only to dissolve by the early 1970s.
At the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, Tommie Smith and John Carlos, the gold and bronze medalists, respectively, in the 200 meters event, each raised a black-gloved hand as the American national anthem was played during their medal ceremony. Afterwards, Smith stated that: &quot;We are Black and we are proud of being Black. Black America will understand what we did.&quot;

By 1968, many Black Panther leaders had been arrested, including founder Huey Newton for the murder of a police officer (Newton&#x27;s prosecution was eventually dismissed), yet membership surged. Black Panthers later engaged the police in a firefight in a Los Angeles gas station. In the same year, Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated, creating nationwide riots, the widest wave of social unrest since the American Civil War. In Cleveland, Ohio, the &quot;Republic of New Libya&quot; engaged the police in the Glenville shootout, which was followed by rioting. The year also marked the start of the White Panther Party, a group of Whites dedicated to the cause of the Black Panthers. Founders Pun Plamondon and John Sinclair were arrested, but eventually freed, in connection to the bombing of a Central Intelligence Agency office in Ann Arbor, Michigan, that September.

By 1969, the Black Panthers began purging members due to fear of law enforcement infiltration, engaged in multiple gunfights with police and one with a Black nationalist organization. The Panthers continued their &quot;Free Huey&quot; campaign internationally. In the spirit of rising militancy, the League of Revolutionary Black Workers was formed in Detroit, which supported labor rights and Black liberation. 

===Peak in the early 1970s===
In 1970 the Honorary Prime Minister of the Black Panther Party, Stokely Carmichael, traveled to various countries to discuss methods to resist &quot;American imperialism&quot;. In Trinidad, the Black power Movement had escalated into the Black Power Revolution in which many Afro-Trinidadians forced the government of Trinidad to give into reforms. Later many Panthers visited Algeria to discuss Pan-Africanism and anti-imperialism. In the same year former Black Panthers formed the Black Liberation Army to continue a violent revolution rather than the party&#x27;s new reform movements. On October 22, 1970, the Black Liberation Army is believed to have planted a bomb in St. Brendan&#x27;s Church in San Francisco while it was full of mourners attending the funeral of San Francisco police officer Harold Hamilton, who had been killed in the line of duty while responding to a bank robbery. The bomb was detonated, but no one in the church suffered serious injuries.

In 1971, several Panther officials fled the U.S. due to police concerns. This was the only active year of the Black Revolutionary Assault Team, a group that bombed the New York South African consular office in protest of apartheid. On September 20 it placed bombs at the UN Missions of Republic of the Congo (Kinshasa) and the Republic of Malawi. In February 1971, ideological splits within the Black Panther Party between leaders Newton and Eldridge Cleaver led to two factions within the party; the conflict turned violent and four people were killed in a series of assassinations. On May 21, 1971, five Black Liberation Army members participated in the shootings of two New York City police officers, Joseph Piagentini and Waverly Jones. Those brought to trial for the shootings include Anthony Bottom (also known as Jalil Muntaqim), Albert Washington, Francisco Torres, Gabriel Torres, and Herman Bell.

During the jail sentence of White Panther John Sinclair a &quot;Free John&quot; concert took place, including John Lennon and Stevie Wonder. Sinclair was released two days later. On August 29, three BLA members murdered San Francisco police sergeant John Victor Young at his police station. Two days later, the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; received a letter signed by the BLA claiming responsibility for the attack. Late in the year Huey Newton visited China for meetings on Maoist theory and anti-imperialism. Black power icon George Jackson attempted to escape from prison in August, killing seven hostages only to be killed himself. Jackson&#x27;s death triggered the Attica Prison uprising which was later ended in a bloody siege. On November 3, Officer James R. Greene of the Atlanta Police Department was shot and killed in his patrol van at a gas station by Black Liberation Army members.

1972 was the year Newton shut down many Black Panther chapters and held a party meeting in Oakland, California. On January 27, the Black Liberation Army assassinated police officers Gregory Foster and Rocco Laurie in New York City. After the killings, a note sent to authorities portrayed the murders as a retaliation for the prisoner deaths during 1971 Attica prison riot. To date no arrests have been made. On July 31, five armed BLA members hijacked Delta Air Lines Flight 841, eventually collecting a ransom of $1 million and diverting the plane, after passengers were released, to Algeria. The authorities there seized the ransom but allowed the group to flee. Four were eventually caught by French authorities in Paris, where they were convicted of various crimes, but one—George Wright—remained a fugitive until September 26, 2011, when he was captured in Portugal. After being accused of murdering a prostitute in 1974, Huey Newton fled to Cuba. Elaine Brown became party leader and embarked on an election campaign.

===De-escalation in the late 1970s===

In the late 1970s a rebel group named after the killed prisoner formed the George Jackson Brigade. From March 1975 to December 1977, the Brigade robbed at least seven banks and detonated about 20 pipe bombs—mainly targeting government buildings, electric power facilities, Safeway stores, and companies accused of racism. In 1977, Newton returned from exile in Cuba. Shortly afterward, Elaine Brown resigned from the party and fled to Los Angeles. The Party fell apart, leaving only a few members.

MOVE developed in Philadelphia in 1972 as the &quot;Christian Movement for Life&quot;, a communal living group based on Black Liberation principles. When police raided their house in 1978, a firefight broke out; during the shootout, one officer was killed, seven other police officers, five firefighters, three MOVE members, and three bystanders were also injured.

In another high-profile incident of the Black Liberation Army, Assata Shakur, Zayd Shakur and Sundiata Acoli were said to have opened fire on state troopers in New Jersey after being pulled over for a broken taillight. Zayd Shakur and state trooper Werner Foerster were both killed during the exchange. Following her capture, Assata Shakur was tried in six different criminal trials. According to Shakur, she was beaten and tortured during her incarceration in a number of different federal and state prisons. The charges ranged from kidnapping to assault and battery to bank robbery. Assata Shakur was found guilty of the murder of both Foerster and her companion Zayd Shakur, but escaped prison in 1979 and eventually fled to Cuba and received political asylum. Acoli was convicted of killing Foerster and sentenced to life in prison.

In 1978 a group of Black Liberation Army and Weather Underground members formed the May 19th Communist Organization, or M19CO. It also included members of the Black Panthers and the Republic of New Africa.
 In 1979 three M19CO members walked into the visitor&#x27;s center at the Clinton Correctional Facility for Women near Clinton, New Jersey. They took two guards hostage and freed Shakur. Several months later M19CO arranged for the escape of William Morales, a member of Puerto Rican separatist group Fuerzas Armadas de Liberación Nacional Puertorriqueña from Bellevue Hospital in New York City, where he was recovering after a bomb he was building exploded in his hands.

===Decline in the 1980s===
Over the 1980s the Black power movement continued despite a decline in its popularity and organization memberships. The Black Liberation Army was active in the US until at least 1981 when a Brinks truck robbery, conducted with support from former Weather Underground members Kathy Boudin and David Gilbert, left a guard and two police officers dead. Boudin and Gilbert, along with several BLA members, were subsequently arrested. M19CO engaged in a bombing campaign in the 1980s. They targeted a series of government and commercial buildings, including the U.S. Senate. On November 3, 1984, two members of the M19CO, Susan Rosenberg and Timothy Blunk, were arrested at a mini-warehouse they had rented in Cherry Hill, New Jersey. Police recovered more than 100 blasting caps, nearly 200 sticks of dynamite, more than 100 cartridges of gel explosive, and 24 bags of blasting agent from the warehouse. The M19CO alliance&#x27;s last bombing was on February 23, 1985, at the Policemen&#x27;s Benevolent Association in New York City.

MOVE had relocated to West Philadelphia after the earlier shootout. On May 13, 1985, the police, along with city manager Leo Brooks, arrived with arrest warrants and attempted to clear the MOVE building and arrest the indicted MOVE members. This led to an armed standoff with police, who lobbed tear gas canisters at the building. MOVE members shot at the police, who returned fire with automatic weapons. The police then bombed the house, killing several adults and children, and causing a large fire that destroyed the better part of a city block.

In 1989, well into the waning years of the movement, the New Black Panther Party formed. In the same year on August 22, Huey P. Newton was fatally shot outside by 24-year-old Black Guerilla Family member Tyrone Robinson.

==Characteristics==
===Education===
The fifth point of the Black Panther Party&#x27;s Ten-Point Program called for &quot;education for our people that exposes the true nature of this decadent American society. We want education that teaches us our true history and our role in the present day society.&quot; This sentiment was echoed in many of the other Black power organizations; the inadequacy of Black education had earlier been remarked on by W. E. B. Du Bois, Marcus Garvey, and Carter G. Woodson.

With this backdrop, Stokely Carmichael brought political education into his work with SNCC in the rural South. This included get-out-the-vote campaigns and political literacy. Bobby Seale and Huey Newton used education to address the lack of identity in the Black community. Seale had worked with youth in an after-school program before starting the Panthers. Through this new education and identity building, they believed they could empower Black Americans to claim their freedom.

===Media===
Just as Black power activists focused on community control of schools and politics, the movement took a major interest in creating and controlling its own media institutions. Most famously, the Black Panther Party produced the Black Panther newspaper, which proved to be one of the BPP&#x27;s most influential tools for disseminating its message and recruiting new members.

WAFR was launched in September 1971 as the first public, community-based Black radio station. The Durham, North Carolina, station broadcast until 1976, but influenced later activist radio stations including WPFW in Washington, D.C., and WRFG in Atlanta.

==Australian Black power==
The American Black power movement influenced Aboriginal Australian activists from the late 1960s onwards, especially in Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne. The term became widely known after the Victorian Aborigines Advancement League (AAL), led by Bruce McGuinness and Bob Maza, invited Caribbean activist Roosevelt Brown to give a talk on Black power in Melbourne in 1968, causing a media frenzy. The AAL was influenced by the ideas of Malcolm X and Stokely Carmichael. The Australian &quot;Black power movement&quot; had emerged in Redfern in Sydney, Fitzroy, Melbourne, and South Brisbane, following the &quot;Freedom Ride&quot; led by Charles Perkins in 1965. There was a small group of people at the centre of the movement known as the Black Caucus.

Bobbi Sykes defined Australian Black power as &quot;The power generated by people who seek to identify their own problems and those of the community as a whole, and who strive to take action in all possible forms to solve those problems&quot;, while Paul Coe saw it as the need for Aboriginal people to &quot;take control both of the economical, the political and cultural resources of the people and of the land…so that they themselves have got the power to determine their own future&quot;. Activist and later academic Gary Foley later wrote that in Australia, Black power &quot;was essentially about the necessity for Black people to define the world in their own terms, and to seek self-determination and independence on their own terms, without white interference&quot;. The Aboriginal Legal Service in Redfern grew out of this activism.

==Legacy==
After the 1970s the Black power movement saw a decline, but not an end. In 1998, the Black Radical Congress was founded, with debatable effects. The Black Riders Liberation Party was created by Bloods and Crips gang members as an attempt to recreate the Black Panther Party in 1996. The group has spread, creating chapters in cities across the United States, and frequently staging paramilitary marches. During the 2008 presidential election New Black Panther Party members were accused of voter intimidation at a polling station in a predominantly Black, Democratic voting district of Philadelphia. After the killing of Trayvon Martin Black power paramilitaries formed, including the Huey P. Newton Gun Club, African American Defense League, and the New Black Liberation Militia, all staging armed marches and military training.

Some have compared the modern movement Black Lives Matter to the Black power movement, noting its similarities. The Movement for Black Lives openly promotes Black power.

<text>Farfel (Yiddish: פֿאַרפֿל, &quot;farfl&quot;; from Middle High German &quot;varveln&quot;) is small pellet- or flake-shaped pasta used in Ashkenazi Jewish cuisine. It is made from a Jewish egg noodle dough and is frequently toasted before being cooked. It can be served in soups or as a side dish. In the United States, it can also be found pre-packaged as egg barley.

During the Jewish holiday of Passover, when dietary laws pertaining to grains are observed, &quot;matzah farfel&quot; takes the place of the egg noodle version. Matzah farfel is simply matzah broken into small pieces.

The Baal Shem Tov, founder of the Hasidic movement, is said to have eaten farfel every Friday night because the word was similar to the word &quot;farfaln&quot; which means &quot;wiped out, over and finished&quot;. He considered the noodles symbolic of the end of the old week.

<doc id="1343430" wikidata="Q1929359" url="?curid=1343430" title="Limavady United F.C.">
<text>Limavady United Football Club is a semi-professional, Northern Irish football club playing in the NIFL Championship.
The club comes from Limavady, County Londonderry, and plays home matches at the Showgrounds. Club colours are royal blue shirts with white trim, blue socks and royal blue shorts. Away colours are all yellow. The current manager is Paul Owens.

==History==
There have been many football clubs in Limavady, dating back to 1880, when Alexander, a founding member of the Irish Football Association was formed by the Alexander Cricket Club. Alexander merged with another local club, Wanderers, in 1884 to form Limavady F.C. Club historian David Brewster, however, dates the current Limavady club&#x27;s formation to 1955.

After a long time as a junior team, the club joined the senior Irish Football League in 1997–98, and reached its first Irish Cup semi-final in over a century in 2003–04. In 2008, the club lost its senior status when it failed to gain admission to the new IFA Premiership.

In April 2013, three players received suspensions after being found guilty of breaching IFA betting rules on one of the club&#x27;s league matches.

The club won the NIFL Championship 2 in the 2015–2016 season but were denied promotion to NIFL Championship 1 as they were unsuccessful in applying for a licence. However they were promoted as winners of the Premier Intermediate League in 2016–2017. They would be relegated at the end of the 2018/19 season.

Following a stay in the PIL, the club would make their NIFL Championship return following a 3–0 win away to Lisburn Distillery, also securing the league trophy.

===Carlos Tevez loan===
In September 2011, the club vice chairman David Brewster issued a fax to Manchester City, offering to take Argentinian International Carlos Tevez on loan after the player had refused to go on as a substitute in a UEFA Champions League fixture. The club offer suggested that they would ensure Tevez stayed match fit and would avoid being cup tied, but asked that City continued to pay his reported £200,000 per week wages, a figure higher than Limavady&#x27;s entire turnover for a year.

The offer, although meant as tongue in cheek became global headline news with some news agencies believing the offer to be a serious one. The story gained the club brief worldwide recognition although Manchester City themselves did not respond.

<text>The cinema of Iran (), or of [[Name of Iran|Persia]], refers to the film industry in Iran. In particular, Iranian art films have garnered international recognition. Iranian films are usually written and spoken in the Persian language.

Iran has been lauded as one of the best exporters of cinema in the 1990s. Some critics now rank Iran as the world&#x27;s most important national cinema, artistically, with a significance that invites comparison to Italian neorealism and similar movements in past decades. A range of international film festivals have honoured Iranian cinema in the last twenty years. Many film critics from around the world have praised Iranian cinema as one of the world&#x27;s most important artistic cinemas.

==History==
===Visual arts in Iran===
The earliest examples of visual representations in Iranian history may be traced back to the bas-reliefs in Persepolis (c. 500 BC). Bas relief is a method of sculpting which entails carving or etching away the surface of a flat piece of stone or metal. Persepolis was the ritual center of the ancient kingdom of Achaemenids and &quot;the figures at Persepolis remain bound by the rules of grammar and syntax of visual language.&quot;

Iranian visual arts may be said to have peaked about a thousand years later during the Sassanian reign. A bas-relief from this period in Taq Bostan (western Iran) depicts a complex hunting scene. Similar works from the period have been found to articulate movements and actions in a highly sophisticated manner. It is even possible to see the progenitor of the cinema close-up: a wounded wild pig escaping from the hunting ground, among these works of art.

After the conversion from Zoroastrianism to Islam; Persian art continued its visual practices. Persian miniatures provide great examples of such continued attempts. The deliberate lack of perspective in Persian miniature enabled the artist to have different plots and sub-plots within the same image space. A very popular form of such art was &quot;Pardeh Khani&quot;. Another type of art in the same category was &quot;Naqqali&quot;.

Popular dramatic performance arts in Iran, before the advent of cinema, include Marionette, Saye-bazi (shadow plays), Rouhozi (comical acts), and Ta&#x27;zieh.

cinema entered into the public realm, but, its cultural and economic capabilities were still unknown. As a consequence, theaters experienced a growing trend at the outset as to reveal economic attractions of cinema. Due to equating him with the Iranian Constitutional Revolutionaries, Mirza Ebrahim Khan Sahhafbashi’s Kinetoscopes corridor didn’t last for even a month and was closed, resulting in his leaving Iran. Then, it was the turn of Rousi Khan’s public theater. It, too, didn’t survive for a long time as the public theater was plundered during conflicts between Mohammad Ali Shah and Constitution Revolutionaries and, moreover, he himself fled abroad. After him, it was‘ Ardeshir Khan Armeni’ who introduced the real meaning of running and using cinema, continuing until long after him.

===Early Persian cinema===
Cinema was only five years old when it came to Persia at the beginning of the 20th century. The first Persian filmmaker was Mirza Ebrahim Khan Akkas Bashi, the official photographer of Muzaffar al-Din Shah, the King of Persia from 1896–1907. After a visit to Paris in July 1900, Akkas Bashi obtained a camera and filmed the Shah&#x27;s visit to Europe upon the Shah&#x27;s orders. He is said to have filmed the Shah&#x27;s private and religious ceremonies, but no copies of such films exist today. A few years after Akkas Bashi started photography, Khan Baba Motazedi, another pioneer in Iranian motion picture photography emerged. He shot a considerable amount of newsreel footage during the reign of Qajar to the Pahlavi dynasty.

The first public screening took place in Tehran in 1904, presented by Mirza Ebrahim Khan Sahaf Bashi. He arranged the screening in the back of his antique shop. In 1905, Sahaf Bashi opened the first movie theater in Cheragh Gaz Avenue in the national capital.
In 1909, with fall of the Mohammad Ali Shah Qajar heir of Mozaffar ad-Din Shah Qajar and the success of the constitutionalists, Russi Khan lost his support. Consequently, his film theatre and photography studios were destroyed by the public. Soon after, other cinema theatres in Tehran closed down. Movie theatres sprang up again in 1912 with the help of Ardeshir Khan, an Armenian-Iranian.
In 1904, Mirza Ebrahim Khan Sahhafbashi opened the first movie theater in Tehran. The cinematographic camera was introduced to Iran in 1929, as yet another tool of modernization. After Mirza Ebrahim Khan, several others like Russi Khan, Ardeshir Khan, and Ali Vakili tried to establish new movie theaters in Tehran. Until the early 1930s, there were little more than 15 theatres in Tehran and 11 in other provinces. In 1925, Ovanes Ohanian, decided to establish the first film school in Iran. Within five years he managed to run the first session of the school under the name &quot;Parvareshgahe Artistiye Cinema&quot;.

===1930s and 1940s===

In 1930 the first Iranian silent film was made by Professor Ovanes Ohanian called &quot;Abi and Rabi&quot;. In 1933 he made his second film titled &quot;Haji Agha&quot;. Later that year, Abdolhossein Sepanta made the first Iranian sound film, entitled &quot;Lor Girl&quot;, which was released in 1933 in two Tehran cinemas, Mayak and Sepah. The story of the film was based on a comparison between the state of security in Iran at the end of the Qajar dynasty and during Reza Shah period. Sepanta would go on to direct movies such as &quot;Ferdowsi&quot; (the life story of the most celebrated epic poet of Iran), &quot;Shirin and Farhad&quot; (a classic Iranian love story), and &quot;Black Eyes&quot; (the story of Nader Shah&#x27;s invasion of India). In 1937, he directed &quot;Laili and Majnoon&quot;, an Eastern love story similar to the English story of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;.

The present day Iranian film industry owes much of its progress to two industrious personalities, Esmail Koushan and Farrokh Ghaffari. By establishing the first National Iranian Film Society in 1949 at the Iran Bastan Museum and organizing the first Film Week during which English films were exhibited, Ghaffari laid the foundation for alternative and non-commercial films in Iran.

Early Persian directors like Abdolhossein Sepanta and Esmail Koushan took advantage of the richness of Persian literature and ancient Persian mythology. In their work, they emphasized ethics and humanity.

===Pre-revolutionary cinema, 1950s–1970s===
===Post-revolutionary cinema===
In the early 1970s, a New Iranian Cinema emerged (&quot;cinema motefävet&quot;). However, following the Revolution in 1979, a few filmmakers and actors went into exile per new governmental regulations. Between 1979 and 1985, about 100 features were released. While Khomeini&#x27;s censorship remained, the small number of features produced focused on sexual display and European influence.

In 1982, the annual Fajr Film Festival financed films. The Farabi Cinema Foundation then stepped in to try and reassemble the disorganized cinema. The following year, the government began to provide financial aid. This change in regime encouraged a whole new generation of filmmakers, which included female directors as well. With this, the focus shifted to children overcoming obstacles: true stories, lyrical, mystical drama, real-life problems, documentary footage, etc.

Post-revolutionary Iranian cinema has been celebrated in many international forums and festivals for its distinct style, themes, authors, idea of nationhood, and cultural references. Starting With Viva... by Khosrow Sinai and followed by many excellent Iranian directors who emerged in the last few decades, such as Abbas Kiarostami and Jafar Panahi. Kiarostami, who some critics regard as one of the few great directors in the history of cinema, planted Iran firmly on the map of world cinema when he won the Palme d&#x27;Or at the Cannes Film Festival for &quot;Taste of Cherry&quot; in 1997.

The continuous presence of Iranian films in prestigious international festivals such as the Cannes Film Festival, the Venice Film Festival, and the Berlin Film Festival attracted world attention to Iranian masterpieces .. In 2006, six Iranian films, of six different styles, represented Iranian cinema at the Berlin Film Festival. Critics considered this a remarkable event in the history of Iranian cinema.

An important step was taken in 1998 when the Iranian government began to fund ethnic cinema. Since then Iranian Kurdistan has seen the rise of numerous filmmakers. In particular, the film industry got momentum in Iranian Kurdistan and the region has seen the emergence of filmmakers such as Bahman Ghobadi, actually the entire Ghobadi family, Ali-Reza Rezai, Khosret Ressoul and many other younger filmmakers.

There is also movie-documentary production, often critical of the society in the name of the Islamic revolution ideal, like the films directed by Mohammedreza Eslamloo.

By the year 2001 the number of features produced in Iran rose to 87 (from 28, which is the number of films that were produced in 1980, after the fall of the Shah). The most popular genres were melodramas and historical pageants which seldom went to festivals. In 1997, the newly elected president, Mohammed Khatemi, would eventually come to play a role in helping filmmakers achieve a certain degree of artistic freedom.

== Contemporary Iranian cinema ==
Today, the Iranian box office is dominated by commercial Iranian films. Western films are occasionally shown in movie theaters. and contemporary Hollywood productions are shown on state television. Iranian art films are often not screened officially, and are viewable via unlicensed DVDs which are available. Some of these acclaimed films were screened in Iran and had box office success. Examples include Rassul Sadr Ameli&#x27;s &quot;I’m Taraneh, 15&quot;, Rakhshan Bani-Etemad&#x27;s &quot;Under the skin of the City&quot;, Bahman Ghobadi&#x27;s &quot;Marooned in Iraq&quot; and Manijeh Hekmat&#x27;s &quot;Women&#x27;s Prison&quot;.

===Commercial cinema in Iran===

The internationally award-winning cinema of Iran is quite different from the domestically oriented films. The latter caters to an entirely different audience, which is largely under the age of 25. This commercial Iranian cinema genre is largely unknown in the West, as the films are targeted at local audiences. There are Three categories of this type of film:

*Films before the revolution.
&quot;Lor Girl&quot;, &quot;A Party in Hell&quot;, &quot;Qeysar&quot;, &quot;Dar Emtedade Shab&quot;, &quot;Amir Arsalan&quot;, and &quot;Ganj-e Qarun&quot;.
*Films about the victory of the Iranian Revolution of 1979 and the ensuing Iran–Iraq war and Action filled with strong religious and national motifs.
&quot;Eagles&quot;, &quot;Barzakhiha&quot;, &quot;The Viper&quot;, &quot;Dadshah&quot;, &quot;Boycott&quot;, &quot;Duel&quot;, &quot;Taraj&quot;, &quot;Ekhrajiha&quot;, &quot;The Glass Agency&quot;, &quot;Kani Manga&quot;, &quot;Ofogh&quot;, &quot;Bashu, the Little Stranger&quot;, &quot;Leily Ba Man Ast&quot;, &quot;M as in Mother&quot; and &quot;The Night Bus&quot;.
*Formulaic films starring popular actors. With 130 Iranian films looking for a screening each year, cinema managers tend to prefer crowd-pleasing comedies, romantic melodramas, and family comedies over the other genres. &quot;The Lizard&quot;, &quot;The Blue-Veiled&quot;, &quot;Ghermez&quot;, &quot;Leila&quot;, &quot;Outsiders&quot;, &quot;Char Changooli&quot;, &quot;Kolah Ghermezi and Pesar Khaleh&quot;, &quot;Kolah Ghermezi and Bache Naneh&quot;, &quot;Actor&quot;, &quot;Ejareh-Nesheenha&quot;, &quot;Shokaran&quot;, &quot;Dayere Zangi&quot;, &quot;Aquarium&quot;, &quot;Cease Fire&quot;, &quot;No Men Allowed&quot;, &quot;The Changed Man&quot;, &quot;Charlatan&quot;, &quot;The Kingdom of Solomon&quot;, &quot;Guidance Patrol&quot;, &quot;Killing Mad Dogs&quot;, &quot;A Separation&quot; and Hush! Girls Don&#x27;t Scream were among the post-revolutionary films that gained the highest box office records.

For many years, the most visible face of Iranian commercial cinema was Mohammad Ali Fardin, who starred in a number of popular successful films. In the more conservative social climate of Iran after the Iranian Revolution of 1979, however, he came to be considered an embarrassment to Iranian national identity and his films — which depicted romance, alcohol, vulgarity, objectification of women, scantily-dressed men and women, nightclubs, and a vulgar lifestyle now condemned by the Islamic government — were banned. Although this would effectively prevent Fardin from making films for the remainder of his life, the ban did little to diminish his broad popularity with Iranian moviegoers: His funeral in Tehran was attended by 20,000 mourners. Before Fardin, one could argue, Iran simply did not have a commercial cinema.

During the war years, crime thrillers such as &quot;Senator&quot;, &quot;The Eagles&quot;, &quot;Boycott&quot;, &quot;The Tenants&quot;, and &quot;Kani Manga&quot; occupied the first position on the sales charts.

Officially, the Iranian government disdains American cinema: in 2007 President Ahmadinejad&#x27;s media adviser told the Fars news agency, &quot;We believe that the American cinema system is devoid of all culture and art and is only used as a device.&quot; However, numerous Western commercial films such as &quot;Jaws&quot;, &quot;The Illusionist&quot;, &quot;Passion of the Christ&quot;, &quot;House of Sand and Fog&quot;, &quot;Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow&quot;, &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;, &quot;Alpha and Omega&quot;, &quot;Scarface&quot;, &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, &quot;The Mechanic&quot;, and &quot;The Aviator&quot; have been screened in Iranian cinemas and Iranian film festivals since the revolution. Despite great pride in the country&#x27;s more than 100-year film history, Western cinema is enormously popular among Iran&#x27;s young people, and practically every recent Hollywood film is available on CD, DVD, or video. State television has also broadcast more Western movies—partly because millions of Iranians have been switching to the use of banned satellite television equipment.

===Iranian New Wave films===


Iranian New Wave refers to a new movement in Iranian cinema. According to film critic Eric Henderson, the acclaimed documentary &quot;The House Is Black&quot; (خانه سیاه است) directed by Forough Farrokhzad (famous Iranian poet and director) paved the way for the Iranian New Wave. The movement started in 1964 with Hajir Darioush&#x27;s second film &quot;Serpent&#x27;s Skin&quot;, which was based on D.H. Lawrence&#x27;s &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot; featuring Fakhri Khorvash and Jamshid Mashayekhi. Darioush&#x27;s two important early social documentaries &quot;But Problems Arose&quot; in 1965, dealing with the cultural alienation of the Iranian youth, and &quot;Face 75&quot;, a critical look at the westernization of the rural culture, which was a prizewinner at the 1965 Berlin Film Festival, were also contributing significantly to the establishment of the New Wave.

In 1968, after the release of Shohare Ahoo Khanoom directed by Davoud Mollapour, and the 1969 release of &quot;The Cow&quot; directed by Darius Mehrjui followed by Masoud Kimiai&#x27;s &quot;Qeysar&quot;, and Nasser Taqvai&#x27;s &quot;Tranquility in the Presence of Others&quot;, the New Wave became well established as a prominent cultural, dynamic and intellectual trend. The Iranian viewer became discriminating, encouraging the new trend to prosper and develop.
In the 1960s, there were &#x27;New Wave&#x27; movements in the cinema of numerous countries. The pioneers of the Iranian New Wave were directors like Forough Farrokhzad, Sohrab Shahid Saless, Bahram Beizai, and Parviz Kimiavi. They made innovative art films with highly political and philosophical tones and poetic language. Subsequent films of this type have become known as the New Iranian cinema to distinguish them from their earlier roots. The most notable figures of the Iranian New Wave are Abbas Kiarostami, Jafar Panahi, Majid Majidi, Bahram Beizai, Darius Mehrjui, Mohsen Makhmalbaf, Khosrow Sinai, Sohrab Shahid-Saless, Parviz Kimiavi, Samira Makhmalbaf, Amir Naderi, and Abolfazl Jalili.

The factors leading to the rise of the New Wave in Iran were, in part, due to the intellectual and political movements of the time. A romantic climate was developing after the 19 August 1953 coup in the sphere of arts. Alongside this, a socially committed literature took shape in the 1950s and reached a peak in the 1960s, which may consider as the golden era of contemporary Persian literature.

Features of New Wave Iranian film, in particular the works of legendary Abbas Kiarostami, can be classified as postmodern.

Iranian New Wave films shared some characteristics with the European art films of the period, in particular Italian Neorealism. However, in her article &#x27;Real Fictions&#x27;, Rose Issa argues that Iranian films have a distinctively Iranian cinematic language
:&quot;that champions the poetry in everyday life and the ordinary person by blurring the boundaries between fiction and reality, feature film with documentary.&quot; She also argues that this unique approach has inspired European cinema directors to emulate this style, citing Michael Winterbottom&#x27;s award winning &quot;In This World&quot; (2002) as an homage to contemporary Iranian cinema. Issa claims that &quot;This new, humanistic aesthetic language, determined by the film-makers’ individual and national identity, rather than the forces of globalism, has a strong creative dialogue not only on home ground but with audiences around the world.&quot;

In his book &quot;Close Up: Iranian Cinema, Past, Present, Future&quot; (2001) Hamid Dabashi describes modern Iranian cinema and the phenomenon of [&quot;Iranian&quot;] national cinema as a form of cultural modernity. According to Dabashi, &quot;the visual possibility of seeing the historical person (as opposed to the eternal Qur&#x27;anic man) on screen is arguably the single most important event allowing Iranians access to modernity.&quot;

While Beyzai and Taghvai represent the first generation and Karim-Masihi and Kiarostami represent the second generation of New wave filmmakers, the third generation is represented by Rafi Pitts, Bahman Ghobadi, Maziar Miri, Asghar Farhadi, Mani Haghighi, and Babak Payami, along with newly emerged filmmakers such as Saman Salur and Abdolreza Kahani.

===Iranian popular art films===
Parallel to the Iranian New Wave, with its neorealist and minimalist art cinema, there exists a so-called &quot;popular art cinema&quot; in Iran. Filmmakers who belong to this circle make films with a broader range of audience than the narrow spectrum of highly educated people who admire the New Wave, but believe that their movies are also artistically sound. Filmmakers such as Nasser Taghvaee and Ali Hatami are the best examples of this cinematic movement (some of these filmmakers also make new wave films e.g. &quot;Mum&#x27;s Guest&quot; by Darius Mehrjui). The Demon and the Bald Hassan, Adam and Eve, The Fisherman&#x27;s Story, City of Oranges, and Talisman are some of Hatami&#x27;s works.

===Iranian women&#x27;s cinema===
Following the rise of the Iranian New Wave, there are now record numbers of film school graduates in Iran and each year more than 20 new directors make their debut films, many of them women. In the last two decades, there have been a higher percentage of women directors in Iran than in most countries in the West.
Samira Makhmalbaf directed her first film, &quot;The Apple&quot;, when she was only 17 years old and won the Cannes Jury Prize in 2000 for her following film &quot;The Blackboard&quot;.

The success and hard work of the pioneering Rakhshan Bani-Etemad is an example that many women directors in Iran were following much before Samira Makhmalbaf made the headlines and the current Tahmineh Milani, Niki Karimi. Internationally recognized figures in Iranian women&#x27;s cinema are:
* Marjane Satrapi in 2008 Nominated Oscar Best Animated Feature Film of the Year Award. In 2006, became a member of the Cannes Film festival Jury.

===Iranian war films===
War cinema in Iran was born simultaneously with the beginning of Iran–Iraq War. However, it took many years until it found its way and identity by defining characteristics of &quot;Iranian war cinema&quot;.
In the Alleys of Love (1990), by Khosrow Sinai, shows the most poematic view on the Iran Iraq war and still after years, is one of the leading films about this historical event from a humanistic aspect, although unlike other Iranian war cinema which are fully supported by the Iranian government this film was made with numerous difficulties.
In the past decades, the Iranian film industry has produced many war films. In the Iranian war film genre, war has often been portrayed as glorious and &quot;holy&quot;, bringing out the good in the protagonist and pandering to nationalist sentiments with propagandistic messaging. &quot;Tears of Cold&quot; and &quot;Duel&quot; were two films that have gone beyond the traditional view of war.
Many renowned directors were involved in developing &quot;Iranian war cinema&quot;:
* Morteza Avini &quot;(Famous TV Documentary: Ravayat-e Fath)&quot;

===Iranian animations===

There are some evidences suggesting that Ancient Iranians made animations. An animated piece on an earthen goblet made 5000 years ago was found in Burnt City in Sistan-Baluchistan province, southeastern Iran. The artist has portrayed a goat that jumps toward a tree and eats its leaves.

The first Tehran International Animation Festival was held in the year 1999, four decades after the time the production of first animation films in Iran. The Second Tehran International Animation Festival was held in February 2001. Apart from Iranian films, animations from 35 foreign countries participated in the festival.

The following are among the notable filmmakers of Iranian animated films:

* Noureddin Zarrin-Kelk
* Bahram Azimi
* Ali Akbar Sadeghi

===Children and youth films===
Although early attempts also existed, the Iranian children and youth cinema came of age with acclaimed director Mohammad Ali Talebi (b. 1958). He started his career in the 1980s and achieved success beyond Iran with &quot;Bag of Rice&quot; (1997) and &quot;Willow and Wind&quot; (2000), whose script was written by Abbas Kiarostami.

Talebi believed that producing movies for children and teenagers was a service to “the most fragile and vulnerable of the Iranian society.” In the 2010s, he became somewhat skeptical about the future of children and youth cinema in Iran, and in 2018 moved to Slovakia.

==Influence of Iranians on others&#x27; New Wave films==
Amongst the pioneers of French New Wave were François Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, Claude Chabrol and Eric Rohmer or Barbet Schroeder (born in Tehran, Iran in 1941 where his German geologist Father was on assignment).

During the first half of the 20th century, France was the major destination for Iranian students who wished to study abroad. Iranian ambassador to the United Nations Fereydoun Hoveyda was one of them. Fereydoun Hoveyda played a major role in French cultural scene and especially in the field of Cinema, for he was the protégé of François Truffaut whom he befriended and with whom he helped create the well-known film magazine &quot;Les Cahiers du Cinéma&quot; that spearheaded the French Nouvelle Vague or New Wave Cinema. He also worked closely with Italian film director Roberto Rossellini on several film scripts during that period. Fereydoun Hoveyda was not the only Iranian of his generation to play an active role in promoting the French Cinéma d&#x27;Auteur. Youssef Ishaghpour is another example.

Another Iranian figure in French New Wave was Shusha Guppy a singer, writer and filmmaker who was Jacques Prévert&#x27;s girlfriend. However, the most important contribution to the French New Wave cinema is that of Serge Rezvani an Iranian poet born in Tehran in 1928. He played a major role as music composer of both François Truffaut &quot;Jules et Jim&quot; and Jean-Luc Godard &quot;Pierrot le Fou&quot;, considered as landmarks of French New Wave Cinema.

Farah Diba studied at the Beaux Arts and became the focus of attention and the French press was to see her as the new Persian Cinderella. Farah Diba was one of the rare foreign dignitaries to become a permanent member of the French Académie des Beaux-Arts.

Iranian Robert Hossein (son of legendary musician Aminollah Hossein) started his acting career with his French Armenian friend Chahnour Varinag Aznavourian (known as the famed crooner Charles Aznavour) in the mid fifties essentially type cast as &quot;Mr. Tough Guy&quot;. However he got international acclaim in the early Sixties particularly in Europe, Russia and Asia as the mysterious &quot;Jeoffrey, Comte de Peyrac&quot; lover of the lovely Michèle Mercier in the soft erotic-adventure film series of &quot;Angélique Marquise des Anges&quot;. In the seventies and eighties he was to play opposite Jean-Paul Belmondo in police thrillers like &quot;The Professional&quot;. Hossein became known for being a talented theater director and his taste for popular historical vehicles involving large sets and numerous actors.

After the resignation of French president Charles de Gaulle, Iranian Anicée Shahmanesh became known under the screen name Anicée Alvina, playing a French girl in a British film hit called &quot;Friends&quot;, the music score of which propelled British pop star Elton John. She was also to take on a courageous lesbian role in the screen adaptation of Françoise Mallet-Joris&#x27; novel &quot;Le Rempart des Béguines&quot;.

Two major documentaries were produced in these years by respectively Agnès Varda and the duo Claude Lelouch and Claude Pinoteau:
*Agnès Varda, first to be discovered to young actor Gérard Depardieu in her 1970 film &quot;Nausicaa&quot;, directed a love story set in Isfahan (1976) between a French woman (Valérie Mairesse) visiting Iran as a tourist and her guide an Iranian Man (Ali Raffi). The film was entitled &quot;Plaisir D&#x27;Amour en Iran&quot;. The romantic film was shot on location in &quot;The Masjed Shah&quot;.
*Claude Pinoteau and Claude Lelouch on the other hand shot their documentary just after the Persepolis Celebrations in 1971. They decided to address the urban transformations and cultural emancipation that the country was subject to by the early seventies.

Several Iranian expats such as Philippe Khorsand or Persian play writer/actor Yasmina Reza have also gained notice in recent years. The latter is particularly known for her highly intellectual introspection in such plays like &quot;Art&quot; (for which Sean Connery bought the film rights, advised by his French wife).

==Music in Iranian cinema==
Although Iranian composers usually have their own special style and music structure, they all share one thing: melodic, lively rhythms. That might be because they often begin with folkloric songs and shift to film music. In the past few decades, a few composers have emerged in the Iranian cinema with highly appraised works. Composers like Hormoz Farhat, Morteza Hannaneh, Fariborz Lachini, Ahmad Pejman, Majid Entezami, Babak Bayat, Karen Homayounfar, Naser Cheshmazar and Hossein Alizadeh were some of the most successful score composers for Iranian films in the past decades.

==Iranian international film festivals==

Great filmmakers such as Francesco Rosi, Michelangelo Antonioni Grigori Kozintsev, Elizabeth Taylor, Pietro Germi, Nikita Mikhalkov, Krzysztof Zanussi, and Martin Ritt won the festival&#x27;s awards.

In its early years it had a competition section for professional as well as amateur film (8 mm, 16 mm). Since 1990, there has been an international along with the national competition.

==Censorship==

Although the Iranian film industry is flourishing, its filmmakers have operated under censorship rules, both before and after the revolution. Some Iranian films that have been internationally acclaimed are banned in Iran itself. Conversely, some Iranian filmmakers have faced hostility in other countries.

===Censorship within Iran===
Dariush Mehrjui&#x27;s seminal film &quot;Gaav&quot; (&quot;The Cow&quot;, 1969) is now considered a pioneering work of the Iranian New Wave. The film was sponsored by the state, but they promptly banned it upon completion because its vision of rural life clashed with the progressive image of Iran that the Shah wished to project, while its prominence at international film festivals annoyed the regime.

After the Iranian revolution, filmmakers experienced more restrictions. Since the mid-1980s, Iran&#x27;s policy on film censorship has been changed in order to promote domestic film production: the strict censorship eased after December 1987. Old directors resurfaced and new ones emerged. However, the application of the rules is often inconsistent. Several films have been refused release inside Iran, but have been given export permits to enter international film festivals. Even here, the censorship is inconsistent: &quot;May Lady&quot; by Rakhshan Bani-Etemad (1998) got through but her contribution to &quot;Stories of Kish&quot; (1999) did not.

All of Jafar Panahi&#x27;s films have been banned from public theaters in Iran. &quot;Offside&quot; was relegated to &quot;a guest slot&quot; at the International Fajr Film Festival. &quot;It was not shown as an important film&quot;, says Panahi. &quot;They didn&#x27;t give any value to it.&quot; Several of Mohsen Makhmalbaf&#x27;s films are also banned in Iran. For example, &quot;Time of Love&quot; and &quot;The night of Zaiandeh-rood&quot; were banned for dealing with physical love and for raising doubts about the revolution.
In 2001, feminist filmmaker Tahmineh Milani who made The Hidden Half was jailed because her movie was presumed anti-revolution (against the 1979 Islamic revolution). Many Iranian and international artists and filmmakers demanded her release. After 8 days of imprisonment, eventually President Khatami and the minister of culture were able to secure her release. In &quot;Nargess&quot;, Rakhshan Bani-Etemad who is a pioneer among female Iranian film directors, pushes censorship codes to the limits, questioning the morals of society, showing desperate people overwhelmed by social conditions and a couple living together without being married.

Abbas Kiarostami was significantly acclaimed in Europe but the Islamic government has refused screening of his films in his own country. Kiarostami&#x27;s films have been banned in his country for more than 10 years. They are only accessible there through unauthorized DVDs and private screenings. Kiarostami is uncertain what the government dislikes about his films, saying &quot;I think they don&#x27;t understand my films and so they prevent them being shown just in case there is a message they don&#x27;t want to get out.&quot;. Despite this, Kiarostami has displayed an extraordinarily benign perspective, at least in recorded interviews: &quot;The government is not in my way, but it is not assisting me either. We lead our separate lives.&quot; Despite the censorship, Kiarostami insists on working in Iran, saying &quot;I think I really produce my best work in Iran.&quot; He believes that throughout the ages and all over the world censorship has existed in one form or another and artists have managed to live with this, saying &quot;Today, the most important thing is that, although there is censorship, Iranian filmmakers are doing their job and they surpass the difficulties of censorship showing and discussing many things. So why ask me about what&#x27;s not in the films? It has happened many times that a filmmaker hides a weakness under the excuse of censorship but difficulties have always existed in our lifestyle and our role is to surpass them.&quot; The director Mohammed Rasoulof, was convicted of charges relating to state security and anti-government propaganda. In 2009 and 2013 the number of political films and drama like &quot;Khers&quot;, &quot;Guidance Patrol&quot;, &quot;The Wooden Bridge&quot;, &quot;I am a Mother&quot; and &quot;Private Life&quot; (Zendegi Khosoosi) were Sanctioned.

=== House of Cinema temporary closure ===
In September 2011, House of Cinema issued a statement in support of several filmmakers detained for contact with the BBC. They questioned the legal basis for the arrests, pointing out that the government itself has contact with international news organizations. As a result, they received an official rebuke.

In December 2011, Iran&#x27;s Council of Public Culture declared its ‘House of Cinema’, the country&#x27;s largest professional organisation for film makers, illegal. Authorities state the organization was shut down because of secret amendments to its charter. House of Cinema came under pressure when it challenged the detention of filmmakers accused of selling films to the BBC.

In September 2013, House of Cinema has been reopened by the new government.

===Hostility outside Iran===
Given the tense relationship between Iran and the United States, Iranian filmmakers have faced hostility there, even if they have also been banned in their own country. Abbas Kiarostami was refused a visa to attend the New York Film Festival, Ohio University and Harvard University in 2002, in the wake of the September 11 attacks. Festival director Richard Pena, who had invited him, said: &quot;It&#x27;s a terrible sign of what&#x27;s happening in my country today that no one seems to realize or care about the kind of negative signal this sends out to the entire Muslim world&quot;. Finnish film director Aki Kaurismäki boycotted the festival in protest. Similarly, Bahman Ghobadi, winner of the Golden Plaque at the Chicago International Film Festival, refused to accept the prize in protest of the U.S. government&#x27;s refusal to issue him a visa. In 2007, Ahmed Issawi, the abashed Arab director of the New York South Asian Film Festival admitted that a conscious decision was made not to invite any Iranian filmmakers, saying &quot;That&#x27;s a territory I no longer want to tread [...] It&#x27;s over. Given the whole thing with Iran—I refuse to approach it.&quot;

Several other Iranian filmmakers have experienced hostilities from other countries. In November 2001 in Afghanistan, Taliban officials, who banned movies and most filmmaking, arrested three of Majid Majidi&#x27;s crew members who were helping him secretly shoot Barefoot to Herat, a documentary on the country&#x27;s internal refugees. Samira Makhmalbaf also survived a kidnapping in Afghanistan. {West, Dennis and Makhmalbaf, Mohsen. &quot;I Make Cinema in Order to Breathe: An Interview with Mohsen Makhmalbaf&quot;. &quot;Cinéaste&quot;. 34.4, Fall 2009: 10–15. JSTOR Web. 24 Apr. 2014}

In March 2007, a bomb explosion severely injuring several actors and crew members halted production in Afghanistan of &quot;Two Legged Horse&quot;, the film by Iranian helmer Samira Makhmalbaf. Mohsen Makhmalbaf was the target of two unsuccessful murder attempts when he shot &quot;Kandahar&quot; in Iran near the Afghan border in 2000, and his daughter Hana was twice the victim of a failed abduction attempt during the shooting of Samira&#x27;s last film &quot;At Five in the Afternoon&quot; in the Afghan capital Kabul in 2002.

=== Arresting filmmakers ===
On 1 March 2010, Jafar Panahi was arrested. He was taken from his home along with his wife Tahereh Saidi, daughter Solmaz Panahi, and 15 of his friends by plain-clothes officers to Evin Prison. Most were released 48 hours later, Mohammad Rasoulof and Mehdi Pourmoussa on 17 March 2010, but Panahi remained in section 209 inside Evin Prison. Panahi&#x27;s arrest was confirmed by the government, but the charges were not specified. On April 14, 2010, Iran&#x27;s Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance said that Panahi was arrested because he &quot;tried to make a documentary about the unrest that followed the disputed 2009 re-election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.&quot;On 18 May, Panahi sent a message to Abbas Baktiari, director of the Pouya Cultural Center, an Iranian-French cultural organization in Paris, stating that he was being mistreated in prison and his family threatened and as a result had begun a hunger strike. On 25 May, he was released on $200,000 bail while awaiting trial. On 20 December 2010, Panahi, after being convicted for &quot;assembly and colluding with the intention to commit crimes against the country’s national security and propaganda against the Islamic Republic,&quot; the Islamic Revolutionary Court sentenced Panahi to six years imprisonment and a 20-year ban on making or directing any movies, writing screenplays, giving any form of interview with Iranian or foreign media as well as leaving the country except for Hajj holy pilgrimage to Mecca or medical treatment. Panahi&#x27;s colleague, Mohammad Rasoulof also received six years imprisonment but was later reduced to one year on appeal. On October 15, 2011, a court in Tehran upheld Panahi&#x27;s sentence and ban. Following the courts decision, Panahi was placed under house arrest. He has since been allowed to move more freely but he cannot travel outside Iran.

Hossein Rajabian, an Iranian independent filmmaker, After finishing his first feature film, was arrested by Iranian security forces on 5 October 2013 outside his office [in Sari] alongside two musicians, and was transferred to Ward 2-A of Evin Prison where all three of them were held in solitary confinement for more than two months and were threatened with televised confessions. He was released on bail (around $66,000) in mid-December, pending trial. Two years later, his case was heard at Branch 28 of Tehran Revolutionary Court which was presided over by Judge Moghisseh (Summer 2015). He was sentenced to six years in prison and fines for pursuing illegal cinematic activities, launching propaganda against the establishment and hurling insults at sanctities. On appeal, his sentence was changed to three years imprisonment and three years of suspended jail and fines. Hossein Rajabian was sent to the ward 7 of Evin Prison in Tehran. After spending one third of his total period of imprisonment (that is 11 months), he went on hunger strike to protest against unjust trial, lack of medical facilities, and transfer of his brother to another ward called section 8 of the same prison. During the first hunger strike period, which lasted 14 days, he was transferred to hospital because of pulmonary infection and he could not continue his hunger strike because of the interference of the representative of the prosecutor who was sent as an intermediary. After some time, he sent an open letter to the judicial authorities of Iran and went again on strike which brought him the supports of international artists. After 36 days of hunger strike, he could convince the judicial authorities of Iran to review his case and grant him medical leave for the treatment of his left kidney suffered from infections and blood arising out of hunger strike. He, after a contentious struggle with the judicial officer of the prison was sent to the ward 8 for punishment.

<text>Pandanus is a genus of monocots with about 578 accepted species. They are palm-like, dioecious trees and shrubs native to the Old World tropics and subtropics. Common names include pandan, screw palm and screw pine. They are classified in the order Pandanales, family Pandanaceae. &quot;Pandanus&quot; is the largest genus of the Pandanaceae. 

== Description ==
The species vary in size from small shrubs less than tall, to medium-sized trees tall, typically with a broad canopy, heavy fruit, and moderate growth rate. The trunk is stout, wide-branching, and ringed with many leaf scars. Mature plants can have branches. Depending on the species, the trunk can be smooth, rough, or warty. The roots form a pyramidal tract to hold the trunk. They commonly have many thick stilt roots near the base, which provide support as the tree grows top-heavy with leaves, fruit, and branches. These roots are adventitious and often branched. The top of the plant has one or more crowns of strap-shaped leaves that may be spiny, varying between species from to or longer, and from up to broad.

They are dioecious, with male and female flowers produced on different plants. The flowers of the male tree are long and fragrant, surrounded by narrow, white bracts. The female tree produces flowers with round fruits that are also bract-surrounded. The individual fruit is a drupe, and these merge to varying degrees forming multiple fruit, a globule structure, in diameter and have many prism-like sections, resembling the fruit of the pineapple. Typically, the fruit changes from green to bright orange or red as it matures. The fruits can stay on the tree for more than 12 months.

== Evolution ==
The oldest fossil of the genus is &quot;Pandanus estellae&quot;, which is known from a silicified fruit found in Queensland, Australia, dating to the Oligocene epoch around 32–28 million years ago. Phylogenetic analyses of the maternal DNA of &quot;Pandanus&quot; has shown the genus to be divided into two large groups (Clade I and Clade II), with each of those groups further subdivided into two smaller groups (Subclade Ia, Subclade Ib, Subclade IIa, and Subclade IIb). The split between Clades I and II was determined to have occurred during the early Miocene, whereas the splits between Subclade Ia and Ib and between Subclade IIa and IIb were determined to have occurred during the Middle Miocene Climatic Optimum.

== Taxonomy ==
Though often called &quot;pandanus palms&quot;, these plants are not closely related to palm trees. The genus is named after the Malay word &quot;pandan&quot; given to &quot;Pandanus amaryllifolius,&quot; the genus&#x27;s most commonly known species. The name is derived from Proto-Austronesian (which became Proto-Malayo-Polynesian *pangdan and Proto-Oceanic *padran). It has many cognates in Austronesian languages, underscoring its importance in Austronesian cultures, including Atayal &quot;pangran&quot;; Kavalan &quot;pangzan&quot;; Thao &quot;panadan&quot;; Tagalog &quot;pandan&quot;; Chamorro &quot;pahong&quot;; Manggarai &quot;pandang&quot;; Malagasy &quot;fandrana,&quot; Tongan &quot;fā&quot;; Tahitian &quot;fara&quot;; Hawaiian &quot;hala&quot; all referring to plants of similar characteristics and/or uses whether in the same genus (particularly &quot;Pandanus tectorius&quot;) or otherwise (in the case of Māori &quot;whara&quot; or &quot;hara;&quot; e.g. hara&quot;keke&quot;). &quot;Pandanus&quot; is traditionally divided into six subgenera (&quot;Coronata&quot;, &quot;Kurzia&quot;, &quot;Lophostigma&quot;, &quot;Pandanus,&quot; &quot;Rykia,&quot; and &quot;Vinsonia&quot;), however molecular phylogenetic analyses have shown these subgenera to not represent the true evolutionary history of &quot;Pandanus&quot; as all but &quot;Coronata&quot; are either polyphyletic or paraphyletic.

=== Selected species ===

Note: several species previously placed in &quot;Pandanus&quot; subgenera &quot;Acrostigma&quot; and &quot;Martellidendron&quot; are now in the distinct genera &quot;Benstonea&quot; and &quot;Martellidendron&quot;, respectively.

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;Pandanus&quot; is a Paleotropical genus. The greatest number of species are found in Madagascar and Malaysia.

==Ecology==
These plants grow from sea level to an altitude of . Pandanus trees are of cultural, health, and economic importance in the Pacific, second only to the coconut on atolls. They grow wild mainly in semi-natural vegetation in littoral habitats throughout the tropical and subtropical Pacific, where they can withstand drought, strong winds, and salt spray. They propagate readily from seed, but popular cultivars are also widely propagated from branch cuttings by local people.

Species growing on exposed coastal headlands and along beaches have thick &#x27;stilt roots&#x27; as anchors in the loose sand. Those stilt roots emerge from the stem, usually close to but above the ground, which helps to keep the plants upright and secure them to the ground.

While &quot;Pandanus&quot; are distributed throughout the tropical and subtropical islands and coastlines of the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans, they are most numerous on the low islands and barren atolls of Polynesia and Micronesia. Other species are adapted to mountain habitats and riverine forests.

The tree is grown and propagated from shoots that form spontaneously in the axils of lower leaves. Pandanus fruits are eaten by animals including bats, rats, crabs, and elephants, but the vast majority of species are dispersed primarily by water. Its fruit can float and spread to other islands without help from humans.

Climate and soil analyses based on a molecular phylogenetic framework have shown that the largest split in &quot;Pandanus&quot; (between Clades I and II) is also associated with a difference in climate and soil conditions between the two groups. Clade II &quot;Pandanus&quot; species are associated with more seasonal temperature and precipitation regimes, and more well-draining soils, than Clade I &quot;Pandanus&quot; species. In addition, this split is also associated with the occurrence of specialized layer of water storage tissue (also known as hydrenchyma) in Clade II species of &quot;Pandanus&quot; that is thought to aid in their adaptation to more water-stressed environments.

==Uses==
&quot;Pandanus&quot; has multiple uses, which is dependent in part on each type and location. Some &quot;Pandanus&quot; are a source of food, while others provide raw material for clothing, basket weaving and shelter. 

&quot;Pandanus&quot; leaves are used for handicrafts. Artisans collect the leaves from plants in the wild, cutting only mature leaves so that the plant will naturally regenerate. The leaves are sliced into fine strips and sorted for further processing. Weavers produce basic pandan mats of standard size or roll the leaves into pandan ropes for other designs. This is followed by a coloring process, in which pandan mats are placed in drums with water-based colors. After drying, the colored mats are shaped into final products, such as placemats or jewelry boxes. Final color touch-ups may be applied. The species in Hawaiʻi are called &quot;hala&quot;, and only the dry leaves &quot;(lauhala)&quot; are collected and used for Lauhala weaving. Traditions of weaving pandanus to source fabric material were widespread among Polynesians even as they migrated reaching colder latitudes (like the islands of New Zealand) where no pandanus grew, which later Māori generations simply adapted their skills with native plants like &quot;Phormium&quot; having superficially similar properties, even reflected in their names (e.g. the aforementioned &quot;harakeke&quot;, and &quot;wharariki&quot;).

&quot;Pandanus&quot; leaves from &quot;Pandanus amaryllifolius&quot; are used widely in Southeast Asian and South Asian cuisines to add a distinct aroma to various dishes and to complement flavors like chocolate. Because of their similarity in usage, pandan leaves are sometimes referred to as the &quot;vanilla of Asia.&quot; Fresh leaves are typically torn into strips, tied in a knot to facilitate removal, placed in the cooking liquid, then removed at the end of cooking. Dried leaves and bottled extract may be bought in some places. Finely sliced pandan leaves are used as fragrant confetti for Malay weddings, graves etc.

Pandan leaves are known as &quot;Daun pandan&quot; in Indonesian and Malaysian Malay; &quot;Dahon ng pandan&quot; (lit. &quot;pandan leaf&quot;) or simply &quot;pandan&quot; in Filipino; 斑蘭 (&quot;bān lán&quot;) in Mandarin; as ใบเตย (&quot;bai toei&quot;; ) in Thai, &quot;lá dứa&quot; in Vietnamese; &quot;pulao data&quot; in Bengali; and &quot;rampe&quot; in Sinhalese and Hindi.

In India, particularly in Nicobar Islands, pandanus fruit is staple food of Shompen people and Nicobarese people.

In Sri Lanka, pandan leaves are used heavily in both vegetable and meat dishes and are often grown in homes. It is common practice to add a few pieces of pandan leaf when cooking red or white rice as well.

In Southeast Asia, pandan leaves are mainly used in sweets such as coconut jam and pandan cake. In Indonesia and Malaysia, pandan is also added to rice and curry dishes such as &quot;nasi lemak&quot;. In the Philippines, pandan leaves are commonly paired with coconut meat (a combination referred to as &quot;buko pandan&quot;) in various desserts and drinks like &quot;maja blanca&quot; and &quot;gulaman&quot;.

In Indian cooking, the leaf is added whole to biryani, a kind of rice pilaf, made with ordinary rice (as opposed to that made with the premium-grade basmati rice). The basis for this use is that both basmati and pandan leaf contains the same aromatic flavoring ingredient, 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline. In Sri Lanka, pandan leaves are a major ingredient used in the country&#x27;s cuisine.

&quot;Kewra&quot; (also spelled &quot;Kevda&quot; or &quot;Kevada&quot;) is an extract distilled from the pandan flower, used to flavor drinks and desserts in Indian cuisine. Also, &quot;kewra&quot; or &quot;kevada&quot; is used in religious worship, and the leaves are used to make hair ornaments worn for their fragrance as well as decorative purpose in western India.

Species with large and medium fruit are edible, notably the many cultivated forms of &quot;P. tectorius&quot; (&quot;P. pulposus&quot;) and &quot;P. utilis&quot;. The ripe fruit can be eaten raw or cooked, while partly ripe fruit should be cooked first. Small-fruited pandanus may be bitter and astringent.

Karuka nuts (&quot;P. julianettii&quot;) are an important staple food in New Guinea. Over 45 cultivated varieties are known. Entire households will move, and in some areas will speak a pandanus language at harvest time. The taste is like coconut or walnuts.

Throughout Oceania, almost every part of the plant is used, with various species different from those used in Southeast Asian cooking. &quot;Pandanus&quot; trees provide materials for housing; clothing and textiles including the manufacture of dilly bags (carrying bags), fine mats or &quot;ie toga&quot;; sails, food, medication, decorations, fishing, and religious uses. In the Vanuatu Archipelago, natives make woven fish traps from the hard interior root of the pandanus, made like a cage having a narrow entrance.

<text>John Lee Thompson (1 August 1914 – 30 August 2002) was an English film director, screenwriter and producer. Initially an exponent of social realism, he became known as a versatile and prolific director of thrillers, action, and adventure films.

His works included mainstream critical and commercial successes like &quot;Woman in a Dressing Gown&quot; (1957), &quot;Ice Cold in Alex&quot; (1958), &quot;Tiger Bay&quot; (1959), &quot;North West Frontier&quot; (also 1959), &quot;The Guns of Navarone&quot; (1961), the original &quot;Cape Fear&quot; (1962), and &quot;Mackenna&#x27;s Gold&quot; (1969). He also directed cult classics like the &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; sequels, &quot;The White Buffalo&quot; (1977), &quot;Happy Birthday to Me&quot; (1981), &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot; (1985) and several Charles Bronson vehicles for Cannon Films in the 1980s. 

Thompson received an Academy Award nomination for an Best Director for &quot;The Guns of Navarone.&quot; He was also a four-time BAFTA Award nominee (twice for Best Film and twice for Outstanding British Film). He also received accolades from the Berlin International Film Festival and the Cannes Film Festival, and was both a Golden Globe and Directors Guild of America Award nominee.

==Early life==
Thompson was born in the Bristol suburb of Westbury on Trym on 1 August 1914. His family had links to the theatre. Thompson studied at Dover College then went to work in the theatre, joining the Nottingham Repertory Company as an actor and stagehand. He later went to work for a repertory company in Croydon, Surrey.

He wrote plays in his spare time, and had started when he was nine. One of them, &quot;Murder Happens?&quot; was performed at Croydon in 1934. His second staged play, &quot;Double Error&quot;, had a brief West End run at the Fortune Theatre in 1935. An article from this time about the play said he had written 40 plays already, including four in between his first two staged plays. A company worth £10,000 was formed to exploit Thompson&#x27;s writings over the next seven years but this appears to have not had a long life.

Thompson later said he had written a part for himself to perform, but when management asked him if he wanted to do so he said &quot;of course not,&quot; and &quot;the die was cast. Later I decided if I didn&#x27;t have the guts to admit I wanted to play the role I should never act again and I never did.&quot;

===Screenwriter===
The film rights to &quot;Double Error&quot; were purchased for £100. Thompson was hired to work in the scriptwriting department at British International Pictures at Elstree Studios. While there he made his one appearance as an actor in films, playing a small role in &quot;Midshipman Easy&quot; (1935).

His first credit was &quot;The Price of Folly&quot; (1937), based on his play. He also worked on the scripts for &quot;Glamorous Night&quot; (1937), and he worked as dialogue coach on &quot;Jamaica Inn&quot; (1939), directed by Alfred Hitchcock.

He wrote the scripts for &quot;The Middle Watch&quot; (1940), made at Associated British Picture Corporation (ABPC) and &quot;East of Piccadilly&quot; (1941).

===World War II===
Thompson served in World War II as a tailgunner and wireless operator in the RAF. In 1942 a revised version of &quot;Double Error&quot;, titled &quot;Murder Without Crime&quot;, opened at the Comedy Theatre in London. The play had a run on Broadway in 1943.

===Post War===
After the war Thompson returned to his work as scriptwriter under contract at Associated British on such films as &quot;No Place for Jennifer&quot; (1949) and &quot;For Them That Trespass&quot; (1949), the latter starring Richard Todd in his debut.

Thompson was dialogue director on &quot;The Hasty Heart&quot; (1949), which turned Todd into a star. He later said he gave up dialogue directing because he found the job &quot;impossible. My job was to take stars through their lines but I felt that I was also expected to be a spy for the front office. If a word was altered they wanted to know why. It was a way of keeping control.&quot;

The same year his play &quot;The Human Touch&quot;, co-written with Dudley Leslie, ran for more than a hundred performances at the Savoy Theatre in a production starring Alec Guinness.

==British film director==

===Early films===
His first film as a director was &quot;Murder Without Crime&quot; (1950), made at ABPC, who put Thompson under contract. Thompson was offered £500 for the screen rights to the play and £500 to direct. He said &quot;it was not so much that I wanted to direct movies it was to get the money so I could continue writing plays. But while directing it I got the feeling that I wanted to be a movie director.&quot;

Thompson said &quot;the fact is I found directing to be much easier than writing and I enjoyed it much more than writing as well. So I became a film director.&quot;

The film was about a man who thinks he has committed murder. Thompson also wrote the screenplay, based on his own play &quot;Double Error&quot;. In the words of Thompson&#x27;s Screenonline profile &quot;this well structured film went largely unnoticed but contained many of the themes which were to characterise Lee Thompson&#x27;s work: a good person&#x27;s struggle with their conscience, an external force of evil, and an out-of-character moment of violence which has long-term consequences. Believing people can &quot;commit crimes without being criminals&quot;, he sought to make his audiences condone or at least understand behaviour that they would normally condemn.&quot;

Thompson&#x27;s first film success was one he directed and co-wrote (with Anne Burnaby), &quot;The Yellow Balloon&quot; (1953), the story of a child who is blackmailed into helping a criminal after accidentally causing his friend&#x27;s death.

He followed it with a comedy, &quot;For Better, For Worse&quot; (1954) starring Dirk Bogarde, which was even more popular though it is little remembered today.

===Social Realist films===
Thompson&#x27;s fourth film as director &quot;The Weak and the Wicked&quot; (1954), portrays the lives of women in prison and is based on memoirs by Joan Henry, who became Thompson&#x27;s second wife. Thompson wrote the script, again in collaboration with Anne Burnaby. It starred Glynis Johns and Diana Dors and was a hit at the box office. The success of the film greatly added to Thompson&#x27;s prestige and he began to be regarded as one of the leading directors in the country.

Thompson was loaned to Rank Films to direct a Jack Buchanan comedy, &quot;As Long as They&#x27;re Happy&quot; (1955), co-starring Dors and &quot;An Alligator Named Daisy&quot; (1955), also starring Dors, along with Donald Sinden. Thompson said &quot;he didn&#x27;t like the subjects&quot; of their film &quot;but here was the opportunity to work with another worldbeater - Jeannie Carson.&quot; He returned to ABPC and the theme of female prisoners in &quot;Yield to the Night&quot; (1956), an anti-capital punishment tale with Diana Dors as the condemned prisoner.

Thompson later said the &quot;pattern&quot; of his ABPC films was &quot;two pieces of tepid rubbish for one decent project – if I could persuade Robert Clark, who was head of production. He used to wring his hands when I insisted. &#x27;Okay,&#x27; he&#x27;d finally say. &#x27;Do it if you must. But it won&#x27;t make money.&#x27; I admired him for that really. He did give you a bit of a chance.&quot;

&quot;The Good Companions&quot; (1957) was lighter fare, based on a book by J. B. Priestley. According to one obituary Thompson &quot;made excellent use of the CinemaScope screen, assembled a fine supporting cast and, with zestful choreography... came up with one of the few successes in a genre for which the British cinema was not noted.&quot;

&quot;Woman in a Dressing Gown&quot; (1957), with Yvonne Mitchell, Anthony Quayle and Sylvia Syms and written by Ted Willis, deals with the collapse of a 20-year marriage. It was a major critical and commercial success, one of the one of the most popular at the British box office in 1957. Several modern critics have cited it as a prototypical version of Kitchen sink realism and precursor to the British New Wave. It won the 1958 Golden Globe Award for Best English-Language Foreign Film.

===Action director===
Thompson had a big success with &quot;Ice Cold in Alex&quot; (1958), the story of a British Army unit trekking across North Africa in the Second World War. It featured John Mills, Sylvia Syms, Anthony Quayle and Harry Andrews. It won three BAFTA Awards, including Best British Film. He followed it with &quot;North West Frontier&quot; (1959), an adventure film set in British India starring Kenneth More and Lauren Bacall. It was one of the most popular films in Britain in 1959.

&quot;No Trees in the Street&quot; (1959) was a thriller written by Willis. Also in that genre was &quot;Tiger Bay&quot; (1959), starring John Mills. It introduced cinema audiences to Mills&#x27; daughter Hayley and German actor Horst Buchholz. Hayley Mills also earned a BAFTA for Most Promising Newcomer portraying a 12-year-old girl who refuses to betray a sailor accused of murder.

Thompson followed this with &quot;I Aim at the Stars&quot; (1960).

==Hollywood career==
===&quot;Guns of Navarone&quot; and &quot;Cape Fear&quot;===
Thompson vaulted to international fame with &quot;The Guns of Navarone&quot; (1961) as a last-minute replacement for director Alexander Mackendrick. His take-charge attitude during its production earned him the nickname &#x27;Mighty Mouse&#x27; from lead actor Gregory Peck. Co-star Anthony Quinn said Thompson:
Never read a scene until he had to shoot it and approached each shot on a whim. And yet the cumulative effect was astonishing. Lee Thompson made a marvelous picture but how? Perhaps his inventiveness lay in defying convention, in rejecting the accepted methods of motion picture making and establishing his own. Perhaps it was in his very formlessness that he found the one form he could sustain, and nurture, the one form that could, in turn, sustain and nurture him. Perhaps he was just a lucky Englishman who pulled a good picture out of his ass.
&quot;The Guns of Navarone&quot;, a World War II epic filmed on location in Rhodes, Greece, was nominated for seven Academy Awards including Thompson for Best Director. In 1961 he said &quot;primarily I am in the business to entertain. This does not mean that I never want to try artistic movies again. But I do not think you can sell art on the big movie circuits. Art belongs in the art houses.&quot; Later he said &quot;I liked the character bits best&quot; about &quot;Navarone&quot;. &quot;Anyone can make an explosion.&quot;

The success of &quot;Navarone&quot; won him entry into Hollywood, where he directed &quot;Cape Fear&quot; (1962), a psychological thriller with Gregory Peck, Robert Mitchum, Polly Bergen and Lori Martin; Peck and Mitchum co-producing the film. Based on a novel called &quot;The Executioners&quot; by John D. MacDonald, &quot;Cape Fear&quot; shows how a sex offender can manipulate the justice system and terrorise an entire family. Highly controversial for its time, the film was cut heavily in both the United States and the United Kingdom.

He worked on a project with Warren Beatty and Clifford Odets based on an idea of Beatty&#x27;s. It was never made. Neither was &quot;The Short Cut&quot; which he discussed doing with Darryl F. Zanuck, or &quot;The Living Room&quot; from a novel by Graham Greene or &quot;Chips with Everything&quot; by Arnold Wesker.

===Mirisch Brothers===
Thompson directed Yul Brynner in the Cossack epic &quot;Taras Bulba&quot; (1962) for producer Harold Hecht. Thompson was going to follow it with &quot;Big Charlie&quot; starring Brynner but the movie was not made. In 1962 the Mirisch Brothers signed the director to a four-picture contract. The first film made under this contract was the Mayan Indian epic &quot;Kings of the Sun&quot; (1963), starring Brynner.

In September 1962 Thompson said he would make &quot;I Love Louisa&quot; with Elizabeth Taylor produced by Arthur Jacobs. (This film became &quot;What a Way to Go!&quot;(1964) with Shirley MacLaine.) He would put actors under personal contract like Talitha Pol.

In September 1963 Thompson announced he had formed a company, Bowhall Productions, to make around four films a year in the $120,000-$160,000 budget range. Thompson said it was &quot;unlikely&quot; the films would &quot;make a profit&quot; but they were movies he &quot;deeply wanted to make&quot;. They included &quot;Chips with Everything&quot;, &quot;Rose without a Thorn&quot; by Clifford Bax, and a film in Spain. Following &quot;Return from the Ashes&quot; he would also make a $7 million movie in Africa &quot;Thunder of Giants&quot;.

Instead he did another with MacLaine, &quot;John Goldfarb, Please Come Home&quot; (1965). Back in England Thompson made &quot;Return from the Ashes&quot; (1965) for the Mirisch Brothers. In April 1965 Thompson announced he would make &quot;High Citadel&quot; based on a novel by Desmond Bagley for the Mirisch Brothers. These plans were postponed when Thompson received an offer to replace Michael Anderson, who had fallen ill before he was to start directing a thriller about cults with David Niven, &quot;Eye of the Devil&quot; (1967) (originally titled &quot;13&quot;). &quot;High Citadel&quot; was never filmed. Another film announced but never filmed was &quot;The Case Against Colonel Sutton&quot; which he was going to do with producer Martin Poll. Neither was a proposed musical remake of &quot;The Private Lives of Henry VIII&quot;.

After a war film, &quot;Before Winter Comes&quot; (1968) Thompson was reunited with the star, producer and writer of &quot;Navarone&quot; in the Western &quot;Mackenna&#x27;s Gold&quot; (1969) but it did poorly at the box office. So too did the espionage tale &quot;The Chairman&quot; (1969) with Gregory Peck. He was meant to follow that with &quot;You?&quot;, about assassination from a script by Andrew Sinclair. It was never filmed. &quot;I freely admit I&#x27;ve done some pretty bad stuff,&quot; he said in 1968. &quot;It&#x27;s entirely my own fault. The trouble was I accepted some dismal scripts. I wasn&#x27;t tough enough... Writing is the fundamental thing.&quot; Some have argued that Thompson&#x27;s creative decline coincided with the end of his relationship with Henry.

===&quot;Apes&quot; Movies===
Back in the UK he directed &quot;Country Dance&quot;, also known as &quot;Brotherly Love&quot; (1970). Thompson&#x27;s handling of a smaller scale film impressed producer Arthur Jacobs, with whom Thompson had made &quot;What a Way to Go&quot;; Thompson was the first director attached to the Jacobs production &quot;The Planet of the Apes&quot; and Thompson says he turned down the first two sequels. He was available to make the fourth and fifth movies in the series, &quot;Conquest of the Planet of the Apes&quot; and &quot;Battle for the Planet of the Apes&quot;. Writer Paul Dehn said Thompson had a reputation as someone with a drinking problem but that he had overcome it by the time of the &quot;Apes&quot; films.

&quot;They were cutting back on the budgets the whole time after the first one&quot;, said Thompson later. &quot;It was a bad policy.&quot;

==Later career==
===US Television===
Thompson began working more in US television, directing the television films &quot;A Great American Tragedy&quot; (1972), &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot; (1974) starring Jeff East and Paul Winfield, &quot;The Reincarnation of Peter Proud&quot; (1974) and &quot;Widow&quot; (1976) as well as the pilot episode of &quot;The Blue Knight&quot; (1975).

He returned to playwriting with &quot;Getting Away with Murder&quot; (1976).

===Charles Bronson===
In 1976, Thompson began a long collaboration with actor Charles Bronson on the Warner Bros. crime story &quot;St. Ives&quot; . John Crowther, who worked with both men, later said &quot;Thompson was the total antithesis of Charlie and they got along famously. They really worked well together&quot;.

In 1977, Bronson and Thompson teamed again on an unconventional western film called &quot;The White Buffalo&quot;.

Thompson directed two films starring Anthony Quinn, &quot;The Greek Tycoon&quot; and &quot;The Passage&quot;. Reviewing the latter &quot;The Guardian&quot; called Thompson a director who &quot;should know better but often doesn&#x27;t&quot;. &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; argued Thompson was &quot;possibly the worst experienced director working in the world today.&quot;

Thompson directed the horror film, &quot;Happy Birthday to Me&quot; in 1980.

In 1981 Thompson and Bronson made the film &quot;Caboblanco&quot;, which opened in Los Angeles on 24 April. Also that year he directed an episode of the TV show &quot;Code Red&quot;, which he followed with another Bronson movie, &quot;10 to Midnight.&quot;

Thompson worked with Bronson again on, &quot;The Evil That Men Do&quot; (1984), which was shot in Mexico. Thompson was hired to replace original director Fielder Cook, who was fired shortly before filming began. Producer Pancho Okhenr said Thompson &quot;knew exactly what shots he needed to put together the film... [Bronson] had a lot of respect for Lee. The whole crew appreciated when the director did not make them work over and over to get the same shot from different angles... He was just a terrific filmmaker&quot;.

Also released that year was &quot;The Ambassador&quot;, starring Robert Mitchum.

On 22 November 1985, &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot; premiered. Thompson made this film as an Indiana Jones-style pastiche. It was shot in Zimbabwe and starred Richard Chamberlain. The film was reasonably successful at the box office.

On 18 April 1986, &quot;Murphy&#x27;s Law&quot;, the Thompson and Bronson collaboration of that year, started its theatrical run. It is a neo-noir thriller film. Acting in the film are Kathleen Wilhoite, Carrie Snodgress, Robert F. Lyons, and Richard Romanus. Thompson tried another Indiana Jones-type tale with &quot;Firewalker&quot;, which premiered on 21 November. The film paired the actors Chuck Norris with Louis Gossett Jr. as its leads. The action adventure co-stars Will Sampson and Melody Anderson. Norris and Gossett play Max Donigan and Leo Porter, two soldiers of fortune, whose adventures rarely result in any notable gain. They are befriended by an inscrutable woman of mystery Patricia (Anderson). Patricia&#x27;s map leads them on a quest for treasure in Central America. The name of the movie comes from the powerful guardian of the treasure.

Now working exclusively for Cannon, Thompson made two more Charles Bronson thrillers. On 6 November 1987 &quot;Death Wish 4: The Crackdown&quot; was released and 16 September 1988 saw the opening of &quot;Messenger of Death&quot;. He later reflected, &quot;I realized these films were not going to enhance my reputation. I had to live with that. You&#x27;re not going to be offered the great films at a certain age.&quot;

In February 1989, Thompson&#x27;s final directorial effort was released &quot;&quot; starring Charles Bronson.

In 1990, Thompson moved to Sooke, British Columbia, Canada.

In 1992, Thompson said he was trying to finance a remake of &quot;Tiger Bay&quot; with Anna Chlumsky and Alec Baldwin. The director said &quot;I have certain regrets now. I would rather have stuck to making films like &quot;Yield to the Night&quot; which had some integrity and importance. But the British film industry caved in. I shouldn&#x27;t denigrate myself too much because I have enjoyed making my films but I suppose I sort of sold out.&quot;

==Personal life==
Thompson was married three times. His first wife was Florence Bailey, whom he married in 1935 when he was 20. They had a son, Peter (1938–1997), who became a film editor on several of his father&#x27;s films and predeceased him, and a daughter, Lesley, who survived him. They divorced in 1957.

His second wife was prisoner and author Joan Henry, whom he married in 1958. They collaborated on &quot;Weak and the Wicked&quot; and &quot;Yield to the Night&quot;. He left her for actress Susan Hampshire. In March 1962 Hedda Hopper reported that Thompson was &quot;sweating it out&quot; in Los Angeles while Henry and Hampshire were &quot;awaiting his decision in London.&quot; Thompson confirmed this in an interview, and Hampshire and Henry were less forthcoming to the press.

In September, Hopper reported that it was over between Thompson and Hampshire. Henry and Thompson were divorced in the late 1960s.

In November 1962, Thompson said he had proposed to Shirley Ann Field who he said accepted then changed her mind.

His third wife was Penny, who was his widow.

==Death==
Thompson died of congestive heart failure on 30 August 2002, at his holiday home in Sooke, British Columbia, aged 88.

==Critical appraisal==
The &quot;Guardian&quot; obituary called him &quot;a compelling craftsman&quot;. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said &quot;he directed adventure films noted for their punchy pacing, rich atmosphere and nuanced characterization.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; said he was &quot;Known as a craftsman who had a clear sense of how each film should play, scene by scene&quot;.

The &quot;Independent&quot; said &quot;he lent his acute sense of atmosphere and vivid visual style to a wide range of material. His intimate kitchen-sink melodramas... were unflinching portraits of social realism unusually stark for their time. His thrillers were tautly edited exercises in suspense, and he also made some engaging comedies and a bracing musical...Though his later films can most kindly be labelled potboilers, his body of work in the Fifties and early Sixties was an impressive one.&quot;

In a 2000 interview with the &quot;Times Colonist&quot;, he stated that he made so many American films &quot;because of my insecurity and effort to stay here. If I was given a script and it had something good in it I&#x27;d say, &#x27;Good, I&#x27;ve got my next picture!&#x27; That is not the way to make good films, so some of them were good and some not so good... What an idiot! &#x27;You should have stayed at what you really wanted to make.&#x27; If I have anything to say to young directors today it&#x27;s don&#x27;t make a film for the sake of making it. Make it only if you really believe in it. Then success will eventually come to you.&quot;

<doc id="1343463" wikidata="Q579485" url="?curid=1343463" title="Pearl Drums">
<text>, simply known as Pearl, is a multinational corporation based in Japan with a wide range of products, predominantly percussion instruments.

==History==
Pearl was founded by Katsumi Yanagisawa -who began manufacturing music stands in Sumida, Tokyo- on April 2, 1946. In 1950, Yanagisawa shifted his focus to the manufacturing of drums and named his company &quot;Pearl Industry, Ltd.&quot;

By 1953, the company&#x27;s name had been changed to &quot;Pearl Musical Instrument Company,&quot; and manufacturing had expanded to include drum kits, marching drums, timpani, Latin percussion instruments, cymbals, stands, and accessories.

Yanagisawa&#x27;s eldest son, Mitsuo, joined Pearl in 1957 and formed a division to export Pearl products worldwide. To meet increasing worldwide demand for drum kits following the advent of rock and roll music, in 1961 Pearl built a factory in Chiba, Japan to produce inexpensive drum kits, also known as &quot;STENCIL KITS&quot; that bore the brand names of more than thirty distributors such as Apollo, Coronet, Maxwin, CB-700, Stewart, Werco, Ideal, Crest, Revelle, Revere, Roxy, Lyra, Majestic, Silvertone, Toreador, WESTBURY and Whitehall.

In 1966, Pearl introduced its first professional drum kit, the &quot;President Series&quot;.

In the early 1970s, Pearl was distributed in the U.S. by Norlin, the parent company of Gibson guitars at the time.

Today, Pearl&#x27;s Taiwanese operation encompasses five factories whose output supplies nearly the entire worldwide market for Pearl products. The original Chiba factory now caters to the domestic Japanese market, producing drum kits, marching drums, timpani, and symphonic chimes. The company also produces drums in Zhejiang, China.

Adams Musical Instruments are sold in the U.S. through Pearl dealers, Hughes and Kettner guitar and bass amplifiers are distributed through Pearl&#x27;s main warehouse in Nashville, Tennessee and Sabian cymbals are distributed in Japan through Pearl dealers.

Pearl created several drum products, such as shells in the 1970s that were made of wood with a fiber-glass lining. There was also a shell made of a composite called &quot;Phenolic.&quot; Additionally, Pearl combined roto-toms and these Phenolic shells to create the Vari-Pitch line of drums. Other early innovations included shells that were slightly undersized, so that the drum head would extend over the edges, much like a gong drum. Pearl manufactured seamless, extruded acrylic shells that were different from the tabbed-and-seamed Vistalite shells used by Ludwig. Pearl also developed the hinged tube tom-arm, a design widely copied by many other drum manufacturers.

==Construction==
Pearl has made shells for more than 30 companies. In the 1960s, they ceased making shells for other companies, and began manufacturing drums under their own name and used the Pearl logo for the first time.

Their construction technique is known as SST or &quot;Superior Shell Technology.&quot; All Pearl drums feature this construction. Each ply is placed into a cylinder, and pressure is applied from both sides. While in the press, the shell is heated to bring the glue to a boil, thus forcing it through the wood grain and fusing the shells very tightly. The individual plies are scarf jointed, and all the seams are offset, resulting in a &quot;seamless&quot; drum (Pearl demonstrates the strength by parking a Humvee with its tire on a tom shell). This creates a drum shell of incredible strength.

==Drum lines==



===Beginner and semi-professional lines===
*Midtown (MDT) - a compact 4-piece poplar drum kit which consists of a 16x14 bass drum, a 10x7 tom, a 13x12 floor tom, and a 13x5.5 snare. 
*Roadshow (RS) - a 5-piece drum set with a 9-ply Poplar shell. This kit is made for beginners. A throne, a Dual Chain drive pedal, cymbals (16“ Crash-Ride Cymbal, 14&quot; Hybrid Brass/Hi-Hats), Maple Drum Sticks (2 pr) and a Professional Stick Bag are also included.
*Export (EXX) - introduced at Winter NAMM 2013, the EXX is Pearl&#x27;s reintroduction to the Export line in less than a decade. This is the best selling drum set of all time.

===Professional lines===

* Crystal Beat (CRB) - seamless acrylic drum set reintroduced at NAMM Summer Session 2014. Originally the first Crystal Beat was launched in 1973 and featured &#x27;Sonaglass&#x27; - Pearl&#x27;s acrylic shell equivalent. Crystal Beat&#x27;s revolutionary seamless construction was molded - not rolled - creating a strong acrylic drum system that could stand up to the rigors of touring. The updated version features several modern changes: Optimount suspension system, 1.6mm triple-flanged hoops and a new acrylic material.
* Session Studio Select (STS) – Introduced at Winter NAMM 2018, the Session Studio Select kit replaced the discontinued Session Studio Classic. These drums feature Birch/African Mahogany shells, 60-degree bearing edge, SuperHoop ll and crafted for studio recordings.
*Pearl Masters Maple Complete (MCT) - Designed to replace Pearl MCX, this drum series features all Maple shell.

The shell consists of the premium North American Maple and Gum wood with 60-degree edges.
*Pearl Masters Maple Reserve (MRV) - Professional drum series featuring the original Masters series shell formula. The shell consists of 4-ply(5mm) 100% Maple with 4-ply Maple Re-Rings. Besides stock finishes, there are also more than 40 special order colours.

*Reference (RF) - Pearl&#x27;s professional drum line made from blended wood types (Maple, Birch and African mahogany). They are the highest quality that Pearl offers that are not custom-made. The drums come in a wide array of finishes with chrome, black or gold-plated hardware. This series is also made in Taiwan, and are readily available for order in red wine color. All other colors still may take up to six months for order.
*Masterworks (MW) – Pearl&#x27;s flagship drum line. Everything, including the plies of wood (such as mahogany, maple, birch, and carbon fiber/maple), style and finish of hardware (chrome, 24k gold, black), and finish can be selected by the customer. For an added cost, Masterworks drums can be ordered with an exotic wood outer ply (such as tamo or bubinga), which enhances the finish. All of the drums are handmade, and because of this, delivery times can take up to six months and even a full year.

===Electronic drums===
*e/Merge - high-end electronic drum kit developed in partnership with Korg.

It offered two completely independent (and identical) channels which were typically triggered from two bongo-like drums fitted with transducers. They could be triggered from almost anything including an old synth with a gate output or, indeed, the trigger outputs of a drum machine. It was capable of producing electronic drum and percussion sounds and sound effects. Discontinued.
*DRX 1 - Was the next model Pearl brought out, similar to the Simmons kits The kits came with five trigger pads consisting of a bass drum trigger and four snare/tom triggers; and an electronic brain controller module. Also using rubber pads which were softer for better rebound. Later on they bought out a restyled version named Pearl Drum X, the last version was the Syncussion X, this was radically different using full analogue and electronic sounds. Discontinued.
*ePro Live - Pearl&#x27;s first electronic kit that included real drums made from poplar shells. The drum pads can be replaced with traditional drum heads and can be played as an acoustic drum kit. They are available in two finishes, Jet Black and Pearl&#x27;s new Artisan II finish, Quilted Maple Fade.

===Discontinued acoustic drums===
*Forum – Drums made with 6 plies (7.5mm) of Poplar in wrap finishes. Forum drums include Pearl&#x27;s CXP cymbals, Vic Firth drumsticks, an instructional DVD, and Pearl&#x27;s 890 Series hardware as standard equipment. In January 2008, the Forum line received an upgrade to the Forum FZ - featuring upgrades like ISS tom mounts. These are made in China. The Forum line was replaced by the new Export line in 2013.

*Export (EX, ELX, EXR, and ECX) - Pearl&#x27;s most popular series of drum kits, and the most popular set ever sold (the one millionth Export kit was produced in 1995). The first generation of Export drums were made of 9-ply Philippine mahogany, and the newer were made with 6 plies (7.5mm) of Poplar, with the ECX series being made from maple, and come standard with Pearl&#x27;s ISS tom mounting system. They were discontinued and replaced by the Vision series (VMX - 6ply maple, VBX - birch, VSX, VX) and later reintroduced in 2013 (as the EXX) to replace the Forum line.
*Session - The successor of the World Series, Prestige Session Elite (SLX), Prestige Session (lacquered) and Performance Session (covered) were introduced in 1991. The shells were 7-ply, 7.5mm: One inner ply of birch, one outer ply of birch, and five middle plies of mahogany. Toms had Superhoops. Rack toms had I.S.S. Mounts. Prestige Session and Performance Session still retained the WLX designation and came with traditional double lugs, while SLX had high tension lugs and came with better hardware. In 1994, the SLX became the SPX Prestige Session (lacquered) and SX Session (wrapped) Series. The SX shells were 8 ply Mahogany and Laminate while the SPX shells were 7 ply birch and mahogany. In 1997 SRX Prestige Session Select replaced SPX and SX line. The shells were 7 ply maple and mahogany. In 2001 SRX Prestige Session Select became the SRX Session Custom, 6-ply all-maple shells with the OptiMount suspension system and 2.3mm SuperHoops II. In 2004 SRX became the SMX Session Custom 6 ply 100% maple series, and SBX Session Custom all birch. Sessions were discontinued in 2006 to make way for Vision series and MCX Masters Custom in 2007. These drums were extremely popular, but expensive. The Session line was later reintroduced in 2012 as the Session Studio Classic.

In 1997 Masters Mahogany Classic MHX with 4-ply, 5mm African Mahogany shells and 4-ply, 5mm maple reinforcement rings was introduced. In the same year CMX was renamed Masters Custom Extra MRX, while Masters Studio Birch MBX was discontinued. In 1999, BRX Masters with 6-ply, 7.5mm birch shells was introduced. In 2003, Masters RetroSpec MSX, with 6-ply, 7.5mm maple shells in a retro-style Delmar covering was introduced and ran until the beginning of 2007. In 2006, Masters Studio BSX 6 ply birch &quot;glass&quot;, with 6 ply, 7.5mm birch shells, in a Delmar glass covering imbedded with real glass flakes was introduced. In 2007, Masters series was simplified into two lines: Masters MCX and Masters Premium. The first Masters kits from 1993 had 1.6mm steel hoops, the same as Export. In 1994, they were switched to 2mm steel (gold plated) and 2mm stainless steel. In 1996, they were switched to 2mm steel. In 1997, they were switched to 2.3mm SuperHoop II&#x27;s. In 1999, they were switched to die cast. Most of their finishes are now available on their Masters Premium and Reference series drums.
*MX, MLX &amp; BLX - The predecessor of the original Masters series, with the MX being a wrapped 6ply (7.5mm) maple kit, and the MLX and BLX being lacquered 6ply (7.5mm) Maple and Birch Kits respectively. Included 2.3mm Superhoops, through-shell mounting and often came with a free-floating snare.
*GLX - This kit was the high end of Pearl from 85 to 88. Made with maple, the Pearl Prestige Artist 9500 a.k.a. GLX shared the same specs as MLX except it also included a very unique lugs system called &quot;Super Gripper&quot;. They were a notched release type lug casing, loosen the rod a bit and the casing pops off the release the nut so the rods don&#x27;t leave the rims.
* DX &amp; DLX - Introduced in 1984, they were professional line of drums, placed just below MLX and BLX series, and featured high-end components such as double braced hardware and SuperHoops. DX (Studio 7300) were available in a wrapped finish, and the DLX (Prestige Studio 7500) were available in a lacquered finish. Shells were 7-ply: 1 ply birch, 5 alternating plies of mahogany and lamin wood and 1 ply birch. This series were made in Japan. In 1987, the DX/DLX were discontinued and replaced by the WX/WLX. From 1997 to 1998, the DX Session (covered finishes) and DLX Prestige Session (lacquer finishes) made a brief “comeback” and featured 7 ply, 7.5mm shells constructed of maple (inside), mahogany (middle) and maple (inside). Prestige Session and Session featured the same shell construction as Pearl Session Select (SRX), but SRX came with I.S.S. mounts, better hardware and 4 more finishes. The Prestige Session and Session came with 5.5&quot; deep SensiTone Steel snare drum, while the Prestige Session Select came with 6.5&quot; deep SensiTone Steel snare drum. In 1999, they were replaced by the all maple SMX and birch SBX.
*World Series (WLX/WX) - The World Series was introduced in 1986. They were placed between the Export and DX/DLX kits, and the only differences were tom arms (Worlds came with the TH-80 Tom Holders, whereas the higher series had TH-90 tom holders), and the DX/DLX had super hoops (V1). In 1987, World series replaced DX/DLX series. Shells were 8 ply shells - 2 inner plies were linden, 5 plies mahogany, and 1 outer ply birch. Later shells (from 1989) were 7-ply birch/mahogany. They came in both wrapped (Performance World WX 6500) and lacquered (Prestige World WLX 6500) models. Eventually in 1990 after running side by side with the SLX (Pretige Session Elite) the World Series was renamed the Prestige (WLX) and Performance (WX) Session Series. These 2 models shared the exact same shells the differences being the snare drum, 1 colour option and the SLX had the high tension lugs. Jazz series, the Prestige Session Jazz retained the WLX designation.
*Custom Z - Drums made from maple (CZX) or birch (SZX), 8ply (10mm) snares and rack toms, 10ply (12.5mm) floor toms and kick drums. The CZX was introduced in 1989, and discontinued in 1994. Initially, in 1989, the only finish available was #300 Champagne lacquer, however, by 1993, the last year of production, #110 Sequoia Red, #113 Sheer Blue, #103 Piano Black, and #109 Arctic White were also available. Toms were available in square sizes (12x12, 13x13, etc.) and power sizes (12x10, 13x11, etc.). Bass drums were available in 16&quot; and 18&quot; depths. All featured high-tension lug casings with brass swivel nuts. In the final year of production, some CZX kits were offered with &quot;virgin&quot; shells (no BT2 tom mounts or BB3 bass drum mounts). In 1991, the CZX Studio Series, also known as the SZX, was introduced. The SZX featured 100% birch shells in the same thickness as the CZX. Tom sizes, however, were limited to power sizes and bass drums were only available in 16&quot; depth. The SZX was available in #131 Midnight Quartz, #133 Crimson Quartz #110 Sequoia Red, #113 Sheer Blue, #103 Piano Black, and #109 Arctic White. 1993 was the last year of production for the SZX.
*CenterStage – Entry-level kit; replaces Forum line. Nine-ply aged mahogany shells. Available in jet black or wine red wrapped finish. Retails for $399 for full kit including hardware (no cymbals).
*Masters Premium – The successor to the Masters Series drums, featured upgraded Reference OptiMounts, spurs, and floor tom legs and brackets, and was available in the following configurations: MMP (4 ply, 5mm maple shells with 4 ply, 5mm reinforcement rings), BMP (4 ply, 5mm birch shells with 4 ply, 5mm birch reinforcement rings), MRP (6 ply, 7.5mm maple shells), and BRP (6 ply, 7.5mm birch shells). All series offer the choice of either chrome, black chrome, or gold hardware. In 2009, MHP Masters Mahogany LE 4-ply African Mahogany with 4-ply maple reinforcement rings was introduced. The line was discontinued in the U.S. in favor of the less expensive MCX series, but continues to be sold in Japan and Europe. However, it can still be ordered as a &quot;special order&quot; in the North American market.
*Masters Premium Legend (MPL) – Introduced at the 2011 Musikmesse music fair, the Legend Series incorporates most of the features found in the Reference Pure series such as Fat Tone hoops, thinner shells, and lightweight swivel tube lugs (snares only), all of which are designed to reduce the kit&#x27;s weight. Unlike the Masters Premium line, these drums are only made from maple, with the choice of 5,4 mm. These drums are available only in Europe.
*Session Studio Classic (SSC) – Introduced at Winter NAMM 2012, the Session Studio Classic line reintroduces the Session Series for the first time in five years. These drums are made 6 plies of birch and kapur (referred to Pearl as their &quot;Session Formula&quot; shells), and feature Remo drum heads (Pinstripe on the toms, Powerstroke 3 heads on the bass drums), OptiMount tom mounts, and SuperHoop II hoops. These drums are made in Taiwan.
*Masters Custom (MCX/BCX) - Drums made from 6 plies of maple and birch. These drums replace the entire Session and Masters Premium lines until the introduction of the Session Studio Classic, with the only difference being that they feature die-cast hoops, Masters Series lugs, Masters Series OptiMount tom mounts, and Remo drum heads. They are the same configuration as the Masters Premium MRP kits, but they only come in 5 finishes with bright chrome being the only hardware option. As a result, the drums are not made up as a &quot;custom&quot; stock. Since they are warehoused in large quantities, time between order and delivery are much shorter. These are made in Taiwan.

==Limited edition==
Over the years, Pearl has released a number of limited edition kits, normally special versions of existing lines:
*Pearl Export EXA in Teal Blue Ash - Introduced in April 2019 this 6-piece shell pack consists of a 22x18 Bass drum, 10x7 and 12x8 toms, 16x16, 14x14 Floor toms, and a 14x5.5 snare drum.

Vital instruments tailored to make the gig great, Modern Utility’s five snare models each feature a 6-ply/5 mm all Maple SST shell. Well-appointed with our CL Bridge Lug and smooth SR700 strainer, each Modern Utility snare is priced to allow the active working player an expanded voice, is flexible enough to add to any set-up, and strong enough to stand up to constant play.

==Hardware and pedals==
In addition to producing drums, Pearl has also produced hardware for its drum and percussion instruments as well as pedals. One of Pearl&#x27;s major improvements was the introduction of the Uni-Lock tilter on their tom mounts and cymbal stands. Introduced in 1982, the Uni-Lock tilter uses a frictionless, gearless tilter, allowing the player to make more precise angle adjustments to their toms and cymbals. This was further improved with the introduction of the Gyro-Lock tilters which rotate a full 360 degrees. Most of Pearl&#x27;s pedals come equipped with PowerShifter heel plates, which allow the player to adjust the pedal&#x27;s feel by sliding the plate either forwards or backwards.

===Hardware===
*700 Series - Pearl&#x27;s low-end line of hardware featuring gear tilters and double-braced legs. These come standard on Forum kits. Replaced by the 830 Series in 2013.
*900 Series/930 Series - Introduced in 2009, the 900 Series is Pearl&#x27;s mid-ranged line of hardware featuring Uni-Lock tilters. 900 Series hardware come standard on Vision series kits. For 2013, the 930 Series was released, being the updated version of the 900 Series
*1000 Series/2000 Series - Pearl&#x27;s high-end lines of drum hardware. 1000 Series hardware come equipped with upgraded Uni-Lock tilters, while 2000 Series hardware are equipped with Pearl&#x27;s Gyro-Lock tilters. For 2013, the 1030 and 2030 Series were released, being upgraded versions of the 1000 and 2000 series respectively.

===Pedals===
*830 Series (830 Series) - Pearl&#x27;s entry-level line of pedals. Introduced in 2014, it borrows many features from the Demon lines including Demon Style Longboard and design (without any color), Perfect Circle Cam and DuoBeat Beater.
*930 Series - Pearl&#x27;s mid-level line of pedals. These pedals succeed the 900 and 120 series. For 2013, the 930 Series line of pedals (also known as the Demonator line) was introduced, borrowing many features from the Eliminator and Demon lines.
*Eliminator (2000 Series) - Pearl&#x27;s mid-ranged line of pedals and the most versatile line of pedals in Pearl&#x27;s lineup. Eliminator pedals feature Pearl&#x27;s patented QuadBeater which allow the player to choose between four distinct sounds, six interchangeable cams which affects the pedal&#x27;s feel and response, and a customizable traction plate. For 2012, the Eliminator II (2100 series) line of pedals were introduced by Pearl Japan, sporting features from the Demon series such as Ninja bearings, Z-link universal joints (limited edition only), and the Control Core beater, and bridges the gap between the Eliminator and Eliminator Demon lines. The Eliminator II is currently only sold in Japan. For 2016, the Eliminator Redline (2050 series) line of pedals was released as an upgrade to the old Eliminator 2000 series.
*Eliminator Demon (3000 Series) - Pearl&#x27;s high-end line of pedals. Introduced in 2009, the Demon Drive pedals come equipped with direct drive links, micro-polished bearings (courtesy of Ninja Skateboards), and a &quot;Duo-Deck&quot; footboard which allow the player to switch between short and longboard pedals. For 2012, the Demon Chain pedal was introduced, incorporating the same features as its direct drive counterpart, but with a lightweight chain and &quot;Perfect Circle&quot; cam.

<text>Safa and Marwa () are two small hills, connected to the larger Abu Qubais and Qaiqan mountains, respectively, in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, now made part of &quot;Al-Masjid al-Haram&quot;. Muslims travel back and forth between them seven times in what is known as &quot;saʿī&quot; () ritual pilgrimages of &quot;Ḥajj&quot; and &quot;Umrah&quot;.

Muslims run between the two mountains, which they believe was made a ritual as a tribute to Hajar&#x27;s search of water for her child dying of thirst until she found a water source in the Zamzam Well. The space between the two mountains in which the pilgrims run is called &quot;al-Mas&#x27;aa&quot;.

== Geography ==
Safa is a small mountain located at the bottom of the Abu Qubais Mountain, about southeast of the Ka&#x27;bah, which is the beginning of the Sa&#x27;ee. As for Marwa, it is also a small mountain of white stone, located to the northeast of the Ka&#x27;bah and it is connected to Qaiqan Mountain, marking the end of the Sa&#x27;ee. Safa, Marwah and the Masa&#x27;a (space between the two mountains) were located outside the Masjid al-Haram and were separate until the year 1955/56 (1375 AH), when the project to annex the two sites into the Masjid al-Haram was undertaken for the first time, and they were subsequently annexed. The distance between Safa and Marwa is approximately , therefore, seven trips back and forth amount to roughly .

== History ==

=== Geological perspective ===

The individual geological history of the two mountains is relatively unknown. Marwa has been described as smoother and lighter in color than Safa, with some even calling it white, such as Majd ad-Din Ferozabadi, az-Zubaidi, al-Fayoumi. al-Alusi further went on to say that Safa&#x27;s color was comparable to a tint of red. Safa and Marwa are a part of the Hejaz mountain range, which run parallel to most of the Saudi coast on the Red Sea. The Hejaz themselves are part of the larger Sarawat range, which is characterized by young and jagged mountains.

=== Islamic narrative ===

In Islamic tradition, the civilization of Mecca started after Ibrāhīm (Abraham) left his son Ismāʿīl (Ishmael) and wife Hājar (Hagar) in the valley, which Muslims believe was a command by God. When their provisions were exhausted, Hajar eventually ran out of food and water and could no longer breastfeed Ismail. She thus ran back and forth seven times between Safa and Marwa hoping to find water. To make her search easier and faster, she went alone, leaving the infant on the ground. She first climbed the nearest hill, Safa, to look over the surrounding area. When she saw nothing, she then went to the other hill, Marwah, to look around. While Hagar was on either hillside, she was able to see Ishmael and know he was safe. However, when she was in the valley between the hills she was unable to see her son, and would thus run whilst in the valley and walk at a normal pace when on the hillsides. Hagar traveled back and forth between the hills seven times in the scorching heat before returning to her son. Allah then sent Angel Jibril (Gabriel) to their aid and a spring of water appeared from the ground. The well was named Zamzam and the journey back and forth Safa and Marwa was made a ritual during Hajj and Umrah. The two mountains are mentioned by name in the Quran 2:158.

=== Before Muhammad ===

The early Ansari Muslims gave up the custom of &quot;Sa&#x27;ee&quot; seeing it as idol worship and &quot;shirk&quot; and a sign of the pre-Islamic period of ignorance (&quot;jahiliyyah&quot;). It is in this context that Verse 158 of Surah 2 was revealed (Sahih Bukhari, Vol. 6, Book 60, Hadith 22/23). In another narration by Abdullah Yusuf Ali in his commentary on Verse 2:158, he argues that the verse had been revealed because the pagans of Quraysh had placed two idols atop the two hills and the Muslims felt hesitant to walk between the hills, seeing it as idol worship or as an act of &quot;shirk&quot;. Anas ibn Malik also said that he felt hatred in walking between the two hills as he saw it as a pre-Islamic custom from the &quot;jahiliyyah&quot; until Allah had revealed Verse 2:158 (Sahih Bukhari, Vol. 2). Aisha confirmed the verse had been revealed with regards to the Ansar, who said it was sinful to walk between the hills as they used to visit the idol Manat at Qudaid (near Mecca) in the state of Ihram before going about with the rituals of their pilgrimage in pre-Islamic times. Several similar reasons have been given by multiple scholars of Islam, including al-Suyuti in his Asbab an-Nuzul and George Sale in his Preliminary Discourse to the Quran.

== Revisionist and source critical views ==
Tom Holland and Patricia Crone, both revisionist scholars of early Islamic history, suggest that Islam might not have originated in Mecca, but rather someplace to the north, possibly in the Levant. Building on this suggestion, but taking it a step further, Paul Ellis suggests that Islam originated in or near Jerusalem. One of the main pieces of evidence for this theory is his claim that the hills referred to as Safa and Marwa in the Qur&#x27;an are actually hills in Jerusalem. According to Ellis, Marwa is Mount Moriah and Safa is Mount Scopus. Ellis notes that Josephus referred to Mount Scopus as &quot;Sapha&quot; (Σάφα), which is phonetically identical to &quot;Safa&quot;.

== Significance in the Hajj and Umrah ==

Performing the &quot;Sa&#x27;ee&quot; serves to commemorate Hajar&#x27;s search for water for her son and God&#x27;s mercy in answering prayers. Two walkways guide pilgrims from Safa to Marwa, and from Marwa to Safa, with two narrower walkways in the center to serve elderly and disabled pilgrims. The walkways between the two mountains are collectively called the &quot;Mas&#x27;aa&quot; () and are air-conditioned. Water pumped from the Zamzam Well is also available on the way. &quot;Sa&#x27;ee&quot; is an integral part and &quot;rukn&quot; of Hajj and Umrah.

<text>A symbol group is a form of franchise of convenience shops, found primarily in the United Kingdom and Ireland. They do not own or operate shops, but act as suppliers to independent shops which then trade under a common banner. 

Unlike other forms of franchise, they have expanded primarily by selling their services to existing shops, rather than by actively developing new outlets. Examples of such franchises are Spar, Londis, Nisa Local and Centra.

==Groups==
Symbol groups include:
*Centra
*SuperValu
*Mace
*Spar
*Londis - 1,800 shops (part of Booker Group)
*Costcutter - 2,600 shops
*Premier Stores - 3,400 shops (part of Booker Group)
*Gala
*Nisa - 2,400 shops

Booker Group is a wholly owned subsidiary of Tesco.

==Market==
In 2014, the Institute of Grocery Distribution (IGD) reported that the symbol group market is worth £15.5bn, with a 42% share of the UK convenience market through 17,080 shops.

In the 2010s there was significant consolidation in the sector, as Tesco purchased Booker and the Co-operative Group purchased Nisa.

<text>Middle Plantation in the Virginia Colony was the unincorporated town established in 1632 that became Williamsburg in 1699. It was located on high ground about halfway across the Virginia Peninsula between the James River and York River. Middle Plantation represented the first major inland settlement for the colony. It was established by an Act of Assembly to provide a link between Jamestown and &quot;Chiskiack&quot;, a settlement located across the Peninsula on the York River.

== Overview ==
Middle Plantation&#x27;s growth was encouraged by the completion in 1634 of a continuous fortification, or palisade, across the peninsula a distance of about between Archer&#x27;s Hope Creek (later renamed College Creek), which drained southerly to the James River and Queen&#x27;s Creek, which drained northerly to the York River. Also in 1634, James City Shire was established by the House of Burgesses to include Middle Plantation and the surrounding area. James City Shire soon thereafter became James City County, the oldest county in the United States.

As the small town grew, a new Bruton Parish Church was constructed there. In 1693, Middle Plantation was selected as the site of the new College of William &amp; Mary. After serving as a temporary meeting place several times during contingencies of the 17th century when the Capital of the Colony had been located at Jamestown, Middle Plantation became the new Capital of the Virginia Colony in 1699. It was soon renamed Williamsburg in honor of King William III of Great Britain, and is today the site of the Historic District known as Colonial Williamsburg.

Royal Governor Sir Francis Nicholson described Middle Plantation as a place where &quot;clear and crystal springs burst from the champagne soil.&quot;

== Geography ==
Middle Plantation was located on a ridge at the western edge of a geographic plateau of the Tidewater Region of southeastern Virginia, from which the land of the coastal plain slopes eastward down to sea level at the lower end of the Virginia Peninsula. At this point, the land portion of the Peninsula was relatively narrow between two creeks which drained into the James River and the York River. As much of the lower peninsula to the east was becoming settled, this was a natural point for the English settlers who established Jamestown and the Virginia Colony beginning in 1607 to build a line of defense during early conflicts with the Native Americans.

== History ==
=== Concept of a defensive palisade across the peninsula ===
The idea of a palisade or fortification across the peninsula was discussed as early as 1611. Sir Thomas Dale, then governor, in a letter to the Earl of Salisbury, recommended the establishment of a fortified settlement at Chiskiack, some twenty miles (32 km) up the York River from Point Comfort. But, during the era of relative peace, which began with the marriage of John Rolfe and Pocahontas in 1614, nothing was immediately done to implement the suggestion.

The idea of building a palisade was renewed around 1623, following the Indian massacre of 1622. At that time, 73 of the settlers were slain in Martin&#x27;s Hundred at Wolstenholme Towne, situated on the James about below Jamestown. The survivors were so alarmed and weakened that they temporarily abandoned the settlement. Governor Francis Wyatt and his council wrote to the Earl of Southampton that they had a plan of &quot;winning the forest&quot; by running a pale between the James and York from Martin&#x27;s Hundred to Chiskiack.

In 1626, Samuel Mathews, of Denbigh and William Claiborne, of Kecoughtan, offered to build the palisades and construct houses, at short intervals, between Martin&#x27;s Hundred and Chiskiack. They attached conditions and costs, and historians do not believe their offer was accepted.

=== Development along north side of the peninsula ===
There was little development along the north side of the peninsula adjacent to the York River by the English settlers before 1630, and no action on a cross-peninsula palisade had taken place. Under Governor John Harvey, at a meeting held at Jamestown, October 8, 1630, Governor Harvey and the Governor&#x27;s Council,

&quot;for the securing and taking in a tract of land called the forest, bordering upon the cheife residence of ye Pamunkey King, the most dangerous head of ye Indyan enemy,&quot; did &quot;after much consultation thereof had, decree and sett down several proportions of land for such commanders, and fifty acres per poll for all other persons who ye first yeare and five and twenty acres who the second yeare, should adventure or be adventured to seate and inhabit on the southern side of Pamunkey River, now called York, and formerly known by the Indyan name of Chiskiack, as a reward and encouragement for this their undertaking.&quot;

Under this order, houses were built on both sides of King&#x27;s Creek, and extended rapidly up and down the south side of the York River. In 1630, grants of 600 acres each were given for would later be known as Bellfield Plantation to John West and Kings Creek Plantation to John Utie. By September, 1632, population on the south side of the York River had become considerable enough to claim two representatives in the General Assembly.

===Chiskiack and York===
The region on the York River was divided into two plantations, one retaining the old name, &quot;Chiskiack&quot; (an Indian name), and the other to be named York. The latter was settled by Sir John Harvey at the mouth of Wormeley&#x27;s Creek, about three miles (5 km) below the present Yorktown.

Years later, Captain Nicholas Martiau, a French engineer employed by the colony, patented the land embracing the site of Yorktown. When, in 1680, the General Assembly authorized the establishment of 10 ports, it directed that one be here, between the two settlements of Chiskiack and York. Thus, the town of Yorktown at once assumed importance. Soon, both Chiskiack and York became two of the lost towns of Virginia.

=== 1632: Middle Plantation patented ===
The plan of running a palisade across the peninsula was no longer deferred. Dr. John Potts blazed the way by obtaining on July 12, 1632 a patent for at the head of Archer&#x27;s Hope Creek, midway between Chiskiack and the James River. On September 4, 1632, the General Assembly directed that land should be offered to all persons settling between Queen&#x27;s Creek and Archer&#x27;s Hope Creek, as it had been offered two years before to inhabitants at Chiskiack.

In February, 1633, the Assembly enacted that a fortieth part of the men in &quot;the compasse of the forest&quot; east of Archer&#x27;s Hope and Queen&#x27;s Creek to Chesapeake Bay (essentially all of the lower peninsula) should be present &quot;before the first day of March next&quot; at Dr. John Potts&#x27; plantation, &quot;newlie built,&quot; to erect houses and secure the land in that quarter. Work on the palisade had commenced by March 1, 1633. With this labor, palisades, six miles (10 km) in length, were run from creek to creek, and, on the ridge between, a settlement to be called Middle Plantation was made. It represented the first major inland settlement for the colony.

=== A healthful site chosen for Middle Plantation ===
The doctor would have certainly recognized the sanitary advantages of the country around Middle Plantation. As the ridge between the creeks was remarkably well drained, there were few mosquitoes. The deep ravines penetrating from the north and south made the place of much strategic value. Also, the only practical road down the Peninsula was over this ridge, and this road was easily defended. At Middle Plantation, some years later, this road was later to be called Duke of Gloucester Street.

=== 1634: Palisade across the Peninsula completed ===
By 1634, the palisade (or stockade) was completed across the Virginia Peninsula, which was about wide at that point between Queen&#x27;s Creek which fed into the York River and Archer&#x27;s Hope Creek, (since renamed College Creek) which fed into the James River. The new palisade provided some security from attacks by the Native Americans for colonists&#x27; farming and fishing lower on the Peninsula.

The palisade is partially described in the following extract from a letter written in 1634, from Jamestown, by Captain Thomas Yonge:

a strong palisade ... upon a streight between both rivers and ... a sufficient force of men to defence of the same, whereby all the lower part of Virginia have a range for their cattle, near fortie miles in length and in most places twelve miles (19 km) broade. The pallisades is very neare six miles (10 km) long, bounded in by two large Creekes. ... in this manner to take also in all the grounde between those two Rivers, and so utterly excluded the Indians from thence; which work is conceived to be of extraordinary benefit to the country ...

=== 1635-1693: life at Middle Plantation ===
As Middle Plantation was developed midway between the heads of Queens Creek and Archer&#x27;s Hope (later renamed College Creek), settlers moved into the region in considerable numbers, establishing homesteads. Among these was Rich Neck Plantation. Not much is known of the early years of the settlement; the palisades made it a place of refuge from Indian attack. 

On April 27, 1644, the second major Indian massacre occurred in the Colony. At that time, the Chief of the Powhatan Confederacy, Opechancanough, was captured. Although this event was to represent the high-water mark of hostilities with the Natives, in 1646, Captain Robert Higginson was directed to run a new pale at Middle Plantation, as the old was out of repair.

By the 1650s, Middle Plantation began to look both populated and wealthy. Colonel John Page, a merchant who had emigrated from Middlesex, England with his wife Alice Lucken Page in 1650, was largely responsible for building Middle Plantation into a substantial town. In an era of wooden buildings, brick was a sign of both wealth and permanence. Page built a large, brick house in Middle Plantation and began encouraging the growth of the area. The Ludwell brothers (Thomas and Phillip) also built a substantial brick home, even larger than that of Page. The houses which Page and the Ludwells built were among the finest in the colony. The Pages&#x27; eldest son, Francis built another brick house nearby. By the third quarter of the seventeenth century, Middle Plantation began to look like a place of importance.

=== Bacon&#x27;s Rebellion ===
During Bacon&#x27;s Rebellion (1675), Middle Plantation was second only to Jamestown as the center of the political upheaval. On August 3, at the house of Major Otho Thorpe at Middle Plantation, Nathaniel Bacon held a convention of the leading men, including four councillors. They adopted resolutions stressing independence from the people in power. The people pledged themselves to resist the Royal Governor, Sir William Berkeley to the utmost, and to oppose any force sent out from England. Historians note that it was a struggle for power between Bacon and his followers and the more established settlers represented by Berkeley. During the resulting conflict, Governor Berkeley retreated to the Eastern Shore. After Bacon died of natural causes later that year, Berkeley soon regained power and returned to the Peninsula.

After Bacon&#x27;s death and the suppression of his followers, Middle Plantation was the site of the execution of William Drummond. Berkeley suggested he may have been &quot;the original cause of the whole Rebellion.&quot; The same day on which Drummond was executed, the rebel Jean Baptista, a Frenchman, was also hanged there. Berkley also hanged many other colonists who had been involved in the uprising. Upon learning of the many executions, King Charles II was so displeased by the scale of retaliation that he recalled the Royal Governor to England.

During the Rebellion, most of Jamestown was burned to the ground. The House of Burgesses moved temporarily to Middle Plantation while the reconstruction of the old parliament house was underway.

=== Peace with the Natives ===

Succeeding Berkeley on May 5, 1677, Acting Governor Sir Herbert Jeffreys invited the &quot;weroances&quot; of the neighboring Indian tribes to his camp to seek a lasting peace.

On May 29, 1677, King Charles II&#x27;s birthday, attendees included the queen of the Pamunkey, her son, Captain John West; the queen of the Weyanoke, the king of the Nottoways, King Shurenough of the Manakins (Monacans), and the king of the Nansemonds. By the articles which they all signed, the Indian leaders agreed to live in due submission to the English people. As a guarantee of good treatment, Jeffreys presented each of them with a coronet or frontlet adorned with false jewels. One of the frontlets, presented to the queen of Pamunkey, is now held by the Virginia Historical Society.

As Bacon&#x27;s forces had destroyed the statehouse and all other buildings at Jamestown, the first General Assembly summoned after the rebellion was held in February, 1677, at Berkeley&#x27;s residence, Green Spring Plantation. In October, the assembly met at Major Otho Thorpe&#x27;s house in Middle Plantation. That year, the Assembly discussed idea of moving the capital from Jamestown, but instead rebuilt the state house at Jamestown.

=== Churches, Bruton Parish ===
In 1633, shortly after Middle Plantation was established, a parish of the Church of England with the same name, Middle Plantation Parish was established. The colonists soon built a wooden church. In 1644, Harrop Parish in James City County became active, and it united with Middle Plantation Parish in 1658 to form Middletown Parish. Marston Parish, founded in 1654 in adjacent York County merged with Middletown Parish in 1674 to form the new Bruton Parish.

The name &quot;Bruton Parish&quot; honored the prominent Ludwell family and Governor Sir William Berkeley, whose ancestral homes were at Bruton in Somerset, England. Reverend Roland Jones was the first minister of Bruton Parish. In 1678, Colonel John Page (Middle Plantation), a wealthy colonist, donated a plot of land about by and funds for building a brick church and for the surrounding churchyard at Middle Plantation.

Other subscribers pledged additional funds. About by , and the brick church was completed in 1683 and dedicated the next year at the Epiphany. The first brick Bruton Parish Church was of Gothic design with supporting buttresses. Soon the vestry authorized a steeple and a ring of bells. Royal approval of the structure came in 1694 when the Governor, Sir Edmund Andros, gave the parish a large silver server (paten). The church was replaced by a larger building finished in 1715 which is still extant.

=== 1693: The College of William &amp; Mary ===

After years of campaigning, a long-sought dream of the colonists came to fruition in 1693 following a mission to London by the Reverend Doctor James Blair, the highest ranking representative of the Church of England in the colony. Blair returned with the charter for a new college, and selected land adjacent to Middle Plantation as the site. There they established The College of William &amp; Mary, named for the reigning King and Queen of England. The College opened in temporary buildings in 1694. It was given a seat in the House of Burgesses and was supported by taxation of a penny per pound on tobacco exported from Maryland and Virginia.

Sir Christoper Wren Building, formerly known as the College Building, was built between 1695 and 1699 and remains the oldest academic building in continuous use in the United States.

=== 1699: named the new capital of the Virginia Colony ===
On October 20, 1698, the statehouse (capitol building) in Jamestown burned for the fourth time. Once again removing itself to a familiar alternate location, the legislature met at Middle Plantation, this time in the new College Building.

While meeting there, a group of five students from the College of William and Mary submitted a well-presented and logical proposal to the legislators outlining a plan and good reasons to move the capital permanently to Middle Plantation.

Despite the periodic need to relocate to Middle Plantation, throughout the seventeenth century, Virginians had been reluctant to move the capital from its &quot;ancient and accustomed place.&quot; After all, Jamestown had always been Virginia&#x27;s capital. It had a state house (except when it periodically burned) and a church, and it offered easy access to ships that came up the James River bringing goods from England and taking on tobacco bound for market. 

However, the students argued that the change would escape the dreaded malaria and mosquitoes that had always plagued the Jamestown site. The students pointed out that, while not located immediately upon a river, Middle Plantation offered nearby access to two deepwater (6-7&#x27; depth) creeks leading to a choice of &quot;two&quot; rivers. Other advocates of the move included the Reverend Dr. Blair and Sir Francis Nicholson. Nicholson succeeded Sir Edmund Andros as governor of Virginia. The earlier work of several prominent individuals like John Page, Francis Page, Thomas Ludwell, Philip Ludwell, and Otho Thorpe in building their fine brick homes and creating a substantial town at Middle Plantation also played a major role. And, there was of course, the new College of William and Mary with its fine brick building. 
The proposal for the move was received favorably by the House of Burgesses. In 1699, the capital of the Virginia Colony was officially relocated to Middle Plantation.

=== Renamed as Williamsburg ===
About the same time the Capital was moved, Middle Plantation was renamed Williamsburg by the Governor, Colonel Francis Nicholson, in honor of King William III of Great Britain. The new site was described by Governor Nicholson as a place where &quot;clear and crystal springs burst from the champagne soil.&quot;

Williamsburg remained the capital of Virginia until 1780.

<doc id="1343484" wikidata="Q994192" url="?curid=1343484" title="Brunt Ice Shelf">
<text>The Brunt Ice Shelf borders the Antarctic coast of Coats Land between Dawson-Lambton Glacier and Stancomb-Wills Glacier Tongue. It was named by the UK Antarctic Place-names Committee after David Brunt, British meteorologist, Physical Secretary of the Royal Society, 1948–57, who was responsible for the initiation of the Royal Society Expedition to this ice shelf in 1955.

It was the location of the base of the Royal Society Expedition, 1955–59 which was taken over as the British Halley Research Station.

The Brunt Icefalls () extend along Caird Coast for about , where the steep ice-covered coast descends to Brunt Ice Shelf. The icefalls were discovered on 5 November 1967, in the course of a United States Navy Squadron VXE-6 flight over the coast in LC-130 aircraft, and was plotted by the United States Geological Survey from air photos obtained at that time. It was named by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names in association with the Brunt Ice Shelf.

==Calving events==

In 2012, previously stable large chasms in the ice shelf (cracks which clearly go all the way through to the sea) started expanding, which was expected to cause large parts of the Brunt Ice Shelf to break off within the next few years. On 26 February 2021, the Iceberg A-74 duly broke away from the north-facing shelf, separating from the edge of the shelf at the McDonald Ice Rumples along the North Rift and finally joining the Brunt-Stancomb chasm. As of 28 February, A-74 was located at 75° 13&#x27; South, 25° 41&#x27; West and measures on its longest axis and on its widest axis.

On 23 January 2023, the second major calving from this area occurred when the crack known as Chasm-1 fully extended through the ice shelf, creating a iceberg. Chasm-1 had continued to grow since 2015 and by December 2022 extended across the entire ice shelf, marking the beginning of the calving event.

<text>Patrick Cudahy Jr. ( ); March 17, 1849 – July 25, 1919) was an American industrialist in the meat packing business and a patriarch of the Cudahy family. He was also the founder and namesake of Cudahy, Wisconsin.

==Biography==
Cudahy was born on St. Patrick&#x27;s Day in Callan, County Kilkenny, Ireland. A few months after he was born, his family emigrated to Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He worked his way up at the Plankinton and Armour meat packing plant in the Menomonee Valley, becoming the superintendent in 1874. In 1888, the owner, John Plankinton, transferred the company to Patrick and his brother, John. The company became known as Cudahy Brothers.

In 1892, Cudahy moved the company to a 700-acre (2.8 km²) plot of land south of Milwaukee which he and his brother John bought for the purpose. This land was in the former Town of Lake, which is now divided between the municipalities of Milwaukee, St. Francis, and Cudahy.

Cudahy &quot;had a bittersweet relationship with the village of Cudahy&quot; in part because he supported temperance and &quot;fought against liquor&quot;. He &quot;argued with the Cudahy Common Council about the spread of taverns in the village&quot;, although he also worked to assist business development and the construction of a new library. He said, &quot;It is a source of satisfaction to me to look over those 25 years and see what has been accomplished, but I would feel much better if there were not the antagonistic spirit in Cudahy which seems to prevail to a great extent among its citizens.&quot;

Cudahy died in Milwaukee on July 25, 1919, and was interred in his family mausoleum at Calvary Cemetery.

<text>Lisburn Distillery Football Club is a Northern Irish intermediate football club who are based in Ballyskeagh, Lisburn. A founder member of the Irish League, they currently play in the NIFL Premier Intermediate League, the third tier of the Northern Ireland Football League. The club was simply known as Distillery Football Club from 1880 to 1999.

== History ==
The club, founded in November 1880, originated in west Belfast, where it was based at Grosvenor Park at Distillery Street off the Grosvenor Road until 1971. 

On 30 December 1952, at Distillery’s Grosvenor Park ground, the first full match played under floodlights, anywhere in Ireland, took place. The home side’s opposition were English team Burnley F.C.. The first officially approved competitive match under floodlights in the British Isles took place at Grosvenor Park on 25 March 1953 when Distillery Seconds played Ballymena United Reserves in the George Wilson Cup and the first floodlight league game in the British Isles took place at Grosvenor Park on the 24th December 1953 when Distillery played Coleraine.
After sharing Skegoneill Avenue (Brantwood) and Seaview (Crusaders) for some years, the club moved in 1980 to a permanent new home at New Grosvenor Stadium, Ballyskeagh, County Antrim, on the southern outskirts of Belfast. The main stand at New Grosvenor Park is named after legendary player Bertie McMinn.

The club was known simply as Distillery from its foundation until 1999, when it changed its official name to &#x27;Lisburn Distillery&#x27; to associate itself more closely with its adopted borough (now city) of Lisburn. However, the club is still colloquially referred to as &quot;Distillery&quot;. The club colour is white. A founder member of the Irish League in 1890, the club was relegated from the Premiership in May 2013.

<text>The Caird Coast is the portion of the coast of Coats Land lying between the terminus of Stancomb-Wills Glacier, in 20º00´W, and the vicinity of the Hayes Glacier, in 27º54´W. Shackleton named it for Sir James Key Caird, patron of the expedition.

As part of the ill-fated British Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, Ernest Shackleton continued the exploration southward, joining Bruce&#x27;s discovery to land which Wilhelm Filchner had discovered from the &quot;Deutschland&quot; in 1912.

<text>The sword-tail newt, sword-tailed newt, yellow-bellied newt, or Okinawa newt (Cynops ensicauda) is a species of true salamander from the Ryukyu Archipelago in Japan.

It has recently been placed on Japan&#x27;s Red List of Threatened Amphibians. Sword-tail newts are poisonous, and may also be referred to as fire-bellied newts due to the orange coloration of their underside. They are not to be confused with the common Chinese and Japanese species. It is distinguished from these two species by their larger size, broader heads and smoother skin. Its coloration ranges from brown to black, occasionally with an orange dorsal stripe. Some individuals may have light spotting or speckling on their backs.

Sword-tailed newts can reach in males and in females. They are the largest living members of their genus. They exhibit sexual dimorphism. Females’ tails are longer than the rest of their body; those of males are much shorter, and sometimes display a whitish sheen during breeding season.

==Habitat and distribution==

The sword-tailed newt is only found on the Ryukyu Archipelago, an island chain off the southern coast of Japan, as well as on many smaller surrounding islands.
The newts typically live in cool, stagnant bodies of water. They are commonly found in man-made structures such as rice paddies, road-side ditches, and cattle waterholes.
The two known subspecies of sword-tailed newt are &quot;C. e. ensicauda&quot; and &quot;C. e. popei&quot;. Due to the subtropical climate of its native habitat, it is more tolerant of high temperatures than other &quot;Cynops&quot;.
The sword-tailed newt has no natural predators, thus deforestation and land development are the main causes of their endangerment.

As of 2010, breeding grounds were visited by 75% less newts than in 1996. Many of their breeding sites are in roadside ditches and gutters, and they are highly territorial, making it difficult to relocate them.

==Trends and threats==
The populations of &quot;C. ensicauda&quot; have declined in recent years, especially as a result of habitat destruction due to land development. Large predatory fish of the genus &quot;Tilapia&quot; have been introduced into traditional breeding ponds. Even in locations where suitable forest habitat has been preserved, the construction of access roads with concrete drainage ditches kills many; the newts wander to forage on rainy days and may fall into the ditches, where they will die when the rain ceases (Goris and Maeda 2004).

<text>The desert owl or desert tawny owl (Strix hadorami), formerly known as Hume&#x27;s owl, is a species of owl. It is closely related to the more widespread tawny owl and to the range-restricted Omani owl.

This species is a part of the family Strigidae, commonly known as typical owls, which contains most species of owl. The other owl family is the barn owls, Tytonidae.

The desert owl breeds in Israel, northeast Egypt, Jordan, and the Arabian Peninsula. Its habitat includes desert, semi-desert, rocky ravines, and palm groves. It nests in crevices and holes in cliffs. Its diet consists of voles, mice and large insects.

This is a medium-sized earless owl, smaller than the tawny owl at 29–33 cm in length. It is largely nocturnal and sedentary. Its stocky body and round head recall a small tawny owl, but it is paler, less streaked, particularly on the underparts, and has yellow eyes.
The call of the desert owl is a &quot;&quot;, described as similar in rhythm to Eurasian collared dove. The call of females is deeper and less distinct than the call of males.

==Taxonomy==

This species was known for over a century by the scientific name &quot;Strix butleri&quot;, but a 2015 study demonstrated that the holotype of &quot;S. butleri&quot; was not actually a member of this species, but was instead most likely an Omani owl (which had been described as a new species, &quot;S. omanensis&quot;, in 2013). Because the allocation of &quot;Strix butleri&quot; to the Omani owl left the more widespread species without a name, the authors of the study named it &quot;S. hadorami&quot; after Israeli ornithologist Hadoram Shirihai, and gave it the new common name desert tawny owl (which has been subsequently shortened to desert owl by some authors).

<text>Head in the Clouds is a 2004 Canadian-British war drama film written and directed by John Duigan. The original screenplay focuses on the choices young lovers must make as they find themselves surrounded by increasing political unrest in late-1930s Europe. The film was a critical and box office failure.

==Plot==
In Paris in the year 1924, a young 14-year-old Gilda Bessé, the daughter of a French aristocrat and an emotionally unstable American mother, is told by a fortune teller that the life line on her palm does not extend past the age of 34. Years later, on a rainy night in 1933, Gilda stumbles into the room of Guy Malyon, an Irishman who is a first-year scholarship student at Cambridge University. She has had a lover&#x27;s quarrel with one of the dons, and rather than turn her out into the storm, Guy gallantly allows her to spend the night. Later, they become lovers, but the two are separated when Gilda&#x27;s mother dies and she opts to leave England. A few years later, Guy sees her as an extra in a Hollywood film, and shortly after he coincidentally receives a letter from her inviting him to visit her in Paris, where she is working as a photographer.

Guy discovers that Gilda is living with the Spanish-born nursing student/model Mia and has a lover, whom she quickly discards when Guy moves in. The trio are enjoying their unusual living arrangement, but world events are beginning to affect their existence. It is the height of the Spanish Civil War, and the idealistic Guy, a long-time supporter of the army of the Second Spanish Republic, is determined to do what he can to help them as Francisco Franco&#x27;s nationalists gain strength. Mia, too, is anxious to come to the aid of her native land. Gilda, however, has no interest in politics or anything else that might disrupt her life of luxury, and pleads with the two to ignore the conflict, but they feel compelled to act and depart for Spain.

By January 1938, Guy becomes a soldier, while Mia becomes a nurse and tends to the wounded. They cross paths one night and, before sleeping with Guy, Mia confesses she was Gilda&#x27;s lover. In the morning, her ambulance is destroyed by a land mine, resulting in Mia&#x27;s death as well as the ambulance driver&#x27;s. A few months later in July 1938, Guy returns to Paris, where he is ignored by Gilda, who feels his abandonment of her was a form of betrayal.

Six years later, Guy is working as a spy with the underground in occupied Paris under the auspices of British intelligence. He learns that Gilda has taken Nazi Major Franz Bietrich as a lover and visits her in their old apartment, where the two make love. The following morning, she tells him their affair is over and the two can never see each other again. D-Day is approaching, and Guy throws himself into his work. One day he arrives at a café to meet a contact, but instead is approached by Gilda, who has overheard her German lover plotting a trap and has come to help him escape in cleric&#x27;s clothing she has concealed in the restaurant&#x27;s washroom. That night, he and his associates destroy a rail station, but only Guy manages to elude the German soldiers.

Guy returns to London, where he discovers Gilda joined the Resistance a few years earlier. With the occupation of Paris having come to an end, he realizes that the locals, who had long regarded Gilda as a Nazi sympathizer and traitor, will seek revenge. As he returns to Paris to find her, Guy is unaware that Bietrich has been killed in Gilda&#x27;s apartment and that she has been taken captive by a mob intent on avenging the deaths of their loved ones. She is finally killed by a local Resistance fighter to avenge the death of his sister, whom Bietrich killed. In Gilda&#x27;s ransacked apartment, Guy reads the last letter written by her to him.

==Production==
The film was shot in London, Cambridge, Montreal, and Paris.

The soundtrack included &quot;Parlez-moi d&#x27;amour&quot; by Jean Lenoir, &quot;Blue Drag&quot; by Josef Myrow, &quot;Minor Swing&quot; by Stéphane Grappelli and Django Reinhardt, &quot;Big Jim Blues&quot; by Harry Lawson and Mary Lou Williams, &quot;La rumba d&#x27;amour&quot; by Simon Rodriguez, &quot;Vous qui passez sans me voir&quot; by Charles Trenet and Jean Sablon, &quot;My Girl&#x27;s Pussy&quot; by Harry Roy and performed by John Duigan and &quot;La litanie à la vierge&quot; by Francis Poulenc.

The film featured John Jorgenson as Django Reinhardt; Jorgenson was discovered by the film&#x27;s music coordinator and consultant, Scottpatrick Sellitto. His reproduction of Django&#x27;s playing was applauded throughout the world by many critics and the media. This led to the formation of the John Jorgenson Quintet. The score was by Terry Frewer and won best score award in the 2005 Genie Awards.

The film opened on ten screens in the United States and earned $46,133 its opening weekend. It grossed a total of $398,278 in the US and Canada and $3,112,327 in other markets for a total worldwide box office of $3,510,605.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Head in the Clouds&quot; received negative reviews. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 16% based on 91 reviews, with an average rating of 4.3/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus says &quot;&quot;Head in the Clouds&quot; aspires to soapy melodrama, but gets lost in its own lather, never mining romance from its central love affair or achieving authenticity in its period setting.&quot; In his review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Stephen Holden said, &quot;The strength of [Charlize Theron&#x27;s] go-for-broke performance only underlines the weaknesses of the film . . . [which] plays like an entertaining compilation of Hollywood&#x27;s favorite World War II clichés&quot; and added, &quot;Could it be that Hollywood&#x27;s six decades of replaying the Good War has left us with nobility fatigue? At least &quot;Head in the Clouds&quot; is not the debacle of &quot;Charlotte Gray&quot; and other epic-manqués. But if World War II is to continue to mean anything anymore, it has to be reimagined as a real event, not a deluxe, romantically spiced-up newsreel.&quot;

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; said the film &quot;is silly and the plot is preposterous, but it labors under no delusions otherwise. It wants to be a hard-panting melodrama, with spies and sex and love and death, and there are times when a movie like this is exactly what you feel like indulging.&quot;

In the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, Walter Addiego called it &quot;a glossy, stiff melodrama . . . a mixture of &quot;Casablanca&quot; and &quot;Cabaret&quot;, or possibly Hemingway and Henry Miller, and finally, it doesn&#x27;t work, in part because the erotic content seems self-conscious and force-fit. In fact, if not for the presence of Charlize Theron, it&#x27;s hard to imagine this film would have attracted anywhere near the kind of attention it&#x27;s gotten . . . she&#x27;s not at all bad, but her role as a young American heiress and libertine feels recycled from scores of other movies.&quot;

Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; awarded it one out of a possible four stars and described it as &quot;a World War II melodrama of epic silliness and supreme vapidity . . . This spark-free film has no place to go on [the cast&#x27;s] resumes except under the heading of &quot;Cringing Embarrassment&quot;.&quot;

<text>A motorman is a person who operates a tram (streetcar), light rail, or rapid transit train. A motorman is in charge of operating their train, applying power to traction motors, in the same sense as a railroad engineer is in charge of the engine.

The term was and, where still used, is gender-neutral. Though motormen have historically been men, women in the position (first appearing in the United States during the World Wars) were usually also called motormen as a job title. Twin City Lines adopted the diminutive &quot;motorette&quot; for their women employees. The term has been replaced by more neutral ones, as gender-specific job titles have fallen into disuse.

On systems such as the New York City Subway and London Underground, the position is now called &quot;train operator&quot; (T/O). After transitioning to one-person operation on the Chicago &quot;L&quot;, use of &quot;operator&quot; came as a replacement term after motormen assumed additional responsibilities previously held by the conductors.

The operator of an electric locomotive or electric multiple unit on a commuter or mainline railroad is typically called an engineer, operator, or driver.

The term may also refer to a person on a locomotive-hauled train when the train is being propelled by the locomotive. The driver is responsible for applying power in the locomotive, while the motorman (usually in a specially-built or converted vehicle) at the front of the train, is responsible for obeying signals, sounding the horn, and applying the brakes where necessary.

<text>Hayes Glacier in Antarctica enters the southeast part of the Weddell Sea about west-southwest of Dawson-Lambton Glacier. It was discovered in the course of a U.S. Navy LC-130 plane flight over the Caird Coast on November 5, 1967, and was plotted by the United States Geological Survey from photographs obtained at that time. It was named by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names for Lieutenant Commander Winston R. Hayes, U.S. Navy Reserve, the pilot on that flight.

<text>Michael Cudahy ( ); December 7, 1841 – November 27, 1910) was an American industrialist who, along with two brothers, established the Cudahy Packing Company in 1890.

==Early life==
Cudahy was born in Callan, County Kilkenny in 1841 to Patrick and Elizabeth (née Shaw) Cudahy. The family emigrated to the United States in 1849, and eventually settled in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

==Career==
Cudahy dropped out of school at age 14 and found a job working at Layton and Plankinton, Milwaukee, an area meat packing plant. He worked his way up the ranks and eventually became a private meat inspector. By 1869, Cudahy was a manager in charge of the packing house at Plankinton, Armour and Company, which had been established in Milwaukee in 1852. In 1873, he was made partner in Armour and Company.

With the help of his brothers Edward and Patrick, he established the Cudahy Packing Company in South Omaha, Nebraska in 1890.

===Real estate===
By the late 19th century, Cudahy had become a wealthy man living a comfortable life. He took an interest in Mackinac Island, Michigan as a summer home. He also owned a home in Hubbard&#x27;s Annex on the island in the late 19th century, which he later sold to his brother Edward. He then went to California in 1897 and traded in real estate to expand his fortune. He returned to Mackinac Island in 1904 and bought , making him one of the largest landowners on Mackinac Island. In 1908, Cudahy sold his share of the Cudahy Meatpacking Company and acquired a 2,800 acre (11 km²) Rancho San Antonio east of Los Angeles, California. He subdivided the ranch and sold it as one acre (4,000 m²) lots. This area was incorporated in 1960 as the City of Cudahy.

Cudahy handpicked renowned architect Frederick Wainwright Perkins to fulfill his visions of a West Bluff mansion. Perkins also designed the Governors Mansion on the island. In 1904, construction was completed on his mansion which he named Stonecliffe which was the largest private home on Mackinac Island. It went through a number of owners after Cudahy&#x27;s death in 1910. In 1970, Stonecliffe was purchased by an entrepreneur named George Staffan who converted the mansion and associated buildings into a first class resort hotel called The Inn at Stonecliffe in which capacity it continues to function to this day.

==Personal life==
In 1866, Cudahy married Catharine Sullivan. The couple had seven children, four boys and three girls.

==Death==
On November 27, 1910, Cudahy died of double pneumonia at a Chicago hospital. He is buried in Calvary Cemetery in Evanston, Illinois.
