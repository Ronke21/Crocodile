<text>Bhagwat Subramanya Chandrasekhar (informally Chandra; born 17 May 1945) is an Indian former cricketer who played as a leg spinner. Considered among the top echelon of leg spinners, Chandrasekhar along with E.A.S. Prasanna, Bishen Singh Bedi and Srinivasaraghavan Venkataraghavan constituted the Indian spin quartet that dominated spin bowling during the 1960s and 1970s. At a very young age, polio left his right arm withered. Chandrasekhar played 58 Test matches, capturing 242 wickets at an average of 29.74 in a career that spanned sixteen years. He is one of only two test cricketers in history with more wickets than total runs scored, the other being Chris Martin.

Chandrasekhar was awarded the Padmashri in 1972. He was named as a &quot;Wisden&quot; Cricketer of the Year in 1972; in 2002 he won Wisden&#x27;s award for &quot;Best bowling performance of the century&quot; for India, for his six wickets for 38 runs against England at the Oval in 1971. He received the C. K. Nayudu Lifetime Achievement Award in 2004, the highest honour bestowed by BCCI on a former player.

==Biography==
Chandrasekhar was born in 1945 in Mysore, where he had his primary education. He developed an early interest in cricket watching the playing styles of Australian leg spinner Richie Benaud. An attack of polio at the age of six left his right arm withered. At the age of 10, his hand had recovered and Chandrasekhar started playing cricket.

By that time his family relocated to Bangalore and he got an opportunity to play for &quot;City Cricketers&quot;. In an interview, Chandrasekhar stated that he joined up mainly to get a chance to play with the leather ball. While playing on the streets of Bangalore, he had mainly used a rubber ball. While playing for the club, Chandrasekhar tried different bowling styles that also included fast bowling. It was in 1963 that he decided to play as a leg spin bowler. His idea proved to be right as he was soon selected for the national side.

Making his Test debut for India against England at Bombay in 1964, he collected four wickets in the match. He was named the &quot;Indian Cricket&quot; Cricketer of the Year the same year. Chandrasekhar was influential in setting up India&#x27;s first victory in England when he picked up six wickets for 38 runs at The Oval in 1971; the bowling was named the &quot;Indian Bowling performance of the century&quot; by &quot;Wisden&quot; in 2002. &quot;Wisden&quot; noted that he was &quot;wonderfully accurate for a bowler of his type, and his extra pace made him a formidable proposition even on the sluggish Oval pitch.&quot; His consistent bowling performances in 1971 earned him being named one of the five &quot;Wisden&quot; Cricketers of the Year in 1972.

In a Test against New Zealand in 1976, Chandrasekhar and Prasanna took 19 wickets and were crucial in setting up India&#x27;s win. Attributed to him is a famous umpire-directed quote, made during a day of bad decisions in New Zealand after several of his lbw appeals were given not out: &quot;I know he is bowled, but is he out?&quot; Chandrasekhar also played a major role in India&#x27;s victory in Australia in 1977–78. During that series he became the first bowler to register identical figures in each innings of a test (6 for 52).

Chandrasekhar had minimal batting skills, finishing with a Test average of 4.07. He was given a special Gray-Nicholls bat during the 1977–78 Australian tour with a hole in it to commemorate the four ducks he scored, and he has 23 Test ducks to his credit. He also holds the dubious distinction of scoring less runs (167) off his bat than wickets (242) taken in Test cricket; the only other cricketer with this distinction over a significant Test career is New Zealand fast bowler Chris Martin.

<doc id="1327067" wikidata="Q7857439" url="?curid=1327067" title="'Twas the Night Before Christmas (1974 TV special)">
<text>″Twas the Night Before Christmas is a 1974 animated Christmas television special produced by Rankin/Bass Productions that features Clement Clarke Moore&#x27;s famous 1823 poem &quot;A Visit from St. Nicholas&quot;, the opening line of which is the source of the title of this animated special. The special first originally aired on CBS on December 8, 1974, and the network aired it annually until 1994, when The Family Channel (now Freeform) took over its syndication rights. AMC took over syndication rights for the special in 2018.

Although the opening credits mention &quot;told and sung by Joel Grey&quot;, it is really narrated by George Gobel, as there is more emphasis on the point of view of Father Mouse, with Moore&#x27;s poem read by Grey as a secondary plot.

==Plot==

Santa Claus is offended by an anonymous letter printed in a Junctionville, USA newspaper claiming that he does not exist. In response, Santa returns all of the townspeople&#x27;s letters unopened. Upon reading the letter, Father Mouse, an assistant to the clockmaker Joshua Trundle, suspects that his son Albert is the author, and Albert confirms this. To make amends with Santa, Father Mouse and the Trundle Family build a clock tower that will play a special song to convince Santa not to bypass Junctionville on Christmas Eve. 

Unfortunately, Albert sneaks into the clock and inadvertently causes it to malfunction in front of the whole town. The Mayor, embarrassed by the clock&#x27;s failure, denies Joshua access for repairs. After confessing his mistake, Albert decides to fix the clock himself and manages to get it to play its song within earshot of Santa, prompting Santa to visit the town after all.

==Cast==
* George Gobel as Father Mouse 
* Joel Grey as Joshua Trundle
* Tammy Grimes as Albert
* John McGiver as the Mayor of Junctionville

===Additional voices===
* Robert McFadden as Substation Operator, Councilmen, Handyman
* Allen Swift as Santa Claus
* Pat Bright as Sarah Trundle/Mother Mouse
* Christine Winter as Girl/Girl Mouse
* Scott Firestone as Boy/Boy Mouse
* The Wee Winter Singers as the Chorus

==Songs==
There are three musical numbers in the program:

# &quot;Give Your Heart a Try&quot; - Father Mouse (George Gobel)
# &quot;Even a Miracle Needs a Hand&quot; - Joshua Trundle (Joel Grey), Albert (Tammy Grimes)
# &quot;Christmas Chimes are Calling (Santa, Santa)&quot; - Chorus

== In popular culture ==
&quot;Even a Miracle Needs a Hand&quot; later appeared on &quot;South Park&quot; in the Season 4 episode &quot;A Very Crappy Christmas&quot;. Similar to its use in the original special, the song is sung by Kyle to Stan and Kenny during a seemingly hopeless situation. At one point, Joshua Trundle&#x27;s face is even superimposed over Kyle&#x27;s face.

==Production==

Like many of Rankin/Bass&#x27; other animated TV specials, this special was animated in Japan by the animation studio Topcraft, which was rolled into Studio Ghibli in 1985.

==Home media==
The special was originally first issued on VHS by ABC Video Enterprises and Golden Book Video in 1987. After Lorimar was purchased by Time Warner, Warner Home Video/Warner Bros. Family Entertainment (owners of the post-1974 Rankin/Bass library), re-released the special on VHS in 1990, and on DVD in 2004, paired with the 1976 special &quot;Frosty&#x27;s Winter Wonderland&quot;. A Blu-ray was released on October 5, 2011. It is also available on iTunes for purchase.

In 2012, Susman appeared in the original cast of the off-Broadway Westside Theatre show, &quot;Old Jews Telling Jokes&quot;, in which Jessica Shaw of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called his portrayal &quot;the funniest moment...delivered with a Yiddish accent as thick as schmaltz&quot;. Jason Zinoman of &quot;The New York Times&quot; also complimented his performance, saying &quot;the incongruity between content and form is perfectly tuned, and Mr. Susman benefits from resisting the urge to oversell the joke&quot;. David Finkle of TheaterMania.com also said Susman &quot;often scores simply through his feigned stoicism&quot;.

In 2013, Susman, along with the &quot;Old Jews Telling Jokes&quot; cast and &quot;The Chew&quot; personality Carla Hall, appeared at Carnegie Deli to unveil the &quot;OJTJ sandwich&quot;, named for the comedy group.

==Personal life==
In a 1971 news article, Susman mentioned he moved to Los Angeles because a friend told him he could make $500 a week as a writer. Unfortunately, the plan did not go well and he ended up making $60 a week as a writer for American International Pictures.

Susman has one child with his first wife Judy, who is a working actress. He married Bella Kordonov on November 6, 1982; they have three children.

<text>The Wisden Cricketer was the world&#x27;s best-selling monthly cricket magazine. It was incorporated in 2003, by a merger between &quot;The Cricketer&quot; magazine and &quot;Wisden Cricket Monthly&quot;. It is now no longer connected to Wisden and is called &quot;The Cricketer&quot;.

The magazine covers English professional cricket in depth and also carries reports on all Test Matches and one-day international cricket played around the world, together with a small amount of coverage of domestic cricket outside the United Kingdom. In addition, it covers amateur cricket in the United Kingdom.

It was first published by the specialist cricket publisher Wisden in England, until being acquired by Sky in April 2007. It was then sold to its current owners, TestMatchExtra.com Ltd, in December 2010.

==Details==
Available globally both at newsagents and via subscription, &quot;TWC&quot; had an audited sales figure of 34,559, 95 per cent of it from the UK. In 2008, it launched its website, aiming &quot;to showcase the content of The Wisden Cricketer while exploring the greater flexibility that the web offers.&quot;

&quot;The Wisden Cricketer&quot; formerly had a sister publication called &quot;Wisden Asia Cricket&quot;. It folded in July 2005, but in December 2005 a new publication from the same company called &quot;Cricinfo Magazine&quot; was announced, though that was closed down shortly after ESPN&#x27;s acquisition of Cricinfo. &quot;The Wisden Cricketer: South African edition&quot; recently closed down, too.

Following the sale of the magazine to Test Match Extra, the magazine merged with the much older &quot;The Cricketer&quot; magazine and changed its name to The Cricketer (in association with &quot;Wisden&quot;) in May 2011. The editor of &quot;The Wisden Cricketer&quot; for all its existence, John Stern, left later that month.

<text>The Genain quadruplets (born in 1930) are a set of identical quadruplet sisters. All four developed schizophrenia, suggesting a large genetic component to the cause of the disease. The pseudonym &quot;Genain&quot;, used to protect the identity of the family, comes from the Greek, meaning &quot;dire &quot;(αἶνος)&quot; birth &quot;(γεν-). The sisters were given the pseudonyms Nora, Iris, Myra and Hester, to represent each of the four letters in NIMH, the acronym for the United States National Institute of Mental Health. Nora, Iris, and Hester were hospitalized for their schizophrenia at least once each. As of 2023, only Myra is still living.

==Personal lives==
The sisters were born in a midwestern American town (nicknamed &quot;Envira&quot;) on April 14, 1930. They were considered local celebrities due to the quadruple nature of their birth. The four sisters grew up with their parents in the same household. The Genain sisters&#x27; parents were described as &quot;disturbed&quot;. Their paternal grandmother may have had paranoid schizophrenia, and their father was described as abusive. Myra and Nora were probably treated more favorably by their parents, while Iris and Hester were treated more harshly. The parents considered Hester to be a &quot;habitual masturbator&quot; and referred to her as a &quot;moron type&quot; or &quot;sex maniac&quot;. Iris and Hester were both circumcised as children in order to prevent them from masturbation. The quadruplets were reportedly physically abused by their father, given the pseudonym &quot;Mr. Genain&quot;. Subsequently, the Genains accepted an offer by the NIMH to take the daughters into their clinic and each was diagnosed with schizophrenia.

All of the sisters except Hester graduated from high school. Myra worked as a secretary for most of her life. She married and had two sons. When she grew older, she frequently visited her sisters Nora and Hester. Her eldest son contracted AIDS after a blood transfusion and died in 1996, while her younger son became a maintenance worker and retained a close relationship with his mother. Nora later managed the income the sisters received for having their photograph published in textbooks. Iris worked as a beautician for a while but most of her adult life was spent institutionalized.

==Illness and scientific research==
All four of the sisters developed schizophrenia by the age of 24. There was a history of mental illness in Mr. Genain&#x27;s family that might have been an example of genetics being linked with mental illness or it may have just been a dysfunctional and abusive family free from a specific genetic component. Mr. Genain&#x27;s mother had had a three-year nervous breakdown in her late teens.

<text>Yanji (; Korean: ; alternately romanized as Yenki or Yenji) is a county-level city in the east of China&#x27;s Jilin Province, and is the seat of the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture. Yanji City is located in the eastern part of Jilin Province. It is the seat of the government of Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture and the political, economic and cultural center of the entire autonomous prefecture. Its population is approximately 400,000 of which a significant portion is ethnic Korean. Yanji is a busy hub of transport and trade between China and North Korea. The city is home to Yanbian University, a comprehensive university and the only Project 211 university in Yanji.

==History==
Yanji and its environs were largely unpopulated until the 1800s when Qing dynasty rulers of China began to encourage migration there from China proper as part of its &quot;Chuang Guandong&quot; policy to populate Manchuria in an effort to stem encroaching Russian expansion.

The city was the seat of Jiandao Province in the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo from 1934 to 1943. In 1943, the city itself was renamed Jiandao (Chientao) and made a part of the Dongman Consolidated Province (东满总省).

Following World War II, the city (again called Yanji) was nominally part of a new Songjiang Province but with the communist seizure of power in 1949, Sonjiang&#x27;s borders were changed and Yanji became part of Jilin Province.

Yanji is now part of the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, which is situated in eastern Jilin. Yanji City is centrally located, surrounded by five other county-level cities and two rural counties (see map); it is the administrative seat of the prefecture.

==International incidents==
The North Korean military detonated its second nuclear test in May 2009 close to the Chinese border, and the blast set off an earthquake of magnitude 4.5 with an epicenter only from Yanji. The mutual goodwill of the Chinese and Korean populations in the region was put under severe strain, and many in Yanji expressed newfound feelings of dismay and insecurity regarding their North Korean neighbors.

A South Korean pastor, the Reverend Kim Dong-shik, was kidnapped in Yanji in January 2000, one of numerous well-publicized North Korean abductions of South Koreans; a suspect of mixed Korean-Chinese descent, said to have been trained in Pyongyang, was arrested and charged with the crime in December 2004.

Yanji was the starting point of an international dispute in 2009 when two American journalists, Euna Lee and Laura Ling, were detained by North Korean border guards when, after leaving Yanji, they overstepped the nearby demarcation line. The two were freed only after intervention at the highest level by former US President Clinton.

Crystal meth seeping across the border from North Korea has led to a drug problem. According to a Brookings report, &quot;Jilin Province is not only the most important transshipment point for drugs from North Korea into China, but has itself become one of the largest markets in China for amphetamine-type stimulants.&quot; Yanji had registered nearly 2100 drug addicts in 2010 compared to just 44 in 1990; local officials admitted that the actual number was possibly five or six times higher.

==Geography and climate==
The geographical coordinates are between 42°50&#x27; and 43°23&#x27; north latitude, and between 129°01&#x27; and 129°48&#x27; east longitude. Yanji is situated among foothills, with the main metropolitan area contained in a small, very flat area. It is ringed by mountains dotted with small, remote farming communities. It has a four-season, monsoon-influenced, humid continental climate (classified in the Köppen system as &quot;Dwb&quot;), with long, very cold winters, and short, but very warm, humid summers. Spring and autumn constitute very short transitions with some, but usually not heavy, rainfall. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from in January to in August, while the annual mean is and a total precipitation of , most of it falling during the summer. Sunshine is generous but falling far short of the central and western parts of Jilin; with monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 39% in July to 62% in February, there are 2,280 hours of bright sunshine annually.

==Administrative divisions==

Yanji has six subdistricts and four towns.

==Demographics==
The Korean diaspora in China has significant populations in at least eleven major Chinese cities, but none larger than Yanji: official Chinese census reports from 1990 placed the city&#x27;s ethnic Korean population at over 170,000. In 1994, the estimated total population of Yanji was 343,600. Official census reports from 2000 have not yet been released publicly, but current estimates place it between about one third of the city&#x27;s total population to more than one half. Both Chinese and Korean are considered &quot;official languages&quot; of the city: all official signs are in bilingual text.

==Economy==

With its current population estimated at four hundred thousand, Yanji is small by Chinese standards (by comparison, the population of Shanghai is almost twenty million). Yanji is also relatively young: the city was developed only in the nineteenth century and became the regional capital after the Second World War. Recent growth in tourism and overseas investment has helped to make Yanji a notably prosperous city. It abounds with modern architecture of steel and glass, and its broad avenues are conspicuously clean and well-maintained. In modern times, Yanji has become a city of transport and trade. China is the largest trading partner of North Korea, accounting for almost 40% of that country&#x27;s international commerce, and Yanji is the center of much of the cross-border enterprise.

Beyond North Korea, other countries have begun to partner with Yanji business groups: currently there are over five hundred joint ventures with international partners ongoing in Yanji. Much of the recent investment has been made by South Korea and Taiwan, which has helped substantially in building the city&#x27;s tourism industry.

Yanji also burnishes its reputation as a center of tourism by hosting the annual North China Travel Fair. Held every year since 1996, the fair is one of the largest of its kind in the country, showcasing over a thousand exhibitions representing cultural and economic partners from across China and overseas. Yanji also hosts the Tumen River Area International Investment &amp; Business Forum, a three-day exposition held annually since 2000.

==Transport and infrastructure==

Daily train service to most major urban centers of the province is available from Yanji, including a 24-hour trip to Beijing. A much shorter trip to the Chinese capital can be arranged at Yanji Chaoyangchuan International Airport which serves the area with scheduled passenger flights domestically and to Korea. International air service is provided by the Changchun Longjia Airport, and surface travel to Changchun itself has been made more accessible since the large Changchun-Yanji Expressway was opened to the public in 2009.

A new water and sewage pipeline was completed in 2006, linking Yanji and the neighboring cities of Jilin and Songyuan to modern sewage treatment plants along the Songhua River.

Yanji Station, located in Yanbian Autonomous Prefecture, Jilin Province, China, is a second-class station under the jurisdiction of China Railway Shenyang Bureau Group Co., Ltd. It was built in 1924.

As of 2012, Yanji offers the most convenient road access to the Rason Special Economic Zone in North Korea.

==Education==

Yanbian University is a comprehensive university in Yanji, founded in 1949; it offers eleven programs of study, including four doctoral programs. The university maintains a full-time teaching staff of over 1,400, serving an active student body of over sixteen thousand. One of Yanbian University&#x27;s graduates, a Korean language major, is Zhang Dejiang, formerly a deputy secretary of the Municipal Committee of Yanji (1983–1985), and now a Vice-Premier of the Chinese Communist Party in Beijing. It is a national &quot;double first-class&quot; construction university, a national &quot;211 Project&quot; key construction university, a key construction university for western development, a key construction university jointly supported by the Jilin Provincial People&#x27;s Government and the Ministry of Education, and a jointly supported construction university by the Jilin Provincial People&#x27;s Government and the National Ethnic Affairs Commission.

Yanji is also home to the Yanbian University of Science and Technology, a technical research college founded in 1990, and the Yanbian Medical College.

Yanbian International Academy, the area school for foreigners, is located in Yanji. There is also a school for Koreans, Korean International School in Yanbian.

==Sport==

Yanji hosts sporting events at the 50,000-seat People&#x27;s Stadium. The city was the eighteenth stop for the Olympic torch relay at the opening of the 2008 Summer Games.

Officials from the Guinness Book of World Records visited the athletics stadium at Yanbian University in July 2010 to witness a new world record being set: over one thousand students simultaneously juggled soccer balls with their feet for more than ten seconds.

==Culture==
Two all-Korean television channels are produced locally, and others can be freely received from both North and South Korea. Korean cuisine is highly popular and available everywhere. An annual Korean folk festival takes place each September in Yanji, featuring traditional Korean music, dance, painting, and sports.

Karaoke is popular in Yanji, and the city even has a burgeoning underground beatboxing scene, which has been documented by filmmaker Liu Feng in &quot;Yan Bian Box&quot; (2007).

== Travel ==
Yanji was named &quot;China&#x27;s Excellent Tourism City&quot; by the National Tourism Administration. It has beautiful natural scenery, rich Korean culture, the majestic Changbai Mountain to the south, and the summer resort Jingbo Lake to the north. Attractions in Yanji include: Maoershan National Forest Park, Chengzishan Mountain City Ruins, Mengdumei Folk Tourism Resort, Chunxing Village, an ancient Korean village, etc.

Places such as China Korean Folk Garden, Yanbian University Internet Celebrity Wall, and Floating Market have become popular travel destinations. Tourists’ experience activities in Yanji have also expanded from simply viewing the scenery, tasting food, and appreciating folk customs to visiting the local morning market and wearing traditional costumes.

<text>Dénes Kőnig (September 21, 1884 – October 19, 1944) was a Hungarian mathematician of Hungarian Jewish heritage who worked in and wrote the first textbook on the field of graph theory.

==Biography==
Kőnig was born in Budapest, the son of mathematician Gyula Kőnig. In 1907, he received his doctorate at, and joined the faculty of the Royal Joseph University in Budapest (today Budapest University of Technology and Economics). His classes were visited by Paul Erdős, who, as a first year student, solved one of his problems. Kőnig became a full professor there in 1935. To honor his fathers&#x27; death in 1913, Kőnig and his brother György created the Gyula Kőnig prize in 1918. This prize was meant to be an endowment for young mathematicians, however was later devaluated. But the prize remained as a medal of high scientific recognition. In 1899, he published his first work while still attending High School in a journal &quot;Matematikai és Fizikai Lapok&quot;. After his graduation in 1902, he won first place in a mathematical competition &quot;Eötvös Loránd&quot;. Shortly after he wrote the first of two book collections &quot;Matematikai Mulatságok&quot; (Mathematical Entertainments). He spent four semesters at the university in Budapest and his last five in Göttingen, during which he studied under the famous mathematicians József Kürschák and Hermann Minkowski. He then received his doctorate in 1907 due to his dissertation in geometry, that same year he began working for the Technische Hochschule in Budapest and remained a part of the faculty till his death in 1944. At first he started as an assistant in problem sessions, in 1910 he was promoted to &quot;oberassistant&quot;, and then promoted to &quot;Privatdocent&quot; in 1911 teaching nomography, analysis situs (later to be known as topology), set theory, real numbers and functions, and graph theory (the name &quot;graph theory&quot; didn&#x27;t appear in the university catalogue until 1927). During this time he would be a guest speaker giving mathematics lecture for architecture and chemistry students, in 1920 these lectures made their way into book form. at the Technische Hochschule.
From 1915 to 1942 he was on a committee to judge school contests in mathematics, collecting problems for these contests, and organizing them. Then in 1933 he was elected as secretary of the society and in 1942 he became the chairman of this committee. He then decided to make edits in the society&#x27;s journal during his time on the committee till his death.

Kőnig&#x27;s activities and lectures played a vital role in the growth of graph theoretical work of: László Egyed, Paul Erdős, Tibor Gallai, György Hajós, József Kraus, Tibor Szele, Pál Turán, Endre Vázsonyi, and many others. He went on to write the first book on graph theory &quot;Theorie der endlichen und unendlichen Graphen&quot; in 1936. This marked the beginning of graph theory as its own branch of mathematics. Then in 1958, Claude Berge wrote the second book on graph theory, &quot;Théorie des Graphes et ses applications&quot;, following Kőnig.

After the occupation of Hungary by Nazi Germany, he worked to help persecuted mathematicians. On October 15, 1944, the National Socialist Arrow Cross Party took over the country. Days later on October 19, 1944, he committed suicide to evade persecution from the Nazis for being a Hungarian Jew.

<doc id="1327124" wikidata="Q3567442" url="?curid=1327124" title="West Pullman, Chicago">
<text>West Pullman is a neighborhood located on the far south side of the city of Chicago, Illinois. It is one of the 77 official community areas of Chicago. The neighborhood was initially inhabited by workers of the Pullman Train Company looking to escape the grip of the company town, but soon swelled with industrial workers of all stripes. The commercial corridor of Kensington/115th Street was one of many Italian communities within Chicago, and now hosts a Hispanic enclave.

It is bounded on the north by 115th Street, on the east by the former Illinois Central Railroad, on the south by the Calumet River and Riverdale, on the west by Calumet Park, Blue Island and Ashland Avenue.
==Demographics==
According to a June 2017 analysis by the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning, there were 27,982 people and 9,058 households in West Pullman. From 2000 to 2015, the area lost more than 20% of its residents. The racial makeup of the area was 1% White, 93.39% African American, 0.24% Asian, 0.54% from other races. Residents who identify as Hispanic or Latino of any race were 4.83% of the population. The age distribution was 29.7% under the age of 19, 19.3% from 20 to 34, 17.7% from 35 to 49, 18.5% from 50 to 64, and 14.8% 65 or older. The median age was 35 years. The median income is $33,898. 

==History==
After the expulsion of the Potawatomi as part of the 1833 Treaty of Chicago, the area that is now West Pullman was settled by westbound settlers. In the 1880s, real estate speculators created the West Pullman Land Association to develop land between Wentworth and Ashland Avenues. The Association was successful in industrial development, and later residential development before the Panic of 1893, the Pullman Strike of 1894 dealt an economic blow that resulted in bankruptcy.

Like many of Chicago&#x27;s community areas, West Pullman consists of multiple smaller communities. The oldest of these was Kensington, founded in 1852 at the junction of the Illinois Central and Michigan Central railroads. Nicknamed &quot;Bumtown&quot;, the commercial district around Kensington station was frequented by residents of neighboring Pullman, a dry town. The second of these communities was the village of Gano. The area of Gano was populated by Pullman workers who desired to own their own homes and escape from the corporate control of George Pullman&#x27;s company town. Many ethnic groups called the area home, including Italians, Poles, Hungarians, Lithuanians, Ukrainians, Armenians, many of whom built houses of worship and cultural centers, like St. Michael Ukrainian Catholic Church.

The Pullman Company shut down in 1968, dealing a major blow to the entire area. Further deindustrialization, combined with suburban development, led to a similar racial turnover in West Pullman as occurred in much of the South Side; the neighborhood was 99.8% white in 1960 and 94% black in 1980.

==Economy==
Located along several major railways and the Calumet Sag Channel, West Pullman was and remains a mostly blue collar community. Much of the heavy industry the area relied on disappeared in the late 20th century, and it lags behind the rest of Chicago economically. West Pullman has an unemployment rate of 19.9%, compared to a city-wide rate of 8.4%. Habitat for Humanity has built and is continuing to build homes in the community.

West Pullman has worked to clean up and rehabilitate old industrial sites. With the help of the EPA, community organizers managed to turn a brownfield into a community garden. 

West Pullman is also home to the largest urban photovoltaic solar plant in the United States. The 10 MW plant utilizes 32,800 SunPower solar panels, spans , and generates enough power to supply energy to approximately 1500 homes in the Midwest. It is owned and operated by Exelon and came online in early 2010.

==Parks==
West Pullman Park - Indoor Pool

Kensington Park - Basketball Court with Seating. Playground equipment.

Major Taylor Trail - 6 Miles

Gano Park

Morgan Field Park

Cooper Park (Jack Leroy)

==Sports / Community Facilities==
Salvation Army Ray &amp; Joan Kroc Community Center Corps

==Healthcare==
According to the Pritzker School of Medicine, fourteen percent (14%) of the West Pullman population is uninsured, though ninety-two percent (92%) report having a consistent primary care provider. The obesity rate is fifty-three percent (53%).

==Politics==
West Pullman is a stronghold of the Democratic Party. In the 2016 presidential election, West Pullman cast 12,473 votes for Hillary Clinton and cast 217 votes Donald Trump. It was Clinton&#x27;s 11th largest margin of victory in the 76 community areas she won. In the 2012 presidential election, West Pullman cast 14,496 votes for Barack Obama and 86 votes for Mitt Romney. It was Obama&#x27;s 8th largest margin of victory in the 76 community areas he won.

At the local level, West Pullman is located in Chicago&#x27;s 9th and 34th wards represented by Democrats Anthony Beale and Carrie Austin respectively.

==Transportation==
West Pullman is home to four stations on the Metra Electric District&#x27;s Blue Island branch; Racine, State Street, Stewart Ridge, and West Pullman. Main line Electric District trains stop at Kensington station, just across the community&#x27;s northern boundary. Red Ahead, a program to extend the Red Line south to 130th Street, would result in a new station at Michigan Avenue in West Pullman. In 2024, it was estimated that this project would begin construction in late 2025 and would be completed in 2030.

==Improvement Projects==
Habitat For Humanity is interjecting single-family homes throughout the neighborhood for improvement.

Cottage Grove Ave is being extended Southbound from E 115th St. to E 130th St. with light and visual improvements.

E 115th St. and S. Cottage Grove Ave will see train station improvements along with retail improvements.

==Notable people==
* Robert A. Clifford (born ), trial lawyer notable for representing Rachel Barton Pine in her lawsuit against Metra and representing the families of the victims of the respective Alaska Airlines Flight 261 and American Eagle Flight 4184 crashes. He was raised in West Pullman near 121st Street and South Laflin Street.
* Ed Derwinski (1926–2012), 1st United States Secretary of Veterans Affairs. He resided at 12109 South Parnell Avenue during his time as a Congressman.

<text>Spirit is the debut studio album by American rock band Spirit, released on January 22, 1968 by Ode Records. The album was commercially successful, spending more than six months on the Billboard album charts, peaking at #31. It was voted number 658 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; 3rd Edition (2000)&quot;.&quot;

== Similarity to &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; ==
The guitar part of &quot;Taurus&quot; is said to have influenced Led Zeppelin&#x27;s Jimmy Page in writing &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;. Led Zeppelin opened for Spirit on an American tour in 1968, and also borrowed from &quot;Fresh Garbage&quot; in live performances of the song &#x27;As Long as I Have You&#x27;.

==Release history==

In 1973, Epic released a two-disc LP repackage of &quot;Spirit&quot; and &quot;Clear&quot; simply entitled &quot;Spirit&quot;.

The album was first issued on compact disc in 1996 by Sony. The original 1968 stereo mixes were not available for this release, so the album was remixed in stereo from the original multitrack tapes. This edition also includes four previously unreleased bonus tracks.

In 2017, Audio Fidelity reissued the album as a numbered limited edition hybrid SACD. This edition was remastered from the original 1968 stereo master tapes, which had not been commercially available since the LP release was discontinued in the 1970s. The 2017 edition also includes bonus tracks in the same mixes as those on the 1996 reissue.

<text>Sara Kingdom is a fictional character played by Jean Marsh in the long-running British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. A security officer for Mavic Chen from the 40th century, she later joined the First Doctor and Steven to work against Chen&#x27;s interests. She is sometimes classed as a companion of the First Doctor but the BBC&#x27;s official &quot;Doctor Who&quot; website does not include her in their list of companions. Her status as a companion is commented upon in its Episode Guide.

Sara appeared in parts four to twelve of the twelve-part 1965 serial &quot;The Daleks&#x27; Master Plan&quot;. Only two episodes in which she appears still exist in the BBC archives. Her character took on elements of the companion role to replace the character of Katarina, who was killed off earlier in the same story.

==Appearances==
===Television===
Sara is a Space Security Agent, the sister of Bret Vyon, another agent who is aiding the Doctor in trying to defeat the Daleks. There is an implication that she was born on Mars Colony 16, where her brother had been &quot;bred&quot;. Told that Vyon is a traitor by Mavic Chen, the Guardian of the Solar System (who was in league with the Daleks) and ordered to kill whoever is working with him, she shoots her brother and is about to do the same to the Doctor and Steven when they are transported across space to the planet Mira. There she learns, to her horror and grief, that her unquestioning obedience has not only led her to unjustly kill her brother, but also that by doing so she has prevented Vyon from warning Earth of the Dalek plot. She then joins the Doctor in his fight, briefly travelling in the TARDIS to several different locations in space and time as the Doctor and Steven try to return the ship to Kembel for a final confrontation with Mavic Chen and the Daleks.

When the Doctor activates the Time Destructor—a device that accelerates time—as part of his plan to stop the Daleks, he orders his companions back to the TARDIS for their protection. However, Sara follows him, not knowing the nature of his plan but concerned it might fail. As a result, she and the Doctor are both caught in the field of the Time Destructor as it rapidly ages everything around it. While the Doctor, being a Time Lord, can withstand the worst of the effects—merely becoming an even older man—Sara, being human, cannot. As Steven watches helplessly, Sara ages (being portrayed as an old woman by May Warden) and dies, her remains aging to dust. Steven attempts to rescue his friends; he, too, is briefly affected and ages, before he reverses the Time Destructor. This rejuvenates himself and the Doctor back to their previous ages, but does not save Sara.

Sara is by turns aggressive, independent and ruthless in her pursuit of what was right, a single-mindedness that blinded her to the larger implications of her orders. Meeting the Doctor changes that, and she turns her formidable skill and intellect to the defeat of the Daleks.

===Audio drama resurrection===
Jean Marsh reprised the role for the Companion Chronicles range of Big Finish Productions audio dramas, set just after the Christmas episode. In &quot;The Guardian of the Solar System&quot;, it is revealed that the TARDIS traveled back in time and Sara unintentionally met Mavic Chen over a year before the events of &quot;The Daleks&#x27; Master Plan&quot;. Sara believes her interference in this brief sidestep may have driven Chen to strike a deal with the Daleks.

In the first drama produced, &quot;Home Truths&quot;, The Doctor, Steven and Sara found a house in Ely in the far future that was so advanced, its abilities seemed like magic. It granted people&#x27;s wishes. However, it did not have a conscience, and it accidentally killed its owners in response to their instinctive desires during a moment of frustration. Sara implanted a copy of her consciousness into the house to give it a human perspective to make decisions in the future, and it lived with her voice and mind and memories for over a century. Even after the civilization around it collapsed, the house lived on, a mysterious anomaly to the de-civilized humans. Many feared it, but some would explore it and Sara would make them comfortable and grant their wishes.

The third tale, &quot;Guardian of the Solar System&quot;, finds the house and Sara finally separating. She trades places with a man named Robert, to whom she had told stories and granted wishes for many years. The trade, Robert&#x27;s final wish, gives him the ability to do almost anything, although it necessitates sacrificing his body. Sara is suddenly reborn in a new version of her original body, albeit slightly older and with a thousand years of memories. However, she has no idea what happened to the real Sara after she left the house. This new Sara feels lost in this new world, so Robert grants her final wish. The TARDIS materializes in front of her; inside it, the Doctor (implied to be an incarnation other than the first) wonders what force dragged it down to Earth.

Sara also features in the Early Adventures series audios &quot;An Ordinary Life&quot;, where the Doctor, Steven and Sara are forced to live in 1965 for a few weeks after damage to the TARDIS, and &quot;The Sontarans&quot;, where the Doctor, Steven and Sara encounter the Sontarans for the first time, in the form of a raid on an asteroid colony that Sara had read about in her past.

===Literary appearances===
Sara&#x27;s first use in tie-in material was in &quot;The Dalek Outer Space Book&quot; (cover dated 1966), the last of three Dalek annuals containing short stories and comic strips licensed by the BBC between 1963 and 1965. Here she is sent on the first SSS mission, tricking the Daleks into attempting to invade Barzilla by claiming there is a large seam of pure gold. When the Daleks attack, they are defeated by a surprise force.
John Peel&#x27;s two-book novelisation of &quot;Master Plan&quot; indicates that some six months elapsed between the seventh and eighth episodes of the serial, during which Sara, Steven and the Doctor travel together and have other adventures; Peel stated that this was in order to allow future writers to develop stories involving Sara. Sara subsequently appears in a short story entitled &quot;The Little Drummer Boy&quot; by Eddie Robson from the Big Finish book &quot;Short Trips: Companions&quot;. She is then heard in a trilogy of audio dramas in the Companion Chronicles range of Big Finish Productions. Written by Simon Guerrier, they feature Jean Marsh reprising her role as Kingdom.

She also returns in an audio adaptation of &quot;The Destroyers&quot;, an unmade script which, for Kingdom, takes place before she met the Doctor.

A ghost-like illusion of Kingdom, alongside Katarina and another deceased companion, Adric, appears in the Virgin New Adventures novel &quot;&quot; by Paul Cornell. This sequence takes place largely inside the Seventh Doctor&#x27;s mind, showing that the Doctor still bears the guilt of some deaths.

A race of shapeshifters known as the Ganazalum impersonate various companions, dead and living, in the &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; comic strip &quot;Planet of the Dead&quot; (DWM #141-#142), Kingdom among them. Generally, the canonicity of the various &quot;Doctor Who&quot; spin-off media is open to interpretation.

==Character creation==

The character was created largely because the production team decided that the character of Katarina, introduced in the previous serial &quot;The Myth Makers&quot;, would not work as a regular. Thus, Sara has some of the attributes and narrative function of a traditional &quot;Doctor Who&quot; companion. However, the official BBC website cites as &quot;myth&quot; the notion that Sara was created as a companion to replace Katarina. There were no plans to have Sara continue as a character beyond &quot;The Daleks&#x27; Master Plan&quot;. Marsh herself said in a 2003 interview for the Loose Cannon telesnap reconstruction that she would &quot;definitely not&quot; have continued in the role past &quot;Master Plan&quot;, even had it been offered to her.

A Production Diary compiled by David J. Howe, Mark Stammers and Stephen James Walker from contemporary memos and correspondence notes that producer John Wiles and story editor Donald Tosh employed Sara Kingdom as a &quot;short-term companion...[to] be killed off at the end of [&quot;The Daleks&#x27; Master Plan&quot;]&quot;.

Jean Marsh had previously appeared in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; playing King Richard&#x27;s sister, the Princess Joanna, in &quot;The Crusade&quot;. Marsh would return to the programme in the 1989 serial &quot;Battlefield&quot;, playing Morgaine, coincidentally with Nicholas Courtney as Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart, thus appearing in both his first and last regular &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episodes. Courtney also played Bret Vyon in &quot;Master Plan&quot;. In 2007 she appeared opposite the Sixth Doctor and Mel in the Big Finish Productions audio drama The Wishing Beast.

===Proposed use after &quot;Doctor Who&quot;===
According to &quot;The Official Dr. Who &amp; the Daleks Book&quot;, Sara Kingdom was originally devised by Terry Nation as a supporting character in a proposed American-produced spin-off of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; that would have focused on Kingdom and her colleagues fighting the Daleks. A 30-minute script titled &quot;The Destroyers&quot; was created for a potential pilot episode which was never produced. This pilot script was later adapted by Big Finish into an audio production.

<doc id="1327138" wikidata="Q1226066" url="?curid=1327138" title="Edgar Benson">
<text>Edgar John &quot;Ben&quot; Benson (May 28, 1923 – September 2, 2011) was a Canadian politician, businessman, diplomat, and university professor. He held four cabinet posts, most notably that of Minister of Finance under Pierre Trudeau, where he was instrumental in reforming Canada&#x27;s income tax law. He was described as &quot;Pierre Trudeau&#x27;s unflappable finance minister, the pipe-smoking financial wizard who raised the ire of corporate Canada in the 1970s by bringing in a capital gains tax.&quot;

==Early years==
After serving overseas in the Second World War as a sergeant in the Royal Regiment of Canadian Artillery, Benson attended Queen&#x27;s University in Kingston, Ontario, where he obtained his Bachelor of Commerce degree. He became a chartered accountant and partner in the accounting firm of England, Leonard, Macpherson and Company, and co-owner of CKLC. Prior to his entry into politics, he also taught Business Administration at Queen&#x27;s, in the capacity of Assistant Professor of Commerce.

==Political life==
He was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1962 general election as the Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for Kingston, Ontario. Initially appointed in 1962 as Parliamentary Secretary to then Minister of Finance Walter Gordon, he entered the Cabinet of Prime Minister Lester Pearson in 1964 as Minister of National Revenue, and served concurrently from 1966 to 1968 as the first President of the Treasury Board.

He was an early supporter of Pierre Trudeau in the 1968 Liberal leadership campaign to replace the retiring Pearson, and, together with Jean Marchand, was co-chairman of Trudeau&#x27;s leadership bid. He was later appointed Minister of Finance, serving from 1968 to 1972.

===Tax reform (1971)===
Benson&#x27;s balanced budget for 1969-70 would be the last until Paul Martin&#x27;s budget of 1997-98. Later in 1969, he introduced his white paper on Canadian tax reform, which paved the way for:

:* a capital gains tax
:* a tax deduction for child care as a means of helping mothers enter the workforce
:* greater use of Registered Retirement Savings Plans

The proposals were subjected to intensive debate that lasted more than a year. Those concerning the capital gains tax were severely criticized by the business community, particularly Israel Asper, who condemned the measure. The reforms were only passed after significant amendment, and even then only through the use of closure. They came into effect on January 1, 1972, as prescribed by the 1971 Canadian federal budget.

Marc Lalonde, a colleague and future Finance Minister, later said, &quot;He was in finance at a critical time, he revolutionized the system. He launched a revolution. It was a revolution, a necessary step and a demanding task. What he did was economically justified. The basic tax structure that he put in place is still alive. No one has really touched it since.&quot;

===Impact===
He was also instrumental in rolling out a national medical care plan and supplementary old age pensions and played a key role in federal-provincial relations.

Benson wore a pair of new shoes on budget day in 1968, although he said, &quot;He didn&#x27;t buy them just for the budget.&quot; The following year he did not wear new shoes when delivering the budget, saying jokingly that he couldn&#x27;t afford them, and in 1970 proudly displayed his worn soles on budget day.

He later served as Minister of National Defence from January to August 1972, when he retired from politics, choosing not to run in the 1972 election.

==Later life and death==
Benson served as President of the Canadian Transport Commission from 1972 to 1982, and as Canadian Ambassador to Ireland from 1982 to 1985. He died on September 2, 2011, at the age of 88.

==Honours==
Benson was conferred honorary degrees as a Doctor of Laws from:

:* Royal Military College of Canada in 1973
:* Queen&#x27;s University in 2008

<doc id="1327139" wikidata="Q2746759" url="?curid=1327139" title="West Ridge, Chicago">
<text>West Ridge is one of 77 Chicago community areas. It is a middle-class neighborhood located on the far North Side of the City of Chicago. It is located in the 50th ward and the 40th ward.

Today West Ridge is one of Chicago&#x27;s better off communities, filled with multi-ethnic culture lining Devon Avenue, historic mansions lining Ridge and Lunt Avenues, cultural institutions such as St. Scholastica Academy and one of the highest per capita incomes on the North Side of Chicago.

It is home to the Midwest&#x27;s largest Hasidic community, as well as other Jewish, Irish American, German-American, Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Assyrian, Russian, Korean and Rohingya immigrant communities.

==History==
Historically called &quot;North Town&quot;, and frequently referred to as &quot;West Rogers Park&quot;, it is bordered on the north by Howard Street, on the east by Ridge Boulevard, Western Avenue, and Ravenswood Avenue, the south by Bryn Mawr Avenue and Peterson Avenue, and on the west by Kedzie Avenue and the North Shore channel of the Chicago River. At one time joined with neighboring Rogers Park, it seceded to become its own village in 1890 over a conflict concerning park districts (known as the Cabbage War). West Ridge was annexed to Chicago on April 4, 1893, along with Rogers Park.

==Geography==
===Neighborhoods and sub-areas===
==== Golden Ghetto ====
The Golden Ghetto is bounded on the north by Warren Park and Pratt Avenue and on the south by Peterson Avenue. It acquired its name from the thriving Jewish community there from about 1930 to the mid-1970s. The Jewish community peaked at over 47,000 in the 1960s. That community began to drift into the suburbs in the 1960s, and the neighborhood began to be home to South Asians and Russian Jews from about that time.

The heyday of the area is the topic of Adam Langer&#x27;s &quot;Crossing California&quot;, told from the perspective of the second-generation residents during their middle school and teenage years. There has been a recent resurgence in Jewish residents, up from a nadir of 20,000 to around 25,000 in the late 2010s, due to increased Orthodox residents.

====Rogers Park Manor Bungalow Historic District====
The Rogers Park Manor Bungalow Historic District is a residential historic district in the West Ridge neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois. The district includes 329 buildings, 247 of which are Chicago bungalows built in the 1920s. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 15, 2005.

====Talman West Ridge Bungalow Historic District====
The Talman West Ridge Bungalow Historic District is a residential historic district in the West Ridge neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois. 181 of the district&#x27;s 272 buildings are either brick Chicago bungalows or older stucco bungalows built from 1919 to 1930.

==Demographics==

==Government==
West Ridge has supported the Democratic Party in the past three presidential elections, though relative support declined slightly from 2016 to 2020. In the 2020 presidential election, West Ridge cast 17,222 votes for Joe Biden (69.8%) and cast 7,281 votes for Donald Trump (28.9%). In the 2016 presidential election, West Ridge cast 16,712 votes for Hillary Clinton and cast 4,772 votes for Donald Trump, a relatively larger victory of 73.5% to 21.5%. In the 2012 presidential election, West Ridge cast 14,446 votes for Barack Obama and cast 5,345 votes for Mitt Romney.

It had been represented in the Chicago City Council by Alderman Bernard Stone from 1973 until May 2011. On April 5, 2011, Alderman Debra Silverstein defeated Stone in a runoff election and now represents the 50th Ward, which encompasses West Ridge.

<text>The Chevrolet Constantia is an automobile which was marketed by Chevrolet in South Africa from 1969 to 1978.

== First series ==
The first series Chevrolet Constantia went on sale in May 1969, along with the lower priced Kommando. It was based on the Australian Holden Brougham four-door sedan, but featured a unique frontal treatment. The styling changes were undertaken in General Motors&#x27; Port Elizabeth studios in South Africa and the model was locally produced. The Constantia was offered with a 4.1 litre six and a 5.0 litre V8. 843 were sold in 1969 followed by 750 in 1970 and 800 in 1971.

== AQ series ==

The AQ series Constantia was introduced in 1972 and was based on another Australian design, the Statesman HQ. Again, frontal styling was different from the Australian model, this time featuring a unique grille based on the 1970 Chevrolet Malibu. The restyling work was a joint effort undertaken in Australia. The AQ Series Constantia was offered with a 4.1-litre six and a 5.0-litre V8. Wheel covers came from the 1971-72 North American Chevelle Malibu.
== AJ series ==
The revised AJ series Constantia was marketed in South Africa from 1975 to 1978. It was offered as a four-door sedan, based on the Statesman HJ and as a five-door wagon, based on the Holden HJ wagon. The AJ Series was offered with a 4.1-litre six and a 5.0-litre V8. A more luxurious version was sold as the Chevrolet Caprice Classic.

==Sales==
These are the South African official sales numbers.

<doc id="1327155" wikidata="Q7443112" url="?curid=1327155" title="Second Battle of Sacket's Harbor">
<text>The Second Battle of Sacket&#x27;s Harbor, or simply the Battle of Sacket&#x27;s Harbor, took place on 29 May 1813, during the War of 1812. A British force was transported across Lake Ontario and attempted to capture the town, which was the principal dockyard and base for the American naval squadron on the lake. Twelve warships were built here. The British were repulsed by American regulars, militia, marines and sailors, although the attack resulted in the destruction of naval stores and self-inflicted damage to American warships. 

==Background==
In the early weeks of the War, the British had seized control of the Great Lakes. In September 1812 U.S. Navy Captain Isaac Chauncey was ordered to assume command of naval forces on Lakes Ontario and Erie with the directive to &quot;...use every exertion to obtain control of them this fall.&quot; Within three weeks he had directed and brought 149 ships&#x27; carpenters, 700 Seamen and Marines, and some 100 cannon, along with a good quantity of muskets and other supplies, to Sacket&#x27;s Harbor on Lake Ontario where there was already a small navy yard.

At the start of the campaigning season of 1813, the main American forces on the border between the United States and Canada had been concentrated at Sacket&#x27;s Harbor. The naval squadron which Chauncey had created was superior to the opposing British and Canadian-manned squadron at Kingston, and the troops under Major General Henry Dearborn could outnumber the British at any point on their extended front. The Americans had a chance to storm Kingston, which would have eliminated the British squadron and perhaps allowed the Americans to secure almost all of Upper Canada.

However, Dearborn and Chauncey exaggerated the number of British regulars they believed to be stationed at Kingston, and instead proceeded to attack York, the Provincial capital of Upper Canada, at the other end of the lake. On 27 April, the Americans won the Battle of York, temporarily occupying and looting the town. They withdrew to Fort Niagara near the mouth of the Niagara River, preparing to attack the British position at Fort George on the opposite side of the river.

Late in 1812, Captain James Lucas Yeo had been appointed by the Admiralty to command the British naval force on the Great Lakes. He arrived at Quebec on 5 May 1813, and proceeded up the Saint Lawrence River to Kingston with a party of 150 naval officers and sailors. On the way, he overtook and joined the Governor General of Canada, Lieutenant General Sir George Prevost, who was also proceeding to Kingston. This was Prevost&#x27;s second visit to Upper Canada in four months, as he thought it would probably prove necessary to replace Major General Roger Hale Sheaffe, who had lost the confidence of the Provincial Assembly after his defeat at York.

Prevost and Yeo arrived at Kingston on 15 May. While Prevost reorganised his command and attempted to raise the morale of the militia and civil authorities, Yeo hastened the completion of the new sloop-of-war and the refitting of several other armed vessels. (Much of the work had already been accomplished by three officers, Commanders Robert Heriot Barclay, Robert Finnis and Daniel Pring, who had been detached from the naval establishment at Halifax, Nova Scotia). Prevost and Yeo knew that when the &quot;Wolfe&quot; was completed, Yeo&#x27;s squadron would be slightly superior to Chauncey&#x27;s, but also that the Americans were building the 28-gun heavy sloop-of-war at Sackett&#x27;s Harbor, which would return the advantage to Chauncey.

On 25 May, Chauncey&#x27;s squadron was sighted off Fort George. The British commander there, Brigadier General John Vincent, immediately sent a dispatch vessel to Kingston with the information. (Two days later, he was driven from his position with heavy losses at the Battle of Fort George.) On learning of Chauncey&#x27;s presence off Fort George, Yeo and Prevost realised that the American squadron and Dearborn&#x27;s army would probably be occupied there for several days. They had an opportunity to capture Sacket&#x27;s Harbor, and deliver a decisive blow to the shipyard to ensure that the British gained naval supremacy on the lake.

==Battle==

===British forces===

The available British troops at Kingston, consisting of the grenadier company of the 100th Regiment, two companies of the 8th (The King&#x27;s) Regiment of Foot, four companies of the 104th Regiment, one company of the Glengarry Light Infantry, two companies of the Canadian Voltigeurs and a detachment of Royal Artillery with two 6-pounder guns, were hastily assembled and embarked on Yeo&#x27;s vessels. As no General officer was immediately available to command them, Prevost himself led the expedition, although he delegated command of the troops once they were ashore to his Adjutant General, Colonel Edward Baynes.

===Battle of Henderson Bay===
The British force set out late on 27 May and arrived off Sacket&#x27;s Harbor early the next morning. The wind was very light, which made it difficult for Yeo to manoeuvre close to the shore. He was also unfamiliar with the local conditions and depths of water. Shortly before midday on 28 May, the troops began rowing ashore, but unknown sails were sighted in the distance. In case they might be Chauncey&#x27;s fleet, the attack was called off, and the troops returned to the ships. The distant sails proved to belong to twelve bateaux carrying troops from the 9th and 21st U.S. Regiments of Infantry from Oswego to Sackets Harbor. The British sent out three large canoes full of Native American warriors and a gunboat carrying a detachment of the Glengarry Light Infantry to intercept them.

The British force caught up with the convoy off Stoney Point on Henderson Bay. As the British opened fire, the Americans, who were mostly raw recruits, landed their bateaux at Stoney Point and fled into the woods. The Natives pursued them through the trees and hunted them down. After about half an hour, during which they lost 35 men killed, the surviving United States troops regained their vessels and raised a white flag. The senior officer rowed out to Yeo&#x27;s fleet and surrendered his remaining force of 115 officers and men. Only seven of the American troops escaped and reached Sacket&#x27;s Harbor.

===American defenses===
This delay gave the Americans time to reinforce their defences. Some 400 regulars were then stationed at Sacket&#x27;s Harbor, mainly the small detachments manning Fort Volunteer and Fort Tompkins at the harbour entrance, and various parties of reinforcements and invalids. The senior regular officer was Lieutenant Colonel Electus Backus of the 1st Regiment of Light Dragoons. There were 250 volunteers from the New York militia, and an additional 500 militia were hastily called up from the surrounding area. Under arrangements made by Henry Dearborn before he departed for York, Brigadier General Jacob Brown of the New York state militia took command of all troops at Sacket&#x27;s Harbor.

In addition to Fort Volunteer and Fort Tompkins, the Americans had built several strong blockhouses south of the village, and partially completed a line of earthworks and abatis (defence works made from felled trees and branches) surrounding the town and shipyard. These defences had been planned and laid out the previous year by Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Macomb.

Most of the American flotilla was at Fort George with Chauncey, but two armed schooners, and &quot;Pert&quot;, were anchored in Blackwater Creek, off Sacket&#x27;s Harbor. The senior naval officer present was Lieutenant Woolcott Chauncey, younger brother of the Commodore.

===Order of Battle===
===British attack===

The next morning, 29 May, Prevost resumed the attack. The British troops landed on Horse Island, south of the town, under fire from two 6-pounder field guns belonging to the militia and a naval 32-pounder firing at long range from Fort Tompkins. They also faced musket fire from the Albany Volunteers defending the island. Although the British lost several men in the boats, they succeeded in landing, and the Volunteers withdrew. Once the landing force was fully assembled, they charged across the flooded causeway linking the island to the shore. Although the British were an easy target at this point, the American militia fled, abandoning their guns. Brigadier General Brown eventually rallied about 100 of them.

The British swung to their left, hoping to take the town and dockyard from the landward side, but the American regulars with some field guns gave ground only slowly. They fell back behind their blockhouses and defences, from where they repulsed every British attempt to storm their fortifications.

Yeo had gone ashore to accompany the troops, and none of the larger British vessels was brought into a range at which to support the attack. The small British gunboats, which could approach very close to the shore, were armed only with small, short-range carronades, which were ineffective against the American defences. Eventually one British ship, &quot;Beresford&quot;, mounting 16 guns, worked close in using sweeps (long oars). When its crew opened fire, they quickly drove the American artillerymen from Fort Tompkins. Some of &quot;Beresford&quot;″s shot went over the fort and landed in and around the dockyard. Under the mistaken impression that the fort had surrendered, a young American naval officer, Acting Lieutenant John Drury, ordered the sloop-of-war &quot;General Pike&quot;, which was under construction, and large quantities of stores to be set on fire. Lieutenant Woolcott Chauncey had orders to defend the yard rather than the schooners, but had instead gone aboard one of the schooners, which were engaging the British vessels at long and ineffective range.

By this time, Prevost was convinced that success was impossible to attain. His own field guns did not come into action and without them he was unable to batter breaches in the American defences, while the militia which Brown had rallied were attacking his own right flank and rear. He gave the order to retreat. Prevost later wrote that the enemy had been beaten and that the retreat was carried out in perfect order, but other accounts by British soldiers stated that the re-embarkation took place in disorder, and each unit acrimoniously blamed the others for the repulse.

The Americans for their part claimed that had Prevost not retreated hastily when he did, he would never have returned to Kingston. The U.S. 9th Infantry had been force-marching to the sounds of battle, but the British had departed before they could intervene.

==Casualties==

The British Army casualty return for the engagement detailed 1 officer and 47 men killed, 12 officers and 183 men wounded, and 3 officers and 13 men &quot;wounded and missing&quot; (i.e. left behind). The separate Royal Navy casualty list gave 1 killed and 5 wounded. This added up to a total British loss of 49 killed and 216 wounded, of whom 16 were left behind on the field.

However, Patrick Wilder says &quot;three captured British officers and 32 British soldiers were placed in the care of the American military surgeons. This would indicate that 19 of the British enlisted men who were assumed to have been killed when the official return of casualties was made out were in fact wounded and captured. This gives a revised British casualty total of 30 killed, 200 wounded, and 35 wounded prisoners. One notable British casualty was Captain Andrew Gray, Prevost&#x27;s Deputy Assistant Adjutant General, who was killed.

Major William Swan&#x27;s casualty report for the American force detailed 22 killed, 84 wounded, and 26 missing for the U.S. regulars and the federal volunteer units. Swan gave no detailed report of the militia loss, stating only that it did not &quot;exceed twenty-five&quot;. This would give an American loss in the battle of May 29 of about 157 killed, wounded and missing, including Lieutenant Colonel Electus Backus, who was mortally wounded.

Including the 35 men killed and 115 captured at Henderson Bay on May 28, the American loss came to 307 officers and enlisted men killed, wounded or captured. The British captured three 6-pounder guns and 154 prisoners on May 28 and May 29, which indicates that 39 prisoners were taken on May 29. Since only 26 of the regular and volunteer troops were reported as &quot;missing&quot;, this would suggest that about half of the 25 or so militia casualties were captured. This gives a grand total American loss for May 28–29 of 153 killed and wounded and 154 taken prisoner.

==Results==
Although &quot;General Pike&quot; had been set on fire, since it was constructed from green wood it did not burn well, and the Americans were able to salvage the ship. The fires set by Acting Lieutenant Drury consumed $500,000 worth of stores and construction materials, which was to prove a handicap later in the year. The brig , which had earlier been brought back as a prize from York, was also destroyed but was no great loss as it was in poor repair.

The news of the British assault caused Commodore Chauncey to recall his entire squadron to Sacket&#x27;s Harbor until &quot;General Pike&quot; was completed, leaving the American Army on the Niagara peninsula without support. They had already been checked at the Battle of Stoney Creek, and Yeo attacked their vulnerable lakeside flank, capturing provision boats, tents and large quantities of supplies and forcing them to withdraw to Fort George.

Jacob Brown was rewarded for his part in the victory at Sacket&#x27;s Harbor with a regular commission as Brigadier General in the United States Army. On the British side, Prevost&#x27;s prestige was badly damaged by the repulse, although he remained in command in Canada for another year and a half before another defeat at the Battle of Plattsburgh finally ruined his reputation.

==Later events==
Yeo made another attempt to destroy &quot;General Pike&quot; after it had been launched but while it was still fitting out at Sackett&#x27;s Harbor and waiting for replacements for the materials destroyed on 29 May. He intended to launch a surprise attack from boats at dawn on 1 July, but day broke while he was still short of his objective and his force took refuge on the north shore of Blackwater Creek. During the day, some seamen and marines deserted and Yeo called off the attack, fearing (correctly) that the deserters would have alerted the Americans.

For several months, the fighting on and around Lake Ontario was stalemated, until &quot;General Pike&quot; heavily damaged Yeo&#x27;s flagship, &quot;Wolfe&quot;, in an engagement off York on 28 September. Yeo withdrew into Burlington Bay, and conceded control of the lake for the remainder of the year.

==Legacy==
Four active regular infantry battalions of the United States Army (1-2 Inf, 2-2 Inf, 1-5 Inf and 2-5 Inf) perpetuate the lineages of American infantry units (the old 9th, 21st and 23rd Infantry Regiments) that were at the Battle of Sackett&#x27;s Harbor.

Within the British Army, the 1st (Royal Scots) Foot is perpetuated by the Royal Regiment of Scotland while the 8th (King&#x27;s) Foot is perpetuated by the Duke of Lancaster&#x27;s Regiment.

The Canadian Army commemorates the 104th Regiment of Foot through the North Shore (New Brunswick) Regiment and the Glengarry Light Infantry through the Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry Highlanders. The Royal Newfoundland Fencibles are perpetuated by the Royal Newfoundland Regiment while the Canadian Voltigeurs are perpetuated by Les Voltigeurs de Quebec.
Brigadier and Quartermaster General Robert Swartwout dispatched a letter on 23 June to Major General William Henry Harrison announcing the American victory. &quot;Dispatch from Quartermaster General Robert Swartwout to General William Henry Harrison via Postmaster Erastus Granger of Buffalo, New York, 1p, at Headquarters, Fort George, 2 June 1813, 10 o&#x27;clock a.m. Sir, The Dispatch for General Harrison which I have the honor to enclose. You will be pleased to forward to that office by Express. The British under Sir Gen Prevost and Sir Gen Yeo have been defeated with great loss in an attack which they made upon Sackets Harbor on the 29th ultimo. Our loss in numbers was trifling. Signed by Swartwout as Brigadier Quarter Master General&quot;.

==Analysis==
The British defeat at Sacket&#x27;s Harbor compared badly with Americans&#x27; victorious opposed landings at York and Fort George, even though the odds at Sackett&#x27;s Harbor were slightly more favourable to the defenders. The chief reason was probably that the attack was launched without sufficient preparation, planning and rehearsal. The troops were an ad hoc collection of detachments, who had not been exercised together. This applied to the American regulars also, but since they were fighting from behind fixed defences, this mattered less.

Although Prevost had previously commanded troops in an opposed landing at Martinique in 1809, he had not directly led them, but as at Sacket&#x27;s Harbor he had delegated command to another officer (in this instance, Brigadier General Daniel Hoghton). He was to be noted for his caution in later actions. Colonel Baynes, to whom Prevost delegated command at Sackett&#x27;s Harbor, had had little opportunity to lead troops in battle during his career. Yeo had a reputation as a fighting captain, gained by leading landing parties, but was new to the command and conditions on the lake, and cautiously kept most of his warships in deep water on 28 May. When he went ashore on 29 May to be close to the fighting, the larger British vessels were apparently left without orders and only &quot;Beresford&quot; attempted to intervene decisively.

<text>Lino Anthony Graglia (January 22, 1930January 30, 2022) was the A. W. Walker Centennial Chair in Law at the University of Texas specializing in antitrust litigation. He earned a BA from the City College of New York in 1952, and an LLB from Columbia University in 1954, before working in the Eisenhower administration&#x27;s United States Department of Justice. He thereafter practiced law in Washington, D.C., and New York City before joining the University of Texas&#x27; law school in 1966.

As a legal academic, Graglia was very conservative. He was a critic of affirmative action and racial quotas, and a critic of some aspects of judicial review, believing that the courts are an illegitimate avenue for securing social change.

His wife, F. Carolyn Graglia, is an author who has written a book critical of feminism entitled &quot;Domestic Tranquility: A Brief Against Feminism&quot;.

Graglia died on January 30, 2022, in Austin, Texas.

== Failed nomination to the Fifth Circuit ==

In the mid-1980s, Graglia was considered by President Ronald Reagan for a newly created federal judgeship on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, but he eventually was withdrawn in late spring 1986 due to controversy over articles Graglia had written about desegregation busing as well as remarks Graglia made which were alleged to be racially insensitive. The following year, Reagan nominated Jerry Edwin Smith to the seat to which Graglia had been nominated, and Smith was confirmed easily.

== Racist remarks ==
Graglia made a speech on UT campus in 1997 in which he said that &quot;blacks and Mexican-Americans can&#x27;t compete academically with whites.&quot; The speech was at a meeting of the Students for Equal Opportunity on the topic of the &quot;Hopwood v. Texas&quot; case, which ended affirmative action for UT Law applicants who were members of a designated &quot;minority&quot; group (in 2003 the Supreme Court abrogated Hopwood in &quot;Grutter v. Bollinger&quot;). The comment was widely reported and generated discussions across the country.

In an article titled &quot;The Affirmative Action Fraud&quot;, published in 1999 in the &quot;Journal of Urban and Contemporary Law&quot;, Graglia cited &quot;The Bell Curve&quot;, a book by professor Richard J. Herrnstein and American Enterprise Institute political scientist Charles Murray, to assert the following:
In 2009 Graglia was a speaker at a conference organized by white separatist Michael H. Hart on the claimed need to defend &quot;America&#x27;s Judeo-Christian heritage and European identity.&quot;

In 2012, he suggested that blacks and Hispanics are falling behind in education because they are increasingly raised in single-parent families.

<text>The Gospel of Mary is an early Christian text discovered in 1896 in a fifth-century papyrus codex written in Sahidic Coptic. This Berlin Codex was purchased in Cairo by German diplomat Carl Reinhardt.

Although the work is popularly known as the Gospel of Mary, it is not classed as a gospel by most scholars, who restrict the term &#x27;gospel&#x27; to texts &quot;primarily focused on recounting the teachings and/or activities of Jesus during his adult life&quot;.

== History ==

The Berlin Codex, also known as the Akhmim Codex, also contains the &quot;Apocryphon of John&quot;, the &quot;Sophia of Jesus Christ&quot;, and a summary of the &quot;Act of Peter&quot;. All four works contained in the manuscript are written in the Sahidic dialect of Coptic. Two other fragments of the Gospel of Mary have been discovered since, both written in Greek (Papyrus Oxyrhynchus L 3525 and Papyrus Rylands 463). P.Oxy. L 3525 &quot;... was in fact found by Grenfell and Hunt some time between 1897 and 1906, but only published in 1983,&quot;
by P. J. Parsons.

The two fragments were published in 1938 and 1983 respectively, and the Coptic translation was published in 1955 by Walter Till.

Dating the gospel, as with most ancient literary texts, is problematic. As the earliest extant fragment of the gospel (the Rylands papyrus) dates to the early Third Century, it must predate this. Karen L. King, Hollis Professor of Divinity at Harvard Divinity School, suggested that the gospel was composed early in the Second Century, noting that it evidences familiarity with the Gospel of John, and perhaps the letters of Paul, thus likely postdating 190–200 CE. Christopher Tuckett&#x27;s discussion in his 2007 volume notes Pasquier&#x27;s preference for a date in the second half of the century; Tuckett himself ultimately opts for a middle positionhe places it in the first half of the Second Century but later than King.

The Gospel of Mary is not present in the list of apocryphal books of section five of the Decretum Gelasianum.

== The identity of &quot;Mary&quot; ==
Scholars do not always agree which of the New Testament people named Mary is the central character of the Gospel of Mary. Stephen J. Shoemaker and F. Stanley Jones have suggested that she may be Mary the mother of Jesus. Barbara J. Silvertsen alternatively suggests that she may be a sister of Jesus - an individual who has largely been lost in history. Silvertsen says that while none of the canonical Gospels identifies Jesus&#x27;s sisters by name (, ), one of his sisters is identified as &quot;Mary&quot; in the Gospel of Philip. 

Arguments in favor of Mary Magdalene are based on her status as a known follower of Jesus, her appearance in other early Christian writings. She is mentioned as accompanying Jesus on his journeys () and is listed in the Gospel of Matthew as being present at his crucifixion () and along with the ‘other Mary’ being the first to see the Risen Lord (). In the Gospel of John, she is recorded as the sole first witness of Jesus’ resurrection (); ( later manuscripts).

Esther A. de Boer compares her role in other non-canonical texts, noting that &quot;in the Gospel of Mary it is Peter who is opposed to Mary’s words, because she is a woman. Peter has the same role in the Gospel of Thomas and in Pistis Sophia. In Pistis Sophia the Mary concerned is identified as Mary Magdalene.&quot; The final scene in the Gospel of Mary may also provide evidence that Mary is indeed Mary Magdalene. Levi, in his defense of Mary and her teaching, tells Peter, &quot;Surely the Saviour knows her very well. That is why he loved her more than us.&quot; In the Gospel of Philip, a similar statement is made about Mary Magdalene.

King also argues in favor of naming Mary Magdalene as the central figure in the Gospel of Mary. She summarizes: “It was precisely the traditions of Mary as a woman, as an exemplary disciple, a witness to the ministry of Jesus, a visionary of the glorified Jesus, and someone traditionally in contest with Peter, that made her the only figure who could play all the roles required to convey the messages and meanings of the Gospel of Mary.”

Richard Valantasis writes in &quot;The Beliefnet Guide to Gnosticism and Other Vanished Christianities&quot; (see Beliefnet) that the Mary here is Mary Magdalene. Valantasis clarifies that this does not “confirm an earthly marriage between her and Jesus – far from it – but it opens an incredible window into the intellectual and spiritual world of the second century C.E.” The idea that there would be a gospel from Mary Magdalene is “controversial,” however because Andrew objected to the strangeness of Mary’s revelations from Jesus. Peter argued, as Valantasis mentions, that “Jesus would not have revealed such important teachings to a woman,” and that “her stature cannot be greater than that of the male apostles.&quot;
Although Valantasis suggests that ‘The idea that there would be a gospel from Mary Magdalene is “controversial” this suggests that the text was authored by Mary Magdalene which is certainly not the case. Whilst myths about Magdalene abound, there is no legend or myth that she authored a gospel.’

== Contents ==
The most complete text of the Gospel of Mary is contained in the Berlin Codex, but even so, it is missing six manuscript pages at the beginning of the document and four manuscript pages in the middle. As such, the narrative begins in the middle of a scene, leaving the setting and circumstances unclear. King believes, however, that references to the death of Jesus and the commissioning scene later in the narrative indicate the setting in the first section of the text is a post-resurrection appearance of Christ. As the narrative opens, Jesus is engaged in dialogue with his disciples, answering their questions on the nature of matter and the nature of sin. At the end of the discussion, Jesus departs, leaving the disciples distraught and anxious. According to the story, Mary speaks up with words of comfort and encouragement. Then Peter asks Mary to share with them any special teaching she received from the Jesus, “Peter said to Mary, ‘Sister, we know that the Savior loved you more than the rest of the women. Tell us the words of the Savior which you rememberwhich you know (but) we do not, nor have we heard them.’” Mary responds to Peter’s request by recounting a conversation she had with Christ about visions.

(Mary) said, &quot;I saw the Lord in a vision and I said to him, ‘Lord, I saw you today in a vision.’&quot; He answered and said to me: “Blessed are you, that you did not waver at the sight of me. For where the mind is, there is the treasure.&quot; I said to him, &quot;So now, Lord, does a person who sees a vision see it &lt;through&gt; the soul &lt;or&gt; through the spirit?&quot;

In the conversation, Jesus teaches that the inner self is composed of soul, spirit/mind, and a third mind that is between the two which sees the vision. Then the text breaks off and the next four pages are missing. When the narrative resumes, Mary is no longer recalling her discussion with Christ. She is instead recounting the revelation given to her in her vision. The revelation describes an ascent of a soul, which as it passes on its way to its final rest, engages in dialogue with four powers that try to stop it.

Her vision does not meet with universal approval:

But Andrew answered and said to the brethren, &quot;Say what you think concerning what she said. For I do not believe that the Savior said this. For certainly these teachings are of other ideas.&quot;

Peter also opposed her in regard to these matters and asked them about Jesus. &quot;Did he then speak secretly with a woman, in preference to us, and not openly? Are we to turn back and all listen to her? Did he prefer her to us?&quot;

== Interpretation ==
The Gospel of Mary is often interpreted as a Gnostic text. According to Pheme Perkins, on the basis of thirteen works she has analyzed, the Gospel follows a format similar to other known Gnostic dialogues which contain a revelation discourse framed by narrative elements. The dialogues are generally concerned with the idea of Jesus Christ as reminder to human beings of their bond with God and true identity, as well as the realization of the believer that redemption consists of the return to God and liberty from matter after death. The Gospel of Mary contains two of these discourses (7:1–9:4 and 10:10–17:7) including addresses to New Testament figures (Peter, Mary, Andrew and Levi) and an explanation of sin as adultery (encouragement toward an ascetic lifestyle) which also suit a Gnostic interpretation. Scholars also say that the fifth-century Coptic version of the Gospel is part of the Berlin Codex along with the Apocryphon of John and The Sophia of Jesus Christ which are typically viewed as Gnostic texts; however, while many scholars take for granted the Gnostic character of the Gospel of Mary, the Gnostic beliefs concerning creation theory and the Demiurge that would suggest an extreme dualism in the creation are not present in the portions currently retrieved.

According to Bart Ehrman, &quot;Mary (Magdalene) is accorded a high status among the apostles of Jesus.&quot; Levi actually acknowledges that Jesus loved her more than he loved all of the other apostles. Mary said she had a conversation with Jesus, and Andrew and Peter questioned this. &quot;Four pages are lost from the manuscript&quot;, so there is really no way for anyone to know exactly what happened.

De Boer (2004) suggests that the Gospel of Mary should not be read as a Gnostic specific text, but that it is to be &quot;interpreted in the light of a broader Christian context&quot;. She argues that the Gospel stems from a monistic view of creation rather than the dualistic one central to Gnostic theology and also that the Gospel’s views of both Nature and an opposite nature are more similar to Jewish, Christian, and Stoic beliefs. She suggests that the soul is not to be freed from Powers of Matter, but rather from the powers of the opposite nature. She also says that the Gospel’s main purpose is to encourage fearful disciples to go out and preach the gospel.

Karen King considers the work to provide

an intriguing glimpse into a kind of Christianity lost for almost fifteen hundred years...[it] presents a radical interpretation of Jesus&#x27; teachings as a path to inner spiritual knowledge; it rejects His suffering and death as the path to eternal life; it exposes the erroneous view that Mary of Magdala was a prostitute for what it isa piece of theological fiction; it presents the most straightforward and convincing argument in any early Christian writing for the legitimacy of women&#x27;s leadership; it offers a sharp critique of illegitimate power and a utopian vision of spiritual perfection; it challenges our rather romantic views about the harmony and unanimity of the first Christians; and it asks us to rethink the basis for church authority.

King concludes that “both the content and the text’s structure lead the reader inward toward the identity, power and freedom of the true self, the soul set free from the Powers of Matter and the fear of death”. “The Gospel of Mary is about inter-Christian controversies, the reliability of the disciples’ witness, the validity of teachings given to the disciples through post-resurrection revelation and vision, and the leadership of women.”

King also sees evidence for tensions within second-century Christianity, reflected in &quot;the confrontation of Mary with Peter, [which is] a scenario also found in &quot;The Gospel of Thomas&quot;, &quot;Pistis Sophia&quot;, and the &quot;Coptic Gospel of the Egyptians&quot;. Peter and Andrew represent orthodox positions which deny the validity of esoteric revelation and reject the authority of women to teach.&quot; 

Sarah Parkhouse argues that the Gospel of Mary is eschatological in nature. She states that it &#x27;draws on the conceptual world of the second century, reformulating the ‘last things’ in light of the Christian message&#x27;. In this eschatology, the focus is on Christian life in the present rather than the future coming of Christ. 

Tuckett argues that the women followers in the Gospel of Mary are positive role models for the reader. They are frequently contrasted with the men who fall short of expectations. The women are shown to be fallible, as are the men, but this is implicitly forgiven. Tuckett also states that Mary fulfils the role of the Savior in the Gospel of Mary in numerous ways.

<text>Norweb, originally the North Western Electricity Board, was a British electricity supply and distribution company. It supplied electricity to about 4.7 million industrial, commercial and domestic customers in the North West of England, although Merseyside and parts of Cheshire were instead covered by Manweb.

==History==
===Nationalised industry===
The board was originally formed in 1948, as part of the nationalisation of the electricity industry by the Electricity Act 1947. The board was responsible for the purchase of electricity from the electricity generator (the Central Electricity Generating Board from 1958) and its distribution and sale to customers. The key people on the board were: Chairman R. F. Richardson (1964, 1967), Deputy Chairman F. Linley (1964, 1967), full-time member J. W. K. Evans (1967).

The total number of customers supplied by the board was as follows:

===Post privatisation===

The assets of the board passed to Norweb plc in July 1990, which was privatised in a stock market flotation later in the same year.

Norweb was acquired by North West Water in October 1995 for £1.83 billion. The combined water and electricity companies became United Utilities (UU). The customer base for the electricity supply arm was subsequently sold off in March 2000 to TXU Corporation, as Norweb Energi. TXU was itself acquired by Powergen in October 2002. Powergen was a subsidiary of E.ON at this point (having been acquired earlier in 2002), and was subsequently rebranded to E.ON UK in 2007.

The value electrical retailing arm Norweb Retail was sold to the Kingfisher Group in November 1996 for £51 million; seeing the closure of the Bolton head office, the CAS distribution centre in Worsley, the flagship Coventry 285, 57 high street stores and half of its out of town superstores. Remaining stores were rebranded under the name Comet.

UU retained the remainder of the company, including the distribution network in the northwest of England, as Norweb Distribution. In November 2001, Norweb was renamed United Utilities Electricity.

The company was the licensed distribution network operator for the North West England, until its sale in December 2007 to North West Electricity Networks, a joint venture between Colonial First State and JPMorgan Chase. Electricity North West became the licensed distribution network operator for the North West of England, as a consequence of the sale.

==Headquarters==
A new headquarters building for the board was built in 1963 on the site of the Dickinson Street power station in Manchester. The architects of this steel-framed building were Harry S. Fairhurst &amp; Son. The project required the draining and infilling of an arm of the Rochdale Canal. The staircases, lifts and cloakrooms are in the eastern wing, separate from the offices.
==Cultural references==
English Rugby league team Wigan Warriors had Norweb as their primary shirt sponsor between 1988 and 1999 (as TXU Energi between 1998 and 1999). This period saw Wigan win many trophies: two Charity Shields in 1991 and 1995, seven of their eight record consecutive Challenge Cup Final wins 1989 to 1995, two World Club Challenge wins in 1991 and 1994, five Premiership Final wins between 1992 and 1997 in six consecutive appearances, two Lancashire Cup wins in 1988 and 1992, five John Player Special and Regal Trophy wins between 1989 and 1996 in six final appearances, seven successive league titles between 1990 and 1996 and a Super League title in 1998. Wigan&#x27;s most successful season of that period was in 1994-95 when Wigan won the Grand Slam of all four trophies/cups. Norweb also sponsored a tram named &quot;The Power&quot; on the Manchester Metrolink network. Norweb&#x27;s &quot;The Power&quot; advertising hoardings also featured prominently inside Manchester United&#x27;s Old Trafford ground in the early 1990s.

Norweb was also referenced in &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;, which was originally produced in Manchester. Holly, the on board computer of the mining ship Red Dwarf, played a practical joke on Dave Lister. According to Holly, the Norweb Federation were looking for Lister for his crimes against humanity; leaving two half eaten sausages on his table before leaving, which over three million years had gone mouldy and now covered seven-eighths of the Earth&#x27;s surface. Lister also owns 98% of all the planet Earth’s wealth due to £17.50 left in his bank account that was subject to compound interest and hoarded so nobody else had any money except Norweb, as Lister had left a light on in the bathroom. This all results in a final £180 billion demand from Lister before Holly reveals his gag.

Norweb is referenced in the Frank Sidebottom (aka Chris Sievey) song &quot;Electricity&quot; which is on his LP &quot;5:9:88&quot;. In the song Frank (supposedly) loses his electricity bill down a drain and he sings &quot;I remember thinking I should inform Norweb now...&quot; He heads off the Norweb office to address the matter but window shops and arrives too late. When Frank returns home his electricity is cut off and his mum sends him to his room. The song is rather detailed and specifically mentions the location of a Norweb office in George Street, Altrincham in the Borough of Trafford. Apparently Sievey had experience with his electricity being cut off and this song, perhaps, conveys a real life situation.

<doc id="1327164" wikidata="Q1999375" url="?curid=1327164" title="Loísmo">
<text>Loísmo, with its feminine counterpart laísmo, is a feature of certain dialects of Spanish consisting of the use of the pronouns &#x27;,&#x27;, &#x27;, and&#x27; (which are normally used for direct objects) in place of the pronouns &quot;le&quot; and &quot;les&quot; (which are used for indirect objects). &quot;Loísmo&quot; and &quot;laísmo&quot; are almost entirely restricted to some dialects in central Spain; they are virtually absent from formal and written language. In practice &quot;laísmo&quot; is much more frequent than &quot;loísmo&quot;.

A simple example would be saying &quot;lo hablé&quot; (lit. &quot;I spoke him&quot;), &quot;la hablé&quot; (lit. &quot;I spoke her&quot;), &quot;los hablé&quot; (lit. &quot;I spoke them [masculine]&quot;), or &quot;las hablé&quot; (lit. &quot;I spoke them [feminine]&quot;) where a speaker of a dialect without &quot;loísmo&quot; would say &quot;le(s) hablé&quot; (&quot;I spoke to him/her/them&quot;).

This effectively means the loss of a declensional case marker. The difference between &quot;lo&quot; (accusative case) and &quot;le&quot; (dative case) are holdovers from Latin declension. The general trend in the evolution of Spanish has been to drop such declensions, but most dialects of Spanish have preserved this feature for object pronouns. It just happens that speakers with &quot;loísmo&quot; have further lost this distinction, replacing it with a different distinction of a semantic kind.

Another effect of &quot;loísmo&quot; and &quot;laísmo&quot; is that the gender of the indirect object is clearer than it would be using &quot;le&quot;. One issue with non-&quot;loísmo&quot; dialects is that the &quot;le&quot; pronoun is ambiguous, as it does not specify gender. For example, &quot;le doy un beso&quot; can mean &quot;I give him a kiss&quot;, &quot;I give her a kiss&quot;, or even &quot;I give you (formal) a kiss&quot;. One way around this ambiguity is to clarify the pronoun with a prepositional phrase; for our example, this would mean &quot;le doy un beso a él&quot;, &quot;le doy un beso a ella&quot;, or &quot;le doy un beso a usted&quot;, respectively. Since &quot;lo&quot; indicates masculine and &quot;la&quot; indicates feminine, using &quot;loísmo&quot; and &quot;laísmo&quot; means that this clarification is not necessary.

&quot;Loísmo&quot; can also seemingly change the meaning of certain phrases, since some verbs take on a different meaning based on the case of their objects. For example, &quot;le pegué&quot; means &quot;I struck him&quot;, but a speaker with &quot;loísmo&quot; would say &quot;lo pegué&quot;, which literally means &quot;I pasted/stuck him (onto something)&quot; in dialects without &quot;loísmo&quot;.

== &quot;Loísmo&quot; and the &quot;Real Academia Española&quot; ==
The &quot;Real Academia Española&quot; listed &quot;loísmo&quot; and &quot;laísmo&quot; as correct in 1771; however, it condemned their use in 1796. The Academy&#x27;s online grammar guide currently states it is &quot;inappropriate&quot; to use them.

The lack of acceptance from the RAE has caused a certain classist or social stigma to be attached to &quot;loísmo&quot; and those who use it. This often leads to hypercorrection, with &quot;loístas&quot; choosing the &quot;le&quot; pronoun even for direct objects as a form of &quot;leísmo&quot;.

<doc id="1327169" wikidata="Q383264" url="?curid=1327169" title="Afife">
<text>Afife is a civil parish located in the Portuguese municipality of Viana do Castelo. The population in 2011 was 1,632, in an area of 13.03 km2.

==History==

The date of the parish&#x27;s founding is unclear, although archaeological evidence in this area (castros, cromlechs and menhir) attest to a human presence to the Neolithic. Of the castro structures still located within the region, two share some importance: the castro Morro dos Mouros, and Cividade, which was located in a high mountaintop and separated the settlements of Afife from Âncora (in the neighbouring municipality of Caminha). The latter was a strongly defended fortification with thick walls, which today only exist remnants. Closer to the sea, is the Castro of Santo António, so called due to the existence of a chapel there dedicated to Saint Anthony of Padua, and which extends atop a small mountain. in the southeast. In addition, there is the castro of Cutro, where the vestiges of access road were discovered and two others in Agrichouso, in addition to several throughout the mountains. Similarly a Roman-era villa, in Baganheiras, burial mounds in Modorro and possibly in Concheiro, several funerary vases, and rock remnants of salting vats, as well as agricultural implements, indicate the presence of humans during the civilized periods of historical occupation.

Celts and Phoenician traders may have settled in this region, along the coast, although these are only speculations. The resettlement of Afife, began with the Count of Tui, D. Paio Vermundes, or his sons, when the lands between the Minho and Lima Rivers were under his domain. Documents from the 10th century, identifying several settlements along the coast and suggesting an occupation after 868, but before 890. It is unclear whether at this time the region was referred to as &quot;Fifi&quot; or &quot;Afifi&quot; (nomenclatures which first appeared at the end of the 9th century), or if it received this name from its founder or principal resident. It is possible that Afife arises from the Arab word &quot;Afif&quot;, which is an adjective designating that someone is &quot;virtuous&quot;; much later, the name appeared in 1108, suggesting the existence of a &quot;Villa Afif&quot;, that obtained the name from its master. Along the centuries, the toponymy appeared variously as Fifi, Affifi, Afifi and Afife. Popular interpretations suggest that the place-name is Roman, from &quot;Aff-hifas&quot;, indicating &quot;sopa de cabelos&quot; (&quot;hair soup&quot;). These definitions come from a period when Roman legions invaded the Lusitanian territory, massacring the population, including women. In order to escape the horrors, some of these women disfigured themselves, cutting their hair and throwing the tresses into springs. When thirsty soldiers went to one of these fountains, they discovered a hair in the water, referring to the area as &quot;soup of hair&quot;.

Title of Afife was held in the hands of Mendo Pais (one of the sons of the Count of Tui) and, later, one of his nephews, Paio Soares, before being transferred to the Monastery of São Salvador da Torre (at its foundation). The subsequent fate of the holdings of the monastery are not concrete, since the monastery went into ruins and its possessions were appropriated by others around the 10th century, and after the Moorish invasions of Almançor. The monastery was rebuilt after the 11th century, by the descendant of Paio Vermundes, presbyter Ordonho Enes.

The founding of the Monastery of São João de Cabanas occurred in the middle of the 6th century. Friar Leão de São Tomaz, a Benedictine monk, who lived during the era of Martin of Braga, suggested that this monastery located in the territory of Afife was established by the cleric. Some historians suggest that these declarations were premature, noting the construction of the monastery around 564, while other documents suggest 602. A century later, the monastery was a rich centre of religion in the region: &quot;...all the lands of the mount of Âncora and waters to the river until the sea, and in addition to the river, also called Âncora, to the east which included three miles of land, and another three to the west, which had tithes, covenants and rents.&quot; The founder of the monastery left the institution in a favourable condition, lasting the reigns of Sebastian and Philip I, acting as a religious centre for convalescence and aid of the sick. But, judicial actions by powerful peoples, suggest that this institution followed the Order of Christ.

The 1258 Inquirições (&quot;Inqueries&quot;) confirm most of these facts, and also describe the existence of two villages in the , Affifi and Vila Meiãa, and several houses associated with the Monastery of São Salvador da Torre. During this epoch, the two villages and parish church were owned partially by the Crown, but the creation of the municipality of Viana do Castelo would change this. King Afonso III of Portugal approached the Bishop of Tui to abrogate his authority over the parish of Couto de Vinha in this new restructuring, but finding no support, the monarch transferred the royal lands of Afife and Vila Meã to Viana do Castelo. Similarly, the Sé of Braga also possessed lands within the region. At the time of the Royal inventory, the monastery of São João de Cabanas was controlled by the Royal court, and King Sancho I (in 1187).

Father Carvalho, around this time, listed Afife, in whole or in part, pertained to King Afonso III, granted half of this parish to the church of Santa Maria de Sá, in Ponte de Lima, in 1262, which pertained to the Episcopal seat of Tui, in exchange for patronage of Santa Maria da Vinha in Areosa. This was supported by documents in the possession of the Bishop of Tui, around 1258–1259, that situated the territory (within the territory of Entre Lima and Minho), as &quot;medietas domini regis&quot;. King Denis later provided a tax in 1320, to elaborate the parish, situating the parish of Santa Cristina de Afife within the Terra de Vinha.

In the census of Diogo de Sousa (1514–1532), which was used to specify the annual payments to the archdiocese by the 140 residents, Afife is mentioned as a place within the municipality of Viana. A similar census by friar Baltasar Limpo (1551–1581) noted that Santa Cristina de Afife was part of the Terra de Viana, which was partially owned by the clergy of the Monastery of São Salvador.

In the 16th century, Afife was a rectory of the convent of São Domingos de Viana, and under the military jurisdiction of the Order of Christ.

==Geography==
Afife is located along the northern border of the municipality of Viana do Castelo, approximately 10 kilometres from the municipal seat. It is neighbours include the civil parish of Vila Praia de Âncora (municipality of Caminha) and Freixieiro de Soutelo (in the municipality of Viana do Castelo) to the north; the parish of Carreço, and a small area of the parish of Areosa, (within the municipality of Viana do Castelo) to the south; the parish of Outeiro to the east; and fronting the Atlantic Ocean in the west.

Situated between the ocean and Santa Luzia mountains, Afife is situated in an ecological landscape that includes white sand beaches, along its coast. The Cabanas River is the main affluente in the parish, whose source lies within the Santa Luzia Mountains, and crosses the parish (and village), while the Ribeira de Afife (and its three affluents: the Ribeira da Pedreira, Ribeira de Agrichousa and Ribeira do Fojo) complement the water sources.

The beaches of Afife are isolated by a large curtain of dunes, whose growth have recently necessitated measure to limit desertification.

On its banks is located on the Convent of Cabanas, founded in the 10th century, is the most important Monument of the parish.

==Economy==
Historically, Afife was a place known for fish captures and, for a time, whaling. One of the few economic industries along the coast was the collection of seaweed, an industry controlled by a rigorous agreement between the participants. A job handled by women, the seaweed was transported to the dunes after collection, dried and then sold from large mounds to farmers.

The fertile lands, which have supported the majority of its citizens throughout the centuries, have been supported by several small parcels.
Tourism, small industry and commerce are the primary industries in the region. Initially based on primary sector industries, the economy in this parish has benefited from its location along the Atlantic Ocean, and, over the last few decades, reoriented its economy.
After the 18th century, decorative gesso became an important contribution to the local economy, supported by professional programs to teach the skill.

==Culture==
Traditional festivals in the parish include: the festival of São João (held on 24 June); Santo António (13 June); and Nossa Senhora da Lapa (between 12 and 14 July).

Gastronomically, the parish is known for , , and .

The main socio-cultural organizations include the &quot;Casino Afifense, ADA – Associação Desportiva Afifense&quot;, &quot;NAIAA – Núcleo Amador de Investigação Arqueológica de Afife&quot;, &quot;Ronda da Costa Verde&quot; and &quot;Grupo de Danças e Cantares de Afife&quot;, &quot;APCA – Associação de Protecção e Conservação do Ambiente&quot;.

The British watercolour painter Susanna Roope Dockery, who lived in Porto had a small cottage in Afife, which she used as a base for trips to paint rural scenes.

<text>The Glass Teat: Essays of Opinion on Television is a 1970 compilation of television reviews and essays written by Harlan Ellison as a regular weekly column for the &quot;Los Angeles Free Press&quot; from late 1968 to early 1970, discussing the effects of television upon society. 

==Summary==
The title implies that TV viewers are analogous with unweaned children. Discussion of television is frequently interspersed in the essays with lengthy asides about Ellison&#x27;s personal life, experiences and opinions in general.

==Reception and legacy==
Modern critics have noted that his criticisms remain relevant. The book&#x27;s topics were dictated by the trends and fashions of the day. 

Ellison later collected a second volume of criticism entitled &quot;The Other Glass Teat&quot;, which was published in 1975.

<text>Crikvenica () is a town in Croatia, located on the Adriatic in the Primorje-Gorski Kotar County.

==Names==

The names of the town in various languages include:
* 
* 

==Geography==

Crikvenica is located southeast of Rijeka and is the largest settlement on the coast of the Vinodol coastal area.

Towns near Crikvenica include Kraljevica, Selce and Novi Vinodolski.

Over the last twenty years, urban expansion of Crikvenica itself and of the nearby town of Selce has resulted in the two merging into a mini-conglomerate.

==Population==

In the 2011 census, Crikvenica had a total municipal population of 11,122, in the following settlements:
* Crikvenica, population 6,860
* Dramalj, population 1,485
* Jadranovo, population 1,224
* Selce, population 1,553

== History ==
Crikvenica was developed on the site of a Roman era settlement and military base called &quot;Ad Turres&quot;. Old Crikvenica was originally an offshoot of the village of Kotor, which is located on a nearby hill and shares its name with that of the village.

The name of the town derives from the word for &#x27;church&#x27; (Croatian: &quot;crkva&quot;, in dialect &quot;crikva&quot;), referring to the monastery church of the Pauline Fathers, which was built by Nikola IV Frankopan nearby in 1412. Nikola IV. Frankopan issued a grant in Modruš, which is also the oldest written document in which the name Crikvenica is mentioned. Beside the church and the monastery at the mouth of the Dubračina, the nearby port of Grižane grew up. In 1760 the local worthy moved from Bribir to Crikvenica and thus it became the centre of the whole Vinodol coast. A great fire of 1776, in which nearly entire Kotor was burnt down, accelerated the migration from the hills towards the coastal areas.

In the 19th century Crikvenica began to attract many tourists, which brought about a turning point in its history. In 1877 a harbour was built in Crikvenica, in 1888 a bathing beach and as early as 1891 the first hotel had opened. In 1895 the Hotel Therapia was opened with 120 beds and a Hydrotherapy Institute. In 1902 the Hotel Crikvenica was built, in 1903 the Bellevue and in 1905 the Miramare. In 1906 Crikvenica became officially a health resort and due to its favourable climate, in the space of just 16 years Crikvenica became the most important resort on the riviera. Today, together with Selce, it is one of the most attractive parts of the Kvarner coast, as well as of the North Adriatic coast of Croatia in general.

In the late 19th and early 20th century, Crikvenica was a district capital in the Modruš-Rijeka County of the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia.

== Archaeology ==
A Roman ceramic workshop was discovered at Crikvenica, in an archaeological site called Igralište. The workshop operated from the latter part of the 1st century BC until the conclusion of the 2nd century AD, producing various ceramic items such as construction materials, amphorae, and pottery.

==Sport==
NK Crikvenica is an association football team that play in the Third Football League, at the Gradski stadion, which is located near the centre of Crikvenica. The European route E65 (Jadranska magistrala) dominates the view to the south. The stadium once had a motorcycle speedway track around the pitch and hosted significant competitions such as a qualifying round of the 1970 Speedway World Team Cup and the Yugoslavian National championship.

==Notable people==
*Josif Pančić (1814–1888), botanist
*Ljerko Spiller (1908–2008), Croatian and Argentine violinist
* The family of Argentine Cardinal Estanislao Esteban Karlic (born 1926) came from in the village of Karlići near Grižane, a small village approximately outside Crikvenica

<doc id="1327203" wikidata="Q728039" url="?curid=1327203" title="Edwyn Collins">
<text>Edwyn Stephen Collins (born 23 August 1959) is a Scottish musician, producer and record label owner. Collins was the lead singer for the 1980s post-punk band Orange Juice, which he co-founded. After the group split in 1985, Collins started a solo career. His 1994 single &quot;A Girl Like You&quot; was a worldwide hit.

In February 2005, Collins was hospitalised after two cerebral haemorrhages which resulted in aphasia, and he needed months to recover. He resumed his musical career in 2007. A documentary film on his recovery, &quot;The Possibilities Are Endless&quot;, was released in 2014.

Collins was the co-founder of the indie record label Postcard Records and co-founded a second label, Analogue Enhanced Digital, in 2011. Collins has also worked as an illustrator, television actor, television producer and record producer. He won an Ivor Novello Award, the Ivor Inspiration Award, in 2009.

==Early life==
Collins was born in Edinburgh. He lived in Dundee from the age of six to 14 after his father got a job as a lecturer at Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design. He attended the now-defunct Demonstration School in Park Place, where new educational ideas were tried out by students and teachers from the adjacent teacher training college, before moving to the secondary school, Morgan Academy.

==Career==
===Orange Juice===

Collins co-founded the band the Nu-Sonics in 1976 in the Glasgow suburb of Bearsden. The band changed its name to Orange Juice in 1979. Collins and his friend Alan Horne founded the record label Postcard Records that year to release the band&#x27;s singles. The band&#x27;s debut single, &quot;Falling and Laughing&quot; was issued in February 1980. Although critically acclaimed, the single only sold 2,000 copies.

After three more singles with Postcard, Orange Juice signed to Polydor Records in October 1981 and released their debut album, &quot;You Can&#x27;t Hide Your Love Forever&quot;, in March 1982. The band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Rip It Up&quot; followed in November 1982. Their single &quot;Rip It Up&quot;, released in early 1983, reached number 8 on the UK Singles Chart and was noted as the first British hit single to feature a bass-line from the Roland TB-303 synthesizer. The song was their only Top 40 single.

The band&#x27;s two subsequent albums, &quot;Texas Fever&quot; and &quot;The Orange Juice&quot;, were both released in 1984. They failed to find the same success as &quot;Rip It Up&quot;.

Orange Juice disbanded in January 1985, after Polydor grew dissatisfied with the band&#x27;s lack of success and the band&#x27;s difficulty finding a new label to sign with. During this time in his career, Collins met Grace Maxwell, whom he hired as his manager and later married.

Collins started his solo career in 1986, and signed to Elevation Records, a label that was a co-venture between indie label Creation Records and major label Warner Music.

===Solo career to 2005===
Collins released two singles for the Elevation label in 1987, both produced by Robin Guthrie of the Cocteau Twins, but both failed to enter the UK Singles Chart. Elevation was closed in November 1987, just ten months after it released its first single. After the closure, Collins experienced a &quot;falling out&quot; with Creation Records founder Alan McGee, who had financed Elevation. As a result, unlike other Elevation signees such as Primal Scream and The Weather Prophets, Collins was not migrated to the main Creation label and he was left without a record label contract.

At the request of passionate Orange Juice fans in Germany, Collins recorded his next album at a small German studio, with the aid of producer Dennis Bovell, who had worked with Collins in Orange Juice, and Roddy Frame of Aztec Camera. The album, &quot;Hope and Despair&quot;, was released in 1989 by the Demon label and achieved success as an independent release. Demon also released Collins&#x27;s next record, &quot;Hellbent on Compromise&quot; (1990), which was not as successful as its predecessor. Demon and Collins then parted ways and Collins embarked on a lengthy hiatus.

Collins built his own recording studio in 1994 that was used to record his third solo album, &quot;Gorgeous George&quot;, which he also produced. The studio, located in West Hampstead, London, would become the West Heath Yard Studios that Collins would use for his future record label, AED Records.

In 1995, Collins released the single &quot;A Girl Like You&quot;, which became a hit in both the United Kingdom and United States after it was featured in the film &quot;Empire Records&quot;. It was subsequently used in the movie &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels: Full Throttle&quot; in 2003.

Collins released his followup to &quot;Gorgeous George&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Not Following You&quot;, in 1997. One of its singles, &quot;The Magic Piper (of Love)&quot;, was featured on the soundtrack for &quot;Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery&quot; that year and was his only other Top 40 entry on the UK Singles Chart apart from &quot;A Girl Like You.&quot;

===Cerebral haemorrhage===
In a BBC 6 Music radio interview on 18 February 2005, Collins said he felt unwell, but ascribed the nausea and vertigo to food poisoning. Two days later, he was admitted to intensive care in London&#x27;s Royal Free Hospital after apparently suffering a major cerebral haemorrhage. After suffering a second haemorrhage he had an operation on 25 February 2005, which was followed by a lengthy programme of neurological rehabilitation owing to right-sided weakness and difficulty with speech. His aphasia left him able to repeat only four phrases: &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot;, &quot;Grace Maxwell&quot; (his wife&#x27;s name) and &quot;the possibilities are endless&quot;.

===Post-cerebral haemorrhage===
Collins released his sixth solo album, entitled &quot;Home Again&quot;, in September 2007 on Heavenly Records. The album was recorded before his illness but mixed after his discharge from hospital. While still recovering, Collins returned to singing live, including playing a gig at The Arts Theatre in London, UK. A tribute song celebrating his return was recorded by the indie pop band The Candy Twins.

A BBC Scotland documentary, &quot;Edwyn Collins: Home Again&quot;, narrated by Franz Ferdinand frontman Alex Kapranos, was broadcast on 19 May 2008. Filmed during 2007, it follows Collins&#x27;s progress in recovering from his illness and his first return to live performance at the BBC Electric Proms. Collins then performed at the Glastonbury Festival, which was broadcast on 28 June 2008 on BBC Two, and at T in the Park on 10 July 2009 (Collins&#x27;s first ever T in the Park).

On 2 October 2009, Collins&#x27;s wife and manager Grace Maxwell detailed her &quot;running battle&quot; with Warner Music Group and MySpace over his right to allow fans to listen to &quot;A Girl Like You&quot; for free on his MySpace page.

In November 2009, at a gig in London&#x27;s Bloomsbury Ballroom, following a tour of the Scottish Highlands, Collins&#x27;s singing was contrasted with his slow speech: &quot;[W]hen he started to sing, his baritone proved as powerful as ever.&quot; On 20 February 2010, he joined The Maccabees onstage at Brixton Academy for their encore, performing vocals on a rendition of &quot;Rip It Up&quot;.

&quot;Losing Sleep&quot;, Collins&#x27;s first written and recorded album since his 2005 illness, was then released on 13 September 2010 in the UK. The album was recorded at his own West Heath Studios between November 2008 and May 2010, and was produced by Collins and Sebastian Lewsley. Collins and Lewsley first met in 1992, while Collins was producing former Subway Sect frontman Vic Godard&#x27;s album &quot;The End of the Surrey People&quot; and Lewsley was his assistant. For the album, he collaborated with The Cribs&#x27; Ryan Jarman and Johnny Marr, Franz Ferdinand, The Magic Numbers singer Romeo Stodart, The Drums and Roddy Frame. Lewsley explained the recording process of &quot;Losing Sleep&quot; in 2010:

We did each song in a day ... and a day consists of about four hours. So there&#x27;s a real expediency about how it&#x27;s recorded. The whole attitude of the album is just doing that. Not indulging anyone. Not having any band sitting round for days and days. &quot;Have you got a guitar part yet? No? Just do it. You&#x27;ve got a coupla hours.&quot; They [Collins&#x27;s collaborators] all looked quite petrified but they did it.

In 2009, during the making of &quot;Losing Sleep&quot;, Lewsley observed Collins gradually regain his musical proficiency—Lewsley explained: &quot;The studio is more of an instrument again for Edwyn.&quot; The cover art for the album features a collection of bird drawings that Collins started working on in 2005.

On 30 September 2010, Collins and his band broadcast three live songs from the Royal Beacon Hotel in Exmouth for BBC Radio 2&#x27;s &quot;Radcliffe and Maconie Show&quot;. (Stuart Maconie is a former music journalist and his first &quot;NME&quot; article was a review of Collins&#x27;s 1987 gig at the Manchester International.)

On 30 July 2011, Collins performed at the Indietracks festival that was held at the Midland Railway, Butterley, UK. During the 2012 Kendal Calling event Collins sang &quot;A Girl Like You&quot;, with Roddy Frame on guitar and Tim Burgess on backing vocals.

Collins&#x27;s eighth solo album, &quot;Understated&quot;, was released in March 2013 on his own AED Records label and was critically well received, with &quot;God Is in the TV&quot; stating:

Understated is more than just another step to recovery, it is indeed a fine record in its own right, and utterly life-affirming. It&#x27;s also perhaps the ultimate testament to the healing power of music. He lost the ability to read, write, and lost movement in half of his body, but what he didn&#x27;t lose was his gift for coming up with an ear-catching tune, as is proved here. It will make you smile, it may even make you cry, and it&#x27;s an album that reminds you how good it is to be alive.

A documentary film about Collins entitled &quot;The Possibilities Are Endless&quot;, directed by James Hall and Edward Lovelace, was released in November 2014.

==Collaborations with Roddy Frame==
Collins has been friends with Roddy Frame, the frontman for the new wave group Aztec Camera, since they were both signed to Postcard Records in the 1980s. Collins and Frame collaborated on the Aztec Camera album &quot;Stray&quot;, including a live performance of the song &quot;Consolation Prize&quot;.

Frame performed with Collins in November 2007 during Collins&#x27;s first concert after his recovery from a serious illness, and the pair played again at the Glastonbury Festival in June 2008, on the Park Stage, and at the Purcell Rooms in London, UK, in September 2008.

Frame&#x27;s fourth solo album, &quot;Seven Dials&quot;, was released in 2014 on Collins&#x27;s AED record label. Frame explained, following the album&#x27;s release, that he had been inspired to make an album with a full band after his positive experience playing with Collins in 2007 and 2008.

==Production work==
Collins has also worked extensively as a record producer with other artists, including Terrorvision, Vic Godard, Robert Forster, The Cribs, Little Barrie, and Hooton Tennis Club.

In 1999, Collins was invited by the band Space to produce what would have been their third album &quot;Love You More than Football&quot;, which ended up being scrapped. However he is credited as a producer on a few B-sides, and he delivers a brief vocal cameo on the song &quot;Thank You&quot;, where he makes reference to &quot;Falling and Laughing&quot;.

In 2005 Collins produced the Cribs album &quot;The New Fellas&quot; and co-produced the 2013 album &quot;Clarietta&quot;, by Charlie Boyer and the Voyeurs, with Lewsley. He also co-produced The Rails&#x27; debut album &quot;Fair Warning&quot;, released on Island Records in 2014.

Collins also produced &quot;The Official Body&quot;, the third album by the British post-punk band Shopping, which was released on 19 January 2018.

Collins co-produced a collaborative project between Camera Obscura frontwoman Tracyanne Campbell and guitarist Danny Coughlan that was released in May 2018 by Merge Records with the title Tracyanne &amp; Danny.

==Other projects==
In addition to his music career Collins also produced and starred in the Channel 4 television show &quot;West Heath Yard&quot;. Collins released his first book of illustrations, &quot;Some British Birds&quot;, with Morel Books in 2009. Liberty of London printed his bird illustrations on fabric as part of a series of fabrics created in collaboration with musicians; his print is named Ornithology.

==Awards and honours==
In May 2009 Collins won the Ivors Inspiration Award in recognition of his struggles following his 2005 brain haemorrhage.

<text>Cryogenine, also known as vertine or (10α)-4,5-dimethoxy-2-hydroxylythran-12-one, is a biphenylquinolizidine lactone alkaloid from the plants Sinicuichi (&quot;Heimia salicifolia&quot;) and &quot;H. myrtifolia&quot;. The compound has no psychoactive properties in humans up to 310 mg, but has shown anti-inflammatory activity similar to aspirin.

The freebase form melts at 250–251 °C and is soluble in moderately polar organic solvents such as chloroform, methylene chloride, benzene, and methanol, but is insoluble in water and petroleum ether.

In the development of thin layer chromatography plates with diazotized p-nitroaniline spray, cryogenine produces a purple spot (as does sinicuichine, another biphenylquinolizidine lactone alkaloid found in &quot;Heimia&quot; species).

<doc id="1327213" wikidata="Q189431" url="?curid=1327213" title="Creative Zen">
<text>ZEN is a series of portable media players designed and manufactured by Creative Technology Limited from 2004 to 2011. The players evolved from the NOMAD brand through the NOMAD Jukebox series of music players, with the first separate &quot;ZEN&quot; branded models released in 2004. The last Creative Zen player, X-Fi3, was released at the end of 2011.

Three Creative Zens (the Portable Media Center, Micro Photo, and Vision:M) won the Best of CES award from 2004 to 2006 in their respective categories, with the latter winning the overall award. The ZEN series had a strong foothold in Asian Pacific markets, especially in Singapore, the location of the company&#x27;s headquarters.

All players support MP3 and WMA formats, while some models support also WAV and Audible formats. They are bundled with device drivers and Creative MediaSource, a media player that includes transferring and syncing abilities exclusively for the players. Some models are PlaysForSure-certified for being compatible with Windows Media Player via Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) and supporting the Janus DRM. They are natively compatible with Windows, with some also supporting Mac OS X.

== Models ==

=== NOMAD Jukebox Zen series ===
The first models branded as a &quot;Zen&quot; were released under the NOMAD line, and had an anodized aluminium case. The 2.5-inch Fujitsu hard drives ranged from a 20 (NOMAD Jukebox Zen), 30 (Zen NX, Zen Xtra), 40 and 60 GB (Xtra). Unlike the earlier NOMAD Jukebox players, which looked like CD players, these had the appearance of a cassette player.

==== NOMAD Jukebox Zen ====
Announced on October 14, 2002, the NOMAD Jukebox Zen was the first player to include the &quot;Zen&quot; branding. It had the distinct ability to connect via USB 1.1 or FireWire, while subsequent releases had connectivity to USB 2.0. Up to 14 hours of continuous audio playback is achieved by the rechargeable battery, and an optional wired remote gives the player an FM tuner and microphone.

==== NOMAD Jukebox Zen NX ====
The Zen NX, as it was later called, was released on August 20, 2003, as an upgrade to the NOMAD Jukebox Zen, with a removable battery and a slightly smaller size. Included with the player was MediaSource, the music management software that would be used with subsequent Zen players.
==== NOMAD Jukebox Zen Xtra ====
The NOMAD Jukebox Zen Xtra, or the Zen Xtra (renamed by Creative for commercial reasons) was released simultaneously with the Zen NX. The player was presumably named Xtra, thanks to the larger screen. The package includes the player, a leather case with belt-clip, a lithium-ion battery, a USB cable, and a pair of standard earbuds. The Zen Xtra does not support the FM tuner from the original Zen and does not have recording capability.

The Xtra was the first DAP to support RealNetworks&#x27;s Helix DRM, through tailored firmware. The SanDisk Sansa e200R would become the only other player to have this feature.
=== ZEN Portable Media Center ===

The Zen Portable Media Center, announced on January 8, 2004, and released eight months later, is based on Microsoft&#x27;s Portable Media Center interface, runs Windows Mobile and supports WMV, WMA, and MP3, and can display JPEG images; other video formats are supported through transcoding. This device was the first to exclusively support Microsoft&#x27;s Media Transfer Protocol, and was presented at the Consumer Electronics Show in 2004, winning the TechTV Best of CES Award in the Portable Audio and Video category. The player uses a 1.8-inch 20 or 40 GB hard drive from Hitachi. The Zen Portable Media Center was replaced by the ZEN Vision and the ZEN Vision W.
=== ZEN Touch ===

The redesigned 40 GB Zen Touch was released on June 7, 2004. The model incorporated major changes in design, functionality and technology.

The Zen Touch has a smaller form factor and larger backlit blue display in a curved industrial design. In addition, the device uses a touch-sensitive vertical strip on the front of the unit for easier file navigation. These changes were enabled by the use of Hitachi&#x27;s smaller 1.8-inch hard drives. The Touch is available in capacities of 20 and 40 GB. Unlike the previous two generations, the Zen Touch does not have a removable battery, and plays audio for approximately 24 hours. Even though the battery is not removable, it can be replaced rather easily since the case is closed with screws only and the battery attaches with a connector.

The Zen Touch has a brief uncredited appearance in Diet Pepsi&#x27;s commercial which aired during Super Bowl XL featuring P. Diddy. 
=== ZEN Micro ===

The ZEN Micro was released on November 12, 2004, and is a microdrive player available in 10 colors. It is also the first ZEN release that sports the new branding, including capitals for all letters in &quot;Zen&quot;.

The ZEN Micro is much smaller than the Touch and shares a similar interface and controls (including the touchpad, without the &#x27;OK&#x27; button. Making a selection would be done by tapping the touchpad). The Micro has a removable battery rated to last for up to 12 hours of continuous playback. In addition, the player has an LED-backlit LCD, a glowing case, and offers hard disk capacities of 4, 5 and 6 GB.

The Micro also features a built-in FM tuner/recorder, voice recorder and microphone, partitioning for data storage (i.e. acting as a removable hard drive for PCs), and the ability to synchronize contacts, tasks and calendars with Microsoft Outlook. Accessories for the ZEN Micro include matching color speakers, wireless headsets and a wired remote control.

The first 35,000 units shipped worldwide were packaged as a &quot;Limited Edition&quot; package that came with an additional rechargeable battery. Asian models of the Limited Edition included the extra battery and a wired remote control.

At CES 2005, it was announced that the ZEN Micro line would be expanded to include 4 and 6 GB models.

The ZEN Micro optionally supports the Microsoft Media Transfer Protocol and the PlaysForSure certification with updated firmware.

The Micro competed with players such as iPod Mini and Rio Carbon.

=== ZEN (Micro-based hard drive player) ===
The ZEN was released on April 6, 2005, and is slightly larger than the ZEN Micro with a 20 GB hard drive capacity. The ZEN, however, has a magnesium back-casing and the battery is unremovable. This model was initially available in the Asia-Pacific region, but soon became available in the US through Cambridge SoundWorks, a subsidiary of Creative.

=== ZEN Neeon ===

The ZEN Neeon was released on May 17, 2005. It is a throwback to the old Zen Xtra, but in a much smaller size. The 5 GB model has an SNR of 98 dB and a battery life of 16 hours (19 hours with new firmware version). The front has a piano black finish, and the back is anodized aluminium that comes in ten colors. and the LCD screen has a 7 color backlight.

The Creative ZEN Neeon was criticized highly at the time of release for having a slow interface, more specifically slow start-up, menus and song switch. As well, the first released models came with a Windows virus. A later firmware update provided a much quicker start-up time and interface.

Like the Zen Micro, this unit has an FM tuner and a microphone, but also has a line in record function. This model does not use proprietary USB drivers; it is a standard USB mass storage device.

On November 17, 2005, the microdrive player was updated to 6 GB and a new flash range was launched in capacities of 512 MB, 1 GB, and 2 GB. The revised device is equipped with a dual-tone OLED screen. The device is also accompanied by a new marketing campaign, &quot;Put a Face to Your Music&quot;, with emphasis on a whole new range of customizable &quot;Stik-Ons&quot;, which are decal stickers that can be placed and removed from the face of the unit.

=== ZEN MicroPhoto ===
The ZEN MicroPhoto, released on July 28, 2005, shares the same features of the ZEN Micro except Audible.com support (reinstated in firmware versions 1.31.01 and above), and adds an upgraded 262,144-color (18 bpp) OLED screen for displaying photos. To fix the lack of bass with the ZEN Micro, Creative implemented a Bass Boost feature, available in most subsequent players. The 8 GB player is available in the same colors of the Micro and is advertised to store &quot;thousands of JPEGs&quot; or &quot;4,000 songs&quot;. Due to its larger battery, the player can play up to 15 hours of continuous playback, 3 hours longer than its predecessor. The MicroPhoto is the first of many subsequent players with expanded customization, with the ability to use a picture as a custom wallpaper, with color themes to change the tones of it, and six color schemes.

The player was first announced at the 2005 Consumer Electronics Show, where it won the G4TV Best of CES award in the Audio To Go category. In November 2005, the player was the CNET Editor&#x27;s Choice award on CNET.com.

=== ZEN Sleek/Sleek Photo ===

The ZEN Sleek was first available on August 30, 2005, and is an upgrade of the ZEN with a 20 GB hard drive, FM radio, built-in microphone, and sports an aluminium casing. Like its predecessors, it can synchronize with Microsoft Outlook&#x27;s calendar, address book, and memo functions. The player has a battery life of up to 20 hours.

The ZEN Sleek Photo was released on October 6, 2005. It is the color-screen equivalent of the Sleek, with the extra ability to view JPEG photos on an OLED screen.
=== ZEN Vision ===

The ZEN Vision was released on October 1, 2005. Since its launch, it is the winner of several awards, including &quot;Best of Digital Life 2005&quot; and the Red dot design award. Unlike its predecessor, the ZEN Vision does not have Microsoft&#x27;s Portable Media Center interface. It supports audio (WMA-DRM, WMA, MP3, WAV), video (WMV, Motion JPEG, MPEG 1/2/4, DivX 4/5, xvid) and picture (JPEG) playback. The ZEN Vision utilizes a 30 GB 1.8-inch Toshiba hard drive and can partition a part of its hard drive to work as a removable disk (up to 16 GB) for any operating system. There are some features of the ZEN Vision which require compatibility with certain operating systems, e.g. require users to have access to Microsoft Windows XP (SP1 or higher).

Like past models, the ZEN Vision comes with an FM tuner, a voice and FM recorder, and a calendar and organizer that can be synchronized with Microsoft Outlook.

The ZEN Vision has a 3.7-inch, trans-reflective VGA TFT-LCD screen. It has a video output (PAL or NTSC) port and a CompactFlash slot which can be used to transfer the contents to the player. An adapter for other memory card types is also available as an accessory. The ZEN Vision also supports an optional infrared remote.

=== ZEN Vision:M ===
The ZEN Vision:M, launched on December 8, 2005, is adapted from the earlier released Vision. The 2.5-inch, TFT LCD display has a resolution of 320 by 240 pixels (QVGA), and is capable of outputting 640 x 480 using a composite video cable. The player has an estimated battery life of 16 hours for audio, and five hours for videos (tested under continuous playback). Album art is shown during playback, and image-viewing is enhanced with pan, zoom and rotation abilities. The 30 GB model is available in white, black, green, blue and pink. Like the other players in the Vision and Micro lines, this model is known for its glowing button symbols.

The ZEN Vision:M has won a number of accolades, including the &quot;Best of Show&quot; and &quot;Best Portable Audio &amp; Video Device&quot; awards at the 2006 Consumer Electronics Show, as well as the Red Dot Design Award.

On August 31, 2006, Creative announced the availability of an upgraded player with 60 GB capacity. This version has a USB host adapter cable, which enables users to transfer photos from a digital camera directly to the player. It is only available in black and white, and was initially slightly thicker than the 30 GB model. On March 11, 2007, the 60 GB model was upgraded with a new slimmer profile - the same thickness as the 30 GB version.

===ZEN Nano/ZEN Nano Plus===

The ZEN Nano and the ZEN Nano Plus were released internationally on June 1, 2006. The player is a rebranded MuVo N200. The ZEN Nano Plus is a USB mass storage device, and does not require proprietary drivers. It has a battery-life of up to 18 hours using an AAA battery. Like the Micro and the MicroPhoto, the Nano is available in ten colors: black, pink, red, orange, green, light blue, blue, purple, gray, and white.

The ZEN Nano Plus is a Nano with an FM tuner with 30 custom presets, plus voice, radio, and line-in recording. Recorded audio is encoded in WAV (ADPCM), except for line-in, which encodes to MP3.

=== ZEN Neeon 2 ===
The ZEN Neeon 2, a successor to the Neeon, was announced on August 2, 2006. The player has a 1.5-inch CSTN-LCD display in a resolution of 128×128. The 1 and 2 GB models are available in a black, silver, blue, pink or orange backplate, accompanied with a piano black front, while the 4 GB model comes only in black and silver. The Neeon 2 supports MP3, WMA, and WAV, display JPEG images and plays AVI videos which are transcoded upon transfer. Also, the player has an FM tuner, built-in microphone, and line-in recording in WMA. The rechargeable lithium-ion battery plays up to 20 hours of continuous audio playback and up to 8 hours of video playback, the highest for any Creative digital audio player.

Like its predecessor, decal stickers called &quot;Stik-Ons&quot; are sold separately to customize the look of the Neeon 2&#x27;s frontplate, though they cannot be interchanged. The players and their &quot;Stik-Ons&quot; are only available in Australia, Singapore and several other Asian countries.

=== ZEN Vision W ===

The ZEN Vision W was released on September 17, 2006. A variant of the ZEN Vision, the portable media player has a 4.3-inch, widescreen (16:9) TFT-LCD display. The player comes in black and is available with 30 or 60 GB capacity. Like the ZEN Vision:M, a built-in microphone and an FM tuner are included, as well as support for the same media formats, a similar graphical interface and the ability to sync organizer data from Microsoft Outlook. It also includes a CompactFlash reader for extra capacity and the direct upload of images.

=== ZEN Stone/Stone Plus ===
The ZEN Stone, released on May 3, 2007, is a small and screenless 1 or 2 GB player. Coated in glossy plastic, the player is available in black, white, blue, pink, green, and red. The ZEN Stone is compatible with the MP3, WMA, and Audible formats, is UMS compliant, and the battery lasts up to 11 hours.
Although it is slightly larger than the ZEN Stone, the ZEN Stone Plus is identical in design. However, the ZEN Stone Plus has a monochromic OLED screen, a built-in FM tuner, a stopwatch (the first ZEN player to have this ability) and a built-in microphone. The ZEN Stone Plus plays approximately 9.5 hours of continuous audio playback, and comes with the same colors as the ZEN Stone in a 2 GB capacity. A 4 GB model was subsequently released on June 29, 2007. A built-in speaker version was also released. Both versions support MP3 and WMA, with the built-in speaker version also supporting iTunes-encoded AAC and Audible formats.

A successor called the Zen Krystal was presented in 2008, featuring a pedometer.

=== ZEN Wav ===
The ZEN Wav was released on May 25, 2007. The flash-based player has built-in stereo speakers and supports the MP3, WMA, and WAV formats. It is the first player in the ZEN line to have the following features: a 16-bit color screen, unlike other ZEN players, which are 8-bit; a battery life of 30 hours (20 with the speakers), which was the longest compared to any previous ZEN player; the ability to read e-books; and the ability to show 3 different time zones &quot;at a glance&quot;. The ZEN Wav comes in capacities of 2 and 4 GB.

=== ZEN V/ZEN V Plus ===
Creative&#x27;s first flash-based portable media player was released on June 20, 2006. The scratch-resistant models have an OLED display with a resolution of 128×128. They come in white and black with orange trim for the 1 GB version, green trim for 2 GB, and black with blue trim for the 4 GB version and later an 8 GB version. The ZEN V Plus plays video and has an FM tuner, while the ZEN V does not. The players support the same formats as the Vision:M, while the videos will be trans coded upon transfer. There are also built-in microphones for voice recording, as well as wires for line-in recording. The rechargeable lithium-ion battery has a life span of up to 15 hours of continuous audio playback.

The ZEN V Plus won the CNET Editor&#x27;s Choice award during that month.

On September 29, 2006, Creative announced that the blue-and-black ZEN V Plus had been upgraded to 8 GB. Four days later, the company joined forces with the National Breast Cancer Foundation to release a pink version of the 2 GB model, available in most areas. In Europe and Japan, the 8 GB version is available in a red-and-black color.

On August 8, 2007, Creative released a 16 GB model of the ZEN V Plus, making it the highest capacity flash-based player until the ZEN beat its own record with the release of its 32 GB model.

=== ZEN ===
The replacement of the ZEN:VisionM, simply called &quot;ZEN&quot;, offered many of the same features but in a small pocket-sized form factor. This flash-based player was released on September 14, 2007, in capacities of 2, 4, 8, and 16 GB. A 32 GB model was announced on December 4, 2007, setting a record for storage capacity among flash-based players. The player is 0.44-inch thick, making it the slimmest ZEN player so far. It is the first ZEN to have an SD card slot, support for unprotected iTunes-encoded AAC, and a 24-bit color screen.

=== ZEN MX ===
The ZEN MX is a derivative of the ZEN, released in 2009. It shares the same form factor as the ZEN, but reduced processing power, cosmetic changes and changes in firmware resulted in a slightly stripped-down and sluggishly operating player, retailing as a lower price.

=== ZEN X-Fi ===

The ZEN X-Fi was officially confirmed on July 10, 2008. The player&#x27;s design is based on the ZEN and includes new features such as X-Fi technology, Wi-Fi, and online chat. The package includes a set of EP-830 headphones, and a built in speaker. It also supports wireless media streaming from a home network, similar to a Windows Media Center Extender. The player sold in capacities of 8 GB (without Wi-Fi), 16 GB, and 32 GB.

=== ZEN Mozaic ===
The ZEN Mozaic is a flash player that was released on August 3, 2008, in capacities of 2, 4, 8, and 16 GB. The Mozaic features a 1.8-inch video screen, a keypad that resembles a mosaic pattern, and a built-in speaker (also in a mosaic pattern). It also includes features such as a built-in FM radio, voice recorder, and picture viewer. The ZEN Mozaic has two derivatives, the ZEN Mozaic LX and the ZEN Mozaic EZ300. The ZEN Mozaic LX is a more affordable model which lacks an FM Radio and built-in speakers. The ZEN Mozaic EZ300 is nearly identical in terms of function to the original Mozaic, but supports plug and play and only comes in solid colors (black, silver or pink). 

===ZEN X-Fi2===

The ZEN X-Fi2, announced September 2, 2009 is a feature update to the X-Fi. It includes many features of the X-Fi, including flash memory, X-Fi audio enhancements, and expandable memory. However, there are several notable differences between the two. The X-Fi2 features a full touchscreen user input mode, unlike the original&#x27;s keypad-esque input method. Also, the X-Fi2 no longer has wireless networking features, and trades the SD input for a microSD card slot. Added to the player is support for the lossless, open-source FLAC codec, A/V output to a TV, and offline RSS reader support. Compared to similarly featured models from competitors, it is lower priced as well. It comes in 8 GB, 16 GB, 32 GB and 64 GB variations. As with most other models, the Zen X-Fi2 charges via USB port, but can also be charged using a separately available wall adapter. An Application Development Kit based on the Lua programming language is offered for homebrew applications and games.

=== ZEN X-Fi Style ===

The release of the ZEN X-Fi Style series was announced on April 8, 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;ZEN Style 100/300 and X-Fi Style Release&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It was created as a more affordable version of the X-Fi2, with removed Wi-Fi capability and touchscreen. The X-Fi Style comes in capacities of 8, 16, and 32 GB. The player features a 2.4-inch display, video out, X-Fi technology, a built-in speaker, FM radio, alarm clock, calendar and voice recorder. The battery life is rated at 25 hours for music and 5 hours for video. However, the expansion slot is omitted.

=== ZEN Style 100/300 ===

The ZEN Style series was announced at the same time as the X-Fi Style on April 9, 2010. The series is available in 4, 8, and 16 GB capacities. Both the 100 and 300 models have the same portrait design similar to Creative&#x27;s ZEN Mozaic, as well as the same sized screen as the Mozaic, at 1.8-inches. The series features an alarm, calendar, voice recorder, and video and photo support. The Zen Style 300 also includes a built-in speaker and FM radio. The battery life is rated at 32 hours for music and 4 hours for video. Unfortunately, the Zen Style is not compatible with Napster-To-Go feature.

=== ZEN Touch 2 ===

The first ZEN with Android 2.1 on board. (Upgradeable to 2.2) Announced on November 2, 2010. Has a microSD card slot, Bluetooth, wifi, and is available in 8 GB with GPS, or 8 GB or 16 GB without GPS. The player comes bundled with the popular EP-630 in-ear earphones from Creative. A GPS version is also available in the 8 GB capacity.

A firmware to update the player to Android 2.2 was released by Creative on 26 April, 2011. With the update, the ZEN Touch 2 supported Flash and also Audible content for certain regions.

=== ZEN Style M100/M300 ===

The ZEN Style M300, announced on May 5, 2011, is a compact and lightweight Bluetooth MP3 player with a 1.4-inch screen and capacitive touch controls. Despite its small form size, the player has a full range of features including FM radio, photo and video playback, built-in microphone as well as a microSD slot to expand your music and photo library on the player. The player comes in 4 colors (Black, White, Yellow and Red) and 3 capacities (4, 8 and 16 GB). A non-Bluetooth/FM radio version - the ZEN Style M100 is also available. Creative released an updated firmware (1.00.16) on the 11th of August 2011 which fixes some of the freezing and Bluetooth issues the player had when it was launched with its initial firmware.

=== ZEN X-Fi3 ===

The ZEN X-Fi3 is Creative&#x27;s 3rd MP3 player to feature its proprietary X-Fi audio technology. It includes X-Fi Crystallizer. Primary function of the Crystallizer is to &quot;restore portions of the sound which were lost during compression&quot;. The available storage (8 GB or 16 GB) could be expanded thanks to the microSD card slot. The player was introduced at IFA 2011.

The &quot;compression&quot; that is meant here is not the digital file-size reduction achieved by digital audio data compression technologies like for example mp3. Rather, the idea is to reverse the effects of dynamic range compression. X-Fi Expand allows you to experience surround sound effect on your earphones.

The ZEN X-Fi3 features a 2-inch non-touch TFT display with touch buttons. It supports Bluetooth 2.1 and apt-X codec. Other features of the player include FM radio, photo and video playback, on-the-go playlist creation, built-in speaker and microphone and microSD slot (integrated).

== Hardware ==
Most models are built with Texas Instruments&#x27;s TMS320DA25x ARM architecture and digital signal processor that makes up the CPU, while the operating system used is Texas Instruments DSP/BIOS. The peripheral circuits take care of all media decoding without any accelerator chips. The touchpads are managed by Synaptics controllers.

The newer ZEN players uses SigmaTel&#x27;s STMP3700 ARM, described to be &quot;designed specifically for portable devices&quot;. Nucleus RTOS makes up the base of their OSes.

== Marketing campaign ==

Creative Labs was known for its fierce rivalry against Apple, at one point &quot;declaring war&quot; with the iPod, but the Zen line never managed to gain a significant foothold against the iPod.

In November 2004, Creative Labs announced a $100 million marketing campaign to promote their digital audio products, including the ZEN range of MP3 players. In particular, the company was heavily publicizing the Zen Touch and ZEN Micro. These two products had been featured in an increasing number of television commercials, print ads, and urban billboards.

Many celebrities were seen with the ZEN Micro, including Paris Hilton, pop group Maroon 5 and Aerosmith&#x27;s Steven Tyler.

== Legal issues ==
Creative Labs, the American subsidiary of Creative Technology Limited, was awarded a patent on a music management interface (commonly seen on audio players, including the Apple iPod) by the US Patent and Trademark Office on 25 August 2005, having applied for it on 5 January 2001. Apple had filed for a similar patent on 22 October 2002 but that application was rejected. At the launch of the Vision:M, Creative announced that it would &quot;aggressively pursue&quot; respect of its patents, addressing &quot;all manufacturers that use the same navigation system.&quot; So far, Creative has only addressed Apple&#x27;s infringement of its patent. Creative announced on 15 May 2006, that it had launched a lawsuit against Apple for the infringement of the ZEN patent (Creative also asked the US Trade Commission to investigate whether Apple was breaching trade laws by importing iPods into the US), which was then counter-sued by Apple on the same day, filing two lawsuits for infringing their patents. Subsequently, Apple and Creative reached a settlement, with Apple paying $100 million to Creative, and Creative joining the &quot;Made for iPod&quot; accessory program.

==Sales and market share==
Sales of Creative&#x27;s MP3 players (which included the MuVo line along with the Zen) significantly decreased after about 2005, leading to a financial loss in 2006. This was due to tough competition in North America and Asia. However Creative continued so sell in high numbers in Europe. Continental Europe provided the most sales for Creative Labs.

As of Q2 2005, Creative (which included the MuVo line along with the Zen) held a 3.6% share in the American MP3 player market, placing it second behind Apple. A year later its share was 4.3%, but dropped to third behind SanDisk. In Q1 2007 its market share was about 4% before dropping to 2% in Q1 2008. In 2009 it dropped to 1%.

Its global market share in 2007 was 6%.

<text>Interim trustee is a term of art in section 701 of the Bankruptcy Code, Title 11 of the United States Code.

When a case under Chapter 7 of the Code is commenced, the United States Trustee immediately appoints an interim trustee for that case. The most important immediate duty of the interim trustee is to conduct the first meeting of creditors (sometimes called the &quot;341 meeting&quot;), at which the bankrupt person is required to appear and respond to questions under oath concerning the person&#x27;s assets and debts.

If the creditors do not elect some other person qualified to serve as trustee for the case, then the interim trustee becomes the &quot;permanent&quot; trustee. The permanent trustee serves as trustee for the duration of the case, but is subject to removal for good cause. In the overwhelming majority of bankruptcy cases, the interim trustee is not replaced, and serves for the entire case.

Chapter 7 trustees are selected by the U.S. Trustee from a &quot;panel&quot; of individuals residing or having offices in the judicial district where the bankruptcy case is filed. Federal law prohibits the U.S. Trustee from requiring the trustee to be licensed as an attorney. Because trustees must be knowledgeable about bankruptcy law and procedure in order to administer their cases, most panel trustees are, however, attorneys who handle their court responsibilities as a complement to their law practices.

The only other legal pre-requisite for the qualification of the interim trustee is the giving of a surety bond to secure compliance with the trustee&#x27;s responsibilities in the case. Generally, panel trustees will file a &quot;blanket bond&quot; with the U.S. Trustee&#x27;s office which covers all cases in which a particular trustee is serving.

<text>Daliah Lavi (born Daliah Lewinbuk or Levenbuch, ; 12 October 1942 – 3 May 2017) was an Israeli actress, singer, and model.

==Early life==
Daliah Lewinbuk (or Levenbuch) was born in Haifa, British Mandate of Palestine (now Israel). Her mother Ruth Klammer was born in Breslau, Germany (now Wrocław, Poland) to Theodor Hermann Klammer and Gertrud Klammer and was of German-Jewish descent. Her father Reuben was born in Belarus to Yosef Lewinbuk and Michla Levine of Russian-Jewish descent. The family surname is Lewinbuk (or Levenbuch). 

Daliah met Kirk Douglas when she was 10 years old. Kirk Douglas was in Israel in order to film &quot;The Juggler&quot;. Daliah told him that she would like to be a dancer. Douglas helped persuade her parents to send her to Stockholm, Sweden to study ballet. Daliah was not suited to the climate. Daliah gave up dancing, and she returned to Israel in order to be a model. A cheesecake photo of Daliah Lavi, while she was adjusting her bikini after it broke while at a Rio de Janeiro swimming pool, was circulated widely by the Associated Press in 1959.

She performed her national service as a goodwill ambassador. Daliah appeared in several more films, Daliah was spotted on a beach during a trip to Rome. Daliah was offered a role in &quot;Two Weeks in Another Town&quot;, reuniting her with Douglas.

==Career==

Lavi appeared in her first film in 1955, &quot;&quot;, a Swedish adaptation of August Strindberg&#x27;s 1887 novel &quot;The People of Hemsö&quot;. She eventually returned to Israel. Her career took off in 1960, when she started appearing in a large number of European and American productions. Daliah was fluent in several languages. She acted in films in German, French, Italian, Spanish and English.
Lavi was reunited with Douglas in her first American film, Vincente Minnelli&#x27;s &quot;Two Weeks in Another Town&quot; (1962).
She appeared in Brunello Rondi&#x27;s witch hunt-themed movie &quot;Il demonio&quot; (1963), a film she considered her best performance. She also appeared in Mario Bava&#x27;s Gothic classic &quot;La Frusta e il corpo&quot; (1963), and the first Matt Helm film, &quot;The Silencers&quot; (1966), opposite Dean Martin. Her portrayal of The Girl, Peter O&#x27;Toole&#x27;s love interest, in 1965&#x27;s &quot;Lord Jim,&quot; was to have been her breakout American role. The tepid reaction of audiences to the film prompted Lavi to accept a new career path. She frequently played a scantily clad femme fatale.

Lavi played European entertainer Ilona Bergen in the 1965 mystery film &quot;Ten Little Indians&quot;. The movie is a film adaptation of Agatha Christie&#x27;s thriller. The plot is about a group of strangers with deadly secrets, who are lured to an isolated locale, and murdered one by one. She also acted as &quot;The Detainer/007&quot; in &quot;Casino Royale&quot; (1967).

In 1970 she was discovered by record producer Jimmy Bowien and began a successful schlager singing career in Germany. Some of her hits were: &quot;Oh, wann kommst du?&quot;, &quot;Willst du mit mir gehn?&quot;, and &quot;C&#x27;est ça, la vie (So ist das Leben)&quot;.

Daliah&#x27;s single, &quot;Jerusalem&quot;, peaked at number 98 in Australia, in August 1971.

==Death==
Lavi died on 3 May 2017, aged 74, from undisclosed causes in Asheville, North Carolina, US. Her funeral and burial were in Israel.

<doc id="1327248" wikidata="Q4856460" url="?curid=1327248" title="Bankruptcy in the United States">
<text>In the United States, bankruptcy is largely governed by federal law, commonly referred to as the &quot;Bankruptcy Code&quot; (&quot;Code&quot;). The United States Constitution (Article 1, Section 8, Clause 4) authorizes Congress to enact &quot;uniform Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies throughout the United States&quot;. Congress has exercised this authority several times since 1801, including through adoption of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, as amended, codified in Title 11 of the United States Code and the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (BAPCPA).

Some laws relevant to bankruptcy are found in other parts of the United States Code. For example, bankruptcy crimes are found in Title 18 of the United States Code (Crimes). Tax implications of bankruptcy are found in Title 26 of the United States Code (Internal Revenue Code), and the creation and jurisdiction of bankruptcy courts are found in Title 28 of the United States Code (Judiciary and Judicial procedure).

Bankruptcy cases are filed in United States bankruptcy court (units of the United States District Courts), and federal law governs procedure in bankruptcy cases. However, state laws are often applied to determine how bankruptcy affects the property rights of debtors. For example, laws governing the validity of liens or rules protecting certain property from creditors (known as exemptions), may derive from state law or federal law. Because state law plays a major role in many bankruptcy cases, it is often unwise to generalize some bankruptcy issues across state lines.

==History==

Originally, bankruptcy in the United States, as nearly all matters directly concerning individual citizens, was a subject of state law. However, there were several short-lived federal bankruptcy laws before the Act of 1898: the Bankruptcy Act of 1800, which was repealed in 1803; the Act of 1841, which was repealed in 1843; and the Act of 1867, which was amended in 1874 and repealed in 1878.

The first more lasting federal bankruptcy law, sometimes called the &quot;Nelson Act&quot;, initially entered into force in 1898. The current Bankruptcy Code was enacted in 1978 by § 101 of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, and generally became effective on October 1, 1979; it completely replaced the former bankruptcy law, the &quot;Chandler Act&quot; of 1938, which had given unprecedented power to the Securities and Exchange Commission for the regulation of bankruptcy filings.

The current code has been amended numerous times since 1978. See also the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005.

==Chapters of the Bankruptcy Code==
Entities seeking relief under the Bankruptcy Code may file a petition for relief under a number of different chapters of the Code, depending on circumstances. Title 11 contains nine chapters, six of which provide for the filing of a petition. The other three chapters provide rules governing bankruptcy cases in general. A case is typically referred to by the chapter under which the petition is filed. These chapters are described below.

===Chapter 7: Liquidation===

Liquidation under a Chapter 7 filing is the most common form of bankruptcy. Liquidation involves the appointment of a trustee who collects the non-exempt property of the debtor, sells it and distributes the proceeds to the creditors. Because all states allow for debtors to keep essential property, Chapter 7 cases are often &quot;no asset&quot; cases, meaning that the bankrupt estate has no non-exempt assets to fund a distribution to creditors.

Chapter 7 bankruptcy remains on a bankruptcy filer&#x27;s credit report for 10 years.

United States bankruptcy law significantly changed in 2005 with the passage of Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act (US) —- BAPCPA, which made it more difficult for consumer debtors to file bankruptcy in general and Chapter 7 in particular.

Advocates of BAPCPA claimed that its passage would reduce losses to creditors such as credit card companies, and that those creditors would then pass on the savings to other borrowers in the form of lower interest rates. Critics assert that these claims turned out to be false, observing that although credit card company losses decreased after passage of the Act, prices charged to customers increased, and credit card company profits increased.

===Chapter 9: Reorganization for municipalities===

A Chapter 9 bankruptcy is available only to municipalities. Chapter 9 is a form of reorganization, not liquidation. Notable examples of municipal bankruptcies include that of Orange County, California (1994 to 1996) and the bankruptcy of the city of Detroit, Michigan in 2013.

===Chapters 11, 12, and 13: Reorganization===
Bankruptcy under Chapter 11, Chapter 12, or Chapter 13 is a more complex reorganization and involves allowing the debtor to keep some or all of his or her property and to use future earnings to pay off creditors. Consumers usually file chapter 7 or chapter 13. Chapter 11 filings by individuals are allowed, but are rare. Chapter 12 is similar to Chapter 13 but is available only to &quot;family farmers&quot; and &quot;family fisherman&quot; in certain situations. Chapter 12 generally has more generous terms for debtors than a comparable Chapter 13 case would have available. As recently as mid-2004 Chapter 12 was scheduled to expire, but in late 2004 it was renewed and made permanent.

===Chapter 15: Cross-border insolvency===

The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 added Chapter 15 (as a replacement for section 304) and deals with cross-border insolvency: foreign companies with US debts.

==Features of U.S. bankruptcy law==

===Voluntary versus involuntary bankruptcy===
As a threshold matter, bankruptcy cases are either voluntary or involuntary. In voluntary bankruptcy cases, which account for the overwhelming majority of cases, debtors petition the bankruptcy court. With involuntary bankruptcy, creditors, rather than the debtor, file the petition in bankruptcy. Involuntary petitions are rare, however, and are occasionally used in business settings to force a company into bankruptcy so that creditors can enforce their rights.

===The estate===
Except in Chapter 9 cases, commencement of a bankruptcy case creates an &quot;estate&quot;. Generally, the debtor&#x27;s creditors must look to the assets of the estate for satisfaction of their claims. The estate consists of all property interests of the debtor at the time of case commencement, subject to certain exclusions and exemptions. In the case of a married person in a community property state, the estate may include certain community property interests of the debtor&#x27;s spouse even if the spouse has not filed bankruptcy. The estate may also include other items, including but not limited to property acquired by will or inheritance within 180 days after case commencement.

For federal income tax purposes, the bankruptcy estate of an individual in a Chapter 7 or 11 case is a separate taxable entity from the debtor. The bankruptcy estate of a corporation, partnership, or other collective entity, or the estate of an individual in Chapters 12 or 13, is not a separate taxable entity from the debtor.

===Bankruptcy court===

In 1982, in the case of &quot;Northern Pipeline Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co.&quot;, the United States Supreme Court held that certain provisions of the law relating to Article I bankruptcy judges (who are not life-tenured &quot;Article III&quot; judges) are unconstitutional. Congress responded in 1984 with changes to remedy the constitutional defects. Under the revised law, bankruptcy judges in each judicial district constitute a &quot;unit&quot; of the applicable United States District Court. Each judge is appointed for a term of 14 years by the United States Court of Appeals for the circuit in which the applicable district is located.

The United States District Courts have subject-matter jurisdiction over bankruptcy matters. However, each such district court may, by order, &quot;refer&quot; bankruptcy matters to the Bankruptcy Court, and most district courts have a standing &quot;reference&quot; order to that effect, so that all bankruptcy cases are handled by the Bankruptcy Court. In unusual circumstances, a district court may &quot;withdraw the reference&quot; (i.e., taking a particular case or proceeding within the case away from the bankruptcy court) and decide the matter itself.

Decisions of the bankruptcy court are generally appealable to the district court, and then to the Court of Appeals. However, in a few jurisdictions a separate court called a Bankruptcy Appellate Panel (composed of bankruptcy judges) hears certain appeals from bankruptcy courts.

===United States Trustee===

The United States Attorney General appoints a separate United States Trustee for each of twenty-one geographical regions for a five-year term. Each Trustee is removable from office by and works under the general supervision of the Attorney General. The U.S. Trustees maintain regional offices that correspond with federal judicial districts and are administratively overseen by the Executive Office for United States Trustees in Washington, D.C. Each United States Trustee, an officer of the U.S. Department of Justice, is responsible for maintaining and supervising a panel of private trustees for chapter 7 bankruptcy cases. The Trustee has other duties including the administration of most bankruptcy cases and trustees. Under Section 307 of Title 11 of the U.S. Code, a U.S. Trustee &quot;may raise and may appear and be heard on any issue in any case or proceeding&quot; in bankruptcy except for filing a plan of reorganization in a chapter 11 case.

===The automatic stay===

Bankruptcy Code § 362 imposes the automatic stay at the moment a bankruptcy petition is filed. The automatic stay generally prohibits the commencement, enforcement or appeal of actions and judgments, judicial or administrative, against a debtor for the collection of a claim that arose prior to the filing of the bankruptcy petition. The automatic stay also prohibits collection actions and proceedings directed toward property of the bankruptcy estate itself.

In some courts, violations of the stay are treated as void &quot;ab initio&quot; as a matter of law, although the court may annul the stay to give effect to otherwise void acts. Other courts treat violations as voidable (not necessarily void &quot;ab initio&quot;). Any violation of the stay may give rise to damages being assessed against the violating party. Non-willful violations of the stay are often excused without penalty, but willful violators are liable for punitive damages and may also be found to be in contempt of court.

A secured creditor may be allowed to take the applicable collateral if the creditor first obtains permission from the court. Permission is requested by a creditor by filing a motion for relief from the automatic stay. The court must either grant the motion or provide adequate protection to the secured creditor that the value of their collateral will not decrease during the stay.

Without the bankruptcy protection of the automatic stay, creditors might race to the courthouse to improve their positions against a debtor. If the debtor&#x27;s business were facing a temporary crunch, but were nevertheless viable in the long term, it might not survive a &quot;run&quot; by creditors. A run could also result in waste and unfairness among similarly situated creditors.

Bankruptcy Code 362(d) gives four ways that a creditor can get the automatic stay removed.

===Avoidance actions===
Debtors, or the trustees that represent them, gain the ability to reject, or avoid actions taken with respect to the debtor&#x27;s property for a specified time prior to the filing of the bankruptcy. While the details of avoidance actions are nuanced, there are three general categories of avoidance actions:
* Preferences: 
* Federal fraudulent transfer: 
* Non-bankruptcy law creditor: 

All avoidance actions attempt to limit the risk of the legal system accelerating the financial demise of a financially unstable debtor who has not yet declared bankruptcy. The bankruptcy system generally endeavors to reward creditors who continue to extend financing to debtors and discourage creditors from accelerating their debt collection efforts. Avoidance actions are some of the most obvious of the mechanisms to encourage this goal.

Despite the apparent simplicity of these rules, a number of exceptions exist in the context of each category of avoidance action.

====Preferences====
Preference actions generally permit the trustee to avoid (that is, to void an otherwise legally binding transaction) certain transfers of the debtor&#x27;s property that benefit creditors where the transfers occur on or within 90 days of the date of filing of the bankruptcy petition. For example, if a debtor has a debt to a friendly creditor and a debt to an unfriendly creditor, and pays the friendly creditor, and then declares bankruptcy one week later, the trustee may be able to recover the money paid to the friendly creditor under 11 U.S.C. § 547. While this &quot;reach back&quot; period typically extends 90 days backwards from the date of the bankruptcy, the amount of time is longer in the case of &quot;insiders&quot;—typically one year. Insiders include family and close business contacts of the debtor.

====Fraudulent transfer====
Bankruptcy fraudulent transfer law is similar in practice to non-bankruptcy fraudulent transfer law. Some terms, however, are more generous in bankruptcy than they are otherwise. For instance, the statute of limitations within bankruptcy is two years as opposed to a shorter time frame in some non-bankruptcy contexts. Generally a fraudulent transfer action operates in much the same way as a preference avoidance. Fraudulent transfer actions, however, sometimes require a showing of intent to shelter the property from a creditor.

Fraudulent transfer may involve an actual or a &quot;constructive&quot; fraud. Actual fraud is based upon the intent of the transfer, whereas constructive fraud may be inferred based upon economic factors. Factors that may lead to an inference of fraud include whether the transfer was for reasonably equivalent value and whether the debtor was insolvent at the time of the transfer.

The conversion of nonexempt assets into exempt assets on the eve of bankruptcy is not an indicia of fraud per se. However, depending on the amount of the exemption and the circumstances surrounding the conversion, a court may find the conversion to be a fraudulent transfer. This is especially true when the conversion amounts to nothing more than a temporary arrangement. When finding the conversion of nonexempt into exempt assets to be a fraudulent transfer, courts tend to focus on the existence of an independent reason for the conversion. For example, if a debtor purchased a residence protected by a homestead exemption with the intent to reside in such residence that would be an allowable conversion into nonexempt property. But where the debtor purchased the residence with all of their available funds, leaving no money to live off, that presumed that the conversion was temporary, indicating a fraudulent transfer. Courts look at the timing of the transfer as the most important factor.

====Non-bankruptcy law creditor – &quot;strong arm&quot;====
The &quot;strong arm&quot; avoidance power stems from 11 U.S.C. § 544 and permits the trustee to exercise the rights that a debtor in the same situation would have under the relevant state law. Specifically, § 544(a) grants the trustee the rights of avoidance of (1) a judicial lien creditor, (2) an unsatisfied lien creditor, and (3) a bona fide purchaser of real property. In practice these avoidance powers often overlap with preference and fraudulent transfer avoidance powers.

===The creditors===
Secured creditors whose security interests survive the commencement of the case may look to the property that is the subject of their security interests, after obtaining permission from the court (in the form of relief from the automatic stay). Security interests, created by what are called secured transactions, are liens on the property of a debtor.

Unsecured creditors are generally divided into two classes: unsecured priority creditors and general unsecured creditors. Unsecured priority creditors are further subdivided into classes as described in the law. In some cases the assets of the estate are insufficient to pay all priority unsecured creditors in full; in such cases the general unsecured creditors receive nothing.

Because of the priority and rank ordering feature of bankruptcy law, debtors sometimes collude with others (who may be related to the debtor) to prefer them, by for example granting them a security interest in otherwise unpledged assets. For this reason, the bankruptcy trustee is permitted to reverse certain transactions of the debtor within a period of time prior to the date of the bankruptcy filing. The time period varies depending on the relationship of the parties to the debtor and the nature of the transaction.

In Chapters 7, 12, and 13, creditors must file a &quot;proof of claim&quot; to be paid. In a Chapter 11 case, a creditor is not required to file a proof of claim (that is, a proof of claim is &quot;deemed filed&quot;) if the creditor&#x27;s claim is listed on the debtor&#x27;s bankruptcy schedules, unless the claim is scheduled as &quot;disputed, contingent, or unliquidated&quot;. If the creditor&#x27;s claim is not listed on the schedules in a Chapter 11 case, the creditor must file a proof of claim.

=== Absolute priority ===
A distinctive feature of U.S. bankruptcy law is the absolute priority rule, codified at 11 U.S.C. § 1129(b)(2)(B)(ii). The rule provides that &quot;[w]ith respect to a class of unsecured claims . . . the holder of any claim or interest that is junior to the claims of such class will not receive or retain under the plan on account of such junior claim or interest any property.&quot; This requirement means that if any class of creditors votes against a plan of reorganization, the bankruptcy court may not confirm the plan if any class of claims or interests junior to the dissenting class (e.g., subordinated creditors or shareholders) receives any distribution of the debtor&#x27;s estate pursuant to the plan. In practice, the rule requires that debtors satisfy the claims of senior creditors in full before distributing any estate property to junior creditors or shareholders under the plan, although senior creditors will often consent to a &quot;de minimis&quot; recovery for junior stakeholders in exchange for their support for the plan. The Supreme Court has recognized an exception to the absolute priority rule known as the &quot;new value&quot; exception that allows junior stakeholders to recover property under a plan over the objection of senior creditors if the junior stakeholders provide &quot;new value&quot; to the restructured enterprise (typically defined as an upfront monetary contribution to the reorganized debtor that is commensurate with the property received or retained under the plan). The basis for the new value exception is that the holder of a junior claim or interest under such circumstances does not &quot;receive or retain under the plan &quot;on account of such junior claim or interest&quot; any property&quot; but rather receives or retains property under the plan on account of the new value contribution. 11 U.S.C. § 1129(b)(2)(B)(ii) (emphasis added).

===Executory contracts===
The bankruptcy trustee may reject certain executory contracts and unexpired leases. For bankruptcy purposes, a contract is generally considered executory when both parties to the contract have not yet fully performed a material obligation of the contract.

If the Trustee (or debtor in possession, in many chapter 11 cases) rejects a contract, the debtor&#x27;s bankruptcy estate is subject to ordinary breach of contract damages, but the damages amount is an obligation and is generally treated as an unsecured claim.

===Committees===
Under some chapters, notably chapters 7, 9 and 11, committees of various stakeholders are appointed by the bankruptcy court. In Chapter 11 and 9, these committees consist of entities that hold the seven largest claims of the kinds represented by the committee. Other committees may also be appointed by the court.

Committees have regular communications with the debtor and the debtor&#x27;s advisers and have access to a wide variety of documents as part of their functions and responsibilities.

===Exempt property===
Although in theory all property of the debtor that is not excluded from the estate under the Bankruptcy Code becomes property of the estate (i.e., is automatically transferred from the debtor to the estate) at the time of commencement of a case, an individual debtor (not a partnership, corporation, etc.) may claim certain items of property as &quot;exempt&quot; and thereby keep those items (subject, however, to any valid liens or other encumbrances). An individual debtor may choose between a federal list of exemptions and a list of exemptions provided by the law of the state in which the debtor files the bankruptcy case unless the state in which the debtor files the bankruptcy case has enacted legislation prohibiting the debtor from choosing the exemptions on the federal list, which almost 40 states have done. In states where the debtor is allowed to choose between the federal and state exemptions, the debtor has the opportunity to choose the exemptions that most fully benefit him or her and, in many cases, may convert at least some of his or her property from non-exempt form (e.g., cash) to exempt form (e.g., increased equity in a home created by using the cash to pay down a mortgage) prior to filing the bankruptcy case.

The exemption laws vary greatly from state to state. In some states, exempt property includes equity in a home or car, tools of the trade, and some personal effects. In other states an asset class such as tools of trade will not be exempt by virtue of its class except to the extent it is claimed under a more general exemption for personal property.

One major purpose of bankruptcy is to ensure orderly and reasonable management of debt. Thus, exemptions for personal effects are thought to prevent punitive seizures of items of little or no economic value (personal effects, personal care items, ordinary clothing), since this does not promote any desirable economic result. Similarly, tools of the trade may, depending on the available exemptions, be a permitted exemption as their continued possession allows the insolvent debtor to move forward into productive work as soon as possible.

The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 placed pension plans not subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), like 457 and 403(b) plans, in the same status as ERISA qualified plans with respect to having exemption status akin to spendthrift trusts. SEP-IRAs and SIMPLEs still are outside federal protection and must rely on state law.

===Spendthrift trusts===
Most states have property laws that allow a trust agreement to contain a legally enforceable restriction on the transfer of a beneficial interest in the trust (sometimes known as an &quot;anti-alienation provision&quot;). The anti-alienation provision generally prevents creditors of a beneficiary from acquiring the beneficiary&#x27;s share of the trust. Such a trust is sometimes called a spendthrift trust. To prevent fraud, most states allow this protection only to the extent that the beneficiary did not transfer property to the trust. Also, such provisions do not protect cash or other property once it has been transferred from the trust to the beneficiary. Under the US Bankruptcy Code, an anti-alienation provision in a spendthrift trust is recognized. This means that the beneficiary&#x27;s share of the trust generally does not become property of the bankruptcy estate.

===Redemption===
In a Chapter 7 liquidation case, an individual debtor may redeem certain &quot;tangible personal property intended primarily for personal, family, or household use&quot; that is encumbered by a lien. To qualify, the property generally either (A) must be exempt under section 522 of the Bankruptcy Code, or (B) must have been abandoned by the trustee under section 554 of the Bankruptcy Code. To redeem the property, the debtor must pay the lienholder the full amount of the applicable allowed secured claim against the property.

===Debtor&#x27;s discharge===

Key concepts in bankruptcy include the debtor&#x27;s discharge and the related &quot;fresh start&quot;. Discharge is available in some but not all cases. For example, in a Chapter 7 case only an individual debtor (not a corporation, partnership, etc.) can receive a discharge.

The effect of a bankruptcy discharge is to eliminate only the debtor&#x27;s personal liability, not the &quot;in rem&quot; liability for a secured debt to the extent of the value of collateral. The term &quot;in rem&quot; essentially means &quot;with respect to the thing itself&quot; (i.e., the collateral). For example, if a debt in the amount of $100,000 is secured by property having a value of only $80,000, the $20,000 deficiency is treated, in bankruptcy, as an unsecured claim (even though it is part of a &quot;secured&quot; debt). The $80,000 portion of the debt is treated as a secured claim. Assuming a discharge is granted and none of the $20,000 deficiency is paid (e.g., due to insufficiency of funds), the $20,000 deficiency—the debtor&#x27;s personal liability—is discharged (assuming the debt is not non-dischargeable under another Bankruptcy Code provision). The $80,000 portion of the debt is the &quot;in rem&quot; liability, and it is not discharged by the court&#x27;s discharge order. This liability can presumably be satisfied by the creditor taking the asset itself. An essential concept is that when commentators say that a debt is &quot;dischargeable&quot;, they are referring only to the debtor&#x27;s personal liability on the debt. To the extent that a liability is covered by the value of collateral, the debt is not discharged.

This analysis assumes, however, that the collateral does not increase in value after commencement of the case. If the collateral increases in value and the debtor (rather than the estate) keeps the collateral (e.g., where the asset is exempt or is abandoned by the trustee back to the debtor), the amount of the creditor&#x27;s security interest may or may not increase. In situations where the debtor (rather than the creditor) is allowed to benefit from the increase in collateral value, the effect is called &quot;lien stripping&quot; or &quot;paring down&quot;. Lien stripping is allowed only in certain cases depending on the kind of collateral and the particular chapter of the Code under which the discharge is granted.

The discharge also does not eliminate certain rights of a creditor to setoff (or &quot;offset&quot;) certain mutual debts owed by the creditor to the debtor against certain claims of that creditor against the debtor, where both the debt owed by the creditor and the claim against the debtor arose prior to the commencement of the case.

Not every debt may be discharged under every chapter of the Code. Certain taxes owed to federal, state or local government, student loans, and child support obligations are not dischargeable. (Guaranteed student loans are potentially dischargeable, however, if the debtor prevails in a difficult-to-win adversary proceeding against the lender commenced by a complaint to determine dischargeability. Also, the debtor can petition the court for a financial hardship discharge, but the grant of such discharges is rare.)

The debtor&#x27;s liability on a secured debt, such as a mortgage or mechanic&#x27;s lien on a home, may be discharged. The effects of the mortgage or mechanic&#x27;s lien, however, cannot be discharged in most cases if the lien affixed prior to filing. Therefore, if the debtor wishes to retain the property, the debt must usually be paid as agreed. (See also lien avoidance, reaffirmation agreement) (Note: there may be additional flexibility available in Chapter 13 for debtors dealing with oversecured collateral such as a financed auto, so long as the oversecured property is not the debtor&#x27;s primary residence.)

Any debt tainted by one of a variety of wrongful acts recognized by the Bankruptcy Code, including defalcation, or consumer purchases or cash advances above a certain amount incurred a short time before filing, cannot be discharged. However, certain kinds of debt, such as debts incurred by way of fraud, may be dischargeable through the Chapter 13 &quot;super discharge&quot;. All in all, as of 2005, there are 19 general categories of debt that cannot be discharged in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, and fewer debts that cannot be discharged under Chapter 13.

=== Valuation and recapitalization ===
In a corporate or business bankruptcy, an indebted company that files bankruptcy is typically recapitalized so that it emerges from bankruptcy with more equity and less debt. During this process, many debts may be &quot;discharged&quot;, meaning that the company will no longer be legally obligated to pay them. Which debts are discharged, and how equity and other entitlements are distributed to various groups of investors, typically turns on valuation issues. Bankruptcy valuation is often highly contentious because it is both subjective and important to case outcomes. The methods of valuation used in bankruptcy have changed over time, generally tracking methods used in investment banking, Delaware corporate law, and corporate and academic finance, but with a significant time lag.

===Entities that cannot be debtors===
The section of the Bankruptcy code that governs which entities are permitted to file a bankruptcy petition is . Banks and other deposit institutions, insurance companies, railroads, and certain other financial institutions and entities regulated by the federal and state governments, and Private and Personal Trusts, except Statutory Business Trusts, as permitted by some States, cannot be a debtor under the Bankruptcy Code. Instead, special state and federal laws govern the liquidation or reorganization of these companies. In the U.S. context at least, it is incorrect to refer to a bank or insurer as being &quot;bankrupt&quot;. The terms &quot;insolvent&quot;, &quot;in liquidation&quot;, or &quot;in receivership&quot; would be appropriate under some circumstances.

===Status of certain defined benefit pension plan liabilities in bankruptcy===
The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), a U.S. government corporation that insures certain defined benefit pension plan obligations, may assert liens in bankruptcy under either of two separate statutory provisions. The first is found in the Internal Revenue Code, at , which provides that liens held by the PBGC have the status of a tax lien. Under this provision, the unpaid mandatory pension contributions must exceed one million dollars for the lien to arise.

The second statute is , under which a PBGC lien has the status of a tax lien in bankruptcy. Under this provision, the lien may not exceed 30% of the net worth of all persons liable under a separate provision, .

In bankruptcy, PBGC liens (like Federal tax liens) generally are not valid against certain competing liens that were perfected before a notice of the PBGC lien was filed.

==Bankruptcy costs==

In 2013, 91 percent of U.S. individuals filing bankruptcy hire an attorney to file their Chapter 7 petition. The typical cost of an attorney was $1,170. Alternatives to filing with an attorney are: filing pro se, meaning without an attorney, which requires an individual to fill out least sixteen separate forms, hiring a petition preparer, or using online software to generate the petition.

The U.S. Bankruptcy Court also charges fees. The amounts of these fees vary depending on the Chapter of bankruptcy being filed. As of 2016, the filing fee is $335 for Chapter 7 and $310 for Chapter 13. It is possible to apply for an installment payment plan in cases of financial hardship. Additional fees are charged for adding creditors after filing ($31), converting the case from one chapter to another ($10-$45), and reopening the case ($245 for Chapter 7 and $235 in Chapter 13).

==Bankruptcy crimes==
In the United States, criminal provisions relating to bankruptcy fraud and other bankruptcy crimes are found in sections 151 through 158 of Title 18 of the United States Code.

Bankruptcy fraud includes filing a bankruptcy petition or any other document in a bankruptcy case for the purpose of attempting to execute or conceal a scheme or artifice to defraud. Bankruptcy fraud also includes making a false or fraudulent representation, claim or promise in connection with a bankruptcy case, either before or after the commencement of the case, for the purpose of attempting to execute or conceal a scheme or artifice to defraud. Bankruptcy fraud is punishable by a fine, or by up to five years in prison, or both.

Knowingly and fraudulently concealing property of the estate from a custodian, trustee, marshal, or other court officer is a separate offense, and may also be punishable by a fine, or by up to five years in prison, or both. The same penalty may be imposed for knowingly and fraudulently concealing, destroying, mutilating, falsifying, or making a false entry in any books, documents, records, papers, or other recorded information relating to the property or financial affairs of the debtor after a case has been filed.

Certain offenses regarding fraud in connection with a bankruptcy case may also be classified as &quot;racketeering activity&quot; for purposes of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). Any person who receives income directly or indirectly derived from a &quot;pattern&quot; of such racketeering activity (generally, two or more offensive acts within a ten-year period) and who uses or invests any part of that income in the acquisition, establishment, or operation of any enterprise engaged in (or affecting) interstate or foreign commerce may be punished by up to twenty years in prison.

Bankruptcy crimes are prosecuted by the United States Attorney, typically after a reference from the United States Trustee, the case trustee, or a bankruptcy judge.

Bankruptcy fraud can also sometimes lead to criminal prosecution in state courts, under the charge of theft of the goods or services obtained by the debtor for which payment, in whole or in part, was evaded by the fraudulent bankruptcy filing.

==Bankruptcy and federalism==
On January 23, 2006, the Supreme Court, in &quot;Central Virginia Community College v. Katz&quot;, declined to apply state sovereign immunity from &quot;Seminole Tribe v. Florida&quot;, to defeat a trustee&#x27;s action under to recover preferential transfers made by a debtor to a state agency. The Court ruled that Article I, section 8, clause 4 of the U.S. Constitution (empowering Congress to establish uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcy) abrogates the state&#x27;s sovereign immunity in suits to recover preferential payments.

==Social and economic factors==
In 2008, there were 1,117,771 bankruptcy filings in the United States courts. Of those, 744,424 were chapter 7 bankruptcies, while 362,762 were chapter 13. Apart from social and economic factors such as education and income, there is often also a correlation between race and bankruptcy outcome. For example, for personal bankruptcy claims, minority debtors had an approximately 40% decreased chance of receiving a discharge in Chapter 13 bankruptcy. These racial disparities are aggravated by the fact that many minority debtors lack appropriate attorney representation.

===Personal bankruptcy===
Personal bankruptcies may be caused by a number of factors. In 2008, over 96% of all bankruptcy filings were non-business filings, and of those, approximately two-thirds were chapter 7 cases.

Although the individual causes of bankruptcy are complex and multifaceted, the majority of personal bankruptcies involve substantial medical bills.
Personal bankruptcies are typically filed under Chapter 7 or Chapter 13. Personal Chapter 11 bankruptcies are relatively rare.
The American Journal of Medicine says over 3 out of 5 personal bankruptcies are due to medical debt.

There were 175,146 individual bankruptcies filed in the United States during the first quarter of 2020. Some 66.5 percent were directly tied to medical issues. Critical illness insurance Association report June 2, 2020

===Corporate bankruptcy===
Corporate bankruptcy can arise as a result of two broad categories—business failure or financial distress. Business failure stems from flaws in the company&#x27;s business model that prohibit it from producing the necessary level of profit to justify its capital investment. Conversely, financial distress stems from flaws in the way the company is financed or its capital structure. Continued financial distress leads to either technical insolvency (assets outweigh liabilities, but the firm is unable to meet current obligations) or bankruptcy (liabilities outweigh assets, and the firm has a negative net worth). A company experiencing business failure can stave off bankruptcy as long as it has access to funding; conversely, a company that is experiencing financial failure will be pushed into bankruptcy regardless of the soundness of its business model. The actual causes of corporate bankruptcies are difficult to establish, due to the compounding effects of external (macroeconomic, industry) and internal (business or financial) factors. However, some studies have indicated that financial leverage and working capital mismanagement are likely two of the major causes of corporate failure and bankruptcy in the US.

==Largest bankruptcies==
The largest bankruptcy in U.S. history occurred on September 15, 2008, when Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. filed for Chapter 11 protection with more than $639 billion in assets.

==Alternatives to bankruptcy==

A Texas divisional merger is a process allowed by Texas law in which a company can create a separate company to take over liabilities, with the existing company operating normally. The new company, with a different name, can locate in a state such as North Carolina where bankruptcy laws are different, and then declare bankruptcy, paying less than the original company would have. The latest case of a Texas divisional merger was by company, Johnson &amp; Johnson. Recently, J&amp;J has been hit by thousands of lawsuits by women claiming that J&amp;J baby powder, containing talc, caused their ovarian cancer. While the company has held that their products do not cause ovarian cancer, they lost many cases and a lot of money. This is what led them to perform a Texas divisional merger. They split their company, putting all talc liabilities on the new company, and keeping all assets within the original. This halted all cases by women with ovarian cancer, and has been seen as controversial since it keeps women from receiving compensation from Johnson &amp; Johnson.

== Northcenter ==
The neighborhood known as Northcenter refers to a neighborhood in the North Side of Chicago, Illinois. The boundaries of Northcenter are Addison on the south, Montrose on the north, the Chicago River on the west and Ravenswood (1800 W) on the east.
Northcenter has grown since the 1870s when the area was only accessible by the Chicago River and Little Fort Road (now known as Lincoln Avenue). Northcenter is considered a vibrant neighborhood with an eclectic mix of retailers, restaurants, live music, live theater, and service-oriented businesses.

Northcenter&#x27;s history is deeply rooted in European cultural influences, from German, Polish, Czech, Romanian, Serbian, Greek, Croatian, French making the majority and that history can be seen in the architectural charm of the homes and buildings from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Also during this time, the Selig Polyscope Company produced some of America&#x27;s earliest motion pictures and was based in Chicago. Along Byron Street near Oakley Ave and Western Ave, historic production buildings of the company are still standing and being used as residences and retail businesses. The neighborhood continues to grow and become more culturally diverse.
The neighborhood includes bowling alleys, three city parks - including an indoor ice arena, a nearby library, a nearby movie theater complex, and Northcenter Town Square.

<doc id="1327269" wikidata="Q3322499" url="?curid=1327269" title="Montclare, Chicago">
<text>Montclare is one of 77 officially designated Chicago community areas, located on the Northwest Side of the City of Chicago, Illinois.

==History==
William Sayre bought the land that would become Montclare at a Jefferson Township land sale. The 1870s brought the railroad and a housing development. The developers named the area Montclare, after Montclair, New Jersey. In 1889, the area was annexed into Chicago with the rest of Jefferson Township. At the time of annexation, the rural, agricultural area had fourteen houses and 120 residents. In 1912, the Grand Avenue streetcar was extended to the area and Tudor houses were built in response. The area continued to be relatively undeveloped during this period.

During the latter half of the twentieth century, the area saw an increase in brick bungalows and residents attracted by the suburban character of the area.

==Geography==
The area is bordered by Harlem Avenue on the west, Belmont Avenue on the north and railroad tracks to both the south and east. These railroad tracks include those that service the area via the Milwaukee District/West Line at Mont Clare station and the former Dunning spur line that the Milwaukee Road used to serve the Chicago-Read Mental Health Center and several factories among the Brickyard. The Dunning spur was torn up by Canadian Pacific, the successor to the Milwaukee Road. Located at Chicago&#x27;s city limits, it borders the village of Elmwood Park to the west.

Consistent with the area&#x27;s history the majority of land use in the area is single family residential and transportation with acreage of 250 acres and 193 acres respectively. Other land uses include 63 acres of multi family residential, 55 acres of commercial development, 6 acres of mixed use development, 19 acres of industrial development, 29 acres of institutional development and 11 acres of open space.

It is often paired with the neighboring Galewood neighborhood in Austin.

==Demographics==
According to a 2016 analysis by the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning, there were 12,887 people and 4,429 households residing in the area. The racial makeup of the area was 31.60% White, 3.60% African American, 5.70% Asian, 0.80% from other races. Hispanics or Latinos of any race were 58.20% of the population. The age distribution is 27.30% under the age of 19, 22.60% from 20 to 34, 20.80% from 35 to 49, 18.20% from 50 to 64, and 11.80% who were 65 years of age or older. The media age was 35 years.

The median household income for the area was $41,593 as opposed to $47,831 for the city; 24.4% of Montclare residents earned less than $25,000, 33.4% of residents earned between $25,000 and $49,999, 14.8% earned between $50,000 and $74,999, 12.4% earned between $75,000 and $99,999, 11.1% earned between $100,000 and $149,999, 3.9% earned $150,000 or more. There were 6,381 residents in the labor force. 12% of workers were employed in manufacturing, 11.6% were employed in healthcare, 11% were employed in retail, 10.1% worked in administration, and 9% worked in hospitality and food services.

<text>The pageboy or page boy is a hairstyle named after what was believed to be the haircut of a late medieval page boy. It has straight hair hanging to below the ear, where it usually turns under. There is often a fringe (bangs) in the front. This style was popular in the mid-to-late 1970s and 1980s.

==In popular culture==
===For women===
In the early 1950s, the New York City hairdresser M. Lewis popularized this style. Singer Toni Tennille of the 1970s pop duet Captain &amp; Tennille wore one as her signature look along with 1976 Olympic champion and 1976 World champion figure skater Dorothy Hamill. In the Oscar-winning film &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot;, the villainous Nurse Ratched is known for her pageboy. In the &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; episode &quot;Gone&quot;, Buffy has her hair cut into a pageboy. In the 1960s TV cartoon &quot;Underdog&quot;, the show&#x27;s damsel in distress Sweet Polly Purebred (voiced by Norma MacMillan) has this hairstyle as her trademark look. Mia Wallace in &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; also sports a pageboy. AnnaSophia Robb as Violet Beauregarde and Missi Pyle as Violet&#x27;s mother Scarlett Beauregarde in Tim Burton&#x27;s film version of &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; both sport pageboys. In the 2003 TV series &quot;All Grown Up!&quot; (a spin-off of &quot;Rugrats&quot;), Angelica Pickles (voiced by Cheryl Chase) sports a pageboy. Velma Dinkley, of the various &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; animated series, has worn a short pageboy from her first appearance. Rei Ayanami from &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; wears a shaggy pageboy. At the end of the Japanese anime series &quot;Kill la Kill,&quot; Satsuki Kiryuin cuts her hair into a page style. In John Green&#x27;s novel &quot;The Fault in Our Stars&quot;, narrator and main character Hazel Grace Lancaster sports a pageboy haircut. The most prominent women to wear pageboys in the 1970s and 1980s were actress Joanna Lumley as the character Purdey in television&#x27;s &quot;The New Avengers&quot;, and Diana, Princess of Wales. In fact it was also known as the &quot;Purdey Cut&quot; and the &quot;Lady Di&quot; in the UK at the time.

===For men===

The pageboy was popular among men during the early Renaissance.

This haircut was also popular in the 1900s with young boys as it was first popularized by child actors, such as John Tansey and, later, Jackie Coogan. The pageboy look on boys is often referred to as the Dutch Boy look after the popular fictional character. The pageboy returned to male fashion in the 1960s for grown men with straight hair after getting popularized by British rock bands such as The Beatles and The Rolling Stones. This was copied by many of the U.S. garage rock/punk bands, including The Chocolate Watchband, ? and the Mysterians, The Monkees and the Count Five. Andy Warhol and several members of The Velvet Underground also sported the androgynous haircut. The early Ramones haircuts were elongated pageboys, also sported, though less long, by the male members of Blondie. In the 1980s, the haircut became a symbol of garage punk and UK beat music as seen on the album &quot;Rockabilly Psychosis and the Garage Disease&quot; and worn by bands with 1960s influences, such as The Barracudas and Primal Scream. Mansun lead guitarist, Dominic Chad, was known for sporting this haircut in the late nineties.

Although it is currently a hairstyle worn far more by women, many men have worn it, including characters such as Mowgli in Disney&#x27;s 1967 version of &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, Luke Skywalker in 1977&#x27;s Star Wars: A New Hope, He-Man in his 1980s incarnation, Anton Chigurh in &quot;No Country for Old Men&quot;, and the eponymous star of the American comic strip &quot;Prince Valiant&quot;. The latter instance inspired the pageboy&#x27;s sometime nickname of &quot;the Prince Valiant&quot; or &quot;Prince Valiant cut&quot;. The character of Willy Wonka as played by Johnny Depp in the film version of &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; wore this hairstyle.

David McCallum wore the hairstyle in the 1975 TV series &quot;The Invisible Man&quot; and child actor Adam Rich popularized it for children in the series &quot;Eight Is Enough&quot;, which ran from 1977 to 1981. Roughly during the run of this show, 1977–1981, hairstyles of similar length over the ears became almost universal for American boys and even young men.

English musician, Liam Gallagher during the later days of Oasis’s career in the 2000s, and later in the early 2010s, during his stint with Beady Eye sported this hairstyle.

The hairstyle is also displayed by the brothers Anthony and Phillip Bonfiglio, on the animated series &quot;F Is for Family&quot;.

<doc id="1327280" wikidata="Q3567449" url="?curid=1327280" title="West Town, Chicago">
<text>West Town, northwest of the Loop on Chicago&#x27;s West Side, is one of the city&#x27;s officially designated community areas. Much of this area was historically part of Polish Downtown, along Western Avenue, which was then the city&#x27;s western boundary. West Town was a collection of several distinct neighborhoods and the most populous community area until it was surpassed by Near West Side in the 1960s. The boundaries of the community area are the Chicago River to the east, the Union Pacific railroad tracks to the south, the former railroad tracks on Bloomingdale Avenue to the North, and an irregular western border to the west that includes the grand city park called Humboldt Park. Humboldt Park is also the name of the community area to West Town&#x27;s west, Logan Square is to the north, Near North Side to the east, and Near West Side to the south. The collection of neighborhoods in West Town along with the neighborhoods of Bucktown and the eastern portion of Logan Square have been referred to by some media as the &quot;Near Northwest Side&quot;.

==Neighborhoods==

===Pulaski Park===

Pulaski Park is a neighborhood directly west of Goose Island and east of Wicker Park. The generally accepted boundaries of Pulaski Park are Ashland (1600 W) to the west, the Chicago River and Elston Avenue to the east, the Bloomingdale Line on the north, and Chicago (800 N) on the south (although some people extend the southern border only to Division Street).

Pulaski Park derives its name from the historic park and fieldhouse that was designed by Jens Jensen between 1912 and 1914. 1,200 people were displaced, leading to the razing of a number of buildings while others were moved to nearby locations in the neighborhood. The park and fieldhouse were listed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 13, 1981. It became an official Chicago Landmark on July 29, 2003.

The neighborhood borders on Polonia Triangle which was considered to be the center of Chicago&#x27;s Polish Downtown, the city&#x27;s oldest and most prominent Polish settlement, functioning as the capital of American Polonia. Because of this, the headquarters of many major Polish organizations in the United States were found in Pulaski Park such as the Polish National Alliance, the Polish Daily News and the Polish Women&#x27;s Alliance. Pulaski Park is listed within &quot;Polonia Triangle&quot; as one of the 11 neighborhoods included in &quot;The Labor Trail&quot; which chronicles Chicago&#x27;s history of working class life and struggle. The neighborhood is also home to two of Chicago&#x27;s Polish Cathedrals: St. Stanislaus Kostka and Holy Trinity Polish Mission.

Pulaski Park was the area of West Town that served as Chicago Congressman Dan Rostenkowski&#x27;s base of operations. The family still owns the building opposite St. Stanislaus Kostka church at 1372 Evergreen from which he ran his operations. Although Pulaski Park has declined from its heyday days as part of the city&#x27;s Polish Downtown, the entire West Town area has undergone a renaissance as gentrification has transformed the area.

This area&#x27;s higher population density gave it a more working-class population than Wicker Park. As opposed to other areas of West Town, much of the original housing stock of Pulaski Park has not been torn down for new construction in recent years.

===Wicker Park===

Wicker Park is a Chicago neighborhood northwest of the Loop, south of Bucktown and west of Pulaski Park. Charles and Joel Wicker purchased of land along Milwaukee Avenue in 1870 and laid out a subdivision with a mix of lot sizes surrounding a park. The Great Chicago Fire of 1871 spurred the first wave of development, as homeless Chicagoans looked to build new houses.

Before the turn of the twentieth century, Germans and Scandinavians tended to live in the area&#x27;s north and northwestern sections. Wicker Park became the abode of Chicago&#x27;s wealthy Northern European immigrants. The district proved especially popular with merchants, who built large mansions along the neighborhood&#x27;s choicest streets—particularly on Hoyne and Pierce, just southwest of North &amp; Damen, known then as Robey. Hoyne was known as &quot;Beer Baron Row,&quot; as many of Chicago&#x27;s wealthiest brewers built mansions there.

With the end of the 19th century the area was subsumed into the surrounding Polish Downtown and the area adjacent to the park which gave the neighborhood its name became known as &quot;the Polish Gold Coast&quot;. In the 1890s and 1900s, immigration from Poland and the completion of the Metropolitan West Side Elevated Lines greatly boosted the population density of West Town, especially in areas east of Wicker Park. The area around Division, Milwaukee, and Ashland was once known as &#x27;Kostkaville&#x27;, and the intersection retains the moniker &quot;Polish Triangle&quot; to this day. The provisional government of Poland met in Wicker Park during World War I. The near Northwest Side is home to many of the most opulent churches in the Archdiocese of Chicago, built in the so-called &#x27;Polish Cathedral style&#x27;.

Polish immigration into the area accelerated during and after World War II when as many as 150,000 Poles are estimated to have arrived between 1939 and 1959 as Displaced Persons (DPs). Like the Ukrainians in neighboring Ukrainian Village, they clustered in established ethnic enclaves like this one that offered shops, restaurants, and banks where people spoke their language. Division Street was referred to as &quot;Polish Broadway&quot;. Poet John Guzlowski whose parents first came to the area as DPs commented on growing up in the area in the 1950s that &quot;it felt like everyone was a Pole&quot;, a place where the local store owners, priests, cops, trash men, teachers, librarians all either spoke Polish or had family that did.

Nelson Algren&#x27;s literary output lionized the Division Street strip in his books such as &quot;The Man With The Golden Arm&quot; and &quot;Never Come Morning&quot; focusing on the stories of junkies, gamblers, hookers, and drunks in the Polish ghetto. Writing about the area&#x27;s Polish American underclass against the background of prevalent anti-immigrant xenophobia was taken by Poles as blatant Anti-Polonism. and resulted in the book &quot;Never Come Morning&quot; being banned for decades from the Chicago Public Library system over the massive outcry by Chicago Polonia. Later controversies to commemorate Algren would bring these old wounds back to surface, most recently when Polonia Triangle was to be renamed to honor the deceased author.

Beginning in the 1960s, Wicker Park began to change radically. Completion of the Kennedy Expressway in 1960, whose construction had displaced many residents and torn holes in the sustaining network of Polish-American churches, settlement houses, and neighborhood groups. Additionally Puerto Ricans and other Latinos displaced by urban renewal in Old Town and Lincoln Park began moving in. In 1960 Latinos comprised less than 1 percent of West Town&#x27;s population, but by 1970 that number was up to 39 percent. Split from the Lincoln Park neighborhood only by the Kennedy Expressway in the late 1950s and 1960s, it contained the second-largest concentration of Puerto Ricans in Chicago. It was the original home to the largest Latino gang at the time, the Latin Kings. The Young Lords, a human rights movement, held sit-ins with L.A.D.O. at the Wicker Park Welfare Office and large nonviolent marches to city hall. Urban renewal projects were undertaken to combat &quot;urban blight&quot; in some parts of the neighborhood, but disinvestment continued at a rapid clip as downtown banks redlined West Town for much of the mid-20th century. Wicker Park was also promoted by the city&#x27;s urban renewal plans, as a good &quot;suburb within the city&quot; because of its easy access to downtown, via Milwaukee and the elevated train (via Damen and Division stations). Chicago and Wicker Park reached a nadir in the 1970s, a decade when the city overall lost 11% of its population. During the 1970s, hundreds of cases of insurance-motivated arson were reported in Wicker Park, near St. Elizabeth Hospital. Many small factories near the area (many in woodworking) also closed or moved away.

Efforts by community development groups like Northwest Community Organization (NCO) to stabilize the community through new affordable-housing construction in the 1980s coincided with the arrival of artists attracted by the neighborhood&#x27;s easy access to the Loop, cheap loft space in the abandoned factories, and distinctly urban feel.

In 1989, the &quot;Around the Coyote&quot; festival was launched to help the hundreds of working artists and micro-galleries in the neighborhood to gain a level of local and international prominence. This 501(c)3 non-profit was established with the mission to &quot;bring to the art community a professional organization that will help artists network and exhibit their art.&quot; For decades, the festival centered on the Flatiron Arts Building and was typically held during the month of October, Chicago&#x27;s Artist Month. &quot;Around the Coyote&quot; revised its preferred locations for the annual festival, which in 2008 was held coincidentally with Looptopia in May in Chicago&#x27;s Loop.
Today, the neighborhood is best known for its numerous commercial and entertainment establishments and being a convenient place to live for downtown workers due to its proximity to public transportation and the Loop. Gentrification has made the area much more attractive to college-educated white-collar workers, although it faced considerable resistance from the working-class Puerto Rican community it displaced. Crime has drastically decreased and many new homes have been built as well as older homes being restored. The area has become a desirable neighborhood and this has led to increased business activity, with many new bars, restaurants, and stores opening to serve individuals. The neighborhood is known for hosting local art stores and independent businesses. Property values have gone up, increasing the wealth of property owners and making the neighborhood attractive to real estate investors.

The borders of the neighborhood are generally accepted to be North Avenue to the north (at 1600 N) (but the official boundary is the Bloomingdale Trail train tracks just north of North), the Kennedy Expressway on the east north of North Avenue and the Chicago River south of North Avenue, Division to the south (at 1200 N), and Western Avenue to the west (2400 W). Both the East Village and Ukrainian Village are to the south, Humboldt Park is to the west, and Bucktown is to the north.

Notable past and current residents include Nelson Algren, who lived on the third floor at 1958 W. Evergreen Ave between 1959–1975, Liz Phair, who penned her first album Exile in Guyville in and about Wicker Park, Smashing Pumpkins guitarist James Iha, Pro Wrestler Colt Cabana who can be seen on WWE Smackdown as Scotty Goldman, and singer/guitarist Matt Skiba of The Alkaline Trio. Pro wrestler CM Punk of World Wrestling Entertainment currently resides in Wicker Park. Much of Wicker Park was designated as a Chicago Landmark District in 1991.

Wicker Park is the setting of a 2004 film by the same name. However, the filming of this movie was done on location in Montreal, Quebec. Another film of note that uses Wicker Park as its background is &quot;High Fidelity&quot; (2000) directed by Stephen Frears and starring Evanston-born John Cusack. Former independent record company Wax Trax! Records, a pioneer in releasing industrial music, had its offices in Wicker Park.

===Ukrainian Village===

Ukrainian Village is a Chicago neighborhood located west of Chicago&#x27;s downtown and south of Wicker Park. Its boundaries are Division Street to the north, Grand Avenue to the south, Western Avenue to the west, and Damen Avenue to the east.

Ukrainian Village, like neighboring East Village began as farmland. Originally German Americans formed the largest ethnic group in the vicinity; however, by the turn of the century the neighborhood was largely Slavic. Similarly to the &quot;Lithuanian Downtown&quot; in the Chicago neighborhood of Bridgeport, Ukrainians settled in the district because of their familiarity with Poles who lived in the surrounding Polish Downtown. Dense settlement of the neighborhood was largely spurred by the 1895 construction of the elevated Logan Square branch along Paulina Street that would close in 1951 and be demolished in 1964.

Over the past half century, it has remained a middle-class neighborhood, populated largely by older citizens of Eastern European ethnicity, bordered (and affected) on many sides by more dangerous areas. It was insulated somewhat from surrounding socioeconomic change in the large industrial areas on its south and west borders by the strong fabric of ethnic institutions as well as the staying power of the Orthodox and Ukrainian Catholic congregations. These local ethnic institutions include the Ukrainian Institute of Modern Art, the Ukrainian National Museum, and the Ukrainian Cultural Center. Although Ukrainian Village continues to be the center of Chicago&#x27;s large Ukrainian community, the gentrification of West Town is rapidly changing the demographic. Ukrainian Village continues to be home to approximately 10,000 ethnic Ukrainians.

Other notable local landmarks include Ss. Volodymyr and Olha Ukrainian Catholic Church, St. Nicholas Ukrainian Catholic Cathedral, St. Volodymyr Ukrainian Orthodox Cathedral, Roberto Clemente High School, St Mary&#x27;s Hospital, and Holy Trinity Russian Orthodox Cathedral, the latter having been commissioned by St. John Kochurov and designed by famed architect Louis Sullivan.

On December 4, 2002, the Ukrainian Village District, centering on Haddon Avenue, Thomas Street, and Cortez Street between Damen and Leavitt Avenues, including portions of Damen, Hoyne and Leavitt Avenues, was designated a Chicago Landmark District. Extensions to the district were designated in 2005 and on April 11, 2007.

Neighboring &quot;East Village&quot;, the area east of Ukrainian Village extending from Damen to Ashland, was originally known as &quot;East Ukrainian Village&quot;.

A few scenes from the popular Russian movie from the 1990s, &quot;Brother 2&quot;, were filmed in and around Ukrainian Village.

===East Village===

East Village or &quot;East Ukrainian Village&quot; is a neighborhood directly east of Ukrainian Village. The generally accepted boundaries of East Village are Ashland (1600 W) on the east, Damen (2000 W) on the west, Division (1200 N) on the north, and Chicago (800 N) on the south (although some people extend the southern border to Grand Ave). The East Village Association neighborhood group in 1984 identify the boundaries as Division Street to Chicago Avenue and Damen Avenue to Milwaukee Avenue (800 – 1600 W).

Although German-Americans were initially the largest ethnic group in the area, by 1890 Poles were the clear majority, organized around a dense network of Roman Catholic churches such as Holy Innocents and other institutions within the vicinity of Polish Downtown. These local fraternal and religious organizations helped new immigrants get their bearings. The first home of the Sisters of the Holy Family of Nazareth, a Catholic order founded by a Polish nun, was on West Division. While the convent moved to Des Plaines in 1908, Saint Mary of Nazareth Hospital which the sisters founded still remains.

East Village&#x27;s ethnic turnover coincided with a change in the scale of real estate development, with a host of large residential buildings constructed between Damen and Ashland to create densely packed blocks. East Village&#x27;s varied built environment juxtaposed ornamented Queen Anne two-flats alongside frame cottages, brick tenements, and greystone three-flats.

Polish immigration into the area accelerated during and after World War II when as many as 150,000 Poles are estimated to have arrived between 1939 and 1959 as Displaced Persons. Like the Ukrainians in neighboring Ukrainian Village, they clustered in established ethnic enclaves like this one that offered shops, restaurants, and banks where people spoke their language. Division Street was referred to as &quot;Polish Broadway&quot;, &quot;teeming with flophouses and gambling dens and polka clubs and workingman&#x27;s bars like the Gold Star and Phyllis&#x27; Musical Inn&quot;.

Nelson Algren&#x27;s literary output lionized the Division Street strip in his books such as &quot;The Man With The Golden Arm&quot; and &quot;Never Come Morning&quot; focusing on the stories of junkies, gamblers, hookers, and drunks in the Polish ghetto. Writing about the area&#x27;s Polish American underclass against the background of prevalent anti-immigrant xenophobia was taken by Poles as blatant Anti-Polonism. and resulted in the book &quot;Never Come Morning&quot; being banned for decades from the Chicago Public Library system over the massive outcry by Chicago Polonia. Later controversies to commemorate Algren would bring these old wounds back to surface, most recently when Polonia Triangle was to be renamed to honor the deceased author.

In the 1960s East Village began to change radically. One major reason was the completion of the Kennedy Expressway in 1960, whose construction had displaced many residents and torn holes in the sustaining network of Polish-American churches, settlement houses, and neighborhood groups. Additionally, Puerto Ricans and other Latinos displaced by urban renewal in Old Town and Lincoln Park began moving in. In 1960 Latinos comprised less than 1 percent of West Town&#x27;s population, but by 1970 that number was up to 39 percent.

Downtown banks redlined West Town for much of the mid-20th century. Real estate values plummeted as landlords neglected their buildings and speculators sat on vacant land and abandoned property. Small businesses along Chicago Avenues closed, and the arson rate in East Village was so high that in 1976 Mayor Richard J. Daley convened a task force to address the crisis. The Polish exodus out of the neighborhood followed the Kennedy Expressway into the suburbs. The Northwest Community Organization was founded in 1962 to stem white flight by promoting home ownership and integration between longtime Eastern European residents and the newcomers. The institutional infrastructure that held Ukrainian Village together during the 1970s and 1980s was lacking in East Village. Much of the Polish population had moved northwestward to Avondale and beyond, while the Latino community which had begun to organize around issues of affordable housing and other redevelopment strategies designed to stave off displacement increasingly came into conflict with the mostly white artists and other urban-pioneer types who by the early 1980s constituted a minor but significant presence.

Today this neighborhood has been largely gentrified. East Village&#x27;s historic proximity to the elevated train and higher population density gave it a more working-class population than Ukrainian Village, and much of the original housing stock has been torn down for new construction in recent years. Blocks bounded by Division Street and Chicago, Hermitage and Damen Avenues were designated a Chicago Landmark District in 2006 and to the National Register of Historic Places in 2009 to preserve its character with these development pressures.

===River West===

The small area within West Town east of the Kennedy Expressway and west of the North Branch of the Chicago River, between Division Street (1200N) and Grand Avenue (500N) is referred to as River West, complementing the River North area of the Near North Side. The small area is bisected by the elevated Union Pacific Railroad tracks. It contains several large loft buildings, most converted in the mid-1980s for residential use; several housing developments; St. John Cantius church; The Chicago Academy for the Arts located in St. John Cantius&#x27; former school; the Chicago Tribune&#x27;s Freedom Center printing facility; some nightclubs and restaurants, and a few blocks of historic residential areas.

In recent news, the 30-Acre Tribune Freedom Center in River West was selected by the Lightfoot Administration to be the location for the first Chicago Casino. The Bally&#x27;s Corporation is behind the new project dubbed Bally’s Chicago and aims to create a $1.7+ billion &quot;Flagship Destination&quot; to showcase &quot;The Best of Chicago&quot; according to their website. Initially, the development was going to house the casino building, a 500 room hotel tower, several residential/multi-use high rises, an entertainment center, exhibition spaces, museum venues, and other large scale public amenities. The plan also would also include improvements to public infrastructure throughout the area. While developers have since scaled back the initial scope, they still intend on providing the much needed infrastructure improvements such as a public river walk and green space, new arterial streets, underground parking structures and the reconstruction &amp; reconfiguration of the Chicago Avenue &amp; Halsted Street Viaduct.

===Noble Square===
Noble Square is directly east of East Village. The generally accepted boundaries of Noble Square are the Kennedy Expressway on the east, Ashland (1600 W) on the west, Division (1200 N) on the north, and Chicago (800 N) or Grand (500 N) on the south. The name apparently refers to Eckhart Park, a one-block square park at the northeast corner of Chicago and Noble (1400 W). Its identity may be disappearing: real estate agents have been including its northern half as an eastern section of Wicker Park, while the southern end of this neighborhood has been identified as West Town since around 2000. This neighborhood was listed as &quot;West Town&quot; in 19th-century census records. 

Erie Neighborhood House, a social service agency tracing its roots to the settlement house movement of the 19th century, has operated in the neighborhood since 1870, providing services ranging from early childhood education and after-school programming to ESL and citizenship classes for adults. Its historic location is near the intersection of Erie (632 N) and Noble (1400 W).

===East Humboldt Park===
The western portion of the West Town community area is commonly referred to as &quot;Humboldt Park&quot; or &quot;East Humboldt Park,&quot; even though it is not in the Community Area of that name. The 104-block area&#x27;s boundaries are Western Avenue to the east, Chicago Avenue to the south, North Avenue to the north, and Humboldt Park, the 208 acre park that gives the area its name, to the west. This area has recently become known as &quot;East Humboldt Park/West Town&quot; to indicate its distinction from the Humboldt Park Community Area to the west of the park itself. It is perhaps best known for Paseo Boricua, a half-mile stretch of Division Street between Western and California Avenues. This stretch of Division is bookended by two -tall steel Puerto Rican flags, and contains many Puerto Rican stores and restaurants. The community that resides here has made efforts, through community improvement work, to resist the forces of gentrification that have moved them further west from West Town, Wicker Park, and Ukrainian Village. However, as creatives, young professionals, and families are priced out of adjacent Wicker Park and Bucktown, Humboldt Park has increasingly become a target of gentrification, and was named the &quot;tenth-hottest&quot; neighborhood in the country by Redfin in 2014. Additional commercial areas are along North Avenue, which is home to a large number of vintage clothing and mid-century furniture boutiques, and Augusta Avenue, which has seen the opening of a number of destination restaurants. In June 2024, the part of the Humboldt Park neighborhood in Chicago known as Puerto Rico Town or Paseo Boricua officially changed its name to Barrio Borikén.

===Smith Park===
Smith Park, or &quot;The Patch&quot;, lies within Chicago&#x27;s West Town community. Its formal name comes from the city park on its south border. Bounded by Chicago Avenue (800N) on the north, Grand Avenue (550N) on the south, Western Avenue (2400W) on the east and Washtenaw Avenue (2700W) on the west; the majority of the neighborhood sits within Chicago&#x27;s 26th Ward, with a small portion a part of the 1st Ward.

Originally settled primarily by Italian immigrants of various old country locales who moved west from the &quot;Little Sicily&quot; area on Sedgwick Street, near where the Cabrini–Green housing projects were built, and from the Italian neighborhood along the Grand Avenue corridor, it is a very old community with many families that have lived in the neighborhood for over six generations.

In 1929, when a quarry that had been converted to a large city dump in the West Town neighborhood had been completely filled, the Bureau of Sanitation transferred part of the site to the Bureau of Parks and Recreation. The city named the area Smith Athletic Field for Joseph Higgins Smith, alderman of the surrounding 32nd ward from 1914 to 1933. In 1959, the city transferred Smith Park to the Chicago Park District, at which time an artillery piece was placed in the park. A WWII tank was moved to the southeast corner of the park in the early 1990s from its former home at Grand and Western Avenues. This is the landmark by which most Chicagoans recognize Smith Park. The Park District added a spraypool, swimming pool, and bathhouse in the late 1960s and in 1979 a large, modern fieldhouse was constructed. Nine years later, the Park District dedicated its gymnasium to Tom Positano, a high school student who had been active at the park and who posthumously received a Junior Citizenship Award.

<text>The Brisbane Cricket Ground, commonly known as the Gabba, is a major sports stadium in Brisbane, the capital of Queensland, Australia. The nickname Gabba derives from the suburb of Woolloongabba, in which it is located. Over the years, the Gabba has hosted athletics, Australian rules football, baseball, concerts, cricket, cycling, rugby league, rugby union, Association football and pony and greyhound racing. At present, it serves as the home ground for the Queensland Bulls in domestic cricket, the Brisbane Heat of the Big Bash League and Women&#x27;s Big Bash League, and the Brisbane Lions of the Australian Football League.

Between 1993 and 2005, the Gabba was redeveloped in six stages at a cost of A$128,000,000. The dimensions of the playing field are now (east-west) by (north-south), to accommodate the playing of Australian rules football at elite level. The seating capacity of the ground was 42,000 in 2010, which has been reduced in recent times due to new electronic scoreboards and corporate facilities. For international cricket matches, the capacity is reduced to 36,000 due to new scoreboards and the addition of a pool deck, as well as wider sight screens. For AFL matches the capacity is slightly larger at 37,478.

==History==
===Foundation===

The land on which the ground sits was set aside for use as a cricket ground in 1895 and the first match was held on the site on 19 December 1896, between Parliament and The Press. Prior to this, cricket was played at a ground in the area then known as Green Hills (beside Countess Street Petrie Terrace opposite the Victoria Barracks – now occupied by the Northern Busway), since at least the early 1860s.

Greyhound racing meetings were held during 1928 at the ground.

The Gabba shared first-class cricket matches with the Exhibition Ground until 1931. The first Sheffield Shield match at the Gabba was scheduled to be played between 31 January 1931 and 4 February 1931, but it was washed out without a ball being bowled. The first Test match at the Gabba was played between Australia and South Africa between 27 November and 3 December 1931.

In 1972, a greyhound track was installed at The Gabba with night meetings held weekly at the ground for 21 years.
===Expansion===
From February 1993, work commenced on turning The Gabba into an all-seater stadium. The last greyhound meeting was held at The Gabba on 5 February 1993, with work commencing shortly after to remove the greyhound track around the ground to accommodate the relocation of the Brisbane Bears from Carrara (on the Gold Coast) to The Gabba, renovating the Sir Gordon Chalk Building to house the Bears Social Club and change rooms, refurbishing the Clem Jones stand (named for the long-standing Mayor of Brisbane, Clem Jones), the construction of a new Western grandstand, and extending the playing surface to cater for Australian rules football.The work was largely completed by 11 April when the Bears hosted their first AFL game at the renovated venue against Melbourne in front of 12,821 spectators.

Subsequent further renovations at the ground commencing in 1995 saw the current two tier stands constructed in stages with the last stage completed in 2005 when the Brisbane Lions Social Club (formerly the Brisbane Bears Social Club) was demolished and replaced with a 24 bay grandstand spread over 3 levels of seating with the entire redevelopment costing $AU128 million. Also as part of the redevelopment, five light towers were installed to allow for night football and cricket matches to take place, a light tower at the school end was removed in the late 90s to make way for the expanded grandstands. In 2017, the two video screens at the ground were replaced with the new screen at the eastern end in June of that year, followed by the screen at the western end in time for the 2017-18 Ashes series. In mid-2020 the Gabba received a $35 million refurbishment of the stadium&#x27;s media and corporate facilities, as well as entrances and spectator amenities. The work was completed in October that year, shortly before the venue hosted the 2020 AFL Grand Final.

===2032 Summer Olympics and cancelled reconstruction===
In April 2021, Premier of Queensland Annastacia Palaszczuk announced plans for a $1 billion reconstruction of the Gabba to serve as the main stadium of the 2032 Summer Olympics if Brisbane were awarded the Games, with an intent to host the ceremonies and athletics. The stadium&#x27;s foundations would have been demolished and rebuilt with new grandstands, expanding it to a capacity of 50,000. A new pedestrian plaza would have also been constructed. The redevelopment would have necessitated the demolishment of heritage-listed East Brisbane State School, one of Brisbane&#x27;s oldest state primary schools; it was established in 1899 on the eastern-most end of the block of land that now includes the Gabba.

In February 2023, the state and federal government reached an agreement on the Gabba and Brisbane Live arena projects, totalling $7 billion; the cost of the Gabba project had increased to $2.7 billion, which would be paid entirely by the state. The Gabba project proved controversial due to its costs. In September 2021, Ted O&#x27;Brien—LNP of Queensland MP and newly appointed special envoy for Brisbane 2032—argued that the redevelopment was announced without consultation, explaining that &quot;the problem was we were selling a proposition to the International Olympic Committee about the &#x27;new norms&#x27;; no big, new, flashy, glossy investments&quot;, and that &quot;we had a lot of work to claw back with the IOC to make sure they didn&#x27;t think we were telling them one thing and planning to do something else.&quot;

Scrutiny grew after Victoria withdrew its hosting of the 2026 Commonwealth Games due to cost concerns. In August 2023, Matt Carroll of the Australian Olympic Committee told a senate committee that the IOC recommends against building infrastructure solely for the Olympics, and that cricket and the Brisbane Lions would remain the Gabba&#x27;s primary uses. In December 2023, Lord Mayor Adrian Schrinner withdrew his support for the Gabba project, stating that Brisbane 2032 had &quot;become more about overpriced stadiums rather than the promise of vital transport solutions.&quot; Queensland had announced plans for a 20,000-seat stadium at the Brisbane Showgrounds at a cost of $137 million, with the intent to use it as a temporary venue for the Gabba&#x27;s tenants during construction. Schrinner, who was not given advance notice of the Showgrounds project, stated that &quot;the state government&#x27;s ham-fisted and foolish attempt to extort Brisbane ratepayers for tens of millions of dollars for a new RNA stadium was the final straw.&quot;

The new Premier of Queensland Steven Miles (who took office unopposed after Palaszczuk retired from politics) announced that he would instate an infrastructure authority to oversee the development of Brisbane 2032&#x27;s venues, and that an independent review of its plans would be led by former Lord Mayor Graham Quirk and completed within the next 60 days. In January 2024, Miles stated that despite his previous support of the stadium plans as an assistant minister, he was concerned over the $2.7 billion cost of the stadium project, and that &quot;I repeatedly asked if there were any other options, and all the options that were brought back cost similar amounts for a worse outcome.&quot;

On 18 March 2024, as a result of the independent review, Miles announced that the Gabba project had been cancelled. It will still undergo a refurbishment ahead of the Games, but will no longer serve as the ceremonies and athletics venue. The review recommended the construction of a new 55,000-seat stadium in Victoria Park as a legacy project, but Miles stated that this proposal has been rejected due to its projected $3.4 billion cost. Instead, Miles announced that Lang Park (which is already scheduled to host rugby sevens and football) would serve as the ceremonies&#x27; venue instead, and Queensland Sport and Athletics Centre would host athletics. Both venues, as well as the Gabba, are still expected to be refurbished. Miles stated that he wanted Brisbane 2032 to be a &quot;low-cost Games&quot;, and that &quot;when Queenslanders are struggling with housing and other costs, I cannot justify to them spending $3.4 billion on a new stadium.&quot; The state government spent $6.4 million on project validation reports tied to the scrapped project, which Miles stated would be &quot;used to inform future works on the Gabba&quot;.

==Sports played at the ground==
===Cricket===


The Gabba is used from October to March for cricket and is home to the Queensland Cricket Association, the Queensland Cricketers Club, Brisbane Heat and the Queensland Bulls cricket teams. The venue usually hosts the first test match of the season each November, in addition to a number of international one-day matches usually held in January. The pitch is usually fast and bouncy.

The Gabba&#x27;s amenities were greatly improved in the 1980s from a very basic standard, especially in comparison with other Australian cricket grounds. Test cricket was first played at the ground in November 1931, when the first test of the series between Australia and South Africa was held there. In December 1960, Cricket&#x27;s first-ever tied test took place at the ground, when Richie Benaud&#x27;s Australian team tied with Frank Worrell&#x27;s West Indian side. Queensland clinched its first-ever Sheffield Shield title with victory over South Australia in the final at the ground in March 1995.

The Gabba was the first Australian venue to host an international Twenty20 cricket match.

In November 1968 Colin Milburn scored 243, including 181 in the two-hour afternoon session, in a Sheffield Shield match for Western Australia vs. Queensland.

As of June 2023, Australia&#x27;s Michael Clarke holds the record for the highest number of runs scored in one test innings at the Gabba with 259 not out, breaking the previous record set by Alastair Cook.

Australia has a formidable test match record at the ground. As of 2024, in the 66 test matches played there, Australia has won 42, drawn 13, tied 1 and lost 10. Their last loss came in January 2024 against West Indies in the 2nd test of the 2023–24 Frank Worrell trophy. In 2021, India became the first Asian team to win a Test match at the Gabba, after handing Australia their first loss at the Gabba in 29 matches, and 32 years.

England have a notoriously poor record at The Gabba, and have only won two test matches at the ground since the end of the Second World War. Many of their defeats have been heavy and only seven England players have scored centuries at the ground.

On 15 December 2016, Australia hosted Pakistan for the first day-night Test at the Gabba, and the first Australian day-night Test hosted outside the Adelaide Oval.

===Australian rules football===


Australian football has a long association with the ground. The Queensland Football League, a precursor to AFL Queensland played matches at the Gabba from 1905 to 1914, 1959 to 1971, and in the late 1970s and early 1980s. AFLQ matches resumed in 1993 as curtain-raiser events to AFL games, along with occasional AFLQ Grand Finals.

The first VFL/AFL game at The Gabba was held on June 28, 1981, with hosting in front of 20,351 spectators. Six years later, the Brisbane Bears were admitted into the VFL but would initially play their home games at Carrara Stadium on the Gold Coast. The Brisbane Bears experimented with playing four matches at the Gabba in Brisbane in 1991, before moving all home matches to the venue ahead of the 1993 season. The Gabba was then the official home ground for the Brisbane Bears from 1993 to 1996 and since 1997 has been the home of the Brisbane Lions after the Bears merged with Fitzroy. The record crowd for an Australian rules football match is 37,473 between the Brisbane Lions and Richmond in the 2019 second qualifying final.

Interstate games, including the 1961 national carnival have also been played there, as was a demonstration game during the 1982 Commonwealth Games. In 1991 the Gabba was host to Queensland&#x27;s only victory over a Victorian side. In 1998 the Gabba hosted an AFL State of Origin match between the Allies and Victoria. 

The Gold Coast Suns have hosted games at The Gabba in 2011 and in 2018 due to the unavailability of their home ground Carrara Stadium because of redevelopment and the 2018 Commonwealth Games respectively. In addition, Melbourne FC played an annual home game against Brisbane at The Gabba between 2001 and 2007.

During the 2020 AFL season, the Gabba hosted a greater number of home and away matches than usual, due to the temporary relocation of Victorian and other clubs as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The venue was also selected to host the 2020 AFL Grand Final, with the Melbourne Cricket Ground not capable of hosting any spectators at the match. The Gabba thus became the first stadium outside the state of Victoria to host a VFL/AFL Grand Final, which Richmond won against Geelong by 12.9 (81) to 7.8 (50) in front of 29,707 people – just under the venue&#x27;s temporary maximum capacity due to the pandemic. Since the MCG began hosting VFL/AFL Grand Finals (VFL until 1989, AFL afterwards), only four other venues had done so: Princes Park (1942, 1943 and 1945), the St Kilda Cricket Ground (1944), Waverley Park (1991), and Optus Stadium (2021).

===Soccer===
In the early 1900s, the Gabba hosted numerous matches between Australia and various touring nations. During the 1950s and 1960s the Gabba hosted soccer matches for English first division and Scottish clubs including Blackpool FC, Everton FC, Manchester United and Heart of Midlothian F.C. The Chinese and South African national teams also played at the ground. During the 2000 Summer Olympics, the Gabba hosted association football group games.

===Rugby league===
On 8 May 1909, the first match of rugby league was played in Brisbane at the Gabba. Norths played against Souths before a handful of spectators at the ground. Brisbane Rugby League games continued to be played occasionally at The Gabba until 1957.

The Gabba hosted its first rugby league Test match on 26 June 1909, when Australia defeated New Zealand Māori 16–13.

The Queensland Rugby league team hosted a match of the 1953 American All Stars tour of Australia and New Zealand at the Brisbane Cricket Ground.

The Kangaroos continued to play Tests at this venue until 1956, and a ground record crowd of 47,800 people saw Australia play Great Britain in 1954. From 1932 to 1957 the Gabba was also used to host interstate matches and International Rugby League Finals from 1909 – 1956.

Rugby League did not return to The Gabba until July 1, 2023, when the Brisbane Broncos moved three of their matches to the ground while their regular home ground Suncorp Stadium was unavailable due to the 2023 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup. The first NRLW game at the ground was played on July 27, 2023, when the Brisbane Broncos took on the Gold Coast Titans as a curtain raiser to the Men&#x27;s game between the Broncos vs the Sydney Roosters.

====Rugby league test matches====
The Gabba hosted 11 rugby league test matches between 1912 and 1956.
===Rugby union===
The Gabba has hosted six rugby union Test matches.
==2000 Olympic Games==
The Gabba hosted seven games of the 2000 Olympic Games Men&#x27;s Football tournament including a Quarter final match.

==Greyhound racing==
Greyhound racing was also conducted at the Gabba prior to the redevelopment. Meetings were held during 1928 and again from 1972 until 1993.

==Awards==
In 2009, as part of the Q150 celebrations, the Gabba was announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for its role as a &quot;structure and engineering feat&quot;.

<doc id="1327317" wikidata="Q5193673" url="?curid=1327317" title="Culture of the Isle of Man">
<text>The culture of the Isle of Man is influenced by its Celtic and, to a lesser extent, its Norse origins, though its close proximity to the United Kingdom, popularity as a UK tourist destination, and recent mass immigration by British migrant workers has meant that British influence has been dominant since the Revestment period. Recent revival campaigns have attempted to preserve the surviving vestiges of Manx culture after a long period of Anglicisation, and significant interest in the Manx language, history and musical tradition has been the result.

==Language==

The official language of the Isle of Man is English. Manx Gaelic has traditionally been spoken but is now considered &quot;critically endangered&quot;.

The Manx Gaelic language is a Goidelic Celtic language and is one of a number of insular Celtic languages spoken in the British Isles. Manx Gaelic has been officially recognised as a legitimate autochthonous regional language under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, ratified by the United Kingdom on 27 March 2001 on behalf of the Isle of Man government.

The Manx language is closely related to the Irish language and to Scottish Gaelic. By the middle of the 20th century only a few elderly native speakers remained: the last of them, Ned Maddrell, died on 27 December 1974. By then a scholarly revival had begun to spread to the populace, and many had learned Manx as a second language. The first native speakers of Manx (bilingual with English) in many years have now appeared: children brought up by Manx-speaking parents. Primary immersion education in Manx is provided by the Manx government: since 2003, the former St John&#x27;s School building has been used by the &quot;Bunscoill Ghaelgagh&quot; (a Manx language-medium primary school). Degrees in Manx are available from the Isle of Man College and the Centre for Manx Studies. Manx-language playgroups also exist and Manx language classes are available in island schools. In the 2001 census, 1,689 out of 76,315, or 2.2% of the population, claimed to have knowledge of Manx, although the degree of knowledge in these cases presumably varied.

In common use are the greetings and which mean &quot;good morning&quot; and &quot;good afternoon&quot; respectively. The Manx language uses &quot;afternoon&quot; in place of &quot;evening&quot;. Another frequently heard Manx expression is meaning &quot;time enough&quot;, which is supposed to represent a stereotypical &quot;mañana&quot; view of the Manx attitude to life.

Manx English, or Anglo-Manx, is the historical local dialect of English, but its use has decreased. It has many borrowings from the Manx language. Early strata of Anglo-Manx contain much of Gaelic and Norse origin, but more recent Anglo-Manx displays heavy influence from Liverpool and Lancashire in North West England. The best known recorder of the Anglo-Manx dialect was the poet, T.E. Brown.

In recent years, the Anglo-Manx dialect has almost disappeared in the face of increasing immigration and cultural influence from the United Kingdom. A few words remain in general use, but apart from the Manx accent, little remains of this dialect and it is seldom heard on the island in its original form today.

==Literature==

The earliest datable text in Manx, a poetic history of the Isle of Man from the introduction of Christianity, dates to the 16th century at the latest.

Christianity has been an overwhelming influence on Manx literature. Religious literature was common, but surviving secular writing much rarer. The Book of Common Prayer and Bible were translated into Manx in the 17th and 18th centuries. The first Manx Bible was printed between 1771 and 1775 and is the source and standard for modern Manx orthography. The first printed work in Manx, , dates from 1707: a translation of a Prayer Book catechism in English by Bishop Thomas Wilson.

With the revival of Manx, new literature has appeared, including , a Manx translation of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; by Brian Stowell, published in 1990.

==Arts==

Established in 1965, the Isle of Man Arts Council exists to promote the Island&#x27;s cultural identity and encourage enjoyment and participation in the arts. A sponsored body of the Department of Education, Sport and Culture, it offers grants, sponsorship and underwriting to a wide variety of individuals, schools, groups and venues across the community.

The Villa Marina is an entertainment venue in Douglas, Isle of Man, which forms part of the wider Villa-Gaiety complex. It is located on Harris Promenade, looking out onto Douglas Bay, and comprises the Royal Hall, Broadway Cinema, Promenade Suite, Dragon&#x27;s Castle and the Colonnade Gardens.

The Gaiety Theatre and Opera House is a theatre in Douglas, Isle of Man which together with the Villa Marina forms the Villa-Gaiety complex. The Gaiety is situated on Douglas promenade, overlooking the sea and adjacent to the Villa Gardens, Arcade and Butts.

==Symbols==

For centuries, the island&#x27;s symbol has been its ancient triskelion, a device similar to Sicily&#x27;s trinacria: three bent legs, each with a spur, joined at the thigh. The Manx triskelion does not appear to have an official design: government publications, currency, flags, the tourist authority and others all use different variants. Most, but not all, preserve rotational symmetry, some running clockwise, others anti-clockwise. Some have the uppermost thigh at 12:00 on the clock face, others at 11:30 or 10:00, etc. Some have the knee bent at 90°, some at 60°, some at closer to 120°. Also, the degree of ornamentation of the leg wear and spur varies considerably.
The three legs are reflected in the island&#x27;s Latin motto (adopted late in the symbol&#x27;s history): &quot;Quocunque Jeceris Stabit&quot;; traditionally translated into English as &quot;Whithersoever you throw it, it will stand&quot;, or &quot;Whichever way you throw it, it will stand&quot;.

The origin of the Three Legs of Man (as they are usually called) is explained in the Manx legend that Manannan repelled an invasion by transforming into the three legs and rolling down the hill and defeating the invaders.

==Religion==
The predominant religious tradition of the island is Anglican Christianity. The ancient Christian Church of the island is today part of the Church of England. The present-day Anglican Diocese of Sodor and Man traces its history - through many changes in tradition and detail - to 1154. Like all ancient Anglican churches, the diocese formed part of the then mainstream of western Christian tradition, the Roman Catholic Church until the 16th-century English Reformation. The diocese has been part of the national churches of Norway, Scotland, and England. It has also come under the influence of Irish religious tradition. Since 1541 its bishop and 28 parishes have formed part of the ecclesiastical Province of York.

Other Christian churches also operate on Mann. The second-largest denomination is the Methodist Church, which is close in size to the Anglican diocese. There are eight Roman Catholic parish churches, under the authority of the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Liverpool. Additionally there are five Baptist churches, four Pentecostal churches, the Salvation Army, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day-Saints, a congregation of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, two United Reformed churches, and other Christian churches. There are also many other faith organisations on the island. The small Muslim community has a mosque in Douglas, which local worshippers regularly attend several times a day.
There is a small Jewish community on the island. 

==Music==
Prior to the 15th century, little can be determined about the character of music on the Isle of Man. There are many carved crosses from this era, but they depict a total of two musicians, one lur player and a harpist. Songs from this era may have had Scandinavian origins; some also bear similarities to Irish and Scottish music. The song (the Manx sword dance), is very similar to a lullaby from the Hebrides and is also said to have been a ritual dance during the Scandinavian era.

Church music is the most documented Manx music of the 19th century. The first collection of Manx church songs was printed in 1799, and was followed by many other collections, though it was not until the 1870s and 1880s that Manx music began to be published in any great quantity, as drawing-room ballads, religious songs, and choral arrangements all became popular. The proliferation of this music coincided with a boom in the tourism industry for the Isle, and Manx music-hall and dance-hall songs and dances saw increased demand.

By the 20th century instrumental music accompanied most worship on the Isle of Man. Later in the 20th century, Manx church musical traditions slowly declined.

The 1970s folk revival was kickstarted, after the 1974 death of the last native speaker of Manx, by a music festival called in Ramsey.

Culture Vannin has a dedicated Manx Music Development Officer who works to promote Manx music and dance in both the school curriculum and the wider community. CDs by bands, soloists and Gaelic choirs are frequently produced.

==Myth, legend and folklore==
===Stories concerning the island&#x27;s history===
An Irish folktale attributes the formation of the Isle of Man to Ireland&#x27;s legendary hero Fionn mac Cumhaill (commonly anglicised to Finn McCool). Finn was in pursuit of a Scottish giant, and hoping to prevent his escape by swimming across the sea, he scooped a huge mass of clay and rock from Northern Ireland and hurled it, but he overshot, and the chunk of earth landed in the Irish Sea, thus creating the Isle Of Man. The hole he created became Lough Neagh.

The name of Isle of Man is eponymous after Manannán mac Lir, a Celtic sea god, according to an old Irish lexicon (Cormac&#x27;s glossary or Sanas Cormaic). A further tidbit of Manx mythology provides that Manannan, who was &quot;the first man of Man, rolled on three legs like a wheel through the mist&quot; (O&#x27;Donovan, the translator of the glossary. Manannan was called &quot;The Three-Legged Man&quot; () and all the inhabitants were three-legged when St. Patrick arrived.

A &quot;traditionary ballad&quot; entitled &quot;Mannanan beg mac y Leirr; ny, slane coontey jeh Ellan Vannin&quot; (&quot;Little Mannanan son of Leirr; or, an (whole) account of the Isle of Man&quot;)(dated to 1507–22), states that the Isle of Man was once under the rule of Mannan, who used to impose a token tax from the island folk, until Saint Patrick came and banished the heathen. One quatrain runs: &quot;It was not with his sword he kept it/ Neither with arrows or bow. / But when he would see ships sailing, / He would cover it round with a fog.&quot; (Str. 4) &quot;. So Mannanan here is said to have raised a mist or fog to conceal the whole island from detection (cf. Féth fíada). The fee or rent that Mannanan demanded was a bundle of coarse marsh-grass like rushes (&quot;leaogher-ghlass&quot;), to be delivered every &quot;Midsummer Eve&quot; (24 June)

===Mythical creatures===
In the Manx tradition of folklore, there are many stories of mythical creatures and characters. These include:
*the , a malevolent spirit who according to legend blew the roof off St Trinian&#x27;s Church in a fit of rage
*the often helpful but unpredictable , comparable to the brownie
*the , a water-dwelling shapeshifter (a hairy goblin in some tales and a water-horse in others) that comes onto land to interact with humans or livestock
*the tarroo-ushtey or Water-Bull, an &quot;amphibious creature&quot; resembling a bull that tries unsuccessfully to procreate with cows
*the cabbyl-ushtey or water horse, the more harmless variant of the Scottish each-uisge 
*the , a ghostly black dog who once wandered the walls and corridors of Peel Castle and frightened the guards on duty
*Jimmy Squarefoot, a peaceful bipedal creature with a human body, a pig&#x27;s head, and boar tusks

Mann is also said to be home to the mooinjer veggey ) or &quot;the little folk&quot; in the Manx language, though they are sometimes referred to obliquely by locals as &quot;themselves&quot;. There is a famous Fairy Bridge and it is said to be bad luck if one fails to wish the fairies good morning or afternoon when passing over it. Other types of fairies are the (???) and the or &quot;Arc-Vuc-Soney&quot; &quot;Lucky-Boar-Pig&quot;.

== Cuisine ==

Traditionally the national dish of the island is &quot;spuds and herrin&quot;, boiled potatoes and herring. This plain dish is chosen because of its role supporting the subsistence farmers of the island, who crofted the land and fished the sea for centuries.

A more recent claim for the title of national dish is the ubiquitous chips, cheese and gravy. This dish, which is similar to poutine, is found in most of the island&#x27;s fast-food outlets, and consists of thick-cut chips, covered in shredded Manx Cheddar cheese and topped with a thick gravy. Baked potato with a variety of toppings such as chili beans is a popular fast-food dish not typically served in English take-aways.

Seafood has traditionally accounted for a large proportion of the local diet. Although commercial fishing has declined in recent years, local delicacies include Manx kippers (smoked herring) which are produced by the smokeries in Peel on the west coast of the island. The smokeries also produce other specialities including smoked salmon and bacon.

Crab, lobster and scallops are commercially fished, and the queen scallop (&quot;queenies&quot;) is particularly well-regarded, with a light, sweet flavour. Cod, ling and mackerel are often angled for the table, and freshwater trout and salmon can be taken from the local rivers and lakes, supported by the Government fish hatchery at Cornaa.

Cattle, sheep, pigs and poultry are all commercially farmed, with Manx lamb from the hill-farms being a popular dish. The Loaghtan, the indigenous breed of Manx sheep, has a rich, dark meat that has found favour with chefs, featuring in dishes on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;MasterChef&quot; series.

Manx cheese has been a particular success, featuring smoked and herb-flavoured varieties, and is stocked by many of the UK&#x27;s supermarket chains. Manx cheese took bronze medals in the 2005 British Cheese Awards, and sold 578 tonnes over the year. There are not many unique desserts, although the Peel flapjack is a popular one.

Beer is brewed on a commercial scale by Okells Brewery (established in 1850), Bushy&#x27;s Brewery and Hooded Ram Brewing Company (established in 2013). The island has a beer purity law, resembling the German &quot;Reinheitsgebot&quot;, dating from 1874.

== Sports ==

The Isle of Man is represented as a nation in the Commonwealth Games and the Island Games and hosted the IV Commonwealth Youth Games in 2011. Manx sports people have won three golds at the Commonwealth Games, the most recent being Mark Cavendish, a professional cyclist, in 2006 in the scratch race. Cavendish has had great success in cycling, having won thirty five stages of the Tour de France to date and the Milan–San Remo classic. The island started the Island Games in 1985, and also hosted the Island Games in 2001.

Isle of Man teams and individuals participate in many sports both on and off the island including rugby union, football, gymnastics, hockey, netball, bowling and cricket. It being an island, many types of watersports are also popular with residents.

=== Motorcycle racing ===

The main international event associated with the island is the Isle of Man Tourist Trophy race, colloquially known as &quot;The TT&quot;, which began in 1907. It takes place in late May and early June. The TT is now an international road racing event for motorcycles, which used to be part of the World Championship, and is long considered to be one of the &quot;greatest motorcycle sporting event of the world&quot;. Taking place over a two-week period, it has become a festival for motorcycling culture, makes a huge contribution to the island&#x27;s economy and has become part of Manx identity. For many, the Isle carries the title &quot;road racing capital of the world&quot;.

The Manx Grand Prix is a separate motorcycle event for amateurs and private entrants that uses the same Snaefell Mountain Course in late August and early September.

===Cammag===

Cammag is the national sport of Mann. It is similar to the Irish hurling, and Scottish game of shinty. Once the most popular sport on the island, it ceased to be played by the start of the 20th century. It has more recently been revived with an annual match at St John&#x27;s.

<doc id="1327328" wikidata="Q600839" url="?curid=1327328" title="Rain (Beatles song)">
<text>&quot;Rain&quot; is a song by the English rock band the Beatles, released on 30 May 1966 as the B-side of their &quot;Paperback Writer&quot; single. Both songs were recorded during the sessions for &quot;Revolver&quot;, although neither appear on that album. &quot;Rain&quot; was written by John Lennon and credited to the Lennon–McCartney partnership. He described it as being &quot;about people moaning about the weather all the time&quot;.

The song&#x27;s recording contains a slowed-down rhythm track, a droning bass line and backwards vocals. Its release marked one of the first times that reversed sounds appeared in a pop song, although the Beatles used the same technique on the &quot;Revolver&quot; track &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot;, recorded days earlier. Ringo Starr considers &quot;Rain&quot; his best recorded drum performance. Three promotional films were created for the song, and they are considered among the early precursors of music videos.

==Background and inspiration==
Commenting on &quot;Rain&quot;, Lennon said it addressed &quot;People moaning because ... they don&#x27;t like the weather&quot;. Another interpretation is that the song&#x27;s &quot;rain&quot; and &quot;sun&quot; are phenomena experienced during a benign LSD trip. Lennon had sung of the importance of mind over matter in the Beatles&#x27; 1963 song &quot;There&#x27;s a Place&quot;; with &quot;Rain&quot;, he furthered this idea through the influence of hallucinogenic drugs. Author Nicholas Schaffner recognises it as the first Beatles song to portray the material world as an illusion, a theme Lennon and George Harrison explored at length during the band&#x27;s psychedelic period.

In an early-1970s article on the Lennon–McCartney songwriting partnership, &quot;Rain&quot; was one of the songs Lennon said he wrote alone. According to Paul McCartney&#x27;s recollection in his 1997 authorised biography &quot;Many Years from Now&quot;, the pair collaborated on it, and the song&#x27;s authorship was &quot;70–30 to John&quot;. In what Beatles biographer Steve Turner deems an oversimplification that ignores the philosophical aspect, McCartney recalled: &quot;Songs have traditionally treated rain as a bad thing and what we got on to was that it&#x27;s no bad thing. There&#x27;s no greater feeling than the rain dripping down your back.&quot;

==Composition==
According to musicologist Alan Pollack, although the Beatles recording has &quot;no sitars or other ethnic &#x27;world music&#x27; instruments&quot;, &quot;Rain&quot; strongly evokes the style of Indian classical music through its &quot;droning harmony and the, at times florid tune&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pollack/Notes&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnomusicologist David Reck recognises the song as &quot;a more subtle absorption of Orientalism&quot; in comparison with &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot; and &quot;Love You To&quot;, but one nevertheless possessing an Indian sound through Harrison&#x27;s distorted lead guitar, Ringo Starr&#x27;s drumming, and the use of reverse tape effects. Lennon&#x27;s singing also draws on the flat timbre and ornamentation, in the form of gamaka, of Hindustani vocal music.

Set in the key of G major (the final mix pitches it about a quarter of a semitone below this, while the backing track was taped in A flat major), the song begins with what Pollack calls &quot;a ra-ta-tat half-measure&#x27;s fanfare of solo snare drums&quot;, followed by a guitar intro of the first chord. The verses are nine measures long, and the song is in time. Each verse is based on the G, C and D chords (I, IV, and V). The refrain contains only I and IV chords, and is twelve measures long (the repetition of a six-measure pattern). The first two measures are the G chord. The third and fourth measures are the C chord in the so-called (second) inversion. The fifth and sixth measures return to the G chord. Pollack says the refrain seems slower than the verse, though it is at the same tempo, an illusion achieved by &quot;the change of beat for the first four measures from its erstwhile bounce to something more plodding and regular&quot;.

After four verses and two refrains, a short solo for guitar and drums is played, with complete silence for one beat. Following this, the music returns accompanied by a portion of singing for which the recording is reversed.

Allan Kozinn describes McCartney&#x27;s bass as &quot;an ingenious counterpoint that takes him all over the fretboard ... while Lennon and McCartney harmonize in fourths on a melody with a slightly Middle Eastern tinge, McCartney first points up the song&#x27;s droning character by hammering on a high G (approached with a quick slide from the F natural just below it), playing it steadily on the beat for twenty successive beats.&quot;

==Recording==
The Beatles began recording &quot;Rain&quot; at EMI Studios (now Abbey Road Studios) in London on 14 April 1966, in the same session as &quot;Paperback Writer&quot;. They completed the track on 16 April, with a series of overdubs before mixing on the same day. At that time, the band were enthusiastic about experimenting in the studio to achieve new sounds and effects. These experiments were showcased on their seventh album, &quot;Revolver&quot;. Geoff Emerick, who was the engineer for both sessions, described one technique he used to alter the sonic texture of the recording by taping the backing track &quot;faster than normal&quot;. When played back, slightly slower than the usual speed, &quot;the music had a radically different tonal quality.&quot; The opposite technique was used to alter the tone of Lennon&#x27;s lead vocal: it was recorded with the tape machine slowed down, making Lennon&#x27;s voice sound higher when played back.

Lennon played a 1965 Gretsch Nashville, McCartney a 1964 Rickenbacker 4001S bass, Harrison a 1964 Gibson SG, and Starr Ludwig drums. To boost the bass signal, Emerick recorded McCartney&#x27;s amplifier via a loudspeaker, which EMI technical engineer Ken Townsend had reconfigured to serve as a microphone. Although this technique was used only on the two songs selected for the standalone single, an enhanced bass sound was a characteristic of much of &quot;Revolver&quot;.

The increased volume of the bass guitar contravened EMI regulations, which were born out of concern that the powerful sound would cause a record buyer&#x27;s stylus to jump. The &quot;Paperback Writer&quot; / &quot;Rain&quot; single was therefore the first release to use a device invented by the maintenance department at EMI called Automatic Transient Overload Control (ATOC). The new device allowed the record to be cut at a louder volume than any other single up to that time.

===Backwards sounds===
The coda of &quot;Rain&quot; includes backwards vocals, which Lennon later claimed was the first use of this technique on a record, although &quot;H&#x27;tuom Tuhs&quot;, by Sydney band The Missing Links had actually been released in October of the previous year. Edited together from Lennon&#x27;s vocal track, the backwards portion consists of him singing the word &quot;sunshine&quot;, then a drawn-out &quot;rain&quot; taken from one of the choruses, and finally the song&#x27;s opening line, &quot;If the rain comes they run and hide their heads&quot;. In author Robert Rodriguez&#x27;s description, accompanied by the backing vocalists singing the song title on another track, Lennon&#x27;s vocal &quot;evoked the sound of a blissed-out zealot speaking in tongues in a trancelike state&quot;.

Both Lennon and producer George Martin claimed credit for the idea. Lennon said in 1966:

Harrison confirmed Lennon&#x27;s creative accident, as did Emerick, but Martin told Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn in 1987:

Lennon repeated his version of events in a 1968 interview with Jonathan Cott of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. In a 1980 interview, Lennon recalled:

Regardless of who is credited for the technique, &quot;from that point on&quot;, Emerick wrote, &quot;almost every overdub we did on &quot;Revolver&quot; had to be tried backwards as well as forwards.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;RS/GreatestBeatles&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release and reception==
&quot;Rain&quot; was released as the B-side to &quot;Paperback Writer&quot; in the United States on 30 May 1966 (as Capitol 5651) and in the UK on 10 June. It was the Beatles&#x27; first UK single since the &quot;Day Tripper&quot; / &quot;We Can Work It Out&quot; double A-side in December 1965. The new record showed profound changes in the Beatles&#x27; image, after the band had spent the first half of 1966 largely out of the public eye. Music journalist Jon Savage describes the two tracks as &quot;saturated in clanging guitar and Indian textures&quot;, and each reflective of a different side of &quot;the psychedelic coin&quot;. In author Shawn Levy&#x27;s description, as a prelude to &quot;Revolver&quot;, the single offered the first clue of the Beatles&#x27; transformation into &quot;the world&#x27;s first household psychedelics, avatars of something wilder and more revolutionary than anything pop culture had ever delivered before&quot;. &quot;Cash Box&quot; described the song as a &quot;soulful, medium-paced, effectively-rendered blueser.&quot;

In the United States, the song peaked at number 23 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 on 9 July 1966, and remained in that position the following week. The &quot;Paperback Writer&quot; single reached number 1 in the UK and the US, as well as Australia and West Germany.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Rain&quot; 469th in its list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot; in 2010 and 463rd in 2004. On a similar list compiled by the New York radio station Q104.3, the song appeared at number 382. Both Ian MacDonald and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described Starr&#x27;s drumming on the track as &quot;superb&quot;, while Richie Unterberger of AllMusic praises his &quot;creative drum breaks&quot;. In 1984, Starr said: &quot;I think it&#x27;s the best out of all the records I&#x27;ve ever made. &#x27;Rain&#x27; blows me away … I know me and I know my playing … and then there&#x27;s &#x27;Rain&#x27;.&quot; In his article on the band&#x27;s singles, Alexis Petridis of &quot;The Guardian&quot; describes the song as &quot;simultaneously thunderous and dreamy psych&quot;, and &quot;perhaps the best Beatles B-side of all&quot;. &quot;Rain&quot; was ranked 20th in &quot;Mojo&quot;″s list of &quot;The 101 Greatest Beatles Songs&quot;, compiled in 2006 by a panel of critics and musicians. The magazine&#x27;s editors credited it with launching a &quot;countercultural downpour&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mojo/101 Greatest&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Music critic Jim DeRogatis describes the track as &quot;the Beatles&#x27; first great psychedelic rock song&quot;. Music historian Simon Philo recognises its release as marking &quot;the birth of British psychedelic rock&quot;, as well as a forerunner to the unprecedented studio exploration and Indian aesthetic of &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot; and &quot;Love You To&quot;, respectively. It has been noted for its slowed-down rhythm track and backwards vocals, anticipating the studio experimentation of &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot; and other songs on &quot;Revolver&quot;, which was released in August 1966. Musicologist Walter Everett cites its closing section as an example of how the Beatles pioneered the &quot;fade-out–fade-in coda&quot;, a device used again by them on &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; and &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;, and by Led Zeppelin on &quot;Thank You&quot;. From its introduction in &quot;Rain&quot;, the Hindustani gamaka vocal ornamentation was adopted by several bands in the late 1960s, including the Moody Blues (on &quot;The Sun Set&quot;), the Hollies (&quot;King Midas in Reverse&quot;) and Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash (&quot;Guinnevere&quot;).

&quot;Rain&quot; was first mixed in stereo in December 1969 for its inclusion on the US compilation album &quot;Hey Jude&quot; early the following year. The track subsequently appeared on &quot;Rarities&quot; in the UK and the &quot;Past Masters, Volume Two&quot; CD.

==Promotional films==
The Beatles created three promotional films for &quot;Rain&quot;, following on from their first attempts with the medium for their December 1965 single. Authors Mark Hertsgaard and Bob Spitz both recognise the 1966 promos for &quot;Paperback Writer&quot; and &quot;Rain&quot; as the first examples of music videos. In the case of &quot;Rain&quot;, it marked a rare instance where the Beatles prepared a clip for a B-side, later examples being &quot;Revolution&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Me Down&quot;.

The films were directed by Michael Lindsay-Hogg, who had worked with the band on the television programme &quot;Ready Steady Go!&quot; One shows the Beatles walking and singing in the gardens and conservatory of Chiswick House in west London, and was filmed on 20 May. The other two clips feature the band performing on a sound stage at EMI Studios on 19 May; one was filmed in colour for &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; and the other in black and white for broadcast in the UK. McCartney was injured in a moped accident on 26 December 1965, six months before the filming of &quot;Rain&quot;, and close-ups in the film reveal a chipped tooth. McCartney&#x27;s appearance in the film played a role in the &quot;Paul is dead&quot; rumours from 1969.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fontenot/About&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The band also promoted the single with a rare TV appearance, miming to both songs on the BBC show &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; on 16 June.

&quot;The Beatles&#x27; Anthology&quot; documentary video includes an edit combining the Chiswick House promo for &quot;Rain&quot; with shots from the two black-and-white EMI clips and unused colour footage from the 20 May filming. The new edit also employs rhythmic fast cuts. Unterberger writes that this creates an impression that the 1966 promos were more technically complex, fast-paced and innovative than was the case. For example, the backwards film effects are 1990s creations. Such effects were actually first deployed in the &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; promotional film of January 1967.

==Covers, samples and media references==
Petula Clark covered &quot;Rain&quot; on her 1966 album &quot;I Couldn&#x27;t Live Without Your Love&quot;. Dan Ar Braz covered &quot;Rain&quot; on his 1979 album &quot;The Earth&#x27;s Lament&quot;, and later performed it with Fairport Convention at the Cropredy Festival in 1997. Polyrock covered the song on their second album &quot;Changing Hearts&quot; (1981). Todd Rundgren has also covered the song, as has the late Dan Fogelberg, who reprised it as part of his own cover of &quot;Rhythm of the Rain&quot;. Shonen Knife covered the song on their 1991 album &quot;712&quot;. Aloe Blacc sings it as Boris the Frog in the eponymous &quot;Beat Bugs&quot; episode 3b.

Andy Partridge of XTC has said that &quot;Rain&quot; was an inspiration on his 1980 song &quot;Towers of London&quot;. In his commentary with &quot;Mojo&quot;″s selection of the best Beatles songs, Partridge recalled that on the night after Lennon was murdered in December 1980, the band played a gig at Liverpool, where they incorporated &quot;Rain&quot; in the coda to &quot;Towers of London&quot;; Partridge added, &quot;I felt torn apart and had tears rolling down my face.&quot; U2 played the song in whole or in part throughout many of their tours, usually during outdoor concerts when it has started to rain. Pearl Jam improvised &quot;Rain&quot; into their song &quot;Jeremy&quot; during their 1992 Pinkpop Festival show and played it in full at the 2012 Isle of Wight Festival. Kula Shaker covered the song live at Reading Festival in 1996. The Grateful Dead played it twenty times throughout the early 1990s. Shoegaze band Chapterhouse covered the song for on their 1990 EP &quot;Sunburst&quot;. Croatian and Yugoslav punk rock band Psihomodo Pop recorded a cover entitled &quot;Kiša&quot; (&quot;Rain&quot;) on their 2014 album &quot;Ćiribu ćiriba&quot; (&quot;Hocus Pocus&quot;).

The Beatles tribute act derives their name from the song. Oasis first named themselves the Rain after the Beatles track. In music critic Chris Ingham&#x27;s view, Oasis went on to add &quot;a dash of Slade&quot; to &quot;Rain&quot; and &quot;base their entire style on it&quot;.

==Personnel==
According to Ian MacDonald:

*John Lennon – lead and backing vocals, rhythm guitar
*Paul McCartney – backing vocals, bass
*George Harrison – backing vocals, lead guitar

<text>Dorothea &quot;Dodo&quot; Chaplet is a fictional character played by Jackie Lane in the long-running British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. An Earth teenager from the year 1966, she was a companion of the First Doctor. Dodo was depicted as child-like, friendly, and upbeat, serving in a surrogate granddaughter role for the Doctor during her time in the series. Dodo travelled with the Doctor for four serials, departing in the serial &quot;The War Machines&quot;. Dodo has appeared in several spin-off productions, including Big Finish audio dramas and novels.

The character of Anne Chaplet was originally meant to take on Dodo&#x27;s companion role, but following the failure of a previous companion from a time in Earth&#x27;s past, Dodo was created to fulfill Anne&#x27;s role. Series producer Innes Lloyd did not have room for Dodo&#x27;s character in the series, and as a result scrapped the character early on into her tenure.

Following her appearance in the series, Lane found herself typecast in Dodo-like roles, resulting in her leaving acting and moving onto other jobs. Lane largely distanced herself for the series, very rarely becoming involved with conventions and interviews. Dodo was regarded as a fun addition to the series, and was considered a favorite among fans. 

==Appearances==

===Television===
Dodo is introduced at the end of the serial &quot;The Massacre of St Bartholomew&#x27;s Eve&quot;. In that story, the Doctor and Steven travel to 1572 Paris, using the Doctor&#x27;s time machine, the TARDIS. There, the Doctor and Steven witness the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day massacre. Despite befriending a young woman named Anne Chaplet, the Doctor knows he cannot prevent the coming massacre and leaves Anne behind. The TARDIS lands in the 1960s London. Dodo wanders into the TARDIS, thinking it was a real police box. The Doctor hypothesizes that Dodo may be Anne&#x27;s descendent, and Dodo leaves with the Doctor and Steven. 

Dodo is an orphan, and has no family in her home time. Dodo is depicted as being friendly, upbeat and hopeful in her characterization throughout the series. Dodo reminded the Doctor of his granddaughter, Susan Foreman. She is additionally depicted as naive and child-like. 

In the following serial, &quot;The Ark&quot;, Dodo inadvertently brings her common cold to a future generation ship, which infects the humans on board. This allows the alien Monoids to come to power. The Doctor, Dodo, and Steven are able to thwart the Monoids. Following this, she travels with the Doctor and Steven in the serials &quot;The Celestial Toymaker&quot;, &quot;The Gunfighters&quot;, and &quot;The Savages&quot;. She makes her final appearance in &quot;The War Machines&quot;, where the villainous WOTAN hypnotizes her. She is taken to the country to recover but does not reappear after this. Ben and Polly reveal to the Doctor that she elected to stay in the 20th century. 

Dodo subsequently appeared in spin-off media. She appears in the novels &quot;Salvation&quot; and &quot;The Man in the Velvet Mask&quot;, set during her travels with the Doctor and Steven. &quot;Salvation&quot; reveals that Dodo is actually a nickname given to her by bullies, and that her real name is Dorothea. Dodo also appears in the Past Doctor Adventures novel &quot;Bunker Soldiers&quot;, four short stories in the &quot;Virgin Decalog&quot; and &quot;BBC Short Trips&quot;, and several Big Finish Productions audio dramas. She also appears in the book &quot;Who Killed Kennedy&quot;, which depicts Dodo following the events of &quot;The War Machines&quot;, revealing she suffered a nervous breakdown following the serial, and was drifting in and out of psychiatric institutions. Dodo begins a relationship with the book&#x27;s protagonist, James Stevens, but is subsequently killed. A republishing of the novel later depicts Stevens requesting the Doctor&#x27;s help to travel back in time and save her life. 

==Conception and casting==
Dodo was portrayed by actress Jackie Lane. According to several sources, Lane had previously been considered for the part of Susan. Lane was frequently cast in the role of child-like characters due to her youthful appearance and short height. Dodo was the first of many companions to be considered &quot;trendy&quot;, in part due to her fashion. According to Lane, she got on well with her co-stars William Hartnell and Peter Purves, and especially well with Hartnell, who was typically considered to be irate. 

Lane was originally planned to depict Anne Chaplet, but this was changed to Dodo following the failure of a previous companion who hailed from the past, Katarina. Dodo fulfilled Susan&#x27;s earlier role in the series, acting as a surrogate granddaughter for the Doctor. Dodo was originally intended to have a &quot;common&quot; accent, and she is portrayed this way at the end of &quot;The Massacre&quot;. However, starting with the next story, &quot;The Ark&quot;, it was declared that &quot;Doctor Who&quot; regulars were required to speak in &quot;BBC English&quot;, and so Dodo&#x27;s accent was changed. In a 1988 interview with &quot;Doctor Who&quot; Magazine, she stated that Innes Lloyd, then the series&#x27; producer, had plans for the series that did not involve Dodo or Steven, resulting in Dodo being written out of the series with an anticlimactic ending for the character. 

Dodo&#x27;s appearance in &quot;The Man in the Velvet Mask&quot; was chosen because author David O&#x27;Mahoney wanted to have a single companion alongside the Doctor, and felt Dodo&#x27;s obscurity gave him more room to explore her character. The novel provided a large amount of characterization for the character. Many &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novel authors went for obscure characters like Dodo for stories at the time for similar reasons, as it allowed authors to push limits with the characters not possible with more popular characters.

Following her time on the show, Lane found herself in many more roles but was annoyed at being frequently typecast in roles similar to Dodo. She thus quit acting as a result and took on many different jobs, including a voiceover agency. Lloyd would later request help finding work from Lane&#x27;s agency, with Lane declining as &quot;revenge&quot; for being removed from the role of Dodo. Lane was reluctant to attend interviews or conventions. She recounted one interview in 1992, during which she realized how much of an impact her role as Dodo had made. She rarely returned to the franchise, though she filmed a greeting in celebration of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;&#x27;s 50th Anniversary.

==Reception==
The book &quot;Doctor Who: A History&quot; stated that Dodo&#x27;s introduction helped bring a &quot;sense of fun&quot; to the show after a darker atmosphere in the months prior, with &quot;The Times&quot; concurring, stating that Dodo brought &quot;youth and energy to the show&quot;. Dodo has been described as a fan favorite, in part due to her role in the early days of the franchise. The book &quot;Who Travels with the Doctor?: Essays on the Companions of Doctor Who&quot; described Dodo as being a highly abused and obscure character in the series, as she frequently suffered from misfortunes and her short time in the series.

<doc id="1327353" wikidata="Q5429409" url="?curid=1327353" title="Fagging">
<text>Fagging was a traditional practice in British public schools and also at many other boarding schools, whereby younger pupils were required to act as personal servants to the eldest boys. Although probably originating earlier, the first accounts of fagging appeared in the late 17th century. 
Fagging sometimes involved physical abuse and/or sexual abuse. Although lessening in severity over the centuries, the practice continued in some institutions until the end of the 20th century.

==History==
Fagging originated as a structure for maintaining order in boarding schools, when schoolmasters&#x27; authority was practically limited to the classroom. Thomas Arnold, headmaster of Rugby from 1828 to 1841, defined fagging as the power given by the authorities of the school to the Sixth Form, to be exercised by them over younger boys. Fagging was a fully established system at St Paul&#x27;s, Eton, and Winchester in the sixteenth century.

Fagging carried with it well-defined rights and duties on both sides. The senior, sometimes called the fag-master, was the protector of his fags and responsible for their happiness and good conduct. In case of any problem outside the classroom, such as bullying or injustice, a junior boy&#x27;s recourse was to him, not to a form master or housemaster, and, except in the gravest cases, all incidents were dealt with by the fag-master on his own responsibility.

The duties undertaken by fags, the time taken, and their general treatment varied widely. Each school had its own traditions and expectations. Until around 1900, a fag&#x27;s duties would include such humble tasks as blacking boots, brushing clothes, and cooking breakfasts, and there was no limit as to hours the fag would be expected to work. Later, fagging was restricted to such tasks as running errands and bringing tea to the fag-master&#x27;s study. The 1911 &quot;Britannica&quot; details an evolution of the role at Eton. Under school rules, fagging might involve harsh discipline and corporal punishment when those were standard practices.

In 1930, an inquest into the death of a 14-year-old schoolboy from Sedbergh School (then in West Yorkshire) heard that, rather than returning after holidays, he took his life because of his dislike of the fagging system. The jury returned a verdict of suicide and recommended the discontinuation of the practice in public schools.

During the late 20th century, fagging became unfashionable in British public schools, as attitudes to boarding education and child development changed. Despite the reluctance of senior boys who had served their time and expected to enjoy the benefits of the system, between the 1960s and 1980s the duties first became less onerous and then the system was abolished at most major public schools; the passing of the Children Act 1989 caused most British schools to ban the practice and it is now obsolete in Britain.

There is a history of fagging in schools in former British colonies (see India, South Africa) where fagging continues in a limited form at some schools.

In 2017, the actor Simon Williams described how, as a new pupil at Harrow School in 1959, he was required to fag for a prefect four years his senior, involving duties such as spit-shining his shoes, making his bed, serving tea, and even warming the toilet seat.

==Sexual abuse==
Fagging was sometimes associated with both consensual sexual service and sexual abuse. Christopher Tyerman, writing about the history of Harrow School, stated that in some situations, fagging could either encourage or conceal sexual activity between students, and that, at Harrow, fagging began to decline around the same time as the school started actively discouraging homosexual behaviour but continued in formal school life until the 1990s.

==In memoirs, literature and art==

Many authors have written of the experience of the harsh regimes experienced within public or boarding schools; some in novels and others in memoirs.
* Percy Bysshe Shelley, who entered Eton College in 1804, was bullied for refusing to aid his assigned prefect.
* Fagging is depicted in the 1857 novel &quot;Tom Brown&#x27;s School Days&quot; by Thomas Hughes, which is set at Rugby School.
* George Augustus Sala in his 1859 book &quot;Twice Round the Clock &quot;describes the most noble Marquis of Millefleurs, aged ten, at Eton, tending to Tom Tucker, &#x27;an army clothier&#x27;s son&#x27; as a fag. He has to clean his shoes but also prepare his bacon and toast for breakfast.
* E. W. Hornung&#x27;s stories about fictional gentleman thief A. J. Raffles (created in 1898) are narrated by Raffles&#x27;s companion Bunny Manders, who fagged for Raffles in their school years.
* C. S. Lewis&#x27;s partial autobiography, &quot;Surprised by Joy&quot; (1955), mentions fagging (see Chapter VI, pp. 94–95).
* Some characters in P. G. Wodehouse&#x27;s school stories are fags, such as Reginald Robinson in &quot;The Pothunters&quot; (1902) and Thomas Renford in &quot;The Gold Bat&quot; (1904).
* In his 1984 autobiography, Roald Dahl states that when he was a young fag, he was instructed to warm toilet seats for older boys at Repton School, and he wrote a fictional account of the experience of fagging in his short story &quot;Galloping Foxley&quot;.
* Yana Toboso&#x27;s manga series &quot;Black Butler&quot; showcases the fagging system in its Public School Arc, with the main protagonist, Ciel Phantomhive, becoming a fag when he enrolls to investigate events at Weston College.
* &quot;If...&quot; (1968) shows life in a public school and the fagging system, specifically how junior boys are made to act as personal servants for the eldest boys and are discussed as sex objects.

<text>The Central Criminal Court of Iraq, or CCCI, is a criminal court of Iraq. The CCCI is based on an inquisitorial system and consists of two chambers: an investigative court and a criminal court. The court was created by the Coalition Provisional Authority in 2003 to handle cases involving serious crimes such as governmental corruption, terrorism and organized crime that were previously handled by governorate level judges in the ordinary criminal courts. Candidates for the judiciary had to be an Iraqi national of high moral character and reputation, a non-member of the Ba&#x27;ath Party, demonstrate a &quot;high level of legal competence&quot;, and sign an oath of office.

==Criticism==

There has been criticism of the court, as well as the broader judiciary of Iraq. &quot;The New York Times&quot; published an investigative article critical of the court, and Human Rights Watch has said that:

The United Nations Assistance Mission in Iraq recommended that the government &quot;review procedures before criminal courts and adopt measures consistent with minimum standards for fair trial; adopt measures to ensure basic rights for defendants, including timely and adequate access to defence counsel, and continuity of representation by counsel at all stages of the proceedings; give consideration to implementing a moratorium on the death penalty pending a thorough review of legal proceedings followed at both pre-trial and trial stages.&quot;

<text>Swavesey is a village lying on the Prime Meridian of the world in Cambridgeshire, England, with a population of 2,463. The village is situated 9 miles to the north west of Cambridge and 3 miles south east of St Ives.

Listed as &quot;Suauesye&quot; in the Domesday Book of 1086, the name Swavesey means &quot;landing place (or island) of a man named Swaef&quot;.

== History ==
Swavesey, forming a historical parish of 3982 acres on the border with Huntingdonshire, lies on a narrow clay ridge rising to 18 metres above sea level at one time surrounded by fenland. The village was of importance during the early Middle Ages as the centre of a large 11th-century estate. A castle was built here in the late 11th or early 12th century, though is believed to have been derelict by 1200. Swavesey served as a port and subsequent market town and was fortified at the end of the 12th century.

An alien priory was founded in Swavesey shortly after the Norman Conquest, possibly replacing a Saxon minster.

Roman pottery has been found in the parish.

The village motto is &quot;Steadfast in Work and Play&quot;.

==Church==
There was already a church in Swavesey at the time of the Norman Conquest, possibly a minster, when Alan, Count of Richmond, granted it to the Abbey of St Sergius and St Bacchus in Angers, France. The Abbey founded an alien priory there by 1086, but Swavesey Priory was awarded to Alan la Zouche, lord of Swavesey manor, by the start of the 14th century.

The present parish church in Swavesey, dedicated to St Andrew since the 11th century, has a double aisle aspect to its nave. The east window in the Lady Chapel contains a 1967 Tree of Jesse by Francis Skeat. The present building has parts dating from the 11th century, but was substantially improved over the following four centuries.

A Unitarian chapel was built in 1831 on the corner of School Lane and High Street, and the congregation moved to a new Baptist chapel in 1869. The original Unitarian chapel was bought by a group of Methodists and served as their place of worship until it was converted into a bungalow in 1934.

Today, there are three places of worship in Swavesey: St Andrew&#x27;s parish church in Station Road, the Strict and Particular Baptist Church in Middle Watch, and the Bethel Baptist Church, also in Middle Watch.

==Transport==
The railway line from Cambridge to St Ives, which passed through Swavesey, was opened in 1847 and closed in 1970, but has reopened as the Cambridgeshire Guided Busway. The parish&#x27;s north border is formed by the River Great Ouse, formerly an important transport link. The parish&#x27;s south west border runs along the Via Devana, the old Roman road, that now forms the A14.

==Village life==
Farming is the main industry in and around Swavesey, although most residents commute to work. 

There were three pubs listed in the village in 1765, and eight by the early 19th century. By the late 19th century, this number had risen to 16, but had fallen back to eight by 1912, and only three by 1960. Since then the only 
public house in the village centre has been the White Horse Inn, open since at least 1765, and adjacent to the village post office and shop. Notable former pubs include the Rose and Crown, on the corner of Boxworth End and Rose and Crown Road, which was open by 1765 but closed in the 1880s. The Black Horse on the corner of High Street and Black Horse Lane served from around 1777 until 1910. The Swan, (later the Swan with Two Necks), on Station Road was open from around 1777 to 1917. The Blue Bell was active from the late 18th century until around the Second World War, and the George and Dragon also opened in the late 18th century and closed in the first years of the 20th century.

The village&#x27;s post office opened in the 1850s. Swavesey has a village magazine called &quot;The Meridian&quot;, and holds a biennial village festival. The MG Owners&#x27; Club has its UK headquarters just outside the village.

==Education==
The village contains one primary school, Swavesey Primary School, which claims to be the only school in the United Kingdom to lie on the meridian. Swavesey Village College is a secondary school, which opened in 1958. The school provides secondary education for surrounding villages, including Over, Bar Hill, Longstanton, and Fenstanton, and uses a vertical tutor system. As with other village colleges, Swavesey&#x27;s institution also provides adult education in the evenings and a myriad of extracurricular after-school clubs.

<text>Vesuvius plc is a British engineered ceramics company headquartered in London whose products are used by steelmakers and foundries as well as in the glass and solar energy industries. The company is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index.

==History==

The company was founded by Isaac Cookson in 1704 as a collection of metal and glass businesses on Tyneside. In 1851 the Company diversified into lead manufacturing. In 1924 it merged with &quot;Lock Lancaster&quot; and &quot;W.W. &amp; R. Johnson &amp; Sons&quot; to form &quot;Associated Lead Manufacturers&quot;. It was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1930. In 1966 it was renamed &quot;Lead Industries Group&quot; and in 1979 it acquired the &quot;A.J. Oster Company&quot;, a non-ferrous metal producer. In 1982 it changed its name again to &quot;Cookson Group&quot; (reflecting the name of the company&#x27;s founder) and in 1987 it bought the &quot;Vesuvius Crucible Company&quot;, a ceramics supplier.

Sir Robert Malpas was Chairman of the Group from 1991 to 1998, simultaneously serving as Co-Chairman of Eurotunnel from 1996 to 1998. In 2005 the Cookson Group chose to focus on high technology products and emerging markets. In 2008 it went on to acquire &quot;Foseco&quot;, a supplier to the foundry and steel industries. In December 2012 Cookson Group changed its name to Vesuvius, the former performance materials division was demerged to form a new company called Alent and the name Cookson ceased to be used.

==Operations==
The Company&#x27;s operations are formed into four activities: Steel Flow Control, Foundry Technologies, Advanced Refractories and Precious Metals Processing.

<text>James Albert Gary (October 22, 1833 – October 31, 1920) was a U.S. political figure. He was the Republican candidate in the 1879 Maryland gubernatorial election. He served as Postmaster General from 1897 to 1898.

==Early life==
James Albert Gary was born on October 22, 1833, in Uncasville, Connecticut, to Pamelia (née Forrest) and James Sullivan Gary. His father was a well-known manufacturer.

==Career==
In 1861, Gary joined his father under the firm James S. Gary &amp; Son. After the death of his father in 1870, Gary took over the ownership of his father&#x27;s company.

In 1858, Gary was nominated for the Maryland Senate under the Republican ticket, but lost. In 1861, he was a delegate to the Union convention held at the Maryland Institute. He was a delegate to the 1872 and the 1876 Republican National Conventions. He would attend the following national conventions until 1896. In 1872, Gary ran for U.S. Congress, but was defeated.

Gary ran as the Republican candidate for Maryland Governor in the 1879 election, losing to William Thomas Hamilton. He served as the Postmaster General from March 5, 1897, to his resignation due to illness on April 21, 1898. 

He spent much of his working life in textile manufacture in the Baltimore, Maryland, region, and was involved with cotton mills along the Patapsco and Patuxent Rivers, including Ely, Guilford, and Laurel, Maryland.

Gary served as president of the Merchants and Manufacturers&#x27; Association. He was also president of the Citizens&#x27; National Bank. Gary was vice president of the Consolidated Gas Company. He was director of the Savings Bank of Baltimore, Baltimore Warehouse Company, American Fire Insurance Company, Merchants and Manufacturers&#x27; Insurance Company and the Baltimore Trust and Guaranty Company.

==Personal life==

Gary married Lavinia W. Corrie in 1856. They had ten children, including E. Stanley, Mrs. Robert C. Taylor, Mrs. Henry Pratt Janes, Mrs. Harold Randolph, Mrs. Eugene Levering Jr., Mrs. Francis E. Pegram, Mrs. Van Lear Black and Mrs. Andrew H. Whitridge. Only eight of his children survived to adulthood.

Gary was a prominent member of Baltimore&#x27;s prestigious Brown Memorial Presbyterian Church and led the movement to establish Babcock Memorial Church there in memory of Brown Memorial&#x27;s minister, Maltbie Babcock. He also contributed to the construction of a church in Daniels, MD, which was later named in his honor: Gary Memorial United Methodist Church.

Gary had a home in the Mount Vernon section of Baltimore and a summer place in Catonsville.

Gary died on October 31, 1920, at his home at Linden Avenue and Dolphin Street in Baltimore. He was buried at Loudon Park Cemetery in Baltimore.

<doc id="1327379" wikidata="Q613814" url="?curid=1327379" title="Quantum wire">
<text>In mesoscopic physics, a quantum wire is an electrically conducting wire in which quantum effects influence the transport properties. Usually such effects appear in the dimension of nanometers, so they are also referred to as nanowires.

== Quantum effects ==
If the diameter of a wire is sufficiently small, electrons will experience quantum confinement in the transverse direction. As a result, their transverse energy will be limited to a series of discrete values. One consequence of this quantization is that the classical formula for calculating the electrical resistance of a wire,
: formula_1
is not valid for quantum wires (where formula_2 is the material&#x27;s resistivity, formula_3 is the length, and formula_4 is the cross-sectional area of the wire).

Instead, an exact calculation of the transverse energies of the confined electrons has to be performed to calculate a wire&#x27;s resistance. Following from the quantization of electron energy, the electrical conductance (the inverse of the resistance) is found to be quantized in multiples of formula_5, where formula_6 is the electron charge and formula_7 is the Planck constant. The factor of two arises from spin degeneracy. A single ballistic quantum channel (i.e. with no internal scattering) has a conductance equal to this quantum of conductance. The conductance is lower than this value in the presence of internal scattering.

The importance of the quantization is inversely proportional to the diameter of the nanowire for a given material. From material to material, it is dependent on the electronic properties, especially on the effective mass of the electrons. Physically, this means that it will depend on how conduction electrons interact with the atoms within a given material. In practice, semiconductors can show clear conductance quantization for large wire transverse dimensions (~100 nm) because the electronic modes due to confinement are spatially extended. As a result, their Fermi wavelengths are large and thus they have low energy separations. This means that they can only be resolved at cryogenic temperatures (within a few degrees of absolute zero) where the thermal energy is lower than the inter-mode energy separation.

For metals, quantization corresponding to the lowest energy states is only observed for atomic wires. Their corresponding wavelength being thus extremely small they have a very large energy separation which makes resistance quantization observable even at room temperature.

== Carbon nanotubes ==
The carbon nanotube is an example of a quantum wire. A metallic single-walled carbon nanotube that is sufficiently short to exhibit no internal scattering (ballistic transport) has a conductance that approaches two times the conductance quantum, formula_5. The factor of two arises because carbon nanotubes have two spatial channels.

The structure of a nanotube strongly affects its electrical properties. For a given (&quot;n&quot;,&quot;m&quot;) nanotube, if &quot;n&quot; = &quot;m&quot;, the nanotube is metallic; if &quot;n&quot; − &quot;m&quot; is a multiple of 3, then the nanotube is semiconducting with a very small band gap, otherwise the nanotube is a moderate semiconductor. Thus all armchair (&quot;n&quot; = &quot;m&quot;) nanotubes are metallic, and nanotubes (6,4), (9,1), etc. are semiconducting.

<doc id="1327381" wikidata="Q3771864" url="?curid=1327381" title="Gladius (video game)">
<text>Gladius is a 2003 tactical role-playing video game for GameCube, PlayStation 2, and Xbox. Developed and published by LucasArts, it was released for PlayStation 2 and Xbox in October 2003, and for GameCube in November. In December 2011, it was made available on the PlayStation Store, making it playable on the PlayStation 3, and in November 2021, it was added to Microsoft&#x27;s backward compatibility program, making it playable on the Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S.

The game tells two different, albeit similar, stories involving the same two protagonists; Valens (the son of one of the greatest gladiators the world has ever known) and Ursula (the adventure-craving, magic-infused daughter of the barbarian king). In each storyline, the protagonists form a school of gladiators to compete at regional games but soon find themselves facing a potentially world-ending event when an evil sorceress sets out to resurrect the Dark God Mortuus, who once brought the world to near-ruin.

&quot;Gladius&quot; was well received by critics, who praised the depth of the combat mechanics, the range of equipment, the extensive customization options, and, especially, the implantation of a hit meter mechanic during combat. Common points of criticism included an insubstantial storyline, inconsistent graphics, and the game&#x27;s length, with some critics feeling it was unnecessarily long.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Gladius&quot; is a turn-based tactical role-playing game. There are two main gameplay components — combat and a world map. The primary game mechanic tasks the player with building a school of gladiators and taking them into battle against opposing schools, winning regional tournaments so as to earn the right to compete in more prestigious tournaments. Upon beginning the game, the player must choose their player character from two options; Valens runs a school in the Roman-like Imperia, whilst Ursula is a member of a school run by her brother in the Nordic-like Nordagh. The storyline plays out differently depending on which character is used, but the overarching gameplay is the same across both characters.

===Combat===
Combat in &quot;Gladius&quot; uses an interleaved turn-based system. The player issues an order to a gladiator (such as &quot;move&quot;, &quot;strike&quot;, or &quot;defend&quot;) and the gladiator carries out that order. The player then either issues an order to another gladiator, or a computer controlled gladiator will perform an action, and so on. Each gladiator is free to move around the grid-pattern of the arena, but they can only move a certain distance per turn, determined by their character class, type of equipment, and status effects. This means that not every opponent is open to attack every turn. Different gladiators have different attacks and ranges, and an opponent must be within range for the attack option to be available to the player. Also important for attacking is the direction the opponent is facing and whether or not they are on elevated ground. When attacked from the side and from behind, Gladiators will take significantly more damage than when attacked from the front and will have no chance to block the attack. Gladiators on elevated ground receive less damage from those below them, whilst also causing more damage.
After issuing an attack order, the game presents the player with a &quot;hit meter&quot; that is used to determine the accuracy and effectiveness of the attack by having the player press a button or sequence of buttons at a particular time. All meters can be disabled in the options menu, with the game automatically and randomly determining the strength of attacks.

As well as a basic attack, each gladiator has access to certain skills. These skills are either active (the gladiator must be ordered to use them) or innate (they are activated automatically). As gladiators fight, they gain experience points, which eventually allows them to level up. When they do, they receive a number of &quot;Job Points&quot;, which the player can use to purchase and/or upgrade skills. The available skills are different for each class of gladiator, and all skills are broken down into categories; attack, affinity (magic-infused attacks), combo, innate, and special (stat boosting, prompting crowd involvement, increasing initiative, etc.). To use active skills during combat, the gladiator must have sufficient skill points, which are built up at the rate of one per turn.

Affinity attacks are special attacks imbued with one of the game&#x27;s six magic elements; earth, water, fire, wind, light, and dark. Each affinity attack requires a certain amount of affinity power before it can be used. The player can charge the gladiator&#x27;s affinity power simply by attacking the enemy with a weapon imbued with that affinity. Once they have enough power, the player can then order an affinity attack. Armor and defensive equipment can also be imbued with an affinity. In this case, if a gladiator is attacked with a weapon imbued with the same affinity as their armor, they will receive very little damage.

There are several different types of combat in the game. The basic match type is to defeat all of the opponents. Other match types include timed combat where the team who scores the most hit points will win, timed combat where the team who break the most barrels will win, timed King of the Hill combat where the objective is to occupy the highest point in the arena and hold onto it for as long as possible, and combat where the first team to destroy the opposing team&#x27;s statue will win. Different battles also have different restrictions; some battles will limit the player to using only gladiators of a particular class, affinity, or gender, meaning the player must build up a diverse school of different types of gladiators.

===World map===
There are four regions in the game. Depending on whether the player character is Valens or Ursula, the game begins in either Imperia and then moves to Nordagh (Valens), or Nordagh and then moves to Imperia (Ursula). Upon completion of these two regions, the game moves onto the Windward Steppes (grasslands region), followed by the Southern Expanse (desert region), before then returning to Imperia.

Within each region, there are multiple towns, each of which has an arena. Each arena hosts several leagues, and each league hosts several battles. The player must win enough battles to win the league, and enough leagues to compete in the town&#x27;s tournament. Once all the town tournaments have been completed, a regional tournament becomes available. The player must win the regional tournament to be able to move on to the next region. 

Travel between the towns takes place on the world map, with the player free to visit any town in the region. As well as facilitating travel, the world map also features merchants who sell items not available in the regular shops, and NPCs to whom the player can speak, possibly getting side quests, hints, or local history. As in traditional RPGs, the world map features random combat encounters. Unlike in the arenas, however, if a gladiator is killed in a random encounter, they are permanently removed from the player&#x27;s school. If the player character is defeated, it is game over and the player must reload from the last save.

The menu system is available within each town and is where the player selects the league in which to compete, accesses the shop, recruits gladiators to their school, and learns the background of the town. Players can also examine their gladiatorial school via submenus that allow them to read journals, equip their gladiators, customise each gladiator&#x27;s appearance, examine their gladiators&#x27; stats, access a &quot;rogues gallery&quot; of defeated enemies, check to see what leagues the school has won, access a Q&amp;A about the game, expel gladiators from their school, and spend job points to upgrade their gladiators&#x27; skills.

===Multiplayer===
There are two multiplayer modes. Co-op allows up to four players (two on PlayStation 2) to play side-by-side in story mode. The first player controls the movement on the world map and the menu screens. Once that player has entered a battle, the other player(s) can control the gladiators of their choice. The other multiplayer mode is Versus, where up to four players (two on PlayStation 2) can compete in exhibition battles. This mode only becomes available when the player has reached Chapter II in the single-player game.

==Plot==
&quot;Gladius&quot; features two separate storylines, one each for the two available player characters; Valens and Ursula. Unlike in many games with multiple player characters, the two campaigns in &quot;Gladius&quot; do not present different perspectives on the same story. Although some of the plot points are the same in each storyline, they are, in fact, two entirely independent plots, the details of which do not coalesce.

===Background===
The game takes place in the fictional lands of Gladius where, decades earlier, only the barbarians of Nordagh stood against the marauding Empire of Imperia. The ensuing conflict, known as the Great War, was vicious and bitter, and although it quickly reached a military stalemate, the slaughter senselessly continued. So pronounced was the violence that it led to the rebirth of the Dark God, Mortuus, a dragon-like entity who began to lay waste to both armies. In response, the benevolent Affinity Gods lent their strength to Galltyr, Queen of the Valkyrie, and with her Warriors of Light, she attacked Mortuus. Although the Valkyrie were all but wiped out, they succeeded in defeating him.

The few human survivors vowed never to allow something like this to happen again, and Imperia withdrew from Nordagh, with a temple built over the body of Mortuus, sealing in his evil. The two kingdoms then negotiated a return of the non-lethal gladiator games of old, hoping that this would be where society&#x27;s lust for violence could be channeled. Schools of gladiators from all over Gladius were soon vying to win regional tournaments in the hope of competing in the High Tournament in Imperia.

===Valens===
As the game begins, Valens and his father, Munio (regarded as the greatest living gladiator), are returning from the amphitheatre when they are attacked by a group of men. Munio is killed, but Valens survives. Several weeks later, Valens takes over Munio&#x27;s gladiatorial school, joined by his closest friend, Ludo, whom Munio had raised alongside Valens after the death of Ludo&#x27;s father. Valens is also accompanied by Munio&#x27;s most trusted advisor, Usus, who gives Valens Munio&#x27;s amulet, telling him it is a symbol of Munio&#x27;s love for the games.

Upon winning their first battle, Valens and Ludo are approached by two Channelers of the High Sept, who speak of their respect for Munio. As they depart, one notes, &quot;he was wearing the amulet. I hope he understands the responsibility that comes with it.&quot; Shortly thereafter, they encounter the belligerent Imperial general, Mutuus. He offers Valens and Ludo a place in his school, but they reject him, with Usus explaining that he fought alongside Mutuus in the Great War, but after the defeat of Mortuus, Mutuus wanted Imperia to attack the weakened Nordagh, but Munio refused.

Upon winning the Imperial regional championship, the school heads to Roanor in Nordagh, the location of Mortuus&#x27;s body, where they learn the temple has been broken into and Mortuus&#x27;s heart stolen. They then encounter Ursula and Urlan, children of Nordagh&#x27;s King Orin II. Helping the siblings escape an ambush, Ursula invites them to meet Orin. In Orin&#x27;s court, Valens suggests that Ursula and Urlan join the school, and Orin agrees, much to Ursula&#x27;s delight, and Ludo&#x27;s chagrin. Thereafter, Ludo starts to become increasingly xenophobic, resentful of any non-Imperials who join the school.

Eventually, the increasingly antagonistic Ludo leaves the school, accusing Valens of lacking ambition and disgracing Munio&#x27;s legacy. Meanwhile, the heart of the Dark God is brought by the thieves, led by Mutuus, to the summoner Nyphelia, who imbues Mutuus and his men with the power of darkness, creating the Dark Legion.

Having won all of the regional championships, the school competes in the High Tournament, emerging victorious. However, upon their victory, a massive stone gladiator statue comes alive, killing the Emperor. The gladiators and spectators flee, all except Mutuus, who slays the giant. Hailing him as a hero and calling for him to lead them, the people are unaware this is part of Nyphelia&#x27;s plan to resurrect Mortuus. Valens and his school head to the High Sept for advice. There, they learn that Munio was chosen to be humanity&#x27;s champion should Mortuus ever be reborn. That responsibility has now fallen to Valens. However, he cannot stand alone. The only way to defeat Mortuus is for Valens to combine his powers with those of Ursula, with whom he has fallen in love, and who is revealed to be a descendant of the Valkyrie.

As the Dark Legion march north, laying waste to everything in their path, the school confronts Mutuus. Bragging that it was he who killed Munio, they incapacitate him, but Nyphelia appears and kills him. Mortuus is then reborn from Mutuus&#x27;s body. The school battles the dragon, with Ursula sacrificing herself to strike a mortal blow. A smiling Nyphelia then disappears from the battlefield as Ursula&#x27;s spirit floats into the air. Before she leaves, she bids farewell to Valens, who tearfully tells her he loves her.

In an undisclosed location, Nyphelia receives a report telling her that despite the setback in Roanor, Nordagh has fallen, and &quot;soon all nations shall tremble as our army marches across the land.&quot; Nyphelia then imbues one of her legionnaires with the same power of darkness she used on Mutuus. That legionnaire is Ludo.

===Ursula===
In Nordagh, twenty years before the game begins, the Galdr witches, prophesize that Mortuus will return with the aid of a young girl. They come to believe this girl is King Orin II&#x27;s unborn child. When Orin&#x27;s wife gives birth to a boy, it seemingly disproves the Galdr, but she then secretly gives birth to a girl. Orin hides the children (Urlan and Ursula), and they grow up in seclusion, with the Galdr unaware of them. Urlan grows to become an accomplished gladiator, whilst Ursula yearns to explore. As he prepares to lead a school to the regional games, he agrees that if she can beat him in combat, she can accompany him. She does so, but only after using a magical ability, the origin of which is a mystery to both her family and herself.

Joined by Orin&#x27;s most trusted advisor, Usus, the school begins competing. Upon winning their first tournament, they head to Roanor, location of Mortuus&#x27;s body, where they learn the temple has been broken into and Mortuus&#x27;s heart stolen. Continuing to win tournaments, they then travel to Imperia, where they encounter the belligerent general, Mutuus. Usus explains that he fought alongside Mutuus in the Great War, but after the defeat of Mortuus, Mutuus wanted Imperia to attack the weakened Nordagh, but the Emperor refused. Meanwhile, Ursula encounters a young man from Imperia called Valens. He inherited his father&#x27;s school, but it has fallen apart, with even his childhood friend, Ludo, abandoning him. Shortly thereafter, Valens joins Urlan&#x27;s school.

Meanwhile, the heart of the Dark God is brought by the thieves, led by Mutuus, to the summoner Nyphelia, who imbues Mutuus and his men with the power of darkness, creating the Dark Legion. Having won all of the regional championships, the school competes in the High Tournament, emerging victorious. However, upon their victory, a massive stone gladiator statue comes alive, killing the Emperor. The gladiators and spectators flee, all except Mutuus, who slays the giant. Hailing him as a hero and calling for him to lead them, the people are unaware this is part of Nyphelia&#x27;s plan to resurrect Mortuus. Ursula and the school head to Nordagh to warn Orin.

As the Dark Legion march north, laying waste to everything in their path, Nyphelia mortally wounds Orin. When Ursula and the others arrive, Nyphelia says they can do nothing to stop Mortuus&#x27;s rebirth. With his dying words, Orin tells Ursula about the Galdr prophecy, urging her to seek their advice. They meet with the High Priestess, who states, &quot;sisters, we have read the prophecy wrong; she does not only bring about the coming darkness. She is also the one to stop it.&quot; She then tells Ursula, &quot;you are the last of the Valkyrie, the last spark of the light affinity in this world, the only one who can keep us from plunging into total darkness.&quot;

At Roanor, they confront Mutuus. They incapacitate him, but Nyphelia appears and kills him. Mortuus is then reborn from Mutuus&#x27;s body. The school battles the dragon, with Ursula sacrificing herself to strike a mortal blow. A smiling Nyphelia then disappears from the battlefield as Ursula&#x27;s spirit floats into the air. Before she leaves, she bids farewell to Valens, who tearfully tells her he loves her.

In an undisclosed location, Nyphelia receives a report telling her that despite the setback in Roanor, Nordagh has fallen, and &quot;soon all nations shall tremble as our army marches across the land.&quot; Nyphelia then imbues one of her legionnaires with the same power of darkness she used on Mutuus. That legionnaire is Valens&#x27;s childhood friend, Ludo.

==Development==
&quot;Gladius&quot; was first announced in May 2002, slated for a Spring 2003 release. At this point, the game had already been in development for 18 months. The press release emphasised the two storylines, the mixture of single-player and multiplayer modes, and the core game mechanic of building up and managing a gladiatorial school. LucasArts estimated that it would take around 72 hours to complete both storylines, emphasising the size of the game&#x27;s four distinct regions. They also cited the game&#x27;s 16 character classes, 100+ character types, 200+ skills, and 400+ pieces of equipment. According to Sam Saliba, product marketing manager for LucasArts;

The game was first shown at E3 2002, with a playable demo of a 40% complete build of the Xbox version.

Speaking to &quot;GameSpot&quot; in September 2002, the game&#x27;s director and co-writer, Robert Blackadder, explained why LucasArts had decided to make a gladiatorial game; &quot;as a company we are trying to build our own brands outside of the standard licensed material. The high concept of &quot;Gladius&quot; struck a chord with people, and we&#x27;ve been running with it ever since.&quot; In terms of influence, Blackadder cited &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot;, &quot;Vagrant Story&quot;, &quot;Madden NFL 2002&quot;, &quot;Mario Party&quot;, and &quot;lots of RPGs.&quot;

Originally, the concept for the game had been much smaller than it ultimately became. As the world of the game continued to expand, the developers decided to create a second player character and split the story between them. The designers also elected to try to introduce &quot;a new twist in the RPG genre&quot;, thus pushing the concept even further. According to Q&amp;A lead, Chuck McFadden, the team constantly sought to push things; &quot;[we] wanted to take this game genre farther than anyone else has. Is one console enough? Not a chance! Put this game on all three next-gen consoles at the same time! Is one main hero enough? Nope. We&#x27;ll have two! Is one land in peril enough? Heck no! We&#x27;ll have no less than four! Is 600 battles too many?&quot; The game&#x27;s world, weaponry, and human character classes are based on the real world of the 3rd to 6th centuries, with the base classes being Secutors, Samnites, Legionnaires and Peltasts. The game also features fantastical elements, such as gods and magic, and additional non-human classes such as Valkyrie, yetis, undead, satyrs, cyclopes, ogres, and minotaurs.

The game&#x27;s engine was developed in-house by LucasArts and was built with the foreknowledge that the game would be released on multiple platforms. To that end, there were individual programmers working specifically on each version with their primary role being to ensure that the game takes advantage of each platform&#x27;s architecture, all while maintaining a constant 60-frames-per-second frame rate across all three consoles. According to Blackadder, &quot;we have a separate programmer heading platform-specific work. We are looking at taking advantage of different material modes and lighting effects available to each [platform].&quot; In terms of the game being multi-platform, he said, &quot;I see it as standard procedure going forward. For me it&#x27;s meant focusing more on the game and not what machine it will be on.&quot;

==Reception==
&quot;Gladius&quot; received &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot; across all three platforms; the PlayStation 2 version holds an aggregate score of 78 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 27 reviews; the Xbox version holds a score of 79 out of 100 from 31 reviews; and the GameCube version holds a score of 82 out of 100 from 13 reviews.

&quot;Game Informer&quot;″s Matthew Kato scored the GameCube version 9 out of 10 and was especially impressed with the depth of the combat mechanics, particularly lauding the implementation of the hit meters. He concluded, &quot;&quot;Gladius&quot; is the convergence of a lot of successful elements working in tandem.&quot; Also writing for &quot;Game Informer&quot;, Andrew Reiner scored the PlayStation 2 version 9 out of 10, calling it &quot;a compelling and ingenious romp.&quot; He especially praised the use of hit meters and the depth of character customisation, concluding, &quot;it has all of the makings of a bona fide classic.&quot; Jeremy Zoss scored the Xbox version 9.3 out of 10, also praising the range of customisation, the depth of the combat mechanics, and, especially, the hit meters.

&quot;GameSpy&quot;″s Zach Meston scored all three versions 4.5 out of 5, calling it one of LucasArts&#x27; best games, and praising the developers &quot;for having [...] the skill to deliver a game that competes with the best in the genre.&quot; Although he found the pace &quot;sluggish&quot;, and the graphics under-par, he praised the simplicity of the gameplay, the implementation of hit meters, and the depth of customisation, calling it &quot;one of the deepest games of the year.&quot; &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; scored the GameCube version an average of 4.3 out of 5. Steven Grimm scored it 4.5 out of 5, calling it &quot;a must-own.&quot; Scott Pelland scored it 4, finding it to be &quot;an excellent strategy RPG.&quot; George Sinfield scored it 4.5, calling it &quot;an involving experience.&quot; Alan Averill, scored it 4, seeing it as &quot;an ambitious title that ultimately falls victim to repetitiveness.&quot;

&quot;GameSpot&quot;″s Greg Kasavin scored all three versions 8.4 out of 10, writing &quot;&quot;Gladius&quot; [is] not just a great game but, in certain ways, a pioneering one.&quot; He praised the depth of combat, the range of equipment, the use of affinity points, and, especially, the hit meters. On the other hand, he found the story insubstantial. He concluded, &quot;at the heart of this game is an interesting and well-thought-out combat system.&quot; &quot;IGN&quot;″s Mary Jane Irwin scored the PlayStation 2 version 8 out of 10, the GameCube version 8.1 out of 10, and the Xbox version 8.3 out of 10, citing &quot;an odd clashing of ideas that works surprisingly well.&quot; She was impressed with the hit meters, but she found the AI &quot;unbalanced&quot;, and was critical of the story. Whilst she praised the graphics in the cutscenes (&quot;facial animations are simply amazing&quot;), she was critical of the in-game graphics (&quot;hands and feet are blocky and claw looking, and clothes and skin textures aren&#x27;t clearly defined&quot;). She concluded, &quot;&quot;Gladius&quot; [...] has plucked elements from several strategy games and patched them together into something that feels fresh.&quot;

&quot;Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine&quot;″s Chris Baker scored the PlayStation 2 version 4 out of 5, praising the range of moves, the locations, the hit meters, and &quot;the sheer depth of the game.&quot; Writing for &quot;&quot;, Ryan McCaffrey scored it 8 out of 10. He was critical of the plot and some of the graphics, but felt &quot;there&#x27;s a lot to love&quot;, arguing &quot;its shortcomings are minor [and] weaknesses are swept away by the sheer size and depth.&quot; &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; scored the GameCube version an average of 7.2 out of 10. Joe Fielder scored it 6 out of 10, praising the characters and storyline, but was critical of the pacing; &quot;if the number of battles were cut by at least a third and its combat speed doubled, the game could be on track for star status.&quot; Greg Stewart, on the other hand, scored it 8.5, praising the combat mechanics and depth of customisation. Greg Orlando scored it 8, criticising it for being too long, but praising the customisation and range of weaponry.

In 2007, &quot;Official Xbox Magazine&quot; included the game in their &quot;best Xbox games most people never played&quot; list.

<text>The South Australia men&#x27;s cricket team is an Australian men&#x27;s professional first-class cricket team based in Adelaide, South Australia. South Australia play their home matches at Adelaide Oval and Karen Rolton Oval, they are the state cricket team for South Australia representing the state in the Sheffield Shield competition and the limited overs Marsh One-Day Cup. The team is selected and supported by the South Australian Cricket Association (SACA). Their Marsh One-Day Cup uniform features a red body with black sleeves. They were known as the Southern Redbacks from 1995 to 2024, and officially competed under the West End Redbacks moniker from 1996 to 2024 due to a sponsorship agreement with West End. The Redbacks formerly competed in the now-defunct KFC Twenty20 Big Bash, but were succeeded by the Adelaide Strikers in 2011 because this league was replaced with the Big Bash League.

==History==
The earliest known first-class match played by South Australia took place against Tasmania on the Adelaide Oval in November 1877. In 1892–93, they joined New South Wales and Victoria and played the inaugural Sheffield Shield season. South Australia won the Shield in just their second attempt. They have won the competition 13 times in total while they have twice won the One Day tournament now known as the Ryobi One Day Cup. They are also the current holders of the KFC 20/20 Big Bash trophy, defeating NSW in the 2010/11 final at Adelaide Oval. They will continue to hold the KFC Twenty20 Big Bash trophy, as the league is now defunct and has been replaced by the Big Bash League.

Over the years, many successful international cricketers have played for South Australia. Clarrie Grimmett played with them during the 1920s and &#x27;30s, taking a total of 668 wickets. This remains a state record. In 1934, Sir Donald Bradman moved to South Australia and joined the team after originally playing with New South Wales, and he started with scores of 117, 233 and 357 in his first three innings. Others include the Chappell brothers (Ian and Greg), David Hookes, Darren Lehmann, Gil Langley, Jason Gillespie, and Terry Jenner.

South Australia has also imported cricketers to play for them, with the most famous being Sir Gary Sobers, who appeared in three seasons during the early 1960s, and Barry Richards. Richards played just one season with South Australia but managed to set a state record for most runs in a season, making 1101 runs in the 1970–71 season.

<text>The Aérospatiale (formerly Sud Aviation) SA 321 Super Frelon (&quot;Super Hornet&quot;) is a three-engined heavy transport helicopter produced by aerospace manufacturer Sud Aviation of France. It held the distinction of being the most powerful helicopter to be built in Europe at one point, as well as being the world&#x27;s fastest helicopter.

The Super Frelon was a more powerful development of the original SE.3200 Frelon, which had failed to enter production. On 7 December 1962, the first prototype conducted the type&#x27;s maiden flight. On 23 July 1963, a modified Super Frelon flew a record-breaking flight, setting the new FAI absolute helicopter world speed record with a recorded speed of . Both civilian and military versions of the Super Frelon were produced; the type was predominantly sold to military customers. In 1981, Aerospatiale, Sud Aviation&#x27;s successor company, chose to terminate production due to a lack of orders.

The Super Frelon was most heavily used by naval air arms, such as the French Naval Aviation and the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Naval Air Force. On 30 April 2010, the type was retired by the French Navy, having been replaced by a pair of Eurocopter EC225 helicopters as a stopgap measure pending the availability of the NHIndustries NH90 helicopter. The Super Frelon was in use for an extended period within China, where it was manufactured under license and sold by the Harbin Aircraft Industry Group as the Harbin Z-8. A modernised derivative of the Z-8, marketed as the Avicopter AC313, performed its first flight on 18 March 2010.

==Development==
===Background===
The SA.3210 Super Frelon was developed by French aerospace company Sud Aviation from the original SE.3200 Frelon. During the type&#x27;s development, Sud Aviation had risen to prominence as a major helicopter manufacturer, having exported more rotorcraft than any other European rival. Having produced the popular Aérospatiale Alouette II and Aérospatiale Alouette III, the firm was keen to establish a range of helicopters fulfilling various roles, functions, and size requirements; two of the larger models in development by the early 1960s were the Super Frelon and what would become the Aérospatiale SA 330 Puma. The Super Frelon was the largest helicopter in development by the firm, being substantially increased over the earlier Frelon, and was considered to be an ambitious design at the time.

The earlier Frelon had been developed to meet the requirements of both the French Navy and the German Navy, which both had released details on its anticipated demands for a heavy helicopter; however, these requirements were revised upwards by the customer, leading to the redesign and emergence of the Super Frelon. Changes included the adoption of much more powerful engines, using three Turbomeca Turmo IIIC turboshaft engines, each capable of generating on the prototypes (later uprated to on production models) in place of the Frelon&#x27;s Turbomeca Turmo IIIB engines; these drove a six-bladed main rotor, instead of the Frelon&#x27;s four-bladed one, and a five-bladed (instead of four-bladed) tail rotor. Overall, the modified design provided for a greatly increased gross weight, from , whilst improving the rotorcraft&#x27;s aerodynamic efficiency and handling qualities.

Additional external changes between the Frelon and Super Frelon had been made, such as the original stubby tail boom having been replaced by a more conventional one, albeit with a crank in it to raise the tail rotor clear of vehicles approaching the rear loading ramp. Taking note of American experiments with amphibious helicopters, the Super Frelon&#x27;s fuselage was redesigned into a hull, featuring a bow, planing bottom and watertight bilge compartments. Various foreign manufacturers participated in the development and manufacturing of the type; American helicopter company Sikorsky was contracted to supply the design of a new six-bladed main rotor and five-bladed tail rotor, while Italian manufacturer Fiat supplied the design for a new main transmission.

===Into flight===
On 7 December 1962, the first prototype Super Frelon conducted the type&#x27;s maiden flight. On 28 May 1963, it was followed by the second prototype. The first prototype was tailored towards meeting the needs of the French Air Force, while the second was fully navalised, including lateral stabilising floats fixed to the undercarriage. On 23 July 1963, a modified prototype Super Frelon helicopter was used to break the FAI absolute helicopter world speed record, having attained a maximum speed of during the flight. Flown by Jean Boulet and Roland Coffignot, a total of three international records were broken, these being: speed over 3 km at low altitude,
; speed at any altitude over 15 and 25 km, ; and 100km closed circuit .

By April 1964, the two prototypes had accumulated 388 flying hours, which included 30 hours of seaworthiness trials performed with the second prototype. In January 1964, the third Super Frelon prototype made its first flight, the fourth first flew during May 1964, and a pair of pre-production models were completed during the latter half of 1964. The third prototype participated in a series of accelerated wear trials to establish component endurance and overhaul lifespan, while the fourth prototype was assigned to further tests of equipment for the naval environment. 

By July 1964, the French Government had placed an initial order for the Super Frelon, intended to perform logistic support duties at the Centre Experimental du Pacifique; negotiations for a further order was already being negotiated for the naval version, which were to be equipped for anti-submarine duties. However, West German support for the Super Frelon programme had already declined by this point, partially due to interest in the rival Sikorsky SH-3 Sea King, which was evaluated against the type.

Both civilian and military versions of the Super Frelon were built, with the military variants being the most numerous by far, entering service with the French military as well as being exported to Israel, South Africa, Libya, China and Iraq. Three military variants were produced: military transport, anti-submarine and anti-ship. The transport version is able to carry 38 equipped troops, or alternatively 15 stretchers for casualty evacuation tasks.

==Design==

The Aérospatiale SA 321 Super Frelon is a large, heavy-lift single-rotor helicopter, furnished with a relatively atypical three-engine configuration; these are Turboméca Turmo IIIC turboshaft engines set on top of the fuselage, a pair of turbines positioned side by side at the front and one located aft of the main rotor. The naval anti-submarine and anti-ship variants are usually equipped with navigation and search radar (ORB-42), and a 50-metre rescue cable. They are most often fitted with a 20 mm cannon, countermeasures, night vision, a laser designator and a Personal Locator System. The Super Frelon can also be fitted for inflight refueling.

The front engines have simple individual ram intakes, while the rear one is fitted with a semi-circular scoop to provide air; all three bifurcated exhausts are near to the rotor head. The three engines and the reduction gearbox are mounted on a horizontal bulkhead and firewall which forms the roof of the cabin and upper structural member of the fuselage. The engines are isolated by multiple firewalls, including transverse firewalls separating front and rear engines from the rotor gearbox, and zonal engine firewalls. Eight sturdy hinged doors provide access to the compact Turmo engines, which have ample space around them to enable ground crew to service them without using external platforms.

The fuselage is actually a hull, which makes use of a semi-monocoque light alloy construction; according to aerospace publication Flight International, the hull design was &quot;reminiscent of flying-boat engineering&quot;. The main cabin lacks any transverse bracing, except for a single bulkhead between the cockpit and cabin. Substantial built-up frames connect the strengthened roof structure with the floor/planing-bottom of transverse under-floor bulkheads and outer skin. A conventional exterior skin is used, employing longitudinal stiffeners as well as two lines of deep channel members, while the under-floor cross members are reinforced with vertical stiffeners. There is no keel, at the floor level there are horizontal members between frames which are stiffened by transverse shear angles. Flexible fuel cells are stored in four watertight under-floor compartments lying fore and aft of the rotor axis, while the floor itself is fitted with removable panels. A hatch set into the floor, positioned approximately underneath the rotor axis, is used for sling-load operations.

At the rear of the cabin is a tapered section of simple semi-monocoque construction, which is closed by a robust hinged rear loading ramp, which serves as the main entrance for bulky loads or equipment. The loading ramp is jettisonable in emergency situations. Additionally, there is a sliding door located on the forward starboard side, while a small hinged emergency door is set on the aft port side. The tail boom uses conventional semi-monocoque construction, supported by closely spaced notched channel-section frames and continuous stringers, absent of any major longitudinal sections or longerons. The cranked section carrying the tail rotor and trim plane is more robust, strengthened by a solid-web spar, frames, and stiffeners. The juncture of the main boom and cranked section is hinged in order to reduce the rotorcraft&#x27;s folded length to . Along the top of the boom, the shaft for the tail rotor is covered by a fairing.

The fixed landing gear has twin wheels on each of the three vertical shock absorber-equipped struts. The main leading gear units are mounted on triangulated tubular structures, while the nose gear is bracketed to the cockpit bulkhead via a watertight seal in the planing bottom. The main wheels have hydraulic brakes operated from the pedals, complete with a parking hand brake, while the nose unit is fully castoring. The nose, which is covered by large glazed panels, has a bow chine and planing bottom built as a unit with the flight deck, which is higher than the main cabin floor.

==Operational history==

===China===
From December 1975 to April 1977, China took delivery of a batch of 12 SA 321 Super Frelon navalised helicopters. These helicopters came in two variants: anti-submarine warfare (ASW) and search and rescue (SAR) versions. The Super Frelon was the first helicopter of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA) to be capable of operating from the flight deck of surface vessels. 

China has also manufactured a number of Super Frelons locally, where it is known under the designation &quot;Z-8&quot; (land-or-ship based ASW/SAR helicopter). The Super Frelon remains operational with the PLA Navy as of 2014.

Since the early 1980s, the Super Frelons have been frequently used by the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) for conducting shipborne ASW and SAR operations. For ASW missions, the Z-8 is equipped with surface search radar and a French HS-12 dipping sonar while carrying a Whitehead A244S torpedo under the starboard side of the fuselage. The rotorcraft were also used to ferry supplies from replenishment ship to surface combatants, and transport marines from the landing ship to the shore. 

A naval SAR version, designated as the &quot;Z-8S&quot;, was outfitted with upgraded avionics, a searchlight, FLIR turret and a hoist, made its first flight in December 2004. Another rescue variant, furnished with dedicated medivac equipment on board, was also developed for the Navy, designated as the &quot;Z-8JH&quot;.

The &quot;Z-8A&quot; version was developed as an army transport variant and received certification in February 1999. In 2001, a pair of Z-8As were delivered to the Army for evaluation, however, it ultimately decided to procure additional Mi-17V5s instead. Only a single batch of about six Z-8A were delivered to the Army in November 2002; these still retained the nose weather radar and side floats. Starting in 2007, the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) also acquired dozens of upgraded &quot;Z-8K&quot;s and &quot;Z-8KA&quot;s for conducting SAR missions; these were equipped with a FLIR turret and a searchlight underneath the cabin, plus a hoist and a flare dispenser.

China has also developed a domestic civil helicopter variant of the Z-8, which is marketed as the Avicopter AC313. The AC313 has a maximum takeoff weight of 13.8 tonnes, is capable of carrying up to 27 passengers, and has a maximum range of 900 km (559 miles).

After the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, Z-8 helicopter production received a massive boost as the event had proved the helicopter&#x27;s value in humanitarian missions. New engine acquisition and design changes were implemented in order to iron out some of known existing issues which had affected the Z-8 for decades. The Chinese People&#x27;s Armed Police ordered 18 Z-8 helicopters; by 2013, at least five helicopters had been delivered, the majority of these having been assigned to forestry fire fighting units. During subsequent earthquake relief operations, Z-8 helicopters have been deployed to perform rescue and logistical missions.

In 2018, the PLA Army Aviation announced that it would begin phasing out its fleet of Z-8 helicopters due to low performance and high maintenance requirements, even though some examples have only been in service for 6 years, the Z-8s will likely to be replaced by the Harbin Z-20 medium lift helicopter.

===France===
In October 1965, the SA 321G ASW helicopter joined the French Naval Aviation (&quot;Aeronavale&quot;). Apart from ship-based ASW missions, the SA321G also carried out sanitisation patrols in support of &quot;Redoutable&quot;-class ballistic missile submarines. Some aircraft were modified with nose-mounted targeting radar for &#x27;Exocet&#x27; anti-ship missiles. Five SA321GA freighters, originally used in support of the Pacific nuclear test centre, were transferred to assault support duties.

In 2003, the surviving Aeronavale Super Frelons were assigned to transport duties, including commando transport, VertRep and SAR.

The SA321G Super Frelon served with &quot;Flotille 32F&quot; of the French &quot;Aviation navale&quot;, operating from Lanvéoc-Poulmic in Brittany in the Search and Rescue role. They were retired on 30 April 2010, replaced by two Eurocopter EC225 helicopters purchased as stop-gaps until the NHIndustries NH90 came into service in 2011–12.

===Iraq===
Starting in 1977, a total of 16 Super Frelons were delivered to the Iraqi Air Force; equipped with radar and Exocet missiles, the Iraqi models were designated as the &quot;SA 321H&quot;. These rotorcraft were deployed in the lengthy Iran–Iraq War and during the 1991 Gulf War, in which at least one example was destroyed.

During the Iran–Iraq War, Iraq started using Super Frelon and its other newly purchased Exocet-equipped fighters to target Iranian shipping in Persian Gulf in an event now known as the Tanker War. Two of the Iraqi Super Frelons were downed by Iranian fighters, one by a long-range shot of AIM-54A Phoenix by an F-14 Tomcat (during Operation Pearl) while under way over Persian Gulf, and one by an AGM-65A Maverick fired from an Iranian F-4 Phantom in July 1986, while attempting to take off from an oil rig.

===Israel===
Israel placed an order for six &quot;SA 321K&quot; Super Frelons in 1965 to equip the Israeli Air Force with a heavy lift transport capability. The first of these helicopters arrived on 20 April 1966, enabling the inauguration of 114 Squadron, which operated the type out of Tel Nof. An additional six Super Frelons were ordered during the following year. 

The Israeli military had initially hoped to use the Super Frelons for deploying Panhard AML-90 light armoured cars in support of airborne operations, but this concept was dropped when tests revealed the helicopter was incapable of handling the vehicle&#x27;s combat weight. A total of four helicopters had arrived by the start of the 1967 Six-Day War, during which they flew 41 sorties. Israeli Super Frelons saw extensive service during the War of Attrition, participating in operations such as &quot;Helem&quot;, &quot;Tarnegol 53&quot; and &quot;Rhodes&quot;.

The type was once again in service during the Yom Kippur War, following which Israel replaced the original Turbomeca Turmo engines with the General Electric T58-GE-T5D engine. The Super Frelons also took part in the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in June 1982. Due to their relatively high maintenance cost and poor performance capabilities compared to the IAF CH-53s, they were eventually retired in 1991.

===Libya===
In 1980–1981, six radar-equipped SA 321GM helicopters and eight SA 321M SAR/transports were delivered to Libya.

===South Africa===
South Africa ordered sixteen SA 321L helicopters in 1965, which were delivered by 1967 and assigned to 15 Squadron of the South African Air Force (SAAF). At least two were deployed to Mozambique in support of Rhodesian military operations against insurgents of the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army between 1978 and 1979. Others were mobilised for evacuating South African paratroops from Angola during Operation Reindeer. 

In August 1978, the South West African People&#x27;s Organization sparked a major border incident between South Africa and Zambia when its guerrillas fired on an SAAF Super Frelon landing at Katima Mulilo from Zambian soil. The South Africans retaliated with an artillery strike, which struck a Zambian Army position.

===Syria===

In October 1975, it was widely reported that Syria had ordered fifteen unspecified Super Frelons from France as part of an arms deal funded by Saudi Arabia. While the Syrian Air Force did issue a requirement for fifteen of the specific aircraft, and recommended purchasing up to fifty, by 1984 the sale had still not materialized.

<text>JODX-DTV (channel 8), branded as or , is the Kansai region key station of the Fuji News Network (FNN) and Fuji Network System (FNS), owned-and-operated by the . Its studios and headquarters are located in Osaka and the broadcaster is an affiliate company of the Hankyu Hanshin Holdings Group, part of the wider Hankyu Hanshin Toho Group.

==History==
In 1952, when the Ministry of Posts announced the first channel plan for Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya, &quot;TV Osaka&quot; (テレビ大阪, unrelated to the current Television Osaka) initiated by the Sankei Shimbun, as well as Kyoto Broadcasting and Kobe Broadcasting, applied for a TV license in the Osaka area. However, the TV license in the Osaka area was later obtained by Osaka TV Broadcasting, a joint operation of Asahi Broadcasting and New Japan Broadcasting (now Mainichi Broadcasting). Afterwards, when the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications released a new channel frequency plan again, the Sankei Shimbun and Hankyu Electric Railway applied for a TV license in the name of &quot;Kansai TV Broadcasting&quot; (Japanese: 関西テレビ放送) to apply for a TV license in its name. The two were integrated into &quot;Dai Kansai TV Broadcasting&quot; (大関西テレビ放送) in June 1957, and obtained a TV license on July 8 of the same year. On February 1, 1958, the Great Kansai TV Broadcasting Formally established, and changed the company name to &quot;Kansai Telecasting Corporation&quot; in July of the same year. With the completion of the signal launch station in September 1958 and the completion of the headquarters building in October, the conditions for Kansai TV to start broadcasting were ripe.

At 16:30 on November 22, 1958, Kansai TV Station officially started broadcasting. The first program broadcast was &quot;This is Commercial&quot; (これがコマーシャルだ) which lasted for one and a half hours, introducing the general situation of Kansai TV and the information from East and West House. The History of Advertising From Beginning to Broadcast TV Advertising. On the evening of the first day of the broadcast, the commemorative performance held at the Umeda Theater, as well as movies and news programs were broadcast. At the beginning of the broadcast, since Kansai TV did not join any network, 95% of Kansai TV&#x27;s programs were self-made except for news. It was not until Tokai TV in December of the same year and Fuji TV and Kyushu Asahi Broadcasting in March of the following year that Kansai TV had the support of a network, and was able to reduce the number of self-produced programs to save costs, and the proportion of self-produced programs was also reduced to about 40%. Kansai TV also participated in the 1959 broadcast of the wedding of the crown prince (the current emperor) Akihito and Michiko Masada. This wedding also became a major opportunity for the popularization of television in Japanese households[8]:14. Kansai TV also achieved the first program broadcast from the seabed in the Japanese private TV industry in this year, and won the People&#x27;s Congress Award for this. were broadcast. At the beginning of the broadcast, since Kansai TV did not join any network, 95% of Kansai TV&#x27;s programs were self-made except for news.

Because Hankyu Electric Railway was one of the main shareholders of Kansai TV Station, the Hosei Opera became an important program resource of Kansai TV Station in the early days. In 1961, the average audience rating of Kansai TV Station during the prime time reached 16.3%, and it was the first time it was rated first place in the Kansai area. With the rapid development of Japan&#x27;s economy, TV advertising expenses also increased rapidly, and Kansai TV&#x27;s advertising revenue also increased rapidly. In 1959, Kansai Television Station turned losses into profits the following year, and in 1967, it achieved zero debts. In October 1968, it was the first to rank first in the operating income of Osaka&#x27;s four private four stations. The program production capacity of Kansai TV Station also improved simultaneously during this period. The finale of the TV series &quot;Udon&quot; (うどん) aired in 1967 set a record of 49.3% ratings, which is the only broadcast on Kansai TV to achieve the record for highest ratings so far except for sports events. In September 1964, Kansai TV broadcast the first color program &quot;Thunderbolt Boat&quot;, and broadcast the first color production in 1967. In 1969, Kansai TV realized 60% of the prime-time programs in color, and in November of the following year, all the prime-time programs were in color. Kansai TV sent 30 people to participate in the 1964 Tokyo Olympics interview activities, and used color TV to broadcast some events. In 1969, Fuji Television Network (FNS) was formally established, and Kansai TV station was one of the four permanent directors (The other three are Fuji TV, Tokai TV, and West Nippon TV), which have an important position in the network. Kansai TV was also the first TV station in Japan to start using computers for business affairs among private TV stations in Japan. It began to use computers for salary calculation and other businesses in 1962. In 1978, Kansai TV celebrated its 20th anniversary. During this period, Kansai TV made new achievements in the fields of technology and international communication. In 1979, Kansai TV began broadcasting stereo programs. In 1978 and 1981, Kansai TV also invited two former US presidents, Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, to visit Japan.

After the 1980s, as the ratings of Fuji TV ushered in a leap forward, Kansai TV also entered a peak ratings. In 1983, Kansai TV won the ratings championship for the first time in the evening prime time (19:00 to 22:00) and 19:00 to 23:00. In 1985, Kansai TV further won the triple crown of ratings in the prime time, evening time, and full-day three-time period, and maintained these records until 1994. Kansai TV&#x27;s advertising revenue has also increased significantly with the increase in ratings. In 1985, the operating income of Kansai TV Station reached 36.9 billion yen, achieving an average daily turnover of more than 100 million yen. Kansai TV is also actively exploring new areas other than television. In 1986, it produced its first film &quot;The Capital Disappears&quot;. In 1988, on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of its launch, Kansai TV produced and broadcast special programs such as &quot;Ancient Capital&quot; and &quot;A Journey to Central Asia&quot;.

In 1991, at the peak of Japan&#x27;s bubble economy period, Kansai TV set a record of 61.7 billion yen in operating income and 9.8 billion yen in regular interests. Under the background of excellent performance, insufficient space in the existing headquarters, and the successive relocation of Yomiuri TV and Mainichi Broadcasting to the new headquarters, Kansai TV also released a plan to build a new headquarters in 1994. Due to the lack of a suitable large-scale open space in Osaka City, Kansai TV decided to obtain the new headquarters construction land in the form of land trust by participating in the Ogimachi Park redevelopment plan of the Osaka City Government. In 1991, Kansai TV also set up a studio in Tokyo, so that artists could record Kansai TV&#x27;s programs in Tokyo and improve program production capabilities.

In 1995, Kansai TV only won one prime time championship in the triple crown of ratings, and the triple crown record stopped in 10 years. Since 1996, Yomiuri TV has replaced Kansai TV and has won the triple crown in ratings year after year. This situation is exactly the same as that of Nippon TV in Kanto , which shows that the ratings competition in the Kansai area has changed from the competition among the stations. The competition evolved into a competition among network networks. In addition, Kansai TV opened its official website on November 22, 1995, the first Japanese television station to do so.

In March 1997, the new headquarters of Kansai TV Ogimachi was completed. Beginning in April, various departments of Kansai TV began to move into the new headquarters one after another, and officially launched signals from the new headquarters on September 29. In response to the multi-channel era, Kansai TV launched the satellite TV channel Kansai TV Kyoto Channel in 1998, which specializes in broadcasting programs related to the history and culture of Kyoto. In 2003, Kansai TV began broadcasting digital TV signals. By 2007, Kansai TV&#x27;s digital signal had covered 91.1% of the households within the broadcast range.

In April 2001, Kansai TV carried out a major program adaptation of 37% of the whole day, 57.3% of the evening time, and 62.7% of the prime time, intending to win the triple crown of ratings. In 2003, Kansai TV celebrated its 45th anniversary. This year, under the background of Fuji TV&#x27;s ratings recovery, Kansai TV won the triple crown of ratings again after 10 years. Kansai TV also held a series of celebrations for the 45th anniversary of broadcasting in 2003, including inviting the Trieste Opera Troupe from Italy to perform in Japan. In 2007, Kansai TV was exposed to &quot; Discover! Encyclopedia of Real Things II was falsified, the reputation and image of the media were seriously damaged, and it was once expelled from the Japanese Private Broadcasting Union.

In 2008, Kansai Television rejoined the Japan Private Broadcasting Union. During this period, due to the economic depression in Japan, Kansai TV Station also fell into operational difficulties. In the first half of 2008, Kansai TV recorded a deficit financial report for the first time since its broadcast In this severe situation, Kansai TV Station decided to close the Kyoto channel and concentrate its operating resources on terrestrial television. With the nationwide suspension of analog TV signals on July 24, 2011, KTV shut down its analog signal. In March 2015, Kansai TV ended its 51-year-old long-running abstract KTV-wordmark logo alongside its 8-symbol which ends their usage for the first time of 51 years since 1964, and by that, the station unifies its appellation as &quot;Kantele (カンテレ)&quot; as it adopts a new logo which consists of a purple 8 on a purple shadow and it is beside to the grey Kantale, so for now, its new logo will be stylized as &quot;8 kantele (8 カンテレ)&quot;.

<doc id="1327403" wikidata="Q2959594" url="?curid=1327403" title="Charles Lawrence (British Army officer)">
<text>Brigadier-General Charles Lawrence (14 December 1709 – 19 October 1760) was a British military officer who, as lieutenant governor and subsequently governor of Nova Scotia, is perhaps best known for overseeing the Expulsion of the Acadians and settling the New England Planters in Nova Scotia. He was born in Plymouth, England, and died in Halifax, Nova Scotia. According to historian Elizabeth Griffiths, Lawrence was seen as a &quot;competent&quot;, &quot;efficient&quot; officer with a &quot;service record that had earned him fairly rapid promotion, a person of considerable administrative talent who was trusted by both Cornwallis and Hopson.&quot; He is buried in the crypt of St. Paul&#x27;s Church (Halifax).

==Early career==
Lawrence was born in Plymouth (Devon) on 14 December 1709. He followed his father, General Charles John Lawrence, who is said to have served in Flanders under John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, into a military career.

Charles Lawrence&#x27;s earlier life is obscure. He was commissioned in the 11th Regiment of Foot and served in the West Indies from 1733 until 1737. He then served in the War Office. He was made lieutenant in 1731 and then captain in 1745. He was wounded while serving with the 54th Foot in the Battle of Fontenoy in 1745.

==Father Le Loutre&#x27;s War==

During Father Le Loutre&#x27;s War, in 1749 he transferred again, to the 40th Foot. He participated in the Battle at Chignecto (1749) and then built Fort Lawrence on the south bank of the Missaguash River in the fall of 1750, and was promoted lieutenant-colonel the same year. In 1753, he directed the settlement of the Foreign Protestants at Lunenburg, Nova Scotia, and suppressed the settlers&#x27; rebellion there. Lawrence mobilized rangers to prevent the Acadian Exodus as well as fight the Mi&#x27;kmaq.

==French and Indian War==

During the French and Indian War, in conjunction with Governor William Shirley of Massachusetts, he helped raise forces for the Battle of Fort Beauséjour on 16 June 1755. He wrote the deportation order, and orchestrated the various campaigns of the Expulsion of the Acadians, beginning with the Bay of Fundy Campaign (1755). After the native Raid on Lunenburg (1756), he placed a bounty on male native scalps.

Lawrence commissioned several armed patrol vessels to patrol the Nova Scotia coast as part of a provincial marine, including the ten-gun brigantine &quot;Montague&quot; in 1759.

As governor of Nova Scotia, Lawrence saw the settlement of the Acadian lands by New England Planters. In 1757, Lawrence was further promoted to the title of brigadier general and commanded one of the three divisions at the successful siege of the French fortress at Louisbourg on Île Royale (Cape Breton Island) in 1758.

He is said to have died of pneumonia in 1760 in Halifax, Nova Scotia and is buried under St. Paul&#x27;s Church (Halifax).

According to his biographer, Dominique Graham,

<doc id="1327408" wikidata="Q6423520" url="?curid=1327408" title="Knox Box">
<text>A Knox Box is a small, wall-mounted safe that holds building keys for fire departments, emergency medical services, and sometimes police to retrieve in emergency situations. The term &quot;Knox-Box&quot; is a brand name for such products produced by the American company Knox Associates, which does business as The Knox Company. The Knox Box is part of a line of security-related products marketed as the Knox Rapid Access System.

Local fire departments hold master keys to all Knox Boxes in their response area, enabling them to quickly enter buildings in their area without having to force entry or find individual keys held in deposit at the station. Sometimes the Knox Master Key is stored in a key retention device such as Sentralok or KeySecure. Knox Master Key retention devices provide accountability on access to the key. KeySecure records an audit trail of when the key is accessed while Sentralok requires a dispatcher to release the key with DTMF tones. Both Sentralok and KeySecure are also branded products of the Knox Company.

A Knox Box can cut fire losses for building owners since firefighters can enter buildings without breaking doors or windows. It can also reduce the potential of a firefighter being injured forcing entry.

The disadvantage of the system is that it provides a single point of failure for the security of many buildings. If the key to a district&#x27;s Knox Box is stolen or copied, a thief can enter any building in the area that has a Knox Box. All Knox commercial boxes have a standard tamper switch which can be wired to the building&#x27;s fire alarm control panel to sound a supervisory alert if the box is opened.

The keys for Knox KeySecure are the same throughout a district (the extent of which depends on the district). At the February 2013 RSA Conference, a researcher publicized a possible exploit, claiming that he had successfully ordered a box, disassembled it, and used the information from disassembling the lock cylinder to create his own master key.

<text>The NH series of Honda scooters was sold worldwide beginning in 1983, in 50, 80, 90, 100 and 125cc versions. All models have an air-cooled two-stroke engine with CDI ignition. All models except the Lead 50 have leading link front suspension, electric and kick start, and a fuel gauge. The Lead 50 has a traditional telescopic fork front suspension and only electric start. All models have drum brakes and CVT transmission.

==Models==
*Aero (USA, 1983–85)
*Lead (Outside USA, 1983–87)
*Vision (Outside USA, 1987–94)
*Mascot (Canada)
American regulations in 1986 required any motorcycle over 50cc to be four stroke to combat air pollution.

*Kinetic (DX, ZX, Y2K Etc..) (India, 1984–2007)
*Dio (India, 2001–present)

==Engine sizes==

*NH 150 (149cc)
There is also a more modern Lead in 100cc, 110cc and 125cc versions.

==Regional variations==
There were other regional variations as well as going by a different name in the USA. Most notably, the headlights were different on the early European models. The front handlebar moulding was later changed to be common across all models, allowing the same headlights to be used.

<doc id="1327421" wikidata="Q5214954" url="?curid=1327421" title="Danbury Fair (shopping mall)">
<text>Danbury Fair (also referred to as Danbury Fair Mall) is an upscale shopping mall located in Danbury, Connecticut. As of 2011, it is the second largest shopping mall in Connecticut, as well as the fifth largest in New England. It is located off of Interstate 84 and U.S. Route 7 opposite the Danbury Municipal Airport.
==Overview==
There are 192 retailers and eateries, including the major department stores Macy&#x27;s and JCPenney. Filene&#x27;s was in the mall until the 2006 Macy&#x27;s consolidation. The mall contains attractions targeting children, including a double-decker carousel in the food court and many youth-oriented events and activities the mall sponsors on a regular basis (such as &quot;Family Fun Night&quot;). Many of these events take place in the mall&#x27;s center on the lower floor. This space changes throughout the year, and can be converted into a stage area for special events such as song and dance performances. The mall is decorated during the holidays.
Every summer from June to July, a carnival opens, taking up one of the mall&#x27;s parking areas. The mall refers to the event as the “Danbury City Fair” in a nod to the historic fair upon whose site the mall was built. When the mall changed companies in the mid-2000s, however, the carnival was cut back from a month-long event starting in June to just a two-week event, starting every Memorial Day weekend.

==History==
The mall was built by the Wilmorite Corporation on land formerly used for the Danbury Fair, which paid $170,000 per acre (at that time, the highest price ever paid for land in the Danbury area).

During construction, it emerged that two Wilmorite executives had paid Danbury&#x27;s then-mayor, James Dyer $60,000 in cash, sometimes concealed in newspapers. They claimed he demanded the money to assure his support for the mall. The allegations contributed to Dyer&#x27;s defeat for re-election in 1987. He was acquitted of corruption charges in 1990; other charges were dismissed later. 

The mall opened in 1986, anchored by Sears and G. Fox &amp; Co. (which became Filene&#x27;s in 1993). Macy&#x27;s opened in October 1987, and JCPenney opened in March 1988. In 1991, Lord &amp; Taylor and a parking garage were added. In 2005, the Wilmorite Corporation sold the mall to The Macerich Company.
In January 2007, Danbury Fair began the process of an interior renovation, which was completed in Spring 2008. The two areas that received the most noticeable renovations were the food court and the center court. The renovated food court featured new banquet seating and a slightly curved panoramic view of the restaurants, which reduced the number of restaurants from 16 to 11. In the center court, the large- scale fountains (which also doubled as event areas) were removed and replaced by a Starbucks coffee bar, soft seating with tables, and a down-scaled water feature to reduce the noise level.

By 2010, the Filene&#x27;s store was reconstructed into mall space which includes Dick&#x27;s Sporting Goods, Forever 21, Brio Tuscan Grille, The Cheesecake Factory, and L.L.Bean.

In 2015, Primark opened one of its first American locations at the center. It opened in the upper level of the Sears store, while Sears consolidated to an updated 56,000 sq ft format on the lower level.

The dawn of the 2020s saw several traditional retailers reduce the scale of their department store locations due to the impact of both digital retailers and the COVID pandemic.

On November 7, 2019, it was announced that the Sears location would shutter as part of an ongoing decision to eliminate its traditional brick-and-mortar format.

In August 2020, Lord &amp; Taylor announced it would close its retail stores as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

On March 9, 2024, Round1 officially opened in the lower level of the former Forever 21. On April 9, 2024, Target opened in the lower level of the former Sears.

<text>György Faludy (September 22, 1910 – September 1, 2006; ), sometimes anglicized as George Faludy, was a Hungarian poet, writer and translator.

== Life ==

=== Travels, vicissitudes, and remembrance ===
Faludy completed his schooling in the Fasori Evangélikus Gimnázium and studied at the Universities of Vienna, Berlin and Graz. During these times he developed radical liberalist views, which he maintained till the very last days of his life.

In 1938, he left Hungary for Paris because of his Jewish ancestry, and then for the U.S. During World War II, he served in the American forces. He arrived back in Hungary in 1946. In April 1947 he was among a group that destroyed a Budapest statue of Ottokár Prohászka, a Hungarian bishop who is respected by many but who is often considered antisemitic. He only admitted his participation forty years later.

In 1949 he was condemned with fictitious accusations and was sent to the forced labor camp of Recsk for three years. During this time, he lectured other prisoners in literature, history and philosophy. After his release he made his living by translation. In 1956 (after the Revolution) he escaped again to the West. He settled in London, and was the editor of a Hungarian literary journal.

It was during his stay in London that Faludy wrote his memoir, which was soon translated to English, by which he is still best known outside Hungary: &quot;My Happy Days in Hell&quot;. (It was only published in his native language in 1987, and since then in several further editions.) He moved to Toronto in 1967 and lived there for twenty years. He gave lectures in Canada and the U.S. and was the editor of Hungarian literary journals. In 1976, he received Canadian citizenship and two years later received an honorary doctorate from the University of Toronto, where he regularly taught. His poems were published by &quot;The New York Resident&quot; in 1980.

In 1988 Faludy returned to Hungary. After the fall of communism, his works, which had previously been distributed only as samizdat during the Communist period, were at last published in Hungary. New collections of poems appeared in the 1990s, as well as several translations. In 1994 he received Hungary&#x27;s most prestigious award, the Kossuth Prize. In 2000 he published another memoir, &quot;After My Days in Hell&quot;, about his life after the labour camp.

Renowned for his anecdotes as well as his writing, he was a celebrated wit whose life story attracted the attention of many foreign authors. Besides the many European authors who visited Faludy, there was the Canadian author George Jonas, screenwriter of &quot;Munich&quot;, as well as the columnist, poet, and playwright Rory Winston.

=== Relationships ===
Faludy&#x27;s first wife was Vali Ács. His second wife, Zsuzsa Szegő, died in 1963. They had a son, Andrew, born in 1955. Faludy&#x27;s grandson, Alexander Faludy, born in 1983, is an Anglican priest and a critic of the current government in Hungary.

In 1963 Eric Johnson (1937–2004), a US ballet dancer and later a renowned poet in contemporary Latin poetry, read the memoir &quot;My Happy Days in Hell,&quot; became enchanted with the author, and traveled to Hungary in search of Faludy. He began to learn Hungarian and finally met Faludy three years later in Malta. He became his secretary, translator, co-author and partner for the next 36 years. In 2002 when Faludy married again, Johnson left for Kathmandu, Nepal, and died there in February 2004. 

In 1984, while living in Toronto, Faludy married Leonie Kalman (née Erenyi), a long-time family friend from Budapest and Tangier, Morocco, at Toronto City Hall. George and Leonie kept their separate residences and did not consummate their marriage, but Leonie kept the Faludy name until her death in 2011 (in Fleet, Hants, UK), aged 102. 

In 2002, Faludy married a 26-year-old poet, Fanny Kovács. Faludy published poems written jointly with his wife. Even though Faludy was extremely open about his bisexuality, it wasn&#x27;t revealed to the public until the Hungarian state-owned television broadcast an interview with him after his death.

=== A memorial park in Toronto ===

In 2006, a memorial park was built in his honor designed by the landscape architect Scott Torrance, facing his former apartment at 25 St. Mary&#x27;s Street. It was initiated by the Toronto Legacy Project to commemorate the outstanding cultural figures of the city. A bronze plaque was placed in the park with his portrait, made by the Hungarian-born sculptor Dora de Pedery-Hunt. His poem &quot;Michelangelo&#x27;s Last Prayer&quot;, chosen by the poet, was carved on the plaque in English and in Hungarian.

== Work ==

Faludy&#x27;s translations of the ballads of François Villon, and even more prominent rewritings (as he admitted several times), brought him huge popularity on their initial publication in 1934, and have been since published about forty times. He could have hardly expressed these ideas in any other way in his time. He wrote several volumes of poetry as well, some of which were published in English. His other outstanding success was &quot;My Happy Days in Hell&quot; (Pokolbéli víg napjaim), a memoir first published in 1962 in English translation, which was translated to French and German as well, but did not appear in the original Hungarian until 1987.

<doc id="1327423" wikidata="Q7760035" url="?curid=1327423" title="Reformed Church of Newtown">
<text>The Reformed Church of Newtown () is a historic Reformed church in the Elmhurst neighborhood of Queens in New York City. The church was first established by Dutch immigrants in 1731. The neighborhood had been established in 1652 by the Dutch as Middenburgh, a village suburb of New Amsterdam (i.e., New York City). After the English took over the Dutch colony of New Netherland in 1664, the village was renamed New Town, later simplified to Newtown. When Newtown was renamed Elmhurst in the late 1890s, the church retained its original name, a name still also carried by the local high school and subway station.

The Reformed Church of Newtown is a congregation in the Queens classis of the New York regional synod of the Reformed Church in America (RCA). Founded in 1628, the Reformed Church in America is the oldest Protestant Christian denomination in the United States.

==Church building==
The original Federal-Greek Revival style building, completed in 1735, had survived the struggles of the colonial days and the disruptions of the American Revolutionary War (during which the British seized it for use as an armory). It was replaced in 1832 by the present sanctuary, a New York City designated landmark. The Reformed Church of Newtown Complex was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

The cornerstone of the original building can still be seen in the foundation of its present structure. The sanctuary and adjoining fellowship hall are, as noted by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, &quot;one of the few all wood church groups remaining in the City.&quot; A 1989 renovation replaced cupolas that had been damaged by a storm.

==Congregation==
As the needs of the church and community changed, staffing was increased, structural improvements were made, and the preaching shifted from Dutch to English. In 1956, for its 225th anniversary, President Dwight D. Eisenhower visited the church. For this occasion, the Reverend A. Nelson Doak compiled a brief history of the parish and praised Elmhurst&#x27;s ethnic diversity.

In 1980, as Elmhurst was changing complexion, Rev. Doak&#x27;s hope for Newtown Church began to be fulfilled. His successor, the Rev. David Boyce, perceiving the changing needs of the community, initiated a worship service for Taiwanese immigrants and later another service for the increasing population of Tamil-speaking Indians in the area. The originally Dutch church now had services in English, Taiwanese, and Tamil. The Tamil ministry stopped after the death of the Tamil minister, the Rev. Paul Theodore, but some Tamil members incorporated themselves into the English service and remained with the congregation. Meanwhile, the Taiwanese ministry, led by the Rev. Bill H.C. Lee, soon outnumbered Newtown&#x27;s white congregants, as the membership more than doubled from 1981 to 1982. The Taiwanese had entered in, not as a distinct congregation, but as an additional ministry under the authority of Newtown&#x27;s leadership. As full members, they voted and soon obtained seats on the church&#x27;s consistory. Although there can technically be only one “senior pastor” in an RCA parish, Pastor Boyce, recognizing the unique circumstances of the day, had innovatively elevated Lee to be an equal “co-pastor” with him.

In 1995, the Rev. David K.T. Su instituted a third worship service in Mandarin Chinese. Efforts by the church to fulfill the Scriptural call to be &quot;a house of prayer for all peoples&quot; have thus resulted in a Taiwanese service, a Mandarin service, and an English service attended by Asians, Latinos, and white Americans each Sunday. In December 2017, Rev. Su retired after nearly three decades of service to the church, after which the Rev. Dr. Tien-Heng Chiu was installed as Senior Pastor.

The Reformed Church of Newtown has also produced several ministers for the Reformed Church of America in recent decades: the Rev. I. Douglas Estella (ordained 1986) and the Rev. Ben Lin (ordained 1997), both sons of Newtown Church.

<text>Buenavista is a station on the Mexico City Metro, in the Colonia Buenavista neighborhood of the Cuauhtémoc borough. It is the southwestern terminal station of Line B (the green-on-silver line, Buenavista-Ciudad Azteca). It also offers connections to the Insurgentes Metrobús bus rapid transit line. In 2019, the station had an average ridership of 66,804 passengers per day, making it the tenth busiest station in the network.

==Name and pictogram==
The station logo represents the front of an ALCO type diesel locomotive. Its name comes from the nearby &quot;Estación Buenavista&quot; (Buenavista railway station) main line railway station, which closed its doors to passenger traffic in 1999, but then reopened for the new Tren Suburbano in 2008. The metro station was opened on 15 December 1999.

==General information==
In December 1999, the Buenavista metro station was opened as part of the first stretch of Line B, going from Buenavista to Villa de Aragón.

Near Buenavista is the central administrative building of the Cuauhtémoc borough local government, the library &quot;Biblioteca Vasconcelos&quot;, and on Saturday mornings only the Tianguis Cultural del Chopo, a flea market dedicated to youth culture (mostly music), and Forum Buenavista shopping mall.

As of 2020, Buenavista offers connections with the Ferrocarril Suburbano, a commuter rail that has Cuautitlán in the State of Mexico as final destination. Also, users can connect with Lines 1, 3 and 4 of the Metrobús, a bus rapid transit network.

<doc id="1327436" wikidata="Q6783909" url="?curid=1327436" title="Maspeth, Queens">
<text>Maspeth is a residential and commercial community in the borough of Queens in New York City. It was founded in the early 17th century by Dutch and English settlers. Neighborhoods sharing borders with Maspeth are Woodside to the north; Sunnyside to the northwest; Greenpoint, Brooklyn to the west; East Williamsburg, Brooklyn to the southwest; Fresh Pond and Ridgewood to the south; and Middle Village and Elmhurst to the east.

Maspeth is located in Queens Community District 5 and its ZIP Code is 11378. It is patrolled by the New York City Police Department&#x27;s 104th Precinct. Politically, Maspeth is represented by the New York City Council&#x27;s 29th and 30th districts.

==History==

The name &quot;Maspeth&quot; is derived from the name of Mespeatches Native Americans, one of the 13 main tribes that inhabited Long Island. It is translated to mean &quot;an inundating tidal river&quot; as determined by William Wallace Tooker or meaning &quot;at the bad waterplace&quot; relating to the many stagnant swamps that existed in the area.

The area known today as Maspeth was chartered by New Netherlanders and British settlers in the early 17th century. The Dutch had purchased land in the area known today as Queens in 1635, and within a few years began chartering towns. In 1642, they settled Maspat, under a charter granted to Rev. Francis Doughty, making Maspeth the first English settlement in Queens.

The deed that was signed between the Native Americans and the settlers was the first one signed on Long Island. As part of the deed&#x27;s signature, the &quot;Newtown Patent&quot; granted to settlers. Conflicts with the Maspat tribe forced many settlers to move to what is now Elmhurst in 1643. The settlement was leveled the following year in an attack by Native Americans, and the surviving settlers returned to Manhattan.

In 1652, settlers ventured back to the area, settling an area slightly inland from the previous Maspat location. This new area was called Middleburg, and eventually developed into what is now Elmhurst, bordering Maspeth. Originally, 28 English Quakers had founded the village of Maspeth, which had sizable water and milling industries along Newtown Creek and Maspeth Creek. Two storekeepers, Nathanial Hazard and Francis T. White, sold food and clothes at the Maspeth Town Docks, at what is now 56th Terrace and Rust Street, by the late 18th century. After the American Revolutionary War, villagers repaved roads with crushed oyster shells or wooden planks.

Columbusville was the name formerly applied to a section of Maspeth. It was a development of Edward Dunn that took place on 69th Place, originally known as Firth Avenue, between Grand Avenue and Caldwell Avenue during 1854–55, and was subsequently absorbed into Maspeth. The name fell into disuse in the 1890s.

What was Laurel Hill in the post-colonial era has become West Maspeth, bounded by Calvary Cemetery, and later the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, in the west, the Queens-Midtown Expressway on the north, 58th Street on the east, and 56th Road and the Long Island Rail Road&#x27;s Montauk Branch on the south. Laurel Hill Boulevard (56th Road) is a remnant of the neighborhood&#x27;s previous name, although all traces of the former Laurel Hill railroad station are gone.

Following waves of immigration during the 19th century, Maspeth was home to a shanty town of Boyash (Ludar) Gypsies between 1925 and 1939, though this was eventually bulldozed. By the 1970s, the neighborhood had become home primarily to German, Irish, Lithuanian, and Polish residents. Maspeth was considered relatively safe compared to other New York City neighborhoods experiencing crime increases, and multiple generations of the same family often lived in Maspeth.

==Demographics==

Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of Maspeth was 30,516, an increase of 1,600 (5.5%) from the 28,916 counted in 2000. Covering an area of , the neighborhood had a population density of .

The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 59.2% (18,080) White, 0.8% (253) African American, 0.1% (31) Native American, 12.0% (3,676) Asian, 0.0% (1) Pacific Islander, 0.4% (115) from other races, and 0.8% (245) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 26.6% (8,115) of the population.

The entirety of Community Board 5, which comprises Maspeth, Ridgewood, Middle Village, and Glendale, had 166,924 inhabitants as of NYC Health&#x27;s 2018 Community Health Profile, with an average life expectancy of 81.4 years. This is about equal to the median life expectancy of 81.2 for all New York City neighborhoods. Most inhabitants are youth and middle-aged adults: 22% are between the ages of 0–17, 31% between 25 and 44, and 26% between 45 and 64. The ratio of college-aged and elderly residents was lower, at 8% and 13% respectively.

As of 2017, the median household income in Community Board 5 was $71,234. In 2018, an estimated 19% of Maspeth and Ridgewood residents lived in poverty, compared to 19% in all of Queens and 20% in all of New York City. One in seventeen residents (6%) were unemployed, compared to 8% in Queens and 9% in New York City. Rent burden, or the percentage of residents who have difficulty paying their rent, is 46% in Maspeth and Ridgewood, lower than the boroughwide and citywide rates of 53% and 51% respectively. Based on this calculation, , Maspeth, Ridgewood, Middle Village, and Glendale are considered to be high-income relative to the rest of the city and not gentrifying.

Most people who live in Maspeth are of Polish, Italian, or Irish descent. This is reflected in the many businesses in the neighborhood like Irish pubs and Italian and Polish specialty stores and markets. Many people of Eastern European, German, Chinese, or Hispanic origin (mostly Puerto Ricans from nearby Ridgewood) have also moved to the area. The Polish population in Maspeth is relatively large; the New York metropolitan area is home to the second largest community of Polish Americans behind Chicago.

==Land use==


Maspeth is zoned for a mixture of uses. The area consisting of 43rd Street through 58th Street, including the former Furman Island, is mostly industrial lowlands. The blocks from 60th Street to 74th Street are mostly residential, but there is a small industrial presence on Grand Avenue.

===Industrial===
The Phelps Dodge Corporation was present from 1920 to 1983, during which matter from their premises contaminated Newtown Creek, which separates northern Brooklyn from western Queens and serves barge traffic. In the 2000s, politicians started to make efforts to clean up the Newtown and Maspeth Creeks.

Freight train traffic moves on the Long Island Rail Road Montauk Branch and the lightly used Bushwick Branch, both of which are used by the New York and Atlantic Railway. The LIRR Bay Ridge Branch, a freight-only railway branch, separates the neighborhood from Elmhurst and Middle Village. A new West Maspeth rail freight station has been proposed in connection with a Cross-Harbor Rail Tunnel to diminish truck traffic across New York City. It is opposed by residents who do not want more trucks in Maspeth.

The Elmhurst gas tanks were formerly located in the area and were demolished in 2001. They are now the site of Elmhurst Park. The Maspeth gas tanks were also located in the area until they were demolished.

===Residential and commercial===
Single and multi-family dwellings make up most of Maspeth. There are few apartment buildings, except for the Ridgewood Gardens co-ops along 65th Place. Houses in Maspeth range from 400 to 600 thousand dollars. One particularly notable group of houses in the area is a cluster of 2- and 3-story orange and yellow brick buildings located between Grand Avenue, 79th Street, and Calamus Avenue. They were made for the Mathews Company and built in 1930 by Louis Allmendinger.

Much of the area&#x27;s commerce is situated along Grand Avenue.

The neighborhood, which is nearly isolated by the industrial areas and cemeteries surrounding it, is described by some residents as having a small-town feeling. It is bisected by the Long Island Expressway, locally known as the LIE, though the two parts of Maspeth are connected by several crossings across the expressway. There are many community organizations, which have, among other things, preserved the neighborhood&#x27;s small-town-like character; for example, they blocked the construction of a Home Depot at the site of what is now the Elmhurst Park.

===Cemeteries===

Cemeteries take up another large part of Maspeth, although they are separated from residential areas for the most part. The Mount Olivet Cemetery, the largest cemetery in the neighborhood, is located on a high hill in Maspeth and used to be an outer-borough vacation site. Mount Olivet Cemetery was planned on March 26, 1850, when James Maurice held a meeting at his Maspeth house to discuss the formation of the cemetery. Notable interments in the cemetery include cosmetics magnate Helena Rubinstein Courielli and sixteen victims of the 1911 Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire. The adjoining Mount Zion Cemetery contains a memorial to the victims of the fire.

==Police and crime==
Maspeth, Ridgewood, Middle Village, and Glendale are patrolled by the 104th Precinct of the NYPD, located at 64–02 Catalpa Avenue. The 104th Precinct ranked 21st safest out of 69 patrol areas for per-capita crime in 2010. However, the precinct covers a large diamond-shaped area, and Maspeth and Middle Village are generally seen as safer than Ridgewood. , with a non-fatal assault rate of 19 per 100,000 people, Maspeth and Ridgewood&#x27;s rate of violent crimes per capita is less than that of the city as a whole. The incarceration rate of 235 per 100,000 people is lower than that of the city as a whole.

The 104th Precinct has a lower crime rate than in the 1990s, with crimes across all categories having decreased by 87.4% between 1990 and 2018. The precinct reported 2 murders, 17 rapes, 140 robberies, 168 felony assaults, 214 burglaries, 531 grand larcenies, and 123 grand larcenies auto in 2018.

== Fire safety ==

Maspeth contains a New York City Fire Department (FDNY) fire station, Squad 288/Hazardous Materials Co. 1, at 56–29 68th Street. Another fire station, Engine Co. 291/Ladder Co. 140, is located at 56–07 Metropolitan Avenue in Ridgewood, just outside the Maspeth border.

The firehouse of Squad 288/Hazmat 1 was designed by Morgan &amp; Trainer and opened in 1914. During the September 11 attacks in 2001, Squad 288/Hazmat 1 were among the first to respond. The firehouse lost 19 firefighters in the collapse of the towers, the largest loss from any firehouse in the city. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission considered the firehouse for official city landmark status in 2013.

The nearest major hospital is Elmhurst Hospital Center in Elmhurst.

==Post office and ZIP Code==
Maspeth is covered by ZIP Code 11378. The United States Post Office operates the Maspeth Station at 55–02 69th Street.

==Economy==

Hagstrom Map, the best-selling brand of road maps in the New York metropolitan area from the mid-20th to early 21st century, was based in Maspeth.

==Community institutions==
The Maspeth Town Hall community center is located on 72nd Street. A one-room schoolhouse between 1897 and 1932, it was then occasionally used by a local girls&#x27; club and the Works Progress Administration until 1936. It was a New York City Police Department precinct until 1971. The building was renovated and made into a community center in 1972.

Other neighborhood institutions include the local Chamber of Commerce, the Lions Club, and the Maspeth Federal Savings Bank.

==Parks and plazas==
A September 11 memorial has been erected at 69th Street and Grand Avenue to commemorate the local FDNY Squad 288 and HAZMAT 1 firehouse&#x27;s casualties from the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center, which were the largest of any FDNY unit. The monument, adjacent to the LIE, faces the World Trade Center site, where the One World Trade Center can be seen. An annual memorial ceremony is held at the monument on September 11. The Walk of Honor, unveiled on Memorial Day 2006, is also in the square, and honors activists and visionaries who lived in the area.

Public parks, operated by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, include the Frontera Park at 69th Street and the LIE, as well as Principe Park at Maurice and 54th Avenues. Traditionally known as Maurice Park, it was renamed in 2005 in tribute to the community leader Frank Principe, who played a key role in its creation and continued welfare throughout his life.

The smallest park in New York City, Luke J. Lang Square, is located at the triangle caused by the intersection of Fresh Pond Road, 59th Road, and 61st Street. The park, which honors a local resident who died in World War I, occupies of land. Luke J. Lang Square consists of hedges, but formerly contained &quot;a flagpole, several benches, and three Norway maples.&quot; Another very small park, Garlinge Triangle at Grand and 57th Avenues, honors other residents who died in World War I. It is named after Private Walter A. Garlinge, the first Maspeth resident to die during the war.

Maspeth is also home to the Metropolitan Oval, a playing field for soccer players, which contains a view of the Manhattan skyline.

At Grand Avenue and the LIE, a plaque to &quot;Horse Cars Rest Stop&quot; exists. There used to be a horse cart barn at Brown Place, one block east of Grand Avenue. It is now Peter Charles Park, a small pocket park. When the LIE was built in the 1950s, it also demolished many streets; the construction of the LIE left many small triangular plazas behind, such as at 57th Road and 73rd Place, where the &quot;Quick Brown Fox Park&quot;, another pocket park, is located. The park is named after a story about a quick brown fox.

==Points of interest==
A sign at the intersection of Flushing, Grand, and Maspeth Avenues marks the place where streetcar lines (now the bus routes) used to split.

On the front yard of the Church of the Transfiguration on Perry Avenue, a replica of a Lithuanian roadside shrine has stood since 1981.

St. Saviour&#x27;s Church, built in 1847 at Rust Street and 57th Drive, was located on land formerly owned by lawyer and politician James Maurice. After a 1970 arson, it was cleaned up. However, by 2005, developers bought the church in order to demolish it, since the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission had refused to landmark the church. This was largely opposed; however, its facade was torn apart, disassembled, and stored at All Faiths Cemetery by 2008. Despite community effort, led by the Juniper Park Civic Association, to make a park on the site, by 2011, the church&#x27;s former site had become warehouses, while provisions for a new site for the church in All Faiths Cemetery had been approved.

The Ridgewood Gardens apartment/co-op complex, on a hill known as the Ridgewood Plateau, was built on woods owned by James Maurice and donated to the Episcopal Church in 1850. Maurice Woods was bounded by Maurice Avenue, Jay Avenue, 66th Street, and Borden Avenue. 53rd Avenue went down a slope to 64th Street. The apartment complex was built later. It is notable for a step street that descends the hill, as well as for a very old, graffiti-covered lamppost on that street.

James Maurice used to live at a home at 1 Hill Street. It was sold in 1909.

The house where Anton Fausner&#x27;s wheelwright and wagonmaker&#x27;s shop was located is on Grand Avenue just south of the LIE. Later, an auto shop, Maspeth Auto Parts, was located in that building. In 2006, that house was torn down and replaced by a bank. The wheelwright was patronized by farmers from Long Island who stayed at the Queens County Hotel, built in 1851 along Grand Avenue, on their way to the markets.
The Maspeth Theater, the neighborhood&#x27;s largest theater in the 1920s, was built in 1924 at Grand Avenue and 69th Street by Straus and Strausberg, with 1,161 seats. It was owned by three companies before closing in 1965. Notable performers included Judy Garland. There were also many other theaters in Maspeth in the 1920s.

A former Maspeth supermarket, Wielback&#x27;s Grocery—one of the oldest in the area—then became Griff&#x27;s Hardware. In 2000, the building became Griff&#x27;s Laundry, a laundromat that closed less than ten years later and was slated for demolition. The building was notable for a neon sign on its facade.

At Clinton Hall, a 1920s-built venue that had interior balconies and a large chandelier, there is now a laboratory and industrial offices. It is named after a mansion built by Judge Joseph Sackett. Sackett had built a wood-framed mansion behind the hall; later, New York Governor DeWitt Clinton planned the Erie Canal. The lands of the Sackett-Clinton House, as the mansion was called, were turned into a park by 1910, and the mansion burned down in 1933.

The Clinton Diner, at Maspeth and Maurice Avenues, was built in 1935 and appeared in the movie &quot;Goodfellas&quot; among others films. The diner was destroyed by fire in 2018. The Queens Head Tavern, nearby, was an American Revolutionary War-era tavern and was used as a stagecoach stop later on.

Grand Avenue continues eastward to end at Queens Boulevard in Elmhurst. There is also access to I-278, the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway and I-495, the Long Island Expressway. The former crosses the Newtown Creek on the Kosciuszko Bridge.

<doc id="1327441" wikidata="Q3037975" url="?curid=1327441" title="Douglas, Chicago">
<text>Douglas, on the South Side of Chicago, Illinois, is one of Chicago&#x27;s 77 community areas. The neighborhood is named for Stephen A. Douglas, Illinois politician and Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s political foe, whose estate included a tract of land given to the federal government. This tract later was developed for use as the Civil War Union training and prison camp, Camp Douglas, located in what is now the eastern portion of the Douglas neighborhood. Douglas gave that part of his estate at Cottage Grove and 35th to the Old University of Chicago. The Chicago 2016 Olympic bid planned for the Olympic Village to be constructed on a truck parking lot, south of McCormick Place, that is mostly in the Douglas community area and partly in the Near South Side.

The Douglas community area stretches from 26th Street, south to Pershing Road along the Lake Shore, including parts of the Green Line, along State Street and the Metra Electric and Amtrak passenger railroad tracks, which run parallel to Lake Shore Drive. Burnham Park runs along its shoreline, containing 31st Street Beach. The community area also contains part of the neighborhood of [[Black Metropolis–Bronzeville District|Bronzeville]], the historic center of black culture in the city, since the early 20th century and the Great Migration.

== Neighborhoods ==
=== Bronzeville === 
Bronzeville is the area comprising the Douglas, Grand Boulevard, and Oakland communities on the South Side of Chicago, around the Illinois Institute of Technology, VanderCook College of Music, and Illinois College of Optometry. It is accessible via the Green and Red lines of the Chicago Transit Authority, as well as the Metra Electric District Main Line. In 2011, a new Metra station, Jones/Bronzeville Station, opened to serve the neighborhood on the Rock Island and planned SouthEast Service.

Bronzeville is located in Chicago&#x27;s 3rd ward, currently represented by Alderman Pat Dowell.
In the early 20th century, Bronzeville was known as the &quot;Black Metropolis&quot;, one of the nation&#x27;s most significant concentrations of African-American businesses, and culture. The groundbreaking Pekin Theatre rose near 27th street in the first decade of the 20th century.

Between 1910 and 1920, during an early peak of the &quot;Great Migration&quot;, the population of the area increased dramatically when thousands of black Americans escaped the de jure segregation and prejudice rife in the U.S.South and migrated to Chicago in search of industrial jobs. The Wabash YMCA is considered the first black Y in the U.S. It remains active today due to ongoing support from nearby black churches. The Wabash YMCA&#x27;s work to commemorate black culture was the genesis of Black History Month.

In 1922, Louis B. Anderson, a Chicago alderman, had the architects Michaelsen &amp; Rognstad build him a house at 3800 South Calumet Avenue. The surrounding area would take on the name of this house (which he had named &quot;Bronzeville)&quot;.

Key figures in the area include: Andrew &quot;Rube&quot; Foster, founder of the Negro National Baseball League; Ida B. Wells, a civil rights activist, journalist and co-organizer of the NAACP; Margaret Taylor-Burroughs, artist, author, and one of the co-founders of the DuSable Museum of African American History; Bessie Coleman, the first black woman pilot; Gwendolyn Brooks, poet laureate and first black American awarded the Pulitzer Prize, as well as, other acclaimed authors and artists of the Chicago Black Renaissance; actresses Susie Garrett, Marla Gibbs and Jennifer Beals; acclaimed R&amp;B singers Minnie Riperton, Sam Cooke and Lou Rawls; and cornet player and jazz bandleader King Oliver. His protégé, jazz musician, trumpeter and bandleader Louis Armstrong from New Orleans and his wife Lil Hardin Armstrong, who was a pianist, composer and bandleader, lived in Bronzeville on E. 44th Street and performed at many of the area&#x27;s night clubs, including the Sunset Cafe and Dreamland Cafe. The neighborhood includes the Chicago Landmark Black Metropolis-Bronzeville District.

47th Street was and remains the hub of the Bronzeville neighborhood. In the early 21st century, it has started to regain some of its former glory. Gone for good is the Regal Theater (demolished in 1973), where many great performers took the stage. The Forum Hall building was built in 1897 designed by Chicago architect Samuel Atwater Treat (1839-1910) and may contain the oldest hardwood ballroom dance floor in Chicago. It filled a significant role in Bronzeville&#x27;s cultural scene, being the venue for famous musicians From the 1940s and 1960s, high-rise public housing projects were constructed in the area, which were managed by the Chicago Housing Authority. The largest complex was the Robert Taylor Homes. They developed severe social problems exacerbated by concentrated poverty among the residents and poor design of the buildings. This project was demolished in the late 1990s and early 21st century. The nickname &quot;Bronzeville&quot; was first used for the area in 1930 by James J. Gentry, a local theater editor for the &quot;Chicago Bee&quot; publication. It refers to the brown skin color of black Americans, who predominated as residents in that area. It has become common usage over decades.

The Bronzeville community features in various literary works set in Chicago, including Richard Wright&#x27;s &quot;Native Son&quot;, Gwendolyn Brooks&#x27; &quot;A Street in Bronzeville&quot;, Lorraine Hansberry&#x27;s stage play &quot;A Raisin in the Sun&quot;, Leon Forrest&#x27;s &quot;There is a Tree More Ancient than Eden&quot; [The Bloodworth Trilogy], Bayo Ojikutu&#x27;s crime novel &quot;47th Street Black&quot;, and Sara Paretsky&#x27;s detective mystery &quot;Blacklist&quot;, part of the V. I. Warshawski series.

Historical images of Bronzeville are in Explore Chicago Collections, a digital repository made available by Chicago Collections archives, libraries and other cultural institutions in the city.

===Prairie Shores===
Originally a five-building, 1677-unit public housing project erected in 1962 by Michael Reese Hospital, Prairie Shores has been adapted as a market rate, middle-class community. Along with the adjacent Lake Meadows development, this was part of the city&#x27;s largest urban renewal project at the time of its inception in 1946. The total project included construction of the Illinois Institute of Technology and Mercy Hospital. The development was funded under the Title I of the Housing Act of 1949, using US$6.2 million ($ million today) of subsidies.

===Groveland Park===
Of all the sections of Douglas originally developed by Stephen A. Douglas, only Groveland Park survives. Its homes are built around an oval-shaped park. Groveland Park is located between Cottage Grove Avenue, 33rd Street, 35th Street and the Metra Electric railroad tracks.

==Politics==
The Douglas community area has supported the Democratic Party in the past two presidential elections. In the 2016 presidential election, the Douglas cast 6,342 votes for Hillary Clinton and cast 187 votes for Donald Trump (97.13% to 2.80%). In the 2012 presidential election, Douglas cast 8,206 votes for Barack Obama and cast 158 votes for Mitt Romney (98.11% to 1.88%).

==Transportation==
The Metra Electric District has a flag stop at East 27th Street, where trains stop either at the request of a passenger on-board, or if riders are seen waiting on the platform.

== Demographics ==
The population of Douglas climbed precipitously through the mid-20th century as a result of the Great Migration of black families to the North. At the time, African American families were primarily limited to an area known as the &quot;Black Belt&quot;, which constitutes much of the area of historic Bronzeville. The rapid influx of new residents notoriously contributed to overcrowded and unsanitary conditions in the growing neighborhood.

Following its peak in 1950, the population of the neighborhood began a long decline as racial covenants restricting black settlement were lifted and black families sought residence in other areas. Economic decline in the 1960s and 1970s coinciding with disinvestment further contributed to the flight of families from the area. Furthermore, urban renewal projects led by the Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) contributed to the displacement of over 18,000 individuals from Bronzeville.

The turn of the 21st century saw the CHA enact its Plan for Transformation, resulting in the demolition of many of the public housing projects erected in the prior decades. Consequently, the population of the neighborhood plummeted at an even faster clip from 2000-2010, bottoming out at 18,238 residents. Beginning in the 1990s, however, Bronzeville and Douglas began to see renewed interest from middle- and upper-income black professionals attracted to its past. This trend has continued in recent times, with Douglas finally turning the corner on population growth in the 2020 census with an increase of 11.3% over the past decade.

Notably, researchers have identified that Bronzeville contains two of the 193 census tracts nationally that achieved a remarkable decrease in poverty with minimal displacement of the existing communities between 2000 and 2015. This trend has been attributed to the abundance of vacant lots throughout the neighborhood, which encourage development without driving out residents. Furthermore, commentators have noted that Bronzeville is unique among Chicago neighborhoods in that the majority of gentrification has been driven by the black middle class.

==Education==
The following Chicago Public Schools campuses serve Bronzeville: Beethoven Elementary School, Phillips Academy High School, Dunbar Vocational High School, Bronzeville Scholastic Institute, Chicago Military Academy, and Walter H. Dyett High School. Notable private schools include De La Salle High School and Hales Franciscan High School.

Young Women&#x27;s Leadership Charter School, a charter school, is in the community area.

Bronzeville is also home to the renowned Illinois Institute of Technology, which is famous for its engineering and architecture programs. It is home to the VanderCook College of Music and the Illinois College of Optometry. In 2006 the liberal arts school Shimer College, based on the Great Books, moved into the neighborhood.

<text>The Western Australian men&#x27;s cricket team, formerly nicknamed the Western Warriors, represent the Australian state of Western Australia in Australian domestic cricket. The team is selected and supported by the Western Australian Cricket Association (WACA), and plays its home games at the WACA Ground and Perth Stadium in Perth. 

The team mainly plays matches against other Australian states in the first-class Sheffield Shield competition and the 50 over One-Day Cup, but occasionally plays matches against touring international sides. Western Australia previously also fielded sides at Twenty20 level, but was replaced by the Perth Scorchers for the inaugural 2011–12 season of the Big Bash League. Western Australia&#x27;s current captains are Sam Whiteman in the Sheffield Shield and Ashton Turner in the One-Day Cup, and the current coach is Adam Voges.

==History==
Western Australia played their opening first-class matches on a tour of the Eastern states during the 1892–93 season, playing two games, against South Australia at the Adelaide Oval, and against Victoria at the MCG. The team was captained by Herbert Orr.

They continued to play first-class matches against South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales, interspersed with matches against visiting teams from overseas, until they were admitted to the Sheffield Shield for the 1947–48 season. They played each other state only once a season at first, then beginning in 1956–57 they began playing each state twice, like the other teams.

Since joining the Sheffield Shield in 1947–48, Western Australia has won the competition 16 times, second only to New South Wales in that period. In the One-Day Cup, the team leads the winners table comfortably with 17 wins followed by New South Wales with twelve wins.
The state has a history of producing Australian Test players such as Justin Langer, Dennis Lillee, Adam Gilchrist, Michael Hussey, Terry Alderman and Geoff Marsh, along with Shaun Marsh, Marcus North, Adam Voges, and Mitchell Marsh in recent times. Englishman Tony Lock also represented his country in the 1967–68 season as a WA player – he was no longer attached to any English county.

Aside from test players, several Western Australian players have recently made their international debut in other forms of the game, such as Joel Paris with his One Day International debut, and Andrew Tye with his debut in international Twenty20 cricket.

Langer was appointed as coach of WA, along with the Perth Scorchers, in late 2012 and oversaw a period of success after almost a decade without silverware. Langer&#x27;s Warriors won the 2014–15 One-Day Cup, while the side were Sheffield Shield runners-up in both 2013–14 and 2014–15. The Scorchers also went back-to-back in the Big Bash League in 2013–14 and 2014–15 along with a further title 2016–17.

Following Langer’s appointment as Australian coach in 2018, recently retired captain and former test batsmen Adam Voges was selected as the Warriors new coach. Under Voges watch, WA won the 2019-20 One-Day Cup, but its struggles in ending its Sheffield Shield drought continued. They still produced more International players during this time, but mainly in limited overs cricket, with Jhye Richardson and Cameron Green both making test debuts in recent years.

The summer of 2021–22 became a highly successful summer for WA, winning another One-Day Cup (its second in three years with a win over New South Wales and fourth in a decade), while the Scorchers also took home its fourth BBL title, both being achieved despite being on the road for several weeks due to COVID-19 restrictions preventing both teams to play at home despite finishing first in both competitions. The Sheffield Shield, the one title that eluded WA for 23 years, was ended in a home draw against Victoria but won on first innings bonus points. Shaun Marsh captained the team to victory 21 years after his first-class debut.

== Honours ==

* Sheffield Shield (18)
1948, 1968, 1972, 1973, 1975, 1977, 1978, 1981, 1984, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1992, 1998, 1999, 2021, 2022, 2023

==Identity==
The Western Australian team’s uniform has largely remained unchanged with a black baggy cap used for its Sheffield Shield uniform, and a gold shirt with black trousers used for its One-Day Cup uniform. Previously, the WA team wore a predominantly black uniform for the former state based Big Bash competition. The team is currently sponsored by Healthway WA&#x27;s alcohol health problem related program, &quot;Alcohol: Think Again&quot;, after being associated with electronics retailer Retravision for over 20 years.

Prior to adopting a nickname, the Western Australian team was known under the state&#x27;s name or the WACA name. In 1995, the ACB announced that all state cricket associations, including the WACA, would give their state teams nicknames, with the Warriors name chosen for the WA men’s team due to the state team&#x27;s history of being resilient.

In 2014, following a rebrand for the WACA, the team returned to using baggy black caps, after using baggy gold caps since the 1970s. The rest of the teams uniform remained unchanged. 

In 2019, the WACA announced that the Warriors nickname, along with the Fury name for the women&#x27;s team, would be discontinued for both teams.

<text>Mixiuhca is a metro station along Line 9 of the Mexico City Metro serving the Jardín Balbuena and Colonia Magdalena Mixiuhca districts in the Venustiano Carranza borough of Mexico City, Mexico.

The station&#x27;s icon is a silhouette of a woman holding a newborn baby. In the Nahuatl language &quot;mixiuhca&quot; means &quot;place of births&quot;. The origin of this name comes from one of the Aztecs&#x27; migration stories. When the Aztecs first came to the Valley of Mexico, they lived for a long time in a place called Tizapan. However, they were violently expelled from there. Legend states that they ran out to the surrounding swamps using their shields and spears as rafts for the women and children. They ran across three places: Mexicaltzingo, Iztacalco and Temazcaltitlán, and precisely there, in that last place, one of the women gave birth to a child. From then on, the name of that place became Mixiuhca.

The station was opened on 26 August 1987. From 23 April to 21 June 2020, the station was temporarily closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico.

<doc id="1327447" wikidata="Q702523" url="?curid=1327447" title="Legend of Chun Hyang">
<text>is a manga by Clamp. Its story and characters are loosely based on a well known Korean folktale of the same name.

&quot;Shin Shunkaden&quot; was first published in 1996 by Hakusensha in Japan.

The project was dropped after three chapters, but Tokyopop licensed the manga in English as &quot;The Legend of Chun Hyang&quot; and released it in 2004.

==Plot==
The story follows Chun Hyang (춘향), the spirited, beautiful, yet headstrong daughter of a mudang in a Korean village. Her name means &quot;spring fragrance&quot; (the &quot;shun-ka&quot; in the original Japanese title; Chinese: &quot;Chūn-Xiāng&quot;). A master of martial arts, Chun Hyang rises to the occasion when the Yangban, a tyrannical warlord, takes control of her village. He tried to kidnap one of her friends despite Chun Hyang&#x27;s bold nature and formidable abilities, but there is little hope of freeing her village unless the amhaeng&#x27;eosa, a secret Korean government agent, arrives and catches the Ryanban in the act of abusing his powers.

When Mong Ryong, a somewhat lecherous but enchantingly handsome traveler appears, and apparently has fallen heads over heels with Chun Hyang, she reluctantly accepts his help to rescue her mother, who has been captured by the Ryanban.

Unfortunately, they are too late; Chun Hyang&#x27;s mother has already killed herself to preserve her honor. Mong Ryong reveals himself the amhaeng&#x27;eosa and passes judgment on the Ryanban, though remains rueful that he could not do so before Wall Mae&#x27;s death. Devastated, Chun Hyang does not know what else to do with her life, but Mong Ryong asks her to continue traveling with him. She agrees and they continue on, meeting many more people.

==Characters==

*Chun Hyang 
:Chun Hyang is a free-spirited, beautiful yet headstrong daughter of Myonfa. She is 14 years old and she is extremely good in martial arts. She is very protective of her mother and her father has died when she was young.

*Wol Mae

*Mong Ryong 
:A handsome traveler who flirts with women, including Chun Hyang, much to her displeasure.

==Development==
Clamp—a creative team consisting of Satsuki Igarashi, Nanase Ohkawa, Tsubaki Nekoi and Mokona—wrote and illustrated the &quot;Legend of Chun Hyang&quot;, after receiving a request for a mystery series that did not necessarily have to be a detective story. Ohkawa had been familiar with the original Korean folktale since kindergarten. The group had obtained some Korean books while in Osaka, and after reading the folktale, Ohkawa wanted to create a manga based on it. As the original heroine of the folktale represented an ideal, &quot;faithful wife&quot; and did not really appeal to Ohkawa, the group thought that it would not translate well into a manga; they gave their Chun Hyang a different personality, with her mother&#x27;s being more faithful to the original. The group felt that the second chapter was more accurate than the first, after they had worn traditional Korean clothing and obtained reference material.

The first chapter was illustrated with a brush, after the group had experimented with the technique for their supernatural manga &quot;Shirahime-Syo&quot; (1992), although they found it difficult to convey the background during scenes of magic. As the second chapter was illustrated with a magic marker, the group had wanted to redraw the first chapter for the bound-volume release, but ultimately decided against it. The series ended prematurely after the manga magazine it was being serialized in was discontinued, although the group expressed an interest in continuing it.

==Media==
===Manga===
Written and illustrated by Clamp, the chapters of &quot;Legend of Chun Hyang&quot; appeared as a periodic serial in the manga magazine &quot;Serie Mystery Special&quot;, beginning on October 20, 1992. The next chapter appeared on August 20, 1993, and the last chapter appeared on February 20, 1994. Hakusensha compiled the chapters into a bound volume and published it on December 15, 1996.

In 2003, Tokyopop announced that it had licensed &quot;Legend of Chun Hyang&quot; for an English-language translation in North America, and published it on August 10, 2004. In late May 2011, Tokyopop&#x27;s North American publishing branch ceased operations, with all of its Japanese manga licenses returned. The manga has also been translated into French by Glėnat.

===Audio drama===
There was a drama CD released in 1994. The script for the drama CD was written by CLAMP.

* Release date: November 30, 1994

The cast are:

* Chun Hyang - Yuri Shiratori
* Myonfa - Yūko Nagashima
* Mong Ryong - Ryōtarō Okiayu
* Hyantan - Masako Ikeda
* Ryanban - Mugihito
* Ryanban&#x27;s son - Nobuo Tobita

There was also a CD single released in Japan and the song was also included in the CLAMPAZAR Limited Edition Soundtrack.
Lyrics by: Nanase Ohkawa
Arrangement and composition: Kazuhiko Tōyama
Song by: Eiko Yamane

==Reception and legacy==
It placed 58th on the list of the top 100 bestselling graphic novels for July 2004, with 1,629 copies sold.

Liann Cooper of Anime News Network reviewed &quot;Legend of Chun Hyang&quot; positively, writing that its humor and art was characteristic of Clamp. In his review for &quot;Kliatt&quot;, George Galuschak praised the manga as &quot;high quality&quot;, with well-done artwork and &quot;simple and moving&quot; plots which centered around &quot;honor and sacrifice&quot;.

===Crossovers===
Chun Hyang or Chun&#x27;yan appears in several episodes of the anime &quot;&quot;. Her counterpart is a girl whose mother was also a Mu Dang and killed by the Ryanban&#x27;s sorceress. The Ryanban and his son appear, though they are much different from their respective counterparts in &quot;The Legend of Chun Hyang&quot;.

Chun&#x27;yan appears as a primary character in the country of Koryo and then makes cameo appearances as a contestant in the Dragonfly Race in Piffle World, piloting the Renhi (Lotus Princess) racer. In the anime adaption, she makes an additional cameo as a student in a world where everyone is a chibi character.

<doc id="1327448" wikidata="Q2925375" url="?curid=1327448" title="Brighton Park, Chicago">
<text>Brighton Park is a community area located on the southwest side of Chicago, Illinois. It is number 58 of the 77 community areas of Chicago.

Brighton Park is bordered on the north by the former Illinois and Michigan Canal and the current Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal, on the east by Western Avenue, on the south by 49th Street, and on the west by Drake Ave.

The neighborhood is a mix of residential areas, commercial zones, industrial works and transportation (primarily railroad and trucking) facilities. It is relatively peaceful, according to Chicago Police Department statistics (2004 CPD Annual Report).

==History==
After the expulsion of the Potawatomi, the land in what is now Brighton Park was platted and subdivided in anticipation of the opening of the Illinois-Michigan Canal. In the 1850s, private investors, notably John McCaffrey bought it with the hopes of turning it into a center of commerce. In 1851, the area was incorporated as a municipality. Named Brighton to invoke livestock markets in, among other places, the Brighton neighborhood of Boston and its livestock markets. Brighton Park had an active livestock market in the late 1850s, but it was overshadowed by the Union Stock Yards in the 1860s. In 1855, Chicago mayor &quot;Long&quot; John Wentworth built the Brighton Park horse racetrack (whose name conveniently alluded to the more famous Brighton Racecourse in England) directly east of the village, in what is now the Chicago Park District&#x27;s McKinley Park. The Great Chicago Fire spared Brighton Park. In 1889, after Lake Township voted to allow for annexation, Brighton Park became part of the City of Chicago.

By 1871, the year of the Great Chicago Fire, Brighton Park was served by the Archer Avenue horsecar and the Alton Railroad. (Brighton Park was not affected by the fire). The railroad built a roundhouse in the neighborhood, and various factories were built. Later the streetcar was electrified and extended and interurban electric railway service was provided by the Chicago and Joliet Electric Railway until 1934. Most of the residential buildings now in Brighton Park were built in the early part of the 20th century, between 1905 and 1925, after more electric streetcar lines (on Western Ave, Kedzie Ave, 35th St and 47th St) had been extended into the neighborhood, providing cheap and quick transport to work.

By the turn of the century, Brighton Park was becoming a destination for many European immigrants, particularly those arriving from Italy, Poland and Lithuania. The neighborhood&#x27;s Polish identity was evidenced along Archer Avenue, which became the neighborhood&#x27;s main street for Polish owned businesses.

==Transportation==
Chicago&#x27;s role as transportation gateway has always been a major influence on the demographics and economy of Brighton Park. Two major railroad landmarks exist in Brighton Park. The Corwith Intermodal freight facility, once known as Corwith Yards, covering nearly a square mile, is one of the major industrial features of Brighton Park.
Brighton Park crossing, near Western Avenue and Archer Avenue, is a major Chicago railroad junction and the former site of Brighton Park&#x27;s railway station.

Access to, property values, and economic growth in the neighborhood have been improved by the 1964 opening of the Stevenson Expressway, Interstate 55, the 1993 opening of the Orange Line rapid transit line, and the revitalization of the nearby Midway International Airport.

==Government and infrastructure==

The United States Postal Service operates the Elsdon Post Office at 3124 West 47th Street. Post Office is closed as of June 2010. The neighborhood branch of the Chicago Public Library is located at 4314 South Archer Avenue.

The neighborhood has the headquarters of the Chicago Park District.

==Politics==
The Brighton Park community area has supported the Democratic Party in past presidential elections. In the 2016 presidential election, the Brighton Park cast 6,930 votes for Hillary Clinton and cast
842 votes for Donald Trump (85.63% to 10.40%). In the 2012 presidential election, Brighton Park cast 5,699 votes for Barack Obama and cast 874 votes for Mitt Romney (85.47% to 13.11%).

Portions of Brighton Park are located in the 12th, 14th, and 15th wards represented on the Chicago City Council by Julia Ramirez, Jeylú Gutiérrez, and Ray Lopez respectively. Lopez serves as the Democratic Committeemen for his ward, while Cook County Board of Review Commissioner George Cardenas serves as the Democratic Committeeman for the 12th war, and State Representative Aaron Ortiz serves as the Democratic Committeeman for the 14th ward. Rosa Pritchett is Lopez&#x27;s Republican counterpart in the 15th ward while the 12th and 14th ward have no Republican committeeman.

==Education==
Chicago Public Schools operate the following public schools: Burroughs School, CPS Brighton Park School, Calmeca Academy, Columbia Explorers School, N. Davis School, Gunsaulus Scholastic Academy, Shields Elementary, and Shields Middle School.

The Acero Charter School Network operates the Sandra Cisneros School, Acero Brighton Park School and the Officer Donald J. Marquez School in Brighton Park.

<text>Barranca del Muerto is the southern terminus of Line 7 of the Mexico City Metro. It is located in the Álvaro Obregón borough. In 2019, the station had an average ridership of 45,703 passengers per day, making it the busiest station in Line 7.

==Name and pictogram==
The metro station is named after Avenida Barranca del Muerto, which was once a big depression, and is the same length as the actual avenue &quot;(barranca&quot; means gully or ravine). During the Mexican Revolution (1910–1921) this was a place where revolutionary soldiers dropped many corpses. Eagles and buzzards flew nearby, smelling rotten flesh. Popular imagination refers to the dead people&#x27;s souls and ghosts restlessly promenading near that big hole. Thus, Barranca del Muerto means &quot;Canyon of the Dead&quot;.

The station&#x27;s pictogram depicts two eagles, although some say buzzards.

==History==
Metro Barranca del Muerto was opened on 19 December 1985, together with the whole long extension stretch of Line 7 from Tacubaya.

This station was supposed to be a provisional terminal. According to original plans, Line 7 would be extended south and reach as far as San Jerónimo. Nevertheless, such plans never materialized, and Barranca del Muerto has been Line 7 southern terminus since.

Recently, in 2017, mayors from the Álvaro Obregón and Magdalena Contreras municipalities, have asked Mexico City&#x27;s government to pick up the project again and continue with the southern expansion of the line to San Jerónimo, that would benefit around 500,000 inhabitants of both municipalities.

==General information==
Metro Barranca del Muerto is located at the intersection of Avenida Revolución and Avenida Barranca del Muerto, on the border of the Álvaro Obregón and Benito Juárez municipalities.

The station has two separate platforms, one used for arriving trains and another one for departing trains. The exit is at the middle of the platforms. There are two exits located at the intersection of Avenida Revolución (which leads further to San Ángel), Macedonio Alcala, and Calle Alfonso Caso.

South of Barranca del Muerto, there is a Saturday market at the famous San Jacinto square (Bazar de los sábados de San Jacinto) where artists sell paintings, plants and other handcrafts.

Metro Barranca del Muerto, like many stations in the Metro network, has a cyber center, where users can access the internet through a computer; the service is free. The station also has a cultural display and the sculptural mural &quot;Visión del Mictlán&quot; by Luis Y. Aragón, which is located right outside the east access to the station.

The station serves the Guadalupe Inn and Los Alpes neighborhoods.

<text>Ferrería/Arena Ciudad de México (; formerly Ferrería) is a station along Line 6 of the Mexico City Metro. It is located in the Azcapotzalco municipality, in the north of Mexico City. In 2019, the station had an average ridership of 23,779 passengers per day.

==Name and iconography==
Before 2012, the station was known only as Ferrería and its icon depicted the head of a cow. This was a reference to a cattle ranch that existed nearby, known as Ferrería; there was also a train station that serviced this ranch.

In 2012, the Arena Ciudad de México was inaugurated, built-in part of the grounds of the former Hacienda Ferrería and within walking distance of the Ferrería station. The name of the station was then changed on 29 November 2012 from Ferrería to Ferrería/Arena Ciudad de México. The pictogram was also modified, with the new icon depicting the stylized façade of the Mexico City Arena.

==General information==

Metro Ferrería/Arena Ciudad de México runs under Avenida Antigua Calzada de Guadalupe and serves the Colonia Santa Catarina neighbourhood. The station was opened on 21 December 1983.

The station connects with the Fortuna station, servicing the Ferrocarril Suburbano, through an underground tunnel.

<text>David A. Brancaccio (; born May 17, 1960) is an American radio and television journalist. He is the host of the public radio business program &quot;Marketplace Morning Report&quot; and the PBS newsmagazine &quot;Now&quot;.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Brancaccio was born in New York City and grew up in Waterville, Maine. His father is Italian American and his mother is Ashkenazi Jewish American. He began his career in broadcasting on WTVL radio in 1976 at the age of fifteen. He received a Bachelor of Arts in African Studies and History from Wesleyan University in 1982 and a master&#x27;s in journalism from Stanford University in 1988. He traveled widely, spending his fourth grade in Rome, his ninth grade in Fort Dauphin, Madagascar and his senior year in college in Legon, Ghana.

===Career===
In 1989, Brancaccio began contributing to the public radio program &quot;Marketplace&quot;. He was first named as the program&#x27;s European editor based in London. Brancaccio became senior editor and host of &quot;Marketplace&quot; in 1993. From London, Brancaccio also contributed diplomatic and feature coverage for the radio service of the Christian Science Monitor. During Brancaccio&#x27;s tenure as host, &quot;Marketplace&quot; received the DuPont-Columbia Award (1998) and the George Foster Peabody Award (2001). He anchored the television newsmagazine, &quot;California Connected&quot;, that aired on many Californian PBS stations, from 2002 to 2003.

In 2003, Brancaccio left &quot;Marketplace&quot; to join Bill Moyers on &quot;Now&quot;. Brancaccio was co-host for over a year prior to Moyers&#x27; retirement at the end of 2004. On his last &quot;Now&quot; broadcast, Moyers had this to say about Brancaccio:

Among his beats: business innovation and the economy, politics, human rights, national security, the environment, health care, and science policy.

In 2007, Brancaccio won a national Emmy for coverage of a public health story in Kenya. In 2009, he won a Walter Cronkite Award for excellence in television political coverage. He also holds the David Brower award for Environmental Coverage from the Sierra Club. In 2005, Brancaccio conducted the last, long-form television interview with the legendary author Kurt Vonnegut. The last episode of &quot;Now&quot; was broadcast April 30, 2010.

Brancaccio is a contributor to several broadcast, electronic, and print media, including CNN, CNBC, MSNBC, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;The Nightly Business Report&quot;, &quot;Wall Street Week with Fortune&quot;, &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; and &quot;Psychology Today&quot;. In 2000, his book, &quot;Squandering Aimlessly&quot;, was published, his account of a pilgrimage across America to learn how Americans apply their personal values to their money. He also lectures widely about the future of the economy and the role of journalism in a democracy.

Brancaccio&#x27;s documentary film &quot;Fixing the Future&quot;, directed by Emmy winning filmmaker Ellen Spiro, exploring more sustainable options for the economy, was released in theaters in 2012.

In 2011, Brancaccio returned to American Public Media&#x27;s &quot;Marketplace&quot; as a correspondent covering new economy issues and tech/innovation. He is now host and senior editor of the popular business program &quot;The Marketplace Morning Report&quot; from 6:51 am Eastern to 7:51 am Pacific on public radio stations nationwide.

===Personal life===
Brancaccio lives in South Orange, New Jersey, with his wife, Mary, an educator and poet. He is an avid photographer and bicyclist.

In 2025, he discussed the loss of his cottage in Altadena, California due to the Eaton Fire.

<text>Kutus is a town in Kirinyaga County, Kenya, serving as the county&#x27;s administrative headquarters.

==Geography==
Kutus, forming part of the Kerugoya/Kutus municipality, is the county headquarters of Kirinyaga. The municipality, which also includes the township of Kerugoya, has a combined population of 39,441, with 14,056 classified as urban (based on the 1999 census).

The municipality comprises six wards: Kerugoya Central, Kerugoya North, Kerugoya South, Kutus South, Kutus Central, and Nduini. Most of these wards fall under the Kerugoya/Kutus Constituency (also known as Kirinyaga Central Constituency).

==Etymology==
The name &#x27;Kutus&#x27; evolved from the original term &#x27;Mūcakūthi&#x27;, used by many locals to this day. The town was initially named after its founding chief, Gūtū (the Kikuyu word for &#x27;Ear&#x27;). Over time, &#x27;Gūtū&#x27;s&#x27; place transformed linguistically, influenced by the Gichugu Dialect, into &#x27;Kutus&#x27;, aligning with the English possessive form (&#x27;s). Thus, &#x27;Kutus&#x27; implies belonging to Gūtū.

<text>The National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE) is a society that was founded in 1975 at Purdue University, located in West Lafayette, Indiana. It is one of the largest student-run organizations in the United States, with core activities centered on improving the recruitment and of Black and other minority engineers in both academia and industry.

== Activity ==
NSBE has more than 30,000 members worldwide, 18 regional conferences, an annual international conference, an annual national convention, and offers multiple scholarships. NSBE also represents 310 collegiate student chapters, 99 pre-college programs, and 88 professional chapters with their 6,000 technical members. NSBE is divided into 6 regions, and each have their own regional conferences. A professional staff operates NSBE&#x27;s World Headquarters in Virginia. Janeen Uzzell was hired as CEO in July 2021.

==Origins==
In 1971, two Purdue undergraduates, Edward Barnette and Fred Cooper founded the Black Society of Engineers (BSE) with faculty advisor Arthur J. Bond. The BSE was founded in response to the 80% drop out rate of Black freshmen in engineering programs in the 1960s. The club&#x27;s goals were to improve the recruitment and retention of black engineering students. Bond noted that &quot;you would never see another black student from the day you entered Purdue until you graduated. So, we didn&#x27;t know what other black student was studying engineering,&quot; and wanted to create a society that could help with representation. After the success of the society at Purdue, it later went national.

The Purdue chapter held the first national annual meeting in April 1975 with 135 students representing 28 schools. There, the group was renamed to the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE) and formally incorporated as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit. John Carson was elected as the first president, and in 1978, Virginia Booth became the national chair.

NSBE later formed a Professional sector, as well as a Junior sector. NSBE&#x27;s Summer Engineering Experience for Kids (SEEK) is now in its 18th year, helping elementary school students enjoy the world of engineering. In 1992, the first international chapter was launched. NSBE has chapters at more than 700 universities and colleges in the United States, and internationally.

==Publications==
NSBE publishes three magazines for its membership: 
* &quot;NSBE Magazine&quot;, its award-winning, flagship publication that offers feature articles of interest to engineering college students, faculty, and technical experts. 
* &quot;Bridge Magazine&quot;, marketed toward a pre-collegiate, younger audience to pique their interest in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics). 
* &quot;Career Engineer&quot;, which offers the latest industry news, cutting-edge technology, and strategies for work-life balance.
