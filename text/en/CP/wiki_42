<text>Kenneth Edward Cunningham (born 28 June 1971) is an Irish former footballer who played as a defender. He played international football for the Republic of Ireland until his retirement in 2005. He spent his professional club career, from 1989 to 2007, in England, making more than 500 appearances in the Football League and Premier League playing for Millwall, Wimbledon, Birmingham City and Sunderland.

After retirement as a professional player, he worked as a pundit for RTÉ Sport, and successfully completed the UEFA Pro Licence coaching qualification in 2011.

==Early life and career==
Cunningham was born in Dublin. He attended St. Vincent&#x27;s C.B.S. primary and secondary school in the Glasnevin district. At school, he played more Gaelic football than soccer: he played for St Vincent&#x27;s at Croke Park alongside future Gaelic star Dessie Farrell in a schools&#x27; final, and played for Na Fianna and the Dublin minor team. At association football, he played for the Home Farm club from under-9s to under-17s, before moving on to amateur club Tolka Rovers.

==Club career==
===Millwall===
On 18 September 1989, the 18-year-old Cunningham signed a one-year contract with Millwall of the English First Division. His expectations, to play out the season in England and use the experience to earn himself a good contract back in Ireland, changed when, three months before the end of that &quot;trial&quot; season, Millwall offered him a further two-year contract. He made his Football League debut on 17 March 1990, at right back in the starting eleven in a 1–1 draw away to Norwich City, and started four more first-team games during that season. In five years with the club, he made 136 league appearances. scoring his only career goal at Portsmouth in April 1994.

===Wimbledon===
Cunningham and teammate Jon Goodman moved to Wimbledon in November 1994, for the joint fee of £1,300,000. Cunningham played 250 league games for Wimbledon and twice named as the London side&#x27;s Player of the Season. In February 2000, Cunningham was involved in an incident with Chelsea captain Dennis Wise following their match. Cunningham admitted improper behaviour in response to severe provocation from Wise and was fined £5,000 by The Football Association. Wise was charged with misconduct for the alleged confrontation in the tunnel and fined £7,500 and Chelsea and Wimbledon were both fined £50,000 each for failing to control their players.

===Birmingham City===
Cunningham moved to Birmingham City, newly promoted to the Premier League, in 2002 for a £600,000 fee. He went straight into the starting eleven, playing at centre back in place of injured captain Steve Vickers rather than his customary right back. He formed a fine defensive partnership with Matthew Upson, who joined in the January transfer window, and at the end of that campaign, his teammates chose him as their Player of the Season.

After the first few matches of 2003–04, Birmingham&#x27;s manager Steve Bruce was describing Cunningham as &quot;on current form ... the best defender in the Premiership&quot;. Nicknamed &quot;King Kenny&quot; by the fans, Cunningham had a reputation as an organised solid defender, and Manchester United and Ireland full-back Denis Irwin suggested in November 2003 that, though his ability had been under-rated in the past, &quot;this year ... people are realising how good he actually is&quot;.

After the club&#x27;s relegation at the end of the 2005–06 Premier League season, Cunningham and seven other first team players were released. On 11 May 2006, Cunningham launched a scathing attack in the press on Bruce and the board, blaming the club&#x27;s relegation on a lack of preparation throughout the season and likening the club to a &quot;stiff corpse&quot; that has &quot;no heartbeat and, more worryingly, no soul&quot;. While fans were in the main supportive of Cunningham&#x27;s views, the club reacted furiously, and chairman David Gold wondered &quot;if Kenny would have said the same things if we&#x27;d stayed up, Portsmouth had gone down and he&#x27;d been given a lucrative new contract&quot;.

===Sunderland===
Cunningham signed for Sunderland on 19 July 2006 with Sunderland chairman Niall Quinn praising his leadership qualities. He made 11 appearances for the Black Cats as they won the Championship, but no more appearances after October when he was made captain by manager Roy Keane before sustaining an injury. He was released at the end of the season, and retired as a player.

==International career==
Cunningham won a total of 72 caps for the Republic of Ireland national football team. He made his debut on 24 April 1996 in 2–0 friendly loss to the Czech Republic in Prague.

He was named as FAI Senior International Player of the Year in 1998.

In March 2001, he returned after a long layoff due to injury, replacing Richard Dunne to partner Gary Breen in defence for a match against Cyprus. Cunningham was named team captain after the 2002 FIFA World Cup. According to manager Mick McCarthy: &quot;Kenny&#x27;s qualities as a player are easy to see. From day one he has been a great influence. He is a talker on the pitch, he organises the players around him, and off the pitch he is a calm influence.

He retired from international football after achieving 72 caps at the age of 34 on 12 October 2005, following Ireland&#x27;s draw with Switzerland at Lansdowne Road, which resulted in his team&#x27;s failure to qualify for the 2006 FIFA World Cup.

Cunningham urged caution following a FIFA rule change allowing players over the age of 21 to switch their international allegiance. Commenting in relation to Ireland&#x27;s qualifying campaign ahead of the 2010 FIFA World Cup, he said: &quot;It wouldn&#x27;t be something I&#x27;d be hugely in favour of&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;d be very disappointed if I was a player in that squad to miss out on the World Cup for somebody who was jumping on board at the last minute&quot;.

==After football==
Cunningham has worked as a pundit on the Premier League and Champions League for both Setanta Ireland and Premier Sports, on RTÉ Sport&#x27;s coverage of the League of Ireland and for Sky Sports&#x27;s coverage of Ireland matches. He coached at English non-league club Nuneaton Town, who won promotion in his first year there. before completing his UEFA Pro Licence in Ireland. He was appointed assistant to the League of Ireland XI manager Damien Richardson for the Dublin Super Cup tournament in 2011.
He covered tournaments including the 2013 Confederations Cup, 2014 World Cup, Euro 2016, and Euro 2020.

<doc id="1331205" wikidata="Q5432994" url="?curid=1331205" title="Families and How to Survive Them">
<text>Families and How to Survive Them is a bestselling self-help book co-authored by the psychiatrist and psychotherapist Robin Skynner and the comedian John Cleese. It was first published in 1983, and is illustrated throughout by the cartoonist J. B. Handelsman. The book takes the form of a series of dialogues between Skynner, playing the role of therapist, and Cleese, who adopts the role of inquisitive lay person.

The book was also serialised as a six-part radio series for the UK BBC station BBC Radio 4, with each episode being 30 minutes long. This was also in the form of a convivial conversation between Cleese and Skynner and following the same structure as the book, albeit in an abridged form. It was subsequently released on Compact Cassette and Compact Disc in a slightly modified form.

Its sequel is &quot;Life and How to Survive It&quot;.

== Synopsis ==
The book is a description and analysis of how and why we fall in love, how we develop from babies to adolescents to adults, and how during this development we so often become &quot;stuck&quot; in childlike behaviour, and how all these things are influenced by previous generations in our families. The authors themselves have said that the aim of the book was &quot;to make intelligible and accessible the psychological aspects of how families behave and function, what makes some work and others fail, and how families can move up the scale towards greater health and happiness&quot;.

The motivation behind it was to &quot;make available to the general public, in a way that was easy to absorb, those aspects of psychological knowledge we had found most helpful ourselves towards making life more understandable, meaningful, and enjoyable&quot;.

&quot;Families and How to Survive Them&quot; may be said to have arisen from two sources – an earlier book, &quot;One Flesh, Separate Persons: Principles of Family and Marital Therapy&quot; (1976) by Skynner, and work carried out by Skynner at the Institute of Family Therapy in London in the 1970s. Cleese, who attended a lengthy course of group therapy at the institute in the mid seventies, was so impressed by what he experienced that, motivated by a desire to spread what lay behind the therapy to a wider audience, proposed to Skynner that they write a book summarising and outlining the principles involved.

==Chapters==
* Chapter 1: Why Did I Have to Marry You?
* Chapter 2: I&#x27;m God, and Let&#x27;s Leave it Like That – In the extensive further reading section at the end of the book, Skynner acknowledges that this chapter &quot;depends heavily on the ideas of Melanie Klein, founder of &quot;The English School of Psychoanalysis&quot;&quot;.
* Chapter 3: The Astonishing Stuffed Rabbit
* Chapter 4: Who&#x27;s in Charge Here?
* Chapter 5: What are You Two Doing in There?

<doc id="1331214" wikidata="Q579845" url="?curid=1331214" title="Lou Gramm">
<text>Louis Andrew Grammatico (born May 2, 1950), known professionally as Lou Gramm, is an American singer and songwriter. He is best known as co-founder and lead vocalist of the rock band Foreigner from 1976 to 1990 and again from 1992 to 2003, during which time the band had numerous successful albums and singles. 

He is considered among the greatest and most successful rock vocalists of the late 1970s and 1980s. He co-wrote most of Foreigner&#x27;s hits with bandmate Mick Jones. Together, they are inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame class of 2013. In 2024, Gramm was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Foreigner.

==Early life==
Gramm was born on May 2, 1950, in Rochester, New York, the son of Nikki (born Masetta), a singer, and Bennie Grammatico, a band leader and trumpeter. He attended Gates-Chili High School in Rochester, graduating with the class of 1968, and majored in education and art at Monroe Community College.

==Career==
===1970s===
Gramm became front man for the band Black Sheep. Black Sheep was the first American band signed to the Chrysalis label, which released their first single, &quot;Stick Around&quot; (1974). Soon after this initial bit of success, Black Sheep signed with Capitol Records, releasing two albums in succession: &quot;Black Sheep&quot; (1975) and &quot;Encouraging Words&quot; (late 1975). They were the opening act for Kiss when an accident with their equipment truck on the ice-covered New York State Thruway suddenly ended the band&#x27;s tour on Christmas Eve, 1975. Unable to support its albums with live performances, Black Sheep disbanded.

A year earlier, Gramm met his future bandmate Mick Jones. Jones was in Rochester New York performing with the band Spooky Tooth, and Gramm had given Jones a copy of Black Sheep&#x27;s first album (&quot;S/T&quot;). It was early in 1976, not long after Black Sheep&#x27;s truck accident, when Jones, in search of a lead singer for a new band he was assembling, expressed his interest in Gramm and invited him to audition.

Gramm traveled to New York to audition and got the job. Lou Grammatico then became Lou Gramm. The band, which was initially known as &quot;Trigger,&quot; was later renamed &quot;Foreigner&quot;. With Foreigner, Gramm became one of the most successful rock vocalists of the late 1970s and 1980s.

===1980s===

Foreigner&#x27;s first eight singles cracked the Billboard Top 20, making them the first band since The Beatles to achieve this milestone. Gramm performed vocals on all of Foreigner&#x27;s hits including &quot;Urgent&quot;, &quot;Juke Box Hero&quot;, &quot;Break It Up&quot;, &quot;Say You Will&quot;, and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Live Without You&quot;. He co-wrote most of the band&#x27;s songs, including the hit ballads &quot;Waiting for a Girl Like You&quot;, which spent ten weeks at #2 on the 1981/82 American Hot 100, and &quot;I Want to Know What Love Is&quot;, which was a number one hit in eight countries.

Gramm and Jones had a volatile chemistry. Gramm wanted the band to remain true to its purer rock origins, favoring music with a solid drum and guitar structure, whereas Jones embraced the 1980s style of synthesizer ballads. Gramm has called the &quot;4&quot; album (1981) the high point of his work with Foreigner. Foreigner&#x27;s next album, &quot;Agent Provocateur&quot; (1984), took three years to release due to the ongoing creative differences between Jones and Gramm. The band released &quot;Inside Information&quot; in 1987.

Gramm released his first solo album, &quot;Ready or Not&quot;, in January 1987 to critical acclaim. The single &quot;Midnight Blue&quot; reached the top five.

Also in 1987, Gramm contributed the song &quot;Lost in the Shadows&quot; to the soundtrack for the comedy horror film &quot;The Lost Boys&quot;.

A second solo effort, &quot;Long Hard Look&quot; (October 1989), included the top ten hit &quot;Just Between You and Me&quot; as well as &quot;True Blue Love&quot;, reached the Top 40. The album also included &quot;Hangin&#x27; on My Hip&quot;, which was featured in the 1990 film &quot;Navy SEALs&quot;.

===1990s===
Gramm announced his departure from Foreigner in May 1990 due to differences with Jones, and to focus on his solo career.

Gramm also formed Shadow King with close friend and former Black Sheep bassist Bruce Turgon; their 1991 self-titled album was released by Atlantic Records. Despite positive reviews, the group did not enjoy the level of marketing and promotional support necessary to sustain a new project and soon disbanded. Also in 1991, Gramm contributed the song &quot;One Dream&quot; to the movie &quot;Highlander II: The Quickening&quot;.

Gramm rejoined Foreigner in May 1992 after working out his differences with Jones during the Los Angeles riots. In 1994, Foreigner released the album &quot;Mr. Moonlight&quot; on the Rhythm Safari label which, although relatively successful in Europe, was not as widely marketed or distributed in the U.S. Still, &quot;Until the End of Time&quot; made inroads at adult contemporary radio, peaking at number 8.

In 1996, Jones invited Gramm to perform backing vocals on a cover version of &quot;I Want to Know What Love Is&quot; he was producing for the Australian singer Tina Arena. The song went on to become a major hit again throughout Europe.

In 1997, Gramm provided vocals for Christian rock band Petra&#x27;s album entitled &quot;Petra Praise 2: We Need Jesus&quot;.

In April 1997, on the eve of a Japan tour, Gramm was diagnosed with a benign brain tumor and underwent surgery. He continued to work with Jones throughout his illness. By 1998, Gramm was back touring with Foreigner.

===2000s to present===
In early 2003, Gramm departed from Foreigner for good.

The Lou Gramm Band released a Christian rock album in 2009.

In May 2013, Lou released his autobiography &quot;Juke Box Hero - My Five Decades in Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;.

Gramm was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame on June 13, 2013. On July 20, 2017, Gramm joined Foreigner for three songs during an encore at Jones Beach Theatre in Long Island, New York. On December 29, 2018, Gramm announced on stage in Schenectady, New York that he was retiring from touring. However, he stated that he would continue to release studio music and perform occasional live shows including The Lopen, a celebrity concert produced by Howard Perl Entertainment to benefit children at Akron Children&#x27;s Hospital.

In 2019, Gramm toured on a bill with Asia Featuring John Payne, where they also acted as his backup group. Gramm performed lead vocals on the track &quot;Sometimes&quot; on the 2019 album &quot;The Secret&quot; by Alan Parsons.

Gramm told RockBandReviews.com in 2019 that he was planning to release some new solo material later that year. &quot;I&#x27;m working on some things now that were extra songs on my solo albums,&quot; he said. &quot;If there&#x27;s 10 songs on the album, you usually record 13 and pick the best 10, or the 10 that are finished. So the other three have been sitting around for 25, 30 years, and I went back recently and listened to them, and they sounded so good that I finished them. Starting in about two months, maybe three months, I will release three songs on downloads and see how that works out. So those songs will be heard for the first time. And then in another three or four months, there&#x27;s going to be three more new songs released. So that could be going on for six or eight months, and we&#x27;ll see what happens.&quot;

Gramm also said he is &quot;thinking about&quot; releasing a greatest-hits package of his non-Foreigner works.

In 2024, Gramm was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Foreigner alongside Mick Jones, Ian McDonald, Al Greenwood, Dennis Elliott, Ed Gagliardi, and Rick Wills. Coinciding with their upcoming induction, Foreigner released their new song &quot;Turning Back the Time&quot; with Gramm on the vocals which was recorded from the early 2000s. Gramm told Billboard earlier this year. “There were about eight or nine of them. We didn’t have a record company then, so we were waiting to see what happened. Then Mick and I had a huge falling out, and I left the band…. So now Mick’s got the copy and I don’t have one and I don’t know if he’s ever gonna do anything with them. I kind of doubt it, but I would like to at least listen to those roughs that we did. Those were great ideas.”

==Legacy==
Gramm is considered one of the greatest and most successful rock vocalists of all-time. Circus magazine in 1978 upon the release of Hot Blooded commented that Lou Gramm had a voice that Robert Plant might envy. Variety noted that Gramm is one of rock and roll&#x27;s premier vocalists. Gramm is ranked the second greatest Album-oriented Rock vocalists of all-time in a Louder article published on January 14, 2024.

==Personal life==
In 1992, Gramm, after having completed a stint in drug rehabilitation, became a born again Christian.

In April 1997, Gramm was diagnosed with a type of brain tumor called a craniopharyngioma. Although the tumor was benign, the resulting surgery damaged his pituitary gland. In addition, the recovery program had caused Gramm to gain weight and likewise affected his stamina and voice.

As of 2023, Gramm is back on tour with his band the Lou Gramm Allstars. He has new music in the works to be released soon. He enjoys spending time with his five children during his downtime. He is also touring under &quot;Lou Gramm, The Original Voice of Foreigner&quot; with John Payne&#x27;s Asia as his backing band playing solo and classic Foreigner hits.

<text>Buck Knives is an American knife brand and manufacturer founded in Mountain Home, Idaho and now located in Post Falls, Idaho. The company has a long history through five generations of the Buck family from 1902 to the present day. Buck Knives primarily manufactures sport and field knives and is credited with inventing the &quot;folding hunting knife&quot; and popularizing it to such a degree that the term &quot;buck knife&quot; has become associated with folding lockback knives, including those made by other manufacturers.

==History==

===Company origins===
Hoyt H. Buck became a blacksmith&#x27;s apprentice in Kansas in 1899 at the age of 10. He learned to make knives and at 13, in 1902, developed a method to heat-treat steel for hoes and other tools so that they would hold an edge longer. Hoyt left Kansas in 1907 for the American northwest and eventually enlisted in the United States Navy. He made his first knife in 1902 in Mountain Home, Idaho. Hoyt made each knife by hand, using worn-out file blades as raw material. Collectors call these early knives &quot;four strikes,&quot; because each of the letters in BUCK was struck with an individual letter stamp. In 1961, marking was replaced by a one-piece stamp.

When the United States entered World War II, the government asked the public for donations of fixed-bladed knives to arm the troops. Upon learning that there were not enough knives for soldiers, Hoyt Buck bought an anvil, forge, and grinder to set up a blacksmith shop in the basement of his church. Hoyt later explained, &quot;I didn&#x27;t have any knives [to offer], but I sure knew how to make them&quot;.

After World War 2, Hoyt and his son, Al, moved to San Diego and set up shop as &quot;H.H. Buck &amp; Son&quot; in 1947. These early knives were handmade and more expensive than a typical mass-produced knife. Hoyt Buck made 25 knives a week until his death in 1949. In the 1950s, the company began manufacturing on a much larger scale and marketed through dealers as opposed to direct mail.

===The Model 110===
On April 18, 1963, two years after incorporating, the Buck board of directors authorized development of a new folding utility and hunting knife. The new design featured a sturdy locking mechanism and a substantial clip point blade suitable for butchering and skinning large game. This became the famous Buck Model 110 Folding Hunter.

The Buck Model 110 has a 3–inch blade, a high-tension lock, and a low-pressure release; the handles are typically wood with bolsters of heavy-gauge brass. Introduced in 1964, it was one of the first lockback folding knives considered strong enough to do the work of a fixed-blade knife. Its debut revolutionized hunting knives, rapidly becoming one of the most popular knives ever made, with some 15 million Model 110 knives produced since 1964. Before 1981, the specially heat treated stainless steel used was 440C, and from 1981 to 1992 the company used 425M steel. Since 1993, Buck has mostly used 420HC stainless steel for Model 110 blades, although CPM S30V steel has also been used for some production runs. Its design is one of the most imitated knife patterns in the world.

In 2018, Buck introduced a new lightweight editions of the 110, a thick-handled FRN (fiberglass reinforced nylon) version called the LT. The new 110 Folding Hunter LT should impress anybody who found the original 110’s 7.2 oz. too much to carry. Carrying the same classic lines and Bos heat treat 420HC steel but in a lightweight injection-molded chassis, the LT tips the scales at a stunning 2.1 oz.- a weight reduction of over 300%. It also keeps the price down.

==Recent developments==
In 1984, Buck introduced a survival knife with a hollow handle for storage and a 7.5 inch blade with a serrated spine and prongs so the knife could double as a grappling hook. Dubbed the Buckmaster (Model 184), it was marketed to the military and fans of the &quot;Rambo&quot; films of the 1980s. The Buckmaster was soon followed by the M9 Bayonet manufactured for the United States Army, with an initial order of 315,600.

In 1992–1993, Buck introduced the Nighthawk, a fixed-blade knife with a 6.5 inch blade and a black handle made of Zytel for an ergonomic grip. This knife (Best M9) was submitted to the United States Marine Corps for evaluation for use by the Marines.

In 2000, due to a demand from major retailers to reduce prices, Buck opened a plant in China. Imports to the United States from this plant had reached a high of 30 percent at one time, but have dropped to 13 percent with the majority of these knives going to large retailers as opposed to sporting goods stores or knife shops.

In 2005, the company relocated to Post Falls, Idaho. Leaders of the San Diego business community considered this move a blow to San Diego County&#x27;s economic landscape and a symbol of the state of California&#x27;s problems in attracting and keeping businesses.

Buck Knives has collaborated with different custom knifemakers such as Tom Mayo, Mick Strider, David Yellowhorse and Rob Simonich.


Al and Chuck Buck were inducted into the &quot;Blade&quot; magazine Cutlery Hall of Fame at the 1982 and 1996 Blade Shows respectively in Atlanta, Georgia in recognition for the impact that their designs and company have made upon the cutlery industry. Buck&#x27;s heat treater, Paul Bos, who heat treats knives for other custom makers and production companies at Buck&#x27;s facility, was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2011.

==Products==
Buck&#x27;s first successful folding lock-blade was introduced in 1964. Folding lock-blade knives and &quot;Buck Knife&quot; thereby became strongly linked in the mind of the US public, and the Buck design was much imitated, so that in the United States a Buck knife can refer to any folding lock-blade design, even while Buck Knife is a trademark and not limited to folding lock-blades.

Today, Buck products are produced in countries including Mexico (e.g. sheathes) and China.

<doc id="1331222" wikidata="Q6545044" url="?curid=1331222" title="Life and How to Survive It">
<text>Life and How To Survive It is a self-help psychology book written by the therapist Robin Skynner and the comedian John Cleese. The book is written in a question and answer form, with Cleese asking questions about relationships, and his therapist Skynner answering them. It is the sequel to &quot;Families and How to Survive Them&quot;.

The book aims to answer questions both psychologically and sociologically about why the world is the way it is and how this affects individuals. The narrative takes the reader on a journey into hidden consciousness and tries to explain why and how relationships do or do not work. Concepts such as the three parts of the human psyche (Id, ego and super-ego) are explored.

At one stage in the book, Skynner describes his experiences with LSD as part of a research project and the effect that they had on his subsequent consciousness, particularly in terms of understanding a spiritual dimension of life and the interconnectedness of all phenomena within it - a sense that echoes much of the descriptions of mystical experiences collated in William James&#x27;s &quot;Varieties of Religious Experience&quot;.

<text>Anura Bandaranaike (15 February 1949 – 16 March 2008) was a Sri Lankan politician, who served as Speaker of the Parliament of Sri Lanka (2000-2001) and Leader of the Opposition (1983–1988). He held several cabinet ministries: as Foreign Minister briefly in 2005, Minister of Higher Education (1993–1994), Minister of Tourism (April 2004 – January 2007), and Minister of National Heritage (2007). He last served as a member of parliament from the opposition.

==Early life and family==

Born on February 15, 1949, at Tintagel, Rosmead Place, Colombo to Solomon West Ridgeway Dias Bandaranaike and Sirima Ratwatte Dias Bandaranaike. He was the youngest of three siblings and only son. His family has a long history in the socio-political arena of the country. His grandfather, Sir Solomon Dias Bandaranike was the Maha Mudaliyar (the chief native interpreter and advisor to the Governor) and his maternal grandfather Barnes Ratwatte Rate Mahatmaya, Dissawa of Sabaragamuwa during British colonial rule. Bandaranaike&#x27;s father Solomon West Ridgeway Dias Bandaranaike was at the time of his birth the Cabinet Minister of Health and Local Government and would become the fourth Prime Minister of Ceylon in 1956. He was assassinated on 26 September 1959, when young Anura was ten years old. His mother, took over the leadership of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party which was formed by her husband and became the first female prime minister in the world when she was appointed as Prime Minister of Ceylon in July 1960. He and his two elder sisters soon found themselves active in the party politics. His eldest sister Sunethra Bandaranaike, became a socialite and his other sister Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, later became the President of Sri Lanka.

==Education==
Bandaranaike completed his primary education at Royal Preparatory School and secondary education at the Royal College, Colombo where his contemporaries included Ranil Wickremesinghe and Dinesh Gunawardena. He then read Ancient and Modern History at the University of London, graduating with a BA Honours in 1973.

==Early political career==
Bandaranaike returned to Sri Lanka in 1974, when his mother was serving her second term as prime minister. He soon became active in the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, having been appointed leader of its Youth Wing and thereafter Director of the National Youth Services Council. He contested the 1977 general election from the Maskeliya multi-seat constituency from the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. Though the Sri Lanka Freedom Party faced a crushing defeat in the election, Bandaranaike was elected to parliament. He would remain a member of parliament till his death. Following the defeat of Sri Lanka Freedom Party government in July 1977, Bandaranaike sat in the opposition in parliament with his mother. The Sri Lanka Freedom Party became a minority in the opposition and A. Amirthalingam of the Tamil United Liberation Front became the leader of the opposition.

In October 1980, following an investigation by a Special Presidential Commission appointed by President J. R. Jayawardene found corruption and abuses of power, Sirima Bandaranaike and her nephew, Felix Dias Bandaranaike had their civil liberties stripped for a period of seven years by a motion in parliament. Sirima Bandaranaike remained the party leader, but Anura Bandaranaike became the de facto leader of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party parliamentarian group.

==Opposition leader==
With this backdrop, Anura Bandaranaike became the leader of the opposition in November 1983, when the incumbent Amirthalingam boycotted parliament and lost his seat in October 1983 while refusing swear an oath unconditionally renouncing support for a separate state. Bandaranaike served as leader of the opposition till 1988, holding a position once held by his father and mother before him.

==Rift within the party==
He contested the 1989 general election from the Gampaha Electoral District, which was the traditional base of the Bandaranaike family. Elected to parliament with preferential votes over one hundred thousand, he once again sat in the opposition with his mother who had regained her civic rights and became the leader of the opposition having been elected to parliament. He soon fell out with his mother and was suspended from the family party by Sirimavo Bandaranaike. The rift was aggravated by the return to the party of his sister Chandrika Kumaratunga who had left the family party in 1984 to join the Sri Lanka Mahajana Pakshaya formed by her husband Vijaya Kumaratunga. She then went into exile in London following Kumaratunga&#x27;s assassination.

==United National Party==
He crossed over to ruling United National Party in 1993 which appointed him Minister of Higher Education and National Reconciliation under President Dingiri Banda Wijetunge. Chandrika Kumaratunga won the 1994 general election becoming prime minister and thereafter won the presidential election to become president. Anura Bandaranaike, returned to the opposition from 1994 to 2000 as a National List member of parliament, he contested under the UNP ticket to Gampaha District at the 2000 General Elections and was reelected to the Parliament securing over 80000 preferential votes.

==Speaker of the Parliament==
He was elected uncontested as Speaker of the 11th Parliament and served from 18 October 2000 to 10 October 2001, when parliament was dissolved and fresh elections called.

==Return to the Sri Lanka Freedom Party==
He rejoined SLFP in 2001 to contest the elections in December that year, although the SLFP with its coalition faced a massive defeat Bandaranaike was elected to Parliament. When the SLFP led alliance of UPFA won the elections in 2004 with support of the JVP, Bandaranaike was reelected as a member of parliament to the Gampaha District and became Minister of Tourism, Industry and Investment in the new government. Following the assassination of foreign minister Lakshman Kadirgamar in August 2005, Bandaranaike was appointed as Foreign Minister, amidst increased tension throughout the country. He dropped his position as minister of industry and investment, but remained tourism minister. The party chose Mahinda Rajapakse over Bandaranaike as its candidate for the presidential election in 2005. Following Rajapakse&#x27;s election victory it had been widely predicted that Bandaranaike would be appointed Prime Minister or remain as foreign minister. However, Rajapakse appointed Ratnasiri Wickremanayake as prime minister since many saw Bandaranaike did not co-operate in the presidential campaign. He was slowly sidelined in the party as the Rajapakse bloc grew. However he was accused of playing a &quot;negative&quot;/&quot;non supportive&quot; role in the campaign and was offered only the tourism ministry instead. Even before the presidential elections in 2005, Anura was diagnosed to have a cancer. He recovered from the initial shock of the bad news but never recovered from the shock of having to accept the toothless National Heritage Portfolio in a cabinet reshuffle in January 2007. On 9 February 2007, he was sacked as the minister of national heritage, together with ministers Mangala Samaraweera and Sripathi Sooriyarachchi after falling out with the President Mahinda Rajapakse, the party leader. Less than two weeks later, after reconciling with Rajapakse, Bandaranaike agreed to come back into the government, again being sworn in as Minister of National Heritage. On 14 December 2007 he crossed over to the opposition benches thus leaving his ministerial posts. Despite being in politics for over a quarter of a century, he has only been in a governing side for about 5 years.
==Death==
Bandaranaike died on 16 March 2008 at &quot;Visumpaya,&quot; his official residence in Colombo, following a period of prolonged illness due to cancer. He had been diagnosed with cancer a few years before his death and had been hospitalized for several months. A few weeks prior to his death, he had taken three months leave from parliament.

<doc id="1331235" wikidata="Q1195344" url="?curid=1331235" title="Parental controls">
<text>Parental controls are features which may be included in digital television services, computers and video games, mobile devices and software that allow parents to restrict the access of content to their children. These controls were created to assist parents in their ability to restrict certain content viewable by their children. This may be content they deem inappropriate for their age, maturity level or feel is aimed more at an adult audience. Parental controls fall into roughly four categories: &quot;content filters&quot;, which limit access to age inappropriate content; &quot;usage controls&quot;, which constrain the usage of these devices such as placing time-limits on usage or forbidding certain types of usage; &quot;computer usage management tools&quot;, which enforces the use of certain software; and &quot;monitoring&quot;, which can track location and activity when using the devices. 

Content filters were the first popular type of parental controls to limit access to Internet content. Television stations also began to introduce V-Chip technology to limit access to television content. Modern usage controls are able to restrict a range of explicit content such as explicit songs and movies. They are also able to turn devices off during specific times of the day, limiting the volume output of devices, and with GPS technology becoming affordable, it is now possible to easily locate devices such as mobile phones. UNICEF emphases the responsibility of parents and teachers in this role.

The demand for parental control methods that restrict content has increased over the decades due to the rising availability of the Internet. A 2014 ICM survey showed that almost a quarter of people under the age of 12 had been exposed to online pornography. Restricting especially helps in cases when children are exposed to inappropriate content by accident. Monitoring may be effective for lessening acts of cyberbullying within the internet. It is unclear whether parental controls will affect online harassment in children, as little is known about the role the family plays in protecting children from undesirable experiences online. Psychologically, cyberbullying could be more harmful to the victim than traditional bullying. Studies done in the past have shown that about 75% of adolescents were subjected to cyberbullying. A lack of parental controls in the household could enable kids to be a part of cyberbullying or be the victim of cyberbullying.

==Overview==
Behavioral control consists of controlling the amount of time a child spends online, or how much the child can view. Psychological control involves parents trying to influence children&#x27;s behavior.

Several techniques exist for creating parental controls for blocking websites. Add-on parental control software may monitor API in order to observe applications such as a web browser or Internet chat application and to intervene according to certain criteria, such as a match in a database of banned words. Virtually all parental control software includes a password or other form of authentication to prevent unauthorized users from disabling it.

Techniques involving a proxy server are also used. A web browser is set to send requests for web content to the proxy server rather than directly to the web server intended. The proxy server then fetches the web page from the server on the browser&#x27;s behalf and passes on the content to the browser. Proxy servers can inspect the data being sent and received and intervene depending on various criteria relating to content of the page or the URL being requested, for example, using a database of banned words or banned URLs. The proxy method&#x27;s major disadvantage is that it requires that the client application to be configured to utilize the proxy, and if it is possible for the user to reconfigure applications to access the Internet directly rather than going through the proxy, then this control is easily bypassed. Proxy servers themselves may be used to circumvent parental controls. There are other techniques used to bypass parental controls.

The computer usage management method, unlike content filters, is focused on empowering the parents to balance the computing environment for children by regulating gaming. The main idea of these applications is to allow parents to introduce a learning component into the computing time of children, who must earn gaming time while working through educational contents.

Lately network-based parental control devices have emerged. These devices working as a firewall router use packet filtering, DNS response policy zone (RPZ) and deep packet inspection (DPI) methods to block inappropriate web content. These methods have been used in commercial and governmental communication networks. Another form of these devices made for home networks has been developed. These devices plug into the home router and create a new wireless network, which is specifically designed for kids to connect to.

==Parental controls on mobile devices==
The increased use of mobile devices with fully featured web browsers and downloadable applications has created a demand for parental controls on these devices. Some examples of mobile devices that contain parental controls include cell phones, tablets, and e-readers. In November 2007, Verizon was the first carrier to offer age-appropriate content filters as well as the first to offer generic content filters, recognizing that mobile devices were used to access all manner of content from movies and music to short-code programs and websites. In June 2009, in iPhone OS 3.0, Apple was the first company to provide a built-in mechanism on mobile devices to create age brackets for users that would block unwanted applications from being downloaded to the device. In the following years, the developers of all major operating systems have presented in-built tools for parental control, including Linux, Android, Windows, and even the more business-oriented platform Blackberry. There are also applications that allow parents to monitor real-time conversations on their children&#x27;s phone via access to text messages, browser history, and application history. An example of one of these is Trend Micro which not only offers protection from viruses, but also offers parental controls to phones and tablets of almost all brands. Most of these offer the ability to add extra features to parental controls. These apps have the features mobile devices already have, but have additional features such as, being able to monitor and filter texts/calls, protection while surfing the web, and denied access to specific websites. Applications of this sort have created a rising competition in their market.

Mobile device software enables parents to restrict which applications their child can access while also allowing parents to monitor text messages, phone logs, MMS pictures, and other transactions occurring on their child&#x27;s mobile device; to enable parents to set a time limit on the usage of mobile devices; and to track the exact location of their children as well as monitor calls and the content of texts. This software also allows parents to monitor social media accounts. Parents are able to view posts, pictures, and any interactions in real time. Another function of this software is to keep track of bullying.
Most internet service providers offer no-cost filtering options to limit internet browsing options and block unsuitable content. Implementing parental controls and discussing internet safety are useful steps to protect children from inappropriate information.

Although parental controls can protect children, they also come with some negative factors. Children&#x27;s anxiety may increase due to parental controls. In extreme cases, a child may become so angry that they destroy their device, defeating the purpose of parental controls entirely. In that case, it might be a better idea to forgo installing parental controls.

==Methods to bypass parental controls==
Several methods of bypassing parental controls can be used.
* If the filtering software is located locally within the computer, all Internet software can be easily bypassed by booting up the computer in question from alternative media, with an alternative operating system or (on Windows) in Safe Mode. However, if the computer&#x27;s BIOS is configured to disallow booting from removable media, and if changes to the BIOS are prohibited without proper authentication, then booting into an alternative operating system is not available without circumventing BIOS security by partially disassembling the computer and resetting BIOS configuration using a button or jumper, or removing and replacing the internal button cell battery.
* Using external proxy servers or other servers. The user sends requests to the external server which retrieves content on the user&#x27;s behalf. Filtering software may then never be able to know which URLs the user is accessing, as all communications are with the one external server and filtering software never sees any communications with the web servers from which content really originated. To counter this, filtering software may also block access to popular proxies. Additionally, filtering systems which only permit access to a set of allowed URLs (whitelisting) will not permit access anything outside this list, including proxy servers.
* Resetting passwords using exploits
* Modifying the software&#x27;s files
* Brute-force attacks on software passwords
* &#x27;Incognito/InPrivate&#x27; modes with the &#x27;image&#x27; tab: Users, parental control software, and parental control routers may use &#x27;safe search&#x27; (SafeSearch) to enforce filtering at most major search engines. However, in most browsers a user may select &#x27;Incognito&#x27; or &#x27;InPrivate&#x27; browsing, enter search terms for content, and select the &#x27;image&#x27; tab to effectively bypass &#x27;safe search&#x27; and many parental control filters. See below for router based considerations and solutions.

Filtering that occurs outside of the individuals computer (such as at the router) cannot be bypassed using the above methods (except for &#x27;Incognito/InPrivate&#x27; modes). However,
* The major search engines cache and serve content on their own servers. As a result, domain filters such as many third party DNS servers, also fail to filter the &#x27;Incognito/InPrivate&#x27; with &#x27;image&#x27; tab.
* Most commercially available routers with parental controls do not enforce safe search at the router, and therefore do not filter the &#x27;Incognito/InPrivate&#x27; with &#x27;image&#x27; tab.

== Criticism ==
While parental controls have been added to various electronic media and have increased in popularity, the question has been raised if they are enough to protect and deter children from exposure to inappropriate material. It has been speculated by researchers that the strict focus on control may hinder a child&#x27;s ability to learn self-governing skills and restricting the growth of open communication between parent and child.

<doc id="1331251" wikidata="Q381600" url="?curid=1331251" title="Samuel Smith (Maryland politician)">
<text>Samuel Smith (July 27, 1752April 22, 1839) was an American Senator and Representative from Maryland, a mayor of Baltimore, Maryland, and a general in the Maryland militia. He was the older brother of cabinet secretary Robert Smith.

Smith served twice as President pro tempore of the United States Senate, first from 1805 to 1808 and later from 1828 to 1831.

==Early life and education==
Smith was born in Carlisle in the Province of Pennsylvania. His grandfather, also named Samuel Smith (1698–1784), was born in Ireland and settled in the Province of Maryland. Smith moved with his family to Baltimore, in 1759. He attended a private academy, and engaged in mercantile pursuits until the American Revolutionary War, at which time he served as captain, major, and lieutenant colonel in the Continental Army.

==Career==
===Military service===
Prior to the American Revolutionary War, as a young captain, he was sent to Annapolis to arrest Governor Eden and seize his papers.

===American Revolutionary War===
On September 23, 1776, with the Revolutionary capital of Philadelphia on the verge of capture by the British, Washington sent Smith, then a Lieutenant Colonel of the 4th Maryland Regiment, with a Continental Army detachment into the fort on Mud Island on the Delaware River. Smith&#x27;s force numbered 200 soldiers plus Major Robert Ballard of Virginia, Major Simeon Thayer of Rhode Island, and Captain Samuel Treat of the Continental Artillery. However, another account stated that Thayer did not reach Fort Mifflin until October 19. With the British army closing in on Philadelphia, the small force had to reach Fort Mifflin by a circuitous route. On the last leg of their journey, reinforcements for Mud Island had to be ferried across the Delaware from Red Bank, New Jersey under the protection of the Pennsylvania Navy river flotilla commanded by John Hazelwood. The fort was eventually overwhelmed by weeks of British bombardment and was abandoned. After his service in the war, Smith engaged in the shipping business.

Colonel Smith was admitted as an original member of The Society of the Cincinnati of Maryland when it was established in 1783. He went on to serve as the vice president (1804–1828) and president of the Maryland Society (1828–1839), serving in the latter capacity until his death.

===War of 1812===
Smith served as a major general of Maryland militia during the War of 1812, and commanded the defenses of Baltimore during the Battle of Baltimore in September 1814. The American victory there is partly attributed to Smith&#x27;s preparation for the British invasion.

===Political career===
From 1790 to 1792, Smith was a member of the Maryland House of Delegates. At the time of the threatened war with France in 1794, he was appointed brigadier general of the Maryland militia and commanded Maryland&#x27;s quota during the Whiskey Rebellion.

Smith entered into national politics when he was elected to the Third United States Congress, serving from March 4, 1793, until March 4, 1803. As a Congressman, Smith served as chairman of the U.S. House Committee on Commerce and Manufactures (Fifth through Seventh Congresses). As a principal negotiator between the young Federalist leader and Delaware representative, James Asheton Bayard II, and the presumptive President-Elect Jefferson, Smith secured the winning ballot in the United States House of Representatives for Jefferson during the 1800 United States presidential election. Smith entered into the Senate election in 1802, and was elected as a Democratic-Republican to the United States Senate. He was re-elected in 1808 and served from March 4, 1803 until March 4, 1815. While senator, Smith served as President pro tempore of the Senate during the Ninth and Tenth Congresses.

Smith was elected to the Fourteenth Congress on January 31, 1816 to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Nicholas R. Moore, and was re-elected to the Fifteenth, Sixteenth, and Seventeenth Congresses. In the House, Smith served as chairman of the U.S. House Committee on Expenditures in the Department of the Treasury (Fourteenth Congress), and as a member of the Committee on Ways and Means (Fifteenth through Seventeenth Congresses).

On December 17, 1822, Smith resigned as congressman, having been elected as a Democratic-Republican (later Crawford Republican and Jacksonian) to the United States Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the death of William Pinkney. In March–April 1824, Samuel Smith was honored with a single vote at the Democratic-Republican Party Caucus to be the party&#x27;s candidate for U.S. Vice President at the election later that year.

In 1828, Smith served as vice president of the Maryland State Colonization Society, of which Charles Carroll of Carrollton, one of the co-signers of the Declaration of Independence, was president. The MSCS was a branch of the American Colonization Society, an organization dedicated to returning black Americans to lead free lives in African states such as Liberia.

Smith served as President Pro Tempore of the Senate again during the Twentieth and Twenty-first Congresses, and as chairman of the Committee on Finance (Eighteenth and Twentieth through Twenty-second Congresses). He was re-elected in 1826 and served until March 4, 1833. Two years later, in 1835, Smith became mayor of Baltimore, and served in that position until 1838, when he retired from public life.

==Death==
Samuel Smith, a distinguished American politician and military leader, died on April 22, 1839, at his residence, Montibello, near Baltimore, Maryland. He was 86 years old at the time of his death. Following his passing, Smith was interred in the Old Westminster Burying Ground in Baltimore.

<doc id="1331261" wikidata="Q5475468" url="?curid=1331261" title="Four Saints in Three Acts">
<text>Four Saints in Three Acts is an opera composed in 1928 by Virgil Thomson, setting a libretto written in 1927 by Gertrude Stein. It contains about 20 saints and is in at least four acts. It was groundbreaking in form, content, and for its all-black cast, with singers directed by Eva Jessye, a prominent black choral director, and supported by her choir.

Thomson suggested the topic, and the libretto as delivered can be read in Stein&#x27;s collected works. The opera features two 16th-century Spanish saints—the former mercenary Ignatius of Loyola and the mystic Teresa of Avila—as well as their colleagues, real and imagined: St. Plan, St. Settlement, St. Plot, St. Chavez, etc. Thomson decided to divide St. Teresa&#x27;s role between two singers, &quot;St. Teresa I&quot; and &quot;St. Teresa II&quot;, and added the master and mistress of ceremonies (&quot;Compère&quot; and &quot;Commère&quot;—literally, the &quot;godparents&quot;) to sing Stein&#x27;s stage directions.

==Synopsis==
After the chorus sings a prelude, the first act takes place at the Ávila cathedral; it is titled &quot;St. Teresa half indoors and half out of doors&quot;. Act two, &quot;Might it be mountains if it were not Barcelona&quot;, involves a telescope and glimpses of a heavenly mansion. Act three, &quot;St. Ignatius and one of two literally&quot; is a picnic and contains Ignatius&#x27; famous aria &quot;Pigeons on the grass alas&quot;. It ends with a tango-like ballet. The brief fourth act (&quot;The sisters and saints reassembled and re-enacting why they went away to stay&quot;) is set at the garden of a monastery. Before the curtain falls the Compère announces &quot;Last act&quot;, and the chorus replies &quot;Which is a fact&quot;.

==Cast==
The cast of the original production included:
*Edward Matthews as &quot;St Ignatius&quot; (baritone)
* Beatrice Robinson-Wayne as &quot;St Teresa I&quot; (soprano)
* Bruce Howard as &quot;St Teresa II&quot; (contralto)
* Embry Bonner as &quot;St. Chavez&quot; (tenor)
* Bertha Fitzhugh Baker as &quot;St. Settlement&quot; (soprano)
* Randolph Robinson as &quot;St. Plan&quot;
* Abner Dorsey as &quot;the Compère&quot; (bass)
* Altonell Hines as &quot;the Commere&quot; (mezzo)
* Ruby Greene
* Inez Matthews (Edward Matthews&#x27; sister)
* Charles Holland
* The Eva Jessye Choir, led by Eva Jessye

==Productions==
After its premiere February 7, 1934, at the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford, Connecticut, &quot;Four Saints in Three Acts&quot; opened on Broadway at the 44th Street Theatre February 20, 1934. The opera was notable in defying many aspects of traditional performance. Stein&#x27;s libretto focused more on an affinity for the sounds of words than on presenting a narrative. Thomson&#x27;s music was unconventional in its very simplicity. Eva Jessye, a black music pioneer in New York, directed the singers and her choir in the production. The production was directed by John Houseman, who was 31 and had only recently turned his attention to theater after working in the international grain market.

The sets of the first production, designed by artist Florine Stettheimer, included innovative cellophane backdrops and brilliant pure white lighting, and the costumes (also Stettheimer&#x27;s) were of colorful lace, silk and taffeta. Frederick Ashton provided the choreography (after George Balanchine turned down the job).

Also considered unusual was the portrayal of the European saints by an all-black cast, for which there was no precedent in American history. These unconventional elements led to a successful and well-received first production. While critics were divided, audiences accepted the fantasy world created by the singers, who vividly conveyed the words and melodies given to their saintly characters.

The opera would be performed later as a concert oratorio, as in the 1942 and 1947 radio broadcasts. In addition, a production at Town Hall was conducted by Alexander Smallens in which John Serry Sr. collaborated as the orchestral accordionist and Leonard De Paur as the choir director. Stage performances were produced in 1952 and 1973. In 1981, a New York concert version was performed for Thomson&#x27;s eighty-fifth birthday celebration. For this performance, Betty Allen, Gwendolyn Bradley, William Brown, Clamma Dale, Benjamin Matthews, Florence Quivar and Arthur Thompson sang the principal parts.

There have also been stagings by Robert Wilson and the choreographer Mark Morris, who created a dance piece for it. The involvement of photographers including Lee Miller, Carl Van Vechten, and George Platt Lynes in documenting and representing the opera and its original performances in 1934 is explored in an exhibition of photographs and ephemera at The Photographers&#x27; Gallery in London in October 2017; a book of criticims was published as well.

In 2022, a Doxsee Theater production featuring David Greenspan staged Stein&#x27;s text as a spoken one man show. It ran from September 15th to October 9th, and it received positive reviews from &quot;The New York Times,&quot; &quot;The New York Stage Review&quot;, and &quot;The New Yorker&quot;.

<doc id="1331263" wikidata="Q3268727" url="?curid=1331263" title="Diastrophism">
<text>Diastrophism is the process of deformation of the Earth&#x27;s crust which involves folding and faulting. Diastrophism can be considered part of geotectonics. The word is derived from the Greek &quot;&quot; &#x27;distortion, dislocation&#x27;.

Diastrophism covers movement of solid (plastic) crust material, as opposed to movement of molten material which is covered by volcanism. Movement causes rock to be bent or broken. The most obvious evidence of diastrophic movement can be seen where sedimentary rocks have been bent, broken or tilted. Such non-horizontal strata provide visual proof of movement. Diastrophic movement can be classified as two types, folding and faulting, tilted beds usually are part of a larger syncline or anticline. Diastrophic movement is often called orogenic as it is associated with mountain building.

There are various theories of the cause of diastrophic movement such as being the result of pressures exerted by convection currents in the mantle or the rise of magma through the crust. Other deformations are caused by meteorite impact and combinations of gravity and erosion such as landslides and slumping.

The study of diastrophism encompasses the varying responses of the crust to tectonic stresses. These responses include linear or torsional horizontal movements (such as continental drift) and vertical subsidence and uplift of the lithosphere (strain) in response to natural stresses on Earth&#x27;s surface such as the weight of mountains, lakes, and glaciers. Subsurface conditions also cause subsidence or uplift, known as epeirogeny, over large areas of Earth&#x27;s surface without deforming rock strata. Such changes include the thickening of the lithosphere by overthrusting, changes in rock density of the lithosphere caused by metamorphism or thermal expansion and contraction, increases in the volume of the asthenosphere (part of the upper mantle supporting the lithosphere) caused by hydration of olivine, and orogenic, or mountain-building, movements.

==Historical development of the concept==
By the end of the 19th Century it was generally accepted that the cause of folding and faults was lateral compression that resulted from a shrinking Earth caused by its gradual cooling. In the late 19th Century, Eduard Suess proposed his eustatic theory that provided the underpinnings for Chamberlin&#x27;s explanation of diastrophism.

In volume two of &quot;Das Antlitz der Erde&quot; Suess set out his belief that across geologic time, the rise and fall of sea levels were mappable across the earth, that is, that the periods of ocean transgression and regression were correlatable from one continent to another. Suess postulated that as sediments filled the ocean basins the sea levels gradually rose, and periodically there were events of rapid ocean bottom subsidence that increased the ocean&#x27;s capacity and caused the regressions. Chamberlin proposed that instead of a thermal contraction, diastrophic movement was caused by gravitational contraction. In the United States, it was not until the late 1960s that thermal convection replaced the shrinking Earth theories.

<doc id="1331267" wikidata="Q5157569" url="?curid=1331267" title="Computer programs and the Patent Cooperation Treaty">
<text>There are two provisions in the regulations annexed to the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) that relate to the search and examination of patent applications concerning computer programs. These two provisions are present in the PCT, which does not provide for the grant of patents but provides a unified procedure for filing, searching and examining patent applications, called international applications. The question of patentability is touched when conducting the search and the examination, which is an examination of whether the invention appears to be patentable.

These two provisions are and , and, in conjunction respectively with and , may have a concrete impact on the procedure under the PCT, in the search and examination performed under the PCT. Indeed, depending on the patent office which is in charge of the search or examination under the PCT, the application filed for an invention relating to a computer program may or may not be searched or examined. In addition, the ISA and IPEA (see background section) that do not search such applications to a certain extent have diverging practices with respect to determinations of exclusions as to computer programs.

In addition to the consequences these legal provisions may have in practice, is also significant from an interpretive perspective to understand the origin of the much debated (see Software patents under the European Patent Convention (EPC) and Article 52 EPC). The computer program exclusion was indeed inserted in the EPC in line with Rule 39.1 PCT, so that Rule 39.1 predates Art. 52(2) and (3) EPC.

== Background ==

The Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) is an international patent law treaty, which provides a unified procedure for filing patent applications. A patent application filed under the PCT is called an international application or a PCT application.

The filing of an international application results in an international search performed by a patent office, accompanied with a written opinion regarding the patentability of the invention which is the subject of the application. An applicant may also request an international preliminary examination performed by a patent office. The PCT does not provide that the searches and examinations are to be performed by one central patent office, as the WIPO does not perform searches and examinations. In contrast, the European Patent Convention (EPC) places the European Patent Office (EPO) in charge of performing searches and examinations for European patent applications.

Under the PCT, the international search and the optional international preliminary examination are conducted by different national or regional patent offices, referred to as the International Searching Authorities (ISA) and the International Preliminary Examining Authority (IPEA) Applicants, based on nationality and on the Receiving Office where the application was filed, may have an opportunity to have the search performed by one of the ISAs.

== The relevant provisions in the regulations ==

The regulations under the PCT do touch on the search and examination of computer programs.&lt;ref name=&quot;T164/92 8.3&quot;&gt;Decision T 164/92 of the Board of Appeal 3.5.1 of the European Patent Office, April 29, 1993, Reasons 8.3. (English translation). Published in Official Journal 1995, 305.&lt;/ref&gt;

 states that
 states that
According to the Board of Appeal 3.5.1 of the EPO, these provisions mean that the ISA and IPEA authorities are not required to carry out searches or preliminary examinations in respect of programs if, for example, they have no examiners trained to do so or are not equipped with appropriate search material. The Board went on to say:

These provisions deal only with the international searches and international preliminary examinations and not with the national and regional searches or examinations.&lt;ref name=&quot;T164/92 8.4&quot;&gt; Generalisation of &quot;The aforementioned rules deal only with the international search and international preliminary examination and therefore not with the regional European search or examination.&quot; in Decision T 164/92, Reasons 8.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practices by ISA and IPEA ==

The different ISA and IPEA have made use of the legal provisions of Articles 17(2)(a)(i) and 34(4)(a)(i) PCT in conjunction with Rules 39.1 and 67.1 in a different manner. In addition, as mentioned above, the ISA and IPEA that have made use of these provisions have diverging practices with respect to determinations of exclusions as to computer programs.

For instance, the European Patent Office (EPO), acting as ISA and IPEA, is not obliged to search, by virtue of Article 17(2)(a)(i) PCT, or examine, by virtue of Article 34(4)(a)(i) PCT, any international application to the extent that the EPO considers that such application relates to subject matter which does not comply with the provisions of the European Patent Convention to such an extent that it is not possible to carry out a meaningful search into the state of the art on the basis of all or some of the claims. The EPO acting as ISA or IPEA in the PCT procedure is therefore not obliged to search or examine some PCT applications when not equipped to do so.

== Origin and interpretive significance of the provisions ==

The computer program exclusion of Rule 39.1 PCT, which originally appears to be for &quot;equipment&quot; reasons, dates from 1969:
Rule 39.1 PCT is significant from an interpretive perspective to understand the origin of the much debated (see Software patents under the European Patent Convention (EPC) and Article 52 EPC). The computer program exclusion was indeed inserted in the EPC in line with Rule 39.1 PCT, so that Rule 39.1 predates Art. 52(2) and (3) EPC. However, while the PCT condition for excluding computer programs is a question of equipment, the EPC condition is a question of &quot;computer program as such&quot;.

According to some, the fact that the PCT does not deal directly with the scope of patentable subject matter, in relation to computer programs, adds &quot;weight to the contention that, having been born out of administrative inconvenience rather than any great principle, restrictions on patentability of programs should be limited to the maximum possible extent.&quot;

In the judgment in &quot;CFPH LLC&#x27;s Applications&quot;, Peter Prescott referred to Rule 39.1 PCT when discussing the motivation behind the exclusion from patent protection of programs for computers under UK law. He commented that, at the time the EPC was under consideration (during the 1970s), &quot;it was felt that searching the prior art would be a big problem&quot; and that &quot;Rule 39(1) of the Patent Co-operation Treaty recognised that an International Searching Authority might not be suitably equipped&quot;.

== Consequences on national and regional phases ==

These provisions have no legal consequence as regards the patentability in national or regional patent offices designated in a PCT application, as the law of most national or regional offices requires that they draw their own conclusions based on their own national or regional patent law. This is in complete compliance with the PCT since provides that, as far as substantive conditions of patentability are concerned, national and regional patent laws prevail:

<doc id="1331269" wikidata="Q7936205" url="?curid=1331269" title="Vision span">
<text>Vision span or perceptual span is a controversial concept referring to the angular span (vertically and horizontally), within which the human eye has sharp enough vision to perform an action accurately (reading or face recognition). The visual field of the human eye spans approximately 120 degrees of arc. However, most of that arc is peripheral vision. The human eye has much greater resolution in the macula, where there is a higher density of cone cells. The macula has a diameter of about 16 degrees of the retina. The field of view that is observed with sufficient resolution to read text typically spans about 6 degrees of arc, which is wide enough to allow a clear view of about five words in a row when printed text at ordinary size is held about 50 centimeters from the eyes. Regarding face processing, the field of view with a sufficient amount of information in order to recognise faces accurately spans about 7° which represents about 45% of a face. The brain creates the illusion of having a greater visual span by automatically and unconsciously moving the center of vision into any area of interest in the field of view.

== Application to speed reading ==
While reading, readers will fail to recognize a word unless they are fixating within three to four character spaces of the word. The same is true for speed readers and skimmers. Speed readers cannot answer questions about a main point or detail, if they did not fixate directly on it or within three character spaces of it. When a text is removed whilst reading, readers can only accurately report upon the word they were fixating upon or the next one to the right. There is no evidence from eye movement research that individuals are making predictions of text based upon hypotheses about the words in the periphery so that they can skip over or spend less time on unimportant or redundant words.

Most speed reading courses claim that the peripheral vision can be used to read text. This has been suggested impossible because the text is blurred out through lack of visual resolution. At best the human brain can only &quot;guess&quot; at the content of text outside the macular region. There simply are not enough cone cells away from the center of the visual field to identify words in the periphery of the field.

It has been suggested that the fixation span can be stretched through training (meta guiding) to take in as much as a line for the purpose of skimming or speed reading. However other sources suggest that using this method can result in a severely reduced comprehension rate in comparison to normal reading (&quot;rauding&quot;).

Some speed reading courses stress that the human eye has to move very quickly. They also stress that the human eye should move in a pattern to fill in the information that was not properly perceived. The effective limit for ning speeds based upon the limit of the human eye&#x27;s resolution is about 300 words per minute. It is claimed that such speeds also require great practice, and extremely rapid eye movements, although research suggests that such training is not possible. It has been suggested by some speed reading promoters that the readers who achieve such speeds are on the autism spectrum. Research into reading rate suggests that study strategies, rather than speed reading, explains why expert readers, such as professors and editors, are more efficient than others.

== Application to face processing ==
Face recognition system requires several fixation on different location (typically in a triangular pattern) for a face to be recognised. The same is true for the so-called Super Recognisers who are persons with high face recognition capabilities. Similarly to the reading span, the Facespan might be modulated by difficulty, expertise, age, disorder and other idiosyncratic differences between individuals. The idiosyncratic differences are thus most probably due to differences in Facespan rather than in oculomotor strategy. Previous study revealed that the Vision span is more accurately defined in number of characters rather than in visual angle.

<text>Abriea &quot;Abbie&quot; Mitchell Cook (25 September 1884 – 16 March 1960), also billed as Abbey Mitchell, was an American soprano opera singer. She performed the role of Clara in the premiere production of George Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; in 1935, and was also the first to record &quot;Summertime&quot; from that musical.

== Biography ==
Mitchell was the mixed-race daughter of an African-American mother and a Jewish-German father from New York City&#x27;s Lower East Side. She was reared by a maternal aunt, Alice Payne, in Baltimore, Maryland, where she attended a Catholic convent school.

Mitchell never completed her formal schooling in Baltimore. Following the death of her father, she traveled to New York to spend the summer with her other aunt. At the age of fourteen, she was discovered singing from the fire escape of her aunt&#x27;s apartment by the composer Will Marion Cook and lyricist Paul Laurence Dunbar; they cast her for a role in their one-act musical comedy &quot;&quot; (1898). It was so successful that it ran for the whole season at the Casino Roof Garden.

Mitchell married Cook a year later, and appeared in the lead role in his &quot;Jes Lak White Folks&quot; (1899). She also appeared in his production &quot;The Southerners&quot; (1904). Cook and Mitchell had a daughter, Marion Abigail Cook, in 1900, and a son, Will Mercer Cook, in 1903.

In London, Mitchell appeared in the 1903 musical &quot;In Dahomey&quot;, produced by the team of George Walker and Bert Williams, with music composed by her husband Cook, book by J.A. Shipp, and lyrics by poet Paul Laurence Dunbar. The cakewalk, considered old-fashioned by the cast, was almost cut from the show, but proved popular with audiences. It became a fad in the United Kingdom. Mitchell received international acclaim for her performance, and at age 17 she was invited to appear with the company in a Royal Command Performance for King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra at Buckingham Palace.

Mitchell later performed with the &quot;Black Patti&#x27;s Troubadours&quot;, and in the operetta &quot;The Red Moon&quot; (1908) by Bob Cole and J. Rosamond Johnson. In 1913, she appeared in the film &quot;Lime Kiln Field Day&quot; with Bert Williams, which was produced by Klaw and Erlanger, but they never finished or released it. In 1919, Mitchell went to Europe with Cook&#x27;s Southern Syncopated Orchestra. In New York, she appeared on the concert stage and in opera.

Lee de Forest made a short film, &quot;Songs of Yesteryear&quot; (1922), of Mitchell singing, using his DeForest Phonofilm sound-on-film process. This film is preserved in the Maurice Zouary film collection at the Library of Congress.

Mitchell appeared in several Broadway plays, including &quot;In Abraham&#x27;s Bosom&quot; (1926), &quot;Coquette&quot; (1927) starring Helen Hayes, and &quot;The Little Foxes&quot; (1939) starring Tallulah Bankhead.

Mitchell was best known for performing in the role of Clara in the premiere of George Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; (1935); this was her last musical role on the stage. She was the first singer to record &quot;Summertime&quot; from the opera. After this, &quot;she taught and coached many singers in New York and appeared in many &#x27;spoken&#x27; dramatic roles on the stage.&quot; In 1939, she played the role of Tallulah Bankhead&#x27;s intelligent and trusted servant in &quot;The Little Foxes&quot; on Broadway. She also performed in New York City in other productions and taught at the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama.

Their daughter, raised by family members as Mitchell had been, married dancer Louis Douglas. Their son became a professor at Howard University and a translator. He was later appointed as United States Ambassador to Niger and Senegal.

Mitchell died in New York on March 16, 1960, and was given a Catholic funeral.

<doc id="1331280" wikidata="Q1177008" url="?curid=1331280" title="David Výborný">
<text>David Výborný (born January 22, 1975) is a Czech former professional ice hockey player who last played for BK Mladá Boleslav of the Czech Extraliga. He played for the Columbus Blue Jackets of the National Hockey League (NHL). Internationally, he played for the Czech Republic men&#x27;s national team and won five World Championships, and a bronze medal in ice hockey at the 2006 Winter Olympics. He was inducted into the IIHF Hall of Fame in 2025.

==Playing career==

===Early career===
Výborný first rose to prominence playing with Sparta Prague of the Czech Extraliga in 1992. He scored 20 goals and 44 points in 52 games, all as a teenager. The Edmonton Oilers picked Výborný up in the second round of the 1993 NHL Entry Draft, and he proved that he was not a fluke by scoring 46 points for Sparta in the next season.

Výborný came over to North America for the 1994–95 season and played for the Cape Breton Oilers of the American Hockey League (AHL). He again performed quite well, scoring 61 points in 76 games, third most on his team and fifth most among AHL rookies. However, he headed back to Europe after only one season in the AHL. Upon his return to Sparta, he scored at a rigorous pace. He scored 42 points in 40 games and helped Sparta into the playoffs, where he again scored more than a point per game. Výborný spent one more season in Prague and continued to improve with 49 points in 47 games; he added 14 more in the playoffs.

Výborný was a star in the Czech Republic, but he went to Sweden for the 1997–98 season. He played for Modo and led the team in scoring. Again, after just one season abroad, Výborný went back to Sparta Prague. In the 1998–99 season, Výborný cemented his place as one of the stars of the Czech hockey scene. He scored 70 points in 52 games and won the Extraliga&#x27;s scoring title by 18 points. In the next season, he continued to rack up points and finished second in the league&#x27;s scoring race. He also won a championship with Sparta. Finally, it seemed as if Výborný had nothing left to prove in the Czech Republic.
===NHL career===
On June 8, 2000, Výborný was signed by the Columbus Blue Jackets to add some scoring punch in their first season. He debuted in the NHL on October 7, and scored a goal on in his very first NHL game. His production for Columbus was much less than it had been in Prague. In the end, he scored 13 goals and 19 assists, for a total of 32 points in 79 games. He was also ranked 10th among rookies for goals and points and was the first rookie ever to score on multiple penalty shots in one season.

Výborný&#x27;s performance (31 points) was very similar in his second season. As the Blue Jackets improved, though, so did Výborný. In the 2002–03 NHL season, he scored 46 points and led his team with a +12 plus/minus, which set a record for the Blue Jackets. Výborný improved still more for the 2003–04 NHL season, and he scored 22 goals and 31 assists, for a total of 53 points. He led Columbus in assists and came in second to Rick Nash in goals and points. In addition to his offensive talent, Výborný has proved to be quite durable, as he currently holds the Blue Jackets record for the most consecutive games, with 161. He tied for fourth in the NHL in shorthanded goals with four, another record for the Blue Jackets.

Výborný played for Sparta Prague during the 2004–05 NHL lockout.

===Back to Europe===
On April 25, 2008, it was announced that Výborný was returning to Sparta Prague for the 2008–09 season. With his departure, Rostislav Klesla became the only remaining player from the Blue Jackets&#x27; inaugural season. In 2011, Výborný signed with BK Mlada Boleslav. He helped the club win back-to-back championships in the Czech second-division in 2013 and 2014 and earn promotion to the top Czech division in 2014. After suffering a torn ACL, he announced his retirement on March 15, 2016.

==Awards and achievements==
* Played in the Czech Ice Hockey Extraliga All-Star game in 1999 and 2000
* Appeared on the cover of the Czech edition of the NHL 2K7 video game.

==Records==
*NHL record for most penalty shot goals in a season by a rookie

==International play==
Výborný won five World Championships with the Czech Republic men&#x27;s national ice hockey team and a bronze medal in ice hockey at the 2006 Winter Olympics. At the 2006 IIHF World Championship, when capturing silver, he was named to the all-tournament team. At the 1997 and 1998 World Championships, he won bronze. He was inducted into the IIHF Hall of Fame in 2025.

<text>WMC Resources Limited was an Australian diversified mining company.

==History==
Western Mining Corporation (WMC) was formed in 1933, when William Robinson, the Australian-born London-based managing director of Broken Hill Associated Smelters, was able to interest several large London-based mining companies into forming syndicates to develop gold mines in Australia. WMC&#x27;s strategy was to use the newly emerging sciences of mining geology and related geochemistry and geophysics to find new gold deposits. It was a company based on the idea that if they applied good science to exploration, they would be successful.

WMC began operations in Western Australia in December 1933 when it commenced an extensive aerial survey of the Eastern Goldfields. It acquired its first profitable mining operation in June 1935 when it took an option over a new gold discovery at Cox&#x27;s Find, 43 miles northwest of Laverton.

WMC pioneered district-scale aerial photography in the 1930s, flying many areas in West Australia&#x27;s gold-mining districts. The hope was to identify new prospective areas near known mines. Unfortunately, the surveys failed due to poor exposures of the rocks in the nearly flat, deeply-weathered areas they flew.

In 1961, WMC acquired a 20% shareholding in Alcoa World Alumina &amp; Chemicals that later increased to 40%.

The company&#x27;s final corporate structure before takeover was formed in 2002 by a demerger that split off the aluminium operations to form Alumina, separate from what was to be known as WMC Resources Limited.

==Takeover bids==
In December 2004, Xstrata announced a takeover offer for the company. In February 2005, the WMC board recommended that shareholders reject the offer. The Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission and Foreign Investment Review Board both approved the deal, however a number of people (including members of the Government) expressed concerns due to the economic (and strategic) importance of the Olympic Dam mine resources, and the reputation of Xstrata and its major shareholder, Glencore.

The Xstrata takeover offer lapsed after a higher offer was made by BHP Billiton, with support from the WMC Resources board. When the offer closed 3 June 2005, BHP Billiton held 55% of the WMC&#x27;s shares. Under the Corporations Act 2001 this automatically extended the offer period by another 14 days. On 17 June 2005, BHP Billiton announced that it had achieved 90.5% ownership, and would proceed to compulsorily acquire the remaining shares. It was delisted from the Australian Securities Exchange on 29 June 2005.

The company name was later subsumed by the BHP Billiton corporate identity, and a significant name in Australian mining history ceased to be used.

==Operations==
When it was taken over it had three main businesses:
*Mount Keith and Leinster Nickel Mines, Kambalda Nickel Concentrator, Kalgoorlie Nickel Smelter and Kwinana Nickel Refinery, all in Western Australia
*Olympic Dam mine copper-uranium-gold mine in South Australia. In 2005, this mine was estimated to contain 33% of the world&#x27;s known uranium reserves.
*The Phosphate Hill mine and associated phosphate fertiliser production business in Queensland, which became known as Southern Cross Fertilisers following the BHP Billiton takeover; and Hi Fert, a blending and distribution network supporting Australia&#x27;s eastern states. BHP Billiton sold Hi Fert to a joint venture of Elders and AWB in December 2005 and Southern Cross Fertilisers to Incitec Pivot in May 2006.

<text>Edward Matthews (1904 or 1905 – 20 February 1954) was a pioneering African-American baritone opera singer.

Matthews was born in Ossining, New York. In 1934, he created the role of Ignatius of Loyola in Virgil Thomson&#x27;s &quot;Four Saints in Three Acts&quot;, which he reprised in the 1952 revival of the opera – his last appearance on Broadway. In 1935, he created his most famous role, Jake the fisherman, in the original 1935 production of George Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;. Here, Matthews introduced the song &quot;A Woman Is a Sometime Thing&quot;. He recreated the role in the 1942 revival of the opera, and in the 1951 three-LP album set – the most complete recording of &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; made up to that time.

Matthews died in a car crash on 20 February 1954, aged 49, near Woodbridge, Virginia.

It serves 262 affiliated societies and academies of science and engineering, representing 10 million individuals worldwide. It is publisher of the journal &quot;Science&quot;, which has the largest paid circulation of any peer-reviewed general science journal in the world and an estimated total readership of 1 million. AAAS fulfills its mission to &quot;advance science and serve society&quot; through initiatives in science policy; international programs; science education; communication; and more. It is a non-profit organization, with membership open to everyone.

AAAS presidents serve a one-year term, beginning in mid-February at the close of the AAAS Annual Meeting. In accordance with the convention used by the AAAS, presidents are referenced based on the year in which they left office.

<text>Health Purchasing Victoria is an Australian public authority established in 2001 by an amendment to the Victorian &quot;Health Services Act&quot; 1988, and has a responsibility to facilitate reform of the procurement system for Victorian hospitals and health services. It is an independent statutory authority responsible to the Minister of Health.

Public hospitals and health services in the state of Victoria have a differing legal status to their counterparts in all other Australian States. In Victoria, &quot;public&quot; hospitals and health services, that is, primary, secondary and tertiary health care centres funded predominantly by government grants, are separate legal entities. For this reason, the Victorian State Government enacted legislation to create an entity that has the ability to enter into collective commercial contracts for goods and services on best value terms on behalf of public hospitals and health services.

<text>The Cabinet of the Philippines (, usually referred to as the Cabinet or Gabinete) consists of the heads of the largest part of the executive branch of the national government of the Philippines. Currently, it includes the secretaries of 22 executive departments and the heads of other several other minor agencies and offices that are subordinate to the president of the Philippines.

The cabinet secretaries are tasked to advise the president on the different affairs of the state like agriculture, budget, energy, finance, education, social welfare, national defense, foreign policy, and the like.

They are nominated by the president and then presented to the Commission on Appointments, a body of the Congress of the Philippines that confirms all appointments made by the president, for confirmation or rejection. If the presidential appointees are approved, they are sworn into office, receive the title &quot;Secretary&quot;, and begin to function their duties.

== Constitutional and legal basis ==
=== Appointment ===
Article 7, Section 16 of the Constitution of the Philippines says that the President
== Cabinet and cabinet-level officials ==

The people listed below form the cabinet and are the heads of the current executive departments of the Philippines. The officials under these departments are appointed with the rank of Secretary. Appointed officials who are not confirmed by the Commission on Appointments, as required by law, will take the office under acting capacity, or as officer-in-charge, depending on the appointment released and approved by the President. The current structure of the Cabinet of the Philippines are based on the executive orders reorganizing the offices under its jurisdiction, given the fact that the Constitution allows executive privileges to reorganize its structure.

Official Filipino names of the agencies were derived from Komisyon ng Wikang Filipino and Department of Budget and Management.

=== Departments and Executive Offices of the Philippine Government ===
=== Agencies, authorities and offices under the Office of the President ===
The following officials are appointed on the following agencies directly under the supervision of the Office of the President. The current structure of these agencies and offices are based on Executive Order No. 1, s. 2022, wherein all agencies and offices under and attached to the Office of the President shall be under the supervision and control of the Office of Executive Secretary (&quot;Section 5&quot;). Meanwhile, officials under these agencies and offices can either have a rank of secretary or undersecretary, and therefore are permitted to attend Cabinet meetings for special purposes.

<text>(20 January 1920 – 19 May 2011) was a 10th Dan aikidoka and founder of the Ki Society and its style of aikido, officially Shin Shin Toitsu Aikido (literally &quot;aikido with mind and body unified&quot;), but commonly known as Ki-Aikido.

==Aikido==
Koichi Tohei was born 1920 in Shitaya ward (下谷区), presently Taitō, in Tokyo and graduated from the Economics Department of Keio University. As a boy he was sickly and frail, leading his father to recommend Tohei for judo studies. He trained hard and his body prospered, but soon after he began his pre-college studies at Keio University, he developed a case of pleurisy. This forced Tohei to take a year off.

Tohei was distressed at the thought of losing his newfound strength of body and his means of training it, so he decided to replace his judo studies with Zen meditation and misogi exercises, learned at the Ichikukai Dojo in Tokyo. As with his judo studies, Tohei entered the training of the mind with fervor and soon excelled despite his serious health issues. After his recovery from pleurisy, Tohei became convinced that it was his efforts in training his mind and cultivating his ki that had helped him to heal and recover. This stimulated his later development of Kiatsu, a system of treating physical illness by pressing with the fingers and extending the ki into the ill person&#x27;s body. Tohei describes this as &quot;priming the pump&quot; allowing the person to heal themselves.

After recovering from pleurisy he returned to judo, but Tohei wanted more than just physical training and did not think that judo was the right art for him to practise, although he did continue studying judo until he started aikido.

In 1940, when he was 19, Tohei&#x27;s judo instructor, Shohei Mori, recommended that Tohei meet with the founder of aikido, Morihei Ueshiba.

According to Tohei, when he first met with an aikido instructor and practiced some techniques at the Ueshiba dojo, he had doubts about aikido and its value to him. That changed when Ueshiba entered the dojo and started to perform his techniques on the instructors. Tohei was still not entirely convinced until Ueshiba asked Tohei to step onto the mat and try to grab him. Tohei&#x27;s attempts were unsuccessful, and after this personal demonstration by Ueshiba, Tohei asked to enroll on the spot. Tohei continued to train his mind as well as his body with meditation, misogi and aikido.

Tohei trained with Ueshiba for six months before being sent as a representative (dairi) to teach at the Shumei Okawa school and the military police academy. This was before Tohei was ranked as either dan or kyu. Ueshiba presented Tohei with the rank of 5th dan after Tohei had begun his military service.

==War years==
In 1942, Koichi Tohei graduated from the Economics Department of Keio University. In February 1944, after receiving military training, Tohei Sensei was sent leading an infantry unit into occupied China. There he understood, under enemy fire, the importance of calming one&#x27;s mind in the One Point in the lower abdomen (&quot;seika no itten&quot;). Because of the lack of doctors, Tohei developed during the war the principles of what he later named Kiatsu Therapy, based on sending Ki through the fingertips.
He saw action in China and was stranded there at the end of the war until his repatriation in 1946. Tohei Sensei stated on several occasions that Ki principles such as &quot;extend Ki&quot; and &quot;relax completely&quot; leaving things up to the Universe helped him to stay safe during the war, along with the eighty men under his command.

==Post-war years==
Beginning in 1953 Koichi Tohei Sensei was responsible for the introduction of Aikido to the West, mainly through regular teaching journeys to Hawaii, but also continental US and Europe. It was the first time the Founder of Aikido allowed for the art to be taught outside Japan. For that reason, Hawaii became a center for diffusion of Aikido in the United States, and remains today an important place for Ki-Aikido.
During his years at the Aikikai, Tohei Sensei taught Aikido to many famous Shihan like Hiroshi Tada, Sadateru Arikawa, Seigo Yamaguchi, Shigenobu Okumura, Kazuo Chiba, Yoshimitsu Yamada and Steven Seagal.

In 1969, Tohei was asked by Ueshiba to accept the new rank of 10th dan, which Tohei accepted, after having previously refused the same offer. The top rank in aikido had been 8th dan, but the ranks were expanded by Ueshiba for practical as well as political reasons.

The above statement may be inaccurate as Gozo Shioda of Yoshinkan Aikido had been awarded the rank of 9th Dan by Ueshiba eight years before any other 9th dans, in 1961.

==Creation of the Ki no Kenkyukai==
The events leading up to the split between the main aikido organization, the Aikikai, and Tohei were fueled with the death of Morihei Ueshiba in 1969. His son Kisshomaru Ueshiba inherited the title of Doshu. At the time of Ueshiba&#x27;s death, Tohei was chief instructor of the Hombu Dojo, the headquarters of Aikikai, a title he retained until his official split from Aikikai in 1974.

One of the major causes of the conflict arose from Tohei&#x27;s emphasis on his principle of ki in aikido. Tohei wanted aikido to focus on these principles, using exercises to both cultivate and test ki in the daily aikido practice. He had already started teaching his new ideas during his own training sessions at Hombu dojo, but the majority of the other instructors would not. There were some who agreed with Tohei&#x27;s approach, but Tohei&#x27;s actions were not welcomed by Kisshomaru and most of the senior instructors. They strongly encouraged him not to teach his principles and techniques in the Hombu Dojo. Tohei replied that he had the right to teach it outside Hombu Dojo, which he did.

But the tensions remained among the senior cadre of instructors, who still did not approve of Tohei&#x27;s focus upon ki. These brewing tensions together with Tohei&#x27;s general dissatisfaction with the situation culminated in 1971 when he created the Ki No Kenkyukai, with the purpose of promoting the development and cultivation of ki inside aikido, but outside the Aikikai &quot;umbrella&quot;. The years of conflict finally cemented Tohei&#x27;s decision to break away from the Aikikai and teach his own &#x27;ki&#x27; style of aikido. On 1 May 1974, Koichi Tohei officially left the Aikikai organization to concentrate on his newly created Ki-aikido and Ki-society.

On 15 May 1974, Tohei sent a letter in English and Japanese to the majority of the dojos both in Japan and abroad, explaining his reasons for the breakaway and his plans involving Ki-aikido and the Ki-society. This breakup came as a shock to many aikidoka throughout the dojos of the world. Tohei was well regarded by many instructors and students. He was seen as the foremost sensei of Aikido after Ueshiba&#x27;s death. This, in turn, led to several dojos breaking with the Aikikai and joining Tohei in his new style. Tohei&#x27;s new objective was to coordinate all the dojos who joined him and incorporate them into the organization of Shin Shin Toitsu Aikido: &quot;Aikido with Mind and Body Coordinated&quot;. This branch of aikido is still active today even though Tohei himself retired from the day-to-day business of the Ki-aikido section and then concentrated solely on the Ki-society and further personal development of ki.

===Notable students===
Both before and during his position as head instructor at the Hombu Dojo, Tohei instructed many notable aikidoka. Several of these have since made lasting impacts on aikido in general.

==Death==
Tohei died at 9:14 AM, Japan time (GMT +9) on May 19, 2011, after two weeks of being admitted in hospital due to a discomfort in his chest which proved to be inflammation in the lungs. Wataru Hatakeyama, of the Ki Society Headquarters, stated &quot;he went to intensive-care unit (ICU) twice and came back to general ward each time with his strength of Ki, however, his heart got weak little by little this morning and he passed away.&quot;

<text>Donald Kalish (December 4, 1919 – June 8, 2000) was an American logician, educator, and anti-war activist.

==Biography==

Born in Chicago, Illinois, Kalish earned his bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees in psychology and his doctorate in philosophy at the University of California, Berkeley. After teaching at Swarthmore College and at UC Berkeley, he joined the faculty of the University of California, Los Angeles in 1949.

Kalish was perhaps best known for his outspoken opposition to the war in Vietnam and later, his opposition to U.S. military involvement in Nicaragua and Grenada. As chairman of the philosophy department of UCLA, Kalish hired Marxist political activist Angela Davis, an act that drew considerable controversy at the time. In 2001, the university&#x27;s Philosophy Department initiated the Donald Kalish Prize for intellectual excellence, given to the most promising undergraduate student in the department.

Kalish was a founder of the Concerned Faculty of UCLA. He served as a member of the University Committee on Vietnam, and as vice-chairman of Peace Action Council, Los Angeles. He is known for his leadership role with the Peace Action Council in a 1967 protest against President Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s Vietnam policies at the Century Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles, which brought out 10,000 people. He was also an organizer of the 1967 March on the Pentagon to protest the Vietnam War and his activities were prominently chronicled in Norman Mailer&#x27;s The Armies of the Night (1968).

In 1967, Kalish signed a letter declaring his intention to refuse to pay taxes in protest against the U.S. war against Vietnam, and urging other people to also take this stand.

Kalish was an expert on logic, set theory and the history of both subjects. With Richard Montague, he developed an innovative and elegant method of doing formal logical proofs by natural deduction.

Kalish was a first-rate and devoted teacher, who taught with precision, compassion and enthusiasm. He was the proverbial &quot;teacher&#x27;s teacher,&quot; having the rare ability of being able to make even the most complex and arcane concepts readily comprehensible to his students. Most of his students loved his classes. In his logic and set theory classes, students did not see anything of his political opinions. He regularly gave his students his home phone number with the instruction that if they ever wanted to discuss an assignment, to call him anytime, day or night.

==Method of logical proof==
When a proof is done by the Kalish and Montague method, the lines have an indented structure of &quot;proofs within proofs.&quot; The first line of the outermost proof always starts with the word &quot;Show&quot; followed by the statement to be proven. Additional &quot;Show&quot; lines can appear anywhere within the proof, thereby commencing sub-proofs. Immediately after a &quot;Show&quot; line, the subsequent lines are indented one level. When a proof at any level is completed, a box is drawn around the lines in that indentation, making them inaccessible thereafter, and the word &quot;Show&quot; is canceled, whereupon the statement after the canceled &quot;Show&quot; becomes an active line, accessible at the next level out. A proof is finished when all the lines except the first line are enclosed in one or more boxes, and the word &quot;Show&quot; on the first line is canceled. The method is extremely elegant and greatly aides the understanding and teaching of logic.

The proof system is set forth in detail in &quot;Logic: Techniques of Formal Reasoning&quot; by Richard Montague and Donald Kalish, which was published in 1964. Montague died in 1971. Kalish published a second edition of the book in 1980 with Gary Mar. Since the late 1960s, these books have been used as a textbook at many universities, including UCLA.

<text>Walter E. Grauman (March 17, 1922 – March 20, 2015) was an American director of stage shows, films and television shows.

==Early life==
Grauman was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin to Jacob and Irene Grauman, both children of German immigrants who married after settling in the United States. His father, Jacob Grauman, was president of a film distributing company.

In his early years, Grauman lived in Shorewood, Wisconsin, a suburb of Milwaukee, and later moved to Arizona where he attended the University of Arizona. He served for four years in the United States Army Air Forces flying 56 combat missions over Europe in a B-25 in the Twelfth Air Force and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross before moving to California, where his mother was living at the time.

==Entertainment industry==
After spending a few years running his own business, Grauman eventually took a job as stage manager at NBC&#x27;s studios in Los Angeles. During his stint working at the network, he and relative (by marriage) Alan Armer developed a talent-show type program that proved popular, setting the mold for shows like &quot;Star Search&quot; and &quot;American Idol&quot; to follow.

In 1957, Grauman turned to films, directing &quot;The Disembodied&quot; for the &quot;B film&quot; division of Allied Artists Studios, which was headed by friend Walter Mirisch. Although he directed only six theatrical films, Grauman had one of the most active and long lasting television careers in history which included work on such shows as &quot;The Untouchables&quot;, &quot;The Fugitive&quot;, &quot;Route 66&quot;, &quot;The Streets of San Francisco&quot;, &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; and &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;. He also reportedly helped to get Michael Douglas one of his first jobs as a lead on &quot;The Streets of San Francisco&quot;.

Grauman directed &quot;633 Squadron&quot;, a World War II film about a fictional squadron in the British RAF. In interviews, George Lucas has commented that he patterned the &quot;trench run&quot; sequence in his &quot;Star Wars: Episode IV&quot; on a scene from this film. (See the article on &quot;633 Squadron&quot; for more information.)

Grauman also directed a number of made-for-TV films, including the Aaron Spelling produced 1970 supernatural horror film &quot;Crowhaven Farm&quot;. Broadcast as an &quot;ABC Movie of the Week&quot; on 24 November 1970 and starring Hope Lange and Paul Burke, the film involves witchcraft, déjà vu, death, betrayal, revenge, and reincarnation, and it has become a cult classic.
Grauman was the creator/executive producer of the Los Angeles Spotlight Awards (not to be confused with the Spotlight Awards (GDC) for game developers), which are run through the Los Angeles Music Center. He was among the closest living relatives to Sid Grauman, owner and founder of Los Angeles&#x27; famous Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theater, Egyptian Theater and Million Dollar Theater. At the time of his death in 2015 at the age of 93, he resided in Los Angeles with his wife.

<text>The Adventures of Pluto Nash is a 2002 American science fiction action comedy film directed by Ron Underwood and starring Eddie Murphy (in a dual role), Randy Quaid, Rosario Dawson, Joe Pantoliano, Jay Mohr, Luis Guzmán, James Rebhorn, Peter Boyle, Pam Grier, and John Cleese. The film was released in the United States on August 16, 2002.

A critical and financial failure, the film was universally panned by moviegoers and critics alike. It is notable for being one of the biggest box office bombs of all time and has appeared on several lists of worst films ever made.

==Plot==
In 2080, there is a colony on the Moon called Little America. Businessman, entrepreneur, retired smuggler, and ex-convict Pluto Nash buys a nightclub in an attempt to fulfill his long-time wish and to prevent the murder of the club&#x27;s previous owner, his old friend Anthony Frankowski, by mobsters Gino and his nephew, Larry. With the help of his friend Miguel and an android named Bruno, Pluto cleans it up and turns it into a very popular nightclub.

Seven years later in 2087, a young woman named Dina Lake, the daughter of a friend of Pluto&#x27;s, Nicky Sticks, is stranded on the Moon and needs to earn money for transport back to Earth. Pluto gives her a job as a server. Pluto is accosted by Mogan and Kelp, henchmen of mysterious entrepreneur and businessman Rex Crater, who wants to buy the club. When Pluto refuses, the henchmen use bombs to destroy the club. Pluto, Dina, and Bruno manage to escape.

Pluto&#x27;s friend Rowland, a retired police detective who also knows Pluto&#x27;s mother, Flura, learns that Rex Crater has associates linked to human cloning. While Pluto and Dina investigate further, Crater&#x27;s assassins strike, but Pluto and Dina escape by hijacking a limo driven by a holographic chauffeur named James.

Their investigation further links Michael &quot;Mike&quot; Zoroaster Marucci to Crater. They are again attacked and chased by Crater&#x27;s henchmen; they barely escape and are then rescued by Felix Laranga, a local smuggler who idolizes Pluto Nash. They infiltrate Crater&#x27;s casino/hotel at Moon Beach.

Pluto finally confronts Crater, who reveals himself to be a clone of Pluto. Crater has shot both Marucci and Dr. Runa Pendankin into orbit and established his own criminal enterprise. When Mogan and Kelp arrive, Crater kills them for their incompetence. He and Pluto then fight, with himself ultimately being thrown through a window to his death.

Sometime later, a celebration is held at the fully renovated Club Pluto, where Dina puts on a performance as a singer, with Nash as the owner once again.

==Development==
Neil Cuthbert&#x27;s script had been in development with producer Martin Bregman since at least 1983 under the shorter title &quot;Pluto Nash&quot;. Directors Rick Rosenthal and Peter Faiman were attached to the project at different times. Various stars including Harrison Ford were rumored to have considered doing the film. Eddie Murphy became attached to the film while it was in development at Castle Rock Entertainment. The company, which had previously worked with director Ron Underwood on &quot;City Slickers&quot;, sent Underwood the script. Underwood signed on to the film after the release of his film &quot;Mighty Joe Young&quot;. Different writers were hired to revise the script over a period of several months, but Eddie Murphy &quot;kept rejecting the scripts,&quot; according to Underwood. Murphy asked for a &quot;straight&quot; script, like one that would be written for Sylvester Stallone or Harrison Ford, and said that he would &quot;bring the comedy.&quot; Underwood delivered this to Murphy but believed that the script still had &quot;problems&quot; and hired another writer to continue to work on it during production.

==Production==
Ron Underwood was dissatisfied with the results of the film as he was shooting it. &quot;I knew we didn&#x27;t have the kind of wit and the fun that I would want...I felt that it was not really working fully...But it wasn&#x27;t very obvious how to correct it.&quot; He praised the talents of the cast and crew and said that he enjoyed working with Eddie Murphy, but said that Murphy &quot;wasn&#x27;t feeling that funny, I don&#x27;t think.&quot; The result was that Underwood was on the production for four years. A review of a version of the film (with no special effects) that was published on Ain&#x27;t It Cool News in January 2001 did not help matters, as Castle Rock Entertainment became spooked and commissioned two weeks of reshoots in Los Angeles that pushed the film&#x27;s budget to $100 million and miss a release date intended to be in April 2001.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
&quot;The Adventures of Pluto Nash&quot; was critically panned. Rotten Tomatoes ranked the film 79th in the 100 worst 2000s decade movies list, with a rating of 5% based on 91 reviews. The critical consensus states, &quot;&quot;The Adventures of Pluto Nash&quot; is neither adventurous nor funny, and Eddie Murphy is on autopilot in this notorious box office bomb.&quot; On Metacritic, it holds a 12 out of 100 based on 12 reviews, meaning “overwhelming dislike”. Joe Leydon was one of the few critics to give it a positive review calling it &quot;a prodigious popcorn flick that may be the most undeserving victim of critical overkill since &quot;Town and Country&quot;&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;C−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

&quot;Pluto Nash&quot; was nominated for five Golden Raspberry Awards in 2003 including Worst Picture, Worst Actor (Eddie Murphy), Worst Director, Worst Screenplay, and Worst Screen Couple (Murphy and himself cloned), but failed to win any. It was later nominated for Worst Comedy of Our First 25 Years at the 25th Golden Raspberry Awards in 2005, but lost to &quot;Gigli&quot;.

Eddie Murphy poked fun at himself in an interview with Barbara Walters, saying, &quot;I know the two or three people that liked this movie.&quot;

About the movie&#x27;s reception, Joe Pantoliano said: &quot;You usually can’t tell when a movie is going to be shit, but on that one you could. And I think Ron Underwood, the director, got victimized by that, because that guy is good. But because of the material and the style in which some players came to work, we were off the mark, you know? A lot of hanky-panky going on there. So, I wasn’t surprised. I was surprised it turned out to be better than I thought it was going to be.&quot;

Director Ron Underwood expressed regret that the movie didn&#x27;t have a &quot;core piece of storytelling like the mid-life crisis&quot; and said he thinks &quot;the film was not very good.&quot;

===Box office===
&quot;The Adventures of Pluto Nash&quot; was a box-office bomb, with its budget estimated at $100 million and domestic box office $4,420,080 and $2,683,893 overseas. It had a total worldwide gross of $7,103,973. In 2014, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; listed the film as one of the most expensive box office flops of all time.

===Home media===
The film was released on DVD and VHS on November 19, 2002 by Warner Home Video.

<text>Slip-Slop-Slap (originally Slip! Slop! Drop!) is a mnemonic slogan for reducing unhealthy sun exposure by &quot;slipping&quot; on a shirt or rash guard, &quot;slopping&quot; on sunscreen, and &quot;slapping&quot; on a sun hat. It was prominent in Australia and New Zealand during the 1980s, originating as the jingle in a televised public service announcement in which an anthropomorphic mascot named Sid the Seagull would sing and dance to the phrase. 

The campaign, originally funded by public donations, was launched by Cancer Council Victoria in 1981 to combat high rates of skin cancer in Australia, and achieved high nationwide awareness over its original run. It was briefly and less successfully revived in 2010, with Sid the Seagull singing to a revised jingle &quot;Slip, Slop, Slap, Seek and Slide&quot;, adding &quot;seeking&quot; shade and &quot;sliding&quot; on wraparound sunglasses to the advice. An alternate version known as &quot;Slip, Slop, Slap and Wrap&quot; was used in New Zealand, where the mascot was a tiger prawn named Tiger, voiced by Anthony Samuels from &quot;What Now&quot;. Some Canadian cities have also started their own Slip-Slop-Slap campaigns. In Britain, it was featured in a &quot;BBC Breakfast&quot; report on 27 June 2011.

In November 2023, the &quot;National Film and Sound Archive&quot; added the &quot;Slip! Slop! Slap! Jingle&quot; performed by Peter Best and Phillip Adams to the &quot;Sounds of Australia&quot; register for songs of &quot;cultural, historical and aesthetic significance and relevance&quot;.

== Effect on cancer rates ==
Since this campaign was introduced along with advertisements and a jingle, the incidence of the two most common forms of skin cancer (basal-cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma) in Australia has decreased. However, the incidence of melanoma, the most lethal form of skin cancer, has increased. However, statistical analysis from the Australian Government&#x27;s &quot;Australian Institute of Health and Welfare&quot; found this increased incidence risk is almost entirely in the older (over-60 years) population, who lived the majority of their lives before the importance of sun safety was widely known, whereas the rate of incidence of melanoma by age 30 has consistently dropped from its peak in 1997, having halved in the time to 2020. Meanwhile, risk of melanoma incidence by age 60 has remained stable since 2011. An epidemiological study published in 2002 concluded that skin cancer increases could not be associated with the use of sun creams, and recommended continued use of the current campaigns as a means to reduce melanoma risk.

The experience of more than 25 years of skin cancer prevention in Australia shows broad-based multifaceted public education programs can improve a population&#x27;s sun protective behaviors and reducing sunburn, a short-term marker of skin cancer risk. Furthermore, declining skin cancer incidence in younger cohorts and economic assessment show skin cancer prevention programs are an eminently worthwhile investment.

<text>The inhibitor protein (IP) is situated in the mitochondrial matrix and protects the cell against rapid ATP hydrolysis during momentary ischaemia. In oxygen absence, the pH of the matrix drops. This causes IP to become protonated and change its conformation to one that can bind to the F1Fo synthetase and stops it thereby preventing it from moving in a backwards direction and hydrolyze ATP instead of make it. When oxygen is finally incorporated into the system, the pH rises and IP is deprotonated. IP dissociates from the F1Fo synthetase and allows it to resume its ATP synthesis.

<text>Ghulam Faruque Khan HPk, CIE, OBE (7 October 1899 – 29 April 1992) was a Pakistani politician and businessman who was the founder of Ghulam Faruque Group.

As a politician, he became Governor of East Pakistan and Federal Minister for Commerce, Science and Technology where he served from 1964 to 1967. He was also member of the National Assembly of Pakistan from 1973 to 1977 and member of the Senate of Pakistan from 1985 to 1991 and again from 1991 until his death. He was also the founder of Pakistani conglomerate Ghulam Faruque Group.

==Early life and education==
Ghulam Faruque Khan was born on October 7, 1899, in Midnapore. He was the son of Khan Mir Aslam Khan Khattak (1841–1922), a landlord, social worker, civil contractor and Muslim leader of Nagpur who donated huge amount of money to Muslims education and always stood for the rights of Muslims. Mir Aslam Khan was a Pashtun of the Akor Khel Khattak tribe and was born in the house of Nawab Khan Khattak. His father was Rasual Khan Khattak of Shaidu Khan Khel, which is a village in Nowshera tehsil, Peshawar District of British India (now in Nowshera District of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, in Pakistan). Shaidu is home to the Akor Khel, ruling khel of the Khattak tribe, as well as to the Mohallah Khan Khel (Khel stands for a family or descendants) clan who came here when two sons of Khushal Khan Khattak, named Shahbaz Khan Khattak and Abdul Qadir Khan Khattak, came from Akora Khattak to Shaidu. The two larger groups of Khan Khel descend from the brothers. The Akor Khels, a clan named after Akoray, still hold a prominent position in the Khattak tribe.

He received his education from Aligarh Mohamedan Anglo Oriental College.

==Career==
Faruque began his career with the Bengal–Nagpur Railway in 1921, eventually serving as General Manager of the East Indian Railways (1946–1948).

He also held several other governmental roles, including Federal Minister for Commerce, Defence Advisor (1965–1967), chairman of the Investment Corporation of Pakistan, Secretary of the Ministry of Industry, and Minister for Finance, Planning and Development of the NWFP Province.

<doc id="1331441" wikidata="Q302088" url="?curid=1331441" title="Document classification">
<text>Document classification or document categorization is a problem in library science, information science and computer science. The task is to assign a document to one or more classes or categories. This may be done &quot;manually&quot; (or &quot;intellectually&quot;) or algorithmically. The intellectual classification of documents has mostly been the province of library science, while the algorithmic classification of documents is mainly in information science and computer science. The problems are overlapping, however, and there is therefore interdisciplinary research on document classification.

The documents to be classified may be texts, images, music, etc. Each kind of document possesses its special classification problems. When not otherwise specified, text classification is implied.

Documents may be classified according to their subjects or according to other attributes (such as document type, author, printing year etc.). In the rest of this article only subject classification is considered. There are two main philosophies of subject classification of documents: the content-based approach and the request-based approach.

==&quot;Content-based&quot; versus &quot;request-based&quot; classification==
Content-based classification is classification in which the weight given to particular subjects in a document determines the class to which the document is assigned. It is, for example, a common rule for classification in libraries, that at least 20% of the content of a book should be about the class to which the book is assigned. In automatic classification it could be the number of times given words appears in a document.

Request-oriented classification (or -indexing) is classification in which the anticipated request from users is influencing how documents are being classified. The classifier asks themself: “Under which descriptors should this entity be found?” and “think of all the possible queries and decide for which ones the entity at hand is relevant” (Soergel, 1985, p. 230).

Request-oriented classification may be classification that is targeted towards a particular audience or user group. For example, a library or a database for feminist studies may classify/index documents differently when compared to a historical library. It is probably better, however, to understand request-oriented classification as &quot;policy-based classification&quot;: The classification is done according to some ideals and reflects the purpose of the library or database doing the classification. In this way it is not necessarily a kind of classification or indexing based on user studies. Only if empirical data about use or users are applied should request-oriented classification be regarded as a user-based approach.

==Classification versus indexing==
Sometimes a distinction is made between assigning documents to classes (&quot;classification&quot;) versus assigning subjects to documents (&quot;subject indexing&quot;) but as Frederick Wilfrid Lancaster has argued, this distinction is not fruitful. &quot;These terminological distinctions,” he writes, “are quite meaningless and only serve to cause confusion” (Lancaster, 2003, p. 21). The view that this distinction is purely superficial is also supported by the fact that a classification system may be transformed into a thesaurus and vice versa (cf., Aitchison, 1986, 2004; Broughton, 2008; Riesthuis &amp; Bliedung, 1991). Therefore, the act of labeling a document (say by assigning a term from a controlled vocabulary to a document) is at the same time to assign that document to the class of documents indexed by that term (all documents indexed or classified as X belong to the same class of documents). In other words, labeling a document is the same as assigning it to the class of documents indexed under that label. 

==Automatic document classification (ADC)==
Automatic document classification tasks can be divided into three sorts: supervised document classification where some external mechanism (such as human feedback) provides information on the correct classification for documents, unsupervised document classification (also known as document clustering), where the classification must be done entirely without reference to external information, and semi-supervised document classification, where parts of the documents are labeled by the external mechanism. There are several software products under various license models available.

=== Techniques ===
Automatic document classification techniques include:

* Artificial neural network
* Concept Mining
* Decision trees such as ID3 or C4.5
* Expectation maximization (EM)
* Instantaneously trained neural networks
* Latent semantic indexing
* Multiple-instance learning
* Naive Bayes classifier
* Natural language processing approaches
* Rough set-based classifier
* Soft set-based classifier
* Support vector machines (SVM)
* K-nearest neighbour algorithms
* tf–idf

== Applications ==
Classification techniques have been applied to
* spam filtering, a process which tries to discern E-mail spam messages from legitimate emails
* email routing, sending an email sent to a general address to a specific address or mailbox depending on topic
* language identification, automatically determining the language of a text
* genre classification, automatically determining the genre of a text
* readability assessment, automatically determining the degree of readability of a text, either to find suitable materials for different age groups or reader types or as part of a larger text simplification system
* sentiment analysis, determining the attitude of a speaker or a writer with respect to some topic or the overall contextual polarity of a document.
* health-related classification using social media in public health surveillance 
* article triage, selecting articles that are relevant for manual literature curation, for example as is being done as the first step to generate manually curated annotation databases in biology

<doc id="1331442" wikidata="Q46275" url="?curid=1331442" title="New Zealand Subantarctic Islands">
<text>The New Zealand Subantarctic Islands comprise the five southernmost groups of the New Zealand outlying islands. They are collectively designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Most of the islands lie near the southeast edge of the largely submerged continent centred on New Zealand called Zealandia, which was riven from Australia 60–85 million years ago, and from Antarctica 85–130 million years ago. They share some features with Australia&#x27;s Macquarie Island to the west.

== History ==
Until 1995, scientific research staff were stationed permanently at a meteorological station on Campbell Island. Since then, the islands have been uninhabited, though they are periodically visited by researchers and tourists. Protection of reserves was strengthened in 2014, becoming the largest natural sanctuary in the nation.

== Islands ==
; Antipodes Islands: Antipodes Island, Bollons Island, the Windward Islands, Orde Lees Island, Leeward Island, South Islet
; Auckland Islands: Auckland Island, Adams Island, Disappointment Island, Enderby Island, Ewing Island, Rose Island
; Bounty Islands: Main Group, Centre Group, and Eastern Group islets
; Campbell Islands: Campbell Island / Motu Ihupuku, Dent Island, Folly Island, Jacquemart Island
; Snares Islands / Tini Heke: Alert Stack, Broughton Island, High Island, North East Island, Western Chain islets

=== Territorial claims ===
New Zealand also has territorial claims, held in abeyance under the Antarctic Treaty System, over several islands close to the Antarctic mainland, including:

* Ross Island and the rest of the Ross Archipelago
* Balleny Islands: Young Island, Buckle Island, Sturge Island, plus several smaller islets
* Roosevelt Island
* Scott Island and Haggits Pillar

Of these, Ross Island is inhabited by the scientific staff of several research stations, notably at McMurdo Sound and Scott Base.

==Ecology==
The Antipodes, Auckland, Bounty and Campbell Islands are collectively designated the &quot;Antipodean Islands&quot; in the World Geographical Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions. The Snares Islands / Tini Heke are included with the South Island in &quot;New Zealand South&quot; under the scheme.

<doc id="1331454" wikidata="Q1872260" url="?curid=1331454" title="Loulie Jean Norman">
<text>Loulie Jean Norman (March 12, 1913 - August 2, 2005) was a coloratura soprano who worked with arranger Gordon Jenkins. Jenkins and Norman collaborated on a number of albums. Norman was also a member of The Rhythmaires and the Ray Conniff Singers.

==Career==
Norman was born in Birmingham, Alabama. During her adolescence in Birmingham at Phillips High School, and later at Birmingham–Southern College, it became apparent that she was a gifted soprano with a four-octave range. Initially, she wanted to pursue opera, but she decided to move to New York to try for a career as a radio singer. Her beauty led to modeling jobs and, in 1936, she joined The Rhythm Singers on Kay Thompson’s Chesterfield Program. She married naval pilot Norman Price and eventually moved to Los Angeles where they raised four children. In 1940, Norman was selected as the summer replacement for Dinah Shore on the NBC radio program &quot;The Chamber Music Society of Lower Basin Street.&quot;

Norman became a member of the successful singing group, The Campus Kids, who worked with Kay Kyser. Another member of the group was Judd Conlon and he formed a new group called The Rhythmaires which began as backing singers on Bing Crosby’s Philco show. Crosby singled Norman out several times on radio for solo passages which required an obbligato. She was once introduced by him as &quot;The Lorelei from Birmingham, Alabama&quot; and another time as &quot;The Hartz Mountain Canary.&quot; A favorite standard of Crosby&#x27;s, &quot;Whispering Hope,&quot; was reprised on his Chesterfield show with his brother Bob Crosby, and Norman was given the role of performing their sister Catherine’s part.

Norman appeared as a member of The Mel-Tones on Mel Torme’s recording of &quot;California Suite&quot;, and many popular arrangers and conductors used her on their albums. She recorded with Sam Cooke and provided the voice of The Future on Frank Sinatra&#x27;s &quot;&quot; album.

Norman contributed to several films: &quot;The Big Hangover&quot;, &quot;Dream Wife&quot;, &quot;G.I. Blues&quot;, &quot;Blue Hawaii&quot; (in which she sang with Elvis Presley on &quot;Moonlight Swim&quot;), &quot;Too Late Blues&quot;, and &quot;A Boy Named Charlie Brown&quot;. Jerry Lewis secured her for the role of the Princess for the cast of the soundtrack album of &quot;Cinderfella&quot;.

Her television credits included frequent appearances on &quot;The Dinah Shore Show&quot;, &quot;The Dean Martin Show&quot;, and &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;. Norman delivered the non-lexical vocables over Alexander Courage&#x27;s opening theme song for the first season of &quot;Star Trek&quot;. The music was remixed without Norman’s voice for the show’s second and third season so the producers could avoid paying her royalties.

==Other significant singing roles==
During the 1960s, she recorded as a member of various easy-listening choral groups, most notably the Ray Conniff Singers. A few notable songs she can be heard in are The Tokens&#x27; rendition of &quot;The Lion Sleeps Tonight&quot; and the Disney Parks song &quot;Grim Grinning Ghosts&quot;. (Wikipedia articles on &quot;The Lion Sleeps Tonight&quot; say that it was Anita Darian on &quot;The Lion Sleeps Tonight.&quot;)

Norman voiced Penelope Pinfeather in &quot;Melody&quot; and &quot;Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom&quot;. She was a member of an all-female singing group, the G-6, with Henry Mancini&#x27;s wife.

==Death==
Norman died on August 2, 2005, in Studio City,California.

<doc id="1331457" wikidata="Q912297" url="?curid=1331457" title="Federated identity">
<text>A federated identity in information technology is the means of linking a person&#x27;s electronic identity and attributes, stored across multiple distinct identity management systems.

Federated identity is related to single sign-on (SSO), in which a user&#x27;s single authentication ticket, or token, is trusted across multiple IT systems or even organizations. SSO is a subset of federated identity management, as it relates only to authentication and is understood on the level of technical interoperability, and it would not be possible without some sort of federation.

==Management==

In information technology (IT), federated identity management (FIdM) amounts to having a common set of policies, practices and protocols in place to manage the identity and trust into IT users and devices across organizations.

Single sign-on (SSO) systems allow a single user authentication process across multiple IT systems or even organizations. SSO is a subset of federated identity management, as it relates only to authentication and technical interoperability.

Centralized identity management solutions were created to help deal with user and data security where the user and the systems they accessed were within the same network – or at least the same &quot;domain of control&quot;. Increasingly, however, users are accessing external systems which are fundamentally outside their domain of control, and external users are accessing internal systems. The increasingly common separation of the user from the systems requiring access is an inevitable by-product of the decentralization brought about by the integration of the Internet into every aspect of both personal and business life. Evolving identity management challenges, and especially the challenges associated with cross-company, cross-domain access, have given rise to a new approach to identity management, known now as &quot;federated identity management&quot;.

FIdM, or the &quot;federation&quot; of identity, describes the technologies, standards and use-cases which serve to enable the portability of identity information across otherwise autonomous security domains. The ultimate goal of identity federation is to enable users of one domain to securely access data or systems of another domain seamlessly, and without the need for completely redundant user administration. Identity federation comes in many flavors, including &quot;user-controlled&quot; or &quot;user-centric&quot; scenarios, as well as enterprise-controlled or business-to-business scenarios.

Federation is enabled through the use of open industry standards and/or openly published specifications, such that multiple parties can achieve interoperability for common use-cases. Typical use-cases involve things such as cross-domain, web-based single sign-on, cross-domain user account provisioning, cross-domain entitlement management and cross-domain user attribute exchange.

Use of identity federation standards can reduce cost by eliminating the need to scale one-off or proprietary solutions. It can increase security and lower risk by enabling an organization to identify and authenticate a user once, and then use that identity information across multiple systems, including external partner websites. It can improve privacy compliance by allowing the user to control what information is shared, or by limiting the amount of information shared. And lastly, it can drastically improve the end-user experience by eliminating the need for new account registration through automatic &quot;federated provisioning&quot; or the need to redundantly login through cross-domain single sign-on.

The notion of identity federation is extremely broad, and also evolving. It could involve user-to-user and user-to-application as well as application-to-application use-case scenarios at both the browser tier and the web services or service-oriented architecture (SOA) tier. It can involve high-trust, high-security scenarios as well as low-trust, low-security scenarios. The levels of identity assurance that may be required for a given scenario are also being standardized through a common and open Identity Assurance Framework. It can involve user-centric use-cases, as well as enterprise-centric use-cases. The term &quot;identity federation&quot; is by design a generic term, and is not bound to any one specific protocol, technology, implementation or company. Identity federations may be bi-lateral relationships or multilateral relationships. In the latter case, the multilateral federation frequently occurs in a vertical market, such as in law enforcement (such as the National Identity Exchange Federation - NIEF), and research and education (such as InCommon). If the identity federation is bilateral, the two parties can exchange the necessary metadata (assertion signing keys, etc.) to implement the relationship. In a multilateral federation, the metadata exchange among participants is a more complex issue. It can be handled in a hub-and-spoke exchange or by the distribution of a metadata aggregate by a federated operator.

One thing that is consistent, however, is the fact that &quot;federation&quot; describes methods of identity portability which are achieved in an open, often standards-based manner – meaning anyone adhering to the open specification or standard can achieve the full spectrum of use-cases and interoperability.

Identity federation can be accomplished any number of ways, some of which involve the use of formal Internet standards, such as the OASIS Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) specification, and some of which may involve open-source technologies and/or other openly published specifications (e.g. Information Cards, OpenID, the Higgins trust framework or Novell&#x27;s Bandit project).

==Technologies==
Technologies used for federated identity include SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language), OAuth, OpenID, Security Tokens (Simple Web Tokens, JSON Web Tokens, and SAML assertions), Web Service Specifications, and Windows Identity Foundation.

==Government initiatives==
===United States===
In the United States, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), through the National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence, has published a building block white paper in December 2016 on this topic

The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) is a government-wide program that provides a standardized approach to security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring for cloud products and services.

FedRAMP enables Agencies to rapidly adapt from old, insecure legacy IT to mission-enabling, secure, and cost-effective cloud-based IT.

==Examples==
Digital identity platforms that allow users to log onto third-party websites, applications, mobile devices and gaming systems with their existing identity, i.e. enable social login, include:

<text>The Astrocam 110 (or Astrocam) is a model rocket with a built-in camera for taking aerial photographs.
The Astrocam was introduced in the 1979 Catalog by its manufacturer Estes and it can be flown with B6-4 and C6-7 model rocket motors (see Model rocket motor classification). The Astrocam was available as kit, or as ready-to-fly model. Both versions use the Estes Delta II launch body. The camera uses 110 film and is mounted in the nose cone of the rocket with the aperture perpendicular to the main axis of the rocket. A mirror held in a hood is used like a periscope to enable the camera to look forward. The camera needs to be manually advanced and &quot;cocked&quot; by pulling a string attached to spring-loaded shutter taut. When the nose cone is placed on the rocket body, the string is placed between the nose cone and the body so that when the ejection charge of the engine expels the nose cone, the string is released causing one frame of film to be exposed. Since the rocket is not steerable, the photographer can not determine what the camera will photograph. 

Stock models of the Astrocam were intended to take their photographs after the rocket had begun to descend after reaching apogee. However, in the Winter 1993 issue of the Estes Educator News magazine, two sets of instructions (Lookdown Astrocam, and the Lookdown Astrocam MK11) were included describing how the camera could be converted to look back down the length of the rocket before reaching apogee, or upon a staging event. Estes catalogs showed some of the photographs from these modified rockets, but they never produced a version designed to look down, or capable of being switched at will.

A version of the Astrocam called the Astrocam 110 is also available, and the Estes Snapshot is very similar as well. A modern version of the Astrocam is the Oracle, which shoots video. A newer video version, called the Astrovision, is also available.

<text>Oracle is the name of a model rocket with built-in digital camera, manufactured by Estes Industries, for aerial photography. In contrast to the camera rocket Astrocam, the Oracle allows the making of a complete film of a rocket flight. The Oracle is best flown with a D12 engine (see Estes number coding), but can be flown with C11 engines.
During launch, the camera films downward; showing the launch pad and engine exhaust during ascent. The rocket&#x27;s nose cone may be attached to the parachute in two ways; there are attachments on both ends of the nose cone. Attaching the parachute to the bottom films the parachute during descent. Attaching the parachute to the top films the approach of the ground during descent.
The nose-cone attaches to a PC via USB. The resulting AVI file contains approximately 30 (between 30 and 35) seconds of uncompressed video at 9 frame/s at a resolution of 320 pixels wide by 240 pixels high (320x240). The data rate is 2047 kbit/s. The camera holds only one video at a time.

<text>Jon Woronoff (&quot;Arthur Jon Woronoff&quot;, born 1938) is an American author and editor and previously an interpreter and translator. His primary work has been &quot;historical dictionaries&quot; on various subjects. He is also well known for his books from the late 1970s through 1990s presenting views on East Asia, particularly Japan, which were heterodox at the time, but are now mainstream.

==Biography==
He was born in New York City in 1938, and lived there until the age of about twenty, after which he studied and worked in Europe (with numerous visits to Africa) for about fifteen years, Hong Kong and Japan (with visits to other Asian countries) for about ten years, again five years in the U.S. in Washington, D.C. and since 1991 in France.

He studied at the Bronx High School of Science and New York University, where he received a B.A. in 1959. He obtained a diploma of translator-interpreter at the Interpreter’s School of the University of Geneva in 1962. He then studied at the Graduate Institute of International Studies in Geneva until 1965, when he was granted a licence en sciences politique et economique.

From 1962 and into the early 1990s Woronoff worked as a simultaneous interpreter or translator for numerous international organizations, including the United Nations, World Health Organization, World Meteorological Organization, Organization of African Unity, Economic Commission for Africa, and the U.S. State Department. During the period 1973-79, he founded and managed Interlingua Language Services, with offices in Hong Kong, Tokyo, Manila and New York City.
As of 1970, he was also a free-lance journalist for various newspapers and magazines including Asian Business, Oriental Economist, Nikkei, Toyo Keizai, South China Morning Post, Financial Times Syndication, Asian Wall Street Journal Weekly, etc. He was a special columnist for Mainichi Daily News and Japanalysis. Most of his reporting was devoted to East Asia, especially Japan, Korea, Hong Kong and China, but other places as well, and in the earlier part Africa.

Since 1973, Woronoff has been an external editor for Scarecrow Press and then Rowman &amp; Littlefield of Lanham, Maryland. All his work has dealt with &quot;historical dictionaries&quot; or roughly encyclopedias or encyclopedic dictionaries of countries or broad topics. The first series he initiated was the African Historical Dictionaries, but these were joined over the years by other series, including on Asia and Europe, on literature and the arts, wars, historical periods, U.S. diplomacy and history, professions and industries, religions and philosophies, international organizations, and others. About one thousand of these have been published over the years with about 400 presently in print.

==Writings==

===Japan===
Periodically Jon Woronoff wrote his own books, first on Africa, then on Asia. Most notable among these are the books on Japanese economics, business, and society. His critical approach clashed with conventional wisdom in the 1980s and 90s when Japan was often considered a ‘miracle’ economy. He argued that Japanese management systems were far from ideal, suffering from inefficiency and rigidity. He also insisted that actual living standards in Japan were much lower than the impression given by statistics such as per capita GDP. It could be argued that Japan’s sluggish economic growth in recent decades has vindicated many of his views. Despite controversy when they were first published, many similar ideas are now part of mainstream orthodox opinion on the Japanese economy and society.

===East Asia===
His books on other parts of East Asia, especially Hong Kong, Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and China, were equally controversial, but for the opposite reason. When written, the common opinion was that they were “basket cases” with no hope whatsoever of economic development. Yet, they were already in their takeoff phase and this was emphasized in several hundred newspaper and magazine articles as well as several books. Going against the pundits here also resulted in considerable criticism and refusal by some of the better known periodicals to publish his material. By now, of course, there is no question but that these views were by-and-large correct and paved the way for a better understanding of the dynamics of East Asia.

<text>Aylmer Bourke Lambert (2 February 1761 – 10 January 1842) was a British botanist, one of the first fellows of the Linnean Society.

== Early life ==
Aylmer Bourke Lambert was born at Bath, England on 2 February 1761, the son of Edmund Lambert of Boyton House and Bridget Bourke who was the daughter of the 8th Viscount Mayo. Lambert&#x27;s mother died in 1773, the same year that he started school and through her family he inherited estates in Jamaica and Ireland. Lambert went to Newcome&#x27;s School for the sons of gentlemen at Hackney, and then attended Oxford University for three years.

== Writings ==
He is best known for his work &quot;A description of the genus Pinus&quot;, issued in several parts 1803–1824, a sumptuously illustrated folio volume detailing all of the conifers then known. A second folio edition was produced between 1828 and 1837, and a third, smaller (octavo) edition in 1832. Individual books even of the same edition are often very different from one another, which causes problems when the illustrations have been used as types to fix the application of names. A full description of the publication history is given in:
Renkema, H. W. &amp; Ardagh, J. (1930). Aylmer Bourke Lambert and his &#x27;Description of the Genus Pinus&#x27;. &quot;Journal of the Linnean Society of London – Botany&quot; 48: 439–466.

Many of the new conifers discovered by David Douglas and others, including the Coast Redwood, were described for the first time in Lambert&#x27;s books; several of these were actually described by collaborating authors, notably David Don, who included their work in Lambert&#x27;s book.

== Herbarium ==
Lambert acquired a number of significant herbarium collections including those of Johann Reinhold Forster, Archibald Menzies and Henry de Ponthieu. He also amassed a large collection of specimens and drawings from Australia in the era immediately following the arrival of the First Fleet. Contributors included Governor Arthur Phillip, Surgeon-General John White, Colonel William Paterson, Major Robert Ross, Major Francis Grose and Philip Gidley King.

Lambert&#x27;s collection of 50,000 preserved plant specimens, along with his extensive library, was consulted by authors and botanists including Robert Brown, De Candolle, Martius, George Don and David Don. It was auctioned following his death in 317 lots and specimens can be found in botanical collections around the world.

== Linnean Society ==
Lambert was one of the founding fellows of the Linnean Society in 1788. In 1796 Lambert was appointed by James Edward Smith as one of the four vice-presidents of the Linnean Society of London. He held this position until his death at his home on Kew Green in 1842.
== Royal Society ==
In 1791, Lambert was elected to the Royal Society of London for Improving Natural Knowledge and Joseph Banks made him a member of its Council in 1810.

&quot;He was a friend and correspondent of Sir Joseph Banks, and took a great interest in the botanical and zoological discoveries emerging from New Holland in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, as they were transmitted back to London, whether as living or dead specimens, as seeds, or as drawings. Lambert compiled the collection from Surgeon General John White&#x27;s specimens and drawings brought from Sydney to London in 1795.&quot;

== Honours and memorials ==
Lambert is honoured in the scientific name of the Sugar Pine (&quot;Pinus lambertiana)&quot;, the genus &quot;Lambertia&quot;, and the variegated fairywren (&quot;Malurus lamberti&quot;). The standard botanical author abbreviation Lamb. is applied to species he described.

<doc id="1331479" wikidata="Q1586680" url="?curid=1331479" title="Hispaniolan palm crow">
<text>The Hispaniolan palm crow (Corvus palmarum) is a relatively small corvid endemic to the Caribbean island of Hispaniola (in Haiti and the Dominican Republic) where it was formerly common but is now reduced in population.

==Taxonomy==
The Hispaniolan palm crow was formally described in 1835 under the binomial name &quot;Corvus palmarum&quot; by the German naturalist Duke Paul Wilhelm of Württemberg. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised. This crow was formerly considered to be conspecific with the Cuban palm crow (&quot;Corvus minutus&quot;).

Despite being sympatric with the white-necked crow (&quot;Corvus leucognaphalus&quot;) on Hispaniola, it appears to be more closely related to the fish crow (&quot;C. ossifragus&quot;) of the East Coast of the United States, as well as two smaller species, the Tamaulipas crow (&quot;C. imparatus&quot;) and Sinaloan crow (&quot;C. sinaloae&quot;) of Mexico, than the white-necked crow, which is more related to the Cuban crow (&quot;Corvus nasicus&quot;) and the Jamaican crow (&quot;Corvus jamaicensis&quot;), the other two Caribbean corvids. This indicates two distinct arrivals of crows onto the island (with the ancestor of the two palm crows being a later arrival), and a resulting niche differentiation, similar to &quot;C. nasicus&quot; and &quot;C. minutus&quot; on Cuba.

The following cladogram is based on phylogenetic study of the Corvidae by Knud Jønsson and collaborators that was published in 2012.

==Habitat==
The local name for the palm crow is cao in the Dominican Republic (where it is locally common, mainly in mountain pine forests and also around the area of Lake Enriquillo), which is onomatopoeic of the simple and repetitive call of this bird.

<doc id="1331480" wikidata="Q246599" url="?curid=1331480" title="Gnomonic projection">
<text>A gnomonic projection, also known as a central projection or rectilinear projection, is a perspective projection of a sphere, with center of projection at the sphere&#x27;s center, onto any plane not passing through the center, most commonly a tangent plane. Under gnomonic projection every great circle on the sphere is projected to a straight line in the plane (a great circle is a geodesic on the sphere, the shortest path between any two points, analogous to a straight line on the plane). More generally, a gnomonic projection can be taken of any -dimensional hypersphere onto a hyperplane.

The projection is the -dimensional generalization of the trigonometric tangent which maps from the circle to a straight line, and as with the tangent, every pair of antipodal points on the sphere projects to a single point in the plane, while the points on the plane through the sphere&#x27;s center and parallel to the image plane project to points at infinity; often the projection is considered as a one-to-one correspondence between points in the hemisphere and points in the plane, in which case any finite part of the image plane represents a portion of the hemisphere.

The gnomonic projection is azimuthal (radially symmetric). No shape distortion occurs at the center of the projected image, but distortion increases rapidly away from it.

The gnomonic projection originated in astronomy for constructing sundials and charting the celestial sphere. It is commonly used as a geographic map projection, and can be convenient in navigation because great-circle courses are plotted as straight lines. Rectilinear photographic lenses make a perspective projection of the world onto an image plane; this can be thought of as a gnomonic projection of the image sphere (an abstract sphere indicating the direction of each ray passing through a camera modeled as a pinhole). The gnomonic projection is used in crystallography for analyzing the orientations of lines and planes of crystal structures. It is used in structural geology for analyzing the orientations of fault planes. In computer graphics and computer representation of spherical data, cube mapping is the gnomonic projection of the image sphere onto six faces of a cube.

In mathematics, the space of orientations of undirected lines in 3-dimensional space is called the real projective plane, and is typically pictured either by the &quot;projective sphere&quot; or by its gnomonic projection. When the angle between lines is imposed as a measure of distance, this space is called the elliptic plane. The gnomonic projection of the 3-sphere of unit quaternions, points of which represent 3-dimensional rotations, results in Rodrigues vectors. The gnomonic projection of the hyperboloid of two sheets, treated as a model for the hyperbolic plane, is called the Beltrami–Klein model.

==History==
The gnomonic projection is said to be the oldest map projection, speculatively attributed to Thales who may have used it for star maps in the 6th century BC. The path of the shadow-tip or light-spot in a nodus-based sundial traces out the same hyperbolae formed by parallels on a gnomonic map.

==Properties==
The gnomonic projection is from the centre of a sphere to a plane tangent to the sphere (Fig 1 below). The sphere and the plane touch at the tangent point. Great circles transform to straight lines via the gnomonic projection. Since meridians (lines of longitude) and the equator are great circles, they are always shown as straight lines on a gnomonic map. Since the projection is from the centre of the sphere, a gnomonic map can represent less than half of the area of the sphere. Distortion of the scale of the map increases from the centre (tangent point) to the periphery.

*If the tangent point is one of the poles then the meridians are radial and equally spaced (Fig 2 below). The equator cannot be shown as it is at infinity in all directions. Other parallels (lines of latitude) are depicted as concentric circles.

*If the tangent point is on the equator then the meridians are parallel but not equally spaced (Fig 3 below). The equator is a straight line perpendicular to the meridians. Other parallels are depicted as hyperbolae.

*If the tangent point is not on a pole or the equator, then the meridians are radially outward straight lines from a pole, but not equally spaced (Fig 4 below). The equator is a straight line that is perpendicular to only one meridian, indicating that the projection is not conformal. Other parallels are depicted as conic sections.

As with all azimuthal projections, angles from the tangent point are preserved. The map distance from that point is a function &quot;r&quot;(&quot;d&quot;) of the true distance &quot;d&quot;, given by

:formula_1

where &quot;R&quot; is the radius of the Earth. The radial scale is

:formula_2

and the transverse scale

: formula_3

so the transverse scale increases outwardly, and the radial scale even more.

==Use==

Gnomonic projections are used in seismic work because seismic waves tend to travel along great circles. They are also used by navies in plotting direction finding bearings, since radio signals travel along great circles. Meteors also travel along great circles, with the Gnomonic Atlas Brno 2000.0 being the IMO&#x27;s recommended set of star charts for visual meteor observations. Aircraft and ship navigators use the projection to find the shortest route between start and destination. The track is first drawn on the gnomonic chart, then transferred to a Mercator chart for navigation.

The gnomonic projection is used extensively in photography, where it is called &quot;rectilinear projection&quot;, as it naturally arises from the pinhole camera model where the screen is a plane. Because they are equivalent, the same viewer used for photographic panoramas can be used to render gnomonic maps .

The gnomonic projection is used in astronomy where the tangent point is centered on the object of interest. The sphere being projected in this case is the celestial sphere, &quot;R&quot; = 1, and not the surface of the Earth.

In astronomy, gnomic projection star charts of the celestial sphere can be used by observers to accurately plot the straight line path of a meteor trail.

<text>Alumina Limited is an Australian holding company. Spun off from Western Mining Corporation in 2002, its sole asset is a 40% shareholding in Alcoa World Alumina &amp; Chemicals. In 2024, Alcoa acquired Alumina for US$2.2 billion.

==History==
Alumina was founded in December 2002 when Western Mining Corporation spun off its aluminium and bauxite assets.

Alumina&#x27;s only business activity is as the owner of a 40% share in Alcoa World Alumina &amp; Chemicals (AWAC), a joint venture with Alcoa. 
AWAC owns two bauxite mines and three refineries (to extract aluminium oxide from bauxite) in Western Australia and owns a smelter (to extract pure aluminium) and has a 55% interest in the Portland aluminium smelter. AWAC also operates and has interests in Brazil, Guinea, Saudi Arabia and Spain.

In 2016, Alumina Limited achieved great short term authority over its interest in AWAC with more influence over a broader suite of operational and investment decisions.

Having been cross-listed on both the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) and New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Alumina delisted from the NYSE in February 2014, consolidating on the ASX.

In February 2024, Alcoa announced it would acquire Alumina for $2.2 billion in an all-stock deal. As part of the deal Alcoa would gain full ownership of AWAC. The acquisition was completed in August.

<text>Yuri Timofeyevich Galanskov (; 19 June 1939 – 4 November 1972) was a Russian poet, historian, human rights activist and dissident. For his political activities, such as founding and editing samizdat almanac &quot;Phoenix&quot;, he was incarcerated in prisons, camps and forced treatment psychiatric hospitals &quot;(Psikhushkas)&quot;. He died in a labor camp.

== Early publications ==
Yuri Galanskov began his dissident activities in 1959, as a participant in the poetry readings in Mayakovsky Square.
Several of his works were published in the samizdat anthology &quot;Sintaksis&quot;. After Alexander Ginzburg was arrested in 1960 for publishing &quot;Sintaksis&quot;, Yuri Galanskov became the leader of dissident publishing in the Soviet Union. Galanskov’s first publication, &quot;Phoenix&quot; came in 1961, and contained direct criticism of the Soviet government, partly in the form of poetry. &quot;Phoenix&quot; published works by Boris Pasternak, Natalya Gorbanevskaya, Ivan Kharabarov, and Galanskov himself.

As a punishment for publishing &quot;Phoenix&quot;, the Soviet authorities convicted Galanskov and sentenced him to several months in a psychiatric hospital. Following his release, Galanskov formed a friendship with Alexander Ginzburg, and together the two publishers made arrangements to have their work published in the West.

Georgy Shchedrovitsky, who had taught Galanskov at school, signed a letter in support of Galanskov and Ginzburg during their show trial in February 1968.

== The Daniel-Sinyavsky Trial ==
During the years of Nikita Khrushchev’s leadership, frustrations had been mounting in the Kremlin over the difficulty of suppressing the Samizdat literary movement. In 1965, the Soviets arrested Yuli Daniel and Andrei Sinyavsky, two prominent samizdat writers. The trial was made a media spectacle, with &quot;Pravda&quot; issuing passionate condemnations of the defendants. The trial did not, however, discourage the underground literary movement. Instead, it provoked the first spontaneous political demonstration to occur in the Soviet Union in 30 years, which Galanskov helped organize. Yuri Galanskov and Alexander Ginzburg also compiled detailed notes of the trial and released their observations in a four-hundred page report known as &quot;The White Book&quot;. This work was widely circulated among the dissident writers and was eventually smuggled out to the West.

== Final Work ==
Shortly after the release of &quot;The White Book&quot;, Galanskov released the second edition of &quot;Phoenix&quot;, titled &quot;Phoenix &#x27;66&quot;. This issue featured works by Gorbanyevskaya, Yuri Stefanov, and Vladimir Batshev. It was generally regarded as being even more daring than the first issue. The KGB arrested him and four others in January 1967.

== Trial of the Four ==
In what came to be known as The Trial of the Four, the Soviet Union brought charges against Yuri Galanskov for publishing &quot;Phoenix&quot;. The prosecutors also charged Alexander Dobrovolsky with contributing to the magazine, Vera Lashkova with assisting the typing of the manuscript, and Alexander Ginzburg with collaborating with Galanskov on &quot;The White Book&quot;. Lashkova was sentenced to a year in prison. Dobrovolsky was sentenced to two years at hard labour, while Ginzburg received five years at hard labour. Galanskov was sentenced to seven years at a labor camp in Mordovia.

== Imprisonment and death ==
In 1968 Galanskov was sentenced to 7 years in a labor camp and was sent to a facility next to Ozyorny in the Republic of Mordovia. During his years in prison, Galanskov advocated the rights of prisoners. In collaboration with Ginzburg, he wrote a letter describing the poor conditions and cruel guards of the labor camp. The letter was smuggled out of Russia and published in the West.

According to accounts that reached the West at that time, Galanskov who suffered from bleeding ulcers, was not allowed to receive medical care after his imprisonment, and was fed prison fare of salt fish and black bread. He died after being operated for a perforated ulcer by another inmate who had no qualification in surgery. After the operation camp administration refused to transfer him to a hospital or allow qualified doctors to visit him. Prior to his death Galanskov managed to sneak a letter home saying: &quot;They are doing everything to hasten my death.&quot;

<doc id="1331491" wikidata="Q16965499" url="?curid=1331491" title="Hypergammon">
<text>Hypergammon is a variant of backgammon.

== Rule variations ==
Each player begins with three pieces, rather than fifteen. At the start of the game, each player begins with one piece on each of the three most distant points of the board (the 22-point, the 23-point and the 24-point).

Hypergammon is often played using the Jacoby Rule, which is also used in backgammon money games. Under this rule, gammons and backgammons will not count extra until the cube has been doubled.

== Gameplay ==
As a consequence of the reduced number of pieces, many people believe that hypergammon relies more heavily on luck than backgammon. The difficulty of getting two pieces on the same point means that both players nearly always have blots on the board. The combination of the fact that bearing off can be completed with a single lucky roll of doubles, and that it is nearly impossible to protect blots from being sent to the bar, results in gammons being scored much more often than in backgammon. This also means the lead in a game can swing very quickly.

In fact, for most players, the skill-to-luck ratio (or, more precisely, the error-to-luck ratio) is much higher in hypergammon than in backgammon, which means that a skillful player can achieve a statistically significant lead much more quickly in hypergammon than in backgammon. The best moves in hypergammon (especially doubling decisions) are often subtle and less easily conceptualized than those of backgammon.

Hypergammon has been &#x27;solved&#x27;, in the sense that computers can now play perfect hypergammon. Nevertheless, it is still a very challenging game for human players. The development of heuristics for expert play is very much an open topic.

In the early 1990s Hugh Sconyers solved Hyper Backgammon using a computer. There are over 32,000,000 possible positions when you include the double cube. In addition, Sconyers solved 1, 2 and 4 checker backgammon, which have similar starting positions.

== Popularity ==
Coming out in 1991, Hypergammon was and is known to be part of an online computer application. It can be played in real life as a board game too, but even now, people competitively play the game and try what they can to keep their rank one title. Marc Olsen is known as a &#x27;grandmaster&#x27; Hypergammon player, and has written about strategies for playing the backgammon variant.

== Competition ==

Hypergammon has been included within the Mind Sports Olympiad program, for the first time in the in-person event in London 2023, after holding it in the online versions in 2020 and 2021 and the online Grand Prix.

<doc id="1331499" wikidata="Q166641" url="?curid=1331499" title="Alexander Ginzburg">
<text>Alexander &quot;Alik&quot; Ilyich Ginzburg (; 21 November 1936 – 19 July 2002), was a Russian journalist, poet, human rights activist and dissident. Between 1961 and 1969 he was sentenced three times to labor camps. In 1979, Ginzburg was released and expelled to the United States, along with four other political prisoners (Eduard Kuznetsov, Mark Dymshits, Valentin Moroz, and Georgy Vins) and their families, as part of a prisoner exchange.

==Biography==
Ginzburg was born in Moscow to a Russian-Jewish family. He was relative (nephew) of Yevgenia Ginzburg and semi-orphan, Alexander Ginzburg. Ginzburg was educated in Moscow, and worked as a lathe operator and part time journalist after leaving school, then as an actor, but had to give up acting in 1959, after falling from a third storey window.

=== Dissident work ===
At the end of 1959, Ginzburg issued the USSR&#x27;s first samizdat literary magazine &quot;Phoenix&quot;, with Yuri Galanskov. He also cofounded the poetry almanac &quot;Sintaksis&quot;. After three issues, he was expelled from Moscow University, arrested and sentenced to two years in a labour camp. Released in 1962, he was unable to find regular work, but continued to patronise underground art, by distributing literature and holding private film shows. He was returned to Lubyanka prison for a short time in 1964.

In December 1965, Alexander Ginzburg documented the trial of writers Yuli Daniel and Andrei Sinyavsky (Sinyavsky–Daniel trial). Having obtained a copy of closed-door court proceedings from the court stenographer, he compiled a &quot;White Book&quot; documenting the trial. He then sent copies of the book with his address to the KGB and the Chief Prosecutor&#x27;s Office. The book also circulated in samizdat and was smuggled to the West. In December 1966, he summoned before the KGB and ordered to repudiate the &quot;White Book&quot;, which he refused to do. He was arrested on 23 January 1967. His case was linked with Galanskov&#x27;s, though the only direct link between their activities was that they both relied on the same typist, Vera Lashkova. They were co-defendants at the Trial of the Four, at the conclusion of which, on 12 January 1968, Ginzburg was sentenced to five years of forced labour.

In a labour camp in Mordvinia, Ginzburg began a hunger strike in May 1969 because the authorities had prevented him from marrying his fiancee, Irena Zholkovskaya, who was consequently prevented from visiting him. In June, he was allowed to register his marriage, but she was then sacked from her job as a teacher. For this and other protests again conditions in the camps, he was transferred in summer 1970 to Vladimir Prison.

Ginzburg was released when his five year prison term ended, on 22 January 1972, and was allowed to settle in Tarusa, 50 miles south of Moscow. He was a friend of Alexander Solzhenitsyn, with whom he initiated the Fund for the Aid of Political Prisoners. Based on the royalties derived from Solzhenitsyn&#x27;s book &quot;The Gulag Archipelago&quot;, it distributed funds and material support to political and religious prisoners across the Soviet Union throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Ginzburg had power of attorney over the fund after Solzhenitsyn&#x27;s expulsion from the USSR in February 1974, but in April, he was placed under police surveillance and forbidden to leave the district of Talusa where he lived, even to walk as far as the local cinema, and was forbidden to leave the house after 8.00pm.
In 1976, Ginzburg became a founding member of the Moscow Helsinki Group, which monitored breaches of the human rights guarantees the Soviet government signed up to in the 1975 Helsinki accords. Ginzburg was given the task of monitoring the State&#x27;s persecution of the smaller Christian denominations, for which he was, again, arrested in 1978 and sentenced to an eight-year prison term. In April 1979, he was with four other dissidents deprived of his citizenship and exchanged for two Soviets who had been jailed for espionage.

Throughout his career, Ginzburg advocated nonviolent resistance. He believed in exposing human rights abuses by the Soviet Union and pressuring the government to follow its own laws. He made an effort to smuggle his writings abroad in order to increase external pressure on the Soviets.

<text>The Gestetner is a type of duplicating machine named after its inventor, David Gestetner (1854–1939). During the 20th century, the term &quot;Gestetner&quot; was used as a verb—as in &quot;Gestetnering&quot;. The Gestetner company established its base in London, filing its first patent in 1879. The business grew, remaining within the control of the Gestetner family, and acquiring other businesses. In 1995, the Gestetner company was acquired by the Ricoh Corporation of Japan.

== History ==
David Gestetner was born in Hungary in 1854, and after working in Vienna and New York, he moved to London, England, filing his first copying patent there in 1879. A later patent in 1881 was for the Cyclostyle, a stylus that was part of the Cyclograph copying device. That same year, he also established the Gestetner Cyclograph Company to produce duplicating machines, stencils, styli, ink rollers and related products. The Gestetner works opened in 1906 at Tottenham Hale, north London, and employed several thousand people until the 1990s. Gestetner&#x27;s inventions were successful, and branch offices sold and serviced Gestetner products in 153 different countries.

The Gestetner Company expanded quickly during the early and mid-20th century. Management was passed to David Gestetner&#x27;s son, Sigmund Gestetner, and from him to his sons, David and Jonathan. Gestetner acquired other companies during the years: Nashua (later changed to Nashuatec), Rex Rotary, Hanimex and Savin.

In 1995 the international Gestetner Company, and its brand, was acquired by the Ricoh company of Japan. The company was renamed NRG Group PLC, and markets and services Ricoh products under its three main brand names, primarily in Europe, South Africa and the Middle East, but also through dealers throughout the world. In Europe, Gestetner Group became NRG Group, which on 1 April 2007 became Ricoh Europe. On that date Ricoh merged its Gestetner dealer network with the Lanier dealer network that had been selling Lanier-branded products on behalf of Ricoh for the North American market. Ricoh indicated that the merger&#x27;s rationale was based on the fact that both &quot;Gestetner and Lanier brands have been marketing identical products for many years&quot;. Thus, Gestetner&#x27;s American customers can simply substitute Lanier-branded products for previous Gestetner-branded products even though Lanier-branded products are the same as Ricoh and Savin.

==The Gestetner Cyclograph==

The Gestetner Cyclograph was a stencil-method duplicator that used a thin sheet of paper coated with wax (originally kite paper was used), which was written upon with a special stylus that left a broken line through the stencil, removing the paper&#x27;s wax coating. Ink was forced through the stencil (originally by an ink roller), and it left its impression on a white sheet of paper.

Until this time, any &quot;short copy runs&quot; which were needed for the conduct of a business—e.g., for the production of 10–50 copies of contracts, agreements, or letters—had to be copied by hand. (If more were needed, the document would have to go to the printers.) After the run had been copied, business partners had to read each one to ensure that they were all exactly the same, and that human error had not resulted in any aberrant copies. The process was time-consuming and frustrating. The stencil-copy method meant that only one copy had to be read, as all copies were mechanically identical. Gestetner had therefore revolutionised the office copying process.

Gestetner developed his invention, with the stencil eventually being placed on a screen wrapped around a pair of revolving drums, onto which ink was placed. The drums were revolved and ink, spread evenly across the surface of the screen by a pair of cloth-covered rollers, was forced through the cuts made in the stencil and transferred onto a sheet of paper which was fed through the duplicator and pressed by pressure rollers against the lower drum. Each complete rotation of the screen fed and printed one sheet. Later models had a scanner, that scanned an original and burned holes through the &quot;master&quot; as it spun on a spinning drum. 

Model 66 was perhaps the most famous Gestetner machine, designed by Raymond Loewy; examples are currently housed in the British Museum and Churchill&#x27;s War Bunker in Whitehall.

After the first typewriter was invented, a stencil was created which could be typed on, thus creating copies similar to printed newspapers and books, instead of handwritten material.

<text>James Stephen Hogg (March 24, 1851March 3, 1906) was an American lawyer and statesman, and the 20th Governor of Texas. He was born near Rusk, Texas. Hogg was a follower of the conservative New South Creed which became popular following the U.S. Civil War, and was also associated with populism. He was the first Texas Governor to have been born in Texas. Jim Hogg County is named after him.

Hogg is often remembered for naming his daughter Ima, an odd name which derived from a poem written by James&#x27;s brother, Thomas Elisha Hogg. The story that she had a sister or sisters with odd names (proposed names including &quot;Hoosa&quot;, &quot;Ura&quot; and &quot;Wera&quot;) is an urban legend.

Hogg&#x27;s time as governor was notable for the passage of a wide range of progressive reforms.

==Early years==
Hogg was born in Cherokee County, Texas. His parents, Joseph L. Hogg and Lucanda McMath had moved to Texas in late 1836. During the Civil War, his father served as a brigadier general in the Confederate States Army. Joseph Hogg died in 1862, and Lucanda died the following year. Hogg and his two brothers were raised by their sister, Frances. The family had little money, and Hogg received only a basic education before being asked to go to work.

In 1866, Hogg went to Tuscaloosa, Alabama, to study. Upon returning to Texas, he became a printer&#x27;s devil at the &quot;Rusk Chronicle&quot;. In 1867, Hogg walked from East Texas to Cleburne, where he found a job with the &quot;Cleburne Chronicle&quot;. Soon after his arrival the building which housed the &quot;Cleburne Chronicle&quot; burned down, and Hogg returned to East Texas. For the next several years he worked as a farmhand and studied law. He later ran the &quot;Longview News&quot; and founded the &quot;Quitman News&quot;.

==Public service==
In 1873, Hogg was named Justice of the Peace at Quitman. The following year he married Sarah Ann Stinson. They had four children, William Clifford (1875), Ima (1882), Michael (1885), and Thomas Elijah (1887). Ima was named for the heroine of the poem &quot;The Fate of Marvin&quot;, written by Hogg&#x27;s older brother Tom in 1873. Although legend states that the Hoggs also had a daughter named Ura, that allegation is false.

In 1876, he was defeated by John S. Griffith for a seat in the Texas legislature. He returned to public service in 1878 when he was elected Wood County&#x27;s attorney, and he went on to serve from 1880 to 1884 as Texas&#x27; seventh district&#x27;s attorney.

Hogg was one of the men responsible for making Smith County a Democratic stronghold during the 1884 national elections, as he helped convince the black vote for the Democratic party. Although encouraged to run for a seat in the United States Congress, Hogg declined and practiced law in Tyler.

==Attorney general==
Hogg was elected state Attorney General in 1886 with the platform of railroad regulation reform. At that time, the state had the power to regulate the transportation industry, but existing laws were either unenforced or inadequate. Through &quot;various legal maneuvers&quot;, Hogg forced the out-of-state corporations operating the railroads to establish operating offices in the state. He also put an end to pooling by the railroads and suggested that the legislature propose a constitutional amendment to create the Railroad Commission of Texas. In 1888 Hogg sued the rail companies for attempting to create a monopoly, among other charges. Hogg won, defeating the powerful rail baron Jay Gould and creating for himself a name in Texas politics.

Hogg also endeavored to rein in abuses by other large corporations. He tackled the &quot;wildcat&quot; insurance companies, forcing several of them to leave the state and requiring others to operate within the parameters of the law. Under his guidance, Texas became the second state to pass a workable antitrust law.

==Governor==
With the support of farmers, ranchers, and small merchants, Hogg won the election for Governor of Texas in 1890. At the same time, voters approved the constitutional amendment allowing for a Railroad Commission by a wide margin. On April 3, 1891, the legislature overwhelmingly passed a bill to create the Railroad Commission. Hogg appointed Lafayette L. Foster and William Pinckney McLean as commissioners, with John H. Reagan, creator of the Interstate Commerce Act, as chairman. Hogg also named his old friend, Captain Bill McDonald, to succeed Samuel A. McMurry as the captain of Texas Rangers Company B, Frontier Battalion, a position that he retained until 1907.

Hogg campaigned for a second term in 1892 on five principles: to uphold the state constitution, to support the Railroad Commission, to stop the railroads from issuing watered stocks, to regulate the issuance of county and municipal bonds, and to regulate alien land ownership. When his opponent for the Democratic nomination, George Clark, realized that Hogg would likely win the nomination, Clark&#x27;s supporters left the Democratic convention and went to a new location. There they formed a new party, the Jeffersonian Democrats, and nominated Clark for governor. Hogg was easily nominated as the Democratic candidate by the remaining delegates.

The Republican Party endorsed Clark, and the Populist Party nominated lawyer Thomas Lewis Nugent. Hogg won a plurality of the votes to gain a second term as governor, but it was the first time in state history that the winning Democratic candidate did not receive a majority of the votes.

During his second term, Hogg endorsed three constitutional amendments. Voters defeated the proposals to charter state banks and to provide a pension for indigent Confederate veterans, but approved the amendment to allow for public election of the railroad commissioners. At his urging, the legislature passed a law allowing the Railroad Commission to fix rates based on fair valuation and to stop many of the practices the railroad companies had used to manipulate stocks. When the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the commission in &quot;Reagan v. Farmers Loan and Trust&quot; in 1894, this law helped them to be fully equipped to fight the power of the railroads.

In April 1893, the legislature passed a law requiring that communities which issued bonds should also have a plan to collect sufficient taxes to pay the interest. Hogg&#x27;s final campaign promise was fulfilled when the legislature passed the Perpetuities and Corporation Land Law, which required private corporations to sell all land they had held for speculative purposes within 15 years The law was full of loopholes and did not have the effect that Hogg wanted.

In 1894, Texas filed a lawsuit against John D. Rockefeller&#x27;s Standard Oil Company and its Texas subsidiary, the Waters-Pierce Oil Company of Missouri. Hogg and his attorney general argued that the companies were engaged in rebates, price fixing, consolidation, and other tactics prohibited by the state&#x27;s 1889 antitrust act. The investigation resulted in a number of indictments, including one for Rockefeller. Hogg requested that Rockefeller be extradited from New York, but the New York governor refused, as Rockefeller had not fled from Texas. Rockefeller was never tried, but other employees of the company were found guilty.

In a &quot;National Geographic&quot; article in 1961, Stanley Walker wrote that Hogg was &quot;remembered as a man of uncommon ability&quot; and was one of Texas&#x27; greatest governors.

==Later years==
Hogg&#x27;s term as governor ended in 1895, the same year his wife died. Although he was not wealthy when he left office, through his connections he became involved in land and oil deals and amassed a large fortune.

He spoke on behalf of William Jennings Bryan in Tammany Hall in 1896 and 1900. Hogg also became interested in the idea of what became the Panama Canal; having done well as an oil investor, Hogg had interest for a shipping route to open between Texas and South America, as well as between Texas and Asia. On April 19, 1900, he gave a speech in Waco, where he said the now legendary words: &quot;Let us have Texas, the Empire State, (be) governed by the people, not Texas, the truckpatch, ruled by corporate lobbyists&quot;.

In 1901, Hogg founded the Texas Company, predecessor to Texaco, with Joseph S. Cullinan, John Warne Gates, and Arnold Schlaet.

Jim Hogg&#x27;s popularity extended beyond Texas, particularly in New York. The &quot;Man in the Street&quot; column in the edition of September 6, 1903, of &quot;The New York Times&quot; related the following anecdote regarding him:

In January 1905, Hogg was injured in a railroad accident while on a business trip. He never completely recovered and died in his sleep on March 3, 1906, at the age of 54. He is buried in Oakwood Cemetery in Austin, Texas.

Jim Hogg County southeast of Laredo is named after him.

In addition James S. Hogg Middle School in Norhill, Houston, of the Houston Independent School District, is named after him.

==Burial==
In 1906, Texas Governor James Stephen Hogg asked that a pecan tree be planted at his grave instead of a traditional headstone, requesting that the seeds be distributed throughout the state to make Texas a &quot;Land of Trees&quot;. His wish was carried out and this brought more attention to pecan trees. In 1919, the 36th Texas Legislature made the pecan tree the state tree of Texas where the town of San Saba claims to be &quot;The Pecan Capital of the World&quot;. Several other American towns and regions host annual events celebrating the pecan harvest.

==Removal of statue==

In the early morning of August 22, 2017, the University of Texas at Austin removed three Confederate monuments and a statue of Hogg. The university president said the removal was because of the violent protests at the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. In December 2018, the statue was reinstalled on the east side of the university&#x27;s Main building.

<text>The term &quot;secular saint&quot; has no strict definition, but generally refers to someone venerated and respected for contributions to a noble cause, but not recognized as a canonical saint by any particular religion. The ranks of secular saints, like those of religious ones, are often filled by martyrs.

== Revered historical figures ==
George Orwell began his &quot;Reflections on Gandhi&quot;: &quot;Saints should always be judged guilty until they are proved innocent…&quot; Orwell concluded his essay with an attack on the idea of sainthood but praise for Gandhi:One may feel, as I do, a sort of aesthetic distaste for Gandhi, one may reject the claims of sainthood made on his behalf (he never made any such claim himself, by the way), one may also reject sainthood as an ideal and therefore feel that Gandhi&#x27;s basic aims were anti-human and reactionary: but regarded simply as a politician, and compared with the other leading political figures of our time, how clean a smell he has managed to leave behind! 

The term &quot;secular saint&quot; has also been used with reference to the incel community, which has been observed referring to mass-killer Elliot Rodger as &quot;Saint Elliot&quot; within the online spaces and discourses of the community and celebrating the anniversary of the 2014 Isla Vista killings as &quot;Saint Elliot Day&quot;. Some academics, such as Taisto Witt, have suggested that, while the incel community is apparently nonreligious, their treatment of Rodger suggests that he has been appointed to a position that functionally operates as that of a saint within the community.

Thelema, a philosophical movement, has generated a list of saints including individuals such as Roger Bacon.

<doc id="1331526" wikidata="Q416740" url="?curid=1331526" title="Enflurane">
<text>Enflurane (2-chloro-1,1,2-trifluoroethyl difluoromethyl ether) is a halogenated ether. Developed by Ross Terrell in 1963, it was first used clinically in 1966. It was increasingly used for inhalational anesthesia during the 1970s and 1980s but is no longer in common use.

Enflurane is a structural isomer of isoflurane. It vaporizes readily, but is a liquid at room temperature.

==Physical properties==
==Pharmacology==
The exact mechanism of the action of general anaesthetics has not been delineated. Enflurane acts as a positive allosteric modulator of the GABAA, glycine, and 5-HT3 receptors, and as a negative allosteric modulator of the AMPA, kainate, and NMDA receptors, as well as of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.

==Side effects==
Clinically, enflurane produces a dose-related depression of myocardial contractility with an associated decrease in myocardial oxygen consumption. Between 2% and 5% of the inhaled dose is oxidised in the liver, producing fluoride ions and difluoromethoxy-difluoroacetic acid. This is significantly higher than the metabolism of its structural isomer isoflurane.

Enflurane also lowers the threshold for seizures, and should especially not be used on people with epilepsy. Like all potent inhalation anaesthetic agents it is a known trigger of malignant hyperthermia.

Like the other potent inhalation agents it relaxes the uterus in pregnant women which is associated with more blood loss at delivery or other procedures on the gravid uterus.

The obsolete (as an anaesthetic) agent methoxyflurane had a nephrotoxic effect and caused acute kidney injury, usually attributed to the liberation of fluoride ions from its metabolism. Enflurane is similarly metabolised but the liberation of fluoride results in a lower plasma level and enflurane related kidney failure seemed unusual if seen at all.

== Occupational safety ==
The U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) for exposure to waste anaesthetic gas of 2 ppm (15.1 mg/m3) over a 60-minute period. Symptoms of occupational exposure to enflurane include eye irritation, central nervous system depression, analgesia, anesthesia, convulsions, and respiratory depression.

<text>Tan Chong Tee (; 15 October 1916 – 24 November 2012) was a Chinese resistance fighter based in Singapore and Malaya during World War II. An accomplished badminton player before the war, he joined Force 136 around 1942 after Singapore fell to the Japanese. In 1944, while on a mission, Tan, along with Lim Bo Seng and other Force 136 members, was captured by the Japanese. He was subjected to torture during his captivity. After the war, he returned to playing badminton and later became a businessman.

==Early life==
Tan was born in an ethnic Chinese family with ancestry from Fujian Province at his family residence along Shrewsbury Road in present-day Novena, Singapore. His father, Tan Kah Tek, worked in a carriage shop on Orchard Road while his mother, Lim Peng Tuan, owned a floral nursery. Tan left Singapore to further his studies in China in 1930 and returned home in 1933. He helped his mother run Kheng Cheng School, which she established in 1927.

==As a badminton player==
Tan was a talented badminton player in his youth and represented the Marigold and Mayflower Badminton Parties at various tournaments in Singapore. At just 17 years old, he made his senior debut in the 1934 Singapore Open and exceeded expectation by reaching the quarter-finals of the men&#x27;s singles event. His exceptional performance during the tournament, characterised by his impressive speed and powerful gameplay, propelled him to prominence in the local badminton circuit.

In 1935, Tan was selected to represent Singapore at the All-Malayan Chinese Olympiad interstate badminton tournament. Despite his best efforts, Singapore fell short in the semi-finals with a narrow defeat against the Penang team. At his second Singapore Open, Tan continued to make a strong impression by advancing to the semi-finals of both the men&#x27;s singles and doubles events. Later that year, he achieved his first senior success in the inter-club championship, where he won all his matches to help Mayflower to emerge as the inter-club champion. 

From 1936 onwards, Tan established himself as a dominant force in the regional badminton scene, achieving remarkable success in various tournaments. At the 1936 Singapore Open, he secured his first men&#x27;s singles title by defeating the reigning champion, Leow Kim Fatt, who had earlier emerged victorious in an exhibition match against former All-England champion Frank Devlin. In addition to his singles triumph, he also teamed up with his clubmate, Seah Eng Hee, to clinch the men&#x27;s doubles title. The following year, Tan repeated the same feat once again by winning both the men&#x27;s singles and doubles titles at the 1937 Singapore Open. His back-to-back victories in both disciplines made him the first player in the history of the tournament to claim consecutive titles in both events.

Tan&#x27;s achievements were not limited to Singapore alone. At the 1937 All-Malayan Chinese Olympiad interstate badminton tournament, he played a pivotal role in leading Singapore to achieve its first success since the tournament inception in 1933, by beating their fierce rivals from Penang in a thrilling final. In 1938, Tan claimed the men&#x27;s singles title at the Malaysia Open, having made the quarter-finals the year before. He made another final in 1939 but unfortunately, he was unable to secure the victory and ended up as the runner-up. In 1940, Tan regained his best form to win his third Singapore Open men&#x27;s singles crown and paired up with Lee Shao Meng, another Marigold player, to secure the mixed doubles title after falling short in the previous year. He also reached yet another semi-finals at the Malaysia Open, his third in a row, which solidifying his status as one of the best player in the region.

He was a contemporary of Wong Peng Soon and achieved the remarkable feat of defeating Wong in competitions, making him one of the few players to have achieved such a distinction.

==Career in Force 136==

When the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out in 1937, Tan participated in anti-Japanese activities such as boycotting Japanese goods and fund-raising to support the war effort in China. On 31 January 1941, he embarked on a journey to Chongqing, China, with the intention of joining the Chinese armed forces in their fight against the Japanese invaders. However, Tan was denied entry into the army due to his young age and was advised to stay in Chongqing to pursue his studies instead. He later enrolled at the University of Hunan to study fine arts.

Tan lost touch with his family in 1942 after the Japanese invaded and occupied Singapore. After facing disappointment in his attempt to join the Chinese Air Forces due to exceeding the age limit, he took an alternative approach by organising an art exhibition to raise funds for overseas Chinese refugees. It was during this exhibition that he caught the attention of the Kuomintang government of China, and was recruited to contribute to the resistance effort in Malaya. He then went to India for training and joined Force 136, a branch of the Allied Special Operations Executive, where he met and befriended Lim Bo Seng. 

Tan participated in Operation Gustavus, a mission aimed at establishing an espionage network in Malaya and Singapore to gather intelligence about Japanese activities, and thereby aid the British in Operation Zipper – the code name for their plan to take back Singapore from the Japanese. The team embarked on a journey from Colombo, Sri Lanka, to Malaya, utilising a submarine as their means of transportation. By 2 August 1943, the submarine had successfully reached Malayan waters near Pangkor Island, located off the coast of Perak. The team executed a covert landing at Tanjong Hantu and subsequently rendezvoused with a contingent of guerrillas affiliated with the Malayan Peoples&#x27; Anti-Japanese Army (MPAJA).

Tan was subsequently assigned to undertake infiltration and intelligence tasks, adopting the persona of Tan Tien Soong or Lim Shu, a wealthy businessman. This guise provided him with the necessary cover to establish and manage spy networks in the regions of Lumut and Ipoh. Leveraging his background in art, Tan utilised his sketching skills to visually capture crucial information for the group&#x27;s espionage operations. He was captured in 1944 by the Japanese when the operation failed. He spent the next 18 months in captivity, during which he was tortured by the Japanese, who attempted to force him to reveal the identities of other Force 136 members but he refused. He was released after the Japanese surrender in 1945. 

Upon returning to Singapore, Tan found out that his brother, Chong Mao, had been executed by the Japanese in the Sook Ching massacre and that his mother had been beaten up by the Japanese when she tried to sought information about her missing son. Her injuries left her bedridden and she died in December of the same year.

==Postwar life==
After the war, Tan participated in badminton tournaments again and continued to excel, reaching two more men&#x27;s doubles finals with partners Ong Poh Lim and Kon Kong Min in the 1948 and 1952 Singapore Open respectively. In 1952, he finished as runner-up in the Foong Seong Cup, a notable interstate badminton tournament in Malaya, while representing Singapore. Adding to his accomplishments, Tan also secured another inter-club championship that year, this time as the member of the Marigold Badminton Party. Transitioning from competitive play, Tan dedicated himself to coaching the sport of badminton for the Singapore Badminton Association (SBA), where he mentored and trained the next generation of players. In 1959, he won the veteran men&#x27;s doubles title with Ismail Marjan.

In addition to his pursuits in badminton, Tan also ventured into property development and advertising where he established himself as a successful businessman. After many years of hard work and dedication, he eventually retired from his business endeavors in 1985. In 1994, he wrote a Chinese-language memoir, &quot;FORCE 136: Story Of A WWII Resistance Fighter&quot; (), which recounts his experiences with Force 136. The memoir was translated into English a year later by Lee Watt Sim and Clara Show, and published in 2001 by Asiapac Books as a comic book. In 2001, Tan was part of a group selected to recite the National Pledge during the National Day Parade. In 2002, Tan published another book named &quot;Upholding The Legacy: Singapore Badminton&quot; (), which covers the history of badminton in Singapore.

==Personal life==
In 1946, Tan married Lee Shao Meng, his teammate at Marigold Badminton Party, who he teamed up for various mixed doubles events. They had a daughter together.

==Death==
Tan died in Singapore on 24 November 2012 at the age of 96. He was cremated at the Mandai Crematorium.

==Honours and awards==
On 3 October 1945, Tan was conferred the rank of Liaison Officer by Colonel John Davies, the commanding officer of Force 136 and invited to partake in negotiations regarding demobilisation. Following the demobilisation process, he was honored with a Force 136 service medal, a Burmese medal award certificate, a demobilisation certificate, and a certificate of service bestowed by the Order of the British Empire.

In 1947, Tan, along with 145 other Singaporeans, were each awarded with a certificate of commendation by the Governor of Singapore, Sir Franklin Gimson for their services to the community during the Malayan campaign, during the Japanese occupation and in the B.M.A period after the liberation.

On 19 September 1995, Tan and eight other surviving members of Force 136 were each presented with a commemorative silver ingot to honour them for their resistance efforts.

<text>Viktor Aleksandrovich Nekipelov (, 29 September 1928 – 1 July 1989) was a Soviet Russian poet, writer, Soviet dissident, and a member of the Moscow Helsinki Group. He spent about nine years in prison for his participation in the Moscow Helsinki Group.

== Early life ==
Nekipelov was born to a Soviet family of workers of the Chinese Eastern Railway. In 1937, he and his mother came to the Soviet Union. In 1939, his mother was arrested and died in imprisonment. He left a high school in Omsk. From 1947 to 1950, he studied at the Omsk Army Medical School. In 1950, he left the Omsk Army Medical School with honours. In 1960, he graduated from the army medical faculty of the Kharkiv Medical Institute with honours as well. In 1969, he graduated from an extramural faculty of the Moscow Literature Institute. He worked as a pharmacist.
== Dissident ==
In 1973, he was arrested for &quot;spreading of known false fabrications that is damaging the Soviet political system&quot; (Article 190-1 of the RSFSR Criminal Code). According to Sakharov&#x27;s letter to Gorbachev of 19 February 1986, Nekipelov was convicted for his philosophical verses that were considered defamatory by a court. Nekipelov was sent to the Section 4 of the Serbsky Institute of Forensic Psychiatry for psychiatric evaluation, which lasted from 15 January to 12 March 1974, was judged sane (which he was), tried, and sentenced to two years&#x27; imprisonment. In 1976, he published in samizdat his book &quot;Institute of Fools: Notes on the Serbsky Institute&quot; based on his personal experience at Psychiatric Hospital of the Serbsky Institute and translated into English in 1980.

In October 1977, Nekipelov joined the Moscow Helsinki Group. In 1977, the joint book &quot;From Yellow Silence: The Collection of Memoirs and Articles by Political Prisoners of Psychiatric Hospitals&quot; by Nekipelov and Alexander Podrabinek was completed.

After publishing &quot;Institute of Fools&quot;, he was sentenced to the maximum punishment for &quot;anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda&quot; of seven years in a labour camp and then five years in internal exile. As Zavoisky and Krylovsky wrote, Nekipelov developed cancer caused by his permanent poisoning in a prison camp. On 20 March 1983, Nekipelov and 9 other political prisoners in their letter to US President of Ronald Reagan sought his aid in urging inspection of Soviet camps.

Along with Arina Ginzburg, Malva Landa, Tatyana Velikanova and Andrei Sakharov he demanded a referendum in the Baltic republics to determine their political destiny.

Released in 1987, he emigrated to France where he died in 1989.

In 1992, the selection of his verses was published by Memorial society.

== On his book ==
In his book &quot;Institute of Fools&quot;, he wrote compassionately, engagingly, and observantly of the doctors and other patients; most of the latter were ordinary criminals feigning insanity in order to be sent to a mental hospital, because hospital was a &quot;cushy number&quot; as against prison camps. According to the President of the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia Yuri Savenko, Nekipelov&#x27;s book is a highly dramatic humane document, a fair story about the nest of Soviet punitive psychiatry, a mirror that psychiatrists always need to look into. However, according to Malcolm Lader, this book as an indictment of the Serbsky Institute hardly rises above tittle-tattle and gossip, and Nekipelov destroys his own credibility by presenting no real evidence but invariably putting the most sinister connotation on events.

After reading the book, Donetsk psychiatrist Pekhterev concluded that allegations against the psychiatrists sounded from the lips of a negligible but vociferous part of inmates who when surfeiting themselves with cakes pretended to be sufferers. According to the response by Robert van Voren, Pekhterev in his article condescendingly argues that the Serbsky Institute was not so bad place and that Nekipelov exaggerates and slanders it, but Pekhterev, by doing so, misses the main point: living conditions in the Serbsky Institute were not bad, those who passed through psychiatric examination there were in a certain sense &quot;on holiday&quot; in comparison with the living conditions of the Gulag; and all the same, everyone was aware that the Serbsky Institute was more than the &quot;gates of hell&quot; from where people were sent to specialized psychiatric hospitals in Chernyakhovsk, Dnepropetrovsk, Kazan, Blagoveshchensk, and that is not all. Their life was transformed to unimaginable horror with daily tortures by forced administration of drugs, beatings and other forms of punishment. Many went crazy, could not endure what was happening to them, some even died during the &quot;treatment&quot; (for example, a miner from Donetsk Alexey Nikitin). Many books and memoirs are written about the life in the psychiatric Gulag and every time when reading them a shiver seizes us.

<doc id="1331535" wikidata="Q907340" url="?curid=1331535" title="MS Bremen">
<text>MS &quot;Seaventure, formerly Bremen&quot;, is a cruise ship operated by Hapag-Lloyd Cruises GmbH since 1993. She was built as &quot;Frontier Spirit&quot; at the Mitsubishi Shipyard, Kobe, Japan, in 1990. 
During a storm in the Southern Atlantic in March 2001, a rogue wave caused heavy damage, even breaking a window on the bridge. It left the ship adrift for two hours without propulsion. A previously uncharted island in the Antarctic was discovered by &quot;Bremen&quot; in 2003, and was named Bremen Island in 2004. &quot;Bremen&quot; was also featured in the TV show &quot;Killer Waves&quot;.

In 2006 she successfully ran the Northwest Passage, helped by satellite images telling where sea ice was.

In July 2018, a crew member shot and killed a polar bear in the Svalbard archipelago. The company claimed that the incident could not have been avoided and was an act of self-defense.

In January 2019 the ship was sold to Scylla AG with a planned handover date of May 2021. In July 2020, Hapag Lloyd Cruises announced that &quot;Bremen&quot; had been chartered to Havila Kystruten. She was renamed &quot;Seaventure&quot; in 2020. In 2024, the sale of the ship was announced.

<doc id="1331550" wikidata="Q271404" url="?curid=1331550" title="Kolwezi">
<text>Kolwezi or Kolwesi is the capital city of Lualaba Province in the south of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, west of Likasi. It has an airport and a railway to Lubumbashi. Just outside of Kolwezi there is the static inverter plant of the HVDC Inga-Shaba. The population is approximately 573,000.

Before the creation of Lualaba province in 2015 Kolwezi had two territories attached to it and the whole was known as the Kolwezi District.

==History==
The settlement was created in 1938 to be the headquarters for the western mining group of the &quot;Union Minière du Haut Katanga&quot;. In 1971 it obtained city status and consisted of the communes of Dilala and Manika. In 1976 the territories of Lubudi and Mutshatsha, both previously part of Lualaba District, were attached to it to form the Kolwezi District (districts were called sub-regions at the time). In the 2015 repartitioning this was undone, the two territories and the city proper became separate parts of Lualaba province with the city as capital of the new province.

===Battle of Kolwezi (1978)===

On Saturday, 13 May 1978, ex-Katangese soldiers supported by Angola occupied the city. The government of Zaire asked Belgium, France, Morocco and the United States to restore order. The 2e REP, an elite paratroopers unit of the French Foreign Legion, were sent in to drive out the rebels and rescue any hostages. The Belgian army also deployed a force of some 750 Paracommando Regiment paratroopers and moved out just over 1,800 Europeans to other cities in the region. 700 Africans, including 250 rebels, 170 European hostages and 6 paratroopers died.

==Orientation==
Kolwezi is set on an arid plain in the south of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Upon its establishment in 1937 by the Union Minière du Haut-Katangahe, the company cleared the land of the acacias and miombo trees that once grew atop Kolwezi’s rich mineral deposits. They subsequently built a simple low-rise town across the area’s rolling hills, with wide streets and bungalows for Europeans, whose neighborhoods were segregated from the poorly built ones where Congolese workers lived. 

The N39 highway runs through the center of town on a northwest-southeast axis. Large open pit cobalt mines are located to the west and north of the city center. Rond Point de L&#x27;Indépendance is the traditional center of the city with more formally laid out neighborhoods located to the west of the traffic circle. The center of the city contains administrative offices, dozens of guesthouses and hotels, banks and restaurants. Mutoshi Technical Institute is located on the eastern edge of the city. Kolwezi has several medical clinics and hospitals along with dozens of primary and secondary schools. 

===Dilala===
Dilala Is an upscale neighborhood located in the center of Kolwezi. The area is home to several foreign workers and a number of guest houses. Manika Stadium is located in the Dilala neighborhood. Kolwezi&#x27;s Central Train Station is located on the eastern edge of the neighborhood with train service to Likasi and Lubumbashi.

==Economy==

Kolwezi is an important mining centre for copper and cobalt. There are also uranium, radium, oxide ores, and lime deposits.
The Musonoi mine is a set of open-cut pits near Kolwezi from which copper and other metals have been extracted since the 1940s.
The nearby Lake Nzilo was created by damming the Lualaba River to provide a source of hydroelectric power and a reservoir of water for the mining activities. Kolwezi and its cobalt mining economy was profiled in the May 24, 2021 edition of The New Yorker by writer Nicolas Niarchos. The acute financial and environmental impacts on the city and its economy were highlighted in the article. The rapid growth of the cobalt mining industry has caused a recent surge in the city&#x27;s population.

== Climate ==
Kolwezi has a monsoon-influenced humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cwa&quot;). The city has a dry-winter humid subtropical climate (Cwa, according to the Köppen climate classification), with warm rainy summers and pleasant, dry winters, with most rainfall occurring during summer and early autumn. Annual average rainfall is 45.8 inches.


==Transportation==

===Road===
The city is crossed by Transafrican Highway 9 (TAH 9), which connects it to the cities of Lubumbashi and Dilolo.

===Rail===
The city of Kolwezi has one of the main railway stations in Congo, from where mineral loads and passengers board every day. The station receives trains from the Benguela railway.

===Air===
The Kolwezi Airport serves Kolwezi and the surrounding area. The airport is located about south of Kolwezi.

<doc id="1331554" wikidata="Q907924" url="?curid=1331554" title="Plains Indians">
<text>Plains Indians or Indigenous peoples of the Great Plains and Canadian Prairies are the Native American tribes and First Nations peoples who have historically lived on the Interior Plains (the Great Plains and Canadian Prairies) of North America. While hunting-farming cultures have lived on the Great Plains for centuries prior to European contact, the region is known for the horse cultures that flourished from the 17th century through the late 19th century. Their historic nomadism and armed resistance to domination by the government and military forces of Canada and the United States have made the Plains Indian culture groups an archetype in literature and art for Native Americans everywhere.

The Plains tribes are usually divided into two broad classifications which overlap to some degree. The first group became a fully nomadic horse culture during the 18th and 19th centuries, following the vast herds of American bison, although some tribes occasionally engaged in agriculture. These include the Arapaho, Assiniboine, Blackfoot, Cheyenne, Comanche, Crow, Gros Ventre, Kiowa, Lakota, Lipan, Plains Apache (or Kiowa Apache), Plains Cree, Plains Ojibwe, Sarsi, Nakoda (Stoney), and Tonkawa. The second group were sedentary and semi-sedentary, and, in addition to hunting bison, they lived in villages, raised crops, and actively traded with other tribes. These include the Arikara, Hidatsa, Iowa, Kaw (or Kansa), Kitsai, Mandan, Missouria, Omaha, Osage, Otoe, Pawnee, Ponca, Quapaw, Wichita, and the Santee Dakota, Yanktonai and Yankton Dakota.

==History==
The earliest people of the Great Plains mixed hunting and gathering wild plants. The cultures developed horticulture, then agriculture, as they settled in sedentary villages and towns. Maize, originally from Mesoamerica and spread north from the Southwest, became widespread in the south of the Great Plains around 700 CE.
Numerous Plains peoples hunted the American bison (or buffalo) to make items used in everyday life, such as food, cups, decorations, crafting tools, knives, and clothing. The tribes followed the seasonal grazing and migration of the bison. The Plains Indians lived in tipis because they were easily disassembled and allowed the nomadic life of following game.

The Spanish explorer Francisco Vásquez de Coronado was the first European to describe the Plains Indian culture. He encountered villages and cities of the Plains village cultures. While searching for a reputedly wealthy land called Quivira in 1541, Coronado came across the Querechos in the Texas panhandle. The Querechos were the people later called Apache. According to the Spaniards, the Querechos lived &quot;in tents made of the tanned skins of the cows (bison). They dry the flesh in the sun, cutting it thin like a leaf, and when dry they grind it like meal to keep it and make a sort of sea soup of it to eat. ... They season it with fat, which they always try to secure when they kill a cow. They empty a large gut and fill it with blood, and carry this around the neck to drink when they are thirsty.&quot; Coronado described many common features of Plains Indians culture: skin tepees, travois pulled by dogs, Plains Indian Sign Language, and staple foods such as jerky and pemmican.

Siouan language speakers may have originated in the lower Mississippi River region. They were agriculturalists and may have been part of the Mound Builder civilization during the 9th–12th centuries. Wars with the Ojibwe and Cree peoples pushed the Lakota (Teton Sioux) west onto the Great Plains in the mid- to late 17th century. The Shoshone originated in the western Great Basin and spread north and east into present-day Idaho and Wyoming. By 1500, some Eastern Shoshone had crossed the Rocky Mountains into the Great Plains. After 1750, warfare and pressure from the Blackfoot, Crow, Lakota, Cheyenne, and Arapaho pushed Eastern Shoshone south and westward. Some of them migrated as far south as Texas, emerging as the Comanche by 1700. 

European explorers and hunters (and later, settlers) brought diseases against which the Indians had no resistance. Between a half and two-thirds of the Plains Indians are thought to have died of smallpox by the time of the Louisiana Purchase. The 1837 Great Plains smallpox epidemic spread across the Great Plains, killing many thousands between 1837 and 1840. In the end, it is estimated that two-thirds of the Blackfoot population died, along with half of the Assiniboines and Arikaras, a third of the Crows, and a quarter of the Pawnees.

===Horses===

The Plains Indians found by Coronado had not yet obtained horses; it was the introduction of the horse that revolutionized Plains culture. When horses were obtained, the Plains tribes rapidly integrated them into their daily lives. People in the southwest began to acquire horses in the 16th century by trading or stealing them from Spanish colonists in New Mexico. As horse culture moved northward, the Comanche were among the first to commit to a fully mounted nomadic lifestyle. This occurred by the 1730s, when they had acquired enough horses to put all their people on horseback.

The horse enabled the Plains Indians to gain their subsistence with relative ease from the seemingly limitless bison herds. Riders were able to travel faster and farther in search of bison herds and to transport more goods, thus making it possible to enjoy a richer material environment than their pedestrian ancestors. For the Plains peoples, the horse became an item of prestige as well as utility. They were extravagantly fond of their horses and the lifestyle they permitted.

The first Spanish conqueror to bring horses to the new world was Hernán Cortés in 1519. However, Cortés only brought about sixteen horses with his expedition. Coronado brought 558 horses with him on his 1539–1542 expedition. At the time, the Indians of these regions had never seen a horse. Only two of Coronado&#x27;s horses were mares, so he was highly unlikely to have been the source of the horses that Plains Indians later adopted as the cornerstone of their culture. In 1592, however, Juan de Oñate brought 7,000 head of livestock with him when he came north to establish a colony in New Mexico. His horse herd included mares as well as stallions.

Pueblo Indians learned about horses by working for Spanish colonists. The Spanish attempted to keep knowledge of riding away from Native people, but nonetheless, they learned and some fled their servitude to their Spanish employers—and took horses with them. Some horses were obtained through trade in spite of prohibitions against it. Other horses escaped captivity for a feral existence and were captured by Native people. In all cases, the horse was adopted into their culture and herds multiplied. By 1659, the Navajo from northwestern New Mexico were raiding the Spanish colonies to steal horses. By 1664, the Apache were trading captives from other tribes to the Spanish for horses. The real beginning of the horse culture of the plains began with the Pueblo Revolt of 1680 in New Mexico and the capture of thousands of horses and other livestock. They traded many horses north to the Plains Indians. In 1683 a Spanish expedition into Texas found horses among Native people. In 1690, a few horses were found by the Spanish among the Indians living at the mouth of the Colorado River of Texas and the Caddo of eastern Texas had a sizeable number.

The French explorer Claude Charles Du Tisne found 300 horses among the Wichita on the Verdigris River in 1719, but they were still not plentiful. Another Frenchman, Bourgmont, could only buy seven at a high price from the Kaw in 1724, indicating that horses were still scarce among tribes in Kansas. While the distribution of horses proceeded slowly northward on the Great Plains, it moved more rapidly through the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin. The Shoshone in Wyoming had horses by about 1700 and the Blackfoot people, the most northerly of the large Plains tribes, acquired horses in the 1730s. By 1770, Plains horse culture was established, consisting of mounted bison-hunting nomads from Saskatchewan and Alberta southward nearly to the Rio Grande. Soon afterward, pressure from Europeans and Euro-Americans on all sides and European diseases caused its decline.

It was the Comanche, coming to the attention of the Spanish in New Mexico in 1706, who first realized the potential of the horse. As nomads, hunters, and pastoralists, well supplied with horses, they swept most of the mixed-economy Apaches from the plains and by the 1730s were dominant in the Great Plains south of the Arkansas River. The success of the Comanche encouraged other Indian tribes to adopt a similar lifestyle. The southern Plains Indians acquired vast numbers of horses. By the 19th century, Comanche and Kiowa families owned an average of 35 horses and mules each – and only six or seven were necessary for transport and war. The horses extracted a toll on the environment as well as required labor to care for the herd. Formerly egalitarian societies became more divided by wealth with a negative impact on the role of women. The richest men would have several wives and captives who would help manage their possessions, especially horses.

The milder winters of the southern Plains favored a pastoral economy by the Indians. On the northeastern Plains of Canada, the Indians were less favored, with families owning fewer horses, remaining more dependent upon dogs for transporting goods, and hunting bison on foot. The scarcity of horses in the north encouraged raiding and warfare in competition for the relatively small number of horses that survived the severe winters.

The Lakota, also called Teton Sioux, enjoyed the happy medium between North and South and became a dominant Plains tribe by the mid-19th century. They had relatively small horse herds, thus having less impact on their ecosystem. At the same time, they occupied the heart of prime bison range which was also an excellent region for furs, which could be sold to French and American traders for goods such as guns. The Lakota became a highly powerful Plains tribe.

===Slaughter of the bison===

By the 19th century, the typical year of the Lakota and other northern nomads was a communal buffalo hunt as early in spring as their horses had recovered from the rigors of the winter. In June and July the scattered bands of the tribes gathered together into large encampments, which included ceremonies such as the Sun Dance. These gatherings afforded leaders to meet to make political decisions, plan movements, arbitrate disputes, and organize and launch raiding expeditions or war parties. In the fall, people would split up into smaller bands to facilitate hunting to procure meat for the long winter. Between the fall hunt and the onset of winter was a time when Lakota warriors could undertake raiding and warfare. With the coming of winter snows, the Lakota settled into winter camps, where activities of the season ceremonies and dances as well as trying to ensure adequate winter feed for their horses. On the southern plains, with their milder winters, the fall and winter was often the raiding season. Beginning in the 1830s, the Comanche and their allies often raided for horses and other goods deep into Mexico, sometimes venturing 1,000 miles (1,600 km) south from their homes near the Red River in Texas and Oklahoma.

The U.S. federal government and local governments promoted bison hunting for various reasons: to allow ranchers to range their cattle without competition from other bovines and to starve and weaken the Plains Indian population to pressure them to remain on reservations. The bison herds formed the basis of the economies of the Plains tribes. Without bison, they were forced to move onto reservations or starve.

Bison were slaughtered for their skins, with the rest of the animal left behind to decay on the ground. After the animals rotted, their bones were collected and shipped back east in large quantities.
The railroad industry also wanted bison herds culled or eliminated. Herds of bison on tracks could damage locomotives when the trains failed to stop in time. Herds often took shelter in the artificial cuts formed by the grade of the track winding through hills and mountains in harsh winter conditions. As a result, bison herds could delay a train for days.

The slaughter of the bison had substantial adverse impacts on the Native American people who relied on them. These impacts were both immediate and persistent. By the early 20th century, bison nations had greater child mortality and unemployment compared to Indian nations that were never reliant on the bison. By the late 20th century, income per capita was 25% lower for bison nations. Whereas people in bison-hunting communities were once among the tallest people in the world, generations born after the slaughter of the bison had lost all their height advantage.

As the great herds began to wane, proposals to protect the bison were discussed. Buffalo Bill Cody, among others, spoke in favor of protecting the bison because he saw that the pressure on the species was too great. But these were discouraged since it was recognized that the Plains Indians, often at war with the United States, depended on bison for their way of life. In 1874, President Ulysses S. Grant &quot;pocket vetoed&quot; a federal bill to protect the dwindling bison herds. In 1875, General Philip Sheridan pleaded to a joint session of Congress to slaughter the herds, to deprive the Plains Indians of their source of food. This meant that the bison were hunted almost to extinction during the 19th century and were reduced to a few hundred by the early 1900s.

===Indian Wars===
Armed conflicts intensified in the late 19th century between Native American nations on the plains and the U.S. government, through what were called generally the Indian Wars. Notable conflicts in this period include the Dakota War, Great Sioux War, Snake War and Colorado War. Comanche power peaked in the 1840s when they conducted large-scale raids hundreds of miles into Mexico proper, while also warring against the Anglo-Americans and Tejanos who had settled in independent Texas. Expressing the frontier anti-Indian sentiment, Theodore Roosevelt believed the Indians were destined to vanish under the pressure of white civilization, stating in an 1886 lecture:

Among the most notable events during the wars was the Wounded Knee Massacre in 1890. In the years leading up to it the U.S. government had continued to seize Lakota lands. A Ghost Dance ritual on the Northern Lakota reservation at Wounded Knee, South Dakota, led to the U.S. Army&#x27;s attempt to subdue the Lakota. The dance was part of a religious movement founded by the Northern Paiute spiritual leader Wovoka that told of the return of the Messiah to relieve the suffering of Native Americans and promised that if they would live righteous lives and perform the Ghost Dance properly, the European American colonists would vanish, the bison would return, and the living and the dead would be reunited in an Edenic world. On December 29 at Wounded Knee, gunfire erupted, and U.S. soldiers killed up to 300 Indians, mostly old men, women, and children.

==Material culture==

===Agriculture and plant foods===
The semi-sedentary, village-dwelling Plains Indians depended upon agriculture for a large share of their livelihood, particularly those who lived in the eastern parts of the Great Plains which had more precipitation than the western side. Corn was the dominant crop, followed by squash and beans. Tobacco, sunflower, plums and other plants were also cultivated or gathered in the wild. Among the wild crops gathered the most important were probably berries to flavor pemmican and the Prairie Turnip.

The first indisputable evidence of maize cultivation on the Great Plains is about 900 AD. The earliest farmers, the Southern Plains villagers were probably Caddoan speakers, the ancestors of the Wichita, Pawnee, and Arikara of today. Plains farmers developed short-season and drought resistant varieties of food plants. They did not use irrigation but were adept at water harvesting and siting their fields to receive the maximum benefit of limited rainfall. The Hidatsa and Mandan of North Dakota cultivated maize at the northern limit of its range.

The farming tribes also hunted buffalo, deer, elk, and other game. Typically, on the southern Plains, they planted crops in the spring, left their permanent villages to hunt buffalo in the summer, returned to harvest crops in the fall, and left again to hunt bison in the winter. The farming Indians also traded corn to the nomadic tribes for dried buffalo meat.

With the arrival of the horse, some tribes, such as the Lakota and Cheyenne, gave up agriculture to become full-time, buffalo-hunting nomads.

By the 1870s bison herds were depleted and beef, cereal grains, fats and starchy vegetables became more important in the diet of Plains Indians. Fruits and nuts were, especially plums and grapes were dried as winter store. Flour was made from the Indian breadroot (&quot;Pediomelum esculentum&quot;). Indian tea (&quot;lespedeza&quot;) is still sometimes consumed by Plains Indians who have retained these cultural traditions. Plums were one of the most important wild plant foods on the Oklahoma reservation.

===Hunting===

Although people of the Plains hunted other animals, such as elk or pronghorn, buffalo was the primary game food source. Before horses were introduced, hunting was a more complicated process. Hunters would surround the bison, and then try to herd them off cliffs or into confined places where they could be more easily killed. The Plains Indians constructed a v-shaped funnel, about a mile long, made of fallen trees or rocks. Sometimes bison could be lured into a trap by a person covering himself with a bison skin and imitating the call of the animals.

Before their adoption of guns, the Plains Indians hunted with spears, bows, and various forms of clubs. The use of horses by the Plains Indians made hunting (and warfare) much easier. With horses, the Plains Indians had the means and speed to stampede or overtake the bison. The Plains Indians reduced the length of their bows to three feet to accommodate their use on horseback. They continued to use bows and arrows after the introduction of firearms because guns took too long to reload and were too heavy. In the summer, many tribes gathered for hunting in one place. The main hunting seasons were fall, summer, and spring. In winter, adverse weather such as snow and blizzards made it more difficult to locate and hunt bison.

===Clothing===

Hides, with or without fur, provided material for much clothing. Most of the clothing consisted of the hides of buffalo and deer, as well as numerous species of birds and other small game. Plains moccasins tended to be constructed with soft braintanned hide on the vamps and tough rawhide for the soles. Men&#x27;s moccasins tended to have flaps around the ankles, while women&#x27;s had high tops, which could be pulled up in the winter and rolled down in the summer. Honored warriors and leaders earn the right to wear war bonnets, headdresses with feathers, often of golden or bald eagles.

== Society and culture ==
===Religion===
While there are some similarities among linguistic and regional groups, different tribes have their own cosmologies and world views. Some of these are animist in nature, with aspects of polytheism, while others tend more towards monotheism or panentheism. Prayer is a regular part of daily life, for regular individuals as well as spiritual leaders, alone and as part of group ceremonies. One of the most important gatherings for many of the Plains tribes is the yearly Sun Dance, an elaborate spiritual ceremony that involves personal sacrifice, multiple days of fasting and prayer for the good of loved ones and the benefit of the entire community.

Certain people are considered to be &quot;wakan&quot; (Lakota: &quot;holy&quot;), and go through many years of training to become medicine men or women, entrusted with spiritual leadership roles in the community. The buffalo and eagle are particularly sacred to many of the Plains peoples, and may be represented in iconography, or parts used in regalia. In Plains cosmology, certain items may possess spiritual power, particularly medicine bundles which are only entrusted to prominent religious figures of a tribe, and passed down from keeper to keeper in each succeeding generation.

===Gender roles===
Historically, Plains Indian women had distinctly defined gender roles that were different from, but complementary to, men&#x27;s roles. They typically owned the family&#x27;s home and the majority of its contents. In traditional culture, women tanned hides, tended crops, gathered wild foods, prepared food, made clothing, and took down and erected the family&#x27;s tepees. In the present day, these customs are still observed when lodges are set up for ceremonial use, such as at pow wows. Historically, Plains women were not as engaged in public political life as were the women in the coastal tribes. However, they still participated in an advisory role and through the women&#x27;s societies.

In contemporary Plains cultures, traditionalists work to preserve the knowledge of these traditions of everyday life and the values attached to them.

Plains women in general have historically had the right to divorce and keep custody of their children. Because women own the home, an unkind husband can find himself homeless. A historical example of a Plains woman divorcing is Making Out Road, a Cheyenne woman, who in 1841 married non-Native frontiersman Kit Carson. The marriage was turbulent and formally ended when Making Out Road threw Carson and his belongings out of her tepee (in the traditional manner of announcing a divorce). She later went on to marry, and divorce, several additional men, both European-American and Indian.

===Warfare===
 
The earliest 16th-century Spanish explorers did not find the Plains Indians especially warlike. The Wichita in Kansas and Oklahoma lived in dispersed settlements with few defensive works. The Spanish initially had friendly contacts with the Apache (Querechos) in the Texas Panhandle.

Three factors led to a growing importance of warfare in Plains Indian culture. First, was the Spanish colonization of New Mexico which stimulated raids and counter-raids by Spaniards and Indians for goods and slaves. Second, was the contact of the Indians with French fur traders which increased rivalry among Indian tribes to control trade and trade routes. Third, was the acquisition of the horse and the greater mobility it afforded the Plains Indians. What evolved among the Plains Indians from the 17th to the late 19th century was warfare as both a means of livelihood and a sport. Young men gained both prestige and plunder by fighting as warriors, and this individualistic style of warfare ensured that success in individual combat and capturing trophies of war were highly esteemed 

The Plains Indians raided each other, the Spanish colonies, and, increasingly, the encroaching frontier of the Anglos for horses, and other property. They acquired guns and other European goods primarily by trade. Their principal trading products were buffalo hides and beaver pelts. The most renowned of all the Plains Indians as warriors were the Comanche whom &quot;The Economist&quot; noted in 2010: &quot;They could loose a flock of arrows while hanging off the side of a galloping horse, using the animal as protection against return fire. The sight amazed and terrified their white (and Indian) adversaries.&quot; The American historian S. C. Gwynne called the Comanche &quot;the greatest light cavalry on the earth&quot; in the 19th century whose raids in Texas terrified the American settlers.

Although they could be tenacious in defense, Plains Indians warriors took the offensive mostly for material gain and individual prestige. The highest military honors were for &quot;counting coup&quot;—touching a live enemy. Battles between Indians often consisted of opposing warriors demonstrating their bravery rather than attempting to achieve concrete military objectives. The emphasis was on ambush and hit and run actions rather than closing with an enemy. Success was often counted by the number of horses or property obtained in the raid. Casualties were usually light. &quot;Indians consider it foolhardiness to make an attack where it is certain some of them will be killed.&quot; Given their smaller numbers, the loss of even a few men in battle could be catastrophic for a band, and notably at the battles of Adobe Walls in Texas in 1874 and Rosebud in Montana in 1876, the Indians broke off battle despite the fact that they were winning as the casualties were not considered worth a victory. The most famous victory ever won by the Plains Indians over the United States, the Battle of Little Bighorn, in 1876, was won by the Lakota (Sioux) and Cheyenne fighting on the defensive. Decisions whether to fight or not were based on a cost-benefit ratio; even the loss of one warrior was not considered to be worth taking a few scalps, but if a herd of horses could be obtained, the loss of a warrior or two was considered acceptable. Generally speaking, given the small sizes of the bands and the vast population of the United States, the Plains Indians sought to avoid casualties in battle, and would avoid fighting if it meant losses.

Due to their mobility, endurance, horsemanship, and knowledge of the vast plains that were their domain, the Plains Indians were often victors in their battles against the U.S. army in the American era from 1803 to about 1890. However, although Indians won many battles, they could not undertake lengthy campaigns. Indian armies could only be assembled for brief periods of time as warriors also had to hunt for food for their families. The exception to that was raids into Mexico by the Comanche and their allies in which the raiders often subsisted for months off the riches of Mexican haciendas and settlements. The basic weapon of the Indian warrior was the short, stout bow, designed for use on horseback and deadly, but only at short range. Guns were usually in short supply and ammunition scarce for Native warriors. The U.S. government through the Indian Agency would sell the Plains Indians guns for hunting, but unlicensed traders would exchange guns for buffalo hides. The shortages of ammunition together with the lack of training to handle firearms meant the preferred weapon was the bow and arrow.

== Research ==
The people of the Great Plains have been found to be the tallest people in the world during the late 19th century, based on 21st century analysis of data collected by Franz Boas for the World Columbian Exposition. This information is significant to anthropometric historians, who usually equate the height of populations with their overall health and standard of living.

<text>William Alexander Hunter (8 May 184421 July 1898) was a Scottish jurist and Liberal politician.

Hunter was born in Aberdeen, the son of James Hunter, a granite merchant, of Aberdeen. He was educated at Aberdeen grammar school and university. He entered the Middle Temple, and was called to the English bar in 1867, but then was occupied mainly with teaching. In 1869 he was appointed professor of Roman law at University College, London, and in 1878 professor of jurisprudence, resigning that chair in 1882.

Hunter&#x27;s name became well known during this period as the author of a standard work on Roman law, &quot;Roman Law in the Order of a Code&quot;, together with a smaller introductory volume for students, &quot;Introduction to Roman Law&quot;.

After 1882 Hunter took up politics and was elected to parliament for Aberdeen North as a Liberal at the 1885 general election. In the House of Commons he was a prominent supporter of Charles Bradlaugh; he was the first to advocate old age pensions, and in 1890 carried a proposal to free elementary education in Scotland. In 1895 his health broke down; he resigned his seat in Parliament on 24 April 1896 by taking the Chiltern Hundreds.

<doc id="1331578" wikidata="Q740414" url="?curid=1331578" title="White Noise (2005 film)">
<text>White Noise is a 2005 supernatural horror film directed by Geoffrey Sax and starring Michael Keaton and Deborah Kara Unger. The title refers to electronic voice phenomena (EVP), where anomalous voice-like sounds, which some believe to be from the &quot;other side&quot; — interpreted as spirit voices, are found on electronic audio recordings.

==Plot==
Jonathan Rivers is an architect, married to his wife Anna, a best-selling author. The couple have a young son from Jonathan&#x27;s previous marriage, and Anna is newly pregnant. One evening, Anna fails to arrive home and becomes missing for five weeks without explanation.

Soon after Anna&#x27;s disappearance, Jonathan is contacted by Raymond Price, whose son has died. Raymond explains he has received frequent communication from his son and other spirits via electronic voice phenomena (EVP), claiming to also have recorded voice messages from Anna and suggests she is dead. Jonathan is initially dismissive and angered, yet he later learns of his wife&#x27;s tragic drowning. The news reports the incident as an accidental death.

Jonathan encounters numerous instances of what he interprets as Anna attempting to contact him. Desperate, he visits Raymond to inquire more on EVP. During this visit, Jonathan is befriended by Sarah Tate, a woman who has also come to Raymond for his EVP work because her fiancé has recently died.

Jonathan captures a recorded voice and believes it is indeed his wife&#x27;s and becomes obsessed with trying to contact her himself. He soon encounters other voices — angry, aggressive, vulgar, and threatening.

Raymond is found inexplicably dead. Jonathan and Sarah begin to review Raymond&#x27;s EVP logs.
Jonathan seeks advice from a psychic and is warned that, while she takes measures to avoid hostile entities, EVP is an indiscriminate process that offers no such safeguards. She cautions Jonathan&#x27;s pursuance of EVP, comparing it to the potential dangers of using a Ouija board to invoke spirits.

Jonathan begins to be followed by three demons attracted by his obsession with EVP. He finds some of the EVP messages he receives are from people who are not yet dead but may soon be. Jonathan hears EVP cries from a woman whom he rushes to find in a wrecked car with an infant child. He is able to save the child but not the woman. At that woman&#x27;s funeral, which Jonathan and Sarah both attend, Jonathan approaches the husband and attempts to explain how he came to know of the accident, beginning to discuss EVP. The man thanks Jonathan for saving his son but then demands to be left alone.

Afterward, while working with his EVP devices, Jonathan sees images of another person, a recently missing woman named Mary Freeman. Sarah is later seriously injured by a fall from a high-rise balcony while possessed by the demons, an incident which was foreshadowed by Sarah&#x27;s image being among those on the EVP devices.

Following signs he finds on EVP recordings, Jonathan locates the site where he believes the missing Mary Freeman is being kept. He contacts police to report his suspicion and insists they come to the location right away. Jonathan finds elaborate EVP deciphering electronic equipment on site. A construction workman from Jonathan&#x27;s company, who has been doing his own EVP work, is found to be holding Mary captive. He is under the control of the three demons, doing their evil bidding, and as the demons preside over this conversation, the workman confesses he has been instructed to kill Mary, insinuating he did the same with Anna. As the three demons watch, Jonathan attempts to save Mary, but the demons intervene, torturing Jonathan by breaking his arms and legs and cause him to fall to his death. A police SWAT team arrives on scene and are able to save Mary by shooting the workman dead.

Leaving Jonathan&#x27;s funeral, his ex-wife and son hear Jonathan&#x27;s voice coming from the car radio through static interference saying, &quot;I&#x27;m sorry, Mikey,&quot; to his son, who recognizes the voice and smiles. Sarah, in a wheelchair at Jonathan&#x27;s graveside, is menaced by odd noises in the wind.

Just before film credits roll, the camera flashes to a screen where the image of Jonathan and his wife is visible in white noise static. A closing intertitle reads, &quot;Of the many thousands of documented EVP messages, approximately 1 in 12 have been overtly threatening in nature...&quot;

==Cast==

==Production==
In May 2003, it was announced Michael Keaton was attached to star in the film with principal photography slated to begin in August of that year.

== Reception ==
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 7% of 149 critics&#x27; reviews are positive, with an average rating of 3.4/10. The website&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;While there are some built-in scares, the movie is muddled and unsatisfying&quot;. Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, gave the film a score of 30 out of 100, based on 32 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;.

==Sequel==
A sequel titled &quot;White Noise: The Light&quot; was released in January 2007.

==Legacy==
&quot;White Noise&quot;&#x27;s surprising box-office success for a movie released on the first weekend after New Year&#x27;s Day, the start of the winter dump months and usually one of the worst weekends for new releases, led studios to reassess their releasing strategies for horror films. In 2013, Universal chairman Adam Fogelson said, &quot;The first weekend in January used to be a non-starter for people; we had this little horror movie &quot;White Noise&quot; that did business, and that has become a place where movies [like] that tend to operate.&quot;

If a horror film as poorly received as &quot;White Noise&quot; could nevertheless make a significant amount of money in January, studios realized, a quality film in that genre could do even better. In 2008, an elaborate viral marketing campaign gave Paramount&#x27;s found footage horror film &quot;Cloverfield&quot; a $40 million opening weekend, which remained the record for January until &quot;Ride Along&quot; in 2014. In 2012 Paramount beat &quot;White Noise&quot;&#x27;s first-weekend success with &quot;The Devil Inside&quot;, which took in $35 million despite a strongly negative reaction from critics and audiences. &quot;Ever since &quot;White Noise&quot; was a hit in 2005, that&#x27;s what started it. If you look back at every first weekend, besides expanding titles, the only new release is usually one crappy horror movie,&quot; C. Robert Cargill of Ain&#x27;t It Cool News told Hollywood.com in 2013.

Another surprise from the first film&#x27;s legacy was the stand-alone sequel, &quot;White Noise: The Light&quot;, released in 2007 and starring Nathan Fillion (&quot;Firefly&quot;, &quot;The Suicide Squad&quot;) and Katee Sackhoff (&quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;, &quot;The Mandalorian&quot;). The film holds a 75% &quot;fresh&quot; rating on the Rotten Tomatoes aggregate review site and was considered a superior film in many ways, with strong critical praise for the powerful performances of its two leads.

<text>In particle physics, B&quot; − &quot;L (pronounced &quot;bee minus ell&quot;) is a quantum number which is the difference between the baryon number () and the lepton number () of a quantum system.

==Details==
This quantum number is the charge of a global/gauge U(1) symmetry in some Grand Unified Theory models, called . Unlike baryon number alone or lepton number alone, this hypothetical symmetry would not be broken by chiral anomalies or gravitational anomalies, as long as this symmetry is global, which is why this symmetry is often invoked.

If exists as a symmetry, then for the seesaw mechanism to work has to be spontaneously broken to give the neutrinos a nonzero mass.

The anomalies that would break baryon number conservation and lepton number conservation individually cancel in such a way that is always conserved. One hypothetical example is proton decay where a proton () would decay into a pion () and positron ().

The weak hypercharge is related to via

formula_1

where &quot;X&quot; charge (not to be confused with the X boson) is the conserved quantum number associated with the global U(1) symmetry Grand Unified Theory.

<text>Sir William Wilson Hunter (15 July 18406 February 1900) was a Scottish historian, statistician, a compiler and a member of the Indian Civil Service.

He is most known for &quot;The Imperial Gazetteer of India&quot; on which he started working in 1869, and which was eventually published in nine volumes in 1881, then fourteen, and later as a twenty-six volume set after his death.

==Early life and education==
William Wilson Hunter was born on 15 July 1840 in Glasgow, Scotland, to Andrew Galloway Hunter, a Glasgow manufacturer. He was the second of his father&#x27;s three sons. In 1854 he started his education at the &#x27;Quaker Seminary&#x27; at Queenswood, Hampshire, and a year later he joined The Glasgow Academy.

He was educated at the University of Glasgow (BA 1860), Paris and Bonn, acquiring a knowledge of Sanskrit, LL.D., before passing first in the final examination for the Indian Civil Service in 1862.

==Career==
He reached Bengal Presidency in November 1862 and was appointed assistant magistrate and collector of Birbhum, in the lower provinces of Bengal, where he began collecting local traditions and records, which formed the materials for his publication, entitled &quot;The Annals of Rural Bengal&quot;, which influenced the historical romances of Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay.

He also compiled &quot;A Comparative Dictionary of the Non-Aryan Languages of India&quot;, a glossary of dialects based mainly upon the collections of Brian Houghton Hodgson, which according to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition, &quot;testifies to the industry of the writer but contains much immature philological speculation&quot;.

In 1869 Lord Mayo, the then governor-general, asked Hunter to submit a scheme for a comprehensive statistical survey of India. The work involved the compilation of a number of local gazetteers, in various stages of progress, and their consolidation in a condensed form upon a single and uniform plan. There was unhappiness with the scope and completeness of the earlier surveys conducted by administrators such as Buchanan, and Hunter determined to model his efforts on the &quot;Ain-i-Akbari&quot; and &quot;Description de l&#x27;Égypte&quot;. Hunter said that &quot;It was my hope to make a memorial of England&#x27;s work in India, more lasting, because truer and more complete, than these monuments of Mughal Empire and of French ambition.&quot;

In response to Mayo&#x27;s question on 30 May 1871 of whether the Indian Muslims are &quot;bound by their religion to rebel against the Queen&quot; Hunter completed his influential work &quot;The Indian Musalmans&quot; in mid-June 1871 and later published it as a book in mid-August of the same year. In it, Hunter concluded that the majority of the Indian Muslim scholars rejected the idea of rebelling against the Government because of their opinion that the condition for religious war, i.e. the absence of protection and liberty between Muslims and infidel rulers, did not exist in British India; and that &quot;there is no &quot;jihad&quot; in a country where protection is afforded&quot;.

In 1872 Hunter published his history of Orissa. The third International Sanitary Conference held at Constantinople in 1866 declared Hindu and Muslim pilgrimages to be &#x27;the most powerful of all the causes which conduce to the development and propagation of Cholera epidemics&#x27;. Hunter echoing the view described the &#x27;squalid pilgrim army of Jagannath&#x27; as 

He embarked on a series of tours throughout the country, and he supervised the &quot;A Statistical Account of Bengal&quot; (20 volumes, 1875–1877) and a similar work for Assam (2 volumes, 1879).

Hunter wrote that 

The statistical accounts, covering the 240 administrative districts, comprised 128 volumes and these were condensed into the nine volumes of &quot;The Imperial Gazetteer of India&quot;, which was published in 1881. The &quot;Gazetteer&quot; was revised in later series, the second edition comprising 14 volumes published between 1885 and 1887, while the third comprised 26 volumes, including an atlas, and was published in 1908 under the editorship of Herbert Hope Risley, William Stevenson Meyer, Richard Burn and James Sutherland Cotton.

Again according to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition, Hunter &quot;adopted a transliteration of vernacular place-names, by which means the correct pronunciation is ordinarily indicated; but hardly sufficient allowance was made for old spellings consecrated by history and long usage.&quot; Hunter&#x27;s own article on India was published in 1880 as &quot;A Brief History of the Indian Peoples&quot;, and has been widely translated and utilized in Indian schools. A revised form was issued in 1895, under the title of &quot;The Indian Empire: its People, History and Products&quot;.

Hunter later said that 

Hunter contributed the articles &quot;Bombay&quot;, &quot;Calcutta&quot;, &quot;Dacca&quot;, &quot;Delhi&quot; and &quot;Mysore&quot; to the 9th edition (1875–89) of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;.

In 1882 Hunter, as a member of the governor-general&#x27;s council, presided over the Commission on Indian Education; in 1886 he was elected vice-chancellor of the University of Calcutta.
In 1887 he retired from the service, was created KCSI, and settled at Oaken Holt, near Oxford. He was on the governing body of Abingdon School from 1895 until his death in 1900.

On 13 March 1889 Philip Lyttelton Gell the then Secretary to the Delegates of the Clarendon Press, wrote to Hunter about 

Gell arranged the publication of the series by June 1889; with Hunter receiving £75 for each volume, and the author £25. Gell&#x27;s experience of the earlier unsaleable &quot;Sacred Books of the East&quot; and financial constraints forced the &quot;Rulers of India&quot; to end at 28 volumes in spite of Hunter&#x27;s disappointment about the same.
Hunter himself contributed the volumes on Dalhousie (1890) and Mayo (1891) to the series.

He had previously written an official &quot;Life of Lord Mayo&quot;, which was published on 19 November 1875 in two volumes with a second edition appearing in 1876. He also wrote a weekly article on Indian affairs for &quot;The Times&quot;.
But the great task to which he applied himself on his settlement in England was a history upon a large scale of the &quot;British Dominion in India&quot;, two volumes of which only had appeared when he died, carrying the reader barely down to 1700. He was much hindered by the confused state of his materials, a portion of which he arranged and published in 1894 as &quot;Bengal Manuscript Records&quot;, in three volumes.

Hunter dedicated his 1892 work &quot;Bombay 1885 to 1890: A Study in Indian Administration&quot; to Florence Nightingale.

His later works include the novel titled &quot;The Old Missionary&quot; (1895, described on the title-page as &quot;revised from &quot;The Contemporary Review&quot;&quot;), and &quot;The Thackerays in India&quot; (1897). John F. Riddick describes Hunter&#x27;s &quot;The Old Missionary&quot; as one of the &quot;three significant works&quot; produced by Anglo-Indian writers on Indian missionaries along with &quot;The Hosts of the Lord&quot; (1900) by Flora Annie Steel and &quot;Idolatry&quot; (1909) by Alice Perrin.

In the winter of 1898–1899, in consequence of the fatigue incurred in a journey to the Caspian and back, on a visit to the sick-bed of one of his two sons, Hunter was stricken down by a severe attack of influenza, which affected his heart. He died at Oaken Holt on 6 February 1900.

S. C. Mittal believes that Hunter &quot;represented the official mind of the bureaucratic Victorian historians in India&quot;, of whom James Talboys Wheeler and Alfred Comyn Lyall were other examples.

<doc id="1331598" wikidata="Q2497674" url="?curid=1331598" title="SlipKnot (web browser)">
<text>SlipKnot was one of the earliest World Wide Web browsers, available to Microsoft Windows users between November 1994 and January 1998. It was created by Peter Brooks of MicroMind, Inc. to provide a fully graphical view of the web for users without a SLIP or other TCP/IP connection to the net, hence the name – SLIP...not. SlipKnot provided a graphical web experience through what would otherwise be a text-only Unix shell account. SlipKnot version 1.0 was released on November 22, 1994, approximately 3 weeks before Netscape&#x27;s Netscape Navigator version 1.0 came out. It was designed to serve a significant fraction of PC/Windows-based Internet users who could not use Mosaic or Netscape at that time. (Internet Explorer was released in the following year after SlipKnot, in August 1995.)

==History==
In 1994 and 1995, the majority of home PC users who were interested in accessing the World Wide Web had to do so using terminal-based software. These users usually had dial-up shell accounts with their employers&#x27; Unix machines or with commercial UNIX ISPs (e.g. Netcom). They would run a terminal emulator program on their PCs, temporarily turning the machines into black screen terminals, dial into the Unix server, and then run text-based internet software such as pine and elm for e-mail, gopher for file retrieval, and lynx or www for a text-based browsing experience of the new World Wide Web. While this text-based browsing was fine while web pages were text-only, Mosaic changed the browser and web-page landscape in 1993 by displaying and therefore encouraging graphical, multimedia and multifont web pages. It also pioneered the point-and-click navigation for web browsing that had been a standard for prior hypertext applications, like Windows Help.

Mosaic had been developed by university programmers who had access to full TCP/IP connections and high-speed transmissions. This was evident in the design of the program – for instance, after clicking on a hypertext link, the user had to wait until all parts of the page had been retrieved by the browser before anything showed on the screen. High-speed connections allowed TCP/IP&#x27;s ability to do multiple retrievals at once, and for the delay between the user&#x27;s request for a page and its appearance to be short. Therefore, not only could Mosaic not be used by most home users because of their lack of TCP/IP connections, but even if they had TCP/IP, the low speed of home modems would bring out the problems in the Mosaic design for slower speed connections (typically 9600 and 14.4k baud).

In 1994, some ISPs started to offer TCP/IP connections via dial-in modems, with protocols like SLIP and PPP. But this was leading-edge technology, and so it was extraordinarily difficult to set up and maintain a home TCP/IP connection. Therefore, a large fraction of home users were stuck with dial-up Unix shell connections, and could not use Mosaic, or Netscape, or any of the other TCP/IP-based browsers that business- and academia-based users enjoyed.

Having seen Mosaic late in 1993 and been captivated by its potential, Peter Brooks set out in April 1994 to create a fully graphic, multifont web browser for home PC users.

==Browser==
SlipKnot version 1.0 was completed and released as shareware in November 1994, thus making
it the first purchasable browser on the market. Its name is a play on the term slip knot (a type of knot) against SLIP (Serial Line Internet Protocol) – an early version of TCP/IP over modem lines – and not after the fact that, unlike Mosaic and Netscape browser offerings, a SLIP connection was not necessary to view graphical web content.

SlipKnot was given the Best Communications Shareware Program of 1995 Award by Ziff-Davis and was runner-up for the Best Overall Shareware Program of 1995.

By mid-1996 when further development ceased, the majority of home internet users were able to obtain TCP/IP connections that were easy to install, and all new internet software development was dependent upon that protocol.

==Technical==
SlipKnot&#x27;s rendering engine was written in C, and its user interface in Visual Basic. Because it had only a Unix commandline to communicate with, it &quot;drove&quot; the Unix host by sending characters to its commandline as if a person were typing them (as a &quot;bot&quot;). First, SlipKnot would request the retrieval of individual parts of a desired web page – the text, and then each picture – into files on the Unix host. This was done by executing the text-based web browser &quot;lynx&quot; on the Unix host with command-line arguments indicating which URL to retrieve, and the filename to create on the Unix host when the data was finally retrieved. This retrieval, from web page host to Unix host, was usually very fast, since these machines were connected by high speed communications lines. After the URL contents were moved to the Unix host, they had to be moved down to the PC. This was done by executing the communications program zmodem (sending the zmodem command to the Unix command-line) and then instantly placing the PC into receive mode.

Once the text (HTML) portion of a web page had been retrieved (it was always retrieved first), the page would be displayed by SlipKnot and could be read by the user, after which the pictures
were retrieved in the background and eventually the page fixed up to display them.

<text>Jan van Huysum (or Jan van Huijsum) (15 April 1682 – 8 February 1749) is the most notable member of the Van Huysum family of artists working in Dutch Golden Age of the 17th and 18th centuries; &quot;by common consent, Jan van Huysum has been held to be the best painter of flowers.&quot; Trained in decoration from a young age, he &quot;gradually developed an execution of details of the utmost beauty and finish&quot; creating &quot;wonderful flower pieces whereon drops of water and crawling ants could be seen without a magnifying glass.&quot;

==Life and work==
Jan was the son of the painter Justus van Huysum and his first wife Margrietje Schouten and the older brother of Jacob van Huysum and Justus van Huysum the Younger. Jan’s much younger half-brother Michiel van Huysum was also a flower painter. His grandfather Jan van Huysum the Elder is said to have been &quot;expeditious in decorating doorways, screens and vases.&quot;

Van Huysum primarily lived and worked in the city of Amsterdam. Jan van Huysum and his wife Elisabeth Takens (1680–1751) had 12 children together but only three outlived their parents. Jan van Huysum&#x27;s daughter, Francina Margaretha van Huysum, was also a flower painter and may have assisted her father in his work. Margareta Haverman was his student until she moved to Paris.

Van Huysum was somewhat secretive about his process and worked separately from the rest of his family. One of the few sources of biography for Van Huysum is art dealer Christiaan Josi. Another is his contemporary Johan von Gool.

Jan Van Huysum &quot;holds the highest place among painters of fruit and flowers.&quot; His flower-arrangement still lifes, in a style of the period collectively called &quot;vanitas&quot; and/or &quot;Pronkstilleven&quot;, are said to possess &quot;an unerring elegance of composition, which enabled him to avoid the imbalance, the overcomposition, that others risked.&quot; His flower pictures produced after 1720 &quot;on light or yellow grounds are superior to his earlier works, which are on dark ones.&quot; He often painted on oak and copper panels rather than canvas. Van Huysum would initially paint his leaves in blue and then apply a brown or green overwash; this technique was pioneered by Otto Marseus van Schrieck. He painted from &quot;life,&quot; meaning fresh-cut flowers, assembling them over time into visual bouquets; sometimes this meant pieces took a year or more as he waited for certain blossoms to come back in season, such as a yellow rose he wanted for 1742 picture.

He was successful in his own time, with his pictures sought &quot;by princes and crowned heads—his work sometimes sold for four to five times as much as work by Rembrandt van Rijn—and &quot;time has increased, rather than diminished&quot; the value of his paintings. Buyers of note during van Huysum&#x27;s lifetime included Prince William of Hesse, and Sir Robert Walpole, a British Prime Minister.

His contemporary rival was Rachel Ruysch. The earlier Dutch artist Jan David de Heem anticipated van Huysum; &quot;if de Heem, by the harmony of his warm golden color, be called the Titian of flowers and fruits, Jan van Huysum’s bright and sunny treatment entitles him to the name of the Corregio of the same branch of art&quot;.

== Influence ==
Van Huysum&#x27;s work determined the &quot;main trends in flower paintings for sixty to eighty years after his death.&quot;

Fruit and flower artists whose work is described as inspired by or analogous to that of Jan van Huysum: Jacob van Huysum (his brother), Justus van Huysum (his father), Pieter Faes, Wybrand Hendriks, Paul Theodore van Brussel, Jacobus Linthorst, Jan van Os, George Jacob Jan van Os (son of preceding), Gerard van Spaendonck, Cornelius van Spaendonck (brother of preceding), Coenraet Roepel, Johannes de Bosch, and John Flaxman.

== Work in other genres ==
One art historian called van Huysum’s landscapes (as opposed to his still lifes) &quot;rather unfortunate.&quot;

Half of his pictures in public galleries are landscapes, views of imaginary lakes and harbours with impossible ruins and classic edifices, and woods of tall and motionless trees-the whole very glossy and smooth, and entirely lifeless. The earliest dated work of this kind is that of 1717, in the Louvre, a grove with maidens culling flowers near a tomb, ruins of a portico, and a distant palace on the shores of a lake bounded by mountains. According to one 19th century art historian, &quot;His small [landscapes] are tenderly touched, and are sufficiently pleasing with their minuteness of detail, but those of a larger size are weak and ineffective.&quot;

===Access and collections===
Van Huysum’s paintings are in the collections of the Louvre in Paris, the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, the Mauritshuis of The Hague, the National Gallery of London, The Hermitage in St. Petersburg, as well as in Berlin, Munich, Hanover, Dresden, Brunschwige, Vienna, Carlsruhe, Boston, Copenhagen, the Dulwich Picture Gallery, and the Getty in the United States.

Circa 1911: Some of the finest of van Huysum&#x27;s fruit and flower pieces were in English private collections: those of 1723 in the Francis Egerton, 1st Earl of Ellesmere&#x27;s gallery; others of 1730–1732 in the collections of Henry Hope of Cavendish Square (Hope &amp; Co. banking money), and Francis Baring, 5th Baron Ashburton and/or Thomas Baring, 1st Earl of Northbrook (both Barings Bank money).

===The stolen &quot;Vase of Flowers&quot; ===

&quot;The Vase of Flowers&quot; is a painting by van Huysum that was stolen from Italy by the retreating Wehrmacht in 1943. On 19 July 2019 German minister of foreign affairs Heiko Maas personally handed the picture to his Italian counterpart Enzo Moavero Milanesi in Florence and it was restored to the collection of the Uffizi.

<doc id="1331603" wikidata="Q330400" url="?curid=1331603" title="Abraham Mignon">
<text>Abraham Mignon or Minjon (21 June 164027 March 1679), was a still life painter. He is known for his flower pieces, still lifes with fruit, still lifes in forests or grottoes, still lifes of game and fish as well as his garland paintings. His works are influenced by those of Jan Davidszoon de Heem and Jacob Marrel.

After commencing his artistic training in his native Germany, he moved to the Dutch Republic where he was active in Utrecht during the last part of his short life. His works were sought after by 17th and 18th-century collectors from the highest ranks of society throughout Europe.

==Life==
Mignon was born in Frankfurt where he was baptized in the Calvinist church on 21 June 1640. His family was originally from Hainaut in the Southern Netherlands from where it had immigrated to Germany for religious reasons. In Frankfurt they owned a shop.

When Abraham&#x27;s family moved to Wetzlar in 1649, Abraham was placed in the care of Jacob Marrel, a specialist flower painter and art dealer. Marrel gave the young boy also artistic training. He clearly trusted Mignon to handle his business, as he would leave it in Mignon&#x27;s hands during his frequent visits to the Dutch Republic and in particular, Utrecht. It was also Marrell who asked Mignon to train his live-in stepdaughter Maria Sibylla Merian (1647–1717) in the art of still-life painting. Maria Sibylla Merian was the daughter of the engraver Matthew Merian (1647–1717). Maria Sibylla Merian achieved distinction as a flower painter.
It is possible that in 1660 Mignon had moved to Wetzlar where the rest of his family had moved. Other sources state that by 1659 Marrell and Mignon had left Frankfurt for Utrecht. It is possible that the death of Mignon&#x27;s father around this time prompted the relocation to Utrecht. In 1669 Marrel and Mignon were both registered in the Guild of Saint Luke there. Mignon was an assistant in the workshop of Jan Davidszoon de Heem in Utrecht. Jan Davidszoon de Heem was an important innovator of still life painting who had worked for many years in Antwerp before returning to Utrecht in 1667. It is possible that after de Heem moved back to Antwerp in 1672 Mignon took over de Heem&#x27;s workshop.

Throughout his life Mignon seems to have held on to the strict religious beliefs of his family. This is confirmed by his election in 1672 to the position of deacon of the Waalse Kerk (Walloon Church) of Utrecht, a position he remained in for five years. He married Maria Willaerts on 3 February 1675 in the French reformed Janskerk in Utrecht. His wife was the granddaughter of the marine painter Adam Willaerts, daughter of the painter Cornelis Willaerts and niece of the fish still life painter Jacob Gillig. Some sources state that Mignon moved back to his native Frankfurt in 1676 based on a record that seems to imply that his 6th child was baptized in Frankfurt on 17 December 1676. By 1677 he would then have moved back to Utrecht.

Mignon died in Utrecht at the age of 39. He left two daughters when he died, Catharina and Anna.

Besides Maria Sibylla Merian, another known pupil of Mignon was Ernst Stuven.

==Work==
===General===
Mignon was a specialist still life painter whose subjects ranged from flowers, fruit, forest still lifes, game pieces, garland paintings, fish still lifes and insect pieces. His best-known works are his elaborate compositions of flowers and fruits arranged in niches or on stone ledges, or displayed in grottos or amidst ruins. As Mignon never dated his compositions it has been notoriously difficult to establish a chronology for his work. On stylistic grounds it is assumed that his more elaborate still lifes of flowers, characterised by clear colours, sharp focus and the use of a dark background, are Mignon&#x27;s distillation of de Heem&#x27;s style. Such works likely date from the years around 1670 when he was working closely with his master in de Heem&#x27;s workshop.
The majority of Mignon&#x27;s works take the portrait format and only a few are in landscape format. As Mignon died at a relatively young age, it is reasonable to assume that the circa 400 still-life paintings attributed to him were executed with the assistance of his workshop or by followers of his style. His large output demonstrates the popularity of his works, which were collected widely in the 17th and 18h centuries, including by king Louis XIV of France and the Elector of Saxony. Mignon&#x27;s success also attracted followers and imitators such as Jan Mortel, Conraet Roepel and Jacob Bart.

The principal influences on his work are the works of de Heem and Marrel. De Heem&#x27;s compositions were the principal reference point for Mignon&#x27;s still lifes. His work is distinguished from de Heem by his rendering of nature in a cooler, more distant and sterile manner, through the precision in detail and drawing. His flower pieces are marked by their careful finish and delicate handling. Mignon preferred a red, yellow and blue color palette and highly realistic manner of depicting nature. His favourite scheme was to introduce red or white roses in the centre of the canvas and to set the whole group of flowers against a dark background.

Mignon also took inspiration from Willem van Aelst and Otto Marseus van Schrieck in his game and insect pieces. Willem van Aelst was clearly an inspiration for the game pieces while the influence of Otto Marseus van Schrieck is particularly visible in Mignon&#x27;s forest floor still lifes.

===Themes===
As can be expected in still life paintings from the 17th century, religious symbolism is often present in the works of Mignon, an artist who was deeply religious. Such symbolism is clearly present in the &quot;Still life with peonies, roses, parrot tulips, morning glory, an iris and poppies in a glass vase set within a stone niche and caterpillars, a snail, a bee and a cockchafer on the ledge below&quot; (Sotheby&#x27;s London sale of 4 July 2007 lot 41) in which various religious themes are expressed symbolically. God&#x27;s creation is symbolised through the four elements which at the time were believed to be the building blocks for everything existing in the visible world: &quot;earth&quot; is symbolised by its products (flowers, insects, stone), &quot;air&quot; by the flying insects, &quot;fire&quot; by the glass vase (which is made by fire) and &quot;water&quot; is present through the water inside the vase. The ears of corn are usually a reference to the Resurrection of Jesus as well as to the cycle of life. This theme is further expressed by the presence of caterpillars, an insect which turns into butterflies.
The motif of Vanitas or transience of life is also often present. This motif is inspired by the Christian belief that the world is only a temporary place of fleeting pleasures and sorrows from which mankind can only escape through the sacrifice and resurrection of Jesus. Mignon often represents the theme of transience through the poppies in his still lifes. For example, in the &quot;Still life with peonies, roses, parrot tulips, morning glory, an iris and poppies in a glass vase set within a stone niche and caterpillars, a snail, a bee and a cockchafer on the ledge below&quot;, the poppy in the centre is fresh, the one at the top is mature while the one hanging over the ledge is already wilting. Vanitas symbolism can also be found in the &quot;Still life with fruits, foliage and insects&quot; (Minneapolis Institute of Art). The fruit in the composition looks nice on first view but on closer inspection, it is clear it has already started to rot. The strong oak tree shows signs of blight. A stone in the foreground refers to the inevitable decay of buildings erected by humans, a theme that is reprised in the crumbling arch in the background on the right. In the &quot;Still life with flowers and a watch&quot; (Rijksmuseum) the inclusion of a watch and wilting flowers clearly emphasizes the vanitas symbolism of time destroying everything.

Abraham Mignon painted a few pronkstillevens, the sumptuous still lifes that were popular in Flanders and the Dutch Republic from the 1640s. His work in this genre was influenced by Jan Davidsz. de Heem who played an important role in developing the genre during his residence in Antwerp. A representative example in this genre is the &quot;Still life with fruit and oysters&quot; (Rijksmuseum). Mignon&#x27;s stylistic and thematic development bears witness to the blurring of boundaries between the distinctive specialties in still life painting such as vanitas pieces, game pieces, pronkstilllevens, etc. that started in the middle of the 17th century. This blurring allowed artists to experiment with the mixing of genres. An example is Mignon&#x27;s &quot;Still life of game in a forest&quot; (Louvre, 1675) in which the traditional elements of a still life are transposed to a forest. The result is a mixing of earlier genre categories and conventions. The use of a forest floor as the setting for a still life piece was not entirely new as Otto Marseus van Schrieck had already introduced it.

==Nazi-looted art==
In 1938, the Nazi Gestapo seized Mignon&#x27;s &quot;Blumenstück&quot; from the Jewish art collector Rudolf Guttmann in Vienna. Agents of Hitler&#x27;s Fuhrermuseum acquired &quot;Blumenstück&quot; at the Dorotheum on October 10, 1943. The Monuments Men recovered it and moved to it the Central Collecting Point until 1951. It was sold at Christies Mauerbach Benefit Auction in October 1996.

The German Lost Art Foundation currently lists seven artworks by Mignon, of which two have been the object of &quot;amicable settlement&quot;.

The Max Stern Art Restitution Project also lists a Mignon among the stolen artworks it is actively looking for.

<text>Edineț () is a municipality in northern Moldova. It is the administrative center of the eponymous district. The town is located 201 km north of the national capital, Chișinău. It is located at . The town administers two suburban villages, &quot;Alexăndreni&quot; and &quot;Gordineștii Noi&quot;. The population at the 2004 census was 17,292 inhabitants, including 15,624 in the town itself.

To the north of the town is the commune Hlinaia (&quot;Glina-Mare&quot;); to the south, the town of Cupcini; to the east, the commune of Ruseni; and to the west, the suburb of &quot;Alexăndreni&quot;.

==History==
The first known written mention of the locality is in a document from July 15, 1431, in which the Prince of Moldavia Alexandru cel Bun offered to Ivan Cupcici &quot;14 villages with their old domains and empty land to found new villages and an apiary&quot;. According to the document, the old name of Edineț was &quot;Viadineți&quot;, possibly meaning &quot;little Viadins&quot;. A document dating August 18, 1690, given by Prince Constantin Movilă to Cozma Pop, mentions the village as &quot;Iadineți&quot;. The name &quot;Edineț&quot; is documented since 1663, and is still used today. Between 1918–1940, the alternative spellings &quot;Edineți&quot; and &quot;Edinița&quot; were sometimes used.

In 1812, the eastern part of Moldavia was annexed by the Russian Empire and became known as Governorate of Bessarabia.

Bessarabia proclaimed independence in January 1918 as the Moldavian Democratic Republic. In April 1918, Bessarabia proclaimed union with Romania, this came as a result of the World War I. 

Later on, close to the World War II, this territory was then incorporated into the Soviet Union. 

It will later on be independent from the Soviet Union in 1991.

At the 1930 census, there were three separately administered localities: Edineți-Târg (literally &quot;Edineți-Fair&quot;), population 5,910, Edineți-Sat (&quot;Edineți-Village&quot;), population 5,260, part of Plasa Briceni of the Hotin County, and Alexăndrenii-Noi, population 1,083, part of Plasa Rășcani of the Bălți County.

Between the two World Wars there was a Zionist Tarbut school in the town.

In 1940, the Soviet Union, with the consent of the Nazi Germany occupied Bessarabia, created the Moldavian SSR, closing privately owned businesses and religious schools.

A year later, the Romanian Army, now allied with Nazi Germany, drove the Soviets out and recovered Bessarabia. German and Romanian troops entered Edineț on July 5, 1941. Before that, some of the Bessarabian Jews of Edineț had already fled. Within two days, several hundred Jews were murdered by units of Einsatzkommando D and Romanian gendarmes, assisted by some civilians. Within the first two weeks, Romanian soldiers had killed about 1,000 Jews out of 5,000 living in the town. Many women and young girls were raped; some of them committed suicide. The victims were buried in three large ditches, then the Jewish gravediggers who had interred the bodies were in turn murdered and buried on the same spot. In the middle of August a ghetto was set up. Surviving Jews of Edineț, and others from different places in the north of Bessarabia and from Bukovina, were interned. In September there were about 12,000 Jews in the ghetto, crammed into a small area, suffering from malnutrition and disease. Dozens of people died every day, succumbing to disease, cold weather, hunger, or thirst. On September 16, 1941, all the remaining Jews were deported to Transnistria, where the majority of them died. By 1944 only a few managed to survive. The few dozen families still alive at the end of the war settled either in Czernovitz or moved to Israel. Only a handful chose to return to Edineț.

In 1944, the Soviets re-conquered Bessarabia and re-established the Moldavian SSR. During the Soviet time, the town was also known in the Russified versions &quot;Yedintsy&quot; and &quot;Yedintzi&quot; and in Yiddish as &quot;Yedinets&quot; or &quot;Eydinets&quot;.

In 1960s, the Jewish population was estimated at 200. There was no synagogue, although the Jewish cemetery still existed.

Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Moldova became an independent country.

==Culture==
Edineț has a Natural History Museum, and a famous Museum of National Craftsmen, whose collection has many original folk objects and works.

==Demographics==

According to the 2014 census, the population of Edineț amounted to 15,520 inhabitants, a decrease compared to the previous census in 2004, when 17,292 inhabitants were registered. Of these, 7,211 were men and 8,309 were women.

<text>Thomas Sterry Hunt (September 5, 1826February 12, 1892) was an American geologist and chemist.

==Biography==
Hunt was born at Norwich, Connecticut. He lost his father when twelve years old, and had to earn his own livelihood. In the course of two years he found employment in a printing office, in an apothecary shop, in a book store and as a clerk. He became interested in natural science, and especially in chemical and medical studies, and in 1845 he was elected a member of the Association of American Geologists and Naturalists at Yale—a body which four years later became the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

In 1848 he presented a paper in Philadelphia &quot;On Acid Springs and Gypsum Deposits of the Onondaga Salt Group&quot;. At Yale he became assistant to Benjamin Silliman Jr., and in 1846 was appointed chemist to the Geological Survey of Vermont. In 1847 he was appointed to similar duties on the Geological Survey of Canada in Montreal under Sir William Logan, and this post he held until 1872. Upon arriving in Canada, Hunt began studying the crystalline rocks of eastern Canada, sulphate and phosphate deposits, the composition of mineral waters, and the oil resources in Enniskillen Township. In the Report of the Geological Survey for 1849-1850, Hunt analyzed a one hundred pound sample of bitumen from Enniskillen Township, noting that the mineral could be used to create asphalt, caulking material for ships or illuminating gas. Hunt&#x27;s report drew attention to the bitumen despots in Southwestern Ontario and helped ignite the first oil boom in Enniskillen Township. In December 1860, Hunt travelled to the Enniskillen oil fields and recorded that James Miller Williams and other entrepreneurs had sunk over 100 oils wells and mined somewhere between 300,000 and 400,000 gallons of oil. He resigned to become professor of geology at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He was elected an Associate Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1851.

In 1857, he invented a chromium oxide-based ink while teaching at Université Laval, in response to an appeal for measures to fight counterfeiting. The ink ended up being used on various bank notes, including the US government&#x27;s Civil War bank notes. This is the origin of the term &quot;Greenback&quot;.

In 1859 he was elected fellow of the Royal Society, and he was one of the original members and president of the Royal Society of Canada. In 1861, he was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society. He was made Chevalier or the Legion of Honor in France and an honorary doctor of laws of the University of Cambridge. He was a frequent contributor to scientific journals, writing on the crystalline limestones, the origin of continents, the chemistry of the primeval earth, on serpentines, etc. He also wrote a notable &quot;Essay on the History of the names Cambrian and Silurian&quot; (&quot;Canadian Naturalist&quot;, 1872), in which the claims of Adam Sedgwick, with respect to the grouping of the Cambrian strata, were forcibly advocated. Hunt was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1873.

Building upon John Tyndall&#x27;s research on greenhouse gases, Hunt first proposed the theory which linked climate change from the Carboniferous to the modern age to concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere in an 1863 submission to the American Journal of Science and Arts. He further explored at a meeting for the British Society for the Advancement of Science in the fall of 1878. This was well before Arrhenius established the theory of the greenhouse effect. Hunt later hypothesized that the high concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide in the geologic past was of cosmic, rather than volcanic, origin.

He died in New York City on February 12, 1892. The Thomas-Sterry-Hunt International Ecological Reserve, an ecological reserve in Quebec, Canada was established on September 7, 1988.

==Publications==

His publications include:
* &quot;Chemical and Geological Essays&quot; (1875, ed. 2, 1879)
* &quot;Mineral Physiology and Physiography&quot; (1886)
* &quot;A New Basis for Chemistry&quot; (1887, ed. 3, 1891)
* &quot;Systematic Mineralogy&quot; (1891)

==Organizations of which he was president==
* American Association for the Advancement of Science (1870)
* American Institute of Mining Engineers (1876)
* American Chemical Society (1879 and 1888)
* Royal Society of Canada (1884)

==Family==

In January, 1878, Thomas Sterry Hunt married Anna Rebecca, daughter of Mr. Justice Gale, of Montreal. She was born and educated in Montreal, Quebec. Her early years were spent on a farm adjacent to Montreal. After her father&#x27;s death, in 1865, she and her two sisters, 
Baroness von Friesen, and Mrs. Stuart of Quebec, travelled extensively in Europe. 
The couple moved to Boston, and travelled extensively both before and after her husband&#x27;s
death in February, 1892. Mrs. Hunt was a linguist, and authored volumes of poems.

<text>The Declaration of Rights of the Negro Peoples of the World was drafted and adopted at the Convention of the Universal Negro Improvement Association held in New York City&#x27;s Madison Square Garden on August 13, 1920. Marcus Garvey presided over the occasion as chairman. It was at this event where he was duly elected Provisional President of Africa.

Among the articles is Declaration 39 which states as follows:

:&quot;That the colors, Red, Black and Green, be the colors of the Negro race.&quot;

<text>The Bartow–Pell Mansion is a historic house museum at 895 Shore Road in the northern section of Pelham Bay Park, within the New York City borough of the Bronx. The two-story building, designed in the mid-19th century by an unknown architect, has a Greek Revival facade and federal interiors and is the last surviving manor house in the Pelham Bay Park area. The grounds surrounding the mansion take up and include a three-story carriage house; terraced gardens overlooking Long Island Sound to the east; and a small burial plot for the Pell family, which once occupied the land.

The house sits on an estate that Thomas Pell purchased from the native Siwanoy in 1654; the Pell family built two previous residences on the grounds in both 1675 and 1790. Robert Bartow, a relative of the Pell family, built the third and current house at some point between 1836 and 1842. Ownership of the house remained in the Bartow and Pell families until 1888, when the government of New York City bought it, and the house remained empty until 1914 when the International Garden Club, co-founded by Zelia Hoffman and Alice Martineau, leased it. The IGC renovated the home into a clubhouse and moved in during 1915. Mayor Fiorello La Guardia used the mansion as his summer residence during 1936. The IGC opened part of the house to the public as a museum in May 1946 while continuing to use it as a clubhouse. The mansion&#x27;s carriage house was restored between 1987 and 1993.

The house is oriented on a north-south axis with wings on either side, and has a stone facade with balconies and large windows. The interior of the mansion&#x27;s first floor is arranged around a square central hall with an elliptical staircase; it includes two parlors, a sitting room and a small dining room. The second floor contains bedrooms, while the cellar was used for storing wine. The carriage house, which contained a stable hand&#x27;s home, vehicular storage, and the hayloft, has served as an exhibition and educational space since 1993. Some of the furnishings include the desk of Aaron Burr and a Lannuier bed. The mansion&#x27;s facade, interior, and surrounding grounds are designated as a New York City designated landmark and a National Historic Landmark.

== Site ==
The Bartow–Pell Mansion is located in the northern section of Pelham Bay Park in the Bronx in New York City. Although its official address is 895 Shore Road, the house is within a wooded portion of the park and is accessible only via a driveway extending off Shore Road. There is a parking lot in front of the mansion, at the end of the driveway. Rhododendrons and lilacs were planted along the driveway during the mid-20th century. The Bartow-Pell Woods and Pelham Bay Park&#x27;s lagoon are to the east, while the Pelham Golf Course is to the northwest. Orchard Beach is across the lagoon. A hiking path called the Siwanoy Trail loops around the estate. The nearest New York City Subway station is the Pelham Bay Park station, located across the Hutchinson River. Bee-Line Bus&#x27;s 45 route also stops outside the estate.

The mansion and its garden take up of Pelham Bay Park. Northeast of the mansion itself is the estate&#x27;s carriage house. To the east of the mansion is a formal terraced garden, which slopes down gently toward the lagoon and Long Island Sound. As built, the garden is composed of several levels, with a sunken square fountain in the center and a set of steps on either side. During the spring through fall, the fountain was surrounded by rose and tulip beds. The other terraces were planted with petunias and yew trees, as well as dahlias, zinnias, asters, and chrysanthemums. The garden is surrounded by a wall, which is made of locally sourced stone and was covered with wisteria. There are iron gates in the wall, as well as a wrought-iron fence above the wall on the eastern end of the garden. East of the fence was a lawn that overlooked the water, although Long Island Sound was no longer visible from the mansion by the 20th century. The Mary Ludington Herb Garden adjoins the terraced garden.

Just south of the Bartow–Pell Mansion was a tree named Treaty Oak. The Siwanoy Native American chief Wampage and English colonist Thomas Pell signed a treaty under the tree in 1654, in which Pell purchased all land east of the Bronx River in what was then Westchester County, New York. The oak tree, which was surrounded by a fence, was destroyed in 1906 and replanted in 1915. Approximately south of the house is a burial plot belonging to the Pell family, who had once occupied the site. This plot contains headstones dating from between 1748 and 1790. Surrounding the plot are four granite posts with pelican motifs, symbolizing the Pell family&#x27;s coat of arms. There formerly may have been additional gravestones, but they were scattered throughout the grounds by the time the International Garden Club (IGC) took over in the early 20th century. A path lined with chestnut trees connects the house to the burial plot and Long Island Sound&#x27;s shoreline.

==History==

In 1654, Thomas Pell purchased from the Siwanoy, comprising the land of the current Pelham Bay Park as well as the nearby town of Pelham, New York, and made his estate on of that land. Pell&#x27;s land became known as Pelham Manor in 1666. In the 17th and 18th centuries, during the colonial era of the United States, various prominent families built houses within Pelham Manor, including the Bartow, Bayard, Burr, Fish, Leroy, Lorillard, and Pell families. By the 18th century, several members of the Pell family had married members of the Bartow family.

Thomas&#x27;s nephew John built a residence close to Long Island Sound around 1675, about a decade after Pelham Manor was created. The house was located either east of Shore Road or at the extreme end of Pelham Neck (which is located between Eastchester Bay and the Long Island South). This house was designed in an English style, with a facade of Holland brick. The first residence was occupied by three of Pelham Manor&#x27;s lords of the manor before it burned in the American Revolutionary War. The second house, occupied by John Bartow and his wife and cousin Ann Pell Bartow, was erected circa 1790. The second house may have reused the foundation of John Pell&#x27;s first house; at the time, it was common for buildings to reuse the foundations of demolished structures on the same site. The Bartows sold the estate in 1813 to the merchant Herman Leroy. The second house was likely demolished when the Leroys owned the estate.

=== Use as residence ===
Robert Bartow, a relative of the Pell family and one of John Bartow&#x27;s grandsons, bought of his ancestor&#x27;s old estate in 1836. Robert Bartow and his wife Maria Lorillard Bartow built a mansion on the site, the third house to occupy the estate. Construction was complete on the Bartow Mansion and an adjacent carriage building by 1842, though the exact date of the house&#x27;s construction is unknown. Robert Bolton&#x27;s &quot;Guide to New Rochelle&quot;, published in 1842, stated that Robert Bartow &quot;lately&quot; constructed the mansion but did not specify further. The house had cost $60,000 (). When it was completed, the house was part of Westchester County, specifically in the town of Pelham, New York. The new mansion was sited to the southwest of the first manor house built in 1675.

The Bartow and Pell families alternately owned the building for the next four decades. Initially, Robert, Maria, and their seven children lived in the house. Robert Bartow died in 1868, and the mansion first went to his widow, then to his sons. The Bartow family occupied the mansion until at least 1883. In June 1884, Governor Grover Cleveland signed the New Parks Act into law, authorizing the creation of a system of parks in the Bronx, including Pelham Bay Park. The Bartows wanted the city to give them $467,953 for their property, although the city government had concluded that the estate was worth only $131,000.

Despite Pelham residents&#x27; opposition to the park, the New York City government acquired the land for Pelham Bay Park in 1887, and it officially became a park in 1888. The same year, the New York City government obtained the house from descendants of the Bartow family. The city paid $63,000 for the ground immediately surrounding the mansion, $33,000 for the mansion itself, and $94,625 for fourteen adjacent land lots, for a total of $190,625. The mansion was vacant for over two decades; during this time, the house fell into a severe state of neglect, and the grounds became overgrown. Although the house was owned by the New York City government, it was still part of Westchester County until 1894 or 1895, when the boundary between Westchester and the Bronx was moved northward. The Home for Crippled Children occupied the mansion for a short period in the early 20th century. The carriage house on the property was used for various purposes after being sold and was ultimately turned into storage.

=== Use as clubhouse ===

==== Renovation and reopening ====

The New York City Department of Parks and Recreation (NYC Parks) leased the building to the International Garden Club in 1914. The IGC had been co-founded by Zelia Hoffman and Alice Martineau the previous year to promote formal gardens, and they wished to create an educational garden on the estate. In addition, the club wished to host exhibits and lectures, and it planned to curate a library in the mansion. The IGC agreed to lease the house and grounds for three years, landscape the grounds with their own funds, and return the property to the city after three years. The firm of Delano &amp; Aldrich was hired to restore the home. The exterior was renovated, and the formal gardens were constructed from 1914 to 1917. The interior was also renovated to accommodate the clubhouse&#x27;s functions, although the house&#x27;s architectural details were preserved as much as possible. A designer identified only as Miss Swift redesigned the first floor, while Hoffman selected furnishings and decorations for the second floor. Sources disagree on whether the renovations cost $25,000 () or $100,000 ().

The mansion opened as the IGC&#x27;s headquarters on May 1, 1915, with a ceremony attended by New York governor Charles Whitman. As part of its lease with the city, the club had to open the mansion&#x27;s gardens to the public. In its first three years at the mansion, the IGC spent over $70,000 on the house and often held public speeches. Initially, the house was open seven days a week; although the house was usually free to enter, the club collected admission fees on two days to pay for maintenance. The IGC was responsible for maintaining the house&#x27;s interior and garden, while the city government oversaw the facade and the rest of the grounds. The club did not meet there during the summer. All of the other mansions nearby were gradually destroyed, leaving the Bartow Mansion as the only remaining mansion in Pelham Bay Park.

==== Mid-1910s through early 1940s ====
The IGC started hosting summertime outdoor flower shows in June 1916. The same year, Hoffman hired the landscape design firm Olmsted Brothers to discuss the possibility of adding a wide variety of gardens and a greenhouse. None of these ideas were ever implemented. The club renewed its contract with the city government in 1917 for five years. The following year, Bronx parks commissioner Joseph T. Hennessy unsuccessfully tried to evict the IGC from the mansion because of how they were using the grounds. The IGC had additional plans for the property, including a rock and rose garden and a painting collection, though these were delayed by World War I. In the 1920s and 1930s, the IGC continued to host its annual &quot;garden parties&quot; at the mansion, and it also hosted &quot;distinguished foreigners&quot; such as a member of the French Academy of Sciences. The mansion&#x27;s driveway was modified in the 1930s, when a parking lot was added in front of the mansion.

New York City mayor Fiorello La Guardia announced in June 1936 that the mansion would be used as the city&#x27;s first-ever &quot;Summer City Hall&quot;; this allowed him to be close to his family in Westport, Connecticut. La Guardia and several aides officially moved into the house on July 2, 1936. A temporary telephone line and a teleprinter were added to ease communication with people at City Hall in Manhattan. A temporary bus service to the New York City Subway&#x27;s Pelham Bay Park station was established to transport people to the house, and officials even replaced a 135-year-old &quot;10 Miles to City Hall&quot; sign five miles away so that it directed visitors to the mansion, rather than to City Hall. Policemen on motorcycles traveled between the mansion and City Hall several times a day, although the mansion received relatively few visitors during La Guardia&#x27;s time there. Although staffers and newspaper reporters alike complained because of the mansion&#x27;s remoteness, La Guardia liked the house so much that he decided to stay for a week longer than he originally anticipated. La Guardia and his staff left on September 4.

La Guardia used the Bartow Mansion as a summer City Hall only in 1936; during the next several years, he moved his summertime offices to Queens. His successors did not use summertime City Halls. The IGC continued to use the building. The Manville family hosted a party to raise money for the mansion in 1937, and the club hosted a tour of the house in 1941 to raise money for the British during World War II.

=== Use as museum ===

==== 1940s to 1970s ====

Following World War II, the IGC was no longer allowed to export or import plants, so it turned its efforts to renovating the house. The club renovated the mansion into a historic house museum, which opened in May 1946. NYC Parks, the Museum of the City of New York, Brooklyn Museum, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art assisted with the renovation. Initially, the Bartow Mansion Museum consisted of only four rooms: the entrance hall, dining room, parlor, and second-floor master bedroom. The IGC re-furnished the house with the assistance of the three larger museums&#x27; staff. A former president of the IGC, Mrs. Eliot Tuckerman, received an award in 1947 for her role in restoring the mansion. Initially, the house was open as a museum only on Tuesdays and Saturdays. Club members, who could visit at any time, had to cover their shoes with rubber covers to avoid damaging the rugs.

The house was renamed the Bartow–Pell Mansion in 1959, in honor of the original landowners. By the 1960s, the house invited visitors three days a week, although the garden was open every day. The IGC continued to lease the house from the city government in the 1960s, paying $1 a year and taking responsibility for maintenance. In 1963, the club upgraded the kitchen and pantry at a cost of $14,000. During the late 20th century, the mansion comprised either 10, 11, or 12 rooms.

The Bartow–Pell Mansion Museum was still open to the public three days a week in the 1970s. The museum saw few visitors because of its remoteness (a &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; article from 1975 wrote that &quot;the building is largely deserted&quot;), but its proximity to population centers made the estate vulnerable to trespassers. The IGC continued to use the mansion as its headquarters, and it renovated one of the rooms during the mid-1970s. The museum received $6,000 in 1977 to renovate the carriage house after it raised matching funds. The next year, the New York state government provided $1.3 million for repairs and upgrades to 58 historical buildings across New York state, including the Bartow–Pell Mansion. Mary Means Huber, the mansion&#x27;s curator in the late 20th century, refurbished a second-floor sitting room after joining the museum in the late 1970s. Under Huber&#x27;s tenure, the museum, whose collection largely consisted of items borrowed from other museums, began buying its own furnishings.

==== 1980s and 1990s ====
The museum began hosting educational programs , which attracted 1,500 students annually within three years. The brickwork and wooden floors of the mansion&#x27;s carriage house had become degraded, and work on the project began in 1986. Jan Hird Pokorny was hired to carry out the carriage house&#x27;s renovation. The New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation provided $110,000 in late 1987 for the restoration of the carriage house. As a precondition of the state grant, museum officials had to raise an equivalent amount; the museum had raised $110,000 from NYC Parks and $150,000 from several donors and foundations. The following August, the city agreed to give $150,000 if donors raised three times that amount. The entirety of the carriage house&#x27;s renovation was expected to cost $875,000, much of which had been raised by late 1988. The project also included new educational programs within the carriage house. The Bartow-Pell Landmark Fund also received $6,000 to create a cutaway model of the carriage house.

The stabilization of the carriage house had been completed by 1989. The house was still obscure; the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; wrote the same year that the Bartow–Pell Mansion was &quot;possibly the least-known of all the historic houses in the Bronx&quot;. The Bartow–Pell Mansion was one of the founding members of the Historic House Trust, established in 1989. At the time, the main house&#x27;s roof needed to be replaced. Students from Brooklyn College conducted excavations around the house&#x27;s site between 1990 and 1992, and several hundred trees were planted just north of the mansion in 1992. The carriage house was officially rededicated in 1993 after its renovation was complete. The IGC, which no longer operated as a garden club nor operated internationally, still supported the museum&#x27;s operation, but the Bartow Pell Landmark Fund operated the museum.

==== 2000s to present ====
The IGC repainted the rooms in the late 1990s and early 2000s and expanded its collection during that time. By 2002, the museum&#x27;s new director Robert Engel planned to renovate the entrance, demolish the parking lot, and clear a site between the carriage house and garden. As part of a promotional agreement with the New York City government, The History Channel agreed in 2004 to donate money to finance the preservation of the mansion and other historical sites in the city. Adventures in Preservation started funding the preservation of the Bartow–Pell Mansion in 2008; the same year, the IGC became the Bartow-Pell Conservancy. Between 2008 and 2011, the Bartow-Pell Conservancy re-landscaped the garden and planted new flower beds, while NYC Parks planted native plants north of the mansion. Concurrently, the museum created a master plan for the garden, which included restoring a sightline from the house to Long Island Sound. NYC Parks began receiving bids in 2009 for a restoration of the mansion&#x27;s exterior, but they did not select any of these bids.

The Bartow–Pell Mansion Museum participated in a 2012 competition administered by Partners in Preservation (a partnership between the National Trust for Historic Preservation and American Express). After a social-media campaign that attracted participants from as far as Australia and Sweden, Partners in Preservation gave the Bartow–Pell Mansion Museum $155,000 for a restoration of the terraced garden and chestnut-tree walkway. Mark K. Morrison Associates was hired to rebuild the garden, add new plantings, and restore the garden&#x27;s gates. The gardens were redesigned using photographs of Delano &amp; Aldrich&#x27;s original garden. In addition, the roof was repaired in 2012 following Hurricane Sandy, and the Historic House Trust hired Fifty-Three Renovations in 2013 to restore the mansion&#x27;s interior. A $1.7 million renovation of the mansion&#x27;s exterior commenced in April 2015, and that work was finished the next year.

The attic was opened to the public in June 2018. The Bartow–Pell Mansion Museum received 20,000 visitors annually by 2019. The mansion was closed temporarily in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City, although the mansion had live-in caretakers who continued to maintain the property.

== Architecture ==

=== Mansion ===
It is not known who designed the Bartow–Pell Mansion, although the engineer and historian Reginald Pelham Bolton claimed in 1930 that John Bolton, one of his uncles, built the mansion. The exterior is designed in the Greek Revival style, with decorations inspired by the work of architect Minard Lafever. There are unproven claims that Lafever designed the mansion, in part because he designed a church that Robert Bartow&#x27;s brother attended. A. J. Davis and Martin E. Thompson were also cited as the possible architects of the structure. The interiors are designed in the Federal style. Along with the Van Cortlandt House, the Bartow–Pell Mansion is one of two remaining manor houses in the Bronx.

==== Exterior ====
The house is oriented on a north-south axis, with wings on either side. The facade is made of plain cut stone, which was sourced from the surrounding area. The exterior walls are at least thick, allowing the mansion to remain cool even during the summer. There is a painted cornice at the top of the facade, as well as beveled quoins at each corner.

The western facade, facing Shore Road, was decorated with iron balconies, shutters, and window trimmings. The main entrance, on the western facade, is through a set of double doors flanked by a protruding iron balustrade. There is an empty niche above the double doors. The eastern facade, facing Long Island Sound, has iron balconies on the first and second stories, with windows that open onto the balconies. All of the balconies are made of elaborately decorated iron and are painted black. The large windows and the design of the stonework were typical of structures built in the area during the late 1830s and early 1840s.

==== Interior ====

The interior of the first floor is arranged symmetrically around the west-east axis. The entrance leads to a square central hall. Within this hall is a curving elliptical stairway that ascends to the attic and descends to the basement. The stairway has a balustrade with turned wood balusters and a newel post with a volute; it is illuminated by a clerestory window at the attic. The hallway itself has a plasterwork cornice and a rosette on the ceiling. On either wall are window openings and doorways, each of which is flanked by paneled pilasters and topped by a wooden pediment. Decorations such as eagles and depictions of Cupid are placed within the pilasters, while the tops of each pilaster depict honeysuckles and acanthus leaves. When the house was renovated in 1915, the halls had white woodwork and mahogany doors.

At the eastern end of the central hall is a niche flanked by doorways, which in turn lead to two elaborate, symmetrical parlors (a dining room and a drawing room) on the eastern side of the first floor. Each of these rooms measures about . The drawing room is to the left or north, while the dining room was to the right or south. The doorways from the central hall to each room are flanked by pilasters with anthemion motifs and Corinthian-style capitals, as well as a pediment above each doorway. The pediment above the drawing room depicts an eagle, while the pediment above the dining room&#x27;s doorway depicts a cherub. Both rooms contain fireplaces with marble mantelpieces; the shelves of each mantelpiece are supported by brackets with palmettes. The center of each room&#x27;s ceiling contains a rosette that is more ornate than that in the central hallway. Two medallions were also placed on one wall of the drawing room. There are sliding doors between the parlors, as well as French doors leading from either parlor to the terraced garden.

To the right of the central hall, one door leads to another door that connects with a small sitting room. Both doorways have paneled pilasters and wooden pediments akin to those in the central hall, and the sitting room itself has a black marble mantelpiece. To the left of the central hall, a similar set of doorways leads to a smaller dining room, which shares design features with the sitting room. The small dining room hosted luncheons and breakfasts. There is also a kitchen that is shared by the main museum and a separate caretaker&#x27;s apartment.

The second floor contains four bedrooms. Unlike the first-floor rooms, the bedrooms have plain design elements, including white-marble mantelpieces and molded trimmings. Each bedroom had a high ceiling to accommodate the large wardrobes and beds that were used in these rooms. One of the bedrooms, known as &quot;Clarina&#x27;s Room&quot; after one of the Bartows&#x27; daughters, was used by at least one of the family&#x27;s three daughters. Another bedroom, the nursery wing, is not publicly accessible. There is also a two-bedroom apartment for the house&#x27;s live-in caretaker on the second floor. The third floor, also known as the attic, was used as a servants&#x27; quarters. The basement contained a wine cellar.

After the house was renovated by the IGC in 1915, the right or south wing of the house contained an &quot;orangery&quot; for serving tea. The orangery, also described as a conservatory, was described by &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; as having French windows, white walls, cement floors, and a domed ceiling. One of the smaller rooms in the northern wing was turned into a secondary reception room with a green, black, and coral color scheme, while another room became a boardroom with gray walls and black marble mantel. A stair led to the IGC&#x27;s writing room and library on the northern wing&#x27;s second floor.

=== Carriage house ===

The carriage house was built no later than 1842 and is the last remaining outbuilding on the Bartow–Pell Mansion&#x27;s site. It is also the last remaining masonry carriage house in New York City that retains its original design. The three-story building was built into the slope of a hill, making it appear two stories tall on one side. Although it was common for mid-19th-century carriage houses to be built on hillsides, the hill surrounding the Bartow-Pell carriage house is artificial, with downward slopes to the north, east, and south. The stable was constructed of the same locally sourced stone as the main mansion. On the front or west facade is an elliptical brick arch flanked by a rectangular window with a brick frame and stone lintel.

Inside the carriage house was the stable hand&#x27;s home, vehicular storage, and the hayloft. Originally, the carriage house&#x27;s main level had a carriage room, stalls, and harness room. The rooms were partitioned so the horses&#x27; stalls were separated from the harness and carriage rooms, the latter two of which were intended as &quot;clean areas&quot;. Each stall was no more than wide and had a gutter to drain away horses&#x27; urine into the cellar. The attic contained the hayloft and could be accessed only via a ladder in the stall area. It is not known how hay was hoisted into the attic, but there may have been an exterior loading platform and a stair to ground level near the carriage house&#x27;s northwest corner. The attic likely also included a cupola and air gaps on its roof for ventilation. The cellar contained a cistern and two disconnected rooms. The cistern may have used water that was collected in gutters on the roof.

== Operations ==
The New York City Department of Parks and Recreation owns the house. The mansion and garden are operated by the Bartow-Pell Conservancy, formerly the International Garden Club. The museum itself is operated by the Bartow Pell Landmark Fund, which has been listed as a tax-exempt nonprofit organization since October 1975. , the mansion operates as a museum three days a week; although the gardens are free to visit, the mansion has an admission fee. The house is not wheelchair-accessible, as the main entrance can only be accessed by a short flight of steps, and there is no elevator. , Alison McKay is the Bartow–Pell Mansion Museum&#x27;s executive director.

=== Collection and exhibits ===

In the mid-20th century, many of the mansion&#x27;s furnishings were displayed on loan from larger museums. A news article from the 1960s described the house as having Savonnerie carpets, Aubusson tapestries, and Turkish rugs. In addition, there were furnishings in the Empire, Federal, and Regency styles, as well as an authentic Lannuier bed. By the 1970s, the furniture displayed at the mansion was made of dark fine-grained wood, ornamented with features such as white marble, carvings, or gold paint. The furniture included less ornate sofas with feet shaped like lions&#x27; paws; more elaborate neoclassical sofas and chairs with wooden borders and carved legs; and a tall bed with a covering at its top. The bedrooms included the &quot;Pell room&quot;, decorated with a portrait of John Pell and a carpet; the &quot;red&quot; room, with mahogany linen-press; and the &quot;yellow&quot; room, with a Duncan Phyfe bed. Also on display was a piece of Treaty Oak. The dining and drawing rooms had satin curtains, lamps, gilded-bronze fireplace mantel clocks, chandeliers, landscapes of New York state, and portraits from the 1830s.

In the 1970s, the museum began acquiring items for its own collection. By the 1980s, the interiors were painted green, blue, and pink to evoke Pompeiian ruins, and they were furnished with Italianate and Greek decorations. The front hall had a marble bust depicting Julius Caesar, the parlors had urns, and the top of the main stairway had a statue of Venus. According to a &quot;New York Times&quot; article from that decade, about half of the furniture at the time came from the Garden Club. In the 2000s, the house still displayed artifacts loaned by other museums, but it also displayed Bartow family artifacts.

Some of the mansion&#x27;s modern-day furnishings include the desk of Aaron Burr, who married a distant Bartow relative, Theodosia. The Lannuier bed, which has a white-and-orange canopy, also remains in the collection. Modern objects also include two 19th-century wooden tables, a mahogany library table, a Pembroke table, a fire screen with desk, two side chairs, and a rosewood barometer. The three rooms on the carriage house&#x27;s main floor are outfitted with exhibits, while the carriage house&#x27;s lower level contains an education gallery and an architecture and transportation gallery. There have also been temporary exhibits over the years, such as a display of gardening tools in 2012 and an exhibit of objects relating to the house&#x27;s history in 2014.

=== Events and programming ===
Starting in 1984, the museum has hosted educational programs. When the carriage house reopened in 1993, the museum allowed students to participate in live reenactments of coachmen&#x27;s lives, and videos were displayed in the carriage room&#x27;s education gallery. , the museum operates several educational programs for school classes, including courses on gardening, the habitat of the nearby woodlands, Lenape history, and the lives of the Bartow family and servants. The programming is largely targeted toward elementary school students. The museum also operates after-school programs and a summer camp for children. Visitors can see the museum without needing to book in advance, though museum staff also provide guided tours of the mansion. The museum has also provided local-history programs.

In the Bartow–Pell Mansion Museum&#x27;s early years, the Garden Club hosted a variety of events to raise money, including tours, autumn festivals, and fashion shows with tea. The mansion also hosted debutante balls, weddings, cotillions, and Christmas sales. In addition, the club had an active planting program, which in the late 1950s included dozens of perennial plantings each year. The house continued to host events such as debutante balls and Christmas boutiques through the 1970s. By the late 20th and early 21st centuries, the house hosted events such as luncheons, architectural tours, St. Nicholas Day Festivals, Open House New York events, and Halloween tours. The mansion has also hosted recurring events such as the Friends of Pelham Bay Park&#x27;s autumn galas, Historic House Festivals, and movie nights.

== Impact ==

In the 1880s, the &quot;New-York Tribune&quot; wrote that the mansion &quot;has the solid and substantial appearance of an English country-house&quot;, declaring it to be one of the best country estates in Pelham Bay Park. After the mansion was converted to a clubhouse in 1915, a writer for &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; said that the mansion &quot;will no longer be a reproach to the City of New York&quot;. Another critic wrote for &quot;The Sun&quot; that the house &quot;is full of interest and charm to all who delight in perfectly proportioned rooms, genuine wood carving over doors, beautiful mantels, and the best kind of elegant simplicity&quot;. A 1944 book said that the house &quot;in its completeness, its elegance, and its beauty, is the product of a designer of great skill&quot;. A reporter wrote in 1975 that the ornate and expansive interiors &quot;provided a fitting setting for the life of&quot; its residents.

In 1947, a year after the house was converted into a museum, a writer for &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; said that both the Garden Club and Mrs. Eliot Tuckerman should be credited &quot;for vision and persistence in restoring the beautiful old Bartow Mansion in Pelham Bay Park, not only to usefulness, but to be open to the public&quot;. A critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot; said in 1970 that the house&#x27;s decorative elements, such as the windows, roof, and interiors, contributed to its Greek Revival &quot;grandeur&quot;. A writer from the same newspaper described the mansion as &quot;almost buried treasure&quot; in 1987, while a reporter for the &quot;Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; said in 1984 that it was a &quot;Greek Revival masterpiece&quot;. The &quot;Washington Post&quot; called the house &quot;an exquisite enclave of peace and history, little-known to New Yorkers&quot;. In the 2000s, a &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot; writer described the house and grounds as a &quot;further challenge to the hard-boiled reputation of the Bronx&quot; and a remnant of the borough&#x27;s rural past, while Mimi Sheraton of the &quot;Times&quot; said that the house and gardens were both evidence of its occupants&#x27; luxurious lifestyle and a reminder that none of the other mansions in the area remained.

The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) designated the mansion&#x27;s exterior as a New York City landmark in 1966. The LPC held hearings in 1975 to determine whether the Bartow–Pell Mansion&#x27;s first-floor interior should be designated as a landmark. The LPC designated the interiors of the Bartow–Pell Mansion, Federal Hall&#x27;s rotunda, and the Morris–Jumel Mansion as landmarks on May 26, 1975, and the New York City Board of Estimate ratified these designations that July. The mansion became a National Historic Landmark on December 8, 1976, and the IGC received a &quot;certificate of proof&quot; for the National Historic Landmark designation the next year. The exterior-landmark designation was extended in 1978 to cover the carriage house, gardens, and Pell family graveyard; the expanded designation covers of the park.

<text>Bhimsen Thapa ( (August 1775 – 29 July 1839)) was a Nepalese statesman who served as the &quot;Mukhtiyar&quot; (equivalent to prime minister) and de facto ruler of Nepal from 1806 to 1837. He is widely known as the longest-serving prime minister of Nepal and was inducted into the &quot;National heroes of Nepal&quot; by King Mahendra Bir Bikram Shah.

Born into an ordinary military family in the Gorkha Kingdom, Bhimsen first came close to the Crown Prince Rana Bahadur Shah at an early age in 1785. In 1798, he was recruited as a bodyguard for the King by his father. Thereafter, he rose to influence after helping the exiled ex-King Rana Bahadur Shah engineer his return to power in 1804. In gratitude, Rana Bahadur made Bhimsen a &quot;Kaji&quot; (equivalent to a minister) of the newly formed government. Rana Bahadur&#x27;s assassination by his stepbrother Sher Bahadur Shah in 1806 led Bhimsen to initiate investigations into the context in which he ordered the death penalty for ninety-three people popularly known as the 1806 Bhandarkhal massacre, after which he claimed the title of &quot;Mukhtiyar&quot; (equivalent to prime minister) himself. The death of King Girvan Yuddha Bikram Shah in 1816 at the immature age of 17, with his heir, King Rajendra Bikram Shah being only 3 years old, along with the support from Queen Tripurasundari (the junior queen of Rana Bahadur Shah) allowed him to remain in power even after Nepal&#x27;s defeat in the Anglo-Nepalese War. After the death of Queen Tripurasundari in 1832, the intrigues of the newly adult King Rajendra, the conspiracies and infightings with the British envoy Brian Houghton Hodgson, Senior Queen Samrajya Laxmi Devi and the rival courtiers (especially the Kala Pandes, who held Bhimsen Thapa responsible for the death of Damodar Pande in 1804) finally led to his imprisonment on false charges of the murder of an infant prince and ultimately his death by suicide in 1839.

Bhimsen is remembered for being the first Nepalese statesman to fully comprehend the British system of protectorate in India carried out by Lord Wellesley and his subsequent activities to keep British authorities at bay and prevent the Kingdom of Nepal from being a part of the British Empire through long and persistent anti-British politics during both wartime and peacetime. The territorial expanse of the Gurkha empire had reached its greatest extent from the Sutlej River in the west to the Teesta river in the east during his prime ministership. However, Nepal entered into a disastrous Anglo-Nepalese War with the partially British Empire-owned East India Company lasting from 1814 to 1816, which was concluded with the Treaty of Sugauli, by which Nepal lost almost one-third of its land. He is widely remembered for bringing about a large number of social, religious, economic, and administrative reforms, as well as the modernization of the Nepalese Army on the template of the French military forces. During his lifetime, he commissioned the construction of many temples and monuments including the highly famed Dharahara also known as &quot;Bhimsen Stambha&quot; (&quot;Bhimsen Tower&quot;).

Widely considered one of the 19th century&#x27;s most significant figures in Nepalese history, Bhimsen is seen as a patriotic, clever, and diplomatic statesman who played an important role in defending his country against then-widespread British colonial imperialism in South Asia. His foreign policy was largely motivated by rational national interest, national sustenance and nationalism. He is also well praised as a reformer and for his efficient systematization and management of the state administration, programmes and policies. However, he has been criticized for instigating an inhumane political massacre in his early political career, the elimination of his political rivals and the consolidation of political and military power within his family.

== Early years ==

Bhimsen Thapa was born in August 1775 at Pipal Thok village of Gorkha district, to father Amar Singh Thapa (sanu) and mother Satyarupa Maya. His ancestors were members of Bagale Thapa clan from Jumla who migrated eastwards. His grandfather was Bir Bhadra Thapa, a courtier in Prithvi Narayan Shah&#x27;s army. Bhimsen Thapa had four brothers — Nain Singh, Bakhtawar Singh, Amrit Singh, and Ranbir Singh. From his step-mother, he had two brothers — Ranbam and Ranzawar. While it is not certain when Bhimsen got married, he had three wives with whom he begot one son, that died at an early age in 1796, and three daughters – Lalita Devi, Janak Kumari and Dirgha Kumari. Lack of a son caused him to adopt Sher Jung Thapa, son or grandson of his brother Nain Singh.

Not much detail is known about Bhimsen Thapa&#x27;s early life. At the age of 11, Bhimsen came into contact with the Nepalese Royal Palace when his &quot;Bratabandha&quot; (sacred thread) ceremony was held together with the Crown Prince Rana Bahadur Shah in Gorkha in 1785. In 1798, his father took him to Kathmandu and enrolled him as a bodyguard to the king. In Kathmandu, Bhimsen took up residence at Thapathali, after which he lived in Bagh Durbar near Tundikhel after becoming a &quot;Kaji&quot; (equivalent to a minister).

==Rise to power: 1798–1804==

===Royal household===
The premature death of Pratap Singh Shah (reigned 1775–77), the eldest son of Prithvi Narayan Shah, left a huge power vacuum that remained unfilled, seriously debilitating the emerging Nepalese state. Pratap Singh Shah&#x27;s successor was his son, Rana Bahadur Shah (reigned 1777–99), aged two and one-half years at his accession. The acting regent until 1785 was Queen Rajendra Lakshmi, followed by Bahadur Shah (reigned 1785–94), the second son of Prithvi Narayan Shah. Court life was consumed by rivalry centered on alignments with these two regents rather than on issues of national administration, and it set a bad precedent for future competition among contending regents. The exigencies of Sino-Nepalese War in 1788–92 had forced Bahadur Shah to temporarily take a pro-British stance, which had led to a commercial treaty with the British in 1792.

Meanwhile, Rana Bahadur Shah&#x27;s youth had been spent in pampered luxury. In 1794 Rana Bahadur came of age, and his first act was to re-constitute the government, with his uncle, Bahadur Shah, removed from all official position. In mid-1795, he became infatuated with a Maithili Brahman widow, Kantavati Jha, and married her on the oath of making their illegitimate half-caste son (as per the Hindu law of that time) the heir apparent, by excluding the legitimate heir from his previous marriage. By 1797, his relationship with his uncle, who was living a retired life, and who wanted to seek refuge in China on the pretext of meeting the new emperor, had deteriorated to the extent that he ordered his imprisonment on 19 February 1797 and his subsequent murder on 23 June 1797. Such acts earned Rana Bahadur notoriety both among courtiers and common people, especially among Brahmins.

That same year in 1797, Girvan Yuddha Bikram Shah was born and was hastily declared the crown prince. However, within a year of Girvan&#x27;s birth, Kantavati contracted tuberculosis; and it was advised by physicians that she perform ascetic penances to cure herself. To make sure that Girvan succeeded to the throne while Kantavati was still alive, Rana Bahadur, aged just 23, abdicated in favor of their son on 23 March 1799, placing his first wife, Rajrajeshwori, as the regent. He joined his ailing wife, Kantavati, with his second wife, Subarnaprabha, in ascetic life and started living in Deopatan, donning saffron robes and titling himself Swami Nirgunanda or Nirvanananda. This move was also supported by all the courtiers who were discontented with his wanton and capricious behavior. It was around this time that both Bhimsen Thapa and his father Amar Singh Thapa (sanu) were promoted from &quot;Subedar&quot; to the rank of &quot;Sardar&quot;, and Bhimsen began to serve as the ex-King&#x27;s chief bodyguard. Bhimsen received the position of personal secretary of King Rana Bahadur from the patronage of &quot;Mulkaji&quot; Kirtiman Singh Basnyat, since both his father and grandfather were in close military affiliations with Kaji Abhiman Singh Basnyat - the uncle of Kirtiman Singh. Meanwhile, Rana Bahadur&#x27;s renunciation lasted only a few months. After the inevitable death of Kantavati, Rana Bahadur suffered a mental breakdown during which he lashed out by desecrating temples and cruelly punishing the attendant physicians and astrologers. He then renounced his ascetic life and attempted to re-assert his royal authority. This led to a direct conflict with almost all the courtiers who had pledged a holy oath of allegiance to the legitimate King Girvan; this conflict eventually led to the establishment of a dual government and to an imminent civil war, with Damodar Pande leading the military force against the dissenting ex-King and his group. Since most of the military officers had sided with the courtiers, Rana Bahadur realized that his authority could not be re-established; and he was forced to flee to the British-controlled city of Varanasi in May 1800.

===Exile in Varanasi: 1800–1804===

As Rana Bahadur Shah&#x27;s bodyguard and advisor, Sardar Bhimsen Thapa also accompanied him to Varanasi. Rana Bahadur&#x27;s retinue included his first wife, Raj Rajeshwari Devi, while his second wife, Subarna Prabha Devi, stayed back in Kathmandu to serve as the regent. Since Rana Bahadur was willing to do anything to regain his power and punish those who had forced him to exile, he served as a focal point of dissident factions in Varanasi. In November 1800, he first sought help from the British in exchange for which he was willing to concede a trading post in Kathmandu and grant them 37.5% of the tax revenue derived from the hills and 50% from the Terai. However, the British were in favor of working with the existing government in Nepal, rather than risk the uncertainties of restoring an exiled ex-King to power.

The Kathmandu Durbar was willing to appease the British and agreed to sign a commercial treaty so long as the wayward Rana Bahadur and his group were held in India under strict British surveillance. This arrangement was kept a secret from Rana Bahadur and his group; but when they eventually became aware of the strictures on their movement, and hence the treaty, they were incensed at the British as well as the proponents (Damodar Pande and his faction) of this treaty in Nepal. An intrigue was set in motion with the aim of splitting the unity of courtiers in Kathmandu Durbar and fomenting anti-British feelings. A flurry of letters were exchanged between the ex-King and individual courtiers in which he tried to set them up against Damodar Pande and tried to woo them by promises of high government positions, which they could hold for their entire life, and which could be inherited by their progeny. Baburam Acharya holds Bhimsen responsible for all these schemes, reasoning that Rana Bahadur did not have the mental capacity for such negotiations and intrigues. He contends that Bhimsen was responsible for negotiation with the British as well as responsible for writing letters in the name of the ex-King, while the ex-King was biding his time in debauchery. Similarly, historian Chittaranjan Nepali considered that in addition to the realization of the motive of Nepali Bharadars to detain Rana Bahadur&#x27;s retinue in Banaras, Bhimsen also had fully realized the real meaning of the system of protectorates adopted by the East India Company Government.

Meanwhile, Rajrajeshwari, perhaps due to frustration over her debauched husband, or due to political reasons, left Varanasi, crossed the border of Nepal on 26 July 1801, and taking advantage of the weak regency, was slowly making her way towards Kathmandu with the view of taking over the regency. Back in Kathmandu, the court politics turned complicated when &quot;Mulkaji&quot; (or chief minister) Kirtiman Singh Basnyat, a favorite of the Regent Subarnaprabha, was secretly assassinated on 28 September 1801, by the supporters of Rajrajeswori. In the resulting confusion, many courtiers were jailed, while some executed, based solely on rumors. Bakhtawar Singh Basnyat, brother of assassinated Kirtiman Singh, was then given the post of &quot;Mulkaji&quot; During his tenure as the &quot;Mulkaji&quot;, on 28 October 1801, a Treaty of Commerce and Alliance was finally signed between Nepal and East India Company. This led to the establishment of the first British Resident, Captain William O. Knox, who was reluctantly welcomed by the courtiers in Kathmandu on 16 April 1802. The primary objective of Knox&#x27;s mission was to bring the trade treaty of 1792 into full effect and to establish a &quot;controlling influence&quot; in Nepali politics. Almost eight months after the establishment of the Residency, Rajrajeshwari finally managed to assume the regency on 17 December 1802.

===Return to Kathmandu===

After Rajrajeshwori took over the regency, she was pressured by Knox to pay the annual pension of 82,000 rupees to the ex-King as per the obligations of the treaty, which paid off the vast debt that Rana Bahadur Shah had accumulated in Varanasi due to his spendthrift habits. The Nepalese court also felt it prudent to keep Rana Bahadur in isolation in Nepal itself, rather than in the British controlled India, and that paying off Rana Bahadur&#x27;s debts could facilitate his return at an opportune moment. Rajrajeshwari&#x27;s presence in Kathmandu also stirred unrest among the courtiers that aligned themselves around her and Subarnaprabha. Sensing an imminent hostility, Knox aligned himself with Subarnaprabha and attempted to interfere with the internal politics of Nepal. Getting a wind of this matter, Rajrajeshwari dissolved the government and elected new ministers, with Damodar Pande as the &quot;Mulkaji&quot;, while the Resident Knox, finding himself persona non grata and the objectives of his mission frustrated, voluntarily left Kathmandu to reside in Makwanpur citing a cholera epidemic. Subarnaprabha and the members of her faction were arrested.

Such open display of anti-British feelings and humiliation prompted the Governor General of the time Richard Wellesley to recall Knox to India and unilaterally suspend the diplomatic ties. The Treaty of 1801 was also unilaterally annulled by the British on 24 January 1804. The suspension of diplomatic ties also gave the Governor General a pretext to allow the ex-King Rana Bahadur to return to Nepal unconditionally.

As soon as they received the news, Rana Bahadur and his group proceeded towards Kathmandu. Some troops were sent by Kathmandu Durbar to check their progress, but the troops changed their allegiance when they came face to face with the ex-King. Damodar Pande and his men were arrested at Thankot where they were waiting to greet the ex-King with state honors and take him into isolation. After Rana Bahadur&#x27;s reinstatement to power, he started to extract vengeance on those who had tried to keep him in exile. He exiled Rajrajeshwari to Helambu, where she became a Buddhist nun, on the charge of siding with Damodar Pande and colluding with the British. Damodar Pande, along with his two eldest sons, who were completely innocent, was executed on 13 March 1804; similarly some members of his faction were tortured and executed without any due trial, while many others managed to escape to India. Rana Bahadur also punished those who did not help him while in exile. Among them was Prithvi Pal Sen, the king of Palpa, who was tricked into imprisonment, while his kingdom forcefully annexed. Subarnaprabha and her supporters were released and given a general pardon. Those who had helped Rana Bahadur to return to Kathmandu were lavished with rank, land, and wealth. Bhimsen Thapa was made a second &quot;kaji&quot;; Ranajit Pande, who was the father-in-law of Bhimsen&#x27;s brother, was made the &quot;Mulkaji&quot;; Sher Bahadur Shah, Rana Bahadur&#x27;s half-brother, was made the &quot;Mul Chautariya&quot;; while Ranga Nath Paudel was made the &quot;Raj Guru&quot; (royal spiritual preceptor).

==As &quot;Kaji&quot;: 1804–1806==

===Expansion in the West ===

By the time Bhimsen came to power, the territory of Nepal extended up to the border of Garhwal in the west. During the reign of Bahadur Shah, Nepal had concluded a treaty with Garhwal demanding that it pay NRs. 9,000 per year. Later Rana Bahadur Shah reduced it to NRs. 3,000. However, in 1804, Garhwal refused to pay the amount upon which Bhimsen sent an army under the command of &quot;Bada Kaji&quot; Amar Singh Thapa (not to be confused with his father), Bhakti Thapa and Hasti Dal Shah to attack Garhwal and in the Battle of Khurbura in May 1804, the huge 12000 Garhwali troops fled the war after their King Pradyumna Shah was shot dead by Kaji Ranajit Kunwar, thus extending the territory of Nepal up to the Sutlej river in the west. As the Nepalese army were preparing for the Kangra campaign in September 1805, military desertion increased; as a result, Bhimsen ordered his brother Nain Singh to arrest such military deserters.

===&quot;Baisathi Haran&quot;===
After the power shuffle, in 1805, Bhimsen became the architect of an unpopular plan of seizing all the tax free land granted to temple &quot;guthis&quot; and as &quot;birta&quot; to Brahmin priests in order to fill the empty state coffers. The objective was to scrutinize the cases in which tax-exempt lands had been used without valid documentary proof of land grant by a benefactor; owners with valid evidence or owners who could take an oath of validity were not affected. The money was spent in financing the military campaigns in the far west in Jamuna-Sutlej region. This was a very radical reform in the staunchly religious society of the time and became known as &quot;Baisathi Haran&quot; in the Nepalese history.

===Bhandarkhal massacre of 1806===

After returning to Kathmandu, in complicity with Rana Bahadur, Bhimsen indulged in appropriating the palaces and properties of deposed members of Shah family, which he shared between himself and his supporter Rangnath Paudel. This aroused resentment and jealousy among Sher Bahadur Shah (Rana Bahadur&#x27;s step-brother) and his faction since they did not receive any portion of this confiscated property, despite their help in reinstating Rana Bahadur to power. They were also wary of Bhimsen&#x27;s growing power. By this time, Rana Bahadur was a nominal figure and &quot;Kaji&quot; Bhimsen Thapa was single-handedly controlling the central administration of the country, being able to implement even unpopular reforms like &quot;Baisathi Haran&quot;.

Bhimsen felt the need to finish off his rivals, but at the same time, felt a need to take precaution before going after immediate members of the royal household. For almost two years after returning to Kathmandu, Rana Bahadur had no official position in the government – he was neither a king, nor a regent, nor a minister – yet he felt no qualms in using the full state power. Not only did Rana Bahadur carry out the &quot;Baisathi Haran&quot; under Bhimsen&#x27;s advice, he was also able to banish all non-vaccinated children, as well as their parents, from the town during a smallpox outbreak, in order to prevent King Girvan from catching that disease. Now, after almost two-year, all of a sudden Rana Bahadur was made &quot;Mukhtiyar&quot; (chief authority) on 26 February 1806 and Bhimsen tried to implement his schemes through Rana Bahadur. Bhimsen had also secretly learned of a plot to oust Rana Bahadur. Tribhuvan Khawas (Pradhan), a member of Sher Bahadur&#x27;s faction, was imprisoned on the re-opened charges of conspiracy with the British that led to the Knox&#x27;s mission, but for which pardon had already been doled out, and was ordered to be executed. Tribhuvan Khawas decided to reveal everyone that was involved in the dialogue with the British. Among those implicated was Sher Bahadur Shah.
On the night of 25 April 1806, Rana Bahadur held a meeting at Tribhuvan Khawas&#x27;s house with rest of the courtiers, during which he taunted and threatened to execute Sher Bahadur. At around 10 pm, Sher Bahadur in desperation drew a sword and killed Rana Bahadur Shah before being cut down by nearby courtiers, Bam Shah and Bal Narsingh Kunwar, also allies of Bhimsen. The assassination of Rana Bahadur Shah triggered a great massacre in Bhandarkhal (a royal garden east of Kathmandu Durbar) and at the bank of Bishnumati river. That very night members of Sher Bahadur&#x27;s faction – Bidur Shah, Tribhuvan Khawas, and Narsingh Gurung – and even King Prithvipal Sen of Palpa, who was under house arrest in Patan Durbar, were swiftly rounded up and killed in Bhandarkhal. Their dead bodies were not allowed funeral rites and were dragged and thrown by the banks of Bishnumati to be eaten by vultures and jackals. The next few days, all the sons of Sher Bahadur Shah, Bidur Shah, Tribhuvan Khawas and Narsingh Gurung, aged 2 to 15 were beheaded by the bank of Bishnumati; their wives and daughters were given to the untouchables, their bodyguards and servants were also put to death, and all their property seized. Bhimsen managed to kill everyone who did not agree with him or anyone who could potentially become a problem for him in the future. In this massacre that lasted for about two weeks, a total of ninety-three people (16 women and 77 men) lost their lives.
Almost one and half months before the massacre, upon Bhimsen&#x27;s insistence, Rana Bahadur, then 31 years old, had married a 14-year-old girl named Tripurasundari on 7 March 1806, making her his fifth legitimate wife. Taking advantage of the political chaos, Bhimsen became the &quot;Mukhtiyar&quot; (1806–37), and Tripurasundari was given the title Lalita Tripurasundari and declared regent and Queen Mother (1806–32) of Girvan Yuddha Bikram Shah, who was himself 9 years old. Thus, Bhimsen became the first person outside the royal household to hold the position of the &quot;Mukhtiyar&quot;. All the other wives (except Subarnaprabha) and concubines of Rana Bahadur, along with their handmaidens, were forced to commit sati. Bhimsen obtained a royal mandate from Tripurasundari, given in the name of King Girvan, commanding all other courtiers to be obedient to him. Bhimsen further consolidated his power by disenfranchising the old courtiers from the central power by placing them as administrators of far-flung provinces of the country. The courtiers were instead replaced by his close relatives, who were mere yes-men. On the spot where Rana Bahadur Shah drew his last breath, Bhimsen later built a commemorative Shiva temple by the name Rana-Mukteshwar.

==As &quot;Mukhtiyar&quot; (Premiership): 1806–1832==

===Expansion in the West (Continued)===

Bhimsen previously ordered the conquest of the Garhwal Kingdom and the preparations of the Kangra campaign. Gorkhali forces under Badakaji Amar Singh, Rudrabir Shah and Nain Singh overran Nalagarh, crossed the Sutlej river and defeated King Sansar Chand of Kangra at Mahal Mori in May 1806. Unfortunately, Bhimsen lost his brother Nain Singh who was shot dead at the conquest of the Kangra fort in the winter of 1806–07. Afterwards in 1807, it was put under Nepalese siege and by early 1809, most of the land of Kangra &quot;jagir&quot; had been incorporated into Nepal, although the fort was still held out. Sansar Chand took refuge among the Sikhs of Punjab and by August 1809, the Nepalese army was forced to retreat back by the combined army of Sansar Chand and Ranjit Singh, the ruler of Punjab. Other states like Salyan were also annexed to Nepal during his rule. Before the Anglo-Nepalese War, the territory of Nepal extended from Sutlej river in the west to Teesta river in the east. Most of this territory, however, was lost in the Anglo-Nepalese War. In 1811, Bhimsen was given the title of &quot;General&quot;, thus enjoying a dual position of &quot;Mukhtiyar&quot; and General.

===Anglo-Nepalese War: 1814–1816===

The Anglo–Nepalese War (1814–1816), sometimes called the Gorkha War, was fought between Nepal and the British Empire owned East India Company as a result of border tensions, trade dispute, and ambitious expansionism of both the belligerent parties. The hostility between the two parties had been brewing for more than a decade since the failure of Knox&#x27;s mission. Bhimsen had installed his own father Amar Singh Thapa as the governor of Palpa, leading to a serious border disputes with the British East India Company. The border dispute with the British on the frontier of Butwal, Terai, was the immediate reason which led to the Anglo-Nepalese War in 1814. The British had been striving to annex the hill regions of Nepal and were responsible for creating border disputes. At the border demarcation, the British representative Major Bradshaw disrespected the Nepalese representatives – Rajguru Ranganath Poudyal and Kaji Dalabhanjan Pande, with a view of invoking a war against the Nepalese. This war was the most important event during the &quot;Mukhtiyari&quot; (Mukhtiyarship) of Bhimsen Thapa since it affected every aspect of the later course of Nepalese history. Considering the many successes that the Nepalese army had seen during the expansion campaign of Nepal, Bhimsen Thapa on the Nepalese side was one of the main proponents of the war with the British, which was against the better advice of the likes of &quot;Bada Kaji&quot; Amar Singh Thapa, who actually did the fighting and knew about the hardships of war. Among those high ranked ministers and commanders who supported the war was Kaji Dalabhanjan, while among those who opposed the war was Kaji Amar Singh (Bada), Rajguru Ranga Nath, Kaji Ranadhoj Thapa, Chautaria Bam Shah and Chautaria Hastidal Shah. Bhimsen&#x27;s attitude before the war is summarized in the following reply to King Girvan which depicts his strong belief on the Nepalese strategic military advantage:


Kaji Ranadhoj Thapa also agreed with Bhimsen&#x27;s reply regarding the Nepalese strategic military advantage over British in the hills but counterargued that the expelled hill Rajas will unite against the Gorkha Empire and disclose the confidentiality of the hills to the British. Similarly, Kaji Amar Singh (Bada) also opined that hill Rajas will defect to the British side. Based on intelligence reports, Bhimsen predicted that the first point of British attack would be the Doon area, which later proved to be correct. The British launched two successive waves of invasion campaigns. The Nepalese army was commanded largely by the members and relatives of the larger Thapa caucus that includes the Thapa dynasty and Family of Amar Singh Thapa. During the war, Bhimsen tried to form a coalition with Ranjit Singh of Sikh Empire and Daulat Rao Scindia of Gwalior State and launch a collective war against the British; thus opening multiple geographical frontiers of combat. Both rulers did not wish to see the Nepalese lose; however, they also did not want to commit themselves to the losing side. The war ended with the signing of the Treaty of Sugauli in 1816, which ceded around one-third of Nepal&#x27;s territory to the British. Furthermore, according to the treaty, Nepal had to agree that accredited Ministers from each shall reside at the Court of the other to secure and improve the relations of amity and peace between the two States. During the war, Bhimsen Thapa served as the Commander-in-Chief of the Nepalese army; and thus he had to bear the direct responsibility of Nepalese defeat.

===Hold on power===

In May 1816, Edward Gardner arrived in Kathmandu as the first British Resident after the conclusion of the Treaty of Sugauli. Bhimsen used all his influence to cultivate peace, although not friendliness, with the British, &quot;a Power,&quot; as he said, &quot;that crushed thrones like potsherds.&quot; His foreign policy after the war was essentially the one handed down by Prithvi Narayan Shah – to keep Nepal isolated from any foreign influences. As such, although he was forced to accept a British resident in Kathmandu as per the Treaty of Sugauli, he made sure to cut off the resident from all contacts with life in Nepal to the point of making the Resident a virtual prisoner. Apart from petty harassment, the Resident was only allowed to travel within the Kathmandu valley, that too only with special escorts. The resident was also barred from meeting the king or any courtiers at will. Thus the threat of having a Resident in Kathmandu was not as keen as had been anticipated. Later British Resident Hodgson also remarked how the British couldn&#x27;t capitalize the 1816 war victory over Nepal where he opined that the British should have either &quot;crippled them [Nepal] effectually&quot; or force Nepal in &quot;giving surplus soldiery employment&quot; to the British armies.

On 20 November 1816, King Girvan Yuddha died of smallpox, aged nineteen. Girvan had two wives – the first wife committed sati with Girvan, while the second wife also died of smallpox after 14 days of Girvan&#x27;s death. Thus, Girvan was succeeded by his only son, Rajendra Bikram Shah, an infant of two years old, after 18 days of his father&#x27;s death on 8 December 1816. Therefore, Bhimsen Thapa, in collusion with the queen regent, Tripurasundari, remained in power despite the defeat of Nepal in the Anglo-Nepalese War of 1814–16. There was a sustained opposition against Bhimsen from factions centered around leading members of other aristocratic families, notably the Pandes, who denounced what they felt was his cowardly submission to the British. Paradoxically, the peacetime after the Anglo-Nepalese War saw the inflation and modernization of the Nepal army, which Bhimsen used to keep his opposition under control, while at the same time convincing the suspicious British that he had no intention of using it against them. Bhimsen appointed his own family members and his most trusted men to the highest positions at the court and in the army, while members of older aristocratic families were made administrators of far-flung provinces of the kingdom, away from the capital.

Thus, Bhimsen was able to continue making all the administrative decisions of the country, while the Regent Queen Tripurasundari would unquestioningly approve these decisions by stamping the royal seal issued in the name of King Rajendra on these government orders. The Regent never dared to express any doubts regarding Bhimsen&#x27;s decisions. Nevertheless, to make sure that the King, his wives – Samrajya Laxmi Devi (senior) and Rajya Lakshmi Devi (junior) – and the Regent were insulated from influences of people other than Bhimsen and his closest relatives, Bhimsen had instated his youngest brother, Ranvir Singh Thapa, in the royal palace to keep a watch on the royal family and to keep guard against any outside person. Any priest or courtier who wished to be granted an interview with the King, the Queens, or the Regent, had to get approval from Ranbir Singh and the interview had to be conducted under his watchful presence. Similarly, the royal family was not allowed to leave the palace without Bhimsen&#x27;s permission either. Bhimsen had also neglected the formal education of Rajendra, due to which he had grown to be uncritical and weak minded to the extent that he was even unaware that he was virtually a prisoner. However, his wives were more alert and wary of Bhimsen since, according to Baburam Acharya, they received unfiltered news of the world outside the royal palace from their handmaidens, who would leave the palace compounds and go to their homes during their menstruation and gather news and rumors of the day, which they would then relate to the Queens.

===Tussles with Samar Jung Company===
After the Bhandarkhal Massacre of 1806, Bhimsen was put in charge of the &quot;Samar Jung Company&quot;, which was established in 1796 as the royal palace guard unit and camped inside the palace compound itself, whose command was later handed over to his brother Bakhtawar Singh This position allowed Bakhtawar to gain the confidence of both King Girvan and the Regent Queen Tripurasundari. After the end of the Anglo-Nepalese War, Bakhtawar was suspected by Bhimsen of playing anti-Mukhtiyar politics and of joining the opposing court factions. At the time, Bakhtawar was living in joint family with his brother, without the division of their ancestral property. After the conclusion of a treaty with the British to hand over some of the annexed land in Tarai back to Nepal, Bhimsen turned his attention to address Bakhtawar Singh&#x27;s influence over the royalty. However, their mother pleaded only a light punishment for Bakhtawar. Thus, he was dismissed from his position and imprisoned in Nuwakot. This move was highly unpopular among the personnel of the Samar Jung Company. As such, Bhimsen had the Samar Jung Company removed from its position of royal palace guard. Some of the officers and soldiers of the Samar Jung Company were imprisoned, while the remaining personnel were assigned guard duties in common jails as well as monitoring of road construction by convicts. As a further punishment, the Mukhtiyar cancelled their holidays on Saturday, whereas all other companies enjoyed such benefit. Their &quot;Devata&quot; flag carried by &quot;Nishan&quot; flag-bearers were also treated with indignity.

===Policies and reforms===
British Historian Henry Ambrose Oldfield contended that Bhimsen strengthened Nepal back to the pre-British war position through the adoption of militarization, financial and economic policies.
====Defence policy====
=====Militarization=====

Bhimsen implemented the reorganization of Nepalese Army on the basis of European military system and the maintenance of the newly reorganized strong army was done from the confiscation of &quot;Birta&quot; funds of 1805. He appointed French military officials to modernize the military on the basis of French military ranks and uniforms. Military jobs were made attractive by increasing facilities including &quot;Jhara&quot; (porter) facility even in the peacetime under his &quot;Mukhtiyari&quot;. Due to extensive lack of labour forces in the country, he issued legal obligations to all adult males of all castes to provide compulsory labour to the state subject to royal exemptions. Those state jobs included construction and maintenance of forts, bridges, roads, and production of ammunition for military expeditions. 
=====Passport policy=====
Bhimsen considered Churia hills as the basic line of defense of the Kingdom of Nepal. He thus wanted to build communications to the western parts such as Kumaon, Garhwal and Yamuna-Sutlej region of Kingdom of Nepal and block the strategic routes to the Kathmandu valley. The possessions of passers-by were strictly searched and even private letters were censored. Such was implemented to prevent outflow of secret information of Nepal to British Company government. Passport system was introduced to check the access to the capital city with officials appointed on the Churai routes with instructions as follows: 

====Trade and economic policies====
The trade policy of Bhimsen Thapa was influenced from King Prithvi Narayan Shah who believed foreign (in the context English) traders would weaken the economy of the country and impoverish the general people. Customs offices were relocated within the country to reduce discomfort to native traders. Essential arrangements and facilities were provided to native traders and officials were warned not to intimidate native traders. Bhimsen is quoted to have said: He brought forth the increment of custom duties leading to higher state revenue generation from eighty thousand rupees in 1816 to two and half lakh rupees (NPR 250,000) in 1833. After 1807, markets were opened in the Terai and Inner Terai under direct governmental efforts and supervision to facilitate native traders. For instances; in 1809, market towns were made at Hitaruwa in Makawanpur and at Bhadaruwa in Saptari. Indian traders were also encouraged to trade within the country and Nepalese officials were instructed to take care of the development of border markets, land reclamation and settlement, and protection of land encroachment. In 1811, timber exports from Chitwan to Calcutta were introduced together with the diversification of agricultural products to strengthen the export. Also, mining and minting coins were undertaken by the Bhimsen government.

====Judicial reforms====
Bhimsen put forth the principle of Equality before the law in Nepal. In 1826, a regulation was issued by him through &quot;Lalmohar&quot; (Red Seal) of Maharaja directing Kaji Dalbhanjan Pande to maintain the sanctity of judiciary and it further stated:
 &quot;Mohi&quot; (tenant farmers) felt it easier to pay taxes in kind to their Zamindars due to cash shortage. He directed the Zamindars to accept foodgrain as tax and not to harass the farmers. The regulation further directed that it was the responsibility of Zamindars to make arrangements for cash and not of the farmers. The anti-bribery regulations were issued due to reports of Zamindars, Amalis, and regional officials taking up bribery from people in the far-flung provinces. Bhimsen through his regulations declared it illegal to give or take any form of bribes or gifts from people. Merchants at Ridi in 1829 and Tansen in 1830 lost their thatched shopping houses to fire. The affected merchants demanded individual rights on property and allowance of building concrete shopping houses. He accepted the merchants&#x27; proposal of building concrete shopping houses and allowed individual rights on the property. Due to long ongoing unification campaigns of Nepal, there was anarchy in Nepalese administration before Bhimsen&#x27;s Mukhtiyari. In Achham Province, Zamindars, Amalis, and traders perpetrated great injustice to farmers by increasing heavy interest on loans, to which farmers revolted. Bhimsen being moved by the plight of the victims issued &quot;Lalmohar&quot; with binding instructions to write off outstanding dues at once.

====Slavery reforms====
In 1807 dealing with slavery, the government of Bhimsen directed revenue officials to collect outstanding taxes and fines in terms of cash and ordered the freedom of all enslaved farmers in case of defaulting taxes and no farmer would be enslaved for non-payment of taxes. In 1812, he imposed a general restriction on human trafficking in Garhwal Sirmur and other areas. The children of debtors were acquired by the traders against the accumulated interest of the loans and were sold on profit. The feudal lords did not allow them legal facilities and considered slaves as non-human. Bhimsen challenged the widespread notion of inhuman treatment of slaves. In 1830, Bhimsen having introduced anti-slavery regulations beforehand in 1807, restricted all of the Danuwar traders in Western Nepal to acquire and sell &quot;Kariya&quot; slaves and also freed slaves from the custody of their owner. The regulation was targeted to provide legal rights to slaves and boost their morale. Six years afterward, he restricted ban on sales of children prevalent among Magar community of Marsyangdi and Western Pyuthan. The slave trading was made illegal on various parts of Nepal by Bhimsen. It was considered one of the greatest achievement in the history on comparison to their British counterparts. Wilberforce in England was obtaining the public mandate against it while one of the most powerful Prime Minister in the world (in the 1800s) – William Pitt was hesitant to outlaw the slave trading.

====Socio-religious reforms====
The socio-religious customs like birth and death ceremonies among Newar community was leading to indebtedness. The priests took up huge ceremonial fees and failure to adhere to such customs led people to excommunication in the Newar society. In 1830–31, Bhimsen by issuing &quot;Lalmohar&quot;, a regulation was introduced with a limit of ceremonial fees and the amount of expenditure was restricted.

====Land management reforms====
Around 1808, Bhimsen ordered the reclamation of wastelands in Terai region for increasing state revenue and offered irrigation facilities to settlers reclaiming the wastelands. In places where there was a lack of tenants, farmers were allocated the wastelands with tax exemption and loan was provided for new incoming settlers. The wastelands reclamation policy was largely advantageous to the government and tenants, and was greatly successful in Eastern Terai. For the coordination of this policy, officials were appointed all over the state in 1811.

====Postal reforms====
&quot;Hulaki&quot; (postal) system from Kathmandu to the western front was implemented in 1804 through rotational relays of porters. In 1808 during the premiership of Bhimsen, it was reported that minors were engaged in Hulaki services in the villages with small Hulaki households. The regulation issued by Bhimsen&#x27;s government was to increase the number of relays in the villages consisting low Hulaki households and person forcing minors and females for personal Hulaki services would be severely punished. These Jhara (porter) services for Hulaki system were regularly required due to which some were compensated with land under &quot;Adhiya&quot; (half-ownership) tenure and others in the form of cash wages compensation. Regulations issued in July 1809 was:
====Foreign policy====
Bhimsen was widely known to have resorted to a negative political stance against the British imperialism throughout his life. He was an advocate of &quot;Asian Unity&quot; against the British Imperialism. He issued restrictions on the British Resident refraining him to interfere on the national politics and national administration, and prohibited the Resident maintaining any secret relationship with Nepalese citizens. He worked to reduce the British Resident to a mere ambassador of a friendly state. He viewed the British Residents as disturbances in the local administration, who would encourage factional fightings with a motive to colonize such factional chaos ridden states. He also had fully realized the main motive of the system of protectorates adopted by the East India Company Government. In this context, German philosopher and historian Karl Marx quoted that
 British historian William Hunter also remarked about his comprehension of British system of protectorate. Historian Nayaraj Panta considered that Bhimsen&#x27;s action to suppress British influences on Nepal and strengthening of Nepalese military forces was important to save the fate of the only Hindu Kingdom in the world. British Resident Hodgson on his 19 December 1833 report lauded how Bhimsen successfully defied the British colonial powers that succeeded over all of India:
After the 1816 war, Bhimsen had been preventing direct communications between the British Residents and the King, which Resident Brian Houghton Hodgson had reacted negatively. On his report dated 18 February 1833 to Governor General of India, Resident Hodgson wrote:
===Heritages built===
In 1811, he built the bridge at Thapathali over Bagmati River connecting strategically significant cities; Kathmandu and Patan. In 1825, he built the famous Dharahara Tower on the orders of then reigning Queen Tripurasundari of Nepal. Beforehand, he had already built the taller antecedent of Dharahara for himself in 1824. The taller Dharahara collapsed in the 1833 Nepal earthquake and was never repaired. The smaller Dharahara had 11 storeys before 1934 Nepal earthquake reduced it to two storeys. The original Dharahara Tower built by Bhimsen was 225 feet tall and was completely destroyed in the 2015 Nepal earthquake. It was recognized by UNESCO. Dharahara is considered as majestic and nationalistic legacy of Bhimsen. The feat of completing twin Dharahara towers by Bhimsen in a span of two years was considered a unique architectural achievement.

In 1811, he also constructed Bagh Durbar after being appointed General reside near to Basantapur Palace. He initially moved from Gorkha district to Thapathali Durbar and further to Bagh Durbar. It had a spacious &quot;Janarala Bag&quot; (General&#x27;s Garden), pond and many temples glorifying the Mukhtiyar General. Later when Thapa rule was revived again, Mathabar Singh recaptured the lost palace and began to reside for two more years. The National Museum of Nepal at Chhauni was once a residence of Bhimsen. The building has collection of bronze sculptures, paubha paintings and weapons including the sword gifted by the Emperor of the French Napoleon Bonaparte.

==Infighting==
===Reasons===
The Gorkha aristocracy had led Nepal into a disaster on the international front but preserved the political unity of the country, which at the end of the Anglo-Nepalese War in 1816 still was only about twenty-five years old as a unified nation. The success of the central government rested in part on its ability to appoint and control regional administrators, who also were high officers in the army. In theory, these officials had great local powers; in practice they spent little energy on the daily affairs of their subjects, interfering only when communities could not cope with problems or conflicts. Another reason for Gorkha success in uniting the country was the willingness to placate local leaders by preserving areas where former kings and communal assemblies continued to rule under the loose supervision of Kathmandu, leaving substantial parts of the country out of the control of regional administrators. Even within the areas directly administered by the central government, agricultural lands were given away as &quot;jagir&quot; to the armed services and as &quot;birta&quot; to court favorites and retired servicemen. The holder of such grants in effect became the lord of the peasants working there, with little if any state interference. From the standpoint of the average cultivator, the government remained a distant force, and the main authority figure was the landlord, who took part of the harvest, or (especially in the Tarai) the tax collector, who was often a private individual contracted to extort money or crops in return for a share. For the leaders in the administration and the army, as military options became limited and alternative sources of employment grew very slowly, career advancement depended less on attention to local conditions than on loyalty to factions fighting at court.

===Actors===
Five leading families or factions contended for power during this period—the Shahs, Thapas, Basnyats, Pandes, and the Chautariyas, who were of Shah dynasty but acted as counselors for the King. Working for these families and their factions were hill Brahmans, who acted as religious preceptors or astrologers, and Newars, who occupied secondary administrative positions. No one else in the country had any influence on the central government. When a family or faction achieved power, it killed, exiled, or demoted members of opposing alliances. Under these circumstances, there was little opportunity for either public political life or coordinated economic development.

===Consequences===
The struggle for power at the court had unfortunate consequences for both foreign affairs and for internal administration. All parties tried to satisfy the army in order to avoid interference in court affairs by leading commanders, and the military was given a free hand to pursue ever-larger conquests. As long as the Gorkhas were invading disunited hill states, this policy—or lack of policy—was adequate. Inevitably, continued aggression led Nepal into disastrous collisions with the Chinese and then with the British. At home, because power struggles centered on control of the king, there was little progress in sorting out procedures for sharing power or expanding representative institutions. A consultative body of nobles, a royal court called the Assembly of Lords (Bharadari Sabha), was in place after 1770 and it had substantial involvement in major policy issues. The assembly consisted of high government officials and leading courtiers, all heads of important Gorkha families. In the intense atmosphere surrounding the monarch, however, the Assembly of Lords broke into factions that fought for access to the prime minister or regent, and alliances developed around patron/client relationships.

==Downfall: 1832–1838==
===Death of Queen Tripurasundari and family intrigues===

The power balance began to change after King Rajendra came of age and his grandmother, Tripurasundari, died on 26 March 1832 due to cholera. Bhimsen lost his main support and the court became a stage for a power struggle, which even though started off as an attempt to assert the King&#x27;s authority from the &quot;Mukhtiyar&quot;, spread to various aristocratic clans and their attempt to secure total authority. King Rajendra was frivolous and mostly indulged in pleasure, so, he still feared the &quot;Mukhtiyar&quot; and the Thapa faction as &quot;...a race of men who for the last fifty-five years have dragged the country and its princes at the wheels of military car.&quot; It was no secret that Bhimsen was able to maintain his supremacy due to the large standing army under his and his family&#x27;s command; and in the subsequent years, different factions would attempt to increase their influence based on the strength of the number of battalions under their grip. After Tripurasundari&#x27;s death, the royal seal by which government orders were approved naturally went into the hands of the senior queen Samrajya Laxmi, who knew all too well of its powers and wanted to emulate the queens of the past by establishing her own regency. In 1833, Bhimsen established a new battalion &quot;Singha Nath&quot; under the command of his nephew Mathabar Singh.
Sensing Samrajya Laxmi&#x27;s ambition, Ranbir Singh started to stroke her dislike of Bhimsen in the hopes of becoming the &quot;Mukhtiyar&quot; himself. Mathabar Singh, who had enjoyed an ardent support from the military, strongly supported Bhimsen to check Ranbir Singh&#x27;s aspirations. A quarrel occurred between Mathabar Singh and Ranbir Singh regarding the latter&#x27;s shift of loyalty towards the Senior Queen Samrajya Lakshmi, resulting in Mathabar Singh resigning from the command of Sri Nath Regiment Historian Hunter remarked that Mathabar Singh resigned from two battalions after getting moderations from Ranbir Singh in 1834, to which all the soldiers of both battalions except 200 troops, &quot;laid down their arms&quot; in protest and declined to serve under any other officers; the frightened King harmonized the situation by appointing Mathabar Singh as General Commander of the Eastern districts with 3000 troops under his command in November 1834. Getting a whiff of Ranbir Singh&#x27;s ambitions, Bhimsen strongly reprimanded Ranbir Singh which caused him to resign from his position and live in retirement in his house at Sipamandan. However, Bhimsen later managed to placate his brother, by giving him the title of Chota (Little) General, and send him to Palpa as its governor. To counter the opposition arising in Darbar after the incident, he appointed young Kaji Surath Singh Thapa, a grandson of Bada Kaji Amar Singh Thapa to a very high administrative position in the Darbar and made him joint chief signatory. Since he could find nobody that he could trust to keep watch over the royal palace, Bhimsen from then on started to live in an ordinary rented house located near the palace premise.

===Moderation by royals===

The King and the Queens also started to openly challenge Bhimsen&#x27;s authority. By this time, Rajendra and his wives had heard the widespread rumor that Bhimsen, in order to remain in power, had killed the late King Girvan and his wives by administering poison a few days after Girvan&#x27;s coming off age. So when Rajendra was afflicted by an ordinary illness, the Queens cautioned the King and prohibited him to take the medicine offered by the royal physician, Sardar Ekdev Upadhyay, who was loyal to Bhimsen. Similarly, during the annual muster of 1833, during which the civil and military officers were promoted, renewed, retained, or retired, everything was conducted according to Bhimsen&#x27;s plan, but Rajendra delayed the retainment of Bhimsen&#x27;s own position as the &quot;Mukhtiyar&quot;.

This forced Bhimsen to share the administrative burden between Rajendra, Samrajya Laxmi, and himself, and ask for their opinions on administrative matters, in order to reduce further friction between himself and the royalty. Rajendra was put in charge of defense, finance, and foreign relations; while Samrajya Laxmi was put in charge of justice, accountancy, and civil administration. Nevertheless, Rajendra&#x27;s activities were heavily influenced by the advice of Samrajya Laxmi, while the Junior Queen Rajya Laxmi had no say in any matter; furthermore, the King and the Senior Queen did not dare yet to outright dismiss Bhimsen&#x27;s plans and advice, fearful of the large army under his command. This arrangement worked well for the next three years; for instance, on 26 August 1833, Nepal was struck by a great earthquake, and all three power holders were able to coordinate with each other and provide emergency relief to the citizens.

===Provocation by the frustrated Senior Queen===
Queen Samrajya Laxmi was ambitious to show herself as powerful and as independent as her predecessor Queen Tripurasundari. Initially, King Rajendra supported Bhimsen instead of Ranbir Singh and the removal of Ranabir Singh sabotaged the Queen&#x27;s plan. King Rajendra appointed Bhimsen to the post of Commander-In-Chief and praised Bhimsen for his long service to the nation. However, Queen Samrajya Laxmi would harass King Rajendra by such words as:

Queen Samrajya Laxmi was very frustrated by King Rajendra&#x27;s failure to remove Bhimsen from power. On 8 November 1835, she caused a turmoil by leaving the Durbar at midnight, angered by King Rajendra&#x27;s inability to stop Bhimsen from dealings with the Governor General, with whom she felt the King should be directly dealing with. Meanwhile, she demanded the King to establish a new regiment; however the King failed to obtain the required financial allocation from the &quot;Mukhtiyar&quot;. Instead, King Rajendra authorized Bhimsen with a &quot;Sunnad&quot; in favour of the &quot;Mukhtiyar&quot;. Upon learning this, the Queen Samrajya Laxmi shouted angrily at King Rajendra:

She also demanded an allocation of Rs. 50,000 for her children from the Terai revenues. If her demands were not to be met, she threatened to part from the state affairs. However, despite all her efforts to pressurize King Rajendra, she achieved no success.

=== Rivalry with British envoy and libel against Bhimsen by Hodgson===

In 1833, Brian Hodgson, who had spent many years in Nepal serving as the Assistant Resident, and who had a good knowledge about Nepal&#x27;s biodiversity, culture, and politics, became the new British Resident. Bhimsen had known the motives of British colonial policies of engulfing native states in India carried by Lord Wellesley and therefore he considered them as the detrimental force that encourages the factional fightings to turn states into chaos and ultimately colonizes them. British historian William Wilson Hunter even stated that the British Residency has been the centre of anti-Bhimsen politics. Bhimsen had been keeping the British Residents out of any direct communications with the King since 1816. Hodgson considered Bhimsen as a &quot;vigorous, ambitious but unprincipled opponent&quot;. Thus, Hodgson was desperate to have direct communications with the King and wanted to break Bhimsen&#x27;s monopoly over the control of British Residents, thereby aspiring for his fall from power.

Hodgson began to portray Bhimsen as an immoral person in his reports to his superior, Governor General of India, on 18 February 1833. Hodgson reported to the Governor General that the Pande family who deserved the high ranks of the state was sidelined from the Court by Bhimsen and Bhimsen&#x27;s relatives were installed in every offices monopolizing &quot;all the loaves and fishes&quot;. But in fact, a lot of Pande politicians had occupied high ranks in the &quot;Bharadari Sabha&quot; (Council of State) and other ranks in the government offices which includes Dalabhanjan Pande, Ranajit Pande, Karbir Pande, Rana Jang Pande and Bhotu Pande. In fact, Bhimsen even called back his arch rivals like Rana Jang Pande and Karbir Pande to assume some position in the government offices. Furthermore, Bhimsen did not retain the judiciary powers in his family and had entrusted it to the Pande family member Dalabhanjan Pande through a Lalmohar traditionally dated Roj 5 Sudi 3 Falgun 1883 Bikram Samvat (1827 CE) which also stressed on the principles of equality before the law. Thus, Historian Chittaranjan Nepali considers this writing of Hodgson to Governor General as a libel attempt against Bhimsen.
Hodgson also fabricated details about Bhimsen to the Governor General, that &quot;mere children of his kindred hold high commands&quot; and gave two fictional names &quot;Colonel Shamsher Singh, aged 13, and Colonel Bahadur Jang, aged 12 years&quot; without any details of their relationship with Bhimsen. Historian Chittaranjan Nepali counters Hodgson&#x27;s assertion by assuming Bhimsen&#x27;s adoptive son (&#x27;Dharmaputra&#x27;) Sher Jung Thapa as an original intent of Hodgson, who was also, however, not promoted to the position of Colonelship at the time of issuance of this report. Sher Jung was initially given a minor rank of Captain in 1825 (1882 Bikram Samvat) and was promoted to Colonelship only after a long period of 10 years in 1835 (1892 Bikram Samvat). Historian Nepali further contends that Bhimsen didn&#x27;t promote his other minor relatives to high commands based on the fact that even the closest relatives like Sher Jung was not promoted, and contends that it was a political intrigue on the part of Hodgson to defame Bhimsen. Hodgson further fabricated a story to the Governor General of India that King Rajendra rejected treatments from court physicians during his illness on the context of them being Bhimsen&#x27;s men and the King further blamed Bhimsen to have poisoned both his father and grandfather to death; which he further alluded that the King&#x27;s allegations against Bhimsen was true and popular general belief among the Nepalese public. However, King Rajendra never mentioned that he rejected treatments on the pretext of possible poisoning by Bhimsen&#x27;s alleged court physicians, however, in his 1839 letter to Chinese Amban wrote that both of his parents were poisoned to death by Bhimsen&#x27;s alleged court physicians during their illness. Also, later in 1839 during the revival of poisoning cases against Bhimsen, two new additional fabricated cases of death by poisoning of King Girvan and his wife was brought. Furthermore, it was widely known that King Rajendra&#x27;s grandfather King Rana Bahadur Shah died from the sword assault by his step-brother Sher Bahadur Shah during an open court discussion while his father King Girvan Yuddha Bikram Shah along with his wife died from the smallpox to which historian Chittaranjan Nepali contends as another attempt of libel against Bhimsen by Hodgson.

===Failure of Mathabar Singh Thapa&#x27;s mission to Britain===

Although the British Residents were officially instructed to keep out of the internal politics of Nepal, the Resident was courted by both the King as well as the &quot;Mukhtiyar&quot;. Hodgson was waiting for an opportunity to exploit the rift between the &quot;Mukhtiyar&quot; and the royal family and begin a more aggressive campaign to increase British influence and trading opportunities. Hodgson also believed the large standing army to be a security threat and that the border tensions could be pacified if the King was directly in control, rather than a &quot;Mukhtiyar&quot; who needed to keep on the right side of the army. By 1834, Hodgson had come to a conclusion that he would not be able to have his way so long as Bhimsen was in control of the Nepalese administration; thus he strongly sympathized with the Pande faction, and he wished to install Fateh Jung Shah, who was more favorably disposed to him, as the &quot;Mukhtiyar&quot;. Hodgson reported to the Government of India on the dominance of Bhimsen over the position of the King as:

In August 1834, Hodgson proposed to conduct a new commercial treaty between Nepal and Britain, which Bhimsen in principle agreed to but disagreed with several of the clauses. At a time when his authority was diminishing, Bhimsen could not afford to antagonize the Resident; but at the same time, he could not accept his proposals and be seen as subservient to the British by the Nepalese court. Nevertheless, he tried to maintain a friendly and conciliatory attitude toward the Resident, in order to win him as his ally, by loosening the restrictions on his movements and granting direct access to the King.

In the meantime, a royal letter was received from the Maharaja Ranjit Singh, ruler of Sikh Empire in Punjab, addressed to King Rajendra. The Nepalese court seized this opportunity to re-establish diplomatic contact with Punjab as well as other states such as Burma and Gwalior. In April 1835, Bhimsen also hatched a plan to make a state visit to Britain, hoping to force Britain to acknowledge the sovereignty of Nepal; but since he could not make the visit himself, his nephew Colonel Mathabar Singh Thapa was chosen as the representative of Nepal, bearing a few gifts and a letter from King Rajendra addressed to King William IV. The idea was initially received favorably by Hodgson as well as the Governor-General, who hoped that the mission could increase the trust between the two nations. In this process, Mathabar Singh was promoted to Chota General; his brother, Ranbir Singh, the governor of Palpa, was made Full General; and Mathabar&#x27;s nephew, the sixteen-year-old Sher Jung Thapa, was made Commanding Colonel. Thus, Bhimsen managed to consolidate his military powers. Both Rajendra and Samrajya Laxmi were also pleased with this plan, and on 1 November 1835, Bhimsen was conferred the title of Commander-in-Chief. On 27 November 1835, Mathabar Singh left Kathmandu with a retinue of two thousand men, including 200 officers and 600 soldiers, for London via Calcutta.

Mathabar was given a grand welcome in Calcutta by the acting Governor-General Charles Metcalfe; and while there, Mathabar started to indulge in needless luxuries and show offs. Meanwhile, Hodgson sent a secret letter to Metcalfe asking him not to allow Mathabar to make a state visit to Britain. Hence, Metcalfe was only willing to grant him the visa of an ordinary traveler, and not the diplomatic visa of a state representative. Mathabar thus returned to Nepal in March 1836, having wasted a vast sum of money, without accomplishing any of his goals. The deliberate sabotage of Mathabar&#x27;s mission was Hodgson&#x27;s diplomatic attack against Bhimsen. Until that time, it was widely believed by both the royal family as well as the common people that Bhimsen&#x27;s good relationship with the high ranking British officials, since he was the only one allowed to communicate with them, was responsible for preventing the East India Company to take full control of Nepal. The mission&#x27;s failure unambiguously revealed to everyone that this was not the case, and severely undermined Bhimsen&#x27;s political credibility. Mathabar Singh spent a sum of one lakh and fifty thousand in Calcutta on the fruitless mission. Mathabar&#x27;s extravagant expenditure was also heavily criticized by Samrajya Laxmi, since at that time the state coffer was in dire condition; and to pacify her, Bhimsen had to reimburse the extra expenses from his own pockets.

===Rise of the Kala Pandes===
By this time, Ranajang Pande, the youngest son of Damodar Pande, was stationed as a captain in the army in Kathmandu. He was aware of the disunity between Samrajya Laxmi and Bhimsen, and thus he had secretly expressed his loyalty to Samrajya Laxmi and had vowed to help her in bringing Bhimsen down for all the wrongs he had committed against his family. Beforehand, Karbir Pande and his three brothers including Rana Jang, were already called back from Terai region and were given the governmental posts by Bhimsen himself based on the directives issued on traditionally dated 1872 Bikram Samvat, Poush Sudi 12 Roj 6 (1815-16 CE). Historian Chittaranjan Nepali contends that this excessive decency and benevolence towards his arch rivals Pandes is one of the major reason for his downfall. In November 1834, Ranajang requested to the King for the restoration of his family properties and honors, to which the King of Nepal favorably received the request. Ranajang also tried to communicate with the Chinese Amban in Lhasa to restore his family connections with Tibet and falsely tagged Bhimsen being inclined to the enemy of China i.e. the British. Factions in the Nepalese court had also started to develop around the rivalry between the two queens, with the Senior Queen supporting the Pandes, while the Junior Queen supporting the Thapas. About a month after Mathabar&#x27;s return to Kathmandu, a child was born out of a sexual relationship between him and his widowed sister-in-law. It was a customary practice for a widowed woman to marry and have a sexual relationship with her husband&#x27;s brother among all 4 Varna and 36 castes of Nepal including the high caste Upadhyaya Brahmans and Chhetris, which was safeguarded by then prevalent Sanatana practices. However, this news was spread all over the country by the Pande faction to defame Mathabar Singh, and the resulting public disgrace forced Mathabar Singh to leave Kathmandu and reside in his ancestral home in Pipal Thok, Borlang, Gorkha. To save face, Bhimsen gave Mathabar the governorship of Gorkha. Thus, British Historian Perceval Landon considered the charge to be &quot;a mere prejudice&quot; against Mathabar and a part of &quot;unceasing intrigues&quot; of the Pande faction for the &quot;exhibition of their hostility&quot;.

Taking advantage of Mathabar&#x27;s absence in Kathmandu, the military battalions under his command were distributed to other courtiers during the annual muster at the beginning of 1837. Nevertheless, Bhimsen managed to secure his and his family members&#x27; positions in the civil and military offices. An investigation was also started to check Bhimsen&#x27;s expenditures in establishing various battalions. Such events led the courtiers to feel that Bhimsen&#x27;s &quot;Mukhtiyari&quot; would not last very long; thus Ranbir Singh, in the hopes of becoming the next &quot;Mukhtiyar&quot;, wrote a letter to the King asking him to be recalled to Kathmandu from Palpa. His wish was granted; and Bhimsen, pleased to see his brother after many years, made Ranbir Singh the acting &quot;Mukhtiyar&quot; and decided to go to his ancestral home in Borlang Gorkha for the sake of pilgrimage. But in truth, Bhimsen had gone to Gorkha to placate his nephew and bring him back to Kathmandu.

In Bhimsen&#x27;s absence, King Rajendra established a new battalion, &quot;Hanuman Dal&quot;, to be kept under his personal command. By February 1837, both Ranajang and his brother, Ranadal Pande, had been promoted to the position of a &quot;kaji&quot;; and Ranajang was made a personal secretary to the King, while Ranadal Pande was made the governor of Palpa. Ranjang was also made the chief palace guard, the position formerly occupied by Ranbir Singh and then Bhimsen. Thus, this curtailed Bhimsen&#x27;s access to the royal family. On 14 June 1837, the King took over the command of all the battalions put in charge of various courtiers, and himself became the Commander-in-Chief.

===Poisoning case===
On 24 July 1837, Rajendra&#x27;s youngest son, Devendra Bikram Shah, an infant of six months, died suddenly. It was at once rumored that the child had died of poison intended for his mother the Senior Queen Samrajya Laxmi Devi: given at the instigation of Bhimsen, or someone of his faction. On this charge, Bhimsen, his brother Ranbir Singh, his nephew Mathbar Singh, their families, the court physicians, Sardar Ekdev and Eksurya Upadhyay, and his deputy Bhajuman Baidya, with a few more of the nearest relatives of the Thapas were incarcerated, proclaimed outcasts, and their properties confiscated. The physicians Ekdev and Eksurya, being Brahmins, were severely tortured but spared, while Bhajuman Baidya was impaled and killed. Under torture, Ekdev confessed, and thus confirmed a widely circulated rumor, that he was directed by Bhimsen to poison not just Devendra, but King Girvan as well.

There is a general consensus among historians that Bhimsen was not behind the poisoning. Bhimsen had nothing to gain by killing an infant less a year old, and the accusation was simply a ruse to answer foreign inquiries on Bhimsen&#x27;s imprisonment. It was a general practice among the physicians of the time to check the strength of their medicine by first letting the mother taste it, before giving it to their newborn. It was later rumored that it was the Junior Queen who had actually contrived to kill the Senior Queen by poisoning the medicine intended for her newborn. While the poison did not express itself on the intended Queen, it managed to kill the infant prince, and the powerless Bhimsen was made a convenient scapegoat. Historian Gyanmani Nepal contends this to be closer to the truth. Historian William Wilson Hunter contended that &quot;the whole charge was an invention trumped up by the Pandis to secure Bhim Sen&#x27;s overthrow as they themselves confessed six years later&quot;. Hodgson on his reports to Governor General of India dated 18 September 1837 revealed that in fact King Rajendra knowingly held Bhimsen in the false charges because of his personal enmity.

===Dismissal from office and subsequent pardon===

Immediately after the incarceration of the Thapas, a new government with joint &quot;Mukhtiyars&quot; was formed with Ranganath Paudel as the head of civil administration, and Dalbhanjan Pande and Ranajang Pande as joint heads of military administration. This appointment established the Pandes as the dominant faction in the court, and they started to make preparations for war with the British in order to win back the lost territories of Kumaon and Garhwal. While such war posturing was nothing new, the din the Pandes created alarmed not just the Resident Hodgson but the opposing court factions as well, who saw their aggressive policy as detrimental to the survival of the country. After about three months in power, under pressure from the opposing factions, the King removed Ranjang as &quot;Mukhtiyar&quot; and Ranganath Paudel, who was favorably inclined towards the Thapas, was chosen as the sole &quot;Mukhtiyar&quot;.
King Rajendra, due to the fear of a possible rebellion, restricted the Bhimsen established &quot;Singhanath&quot; battalion, to move out of the Kathmandu valley through a &quot;Rokka&quot; issued in March 1838 (Chaitra 1894 Bikram Samvat). Thereafter, Bhimsen&#x27;s case was re-opened and heard in the royal court. Fearful that the Pandes would re-establish their power, Fatte Jang Shah, &quot;Mukhtiyar&quot; Ranga Nath Poudel, and the Junior Queen Rajya Laxmi Devi obtained from the King the liberation of Bhimsen, Mathabar, and the rest of the faction, in March 1838 about eight months after they were incarcerated for the poisoning case. British historians William Hunter and Henry Oldfied both asserted that Bhimsen fell into the King&#x27;s feet and begged for mercy before receiving the pardon which is counterargued by Nepalese Historian Chittaranjan Nepali as a &quot;mere mockery of his great personality&quot;. Some of the Thapa family&#x27;s confiscated land, as well as the Bagh Durbar, was also returned. Upon his release, the soldiers loyal to Bhimsen crowded behind him in jubilation and followed him up to his house; a similar treatment was given to Mathabar Singh and Sher Jung Thapa. Though only some of their confiscated properties were returned by the initial Lalmohar, the second Lalmohar issued at the end of 1838 (Marga month of 1895 Bikram Samvat) completely returned all of their confiscated properties. Although pardon had been granted to Bhimsen, his former office was not re-instated; thus he went to live in retirement at his patrimony in Borlang, Gorkha.

However, Ranganath Poudel, finding himself unsupported by the King, resigned from the &quot;Mukhtiyari&quot;, which was then conferred on Pushkar Shah; but Pushkar Shah was only a nominal head, and the actual authority was bestowed on Ranjang Pande. In March 1838, King Rajendra sent Mathabar Singh on a confidential mission to Sikh Emperor Ranjit Singh; initially he was arrested in May 1838 by the British during night time at Sutlej river, later allowed to proceed to Sikh capital but ultimately deported back to the British surveillance in Shimla by the Sikh Emperor on the suspicion of anti-British activities. Sensing that a catastrophe was going to befall the Thapas, Ranbir Singh gave up all his property and became a sanyasi, titling himself Abhayanand Puri but Bhimsen Thapa preferred to remain in his old home in Gorkha. The Pandes were now in full possession of power; they had gained over the King to their side by flattery. The Senior Queen had been a firm supporter of their faction, and they endeavored to secure popularity in the army by promises of war and plunder.

==Suicide: 1839==

At the beginning of 1839, Ranajang Pande was made the sole &quot;Mukhtiyar&quot;. However, knowledge about Ranajang&#x27;s war preparations and his communication with other princely states of India, fomenting anti-British sentiments, alarmed the Governor-General of the time, Lord Auckland, who mobilized some British troops near the border of Nepal. In order to resolve this diplomatic fiasco, Bhimsen was recalled from Gorkha and the rest of his confiscated property was also released. Bhimsen suggested some of the battalions under Ranjang&#x27;s command to be given to other courtiers, thus severely weakening Ranjang&#x27;s military power, and in the process convincing the British that Nepal was not on the path to war. The King agreed to this arrangement; however, this aroused a strong suspicion in Samrajya Laxmi, who determined to eradicate Bhimsen&#x27;s influence permanently.

By this time, Bhimsen&#x27;s furious nephew Mathabar Singh was living at the Sikh court in Punjab which caused fear among King Rajendra and Rana Jang that he would bring British support or wreak havoc in the case Bhimsen was attacked. Therefore, secret assassins were sent by the Nepalese royal court to poison him at Punjab. After assassins failed to poison him, with a desire to eliminate both uncle and nephew together, Rana Jang attempted to call him back to Nepal by making &quot;specious promises&quot; which Mathabar Singh thwarted after getting a hold of Rana Jang&#x27;s intentions. In April 1839, the accusation of poisoning the young prince in 1837, along with two other fabricated cases, was revived against Bhimsen and his faction, and forged papers and evidence were produced professing to incriminate him. The date when Bhimsen was charged on the alleged crime was 18 May 1839, according to then Assistant British Resident J.R. Tickell. The two fabricated cases were the poisoning of the King Girvan&#x27;s wife and King Girvan Yuddha himself who was widely known to have died from smallpox. Bhimsen pleaded and asked the proof of these additional crimes for which he had been charged and asked that why these accusations were not brought when he was dismissed and imprisoned. Only Rana Jang spoke against him in the Darbar. The Assistant British Resident J.R. Tickell observed that &quot;...Not a voice raised in his (Bhimsen&#x27;s) behalf throughout the Darbar, the chiefs sat by in dejected silence.&quot; Bhimsen appealed for justice and tried to defend himself, but the King, blindly believing the forgeries, denounced him as a traitor and put him in house arrest in a room at the ground floor of his own Bagh Durbar. Although pardon had already been given, based on these forged evidences, the court physicians, Ekdev and Eksurya Upadhyay were again arrested and tortured. Except for Mathabar Singh, who was under British surveillance in India, rest of the Thapa family were again arrested, their properties confiscated, were declared outcasts, and were proclaimed to be expelled from every public office for seven generations.

While under house arrest, Bhimsen smuggled a letter to the Resident Hodgson appealing him to intervene on his behalf, which Hodgson refused at that moment but sought permission from his superiors to do so. Bhimsen was given brutal treatment at the orders of Rana Jang during the arrest. He was kept &quot;almost starved&quot; in a dark underground cell which was &quot;less a prison than a ditch of filth&quot;. Rana Jang did not choose direct assassination of Bhimsen but some strong calculated savage measures to make Bhimsen commit suicide. One of the savage measures was that the false rumours on the method of punishment to Bhimsen was circulated every day. Meanwhile, Bhimsen&#x27;s third wife, Bhakta Kumari, happened to insult the Senior Queen Samrajya Laxmi, who upon hearing about this insult, was so angered that she order Bhakta Kumari to be removed from Bagh Durbar and put in a common jail. After this, the rival faction spread a rumor around Kathmandu that Bhakta Kumari would be stripped of her clothes and paraded through the streets of the city and he would be forced to watch it while being dipped into a mound of human faeces. This rumor also fell on Bhimsen&#x27;s ears; and unable to bear such indignity, Bhimsen attempted suicide by slitting his throat with a khukuri. The news of this attempted suicide further angered the King and the Queen, who came to look at his body, and instead of feeling sympathy for the old minister and ordering immediate medical care, Bhimsen&#x27;s blood-soaked, unconscious body was ordered that same day to be dragged through the streets and dumped by the same bank of Bishnumati river, where Bhimsen had dumped the dead bodies of 45 people 33 years ago during the Bhandarkhal massacre. Bhimsen finally died nine days later, surrounded by vultures, jackals, and dogs. Since suicide was considered a grave crime, soldiers were stationed at his death spot so that his body would not be removed and given ordinary cremation rites; and his body was allowed to be devoured by scavenging animals. On the spot where Bhimsen drew his last breath, a Shiva temple by the name Bhim-Mukteshwar was later constructed by his nephew Mathabar Singh Thapa, The road to Bhim Mukteshwar Temple is named after Mathwar and now known as Math Mukteshwar Marga.

While there is a general consensus on the cause and circumstances of Bhimsen&#x27;s death, there is a disagreement on the exact date of his death. Baburam Acharya contends that Bhimsen attempted suicide on 28 July in his house and died nine days later on 5 August by the banks of Bishnumati; while Henry Ambrose Oldfield, William Wilson Hunter and Perceval Landon, contend that the suicide was attempted on 20 July and the death occurred nine days later on 29 July in his house, only after which his dead body was disposed by the banks of Bishnumati. Historian K.L. Pradhan and Gyanmani Nepal claimed the date to be 28 July. British Resident Hodgson&#x27;s report of the event to the Governor General of India was dated 30 July 1839 where he reports the death on 29 July and precisely around 4pm on that date.

===Reactions to suicide===
On 30 July 1839, British Resident Hodgson wrote to the deputy secretary with the Governor General of India and reacted about the death of Bhimsen as a decline of a great statesman in his words &quot;Thus, has perished, the great and able statesman&quot;. Then ruling governor general of India Lord Auckland replied to Hodgson through his secretary T.H. Maddock on a letter dated 15 August 1839. He stated: 
Historian Landon also posthumously expressed the brutality of death of Bhimsen in his book titled &quot;Nepal&quot;:
==Aftermath==

The death of Bhimsen Thapa did not resolve the factional fighting at court. Five months after Bhimsen&#x27;s death, Ranajang Pande was again made prime minister; but Ranajang&#x27;s inability to control the general lawlessness in the country forced him to resign from prime minister&#x27;s office, which was then conferred on Pushkar Shah, based on Samrajya Laxmi&#x27;s recommendation. While Pushkar Shah was not as anti-British as Ranajang Pande, he was nevertheless unfavorably predisposed towards them. During his tenure, a border dispute with the British in April 1840 resulted in Governor-General of India, 1st Earl of Auckland dispatching some troop near the Nepalese border once again, which Pushkar managed to resolve diplomatically. There was also a brief army mutiny in June 1840, as a reaction against the government&#x27;s attempt to cut military salary, during which houses of several noblemen including Chautaria Pushkar Shah, in favor of this unpopular act were vandalized and burned. The mutiny was calmed only after King Rajendra publicly agreed not to implement the reform. Taking advantage of this mutiny, Resident Hodgson sent an incriminating report against the Nepalese government to his superiors in Calcutta. The Governor-General demanded the King to dissolve the incumbent government and appoint ministers more favorable towards the British. Thus, Pushkar Shah and his Pande associates were dismissed, and Fatte Jang Shah was appointed the Prime Minister in November 1840. Dismissal of Pushkar Shah curtailed Samrajya Laxmi&#x27;s power. When Rajendra refused to abdicate in favor of their eldest son Surendra, the heir apparent, she left Kathmandu and settled at a border town in Terai. However, during the monsoon season, Samrajya Laxmi was afflicted with malaria from which she died in October 1841 at the age of twenty-seven.
The death of the Senior Queen Samrajya Laxmi allowed the emergence of the Junior Queen Rajya Laxmi and Crown Prince Surendra onto the political stage. To consolidate her political influence and see her own son, rather than the heir apparent, Surendra, succeed on the throne, Rajya Laxmi had obtained pardon for Sher Jung Thapa and other jailed members of Thapa family. It was only after this that Bhimsen Thapa managed to get a symbolic funeral rite in August 1841. Thus, the Nepalese court was split into three factions centered around the King, the Queen, and the Crown Prince. Fatte Jung and his administration supported the King, the Thapas supported the Junior Queen, while the Pandes supported the Crown Prince. The resurgent Thapa coalition succeeded in sowing animosity between Fateh Jung&#x27;s ministry and the Pande coalition, who were swiftly imprisoned. During his two years in power, Fatte Jung was able to maintain a rule of law in the country; however, after the incarceration of the Pandes, nobody could rein in the worsening sadistic tendencies, sometimes with fatal consequences, of Surendra, who was then still a minor. Under immense pressure from the Queen and the nobility, along with the backing from army and the general populace, the King in January 1843 handed the highest authority of the state to his Junior Queen, Rajya Laxmi, curtailing both his own and his son&#x27;s power.

The Queen, seeking the support of her own son&#x27;s claims to the throne over those of Surendra, invited Mathabar Singh Thapa back after almost six years in exile. Upon his arrival in Kathmandu, an investigation of his uncle&#x27;s death took place, and a number of his Pande enemies were massacred. As for Ranajang Pande, he had by that time contracted mental illness and would not have posed any threat to Mathabar. Nevertheless, Ranajang was paraded through the streets and made to witness the execution of his family members, after which he was forced to commit suicide by poison. By December 1843, Mathabar Singh was appointed prime minister; but after a year in power, he alienated both the King and the Queen by supporting Surendra&#x27;s claim over the throne. On 17 May 1845, he was assassinated, on both the King and Queen&#x27;s orders, by his nephew, Jang Bahadur Kunwar. The death of Mathabar Singh ended the Thapa hegemony and set the stage for Kot massacre and the establishment of Rana Dynasty, a dictatorship of hereditary prime ministers, which was founded on the basic template provided by Bhimsen Thapa. These events provided the long period of stability the country needed but at the cost of political and economic development.

== Personal life ==
Bhimsen Thapa had three wives as per the stone inscription of Bhimbishwar Mahadev temple at Bungkot. His only son died at a young age in 1796 and his three daughters – Lalita Devi, Janak Kumari, and Dirgha Kumari were married to Pande nobles – Uday Bahadur Pande, Shamsher Bahadur Pande and Dal Bahadur Pande respectively. Uday Bahadur and Colonel Shamsher Bahadur were the sons of Kaji Bir Keshar Pande and Sardar Dal Bahadur was the son of Bir Keshar&#x27;s cousin Garud Dhoj Pande, who were son of MulKaji Ranajit Pande.

On the month of Magh 1876 Bikram Samvat (1820 CE), Bhimsen&#x27;s mother Satyarupa Maya issued a &quot;Dharmapatra&quot; prohibiting the partition of her five sons and the partition of the ancestral properties until her death. She later died on the month of the Ashadh 1877 Bikram Samvat (1820 CE) and the ancestral property partition was done on the month of Shrawan 1877 Bikram Samvat.



==Legacy and assessments==
===Character and dominance===
Bhimsen Thapa was a military leader and a de facto ruler of Nepal. Bhimsen is regarded as one of the national heroes of Nepal. He was considered a clever, farsighted, politically aware and practically diplomatic politician. Historian Chittaranjan Nepali contended that Bhimsen was an altruistic nationalist who never befriended with or accepted any foreign suzerainty. Historian Ludwig Stiller considered Bhimsen to be &quot;..a very clever statesman but he was not an economist by any means.&quot; He was considered by many as a patriotic nationalist with a pervasive control over the Kingdom. In this context, his contemporary King Rana Bahadur Shah of Nepal had told that Similarly, British historian Perceval Landon in his book &quot;Nepal&quot; had quoted that 

Historian Baburam Acharya considered Bhimsen as an &quot;unjust&quot; but &quot;devoted patriot&quot; who developed and rewarded agricultural innovations in Nepal. He considered Bhimsen to be a nationalist with personal interest and a very cruel temperament. He termed Bhimsen as a military dictator who had control over 6000 armed forces. However, historian Kumar Pradhan negates that Bhimsen could not be termed as military dictator because he himself was dependent on Pajani System (annual renewal) for renewal of his every tenure of office. Pradhan also asserts that Bhimsen did not manipulate the Army which could be seen when he was not backed up by any soldiers after his removal from Mukhtiyarship. Pradhan asserts that administrative system of Nepal was people-centric and upward mobility. Most of the Thapa Bharadars (courtiers) were appointed before 1816 and there was no monopoly of any single family in the inner circle of court. Similarly, Pradhan explains that there was no monopoly of Bhimsen because the regulations were all issued in the name of Maharaja. Historian Chittaranjan Nepali in his 1956 book Janaral Bhimsen Thapa Ra Tatkalin Nepal argued that Bhimsen was as powerful as Prime Minister Jung Bahadur Rana but he never initiated any rolls of Succession to hereditary premiership within his family like Jung Bahadur did. Resident Hodgson, one of the arch rivals who brought the downfall of Bhimsen, ultimately expressed tribute to Bhimsen on 30 July 1839 and went on to laud Bhimsen as one of the most able contemporary statesman in all of native South Asian states beside Ranjit Singh. British historian Henry Ambrose Oldfield contended that Bhimsen was extremely concerned about the independence of his country &quot;Nothing was nearer and dearer to his heart than the independence of his country&quot;. Historian Ludwig Stiller considered Bhimsen as a mere politician than a ruler and criticizes the excessive positive or negative representation used by Bhimsen&#x27;s primary biographers: Historian Chittaranjan Nepali who &quot;lionized him&quot; and Historian Baburam Acharya who labelled him as a &quot;mere schemer&quot;. He contends that despite being a powerful historical personality for three decades, Bhimsen was a mere politician of the court for the most portion of his period and his power was limited. Thus, he contends that Bhimsen used to negotiate and convince other courtiers to capitalize the political crisis into his advantage.

Nepalese-Canadian author Manjushree Thapa had written a column about him. She wrote: 

===Religious views===
Historian Baburam Acharya attributes the below idea to be of Bhimsen Thapa in the letter of then-minor King Girvan Yuddha Bikram Shah to Kaji Ranajor Thapa dated May 1814 (Sunday Jestha Sudi 4, 1871 Bikram Samvat);

===Physical appearance===

Historian Chittaranjan Nepali described Bhimsen as a tall-statured person with an impressive physical personality.

===Memorials and tributes===
There is a park dedicated to him constructed in the Gorkha Municipality called Bhimsen Park. It is in two kilometers walk from Gorkha Darbar. The park constitutes 3 ropani of land and was used by descendants of Thapa dynasty for ritual purposes in the Dashain festival.

The Bhimsen Thapa Memorial Day is celebrated on 25 July. Historian John Whelpton was awarded the 2018 &quot;Bhimsen Thapa Memorial Award&quot; by the Bhimsen Thapa Memorial Foundation on the 243rd Bhimsen Thapa Memorial Day in Kathmandu.

===Cultural depictions===
Nepalese playwright Balkrishna Sama wrote a play on him named Bhimsen Ko Antya which went on to receive the 2029 Bikram Samvat (c.1972-1973 CE) Sajha Purashkar. The historical biography of Bhimsen written by historian Chittaranjan Nepali went on to receive the 2013 Bikram Samvat (c.1956-1957 CE) Madan Puraskar in the sociology category.

===Popular legends===
Historian Chittaranjan Nepali states that there were some widespread folk legends about Bhimsen. On 28 June 1955, he had an interaction with General Kaiser Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana who foretold one of the legends about Bhimsen prevalent in then Nepalese society. The folk legend stated that Bhimsen had cursed then King of Nepal with a fate to consume from a Mana vessel (&quot;&quot;). Another folk legend stated that the corpse of Bhimsen suddenly disappeared from the place of his death; the descendants of Chautariya Fatte Jang Shah had kept the hands while the skull was kept in some secret location in London. Furthermore, it was also widely believed that the family of Fatte Jang annually worships the preserved physical remains of Bhimsen.

<text>Controlled low strength material, abbreviated CLSM, also known as flowable fill, is a type of weak, runny concrete mix used in construction for non-structural purposes such as backfill or road bases.

==Description==
CLSM consists of a mixture of Portland cement, water, aggregate and sometimes fly ash. Unlike ordinary concrete, CLSM has much lower strength. The strength of CLSM is less than , while ordinary concrete has strengths exceeding . As a result, CLSM is not suitable for supporting buildings, bridges, or other structures. Instead, it is primarily used as a replacement for compacted backfill. It also flows much better than ordinary concrete, having the consistency of a milkshake. The first known use of CLSM was in 1964. CLSM is typically a ready mix concrete rather than soil cement which is a low strength cement made using local soil, and is similar to a slurry.

==Transportation==
CLSM as a highway construction material is becoming more widespread throughout the United States. Data received from questionnaires sent by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) in 1991 and the Transportation Research Board (TRB) in 1992 indicated that approximately 30 states had some experience with the use of flowable fill, and at least 24 states have a specification for flowable fill.

Most state transportation agencies have used flowable fill mainly as a trench backfill for storm drainage and utility lines on street and highway projects. Flowable fill has also been used to backfill abutments and retaining walls, fill abandoned pipelines and utility vaults, , and settled areas, and help to convert abandoned bridges into culverts. The most frequent use of flowable fill is reported in the states of Minnesota, Maryland, Michigan, Iowa, and Indiana.

Although most states have somewhat limited experience to date with flowable fill, nearly all states that have used the material have thus far indicated satisfactory performance with little or no problems. Several states have noted that metal or plastic pipes tend to float unless anchored, and some states have reported some resistance to the use of the material by contractors or engineers. Since flowable fill is normally a comparatively low-strength material, there are no strict quality requirements for fly ash used in flowable fill or controlled low strength material mixtures. Fly ash is well suited for use in flowable fill mixtures. Its fine particle sizing (nonplastic silt) and spherical particle shape enhances mix flowability. Its relatively low dry unit weight (usually in the 890 to 1300 kg/m3 (55 to 80 lb/ft3) range) assists in producing a relatively lightweight fill, and its pozzolanic or cementitious properties provide for lower cement requirements than would normally be required to achieve equivalent strengths.

==Fly ash flowable fill mixes==
There are two basic types of flowable fill mixes that contain fly ash: high fly ash content mixes and low fly ash content mixes. 

There are no specific requirements for the types of fly ash that may be used in flowable fill mixtures. &quot;Low lime&quot; or Class F fly ash is well suited for use in high fly ash content mixes, but can also be used in low fly ash content mixes. &quot;High lime&quot; or Class C fly ash, because it is usually self-cementing, is almost always used only in low fly ash content flowable fill mixes. There is also a flowable fill product in which both Class F and Class C fly ash are used in varying mix proportions.

<text>Daniel Edward Reeves (January 19, 1944 – January 1, 2022) was an American professional football running back and coach in the National Football League (NFL). During his 38 years in the NFL, Reeves participated in nine Super Bowls, the third most for an individual. He was a head coach for 23 seasons, a position he held with the Denver Broncos from 1981 to 1992, the New York Giants from 1993 to 1996, and the Atlanta Falcons from 1997 to 2003. As a player, he spent his eight-season career with the Dallas Cowboys, who signed him as an undrafted free agent out of South Carolina in 1965.

Reeves played his college football for the South Carolina Gamecocks. He made his first two Super Bowl appearances during his playing career, winning one in Super Bowl VI. He began his coaching career in 1972 as an assistant for Cowboys, where he made three championship appearances and was part of the staff that won Super Bowl XII. As the head coach of the Broncos for twelve seasons, Reeves led the team to three championship appearances in Super Bowl XXI, Super Bowl XXII, and Super Bowl XXIV, each of which ended in defeat. Following four seasons as the head coach of the Giants, Reeves served as the Falcons&#x27; head coach for seven seasons. His most successful season with the Falcons was in 1998, when he led the franchise to their championship debut in Super Bowl XXXIII, in which he was defeated by his former team, the Broncos. He won the Associated Press NFL Coach of the Year Award for the second time after the season, the ninth coach to win the award on multiple occasions. For his accomplishments in Denver, Reeves was inducted to the Broncos Ring of Fame in 2014.

One of only thirteen NFL head coaches to win 200 career games, Reeves has the most playoff wins (eleven, tied with Marv Levy) and Super Bowl appearances (four, tied with Levy and Bud Grant) among NFL head coaches to not win a championship. He is also tied with Jeff Fisher &amp; Bill Belichick for the most regular season losses in NFL history at 165, but has the second-most total losses at 174, behind Belichick at 178. Reeves and Marty Schottenheimer are the only eligible NFL head coaches with 200 career wins that have not been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

==Early years==
Born in Rome, Georgia, Reeves grew up in Americus, Georgia. He attended Americus High School, where he participated in football, baseball, and basketball.

After Reeves missed four games with a broken collarbone during his senior season, only the University of South Carolina was interested enough to offer him a football scholarship. The interest from other schools came later, when he won the MVP trophy at the Georgia High School football All-star game, but he decided to stay with his first choice. Reeves also was selected to the All-state basketball team in 1961.

==College career==
Reeves played college football for the South Carolina Gamecocks, where he was a three-year starter at quarterback from 1962 to 1964. Reeves became the starting quarterback during his sophomore year in 1962 and was named second-team All-conference after his junior and senior years.

Even though he only compiled an 8–21–4 () record, Reeves ended his college career as the leading passer in Gamecock history, accumulating 2,561 yards passing, to go along with sixteen touchdowns and three games with 100 rushing yards. Reeves also played for the South Carolina Gamecocks baseball team.

In 1977, Reeves was inducted into the school&#x27;s Athletic Hall of Fame. In 2006, he was inducted into the State of South Carolina Athletic Hall of Fame.

==Professional playing career==
Although he went undrafted after graduation, Reeves received professional sports offers from the Dallas Cowboys in the National Football League (NFL), the San Diego Chargers in the American Football League (AFL) and the Pittsburgh Pirates in Major League Baseball. Reeves signed with the Cowboys as an undrafted free agent in 1965 to play safety, but was later moved to halfback when a series of injuries depleted the team&#x27;s depth during training camp.

In 1966, Tom Landry, looking for more speed at running back, shifted All-Pro safety Mel Renfro to offense. Renfro was hurt in the opening game, against the New York Giants, and Reeves took advantage of his opportunity by having a breakout season, leading the team in rushing with 757 yards and scoring with 96 points, while finishing second in receiving with 557 yards. His performance helped the Cowboys take some of the running load from fullback Don Perkins and reach their first championship game. Reeves set a franchise record with sixteen touchdowns (eight rushing and eight receiving), had over 1,300 all-purpose yards, was sixth in the NFL in rushing, first in touchdowns, and sixth in scoring. He was also voted to &quot;The Sporting News&quot; All-Pro team at the end of the year.

In 1967, Reeves posted back-to-back seasons with more than 600 rushing yards, ranking second on the team in rushing with 603 yards and third in receiving with 490 yards. In the week 8 game against the Atlanta Falcons, he set a franchise record after scoring four touchdowns. In the week 13 game against the Philadelphia Eagles, Reeves scored touchdowns rushing, receiving, and passing in the same game. He remained a starter until Week 4 of the 1968 season, when he tore ligaments in his left knee and was lost for the season.

The injury ended up hampering Reeves for the remainder of his career and limiting his abilities. Head coach Tom Landry started playing him in spots and asked him to become a player-coach, while being passed on the depth chart by Calvin Hill and Duane Thomas. Reeves remained in that role for three years, until he retired as an active player to become a full-time assistant coach on February 22, 1972.

Reeves played eight seasons with the Dallas Cowboys, collected 1,990 rushing yards, 1,693 receiving yards, and 42 touchdowns. The Cowboys made the playoffs every year, reaching the Super Bowl twice and culminating in a 24–3 victory over the Miami Dolphins in Super Bowl VI following the 1971 season. In Super Bowl V with the Cowboys and Colts tied at 13 in the last two minutes, he let a pass go through his hands that was intercepted, setting up the Colts in Dallas territory. The Colts won the game on a 32-yard field goal from Jim O&#x27;Brien with five seconds left. He threw a touchdown pass in the Cowboys&#x27; losing effort in the legendary subzero Ice Bowl against the Green Bay Packers for the 1967 NFL title.

In 2010, Reeves was inducted into the Texas Sports Hall of Fame.

==Coaching career==
Reeves, a protégé of Tom Landry, became the youngest head coach in the NFL when he joined the Denver Broncos in 1981 as vice president and head coach. After acquiring quarterback John Elway in a trade, Reeves guided the Broncos to six post-season appearances, five divisional titles, three AFC championships, and three Super Bowl appearances (Super Bowl XXI, Super Bowl XXII, and Super Bowl XXIV) during his twelve-year tenure. He was the only AFC coach in the decade of the 1980s to lead his team to consecutive Super Bowl berths, and his Broncos appeared in the Super Bowl three times during a span of four years. Reeves and Elway did not always see eye-to-eye, to the point where quarterback Tommy Maddox was drafted by the Broncos in the first round of the 1992 draft. This came off the heels of the 1991 season in which Reeves had fired offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach Mike Shanahan for &quot;insubordination&quot;, as Reeves felt that Shanahan was driving a wedge between him and Elway, who said in 1990 that his relationship with Reeves was &quot;the worst.&quot; Reeves was fired after the 1992 season and replaced by his protégé and friend Wade Phillips, who was previously the Broncos&#x27; defensive coordinator. Upon the death of Reeves in 2022, Elway stated that Reeves was a &quot;winner&quot; and said he owed a good deal of his career to Reeves.

Reeves was hired as head coach by the New York Giants for the 1993 season. In his first season, he led the Giants to an 11–5 record and a berth in the playoffs. Reeves&#x27;s 1993 season record is the best ever for a first-year Giants coach, and he was named the 1993 Associated Press Coach of the Year after helping them improve from a 6–10 record in 1992. Reeves was fired after the Giants went 5–11 in 1995 and 6–10 in 1996.

In 1997, Reeves was named the head coach of the Atlanta Falcons. Under his command the team, which had finished the 1996 campaign with a 3–13 record, steadily improved. After going 7–9 in his first season in 1997, the Falcons went 14–2 in 1998, going on to capture their first NFC Championship. He became the third coach (after Bill Parcells and Chuck Knox) to lead three different franchises to the playoffs. Reeves coached the Falcons to a 12–2 record before being hospitalized for the final two regular season games to undergo quadruple-bypass heart surgery in December. Reeves managed to return to the sidelines just three weeks later to lead the Falcons to victory against the Minnesota Vikings in the NFC Championship Game. During Super Bowl XXXIII, Reeves&#x27;s Falcons were pitched against his former team, the defending champion Denver Broncos whose quarterback Elway was in his final season that had Shanahan as head coach. The Falcons lost, 34–19. In the process, Reeves earned the NFL&#x27;s top coaching awards as he was named the 1998 NFL Coach of the Year. In 2003, after winning just three of the first thirteen games, Reeves was fired and the Falcons replaced him with Wade Phillips as interim coach for three games.

In 2007, Reeves had an active role in the startup of Georgia State University&#x27;s football program. In January 2009, Reeves interviewed with the San Francisco 49ers for their offensive coordinator job. After negotiations with the Dallas Cowboys, Reeves became a consultant for the team in February 2009. This role was short-lived, lasting two days before Reeves turned in the keys to his office and left. Reeves and the Cowboys could apparently not reach conclusions as to Reeves&#x27;s role with the team. In the days following, it was revealed that the dispute came down to a contract clause specifying a number of hours per week to be worked, which Reeves deemed insulting.

==Head coaching record==
==Broadcast career==
Reeves covered NFL games as a color analyst (teamed with play-by-play man Bill Rosinski) for the second Sunday afternoon game on the Westwood One radio network.

==Personal life and death==
Reeves was married to Pam Reeves, and had three children and six grandchildren. Reeves and his future wife dated in high school, where she was a cheerleader. While coaching for the Giants, Reeves and his wife were residents of Ho-Ho-Kus, New Jersey. He was a Christian.

Reeves&#x27; nephew is David Andrews, who plays in the NFL. His son-in-law, Joe DeCamillis, is a longtime NFL assistant.

Reeves died from complications of dementia at his home in Atlanta on the morning of January 1, 2022, aged 77.

<text>Amar Singh Thapa distinguished as Badakaji Amar Singh Thapa(), or Amar Singh Thapa The Elder, (also spelled Ambar Simha) also known by the honorific name Bada Kaji (&quot;Senior Kaji&quot;) or Budha Kaji (&quot;The Old Kaji&quot;), was a Gorkhali military general, governor and warlord in the Kingdom of Nepal. He was the overall commander of the Nepal Army in the conquest of Western Provinces and authoritative ruler of Kumaon, Garhwal in the Kingdom of Nepal. He was referred by the King of Nepal to have been deployed as Mukhtiyar (equivalent to Prime Minister) of Western Provinces of Kumaon, Garhwal. He is often hailed as Living Tiger of Nepal (; &quot;jyūm̐do bāgha&quot;) and was posthumously regarded as one of the national heroes of Nepal, who led the Anglo-Nepalese War for the Gorkhali Army. Amarsingh Chowk Pokhara and Shree Amarsingh Model Higher Secondary School are named after Amar Singh Thapa.

==Early life and family==
He was grandson of Ranjai [of Sirhanchowk] and son of Bhim Sen known as Umrao &quot;Bagh&quot; Bhim Singh Thapa, who commanded and died in the battle of Palanchowk in 1759 AD. He belonged to Bagale Thapa clan.

He was popularly named &quot;Amar Singh Thapa (Bada)&quot; to distinguish him from another Kaji Amar Singh Thapa (Sana), Mukhtiyar Bhimsen Thapa&#x27;s father, by identifiers &quot;Bada&quot; and &quot;Sana&quot; meaning elder and younger. His family members were added to the Royal Court by Bhimsen Thapa, who was also a member of Bagale Thapa clan. His eldest son Ranadhoj Thapa was deputy to Mukhtiyar (Prime Minister) Bhimsen Thapa sharing the authority while other four sons namely – Bhaktabir Singh, Narsingh, Ramdas and Ranjore Singh, all of them were Kajis at some point. His youngest son Ranajor Singh Thapa fought with him in the Anglo-Nepalese War while his eldest son Ranadhoj Thapa, was vice to Mukhtiyar of Nepal. His grandson, young Surat Singh Thapa, was appointed to post of Kazi in 1832 C.E. to retaliate growing Darbar politics after which the government papers were jointly signed by Mukhtiyar Bhimsen Thapa and Kazi Surath Singh. His two grandsons from eldest son Ranadhoj Thapa, namely – Ripu Mardan and Badal Singh, were both Kaji at some period. Thus, his family was another influential Bagale Thapa family in the Royal Court alongside the premier Bhimsen Thapa family.

==Early Conquests==
&quot;Bada&quot; Amar Singh led many conquest battles of Western provinces in the Unification of Nepal. He was leading the conquest of Langur Gadhi in Gadhwal Region before the outbreak of second Sino-Nepalese War (1791–92 C.E.). He reinforced back to Nuwakot travelling around 1000 km in about a month, in defence of Nepalese forces during the second Sino-Nepalese War of 1791–92 C.E. In July 1804, he along with Kaji Dalbhanjan Pande informed the Company&#x27;s in-charge &quot;Daroga&quot; about the orders of takeover of Butwal plains and continuation of honoring Palpa&#x27;s former obligations from the King of Gorkha. After 1806, the territories of Palpa were kept under the military governorship of him and Kaji Dalbhanjan. They set up plans to establish the full Gorkhali authority over the lands by appointing officials and reviewing land grants. The general administration of the region was looked over and revenue collection was regulated by them. He dissolved the &quot;Maafi&quot; (rent-free) land grants to Jaisi Brahmins in Butwal area for continuation of payments to Gorkhali soldiers.

He commanded the Gorkhali Army with Sardar Bhakti Thapa and Hasti Dal Shah in 1804 against Garhwal Kingdom due to the Garhwal&#x27;s discontinuance of annual payments to Kingdom of Nepal. The army succeeded in annexing Garhwal to Nepalese territory extending the territory of Nepal up to the Sutlej river in the west.

Bada Amar commanded his troops further to Kangra fort of King Sansar Chand. They rested on Jwalamukhi and ultimately captured the fort. King Sansar Chand aided by 1500 soldiers of Sikh Maharaja Ranjit Singh fought against forces of Amar Singh at Ganesh Valley and retreated back only to attack at the evening. Due to the attack in the evening, Gorkhali Army lost some positions and Bada Amar returned to Sutlej river as per agreement on 24 August 1809 AD. The Gurkhas suffered a strike on their pride but were helpless against the superior Westernized Sikh forces.

He later met Akali Chandan Singh Nihang who converted him to Sikhism. For a few years Amar Singh Thapa led the life of a Sikh hermit although he didn&#x27;t follow Sikhism completely and was a Sehajdhari Sikh. He wrote a book on his belief in Sikhism called the &quot;Adi Bhagvan Prakash&quot; which has not been published as of yet and remains in the Nepali State Archives&quot;.&quot;

Bada Kaji Amar Singh advised Mukhtiyar (Chief Authority) of Nepal, Bhimsen Thapa, to avoid war with the British because he waged war in person and knew the hardships of war. He was one of the senior Bharadars to have opposed the Anglo-Nepalese War due to prevalence of weak administration in the western front suggesting a possible revolt from the general people of the newly conquered western front.

The appointment letter of two of three Subbas (governor) of one-third territories of Garhwal, Surabir Khatri and Ranabir Khatri on Ashadh Badi 2, 1862 V.S. (i.e. June 1805) explained the supreme authority &quot;Mukhtiyarship (premiership)&quot; of Amar Singh in the Western province: 
Similarly, another appointment letter of Subba of one-third territories of Garhwal, Sardar Chandrabir Kunwar on Ashadh Badi 2, 1862 V.S. (i.e. June 1805), also instructed the governor to act according to the advice of Amar Singh. A British soldier commented to the independent authority of Bada Amar Singh in the western front before the Anglo-Nepalese war:
 When the Kathmandu Durbar solicited Nepalese chiefs&#x27; opinions about a possible war with the British, Amar Singh Thapa was not alone in his opposition, declaring that – He was against the measures adopted in Butwal and Sheeoraj, which he declared to have originated in the selfish views of persons, who scrupled not to involve the nation in war to gratify their personal avarice.

===First Campaign===
The British columns led by British Generals Rollo Gillespie and David Ochterlony in the Western front faced the defence under the command of Bada Amar Singh. During the first campaign of Anglo-Nepalese War, Badakaji Amar Singh commanded Nepalese army facing columns under Major-General Rollo Gillespie and Colonel David Ochterlony in the Western Front (Kumaon-Gadhwal axis).

He commanded Gorkhali forces to defend the town of Srinagar from &quot;The third division&quot; army under Major-General Gillespie coming from western side. His son Ranjore Singh Thapa was holding forces at Nahan, the chief town of Sirmaur.

===Second Campaign===
During the second campaign, he was serving as sector commander of Sindhuli Gadhi and eastern front facing heavy casualties from the assault of Colonel Kelly and Colonel O&#x27;Hollorah under Main Operational commander David Ochterlony. His son Ranjore reached Sindhuli Gadhi to defend the fort. The British couldn&#x27;t reach Sindhuli Gadhi and felt back.

==Heritages built==

Amar Singh was a religious personality who built many forts across Nepal and India. The original Gangotri Temple at Uttarakhand was built by him, which is part of Chhota Char Dham pilgrimage circuit. He built the oldest temple in the Mithila city Janakpur, Nepal, the Sri Ram Temple. After establishment of full Gorkha authority over Palpa and adjacent Terai, he built the Amar Narayan temple at Tansen in the hills above Butwal in 1807.

==Legacy==

Bada Kaji Amar Singh is often hailed as Living Lion of Nepal due to his fighting prowess, greater leadership and patriotism. British Historian Hamilton drew comparisons of him with the ancient Carthaginian General Hannibal. A popular patriotic quote in the Nepalese history is attributed to him: 
The letter from the central government of Nepal held the praises of Kaji Amar Singh in the letters to other civil and military officers including provincial governors:
The village of Amaragadhi in western Nepal is named for him. There is a Khukuri sword named after him called Amar Singh Thapa Khukuri. This Khukuri is modeled on the real Khukuri used by him. The real Khukuri used by Amar Singh is archived at National Museum of Nepal and is more curvy in nature than other traditional Khukuris.

==Descendants==
Amar Singh was married to Dharmabati. Nepali historian Surya Bikram Gyawali contends that he had 9 sons namely: Surbir, Randhoj, Ran Singh, Ranjor, Bhakta Bir, Ram Das, Narsingh, Arjun Singh and Bhupal. He further states that all the sons of Amar Singh contributed to the unification of Nepal. Amar Singh had ten sons from four wives as per the Thapa genealogy: Ranabir, Ranasur, Ranadhoj, Ranabhim, Ranajor, Bhaktabir, Ramdas, Narsingh, Arjun Singh, and Bhupal Singh. The Office of the Nepal Antiquary also mentions sons of Amar Singh as Ranajor, Bhaktavir, Ramdas, Ranasur, Ranabir, Arjun, Narsingh and Bhupal. The genealogical table produced by Nepali historian Kumar Pradhan shows the sons of Bada Amar Singh as - Ranadhoj, Bhaktabir, Narsingh, Ramdas and Ranajor, all of whom were Kaji at some point. His grandsons through daughter Ambika Devi and son-in-law Chandravir Kunwar were Birbhadra Kunwar, a military commander in Kumaun and Balabhadra Kunwar, a national hero of the Battle of Nalapani.

Nepali movie director, Sunil Thapa, who is married to popular Nepali actress Jharana Thapa, is an eighth patrilineal descendant of Bada Kaji Amar Singh making their daughter Nepali actress Suhana Thapa a ninth descendant.

<text>James Ernest Mora (born May 24, 1935) is an American former football coach who served as a head coach in the National Football League (NFL) for 15 seasons. He was the head coach of the New Orleans Saints from 1986 to 1996 and the Indianapolis Colts from 1998 to 2001. Mora was also the head coach of the Philadelphia/Baltimore Stars of the first iteration of the United States Football League (USFL) during its three years of existence and led the team to all three championship games, winning two.

As an NFL head coach, Mora was known for turning the Saints and Colts, two consistently losing franchises, into perennial postseason contenders. He became the first coach to lead the Saints to a winning record and playoff berth in 1987, their 21st season, earning him NFL Coach of the Year honors. However, his reputation was affected by going winless in the NFL postseason, in addition to impassioned postgame tirades and press conferences. Mora finished his career with a winning percentage of .527, the highest of NFL coaches without a playoff win. He is the father of former NFL and current collegiate head coach Jim L. Mora.

==Early life==
Born in Glendale, California, Mora became an Eagle Scout in 1950 and was presented the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award as an adult by the Boy Scouts of America. Mora was a tight end at Occidental College, a member of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity, and graduated in 1957. His college roommate was Jack Kemp, an all star quarterback with the Buffalo Bills, U.S congressman from New York for 18 years and presidential candidate in 1988. Another teammate was Ron Botchan, who went on to become a successful NFL game official.

==Coaching career==
===Early jobs===
Mora became an assistant coach at his alma mater in 1960. He moved up to head coach of Occidental in 1964 and led the team for three seasons, compiling an 18–9 record.

Mora received a master&#x27;s degree in education in 1967 and left Occidental to serve as an assistant coach at Stanford under John Ralston for the 1967 season. He then spent five seasons at Colorado under Eddie Crowder coaching defensive ends, outside linebackers, and defensive backs, one at UCLA under Dick Vermeil, and three at Washington under Don James. He moved across town to the professional ranks in 1978 as the defensive line coach for the NFL&#x27;s Seattle Seahawks under head coach Jack Patera. After four seasons, Mora moved to the New England Patriots in 1982 under head coach Ron Meyer.

===USFL===
The United States Football League came into existence 1983 and Mora became head coach of the Philadelphia Stars (who moved to Baltimore in 1985). During his tenure the team compiled a 48–13–1 () record, appeared in all three USFL championship games and won two of them. Mora was named Coach of the Year in 1984 and is considered by many observers to be the best coach in the short history of the USFL. Six months after the Stars won the 1985 USFL title, Mora was named head coach of the NFL&#x27;s New Orleans Saints. The USFL was later forced out of business after winning a token award of $3 in an antitrust suit against the NFL.

===New Orleans Saints===
Mora was hired by new Saints general manager Jim Finks to turn around what had long been reckoned as the most inept franchise in the NFL. The Saints had won only 90 games in their first nineteen seasons, never tallied a winning record, and only twice had reached .500, in 1979 (the only time they finished higher than 3rd in their division) and 1983. Mora spent his first off-season remaking the Saints roster. He convinced several players from the USFL, including some from his Stars, to come to New Orleans. The imports included linebackers Sam Mills and Vaughan Johnson, who went on to form the inside tandem of the legendary &quot;Dome Patrol&quot; linebacking corps with veteran Rickey Jackson and draftee Pat Swilling on the outside. Mora inherited quarterback Bobby Hebert and receiver Eric Martin from Phillips, and drafted running back Reuben Mayes and tackle Jim Dombrowski.

After a 7–9 record his first season, Mora led the Saints to a 12–3 record in 1987. In week 6 of the 1987 season the Saints lost a 24–22 game to the San Francisco 49ers, with Morten Andersen missing a last-second field goal. After the game Mora launched what became known as his &quot;Coulda, Woulda, Shoulda&quot; speech. In his postgame press conference, Mora angrily said the following:

The Saints responded by winning their last nine games, notching the franchise&#x27;s first-ever winning record and playoff berth. The Saints had the second-best record in the entire league. Unfortunately for them, the 49ers had the league&#x27;s best record (13–2), and also played in the NFC West. Therefore, the Saints were a wild-card team (since 1987 was a strike-shortened season with replacement games, the Saints and 49ers had identical 10–2 records in regular season non-replacement games). Nonetheless, the Saints were able to play their first playoff game at home, which they lost, 44–10, to the Minnesota Vikings. Mora received the NFL Coach of the Year Award.

Mora&#x27;s Saints finished 10–6 in 1988, and were part of a three-way tie for first in the NFC West with the San Francisco 49ers and Los Angeles Rams. However, the 49ers won the division on tie-breakers with a season sweep of the Saints, and the Saints lost the wild-card tiebreaker with the Rams and missed the playoffs. In 1989, the Saints again had a winning record (9–7) but finished 3rd in the NFC West and missed the playoffs. It was during the 1989 season when Mora had another remembered tirade after a game, when he scolded a sportswriter on not knowing what goes on during the week during practice.
Thereafter his Saints teams made the playoffs three more times. In 1990, the Saints only finished 8–8, but managed to make the playoffs as a wild card. They lost in the first round of the playoffs to the Chicago Bears, 16–6.

In 1991, Mora&#x27;s Saints finished 11–5 and won the team&#x27;s first division title. However, the Saints lost again in the first round of the playoffs. They lost at home to the Atlanta Falcons 27–20, in spite of finishing one game ahead of the Falcons in the NFC West during the regular season. In 1992, Mora led the Saints to its second 12-win season in six seasons, finishing 12–4. They were a wild card again, however, as the San Francisco 49ers finished 14–2. For the second time in two years, the Saints were upset at home in the first round of the playoffs, as the Philadelphia Eagles defeated the Saints 36–20. This would be the Saints&#x27; last playoff game during Mora&#x27;s tenure, leaving him with an 0–4 playoff record in New Orleans. The Saints would not win a playoff game until 2000.

1993 marked the beginning of the decline of Mora&#x27;s Saints. The team started the season 5–0 and appeared to be headed to the postseason again; however, after the Saints&#x27; bye week, the team went into a tailspin and went only 3–8 in the final 11 games, including losing four out of their last five. 1993 was Mora&#x27;s last season of .500 or better in New Orleans. In the Week 16 game at home against the New York Giants, Saints quarterback Wade Wilson was injured on &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; and fans were cheering that fact, prompting an angry retort:

After two 7–9 seasons in 1994 and 1995, Mora appeared increasingly frustrated with his team&#x27;s situation in New Orleans. The Saints&#x27; defense went into a steep decline, negating the passing heroics of quarterback Jim Everett, acquired from the division rival Los Angeles Rams in 1994 for a seventh-round draft choice. Everett came to the Saints shortly before his infamous incident with Jim Rome on ESPN2 when Rome insulted the quarterback by calling him Chris Evert, a reference to Jim Everett&#x27;s lack of toughness.

The 1996 season started off very badly. The Saints lost their first five games, including an embarrassing 28–14 loss at home to the then-winless Arizona Cardinals in which LeShon Johnson rushed for 214 yards, a Cardinals franchise record which has since been broken by Beanie Wells in 2011. Following a road loss to the Baltimore Ravens, the Saints won back-to-back home games vs. the Jacksonville Jaguars and Chicago Bears, but the turnaround was a mirage. After the Saints were beaten 19–7 by the Carolina Panthers on October 20, a loss which put them at 2–6 midway through the season, Mora walked out of the postgame press conference in disgust after a profanity-laced tirade. His outburst became famous on sports highlight reels for years to follow, largely because of Mora&#x27;s use of the phrase &quot;Diddley Poo.&quot; On the Saints&#x27; performance, Mora said the following:

The next day, Mora resigned; linebackers coach Rick Venturi finished out the season. The Saints finished the season at 3–13, their worst season since going 1–15 in 1980. Venturi was replaced by veteran Chicago Bears coach Mike Ditka. Mora&#x27;s 93 wins in just over ten years in New Orleans are three more than the Saints had won in their first 19 seasons combined. He won more games than any other coach in Saints history until Sean Payton surpassed his record in 2016.

===Indianapolis Colts===
Mora served as a color analyst for NBC in 1997, and he replaced Lindy Infante as head coach of the Indianapolis Colts for 1998. The team struggled to a 3–13 mark in his first year with rookie Peyton Manning learning the ropes at quarterback but had an amazing turnaround to 13–3 in 1999, thanks in large part to the addition of rookie running back Edgerrin James. At the time, this turnaround was the &quot;largest&quot; in NFL history. The Colts lost their first playoff game in the AFC Divisional Playoffs (the team received a first-round bye to advance to the Divisional Playoffs) to the Tennessee Titans, which dropped Mora&#x27;s all-time NFL postseason record to 0–5.

The Colts finished 10–6 in 2000 and made the playoffs once again, but the team lost a wild-card round playoff game to the Miami Dolphins by a score of 23–17 in overtime. This defeat dropped Mora&#x27;s overall postseason record to 0–6. Ironically, just hours after Mora lost what would be the sixth and final playoff game of his career, his former team, the New Orleans Saints, won their first-ever playoff game.

====&quot;Playoffs?&quot; tirade====

On November 25, 2001, after a lackluster five turnover plagued loss to the San Francisco 49ers that dropped the Colts to 4–6, Mora made his famous &quot;playoffs?&quot; tirade. Of the Colts&#x27; performance, Mora told the media not to &quot;blame that game on the defense.” Mora cited the five turnovers the Colts&#x27; offense made (one of which resulted in a touchdown and three others that set up field position for touchdown-scoring drives) as a cause of the loss, saying that a team that turns the ball over five times in one game is unlikely to beat a high school or college team, &quot;much less an NFL team.”

Later in the press conference, in response to Tim Bragg, a reporter for WRTV, who asked a question about the Colts&#x27; chances for making the playoffs, Mora said in a high-pitched, incredulous tone:

His &quot;playoffs?&quot; sound bite is regularly played back as a joke on a number of sports radio talk shows when discussing mediocre NFL teams or playoffs of other sports. The tirade would go on to be featured in a Coors Light commercial in 2006 as part of an ad campaign that recreated NFL coaches&#x27; infamous press conferences with twenty-something male actors asking the coaches inane and unrelated non-football questions about the beer. In an appearance on the &quot;Best Damn Sports Show&quot; in 2003, Mora talked about going to autograph signings and having a kid come up to him and ask him to say &quot;playoffs&quot; in lieu of an autograph. He&#x27;s also had some fun with the remark during 2007 training camp when he talked to his son Jim L. Mora, then an assistant with the Seattle Seahawks, via satellite feed on the NFL Network when Marcus Pollard, a former member of Mora&#x27;s Colts, spoofed Mora senior&#x27;s &quot;Playoffs?&quot; rant. More fun was had as Mora said the &quot;Playoffs?&quot; line during a media session to the New York Giants in the days leading up to Super Bowl XLII in Arizona.

Hampered by a defense that allowed the most points in the league (30.4 per game), Indianapolis only won two more games that year. Some sources believed that Mora could have saved his job if he had fired one (or more) of his coordinators (especially defensive coordinator Vic Fangio), but he refused to do so. Mora was fired after the season and replaced with ex-Buccaneers coach Tony Dungy. Dungy, who served as head coach of the Colts from 2002–2008, made the playoffs in all of his seven seasons with Indianapolis. Along the way, he would lead the team to five straight division titles (2003–07) and a Super Bowl victory (2006).

===Coaching philosophy===

Mora favored a conservative approach to the game, relying on a strong running game and solid defensive play. Perhaps more than any other teams, the Saints teams of the late 1980s embodied his coaching style. Those teams were led by the &quot;Dome Patrol&quot; linebacking corps. This unit, consisting of Rickey Jackson, Sam Mills, Vaughan Johnson, and Pat Swilling, became known as one of the best four-man linebacking corps in NFL history. Those same Saints teams also had a strong running game, mostly led by Rueben Mayes and Dalton Hilliard, as well as a conservative but efficient passing game led by quarterback Bobby Hebert and wide receiver Eric Martin. During his time as the Colts&#x27; head coach, Mora was able to benefit from having an explosive, more potent offense, featuring quarterback Peyton Manning, running back Edgerrin James, and wide receiver Marvin Harrison. Manning, James, and Harrison have all earned induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

In Mora&#x27;s 11 seasons with the Saints, he won 55.6% of his games for a team that had never recorded a winning record prior to his arrival. And during his four seasons with the Colts, he built a then-struggling team into a respectable playoff contender. Despite his overall solid regular season record coaching both the Saints and Colts (125–106), the biggest criticism of Mora has been his teams&#x27; inability to win any playoff games in six appearances. His critics, both among fans and media reporters, often blamed his lack of success in the postseason to his conservative approach.

Critics continued to argue that this conservative approach prevented his teams from closing out big games against good teams, like the &quot;Marty Ball&quot; approach Marty Schottenheimer used during his coaching career. The most frequent complaint was that his teams&#x27; offenses would no longer be aggressive late in these football games. They accused him of trying to run out the clock and not make mistakes and over-relying on his defense to hold the lead (instead of trying to build on the lead and score more points). Critics argued that this aspect of his conservative strategy backfired on him. They point to the fact that his teams had second half leads in four of his six playoff games, but they won none of them. In three of those games, Mora&#x27;s teams had leads in the fourth quarter.

Another factor that worked against Mora during his coaching career with the Saints was how his team played in the NFC West with the San Francisco 49ers during their dynasty era and earlier in his tenure a strong LA Rams outfit. Twice his Saints team recorded twelve wins without winning the division. Another time, his Saints went 10–6 and still missed the playoffs.

In an NFL Network program naming Jim Mora the #10 &quot;Coach Who Never Won a Championship,&quot; former Philadelphia Eagles offensive lineman Brian Baldinger said of the Saints&#x27; playoff loss to the Eagles in 1992, &quot;We beat &#x27;em. But that&#x27;s only because they called the dogs off. Whatever reason, they called the dogs off in the second half. I don&#x27;t know what Jim Mora was thinking about that day.&quot; In that game, the Saints led 17–7 at halftime and 20–10 after the 3rd quarter. However, the Eagles scored 26 unanswered points in the fourth quarter and won the game 36–20.

==Life after coaching==
In 2003, Mora became an on-air analyst for &quot;NFL Total Access&quot;, the primary analysis show on the newly launched NFL Network.

Mora was a sports radio commentator for Fox Sports Radio&#x27;s &quot;GameTime Saturday&quot; and &quot;GameTime Sunday&quot; with Dan Moriarty. On Thanksgiving Thursday, November 23, 2006, Mora made some critical comments about the Atlanta Falcons&#x27; quarterback Michael Vick which became controversial because the Falcons were coached at the time by Mora&#x27;s son, Jim L. Mora. Craig Shemon of Fox Sports Radio called Vick a &quot;coach killer&quot; and Mora quickly agreed with that assessment, saying that Vick was not a good passer and expressing concern for his son&#x27;s prospects of keeping his head coaching job while the popular Vick was the team&#x27;s quarterback (The younger Mora was indeed fired a month later).

<text>Death to the Pixies is a compilation album by the American alternative rock band Pixies, released by 4AD in the UK on October 6, 1997, and 4AD/Elektra the following day in the United States to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the band&#x27;s debut. It covered the years 1987 to 1991. It is now out of print, having been replaced by the 2004 compilation &quot;Wave of Mutilation: Best of Pixies&quot;. A limited edition of the compilation also included a second CD with a live performance taken from Vredenburg, Utrecht, Netherlands on September 25, 1990.

There was also another version of the limited edition, produced in extremely small quantities, that includes two rare &quot;Black Francis Demos&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;m Amazed&quot; and &quot;Broken Face&quot;). This is known as the &quot;Golden Ticket&quot; version, and has GT appended to its catalog number. These demos, recorded in the apartment of producer Gary Smith the day before the band convened to record their full demo at Smith&#x27;s Fort Apache Studios, feature only Francis singing and playing acoustic guitar (and giving notations to Smith about where the other band members&#x27; parts are). The complete &quot;Black Francis Demos&quot; were released as the first disc of 2004&#x27;s Frank Black Francis 2-CD compilation.

The vinyl release contained all the tracks on the &quot;Golden Ticket&quot; version, spread out over four 10&quot; records. Featuring a different cover, the vinyl version was a limited edition of 9,000 copies printed.

, sales in the United States have exceeded 148,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan.

<text>James Donald Haslett (born December 9, 1955) is an American football coach and former linebacker who was most recently the head coach of the Seattle Sea Dragons of the XFL. He played college football for the IUP Crimson Hawks before being drafted by the Buffalo Bills in the second round of the 1979 NFL draft; he went on to be named NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year.

Haslett&#x27;s coaching career began in the late 1980s, with him rejoining the NFL by the mid-1990s. In 2000, he was hired as head coach of the New Orleans Saints and was named the NFL Coach of the Year. He has also served as head coach for the Florida Tuskers of the United Football League (UFL).

==Playing career==
Haslett attended Indiana University of Pennsylvania, and was selected in the second round of the 1979 NFL draft by the Buffalo Bills. He was a linebacker for the Buffalo Bills through 1985; he broke his leg during a 1986 preseason contest, ending his time with the Bills. He made a brief comeback with the New York Jets in 1987. He was named the NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year for 1979. In a 2005 article in the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot;, Haslett admitted to using steroids while playing for the Buffalo Bills. Haslett went on record saying that &quot;everybody tried it&quot; to gain a competitive advantage against opposing teams.

==Coaching career==

===Early coaching career===

Haslett began his coaching career at the University at Buffalo in 1988 as a linebackers coach before being promoted to defensive coordinator in 1989. After three seasons with Buffalo, Haslett became the defensive coordinator for the Sacramento Surge of the World League of American Football for the team&#x27;s inaugural season in 1991. The league suspended operations after the 1992 season.

===NFL coaching career===
Haslett began his NFL coaching career as a linebackers coach for the Los Angeles Raiders in 1993. After two seasons with the Raiders, Haslett was hired as linebackers coach for the New Orleans Saints. He was promoted to defensive coordinator for the 1996 season. After head coach Jim Mora quit during the season, Haslett was offered the interim head coach position, but he declined, and was not retained by new head coach Mike Ditka for the 1997 season.

Haslett was then hired as the defensive coordinator for the Pittsburgh Steelers, where he coached for three seasons from 1997 to 1999.

===New Orleans Saints===
In January 2000, Haslett was named head coach of the New Orleans Saints. He was reportedly hired to a three-year contract. That season, he guided the Saints to a 10–6 regular-season record, their second NFC West division championship, and the first playoff victory in franchise history (defeating the St. Louis Rams; they lost to the Minnesota Vikings the next week). As a result of the Saints&#x27; turnaround from their previous 3–13 season (under his predecessor, Mike Ditka), Haslett was named NFL Coach of the Year. This was the only playoff appearance in Haslett&#x27;s six years in New Orleans. They would only notch one other winning record in 2002. That year, the Saints started 9–4, but three consecutive losses, including to the 1-14 Cincinnati Bengals, resulted in them missing the playoffs by a single game.

In 2005, the Saints crashed to a 3–13 record. The season was marred by Hurricane Katrina&#x27;s devastation of New Orleans. This forced the franchise to temporarily relocate to San Antonio, playing three of their &#x27;home&#x27; games in the Alamodome. Another four home games were played in Baton Rouge at LSU&#x27;s Tiger Stadium, and one took place at Giants Stadium in New Jersey (against the New York Giants).

Haslett was fired after the 2005 season. He finished his six-year tenure as the head coach of the Saints with the second most head coaching wins in franchise history, with a regular season record of 45–51.

===St. Louis Rams===
Haslett became the St. Louis Rams&#x27; defensive coordinator to start the 2006 season. On September 29, 2008, Haslett was named the interim head coach of the Rams after Scott Linehan was fired. The Rams gave Haslett an interim coach&#x27;s contract, containing a clause that promised him the permanent head coach&#x27;s job if the team won at least six games that season. Within a few weeks, this clause was nullified by the NFL, because it violated the league&#x27;s &quot;Rooney Rule&quot;. He won his first game as interim head coach of the Rams with a 19–17 victory over the 4-1 Washington Redskins. That win was followed by a 34-14 drubbing of the Dallas Cowboys on October 19, 2008. This brought the Rams to a 2–4 record. The team would lose their final 10 games, leaving Haslett with an interim record of 2–10 on the year. On January 15, 2009, the Rams announced that Haslett was no longer in consideration for the permanent head coaching position and that the team would be going in a &quot;new direction&quot;.

===Florida Tuskers===
Haslett coached the Florida Tuskers of the United Football League during its inaugural season in 2009. The team went 6-0 but were upset in the first-ever UFL Championship Game by the Las Vegas Locomotives. He won UFL Coach of Year in their inaugural season.

===Washington Redskins===
Haslett was hired as the Washington Redskins defensive coordinator on January 12, 2010, under head coach Mike Shanahan. Haslett replaced the retiring Greg Blache. After many speculated he would be fired after the disastrous 2013 season, new head coach Jay Gruden announced Haslett would remain on the team for the upcoming 2014 season. The move reunited the pair, as Gruden had worked as the offensive coordinator under Haslett for the Tuskers in the 2009 season. On December 31, 2014, the Redskins announced that Haslett would leave the Redskins by mutual agreement.

===Cincinnati Bengals===

After spending the 2015 season as a consultant for Penn State, Haslett was hired as the linebackers coach for the Cincinnati Bengals on January 15, 2016. Following the 2018 season, the Bengals chose not to retain Haslett along with several other assistant coaches after the firing of longtime head coach Marvin Lewis.

===Tennessee Titans===
On February 6, 2020, Tennessee Titans head coach Mike Vrabel hired Haslett as the team&#x27;s inside linebackers coach. Haslett spent two years in the role. He was not retained after the 2021 season.

=== XFL ===
Haslett was announced as an XFL head coach in 2021, later revealed to be for the Seattle Sea Dragons. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the XFL ceased operations in 2021 and 2022. Haslett was the head coach of the Sea Dragons for their final season in 2023, guiding them to a 7–3 record before losing in the divisional round of the playoffs 37–21 to the DC Defenders.

On January 1, 2024, it was announced that the Sea Dragons would be disbanding. Eight teams from competing spring football leagues, the XFL and USFL, merged into the United Football League going into the 2024 season; the Sea Dragons were not one of the teams selected for the merger.

<text>Herman Edwards Jr. (born April 27, 1954) is an American football coach and former player. He played cornerback in the National Football League (NFL) for ten seasons, primarily with the Philadelphia Eagles. Edwards was also a head coach in the NFL from 2001 to 2008 with the New York Jets and Kansas City Chiefs. Following the conclusion of his NFL coaching career, Edwards was a football analyst at ESPN from 2009 to 2017. He later served as the head coach of the Arizona State Sun Devils from 2018 to 2022.

As a player, Edwards is known for scoring the game-winning touchdown off a fumble recovery in 1978&#x27;s Miracle at the Meadowlands. During his NFL coaching tenure, he reached the playoffs four times, three times with the Jets and once with the Chiefs. His most successful season was in 2002 when he led the Jets to a division title, which is the franchise&#x27;s most recent. Edwards became popular as a coach and broadcaster for short, punchy declarations dubbed &quot;Hermisms&quot; by fans. The message &quot;You play to win the game!&quot;, which he delivered during a Jets press conference, would become the title of his self-help book.

==Early life==
Edwards was born on an Army base in Eatontown, New Jersey, the son of an American World War II veteran and his German wife. He graduated from Monterey High School in Monterey, California. Edwards played college football at the University of California, Berkeley in 1972 and 1974, at junior college Monterey Peninsula College in 1973, and at San Diego State University (SDSU) in his senior year, 1975. He graduated from SDSU with a degree in criminal justice. He helped promote Monterey County Special Olympics for several years. His public involvement helped educate Monterey County residents about the importance of athletics with the developmentally disabled.

==Playing career==
In the National Football League (NFL), Edwards played nine seasons with the Philadelphia Eagles from 1977 to 1985, making a championship appearance with the team in Super Bowl XV. His 33 career interceptions are just one short of the franchise record. He never missed a game in his nine seasons with the Eagles, remaining active with the team for 135 consecutive regular season games until being cut by incoming head coach Buddy Ryan in 1986. Edwards went on to play briefly for the Los Angeles Rams and Atlanta Falcons in 1986 before announcing his retirement.

The highlight of Edwards&#x27; playing career occurred in the twelfth game of the 1978 season, in the final seconds of a game against the New York Giants at the Meadowlands on November 19. The Giants led 17–12 and the Eagles had no time-outs remaining, but instead of simply taking the snap from center and kneeling, Giants quarterback Joe Pisarcik attempted to hand the ball off to running back Larry Csonka. However, the ball came loose and Edwards picked it up and returned it for a touchdown, enabling the Eagles to win This play became known in Philadelphia as &quot;The Miracle at the Meadowlands&quot; and in New York City as simply &quot;The Fumble.&quot; The Eagles made the playoffs and the Giants finished at 

Philadelphia&#x27;s implementation of the victory formation, which was designed as a result of “The Miracle at the Meadowlands”, was known as the &quot;Herman Edwards play.&quot;

==Coaching career==

===Early years===
After his playing career ended, Edwards became a defensive assistant at San Jose State (1987–1989), then was an NFL scout and defensive backs coach with the Kansas City Chiefs (1990–1995), for former Browns, Chiefs, Redskins, and Chargers coach Marty Schottenheimer. With the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (1996–2000), he was a defensive backs/assistant head coach under Tony Dungy. On January 28, 2001, Edwards was hired as head coach of the New York Jets.

===New York Jets ===
In his five years as the Jets head coach, Edwards compiled a regular season record, including a stretch during his final twenty regular season games with the club, and a record in the playoffs. Edwards decided to run a 4–3 &quot;Cover 2&quot; defense. Although many fans and players questioned Edwards&#x27; decisions, the Jets had mild success in Edwards&#x27; first two seasons, reaching the playoffs in both. The Jets were the sixth seed in 2001, losing on the road in the first round to the Oakland Raiders . In 2002, the Jets squeaked into the playoffs with a record, due to winning the tie-breakers in a three-way tie for the AFC East Division lead with the New England Patriots and the Miami Dolphins. The Jets advanced through the Wildcard round this time, which led to a return trip to Oakland. Once again, Edwards and the Jets came up short, losing to the Raiders. Following a disappointing season in 2003, the Jets reached the divisional round of the AFC playoffs once more in 2004, where they lost to the Pittsburgh Steelers In 2005, a year marred by injuries, inconsistent play, lack of player development, and rumors swirling about Edwards possibly leaving the organization, Edwards led the Jets to a woeful record. Following the end of the season, the Jets made the highly unusual move of trading a coach—Edwards—to another team (the Kansas City Chiefs), in exchange for a player to be chosen in round four of the 2006 draft. Overall, Edwards&#x27; tenure as head coach of the Jets was marred by chronic clock management problems, an ultra-conservative &quot;play not to lose&quot; mentality, and a lack of any discernible defensive philosophy, despite Edwards&#x27; supposed expertise in the Cover 2 defense. The Jets replaced Edwards by hiring Eric Mangini, a senior assistant coach with the New England Patriots.

====Departure from New York====
Following the 2005 season, Chiefs president Carl Peterson hinted to the press about interest in hiring Edwards that could have been considered tampering. The Jets granted permission to the Chiefs to speak with Edwards. At the time, Edwards had two years remaining on his contract with the Jets. However, Peterson wanted Edwards (a longtime personal acquaintance) to succeed head coach Dick Vermeil, who was Edwards&#x27; coach on the Eagles and had just retired.

As the rumors started swirling, a war of words between the two teams began to start up in the media. In the midst of all the speculation, Edwards tried to use what leverage he thought he had with the Jets to get a contract extension and hefty pay raise from the Jets, which only served to further anger the club&#x27;s owner. Eventually, the two teams worked out a deal, and the Chiefs sent the Jets a fourth-round pick in the 2006 NFL draft as compensation (the Jets later used this selection to take Leon Washington).

===Kansas City Chiefs===
Edwards&#x27; regular season coaching debut with the Chiefs was a home loss to the Cincinnati Bengals on September 10. His first win with Kansas City came in the third game of the season on October 1, a 41–0 shutout of the San Francisco 49ers.

The 2006 season would see many highs and lows. Starting quarterback Trent Green suffered a serious concussion in the first game of the season. Despite Green&#x27;s injury, the Chiefs continued to stay in contention, largely thanks to backup quarterback Damon Huard and Pro Bowl running back Larry Johnson. In a move some considered controversial, Edwards chose to sit Huard and start Green when he returned from injury. At the time, Huard&#x27;s performance at quarterback was one of the best in the league, having thrown 11 touchdowns and just one interception, averaging 7.7 yards per pass attempt, and posting a quarterback rating of 98.0 (2nd best rating in the NFL, second to only Peyton Manning).

Additionally, the Chiefs were in games started by Huard in 2006. Upon his return, Green struggled and failed to perform at the level of play that he had achieved in previous seasons, throwing seven touchdowns (against nine interceptions) and going as a starter. Green&#x27;s poor play led to Edwards placing more of the offensive burden on the shoulders of Larry Johnson, who ultimately ended up setting a record for rushing attempts in a season.

The Chiefs finished at 9–7, edging out the Denver Broncos (who lost in OT to the San Francisco 49ers in the final game of the season) by divisional tiebreaker for second place in the AFC West, and making the playoffs as the sixth seed in the AFC. This was their first playoff appearance since 2003.

On January 6, 2007, the Chiefs were soundly defeated by the Indianapolis Colts In the first half, the Chiefs offense failed to produce a single first down. This was the first time in the modern NFL era (post AFL–NFL merger), and the first time since 1960, that any team had been held without a first down in the first half of a playoff game.

In 2007, Edwards&#x27; streak of losses on opening day continued as the Chiefs lost to the Houston Texans This loss marked the first time since the opening day of the 1970 season that the Chiefs had lost by a margin of 17 points on opening day, and was the first time in a decade that the Chiefs had been held to three points or less on opening day. The Chiefs under Edwards ended the 2007 season 4–12 with a nine-game losing streak, which tied the then-longest losing streak in the history of the Chiefs franchise.

In the 2007 season, the Chiefs were plagued with quarterback, running back, kicker and offensive coaching controversies. Damon Huard started the season and compiled a 4–5 record. He was benched in favor of Edwards&#x27; 2006 draft choice Brodie Croyle, who split time with Huard mid-season, was injured, then finished most of the season. Croyle played in a total of nine games and did not win any. Running back Larry Johnson injured his foot mid-season and was replaced by Priest Holmes who came out of retirement late in the year and was ineffective, averaging just three yards per carry and recording no touchdowns.

Kicker Justin Medlock was Edwards&#x27; draft choice but was cut after the first game and replaced by Dave Rayner. He was cut late in the year and replaced with John Carney. Finally, after promoting Mike Solari from offensive line coach to offensive coordinator in 2007, Edwards fired Solari and replaced him with Chan Gailey in early 2008. He also fired his offensive line coach, receivers coach, and running backs coach.

Chiefs owner Clark Hunt set the tone for the 2008 season by expressing his support for Edwards and general manager Carl Peterson and their plan to rebuild the team. However, Clark did warn that he expected the Chiefs to be competitive for a playoff spot.

In an attempt to rebuild the team, the Chiefs cut numerous aging veterans in the offseason, and the team traded Pro Bowl defensive end Jared Allen to the Minnesota Vikings. As a result, Edwards fielded one of the youngest teams in the NFL. Edwards&#x27; streak of opening day defeats continued as the Chiefs lost to the New England Patriots , a defeat mostly overshadowed by Patriots quarterback Tom Brady suffering a season-ending injury off a low hit by Chiefs safety Bernard Pollard. The team eventually skidded to a franchise record of 12 consecutive regular-season defeats. The Chiefs finally ended the streak after defeating the Denver Broncos 33–19 at home on September 28. However, they were defeated the following week at the Carolina Panthers. During that game, the Chiefs managed to gain only 127 total yards, which was their worst offensive performance in 22 years. In a game against the San Diego Chargers on November 9, Edwards opted to go for a 2-point conversion to win (rather than tie the game) after the Chiefs has scored a touchdown to bring the score to 20–19. The controversial decision backfired, as the two-point conversion attempt failed, resulting in another loss. He was fired January 23, 2009.

===ESPN===
Edwards was hired in 2009 to be an analyst for the network&#x27;s &quot;NFL Live&quot; program.

===Arizona State===

On December 3, 2017, Edwards was named the head coach of the Arizona State football team. Edwards earned his first win with Arizona State on September 1, 2018, against the UTSA Roadrunners. He earned his first win against a ranked opponent on September 8, 2018, against the 15th-ranked Michigan State Spartans. Arizona State finished with a 7–6 record in Edwards&#x27; first season.

The 2019 season began with Edwards choosing true freshman Jayden Daniels to quarterback the Sun Devils. Arizona State would start the season with a 3–0 record, including Edwards&#x27; second consecutive win over a ranked Michigan State Spartans team. The team finished 8–5 with a Sun Bowl victory against the Florida State Seminoles.

On June 16, 2021, ASU confirmed that NCAA is investigating the football program over recruiting high school players during the COVID-19 dead period in 2020. Throughout the course of the 2021 season, multiple assistant coaches were placed on administrative leave. After the 2021 season had ended, multiple coaches including Zak Hill and Antonio Pierce resigned. 17 players including quarterback Jayden Daniels, wide receiver Johnny Wilson, and All-American linebacker Eric Gentry, entered the transfer portal as a result of the investigation and NIL. Despite the mass exodus, Edwards remained as head coach for the Sun Devils. On September 18, 2022, Arizona State fired Edwards the day following a 30–21 loss to the Eastern Michigan Eagles.

While his tenure included some on-field successes, it was marred by significant controversy and violations of NCAA regulations.

==== NCAA violations and show-cause penalty ====
In 2021, reports surfaced about potential recruiting violations under Edwards&#x27; during the COVID-19 pandemic. The allegations included hosting recruits on campus during a dead period, which was a direct violation of NCAA rules established to ensure fairness and health safety during the pandemic. These infractions indicated a systemic disregard for NCAA regulations and a culture of non-compliance within the program.

Following a detailed investigation, the NCAA found substantial evidence of these violations, leading to significant penalties for Edwards and ASU. On May 11, 2023, the NCAA issued a show cause penalty against Edwards, severely impacting his career and reputation. The show cause order essentially prohibits any NCAA member school from hiring Edwards unless it can demonstrate to the NCAA Committee on Infractions why it should be allowed to do so despite his involvement in major violations. This penalty is among the most severe sanctions the NCAA can impose on an individual coach.

==&quot;Hermisms&quot;==

Edwards is known for his motivational speeches and soundbites given at press conferences. The popularity of Edwards&#x27; motivational speaking has even led to the publication of his own book of quotes.

==Personal life==
Edwards was born in Fort Monmouth, New Jersey. Edwards is the son of Master Sergeant Herman Edwards Sr., and his wife, Martha. Edwards grew up in Seaside, California and attended Monterey High School.

Edwards graduated from San Diego State University with a degree in criminal justice. He and his wife Lia have two daughters, Gabrielle and Vivian. Edwards has a son, Marcus, from a previous relationship.

Edwards has a &quot;tradition&quot; of not watching the Super Bowl until he himself participates in one. Edwards did not even watch his friends Tony Dungy and Lovie Smith participate in Super Bowl XLI. Dungy had a tradition much like what Edwards does, that is, with the exceptions of Dungy&#x27;s victories in both Super Bowls XIII and XLI. Edwards broke that tradition when, to serve in his capacity as an analyst for ESPN, he watched Super Bowl XLIV in 2010.

Edwards has a strict workout regimen that has him in the gym at 5:00 AM six days a week. Instead of wearing athletic sneakers with his coaching attire, Edwards wears dress shoes. Before every game, Edwards polishes the shoes himself.

Known widely for his enthusiasm and faith-based personality, Edwards was born and raised Baptist, but converted with his family and is now a practicing Catholic.

Edwards appeared in the 2012 episode &quot;Broke&quot;, about the high rates of bankruptcy and poor financial decisions amongst professional athletes, part of ESPN&#x27;s &quot;30 for 30&quot; series of sports documentaries. In 2013, Edwards served as a head coach in the NFLPA Collegiate Bowl. Herm was named senior adviser to the proposed Major League Football in 2015.

<doc id="1331655" wikidata="Q3591778" url="?curid=1331655" title="Dew pond">
<text>A dew pond is an artificial pond usually sited on the top of a hill, intended for watering livestock. Dew ponds are used in areas where a natural supply of surface water may not be readily available. The name dew pond (sometimes cloud pond or mist pond) is first found in the &quot;Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society&quot; in 1865. Despite the name, their primary source of water is believed to be rainfall rather than dew or mist.

==Construction==

They are usually shallow, saucer-shaped and lined with puddled clay, chalk or marl on an insulating straw layer over a bottom layer of chalk or lime. To deter earthworms from their natural tendency of burrowing upwards, which in a short while would make the clay lining porous, a layer of soot would be incorporated or lime mixed with the clay. The clay is usually covered with straw to prevent cracking by the sun and a final layer of chalk rubble or broken stone to protect the lining from the hoofs of sheep or cattle. To retain more of the rainfall, the clay layer could be extended across the catchment area of the pond. If the pond&#x27;s temperature is kept low, evaporation (a major water loss) may be significantly reduced, thus maintaining the collected rainwater. According to researcher Edward Martin, this may be attained by building the pond in a hollow, where cool air is likely to gather, or by keeping the surrounding grass long to enhance heat radiation. As the water level in the basin falls, a well of cool, moist air tends to form over the surface, restricting evaporation.

A method of constructing the base layer using chalk puddle was described in &quot;The Field&quot; 14 December 1907. 
A Sussex farmer born in 1850 tells how he and his forefathers made dew ponds:
The initial supply of water after construction has to be provided by the builders, using artificial means. A preferred method was to arrange to finish the excavation in winter, so that any fallen snow could be collected and heaped into the centre of the pond to await melting.

==History==

The mystery of dew ponds has drawn the interest of many historians and scientists, but until recent times there has been little agreement on their early origins. It was widely believed that the technique for building dew ponds has been understood from the earliest times, as Kipling tells us in &quot;Puck of Pook&#x27;s Hill&quot;: &quot;…the Flint Men made the Dewpond under Chanctonbury Ring.&quot; The two Chanctonbury Hill dew ponds were dated, from flint tools excavated nearby and similarity to other dated earthworks, to the neolithic period. Landscape archaeology too seemed to demonstrate that they were used by the inhabitants of the nearby hill fort (probably from an earlier date than that of the surviving late Bronze Age structure) for watering cattle. A more prosaic assessment from Maud Cunnington, an archaeologist from Wiltshire, while not ruling out a prehistoric origin, describes such positive interpretations of the available evidence as no more than “flights of fancy”. 

A strong claim to antiquity may, however, be made for at least one Wiltshire dew pond: A land deed dated 825 CE mentions Oxenmere () at Milk Hill, Wiltshire, showing that dew ponds were in use during the Saxon period. The parliamentary enclosures of the mid eighteenth to mid nineteenth centuries caused many new upland ponds to be made, as access to traditional sources of drinking water for livestock was cut off. The suggestion has also been made that the nursery rhyme about Jack and Jill may refer to collecting water from a dew pond at the top of a hill, rather than from a well.

The naturalist Gilbert White, writing in 1788, noted that during extended periods of summer drought the artificial ponds on the downs above his native Selborne, Hampshire, retained their water, despite supplying flocks of sheep, while larger ponds in the valley below had dried up. In 1877 H. P. Slade observed that this was because the lower ponds have debris washed into them from surface water drainage, making them shallow, but the higher ones do not: the smaller volume of water is depleted more rapidly. Later observations demonstrated that during a night of favourable dew formation a typical increase in water level of some two or three inches was possible. However, there remains controversy about the means of replenishment of dew ponds. Experiments conducted in 1885 to determine the origin of the water found that dew forms not from dampness in the air but from moisture in the ground directly beneath the site of the condensation: dew, therefore, was ruled out as a source of replenishment. Other scientists have pointed out that the 1885 experiments failed to take into account the insulating effect of the straw and the cooling effect of the damp clay: the combined effect would be to keep the pond at a lower temperature than the surrounding earth and thus able to condense a disproportionate share of moisture.
In turn these conclusions were disproved in the 1930s, when it was pointed out that the heat-retaining quality of water (its thermal capacity) was many times greater than that of earth, and therefore the air above a pond in summer would be the last place to attract condensation. The deciding factor, it was concluded, is the extent of the saucer-shaped basin extending beyond the pond itself: the large basin would collect more rainfall than a pond created without such a surrounding feature.

Dew ponds are still common on the downlands of southern England, the North Derbyshire and Staffordshire moorlands, and in Nottinghamshire.

==Measuring dew production==
The first scientific experiments to measure and correlate the rate of dew deposit with evaporation were made by Harry Pool Slade of Aston Upthorpe, Berkshire, between June 1876 and February 1877, at a dew pond on Aston Upthorpe Downs (). Slade measured overnight dew deposit (by weighing cotton wool when dry and after overnight exposure), evaporation from copper pans beside the pond, the depletion of the pond, and relative humidity. He found that on days with heavy overnight dewfall the level of water in the pond was not replenished but invariably diminished.
In situ measurements of evaporation and condensation were taken at the Helmfleeth dew pond in Poppenbüll municipality (Eiderstedt Peninsula in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany) using meteorological measuring instruments and a floating evaporation pan after Brockamp &amp; Werner (1970). These measurements proved the dew formation on the basis of temperature changes and the weather conditions. The Helmfleeth dew pond is part of the water supply for a marsh area and is still in use today.

==Reproductions of historical dew ponds==
In 2014, the traditional technique was verified by means of modern building material at reproductions of dew ponds in East Friesland. In this context, various techniques were tried in two terrestrial hollows. Commercially available PVC-film was used for the sealing and foam glass gravel for the insulation. The construction was carried out by craftsmen and the climatological analysis by Werner and Coldewey.

<text>Frederick Yeates Hurlstone (6 December 1800– 10 June 1869) was an English painter. He was celebrated for his historical, portrait, and genre works, particularly scenes of Spanish and Italian rustic life. Trained under Sir William Beechey and Sir Thomas Lawrence, he won prestigious medals at the Royal Academy before focusing on exhibitions with the Society of British Artists, where he served as president from 1835 until his death. Known for works like &quot;The Last Sigh of the Moor&quot; and &quot;Italian Boys Playing the National Game of Mora&quot;, Hurlstone drew inspiration from travels to Italy, Spain, and Morocco, shifting to a &quot;picaresco&quot; style influenced by Murillo and Velázquez. Despite his opposition to the Royal Academy&#x27;s management, he remained a prolific and influential figure, contributing over 300 works to exhibitions and earning international recognition, including a gold medal at the 1855 Exposition Universelle in Paris.

==Life==
Frederick Yeates Hurlstone was born in London on 6 December 1800, the eldest son by his second marriage of Thomas Y. Hurlstone, one of the proprietors of &quot;The Morning Chronicle&quot; (his great-uncle, Richard Hurleston, was a student of Joseph Wright of Derby). He began life in the office of his father&#x27;s journal, but, while still very young, became a pupil of Sir William Beechey, afterwards studying under Sir Thomas Lawrence, and Benjamin Haydon.

His first paid work was an altar-piece, painted in 1816, for which he received 20 pounds. In 1820 he was admitted as a student of the Royal Academy, where in 1822 he gained the silver medal for the best copy made in the school of painting, and in 1823 the gold medal for historical painting, the subject being &quot;The Contention between the Archangel Michael and Satan for the Body of Moses&quot;. He first exhibited in 1821, sending to the Royal Academy &quot;Le Malade Imaginaire&quot; and to the British Institution a &quot;View near Windsor&quot;. These were followed at the Academy in 1822 by &quot;The Return of the Prodigal Son&quot; and a portrait, in 1823 by five portraits, and in 1824 by his &quot;Archangel Michael&quot; and some more portraits.

One of his best early works was &quot;A Venetian Page with a Parrot&quot;, exhibited at the British Institution in 1824. In 1824 also he contributed &quot;The Bandit Chief&quot; to the first exhibition of the Society of British Artists. He continued to send portraits to the Royal Academy until 1830, but in 1831 he was elected a member of the Society of British Artists, after which he seldom exhibited elsewhere. He was chosen president in 1835, and again in 1840, retaining the office until his death. He contributed to the society&#x27;s exhibitions upwards of three hundred portraits and other works, among them being &quot;The Enchantress Armida&quot;, exhibited in 1831; &quot;Haidee aroused from her Trance by the sound of Music&quot;, 1834; &quot;Eros&quot;, 1836; &quot;Italian Boys playing at the National Game of Mora&quot; and the &quot;Prisoner of Chillon&quot;, 1837; &quot;The Scene in St. Peter&#x27;s, Rome, from Byron&#x27;s Deformed Transformed&quot;, 1839; &quot;The Convent of St. Isidore: the Monks giving away provisions&quot;, 1841; and a &quot;Scene in a Spanish Posada in Andalusia&quot;, 1843.

In 1844 and, for the last time, in 1845 he again sent portraits to the Academy. His subsequent works at the Society of British Artists included &quot;The Sons of Jacob bringing the blood-stained garment of Joseph to their Father&quot;, 1844; &quot;Salute, Signore&quot;, 1845; &quot;A Girl of Sorrento at a Well&quot;, 1847; &quot;Inhabitants of the Palace of the Cæsars—Rome in the Nineteenth Century&quot;, 1850; &quot;Columbus asking Alms at the Convent of La Rabida&quot;, 1853; &quot;The Last Sigh of the Moor&quot; (or &quot;Boabdil el Chico, mourning over the Fall of Granada, reproached by his Mother&quot;), 1854; and &quot;Margaret of Anjou and Edward, Prince of Wales, in the wood on their flight after the Battle of Hexham&quot;, 1860. Besides these may be noted &quot;The Eve of the Land which is still Paradise&quot; and &quot;Constance and Prince Arthur&quot;.

His later works, consisted mainly of Spanish and Italian rustic subjects, the outcome of several visits to Italy, Spain, and Morocco, made between 1835 and 1854. &quot;His best pictures date from this period.&quot; &quot;In the year 1836, in consequence of visiting Italy, Mr. Hurlstone in a great measure discontinued a style which had been attended with great success, and took to painting works in what Spaniards call the &#x27;picaresco&#x27; style – a style which includes beggar-boys and vagabonds of Murillo and Velasquez. In his groups of Italian boys and girls, Mr. Hurlstone has given representations of an uncluttered life; often of that beauty which is united with wilderness, and this without the vulgarity with which such subjects are too often treated. In 1841, and again in 1852, he somewhat varied his subjects, by drawing his resources from Spain, which country he visited those years; but his style of treatment remained essentially the same. In the year 1854 the painter visited Morocco, and while in that semi-bararous locality, he painted several pictures, of which the principle on was a subject from the History of the Moors in Spain, entitled, &quot;Bobadil el Chico&quot; &quot;(the last king)&quot; &quot;Mourning over the Fall of Grenada, reproached by his Mother&quot;, which, together with his &quot;Italian Boys Playing the National Game of Mora&quot;, and his &quot;Constance and Arthur&quot; formed Mr. Hurlstone&#x27;s contributions to the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1855, when he received from the Emperor a gold medal of honour.&quot; Eleven of his best works were re-exhibited at the Society of British Artists in 1870.

Hurlstone was also a successful portrait painter, one of his best heads being that of Richard, seventh earl of Cavan, exhibited at the Society of British Artists in 1833, and again, together with that of General Sir John MacLeod, at the National Portrait Exhibition of 1868.

He was always much opposed to the constitution and management of the Royal Academy, and gave evidence before at the Parliamentary enquiry into the constitution of the Royal Academy in 1835 and again in 1836 to the select committee of the House of Commons. Hurlstone never became a member of the Royal Academy. He was elected president of the Royal Society of British Artists in 1835 and held the office until his death sending 326 works to their exhibitions.

Hurlstone died at 9 Chester Street, Belgravia, London, on 10 June 1869, in his sixty-ninth year, and was buried in Norwood cemetery.

===Family and descendants===

In 1836 Hurlstone married fellow artist Jane Coral who exhibited some watercolour drawings and portraits at the Royal Academy and the Society of British Artists between 1846 and 1850, but from 1850 to 1856 she contributed to the latter exhibition only fancy subjects in oil-colours. She died on 2 October 1858, leaving issue two sons, one of whom was also an artist. Hurlstone&#x27;s grandson, William Hurlstone, became a moderately well-known composer.

== Vegetarianism ==
Hurlstone made notable contributions to the early vegetarian movement in London, likely influenced by his wife, Jane Hurlstone. Their home at 9 Chester Street, Belgrave Square, hosted several early vegetarian society meetings, and Frederick served on the gentlemen&#x27;s committee of the London Vegetarian Association in 1854.

<doc id="1331672" wikidata="Q1452301" url="?curid=1331672" title="Vijaya Raje Scindia">
<text>Vijaya Raje Scindia (born Lekha Divyeshwari Devi; 12 October 1919 – 25 January 2001), known popularly as the Rajmata Scindia, was an Indian politician and consort of the last ruling Maharaja of Gwalior, Jiwajirao Scindia, in British Raj. In later life, she was elected repeatedly to both houses of the Indian parliament. She was one of the founding members of the Bharatiya Janata Party. William Dalrymple wrote in his 1998 book &quot;The Age of Kali&quot; that she had been called &quot;a madwoman and a saint; a dangerous reactionary and a national saviour; a stubborn and self-righteous old lunatic and a brave and resilient visionary.&quot;

==Early years==
Vijaya Raje Scindia was born in 1919 at Sagar in present-day Madhya Pradesh, the eldest child of &quot;Thakur&quot; Mahendra Singh of Kotla State (U.P.), a government officer, by his second wife, Chuda Devashwari Devi. She was named Lekha Divyeshwari Devi at birth. Her father was a deputy collector in the provincial administration. Her mother was the daughter of former Commander-in-chief of the Nepalese Army Khadga Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana, the nephew of founder of Rana dynasty of Nepal, Jang Bahadur Kunwar Rana. She died at Vijaya Raje&#x27;s birth. Her brother is Dhyanendra Singh, husband of Maya Singh.

==Personal life==
In February 1941, at the age of 22, Lekha was married to Jiwajirao Scindia, Maharaja of Gwalior, one of the largest, richest and highest-ranking princely states in India.

===Children===
Vijaya Raje and Jiwajirao had four daughters and a son:
#Padmavati Raje &#x27;Akkasaheb&#x27; Deb Barman (1942–64), who wed Kirit Bikram Kishore Deb Barman, the 185th ruling Maharaja of Tripura.
#Usha Raje Rana (born 1943), who wed Pashupati Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana of the Rana dynasty, Nepalese politician and grandson of the last Maharajah of Nepal. They are the parents of Devyani Rana and Urvashi Rana.
#Madhavrao Scindia (1945–2001), Indian politician belonging to the Indian National Congress and former Union Minister of Railways, Aviation and Human resources development, and the titular Maharaja of Gwalior. He is the father of Jyotiraditya Scindia.
#Vasundhara Raje (born 1953) BJP politician and a two-term Chief Minister of Rajasthan. She was formerly married to the titular Maharaja of Dholpur.
#Yashodhara Raje Scindia, formerly Sports Minister of Madhya Pradesh

==Politics==

Vijayaraje was initiated into electoral politics in 1957 when she contested and won the Guna Lok Sabha seat in Madhya Pradesh on a Congress ticket. Five years later, she won on a Congress ticket from Gwalior. Later, she quit the Congress and won the Guna seat in 1967 on Swatantra Party&#x27;s ticket. She soon joined Bharatiya Jan Sangh and resigned from Lok Sabha to take part in state politics. She won the Karera assembly seat in Madhya Pradesh as the Jan Sangh candidate in 1967 and actively engaged in state politics. Jan Sangh defied the Indira-wave in the 1971 Lok Sabha polls to win 3 seats in Gwalior region – Vijaya Raje Scindia from Bhind, Vajpayee from Gwalior and Madhavrao Scindia from Guna, though he later left the party. Vijayaraje Scindia did not contest Lok Sabha elections in 1977 and 1984 and lost to Indira Gandhi in Rae Bareli in 1980. In 1989, she won from Guna as member of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and retained the seat in 1991, 1996 and 1998. She did not contest the elections in 1999 due to old age. She was jailed by Indira Gandhi during the Emergency, ultimately sharing a cell with fellow Rajmata and MP, Gayatri Devi, in Tihar Jail. In the 1970s, Vijayraje and her son Madhavrao were involved in a public dispute over property. Animosities heightened due to their differing political ideologies.

Vijayaraje came to the forefront of the BJP leadership in 1980 when she was made one of its vice-presidents. She played a key role in popularizing the party&#x27;s Ram Janmabhoomi movement and was considered a hardliner. Following the demolition of the Babri Masjid in December 1992, she had declared that &quot;she could now die without any regret, for she had seen her dream come true.&quot; She remained a BJP vice-president until 1998 when she stepped down on health grounds and quit electoral politics. She died in January 2001.

<text>Sir William Beechey (12 December 175328 January 1839) was a British portraitist during the golden age of British painting.

==Early life==

Beechey was born at Burford, Oxfordshire, on 12 December 1753, the son of William Beechey, a solicitor, and his wife Hannah Read. Both parents died when he was still quite young in the early 1760s, and he and his siblings were brought up by his uncle Samuel, a solicitor who lived in nearby Chipping Norton.

The uncle was determined that the young Beechey should likewise follow a career in the law, and at an appropriate age he was entered as a clerk with a conveyancer near Stow-on-the-Wold. But as &quot;The Monthly Mirror&quot; later recorded in July 1798, he was: &quot;Early foredoomed his [uncle&#x27;s] soul to cross/ And paint a picture where he should engross&quot;.

==Career==
Beechey was admitted to the Royal Academy Schools in 1772, where he is thought to have studied under Johan Zoffany. He first exhibited at the Academy in 1776. His earliest surviving portraits are small-scale full-length and conversation pieces which are reminiscent of Zoffany. In 1782, he moved to Norwich, where he gained several commissions, including a portrait of John Wodehouse and a series of civic portraits for St. Andrew&#x27;s Hall, Norwich. By 1787, he had returned to London, and in 1789, he exhibited a celebrated portrait of John Douglas, Bishop of Carlisle (now in Lambeth Palace). Beechey&#x27;s career during this period is marked by a succession of adept and restrained portraits in the tradition of Joshua Reynolds.
Beechey&#x27;s style perfectly suited the conventional taste of the royal family, and in 1793, he was commissioned to paint a full-length portrait of Queen Charlotte and subsequently named as her official portrait painter. That same year, he was elected as an associate member of the Royal Academy.

Following his royal appointment, the number of royal commissions he undertook increased markedly, and in 1797 he exhibited six royal portraits. In 1798, he was elected a full member of the Royal Academy and painted &quot;George III and the Prince of Wales Reviewing Troops&quot; for that year&#x27;s academy&#x27;s exhibition. This enormous composition depicts King George III, the Prince of Wales and staff officers on horseback at an imagined cavalry review in Hyde Park. The king was reported to be delighted with the painting and rewarded Beechey with a knighthood.

Joseph Farington&#x27;s Diaries give many accounts of Beechey&#x27;s relations with the royal family during this period, including his temporary fall from favour in 1804, which Farington attributes to the vagaries of George III&#x27;s mental condition.

Beechey&#x27;s portraits of the turn of the century are considered to be his most colourful and lively. They are closer to the flamboyant and free techniques employed by his younger rivals, John Hoppner and Sir Thomas Lawrence.

Royal patronage resumed in around 1813, when Beechey was appointed portrait painter to Prince William Frederick, Duke of Gloucester, and culminated with his appointment in 1830 as principal portrait painter to William IV. In 1830, he stood for election as President of the Royal Academy following the death of Thomas Lawrence, finishing second to Martin Archer Shee. In 1836, Beechey retired to Hampstead and on 9–11 June that year, the contents of his studio along with his collection were sold at Christie&#x27;s.

Although capable of impetuousness and irascibility, Beechey was known for his generosity to students. In particular, he took a close interest in the career of the young John Constable.

==Subjects==

During a prolific career spanning half a century, Beechey painted many of the leading figures of his day. His sitters included:
In his 1978 novel &quot;Desolation Island,&quot; Patrick O&#x27;Brian wrote that Capt. Jack Aubrey had been painted by Beechey. The portrait, which showed Aubrey in Royal Navy uniform wearing the insignia of the Order of the Bath, hung in his home, Ashgrove Cottage.

==Family==
William Beechey&#x27;s first marriage was to Mary Ann Jones (c. 1760–1793) in 1772 (other sources say 1778). Their children included British painter and Egyptologist Henry William Beechey (1788–1862).

Following his first wife&#x27;s death, Beechey married the successful miniature painter Anne Phyllis Jessop (1764–1833) in 1793. They had many children together, including: Royal Navy captain, geographer, and politician Frederick William Beechey (1796–1856); painter George Duncan Beechey (1798–1852); clergyman St. Vincent Beechey (1806–1899); and painter and admiral in the British navy Richard Brydges Beechey (1808–1895).

==Prices at auction==
Beechey&#x27;s &quot;Portrait of James Watt&quot; sold for £153,440 at Sotheby&#x27;s on 20 March 2003. His &quot;Portrait of Mirza Abu&#x27;l Hassan Khan, Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the Court of King George III&quot; sold for £181,600 at Christie&#x27;s on 8 June 2006. His &quot;Portrait of George Douglas, 16th Earl of Morton in the dress of the Royal Company of Archers&quot; sold for £481,250 at Christie&#x27;s on 5 July 2011. His portrait of &quot;The Dashwood Children&quot; sold at auction for $821,000 including premium at Christie&#x27;s on 29 January 2014.

==Gallery==
Beechey&#x27;s works are represented in many of the world&#x27;s leading collections, including the Louvre, the Smithsonian Institution, the Royal Collection, the Royal Academy of Arts, the National Portrait Gallery, London, the Tate and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

==Coat of arms==
Beechey was granted arms on 16 February 1829.

<doc id="1331702" wikidata="Q909194" url="?curid=1331702" title="Inhalational anesthetic">
<text>An inhalational anesthetic is a chemical compound possessing general anesthetic properties that is delivered via inhalation. They are administered through a face mask, laryngeal mask airway or tracheal tube connected to an anesthetic vaporiser and an anesthetic delivery system. Agents of significant contemporary clinical interest include volatile anesthetic agents such as isoflurane, sevoflurane and desflurane, as well as certain anesthetic gases such as nitrous oxide and xenon.

==List of inhalational anaesthetic agents==

===Currently-used agents===
* Desflurane
* Isoflurane
* Nitrous oxide
* Sevoflurane
* Xenon

===Previously-used agents===
Although some of these are still used in clinical practice and in research, the following anaesthetic agents are primarily of historical interest in developed countries:

* Acetylene
* Chloroethane (ethyl chloride)
* Chloroform
* Cryofluorane
* Cyclopropane
* Diethyl ether
* Divinyl ether
* Enflurane
* Ethylene
* Fluroxene
* Halothane (still widely used in the developing world and is on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines)
* Methoxyflurane (still used currently as an analgesic)
* Methoxypropane
* Trichloroethylene
* Vinyl chloride

===Never-marketed agents===
* Aliflurane
* Halopropane
* Norflurane
* Roflurane
* Synthane
* Teflurane

==Volatile anaesthetics==

Volatile anaesthetic agents share the property of being liquid at room temperature, but evaporating easily for administration by inhalation. The volatile anesthetics used in the developed world today include: Desflurane, isoflurane and sevoflurane. Other agents widely used in the past include ether, chloroform, enflurane, halothane, methoxyflurane. All of these agents share the property of being quite hydrophobic (i.e., as liquids, they are not freely miscible with water, and as gases they dissolve in oils better than in water).

The ideal volatile anaesthetic agent offers smooth and reliable induction and maintenance of general anaesthesia with minimal effects on non-target organ systems. In addition it is odorless or pleasant to inhale; safe for all ages and in pregnancy; not metabolised; rapid in onset and offset; potent; safe for exposure to operating room staff; and has a long shelf life. It is also cheap to manufacture; easy to transport and store; easy to administer and monitor with standard operating room equipment; stable to light, plastics, metals, rubber and soda lime; and non-flammable and environmentally safe. None of the agents currently in use are ideal, although many have some of the desirable characteristics. For example, sevoflurane is pleasant to inhale and is rapid in onset and offset. It is also safe for all ages. However, it is expensive (approximately 3 to 5 times more expensive than isoflurane), and approximately half as potent as isoflurane.

==Gases==
Other gases or vapors which produce general anaesthesia by inhalation include nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide, cyclopropane, and xenon. These are stored in gas cylinders and administered using flowmeters, rather than vaporisers. Cyclopropane is explosive and is no longer used for safety reasons, although otherwise it was found to be an excellent anaesthetic. Xenon is odorless (odourless) and rapid in onset, but is expensive and requires specialized equipment to administer and monitor. Nitrous oxide, even at 80% concentration, does not quite produce surgical level anaesthesia in most people at standard atmospheric pressure, so it must be used as an adjunct anaesthetic, along with other agents.

==Hyperbaric anaesthesia==
Under conditions (pressures above normal atmospheric pressure), other gases such as nitrogen, and noble gases such as argon, krypton, and xenon become anaesthetics. When inhaled at high partial pressures (more than about 4 bar, encountered at depths below about 30 metres in scuba diving), nitrogen begins to act as an anaesthetic agent, causing nitrogen narcosis. However, the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) for nitrogen is not achieved until pressures of about 20 to 30 atm (bar) are attained. Argon is slightly more than twice as anaesthetic as nitrogen per unit of partial pressure (see argox). Xenon however is a usable anaesthetic at 80% concentration and normal atmospheric pressure.

==Endogenous analogous==
Endogenous analogs of inhaled anesthetics are compounds that the body produces and that have the properties and similar mode of action of inhaled anesthetics. Among the gases in the human body, carbon dioxide is among the most abundant and produces anesthesia from insects to humans. anesthesia was first demonstrated to the king of France in the early 1800s by Henry Hill Hickman. Initially was thought to work through anoxia, but in the early 1900, increased in the lung showed a dramatic increase oxygenation of the brain disproving the anoxia argument. Prior to the development of modern anesthetics, was used extensively by psychiatrists in a treatment called carbon dioxide inhalation therapy.

==Neurological theories of action==


The full mechanism of action of volatile anaesthetic agents is unknown and has been the subject of intense debate. &quot;Anesthetics have been used for 160 years, and how they work is one of the great mysteries of neuroscience,&quot; says anaesthesiologist James Sonner of the University of California, San Francisco. Anaesthesia research &quot;has been for a long time a science of untestable hypotheses,&quot; notes Neil L. Harrison of Cornell University.

&quot;Most of the injectable anesthetics appear to act on a single molecular target,&quot; says Sonner. &quot;It looks like inhaled anesthetics act on multiple molecular targets. That makes it a more difficult problem to pick apart.&quot;

The possibility of anaesthesia by the inert gas argon in particular (even at 10 to 15 bar) suggests that the mechanism of action of volatile anaesthetics is an effect best described by physical chemistry, and not a chemical bonding action. However, the agent may bind to a receptor with a weak interaction. A physical interaction such as swelling of nerve cell membranes from gas solution in the lipid bilayer may be operative. Notably, the gases hydrogen, helium, and neon have not been found to have anaesthetic properties at any pressure. Helium at high pressures produces nervous irritation (&quot;anti-anaesthesia&quot;), suggesting that the anaesthetic mechanism(s) may be operated in reverse by this gas (i.e., nerve membrane compression). Also, some halogenated ethers (such as flurothyl) also possess this &quot;anti-anaesthetic&quot; effect, providing further evidence for this theory.

==History==
Paracelsus developed an inhalational anaesthetic in 1540. He used sweet oil of vitriol (prepared by Valerius Cordus and named &quot;Aether&quot; by Frobenius): used to feed fowl: “it was taken even by chickens and they fall asleep from it for a while but awaken later without harm”. Subsequently, about 40 years later, in 1581, Giambattista Delia Porta demonstrated the use of ether on humans although it was not employed for any type of surgical anesthesia.

In modern medicine, Dr. Horace Wells used nitrous oxide for his own dental extraction in 1844. However his attempt to replicate these results at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) resulted in a partial anesthetic and was deemed a failure.

William T.G. Morton is credited with successfully demonstrating surgical anesthesia for the first time on October 16, 1846, at MGH. Following this event, the use of ether and other volatile anesthetics became widespread in Western medicine.

After the experiments and publications by the Scottish obstetrician James Young Simpson in late 1847, chloroform became the first widespread halocarbon anaesthetic. Chloroform is a much stronger and effective anaesthetic than ether, it is non-inflammable and it did not irritate the airways, unlike ether.

First non-gaseous inhalational anaesthetics such as ether and chloroform were inhaled from a handkerchief which the liquid was poured on and allowed to evaporate. Concerns about the dosage of chloroform lead to development of various inhalers.

<text>John Hulse (15 March 1708 – 14 December 1790) was an English clergyman. He is now known mainly as the founder of the series of Hulsean Lectures at the University of Cambridge.

==Early life==
John Hulse was born at Middlewich, in Cheshire, the eldest of nineteen children from Thomas Hulse of Elworth Hall, Sandbach and Anne Webb of Middlewich. After attending Congleton grammar school, he entered St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge in 1724 at the age of sixteen and graduated B.A. in 1728.

==Career==
In 1732 he was ordained and served small cures, first at Yoxall, Staffordshire, and afterwards at Goostrey, a chapel under Sandbach. In 1733 he married Mary Hall of Hermitage and had a son. On the death of his father in 1753 he inherited Elworth.

==Personal life==
In 1733 he married Mary Hall of Hermitage and they had one son Edward, who died at age 22.

==Death==
Due to delicate health, Hulse resigned his clerical duties and lived there in seclusion until his death. He was buried in the parish church of Middlewich. The fullest account of his life appears to be the memoir prefixed to Richard Parkinson&#x27;s 1837 Hulsean lectures, &quot;Rationalism and Revelation&quot;.

==Will==
Hulse&#x27;s will, dated 21 July 1777, is a curious and very lengthy document. It may be read in full in Cambridge University statutes. He bequeathed his estates to Cambridge University for the advancement and reward of religious learning, to be applied, first, to maintain two divinity scholars at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge; secondly, to found a prize for a dissertation; thirdly, to found and support the office of Christian advocate; and fourthly, that of the Hulsean lecturer or Christian preacher. Later editions of the endowments detail changes made in 1830 and 1860.
The latest version of the statutes and ordinances are now available online at the Cambridge University web site. The Hulsean Fund is &quot;Statute E, Chapter VI&quot; and is discussed in the Ordinances &quot;Chapter 12, Trust Emoluments, Section 2&quot;.

===Christian Advocate===
By a statute in 1860 the Hulsean professorship of divinity was substituted for the office of Christian-advocate.

===Hulsean Lectures===
The Hulsean Lectures were originally to be given by a clergyman in the University, holding the degree of Master of Arts, who was under the age of forty years.
Though the will made provisions for the lectureship, the funds were not sufficient to begin the lectures until 1820. In 1830 the number of annual lectures or sermons was reduced from twenty to eight; after 1861 they were further reduced to a minimum of four.

<text>Goldau is a town in the community of Arth, canton of Schwyz, Switzerland. It lies between the Rigi and Rossberg mountains, and between lakes Zug and Lauerz. 
Well known attractions include the Natur- und Tierpark Goldau and the Arth-Goldau valley station of the Arth-Rigi Bahn connecting to the Rigi mountain.

Goldau is primarily known in Switzerland for its historic landslide, the &quot;Goldau landslide&quot; (&quot;Goldauer Bergsturz&quot;) of 1806 which killed 457 people. It is also known for its importance for the Swiss railways network, with Arth-Goldau station forming the intersection between the Gotthard, Lucerne, Zug–Zürich and Pfäffikon lines.

==Goldau landslide==
There were numerous historical landslides in Goldau, with a major event, more significant than the 1806 landslide, dated to the 14th century.
The toponym itself, first recorded in 1353, refers to the remnants of these landslides, from a dialectal &quot;gol&quot;, &quot;goleten&quot; &quot;gravel, rubble, debris&quot;.

On September 2, 1806 heavy rains triggered a landslide from the Rossberg which destroyed Goldau and the adjacent villages of Buosingen, Röthen and Lauerz. The landslide comprised of material, with a mass of .

Part of the mass hit Lake Lauerz (which had been created by an even larger landslide in the 14th century), and the resulting tsunami-like displacement wave caused more devastation towards Seewen. The event destroyed 111 houses, 220 barns, and two churches in a disaster area of about , parts of which were covered with debris to a height of . It resulted in the confirmed death of 457 people.

The disaster inspired the epic poem &quot;Goldau&quot; by American writer John Neal in 1818. A museum outside the Natur- und Tierpark exhibits findings and photos of the event.

<text>Prince Kazimierz Nestor Sapieha (1757–1798) was a Polish-Lithuanian noble (szlachcic) and one of the creators of the 3 May Constitution.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Kazimierz Sapieha was educated at the Knight School in Warsaw from 1767 until 1771, and later studied in Italy. Upon his return, he served as Artillery General of Lithuania, from 1773 to 1793. As Deputy from Brzesc Litewski, he participated in several Sejms. Most notably, from 1790, he participated in the Four-Year Sejm in Warsaw, and became Sejm Marshal from 6 October 1788, until 29 May 1792, and Marshal of the Lithuanian Confederation.

===Politics===
An early supporter of the magnate opposition to any liberalization (his uncle Hetman Franciszek Ksawery Branicki was its leader), Sapieha changed his position under the influence of Stanisław Małachowski, and became a supporter of reforms, and the 3 May Constitution. He strongly protested, when King Stanisław August Poniatowski joined the Targowica Confederation, and this so angered Sapieha, that he decided to leave Poland. He briefly settled in Dresden. After the outbreak of the Kościuszko Uprising, he returned to his homeland and participated in the uprising, holding the rank of an Artillery Captain. After the Uprising collapsed, he left Poland again and spent the rest of his life in exile in Vienna, where he died in 1798.

==Awards==
* Knight of the Order of the White Eagle, awarded on 1 January 1779.
