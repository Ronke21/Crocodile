<text>Winston Conrad &quot;Wink&quot; Martindale (born December 4, 1933) is an American disc jockey, radio personality, game show host, and television producer. He is best known for hosting &quot;Gambit&quot; from 1972 to 1976 (and again from 1980 to 1981), &quot;Tic-Tac-Dough&quot; from 1978 to 1985, &quot;High Rollers&quot; from 1987 to 1988, and &quot;Debt&quot; from 1996 to 1998.

==Career==
===Radio===
Martindale was born in Jackson, Tennessee, and started his career as a disc jockey at age 17 at WPLI in Jackson, earning $25 a week.

After moving to WTJS, he was hired away for double the salary by Jackson&#x27;s only other station, WDXI. He next hosted mornings at WHBQ in Memphis while a college student at Memphis State University, before graduating with a bachelor of science degree in 1957. While at U of M, Martindale became a member of Kappa Sigma fraternity.

On the evening of July 10, 1954, Martindale was showing the WHBQ studio to some friends when he realized that his colleague on the 9 p.m. to midnight shift, Dewey Phillips, was getting a large number of reactions from listeners after airing a new song. That song was Elvis Presley&#x27;s first record, &quot;That&#x27;s All Right.&quot; The song was recorded at Sam Phillips&#x27; recording studio on the evening of July 5, 1954. Sam, who had brought the record on July 6, was in the WHBQ studio on the first airing night and had Elvis&#x27; telephone number. DJ Dewey Phillips wanted to interview Elvis during his program, so Wink endeavored to contact Elvis, but Gladys Presley, Elvis&#x27;s mother, answered the phone and said Elvis was so nervous that he had gone to a movie theater. Gladys and her husband Vernon brought Elvis to WHBQ and Dewey interviewed Elvis without his knowing that he was on the air (Martindale reports that Elvis later admitted that he would have been unable to talk otherwise).

Martindale&#x27;s rendition of the spoken-word song &quot;Deck of Cards&quot; went to No. 7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart and sold over a million copies in 1959. It also peaked at no. 5 in the UK Singles Chart in April 1963, one of four visits to that chart. It was followed by &quot;Black Land Farmer.&quot; In 1959, he became morning man at KHJ in Los Angeles, California, moving a year later to the morning show at KRLA and finally to KFWB in 1962. He also had lengthy stays at KGIL (AM) from 1968 to 1971, KKGO-FM/KJQI and Gene Autry&#x27;s KMPC (now KSPN-AM) from 1971 to 1979 and again from 1983 to 1987, the short-lived &quot;Wink and Bill Show&quot; on KABC during 1989, and KJQI from 1993 to 1994. In 1967, Martindale acted in a short futuristic documentary film about home life in the year 1999 produced by the Philco-Ford Corporation which predicted, among other things, Internet commerce.

===Television===

Martindale&#x27;s first break into television was at WHBQ-TV in Memphis, as the host of &quot;Mars Patrol&quot;, a science-fiction themed children&#x27;s television series. At his tenure with WHBQ, Martindale became the host of the TV show &quot;Teenage Dance Party&quot;, where his friend Elvis Presley made an appearance on 16 June 1956. Following Presley&#x27;s death in 1977, Martindale aired a nationwide tribute radio special in his honor.

Martindale&#x27;s first game-show hosting job was on the show &quot;What&#x27;s This Song?&quot;, which he hosted for NBC (credited as &quot;Win Martindale&quot;) from 1964 to 1965. From 1970 to 1971, he hosted a similar song-recognition game show, &quot;Words and Music&quot;, again on NBC. His first major success came in 1972, when he took the emcee position on a new CBS game show, &quot;Gambit&quot;. He spent four years hosting the original &quot;Gambit&quot; and later hosted a Las Vegas-based revival for 13 months in 1980–81.

The emcee role for which Martindale is most widely known is on &quot;Tic-Tac-Dough&quot;. He was tapped by Barry &amp; Enright Productions to host the revived series in 1978 and stayed until 1985, presiding over one of the more popular game shows of the day. While hosting &quot;Tic-Tac-Dough&quot;, Martindale (along with fellow game show hosts Art James, Jack Clark and Jim Perry) made a cameo appearance in the 1980 TV movie &quot;The Great American Traffic Jam&quot; in a scene where the quartet played golf. During this time, Martindale decided to branch out and form his own production company, Wink Martindale Enterprises, so he could develop and produce his own game shows. His first venture was &quot;Headline Chasers&quot;, a co-production with Merv Griffin that premiered in 1985; Martindale had left &quot;Tic-Tac-Dough&quot; to host his creation, but the show did not meet with any success and was cancelled after its only season in 1986. Martindale&#x27;s next venture was more successful, as he created and, along with Barry &amp; Enright, co-produced the Canadian game show &quot;Bumper Stumpers&quot; for Global Television Network and USA Network. This series aired on both American and Canadian television from 1987 until 1990. In 1986, he launched a partnership with producer Jerry Gilden, Martindale/Gilden Productions, and it started off with a game show development contract with CBS. In 1988, Martindale/Gilden Productions secured the licensing rights from Parker Brothers to develop game shows based on Parker-owned properties such as &quot;Boggle&quot;.

After hosting two short-lived Merrill Heatter-produced game shows (a revival of &quot;High Rollers&quot; and the Canadian &quot;The Last Word&quot;), Martindale went back into producing and launched &quot;The Great Getaway Game&quot; on Travel Channel in 1990. Two years after that program went off the air, Martindale teamed up with Bill Hillier and The Family Channel to produce a series of &quot;interactive&quot; game shows that put an emphasis on home viewers being able to play along from home and win prizes. Four series were commissioned and Martindale served as host for all four. The first to premiere, on June 7, 1993, was &quot;Trivial Pursuit&quot;, an adaptation of the popular trivia-based board game. On March 7, 1994, the list-based &quot;Shuffle&quot; and &quot;Boggle&quot;, another board-game adaptation, premiered and were very different from &quot;Trivial Pursuit&quot;, which was presented more in a traditional game-show style. These two programs, along with the &quot;Jumble&quot;-based show that replaced &quot;Shuffle&quot; on June 13, 1994, after its initial 14-week run ended, were played more like the interactive games for the home viewers that were the focus of the block. Except for &quot;Trivial Pursuit&quot;, none of the interactive games were much of a success; &quot;Boggle&quot; ended on November 18, 1994, while &quot;Jumble&quot; came to an end on December 30, 1994. &quot;Trivial Pursuit&quot; ended on the same day as &quot;Jumble&quot;, but continued to air in reruns for some time afterward, finally being removed from the Family Channel schedule in July 1995.

In June 1996, Martindale became host of Lifetime&#x27;s highest-rated quiz show, &quot;Debt&quot;, which had debt-ridden contestants compete to try to eliminate their debts. Despite its popularity on cable, &quot;Debt&quot; was cancelled in 1998, for the reason more males were watching the show than females (the network&#x27;s target audience). Martindale did not host another game show for over a decade.

===Later career===
On June 2, 2006, Martindale received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 2007, he became a member of the nominating committee of the Hit Parade Hall of Fame. On October 13, 2007, Martindale was one of the first inductees into the American TV Game Show Hall of Fame in Las Vegas.

Martindale was one of the hosts featured in the 2002 NBC special &quot;Most Outrageous Game Show Moments&quot;, alongside Bob Eubanks, Jim Lange, Ben Stein, and Peter Marshall, but was not featured in any of the subsequent episodes ordered by the network.

Martindale has appeared in various TV commercials, including a stint as a pitchman for the travel website Orbitz. Until 2007, Martindale had a daily three-hour show on the syndicated &quot;Music of Your Life&quot; format, which is heard on around 200 radio stations. On June 2, 2009, Martindale signed with the syndicated Hit Parade Radio format. The format began operation on February 7, 2010, with Martindale as afternoon drive personality. The syndicator stopped operating on June 6, 2010.

In 2008, Wink appeared on &quot;GSN Live&quot;, an interstitial program during the afternoon block of classic game show reruns. Several times during 2008, Martindale filled in for Fred Roggin on &quot;GSN Live&quot; while Roggin was on vacation. Martindale&#x27;s last program was the GSN original series &quot;Instant Recall&quot;, which premiered on March 4, 2010. &quot;Instant Recall&quot; was the first show Martindale has hosted since &quot;Debt&quot; aired on Lifetime from 1996 to 1998.

In 2012, Martindale returned to radio, as host of &quot;The 100 Greatest Christmas Hits of All Time&quot;. The nationally syndicated show is produced by Envision Radio Networks.

In 2013, Martindale made a guest appearance on &quot;The Eric Andre Show&quot;; in an appearance typical for the show, he did the interview dressed in a motion-capture suit (at one point being, rather poorly, mocapped dancing), sang a song teaching kids their &quot;Jamaican ABCs,&quot; and promoted a drinkable mouthwash, called Scoap (pronounced &quot;sco-app&quot;).

In 2014, Martindale started his own YouTube channel featuring episodes of game shows, game show pilots, rare clips from various game shows, and more.

Martindale made a special guest appearance on the December 2, 2014, episode of the GSN show &quot;The Chase&quot; hosted by Brooke Burns and featuring Mark Labbett.

In October 2016, Martindale appeared on the daytime soap opera &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot;, as a minister.

On April 21, 2017, Martindale appeared in a KFC advertising campaign featuring Rob Lowe as astronaut Colonel Sanders giving a JFK speech spoof/homage about launching the Zinger chicken sandwich into space.

On April 4, 2018, Martindale served as &quot;surprise co-host&quot; (via phone) for Sirius XM NHL Network Radio&#x27;s &quot;Three Questions&quot; segment, where a celebrity co-host creates the questions and then quizzes the show&#x27;s broadcast crew.

On January 28, 2021, Martindale claimed on his Facebook page that he had one of the pilots for the ABC version of &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot; and would upload it when his YouTube channel hit 18,000 subscribers. When he hit his goal on July 19, 2021, the pilot was uploaded to his channel.

On June 6, 2021, Martindale began hosting the nationally and internationally syndicated &quot;The History of Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;, a two-hour weekend look back at music from the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. The production is created by a team composed of Martindale, producer/engineer Peter Jay Gould of The Intervale Group, and writer/producer Gary Theroux, who wrote and produced the 1978 52-hour marathon version of &quot;The History of Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; for Drake-Chenault. The new richly produced series combines songs, fun facts about the music and the artists, and artist interview soundbites.

== Personal life ==

Martindale married Madelyn Leech in 1954, with whom he had four children; the couple divorced in 1972. He later married his second wife, Sandy (née Ferra), on August 2, 1975.

He has a few dogs named after the various game shows he hosted.

He has also previously endorsed several conservative positions politically. His wife, Sandy, previously dated Elvis Presley. Both he and Sandy were friends with Presley. They have appeared on Sirius&#x27; Elvis Radio and shared stories about Presley.

<text>Swatch is a Swiss watch company founded in 1983 by Ernst Thomke, Elmar Mock, and Jacques Müller. It is a subsidiary of The Swatch Group. The Swatch product line was developed as a response to the &quot;quartz crisis&quot; of the 1970s and 1980s, in which inexpensive, battery-powered, quartz-regulated watches were competing against more established European watchmakers focused on artisanal craftsmanship producing mostly mechanical watches.

The name Swatch is a contraction of &quot;second watch,&quot; its concept of &quot;low-cost, high-tech, artistic and emotional&quot; watches marketed as casual, disposable accessories.

==History==

Swatch began development in the early 1980s under the leadership of the then ETA SA&#x27;s CEO Ernst Thomke with a small team of watch engineers led by Elmar Mock and Jacques Müller.

Conceived as a standard timekeeper in plastic, Franz Sprecher, a marketing consultant hired by Thomke to give the project an outsider&#x27;s consideration, sought to create a fashionable line of watches.

Swatch was originally intended to re-capture entry level market share lost by Swiss manufacturers of mechanical watches and the subsequent growth of Japanese companies such as Seiko and Citizen in the 1960s and 1970s. It was also meant to re-popularize analog watches at a time when digital watches had achieved wide popularity.

In 1983, the group hired Jacques Irniger—who formerly served as the marketing executive for Colgate and Nestlé—to launch the swatch.

The first collection of twelve Swatch models was introduced on 1 March 1983 in Zürich, Switzerland. Initially the price ranged from CHF 39.90 to CHF 49.90 but was standardized to CHF 50.00 in the autumn of the same year. Sales targets were set at one million timepieces for 1983 and 2.5 million for the year after. With an aggressive marketing campaign and relatively low price for a Swiss-made watch, it gained instant popularity in its home market.

Lebanese entrepreneur Nicolas G. Hayek, together with a group of Swiss investors, took over a majority shareholding of Swatch during 1985 in the newly consolidated group under the name Societe Suisse de Microelectronique et d&#x27;Horlogerie, or SMH. He became chairman of the board of directors and CEO in 1986. Later he changed the company&#x27;s name to Swatch Group.

This combination of marketing and manufacturing expertise restored Switzerland as a major player in the world wristwatch market. Synthetic materials were used for the watch cases as well as a new ultra-sonic welding process and assembly technology. In 1997, the Swatch Group opened about 60 stores worldwide.

===Product lines===

There are families under the Swatch brand:
====Swatch Originals====
The &quot;Originals&quot; are plastic-cased watches. They are available in various sizes, shapes, and designs. The Originals consist of various sub-families as well.

====Swatch Irony====
The &quot;Irony&quot; family contains all the metal-cased watches produced by Swatch. These include both quartz-driven and automatic mechanical watches that can be serviced. The automatics have a 21J/23J ETA 2842 movement. This movement is exclusive to Swatch and is derived from 2824 to 2822.
&quot;Irony Chronograph&quot; was introduced in 1996 (type/code: YCS101).

====Swatch Skin====
The &quot;Skin&quot; family contains two sub families: &quot;Original Skin&quot; and &quot;Skin Chronograph&quot;. The Original Skin was introduced on 6 October 1997 as a thinner version of the original Swatch watch. It is ultra thin, standing at , hence the name Swatch Skin. The Swatch Skin later went on to enter the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; as the world&#x27;s thinnest plastic watch. The Swatch Chronograph is simply the Swatch Skin with a chronograph function, adding two additional buttons on the side of the watch.
====Bijoux====
The &quot;Bijoux&quot; line is a jewelry line Swatch released in the new millennium; it partnered with Swarovski to encrust the Bijoux line of watches.
====Digital Touch====
The &quot;Digital Touch&quot; line, launched in 2011, derives its name from the touchscreen technology used. In contrast to other Swatch families, a digital LCD shows the time. Various models in different colors of the display are available, which include backlighting for reading in the dark.
====Bellamy and Pay ====
These Swatch models of wristwatches with a quartz movement are additionally equipped with a near-field communication (NFC) chip to accommodate contactless payment. As an improved second generation, Swatch introduced the model &quot;Pay&quot; for the Chinese market in July 2017. Unlike the Bellamy, &quot;Pay&quot; can be programmed and activated in Swatch shops using a Cloud Computing service operated by several Chinese banks.

====Sistem51====
Swatch introduced &quot;Sistem51&quot; at Baselworld 2013 as &quot;the world&#x27;s first mechanical movement with entirely automated assembly.&quot; The movement uses 51 components anchored to a central screw with automatic winding and a 90-hour power reserve – and is 100% Swiss made on a automated assembly line in clean-room conditions, without human intervention.

The movement is permanently sealed in its case with structural adhesive securing both the acrylic crystal over the dial and the case back, making it invulnerable to environmental conditions including moisture, dust or foreign objects – and also making it maintenance free – i.e., impossible to service.

The movement is made from ARCAP, an anti-magnetic alloy of copper, nickel, and zinc – designed to free the movement from the need for adjustment. The escapement has no manual adjustment or regulator; the initial rate is factory laser-set. Swatch reports precision of ±10 seconds per day. The design&#x27;s peripheral bi-directional rotor allows viewing of movement components through the caseback.

====Swatch x You====

In 2017 Swatch introduced &quot;Swatch x You&quot;, a product that allows one to design their own Swatch by selecting the category and design one wishes to use. An outline of a watch is superimposed over the user&#x27;s image to assist with designing. 
====Bioreloaded====
The &quot;Bioreloaded&quot; line was introduced by Swatch in 2020, consisting of a relaunch of Swatch&#x27;s 1983 debut collection, but partially made from &quot;bio-sourced&quot; materials. The case, strap, and strap clasp of a Bioreloaded watch is made of a material derived from the seeds of the castor plant, while the packaging material is a biodegradable &quot;paperfoam&quot; created with tapioca and potato starch.

====Swatch x Omega====
The &quot;Swatch x Omega&quot; collaboration debuted in 2022, with &quot;MoonSwatch&quot;, a collection of reimagined Omega Speedmaster Professional Moonwatches in eleven different color variants themed after the Sun, Moon, and planets of the solar system. The collection uses the 4 jewel chronograph quartz movement used in other Swatch chronographs and Swatch&#x27;s BIOCERAMIC composite material.

The MoonSwatch collection was released March on 26, 2022, at select Swatch stores. &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the release &quot;the watch industry&#x27;s defining moment of 2022&quot;. The collection sold out internationally on its release date, with lines formed at most Swatch boutiques where it was carried. Swatch initially stated each consumer could purchase up to two watches but later limited each consumer to one watch. While Swatch initially added the product to their online catalog, it later announced the collection would not be available for sale online. The MoonSwatch is neither a limited nor numbered collection.

=== Pride collection ===
In May 2023, Swatch released a Pride collection of rainbow watches to support the LGBTQ+ cause worldwide. The collection has six watches with different monochrome colours that corresponds to the colours of the gay pride flag. In Malaysia, the Home Ministry banned the sale of the watch and raided 13 Swatch outlets to seize and impound 172 watches over three days in May. The company reported that Malaysia was the only country which seized the watches. Swatch filed a lawsuit against the Home Ministry and the Malaysian governement, challenging the legality of the seizure in July 2023. The ban was gazetted only in August 2023. In a September 2023 interview, Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said that the raid was &#x27;excessive&#x27;, but defended Malaysia&#x27;s current stance on the LGBT issue. In November 2024, the Malaysian High Court ruled that the raid was conducted without a warrant therefore was deemed illegal. The judge, Justice Amarjeet Singh Serjit Singh, also noted that the ban was imposed only after the watches were seized, which meant that no laws were violated in May 2023. The court ordered the returned of the seized watches to the company.

<doc id="1313103" wikidata="Q560197" url="?curid=1313103" title="Prithviraj Kapoor">
<text>Prithviraj Kapoor (born Prithvinath Kapoor; 3 November 1906 – 29 May 1972) was an Indian actor who is also considered to be one of the founding figures of Hindi cinema. He was associated with IPTA as one of its founding members and established the Prithvi Theatres in 1944 as a travelling theatre company based in Bombay.

He was the patriarch of the Kapoor family of Hindi films, four generations of which, beginning with him, have played active roles in the Hindi film industry, with the youngest generation still active in Bollywood. His father, Basheshwarnath Kapoor, also played a short role in his movie &quot;Awara&quot;. The Government of India honoured him with the Padma Bhushan in 1969 and the Dadasaheb Phalke Award in 1971 for his contributions towards Indian cinema.

== Early life and education ==
Prithviraj Kapoor was born as Prithvinath Kapoor on 3 November 1906 in Samundri, British India, into a Punjabi Hindu Khatri family of the Kapoor &quot;gotra&quot;. His father, Dewan Basheshwarnath Kapoor, was a police officer in the Indian Imperial Police. His grandfather, Dewan Keshavmal Kapoor, and his great-grandfather, Dewan Murli Mal Kapoor, were Tehsildars in Samundri near Lyallpur. Kapoor was the eldest of eight siblings, five boys (including Prithviraj and Trilok Kapoor, also an actor) and three girls. Film producer Surinder Kapoor, father of actors and producers Anil, Boney and Sanjay Kapoor, was a cousin of Prithviraj Kapoor.

Kapoor&#x27;s childhood was largely spent in Lyallpur District, where his grandparents and extended family lived. Later, his father was transferred to Peshawar, North West Frontier Province, and after some years, the family moved there, while retaining house and property in Lyallpur. Kapoor studied initially at Lyallpur Khalsa College then in Lyallpur, and later at Edwardes College in Peshawar, where he received his Bachelor of Arts. He also went on to study law for a year before deciding to go into acting.

== Career ==
Kapoor began his acting career in the theatres of Lyallpur and Peshawar. In 1928, he moved to Bombay City, Bombay Presidency, with a loan from an aunt. There he joined the Imperial Films Company and started acting in minor roles in movies. In 1929, he made his acting debut as an extra in his first film, &quot;Be Dhari Talwar&quot;. He went on to earn a lead role in his third film, titled &quot;Cinema Girl&quot;, which released in 1930.

After featuring in nine silent films, including &quot;Be Dhari Talwar&quot;, &quot;Cinema Girl&quot;, &quot;Sher-e-Arab&quot; and &quot;Prince Vijaykumar&quot;, Kapoor did a supporting role in India&#x27;s first film talkie, &quot;Alam Ara&quot; (1931). His performance in Vidyapati (1937) was much appreciated. His best-known performance is perhaps as Alexander the Great in Sohrab Modi&#x27;s Sikandar (1941). He also joined the Grant Anderson Theater Company, an English theatrical company that remained in Bombay for a year. Through all these years, Kapoor remained devoted to the theatre and performed on stage regularly. He developed a reputation as a very fine and versatile actor on both stage and screen.

=== Prithvi Theatres ===

By 1944, Kapoor had the wherewithal and standing to found his own theatre group, Prithvi Theatres, whose première performance was Kalidasa&#x27;s &quot;Abhijñānaśākuntalam&quot; in 1942. His eldest son, Raj Kapoor, by 1946, had struck out on his own; the films he produced had been successful and this was also an enabling factor. Prithviraj invested in Prithvi Theatres, which staged memorable productions across India. The plays were highly influential and inspired young people to participate in the Indian independence movement and the Quit India Movement.
 In over 16 years of existence, the theatre staged some 2,662 performances. Prithviraj starred as the lead actor in &quot;every single show&quot;. One of his popular plays was called &quot;Pathan&quot; (1947), which was performed on stage nearly 600 times in Mumbai. It opened on 13 April 1947, and is a story of a Muslim and his Hindu friend.

By the late 1950s, it was clear that the era of the travelling theatre had been irreversibly supplanted by the cinema and it was no longer financially feasible for a troupe of up to 80 people to travel the country for four to six months at a time along with their props and equipment and living in hotels and campsites. The financial returns, through ticket sales and the rapidly diminishing &quot;largesse&quot; of patrons from the erstwhile princely class of India, was not enough to support such an effort. Many of the fine actors and technicians that Prithvi Theatres nurtured had found their way to the movies. Indeed, this was the case with all of Prithviraj&#x27;s own sons. As Kapoor progressed into his 50s, he gradually ceased theatre activities and accepted occasional offers from film-makers, including his own sons. He appeared with his son Raj in the 1951 film &quot;Awara&quot; as a stern judge who had thrown his own wife out of his house. Later, under his son, Shashi Kapoor, and daughter-in-law Jennifer Kendal, Prithvi Theatre merged with the Indian Shakespeare theatre company, &quot;Shakespeareana&quot;, and the company got a permanent home, with the inauguration of the Prithvi Theatre in Mumbai on 5 November 1978.

==== Postage stamp ====

In 1996, the Golden Jubilee year of the founding of Prithvi Theatre, India Post, issued a special two Rupee commemorative postage stamp. It featured the logo of the theatre, the dates 1945–1995, and an image of Kapoor. The first day cover, (stamped 15-1-95), showed an illustration of a performance of a travelling theatre in progress, on a stage that seems fit for a travelling theatre, as Prithvi theatre was for sixteen years, until 1960. On the occasion of 100 years of the Indian cinema, another postage stamp, bearing his likeness, was released by India Post on 3 May 2013.

=== Later years ===
His filmography of this period includes &quot;Mughal-e-Azam&quot; (1960), where he gave his most memorable performance as the Mughal emperor Akbar, which earned him a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor, &quot;Harishchandra Taramati&quot; (1963) in which he played the lead role, an unforgettable performance as Porus in &quot;Sikandar-e-Azam&quot; (1965), and the stentorian grandfather in &quot;Kal Aaj Aur Kal&quot; (1971), in which he appeared with his son Raj Kapoor and grandson Randhir Kapoor.

Kapoor starred in the legendary religious Punjabi film &quot;Nanak Nam Jahaz Hai&quot; (1969), a film so revered in Punjab that there were lines many kilometres long to purchase tickets.

He also starred in the Punjabi films &quot;Nanak Dukhiya Sub Sansar&quot; (1970) and &quot;Mele Mittran De&quot; (1972).

He also acted in the Kannada film &quot;Sakshatkara&quot; (1971), directed by Kannada director Puttanna Kanagal. He acted as Dr. Rajkumar&#x27;s father in the film.

== Awards and honours ==

In 1954, he was awarded the Sangeet Natak Akademi Fellowship, and in 1969, the Padma Bhushan by the Government of India. He remained Nominated Rajya Sabha Member for eight years.

He was posthumously awarded the Dadasaheb Phalke Award for the year 1971. He was the third recipient of that award, the highest accolade in Indian cinema.

He was also inducted into the Bollywood Walk of Fame at Bandra Bandstand, where his autograph was preserved.

== Personal life ==
Kapoor was aged 17 when he was married to the 15-year-old Ramsarni Mehra, a girl of his own community and similar background, in a match arranged by their parents. The marriage was harmonious and conventional and lasted all their lives. In fact, the wedding had been held even earlier, a few years prior to this, and it was the &quot;gauna&quot; ceremony (farewell) which was celebrated when Ramsarni reached the age of 15 and became old enough to leave her parents and reside with her husband and in-laws. Ramsarni&#x27;s brother, Jugal Kishore Mehra, would later enter films.

The couple&#x27;s eldest child, Raj Kapoor, was born the following year in Peshawar, North West Frontier Province, on 14 December 1924; making Prithviraj a father at age 18. By the time Prithviraj moved to Bombay City, Bombay Presidency in 1927, the couple were the parents of three children. In 1930, Ramsarni joined Prithviraj in Bombay. The following year, while she was pregnant for the fourth time, two of their sons died in the space of one terrible week. One of their children, Devinder (called Devi), died of double-pneumonia, while the other child, Ravinder (called Binder or Bindie), died of poisoning in a freak incident when he swallowed rat-poison pills strewn in the garden.

The couple went on to have three more children: sons Shamsher Raj (Shammi) and Balbir Raj (Shashi) (who were to become famous actors and filmmakers in their own right), and daughter, Urmila Sial.

After his retirement, Prithviraj settled in a cottage called Prithvi Jhonpra near Juhu Beach, West Bombay. The property was on lease, which was bought by Shashi Kapoor, and later converted into a small, experimental theatre, the Prithvi Theatre. Both Prithviraj and Ramsarni had cancer and died 16 days apart. Prithviraj died on 29 May 1972 and Ramsarni died on 14 June 1972.

A Samadhi (memorial) of Raj Kapoor at their family farm &quot;Rajbaugh&quot;, which means the &quot;garden of kings&quot;, also houses Privthiraj Kapoor and his wife&#x27;s memorial. Rajbaugh lies on the banks of Mula-Mutha River in Loni Kalbhor village 30 km east of Pune in Maharshtra. Kapoor family sold part of 125 acres Rajbaugh to MIT World Peace University (MIT WPU) which built and houses the memorial for the Kapoor family on its campus. It has 7 pagodas and a viewing gallery which displays the Kapoor family photographs. Raj Kapoor shot many of his films at this farm, including &quot;Satyam Shivam Sundaram&quot;, &quot;Mera Naam Joker&quot;, &quot;Bobby&quot;, and &quot;Prem Rog&quot; among others. Kapoor&#x27;s family bungalow inside the farm has been preserved; the popular song &quot;Hum Tum Ek Kamre Mein Band Ho&quot; was shot inside this bungalow. He shared a great friendship with the Hindi Literature stalwart Harivansh Rai Bachchan.

<text>The Nisga’a (; ), formerly spelled Nishga or Niska, are an Indigenous people in British Columbia, Canada. They reside in the Nass River valley of northwestern British Columbia. The origin of the term &quot;Niska&quot; is uncertain. The spelling &quot;Nishga&quot; is used by the Nishga Tribal Council, and some scholars claim that the term means &#x27;people of the Nass River&#x27;. The name is a reduced form of , which is a loan word from Tongass Tlingit, where it means &#x27;people of the Nass River&#x27;.

The official languages of Nisg̱a’a are the Nisg̱a’a language and English.

==Culture==

===Social Organization===
Nisga’a society is organized into four tribes:
* Ganhada (G̱anada, Raven)
* Gispwudwada (Gisḵ’aast, Killer Whale)
* Laxgibuu (Lax̱gibuu, Wolf)
* Laxsgiik (Lax̱sgiik, Eagle)

Each tribe is further sub-divided into house groups – extended families with the same origins. Some houses are grouped together into clans – grouping of houses with same ancestors. Example:

*Lax̱gibuu Tribe (Wolf Tribe)
** Gitwilnaak’il Clan (People Separated but of One)
*** House of Duuḵ
*** House of K’eex̱kw
*** House of Gwingyoo

===Traditional cuisine===
The Nisga’a traditionally harvest &quot;sea food&quot; all year round. This might include razor clams, mussels, oysters, limpets, scallops, abalone, fish, seaweed and other seafood that can be harvested from the shore. They also harvest salmon, cod, char, pike, trout and other freshwater fish from the streams, and hunt seals, fish and sea lion. The grease of the oolichan fish (&quot;Thaleichthys pacificus&quot;) is sometimes traded with other tribes, though nowadays this is more usually in a ceremonial context. They hunt mountain goat, marmot, game birds and more in the forests. The family works together to cook and process the meat and fish, roasting or boiling the former. They eat fish and sea mammals in frozen, boiled, dried or roasted form. The heads of a type of cod, often gathered half-eaten by sharks, are boiled into a soup that, according to folklore, helps prevent colds. The Nisga′a also trade dried fish, seal oil, fish oil, blubber and cedar.

===Traditional houses===
The traditional houses of the Nisga’a are shaped as large rectangles, made of cedar planks with cedar shake roofs, and oriented with the doors facing the water. The doors are usually decorated with the family crest. Inside, the floor is dug down to hold the hearth and conserve temperature. Beds and boxes of possessions are placed around the walls. Prior to the mid-twentieth century, around three or four extended families might live in one house; this is nowadays an uncommon practice. Masks and blankets might decorate the walls.

=== Traditional clothing ===
Prior to European colonization, men wore nothing in the summer, normally the best time to hunt and fish. Women wore skirts made of softened cedar bark and went topless. During the colder season, men wore cedar bark skirts (shaped more like a loincloth), a cape of cedar bark, and a basket hat outside in the rain, but wore nothing inside the house. Women wore basket hats and cedar blankets indoors and outdoors. Both sexes made and wore shell and bone necklaces. They rubbed seal blubber into their hair, and men kept their hair long or in a top knot. During warfare, men wore red cedar armour, a cedar helmet, and cedar loincloths. They wielded spears, clubs, harpoons, bows and slings. Wicker shields were common.

=== Calendar/life ===
The Nisga’a calendar revolves around harvesting of foods and goods used. The original year followed the various moons throughout the year.
* : Like a Spoon (February/March). This is the traditional time to celebrate the new year, also known as . (Variations of spelling include: )
* : To Eat Oolichan (March). The oolichan return to the Nass River the end of February/beginning of March. They are the first food harvested after the winter, which marks the beginning of the harvesting year.
* : To Use Canoes Again (April). The ice begins to break on the river, allowing for canoes to be used again
* : Leaves Are Blooming (May). The leaves begin to flourish once again
* : Sockeye Salmon (June). Sockeye salmon are harvested
* : To Eat Berries (July). various berries are harvested
* : Great Salmon (August). Great amounts of salmon are harvested
* : Trail of the Marmot (September). Small game such as marmots are hunted
* : To Eat Trout (October). Trout are the main staple for this month
* : To Blanket (November). The earth is &quot;Blanketed&quot; with snow
* : To Sit (December). The sun is sitting in one spot
* : To Walk North (January). This time of year, the sun begins to go north () again
* : To Blow Around (February). Blow around refers to the amount of wind during this time of year

==Geography==

Approximately 2,000 people live in the Nass Valley. Another 5,000 Nisga’a live elsewhere in Canada, predominantly within the three urban societies noted in the section below.

===Nisgaʼa villages===
The Nisga’a people number about 7,000. In British Columbia, the Nisga’a Nation is represented by four villages:

* Gitlaxtʼaamiks (formerly New Aiyansh) – nearly 800
* Gitwinksihlkw (formerly Canyon City) – approximately 200
* Lax̱g̱altsʼap (formerly Greenville) – more than 500
* Ging̱olx (formerly Kincolith) – almost 400

===Nisgaʼa diaspora===
Many Nisga’a people have moved to cities for their opportunities. Concentrations are found in three urban areas outside traditional Nisga’a territory:

* Terrace
* Prince Rupert/Port Edward
* Vancouver – there are approximately 1,500 Nisgaʼa in Vancouver, and others elsewhere in the Lower Mainland.

==Treaty==

On August 4, 1998, a land-claim was settled between the Nisga’a, the government of British Columbia, and the Government of Canada. As part of the settlement in the Nass River valley, nearly of land was officially recognized as Nisga’a, and a water reservation was also created. Bear Glacier Provincial Park was also created as a result of this agreement. The land-claim&#x27;s settlement was the first formal treaty signed by a First Nation in British Columbia since the Douglas Treaties in 1854 (Vancouver Island) and Treaty 8 in 1899 (northeastern British Columbia). The land owned collectively is under internal pressures from the Nisga&#x27;a people to turn it over into a system of individual ownership. This would have an effect on the rest of Canada in regards to First Nations lands.

==History==

The Tseax Cone in a valley above and east of the Ksi Sii Aks (formerly Tseax River) was the source for an eruption during the 18th century that killed approximately 2,000 Nisga’a people from poisonous volcanic gases.

==Government==
The government bodies of the Nisgaʼa include the Nisgaʼa Lisims government, the government of the Nisgaʼa Nation, and the Nisgaʼa village governments, one for each of the four Nisgaʼa villages. The Nisgaʼa Lisims government () is in the Nisgaʼa Lisims Government Building in Gitlaxt&#x27;aamiks.

==Museum==
In 2011 the Nisg̱aʼa Museum, a project of the Nisga&#x27;a Lisims government, opened in Lax̱g̱altsʼap. It contains many historical artifacts of the Nisga&#x27;a people returned after many decades in major museums beyond the Nass Valley.

==Prominent Nisga’a==

<doc id="1313111" wikidata="Q4348620" url="?curid=1313111" title="Ricky Wilson (guitarist)">
<text>Ricky Helton Wilson (March 19, 1953 – October 12, 1985) was an American musician best known as the original guitarist and founding member of rock band the B-52s. Born in Athens, Georgia, Wilson was the brother of fellow member Cindy Wilson. The B-52s were founded in 1976, when Ricky, Cindy, Kate Pierson, Keith Strickland and Fred Schneider shared a tropical flaming volcano drink at a Chinese restaurant and, after an impromptu music session at the home of their friend Owen Scott III, played for the first time at a Valentine&#x27;s Day party for friends. Wilson&#x27;s unusual guitar tunings were a large contribution to the band&#x27;s quirky sound.

On October 12, 1985, at the age of 32, Wilson died from complications related to AIDS following the recording of the band&#x27;s fourth studio album &quot;Bouncing Off the Satellites&quot;. According to Strickland, the album had been completed and mixed before Wilson&#x27;s death, with only the cover art not yet designed (an illustration by Kenny Scharf was ultimately decided upon). Devastated, the band went into seclusion and did not tour to promote the album, though they did several photo shoots and TV appearances and filmed a video for &quot;Girl from Ipanema Goes to Greenland&quot;.

In addition to his work with the B-52s, Wilson played the guitar on the song &quot;Breakin&#x27; in My Heart&quot; on Tom Verlaine&#x27;s self-titled debut album in 1979. This was his only non-B-52s appearance on record. He also appeared in various films, notably &quot;One Trick Pony&quot;. Posthumously, he also appeared in &quot;Athens, GA: Inside/Out&quot;, &quot;The B-52s 1979–1989&quot;, and &quot;Time Capsule: Videos for a Future Generation&quot; through archival footage.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named Wilson the 247th greatest guitarist of all time in 2023.

==Early life==
Wilson was born on March 19, 1953, to Bobby Jack Wilson, a fireman and a veteran of the United States Army, and Linda J. Wilson (née Mairholtz), in Athens, Georgia. He was the elder brother of Cindy Wilson. At an early age, Wilson developed an interest in music and learned how to play folk guitar from the PBS series &quot;Learning Folk Guitar&quot;. Upon entering Clarke Central High School, Wilson had upgraded to a Silvertone guitar and, to tape his music, purchased a two-track tape recorder with money earned from a summer job at the local landfill.

In mid-1969, Wilson met former Comer resident Keith Strickland at the local head shop The Looking Glass. The two shared common interests in music and Eastern mysticist culture and quickly became friends.

Wilson quietly came out as gay to Strickland while the two were in their teens, becoming the first member of the band to do so.

During mid-1969, both Wilson and Strickland collaborated in writing and performing music, loosely calling themselves Loon, and aspired to perform live.

From 1969 to 1971, Wilson and Strickland collaborated with high school friends Pete Love of Louisville and Athens native Owen Scott III in performing together as the four-member band Black Narcissus.

Upon graduation from the University of Georgia in 1976, Wilson kept in touch with Strickland and they toured Europe, eventually returning and taking jobs at the Southeastern Stages bus station in Athens, Georgia where Strickland&#x27;s father was the manager.

===1976–1985: The B-52s===
In late 1976, Strickland and Wilson returned to Athens in search of further employment. The two joined the B-52s when they, Wilson&#x27;s sister Cindy, Kate Pierson, and Fred Schneider of local protest band the Sun-Donuts, formed the group in an impromptu musical practice session after sharing a tropical flaming volcano drink at a Chinese restaurant. They played their first concert in 1977 at a Valentine&#x27;s Day party for friends. The band&#x27;s quirky take on the new wave sound of their era was a combination of dance and surf music set apart by the unusual guitar tunings used by Wilson.

Wilson cited various children&#x27;s records, the Mamas &amp; the Papas, and Esquerita and the Voola as sources of inspiration in his musical career. Wilson also played the guitar on the song &quot;Breakin&#x27; In My Heart&quot; on Tom Verlaine&#x27;s self-titled debut album.

==Illness and death==
In 1983, during recording sessions for the band&#x27;s third studio album &quot;Whammy!&quot;, Wilson discovered he had contracted HIV. He confided his illness to Keith Strickland. In 1985, during recording for their album &quot;Bouncing Off the Satellites&quot;, Wilson&#x27;s illness became more severe; both Strickland and Pierson have stated that despite this, he kept his illness secret from the other members of the band. In an interview, Pierson stated that Wilson did so because he &quot;did not want anyone to worry about him or fuss about him&quot;.

On October 12, 1985, in the Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center, Wilson died of AIDS, at the age of 32. He was buried in Oconee Hill Cemetery in Athens. Devastated, the band did little promotional work and did not tour to promote the album. Upon reforming in 1988, the band continued as a four-piece, with Strickland replicating Wilson&#x27;s riffs from their earlier material in live performances.

<text>Puerto Vallarta Squeeze is a novel by Robert James Waller, which was made into a film in 2004. Originally published in 1995 and subtitled &quot;The Run for el Norte&quot;, this unlikely romance follows an American expatriate and his Mexican girlfriend on a road trip with a former Marine. The title itself may refer to the race-against-time journey that they take, which begins in Puerto Vallarta.

==Plot summary==
Former journalist Danny Pastor has relaxed in Puerto Vallarta over the past year with María de la Luz Santos, a 22-year-old woman whom he&#x27;d first met as a cantina waitress. They moved in together shortly thereafter, and Luz asked Danny to marry her, but he kept her at arms&#x27; length. One night when Luz went off by herself, she got pregnant by a drunken college student. Danny paid for her to have an abortion, and that incident made up his mind about her.

One night as they relaxed in the El Niño cantina, Danny heard a gunshot and rushes outside to see two men dead. One was an American Navy officer, and the other was a software engineer ready to sell his company&#x27;s work on failure analysis to the Taiwanese government. 
Back at their apartment, Danny and Luz met a man who identifies himself as &quot;Peter Schumann&quot; and needs to get north of the Rio Grande quickly. Paying Danny five thousand in cash, Schumann arranges his passage in a rusting Ford Bronco named Vito. The film adaptation featured a Jeep Wagoneer instead of a Ford Bronco.

Unaware at first of the nature of their journey, Luz wants to go with them to see her grandparents&#x27; graves along the coast. When she met with them for the trip, Luz wore blue jeans and a shirt that read &quot;Puerto Vallarta Squeeze&quot; with two halves of a lime dripping down the center. Danny saw in the story of this trip a great opportunity for a literary comeback. As they travelled north, Danny, Luz, and Schumann evade American military and Mexican authorities. Schumann later revealed that he&#x27;s really former Marine sniper turned mercenary Clayton Price; he was commissioned to kill the engineer, but he took his job personally when he shot the naval officer. During the Vietnam War, Price was abandoned behind enemy lines by the officer who commanded the helicopter.

After commandeering the backroads of rural Mexico, Price arranged to have a helicopter meet him near an abandoned silver mine at Zapata. After a fiesta the night before, Luz decided to go with Price because she&#x27;s fallen in love with him. As Price put it, &quot;I&#x27;m not sure &quot;I&#x27;m&quot; capable of loving at all. But, Danny, &quot;you&quot; love too timidly. I&#x27;m not sure which is worse. You have this offhand way of treating her most of the time, as if she&#x27;s a partially reformed street whore. . . . She told me about her past. She says I treat her with respect. You figure it out.&quot;

In a standoff with authorities, Price and Luz are killed. Danny heads back to Puerto Vallarta through Mazatlán, but he&#x27;s arrested when the gun Price used in the double murder is found behind his apartment&#x27;s toilet. Despite the evidence being circumstantial, Danny serves seventeen months of a ten-year prison sentence before he&#x27;s released with a one-way ticket to Laredo. Although ordered never to return to Mexico again, Danny does so to find Price and Luz&#x27;s graves in the Zapata cemetery. Price&#x27;s marker was removed, but Danny exhumed Luz&#x27;s coffin and reburied it in Celaya, where her grandparents were buried. During his time in prison, Danny wrote a manuscript about his adventures with Price and Luz as they rode north, but he never saw it again.

==Characters==
*Clayton Price
*Walter McGrane
*Danny Pastor
*Maria de la Luz Santos
*Agent Neil Weatherford

==Miscellaneous==
As an acknowledgment, the author claims he first heard this story from his wife, who heard it in Puerto Vallarta.

Characters from Waller&#x27;s other novels make cameos in &quot;Puerto Vallarta Squeeze&quot;. When Luz flashes back to her childhood in Ceylaya, a gringo photographer bearing a strong resemblance to Robert Kincaid from &quot;The Bridges of Madison County&quot; takes photos of her working in the fields and sends her a copy of one. When Danny, Luz, and Price arrive in Zapata, Price gets a drink from the bar and barely recognizes another Marine. When the Marine goes off with his partner, he&#x27;s referred to as &quot;Jack&quot; and is told to stop pining over &quot;Linda&quot;. Carmine Jack and Linda Lobo are two prominent characters from Waller&#x27;s novel &quot;Border Music&quot;.

Much of the background information of the character Price come from the real life Vietnam Era Marine Sniper Carlos Hathcock, whose legendary career in Vietnam has been the basis for 4 non-fiction novels. Several of Price&#x27;s stories, told first hand, seem to come directly from &quot;Marine Sniper: 93 Confirmed Kills&quot; by Charles W. Henderson.

An interesting characterization of the &quot;Killer&quot; is that he is developed as a psychopath. He feels that he was abandoned as a child. He seems to justify his need to kill through some of rationization of those innate feelings.

==Adaptations==

===Motion picture===
In 2003, &quot;Puerto Vallarta Squeeze&quot; was made into a motion picture. Adapted for the screen by Richard Alfieri, it was directed by Arthur Allan Seidelman, and starred Harvey Keitel, Scott Glenn, and Jonathan Brandis (in his last role before his death in 2003). Vikki Carr also appears and sings in Spanish.

===Album===
In 1996, Willie &amp; Lobo compiled an album of their music, &quot;The Music of Puerto Vallarta Squeeze&quot;, to accompany the book. The artists&#x27; music is a blend of sounds, Gypsy, Latin, Celtic, Flamenco, Middle Eastern, Rock, Jazz, Cuban Swing, Tango and Salsa, loosely labeled New Flamenco.

<text> (, stylized in all caps) is a French weekly news magazine headquartered in Paris. The weekly stands at the political centre-right in the French media landscape, and has a lifestyle supplement, &quot;L&#x27;Express Styles&quot;, and a job supplement, &quot;Réussir&quot;. Founded in 1953 by Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber and Françoise Giroud, &quot;L&#x27;Express&quot; would be considered France&#x27;s first American-style news weekly. &quot;L&#x27;Express&quot; is one of the three major French news weeklies alongside &quot;Le Nouvel Obs&quot; and &quot;Le Point&quot;.

==History and profile==
 was co-founded in 1953 by Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber, future president of the Radical Party, and Françoise Giroud, who had earlier edited &quot;Elle&quot; and went on to become France&#x27;s first minister of women&#x27;s affairs in 1974 and minister of culture in 1976. &quot;L&#x27;Express&quot;″ first issue was released on Saturday 16 May 1953, at the corner of the end of the Indochina War and the Algerian War which was about to break out. It was founded as a weekly supplement to the newspaper &quot;Les Échos&quot;. 

The magazine was supportive of the policies of Pierre Mendès-France in Indochina and, in general, had a left-of-centre orientation. The magazine opposed the Algerian War, and especially the use of torture. In March 1958, as a result of an article of Jean-Paul Sartre reviewing the book &quot;La Question&quot; by Henri Alleg, the magazine was prevented from being published by the French Government. In order to resume publication, had to print a new issue without the incriminated article. François Mauriac was a regular contributor with his &quot;Bloc-Notes&quot; column but left when Charles de Gaulle returned to power.

In 1964, &quot;L&#x27;Express&quot; was modelled on the US magazine &quot;Time&quot; and the German magazine &quot;Der Spiegel&quot;. That same year, a number of journalists, including Jean Daniel and André Gorz, quit to found &quot;Le Nouvel Observateur&quot;. Servan-Schreiber turned into a less politically engaged publication, and the circulation rose from 150,000 to 500,000 copies in three years. The magazine&#x27;s sales surged in 1965 with its investigation into the Ben Barka case, which had shaken the Gaullist government.

In 1971, as a result of Servan-Schreiber&#x27;s political activities as a deputy of the Radical Party, nine journalists of , including Claude Imbert, left the magazine and created &quot;Le Point&quot; to counter what they perceived as the &quot;current breed of French intellectuals in the press and elsewhere, with their leftist dogmas and complacent nihilism&quot;. Journalist Philippe Grumbach, who, after joining the magazine in 1954, had left in 1963 to pursue independent work, was appointed political editor. He left in 1978. Earlier in 1977, Servan-Schreiber sold his magazine to Jimmy Goldsmith.

Jean-François Revel became director in October 1978. He was replaced by Yves Cuau in May 1981. The same year the magazine had a circulation of 507,000 copies. In 1986, started a news exchange cooperation with the Belgium-based French language news magazine &quot;Le Vif/L’Express&quot;. In 1987, had a circulation of 555,000 copies and 554,000 copies in 1988. The same year the magazine was sold to C. G. E. Yann de l&#x27;Ecotais became the new director and served in the post until 1994, when he was replaced by Christine Ockrent. In 1995, was sold to CEP communications, a filial of Havas, and Denis Jeambar became the new director. On 22 April 1996, Christophe Barbier began working for the magazine as editor-in-chief of the political department.

In 1998, after Vivendi took control of Havas, the magazine returned under its control. After the collapse of Vivendi, was sold in 2002 to Socpresse (80% owned by Dassault Group). From 2001 to 2002, had a circulation of 424,000 copies. It was 548,195 copies between 2003 and 2004. was acquired by Roularta Media Group in 2006. The same year the circulation of the magazine was 547,000 copies. Barbier was the editorial director from 2006 to 2016.

In 2014, Roularta sold to Franco-Israeli billionaire and media entrepreneur Patrick Drahi, founder and owner of Altice. The magazine had lost several million euros due to the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. After buying 51% of the capital (the rest remaining in the hands of Altice), Alain Weill revitalized &quot;L&#x27;Express&quot; in 2020 by emulating the approach of &quot;The Economist&quot;. Weill refocused the magazine on four themes: international, economics, politics, and ideas. New columnists were hired, such as Marion Van Renterghem (renowned reporter and specialized in the European field), Jean-Laurent Cassely (writer and journalist discussing sociological and urban issues), Jean-Marc Jancovici (engineer, pro-nuclear, and &quot;pioneer of the climate cause&quot;), Robin Rivaton (liberal essayist, close to Bruno Le Maire and Valérie Pécresse), and Emmanuelle Mignon (ex-director of Nicolas Sarkozy&#x27;s cabinet at the Élysée Palace). Slowly relaunching the magazine, Weill decided to drop the entertainment news section and focus on an audience of lawyers, business executives, physicians, pharmacists, teachers, and students.

In 2021, between 65 and 67 journalists worked for &quot;L&#x27;Express&quot; out of a total of 120 employees. is published weekly.

<text>Joslin &quot;Josh&quot; McDowell (born August 17, 1939) is an evangelical Christian apologist and evangelist. He is the author or co-author of over 150 books. 

In 2006, his book &quot;Evidence That Demands a Verdict&quot; was ranked 13th in &quot;Christianity Today&quot;″s list of most influential evangelical books published after World War II. Other well-known titles are &quot;More Than a Carpenter&quot;, &quot;A Ready Defense&quot; and &quot;Right from Wrong&quot;.

==Biography==

===Family and education===
McDowell was born in Union City, Michigan, in 1939 with the given name Joslin. He is one of five children born to Wilmot McDowell. Biographer Joe Musser indicates that McDowell struggled with low self-esteem in his youth, as his father was an alcoholic and abusive. McDowell also revealed he was sexually abused repeatedly as a child by a farm hand, Wayne Bailey, from the age of 6 to 13. He enlisted in the Air National Guard, received basic training and assumed duties in mechanical maintenance of aircraft. After sustaining a head injury he was discharged from the service.

He initially intended to pursue legal studies culminating in a political career, and began preparatory studies at Kellogg Community College, a two-year junior college in Battle Creek, Michigan. According to McDowell, he was an agnostic at college when he decided to prepare a paper that would examine the historical evidence of the Christian faith in order to disprove it. However, he converted to Christianity, after, as he says, he found evidence for it, not against it. He subsequently enrolled at Wheaton College where he was awarded a Bachelor of Arts degree. He then studied at Talbot Theological Seminary of Biola University. He completed an exit paper examining the theology of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses and was awarded the Master of Divinity degree, graduating &quot;magna cum laude&quot;.

Josh McDowell married Dottie Youd, with whom he has four children and ten grandchildren; they live in California. His son, Sean, is also a Christian apologist and Associate Professor at Biola University.

===Career and ministry===
In 1964, he became a traveling representative of Campus Crusade for Christ International, a parachurch ministry that operates student chapters on university and college campuses established by the late Bill Bright in the 1950s. He remains connected to the organization today.

McDowell&#x27;s full-time ministry with Campus Crusade for Christ began with his appointment as a campus speaker in Latin America. He later returned to North America where he became known as an itinerant speaker addressing campus groups about the Christian faith.

Part of his speaking ministry has focused on youth issues in relationships and sexual mores and is reflected in seminars such as &quot;Maximum Sex&quot; and the &quot;Why Wait?&quot; campaign that encourages sexual abstinence before marriage. Other facets of his speaking ministry and writing have focused on issues of self-esteem (&quot;His Image, My Image&quot;), and developing faith and character (&quot;Evidence for Joy&quot;). In the 1980s he also co-ordinated a three-month residential discipleship program in a retreat center called The Julian Center, near San Diego.

===Critical race theory comments===
McDowell came under criticism for remarks he made on September 18, 2021, at the American Association of Christian Counselors World Conference. In discussing Critical Race Theory, McDowell said, &quot;I do not believe Blacks, African Americans, and many other minorities have equal opportunity. Why? Most of them grew up in families where there is not a big emphasis on education, security — you can do anything you want. You can change the world. If you work hard, you will make it. So many African Americans don&#x27;t have those privileges like I was brought up with.&quot; McDowell apologized for his remarks the following day.

== Method of apologetics ==

As a practitioner of Christian apologetics, McDowell&#x27;s writings have concentrated on addressing challenges to belief, questions posed by non-Christians, doubts about faith, and non-Christian religions. McDowell tends to present positive arguments to commend belief in Jesus Christ by emphasizing historical and legal proofs to establish the authenticity of the biblical texts and the divinity of Christ.

In books such as &quot;Evidence That Demands a Verdict&quot;, &quot;The Resurrection Factor&quot;, and &quot;He Walked Among Us&quot;, McDowell arranges his arguments by laying out a cumulative case of evidence, such as archaeological discoveries, the extant manuscripts of the biblical texts, fulfilled prophecies, and the miracle of the resurrection. In &quot;More Than A Carpenter&quot; he blends historical arguments with legal argumentation concerning the direct witness and circumstantial evidences for Jesus&#x27; life and resurrection. He employed a similar line of argument in his debate titled &#x27;Was Christ Crucified?&#x27; with the South African Muslim Ahmed Deedat in Durban during August 1981. McDowell says that the &quot;evidence for Christianity in the Scriptures is not exhaustive, but it is sufficient.&quot;

Other foci of his apologetics have included challenging the methodology, assumptions and conclusions drawn in higher criticism of the Old Testament and form and redaction criticism of the gospels. His work in this area has consisted of a popular summary of scholarly debate, particularly from Evangelical discussions about higher critical theories. In the late 1980s and into the 1990s his apologetic writings interacted with challenges expressed in popular books like &quot;The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail&quot;, &quot;The Lost Years of Jesus&quot;, and the writings of the humanist George A. Wells.

He has also collated apologetic arguments concerning the doctrine of Christ&#x27;s deity as in &quot;Jesus: A Biblical Defense of His Deity&quot;. In two companion volumes he and his colleague Don Stewart have addressed popular questions and objections to faith concerning biblical inerrancy and Bible discrepancies, Noah&#x27;s Flood, and creation versus evolution.

McDowell and Stewart have also popularized the arguments of other apologists in the Christian countercult movement, particularly the work of Walter Martin, in the &quot;Handbook of Today&#x27;s Religions&quot;. In their criticisms of cults and occult beliefs McDowell and Stewart concentrate on doctrinal apologetic questions, especially pertaining to the deity of Christ, and pointing out heretical beliefs in the religious groups they profile which they consider to be unorthodox.

McDowell&#x27;s approach to apologetics falls under what Protestant theologians classify as &quot;classical&quot; and &quot;evidential.&quot; In either of these approaches to Christian apologetics, it is assumed that arguments defending the Christian faith can legitimately be directed to both believers and unbelievers because the human mind is viewed as able to comprehend certain truths about God. Presuppositional apologetics, on the other hand, questions this methodology by arguing that since unbelievers partially suppress and resist the truth about God (as Paul states in Romans 1:18–20), the problem of unbelief is also an ethical choice and not simply a lack of evidence.

<text>The Lion and the Witch is a live EP by American rock band Weezer. Recorded in Japan in the spring of 2002 while promoting &quot;Maladroit&quot;, released on September 24, 2002, exactly six years after the release of &quot;Pinkerton.&quot; It was distributed as a limited edition release in independently owned music stores with only 25,000 copies having been made. The album was then rereleased and remastered on vinyl in 2015, with only 3,000 copies made.

Like &quot;Maladroit&quot;, the marketing of this EP caused a rift between Weezer and their record label, Geffen Records. The band wanted an eight-song EP with a unique packaging that would not involve crystal cases. Geffen told the band that the packaging idea was too expensive and the number of songs on the EP needed to be reduced from eight songs to six as to not upset the other retailers, who would not be receiving the disc. The artwork and packaging stuck but the disc&#x27;s length was reduced to six songs, along with a &quot;hidden track&quot;: an instrumental track titled &quot;Polynesia&quot;, which opens the disc.

== Recording ==

While recording the EP, the band makes two errors on this live disc. Rivers Cuomo accidentally begins singing the third verse of &quot;El Scorcho&quot; during the second verse and Scott Shriner, who had been in the band for less than a year at the time of this show, forgets the words in the bridge to &quot;Holiday,&quot; causing the other members of the band to crack up. After the performance is through, Cuomo muses &quot;Scott just won a Grammy!&quot; In addition to that error, the last track is thirty seconds shorter than what the band intended and there is a noticeable cut off on the finished disc. None of the music is missing, but there was more after-song commentary that the band wanted on the disc. The full version of this track was released shortly thereafter on the band&#x27;s website in mp3 format.

== Artwork ==

The cover art was designed by Los Angeles–based duo kozyndan. The liner notes of the album have a number of fan letters from Japanese Weezer fans in broken English. The notes also list production credits for Rupert Peasley, who is known among fans as the man on the couch on the cover of &quot;Maladroit&quot;, and E.O. Smith, which is a pseudonym for Rivers Cuomo, who went to E.O. Smith High School. Only 25,000 individually numbered copies of the disc were made apparently some fans have copies of the disc with numbers over 25,000. As noted at the band&#x27;s website, the numbering was disrupted by printing difficulties with the cardboard sleeve.

<text>George S. Wunder (April 24, 1912 – December 13, 1987) was an American cartoonist best known for his 26 years illustrating the &quot;Terry and the Pirates&quot; comic strip.

Born in Manhattan, Wunder grew up in Kingston, New York. As a youth, he planned a career as a professional comics artist. Other than correspondence courses, including the International Correspondence School art course, he was a self-taught artist. At the age of 24, he began as a staff artist at the Associated Press, where he worked alongside illustrator Noel Sickles and sports cartoonist Tom Paprocki. At AP, Wunder illustrated fiction and various editorial cartoon features, such as &quot;Can Hitler Beat the Russian Jinx?&quot;

During World War II, he served in the Army from 1942 to 1946. Returning to the Associated Press after World War II, he drew the strip &quot;See for Yourself&quot; in 1946 for AP Newsfeatures.

==&quot;Terry and the Pirates&quot;==
In 1946, when Milton Caniff left &quot;Terry and the Pirates&quot;, there were about 100 artists who applied for the job, according to Caniff. Wunder submitted samples, and the Tribune-News Syndicate chose Wunder as Caniff&#x27;s replacement (with former Caniff assistant Lee Elias a close runner-up). Wunder&#x27;s first &quot;Terry and the Pirates&quot; appeared in newspapers on December 30, 1946, launching the story &quot;Trouble in Tibet&quot;. Comics historian Don Markstein noted the transition:
:Terry was left in the hands of George Wunder, a skilled cartoonist who maintained a high level of quality. But Caniff was a unique talent, and nobody could ever truly replace him. Terry Lee had joined the U.S. Air Force during World War II. Wunder left him there, and let him mature fully as an Air Force officer. During the Vietnam Era, military-oriented entertainment declined in popularity. The strip was discontinued in 1973. By that time, Wunder, too, had stopped doing it — although it still bore his byline, it was ghosted by Al Plastino, better known for his work on &quot;Superman&quot;. (Plastino was also handling the pantomime strip &quot;Ferd&#x27;nand&quot;, and later became Ernie Bushmiller&#x27;s assistant on &quot;Nancy&quot;.)

Initially, Wunder drew the strip so it was similar to that of Caniff and Sickles, but he soon developed his own distinctive style. Hotshot Charlie, for example, was drawn in a more openly humorous manner than before. In 1953, Canada Dry offered a &quot;premium giveaway&quot; with a case of its ginger ale — one minibook in a trilogy series of &quot;Terry and the Pirates&quot; strips by Wunder, printed by Harvey Comics. Throughout the 1950s, the Sunday pages used color for psychological effect. One Wunder panel from that period has no blue or green shadows as one might expect; the panel was colored only with orange, red and yellow. In another, Terry is colored green in front, and his back is a yellow-orange. Wunder drew dramatic and highly detailed pictures, but comics historian Maurice Horn claimed it was difficult to tell one character from another and wrote that Wunder&#x27;s stories lacked Caniff&#x27;s essential humor. At the end of the 1950s, Hotshot Charlie was dropped from the strip, which was drawn and colored in a more sedate manner with careful attention to the airplanes flown by Terry Lee and his friends.

Writer-artist Bill Pearson noted that Wunder spent &quot;decades producing a very solid adventure strip. He drew ugly people, even young women, which was certainly a curious trait, but he was one of the &quot;very best&quot; inkers in the business. His technique was flawless.&quot; With his clean and precise inking style, Wunder filled his panels with numerous foreground and background details, as landscape painter Bob Foster observed:
:I read Wunder&#x27;s &quot;Terry&quot; when I was a kid and even then was impressed by all the work he put into it. Every single panel was fully loaded with detailed backgrounds and detailed wrinkles, costumes and hairs, even on all the characters in the background, all the woodgrain in all the wood, and all those black shadows that lent an air of foreboding to each panel. I could never get over his 3/4 rear view of a character&#x27;s eyeball straining to see something behind him. And all those overly bridged noses on both guys and gals all crying out for rhinoplasty. For many years I resented the overloaded panels and decided I didn&#x27;t like Wunder&#x27;s rendering of &quot;Terry and the Pirates&quot;. It was only in the last few years that I came to appreciate Wunder&#x27;s work on &quot;Terry&quot;. One day I realized that he never cheated. He gave us everything in infinite detail in every panel and never deprived us of any wrinkles, bricks, tiles, leaves, woodgrain, fingernails, hairs, cloth patterns or buttons. Yeah, the look-alike facial features of all his characters in the later years of &quot;Terry&quot; was stylistic and bothersome, but he never cheated.

In mid 1962 former EC Comics and Classics Illustrated artist George Evans came on board as Wunder&#x27;s assistant on the daily strip. As Evans related in an interview in &quot;The Comics Journal&quot; #177 (May 1995), &quot;George would lay out the strip, pencil and ink the characters&#x27; heads, and I would finish the strip.&quot; Evans said that during these years Wunder did the Sunday pages all himself. In the same interview he told how he had drawn a daily strip where a general&#x27;s uniform varied from the way Wunder drew the character in the Sunday for that week, necessitating re-drawing parts of the Sunday. Evans offered to help, but Wunder wouldn&#x27;t let him saying, &quot;It wasn&#x27;t your mistake.&quot; Then he dug out his electric eraser and went to work on the Sunday. Evans worked on the strip until it was cancelled in 1973. Other artists who stepped in to assist Wunder included Lee Elias, Russ Heath, Fred Kida, Don Sherwood, Frank Springer and Wally Wood.

==Retirement==
The strip was being carried in 100 newspapers when Wunder retired in 1973. The &quot;New York Daily News&quot; ran every &quot;Terry and the Pirates&quot; daily and Sunday except for the final three weeks by Wunder in 1973. At the time of his retirement, Wunder commented:
:It&#x27;s a strip I&#x27;ve enjoyed doing, but on the other hand, it has been, oh, a chore. The sheer mechanics of producing that much work week in and week out ties you down... Taste in strips seems to be changing. People just don&#x27;t seem to follow continuity strips any more the way they used to. They get an average of three to four complete stories a night off the boob tube. There&#x27;s no reason why they should hang around anywhere from eight to 12 weeks to find out just how one story came out.&quot;

When Wunder, who lived in Sherman, Connecticut, announced his retirement, the syndicate chose to cancel the strip on February 25, 1973. Wunder regarded the cancellation as a Vietnam War casualty, commenting, &quot;The fighter pilot is no longer the glamorous, reckless defender of the free world against all comers. He&#x27;s now the cold-blooded professional dropping napalm on women and children.&quot;

== Death ==

Wunder died of a heart attack in the New Milford Hospital on Sunday, December 13, 1987, survived by his wife, Mildred, and his sister, Beatrice Bogert of Riverdale, New Jersey. At age 87, Mildred &quot;Millie&quot; A. Wunder (née Smith), who was known as &quot;Mrs. Terry and the Pirates,&quot; died March 1, 2001, in Port St. Lucie, Florida after a short illness.

==&quot;Our Guest Star&quot;==
Wunder&#x27;s &quot;Our Guest Star&quot; was a 1955 promotional strip featuring characters from &quot;Terry and the Pirates&quot; with cameo appearances by film stars and other celebrities.
*January 27, 1955 (features Mary Martin)
*April 19, 1955 (features Grace Kelly)
*October 28, 1955 (features Robert Cummings)
*December 29, 1955 (features Charlton Heston)

==Awards==
Wunder was a member of the Illustrators Club and the National Cartoonists Society. On June 11, 1963, he was honored by the United States Air Force with their Exceptional Service Award. In 1970, he received the National Cartoonists Society&#x27;s Silver T-Square Award.

<text>Mark L. Walberg (born August 31, 1962) is an American actor, television personality, and game show host best known for hosting &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot;, &quot;Temptation Island&quot;, and the game shows &quot;Russian Roulette&quot; on GSN and &quot;The Moment of Truth&quot; on Fox.

== Career ==

From September 1995 to May 1996, Walberg hosted his own American syndicated tabloid talk show, &quot;The Mark Walberg Show&quot;.

Walberg is on the board of directors of Goodwill Southern California and the board of managers of the Hollywood/Wilshire YMCA. He plays on the World Poker Tour in the Hollywood Home Games for the Goodwill Industries of Southern California.

On the series finale episode (and also as an April Fools Day episode, as in which he is also a contestant in &quot;Lingo&quot;, playing for charity) on April 1, 2003, Walberg hosted &quot;Friend or Foe?&quot;. His other game shows included &quot;Russian Roulette&quot;, also on Game Show Network, who also appeared as an audience member in the April fools episode as a cameo, and the PAX-TV game show &quot;On the Cover&quot;.

He was slated to host a game show adaptation of the board game &quot;Trivial Pursuit: America Plays&quot; beginning in fall 2008. Although he hosted the pilot, he was unable to get out of his Fox contract and was replaced by Christopher Knight when the series debuted.

In 2010, Walberg hosted a series on CMT titled &quot;Your Chance to Dance&quot;.

Walberg was the host of two television shows. In 2006, he joined the PBS series, &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot;. While staying with the show through many changes in formatting, he left the show after season 23 in 2019. &quot;The Game Plane&quot;, the first game show which is shot on an airplane in flight, debuted on Discovery Family channel in 2014.

In 2011, he made a cameo on &quot;West Coast Report&quot;. Walberg has also been a spokesperson for 23andMe.

He is the current host of &quot;Wheel of Fortune Live!&quot; and &quot;Temptation Island&quot;.

<doc id="1313151" wikidata="Q2302901" url="?curid=1313151" title="Dewclaw">
<text>A dewclaw is a digit – vestigial in some animals – on the foot of many mammals, birds, and reptiles (including some extinct orders, like certain theropods). It commonly grows higher on the leg than the rest of the foot, such that in digitigrade or unguligrade species, it does not make contact with the ground when the animal is standing. The name refers to the dewclaw&#x27;s alleged tendency to brush dew away from grass.&lt;ref name=&quot;Danziger/McCrum&quot;&gt;Danziger, D., &amp; McCrum, M. (2008). &quot;The Thingummy: A book about those everyday objects you just can&#x27;t name&quot;. London: Doubleday.&lt;/ref&gt; On dogs and cats, the dewclaws are on the inside of the front legs, similarly to a human&#x27;s thumb, which shares evolutionary homology. Although many animals have dewclaws, other similar species do not, such as horses, giraffes and the African wild dog.

==Dogs==
Dogs almost always have dewclaws on the inside of the front legs and occasionally also on the hind legs. Unlike front dewclaws, rear dewclaws tend to have little bone or muscle structure in most breeds. It is normal, although not biologically necessary, that certain breeds will have more than one dewclaw on the same paw. One of these dewclaws will most likely be poorly connected to the leg, and is often surgically removed. When a dog has extra dewclaws in addition to the usual one on each front leg, the dog is said to be double dewclawed. For certain dog breeds, a dewclaw is considered a necessity, e.g., a Beauceron for sheep herding and for navigating snowy terrain. As such, there is some debate about whether a dewclaw helps dogs gain traction when they run because, in some dogs, the dewclaw makes contact when they are running and the nail on the dewclaw often wears down in the same way that the nails on their other toes do, from contact with the ground. In many dogs, the dewclaws never contact the ground. In this case, the dewclaw&#x27;s nail never wears away, and it is often trimmed to maintain it at a safe length.

The dewclaws are not dead appendages. They can be used to lightly grip bones and other items that dogs hold with the paws. In some dogs, these claws may not appear to be connected to the leg at all except by a flap of skin; in such dogs, the claws do not have a use for gripping as the claw can easily fold or turn.

===Rear dewclaws===
Canids have four claws on the rear feet, although some domestic dog breeds or individuals have an additional claw, or more rarely two, as is the case with the Beauceron. A more technical term for these additional digits on the rear legs is &quot;hind-limb-specific preaxial polydactyly&quot;. Several genetic mechanisms can cause rear dewclaws; they involve the LMBR1 gene and related parts of the genome. Rear dewclaws often have no phalanx bones and are attached by skin only.

===Dewclaw removal===
There is some debate as to whether dewclaws should be surgically removed. The argument for removal states that dewclaws are a weak digit, barely attached to the leg, and thus they can rip partway off or easily catch on something and break, which can be painful and prone to infection. Dewclaw removal is most easily performed when the dog is young, around 2–5 days of age. It can also be performed on older dogs if necessary though the surgery may be more difficult then. The surgery is fairly straightforward and may be done with local anesthetics if the digit is not well connected to the leg. Many dogs cannot resist licking the surgery site in the weeks following the procedure, so an Elizabethan collar or bitterant may be used to curtail this behavior, thus preventing infection.

Some pups are commonly sold by breeders &quot;dew-clawed&quot;, that is with the dewclaws removed (as by a veterinarian) for perceived health and safety reasons. A few breed standards, such as that for Portuguese Water Dogs, also call for it.

===Dewclaws and locomotion===
Based on stop-action photographs, veterinarian M. Christine Zink of Johns Hopkins University believes that the entire front foot, including the dewclaws, contacts the ground while running. During running, the dewclaw digs into the ground preventing twisting or torque on the rest of the leg. Several tendons connect the front dewclaw to muscles in the lower leg, further demonstrating the front dewclaws&#x27; functionality. There are indications that dogs without dewclaws have more foot injuries and are more prone to arthritis. Zink recommends &quot;for working dogs it is best for the dewclaws not to be amputated. If the dewclaw does suffer a traumatic injury, the problem can be dealt with at that time, including amputation if needed.&quot;

==Cats==
Members of the cat family – including domestic cats and wild cats like the lion – have dewclaws. Generally, a dewclaw grows on the inside of each front leg but not on either hind leg.

The dewclaw on cats is not vestigial. Wild felids use the dewclaw in hunting, where it provides an additional claw with which to catch and hold prey.

==Hoofed animals==

Hoofed animals walk on the tips of special toes, the hooves. Cloven-hoofed animals walk on a central pair of hooves, but many also have an outer pair of dewclaws on each foot. These are somewhat farther up the leg than the main hooves, and similar in structure to them. In some species (such as cattle) the dewclaws are much smaller than the hooves and never touch the ground. In others (such as pigs and many deer), they are only a little smaller than the hooves, and may reach the ground in soft conditions or when jumping. Some hoofed animals (such as giraffes and modern horses) have no dewclaws. Video evidence suggests some animals use dewclaws in grooming or scratching themselves or to have better grasp during mating.

<text>&quot;D&#x27;oh-in&#x27; in the Wind&quot;, also known as &quot;(Annoyed Grunt)-in&#x27; in the Wind&quot;, is the sixth episode of the tenth season of the American animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. It first aired on Fox in the United States on November 15, 1998. In the episode, Homer Simpson travels to a farm owned by Seth and Munchie, two aged hippies who were friends with Homer&#x27;s mother. After finding out his middle name is &quot;Jay&quot;, Homer is drawn to the carefree lifestyle of hippies, and decides to become one himself.

The episode was written by Donick Cary and directed by Mark Kirkland, who was going through a divorce at the time of its production. Due to personal circumstances, Kirkland assigned his assistant director, Matthew Nastuk, to take over the directing duties for a couple of scenes in the episode. However, after Nastuk had directed a scene, Kirkland felt better and returned to direct the rest of the episode. The episode features the revelation of Homer&#x27;s middle name, &quot;Jay&quot;, which is a tribute to characters from &quot;The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show&quot; who got their middle initial from Jay Ward.

The episode features comic actors George Carlin as Munchie and Martin Mull as Seth. Carlin was suggested by &quot;The Simpsons&quot; writer Ron Hauge, who &quot;really wanted to meet him&quot;, although he did not attend the recording session with Carlin and Mull.

In its original broadcast, the episode was seen by approximately 8.4 million viewers. Following the tenth season&#x27;s home release on August 7, 2007, &quot;D&#x27;oh-in&#x27; in the Wind&quot; received mixed reviews from critics.

==Plot==
After starring in a low-quality worker recruitment commercial directed by Mr. Burns for the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, Homer decides he wants to be an actor. As he fills out a Screen Actors Guild application at home, Lisa points out that he has only written his middle initial, J, in the blank for his middle name. Neither Homer nor Grampa know the full name, but Grampa takes Homer to a farm where Mona, Grampa&#x27;s wife and Homer&#x27;s mother, spent some time during her days as a hippie. The farm is run by two middle-aged hippies, Seth and Munchie, who were very good friends of Mona&#x27;s. They point out a mural that she painted based on an incident at Woodstock, which is dedicated to Homer and reveals his middle name as &quot;Jay&quot;.

Seeing how carefree his life would have been as a hippie, Homer decides to become one. He dons a dirty old poncho left behind by Mona and begins to carry a frisbee, but is dismayed to learn that Seth and Munchie are using the farm as headquarters for an organic juice company, the largest in Springfield. He persuades them to accompany him on a &quot;freak-out&quot; ride through Springfield, disrupting the citizens&#x27; daily lives with silly antics. When the three return to the farm afterward, though, they find that Homer&#x27;s frisbee has jammed the juicing machinery and caused the loss of an entire shipment of the farm&#x27;s products. Seth and Munchie angrily order Homer to leave.

To set things right, Homer sneaks back to the farm at night, picks and processes all the vegetables he can find, and delivers the juice shipment to Springfield. In so doing, he unknowingly harvests a hidden field of peyote, which Seth and Munchie had intended for their personal use as recreational drugs. The juice causes intense psychedelic hallucinations in those who drink it, and the police quickly trace it to the farm and move in to arrest Homer, Seth, and Munchie. Homer defends Seth and Munchie by placing himself in the officers&#x27; path, reminding them of the morals and values from the 1960s, and placing a flower in the barrel of each officer&#x27;s rifle. When Chief Wiggum fires, Homer ends up hospitalized with one of the flowers lodged in his skull. Dr. Hibbert refuses to either pull it out or prune its leaves so Homer can watch television, saying that he is a doctor rather than a gardener.

==Production==
&quot;D&#x27;oh-in&#x27; in the Wind&quot; was written by Donick Cary and directed by Mark Kirkland and Matthew Nastuk. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on November 15, 1998. The idea for the episode was pitched by Cary, who thought it would be fun to see the citizens of Springfield hallucinating. He then fleshed it out, forming its current iteration. The episode features the revelation of Homer&#x27;s middle name, &quot;Jay&quot;, which is a &quot;tribute&quot; to animated characters such as Bullwinkle J. Moose and Rocket J. Squirrel from &quot;The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show&quot; who got their middle initial from Jay Ward. The name was pitched on for three days by the writers.

Originally, Kirkland was supposed to be the sole director for the episode, however, at the time, he was going through a divorce that he &quot;did not see coming&quot;. Because of this, Kirkland assigned his assistant director, Matthew Nastuk, to direct the episode in his stead. However, after having directed a scene, Nastuk claimed that he was &quot;terrified&quot; and wanted Kirkland to continue the direction. Kirkland returned to direct the episode, feeling better after getting over the divorce. Despite the circumstances, Kirkland stated that he &quot;loved&quot; working on the episode, and could relate to the story since he had grown up in a &quot;sort of hippie commune school&quot; in the late &#x27;60s and early &#x27;70s. Kirkland based a lot of the scenery designs in the episode on the state of Vermont where, according to him, a lot of &quot;ex-hippies&quot; live.

The two hippies, Seth and Munchie, were portrayed by comic actors Martin Mull and George Carlin respectively. For a while, the staff were not sure of who would play Munchie. Although they had decided on Mull to play Seth, the staff were &quot;kind of stuck&quot; on who would play Munchie. Carlin was suggested by Ron Hauge, one of the &quot;Simpsons&quot; writers, who &quot;really wanted to meet [Carlin]&quot; but ended up not going to the recording session. Scully stated that Mull and Carlin were &quot;some of the funniest guys that ever lived&quot;, and that recording their lines was &quot;a lot of fun&quot;. Although it does not occur with most other guest stars in the series, Mull and Carlin recorded their lines together. While the designs of Seth and Munchie were not modeled after anyone in particular, their hair-styles were slightly based on those of Jerry Greenfield and Ben Cohen, owners of the ice cream company Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s. Comedian Bob Hope was portrayed by series regular cast member Dan Castellaneta, who plays Homer among many other characters in the series. Jill St. John and Phyllis Diller were both voiced by American voice actress Tress MacNeille. The psychedelic version of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;&#x27; main theme that plays during the end credits was performed by Yo La Tengo, an American alternative rock band who are friends of Cary&#x27;s.

== Cultural references ==
The episode makes multiple references to 1960s culture, including films such as &quot;The Love-Ins&quot; (1967). The episode features the theme from the musical &quot;Hair&quot;, &quot;Incense and Peppermints&quot; by Strawberry Alarm Clock (1967), &quot;White Rabbit&quot; by Jefferson Airplane (1967) and &quot;Time of the Season&quot; by The Zombies (1968). In a flashback to Woodstock in 1969, Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s performance of &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; is shown, as is a recreation of the photograph of embracing couple Nick and Bobbi Ercoline taken at the festival and used as a poster for the film &quot;Woodstock&quot; (1970).

Additionally, Homer sings Billy Joel&#x27;s 1983 song &quot;Uptown Girl&quot;. After drinking the tainted juice, Grampa and Jasper sit on a bench, laughing like the title characters from the series &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot;, while Flanders hallucinates skeletons and dancing bears (images associated with the Grateful Dead), marching hammers (from Pink Floyd&#x27;s 1982 film &quot;Pink Floyd—The Wall&quot;) and The Rolling Stones&#x27; lips and tongue logo. Mr. Burns&#x27; film is credited as &quot;An Alan Smithee Film&quot;, a reference to the Alan Smithee pseudonym credit used by directors who wanted to be disassociated from a film on which they had lost creative control, to the detriment of the final product. When Barney drinks alcohol to prevent the bad effects from the tainted juice, a pink elephant comes to his rescue, referencing the scene in Dumbo where Dumbo and Timothy drink alcohol and see pink elephants. Seth and Munchie&#x27;s dog is named Ginsberg, thought to be a reference to beat poet Allen Ginsberg. Homer putting the flowers in the policemen&#x27;s rifles is a reference to the iconic October 22, 1967 &quot;Life&quot; magazine picture, &quot;Flower Power&quot; by Bernie Boston.

The phrase used by Dr. Hibbert regarding Homer&#x27;s condition (&quot;I&#x27;m a doctor, not a gardener&quot;) is a reference to a recurring &quot;Star Trek&quot; gag, when Doctor Leonard McCoy retorts, mostly to Spock, that he is a doctor and not a [whatever the situation refers to].

Additionally, the end credit theme music by Yo La Tengo is presented in a style that parodies &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot; by The Beatles, and as the credits end, Homer says &quot;I buried Flanders&quot;, a reference to the Paul Is Dead myth.

==Reception==
In its original American broadcast on November 15, 1998, &quot;D&#x27;oh-in&#x27; in the Wind&quot; received an 8.5 rating, according to Nielsen Media Research, translating to approximately 8.3 million viewers. The episode finished in 40th place in the ratings for the week of November 9–15, 1999. On August 7, 2007, the episode was released as part of &quot;The Simpsons - The Complete Tenth Season&quot; DVD box set. Matt Groening, Mike Scully, George Meyer, Donick Cary, Ron Hauge and Mark Kirkland participated in the DVD&#x27;s audio commentary of the episode.

Following its home video release, &quot;D&#x27;oh-in&#x27; in the Wind&quot; received mixed reviews from critics.

Giving the episode a positive review, Aaron Roxby of Collider wrote that, even though he felt that the jokes about hippies were &quot;a bit overplayed&quot;, he still considered it to be one of the best episodes of the season.

James Plath of DVD Town thought fondly of the episode as well, calling it &quot;funny&quot;.

Writing for DVD Movie Guide, Colin Jacobson stated that, even though he feels the sixties have been lampooned &quot;many, many times over the years&quot;, he considered &quot;D&#x27;oh-in&#x27; in the Wind&quot; to be a successful spoof of the era. He enjoyed the way the episode portrayed and mocked the ways aging hippies &quot;didn&#x27;t live up to their youthful ideas&quot;. He concluded his review by writing that &quot;D&#x27;oh-in&#x27; in the Wind&quot; is one of the first great episodes of the season.

However, Jake McNeill of Digital Entertainment News did not enjoy the episode. Considering it to be one of the worst episodes of the season, he found the &quot;jabs&quot; at the hippie culture to be dated, writing that the episode is &quot;a quarter century too late&quot;.

Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood of &quot;I Can&#x27;t Believe It&#x27;s a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide&quot; were negative as well, calling the episode &quot;dreadful&quot;. They wrote that, aside from a couple of references to sixties psychedelia and the hippie movement, the only significant part of the episode is the revelation of Homer&#x27;s middle name. They concluded by writing that the episode is &quot;humourless&quot;.

<text>Purchasing is the procurement process a business or organization uses to acquire goods or services to accomplish its goals. Although there are several organizations that attempt to set standards in the purchasing process, processes can vary greatly between organizations.

Purchasing is part of the wider procurement process, which typically also includes expediting, supplier quality, transportation, and logistics.

== Details ==
Purchasing managers/directors, procurement managers/directors, or staff based in an organization&#x27;s Purchasing Office, guide the organization&#x27;s acquisition procedures and standards and operational purchasing activities.

Most organizations use a three-way check as the foundation of their purchasing programs. This involves three departments in the organization completing separate parts of the acquisition process. The three departments do not all report to the same senior manager, to prevent unethical practices and lend credibility to the process. These departments can be purchasing, receiving and accounts payable; or engineering, purchasing and accounts payable; or a plant manager, purchasing and accounts payable. Combinations can vary significantly, but a purchasing department and accounts payable are usually two of the three departments involved. Organizations typically have simpler procedures in place for low value purchasing, for example the UK&#x27;s Ministry of Defence has a separate internal policy for low value purchasing valued below £10,000. When the receiving department is not involved, it is typically called a two-way check or two-way purchase order. In this situation, the purchasing department issues the purchase order receipt not required. When an invoice arrives against the order, the accounts payable department will then go directly to the requestor of the purchase order to verify that the goods or services were received. This is typically what is done for goods and services that will bypass the receiving department. A few examples are software delivered electronically, NRE work (non-reoccurring engineering services), consulting hours, etc.

Historically, the purchasing department issued purchase orders for supplies, services, equipment, and raw materials. Then, in an effort to decrease the administrative costs associated with the repetitive ordering of basic consumable items, &quot;blanket&quot; or &quot;master&quot; agreements were put into place. These types of agreements typically have a longer duration and increased scope to maximize the quantities of scale concept. When additional supplies were required, a simple release would be issued to the supplier to provide the goods or services.

Another method of decreasing administrative costs associated with repetitive contracts for common material, is the use of company credit cards, also known as &quot;Purchasing Cards&quot; or simply &quot;P-Cards&quot;. P-card programs vary, but all of them have internal checks and audits to ensure appropriate use. Purchasing managers realized once contracts for the low dollar value consumables are in place, procurement can take a smaller role in the operation and use of the contracts. There is still oversight in the forms of audits and monthly statement reviews, but most of their time is now available to negotiate major purchases and setting up of other long-term contracts. These contracts are typically renewable annually.

This trend away from the daily procurement function (tactical purchasing) resulted in several changes in the industry. The first was the reduction of personnel. Purchasing departments were now smaller. There was no need for the army of clerks processing orders for individual parts as in the past. Another change was the focus on negotiating contracts and procurement of large capital equipment. Both of these functions permitted purchasing departments to make the biggest financial contribution to the organization. A new term and job title emerged – Strategic sourcing and Sourcing Managers. These professionals not only focused on the bidding process and negotiating with suppliers, but the entire supply function. In these roles they were able to add value and maximize savings for organizations. This value was manifested in lower inventories, fewer personnel, and getting the end product to the consumer quicker. Purchasing managers&#x27; success in these roles resulted in new assignments outside to the traditional purchasing function – logistics, materials management, distribution, and warehousing. More and more purchasing managers were becoming Supply Chain Managers handling additional functions of their organization&#x27;s operation. Purchasing managers were not the only ones to become Supply Chain Managers. Logistic managers, material managers, distribution managers, etc. all rose to the broader function and some had responsibility for the purchasing functions now.

In accounting, purchases is the amount of goods a company bought throughout this year. It also refers to information as to the kind, quality, quantity, and cost of goods bought that should be maintained. They are added to inventory. Purchases are offset by purchase discounts and Purchase Returns and Allowances. When it should be added depends on the Free On Board (FOB) policy of the trade. For the purchaser, this new inventory is added on shipment if the policy was FOB shipping point, and the seller remove this item from its inventory. On the other hand, the purchaser added this inventory on receipt if the policy was FOB destination, and the seller remove this item from its inventory when it was delivered.

Goods bought for the purpose other than direct selling, such as for Research and Development, are added to inventory and allocated to Research and Development expense as they are used. On a side note, equipment bought for Research and Development are not added to inventory, but are capitalized as assets.

=== Acquisition process ===
The revised acquisition process for major systems in the U.S. Department of Defense is shown in the next figure. The process is defined by a series of phases during which technology is defined and matured into viable concepts, which are subsequently developed and readied for production, after which the systems produced are supported in the field.
The process allows for a given system to enter the process at any of the development phases. For example, a system using unproven technology would enter at the beginning stages of the process and
would proceed through a lengthy period of technology maturation, while a system based on mature
and proven technologies might enter directly into engineering development or, conceivably, even production. The process itself includes four phases of development:

* Concept and Technology Development: is intended to explore alternative concepts based on assessments of operational needs, technology readiness, risk, and affordability.
* Concept and Technology Development phase begins with concept exploration. During this stage, concept studies are undertaken to define alternative concepts and to provide information about capability and risk that would permit an objective comparison of competing concepts.
* System Development and Demonstration phase. This phase could be entered directly as a result of a technological opportunity and urgent user need, as well as having come through concept and technology development.
* The last, and longest, phase is the Sustainment and Disposal phase of the program. During this phase all necessary activities are accomplished to maintain and sustain the system in the field in the most cost-effective manner possible.

=== Selection of bidders ===
This is the process where the organization identifies potential suppliers for specified supplies, services or equipment. These suppliers&#x27; credentials and history are analyzed, with the products or services they offer. The bidder selection process varies from organization to organization, but can include running credit reports, interviewing management, testing products, and touring facilities. This process is not always done in order of importance, but rather in order of expense. Often purchasing managers research potential bidders obtaining information on the organizations and products from media sources and their own industry contacts. Additionally, purchasing might send Request for Information (RFI) to potential suppliers to help gather information. Engineering would also inspect sample products to determine if the company or organisation can produce products they need. If the bidder passes both of these stages engineering may decide to do some testing on the materials to further verify quality standards. These tests can be expensive and involve significant time of multiple technicians and engineers. Engineering management must make this decision based on the cost of the products they are likely to procure, the importance of the bidders’ product to production, and other factors. Credit checks, interviewing management, touring plants as well as other steps could all be utilized if engineering, manufacturing, and supply chain managers decide they could help their decision and the cost is justifiable.

Other organizations might have minority procurement goals to consider in selection of bidders. Organizations identify goals in the use of woman-owned or minority-owned businesses. Significant utilizing of minority suppliers may qualify the firm as a potential bidder for a contract with a company or governmental entity looking to increase their minority supplier programs.

This selection process can include or exclude international suppliers depending on organizational goals and criteria. Companies looking to increase their pacific rim supplier base may exclude suppliers from the Americas, Europe, and Australia. Other organizations may be looking to purchase domestically to ensure a quicker response to orders as well as easier collaboration on design and production.

Organizational goals will dictate the criteria for the selection process of bidders. It is also possible that the product or service being procured is so specialized that the number of bidders are limited and the criteria must be very wide to permit competition. If only one firm can meet the specifications for the product then the purchasing managers must consider utilizing a “Sole Source” option or work with engineering to broaden the specifications if the project will permit alteration in the specifications. The sole source option is the part of the selection of bidders that acknowledges there is sometimes only one reasonable supplier for some services or products. This can be because of the limited applications for the product cannot support more than one manufacturer, proximity of the service provided, or the products are newly designed or invented and competition is not yet available.

=== Bidding process ===
This is the process an organization utilizes to procure goods, services or equipment. Processes vary significantly from the stringent to the very informal. Large corporations and governmental entities are most likely to have stringent and formal processes. These processes can utilize specialized bid forms that require specific procedures and detail. The very stringent procedures require bids to be open by several staff from various departments to ensure fairness and impartiality. Responses are usually very detailed. Bidders not responding exactly as specified and following the published procedures can be disqualified. Smaller private businesses are more likely to have less formal procedures. Bids can be in the form of an email to all of the bidders specifying products or services. Responses by bidders can be detailed or just the proposed dollar amount.

Most bid processes are multi-tiered. Acquisitions under a specified dollar amount can be “user discretion” permitting the request or to choose who ever they want. This level can be as low as $100 or as high as $10,000 depending on the organization. The rationale is the savings realized by processing these request the same as expensive items is minimal and does not justify the time and expense. Purchasing departments watch for abuses of the user discretion privilege. Acquisitions in a mid range can be processed with a slightly more formal process. This process may involve the user providing quotes from three separate suppliers. Purchasing may be asked or required to obtain the quotes. The formal bid process starts as low as $10,000 or as high as $100,000 depending on the organization. The bid usually involves a specific form the bidder fills out and must be returned by a specified deadline. Depending on the commodity being purchased and the organization the bid may specify a weighted evaluation criterion. Other bids would be evaluated at the discretion of purchasing or the end users. Some bids could be evaluated by a cross-functional committee. Other bids may be evaluated by the end user or the buyer in purchasing. Especially in small, private firms the bidders could be evaluated on criteria or factors that have little if anything to do with the actual bid. Examples of these factors are history of the bidder with the company, history of the bidder with the company&#x27;s senior management at other firms, and bidder&#x27;s breadth of products.

=== Technical evaluation ===

Technical evaluations, evaluations of the technical suitability of the quoted goods or services, if required, are normally performed prior to the commercial evaluation. During this phase of the procurement process, a technical representative of the company (usually an engineer) will review the proposal and designate each bidder as either technically acceptable or technically unacceptable.

Technical evaluation is usually carried out against a set of pre-determined technical evaluation criteria. There are two types of criteria, general criteria (whereby scores are given if they are met) and essential criteria (failing of which shall render the bid technically disqualified).

=== Commercial evaluation ===
Cost of Money is calculated by multiplying the applicable currency&#x27;s interest rate by the amount of money paid prior to the receipt of the goods. If the money was to have remained in the buyer&#x27;s account, interest would be drawn. That interest is essentially an additional cost associated with such progress or milestone payments.

The manufacturing location is taken into consideration during the evaluation stage primarily to calculate for freight costs and regional issues. For instance, it is common in Europe for factories to close during the month of August for a summer holiday. Labor agreements may also be taken into consideration and may be drawn into the evaluation if the particular region is known to have frequent labor disputes.

The manufacturing lead-time is the time from the placement of the order (or time final drawings are submitted by the buyer to the seller) until the goods are manufactured and prepared for delivery. Lead-times vary by commodity and can range from several days to years.

Transportation time is evaluated while comparing the delivery of goods to the buyer&#x27;s required use-date. If goods are shipped from a remote port, with infrequent vessel transportation, the transportation time could exceed the schedule and adjustments would need to be made.

Delivery Charges - the charge for the goods to be delivered to a stated point.
* Bid validity
* Packing
* Bid adjustments
* Terms and Conditions
* Seller&#x27;s services
* Standards organizations
* Financial review
* Payment currency
* Risk analysis (market volatility, financial stress within the bidders)
* Testing

=== Negotiating ===
Negotiating is a key skillset in the purchasing field. One of the goals of purchasing agents is to acquire goods per the most advantageous terms of the buying entity (or simply, the &quot;buyer&quot;). Purchasing agents typically attempt to decrease costs while meeting the buyer&#x27;s other requirements such as an on-time delivery, compliance to the commercial terms and conditions (including the warranty, the transfer of risk, assignment, auditing rights, confidentiality, remedies, etc.).

Good negotiators, those with high levels of documented &quot;cost savings&quot;, receive a premium within the industry relative to their compensation. Depending on the employment agreement between the buyer and the employer, buyer&#x27;s cost savings can result in the creation of value to the business, and may result in a flat-rate bonus, or a percentage payout to the purchasing agent of the documented cost savings.

Purchasing departments, while they can be considered as a support function of the key business, are actually revenue generating departments. For example, if the company needs to buy US$30 million of widgets and the purchasing department secures the widgets for $25M USD, the purchasing department would have saved the company $5M USD. That savings could exceed the annual budget of the department, which in effect would pay the department&#x27;s overhead - the employee&#x27;s salaries, computers, office space, etc.

=== Post-award administration ===
Post-award administration typically consists of making minor changes, additions or subtractions, that in some way change the terms of the agreement or the seller&#x27;s scope of supply. Such changes are often minor, but for auditing purposes must be documented into the existing agreement. Examples include increasing the quantity of a line Item or changing the metallurgy of a particular component.

=== Order closeout ===
Is the closing of order.

<text>Mary Barton: A Tale of Manchester Life was the first novel by English author Elizabeth Gaskell, first published in 1848. The story is set in the English city of Manchester between 1839 and 1842, and deals with the difficulties faced by the Victorian working class.

==Plot summary==
The novel begins in Manchester, where we are introduced to the Bartons and the Wilsons, two working-class families. John Barton is a questioner of the distribution of wealth and the relations between rich and poor. Soon his wife dies—he blames it on her grief over the disappearance of her sister Esther. Having already lost his son Tom at a young age, Barton is left to raise his daughter, Mary, alone and now falls into depression and begins to involve himself in the Chartist, trade-union movement.

Chapter 1 takes place in the countryside where Greenheys is now.

Mary takes up work at a dressmaker&#x27;s (her father had objected to her working in a factory) and becomes subject to the affections of hard-working Jem Wilson and Harry Carson, son of a wealthy mill owner. She fondly hopes, by marrying Carson, to secure a comfortable life for herself and her father, but immediately after refusing Jem&#x27;s offer of marriage she realizes that she truly loves &quot;him&quot;. She, therefore, decides to evade Carson, planning to show her feelings to Jem in the course of time. Jem believes her decision to be final, though this does not change his feelings for her.

Meanwhile, Esther, a &quot;street-walker,&quot; returns to warn John Barton that he must save Mary from becoming like her. He simply pushes her away, however, and she&#x27;s sent to jail for a month on the charge of vagrancy. Upon her release, she talks to Jem with the same purpose. He promises that he will protect Mary and confronts Carson, eventually entering into a fight with him, which is witnessed by a policeman passing by.

Not long afterward, Carson is shot dead, and Jem is arrested for the crime, his gun having been found at the scene. Esther decides to investigate the matter further and discovers that the wadding for the gun was a piece of paper on which is written Mary&#x27;s name.

She visits her niece to warn her to save the one she loves, and after she leaves Mary realizes that the murderer is not Jem but her father. She is now faced with having to save her lover without giving away her father. With the help of Job Legh (the intelligent grandfather of her blind friend Margaret), Mary travels to Liverpool to find the only person who could provide an alibi for Jem – Will Wilson, Jem&#x27;s cousin and a sailor, who was with him on the night of the murder. Unfortunately, Will&#x27;s ship is already departing, so that, after Mary chases after the ship in a small boat, the only thing Will can do is promise to return in the pilot ship and testify the next day.

During the trial, Jem learns of Mary&#x27;s great love for him. Will arrives in court to testify, and Jem is found &quot;not guilty&quot;. Mary has fallen ill during the trial and is nursed by Mr. Sturgis, an old sailor, and his wife. When she finally returns to Manchester she has to face her father, who is crushed by his remorse. He summons John Carson, Harry&#x27;s father, to confess to him that he is the murderer. Carson is still set on justice, but after turning to the Bible he forgives Barton, who dies soon afterward in Carson&#x27;s arms. Not long after this Esther comes back to Mary&#x27;s home, where she, too, soon dies.

Jem decides to leave England, where, his reputation damaged, it would be difficult for him to find a new job. The novel ends with the wedded Mary and Jem, their little child, and Mrs. Wilson living happily in Canada. The news comes that Margaret has regained her sight and that she and Will, soon to be married, will visit.

==Background and composition==
In beginning to write novels, it was Gaskell&#x27;s hope that they would provide some solace from the pain of the loss of her son Willie. The idea, according to her early biographer Ellis Chadwick, was first suggested by her husband William Gaskell to &quot;soothe her sorrow&quot;. In an 1849 letter to her friend Mrs. Greg, Gaskell said that she, &quot;took refuge in the invention to exclude the memory of painful scenes which would force themselves upon my remembrance.&quot;

However, it is clear from her preface that the suffering she saw around her was the motivational factor for the content of the novel: &quot;I had always felt a deep sympathy with the care-worn men, who looked as if doomed to struggle through their lives in strange alternations between work and want[...] The more I reflected on this unhappy state of things between those so bound to each other by common interests, as the employers and the employed must ever be, the more anxious I became to give some utterance to the agony which from time to time convulsed this dumb person.&quot;

Gaskell&#x27;s desire to accurately represent the poverty of industrial Manchester is evident in a record of a visit she made to the home of a local labourer. On comforting the family, Hompes records, the &quot;head of the family took hold of her arm and grasping it tightly, said, with tears in his eyes: &#x27;Aye, ma&#x27;am, but have ye ever seen a child clemmed to death?&#x27;&quot; This question is almost precisely repeated in the mouth of John Barton: &quot;Han they ever have seen a child o&#x27; their&#x27;n die for want o&#x27; food?&quot; in chapter 4.

As well as relying on her own experience, Gaskell is thought to have used secondary sources on which to base the setting of the story, including Kay&#x27;s &quot;The moral and physical condition of the working classes involved in the cotton manufacture in Manchester&quot; (1832) and Peter Gaskell&#x27;s &quot;The manufacturing population of England&quot; (1833). Other details to which Gaskell paid particular attention to ensure the realism of the novel include the topography of both Manchester and Liverpool (including the rural environment detailed in the first chapter, and references to road names and prominent buildings), the superstitions and customs of the local people and the dialect. In the earliest editions, William Gaskell added the footnotes explaining some of the words specific to the Lancashire dialect, and after the fifth edition (1854), two lectures of his on the subject were added as appendices. It is widely thought that the murder of Harry Carson in the novel was inspired by the assassination of Thomas Ashton, a Manchester mill-owner, in 1831.

&quot;Mary Barton&quot; was first published as two volumes in October 1848. Gaskell was paid £100 for the novel. The publisher Edward Chapman had had the manuscript since the middle of 1847. He had several recorded influences on the novel, the most prominent of which is probably the change in title: the novel was originally entitled &quot;John Barton&quot;. Gaskell said that he was, &quot;the central figure to my mind...he was my &#x27;hero&#x27;.&quot; He also encouraged Gaskell to include chapters 36 and 37, the dialectical glosses added by William Gaskell, a preface and the chapter epigraphs.

The second edition, with Gaskell&#x27;s corrections, particularly on typographical mistakes when writing the Lancashire dialect, appeared on 3 January 1849. The third edition soon followed, in February. A fourth, without Gaskell&#x27;s involvement, appeared in October 1850. The fifth edition, from 1854, was the first single volume edition and included William Gaskell&#x27;s lectures on the dialect. Mary Barton uses the word &quot;wench&quot; a total of 42 times.

==Analysis==

===Genre===
One element of the novel that has been a subject of heavy criticism is the apparent shift in genres between the political focus of the early chapters to the domestic in the later ones. Raymond Williams particularly saw this as a failure by the author: the early chapters, he said, are the &quot;most moving response in the literature to the industrial suffering of the 1840s&quot;, but in the later, the novel becomes a &quot;familiar and orthodox...Victorian novel of sentiment&quot;. Williams suggested that this shift may have been at the influence of her publishers, an idea supported by the title change, which changes the main focus of the reader from the political upheaval John is trying to promote to Mary&#x27;s emotional journey.

However, Kamilla Elliot disagrees with Williams about the weakness of the domestic genre, saying, &quot;It is the romance plot, not the political plot, that contains the more radical political critique in the novel.&quot;

===Style===
It is a subject of some debate whether the first person narrator in &quot;Mary Barton&quot; is synonymous with Gaskell. On the one hand, the consistent use of tone through the original preface and the novel, and authorial insets like the first paragraph of chapter 5 suggest the Gaskell is directly narrating the story. Contrarily, critics like Lansbury suggest the narrator is too unsympathetic in all Gaskell&#x27;s Manchester novels to be her own voice:
Nothing could be more unwise than to regard the authorial &#x27;I&#x27; of the novels as the voice of Elizabeth Gaskell, particularly in the Manchester novels. The narrator has a tendency to engage in false pleading and specious argument, while the workers demonstrate honesty and commonsense.

Hopkins goes so far as to claim that the detail to verisimilitude in the novel made it the first &quot;respectable&quot; social novel, in contrast with the lack of believability in, for example, Disraeli&#x27;s &quot;Sybil&quot; or Tonna&#x27;s &quot;Helen Fleetwood&quot;.

Prominent in the novel is Gaskell&#x27;s attempt to reinforce the realism of her representation through the inclusion of &quot;working-class discourses&quot;, not only through the use of closely imitated colloquialisms and dialect, but also through &quot;passages from Chartist poems, working class ballads, proverbs, maxims, and nursery rhymes, as John Barton&#x27;s radical discourse, Ben Davenport&#x27;s deathbed curses, and Job Legh&#x27;s language of Christian submission.&quot;

===Themes===
Kathleen Mary Tillotson wrote that &quot;Mary Barton&quot; is &quot;built on the assumptions of &quot;Chartism&quot; and &quot;Past and Present&quot;&quot;, two works of social criticism by Thomas Carlyle.

The first half of the novel focuses mainly on the comparison between the rich and poor. In a series of set pieces across the opening chapters, we are shown the lifestyles of the Bartons, Wilsons (most prominently in the chapter &quot;A Manchester Tea-Party&quot;) and Davenport&#x27;s respective households compared to the contrasting affluence of the Carson establishment (in the chapter &quot;Poverty and Death&quot;). A key symbol shown in this chapter is the use of five shillings; this amount being the price John Barton receives for pawning most of his possessions, but also the loose change in Harry Carson&#x27;s pocket.

Gaskell details the importance of the mother in a family; as is seen from the visible decline in John Barton&#x27;s physical and moral well-being after his wife&#x27;s death. This view is also symbolized by Job Legh&#x27;s inability to care for Margaret as a baby in the chapter &quot;Barton&#x27;s London Experience&quot;. The theme of motherhood is connected to declining masculinity: Surridge points out that the roles of nurturing fall towards the men as bread-winning falls away. Both Wilson and Barton are pictured holding the infants in the place of the nanny that can&#x27;t be afforded as the novel begins, but eventually, both end up relying on the income of their children, Jem and Mary respectively.

The second half of the book deals mainly with the murder plot. Here it can be seen that redemption is also a key aspect of the novel; not least because of the eventual outcome of the relationship between Messrs Carson and Barton, but also in Gaskell&#x27;s presentation of Esther, the typical &quot;fallen woman&quot;. The selfless nature she gives the character, on several occasions having her confess her faults with brutal honesty, is an attempt to make the reader sympathize with the character of a prostitute, unusual for the time.

Indeed, throughout the novel Gaskell appears to refer to her characters as being out of her control, acting as not so much a narrator but a guide for the observing reader. Another aspect of the passivity of the characters is, as some suggest, that they represent the impotence of the class to defend or even represent, themselves politically. Cooney draws attention to this in the scene in which the factory is on fire – a scene the reader anticipates to be domestic fails in its domestic role (one might imagine Jem&#x27;s heroism to prompt Mary to discover her true feelings) actually sees the crowd passively at the mercy of ill-equipped firemen and unconcerned masters.

Several times Gaskell attempts to mask her strong beliefs in the novel by disclaiming her knowledge of such matters as economics and politics, but the powerful language she gives to her characters, especially John Barton in the opening chapter, is a clear indication of the author&#x27;s interest in the class divide. She openly pleads for reducing this divide through increased communication and, as a consequence, understanding between employers and workmen and generally through a more human behaviour based on Christian principles, at the same time presenting her own fears of how the poor will eventually act in retaliation to their oppression.

Gaskell also describes an Italian torture chamber where the victim is afforded many luxuries at first but in the end, the walls of the cell start closing in and finally they crush him. It is believed that the story has been influenced by William Mudford&#x27;s short story &quot;The Iron Shroud&quot;. Stephen Derry mentions that Gaskell uses the concept of the shrinking cell to describe John Barton&#x27;s state of mind but also added the element of luxury to further enhance it.

Death plays a significant and unavoidable role in the plot: it has been interpreted both as mere realism (Lucas points out the average mortality rate at the time was 17) and autobiographically as the cathartic relief of grief over her son&#x27;s premature death. The image of a dying child was also a trope of Chartist discourse.

==Reception==
The novel was first published anonymously, but its authorship was widely known within a year.

Early reception of the novel was divided, with some praising its honesty and fidelity to facts and others criticising it for presenting a distorted picture of the employer-employee relationships. The &quot;British Quarterly Review&quot; said it was a &quot;one-sided picture&quot;, and the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot; that the division between employers and employed was exaggerated. They were echoed by the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; and the &quot;Prospective Review&quot;, however the &quot;Athenaeum&quot;, the &quot;Eclectic Review&quot;, the &quot;Christian Examiner&quot; and &quot;Fraser&#x27;s Magazine&quot; took a different stance. The &quot;Athenaeum&#x27;s&quot; otherwise positive review raised the question of whether &quot;it may be kind or wise or right to make fiction the vehicle for a plain, matter of fact exposition of social evils&quot;.

Thomas Carlyle wrote a letter to Gaskell in which he called it &quot;a Book seeming to take its place far above the ordinary garbage of Novels&quot;.

Part of the sensation the novel created was due to the anonymity with which it was published. Gaskell claimed that on occasion she had even joined in with discussions making guesses at the authorship.

==Adaptations==
There have been a few stage adaptations (mostly loosely so and mostly in the 19th century) and one adaptation in each of radio and television. There have been no films, although one of the stage adaptations has been filmed a number of times.

===Radio===
In 2001, the BBC broadcast a 20-episode serialisation of Mary Barton.

===Television===
The BBC broadcast a four-episode series in 1964. All four episodes (&#x27;Fire&#x27;, &#x27;Violence&#x27;, &#x27;Murder&#x27;, and &#x27;Trial&#x27;), are believed lost, although it has been hypothesised that copies may still exist in BBC Archives. Directed by Michael Imison, it featured Lois Daine (Mary Barton), George A. Cooper (John Barton), Barry Warren (Jem Wilson), Gwendolyn Watts (Margaret Legh), Brian Peck (Will Wilson) and Patrick Mower (Harry Carson).

In 2012, there were reports that the screenwriter Heidi Thomas (who wrote the script for the BBC serialisation of &quot;Cranford&quot;) was working on a TV adaption of Mary Barton for the BBC, but nothing seems to have come of this.

===Theatre===
The first adaptation occurred soon after publication, by the playwright John Courtney at The Old Vic, then called the Victoria Theatre, in 1851. While the novel targeted middle and upper class readers, Courtney&#x27;s production engaged a specifically working-class audience – according to the playbill, it was &#x27;written expressly for this Theatre&#x27;, meaning the local working class community.

In the years following, there were then a number of stage productions, based more or less loosely on the plot and themes of the novel: Colin Hazlewood, &quot;Our Lot in Life&quot;, 1862; Dion Boucicault, &quot;The Long Strike&quot;, 1866 (at the Lyceum, in which the political plot was removed and which also incorporated elements of &quot;Lizzie Leigh&quot;); J P Weston, &quot;The Lancashire Strike&quot;, 1867; George Sims, &quot;The Last Chance&quot;, 1885; and, best-known, Stanley Houghton, &quot;Hindle Wakes&quot;, 1912, of which there have been four film versions.

In 2016 Rona Munro wrote a 2-act version, which premiered at the Royal Exchange, Manchester. It was directed by Sarah Frankcom and designed by Liz Ascroft, and featured Kellie Bright in the lead role.

<text>Lee Friedlander (; born July 14, 1934) is an American photographer and artist. In the 1960s and 1970s, Friedlander evolved an influential and often imitated visual language of urban &quot;social landscape,&quot; with many of his photographs including fragments of store-front reflections, structures framed by fences, posters and street signs. His work is characterized by its innovative use of framing and reflection, often using the natural environment or architectural elements to frame his subjects. Over the course of his career, Friedlander has been the recipient of numerous awards and his work has been exhibited in major museums and galleries worldwide (Museum of Modern Art, New York. Corcoran Gallery of Art. National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne).

== Life and work ==
Friedlander was born in Aberdeen, Washington, on July 14, 1934 to Kaari Nurmi (Finnish descent) and Fritz (Fred) Friedlander (a German-Jewish émigré). His mother died of cancer when he was seven years old. 

Already earning pocket-money as a photographer by age 14, he went on at the age of 18 to study photography at the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California. In 1956, he moved to New York City, where he photographed jazz musicians for record album covers. His early work was influenced by Eugène Atget, Robert Frank and Walker Evans. Friedlander is regarded as one of Atget&#x27;s heirs. In 1960, Friedlander was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship to focus on his art, and was awarded subsequent grants in 1962 and 1977. Some of his most famous photographs appeared in the September 1985 &quot;Playboy&quot;, black and white nude photographs of Madonna from the late 1970s. A student at the time, she was paid $25 for her 1979 set. In 2009, one of the images fetched $37,500 at a Christie&#x27;s Art House auction.

Working primarily with hand-held Leica 35 mm cameras and black-and-white film, Friedlander&#x27;s style has focused on the &quot;social landscape.&quot; His photographs used detached images of urban life, store-front reflections, structures framed by fences, and posters and signs all combining to capture the look of &quot;modern life.&quot;

In 1963, Nathan Lyons, assistant director and Curator of Photography at the International Museum of Photography at George Eastman House, mounted Friedlander&#x27;s first solo exhibition. Friedlander was then a key figure in curator John Szarkowski&#x27;s 1967 &quot;New Documents&quot; exhibition, at the Museum of Modern Art in New York along with Garry Winogrand and Diane Arbus. In 1973, his work was honored at the Rencontres d&#x27;Arles festival in France with the screening &quot;Soirée américaine : Judy Dater, Jack Welpott, Jerry Uelsmann, Lee Friedlander&quot; presented by Jean-Claude Lemagny. In 1990, the MacArthur Foundation awarded Friedlander a MacArthur Fellowship. In 2005, the Museum of Modern Art presented a major retrospective of Friedlander&#x27;s career, including nearly 400 photographs from the 1950s to the present; it was presented again in 2008 at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. In 2022, contemporary photographer Joseph Maida discussed Friedlander&#x27;s work from the 1970s and 80&#x27;s in his monograph &quot;A Third Look,&quot;.

In 2023, Joel Coen curated an exhibition of 70 of Friedlander&#x27;s photographs, which were shown (45 different photographs at each site) at the Fraenkel Gallery in San Francisco and in New York at Luhring Augustine. 

While suffering from arthritis and housebound, he focused on photographing his surroundings. His book &quot;Stems&quot; reflects his life during the time of his knee replacement surgery. He has said that his &quot;limbs&quot; reminded him of plant stems.

Friedlander began photographing parks designed by Frederick Law Olmsted for a six-year commission from the Canadian Centre for Architecture in Montreal, beginning in 1988. After completing the commission he continued to photograph Olmsted-designed parks for 20 years in total. His series includes New York City&#x27;s Central Park; Brooklyn&#x27;s Prospect Park; Manhattan&#x27;s Morningside Park; World&#x27;s End in Hingham, Massachusetts; Cherokee Park in Louisville, Kentucky; and Niagara Falls State Park. On the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the design for Central Park, the Metropolitan Museum of Art held an exhibition of Friedlander&#x27;s photographs of that park and a book was published, &quot;Photographs: Frederick Law Olmsted Landscapes&quot;. &quot;

Friedlander now works primarily with medium format cameras, such as the Hasselblad Superwide.

==Personal life==
It has been claimed that Friedlander is &quot;notoriously media shy,&quot; but he did grant an interview to &quot;The New York Times&quot; in April 2023, in which he discussed his work.

He married his wife Maria in 1958. She has been the subject of many of his portraits.

Their daughter Anna is married to photographer Thomas Roma. Their son Erik is a cellist and composer.

<doc id="1313190" wikidata="Q1640404" url="?curid=1313190" title="Beaujolais nouveau">
<text>Beaujolais nouveau ( , ) is a red wine made from Gamay grapes produced in the Beaujolais region of France. It is a &quot;vin de primeur&quot;, fermented just a few weeks before being released for sale on the third Thursday of November. Distributors famously race to get the first bottles to different global markets.

== History ==
As far back as the 1800s, Beaujolais growers would gather to celebrate the end of the harvest by toasting the vintage with some of the young wine produced that year (this is part of the French tradition of vin de primeur, or &quot;early wines&quot;, released in the same year as harvest, which 55 appellations in France are allowed to produce). During this time, Lyonnais barkeepers and restaurateurs had been buying barrels of this new Beaujolais wine, which had been pressed in September and ready to serve in November. The new wine was served via pitchers dipped into barrels. The barrels were sometimes transported simply by floating them down the Saône river. Once the Beaujolais AOC was established in 1937, AOC rules meant that Beaujolais wine could only be officially sold after 15 December in the year of harvest. These rules were relaxed in November 1951, and the Union Interprofessionnelle des Vins du Beaujolais (Uivb) formally set 15 November as the release date for what would henceforth be known as Beaujolais nouveau. In 1985, the Institut National des Appellations d&#x27;Origine (INAO) established the third Thursday of November to allow for a uniform release date for the wine.

The wine used to be released from France at 12:01 on the third Thursday of November. During the 2000s, the release rules started to relax, with the wines shipped ahead of time and released to local markets at 12:01 a.m. local time. Beginning in the 2010s, it started to be sent to retailers ahead of the third Thursday, with instruction not to sell it until the third Thursday.

Some members of the UIVB saw the potential for marketing Beaujolais nouveau by capitalizing on the fast distribution of the vintage, starting with a race to get the first bottles to Paris. In the 1960s, races from English clubs rewarded the drivers who returned the quickest with the most wine (sometimes resulting in spare tyres being left in Beaujolais). There continued to be more media coverage, and by the 1970s it had become a national event. The races spread to neighbouring European countries in the 1980s, followed by North America, and in the 1990s to Asia.

Until 1972, New York was the only US city to import Beaujolais nouveau. That year, Minneapolis became the second US city to import it; now, it is available in most US metropolis areas and many large cities across the globe.

== Production ==

Beaujolais Nouveau is made from the Gamay noir à Jus blanc grape, better known simply as Gamay. The grapes come from the southern part of the Beaujolais AOC, grown in &quot;stony, schistous soils&quot; just north of Lyon. Both Beaujolais Nouveau and Beaujolais-Villages Nouveau are produced; the latter comes from the ~ 30 non-cru villages in the northern part of the region, and grapes from the ten Beaujolais &quot;cru&quot; villages / appellations are excluded. Nouveau&#x27;s production has varied from 25% to almost 50% of the overall output in Beaujolais. As of 2017, 2000 producers are making 27.5 million cases from 4,000 vineyards, with 40% exported from France. There had been a trend away from Beaujolais-Village Nouveau; there is some indication that these wines are returning.

By law, all grapes in the region must be harvested by hand. The wine is made using carbonic maceration, whole berry anaerobic fermentation, which emphasizes fruit flavors without extracting bitter tannins from the grape skins. Grapes are loaded and sealed into a large (on the order of ) sealed container that is filled with carbon dioxide. Grapes gently crushed at the bottom of the container by the weight of the grapes start to ferment, emitting more CO2. All this carbon dioxide causes fermentation inside the uncrushed grapes (without access to oxygen, hence &quot;anaerobic fermentation&quot;). The resulting wine is fresh, fruity, and very low in tannins.

Part of the success of Beaujolais Nouveau is due to the Gamay grape – it can easily make this very straightforward wine and make more complex wines. Most other red wine grapes would not easily make nouveau-style wines.&quot;

The wine is marketed to be drunk in November, only a few months after the grapes were on the vines – logistics to ship so much wine quickly are a significant challenge. Means of transport have included elephant, Concorde, balloon, rickshaw, helicopter, private jet, military jet, and Boeing 747. Multiple air shipping companies even have online articles about how they arrange the nouveau air shipments, and the announcement of when the nouveau may be released from the EU is an annual headline.

== Celebration ==

This &quot;Beaujolais Day&quot; is accompanied by publicity events and heavy advertising. The traditional slogan, even in English-speaking countries, was &quot;Le Beaujolais nouveau est arrivé!&quot; (literally, &quot;The new Beaujolais has arrived!&quot;), but in 2005, this was changed to &quot;It&#x27;s Beaujolais Nouveau Time!&quot;. In the United States, it is promoted as a drink for Thanksgiving, which always falls exactly one week after the wine is released (on the fourth Thursday of November).

In the United Kingdom, Beaujolais Day is particularly popular in Swansea, Wales, where people book tables in restaurants and bars for the day up to a year in advance. Historian Peter Stead argues that its rise in popularity there can be traced to the city&#x27;s No Sign Bar in the 1960s, which was then owned by former Wales rugby union captain Clem Thomas, who owned a house in Burgundy and could transport Beaujolais quickly and cheaply to south Wales, and suggests that it reflected Swansea&#x27;s efforts to &quot;gentrify and intellectualise itself&quot; at the time. In 2015, it was estimated that Beaujolais Day contributed £5 million to the local economy.

More recently, several bars across Swansea have launched special events to mark Beaujolais Day, including the city&#x27;s number one rated hotel on TripAdvisor, Morgans Hotel, which sees more than 1,000 people through its doors each year for its locally renowned annual Beaujolais Day event.

As of 2014, over 100 Beaujolais Nouveau-related festivals were held in the Beaujolais region. One such festival, Les Sarmentelles, was held in Beaujeu, the region&#x27;s capital, and lasted for days. The winner of the annual tasting contest won their weight in wine.

Many producers release the nouveau with a colourful or abstract design that changes yearly, usually as an evolution from the previous year&#x27;s design. Starting in 2017, one producer had a contest for their Beaujolais Nouveau label; in 2020, there were over 1,000 entries. Duboeuf has silk ties made each year with their label&#x27;s abstract design, and releases them through select wholesalers and distributors.

In addition to the drinking of the Beaujolais Nouveau, its release represents an opportunity for chefs to cook with the wine. Due to its very young age and fermentation method, the foods prepared with nouveau tend to be a bit more purple than red. This is especially evident in &quot;coq au vin&quot; and poached pears, traditional dishes from Burgundy.

== Style ==
Beaujolais nouveau is a purple-pink wine reflecting its youth, bottled only 6–8 weeks after harvest. The method of production means that there is a higher acidity and very little tannin. Nouveau will have very bright, fresh, red fruit flavors, such as cherry, strawberry, and raspberry, along with fruity ester flavours of banana, grape, fig, and pear drop. The wine is recommended to be slightly chilled to 13 °C (55 °F). Beaujolais-Villages Nouveau tends to be a bit more purple, richer, and have more intense fruity flavors. 

Beaujolais nouveau is intended for immediate drinking. It has been described as &quot;wine of this vintage, fresh as the memory of harvest and raw as the experience of the year, unpolished by time, a reflection of the emotion of the moment&quot;. In this same spirit, nouveau is intended to be consumed within a few months. While nouveau could be kept for a few years, there is no real reason to, as it does not improve with age (for comparison, standard Beaujolais AOC wines are released the following year and can be stored for one or more years before consuming). The nouveau wines show definite variation between vintages and, as such, are considered to be an early indicator of the quality of the year&#x27;s regional wine harvest. Similar to non-nouveau wines, Beaujolais-Village Nouveau wines tend to be a bit richer and more flavorful. 

For a period around the late 1990s, some wine critics criticized Beaujolais nouveau as simple or immature. For example, wine critic Karen MacNeil wrote that &quot;Drinking it gives you the same kind of silly pleasure as eating cookie dough.&quot; Another wine critic, Robert M. Parker, Jr., disagreed, calling those opinions &quot;ludicrous&quot; and describing the better vintages as &quot;delicious, zesty, exuberant, fresh, vibrantly fruity&quot; wines. According to Julien Gobert, an oenologist who worked in the Bordeaux region, &quot;It is a proper wine and it&#x27;s not actually that easy to produce. It&#x27;s quite a challenge getting it right.&quot;

== Similar wines ==
The commercial success of Beaujolais nouveau led to the development of other &quot;&quot;primeur&quot; wines in other parts of France, such as the Gaillac AOC near Toulouse. These wines are typically released on the third Thursday of November, just like their counterparts in Beaujolais. The practice has spread to other wine-producing countries such as Italy (&quot;Vino Novello&quot;), Spain (&quot;vino joven&quot;), the Czech Republic (&quot;Svatomartinské víno&quot;) and the US (&quot;nouveau wine&quot;&quot;).

In the United States, several vintners have produced Nouveau-style wines, using various grapes such as Gamay, Zinfandel, Tempranillo, Pinot noir, and even Riesling. There is also a movement in the US of making nouveau wines in homage to the French Glou Glou wine movement and in homage to Beaujolais nouveau. In Japan, B&amp;H Lifes created a Nouveau wine for cats inspired by Beaujolais nouveau, which is popular in Japan. It is named Nyan Nyan Nouveau, or Meow Nouveau.

<text>Hugh Kingsmill Lunn (21 November 1889 – 15 May 1949), who dropped his surname for professional purposes, was a versatile British writer and journalist. The writers Arnold Lunn and Brian Lunn were his brothers.

==Life==
Hugh Kingsmill Lunn was born at Torrington Square, Bloomsbury, London, second son and second child of the three sons and one daughter of Sir Henry Simpson Lunn, founder of the travel agency Lunn Poly, and Mary Ethel, née Moore, daughter of a canon. He was educated at Harrow School and the University of Oxford. After graduating he worked for a brief period for Frank Harris, who edited the publication &quot;Hearth and Home&quot; in 1911/2, alongside Enid Bagnold; Kingsmill later wrote a debunking biography of Harris. He began fighting in the British Army in World War I in 1916, and was captured in France the next year. He was held as a prisoner of war at Mainz Citadel with, among others, J. Milton Hayes and Alec Waugh.

After the war he began to write, initially both science fiction and crime fiction. In the 1930s he was a contributor to the &quot;English Review&quot;; later he wrote a good deal of non-fiction for that periodical&#x27;s successor, the &quot;English Review Magazine&quot;. His large output includes criticism, essays and biographies, parodies and humour, as well as novels, and he edited a number of anthologies. He is remembered for saying &#x27;friends are God&#x27;s apology for relations&#x27;, with a notable flavour of Ambrose Bierce. The dictum was subsequently used by Richard Ingrams for the title of his memoir of Kingsmill&#x27;s friendships with Hesketh Pearson and Malcolm Muggeridge, two intimate friends whom he influenced greatly.

Kingmill was literary editor of &quot;Punch&quot; from 1942 to 1944 and of the &quot;New English Review&quot; from 1945 to 1949. He married Eileen FitzGerald in 1915 and there was one daughter. The marriage broke up in 1927. Kingsmill married a second time in 1934 to Dorothy Vernon, and there were two daughters and a son. (She also had one son of her own). He died of cancer in Brighton in 1949.

==Satire==
Muggeridge drew a darker attitude from Kingsmill&#x27;s sardonic wit. &quot;Dawnist&quot; was Kingsmill&#x27;s word for those infected with unrealistic or utopian idealism – the enemy as far as he was concerned.

Kingsmill&#x27;s parody of A. E. Housman&#x27;s poetry has been recognised as definitive:

What still alive at twenty-two,&lt;br&gt;
A clean, upstanding chap like you?&lt;br&gt;
Sure, if your throat &#x27;tis hard to slit,&lt;br&gt;
Slit your girl&#x27;s, and swing for it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Like enough, you won&#x27;t be glad,&lt;br&gt;
When they come to hang you, lad:&lt;br&gt;
But bacon&#x27;s not the only thing&lt;br&gt;
That&#x27;s cured by hanging from a string.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
So, when the spilt ink of the night&lt;br&gt;
Spreads o&#x27;er the blotting-pad of light,&lt;br&gt;
Lads whose job is still to do&lt;br&gt;
Shall whet their knives, and think of you.

Housman himself said of this parody: &quot;It&#x27;s the best I have seen, and indeed, the only good one.&quot;

==Anthologist==
Despite his wide range as a novelist, biographer, essayist, and literary critic, Kingsmill is best known today as an anthologist. He compiled at least eight of his humorous and original anthologies (depending on how they are classified) between 1929 and 1955. The first, &quot;An Anthology of Invective and Abuse&quot;, was by far the most successful and remains the best known. Oswald Mosley was so enthusiastic about it that he forwarded a copy to Adolf Hitler. According to Hesketh Pearson in his preface to &quot;High Hill of the Muses&quot; (the last of the anthologies) &quot;Kingsmill himself became a little restless when people praised his volume of vituperation.&quot; 

Michael Holroyd judges &quot;The Worst of Love&quot; (1931), a collection of insincere writing, to be the funniest. It resembles the better known anthology &quot;The Stuffed Owl&quot;, compiled by D. B. Wyndham Lewis and Charles Lee, which was published the year before. Owing to his wide reading and good memory, Kingsmill could put together an anthology inside a month, which helped him meet pressing financial commitments. Two other works, &quot;The English Genius&quot; (1938) and &quot;Johnson Without Boswell&quot; (1940), take on aspects of the anthology form but include more original content.

==Annotated list of works==
*&quot;The Will To Love&quot; (1919). Novel written under the name &quot;Hugh Lunn&quot;. The character Ralph Parker is based on Frank Harris and Barbara on Enid Bagnold.
*&quot;The Dawn&#x27;s Delay&quot; (1924). Includes three short novels: &#x27;W.J&#x27;, &#x27;The End of the World&#x27; and &#x27;The Disintegration of a Politician&#x27;. Published at his own expense.
*&quot;Blondel&quot; (1927). Novel, begun in 1925. Set in the period of Richard Coeur de Lion but not a historical novel: it&#x27;s based on a love affair Kingsmill had with an Irish cousin in his teens.
*&quot;Matthew Arnold&quot; (1928). Biography, written in an informal style (the subject referred to throughout as &quot;Matt&quot;). Contains &quot;a disproportionate degree of censure&quot;.
*&quot;After Puritanism, 1850-1900&quot; (1929). Four long essays on Dean Farrar, Samuel Butler, Frank Harris and W. T. Stead, linked by the idea that Puritanism did not fade away circa 1820 but remained alive during the Victorian era.
* &quot;An Anthology Of Invective And Abuse&quot; (1929). A collection of expressions of anger ranging from John Skelton to the war poet Geoffrey Howard (1889-1973). The most successful of his humorous and original anthologies.
*&quot;The Return of William Shakespeare&quot; (1929, revised 1948). Novel in which Shakespeare is brought back to life for six weeks in the year 1943, and is able to read what his critics have written about him and react. Creative literary criticism. 
*&quot;Behind Both Lines&quot; (1930). Autobiographical. Entertaining and light-hearted war memoirs.
*&quot;More Invective&quot; (1930). Anthology. A sequel to &quot;An Anthology of Invective and Abuse&quot;. A combined volume was published in 1944.
*&quot;The Worst of Love&quot; (1931). Anthology collecting &quot;numerous specimens of bad writing about love&quot;.
*&quot;Frank Harris&quot; (1932). Biography. Holroyd calls this &quot;most skilfully written and put together&quot;, but it has also been accused of being &quot;hostile&quot; and &quot;malicious&quot;.
*&quot;The Table of Truth&quot; (1933). Parodies originally published in &quot;The Bookman&quot; and &quot;The English Review.&quot; Includes P G Wodehouse and also the famous Housman parody (above).
*&quot;Samuel Johnson&quot; (1933). His best biography (Holroyd), although &quot;his love of Johnson sometimes softened the edge of his normally acute criticisms&quot;.
*&quot;The Sentimental Journey&quot; (1934) Biography of Charles Dickens. Irked by G K Chesterton&#x27;s portrayal of Dickens as a philanthropic and selfless social worker, Kingsmill&#x27;s portrait is one of extreme and unrelieved severity. George Orwell described it as &quot;the most brilliant ever written on Dickens&quot;, but &quot;so unremittingly &#x27;against&#x27; that it might give a misleading impression&quot;.
*&quot;The Casanova Fable: A Satirical Revaluation&quot; (1934) with William Gerhardi. Kingsmill wrote the first biographical section, this time arguing against Havelock Ellis&#x27;s picture of Casanova as &quot;a free spirit, a wit and bold thinker&quot;.
*&quot;What They Said at the Time&quot; (1935). Anthology.
*&quot;Parents and Children&quot; (1936). Anthology.
*&quot;Brave Old World&quot; (1936). Newspaper parodies, with Malcolm Muggeridge
*&quot;A Pre-View of Next Year&#x27;s News&quot; (1937). More newspaper parodies, with Malcolm Muggeridge
*&quot;Skye High: The Record of a Tour Through Scotland in the Wake of the Samuel Johnson And James Boswell&quot;.(1937). The first of three conversational travelogues written in collaboration with Hesketh Pearson
*&quot;Made on Earth&quot; (1937). Anthology on marriage.
*&quot;The English Genius: a survey of the English achievement and character&quot; (1938) As editor. New essays by W. R. Inge, Hilaire Belloc, Hesketh Pearson, William Gerhardi, E .S. P. Haynes, Douglas Woodruff, Charles Petrie, J. F. C. Fuller, Alfred Noyes, Rose Macaulay, Brian Lunn, Rebecca West, K. Hare, T. W. Earp.
*&quot;D. H. Lawrence&quot; (1938). Kingsmill was unsympathetic to Lawrence. The biography&#x27;s inadequacy &quot;lies in Kingsmill&#x27;s reluctance to linger for any length of time upon the positive nature and quality of Lawrence&#x27;s genius&quot;.
*&quot;Courage&quot; (1939). Anthology.
*&quot;Johnson Without Boswell: A Contemporary Portrait of Samuel Johnson&quot; (editor) (1940). Presents a picture of Johnson from several contemporary sources outside of Boswell.
*&quot;The Fall&quot; (1940). Generally regarded as Kingsnill&#x27;s most satisfactory novel, an account of marital incompatibility with some autobiographical elements. 
*&quot;This Blessed Plot&quot; (1942) travelogue with Hesketh Pearson. A record of travel and conversations in England and Ireland.
*&quot;The Poisoned Crown&quot; (1944) Essays on genealogies containing studies of Elizabeth, Cromwell, Napoleon and Lincoln, prefixed by a closely written chapter on The Genealogy of Hitler&#x27; (&quot;one of the most brilliant [chapters] that he ever wrote&quot; - Holroyd).
*&quot;Talking of Dick Whittington&quot; (1947) travelogue, with Hesketh Pearson. One review suggested that they had invented the conversation travel book as a new art form.
*&quot;The Progress of a Biographer&quot; (1949). Collection of literary criticism written since 1944.
*&quot;The High Hill of the Muses&quot; (1955). Last completed anthology, published posthumously.
*&quot;The Genius of Carlyle&quot;. Biography (unfinished). 
*&quot;The Best of Hugh Kingsmill: Selections from his Writings&quot; (1970) edited by Michael Holroyd.

<text>Lysander Cutler (February 16, 1807July 30, 1866) was an American businessman, educator, politician, and Wisconsin pioneer. He served as a Union Army officer through almost the entire American Civil War, notably commanding the famed Iron Brigade of the Army of the Potomac. He rose to the rank of brigadier ganeral and received an honorary brevet to major general. Earlier in his career, he was a member of the Maine Senate.

==Early years==
Cutler was born in Royalston, Massachusetts, the son of a farmer. Despite objections from his father, he desired a better education than the rudimentary courses he received in the local school, so he studied surveying and then began a career as a schoolmaster. Moving to Dexter, Maine, at the age of 21, he was forced to confront unruly pupils who had &quot;flogged and ejected&quot; the last several teachers who had attempted to discipline them. Cutler established his reputation by spending his first day in the &quot;thorough flogging of every bully in the school.&quot;

Although he received some military experience fighting Indians as a colonel in the Maine militia in the 1830s, the majority of his time before the Civil War was engaged in a variety of business pursuits. He started a woolen mill, a foundry, a flour mill, and a sawmill, becoming very wealthy in the process. Cutler invested in various factories and in tenement housing.

He was prominent in civic affairs as a selectman, director of a railroad, trustee of Tufts College, and a member of the Maine State Senate in 1841. Cutler&#x27;s woolen mill, built in 1843, burned to the ground in 1853, causing him to lose his entire investment. The financial panic of 1856 and depression of 1857 ruined him financially and he decided to leave Maine and moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to restart his career.

In Wisconsin, Cutler worked as a claims investigator for a mining company. He was required to make frequent trips into Indian territory, where he was often threatened with ambush and death. The mining company eventually failed, but a grain business that he founded in Milwaukee provided him with a living.

==Civil War service==

===1861–62===
In the first summer of the Civil War, Cutler, a respected 54-year-old businessman and Indian-fighter, was commissioned colonel of the 6th Wisconsin Infantry on July 16, 1861. This regiment would eventually become one of the units to comprise the famous Iron Brigade of the Army of the Potomac.

During the fall and winter, he got off to a bad start as a commander, alienating his junior officers by insisting that they pass examinations on military topics, and removing them from command if he was displeased with the results. Many men of the regiment were of recent immigrant status and he sometimes enraged the enlisted men of the company by replacing their officers with men of different national backgrounds, and sometimes speaking different languages. Despite these problems, Cutler was elevated to temporary brigade command in the I Corps of the Army of the Potomac on March 13, 1862.

Cutler&#x27;s men rejoiced when this temporary position was filled by Brig. Gen. John Gibbon that summer. The regiment&#x27;s first significant action was the Second Battle of Bull Run, where he demonstrated that he was a tenacious fighter. One soldier in his regiment said that he was &quot;rugged as a wolf.&quot; During the fighting against Stonewall Jackson at Brawner&#x27;s Farm, Cutler was severely wounded in the right thigh, causing him to miss the Maryland Campaign and the Battle of Antietam of September 1862.

When Gen. Gibbon was promoted to division command, he recommended that the recuperating Cutler be given command of the Iron Brigade, but Col. Solomon Meredith of the 19th Indiana had better political connections and received the appointment, dismaying Cutler. During the Battle of Fredericksburg in December, division commander Maj. Gen. Abner Doubleday placed Cutler in temporary command of the Iron Brigade for a few hours, dissatisfied with what he considered tardy execution of orders by Col. Meredith. After the battle, Cutler was promoted to brigadier general, to rank from November 29, 1862.

===1863===
In the spring of 1863, Cutler was given command of the 2nd Brigade, James S. Wadsworth&#x27;s 1st Division, I Corps, which he led at the Battle of Chancellorsville in May, but his unit was only lightly engaged. In the Battle of Gettysburg, they were heavily engaged north of the Chambersburg Pike, (76th New York, 147th New York, and 56th Pennsylvania) withstanding multiple Confederate assaults from the divisions of Maj. Gens. Henry Heth and Robert E. Rodes, coming in from the west and north, respectively.

The brigade itself had been split earlier by Maj. Gen. John Reynolds, with a demi-brigade (14th Brooklyn and 95th New York), under the command of Colonel Fowler of the 14th Brooklyn, to engage Brig. Gen. James Archer&#x27;s brigade south of the Chambersburg Pike. By the time the I Corps line broke around 4 p.m., his brigade had suffered over 50% casualties.

During the frantic retreat through the town of Gettysburg, Cutler had two horses shot out from under him. For the remainder of the three-day battle, Cutler&#x27;s brigade occupied defensive positions on Culp&#x27;s Hill and, taking advantage of the entrenchments there, suffered few additional casualties.

===1864–65===
The Army of the Potomac was reorganized in the spring of 1864 and Cutler was given command of the 1st Brigade, 4th Division, V Corps, on March 25. After Gen. Wadsworth was mortally wounded at the Battle of the Wilderness, Cutler assumed command of the 4th Division on May 6. He led the division through the rest of the Overland Campaign and into the Siege of Petersburg.

At the Battle of Globe Tavern on August 21, 1864, he was struck in the face and badly disfigured by a shell fragment and he was forced to leave field command. He spent the remainder of the war as an invalid, administering the draft in Jackson, Michigan. On December 12, 1864, President Abraham Lincoln nominated Cutler for appointment to the grade of brevet major general to rank from August 19, 1864, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the nomination on February 14, 1865.

==Postbellum life==
Cutler resigned from the Army on June 30, 1865, his health deteriorating rapidly. He died from a stroke, which doctors attributed to complications from his Globe Tavern wounds, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and is buried there in Forest Home Cemetery.

== Depictions in popular culture ==

* Cutler is portrayed by Robert Kaliban in Episode 1321 of the CBS Radio Mystery Theater aired April 28, 1982, &quot;The Ghost of Andersonville.&quot; The episode details a fictionalized relationship between Cutler and a former prisoner of the notorious Andersonville Prison, Cal Russell (played by Tony Roberts). Russell refuses to support Cutler&#x27;s bid for the presidency due to a deep-seated grudge over the general&#x27;s questionable orders during the war.

<doc id="1313221" wikidata="Q1342809" url="?curid=1313221" title="Giovanni Francesco Grimaldi">
<text>Giovanni Francesco Grimaldi (1606 – 28 November 1680) was an Italian painter, draughtsman, printmaker and architect. He was an accomplished fresco painter of classical landscapes which were popular with leading Roman families.

==Life==
Grimaldi was born in Bologna, and trained in the circle of the Carracci family. He was afterwards a pupil of Cardinal Francesco Albani. He went to Rome, and was appointed architect to Pope Paul V and also patronized by succeeding popes. Towards 1648 he was invited to France by Cardinal Mazarin, and for about two years was employed in buildings for that minister and for Louis XIV, and in fresco-painting in the Louvre.
His colour was strong, somewhat excessive in the use of green; his touch light. He painted history, portraits and landscapes, and executed engravings and etchings from his own landscapes and from those of Titian and the Caracci. Returning to Rome, he was made &quot;principe&quot; (director) of the Accademia di San Luca; and he died in Rome, having established a reputation for artistic skill and charitable actions.
His son Alessandro assisted him both in painting and in engraving. Paintings by Grimaldi are preserved in the Palazzo del Quirinale and in the Apostolic Palace, and in the church of San Martino ai Monti; there is also a series of his landscapes in the Palazzo Colonna. His mistress was Elena Aloisi, daughter of the painter Baldassare Aloisi.

Nadine Renee Shamir (February 9, 1972 – December 2, 2004) was an American singer and dance musician. In 1995 her single &quot;Say You&#x27;ll Stay&quot; was popular in the Miami and Los Angeles radio circuits. In 1996, Shamir worked with Miami DJ George Acosta under the moniker Planet Soul. Their single, &quot;Set U Free&quot; went to #26 on Billboard&#x27;s top 40 chart, crossed over to the R&amp;B charts, and went on to become an international hit.

==Early life and education==
Shamir was born in New York City. As an infant, she moved with her mother to Miami, Florida. Shamir traveled the world during her formative years and gained a deep passion for music. At 16, she released her first album on an independent label (she recorded under the name Nadine Renee).

==Music==
In 1988, Shamir released her debut album &quot;Say You&#x27;ll Stay&quot; under the stage name Nadine Renee. After high school, she released a second album called &quot;Let&#x27;s Make Love&quot;.

She toured Europe and in the late 1990s recorded an album for MCA, where she worked as a receptionist, which was shelved. The next album &quot;Nadine&quot; was released by MCA in 1999. The album&#x27;s first single was &quot;Next To Me&quot;. The album was reworked and released on Orchard in 2000 under the title &quot;Oasis of Love&quot;. She continued painting, writing screenplays, and making music, but began to focus on her personal life.

From the year 2000 on, she released her music on MP3.com (which was the most successful legal music platform at the time) and scored several No 1 hits.

In 2002, she worked with Bad Boy Bill on the track &#x27;Costa Del Sol&quot;. The track was remixed by multiple artists and became an international hit.

==Death==
In January 2003, she married Jon Shamir. On December 1, 2004, she gave birth to their first and only child, a daughter, Liat Nadine Shamir, and died of complications the following day.

<text>Edward John Gregory , PPRBSA (19 April 185022 June 1909), was a British painter.

==Biography==
Gregory was born in Southampton on 19 April 1850. He was grandson of John Gregory, engineer-in-chief of the auxiliary engines in Sir John Franklin&#x27;s last Arctic expedition, and was eldest child (in a family of three sons and five daughters) of Edward Gregory, a ship&#x27;s engineer, and Mary Ann Taylor.

On leaving Dr. Cruikshank&#x27;s private school at fifteen he entered the drawing-office, in his native town, of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, in whose employ his father sailed. He had set his mind upon being a painter. Making the acquaintance at Southampton of Hubert von Herkomer RA, whose family had settled there, he started a life-class with him.

In 1869, Gregory went to London, and with Herkomer joined the South Kensington Art School. Subsequently, he studied for a short time at the Royal Academy Schools. He was soon employed in the decorations of the Victoria and Albert Museum, and in 1871, with his friends Herkomer and Robert Walker Macbeth, began working for &quot;The Graphic,&quot; which had just been started by William Luson Thomas. Gregory at first contributed sketches from the theatre, but soon freely transcribed sketches sent home from the French army at the front by Mr. Sydney P. Hall. 
In 1876 he married Mary Joyner, who survived him without issue. From 1909 until his death, Gregory was president of the Royal Birmingham Society of Artists. He died at his residence, Brampton House, Great Marlow, on 22 June 1909, and was buried in Great Marlow churchyard.

Gregory&#x27;s illustrations, which were sometimes signed by both himself and Hall, revealed the variety and ingenuity of his draughtsmanship. 
He ceased to work regularly for the &quot;Graphic&quot; about 1875.

Gregory was not a frequent exhibitor at Burlington House. 
He first made his mark as a painter with the oil painting &quot;Dawn&quot; (now in the possession of John Singer Sargent, R.A.), originally shown at Deschamps&#x27; gallery in 1879. 
Much of his best work appeared at the exhibitions of the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours, of which he was elected associate in 1871 and member in 1876. 
He succeeded Sir James Linton as president in 1898. 
From 1875 to 1882, his contributions to the Academy were mainly portraits, including that of Duncan McLaren MP, a replica of which is in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery. During his trip to Italy in 1882 he visited Capri and painted a beautiful picture of the Gardens of Augustus and Mount Solaro. As early as 1883, he was elected with Macbeth to the associateship, and he became academician in 1898, after the completion and exhibition of his &quot;Boulter&#x27;s Lock: Sunday Afternoon,&quot; a work which hardly justified the years of elaboration spent upon it.

<text>Count Jan Wielopolski (c. 1630-1688) was a Polish nobleman, aristocrat, politician and diplomat. Between May 1678 and January 1680, he was also a Polish chancellor.

==Biography==
Son of castellan and voivode Jan Wielopolski and Zofia Kochanowska. He was married to Aniela Febronia Koniecpolska and Konstancja Krystyna Komorowska since 1665. His third wife Marie Anne de la Grande d&#x27;Arquien, the sister of Queen Marie Casimire Louise he married in July 1678 in Lwów.

He was Stolnik of the Crown since 1664, General governor of Kraków since 1667, Deputy Chancellor the Crown since 1677 and Grand Chancellor of the Crown since 1678.

Wielopolski was the governor of Biecz, Bochnia, Nowy Targ and Dolina.

Educated in Kraków and Strasbourg. Since 1661 frequent deputy to the Sejm from Little Poland province.

He supported King John II Casimir of Poland who wanted to institute an &quot;election vivente rege&quot;, where the king&#x27;s successor was elected before the old king died. This would allow for the king to have input in the election, giving him more power.

Wielopolski was Marshal of the extraordinary Sejm in Warsaw on 20 February - 1 May 1662.

At the end of his life he was in opposition to King John III Sobieski.

He was deft in extending the wealth and power of the family. His marriage with Konstancja Krystyna Komorowska caused (in the next generation) in overtaking of large properties by the Wielkopolski family in 1729.

<doc id="1313249" wikidata="Q1268226" url="?curid=1313249" title="Long-billed murrelet">
<text>The long-billed murrelet (Brachyramphus perdix) is a small seabird from the North Pacific. The genus name &quot;Brachyramphus&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;brakhus&quot;, &quot;short&quot;, and &quot;rhamphos&quot;, &quot;bill&quot;. The species name &quot;perdix&quot; is Latin for &quot;partridge&quot; Pallas described this auk as &quot;Magnitudine Perdicis&quot;. &quot;Murrelet&quot; is a diminutive of &quot;murre&quot;, a word of uncertain origins, but which may imitate the call of the common guillemot.

This auk is an unusual member of the auk family, often nesting far inland in old growth forests. The long-billed murrelet, like its cousins the marbled and Kittlitz&#x27;s murrelets, is thought to have experienced a decline in numbers recently.

It closely resembles the marbled murrelet, of which it was considered a subspecies until 1998, when Friesen &quot;et al.&quot; showed that the mtDNA variation was greater between these two forms than between marbled and Kittlitz&#x27;s murrelets.

This species is found from Kamchatka to the Sea of Okhotsk. Most birds winter in the seas around northern Japan with some reaching South Korea and southern Japan. The Marbled Murrelet, in contrast tends to remain closer to its breeding grounds.

==Description==
The long-billed murrelet is a small (25 cm long), chunky auk with a slender black bill. It has pointed wings and plumage that varies by season. The non-breeding appearance is typically white underneath with a black crown, nape, wings and back. The breeding plumage is mainly brown, with pale feather edges giving a scaly appearance; the central underparts, normally below the surface on a swimming bird, are white.

The long-billed murrelet is longer billed, slightly larger, and 20% heavier than the marbled murrelet, and has a white eye ring. In breeding plumage it shows a pale throat which is absent in marbled murrelet, and weaker scaling because of fewer rusty and buff markings. In winter, the long-billed murrelet lacks the white collar of the marbled.

Measurements:

* Length: 25 cm    
* Weight: 310 g 
* Wingspan: 43 cm 

==Behaviour and breeding==
The long-billed murrelet feeds at sea principally on small fish, both in pelagic offshore areas (often associating with upwellings), and inshore in protected bays. It tends to migrate more than its closest relative the marbled murrelet.

The breeding behaviour of the long-billed murrelet is very unusual. Unlike most other seabirds, it does not breed in colonies or even necessarily close to the sea, instead nesting in on branches of old-growth conifers. It lays one egg on a thick lichen- or moss-covered branch or hollow. The egg is incubated for a month, then the chick is fed for around 40 days until it fledges and flies unaccompanied to the sea.

==Conservation==
The long-billed murrelet is considered globally threatened, having declined across its range over the last few decades. The biggest threat to the murrelet is the loss of the old growth forest to logging. Other losses can occur through entanglement in fishing gear. The bird could be threatened by the oil development of the Okhotsk and Bering Sea shelves.

==Vagrancy==
The species is unusually prone to vagrancy, with records in both North America and Europe, often at inland sites well away from its usual ocean habitat.

There are about 40 records from North America (Mlodinow 1997), half of them on the Pacific coast where they might be expected, but the rest scattered across the continent east to Florida, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Massachusetts, North Carolina, South Carolina and Newfoundland, as well as on lakes and rivers several hundred kilometers from the sea, in Colorado (two), Indiana (three), Montana, Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Wyoming (two), and Kansas (two).

The first found in Europe was a first-winter individual discovered drowned in a fishing net at Zollikon, Lake Zurich, Switzerland on a date between 15 and 18 December 1997. The specimen has been deposited at the Naturhistorisches Museum Basel (Maumary and Knaus 2000).

Europe&#x27;s second was found at Dawlish Warren, Devon, England on 7 November 2006; initially identified as a little auk. It was re-found offshore from Dawlish town centre on 11 November, and attracted large crowds of birdwatchers. The bird was present until 14 November, with an estimated 1000+ birders travelled from as far afield as Edinburgh and (reportedly) the Netherlands to see it.

The third Western Palearctic record followed quickly with a bird on a reservoir in Romania, on the Olt River near Alsoporumbak from 21–23 December 2006.

<text>Thomas Christopher Parnell (; born February 5, 1967) is an American actor and comedian. First breaking through as a performer with the Los Angeles comedy troupe The Groundlings, Parnell found wider success during his tenure as a cast member on the NBC sketch comedy series &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; from 1998 to 2006. After leaving &quot;SNL&quot;, he played the role of Dr. Leo Spaceman on the NBC sitcom &quot;30 Rock&quot; (2006–2013). Parnell is also a prominent voice actor known for his deep and distinctive voice. In animation, he voices the narrator on the PBS Kids series &quot;WordGirl&quot; (2007–2015), Cyril Figgis on the FX series &quot;Archer&quot; (2009–2023), Jerry Smith on Adult Swim&#x27;s &quot;Rick and Morty&quot; (2013–present), and Doug on Fox&#x27;s &quot;Family Guy&quot; (2019–2022). His work also extends into commercials, having voiced the Hamburger Helper mascot “Lefty”, appeared in advertisements as “America’s Dad” for Orbit Gum, and is most known for voicing &quot;The Progressive Box&quot; in a series of advertisements by the Progressive Corporation.

==Early life==
Parnell was born in Memphis, Tennessee, and adopted by a Southern Baptist family. His father, Jack Parnell, was a radio personality in Memphis. He attended the Southern Baptist Educational Center, and graduated from Germantown High School. He decided to pursue acting as a career at age 17 and set his sights on being a theater actor. He attended the University of North Carolina School of the Arts where he received his BFA in Drama. He moved to Houston, Texas after college to do an apprentice actor program for a season at the Alley Theatre, but did not get asked back to join the company. He became temporarily disenchanted with acting, and returned to his hometown and taught acting, film, and video at his alma mater, Germantown High School, for a year. In 1992, he moved to Los Angeles where he worked at FAO Schwarz for five years and took classes at the Groundlings.

==Career==
While performing as a company player with the Groundlings for a number of years, Parnell began doing commercials and getting guest roles on various sitcoms, such as &quot;Seinfeld&quot; and &quot;Murphy Brown&quot;. He was hired to join the cast of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; as a featured player, and debuted on the show on September 26, 1998. He was promoted to repertory player the following season. In the summer of 2001, because of budget cuts and the hiring of four new cast members, Lorne Michaels was required to dismiss two cast members; he chose to lay off Parnell and Jerry Minor over Horatio Sanz, Rachel Dratch, and Maya Rudolph. Parnell was rehired in the middle of the following season.

While on &quot;SNL&quot;, Chris appeared in numerous sketches and commercial parodies, and performed impressions of various celebrities. Among his notable sketches are &quot;Lazy Sunday&quot;, a rap video he shot with Andy Samberg, and &quot;More Cowbell&quot;. He has performed raps about hosts Jennifer Garner, Britney Spears, Kirsten Dunst, and Ashton Kutcher. On the DVD commentary for the West Coast version of the &quot;30 Rock&quot; episode &quot;Live Show&quot;, Tina Fey and Beth McCarthy Miller noted that Parnell was nicknamed &quot;The Ice Man&quot; while working at &quot;SNL&quot;, because of his apparent immunity to breaking character, citing the &quot;More Cowbell&quot; sketch in which he was the only actor not to break.
In 2006, Michaels laid off Parnell, as well as Horatio Sanz and Finesse Mitchell, due to budget cuts. This effectively made Parnell the only &quot;SNL&quot; performer to have been released twice by Michaels, although Parnell said in a 2008 interview with &quot;The Sound of Young America&quot; that he was okay with being let go this time, as he was considering leaving after that season anyway, adding that he probably would have stayed one more season had he been asked back. He had been with &quot;SNL&quot; for eight seasons; at the time only four people (Darrell Hammond, Tim Meadows, Kevin Nealon, and Al Franken) had been cast members longer. He has since made uncredited cameo appearances on the show, including parodying newscasters Tom Brokaw, Jim Lehrer, and Bob Schieffer. Parnell and his former &quot;SNL&quot; castmate Horatio Sanz starred together in &quot;Big Lake&quot;, a 2010 sitcom on Comedy Central from executive producers Will Ferrell and Adam McKay.

Parnell voiced Fly in the animated films &quot;Hotel Transylvania&quot; and &quot;Hotel Transylvania 2&quot;, and Stan the Fishman in &quot;Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation&quot;. He is a series regular on the FX animated series &quot;Archer&quot;, and is also known for his guest appearances as Dr. Leo Spaceman on &quot;30 Rock&quot;. He provides the voice of the narrator on the PBS children&#x27;s series &quot;WordGirl&quot;. From 2011 to 2014, Parnell co-starred on the ABC comedy series &quot;Suburgatory&quot; where he played the husband of the character played by his former &quot;SNL&quot; castmate Ana Gasteyer. His role started out as recurring in the first season but he was bumped up to a series regular in the second season. The series aired for three seasons on ABC.

Parnell provides the voice of the &quot;Progressive Box&quot; in commercials for Progressive Insurance. Since 2013, Parnell has voiced Jerry Smith (and his alternate reality variants) on the Adult Swim series &quot;Rick and Morty&quot;. On March 16, 2018, Parnell was cast in the main role of Wayne on the CBS sitcom &quot;Happy Together&quot;.

<text>The 1950 United States Senate elections occurred in the middle of Harry S. Truman&#x27;s second term as president. The 32 seats of Class 3 were contested in regular elections, and four special elections were held to fill vacancies. As with most 20th-century second-term midterms, the party not holding the presidency made significant gains. The Republican opposition made a net gain of five seats, taking advantage of the Democratic administration&#x27;s declining popularity during the Cold War and the aftermath of the Recession of 1949. The Democrats held a narrow 49-to-47-seat majority after the election. This was the first time since 1932 that the Senate majority leader lost his seat, and the only instance of the majority leader losing his seat while his party retained the majority.

Democratic incumbent Senator Claude Pepper lost renomination May 2, 1950 to George A. Smathers, who easily won the general election.

The Democratic primary for the 1950 United States Senate election in Florida was described as the &quot;most bitter and ugly campaigns in Florida political history.&quot; Ormund Powers, a Central Florida historian, noted that ABC and NBC commentator David Brinkley said that &quot;the Pepper-Smathers campaign would always stand out in his mind as the dirtiest in the history of American politics&quot;. On January 12, 1950, U.S. Representative George A. Smathers declared his candidacy for the race in Orlando at Kemp&#x27;s Coliseum, where about 3,000 supporters had gathered. In his opening speech, Smathers accused Pepper of being &quot;the leader of the radicals and extremists&quot;, an advocate of treason, and a person against the constitutional rights of Americans. Ed Ball, a power in state politics who had broken with Pepper, financed his opponent, Smathers.

Prior to the entry of Smathers and Pepper, Orlando attorney James G. Horrell campaigned for the seat. Horrell researched Pepper&#x27;s weaknesses and the state&#x27;s voters. Horrell also compiled a list of communist-front groups that Pepper had communicated with. On the day that Pepper declared his candidacy, Horrell withdrew and endorsed Smathers. Horrell also sent his reports about Pepper to Smathers, which he used throughout the next few months. This would also prevent the chance of a run-off election. In late February and early March, the &quot;Jacksonville Journal&quot; conducted a poll in 11 counties important for the election. Smathers led by about 2-to-1 and dominated in Duval, Pinellas, and Volusia counties, while he was also statistically tied with Pepper in Dade, Escambia, and Hillsborough counties. However, Smathers did not trail in any of the 11 counties.

Smathers repeatedly attacked &quot;Red Pepper&quot; for having communist sympathies, condemning both his support for universal health care and his alleged support for the Soviet Union. Pepper had traveled to the Soviet Union in 1945 and, after meeting Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, declared he was &quot;a man Americans could trust.&quot; Additionally, although Pepper supported universal health care, sometimes referred to as &quot;socialized medicine&quot;, Smathers would vote for &quot;socialized medicine&quot; in the Senate when it was introduced as Medicare in 1965. In &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;, even respected writer and notorious anti-segregation editor Ralph McGill labeled Pepper a &quot;spell-binding pinko&quot;. Beginning on March 28 and until the day of the primary, Smathers named one communist organization each day that Pepper addressed, starting with the American Slav Congress.

Pepper&#x27;s opponents circulated widely a 49-page booklet titled &quot;The Red Record of Senator Claude Pepper&quot;. It contained photographs and headlines from several communist publications such as the &quot;Daily Worker&quot;. In April the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; endorsed Pepper, with Communist Party of Florida leader George Nelson warning that a Smathers victory would &quot;strengthen the Dixiecrat-KKK forces in Florida as well as throughout the South.&quot; The booklet also made it seem as if Pepper desired to give Russia nuclear bomb-making instructions, billions of dollars, and the United States&#x27; natural resources. There was also a double-page montage of Pepper in 1946 at New York City&#x27;s Madison Square Garden with progressive Henry A. Wallace and civil rights activist Paul Robeson, and quoted Pepper speaking favorably of both of them. Throughout the campaign, Pepper denied sympathizing with communism.

Simultaneous to this election, then-U.S. House Representative Richard Nixon was running for the Senate seat in California. In a letter from Senator Karl E. Mundt of South Dakota, he told Nixon that &quot;It occurs to me that if Helen is your opponent in the fall, something of a similar nature might well be produced&quot;, in reference to &quot;The Red Record of Senator Claude Pepper&quot; and a similar Democratic primary between Manchester Boddy and Helen Gahagan Douglas.

Race also played a role in the election. Labor unions began a voter registration drive, which mostly added African Americans to the voter rolls. Smathers accused the &quot;Northern labor bosses&quot; of paying black people to register and vote for Pepper. Shortly after Smathers declared his candidacy, he indicated to the Florida Peace Officers Association that he would defend law enforcement officers for free if they were found guilty of civil rights violations. With the election occurring during the era of racial segregation, Pepper was portrayed as favoring integration and interracial marriage. He was also labeled a &quot;nigger lover&quot; and accused by &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; publisher Martin Andersen of shaking hands with a black woman in Sanford. In Dade County, which had a significant black and Jewish population, doctored photographs depicting Smathers in a Ku Klux Klan hood were distributed.

In the Groveland Case, four young African American men – Charles Greenlee, Walter Irvin, Samuel Shepherd, and Ernest Thomas – known as the Groveland Four, were accused of raping a 17-year old white women in Groveland on July 16, 1949. Thomas fled the area but was later shot and killed by police. Greenlee, Irvin, and Shepherd were convicted by an all-white jury. After the &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot; questioned the verdict in April 1950, Lake County State Attorney J. W. Hunter, a supporter of Pepper, demanded that Pepper repudiate the news articles. However, Pepper refused. Hunter then denounced Pepper and endorsed Smathers. In addition to the racial violence, cross burning was also common at the time, with five in Jacksonville, ten in Orlando and Winter Park, and seventeen in the Tallahassee area.

With the accusation of &quot;Northern labor bosses&quot; sending &quot;the carpetbaggers of 1950&quot; to Florida on his behalf, Pepper reminded voters that Smathers was born in New Jersey and sometimes referred to him as a &quot;damn Yankee intruder&quot;. In response, Smathers decorated speaking platform in the colors of his alma mater at the University of Florida, orange and blue, while informing his supporters that Pepper graduated from Harvard Law School.

Powers noted that throughout the campaign, &quot;scarcely a day passed&quot; without Andersen writing a news story, column, or editorial that was very positive of Smathers or highly critical of Pepper. Thirty-eight daily newspapers in Florida endorsed Smathers, while only the &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot; and &quot;The Daytona Beach News-Journal&quot; endorsed Pepper. Among the newspapers that supported Smathers were the &quot;Miami Herald&quot;, owned by John S. Knight, and the &quot;Miami Daily News&quot;, published by James M. Cox, a former Governor of Ohio and the Democratic Party nominee for the 1920 presidential election. However, Pepper&#x27;s aides compared this situation to when Alf Landon was endorsed by more editors and newspapers than Franklin Roosevelt in 1936, but received far fewer votes than him.

Smathers performed generally well across many areas of the state, with the exception of Miami, Tampa, and the Florida Panhandle. On the morning after the election, Andersen wrote on the front-page headline of the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot;, &quot;Praise God From Whom All Blessings Flow ... We Have Won from Hell to Breakfast And From Dan to Beersheba ... And Staved Off Socialism&quot;, which was inspired by a headline in &quot;The New York Times&quot; celebrating Lawrence of Arabia&#x27;s victory over the Turks in 1917.



Smathers defeated Republican John P. Booth in a landslide in the general election on November 7. Results indicated that Smathers received 76.3% of the vote compared to just 23.7% for Booth. In the popular vote, Smathers garnered 238,987 votes versus 74,228 for Booth. Smathers fared well throughout the state and won all but Pinellas County.

<text>333 Commerce Street (formerly the AT&amp;T Building, South Central Bell Building, and BellSouth Building, also colloquially known as the Batman Building) is a , 33-story skyscraper completed in September 1994 and located in Nashville, Tennessee. The structure is designed as an office tower capable of housing 2,000 workers. It is currently the tallest building in the state of Tennessee.

==Architecture and design==
The building sits on of property on Commerce St between 3rd and 4th Avenues North, and has a footprint of city blocks. It features a three-story winter garden atrium as its foyer and has a nine-story underground parking garage with 1,300 vehicle capacity. Its distinctive design and dark coloration have earned it the nickname &quot;Batman Building&quot;, due to its resemblance to the cowl of superhero character Batman. Others regard the building as the tower undergirding the Eye of Sauron from J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy.

Richard Miller, the president of architectural firm Earl Swensson Associates, said of the design process: &quot;...at the time we did that wanted a signature piece of architecture. What happens inside the building drives the way the outside looks.&quot;

In August 2009, the French online business journal &quot;Le Journal du Net&quot; named the iconic &quot;Batman Building&quot;, or as the article names it &quot;La tour de Batman&quot;, one of the 12 most original office buildings in the world.

In 2011, a drawing of 333 Commerce – alongside images of iconic structures from Tennessee&#x27;s three other large cities (the Memphis Pyramid, Knoxville&#x27;s Sunsphere, and the Tennessee Aquarium of Chattanooga) – was incorporated into the standard design of Tennessee&#x27;s state-issued driver&#x27;s licenses.

==Tenants==
AT&amp;T, previously BellSouth Telecommunications and before that South Central Bell, has operated its Tennessee headquarters out of the building since it was opened in 1994. Prior to 2006, it was the sole occupant of the building, and now occupies approximately of office space. AT&amp;T held a 23.5 year lease ending in January 2020, which was renewed for an undisclosed period of time in March 2019. Nissan North America operated a temporary headquarters in the remainder of office area, twelve floors, for two years before relocating to a permanent location in Franklin, Tennessee, in mid-2008. Other notable tenants that have held space include Hankook Tire America and U.S. Bank.

Local television station WTVF Channel 5, while not utilizing office space, operates two live remotely controlled video cameras mounted on the western spire, which were established in 1995 and 1996. These cameras are used to provide scenic views of Nashville and assist in covering news events.

==Ownership==
After completion in 1994, 333 Commerce was purchased by Prefco XIV L.P., a limited partnership of the Pitney Bowes Real Estate Financing Corp, for US$100.8 million. Ownership of the building was transferred to Cerberus Capital Management subsidiary EntreCap Financial in July 2006 after Cerberus acquired Prefco. The building was immediately placed back on the market for resell, and in mid-2007 was sold to MTL Leasing LLC for an undisclosed sum. The building is currently owned by real estate firm Cushman &amp; Wakefield.

<text>Mary of Egypt (; ; ; Amharic/Geez: ቅድስት ማርያም ግብፃዊት) was an Egyptian grazer saint dwelling in Palestine during Late antiquity or the Early Middle Ages. She is highly venerated as a Desert Mother in the Eastern Orthodox and Coptic Churches. The Catholic Church commemorates her as a patron saint of penitents.

She is exclusively known through the hagiographical account of her life, a narrative in Greek written by Sophronius of Jerusalem in the 7th century. 

==Life==

The primary source of information on Saint Mary of Egypt is the &quot;Vita&quot; written of her by Sophronius, Patriarch of Jerusalem (634–638). Most of the information in this section is taken from this source.

Mary of Egypt, also known as Maria Aegyptiaca, was born somewhere in the Province of Egypt, and at the age of twelve ran away from her parents to the city of Alexandria. There, she lived an extremely dissolute life. In her &quot;Vita&quot; it states that she often refused the money offered for her sexual favors, as she was driven &quot;by an insatiable and an irrepressible passion&quot;, and that she mainly lived by begging, supplemented by spinning flax.

After seventeen years of this lifestyle, she traveled to Jerusalem for the Great Feasts of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross. She undertook the journey as a sort of &quot;anti-pilgrimage&quot;, stating that she hoped to find in the pilgrim crowds at Jerusalem even more partners to sate her lust. She paid for her passage by offering sexual favors to other pilgrims, and she briefly continued her habitual lifestyle in Jerusalem. Her &quot;Vita&quot; relates that when she tried to enter the Church of the Holy Sepulchre for the celebrations, she was barred by an unseen force. Realizing this was because of her impurity, she was struck with remorse, and upon seeing an icon of the Theotokos (the Virgin Mary) outside the church, she prayed for forgiveness and promised to give up the world (i.e., become an ascetic). She attempted again to enter the church, and this time was able to go in. After venerating the relic of the True Cross, she returned to the icon to give thanks, and heard a voice telling her, &quot;If you cross the Jordan, you will find glorious rest.&quot; She immediately went to the monastery of Saint John the Baptist on the banks of the River Jordan, where she received absolution and afterwards Holy Communion. The next morning, she crossed the Jordan eastwards and retired to the desert to live the rest of her life as a hermit in penitence. She took with her only three loaves of bread she had bought, and once she had eaten these, lived only on what she could find in the wilderness.

Approximately one year before her death, she recounted her life to Zosimas of Palestine, who encountered her in the desert. When he unexpectedly met her in the desert, she was completely naked and almost unrecognizable as human. She asked Zosimas to toss her his mantle to cover herself with, and then she narrated her life&#x27;s story to him. She asked him to meet her at the banks of the Jordan on Holy Thursday of the following year, and to bring her Holy Communion. When he fulfilled her wish, she crossed the river to get to him by walking on the water, and received Holy Communion, telling him to meet her again in the desert the following Lent. 

The next year, Zosimas went to the same spot where he first met her, some twenty days&#x27; journey from his monastery. There, he found her lying dead; an inscription written in the sand next to her head stated that she had died the very night he had given her Communion, her incorrupt body miraculously transported to that spot. He buried her body with the assistance of a passing lion. On returning to his monastery, he related her life story to the other brethren, and it was preserved among them as oral tradition until it was written down by Sophronius.

==Date of death==
There is disagreement among various sources regarding the dates of Mary&#x27;s life. Some scholars doubt her existence, on the grounds of the similarity of her &quot;Vita&quot; to the stories of other &quot;desert mothers&quot;: &quot;[I]t is impossible to provide a chronology for the life of Mary, or even to establish her historicity.&quot; The dates given above correspond to those in the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;. The Bollandists place her death in 421, or 530 (see &quot;Prolog from Ohrid&quot;, 1 April). The only clue given in her &quot;Vita&quot; is the fact that the day of her repose was 1 April, which is stated to be Holy Thursday, meaning that Easter fell on 4 April that year.

==Veneration==

===Iconography===
In iconography, Mary of Egypt is depicted as a deeply tanned, emaciated old woman with unkempt gray hair, either naked and covered by her long hair or by the mantle she borrowed from Zosimas. She is often shown with the three loaves of bread she bought before her final journey into the desert.

===Commemoration===
Her feast day is kept by Orthodox Christians and Greek Catholics, according to the Fixed Cycle, on 1 April, and, according to the Moveable Cycle, on the fifth Sunday of Great Lent, on which day it is customary for the priest to bless dried fruit after the Divine Liturgy. The &quot;Life of St Mary&quot; by Sophronius is appointed to be read during the Matins of the Great Canon of Andrew of Crete on the preceding Thursday, which is accompanied with a canon to her and Andrew sung after each ode of the Great Canon itself.

The Coptic Orthodox Church commemorates Saint Mary of Egypt on Parmouti 6, which is 14 April in the Gregorian calendar.

In the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church, Saint Mary of Egypt is commemorated on 1 April according to the 2004 Roman Martyrology (Ordinary Form) and on 2 April in the 1956 Roman Martyrology (Extraordinary Form]. 

She is venerated by Anglicans and appears on the Episcopal Church liturgical calendar. 

In Italy, she became associated with the patronage of &quot;fallen women&quot; much like Mary Magdalene, to whom similar traits were associated.

===Churches===
There are a number of churches and chapels dedicated to Saint Mary of Egypt, among them:
*&quot;Temple of Portunus&quot; (Santa Maria Egiziaca, Rome)
*Church of Santa Maria Egiziaca a Forcella, Naples
*Church of Santa Maria Egiziaca a Pizzofalcone, Naples
*Chapel of St. Mary of Egypt, Wawel Castle, Kraków, Poland
*Chapel in Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, commemorating the site of her conversion.

===Relics===
First-class relics of Saint Mary of Egypt are enshrined at the following churches:
*Cattedrale di Santa Maria del Fiore, Florence Italy (skull)
*Church of Santa Maria Egiziaca a Forcella, Naples, Italy (a relic encased in a bust of the saint)
*Sens Cathedral, Sens, France (right foot)
*Church of Agios Dimitrios, Ampelokipi, Greece
*Sretensky Monastery, Moscow, Russia (a particle from the right foot) 
*Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, Moscow, Russia
*Novo-Tikhvin Monastery, Ekaterinburg, Russia
*Church of Saint Demetrios of Thessaloniki, Moscow, Russia (a particle of the right foot)
*Sacred Patriarchal and Stavropegial Orthodox Monastery of St. Irene Chrysovalantou, Astoria, Queens, New York
*Saint Nicholas Russian Orthodox Monastery, Fort Myers, Florida, USA (particle)

===Icon of the Mother of God===
Two icons of the Theotokos are claimed to be the very icon before which Mary of Egypt prayed for forgiveness. One is kept in the Chapel of Saint James the Just, located on the western parvis of the Church of Holy Sepulchre. The other icon is located in the Cave of Saint Athanasios the Athonite, on the southern tip of Mount Athos.

===Cave===
The cave where Mary of Egypt spent the rest her life following her conversion is a place of pilgrimage.
===Rosa Egipcíaca===
Rosa Egipcíaca, an Afro-Brazilian religious mystic and formerly enslaved prostitute, renamed herself in 1798 to honour Saint Mary of Egypt. Egipcíaca was the first black woman in Brazil to write a book, &quot;Sagrada Teologia do Amor Divino das Almas Peregrinas&quot; (&quot;Holy Theology of Divine Love of the Pilgrim Souls&quot;), that recorded her religious visions&quot;.&quot;

==Cultural references==

In Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust,&quot; Mary of Egypt is one of the three penitent saints who pray to the Virgin Mary for forgiveness for Faust. Her words are set by Mahler in his 8th Symphony, as the final saint&#x27;s appeal to the &quot;Mater Gloriosa&quot;.

In Ben Jonson&#x27;s play &quot;Volpone&quot; (1606) one of the characters uses the expression &quot;Marry Gip&quot;. Commentators have taken this to mean &quot;Mary of Egypt&quot;.

Mary of Egypt is the subject of operas by Ottorino Respighi (&quot;Maria egiziaca&quot;), John Craton (&quot;Saint Mary of Egypt&quot;), and Sir John Tavener (&quot;Mary of Egypt&quot;). The Tavener opera was written in 1992 for the Aldeburgh Festival.

&quot;The Unknown Masterpiece&quot; (1831), a novella by Balzac, contains a long description of a portrait of Mary of Egypt &quot;undressing in order to pay her passage to Jerusalem&quot;.

Nalo Hopkinson&#x27;s science fiction novel, &quot;The Salt Roads&quot;, also features Mary of Egypt and takes a historical fiction approach to telling her story.

In John Berryman&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize winning book of poetry, &quot;The Dream Songs&quot;, poem 47, subtitled &quot;April Fool&#x27;s Day, or, St. Mary of Egypt&quot;, recounts Mary of Egypt&#x27;s walk across the River Jordan.

&quot;Thrust back by hands of air from the sanctuary door&quot; is the first line of &quot;Maria Aegyptiaca&quot;, a poem by John Heath-Stubbs about the saint (&quot;Collected Poems&quot;, p. 289).

<text>Christian Dior SE (), commonly known as Dior, is a French multinational luxury goods company that is controlled and chaired by French businessman Bernard Arnault, who also heads LVMH. , Dior controlled around 42% of the shares and 57% of the voting rights of LVMH. In addition, the Arnault family held a further 7% of the shares and 8% of the voting rights of LVMH as of that date.

The original fashion house was founded by French designer Christian Dior in 1946 to make items. Clothing is now produced by Christian Dior Couture, which is a subsidiary of LVMH, whereas Christian Dior SE is a holding company that controls LVMH. Bernard Arnault&#x27;s daughter, Delphine Arnault, has been the CEO of Christian Dior Couture since February 2023. Bernard Arnault&#x27;s eldest son, Antoine Arnault, is the CEO of Christian Dior SE.

==History==

===Founding===
The House of Dior was established on 16 December 1946 at 30 Avenue Montaigne in Paris. However, the current Dior company celebrates 1947 as the opening year. Dior was financially backed by Marcel Boussac, a wealthy businessman. Boussac had originally invited Dior to design for Philippe et Gaston, but Dior refused, wishing to make a fresh start under his own name rather than reviving an old brand. The new couture house became part of &quot;a vertically integrated textile business&quot; already operated by Boussac. Its capital was at FFr 6 million and workforce at 80 employees. The company was really a vanity project for Boussac and was a &quot;majorly owned affiliate of Boussac Saint-Freres S.A. Nevertheless, Dior was allowed a then-unusual great part in his namesake label (legal leadership, a non-controlling stake in the firm, and one-third of pretax profits) despite Boussac&#x27;s reputation as a &quot;control freak&quot;. Dior&#x27;s creativity also negotiated him a good salary.&quot;

===&quot;New Look&quot; ===

On 12 February 1947, Christian Dior launched his first fashion collection for Spring–Summer 1947. The show of &quot;90 models of his first collection on six mannequins&quot; was presented in the salons of the company&#x27;s headquarters at 30 Avenue Montaigne. Originally, the two lines were named &quot;Corolle&quot; and &quot;Huit&quot;. However, the new collection went down in fashion history as the &quot;New Look&quot; after the editor-in-chief of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; Carmel Snow exclaimed, &quot;It&#x27;s such a new look!&quot; The New Look was a revolutionary era for women at the end of the 1940s. When the collection was presented, the editor-in-chief also showed appreciation by saying; &quot;It&#x27;s quite a revolution, dear Christian!&quot; The debut collection of Christian Dior is credited with having revived the fashion industry of France. Along with that, the New Look brought back the spirit of haute couture in France as it was considered glamorous and young-looking. &quot;We were witness to a revolution in fashion and to a revolution in showing fashion as well.&quot;
The silhouette was characterized by a small, nipped-in waist and a full skirt falling below mid-calf length, which emphasized the bust and hips, as epitomized by the &quot;Bar&quot; suit from the first collection. The Bar suit was a contribution from the head of Dior&#x27;s tailoring atelier, a young Pierre Cardin, who was employed by the house from 1947 to 1949. The collection overall showcased more stereotypically feminine designs in contrast to the popular fashions of wartime, with full skirts, tight waists, and soft shoulders. Dior retained some of the masculine aspects, as they continued to hold popularity through the early 1940s, but he also wanted to include more feminine style.

The &quot;New Look&quot; became extremely popular, its full-skirted silhouette influencing other fashion designers well into the 1950s, and Dior gained a number of prominent clients from Hollywood, the United States, and the European aristocracy. As a result, Paris, which had fallen from its position as the capital of the fashion world after World War II, regained its preeminence. The New Look was welcomed in western Europe as a refreshing antidote to the austerity of wartime and de-feminizing uniforms, and was embraced by stylish women such as Princess Margaret in the UK. According to Harold Koda, Dior credited Charles James with inspiring The New Look. Dior&#x27;s designs from the &quot;New Look&quot; did not only affect the designers in the 1950s, but also more recent designers in the 2000s, including Thom Browne, Miuccia Prada, and Vivienne Westwood. Dior&#x27;s evening dresses from that time are still referred to by many designers, and they have been seen in different wedding themed catwalks with multiple layers of fabric building up below the small waist (Jojo, 2011). Examples include Vivienne Westwood&#x27;s Ready-to-Wear Fall/Winter 2011 and Alexander McQueen&#x27;s Ready to Wear Fall/Winter 2011 (Jojo, 2011).

Not everyone was pleased with the New Look, however. Some considered the amount of material to be wasteful, especially after years of cloth rationing. Feminists in particular were outraged, feeling that these corseted designs were restrictive and regressive, and that they took away a woman&#x27;s independence. There were several protest groups against the designs including, the League of Broke Husbands, made up of 30,000 men who were against the costs associated with the amount of fabric needed for such designs. Fellow designer Coco Chanel remarked, &quot;Only a man who never was intimate with a woman could design something that uncomfortable.&quot; Despite such protests, the New Look was highly influential, continuing to inform the work of other designers and fashion well into the 21st century. For the 60th anniversary of the New Look in 2007, John Galliano revisited it for his Spring-Summer collection for Dior. Galliano used the wasp waist and rounded shoulders, modernised and updated with references to origami and other Japanese influences. In 2012 Raf Simons revisited the New Look for his debut haute couture collection for Dior, wishing to update its ideas for the 21st century in a minimalist but also sensual and sexy manner. Simons&#x27;s work for Dior retained the luxurious fabrics and silhouette, but encouraged self-respect for the woman&#x27;s body and liberation of expression. The design process for this collection, which was produced in only eight weeks, is documented in &quot;Dior and I&quot;, presenting Simons&#x27;s use of technology and modernist re-interpretations.

===Dior ===

Available references contradict themselves whether Christian Dior Parfums was established in 1947 or 1948. The Dior company lists the founding of Christian Dior Parfums as 1947, with the launch of its first perfume, &quot;Miss Dior&quot;. Dior revolutionized the perfume industry with the launch of the highly popular &quot;Miss Dior parfum&quot;, which was named after Catherine Dior (Christian Dior&#x27;s sister). Christian Dior Ltd owned 25%, manager of Coty perfumes held 35%, and Boussac owned 40% of the perfume business, headed by Serge Heftler Louiche. Pierre Cardin was made head of the Dior workshop from 1947 until 1950. In 1948, a Christian Dior Parfums branch in New York City was established—this could be the cause of the establishment-date issue. The modern Dior company also notes that &quot;a luxury ready-to-wear house is established in New York at the corner of 5th Avenue and 57th Street, the first of its kind,&quot; in 1948. In 1949, the &quot;Diorama&quot; perfume was released and by 1949, the New Look line alone made a profit of FFr 12.7 million.

===Expansion, and death of Christian Dior===
Expansion from France began by the end of 1949 with the opening of a Christian Dior boutique in New York City. By the end of the year, Dior fashions made up 75% of Paris&#x27;s fashion exports and 5% of France&#x27;s total export revenue.

In 1949, Douglas Cox from Melbourne, Australia, travelled to Paris to meet with Christian Dior to discuss the possibility of having Dior pieces made for the Australian market. Christian Dior and Douglas Cox signed a contract for Dior to produce original designs and for Douglas Cox to create them in his Flinders Lane workshop. A young Jill Walker, still in her mid teens, was one of the many workers for Douglas Cox, a couture label now in the headlines in Australian newspapers almost daily. Jill would go onto forming a couture legacy in Melbourne with popular labels such as Jinoel and Marti with husband Noel Kemelfield. The agreement between Dior and Douglas Cox put Australian dressmaking on the global stage, yet ultimately the 60 Dior models proved to be too avant-garde for the conservative Australian taste. Douglas Cox was unable to continue the contract beyond the single 1949 season making these Dior-Cox couture pieces some of the most rare collectors items in Australian couture.

In 1950, Jacques Rouët, the general manager of Dior Ltd, devised a licensing program to place the now-renowned name of &quot;Christian Dior&quot; visibly on a variety of luxury goods. It was placed first on neckties and soon was applied to hosiery, furs, hats, gloves, handbags, jewelry, lingerie, and scarves. Members of the French Chamber of Couture denounced it as a degrading action for the haute-couture image. Nevertheless, licensing became a profitable move and began a trend to continue &quot;for decades to come&quot;, which all couture houses followed.

Also in 1950, Christian Dior was the exclusive designer of Marlene Dietrich&#x27;s dresses in the Alfred Hitchcock film &quot;Stage Fright&quot;. In 1951, Dior released his first book, &quot;Je Suis Couturier&quot; (&quot;I am a Couturier&quot;) through publishers Editions du Conquistador. Despite the company&#x27;s strong European following, more than half of its revenue was generated in the United States by this time. Christian Dior Models Limited was created in London in 1952. An agreement was made between the Sydney label House of Youth for Christian Dior New York models. Los Gobelinos in Santiago, Chile, made an agreement with Dior for Christian Dior Paris Haute Couture. The first Dior shoe line was launched in 1953 with the aid of Roger Vivier. The company operated firmly established locations in Mexico, Cuba, Canada, and Italy by the end of 1953. As popularity of Dior goods grew, so did counterfeiting. This illegal business was supported by women who could not afford the luxury goods.

By the mid-1950s, the House of Dior operated a well-respected fashion empire. The first Dior boutique was established in 1954 at 9 Conduit Street. In honour of Princess Margaret and the Duchess of Marlborough, a Dior fashion show was held at the Blenheim Palace in 1954 as well. Christian Dior launched more highly successful fashion lines between the years of 1954 and 1957. However, none came as close to the profound effect of the New Look. Dior opened the Grande Boutique on the corner between Avenue Montaigne and Rue François Ier in 1955. The first Dior lipstick was also released in 1955. 100,000 garments had been sold by the time of the company&#x27;s 10th anniversary in 1956. Actress Ava Gardner had 14 dresses created for her in 1956 by Christian Dior for the Mark Robson film &quot;The Little Hut&quot;.

Christian Dior appeared on the cover of &quot;TIME&quot; dated 4 March 1957. The designer soon afterwards died from a third heart attack on 24 October 1957. The captivating impact of Dior&#x27;s creative fashion genius earned him recognition as one of history&#x27;s greatest fashion figures. Kevin Almond for &quot;Contemporary Fashion&quot; wrote that &quot;by the time Dior died his name had become synonymous with taste and luxury.&quot;

Throughout his career, Christian Dior&#x27;s designs were worn by notable figures such as Grace Kelly, Elizabeth Taylor, Edith Piaf, and Rita Hayworth, Marlene Dietrich, Princess Margaret, and Jennifer Jones reflecting his influence across Hollywood and European high society.

===Dior without Christian Dior: 1957 through the 1970s===
The death of the head designer left the House of Dior in chaos, and general manager Jacques Rouët considered shutting down operation worldwide. This possibility was not received graciously by Dior licensees and the French fashion industry; the Maison Dior was too important to the financial stability of the industry to allow such an action. To bring the label back on its feet, Rouët promoted the 21-year-old Yves Saint Laurent to Artistic Director the same year. Saint Laurent had joined the House&#x27;s family in 1955 after being personally picked out by the original designer for the position of the first ever and only Head Assistant. Saint Laurent initially proved to have been the most appropriate choice after the debut of his first collection for Dior (the mention of &quot;Dior&quot; from this moment on refers to the company) in 1958. The clothes were as meticulously made and perfectly proportioned as Dior&#x27;s in the same exquisite fabrics, but their young designer made them softer, lighter and easier to wear. Saint Laurent was hailed as a national hero. Emboldened by his success, his designs became more daring, culminating in the 1960 Beat Look inspired by the existentialists in the Saint-Germain des Près cafés and jazz clubs. His 1960 bohemian look was harshly criticized, and even more in &quot;Women&#x27;s Wear Daily&quot;. Marcel Boussac was furious, and in the spring, when Saint Laurent was forced to leave the house of Dior, having been called up to join the French army, the Dior management raised no objection. Saint Laurent left after the completion of six Dior collections.

Saint Laurent was replaced at Dior by designer Marc Bohan in late 1960. Bohan instilled his conservative style on the collections. He was credited by Rebecca Arnold as the man who kept the Dior label &quot;at the forefront of fashion while still producing wearable, elegant clothes,&quot; and Women&#x27;s Wear Daily, not surprisingly, claimed that he &quot;rescued the firm.&quot; Bohan&#x27;s designs were very well esteemed by prominent social figures. Actress Elizabeth Taylor ordered twelve Dior dresses from Bohan&#x27;s Spring-Summer 1961 collection featuring the &quot;Slim Look&quot;. The Dior perfume &quot;Diorling&quot; was released in 1963 and the men&#x27;s fragrance &quot;Eau Sauvage&quot; was released in 1966. Bohan&#x27;s assistant Philippe Guibourgé launched the first French ready-to-wear collection &quot;Miss Dior&quot; in 1967. This is not to be confused with the already existing New York Ready-to-Wear store established in 1948. Designed by Bohan, &quot;Baby Dior&quot; opened its first boutique in 1967 at 28 Avenue Montaigne. The Christian Dior Coordinated Knit line was released in 1968 and management of the Fashion Furs Department of Christian Dior was taken over by Frédéric Castet. This year as well, Dior Parfums was sold to Moët-Hennessy (which would itself become LVMH) due to Boussac&#x27;s ailing textile company (the still-owner of Dior). This, however, had no effect on the House of Dior operations, and so the &quot;Christian Dior Cosmetics&quot; business was born in 1969 with the creation of an exclusive line.

Following this, Bohan launched the first &quot;Christian Dior Homme&quot; clothing line in 1970. A new Dior boutique at Parly II was decorated by Gae Aulenti and the &quot;Diorella&quot; perfume was released in 1972. Christian Dior Ready-to-Wear Fur Collection was created in France in 1973, and then manufactured under license in the United States, Canada, and Japan. The first Dior watch &quot;Black Moon&quot; was released in 1975 in collaboration with licensee Benedom. Dior haute-couture graced the bodies of Princess Grace of Monaco, Nicaraguan First Lady Hope Portocarrero, Princess Alexandra of Yugoslavia, and Lady Pamela Hicks (Lord Mountbatten of Burma&#x27;s younger daughter) for the wedding of The Prince of Wales and Lady Diana Spencer. In 1978, the Boussac Group filed for bankruptcy and so its assets (including those of Christian Dior) were purchased by the Willot Group under the permission of the Paris Trade Court. The perfume &quot;Dioressence&quot; was released in 1979.

===Arrival of businessman Arnault===

In 1980, Dior released the men&#x27;s fragrance &quot;Jules&quot;. After the Willot Group went into bankruptcy in 1981, Bernard Arnault and his investment group purchased it for &quot;one symbolic franc&quot; in December 1984. The Dior perfume &quot;Poison&quot; was launched in 1985. That same year, Arnault became chairman, chief executive officer, and managing director of the company. On assuming leadership, Arnault did away with the company&#x27;s mediocre textile operations, to focus on the Bon Marché department store and Christian Dior Couture. Operations for Christian Dior drastically changed for the better under Arnault. He repositioned it as the holding company Christian Dior S.A. of the Dior Couture fashion business. On the 40th anniversary of Dior&#x27;s first collection, the Paris Fashion Museum dedicated an exhibition to Christian Dior. In 1988, Arnault&#x27;s Christian Dior S.A.&#x27;s took a 32% equity stake into the share capital of Moët-Hennessy • Louis Vuitton through its subsidiary Jacques Rober, creating what would become one of the leading and most influential luxury goods companies in the world. Under this milestone merger, the operations of Christian Dior Couture and Christian Dior Parfums were once again united. Italian-born Gianfranco Ferré replaced Bohan as head designer in 1989. The first such non-Frenchman, Ferré left behind traditional Dior associations of flirtation and romance, and introduced concepts and a style described as &quot;refined, sober and strict.&quot; Ferré headed design for Haute Couture, Haute Fourrure, Women&#x27;s Ready-to-Wear, Ready-to-Wear Furs and Women&#x27;s Accessories collections. His first collection was awarded the Dé d&#x27;Or in 1989. That year, a boutique was opened in Hawaii and the LVMH stake by Jacques Rober rose to 44%.

Further Dior boutiques were opened in 1990 in upscale New York City, Los Angeles, and Tokyo shopping districts. The stake in LVMH rose again, to 46%. Another collection of watches named &quot;Bagheera&quot; – inspired by the round design of the &quot;Black Moon&quot; watches – was also released in 1990. Having fired the company&#x27;s managing executive Beatrice Bongbault in December 1990, Arnault took up that position until September 1991, when he placed former Bon Marché president Phillipe Vindry at the post. In 1991, Christian Dior was listed on the spot market and then on the Paris Stock Exchange&#x27;s monthly settlement market, and the perfume &quot;Dune&quot; was launched. Vindry dropped ready-to-wear prices by 10%. Still, a wool suit from Dior would come with a price label of USD 1,500. 1990 revenue for Dior was USD 129.3 million, with a net income of $22 million. Dior was now reorganized into three categories: 1) women&#x27;s ready-to-wear, lingerie, and children&#x27;s wear 2) accessories and jewelry 3) menswear. Licensees and franchised boutiques were starting to be reduced, to increase the company&#x27;s control over brand product. Licensing was in fact reduced by nearly half because Arnault and Vindry opted &quot;for quality and exclusivity over quantity and accessibility.&quot; Wholly company-owned boutiques now opened in Hong Kong, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Cannes, and Waikiki, adding to its core stores located in New York City, Hawaii, Paris and Geneva. This held a potential to increase direct sales and profit margins while maintaining high-profile locations.&quot; In 1992, Dior Homme was placed under the artistic direction of Patrick Lavoix, and the &quot;Miss Dior&quot; perfume was relaunched. Francois Baufume succeeded Vindry in 1993 and continued to reduce licenses of the Dior name.
The production of Dior Haute Couture was spun off into a subsidiary named &quot;Christian Dior Couture&quot; in 1995. Also, the &quot;La Parisienne&quot; watch model was released – embodied in the watch &quot;Parisian Chic&quot;. By that year, revenue for the label rose to USD 177 million, with a net income of USD 26.9 million. Under the influence of Anna Wintour, editor and chief of Vogue, CEO Arnault appointed British designer John Galliano to replace Gianfranco Ferré in 1997 (Galliano on CBS News: &quot;without Anna Wintour I would certainly not be at the house of Dior&quot;). This choice of a British designer, once again instead of a French one, is said to have &quot;ruffled some French feathers&quot;. Arnault himself stated that he &quot;would have preferred a Frenchman&quot;, but that &quot;talent has no nationality&quot;. He even compared Galliano to Christian Dior himself, noting that &quot;Galliano has a creative talent very close to that of Christian Dior. He has the same extraordinary mixture of romanticism, feminism, and modernity that symbolised Monsieur Dior. In all of his creations – his suits, his dresses – one finds similarities to the Dior style.&quot; Galliano sparked further interest in Dior with somewhat controversial fashion shows, such as &quot;Homeless Show&quot; (models dressed in newspapers and paper bags) or &quot;S&amp;M Show&quot;. Meanwhile, Dior licenses were being reduced further by new president and CEO Sidney Toledano. On 15 October 1997, the Dior headquarters store on Avenue Montaigne was reopened –it had been closed and remodeled by Peter Marino – in a celebrity-studded event including Nicole Kidman, Demi Moore and Jacques Chirac. That year, Christian Dior Couture also took over all thirteen boutique franchises from Japan&#x27;s Kanebo.

In May 1998, another Dior boutique was opened in Paris. This time the store opened its doors on the Left Bank, Place Saint-Germain-des-Prés. Also this year, Victoire de Castellane became lead designer of &quot;Dior Fine Jewellery&quot; and the first Dior Fine Jewellery boutique opened in New York City. Paris itself would witness the opening of the first Parisian Dior Fine Jewellery boutique the following year, at 28 Avenue Montaigne. The perfume &quot;J&#x27;adore&quot; was released in 1999, and on 5 October 1999, Galliano released the Dior Spring-Summer 2000 ready-to-wear fashion show, debuting the new Saddle bag. In the same year, Dior&#x27;s long watch partner Benedom joined the LVMH group. In 2000, Galliano&#x27;s leadership was extended to Ready to wear, accessories, advertising and communications. The first campaign under his leadership was photographed by Nick Knight and featured two women simulating intercourse.

Like many other brands in the late 1990s, notably Gucci, featured suggestive images in their ads to draw public attention, Dior ads had such an impact that such publicity became a trend in most fashion ads. Galliano ignited the escalation of erotic advertisements, which culminated with Ungaro&#x27;s zoophilic ads, shot by Mario Sorrenti, and another ad for Gucci that featured a model with pubic hair shaped like the signature Gucci logo. As a matter of fact, it is considered that Galliano had revolutionized Dior more through his advertising campaigns than through his designs.

On 17 July 2000, Dior Homme lead designer Patrick Lavoix was replaced by Hedi Slimane. Notable Dior releases that year were watches such as the distinctive &quot;Malice&quot;, which features bracelets made of &quot;CD&quot; links, as well as the &quot;Riva&quot;. Hedi left Dior Homme in 2007 and replaced by Kris Van Assche.

===21st century===
In 2001, the Dior Homme boutique on 30 Avenue Montaigne reopened with a new &quot;contemporary masculine concept&quot; instilled by its designer Hedi Slimane. Slimane used this concept in the creation of his first Dior Homme collection. Soon, Dior Homme gained prominent male clientele including Brad Pitt and Mick Jagger.

John Galliano then began to release his own Dior watches in 2001, beginning with the &quot;Chris 47 Aluminum&quot; line, marking a new era in Dior watch design. Next, the &quot;Malice&quot; and &quot;Riva&quot; watches were redesigned with precious stones to create the &quot;Malice Sparkling&quot; and &quot;Riva Sparkling&quot; spin-off collections. Inspired by the Spring-Summer 2002 Ready-to-Wear collection, Dior released the &quot;Dior 66&quot; watch, breaking many feminine traditional expectations in design.
The men&#x27;s fragrance &quot;Higher&quot; was released in 2001, followed by the perfume &quot;Addict&quot; in 2002. The company then opened Milan&#x27;s first Dior Homme boutique on 20 February 2002. By 2002, 130 locations were in full operation. On 3 June 2002, Slimane was presented with the &quot;International Designer of the Year&quot; award by the CFDA. Until 2002, Kanebo was the Christian Dior ready-to-wear license holder in Japan and, when the license expired, Christian Dior was able to profitable directly sell its ready-to-wear and accessories in its own boutiques. The &quot;Chris 47 Steel&quot; watch was released in 2003 as a cousin of the original &quot;Chris 47 Aluminum&quot;. Bernard Arnault, Hélène Mercier-Arnault, and Sidney Toledano witnessed the opening of the Dior flagship boutique in the Omotesandō district of Tokyo on 7 December 2003. The second Dior flagship store was opened in the upscale Ginza shopping district of Tokyo in 2004. An exclusive Dior Homme boutique was opened also that year in Paris on Rue Royale, and it presented the entire Dior Homme collection. A second Dior Fine Jewelry boutique in Paris was opened at 8 Place Vendôme. A Christian Dior boutique was opened in Moscow after the company took control of licensed operations of its Moscow agent.

The designer of Dior Fine Jewelry Victoire de Castellane launched her own watch named &quot;Le D de Dior&quot; (French: &quot;The D of Dior&quot;). signifying the entrance of Dior watches into its collection of fine Jewelry. This watch was designed for women but made use of many design features which are typically thought of as masculine. Slimane next released a watch for the Dior Homme collection called &quot;Chiffre Rouge.&quot; This special watch included the signature look of Dior Homme: &quot;Watch design and technology match each other inseparably, to create the perfect expression of Dior Homme&#x27;s artistic excellence and to increase the watchmaking legitimacy of Dior timepieces.&quot; De Castellane then launched her second line of watches called &quot;La Baby de Dior&quot;. The design for this line was meant to be more feminine with more of a &quot;jewelry look.&quot;

The &quot;Miss Dior Chérie&quot; perfume and the &quot;Dior Homme&quot; fragrance were released in 2005. Galliano released his &quot;Dior Christal&quot; watches in which he combined steel and blue sapphires to create a &quot;creative and innovative collection.&quot; Christian Dior S.A. then celebrated the 13th anniversary of Dior Watches in 2005, and, in April of that year, its &quot;Chiffre Rouge&quot; collection was recognized by the World Watches and Jewelry Show in Basel, Switzerland. Also in the year, the fashion house also celebrated the 100th anniversary of the birthday of designer Christian Dior. An exhibition, &quot;Christian Dior: Man of the Century,&quot; was held in the Dior Museum in Granville, Normandy.

In 2006, the Dior watch booth was dedicated to the Dior Canework. This pattern was made by designer Christian Dior and based on the Napoleon III chairs used in his fashion shows.

In 2007, Kris Van Assche was appointed as the new artistic director of Dior Homme. Van Assche presented his first collection later that year. The 60th Anniversary of the founding of the Maison Dior was officially celebrated in 2007 as well.

By February 2011, the House of Dior was in scandal after accusations of John Galliano making antisemitic remarks made international headlines: the company found itself in a &quot;public relations nightmare.&quot; Galliano was fired in March and the scheduled presentation of his Fall-Winter 2011/2012 ready-to-wear collection went ahead without him, amid the controversy, on 4 March. Before the start of the show, chief executive Sydney Toledano gave a sentimental speech on the values of Christian Dior and alluded to the family&#x27;s ties to The Holocaust. The show closed with the staff of the atelier coming out to accept applause in the absence of their artistic director. (The previous January 2011 presentation of Spring-Summer 2011 haute-couture was the last appearance of Galliano on the Dior runway.) The company went on ahead and appointed Bill Gaytten as head designer interim in absence of artistic director. Gaytten had worked under Galliano for Dior and for the John Galliano label. The first haute-couture collection (for the Fall-Winter 2011 season) under Gaytten&#x27;s management was presented in July and was received with mainly negative reviews. Meanwhile, speculation remained for months as it was unknown who would be selected to replace Galliano. During its 13-month period of having no artistic director, Dior began undergoing subtle changes in its designs as the influence of the theatrical and flamboyant Galliano faded. The all-new resigned dior.com was launched in late 2011.
On 23 January 2012, Gaytten presented his second haute-couture collection (for the Spring-Summer 2012 season) for Dior and it was much better received than his first collection.

Belgian designer Raf Simons was announced, on 11 April 2012, as the new artistic director of Christian Dior. Simons was known for his minimalist designs, and this contrasted against the dramatic previous designs of Dior under Galliano. Furthermore, Simons was seen to have emerged as a &quot;dark horse&quot; amid the names of other designers who were considered high contenders. To emphasize the appropriate choice of Simons as the right designer, the company ostentatiously made comparisons between Simons and the original designer Christian Dior. Reportedly, Bernard Arnault and fellow executives at Dior and LVMH were keen to move Dior from the Galliano years. Simons spent much time in the Dior archives and familiarizing himself with haute-couture (as he had no previous background in that niche of fashion). Simons was then scheduled to debut his designs in July. Meanwhile, Gaytten&#x27;s Spring-Summer 2012 haute-couture collection was presented as the first Dior haute-couture show ever to be held in China on 14 April in Shanghai; and it was a mark of the company&#x27;s devotion to its presence in the Chinese market.

The show was the last presentation by Gaytten for Dior, and he remained as head designer for the John Galliano label.

On 3 May, the &quot;Dior: Secret Garden — Versailles&quot; promotional film was launched. It was highly buzzed about throughout various industry and social media sources as it was a display of Dior through its transition. Simons presented his first-ever collection for the company — the Fall-Winter 2012 haute-couture collection — on 2 July. A major highlight of the fall-winter 2012 haute-couture shows, the collection was called by the company as &quot;the new couture&quot; and made reference to the start of a new Dior through the work of Simons &quot;wiping the [haute couture] slate clean and starting again from scratch.&quot; The designer&#x27;s collection &quot;made more references to Mr. Dior than to the house of Dior&quot; with pieces harkening back to themes Dior&#x27;s post-World War II designs introduced to fashion. Simons, who rarely makes himself available for interviews, gave an interview published by the company through its Dior Mag online feature. While previous runway presentations under Galliano were held at the Musée Rodin, Simons&#x27; show was held at a private residence, near the Arc de Triomphe, with the address only disclosed to select top-clients, celebrities, journalists, and other personnel exclusively invited in a discreet affair. High-profile figures in attendance included designers Azzedine Alaïa, Pierre Cardin, Alber Elbaz (Lanvin designer), Diane von Fürstenberg, Marc Jacobs, Christopher Kane, Olivier Theyskens, Riccardo Tisci, Donatella Versace; and Princess Charlene of Monaco, actresses Marion Cotillard, Mélanie Laurent, Jennifer Lawrence, Sharon Stone; film producer Harvey Weinstein; and Dior chairman Arnault with his daughter. Live satellite feed of the show was provided on DiorMag online and Twitter was also implemented for real time communication. By then, it was also known that the company had purchased the Parisian embroidery firm Maison Vermont sometime earlier in 2012.

In March 2015 it was announced that Barbadian singer, actress and businesswoman Rihanna was chosen as the official spokeswoman for Dior; this makes her the first black woman to take the spokeswoman position at Dior. In 2015, Israeli model Sofia Mechetner was chosen to be the new face of Dior.

In 2016, Maria Grazia Chiuri was named the women&#x27;s artistic director for Dior.

In April 2016 a new Dior flagship boutique opened in San Francisco, with a party hosted by Jaime King.

In 2017, Dior renovated and expanded its Madrid store. The brand celebrated the opening of the new boutique in a masked ball attended by a number of Spanish celebrities like Alejandro Gómez Palomo.

In March 2018, Kim Jones was named the men&#x27;s artistic director for the house. Under his management Dior has made several high profile streetwear collaborations. Jones first show for Dior featured American artist and designer Brian Donnelly, a.k.a. KAWS. Thereafter followed collaborations with Raymond Pettibon, 1017 ALYX 9SM, Yoon Ahn, Hajime Sorayama, Daniel Arsham, Sacai and most recently Shawn Stussy, creator of the legendary streetwear brand Stüssy.

In October 2019, Dior apologized to China for using a map of China that excluded Taiwan.

On 11 March 2022, 30 Avenue Montaigne has once again opened its doors to the public. The property was closed for two years for a major renovation led by architect Peter Marino. Historically, 30 Avenue Montaigne is the place where Christian Dior showcased his first collection.

In January 2023, it was announced Delphine Arnault would assume the role of chairperson and CEO, beginning in February.

In January 2025, Dior announced the departure of Kim Jones after 7 years with the brand. They have not named a successor.

Dior pays subcontractors as little as 53 euro for a handbag sold for 2600 euro.

==Criticism==

=== 2000s ===
In 2000, Galliano&#x27;s collection inspired by homeless people drew criticism, but also attention, to the house of Dior.

=== 2010s ===
In early 2011, scandal arose when John Galliano was accused of making antisemitic comments after drinking in Paris. Footage was released of the designer under the influence of alcohol saying &quot;I love Hitler&quot; and &quot;People like you would be dead today. Your mothers, your forefathers would be fucking gassed and dead&quot; to a non-Jewish woman. In France, it is against the law to make antisemitic remarks, and is punishable by up to six months in prison. On 1 March 2011, Christian Dior officially announced that it had fired Galliano amidst the controversy.

== Plagiarism, cultural appropriation, poor labour conditions issues ==

=== 2017 ===
In 2017, Dior was accused of cultural appropriation by directly plagiarizing a Bihor coat, a traditional Romanian vest, by using the same colour and patterns in its pre-fall collection; Dior had presented it as their original designs without giving any credit to the people of Bihor nor crediting the Romanian people as source of inspiration. As a result, Romanian people were outraged and to fight against this cultural appropriation, a campaign was launched by Romanian fashion magazine &quot;Beau Monde&quot; who then recruited native craftsmen and fashion designers from Bihor to create a new line of fashion. The cover of the Beau Monde magazine read:

Thus, the online platform named Bihor Couture was launched; Bihor Couture also publicly shamed Dior for &quot;theft&quot; and sold original artisan-made versions of the traditional Romanian vest.

=== 2022 ===

In April 2022, Dior released a new midi-skirt in Seoul, Dior&#x27;s art director Maria Grazia Chiuri described the 2022 Fall collection design was inspired by school uniform (including pleated skirts), also in honour of Catherine Dior. This new skirt was plain black wrap-around skirt which was made of two panels of fabric which was sewn to the waistband of the skirt; it featured four flat panels with no pleats (one at each side of each panel of fabric) and pleats; it was constructed in an overlapping fashion such that there was two overlapping flat surface at the back and front and side pleats when worn. On its official website page, this skirt was described as &quot;a hallmark Dior silhouette, the mid-length skirt is updated with a new elegant and modern variation [...]&quot;.

Three month later, this skirt was noticed by some Hanfu enthusiasts, who criticized it as being created by copying the design. They also indicated that this skirt have the exact same cut and construction as the with only its length being the difference from the orthodox-style and historical of the Ming dynasty (1368–1644 AD). It was, however, noted by Chinese netizens that the 21st modified, modern version of the , also included midi-, had been designed in the past years by Chinese Hanfu designers.

Dior decided to stop this sale in Mainland China to avoid controversy. On 23 July, about 50 Chinese overseas students in Paris, France, made a protest in front of a Dior flagship store at the Champs-Élysées, they used the slogan &quot;Dior, Stop Cultural Appropriation&quot; and &quot;This is a traditional Chinese dress&quot; written with a mixture of French and English; they also called for other overseas students from the United Kingdom and the United States for relay, the Communist Youth League of China also expressed support for this protest. There are also more than 10 Chinese democratic activists lifted banners writing &quot;Skirt Rights Is Bigger Than Human Rights&quot; etc. for anti-protest. And both sides started a conflict with each other. Chinese news media initially have no mention for anti-protest but focused on cultural embezzling accuse. Chinese network also spread a theory that the democracy activists were composed by Taiwanese.

Some French news media commented this was largely due to Dior does not describe its origin for sale with transparency, most criticize views argued that Dior did not respect to Chinese traditions. According to the &quot;Journal du Luxe&quot;, a French news media, the adoption of the cut and construction design by Dior was not the main issue of the debate and critics but rather on the absence of transparency surrounding the origins of the inspirations behind the skirt design. Some Chinese netizens also criticized Dior on Weibo with comments, such as &quot;Was Dior inspired by Taobao?&quot; while another Instagram user commented on the official Dior account:

Dior was accused of cultural appropriation for a second time in July 2022 for due to its usage of pattern print which looks like the () into its 2022 autumn and winter ready-to-wear collection having introduced it as being Dior&#x27;s signature motif &quot;Jardin d&#x27;Hiver&quot;, which was inspired by Christian Dior&#x27;s wall murals; the is a traditional Chinese painting theme which belong to the Chinese scholar-artist style in Chinese painting and originated in the Tang dynasty.

=== 2024 ===
In June 2024, Italian authorities placed Manufactures Dior SRL, a subsidiary of Christian Dior Italia SRL, under judicial administration for one year, for poor labour practices in its supply chain. This decision followed investigations revealing that four small suppliers in the Milan area employed 32 workers under exploitative conditions. Among these workers, two were undocumented immigrants, and seven lacked the necessary documentation. The workers were found to live and work in unsanitary conditions, with inadequate health and safety measures. Additionally, the suppliers operated continuously, including during holidays, and removed safety devices from machinery to increase production speed.

Subsequently, in July 2024, the Autorità Garante della Concorrenza e del Mercato (AGCM), launched an investigation Dior and other fashion companies. The probe aims to determine whether these companies misled consumers regarding their labor practices and supply chain management.

==Ownership and shareholdings==
At the end of 2010, the only declared major shareholder in Christian Dior S.A. was Groupe Arnault SAS, the family holding company of Bernard Arnault. The group&#x27;s control amounted to 69.96% of Dior&#x27;s stock and 82.86% of its voting rights. The remaining shares are considered free float.

Christian Dior S.A. held 42.36% of the shares of LVMH and 59.01% of its voting rights at the end of 2010. Arnault held an additional 5.28% of shares and 4.65% of votes directly.

<text>Big Thunder Mountain Railroad is a mine train roller coaster located at Disneyland, Magic Kingdom, Tokyo Disneyland and Disneyland Park (Paris). In Tokyo and Paris, the attraction is named Big Thunder Mountain. Big Thunder Mountain Railroad is also the name of the fictional rail line the roller coaster depicts.

==Theme==

Although the details of the backstory vary from park to park, all follow the same general story arc. Sometime in the late 1800s, gold was discovered on Big Thunder Mountain in the American Southwest. Overnight, a small mining town became a thriving one (Rainbow Ridge in Disneyland; Tumbleweed in Florida; Thunder Mesa in Disneyland Paris) under the thumb of the greedy mining company owner (Barnabas T. Bullion in the American versions, Henry Ravenswood in Disneyland Paris). Mining was prosperous, and an extensive line of mine trains was set up to transport the ore. Unknown to the settlers, the mountain was a sacred spot to local Native Americans and was cursed.

Before long, the settlers&#x27; desecration of the mountain caused a great tragedy, which, depending on the park, is usually depicted to be an earthquake (Disneyland and Disneyland Paris), a tsunami (Tokyo Disneyland), or a flash flood (Walt Disney World), which befell the mines and town, and the town was abandoned. Some time later, the locomotives were found to be racing around the mountain on their own, without engineers or a crew. The Big Thunder Mountain Railroad was founded in the old mining camp to allow wanderers to take rides on the possessed trains.

The detailed backstory, while present in park literature and training materials, is not communicated to park guests directly. The station buildings on all four versions of the ride are themed to the appearance of a mining company office from the mid to late 19th century. In the Disneyland park, there is music and laughing in one of the saloons of Rainbow Ridge, and a typewriter is heard from a newspaper office. The mountains themselves are themed to the red rock formations of the American Southwest. The rock work designs in the Disneyland version are based on the hoodoos of Bryce Canyon National Park in Utah. In the Florida, Tokyo and Paris versions of the ride, the rockwork designs are based on the rising buttes that are located in Arizona and at Monument Valley in Utah. Walt Disney Imagineering designed the attraction to make it appear that the rocks were there originally, and the track was built around the rocks, unlike a number of earlier mine rides, which were built the other way around (by sculpting the rocks around the tracks). There is also a dinosaur skeleton that the train passes by in all versions of the ride except the Paris version. A cracked eggshell is nearby, and there is a lake with water that is shot up while the train passes on the warmer days. Sound effects of a typical locomotive operation are piped into the surrounding scenery to add realism to guests viewing the ride from observation platforms, including the steam whistle sounding, even though there is no whistle displayed on the locomotives.

==History==
Big Thunder Mountain Railroad was designed by Imagineer Tony Baxter and ride design engineer Bill Watkins. The concept came from Baxter&#x27;s work on fellow Imagineer Marc Davis&#x27;s concept for the Western River Expedition, a western-themed pavilion at the Magic Kingdom, designed to look like an enormous plateau and contain many rides, including a runaway mine train roller coaster. However, because the pavilion as a whole was deemed too expensive in light of the construction and 1973 opening of Pirates of the Caribbean, Baxter proposed severing the mine train and building it as a separate attraction.

The Big Thunder Mountain Railroad project was put on hold again in 1974 as resources and personnel were being diverted to work on constructing Space Mountain in Tomorrowland, but this delay may have ultimately produced a smoother ride as the use of computers in attraction design was just beginning when the project was resumed. Big Thunder Mountain Railroad was one of the first Disney rides to utilize computer-aided design. Four of Disney&#x27;s parks feature the attraction. It first opened at Disneyland in 1979, and then a larger version debuted at Magic Kingdom in Florida in 1980. Tokyo Disneyland&#x27;s version opened in 1987. Disneyland Paris opened with its version in 1992, of which its layout and structure is primarily based on the Florida version of the ride. The Disneyland Paris installation is also the only Big Thunder Mountain to have been an opening-day attraction at its park.

In August 2018, the Paris location got a single rider line. Guests take the normal line and a cast member directs them either towards the single rider entrance or the normal pathway at the level of the panel located a little before the covered line. Less than two years later, a single rider line was also added to the Tokyo location in January 2020. In 2024, the Walt Disney Company announced that the Magic Kingdom location was planned to close for a year-long renovation beginning on January 6, 2025.

===Tributes to predecessor===
At Disneyland, Big Thunder Mountain Railroad was built on the land the Mine Train Through Nature&#x27;s Wonderland used to occupy. Several tributes to the former attraction are present in the Disneyland version. A scaled-down Western town sits adjacent to the queuing lines and tracks near the station. A Western saloon, hotel, assayer&#x27;s office and mercantile appear among the buildings. This is the village of Rainbow Ridge, which used to overlook the loading platform of the sedate Mine Train through Nature&#x27;s Wonderland. Many of the animal animatronics throughout the attraction were reused from the previous attraction. Other allusions to the Mine Train through Nature&#x27;s Wonderland include the Rainbow Caverns (glowing pools of water by the first lift hill) and precariously balanced rocks in the third lift hill tunnel.

The name of the ride itself, &quot;Big Thunder&quot;, was originally the name of a large waterfall the old mine train passed on its tour. &quot;Little Thunder&quot; was located nearby.

===Name===
At the Magic Kingdom and at Disneyland, the ride is known by its full name of &quot;Big Thunder Mountain Railroad&quot;. The Tokyo and Paris versions drop the word &quot;Railroad&quot;, although the full name is still present on the trains.

===Kidney stones===
In the October 2016 &quot;Journal of the American Osteopathic Association&quot;, a paper entitled &quot;Validation of a Functional Pyelocalyceal Renal Model for the Evaluation of Renal Calculi Passage While Riding a Roller Coaster&quot; was published. The paper&#x27;s author, Dr. Wartinger, found that patients of his had passed kidney stones after riding Big Thunder Mountain Railroad at Walt Disney World on vacation, including one who passed three stones on three separate occasions. The doctor then tested this result, with the permission of Disney, with a 3D model of a kidney by riding the ride over 20 times. The study found nearly 70% of the time, the kidney stone was passed, with results varying depending on which row they were in. The study also found that Space Mountain and Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roller Coaster Starring Aerosmith failed to cause this result.

==Ride experience==

===Disneyland version===
While the design of the Walt Disney World version of the ride was done first, Disneyland&#x27;s version was the first one to open. The track layout was mirrored, placing the attraction to the right of Rivers of America, if viewed from the central hub. (In Walt Disney World, the attraction is located to the left of Rivers of America.) To better fit with the adjacent Fantasyland areas of the theme park, the original Walt Disney World design had to be replaced with something more appropriate for Disneyland. The Florida, Tokyo and Paris versions of the ride use sharp-edged mountains and the vibrant colors of Monument Valley, Arizona, while Disneyland&#x27;s version was developed with more rounded features and muted colors resembling the Bryce Canyon hoodoos in Utah.

Upon entering the attraction, the queue winds through a narrow rock wall and passing by the tracks. The surrounding walls were originally created from 100 tons of gold ore from Rosamond.

Leaving the outdoor station, trains enter a bat-infested tunnel, make a right hand turn, then a left hand turn before climbing the first lift hill, which takes trains through a cavern full of stalactites. Leaving the lift hill, the train drops away to the right, then levels out and makes a left hand turn. The track then crosses under the second lift hill drop before making a right hand turn. The sounds of coyotes can be heard howling at the train as it dives into a cave. The train then rises uphill and hits a trim brake, makes a right turn out of the tunnel, and climbs the second lift hill. At the top of the lift, an animatronic goat with a stick of dynamite in its mouth bleats at passing guests as the train drops away to the right, crosses under the lift hill, and rises up into a downward spiraling clockwise helix. Leaving the helix, the train shoots through a small canyon, then drops down into a mining camp, where it hits another trim brake. The train then makes a left hand turn, enters another tunnel, and climbs the third lift hill. As the train climbs the lift, the tunnel is dynamited, and artificial smoke is blasted in guests&#x27; faces as the train crests the lift and exits the tunnel. The train then drops to the right, towards the river, then makes a right hand turn and passes through a short tunnel. After crossing over the drop, the trains make a left hand turn as they pass through the ribcage of a T-rex skeleton, hit a trim brake, then make a right hand turn into the final brakes. The train then travels past the buildings of Rainbow Ridge and returns to the station.

California&#x27;s version of the ride is the only version of the ride to feature an outdoor station. All of the other versions feature an indoor station.

On January 7, 2013, the ride was closed for an extensive refurbishment that included a new track, trains, scenery, and new effects on the third lift hill. The attraction reopened on March 17, 2014. The new track was fabricated by Dynamic Structures, the company that had previously rehauled the coaster track in Space Mountain.

===Magic Kingdom version===

The track layout of the Magic Kingdom&#x27;s version is a nearly identical mirrored layout of the Disneyland attraction.

Riders board the trains in an enclosed loading station on a hillside. Leaving the station, trains make a left hand turn into a bat-infested tunnel, make a slight right turn, and climb the first lift hill. At the top of the lift hill, trains pass under a waterfall and drop to the left. This is followed by a right hand turn, after which the track crosses under the second lift hill and drop. After crossing under the second lift hill drop, the track goes through a 270 degree clockwise spiral and passes through a short tunnel. Trains emerge from the tunnel and pass through the flooded town of Tumbleweed, running parallel to the Walt Disney World Railroad. The train passes over a decaying trestle (where the track is slightly banked from side to side), before entering Davy Jones Mine, where it hits a trim brake. Trains then make a left hand turn and climb the second lift hill.

At the top of the second lift hill, trains drop to the left and cross under the lift hill, before rising into a 540 degree downhill counterclockwise helix, passing over a broken trestle. Leaving the helix, trains shoot up across a small hill, make a slight right turn, then drop through another tunnel and hit a trim brake. The trains then make a right hand turn into a tunnel and climb the third lift hill. As the train climbs the lift, an earthquake hits and makes the train cars sway from side to side (the effect achieved by slightly banking the track). Leaving the lift, trains emerge from the tunnel, crest a small rise, and drop to the left towards the Rivers of America. After traveling along a short section of straight track, the ride then makes a left hand turn through a short tunnel and crosses a short bridge. The train then makes a right hand turn, and passes through the ribcage of a T-Rex skeleton as it hits the final trim brake, makes a left hand turn past some geysers and hot springs, and rises into the final brakes. The train then makes a left turn back into the station.

The Florida version was allocated more space in the park, and so the Monument Valley-inspired ride structure assumes 2.5 acres, 25 percent larger than the Disneyland version. Due to the ride being surrounded by the Rivers of America on the east and the Walt Disney World Railroad on the west, the maintenance facility for the trains is on the opposite side of the Railroad&#x27;s track from the ride, with a swing bridge being used where the transfer track crosses the Railroad, just past the Frontierland station.

On January 5, 2025, the Magic Kingdom version of the ride was temporarily closed for a complete refurbishment and installation of new track. Additionally, the maintenance shed was removed to accommodate the new Villains Land.

===Tokyo Disneyland version===

Big Thunder Mountain at Tokyo Disneyland is similar to the Florida version, but there are some differences in the ride layout. Instead of Tumbleweed, the track makes a left turn and dives into a cave, mirroring the California version of the ride. More significantly, the final segment of the ride is different. Instead of crossing back over the drop from the third lift hill, the track makes a 180 degree turn to the right before dropping out of a tunnel, through the Boneyard/geyser scene, into a short tunnel. The track then makes a right hand turn into the final brakes. The trains pass in front of the station building, and then turn back into the loading area.
===Disneyland Paris version===

The Paris version of the ride is unique as it is situated on an island in the middle of the Rivers of the Far West, where Tom Sawyer&#x27;s Island would normally sit. It is also the only version of the ride to be an opening day attraction and the largest installment at any Disney park. Also unlike the other versions, the trains at the Paris version are painted to look weathered and aged.

Guests board the trains at a station on the mainland. Immediately upon leaving the station, trains dive into a tunnel that transports them under the Rivers of the Far West to the island where the ride is located. The train makes a right hand turn, and makes a quick steep rise before starting up the first lift hill. As trains climb out of the darkness of the underwater tunnel, stalactites and stalagmites can be seen growing next to the track, along with several rainbow colored pools of water. The sounds of bats swooping up above can also be heard. During warmer months, a waterfall parts around the track at the top of the hill. Trains pop out of the tunnel, leave the lift hill, and drop around a left hand turn, pass through a small cave, then make a swooping right turn. If the trains are being dispatched timely, when the train goes through this curve, it will appear to make a near miss with a train in the 540 degree helix.

After this turn, the trains pass under the second lift hill and its drop, making a slight hop, before making a left hand turn onto a trestle. The trains run along the Rivers of the Far West, across the water from Phantom Manor (the park&#x27;s version of The Haunted Mansion), then make a slight right hand turn and suddenly fall through a washed out section of the trestle. The trestle drop also contains an on-ride camera. After dropping down to the water level (with water jets on the sides of the track simulating a splashdown), the trains go around a left turn, enter a mill camp, and begin climbing the second lift hill.

As trains start up the lift hill, two tied down donkeys can be seen to the right side of the track, braying at passing trains, with an empty watering pail in front of them. A goat can be seen pulling on a shirt hanging on a clothesline to the riders&#x27; left, as the trains pass a parked steamroller and mine elevator, and travel under a water tower.

At the top of the lift, the trains drop to the left and cross back under the lift hill. Coming out of the drop, the trains go over another rise, hitting a magnetic trim brake, and enter a 540 degree counterclockwise helix, passing over a broken trestle.

Exiting the helix, the trains pass through a short cave and go over a quick airtime hill as they shoot down a canyon. As the trains drop through the tunnel and pass over a trim brake, a loud gust of wind is heard. Trains then make a right hand turn on another trestle, enter a tunnel with signs warning of blasting over the portal, and climb the third lift hill.

As the train starts up the third hill, the tunnel is dynamited, and artificial smoke is blasted in guests&#x27; faces as the train crests the lift and exits the tunnel. The train crests a small hill, then drops to the left onto a straightaway alongside the river, speeding up as it enters the return tunnel. The train encounters a swarm of bats in the tunnel as it makes another sharp counter-clockwise turnaround and goes down a steep drop to cross under the water. The trains continue to accelerate through the dark until it pops out of the exit portal on the mainland. An additional chain lift is located here to assist the train in leaving the tunnel. The train then coasts past the station, through the loading dock, and then makes a left turn to reenter the station.

The Paris version underwent a year long refurbishment from November 2015 to December 2016. As part of the renovation, the brakes were overhauled, some of the scenery was repainted, and a few elements from the California version were added (rainbow pools of water on the first lift hill cave, new sound effects for the mine elevator on the second lift hill, new mapping effects for the blasting scene on the third lift hill). Interactive games were also installed in the queue.

==In other media==

===In film===
The sounds of Disneyland&#x27;s Big Thunder Mountain Railroad trains were recorded and used as sound effects for the mine cart chase sequence in Steven Spielberg and George Lucas&#x27; 1984 film, &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot;. Disneyland would later get its own &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; attraction in 1995, and the Walt Disney Company would go on to acquire the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; franchise with its purchase of Lucasfilm in 2012.

In August 2022, it was announced that a film adaptation of the ride was in development. Amber Templemore-Finlayson and Katie Ellwood, collectively known as &quot;Bert &amp; Bertie&quot;, will serve as co-directors after the pair impressed studio executives with their pitched approach to the property. The script is being co-written by Michele and Kieran Mulroney. The project will be a joint-venture production between LuckyChap Entertainment, and Scott Free Productions.

In 2022, Disney Television Animation short series &quot;Chibi Tiny Tales&quot; featured a crossover short with &quot;The Proud Family: Louder and Prouder&quot; characters visiting the ride.

===In television===
In January 2013, ABC ordered a pilot based on the ride titled &quot;Big Thunder Mountain&quot;, but the idea was scrapped sometime after.

In the &quot;Modern Family&quot; episode &quot;Disneyland&quot;, Phil (Ty Burrell) and his son Luke (Nolan Gould) ride Big Thunder Mountain Railroad together during a family trip to Disneyland in Anaheim. Phil, who self-proclaims to be king of the roller coasters, begins to feel even more queasy when riding Big Thunder, after he and Luke had exited Indiana Jones Adventure prior.

===Print media===
In October 2014, Marvel Comics announced a five-issue series based on the attraction, which eventually debuted in early 2015. Part of Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Disney Kingdoms&quot; line, the series elaborated on the story behind the attraction and featured input from Walt Disney Imagineering, including numerous nods to elements of the ride. The story would focus around Abigail Bullion, the spirited daughter of Big Thunder Mining Company founder Barnabas T. Bullion. She falls in with a group of bandits seeking to undermine the authority of Barnabas and his corrupt foreman Willikers and put stolen wealth from the mountain to good use helping the townspeople of Rainbow Ridge.

==Incidents==

*March 10, 1998, Disneyland: A 5-year-old boy was seriously injured when his foot became wedged between the passenger car&#x27;s running board and the edge of the exterior platform after the train temporarily paused before pulling into the unloading area. All of the toes on his left foot required amputation. This led to improvements to the ride, although the family maintains the park would not acknowledge this injury as the reason. 
*September 5, 2003, Disneyland: A 22-year-old man died after suffering severe blunt trauma and extensive internal bleeding in a derailment that also injured 10 other riders. The cause of the accident was determined to be improper maintenance. Investigation reports and discovery by the victim&#x27;s attorney confirmed the fatal injuries occurred when the first passenger car collided with the underside of the locomotive. The derailment was the result of a mechanical failure which occurred due to omissions during a maintenance procedure. Fasteners on the left side upstop/guide wheel on the floating axle of the locomotive were not tightened and safetied in accordance with specifications. As the train entered a tunnel the axle came loose and jammed against a brake section, causing the locomotive to become airborne and hit the ceiling of the tunnel. The locomotive then fell on top of the first passenger car, crushing the victim. After the investigation to this incident was complete, the ride was reopened on March 11, 2004.
*April 25, 2011, Disneyland Paris: Five guests were injured when a piece of scenery fell onto a passing train. One guest, a 38-year-old man, was seriously injured and transported to a Paris hospital, while the other four were treated at the scene.
*October 27, 2011, Disneyland Paris: Two cars derailed as one of the ride&#x27;s trains passed slowly over a flat section of track. Two guests were slightly injured, and the ride was subsequently closed for inspections.
*February 2017, a 54-year-old man died after riding Magic Kingdom&#x27;s attraction at Walt Disney World. The cause of his death is believed to be from natural causes due to a pre-existing medical condition. A Disney spokesperson said the ride was operating as normal.

<text>Donald Lee Beebe (born December 18, 1964) is an American college football coach and former wide receiver. He is the head football coach for Aurora University, a position he has held since 2019. He previously played in the National Football League (NFL) for nine seasons, primarily with the Buffalo Bills. In addition to his six seasons with the Bills, who selected him in the third round of the 1989 NFL draft, he was a member of the Carolina Panthers during their inaugural season and played for the Green Bay Packers in his last two seasons.

A member of the Bills teams that lost four consecutive Super Bowls, Beebe achieved recognition for preventing an opposing touchdown by forcing a fumble in Super Bowl XXVII, despite the Bills facing an insurmountable deficit. He made two further Super Bowl appearances with the Packers and was part of the team winning Super Bowl XXXI. Beebe pursued a coaching career after retirement and was hired as Aurora&#x27;s head football coach in 2019.

==Early life==
Beebe is one of five children of Don and Barb Beebe. He attended Kaneland High School in Maple Park, Illinois where he lettered in basketball, track and football, graduating in 1983. After attending Western Illinois University, he transferred to Chadron State College in Nebraska, where he set several school football records his senior year and ran a 6.3 60-yard dash on the indoor track team.

In his sole season with Chadron State, Beebe caught 49 passes for 906 yards and rushed 10 times for 81. He became the first player in school history to score a touchdown in every game, while also setting single-season school records for most all-purpose yards (1,661), points scored (90), and touchdowns (15). In 2000, Beebe was inducted into Chadron State&#x27;s athletic hall of fame.

As of 2020, he still holds the following Chadron State football records:
* Most touchdown receptions in a game: 4 vs. Black Hills State, 1988
* Most touchdowns scored: 5 vs. Black Hills State, 1988
* Kick Returns and Kick Return Yards in a season: 29 for 722 yards, 1988

==NFL career==
Beebe was drafted by the Buffalo Bills in the third round (82nd pick overall) of the 1989 NFL draft. He posted impressive statistics in speed and agility drills at the 1989 pre-draft combine.

In his nine NFL seasons, Beebe caught 219 passes for 3,416 yards, rushed for 28 yards, returned 81 kickoffs for 1,735 yards, and scored 25 touchdowns (23 receiving, one kickoff return, and one fumble recovery). He appeared in five Super Bowls as a player: XXVI, XXVII, and XXVIII with the Buffalo Bills (missing XXV due to injury) and XXXI and XXXII with Green Bay. While Buffalo lost its four consecutive title games, Beebe ultimately won a Super Bowl with the Packers in XXXI.

Beebe is well known for making one of the most memorable plays in Super Bowl history during XXVII against the Dallas Cowboys. In the game&#x27;s fourth quarter, Cowboys defensive tackle Leon Lett recovered a Bills fumble and advanced the ball toward the end zone. However, Lett began to celebrate prematurely by holding the ball out to his right side. Although the Bills were losing 52–17 at the time, a relentless Beebe streaked down the field and knocked the ball out of Lett&#x27;s hands just before he crossed the goal line. The loose ball went through the end zone and out of bounds for a touchback and prevented a Dallas touchdown, which would have given them a Super Bowl-record 58 points, plus (presumably) an extra point kick. Beebe also caught two passes for 50 yards, including a 40-yard touchdown reception from Frank Reich earlier in the game.

Beebe played one season for the Carolina Panthers in 1995 before finishing his career with the Packers. With injuries ravaging the Packers&#x27; receiving corps in 1996, Beebe ended up being the Packers&#x27; second-leading receiver, with 39 receptions, 699 receiving yards, 4 touchdown receptions, as well as the only kickoff return touchdown of his career.

His standout game came in an overtime battle against the San Francisco 49ers, where Beebe had 11 receptions for 220 yards and one touchdown in a 23–20 Packer victory. The most controversial play of the game occurred when Beebe stumbled and fell after catching a pass from Favre. Beebe got up and ran the ball in for a 59-yard touchdown. Replays show that he was tagged by Marquez Pope and should have been ruled down, but referees missed the call and video review was not available that year.

==Coaching career==
In 1998, Beebe founded House of Speed, LLC, a company that specializes in training athletes in the essentials of top performance, speed and character. House of Speed began franchise operations in 2006 and has locations in eleven states. Beebe also works with several professional, collegiate and amateur sports organizations in the area of speed, including the Chicago Bears, the Los Angeles Rams, the University of Illinois Fighting Illini and Club Fusion Volleyball.

In 2004, Beebe began coaching football for Aurora Christian Schools in Aurora, Illinois. He—along with his brother, defensive coordinator David Beebe, and brother Dan, the school&#x27;s athletic director—led the Eagles to the school&#x27;s first state championship appearance in 2008, where the team finished as 4A state runner-up after losing to Bloomington Central Catholic 37–28. Three years later Beebe and the Eagles returned to the finals, this time winning the 2011 IHSA Class 3A State Championship with a 34–7 win over Mt. Carmel. In 2012, Beebe led the Eagles to a second straight IHSA Class 3A State Championship by defeating Tolono-Unity 42–12 before stepping down as coach after the 2013 season and an overall 97–26 record. His brother succeeded him as head coach.

In November 2018, Beebe was named the head coach at Aurora University, replacing Rick Ponx, who was fired just the day before.

==Personal life==
In 2000, Chadron State renamed its renovated football stadium after Beebe, calling it Elliott Field at Don Beebe Stadium.

Beebe wrote a book with Denise Crosby titled &quot;Six Rings from Nowhere&quot;. As of 2014, a deal was in the works to develop the book into a feature film about Beebe&#x27;s life and Christian faith.

Beebe&#x27;s son, Chad, was a wide receiver for Northern Illinois University, a wide receiver for the Minnesota Vikings NFL team from 2018 to 2022, and was a wide receiver for the Houston Texans in 2022.

<doc id="1313414" wikidata="Q10306550" url="?curid=1313414" title="Jean Kerr">
<text>Jean Kerr (born Bridget Jean Collins; July 10, 1922 – January 5, 2003) was an American author and playwright who authored the 1957 bestseller &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Eat the Daisies&quot; and the plays &quot;King of Hearts&quot; in 1954 and &quot;Mary, Mary&quot; in 1961.

==Early life and education==
Kerr was born on July 10, 1922, in Scranton, Pennsylvania to Irish immigrant parents Tom and Kitty Collins, and grew up on Electric Street in Scranton. She attended Marywood Seminary, the topic of her humorous short story &quot;When I was Queen of the May.&quot; She received a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Marywood College in Scranton and attended The Catholic University of America, where she received her master&#x27;s degree in 1945.

A nun at Marywood persuaded her to drop her first name, because &quot;only Irish washerwomen are named Biddie&quot;.

== Career ==

The Kerrs worked together on several projects, including a 1946 adaptation of the novel, &quot;The Song of Bernadette.&quot; They contributed lyrics and sketches to the musical &quot;Touch and Go&quot;, and co-authored &quot;Goldilocks&quot; (1958), a Broadway musical comedy about the early days of silent film that ran from October 11, 1958, to February 28, 1959, and won two Tony Awards, for Best Actress in a Featured Role (Pat Stanley) and Best Actor in a Featured Role (Russell Nype).

The Kerrs also collaborated on the Tony Award-winning &quot;King of Hearts&quot; (1954), which ran for 279 performances; he directed the play that she co-wrote with Eleanor Brooke. &quot;King of Hearts&quot; was adapted for the screen in 1956 under the title &quot;That Certain Feeling&quot;. The film starred Bob Hope.

Jean Kerr wrote &quot;Jenny Kissed Me&quot;, which was produced in December 1948. She wrote the hit comedy &quot;Mary, Mary,&quot; which ran on Broadway from 1961 through 1964, for more than 1500 performances, and was brought to the screen under the same title in a 1963 film, starring Debbie Reynolds and Barry Nelson, which was a big hit.

She wrote sketches for John Murray Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Almanac&quot;. Her book &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Eat the Daisies&quot; was a big success, and it was made into a feature film in 1960. NBC also produced a 58-episode situation comedy starring Pat Crowley from 1965 to 1967, based on the book She then wrote &quot;The Snake Has All the Lines&quot; in 1960.

Kerr&#x27;s play &quot;Finishing Touches&quot; ran from February to July 1973. Her other works include the plays &quot;Poor Richard&quot; (1964) and &quot;Lunch Hour&quot; (1980). She also wrote the books &quot;Penny Candy&quot; (1970) and &quot;How I Got to Be Perfect&quot; (1978). Her last play, &quot;Lunch Hour&quot;, was staged in 1980, and featured Sam Waterson and Gilda Radner. Kerr was skeptical of casting Radner in the play, but Mike Nichols persuaded her to watch &quot;Gilda Live&quot;, and Kerr was won over by her performance in the film, and she was offered the part.

Kerr was known to author her manuscripts and articles in longhand, and more than often, they were written in the family car, and her husband then typed them. American author Ernest K. Gann wrote in his book &quot;Twilight for the Gods&quot;, that &quot;anyone who reads it [&quot;Please Don&#x27;t Eat the Daisies&quot;], will consider it the most reasonable thing in the world that she prefers to do her writing seated in an automobile and parked two blocks away from her Larchmont, New York, home&quot;.

American cartoonist Dick Hodgins Jr. drew a caricature of Kerr in 1963, which was featured in several newspapers at the time.

==Personal life==
Kerr was married to New York drama critic Walter Kerr; they were married on August 16, 1943. The marriage lasted until his death in 1996. The couple had six children; Christopher, twins Colin and John, Gilbert, Gregory, and Kitty.

The Kerrs bought a house in New Rochelle, New York, and later settled in Larchmont, New York in 1955. Their house in Larchmont was frequently characterized in her writings, and it featured a two-story fireplace, turrets, a medieval courtyard, and a 32 bell carillon which played the duet from the opera &quot;Carmen&quot; at noon everyday. The house was previously owned by Charles King, who test drove Henry Ford&#x27;s first car.

She died of pneumonia in White Plains, New York in 2003.

<text>John Ruthven, 3rd Earl of Gowrie (c. 1577 – 5 August 1600), was a Scottish nobleman who died in mysterious circumstances, referred to as the &quot;Gowrie Conspiracy&quot;, in which he and/or his brother Alexander were attempting to kill or kidnap King James VI of Scotland for unknown purposes. The king&#x27;s retinue killed both brothers during the attack, and the king survived.

==Early life==
John Ruthven was the second son of William Ruthven, 1st Earl of Gowrie, and his wife Dorothea Stewart. His brother James, the 2nd Earl, died in 1586, therefore John succeeded his brother as the Earl of Gowrie while still a child.

The Ruthven family had a history of treason. Like his father and grandfather before him, Ruthven attached himself to the party of the reforming preachers, who procured his election in 1592 as Provost of Perth, a post that was almost hereditary in the Ruthven family. He was educated at the grammar school of Perth and the University of Edinburgh, where he was in the summer of 1593, about the time when his mother, and his sister the Countess of Atholl, aided the Earl of Bothwell in forcing himself, sword in hand, into the king&#x27;s bedchamber in Holyrood Palace.

A few months later Ruthven joined with earls of Atholl and Montrose in offering to serve Queen Elizabeth I of England, then almost openly hostile to the Scottish king; and it is probable that he had also relations with the rebellious Bothwell. He travelled to Italy in 1597 with his tutor, William Rhynd, and they enrolled at the University of Padua in April. On his way home in 1599 he remained for some months at Geneva with the reformer Theodore Beza.

At Paris, he made acquaintance with the English ambassador, Henry Neville, who reported him to Robert Cecil as devoted to Elizabeth&#x27;s service on 27 February 1599. Neville wrote that Ruthven would like to kiss Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s hand, and said the Earl was loyal to the Protestant religion and the English queen. Gowrie would be able to give Cecil useful information regarding potential feared &quot;alterations&quot; in the political state of Scotland. In London he was received very favourably by Queen Elizabeth and her ministers.

In February 1600 he encountered William Stewart of Houston in a long gallery or passage in Holyrood Palace. Stewart had arrested the earl&#x27;s father in 1584. The earl made to move out of Stewart&#x27;s way then reconsidered at the urging of his servant Thomas Kinrosser. Stewart noted this and complained to the king as an offence to his long service and dignity, warning that Gowrie was a threat to the court. Gowrie was told about this, and said &quot;Aquila non captat muscas&quot;, meaning the eagle does not catch flies, that Stewart was beneath his attention.

The &quot;Gowrie conspiracy&quot; resulted in the killing of the earl and his brother by attendants of King James at Gowrie House, Perth. Gowrie House stood just inside Perth&#x27;s town wall, next to the River Tay on the site now occupied by Perth Sheriff Court at the junction of Canal Street and Tay Street.

==Gowrie conspiracy==
The Gowrie conspiracy or Gowrie Plot was a series of events unfolding on 5 August 1600. It is shrouded in mystery. Although the facts of the actual attack and deaths of the Ruthvens are known, the circumstances by which that sequence of events came about remain a mystery.

Ruthven had reason to seek vengeance on James VI as he had executed his father in response to the Ruthven Raid, which in turn was inspired by high debts of the King to the Ruthven family. Getting rid of the family got rid of the debts, especially if the family was stripped of all ownership for reason of &quot;treason&quot;. Rumours circulated that Anne of Denmark was involved in the Gowrie Conspiracy, and it was said that a letter had been found from her to the Earl of Gowrie, urging him to visit the royal court and enclosing the gift of a valuable bracelet.

==Aftermath==
The events at Gowrie House caused intense excitement throughout Scotland. The investigation of the circumstances was also followed with much interest in England where all the details were reported to Elizabeth&#x27;s ministers. The ministers of the Kirk, whose influence in Scotland was too extensive for the king to neglect, were persuaded, but with great difficulty, to accept James&#x27;s account of the occurrence. He voluntarily submitted himself to cross-examination by one of their number.

The ministers&#x27; belief, and that of their partisans, no doubt influenced by political hostility toward James, was that the king had invented the story of a conspiracy by Gowrie to cover his own design to extirpate the Ruthven family. James gave some colour to this belief, which has not been entirely abandoned, by the relentless severity with which he pursued the two younger, and unquestionably innocent, brothers of the earl. A more tangible motive for mutual discontent is to be found in the fact that the king was Gowrie&#x27;s debtor to the extent of no less than £80,000 representing a sum of £48,063 due to his father while treasurer, with the interest at 10% per annum for the succeeding years. With this sum the old Earl of Gowrie, when treasurer, was forced to burden himself in order to meet the current expenses of the government. It was probably his inability to meet the obligations incurred by his father that had compelled the young earl to remain abroad; and on his return he presented a petition to the court of session, stating that he was unfit to pay any more to his creditors than he had done already, and asking to be relieved of these royal debts. In answer to his application he on 20 June 1600 obtained a protection from debt for a year.

Great efforts were made by the government to prove the complicity of others in the plot. One noted and dissolute conspirator, Sir Robert Logan of Restalrig, was posthumously convicted of having been privy to the Gowrie conspiracy on the evidence of certain letters produced by a notary, George Sprot, who swore they had been written by Logan to Gowrie and others. These letters, which are still in existence, were in fact forged by Sprot in imitation of Logan&#x27;s handwriting; but the researches of Andrew Lang have shown cause for suspecting that the most important of them was either copied by Sprot from a genuine original by Logan, or that it embodied the substance of such a letter. If this is correct, it would appear that the conveyance of the king to Fast Castle, Logan&#x27;s impregnable fortress on the coast of Berwickshire, was part of the plot; and it supplies, in all events, an additional piece of evidence to prove the genuineness of the Gowrie conspiracy. Robert Logan died before May 1608 the last of his line; George Sprot was hanged at the Market Cross of Edinburgh for foreknowledge of the conspiracy on 12 August 1608.
On 7 August 1600, James&#x27;s Privy Council of Scotland ordered that the corpses of Gowrie and his brother should remain unburied until further decisions were made over the matter, and that no person with the name of Ruthven should approach within ten miles of the court. Orders were also sent for the apprehension of the earl&#x27;s brothers William and Patrick, but they fled to England. The bodies of Gowrie and his brother Robert were disembowelled and preserved by one James Melville, who, however, was paid for his services, not by the magistrates of Perth, but by the Privy Council; and on 30 October they were sent to Edinburgh to be produced at the bar of Parliament. On 15 November, the estates of the Ruthvens were discerned by Parliament via the (c. 1) to be forfeited and their family name and honours extinct.

The corpses of the Earl and his brother were hanged and quartered at the Mercat Cross in Edinburgh on 19 November 1600. Their heads were put on spikes at Edinburgh&#x27;s Old Tolbooth and their arms and legs upon spikes at various locations around Perth.
Another act, the (c. 2) was further passed abolishing the name of Ruthven, ordering that the house wherein the tragedy happened should be levelled to the ground, and decreeing that the barony of Ruthven should henceforth be known as the barony of Huntingtower. In a letter of November 1600, the Patrick Gray, 6th Lord Gray described the aftermath of the Gowrie Conspiracy. The Ruthven family were ordered to change their surname, and the House of Ruthven near Perth was renamed as Huntingtower. Some suspicion had fallen on Anne of Denmark, and some courtiers would be removed from her household after the birth of her child (Prince Charles). Despite her protests, her enemy, Sir Thomas Erskine, would be made captain of the royal guard.

==Family==
Ruthven&#x27;s two younger brothers, William and Patrick, fled to England.The brothers went to Berwick-upon-Tweed and lived in hiding for a month, until the marshal of the town Sir John Carey helped them travel to Durham and Cambridge.

William Ruthven died in France prior to 1622.

After the 1603 accession of James to the English throne, it was reported that one of the brothers was captured at an inn at Kirkby Malzeard near Ripon, by Francis Wandesford who had seen him three years earlier at Durham. Wandesford delivered him to Sir William Ingleby of Ripley Castle. It was thought that Patrick Ruthven was captured in London in June 1603, but the mayor Robert Lee discovered this was a case of mistaken identity. Later Patrick was captured and imprisoned for nineteen years in the Tower of London. After his release in August 1622, Patrick Ruthven resided first at Cambridge and afterwards in Somersetshire, being granted a small pension by the crown. He married Elizabeth Woodford, widow of Lord Gerrard, by whom he had two sons and a daughter, Mary. The latter entered the service of Queen Henrietta Maria and married the Dutch painter Anthony van Dyck, who painted several portraits of her; after Van Dyck&#x27;s death, she married Sir Richard Pryse, 1st Baronet of Gogerddan. Patrick died in poverty in a cell in the King&#x27;s Bench in 1652, being buried as &quot;Lord Ruthven&quot;. His son, also named Patrick, presented a petition to Oliver Cromwell in 1656, in which, after reciting that the parliament of Scotland in 1641 had restored his father to the barony of Ruthven, he prayed that his &quot;extreme poverty&quot; might be relieved by the bounty of the Protector.

Sisters Barbara and Beatrix were helped by Anne of Denmark, and Barbara Ruthven went to London. Beatrix (died 1625) married John Home of Cowdenknowes; and they were grandparents of James Home, 3rd Earl of Home.

<doc id="1313417" wikidata="Q3308723" url="?curid=1313417" title="James Charles Kopp">
<text>James Charles Kopp (born August 2, 1954) is an American who was convicted in 2003 for the 1998 sniper-style murder of Barnett Slepian, an American OB-GYN physician from Amherst, New York who performed abortions. Prior to his capture, Kopp was on 
the FBI&#x27;s list of Ten Most Wanted Fugitives. On June 7, 1999, he had become the 455th fugitive placed on the list by the FBI. He was affiliated with the militant Roman Catholic anti-abortion group known as The Lambs of Christ.

He has been referred to as a terrorist by the National Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism, and was &quot;well-known in militant anti-abortion circles, where he was nicknamed Atomic Dog&quot;.

==Early life==
James Charles Kopp was born in Pasadena, California and raised Lutheran, but later converted to Roman Catholicism. Kopp graduated from the University of California, Santa Cruz in 1976, with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in biology, going on to take a master&#x27;s degree in embryology from California State University Fullerton. Kopp started providing support to anti-abortion groups after his girlfriend underwent an abortion, and used his technical abilities to create special locks that protesters then used on the doors of abortion clinics.

==Murder==
On October 23, 1998, at approximately 10 p.m., Barnett Slepian was standing in the kitchen of his home in Amherst, New York. Kopp fired a single shot from an SKS semi-automatic rifle from a nearby wooded area, which entered the Slepian home through a rear window. Slepian was a well-known obstetrician/gynecologist who performed abortions at a women&#x27;s clinic in Buffalo, New York. He also maintained a private medical practice in an office in Amherst, New York. Within hours of the murder, anti-abortion militants posted Slepian&#x27;s name crossed out on their internet website, which also served as &quot;a virtual hit list of doctors who carry out abortions&quot;.

==Fugitive==
The FBI believed that Kopp received assistance in fleeing the US, although Irish anti-abortion groups denied they assisted him.

Kopp fled to Mexico under an assumed name and later to Ireland. He then fled Ireland one step ahead of police on a ferry to Brittany, France on March 12, 2001, with two Irish passports besides his original U.S. document.

===Arrest and Extradition===
On March 29, 2001, Kopp was arrested without incident by French law enforcement in the town of Dinan, Brittany, just after picking up a package containing $300 outside of a post office. The United States requested his extradition. Attorney General John Ashcroft promised that the death penalty would not be sought, handed down or applied, a prerequisite according to the extradition treaty between France and the United States. Ashcroft&#x27;s promise was made over the objections of New York State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer and Erie County District Attorney Frank Clark, both of whom wanted the death penalty, though such a sentence is not available in the New York State criminal justice system. Spitzer and Clark argued that the charge of murder was a state charge, not a federal charge, and Ashcroft had no jurisdiction in the matter. The instruction chamber of the Rennes Court of Appeals ruled in favor of extradition. Kopp and his attorney, Herve Rouzaud-Le Bouef, appealed this ruling, stating that the &quot;unsigned embassy letter was &#x27;insufficient&#x27; as a guarantee, prompting Ashcroft&#x27;s unusual direct intervention.

In May 2002, Kopp waived all possible appeals in France and returned to the U.S. in June 2002.

==Trial and conviction==
On March 11, 2003, Kopp waived his right to a jury trial. Based upon an agreement between the defense and prosecution — Erie County Assistant District Attorney Joseph Maruszak and defense attorney Bruce Barkett — Erie County Judge Michael D&#x27;Amico would be required to find Kopp guilty or not guilty based on a single document of facts. In addition, the judge could not consider lesser charges; he had to find Kopp guilty or not guilty of second-degree murder. Kopp had confessed his role in the shooting to police, claiming he only meant to wound Slepian. D&#x27;Amico found him guilty and sentenced him to the maximum penalty, 25 years to life imprisonment, on May 9, 2003. D&#x27;Amico told Kopp &quot;It&#x27;s clear the act is premeditated; there is no doubt about it. You made an attempt to avoid responsibility for the act. What may appear righteous to you is immoral to someone else.&quot; The Appellate Division, Fourth Department, upheld the conviction on July 7, 2006 (Shawn P. Hennessy, attorney for respondent and Timothy Murphy, attorney for appellant). He is currently serving his sentence at Federal Correctional Institution, Mendota, his BOP ID being 11761-055.

==Appeals==
Kopp filed an appeal with the United States District Court for the Western District of New York. Judge Richard Arcara was selected to preside. Arcara limited what Kopp could say on the stand and prohibited the defense from showing pictures of aborted fetuses. There are also limitations to witness&#x27; accounts. If found guilty in federal court, Kopp faced a mandatory life sentence. Kopp was charged with violating the Clinic Entrances Act and using a weapon in the murder of Slepian. Kopp chose to act as his own attorney. On the second day of the federal trial, and during cross examination, Kopp moved to have the court reporter from his previous state trial read back statements pertaining to abortion. Judge Arcara forbade this, holding that under the federal rules of evidence, Kopp was barred from stating anti-abortion, religious or moral reasoning for his actions, which effectively prevented Kopp from giving any rationale for his actions.

Kopp was also charged in the United States District Court for the Western District of New York on a count of violating the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act. Kopp dismissed his court-assigned attorney, an assistant federal public defender, and chose to represent himself. On June 20, 2007, he was sentenced to life imprisonment plus 10 years for illegal use of a firearm. Additionally, the court ordered his belongings auctioned off in order to pay $2.6 million to Slepian&#x27;s family. Arcara told Kopp at the end of the trial:

In his opening statement to the jury, Kopp said that although Slepian&#x27;s death was &quot;a full-bore, 100 percent tragedy&quot; it wasn&#x27;t murder because it was not malicious or premeditated. He did acknowledge that he had planned the shooting for a year, and that he fired a high-powered rifle with telescopic sights, but that he had only meant to wound the doctor (to keep him from performing abortions). Kopp claimed that murder means &quot;Shoot them in the head, blow up a car, riddle their body with bullets like they do in the movies. That&#x27;s how you kill someone.&quot;

On April 6, 2009, The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the life sentence holding that all issues raised were without merit.

==Other possible crimes==
It has been speculated that Kopp has committed other crimes besides killing Slepian. The FBI notes that &quot;the shooting was similar to shootings in the Rochester, New York area, and three Canadian cities during the fall of 1997, in which abortion doctors were shot in their homes&quot;. Kopp has been charged by Canadian authorities in the 1995 shooting of an Ontario, Canada doctor, Hugh Short, one of a string of Remembrance Day Shootings.
Garson Romalis and Jack Fainman were also shot and wounded by unknown assailants. An unnamed Perinton doctor was shot on October 28, 1997, the bullet narrowly missing their head. The doctor&#x27;s name has been withheld by Monroe County police.

==Co-conspirators==
Kopp received help from a sympathetic anti-abortion activist couple, a Vietnam veteran and former stage and film actor Dennis Malvasi and his wife Loretta Marra of Brooklyn, who pleaded guilty to one count each of conspiracy in helping Kopp avoid capture. Marra and Malvasi had communicated extensively with Kopp, telling him also via electronic communications that &quot;the coast is clear&quot;, referring to his proposed secretive return to US via Canada, and also to his use of their home as a safe house. On August 21, 2003, they were sentenced to time served, and released in October that same year. The two fugitive assisters later relocated to Newark, New Jersey and briefly changed their names to Joyce Maier and Ted Barnes.

==Fictional portrayals and media==
The murder of Barnett Slepian inspired an episode of &quot;Law and Order: Criminal Intent&quot;, &quot;The Third Horseman&quot;, in season 1, episode 11.

Singer/songwriter Ani DiFranco wrote and performed the song, &quot;Hello, Birmingham&quot; about Kopp&#x27;s shooting of Dr. Slepian. It is the sixth track on her tenth studio album, &quot;To The Teeth&quot;.

<text>Count Franciszek Maksymilian Ossoliński (2 April 1676 – 1 July 1756) was a Polish nobleman, politician, diplomat and a patron of arts.

== Biography ==
Son of Łowczy and Chorąży Maksymilian Ossoliński and Teodora Krassowska. He was married in 1706 to Katarzyna Miączyńska and in 1732, in Lwów, married Katarzyna Jabłonowska, the daughter of Grand Chancellor Stanisław Jan Jabłonowski.

He was of Drohiczyn from 1703 to 1710, Court Treasurer in 1713, Grand Treasurer of the Crown from 1729 to 1736, (&#x27;governor&#x27;) of Kraków, (salt-pit manager) of salt-pits in Bochnia and Wieliczka in 1727. He was (a crown district administrator) of Sandomierz, Nur, Ostrów, Drohiczyn, Chmielnik and Niepołomice.

His political and military career began at the end of the 17th century under patronage of Stanisław Antoni Szczuka. He was private secretary to Augustus II and one of his closest co-workers. He was a strong supporter of giving more power to the King. His policy as Grand Treasurer, induced an increase in income from customs duties.

He was a frequent deputy to the Sejm from 1718. As Sejm Marshal of the ordinary Sejm in Warsaw, from 5 May to 16 November 1722, he warned that broken sessions of the Sejm could lead to the downfall and the end of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

In 1733 he signed the election of Stanisław I as King of Poland and commanded armed forces in the defence of the monarch. After the capitulation of Gdańsk in 1734 he was captured by the Russian army.

He refused to submit to King Augustus III and after 1736 he stayed at the court of Stanisław I Leszczyński in the Palace of Lunéville in Lorraine. He died at the Château de la Malgrange.

<doc id="1313432" wikidata="Q40735" url="?curid=1313432" title="Origin (mathematics)">
<text>In mathematics, the origin of a Euclidean space is a special point, usually denoted by the letter &quot;O&quot;, used as a fixed point of reference for the geometry of the surrounding space.

In physical problems, the choice of origin is often arbitrary, meaning any choice of origin will ultimately give the same answer. This allows one to pick an origin point that makes the mathematics as simple as possible, often by taking advantage of some kind of geometric symmetry.

==Cartesian coordinates==
In a Cartesian coordinate system, the origin is the point where the axes of the system intersect. The origin divides each of these axes into two halves, a positive and a negative semiaxis. Points can then be located with reference to the origin by giving their numerical coordinates—that is, the positions of their projections along each axis, either in the positive or negative direction. The coordinates of the origin are always all zero, for example (0,0) in two dimensions and (0,0,0) in three.

==Other coordinate systems==
In a polar coordinate system, the origin may also be called the pole. It does not itself have well-defined polar coordinates, because the polar coordinates of a point include the angle made by the positive &quot;x&quot;-axis and the ray from the origin to the point, and this ray is not well-defined for the origin itself.

In Euclidean geometry, the origin may be chosen freely as any convenient point of reference.

The origin of the complex plane can be referred as the point where real axis and imaginary axis intersect each other. In other words, it is the complex number zero.

*Distance from a point to a plane
*Pointed space, a topological space with a distinguished point
*Radial basis function, a function depending only on the distance from the origin

<text>Patrick Fraser Tytler FRSE FSA (Scot) (30 August 179124 December 1849) was a Scottish advocate and historian. He was described as the &quot;Episcopalian historian of a Presbyterian country&quot;.

==Life==

The son of Alexander Fraser Tytler, Lord Woodhouselee, he was born in a house on George Street in Edinburgh&#x27;s New Town. He was named after his paternal uncle, Col Patrick Tytler. He was educated at the Edinburgh High School.

He was admitted to the Faculty of Advocates in Edinburgh in 1813; in 1816 he became King&#x27;s counsel in the Exchequer, and practised as an advocate until 1832. At this time he was living at 36 Melville Street, a large terraced townhouse in Edinburgh&#x27;s west end.

He then moved to London, and it was largely owing to his efforts that a scheme for publishing state papers was carried out. Tytler was one of the founders of the Bannatyne Club and of the English Historical Society.

He died at Great Malvern on 24 December 1849. His body was returned to Edinburgh for burial in the family vault, which lies within the sealed south-west section of Greyfriars Kirkyard known as the Covenanter&#x27;s Prison.

His biography (1859) was written by his friend John William Burgon.

==Family==
Tytler first married Rachel Elisabeth Hog (sister of James Maitland Hog FRSE) on 30 March 1826 at Newliston and together they had 3 children, including Mary Stewart Fraser Tytler (1827–1887) who is buried in Grange Cemetery rather than in the family vault. Rachel died on 15 April 1835.

He then married on either 12 or 22 August 1845, in Richmond, his cousin, Anastasia Bonar, daughter of Thomson Bonar (1780–1828) of Campden, Kent, by his spouse Anastasia Jessie Gascoigne, widow of Charles Gascoigne, daughter of Matthew Guthrie of Halkerton.

==Works==
Tytler is most noted for his literary output. He contributed to Archibald Alison&#x27;s &quot;Travels in France&quot; (1815); his first independent essays were papers in &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. His major work, the &quot;History of Scotland&quot; (1828–1843), covered the period between 1249 and 1603. A second edition was published in 1841–1843. The seventh volume deals with the reign of Mary, Queen of Scots after her marriage with Darnley.

His other works include:

*contributions to George Thomson&#x27;s &quot;Select Melodies of Scotland&quot; (1824)
*&quot;Life of James Crichton of Cluny, commonly called the Admirable Crichton&quot; (1819; 2nd ed., 1823)

<doc id="1313441" wikidata="Q336471" url="?curid=1313441" title="Qutuz">
<text>Sayf al-Din Qutuz (; died 24 October 1260), also romanized as Kutuz or Kotuz and fully al-Malik al-Muẓaffar Sayf ad-Dīn Quṭuz ( ), was the Mamluk Sultan of Egypt. He reigned as Sultan for less than a year, from 1259 until his assassination in 1260, but served as the &quot;de facto&quot; ruler for two decades.

Sold into slavery in Egypt, he rose to become vice-sultan for more than 20 years, becoming the power behind the throne. He was prominent in defeating the Seventh Crusade, which invaded Egypt in 1249–1250. When Egypt was threatened by the Mongols in 1259, he took control of the military and deposed the reigning sultan, 15-year-old Sultan Al-Mansur Ali. The Mongols conquered the centers of Islamic power in Syria and Baghdad, and the center of the Islamic Empire moved to Egypt, which became their next target. Qutuz led an Egyptian Mamluk army north to confront the Mongols, who had made a pact with Egypt&#x27;s long-time enemy, the Crusaders.

The Battle of Ain Jalut was fought on 3 September 1260 in southeastern Galilee between the Egyptian Mamluk army and the Mongols. In what has been considered a historical turning point, the Mongols were crushingly defeated by Qutuz&#x27;s forces. Qutuz was assassinated by a fellow Mamluk leader, Baibars, on the triumphant return journey to Cairo. Although Qutuz&#x27;s reign was short, he is one of the most popular Mamluk sultans in the Islamic world and holds a high position in Islamic history. His name Qutuz means &#x27;Vicious beast&#x27;. He received this name because he fought like a vicious beast against other slave children.

==Background==

Qutuz was a Turkic prince from Persia, captured by the Mongols during the fall of the Khwarazmian dynasty , he was taken to Damascus where he was sold to an Egyptian slave merchant who then sold him to Aybak, the Mamluk sultan in Cairo. According to some sources, Qutuz claimed that he was descended from Ala ad-Din Muhammad II, a ruler of the Khwarazmian Empire.
He became the most prominent Mu&#x27;izi Mamluk of Sultan Aybak, and then became his vice-sultan in 1253. Aybak was assassinated in 1257, and Qutuz remained as vice-sultan for Aybak&#x27;s son al-Mansur Ali. Qutuz led the Mu&#x27;izi Mamluks who had arrested Aybak&#x27;s widow Shajar al-Durr and installed al-Mansur Ali as the new sultan of Egypt. In November 1257 and April 1258, he defeated raids from the forces of al-Malik al-Mughith of Al-Karak which were supported by the Bahriyya Mamluks. The raids caused a dispute among the Bahriyya Mamluks in Al-Karak as some of them wanted to support their followers in Egypt.

In February 1258, the Mongol army sacked Baghdad, massacred its inhabitants, and killed the Abbasid Caliph Al-Musta&#x27;sim. They then advanced towards present-day Syria, which was then ruled by the Ayyubid ruler an-Nasir Yusuf, who received a threatening letter from Hulagu. Vice-Sultan Qutuz and the Egyptian Emirs were alarmed by a message from an-Nasir Yusuf in which he appealed for immediate help from Egypt. The emirs assembled at the court of the 15-year-old Sultan Al-Mansur Ali, and Qutuz told them that because of the seriousness of the situation, Egypt should have a strong and capable sultan who could fight the Mongols. On 12 November 1259, Al-Mansur Ali was deposed by Qutuz. When Qutuz became the new sultan, he promised the emirs that they could install any other sultan after he defeated the Mongols.

Qutuz kept Emir Faris ad-Din Aktai al-Mostareb as the Atabeg of the Egyptian army and began to prepare for battle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shayyal, p.122/vol.2&quot;&gt;Shayyal, p. 122/vol. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mongol threat==
Hulagu and his forces were proceeding towards Damascus. Some Syrian emirs suggested that an-Nasir Yusuf surrender and submit to Hulagu, as the best solution was to save themselves and Syria. Baibars, who was present at the meeting, was upset by the suggestion, and the Mamluks decided to kill an-Nasir Yusuf that night. However, he escaped with his brother to the citadel of Damascus. Baibars and the Mamluks then left Syria, traveling to Egypt where they were warmly welcomed by Sultan Qutuz, who granted Baibars the town of Qalyub.&lt;ref name=&quot;Al-Maqrizi, p. 509/vol. 1&quot;&gt;Al-Maqrizi, p. 509/vol. 1&lt;/ref&gt; When an-Nasir Yusuf heard that the Mongol army was approaching Aleppo, he sent his wife, his son, and his money to Egypt. The population of Damascus and other Syrian towns began to flee. After besieging Aleppo for seven days, the Mongols sacked it and massacred its population. When an-Nasir Yusuf heard about the fall of Aleppo, he fled to Egypt, leaving Damascus and its remaining population defenseless, but Qutuz denied him entry. An-Nasir Yusuf thus stayed on the border of Egypt while his emirs deserted him and proceeded into the country. Sultan Qutuz ordered the seizing of an-Nasir Yusuf&#x27;s jewelry and money, which were sent to Egypt with his wife and servants. Sixteen days after the fall of Aleppo to the Mongols, Damascus surrendered without a fight. An-Nasir Yusuf was taken prisoner by the Mamluks and sent to Hulagu.

With the centers of Islamic power in Syria and Baghdad conquered, the center of the Islamic power transferred to Egypt and became Hulagu&#x27;s next target. Hulagu sent messengers to Cairo with a threatening letter, urging Qutuz to surrender and submit to the Mongols. Qutuz&#x27;s response was to execute the messengers. They were sliced in half, and their heads were mounted on the Bab Zuweila gate in Cairo. Then, rather than waiting for the Mongols to attack, Qutuz decided to raise an army to engage them outside of Egypt.&lt;ref name=&quot;Al-Maqrizi, p. 515/vol. 1&quot;&gt;Al-Maqrizi, p. 515/vol. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Moroccans who resided in Egypt fled westward, while Yemenis escaped to Yemen and Hejaz.

Qutuz went to Al-Salihiyya and assembled his commanders to decide on when to march against the Mongols. But the emirs showed timidity. Qutuz shamed them into joining him with the statement, &quot;Emirs of the Muslims, for some time now you have been fed by the country treasury and you hate to be invaded. I will go alone and who likes to join me should do that and who does not like to join me should go back home, but who will not join will carry the sin of not defending our women.&quot;

Qutuz ordered Baibars to lead a force to Gaza to observe the small Mongol garrison there, which Baibars easily defeated. After spending a day in Gaza, Qutuz led his army along the coast towards Acre, a city that remains a remnant of the Kingdom of Jerusalem Crusader state. The Crusaders were traditional enemies of the Mamluks and had been approached by the Mongols about forming a Franco-Mongol alliance. However, the Crusaders recognized the Mongols as the greater threat that year. Qutuz suggested a military alliance with the Crusaders against the Mongols, but the Crusaders opted to stay neutral. However, they allowed Qutuz and his forces to travel unmolested through Crusader territory and to camp and resupply near the Crusader stronghold of Acre. Qutuz and his army stayed there for three days until they heard that the Mongols had crossed the Jordan River, at which point Qutuz and Baibars led their forces to meet the Mongols at Ain Jalut.&lt;ref name=&quot;Al-Maqrizi,p.516/vol.1&quot;&gt;Al-Maqrizi, p. 516/vol. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Battle of Ain Jalut==
The Battle of Ain Jalut was fought on 3 September 1260, and was one of the most important battles and a turning point in history. In 1250, only ten years before the battle, the Bahariyya Mamluks (Qutuz, Baibars, and Qalawun) led Egypt against the Seventh Crusade of King Louis IX of France. The Mongol army at Ain Jalut was led by Kitbuqa, a Nestorian Christian Naiman Mongol, and accompanied by the Christian king of Cilician Armenia and also by the Christian prince of Antioch. After the fall of Khawarezm, Baghdad and Syria, Egypt was the last citadel of Islam in the Middle East, and the existence of crusade beach-heads along the coast of the Levant presented a serious menace to the Islamic world. Therefore, the future of Islam and the Christian west as well depended on the outcome of that battle.

Baibars, known to be a swift commander, led the vanguard and succeeded in his maneuver and lured the Mongol army to Ain Jalut, where the Egyptian army led by Qutuz waited. The Egyptians at first failed to counter the Mongol attack and were scattered after the left flank of their army suffered severe damage, but Qutuz stood firm; he threw his helmet into the air and shouted &quot;O Islam&quot;, and advanced towards the damaged side, followed by his unit.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shayyal, p. 123/vol.2&quot;&gt;Shayyal, p. 123/vol. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The Mongols were pushed back and fled to the vicinity of Beisan, Qutuz&#x27;s forces quickly followed them, but they managed to gather and returned to the battlefield making a successful counterattack. Qutuz cried loudly three times, &quot;O Islam! O God grant your servant Qutuz a victory against the Mongols&quot;. The Mongols with their Christian allies were then defeated by Qutuz&#x27;s army and fled to Syria where they became prey for the local population. Qutuz kissed the ground and prayed while the soldiers collected the booty. Kitbuqa, the Commander of the Mongol army, was killed, and his head was sent to Cairo.

This was the first defeat suffered by the Mongols since they attacked the Islamic world. They fled from Damascus, then from the whole of the northern Levant. Qutuz entered Damascus with his army and sent Baibars to Homs to liquidate the remaining Mongols. While Qutuz nominated Alam ad-Din Sonjar as the sultan&#x27;s deputy in Damascus, Qutuz granted Aleppo to al-Malik al-Said Ala&#x27;a ad-Din as the Emir of Mosul; also a new Abbasid Caliph was about to be installed by Qutuz. The Levant region from the border of Egypt to the river Euphrates was freed from the Mongols&#x27; control. After this victory, the Mamluks stretched their sovereignty to the Levant and were recognized by the Ayyubids and the others as legitimate rulers. When Hulagu heard about the defeat of the Mongol Army, he executed An-Nasir Yusuf near Tabriz. Hulagu kept threatening the Mamluk Sultanate, but soon he was struck hard by conflicts with the Mongols of the Golden Horde, in the western half of the Eurasian Steppe during the Berke–Hulagu war. Hulagu died in 1265 and would never avenge the defeat of the Mongols at Ain Jalut.

Some of the earliest explosive hand cannons (&quot;midfa&quot; in Arabic) were employed by the Mamluk Egyptians during the battle to frighten the Mongol horses and cavalry and cause disorder in their ranks. The Mamluks under Qutuz then went on to take back all of Iraq and Syria. The last city the Mamluks retook before his assassination was the grand city of Baghdad.

==Assassination==
On his way back to Cairo, Qutuz was assassinated while on a hunting expedition in Salihiyah.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shayyal, p.126/vol.2&quot;&gt;Shayyal, p. 126/vol. 2&lt;/ref&gt; According to both modern and medieval Muslim historians such as al-Maqrizi, Baibars was involved in the assassination. Al-Maqrizi further explains that the emirs who struck down Qutuz were Emir Badr ad-Din Baktut, Emir Ons, and Emir Bahadir al-Mu&#x27;izzi. Western historians mention that Baibars was in on the conspiracy and assign him direct responsibility. Muslim chroniclers from the Mamluk era stated that Baibars&#x27; motivation was either to avenge the killing of his friend, the leader of the Bahariyya Faris ad-Din Aktai during Sultan Aybak&#x27;s reign or due to Qutuz&#x27;s decision to grant Aleppo to al-Malik al-Said Ala&#x27;a ad-Din the Emir of Mosul, instead of to Baibars as had promised to him before the Battle of Ain Jalut.

Qutuz was first buried in Al-Qusair and then reburied in a cemetery in Cairo, Egypt. Baibars returned to Cairo, which was undergoing celebrations on the victory over the Mongols, where he became the new sultan. The people at once admired Baibars as he revoked the war taxes that Qutuz had imposed.

==Coins==

The coins during the reign of Qutuz are unique in the history of Mamluk coinages as no other names except his names and titles were inscribed on them: &quot;al-Malik al-Muzafar Saif al-Donya wa al-Din&quot; (&quot;The victorious king, sword of the temporal world and of the faith&quot;) and &quot;al-Muzafar Saif al-Din&quot; (&quot;The victorious sword of faith&quot;).

<text>Gowling Lafleur Henderson LLP (Gowlings) was a Canadian and international law firm, with about 700 legal professionals in 10 offices in Canada, as well as in London, Moscow, and Beijing. The firm offered legal support in business law, advocacy/litigation and intellectual property law.

On July 8, 2015, Gowlings announced that they would amalgamate with UK firm Wragge Lawrence Graham &amp; Co to create a new international law firm called Gowling WLG. The new firm launched in February 2016.

==History==
Gowlings&#x27; originated with the firm Henderson &amp; McVeity, which was founded in Ottawa in 1887. Its name passed through numerous permutations, but included references to the lawyers Gordon Gowling, George and Gordon Henderson. In the 1980s, the firm expanded beyond its traditional Ottawa base, establishing offices in Toronto, Kitchener, and Moscow.

Starting in the mid-1990s, Gowlings created a national platform through a succession of mergers with other law firms in Vancouver, Hamilton, Calgary, Montreal and Toronto. The firm eventually adopted the simple brand name &quot;Gowlings&quot; (which had long been in informal use).

== Notable firm members ==

*Leonard Walter Brockington (1888–1966). Founding chairman of the CBC, 1936-1939
*Gordon F. Henderson (1912–1993). President of the Canadian Bar Association, 1979–1980; Chancellor of the University of Ottawa, 1991–1993
*Roy McMurtry (1932– ). Attorney-General of Ontario, 1975–1985 and Chief Justice of Ontario, 1996-2007
*Ray Hnatyshyn (1934–2002). 24th Governor-General of Canada, 1990–1995

<text>Postdiction involves explanation after the fact.
In skepticism, it is considered an effect of hindsight bias that explains claimed predictions of significant events such as plane crashes and natural disasters. In religious contexts, theologians frequently refer to postdiction using the Latin term &quot;vaticinium ex eventu&quot; (foretelling after the event). Through this term, skeptics postulate that many biblical prophecies (and similar prophecies in other religions) appearing to have come true may have been written after the events supposedly predicted, or that the text or interpretation may have been modified after the event to fit the facts as they occurred.

Skeptics of use these terms in response to claims made by psychics, astrologers and other paranormalists to have predicted an event, when the original prediction was vague, catch-all, or otherwise non-obvious.

Most predictions from such figures as Nostradamus and James Van Praagh express the future with such seemingly deliberate vagueness and ambiguity as to make interpretation nearly impossible before the event, rendering them useless as predictive tools. After the event has occurred, however, the psychics or their supporters shoehorn details into the prediction by using selective thinking—emphasizing the &quot;hits&quot;, ignoring the &quot;misses&quot;—in order to lend credence to the prophecy and to give the impression of an accurate &quot;prediction&quot;. Inaccurate predictions are omitted.

Supporters of a prediction sometimes contend that the problem lies not with the wording of the prediction, but with the interpretation—an argument sometimes used by supporters of religious texts. This argument may lead to the question: &quot;What is the point of a prediction that cannot be interpreted correctly before the event?&quot; However, the argument is not that the prediction &quot;could not have been&quot; interpreted correctly prior to the event, but simply that &quot;it was not&quot; in the case in question, thus the question is working from a false premise. Of course, any &quot;prediction&quot; that is so vague as to not be correctly interpreted before the event it allegedly &quot;predicted&quot; is functionally equivalent to no prediction at all.

==Etymology==

The term derives from the Latin suffix post- (after) and prefix -dictio, in the same way as &quot;prediction&quot; uses the prefix &quot;pre-&quot; (before).

==Postdiction in different contexts==

===Skepticism===
In skepticism, postdiction is also referred to as post-shadowing, retroactive clairvoyance, or prediction after the fact, and is an effect of hindsight bias that explains claimed predictions of significant events, such as plane crashes and natural disasters. Accusations of postdiction might be applicable if the prediction were:

;Vague: The prediction makes a non-specific claim. For example, it predicts a &quot;disaster&quot; of some kind, but not &quot;what&quot; it is. Such a prediction can be massaged to fit any number of events. Likewise, a prediction that does not state dates or places, or allows itself a large &quot;window&quot; of possible dates, can be made to fit many possibilities. A prophecy attributed to Saint Malachy (but widely regarded as a 16th-century forgery) claims to predict the succession of Popes by describing each one briefly. However, each description is sufficiently vague that it can be massaged to fit after the fact.
;Open ended: The prediction has a very long cut-off date or none at all, and therefore runs indefinitely. Many of Nostradamus&#x27; quatrains are open-ended and have been postdicted over the centuries to fit various contemporary events.
;Recycled: The prediction is reused again and again in order to match the most recent event. Nostradamus&#x27; quatrains have been recycled numerous times.
;Catch-all: The prediction covers more than one possible outcome. For example, the Delphic Oracle&#x27;s answer as to whether Croesus should attack the Persians: &quot;If you attack, you will destroy a mighty empire&quot;. Croesus attacked, destroying his own empire.
;Shotgunning: The prediction is in fact many predictions, designed to cover a range of events and claim credit even if only one of them happens. For example, claiming that a particular date is &quot;unlucky&quot; and then citing a dozen or so things that might happen on it. See selective thinking.
;Statistically likely: The prediction makes a claim for something that happens with enough frequency that a high hit rate is virtually assured. For example, predicting terrorism on any day of the year, or particularly around national holidays, anniversaries (or similar events), or religious festivals.
;Unfalsifiable: The prediction makes a claim that is impossible to verify or falsify. For example, a belief arose amongst a few in 2003 that a Planet X would pass the Earth in May of that year. When it singularly failed to appear, some claimed it was shrouded so that only an &quot;educated eye&quot; could see it and various other excuses, while discounting the most obvious reason—that Planet X does not exist at all in the form predicted.
;Unavailable until after the fact: A prediction cannot be verified if there is no public record of when it was made. A famous example was the psychic Tamara Rand, who predicted that Ronald Reagan was in danger of someone with the initials &quot;J.H.&quot;. The video interview in which this prediction was made was shot the day &quot;after&quot; the assassination attempt.
;Counting the hits and not the misses: The prediction may be part of a series, but is singled out because it can be favourably interpreted, even if the series itself follows the laws of probability. For example, the prediction might correctly state movement on the stock market when previous or subsequent predictions have been wrong.
;Allegory: The postdiction resorts to tenuous allegorical explanations to turn literal misses into hits. For example, the postdiction might explain that a famous person has suffered a &quot;spiritual&quot; death to explain why they are still walking around despite a prediction that says otherwise.
;Moving the goalposts: The event must be &quot;shoehorned&quot; to fit the prediction because it differs in some significant way. For example, the prediction predicts an earthquake on one day, when in fact it happens on a different day. Nostradamus&#x27; supporters occasionally use this technique, like the September 11 terrorist attacks on the 45th parallel(actually around 40 degrees latitude).

These types are not exclusive, so a prediction could be vague, statistically likely and open-ended at the same time.

===Cognitive science===
In cognitive science, postdiction is the justification process that allows a reader to make sense of a concept in a given context. The term was coined by psychologist Walter Kintsch in 1980 and refined by cognitive scientist Afzal Upal in 2005. Heath &amp; Heath used Upal&#x27;s definition without explicitly citing him in their 2007 book &quot;Made to Stick&quot;. Concepts that can be justified in a given context are called postdictable.

===Neuroscience===
In neuroscience, postdiction indicates that the brain collects up information after an event before it retrospectively decides what happened at the time of the event (Eagleman and Sejnowski, 2000). Postdiction is a particular interpretation of experimental results showing temporal integration of information, and it has been largely debated. 

The duration of the window of temporal integration of sensory information ranges between tens to hundreds of milliseconds. Its duration significantly varies across tasks, so there may be several postdictive windows of integration, and they are consistent across subjects. The duration of the postdictive windows of integration is supposedly hardwired in our brain, but it could be extended by training subjects to systematic delays between causally bounded events. The postdictive window is believed to be triggered by highly salient sensory events acting as &quot;resets&quot;, such as abrupt stimuli onset and saccadic eye movements.

Postdiction is argued to play a central role in shaping our sense of agency, by compressing the perceived interval between a voluntary action and its external sensory consequence.

Postdictive mechanisms are believed to constantly underlie our perception, and can be revealed by some perceptual illusions: for example, in the flash lag illusion and the cutaneous rabbit illusion the location of moving stimuli are mistakenly perceived due to their falling within the same postdictive window of integration.

<text>Robert Shane Kimbrough (born June 4, 1967) is a retired United States Army officer and NASA astronaut. He was part of the first group of candidates selected for NASA astronaut training following the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster. Kimbrough is a veteran of three spaceflights, the first being a Space Shuttle flight, and the second being a six-month mission to the ISS on board a Russian Soyuz craft. He was the commander of the International Space Station for Expedition 50, and returned to Earth in April 2017. He is married to the former Robbie Lynn Nickels.

==Early life==
Born June 4, 1967, in Killeen, Texas, Kimbrough attended The Lovett School in Atlanta, Georgia, graduating in 1985. Kimbrough graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1989 with a B.S. in aerospace engineering. He played for the West Point baseball team for 4 years, and was selected as team captain his senior year.

==Military career==
Kimbrough served as an Apache helicopter pilot in the first Gulf War, Operation Desert Storm in 1991. Kimbrough later attended and graduated from Georgia Tech with a M.S. in operations research in 1998. In 2000, he joined NASA and was assigned as a Flight Simulation Engineer on the Shuttle Training Aircraft where he helped NASA train astronauts on landing procedures for several years before he himself was selected for training in 2004.

He retired from the U.S. Army with the rank of colonel.

==NASA career==

===STS-126===
Kimbrough was a mission specialist on STS-126, which launched on November 14, 2008. During the mission, Kimbrough performed two EVAs.
On the tenth anniversary of the International Space Station, Stefanyshyn-Piper and Kimbrough successfully conducted the mission&#x27;s second EVA, and Kimbrough&#x27;s first, which lasted 6 hours, 45 minutes. 
Kimbrough&#x27;s second EVA was performed on November 24, 2008, and lasted 6 hours and 7 minutes. At the completion of the mission, Kimbrough&#x27;s cumulative spacewalk time, was 12 hours, 52 minutes.

===Expedition 49/50===

Kimbrough launched onboard Soyuz MS-02 to the International Space Station on October 19, 2016, as part of a four-month mission for Expedition 49 /50. Kimbrough became commander of Expedition 50 upon the departure of Soyuz MS-01 on October 28.

On January 6, 2017, Kimbrough performed his third EVA, along with Peggy Whitson. During the EVA, they installed three new adapter plates and hooked up electrical connectors preparing the way to replace the ISS batteries. The EVA lasted 6 hours and 32 minutes.

Kimbrough performed his fourth EVA with astronaut Thomas Pesquet on January 13, 2017. During the EVA, they prepared the infrastructure to replace the ISS batteries. The EVA lasted for 5 hours and 58 minutes.

On March 23, 2017, Kimbrough performed his fifth EVA with Thomas Pesquet. The main objective was to prepare the Pressurized Mating Adapter-3 (PMA-3) for installation of the second International Docking Adapter (IDA), which will accommodate commercial crew vehicle dockings. The EVA lasted for 6 hours and 34 minutes.

On March 30, 2017, Kimbrough performed his sixth EVA with Peggy Whitson. During the EVA they connected the PMA-3 as well as installing new shields in Node 3 axial shields after losing one shield. Additionally installed another upgraded computer relay boxes on the station&#x27;s truss. The EVA lasted 7 hours and 4 minutes. During this EVA Whitson became the record holder for the most EVAs for a woman (8 EVAs).

Kimbrough carried a soccer ball recovered from the wreckage of the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; to the ISS, after which it was returned to the family of &quot;Challenger&quot; astronaut Ellison Onizuka and put on display at Clear Lake High School in Houston.

===Expedition 65/66===
In July 2020, NASA announced that Kimbrough would fly to space for the third time as commander of SpaceX Crew-2 along with NASA astronaut Megan McArthur, JAXA astronaut Akihiko Hoshide, and ESA astronaut Thomas Pesquet. Crew-2 launched and docked with the ISS on April 24, 2021, beginning their 6 month mission.

During his stay on the ISS, he performed 3 EVAs to install the iROSA solar arrays on the P6 Truss, with Thomas Pesquet. Some of the experiments he did included earth observations, protein crystal growth and cultivating cotton and peppers.

Crew-2 splashed down off the coast of Florida on November 9, 2021, after a 199 days mission.

=== Retirement ===
Kimbrough retired from NASA on July 31, 2022.

<doc id="1313457" wikidata="Q7437682" url="?curid=1313457" title="Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service">
<text>The Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service (SCTS) () is an independent public body which is responsible for the administration of the courts and tribunals of Scotland. The Service is led by a board which is chaired by the Lord President of the Court of Session, and employs over 1000 staff members in the country&#x27;s 39 sheriff courts, 34 justice of the peace courts, the Court of Session and the High Court of Justiciary, and at the service&#x27;s headquarters in Edinburgh. The day-to-day administration of the service is the responsibility of its chief executive and executive directors. The Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service is also responsible for providing administrative services for the Judicial Office for Scotland, the Office of the Public Guardian, the Accountant of Court, the Criminal Courts Rules Council, and the Scottish Civil Justice Council.

==History==
The Service was first established as the &quot;Scottish Courts Administration&quot; in 1995, as an executive agency of the Scottish Office. It was later renamed &quot;Scottish Court Service.&quot; In 1999, the Service became an agency of the Scottish Government after responsibility of the courts and judiciary of Scotland were transferred under devolution. In common with the Scottish Prison Service in the Scottish justice system, this &quot;arm&#x27;s length approach&quot; was adopted to prevent direct ministerial involvement in the administration of justice.

On 1 April 2010 it was re-established by section 60 of the Judiciary and Courts (Scotland) Act 2008 as an independent body corporate governed by a Corporate Board and chaired by the Lord President, the head of the Scottish judiciary.

On 1 April 2015, under the Courts Reform (Scotland) Act 2014, the Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service assumed the responsibilities of the former Scottish Court Service and Scottish Tribunals Service.

Security and maintenance of SCTS buildings are provided by Servest who are a company that provides multi functions in building management.

On 3 April 2018, the Glasgow Tribunals Centre opened to the public. The building houses all Tribunal teams based in Glasgow alongside Glasgow based teams of Her Majesty&#x27;s Courts and Tribunals Service. The building also contains bespoke hearing suites for Her Majesty&#x27;s Courts and Tribunals Service and The Scottish Courts and Tribunal Service.

==Functions==
The Criminal Proceedings etc. (Reform) (Scotland) Act 2007 resulted in the unification of the administration of the Court of Session, the High Court of Justiciary, Sheriff and Justice of the Peace courts. The Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service has the function of providing, or ensuring the provision of, the property, services, officers and other staff required for the purposes of all these courts (by virtue of section 61(1) of the 2008 Act).

It has the responsibility of assisting the Scottish judiciary (by virtue of section 61(1)(b) of the 2008 Act), and assists the Lord President in his role as head of the Scottish judiciary (section 62 of the 2008 Act). This is coupled with assisting the Criminal Courts Rules Council and the Scottish Civil Justice Council.

The Service is also responsible for the administration of the Office of the Public Guardian, based in Falkirk, and assists the Accountant of Court (sections 62 and 33 of the 2008 Act).

Another consequence of the Act was the introduction of &quot;Fines Enforcement Officers&quot;. With effect from 10 March 2008 these officers, staff of SCS, will bring a more proactive approach to fines enforcement. A total of 31 members of staff will have responsibility for making sure that fines are paid on time and if offenders fall into arrears with payment those staff will use a variety of means to secure payment. Special measures that may be used will include deductions from state benefits; arrestment of wages and/or funds contained in bank accounts and seizure (and subsequent sale) of vehicles. In cases where it becomes apparent that the offender genuinely cannot pay they will be provided with contact details for other Agencies that will be able to provide guidance and help in organising the offender&#x27;s finances.

==Leadership and administration==
===Board===
The membership of the corporate Board of the Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service is determined by Schedule 3 of the Judiciary and Courts (Scotland) Act 2008, which stipulates that the following are members, &quot;ex officio&quot;:
* Lord President (&quot;judicial member&quot;)
* Lord Justice Clerk (&quot;judicial member&quot;)
* President of the Scottish Tribunals (&quot;judicial member&quot;)
* Chief Executive of the Service
There are a further 5 judicial members, appointed by the Lord President to a maximum term of 4 years:
* One sheriff principal
* Two sheriffs
* One justice of the peace
* One Chamber President in the First-tier Tribunal for Scotland
There are then 2 members of the legal profession, and 3 members from outside the legal system:
* One Advocate
* One Law Society of Scotland
* Three lay members.

The first Scottish Court Service Board was appointed by the Lord President on 18 December 2009 and comprises a majority of judicial officeholders and legal practitioners, by virtue of Schedule 3 to the 2008 Act. The Board formally took up responsibility on 1 April 2010 and is responsible for developing the strategic direction and operational efficiency of the Service.
In September 2012, the Board put forward a document for &quot;consultation&quot; that, if approved, would render it in breach of its statutory duty as covered by Section 61(2) of the Judiciary and Courts (Scotland) Act 2008.

The response of the Scottish ministers is awaited.

===Members of the Board===
As of 23 April 2017 the members of the Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service Board were:

Gould was the son of Richard Davie Gould (c. 1816-1900), a Barnstaple architect, and his wife Judith Carruthers (née Ford). Although in early youth he showed great love of drawing, he began life in a bank and then joined the London Stock Exchange, where he constantly sketched the members and illustrated important events in the financial world; many of these drawings were reproduced by lithography and published for private circulation. In 1879 he began the regular illustration of the Christmas numbers of &quot;Truth&quot;, and in 1887 he became a contributor to the &quot;Pall Mall Gazette&quot;, transferring his allegiance to the &quot;Westminster Gazette&quot; on its foundation and subsequently acting as assistant editor.

Among his independent publications are &quot;Who killed Cock Robin?&quot; (1897), &quot;Tales told in the Zoo&quot; (1900), two volumes of &quot;Froissart&#x27;s Modern Chronicles&quot; (1902 and 1903), and &quot;Picture Politics&quot; — a periodical reprint of his &quot;Westminster Gazette&quot; cartoons, one of the most noteworthy implements of political warfare in the armoury of the Liberal Party. With Sir Wilfrid Lawson he published &quot;Cartoons in Rhyme and Line&quot; (1905).

Frequently grafting his ideas onto subjects taken freely from &quot;Uncle Remus&quot;, &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;, and the works of Dickens and Shakespeare, Gould used these literary vehicles with extraordinary dexterity and satire. He was knighted in 1906. Unpublished manuscripts and biographical material are in the House of Commons Library historical collections, kept in the House of Lords Record Office.

Carruthers Gould was responsible for designing eleven (11) Toby jugs of World War I political and military figures between 1915 and 1920.

His eldest son, Alexander, became a noted artist.

<text>The Vergilius Vaticanus, also known as Vatican Virgil (Vatican, Biblioteca Apostolica, Cod. Vat. lat. 3225), is a Late Antique illuminated manuscript containing fragments of Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot; and &quot;Georgics&quot;. It was made in Rome in around 400 CE, and is one of the oldest surviving sources for the text of the &quot;Aeneid&quot;. It is the oldest and one of only three ancient illustrated manuscripts of classical literature.

== Contents ==
The two other surviving illustrated manuscripts of classical literature are the Vergilius Romanus and the Ambrosian Iliad. The Vergilius Vaticanus is not to be confused with the Vergilius Romanus (Vatican City, Biblioteca Apostolica, Cod. Vat. lat. 3867) or the unillustrated Vergilius Augusteus, two other ancient Vergilian manuscripts in the Biblioteca Apostolica.

Virgil created a classic of Roman literature in the &quot;Aeneid&quot;. He used vivid locations and emotions to create images through poetry in the story. It discusses Aeneas and his Trojan comrades wandering into the seas until reaching their final destination in Italy after escaping the city of Troy after the Trojan War. The narrative includes themes of love, loss, and war. The Trojan War is an inspiration and a catalyst in a long line of epic poetry that came after Virgil. 

== Attribution ==
The illustrations were added by three different painters, all of whom used iconographic copybooks. The first worked on the &quot;Georgics&quot; and parts of the &quot;Eclogues&quot;; only two worked on the &quot;Aeneid&quot;. Each individual artist&#x27;s illustrations are apparent based on their ability. The first artist is distinguished by his knowledge of spatial perspective and anatomy. His illustrations creates in the &quot;Georgics&quot; and &quot;Eclogues&quot; focus on his skill of creating distances and landscapes. The illustration of the herd being led to water is found in the artist&#x27;s illustration of the &quot;Georgics&quot;. Each figure and object in the background is distinguishable with a realistic spatial arrangement.

Compared to the first artist, the second artist, who worked on the &quot;Aeneid&quot;, lacks the same familiarity with spatial perspective. The inclusion of crowds with buildings, people and mountains creates a striking contrast in the discovery of Carthage. There are ideas of spatial perspective, realistic space and figures in the third artist&#x27;s illustrations. He used his ability to depict a realistic background based on his skill in human anatomy. One example was where the deceased Dido lays in repose in her decorated bedchamber in the Lamentation Over Dido.

== Description ==
There are 76 surviving leaves in the manuscript with 50 illustrations. If, as was common practice at the time, the manuscript contained all of the canonical works of Virgil, the manuscript would originally have had about 440 leaves and 280 illustrations. The illustrations are contained within frames and include landscapes and architectural and other details.

Many of the folios survive in fragments. Some fragments are grouped in fours or fives. There are 50 damaged illustrations in poor condition. It is simple to reconstruct the original book based on each fragment. The canonical works of Virgil, containing 440 folios with 280 illustrations, was customary at the time containing no introductions. It is easy and handy to read. There is no evidence of a significantly older book which can be compared based on quality.

Of the several editions of Virgil, the Vergilius Vaticanus is the first edition in codex form. It may have been copied from a set of scrolls, which caused a lack of clarity with the transmission of the text. There was a well-organized workshop that created the Vergilius Vaticanus. By leaving spaces at certain places in the text, a master scribe planned the inclusion of illustrations when copying the text.

Out of tradition and convenience, there were iconographic models that were from three different artists who filled in the illustrations. For the painter to finish this work, a set of illustrated rolls was studied and adapted which were to serve as iconographic models for the Aeneid.

These kinds of small illustrations were placed in the columns of text which was written in papyrus style on rolls.  

=== Text and script ===
The text was written by a single scribe in rustic capitals. As was common at the time, there is no separation between words. One scribe used a late antique brown ink to write the entire text. Using eight-power magnification, the ink is grainless which appears smooth and well-preserved. The Vergilius Vaticanus is in very good condition, compared to other manuscripts from the same time period, which had been inefficiently prepared causing the parchment to break from oak gallnuts and ferrous sulphate. For distinctions to be made between thick and thin strokes the scribe used a trimmed broad pen. The pen was nearly held at 60 degrees where most strokes would occur.

=== Illustrations ===
The miniatures are set within the text column, although a few miniatures occupy a full page. The human figures are painted in classical style with natural proportions and drawn with vivacity. The illustrations often convey the illusion of depth quite well. The gray ground of the landscapes blend into bands of rose, violet, or blue to give the impression of a hazy distance. The interior scenes are based on earlier understanding of perspective, but occasional errors suggest that the artists did not fully understand the models used. The style of these miniatures has much in common with the surviving miniatures of the Quedlinburg Itala fragment and have also been compared to the frescos found at Pompeii. Each miniature had a proportional figure with a landscape creating a hazy effect, featuring classical architecture and clothing.

Popular myths such as Hylas and the Nymphs were represented by the nine surviving illustrations of the &quot;Georgics&quot; through a command of pastoral and genre scenes by competent artists. The illustrations in the &quot;Aeneid&quot; are mixed with the &quot;Georgics;&quot; however, the &quot;Georgics’&quot; artistic ingenuity is greater than the &quot;Aeneid&quot; illustrations. Without decorated frames and painted backgrounds or landscape settings, the illustrated verses used only the essentials for telling a story using minimal figures and objects. Neither framed nor painted in the background, the Vergilius Vaticanus uses a roll of illustrations in the Papyrus style.

==== Miniatures ====

One important miniature depicts Aeneas and Achates discovering Carthage (folio 13). The artist sacrificed style for pictorial accuracy in order to capture the city in its urgent progress and unity. There are two Trojans standing on a cliff surveying Carthage in an image that lacks perspective. Achates and Aeneas are identified with labels above their heads. Aeneas’ body provides material for examination such as deteriorated drapes of clothes which prevents Achates’ body from being examined. Aeneas’s awkwardly composed anatomy is created with the artist’s smooth and thick brushstrokes. The drapery unnaturally positions the legs after covering the body. Aeneas’s body, in contrast to Achates, implies speech based on the extended stance. Maintaining textual accuracy, there is a clumsy perspective on the right of Aeneas which outlines Carthage. Two workers and an overseer, in the quarry below Aeneas, extracts raw materials for construction. There are stonemasons being watched by the supervisors in the background. Only stone arches and walls are being displayed, not the actions in progress.

=== Materials ===
Preparing 220 sheets of parchment paper measured from 25 by 43 centimeters (10 by 17 in) was the first step in the bookmaking process. This is comparable to other luxurious manuscripts of the time, some of which required approximately 74 sheep in order for the manuscript to be created. Despite a few holes in the Vergilius Vaticanus, it remained in excellent quality. Parchment is very thin with a smooth polished surface which are described by being the best books of the period. The hair side is slightly yellow creating a curl while the side of the flesh is white. The usage of the parchment at extensive length will lead to deterioration, fortunately the parchment can be used at great length based on its stiffness.

== Provenance ==
The manuscript was probably made for a pagan noble. This late antique illuminated manuscript remained actively used for at least 200 years in Italy. The first record of the almost complete manuscript showed up at the monastery of Saint-Martin in Tours during the second quarter of the ninth century. There are only a few corrections and replacement have been done on the text. Before the manuscript was dismembered and further disappeared, the illustrations from the manuscript were studied delicately by artists. Those artists later established one of the most influential painting schools of Carolingian painting and one of the artists actually copied two figures from the manuscript to use in the Vivian Bible.

In 1448, the Italian humanist Giovanni Pontano studied and collected the manuscript. At that time, as the manuscript lost around 164 folios. In addition, several folios were appear to have been cut by someone else. In around 1514, the manuscript, after it disappeared and suffered more dismemberment, showed up in Rome in the circle of Raphael where several of the surviving illustrations were copied and adapted for other purpose. People feared that the manuscript would eventually completely deteriorate, so a copy of all the illustrations from the manuscript was created in the circle of Raphael (now Princeton MS104). In 1513, the manuscript was transferred to Rome, to the library of the humanist Pietro Bembo. When Pope Leo X died in 1521, Bembo retired to Padua and brought the manuscript with him. Next, Pietro Bembo passed down the manuscript to his son, Torquato Bembo. Finally in 1579, the manuscript returned to Rome and some folios got trimmed down. Fulvio Orsini bought the manuscript from Torquato Bembo. Fulvio Orsini eventually bequeathed his library to the Vatican library in 1600.  Shortly after 1642, the manuscript was altered due to rebinding the codex and added patches on the parchment.

The manuscript was published with color reproductions in 1980.

<doc id="1313479" wikidata="Q1239246" url="?curid=1313479" title="Don Kirshner">
<text>Donald Kirshner (April 17, 1934 – January 17, 2011) was an American music publisher, music consultant, rock music producer, talent manager, and songwriter. Dubbed &quot;the Man with the Golden Ear&quot; by &quot;Time&quot; magazine, he was best known for managing songwriting talent as well as successful pop groups, such as the Monkees, Kansas, and the Archies.

==Early life==
Don Kirshner was born to a Jewish family in the Bronx, New York, United States, the son of Gilbert Kirshner, a tailor, and Belle Jaffe. He graduated from George Washington High School in Manhattan, and went on to study at Upsala College in East Orange, New Jersey. After graduation he went to work for Vanderbilt Music, a small music publishing company owned by former Tin Pan Alley lyricist Al Lewis. Kirshner brought Lewis together with Sylvester Bradford, an African-American songwriter. Lewis and Bradford wrote &quot;Tears on My Pillow&quot;, which was a big hit for Little Anthony and the Imperials in 1958.

==Aldon Music==

Kirshner achieved his first major success in the late 1950s and early 1960s as co-owner of the influential New York-based publishing company Aldon Music with partner Al Nevins, which had under contract at various times several of the most important songwriters of the so-called &quot;Brill Building&quot; school, including Carole King, Gerry Goffin, Neil Sedaka, Neil Diamond, Paul Simon, Phil Spector, Howard Greenfield, Barry Mann, Cynthia Weil, Tony Orlando, and Jack Keller.

As a producer-promoter, Kirshner was instrumental in launching the careers of singers and songwriters, including Bobby Darin, with whom he collaborated on a number of advertising jingles and pop &quot;ditties&quot; - their first was called &quot;Bubblegum Pop&quot;. He was also responsible for finding Tony Orlando, Neil Diamond, Carole King, and Sarah Dash of Labelle, as well as discovering the occasional rock act, such as Kansas.

==Don Kirshner&#x27;s record labels==
Kirshner had three record labels. The first was Chairman Records, a subsidiary of London Records. Although he was responsible for scores of hits in the 1960s, he was only to have one on the Chairman label – 1963&#x27;s &quot;Martian Hop&quot; by The Ran-Dells – which reached number 16 nationally. Kirshner later had two other record labels: Calendar Records, which had early hits by the Archies, and later morphed into the Kirshner label, which had later hits by the Archies and Kansas. Calendar/Kirshner recordings were first distributed by RCA Records, then CBS Records. Kirshner was also involved in Dimension Records.

==Music for TV shows==
In the early 1960s, Kirshner was a successful music publisher as head of his own company, Aldon Music, which later was sold to Screen Gems-Columbia Music. With Al Nevins, Kirshner brought performers such as Bobby Darin together with songwriters and musicians. He later became president of COLGEMS, a subsidiary of the COLPIX label, in 1966.

Kirshner was hired by the producers of &quot;The Monkees&quot; to provide hit-worthy songs to accompany the television program, within a demanding schedule. Kirshner used songwriting talent from his Brill Building stable of writers and musicians to create catchy, engaging tracks which the band could pretend to perform on the show. This was required to keep up with the demanding schedule.

The formula worked phenomenally well – the singles &quot;Last Train to Clarksville&quot;, written by Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart, and &quot;I&#x27;m a Believer&quot;, written by Neil Diamond, were, along with the first two Monkees albums, produced and released in time to catch the initial wave of the television program&#x27;s popularity. After a year, the Monkees wanted a chance to play their own instruments on the records. They also wanted more control over which songs would be released as singles. The matter reached a breaking point over a disagreement regarding the Neil Diamond-penned &quot;A Little Bit Me, A Little Bit You&quot; in early 1967. The song&#x27;s release by Kirshner as a single, without Columbia Pictures&#x27; consent, led to his dismissal.

Kirshner&#x27;s later venture was the Archies, an animated series where there were only studio musicians to be managed.

Kirshner was a music consultant or music supervisor for nearly two dozen TV series between 1966 and 1977, such as &quot;Bewitched&quot;. One instance brought Phil Spector, Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart together on the TV show &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot;, a program on which Don Kirshner was credited as music consultant for 35 episodes from 1966 to 1967.

==Producer==
From 1970 to 1979, Kirshner served as producer or executive producer for a number of made for TV movies, TV specials, and TV series. One of those series was the musical game show &quot;Musical Chairs&quot;, notable for being the first game show hosted by an African-American, Adam Wade.

== &quot;Don Kirshner&#x27;s Rock Concert&quot; ==

In the fall of 1972, Kirshner was asked by ABC Television to serve as executive producer and &quot;creative consultant&quot; for their new &quot;In Concert&quot; series, which aired every other week in the 11:30 p.m. slot normally showing &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot;. The following September, Kirshner left &quot;In Concert&quot; to produce and host his own syndicated weekly rock-concert program called &quot;Don Kirshner&#x27;s Rock Concert&quot;. With its long-form live performances, it was a new direction for pop music presentation on television as compared to rehearsed, often lip-synced performances that were the staple of earlier television shows like &quot;Shindig!&quot;. The last show aired in 1981, the year that MTV was launched.

The program presented many of the most successful bands of the era, usually rock and roll but occasionally from other genres, each time introduced by Kirshner&#x27;s trademark monotone delivery as the program host. In its final season, &quot;Rock Concert&quot; was mostly hosted by Kirshner&#x27;s son and daughter, whose delivery was similar as their father&#x27;s. Kirshner&#x27;s &quot;wooden&quot; presentation style was later lampooned on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; by Paul Shaffer, most notably in Shaffer&#x27;s introduction of the Blues Brothers during the duo&#x27;s television debut. Shaffer and Kirshner worked together on the short-lived situation comedy, &quot;A Year at the Top&quot;, which Kirshner co-produced with Norman Lear, and in which Shaffer starred.

==Later career==
Kirshner received the 2007 Songwriters Hall of Fame Abe Olman Publishing Award. He was a creative consultant for Rockrena, a company founded by Jack Wishna, and launched in 2011 to promote new music talent online. He died of heart failure in a Boca Raton, Florida hospital on January 17, 2011, at age 76, survived by his wife of 50 years, Sheila; his son, Ricky Kirshner; daughter, Daryn Lewis; and five grandchildren.

On April 14, 2012, Don Kirshner was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

<text>Sir Bevil Grenville (23 March 1596 – 5 July 1643) was an English landowner and soldier who sat as a Member of Parliament for various constituencies between 1620 and 1642, although during those years there were few parliamentary sessions. When the First English Civil War broke out in August 1642, he joined the Royalists and played a leading role in their early campaigns in the West Country. He was killed in action at the Battle of Lansdowne in 1643.

==Early life==
Bevil Grenville was born 23 March 1596 in Lower Brynn, near Withiel, Cornwall, eldest son of Sir Bernard Grenville (1567–1636) and Elizabeth Bevil (1564–1636), and grandson of Elizabethan hero and naval captain, Sir Richard Grenville (1542–1591). He had a younger brother, Richard (1600–1659), who later also fought for the Royalists during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, acquiring a reputation for brutality and greed.

Grenville entered Exeter College, Oxford, in 1611, and graduated in 1614, later saying he had failed to benefit much from his time there. He spent the next four years at Court, supervised by Endymion Porter, a close friend of his father and of the future Charles I.

In 1618, Grenville married Grace Smith (died 1647), daughter of Sir George Smith, three times Mayor of Exeter and one of its wealthiest citizens, an important consideration given his father&#x27;s sizeable debts. They went on to have twelve children, including Richard (born 1620, died young), John (1628–1701), Dennis (died 1702), Bernard (1631–1701), Elizabeth, Bridget, Joanna and Grace.

==Early career==
In 1621, Grenville was elected as one of the two knights of the shire for Cornwall, to sit in the 3rd Parliament of James I. In 1624 he was elected again for the 4th parliament.

In 1625, the family estates at Kilkhampton were settled on Grenville in return for agreeing to settle his father&#x27;s debts of £15,000. He was elected for Launceston in 1625 and retained the seat until Charles I suspended Parliament in 1629.

While Sir Bernard backed Charles and his arbitrary policies, his son was a supporter of Sir John Eliot who was imprisoned in the Tower of London for his opposition to Personal Rule. Grenville withdrew from involvement in politics after Eliot&#x27;s death in 1632, but was reconciled with his father shortly before he died in 1636 and became Deputy lieutenant of Cornwall.

==Wars of the Three Kingdoms==
Despite his previous opposition to Royal policies, on the outbreak of the Bishops&#x27; Wars with Scotland in 1639, Grenville raised a troop of cavalry which acted as Charles&#x27; bodyguard and was knighted for his service in 1639. When Parliament was briefly recalled in April 1640, he was re-elected for Launceston, then sat for Cornwall in the Long Parliament from November 1640 until he was suspended in September 1642.

When the First English Civil War began in August 1642, most of the West Country gentry supported the Royalist cause. Grenville helped proclaim the King&#x27;s Commission of Array at Launceston, empowering them to mobilise the local Trained bands or militia. In addition, Grenville, Nicholas Slanning, William Godolphin, John Trevanion and Warwick Mohun, each recruited a regiment at their own expense, collectively known as &quot;the Tinners&quot;, since many of the recruits worked in local tin mines.

The rank and file often had little choice in deciding whether to &quot;volunteer&quot;; Grenville, generally regarded as a benevolent landlord, threatened his tenants and employees with sanctions if they refused to sign up. While militia on both sides often refused to serve outside their own counties, the Cornish were particularly noted for their reluctance to serve outside Cornwall or under non-Cornish officers. Although regarded as some of the best infantry available to the Royalists in the West, these factors limited their usefulness. When Royalist commander Sir Ralph Hopton advanced on Plymouth after his victory at Braddock Down in January 1643, many of his troops refused to cross the River Tamar into Devon.

At Stratton on 16 May 1643, Grenville led his men against Parliamentarian troops entrenched along the top of Stamford hill. After eight hours of fighting, the Royalists were nearly out of ammunition and a counterattack led by James Chudleigh knocked over Grenville and briefly caused his troops to waver; however, they quickly rallied and cut down their opponents using pikes and clubs. Shortly after this, the Parliamentarians were in headlong flight, a victory which secured Cornwall for the Royalists. Their advance into Devon, then Somerset, led to the Battle of Lansdowne on 5 July, near Bath. Grenville led his regiment in a successful charge against Parliamentarian positions on Lansdowne Hill, then formed a defensive line and held his ground despite a series of counterattacks by the Parliamentarian cavalry.

In the course of this, Grenville was hit in the head with a pole-axe and carried to the rectory at nearby Cold Ashton, where he died of his wounds next day. His friend John Trevelyan later wrote to his wife Grace that he &quot;died an honourable death...fighting with invincible valour and loyalty for his God, his King and his Country&quot;. His servant Anthony Payne brought his body back to Kilkhampton, and he was buried in the parish church of St James on 26 July.

==Legacy==
His grandson George Granville, 1st Baron Lansdown became Secretary at War in the Tory government of 1710 to 1712 and took the title &quot;Baron Lansdown&quot; in a reference to his heroic grandfather. Shortly before the succession of George I in 1714, he erected an elaborate monument to Sir Bevil in the Granville Chapel, a reminder of his family&#x27;s loyalty to the House of Stuart. Like many Tories, exclusion from office after 1715 embittered Granville and he became a Jacobite, being held in the Tower of London from 1715 to 1717 and allegedly involved in the 1722 Atterbury Plot. The erection of Sir Bevil Grenville&#x27;s Monument in 1720 was another reference to his family history.

<text>The Boston Police Department (BPD) is the primary law enforcement agency of Boston, Massachusetts, United States. Founded in 1854, the BPD is the oldest municipal police department in the United States. It is also the 20th largest law enforcement agency in the country, with 2,713 sworn and unsworn personnel.

==History==

=== Pre-incorporation (1635–1828) ===
Before the existence of a formal police department, the first night watch was established in Boston in 1635. In 1703, pay in the sum of 35 shillings a month was set for members of the night watch. In 1796, the watch was reorganized, and the watchmen carried a badge of office, a rattle, and a six-foot pole, which was painted blue and white with a hook on one end and a bill on the other. The hook was used to grab fleeing criminals, and the rounded &quot;bill&quot; was used as a weapon. The rattle was a noise-making device used for calling for assistance.

The Day Police, which had no connection to the night watch, was organized in 1838. The Day Police operated under the city marshal and had six appointed officers. This organization would eventually lead to the establishment of the modern-day Boston Police Department.

=== Nineteenth century ===
In 1838, a bill passed in the General Court that allowed the city to appoint police officers, paving the way for the creation of a formal police department. The Boston Police Department was formally founded in May 1854, at which point both the night watch and Day Police were disbanded. A 14-inch club replaced the old hook and bill, which had been in use for 154 years. At the time of its founding, the Boston Police constituted one of the first paid, professional police services in the United States. The department was closely organized and modeled after Sir Robert Peel&#x27;s (London) Metropolitan Police Service.

On November 3, 1851, the first Irish-born Boston Police officer, Bernard &quot;Barney&quot; McGinniskin, was appointed. His presence generated considerable controversy. The &quot;Boston Pilot&quot; wrote, &quot;He is the first Irishman that ever carried the stick of a policeman anywhere in this country, and meetings, even Faneuil Hall meetings, have been held to protect against the appointment.&quot; At the time, the police salary of $2.00 a day for the morning and afternoon beat and $1.20 for the night watch was nearly twice as high as the wages of laborers. City Marshal Francis Tukey resisted mayor John Prescott Bigelow&#x27;s appointment of McGinniskin, expressing the predominant anti-Irish sentiments in the city by arguing it was done at &quot;the expense of an American.&quot; On January 5, 1852, shortly before the newly elected mayor Benjamin Seaver (who had been supported by Tukey) took office, Tukey fired McGinniskin without giving a reason. After criticism in the press, Seaver reinstated McGinniskin, who remained in the police until the 1854 anti-Irish groundswell of the Know Nothing/American Party movement, when in the words of the &quot;Boston Pilot&quot;, &quot;Mr. McGinniskin was discharged from the Boston Police for no other reason than he was a Catholic and born in Ireland.&quot; McGinniskin became a United States inspector at the customhouse and died of rheumatism on March 2, 1868. McGinniskin is buried in the St. Augustine Cemetery in South Boston.

On October 18, 1857, at about 5:15 a.m., Boston Police Officer Ezekiel W. Hodsdon was patrolling the corner of Havre and Maverick Street in East Boston. Hodsdon attempted to arrest two suspects for a burglary. A struggle ensued, and one of the suspects was able to get behind Hodsdon and shoot him in the head. Hodsdon died about 10:00 A.M., becoming the first Boston police officer killed in the line of duty. He was 25 years old. The murderers fled. Thousands of people visited the station house to view the body. Hodsdon left behind his wife Lydia and infant son Ezekiel, who was born just 13 days prior to his death. He was buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in Everett, according to &quot;Boston Globe&quot; newspaper reports on October 19, 1857. On October 18, 2007, a memorial was held in honor of Hodsdon on the corner of Havre and Maverick Streets in East Boston. On July 14, 1863, Boston Mayor Frederic W. Lincoln Jr. (1858–1861 &amp; 1863–1867) ordered all 330 officers in the Department to quell a draft riot among Irish Catholics attempting to raid Union armories in the North End.

In 1871, the Boston Police Relief Association was founded. The purpose of the Boston Relief Association is intended to provide support and relief for officers of the Boston Police Department and their families. It was incorporated under the statutes of Massachusetts in 1876. 

The Boston Police Department appointed Horatio J. Homer, its first African American officer, on December 24, 1878. He was promoted to sergeant in 1895. Sgt. Homer retired on Jan 29, 1919, after 40 years of service. He and his wife, Lydia Spriggs Homer, are buried at Evergreen Cemetery in Brighton, MA. On June 26, 2010, the Boston Police Department dedicated a gravestone in honor of Sgt. Homer&#x27;s service.

===20th century===

====1910s====
On September 9, 1919, when Police Commissioner Edwin Upton Curtis refused to allow the creation of a police union, 1,117 BPD officers went on strike. This signaled a dramatic shift in traditional labor relations and views on the part of the police, who were unhappy with stagnant wages and poor working conditions. The city soon fell into riots and public chaos as over three-fourths of the department was no longer enforcing public peace. Governor Calvin Coolidge intervened to quash further chaos. Coolidge announced that the police did not have the right to strike against the public safety and brought in the state national guard to restore order to Boston. The strike was broken, permanently, when Coolidge hired replacement police officers, many of whom were returning servicemen from World War I, and the former officers were refused re-entry into the department. Ironically, the new officers hired in the wake of the strike received higher salaries, more vacation days and city-provided uniforms, the very demands the original strikers were requesting. The BPD strike set a precedent for further movements to stymie police unionization around the country.

Coolidge&#x27;s intervention in the strike brought him national fame, which, in turn, led to his nomination as Harding&#x27;s running mate for vice-president in the 1920 presidential election.
====1920s====
In 1921, Irene McAuliffe, daughter of the late Weston police chief and horse breeder Patrick McAuliffe, was among the first six female members of the Boston Police Department. An accomplished horsewoman, she was sworn in as a mounted officer of the Weston Police Department in 1913 during the town&#x27;s bicentennial celebration. She joined the District of Columbia Police Department in 1920, and in 1921 she became a member of the Boston Police Department&#x27;s Vice Squad.
====1930s====
On May 29, 1930, Oliver Garrett was charged with 152 counts of conspiracy, extortion, and receiving gratuities for crimes allegedly committed as leader of BPD&#x27;s liquor raiding unit during Prohibition. Commissioner Herbert A. Wilson, who had conducted a secret investigation into Garrett two years earlier and had overrode his subordinates to grant Garrett a questionable disability pension, was removed from office by the Governor Frank G. Allen and the Massachusetts Governor&#x27;s Council. On May 7, 1931, Garrett pleaded to guilty and was sentenced to two years in the Deer Island House of Correction and fined $100.
====1960s====
In 1965, the largest police union representing Boston police employees, the Boston Police Patrolmen&#x27;s Association, was formed.

=====School desegregation busing crisis=====

In 1974 and 1975, the BPD was involved in maintaining order during the public disturbance over court-ordered busing, which was intended to racially desegregate Boston&#x27;s public school system. The protest of white citizens escalated into street battles in 1974, and in 1975 uniformed BPD officers were stationed inside South Boston High School, Charlestown High School and other Boston public schools.
====1980s====
=====1982 Boston arson spree=====

Between 1982 and 1984, an arson ring that included BPD officers and allies set fire to 264 buildings. The ring opposed Proposition 2½, which reduced the funds that Massachusetts municipalities could raise through property taxes and led to cuts in fire departments and police agencies. Through committing arson, the ring hoped to cause social disorder to make the case for the necessity of firefighters and police.

====Charles Stuart murder investigation====

In 1989, Charles Stuart killed his wife and accused an unknown black man for the murder. BPD proceeded to conduct a manhunt targeting young black men, indiscriminately using stop and frisk tactics, especially in neighborhoods of Mission Hill and Roxbury. Some residents compared the response to living in a war zone and the response is said to have contributed to distrust between black communities and BPD for decades following.
====1990s====
=====Federal fingerprinting coordination=====
On August 23, 1995, the BPD became the first police agency to send fingerprint images to the FBI electronically using the newly created EFIPS (now IAFIS) system. The first set of fingerprints were for a suspect arrested for armed robbery. Within hours of the receipt of the fingerprints, the FBI determined that the suspect had a number of prior arrests, including one for assault with intent to kill.

=== 21st century ===

On December 31, 2006, 31 Boston Municipal Police Officers were allowed to transfer to the Boston Police. On January 1, 2007, the rest of the Munis were either laid off or transferred to the city&#x27;s Municipal Protective Services, which provides security to the city&#x27;s Property Management Department. There was no merger with the Boston Municipal Police.

The transfer of Munis was planned in mid-2006 by Mayor Thomas M. Menino. This plan was met with heavy protest from the Boston Police Patrolmen&#x27;s Association (BPPA). The BPPA&#x27;s argument was that the Municipal officers were not qualified to be Boston police officers due to lack of training, political patronage, nepotism, and the fact that the Munis were not civil service tested.
====2000s====
===== 2007 Boston Bomb Scare =====

On January 31, 2007, 911 callers mistakenly identified small electronic promotions found throughout Boston and the surrounding cities of Cambridge and Somerville as possible explosives. Upon investigation by Boston Police and other agencies, the suspicious devices turned out to be battery-powered LED placards with an image of a cartoon character called a &quot;mooninite&quot; used in a guerrilla marketing campaign for &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film For Theaters,&quot; a film based on the animated television series &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot; on Cartoon Network&#x27;s late-night programming block Adult Swim.

The BPD&#x27;s handling of this incident has been criticized by some Boston residents and justified by others: One resident said that the police response was &quot;silly and insane,&quot; and that &quot;We’re the laughing stock.&quot; Another resident said that the device &quot;looked like a bomb. I picked it up, pulled the tape off it, and there were batteries, two on the top and three on the bottom.&quot; The same devices had been distributed in nine other cities across the USA without provoking a similar reaction. The United States Department of Homeland Security praised Boston authorities &quot;for sharing their knowledge quickly with Washington officials and the public.&quot;
====2010s====
===== Occupy Boston Movement =====
Beginning in September–October 2011, protesters assembled in Dewey Square as a show of solidarity with the Occupy Wall Street protest in New York. In the early hours of October 11, 2011, Boston Police and Transit Police moved into the protesters&#x27; secondary camp, arresting approximately 100 protesters. Protesters reported numerous incidents of police brutality. Mayor Menino denied the reports and claimed that the protesters endangered public safety.
=====Boston Marathon bombing=====

The BPD responded to the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013.

====2020s====
===== 2020 Black Lives Matter riots=====
During the 2020 George Floyd riots, the department came under scrutiny by elected officials for its usage of tear gas against civilians. Demonstrations against police brutality began in the city in May 2020 and continued through June.

=====Overtime fraud cases=====
In early September 2020, United States Attorney Andrew Lelling indicted nine former and current Boston police officers for allegedly collecting more than $200,000 in fraudulent overtime payments while working in the department’s evidence warehouse.

===== Alleged child rapist as union president =====
In April 2021, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; reported that a 1995 internal investigation by the BPD concluded that Patrick M. Rose Sr., a BPD patrolman, had likely sexual assaulted a 12-year-old child. The BPD did not act on that finding. Instead, Rose kept his badge, served for another 21 years, and was elected president of the Boston Police Patrolmen&#x27;s Association. He was ultimately arrested and on November 20, 2020, Rose was indicted in Suffolk Superior Court on thirty three counts related to sexual assault of children, including sixteen counts of child rape. During his time in the BPD, the department did nothing to limit his interactions with children, including allowing Rose to work on child sexual assault cases.

===== Commissioner White termination =====
Following the abrupt resignation of commissioner William G. Gross at the end of January 2021, mayor Marty Walsh quickly named superintendent Dennis White to succeed Gross. White was sworn in on February 1, 2021. Two days later, White was placed on leave due to &quot;the handling of a 1999 allegation of domestic violence&quot; against White coming to light. The city of Boston subsequently hired an independent attorney to conduct an investigation; meanwhile, Walsh resigned as mayor upon his confirmation as United States Secretary of Labor. Results of the investigation were released in mid-May, followed by several legal actions by White&#x27;s attorney seeking to block the city from terminating White. Ultimately, acting mayor Kim Janey fired White on June 7, 2021.

==Departmental organization==


The Boston Police Department has approximately 2,015 officers and 808 civilian personnel, with patrol services covering an area of 89.6 mi2 (232.1 km2) and a population of 617,594. Like all City of Boston departments, the BPD requires all employed officers hired since 1995 to live within Boston city-limits. The BPD is divided into three zones and 11 neighborhood districts spread across the city, with each zone supervised by a Deputy Superintendent and every district headed by a Captain.

=== Ranks ===
The Boston Police rank structure is as follows:
=== Leadership ===


Dennis White was appointed as commissioner on February 1, 2021; he was placed on leave on February 3, 2021. Gregory P. Long has been the superintendent-in-chief since August 2018; he was named acting commissioner upon White being placed on leave.

Kathleen O&#x27;Toole was the first woman to serve as commissioner, from February 2004 through May 2006 when she left to take a new position as Chief Inspector of the Inspectorate of the Irish national police force, the Garda Síochána.

====Members of the Boston Police Commission====
A three-person police commission (also called the police board) consisted of members nominated by the Governor of Massachusetts and approved by the Massachusetts Governor&#x27;s Council. The commission was established in 1878 and abolished in 1906.

==== List of Boston Police Commissioners ====
Boston&#x27;s police commissioner was appointed by the Governor until 1962. Edmund L. McNamara was the first commissioner to be appointed by the mayor of Boston, taking office in April 1962 via appointment by mayor John F. Collins. Once appointed, a commissioner can only be removed from the position for cause until their term expires. A commissioner may be appointed to a five-year term, or to serve the remainder of a predecessor&#x27;s five-year term.

Names in italics indicate a person served as acting (interim) commissioner only. Since 1985, several acting commissioners have been sworn as permanent. Numbering is per cited contemporary news reports and may include inconsistencies.

==== Special operations unit ====

The Boston Police Special Operations Unit is a specialized unit within the Boston Police Department responsible for combined duties involving Highway Patrol and traffic enforcement, crowd control, and special weapons and tactics (SWAT) services within the city.

One unique feature of the unit is that the Special Operations Unit primarily relies on the use of Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptors and Harley-Davidsons in their daily patrols. The use of motorcycles allows the unit to perform routine traffic enforcement; accompany parades, crowds, and visiting dignitaries; and to quickly travel to situations wherein the unit&#x27;s SWAT skills are requested. Specialized trucks and support vehicles are also used to transport equipment and officers when needed.

The Canine unit with twenty seven patrol/narcotics, and EOD dogs, and Bomb (EOD) squad are also under the Special Operations Division.

<text>Hooke is a small village and civil parish in the county of Dorset in southern England, situated about northeast of the town of Bridport. It is sited in the valley of the short River Hooke, a tributary of the River Frome, amongst the chalk hills of the Dorset Downs. In the 2011 census the parish had a population of 157.

The name comes from the Old English Hoc meaning the hook or angle and referring to the land in a river bend. The spelling has changed over the years, the Doomsday Book recorded it as Lahoc and later variants include Hok (1229), La Hoke (1244) and Houc (1268).

Rampisham Down, the hill immediately northeast of the village, is the site of a transmitter station operated by VT Communications, broadcasting long-range radio signals for clients including BBC World Service. The outskirts of the village are home to Hooke Court and its surrounding parklands. Originally built in 1407 by Humphrey Stafford, the Court was extended in 1609 by the Marquis of Winchester.

To the southwest of the village are Warren Hill and the woods of Hooke Park on its western flanks.

<text>UBS Tower is a 108-meter (354-foot), 28-story skyscraper at 315 Deaderick Street in Nashville, Tennessee.

The tower was completed in 1974. It was originally called the First American Center but the name was changed when First American National Bank merged with AmSouth Bank. A major renovation of the building&#x27;s ground-level exterior followed the name change. The name then changed again to Regions Center when AmSouth merged with Regions. It is the former Tennessee headquarters of Regions Financial Corporation. Regions moved in 2013 but still leases 250,000 square feet of space in the building.
Currently the Swiss Banking behemoth UBS has leased 138,000 square feet of the building in an effort to move back office jobs from southeast Nashville to downtown Nashville. This deal expires in 2034. The name of the building was renamed from Regions Center to UBS Tower.

The building served as the Tennessee headquarters and a branch office for Birmingham, Alabama-based Regions Bank. It is also home to many non-related businesses who lease space in the upper floors. It was once the main office and headquarters of First American National Bank. AmSouth acquired the slightly larger First American National Corporation in 2000 after the latter involved itself in several unprofitable mergers. On May 25, 2006, AmSouth announced it is merging with Regions Financial. Regions announced its move to One Nashville Place in late September 2012.

A relatively small parking garage is located beneath.

==History==
The site received national attention in 1971 when remains of a saber-toothed cat were discovered during excavation of the property. A number of noted archaeologists visited the site following its initial discovery, including Ronald Spores, Kent Flannery, Vance Haynes, and Edwin Williamson. John Guilday of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History conducted an examination of all faunal material recovered from the site, and published the results in the July 1977 issue of the &quot;Journal of the Tennessee Academy of Sciences&quot;. Although Guilday may have conducted an inventory of the human remains from the site, none was ever published.

Radiocarbon analysis of human remains from the cave returned dates of 2390+/-145 B.P. and 1690+/-115 B.P. These remains were collected from an upper zone approximately 16-feet above the saber-tooth bones. The human remains are believed to be from the Woodland Period and originated thousands of years after the &quot;Smilodon&quot; find. According to Guilday (1977), collagen from the &quot;Smilodon&quot; remains returned radiocarbon dates of 9410+/-155 B.P. and 10,035+/-650 B.P. These dates are extremely late for the presence of &quot;Smilodon&quot; in the Southeast, both contemporaneous with the Dalton horizon and overlapping Paleoindian occupations along the Cumberland River by at least 1,000 years. As such, the dates for the &quot;Smilodon&quot; remains from the First American site should be regarded with some skepticism.

As a result of interest that the site generated, First American Bank agreed to engineer around the small percentage of cave deposits that had not been destroyed. These deposits were vaulted over using steel and concrete, and preserved in an artificial cavern beneath the lowest parking garage level. An access hatch and ladder provided entry to the space. Newspaper and magazine articles from the early- to mid-1970s show there was clear interest among the archaeological community in conducting further excavations in what remained of the cave. In 1973 &quot;Time Magazine&quot; reported that the bank was &quot;preparing to let archaeologists resume their digging.&quot;

Unfortunately, it appears that any plans to conduct additional investigations were abandoned around the time bank construction was completed. The final reference to additional excavation occurs in 1976, when Bob Ferguson wrote that he was &quot;certain much remains to be discovered when work resumes in the cavern, so thoughtfully preserved by the First American National Bank.&quot; 

In 1978, a group of cavers from the Nashville Grotto visited the site but were underwhelmed by the lack of intact cavern or open passages. The next documented entry into the cave did not occur until 2008, when archaeologists from the Tennessee Division of Archaeology revisited the site.

Regions Bank and UBS maintained a display in their first floor lobby that included bones from the &quot;Smilodon&quot; and other faunal material from the site. In 2016, the display was moved to Bridgestone Arena. &quot;Smilodon&quot; remains on display include portions of the lower jaw and molars, vertebral column, ribs, humerus, metacarpals, and metatarsals. A replica of a &quot;Smilodon&quot; skull from the La Brea Tar Pits serves as the centerpiece of the display. The Smilodon upper canine that led to the site discovery in 1971 is not on display, and is apparently no longer in the collection. Conventional wisdom among bank and facility management personnel is that the canine is now in the collection of the Smithsonian; however, that institution holds no record of the artifact.

The find of the &quot;Smilodon&quot; remains was the impetus for the logo of the Nashville Predators hockey team and their mascot Gnash. In the early years of the team&#x27;s existence, a video was shown on the jumbotron of a computer-generated saber-toothed cat emerging from the ground beneath downtown Nashville before the team exited the locker room prior to each home game. The logo for AmSouth (as well as its predecessor, First American) was once prominently featured in the video but was digitally deleted when the bank dropped sponsorship of the team following the 2002-2003 NHL season.

<text>Jean-Baptiste Claude Eugène Guillaume (4 July 1822, Montbard – 1 March 1905, Rome) was a French sculptor.

==Biography==
He was born at Montbard on the Côte-d&#x27;Or. He studied under Cavelier, Millet, and Barrias, at the École des Beaux-Arts, which he entered in 1841, and where he gained the prix de Rome in 1845 with &quot;Theseus finding on a rock his father&#x27;s sword&quot;. He became director of the École des Beaux-Arts in 1864, and director-general of Fine Arts from 1878 to 1879, when the office was suppressed.

Guillaume was a prolific writer, principally on sculpture and architecture of the Classic period and of the Italian Renaissance. He was elected member of the Académie française in 1898, and in 1891 was sent to Rome as director of the Académie de France in that city. He held this position until 1904. He was also elected an honorary member of the Royal Academy, London, 1869, on the institution of that class.

==Works==

Many of his works have been bought for public galleries, and his monuments are to be found in the public squares of the chief cities of France. At Reims there is his bronze statue of &quot;Colbert&quot;, at Dijon his &quot;Rameau&quot; monument. The Musée du Luxembourg has his &quot;Anacreon&quot; (1852), &quot;Faucheur&quot; (1855), and the marble bust of &quot;Mgr Darboy&quot;; the Versailles Museum the portrait of &quot;Thiers&quot;; the Sorbonne Library the marble bust of &quot;Victor le Clerc, doyen de la faculté des lettres&quot;. Other works of his are at Trinity Church, Saint-Germain l&#x27;Auxerrois, and the church of St Clotilde, Paris. The Musée d&#x27;Orsay in Paris hosts &quot;Les Gracques&quot; (1853).

<text>The lar gibbon (Hylobates lar), also known as the white-handed gibbon, is an endangered primate in the gibbon family, Hylobatidae. It is one of the better-known gibbons and is often kept in captivity.

== Taxonomy ==

There are five subspecies of lar gibbon:
* Malaysian lar gibbon (&quot;H. l. lar&quot;)
* Carpenter&#x27;s lar gibbon (&quot;H. l. carpenteri&quot;)
* Central lar gibbon (&quot;H. l. entelloides&quot;)
* Sumatran lar gibbon (&quot;H. l. vestitus&quot;)
* Yunnan lar gibbon (&quot;H. l. yunnanensis&quot;) (possibly extinct)

== Physical description ==

The fur coloring of the lar gibbon varies from black and dark-brown to light-brown, sandy colors. The hands and feet are white-colored, likewise a ring of white hair surrounds the black face. Both males and females can be all color variants, and the sexes also hardly differ in size. Gibbons are true brachiators, propelling themselves through the forest by swinging under the branches using their arms. Reflecting this mode of locomotion, the white-handed gibbon has curved fingers, elongated hands, extremely long arms and relatively short legs, giving it an intermembral index of 129.7, one of the highest of the primates. As with all apes, the number of caudal vertebrae has been reduced drastically, resulting in the loss of a functional tail. Gibbons have tough, bony padding on their buttocks, known as the ischial callosities, or sitting pads.

== Distribution and habitat ==

Lar gibbons have the greatest north-south range of any of the gibbon species. They are found in Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar and Thailand. Their range historically extended from southwest China to Thailand and Burma south to the whole Malay Peninsula in primary and secondary tropical rain forests. It is also present in the northwest portion of the island of Sumatra. In recent decades, especially, the continental range has been reduced and fragmented. Lar gibbons are likely extinct in China. However, if any populations persist, they would only be found in southwest Yunnan, their former range.

Lar gibbon are usually found in lowland dipterocarp forest, hill dipterocarp forest, and upper dipterocarp forest, including primary lowland and submontane rainforest, mixed deciduous bamboo forest, and seasonal evergreen forest. They are not usually found higher than 1200 meters above sea level. 
The gibbon genus is highly allopatric, usually separated by large rivers. As a result, their range extends through southern and eastern Myanmar, but only east of the Salween River. They are found through the Malay Peninsula. Lar gibbons also exist west of the Mekong River in northwestern Laos and northern Sumatra.
The lar gibbon can be found living in sympatry with several other primates and apes, including orangutans (&quot;Pongo pygmaeus&quot;), siamangs (&quot;S. syndactylus&quot;), pileated gibbons (&quot;Hylobates pileatus&quot;), purple-faced langurs (&quot;Trachypithecus&quot; spp.), Thomas&#x27;s langur (&quot;Presbytis thomasi&quot;), slow loris (&quot;Nycticebus coucang&quot;), and several macaques (&quot;Macaca&quot; spp.) 
In Thailand, lar gibbons probably number between 15,000 and 20,000, though there may be as few as 10 in China, if any.

== Diet and dentition ==

The lar gibbon is considered frugivorous with fruit constituting 50% of its diet, but leaves (29%) are a substantial part, with insects (13%) and flowers (9%) forming the remainder. In the wild, lar gibbons will eat a large variety of foods, including figs and other small, sweet fruits, liana fruit, tree fruit and berries, as well as young leaves, buds and flowers, new shoots, vines, vine shoots, and insects, including mantids and wasps, and even birds&#x27; eggs. During the summer months, when figs and leaves are less available, insect consumption increases twenty-fold relative to the winter.

Its dental formula is , the generalized formula for Old World monkeys and apes (including humans). The dental arcade is U-shaped, and the mandible is thin and light. The incisors are broad and flat, while the molars have low, rounded cusps with thick enamel. The most noticeable characteristic of the dentition of &quot;Hylobates lar&quot; is the presence of large, dagger-like canines in both the upper and lower jaw. These canines are not sexually dimorphic.

== Behavior ==
Lar gibbons are diurnal and arboreal, inhabiting rain forests. Lar gibbons are usually active for an average of 8.7 hours per day, leaving their sleeping sites right around sunrise and entering sleeping trees an average of 3.4 hours before sunset. 
On average, lar gibbons spend their days feeding (32.6%), resting (26.2%), traveling (24.2%), in social activities (11.3%), vocalizing (4.0%) and in intergroup encounters (1.9%), although actual proportions of activities can change significantly over the course of the year. They rarely come to the ground, instead using their long arms to brachiate through the trees. With their hooked hands, they can move swiftly with great momentum, swinging from the branches. Although they rarely come to the ground naturally, while there, they walk bipedally with arms raised above their heads for balance. Their social organization is dominated by monogamous family pairs, with one breeding male and one female along with their offspring. When a juvenile reaches sexual maturity, it is expelled from the family unit. However, this traditional conception has come under scrutiny. Long-term studies conducted in Khao Yai National Park in Thailand suggest their mating system is somewhat flexible, incorporating extra-pair copulations, partner changes and polyandrous groupings. This multimale polyandry may be attributed to cooperative territory use and female defense. As range size increases, males are more successful in defending it in a pair or group. Additionally, these extra pair copulations may increase the chance of reproduction with a mate of superior genetic quality and decrease the chance of infanticide.

===Vocalisations===

Family groups inhabit a firm territory, which they protect by warding off other gibbons with their calls. Each morning, the family gathers on the edge of its territory and begins a &quot;great call&quot;, a duet between the breeding pair. Each species has a typified call and each breeding pair has unique variations on that theme. The great call of &quot;Hylobates lar&quot; is characterized by its frequent use of short hoots with more complex hoots, along with a &quot;quavering&quot; opening and closing. These calls are one of the traits used determining species differences among the gibbons. Recent studies indicate that gibbon song have evolved to communicate conflict in terms of predation. In the presence of tiger, clouded leopard, crested serpent eagle and reticulated python songs were more likely to contain sharp wow elements than normal duets.

=== Reproduction ===
Sexually, they are similar to other gibbons. Mating occurs in every month of the year, but most conceptions occur during the dry season in March, with a peak in births during the late rainy season, in October. On average, females reproduce for the first time at about 11 years of age in the wild, much later than in captivity. Gestation is six months long on average, and pregnancies are usually of a single young. Young are nursed for approximately two years, and full maturity comes at about eight years. The life expectancy of the lar gibbons in the wild is about 25 years.

== Conservation ==

Lar gibbons are threatened in various ways: they are sometimes hunted for their meat, sometimes a parent is killed to capture young animals for pets, but perhaps the most pervasive is the loss of habitat. Lar gibbon habitats are already threatened by forest clearance for the construction of roads, agriculture, ecotourism, domesticated cattle and elephants, forest fires, subsistence logging, illegal logging, new village settlement, and palm oil plantations.

<text>Jean-Baptiste Paulin Guérin (; 25 March 1783, in Toulon – 19 January 1855, in Paris) was a French portrait and history painter.

==Biography==
He was born into a working-class family that moved to Marseille when his father acquired a locksmithing business there in 1794. During his apprenticeship in that trade, he also studied drawing at a local school and displayed some talent for it. Soon, he was spending all of his free time painting. During this time he befriended another aspiring painter, Augustin Aubert, who he joined in Paris in 1802, financing the trip by selling works to a local Baron who was an amateur art enthusiast. After that point, he devoted himself exclusively to painting. 

For a short time, he was employed as an assistant to François Gérard while serving as an unpaid apprentice in the studios of François-André Vincent. In Gérard&#x27;s studio, he prepared the canvases by painting clothing, drapery and miscellaneous items. Most of his earnings were sent home to help support his family. After a time, he became bored with such tedious work and, in 1810, submitted some of his paintings to the Salon where they were generally well received.

Vivant Denon asked him to help decorate the ceiling at the Tuileries Palace, but the project was never finished due to the Bourbon Restoration. After that, he helped to renovate the Palace of Versailles and restore the paintings there. In 1817, he won a gold medal for &quot;Jésus mort et la Mère des douleurs&quot; (Jesus who Died and the Mother of Sorrows), created for the Baltimore Basilica, the oldest major Catholic structure in the United States.

In 1822 his tableau &quot;Anchise et Vénus&quot; attracted the attention of King Louis XVIII, which earned him the Légion d&#x27;honneur and, two years later, the honor of painting the King&#x27;s portrait. In 1828, he was appointed the Director of drawing and painting at the Maison d&#x27;éducation de la Légion d&#x27;honneur. He also gave private lessons. During the reign of King Louis Philippe, he continued to receive numerous public commissions.

A few months after his death, a major exhibition of his paintings was given at the Exposition Universelle (1855). Some of his works have been mistakenly attributed to Pierre-Narcisse Guérin or Jean-Urbain Guérin, and vice versa. Neither of them were related to him.

<text>PJSC Rosneft Oil Company ( stylized as ROSNEFT) is a Russian integrated energy company headquartered in Moscow. Rosneft specializes in the exploration, extraction, production, refining, transport, and sale of petroleum, natural gas, and petroleum products. The company is controlled by the Russian government through the Rosneftegaz holding company. Its name is a portmanteau of the Russian words ().

Rosneft was founded in 1993 as a state enterprise and then incorporated in 1995, acquiring a number of state-controlled gas and oil assets. It became Russia&#x27;s leading oil company after purchasing assets of the former oil company Yukos at state-run auctions. After acquiring OJSC TNK-BP in 2013, then one of the largest oil companies in Russia, Rosneft became the world&#x27;s largest publicly traded petroleum company.

Rosneft is the third-largest Russian company and the second-largest state-controlled company (after Gazprom) in Russia in terms of revenue (₽4,134 billion). Internationally, it is one of the largest oil companies, ranking 24 in terms of revenue. In the 2020 Forbes Global 2000, Rosneft was ranked as the 53rd-largest public company in the world. The company operates in more than twenty countries around the world.

==History==
=== Origins ===
Rosneft has played a major role in the history of Russia&#x27;s oil industry. The first use of the name &quot;Rosneft&quot; dates back to the late 19th century, when exploration of oil fields in Sakhalin began in 1889. Most of Rosneft&#x27;s current assets were acquired during the Soviet era.

=== 1990s ===

Rosneft was established in 1993 as a unitary enterprise with assets previously held by Rosneftegaz, the successor to the Soviet Union&#x27;s Ministry of Oil Industry. During the early 1990s, almost all Russian oil companies and refineries were extracted from Rosneft to form ten integrated companies. Later their number was halved as a result of acquisitions. On 29 September 1995, an Order of the Government of Russia No. 971 transformed Rosneft into an open joint stock company.

In March 1996, Rosneft founded the Russian Regional Development Bank.

Rosneft struggled financially and operationally during the 1998 Russian financial crisis with decreased production due to poor assets and lower retail sales with an underused refining capacity. In July 1998 the Russian government tried to sell Rosneft, but it failed.

In October 1998, the Russian government appointed Sergey Bogdanchikov as president. The company owned two obsolete refineries and several low-productive and poorly managed oil-producing assets. In the late 1990s, plans for Rosneft&#x27;s privatization in Russia were made, but due to competition with equally influential pretenders, they were not carried out.

=== 2000s ===
From 2002 to 2004, the company&#x27;s primary objectives were strengthening control over its assets, reducing the debt burden, and obtaining licenses in Eastern Siberia. The determining factor in enhancing the role of Rosneft in the Russian oil industry has been the support of the country&#x27;s top leadership. The company, during this time, managed to restore its status after its rough start in the 1990s with the acquisition of Krasnodar Oil and Gas Company in 2002 and Northern Oil Company in early 2003. In addition, in 2002, the company received a license for the development of the Sakhalin-IV and Sakhalin-V project, and in 2003 a license for the development of the Sakhalin-III project.

In 2005, Rosneft acquired a 25.94% stake in the company Verkhnechonskneftegaz and became the leading oil company of Russia in terms of production.

In 2007, the company for the first time entered the annual list of one hundred most respected firms and companies in the world according to the weekly &quot;Barron&#x27;s&quot;, in 99th place. By the same year, Rosneft produced 100 million barrels of oil, 20% of Russia&#x27;s output at the time. In March 2007, Rosneft had announced it hoped to increase production from 80 million tonnes to 103 million tonnes from 2006 to the end of 2007, extract 140 million tonnes of oil by 2012, and become a global top three energy company.

When the Great Recession struck Russia in late 2008, Rosneft was able to endure the economic pains by improving and strengthening business lines, management, and transparency, and as a result, became a leading oil company domestically and internationally.

In February 2009, a number of agreements were negotiated between Russia and China that provided a 20-year contract for an annual supply of 15 million tons of oil between the Chinese National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) and Rosneft, cooperation between CNPC and Transneft to construct and operate a branch of the Eastern Siberia–Pacific Ocean (ESPO) oil pipeline to China, and the provision of loans for US$25 billion—US$15 billion from Rosneft and US$10 billion from Transneft—by the China Development Bank on the security of supplies.

====Acquisition of assets of Yukos====
Starting in 2004, the Russian government organized a series of auctions to sell the assets of Yukos Oil Company, of which Rosneft won the majority. On 22 December 2004, Rosneft purchased Baikal Finance Group, which bought Yuganskneftegaz (Yugansk), a main asset of Yukos, three days earlier at a state-run auction for US$9.35 billion to satisfy tax debts. According to some estimates, this operation was directed by Russian authorities in order to nationalize Russia&#x27;s oil and gas industry. In response to the deal, Andrei Illarionov, then a senior Putin economic advisor, denounced it as &quot;fraud of the year&quot;.

In 2005, Mikhail Khodorkovsky (former chairman of Menatep) and Platon Lebedev (business partner of Khodorkovsky) were sentenced to nine years in prison for fraud and tax evasion. In February 2007, they were charged again and accused of stealing $25 billion worth of oil from Yukos subsidiaries. They were convicted, but in 2013 Putin pardoned Khodorkovsky and 2014 the Russian supreme court announced that Lebedev should also be freed early.

The purchase of Yugansk in 2005 greatly increased the number of assets and production for Rosneft. Subsequently, Rosneft filed a lawsuit against Yukos in connection with the use of the understated transfer prices for the purchase of oil from Yuganskneftegaz prior to its breakup. At the same time, Rosneft itself also purchased oil and gas from its subsidiary, Yuganskneftegaz, at transfer prices.
In May 2007, Rosneft won a number of auctions for the sale of Yukos&#x27; assets, including five refineries and oil companies Tomsk Oil Company and Samara Oil and Gas Company, making it the largest oil company in Russia. According to experts on the Russian newspaper &quot;Vedomosti&quot;, the assets of Yukos, bought by Rosneft at auction organized by the state, went to the company at a discount of 43.4% of the market price of this property. In 2007, the former assets of Yukos provided 72.6% of oil and gas condensate production and 74.2% of Rosneft&#x27;s primary refining. In June, Rosneft paid $731 million for the transportation assets of Yukos, which had declared bankrupt in August 2006 after three years of litigation over tax arrears. In August, Bogdanchikov said that although the Yukos acquisitions had increased Rosnefts debt to $US 26 billion, he planned to reduce debt to 30% of total assets by 2010 by tripling refining capacity and expand into China.

====Initial public offering of 2006====
In July 2006, Rosneft placed 15% of its shares traded with a total value of US$10.7 billion in an initial public offering (IPO) at the London Stock Exchange, the Russian Trading System, and the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange. Part of the shares were distributed among the Russian population through banks such as Sberbank and Gazprombank.

The Federal Service for Financial Markets authorized the placement and circulation outside the country of a 22.5% stake in Rosneft.

Rosneft announced a placement value of US$5.85–7.85 per share and global depository receipt (GDR), based on the company&#x27;s capitalization after consolidation of US$60–80 billion. It planned to place shares for at least US$8.5 billion in order to repay loans to Western banks, including interest and taxes.

On 14 July, the official results of the placement value were announced. Shares were priced at US$7.55, almost at the upper end of the price band, resulting in Rosneft&#x27;s capitalization—taking into account the upcoming consolidation of its subsidiaries—at a value of US$79.8 billion, making Rosneft surpass Lukoil as the largest oil company in Russia. Investors bought 1.38 billion shares for US$10.4 billion: 21% of the shares were bought by strategic investors, 36% from international investors from North America, Europe, and Asia, 39% from Russian investors, and 4% from Russian retail investors. 49.4% of the total IPO volume accounted for four investors, including BP for US$1 billion, Petronas for US$1.5 billion, and the CNPC for $0.5 billion. Individuals submitted applications for the purchase of 99,431,775 shares of the oil company, and as a result, most of the new shareholders were individuals; partly because of this IPO was given the unofficial name of &quot;people&#x27;s.&quot;

Rosneft&#x27;s IPO became the largest in the history of Russia and the fifth in the world in terms of the amount of money raised at the time. The announced amount could increase by another US$400 million if the global placement coordinators realize the option of buying another 53 million GDRs of Rosneft at the price of placement within 30 days.

==== On Abkhazia ====
On 26 May 2009, a five-year cooperation agreement was negotiated between Rosneft and the Abkhazia&#x27;s Ministry of Economy. The parties stated their intention to develop mutually beneficial cooperation in areas as geological prospecting, development of oil and gas fields, production of hydrocarbons, and sale of oil, natural gas and oil products. Rosneft undertook exploration on the shelf in the Ochamchire area, discovering preliminary reserves estimated at 200 million to 500 million tons of oil equivalent. In addition to drilling and creating its own sales network, Rosneft also planned the construction of mini-refineries in Abkhazia.

According to Rosneft, the company provides more than half of the retail sales of oil products in Abkhazia. In 2014, Rosneft exported 47 thousand tons of oil products to Abkhazia. Since 2015, Rosneft has been supplying aviation fuel for Sukhumi Babushara Airport.

As part of the project to develop the Gudauta area on the Black Sea shelf, Rosneft carried out a full range of geophysical and geochemical research, conduct 2D and 3D seismic surveys, and start preparations for exploratory drilling. In June 2014, Rosneft extended the shelf study period to five years.

In July 2015, however, the new President of Abkhazia, Raul Khajimba, who replaced Alexander Ankvab after his resignation, spoke out against the exploration and production of oil on the offshore shelf of Abkhazia and asked the People&#x27;s Assembly to consider the possibility of establishing a &quot;commission for the comprehensive study of issues related to the conclusion of contracts for exploration and production hydrocarbons by the previous Abkhaz leadership.&quot;

A group of deputies of the People&#x27;s Assembly drafted a bill banning the development of hydrocarbons in Abkhazia. Supporters of the bill demanded the prohibition of the development of the offshore shelf in Abkhazia for 30 years.

=== 2010s ===
In September 2010, Eduard Khudainatov replaced Sergei Bogdanchikov as CEO of the company.

On 15 October 2010, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev signed an agreement with President of Venezuela Hugo Chávez for the PDVSA to sell 50% of the shares of German company Ruhr Oel to Rosneft, giving Rosneft oil refining assets in Germany.

Since 23 May 2012, former Deputy Prime Minister Igor Sechin became the company&#x27;s CEO, succeeding Khudaninatov, who received the post of vice-president.

In the summer of 2012, Rosneft purchased a fuel oil terminal from the United Shipbuilding Corporation (USC) located on the territory of the Murmansk Ship Repair Plant No. 35. The transaction value is estimated at US$28 million. According to &quot;Kommersant&quot;, the Murmansk terminal can be used as a platform for Rosneft&#x27;s activities in the Arctic.

In October 2016, Rosneft bought a 49% stake in Essar Oil of India, along with Russian investment fund United Capital, in a deal worth $13 billion.

On 7 December 2016, Rosneft signed a deal to sell 19.5% of the outstanding shares, or roughly US$11 billion, to the Anglo-Swiss multinational commodity trader Glencore and the Qatar Investment Authority. Officially, the stake was split 50/50 between Glencore and Qatar, but Glencore contributed only €300 million and claims only a 0.54% stake. The ownership structure includes a Cayman Islands company, QHG Cayman Limited, whose ownership can not be traced. After the transaction, Rosneft&#x27;s holding company Rosneftegaz retained 50% + 1 share of the company.

On 2 October 2017, the PLA-linked CEFC China Energy bought a $9 billion stake in Rosneft.

On 26 September 2017, the Russian government controversially approved the former German chancellor Gerhard Schröder as chairman of Rosneft.

In May 2018, it was announced that the Qatar-Glencore consortium is cancelling the plan to sell a $9.1 billion (14%) stake of Rosneft to CEFC China Energy. With the dissolution of the consortium, the Qatar Investment Authority purchased the shares instead, thereby solidifying its position as one of the biggest shareholders (19%) of Rosneft.

In the 2010s, the extensive contact between Rosneft and ExxonMobil were further deepened, with Igor Sechin and Rex Tillerson getting to know each other personally.

====Arctic shelf deals with BP and ExxonMobil====
On 15 January 2011, Rosneft and BP announced a deal to develop the East-Prinovozemelsky field on the Russian arctic shelf between the Yamal Peninsula and Novaya Zemlya island. As part of the deal Rosneft was to receive 5% of BP&#x27;s shares, worth approximately $7.8 billion, as of January 2011 and BP would get approximately 9.5% of Rosneft&#x27;s shares in exchange. According to the deal, the two companies would create an Arctic technology centre in Russia to develop technologies and engineering practices for safe arctic hydrocarbons extraction. AAR, which represents four billionaires of Russian origin and is BP&#x27;s Russian partner in the TNK-BP joint venture, blocked the BP–Rosneft deal in international courts, arguing it breached earlier contracts between BP and AAR. The TNK-BP partners had previously signed a shareholding agreement which stipulated that their Russian joint venture would be the primary corporate vehicle for BP&#x27;s oil and gas operations in Russia. On 30 August 2011, Rosneft announced that instead of BP, the partner for EPNZ-1, EPNZ-2 and EPNZ-3 in the Kara Sea will be ExxonMobil. In exchange, subject to approval by U.S. regulators, in addition to a share in oil production in Russian fields, Rosneft was granted participation in U.S. fields in Texas and the Gulf of Mexico.

====Black Sea shelf deal with ExxonMobil====
On 27 January 2011, Rosneft and the American company ExxonMobil signed a deal to establish a joint venture for the purpose of prospecting and extracting oil from the Tuapse field deepwater area on the Black Sea shelf, near the coast of the Krasnodar Krai. The value of the deal is unknown, but ExxonMobil is expected to invest $1 billion in the project. The venture will be shared 50–50 between the companies during prospecting phase, and two-thirds to one-third in Rosneft&#x27;s favour during the extraction phase. The Tuapse Trough is estimated to contain 7.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent. The first well could be drilled in 2012. The deal also contains options for additional cooperation, such as extended exploration and production, deliveries to Rosneft&#x27;s oil refinery in Tuapse, development of transport infrastructure and research on offshore oil production technologies. According to analysts, offshore areas are central to Rosneft&#x27;s expansionist plans, and the company is looking for foreign cooperation to bring in new technology and share risks.

In April 2017, the Trump administration denied ExxonMobil permission to continue a deal with Rosneft to drill for oil in Russia.

====TNK-BP acquisition====
On 22 October 2012, it was announced that Rosneft will take over TNK-BP International, a parent company of TNK-BP Holding, which is the third largest oil company in Russia. BP will receive in exchange of its stake $12.3 billion of cash and 18.5% of Rosneft&#x27;s share, while ARR received $28 billion in cash. According to Rosneft&#x27;s CEO Igor Sechin, no discussion was held on a buyout of minority shareholders in TNK-BP Holding. The deal was completed on 20 March 2013.

===2020s===
On 27 February 2022, BP announced that it would divest its 19.75% stake in Rosneft in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine that took place in February 2022.

In 2022, Trafigura wound down its relationship with Rosneft, Rosneft asked 2Rivers to take Trafigura&#x27;s place.

The week beginning 19 April 2022, Rosneft attempted to sell millions of barrels of Urals, one of three main export-grade crude oils sold by Russia. The offer failed to attract any customers.

Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine more than half of Rosneft&#x27;s 11-member board had quit, forcing the company into a major reshuffle at its annual general meeting on 30 June 2022. Taieb Belmahdi, a former executive at Qatar&#x27;s state-owned QE, has been elected chairman of the board to replace ex-German chancellor Gerhard Schröder who stepped down in May.

In November 2023 a Rosneft subsidiary &quot;Sakhalinmorneftegaz-Shelf&quot; was given the job of managing Sakhalin-I with an 11.5% interest in the project.

In January 2024, Ukrainian retaliatory drone strikes hit at least four oil and gas terminals across Russia, including Rosneft&#x27;s Tuapse oil terminal on the Black Sea coast.

On 13 March 2024, Ukrainian drones set fire to Rosneft&#x27;s oil refinery in Ryazan, the seventh largest in Russia, causing injuries according to the regional governor. The refinery is responsible for 8% of Russian aviation fuel, 6.4% of gasoline, 4.1% of diesel and 7.7% of fuel oil. Another drone was shot down over the Kirishi refinery, Russia&#x27;s second largest, without causing damage or injuries.

==Sanctions==
On 16 July 2014, the Obama administration imposed sanctions through the US Department of Treasury&#x27;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) by adding Rosneft and other entities to the Sectoral Sanctions List (SSL) in retaliation for the annexation of the Crimean Peninsula by the Kremlin and the ongoing Russian interference in Ukraine. On 12 September 2014 the United Kingdom also sanctioned Rosneft.

The first Trump administration expanded further sanctions on its Swiss-incorporated company (Rosneft Trading S.A.) and its president Didier Casimiro on 18 February 2020, for supporting Venezuela&#x27;s Nicolás Maduro regime by operating in the oil sector of the Venezuelan economy.

In March 2022, as a result of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine the EU imposed sanctions on Rosneft.

Rosneft was sanctioned by New Zealand.

==Operations==
Rosneft&#x27;s daily average crude oil production in 2010 increased by 6.4%, to . Total crude oil output reached of oil and gas condensate. Rosneft is also among the largest natural gas producers in Russia, with a total gas production of in 2010. Rosneft is engaged in exploration and production across all key oil and gas regions of Russia: Western Siberia, Southern and Central Russia, Timan-Pechora, Eastern Siberia, the Far East, and the shelf of Russia&#x27;s Arctic Ocean. As of year-end 2010, Rosneft&#x27;s total proved oil and gas reserves under PRMS classification was of oil equivalent, among the highest for a publicly traded petroleum company worldwide. Rosneft is also second-to-none in terms of total proved liquid hydrocarbon reserves.

In 2016, based on geological prospecting, 13 oil fields and 127 new deposits with the reserves totaling 207 million tons of oil equivalent were discovered. The replacement of hydrocarbon reserves of industrial categories ABC1 amounted to 354 million TOE or 126% of the production in Russia. The replacement factor for new reserves has been significantly above 100% for over ten years.

According to Rosneft, the reserves increment in Western Siberia amounted to 133 million tons of oil and condensate and of natural gas. 37 prospecting and exploration wells tests were completed with a success rate of 89%. 45 new deposits with the total reserve of 59 million tons of AB1С1 + В2С2 were discovered. In Eastern Siberia and the Far East, the total increase in reserves amounted to 21.2 million tons of oil and condensate and of gas. 11 exploration well tests were completed with a success rate of 55%. Five new deposits with reserves of 39 million tons of oil equivalent were discovered. In 2016, the total incremental of gas. 37 well tests were completed with a success rate of 76%.

Rosneft owns and operates seven large refineries in Russia with an aggregate annual capacity of and four mini-refineries. The refineries are able to process about 45% of crude oil produced by Rosneft as a whole. Rosneft owns a 50% stake in Ruhr Oel GmbH, the owner of stakes in four refineries in Germany with overall capacity of 23.2 million tonnes. A 54% stake in the PCK refinery in Schwedt was put into trusteeship by the German government in September 2022 as a result of the Russian attacks on Ukraine. In August 2024, it was revealed that Qatar was planning on purchasing Rosneft’s stakes through negotiations held between the Secretary of State of the German Chancellery, Joerg Kukies, and the CEO of the Qatar Investment Authority, Mansoor Ebrahim Al-Mahmoud. In September 2024, the German government announced it would extend the trusteeship until 10 March 2025, with the anticipation of a sale of assets to Qatar. Rosneft is the second largest national oil company by retail network, which covers 41 regions of Russia and includes 1,800 filling stations. In March 2020, the company stopped its operations in Venezuela and sold all of its assets in the country to another unnamed company that is owned by the Russian government.

Rosneft owns several subsidiaries, amongst which is Rosneftflot, its sea transportation unit to own and manage vessels. By 2018 they had contracted 26 vessels, including 12 polar-capable oil tankers, with Zvezda Shipyard.

At the same time, the composition of the beneficiaries was not disclosed as it was known that the oil company had previously committed to pay $180 million for the right to be the general sponsor of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi.

Since 2012, Rosneft, along with Gazprom, has been the title sponsor of the association football team FC Tom Tomsk based in Tomsk.

Rosneft has been ranked as among the 13th best of 92 oil, gas, and mining companies on indigenous rights and resource extraction in the Arctic.

== Controversies ==

=== Violations of anti-monopoly legislation ===
In October 2009, the Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) imposed on Rosneft a record fine of ₽5.3 billion ($175M) for violating anti-monopoly legislation. The fine was imposed for the abuse of power in the petroleum market recorded in the first half of 2009, which was expressed in the &quot;seizure of goods from circulation, which led to higher prices in the wholesale segment of the oil products market, creating discriminatory conditions for the sale of oil products to individual counter-parties.&quot; As FAS has calculated, these actions led to an increase in prices in the wholesale markets of motor gasoline, diesel fuel, and aviation kerosene in the first half of 2009.

=== Western claims from Yukos Capital ===
On 9 August 2010, a former subsidiary of Yukos, Yukos Capital Sarl of Luxembourg, was seeking to have Rosneft repay the debts of companies that previously belonged to Yukos. After the seizure of Rosneft&#x27;s assets in the United Kingdom and the denial of an appeal by the Supreme Court of the Netherlands, Rosneft said that Yukos Capital paid Yuganskneftegaz its debt of ₽12.9 billion ($426M).

On 16 August 2010, Yukos Capital appealed to the Federal Arbitration Court of the West Siberian District with a cassation appeal against the decision of the Arbitration Court of Tomsk Oblast to refuse reclaiming from Tomskneft, a Rosneft subsidiary, more than ₽7 billion ($231M) under loan agreements. Previously, Yukos Capital applied to international arbitration under the International Chamber of Commerce, and it obliged Tomskneft to pay ₽7,254.2 million ($239M), $275,200, and £52,960, with an interest rate of 9% per annum for the amount of ₽4,350 million ($144M), starting from 12 February 2009 until the day of payment of the debt. The Russian court had to bring the court&#x27;s decision to Russian territory. However, the Arbitration Court of Tomsk Oblast, having considered the claim, ruled to refuse Yukos Capital in debt collection.

=== Ulyukayev lawsuit ===
On 15 December 2017, a Moscow court sentenced Alexei Ulyukayev, a former Russian economy minister to pay ₽130M ($2.2M) and eight years in a penal colony for bribery and corruption. The case was widely seen as Rosneft CEO Sechin’s revenge for Ulyukayev opposing Rosneft’s takeover of Bashneft, another oil company. The 61-year-old claimed that Sechin had lured him to Rosneft&#x27;s offices, where he was subsequently caught red-handed by the authorities with a bag of bribe money. According to investigators, Ulyukayev, who was still economy minister at the time of his arrest, had taken the $2M bribe in exchange for permitting Rosneft&#x27;s acquisition of a stake in Bashneft. Ulyukayev retorted that the &quot;fabricated&quot; accusations of bribery were &quot;based solely on Sechin&#x27;s claims,&quot; and that the whole exchange had been engineered by the Russian Federal Security Service, the successor of the KGB.

Ulyukayev was seen as an economic liberal, Igor Sechin is viewed as a hawk, who supports greater state control over the economy. Ulyukayev, while influential, was not part of President Putin&#x27;s inner circle.

=== Oil spills ===
The Russian branch of Greenpeace called Rosneft the dirtiest oil company in the world. In 2011, according to a survey conducted by the Federal Service for Supervision in the Sphere of Nature Management (Rosprirodnadzor) in Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug, Rosneft allowed 2,727 oil spills, which is 75% of the total number of spills that occurs under the company. According to environmentalists, it is Rosneft&#x27;s fault that more than 10,000 oil spills occur each year. The Hydrometeorological Centre of Russia has estimated that 4.5m tonnes of oil are spilled on the Russian mainland every year, that&#x27;s seven times the BP Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. Often blamed is Rosneft&#x27;s ageing infrastructure, so is the lack of government oversight. As a result of the environmental contamination, people have observed black water coming out of their taps, cattle have been stricken with tuberculosis, and fish have been found deformed.

=== Fracking ===
In the first half of the 2000s, Sergei Bogdanchikov, then president of Rosneft, along with some journalists and experts, criticized Yukos and Sibneft for their use of hydraulic fracturing. However, in early November 2006, a number of journalists pointed out that the Priobskoye oil field of which it is owned by RN-Yuganskneftegaz, a subsidiary of Rosneft acquired from Yukos, produced the largest oil fracture in Russia with specialists of Newco Well Service. The operation was conducted for seven hours and was broadcast live via the Internet to the office of Yuganskneftegaz. In 2007, the company planned to perform hydraulic fracturing of the formation at 440 wells. From 2009 to 2010, Rosneft was one of the largest customers of the oilfield services company Schlumberger, which specializes in hydraulic fracturing.

=== Sanctions ===
On 20 March 2014, the United States government sanctioned Rosneft CEO Igor Sechin in response to the Russian government&#x27;s role in the unrest in Ukraine. The sanctions include a travel ban to the United States, freezing of all assets of Sechin in the United States and a ban on business transactions between American citizens and corporations and Sechin and businesses he owns. On 24 February 2022, his son Ivan Sechin was also sanctioned by the U.S. On 28 February 2022, Igor Sechin was subjected to travel restrictions and had his assets frozen by the EU.

Rosneft and many of its subsidiaries have been sanctioned in the past and appear on the Sectoral Sanctions Identification (SSI) List. Rosneft was added to the SSI on 16 July 2014, and was sanctioned by the EU on 8 September 2014.

On 18 February 2020, the US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (&quot;OFAC&quot;) added Rosneft Trading S.A., a Swiss subsidiary of Rosneft, and its president Didier Casimiro to the Specially Designated Nationals (“SDN”) list.

=== Transparency ===
As of 1 May 2014, the heads of Russian state corporations provided information about their incomes and property to the Russian government to correspond to the presidential decree Anti-Corruption Issues, which was published on 8 July 2013. According to the ruling, websites of the companies should show the personal information of their top managers such as income, property, spouses, and children. However, Rosneft refused to publish its information of top managers, citing that it is only applicable to &quot;state companies (corporations) and other organizations created by federal laws,&quot; to which it does not believe itself to be. However, this did not prevent the company from providing information regarding the incomes and property of Rosneft&#x27;s top managers and their relatives to &quot;competent authorities&quot; in the prescribed &quot;time and amount&quot;. According to the director of the Russian branch of Transparency International, Elena Panfilova, improvement of such legislation is necessary so that state corporations can unequivocally interpret the norm on the publication of personal information. In July, the Russian government announced that information of the income of top management of companies listed in Government Decree No. 613 22 July 2013 which includes Rosneft, &quot;are subject to placement in the information and telecommunications network &#x27;Internet&#x27; on the official websites of these organizations.&quot;

<text>Lucien Germain Guitry (13 December 1860 – 1 June 1925) was a French actor.

==Life==

In 1885, while living in Saint Petersburg, Guitry appeared at the French (or Mikhaylovsky) Theatre. 
His son, the future actor, writer and director Sacha Guitry, was born in Saint Petersburg and named in honour of Tsar Alexander III. 
Lucien met the composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky and his brother Modest, and became good friends with them. 
It was at Guitry&#x27;s instigation that Tchaikovsky wrote both his &quot;Hamlet&quot; Overture-Fantasy (Op. 67a) in 1888, and the Incidental Music to the Shakespeare play (Op. 67b) in 1891, for which he reused the overture-fantasy in shortened form as the overture.

He became prominent on the French stage at the Renaissance theatre (&quot;Les Mauvais bergers&quot;, by Octave Mirbeau), in 1897, then at Porte Saint-Martin theatre in 1900, and the Variétés in 1901. 
He was a member of the Comédie-Française, but resigned in order to become director of the Renaissance, where he was principally associated with the actress Marthe Brandès, who had also left the Comédie. Here, in a number of plays, he established his reputation as one of the greatest contemporary French actors in the drama of modern reality.

In 1920 he went to London, with his son Sacha, and was a success in a play titled &quot;Pasteur&quot;, himself playing the eponymous scientist, and in his son&#x27;s play &quot;Mon Père avait Raison&quot;.

<text>Matt Brann (born 14 November 1980) is a Canadian drummer, mainly known for his work with Avril Lavigne.

==Career==

He started playing drums when he was 12, but it wasn&#x27;t until when he attended Exeter High School that he started to play in a band called Second Opinion along with a few school friends (including Jason McCaslin, who would later go on to become the bassist of Canadian rock band Sum 41) at the age of 14. They played together for about 5 years around their local town and outside of Toronto, Ontario.

His first luck struck at 2002 when a friend of his who was on the same management as Avril Lavigne had just gotten signed and needed to put a band together. Matt called her management Nettwerk and they flew him to New York to meet her. He auditioned for the role of the drummer and successfully became part of Lavigne&#x27;s band. Brann, alongside bandmates, Lavigne and guitarist Evan Taubenfeld, wrote the track &quot;Freak Out&quot; which appeared on Lavigne&#x27;s second album, &quot;Under My Skin&quot;.

He also covered Blur&#x27;s song &quot;Song 2&quot; for Avril Lavigne&#x27;s Bonez Tour, for which Lavigne played the drums, while he contributed the vocals. After being in the 18-month Bonez world tour with Avril, which started in September 2004, he, along with the rest of the band, took a break whilst Lavigne pursued an acting career. During this time, Brann went back to the studio and worked with The New Cities with their albums.

He appeared in the video of &quot;Makes No Difference&quot; by Sum 41. He is the manager of Toronto-based band Organ Thieves which features Sum 41 guitarist Dave Baksh. He recorded and played live drums for The Operation M.D., a garage rock band featuring Jason McCaslin of Sum 41.
