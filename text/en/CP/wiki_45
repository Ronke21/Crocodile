<text>The 1954 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball&#x27;s (MLB) 1954 season. The 51st edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff that matched the National League champion New York Giants against the American League champion Cleveland Indians. The Giants swept the Series in four games to win their first championship since , defeating the heavily favored Indians, who had won an AL-record 111 games in the 154-game regular season (a record since broken by the 1998 New York Yankees with 114 and again by the 2001 Seattle Mariners with 116).

&quot;The Catch&quot; occurred during Game 1 of this series, when Giants center fielder Willie Mays snared a long drive by Vic Wertz near the outfield wall with his back to the infield. Utility player Dusty Rhodes had clutch hits in three of the four games, including a pinch-hit walk-off that won Game 1, barely clearing the right-field fence at the Polo Grounds. Giants manager Leo Durocher, who had managed teams to three National League championships, won his only World Series title as a manager. The Giants, who moved west to San Francisco in 1958, did not win another World Series until 2010.

This was the first time that the Indians had been swept in a World Series and the first time that the Giants had swept an opponent in four games (their 1922 sweep included a controversial tie game). Game 2 was the last World Series and playoff game at the Polo Grounds, and Game 4 was the last World Series and playoff game at Cleveland Stadium. The Indians&#x27; next World Series was in , a year after Jacobs Field opened.

The National Football League game between the Cleveland Browns and Detroit Lions, scheduled for October 3 at Cleveland Stadium, was postponed to December 19. 

This was the first World Series since 1948 to not feature the Yankees and one of only three World Series to not feature them over 18 seasons from 1947 to 1964 (also 1959).

==Background==
The Indians, by winning the American League pennant, kept the Yankees from having a chance to win their sixth straight series. The last time the Yankees had been absent from the World Series was 1948, when the Indians defeated the Boston Braves to win the championship. This was also the only World Series from 1949 to 1958 in which the Yankees did not participate.

The Indians easily won the 1954 pennant on the strength of the American League&#x27;s top pitching staff, leading the AL in team earned run average at 2.72 and complete games with 77. Pitchers Early Wynn (23–11, 2.73 earned run average) and Bob Lemon (23–7, 2.72 earned run average) were in top form, with solid contributions from Mike Garcia (19–8, 2.64) and Art Houtterman (15–7, 3.35). Bob Feller, at age 35, could make only 19 starts, and finished at 13–3. Cleveland also had potent hitting, leading the AL in home runs (156) and finishing second in runs scored (746), although the team managed just 30 stolen bases in 63 attempts. Bobby Ávila led the offense with 112 runs and a .341 batting average, while Larry Doby (.272 batting average, 32 home runs, 126 runs batted in) and Al Rosen (.300 batting average, 24 home runs, 102 runs batted in) provided the power. Catcher Jim Hegan made only four errors in 134 games and threw out 44% of would-be base stealers.

The Giants entered the World Series with a top-flight pitching staff as well, with Johnny Antonelli (21–7, 2.30 earned run average), Rubén Gómez (17–9, 2.88) and 37-year-old Sal &quot;The Barber&quot; Maglie (14–6, 3.26). The Giants relied more heavily on relief pitching with Hoyt Wilhelm (12–7, 2.10, 7 saves) and Marv Grissom (10–7, 2.35, 19 saves) rounding out a staff that led the NL in team earned run average at 3.09 and shutouts with 17. Manager Leo Durocher used a solid, consistent lineup with all of his starters, except for the catching position, playing in at least 135 games. Willie Mays (.345 batting average, 41 home runs, 110 runs batted in) led an offense that also featured Don Mueller (.342 batting average), Alvin Dark (.293 batting average, 98 runs), Hank Thompson (26 home runs, 86 runs batted in) and pinch-hitter extraordinaire Dusty Rhodes (.341 batting average).

==Summary==
==Matchups==

===Game 1===


Cleveland got on the board right away against Sal Maglie. Leadoff man Al Smith was hit by a pitch, Bobby Ávila singled and Vic Wertz brought home both with a triple to right. Don Liddle and Marv Grissom held them scoreless for the rest of the game.

Bob Lemon gave two back in the third on singles by Whitey Lockman and Alvin Dark, a run-scoring groundout by Don Mueller, a walk to Willie Mays and a Hank Thompson run-scoring single.

Mays saved the day in the eighth after leadoff singles by Larry Doby and Al Rosen led to starting pitcher Maglie being lifted for Liddle. Wertz&#x27;s drive to deep center field would have scored both if not for Mays&#x27; memorable catch.

Wertz opened the 10th inning with another hard-hit ball in Mays’ direction, which again would have required a great defensive play by the Giants&#x27; centerfielder but landed for a double. (Wertz thus ended his afternoon having gone 4-for-5 with three extra-base hits and batting in the Indians’ two runs.) However, this potential 10th-inning rally was to no avail, as the Indians batted only 1-for-16 with runners in scoring position in the game, and went hitless (0-for-13) in such situations after Wertz’s two-run triple in the first inning.

Lemon went all the way for Cleveland, losing it in the 10th when Dusty Rhodes, pinch-hitting for Monte Irvin with two Giants on base, hit a walk-off home run.

===Game 2===

Once again, the visitors started quickly but could not hold their lead. Al Smith&#x27;s leadoff home run off Johnny Antonelli put Cleveland up 1–0. Early Wynn preserved that lead, pitching four perfect innings, but in the fifth inning, Willie Mays walked and Hank Thompson singled, and Dusty Rhodes, again pinch-hitting for Monte Irvin, delivered a run-scoring single. Antonelli gave himself the go-ahead run by scoring Thompson on a groundout. New York had just four hits, but Rhodes padded the Giants&#x27; lead with a home run leading off the seventh. Their other hit came in the sixth inning on an Alvin Dark leadoff single. Antonelli walked six but struck out nine, pitching a complete game to give the Giants a 2–0 series lead. This was the last postseason game at the Polo Grounds.

===Game 3===

A huge crowd of 71,555 hoped to see Cleveland get its first win, but things did not go well for the home team. The Indians trailed 1–0 quickly when Whitey Lockman singled, took second on a groundout and scored on a hit by Willie Mays. The run was scored as unearned because of an error by shortstop George Strickland. With the bases loaded in the third, pinch hitter Dusty Rhodes hit a two-run single. An error by pitcher Mike Garcia on Davey Williams&#x27; bunt attempt gave the Giants another run to make it 4–0. The Giants added to their lead on run-scoring singles by Wes Westrum off of Art Houtteman in the fifth and by Mays off of Ray Narleski in the sixth. Ruben Gomez gave up just four hits and two runs (a Vic Wertz home run in the seventh and an error by shortstop Alvin Dark on a ground ball by Al Smith), with knuckleballer Hoyt Wilhelm mopping up for the save.

===Game 4===


Cleveland&#x27;s slim comeback chances took a beating as the Indians fell hopelessly behind, 7–0. The scoring started on a pair of Cleveland errors in the second inning. A run-scoring double by Mays in the third scored another run. The Giants&#x27; four-run fifth inning broke the game wide open. Starter Bob Lemon loaded the bases and was pulled for Hal Newhouser, who faced just two batters, giving up a walk to Thompson and two-run single to Irvin. The Giants added another run in the inning on Wes Westrum&#x27;s sacrifice fly against Ray Narleski. A brief glimmer of hope for the home team came in the bottom of the fifth with a couple of Giants errors and a Hank Majeski three-run pinch-hit home run, but except for a meaningless run-scoring single by Rudy Regalado in the seventh off starter Don Liddle, the Indians got nothing more as Hoyt Wilhelm and Game 2 starter Johnny Antonelli came on in relief and the Giants completed a four-game sweep. It was the most unexpected sweep in World Series history, with the Indians having a better regular reason record by 14 games. The only other similar discrepancy in a World Series sweep was the 1990 Cincinnati Reds, who swept an Oakland A&#x27;s team whose regular season record bested theirs by 12 games. This was also the last World Series before the official World Series MVP award began to be awarded in 1955, though Dusty Rhodes would have been a lock for the award if it had been introduced yet. The Giants also became only the non-Yankees team ever to sweep a four-game World Series, joining the Boston Braves in 1914.

<doc id="1332375" wikidata="Q5570487" url="?curid=1332375" title="Larry Centers">
<text>Larry Eugene Centers (born June 1, 1968) is an American former professional football player who was a fullback in the National Football League (NFL) for 14 seasons, mostly the Phoenix / Arizona Cardinals (1990–1998). Centers then played for the Washington Redskins (1999–2000), the Buffalo Bills (2001–2002), and finally was a member of the New England Patriots, with whom he won a Super Bowl.

Centers played college football for the Stephen F. Austin Lumberjacks. One of the most prolific pass catching running backs in NFL history, he topped 100 receptions in 1995 and had 99 receptions in 1996. He owns the NFL record for most passes caught by a running back during a career. He was selected to the Pro Bowl in 1995, 1996, and 2001.

==Early life==
Centers was born in Tatum, Texas and grew up in Longview. He began playing little league football for the Bramlette Bears as a running back and quarterback during his elementary school years and went on to play in middle school for the Forest Park Eagles and high school for the Longview Lobos until his junior year. He played on both sides of the ball as a defensive back and runnningback and wide receiver. Centers did not play football at all his junior year of high school. After his family moved to nearby Tatum, where his mother was an administrator in education, Centers decided to play football again after being urged to do so by his elder brother. After a solid season in Tatum, he earned a scholarship to nearby Stephen F. Austin State University. He was also recruited by Baylor, Texas Tech, and several junior colleges. His brother, Donnie, played for the University of Arkansas and coach Lou Holtz as a wide receiver.

==College career==
After being recruited as a running back, wide receiver, and a defensive back, Centers began his college football career with the Division I-AA Stephen F. Austin Lumberjacks as a wide receiver. As a freshman, he broke his pinky finger on his left hand and was then assigned to play scout team running back and special teams. In his sophomore season against Nevada, an injury to the team&#x27;s starting running back allowed Centers a chance to play. In the win, Centers rushed nine times for 96 yards and finished the season with 100-plus rushing yards in each of the remaining six games. He also led the Lumberjacks in receptions, rushing yards and yards from scrimmage during his junior and senior years. Centers was a two-time all-Southland Conference pick and set a school record for rushing yards in his senior season. In 1989, with Centers as their starting running back, the Lumberjacks advanced to the 1989 NCAA Division I-AA Football Championship Game where they lost by a field goal to the Georgia Southern Eagles.

==Professional career==
===Phoenix/Arizona Cardinals===
After graduating from Stephen F. Austin State University, Centers was selected by the Phoenix Cardinals in the fifth round of the 1990 NFL draft. He saw limited playing time in his first two seasons, as head coach Joe Bugel had doubts on his ability to carry the ball and thought of him as a third-down running back. According to his coaches, Centers particularly needed work on his pass protection skills and he spent an entire off-season mastering the capability. His playing time started to increase and by 1992, Centers rushed for 139 yards and caught 50 passes for 417 yards. On October 4, 1992, Centers scored the winning touchdown against the Washington Redskins with less than a minute remaining to break an 11-game Cardinals losing streak. The game-winning touchdown was the first of Centers&#x27; NFL career.

The role of the fullback as a ball carrier was starting to diminish as the NFL game evolved during the 1990s. Yet, Centers&#x27;s offensive numbers only increased as the years went by, especially his receptions and his leadership ability. He caught 66 passes in his fourth NFL season. In 1994, Bugel was fired and replaced by Buddy Ryan. Ryan allowed Centers more opportunity to run with the ball, carrying the ball a career-high 115 times while catching 77 receptions. In 1995, Centers had one of the greatest seasons ever of any modern day fullback, recording 101 receptions for 962 yards. He became the first runningback to record 100 receptions. He held the record for most receptions by a running back with 101 until this record was broken by Matt Forte in 2014 with 102. He also rushed for 254 yards, scored four touchdowns, and was selected to the Pro Bowl for the first time. Unfortunately, his team was not successful despite his contributions; they finished the 1995 season with a 4–12 record and Ryan was fired at the end of the year and replaced by Vince Tobin.

In 1996, Centers recorded 99 receptions for 766 yards and seven touchdowns, while also gaining a career-high 425 yards on 116 carries, and he scored two touchdowns on the ground. He was selected to the Pro Bowl for the second year in a row, but once again his team had a disappointing season, finishing with a 7–9 record. Centers became a free agent after the season. Both the Washington Redskins and the New York Giants were interested in his services, but ultimately he signed a three-year, $7.5 million contract to stay with the Cardinals after switching agents, becoming the fifth highest paid running back in the league. After previously leading the team in receptions the last four seasons, the Cardinals started to try Centers in different offensive formations at wide receiver. Centers continued to be a major contributor to the Cardinals, recording 123 receptions and 386 rushing yards over the next two seasons. In his final year with Arizona (1998), the team recorded a 9–7 record and made the playoffs as a wild card. The Cardinals made it all the way to the divisional playoffs before being eliminated in a 41–21 loss to the Minnesota Vikings. Centers finished his Cardinals career as the team&#x27;s all-time leading pass catcher.

===Washington Redskins===
Citing durability and salary cap concerns, the Cardinals released Centers on June 19, 1999. At the time of his release, Centers was considered &quot;the heart and soul&quot; of the Cardinals offense. He signed with the Washington Redskins and quickly became a team leader, recording 69 receptions in his first season with the team. During a crucial game against the 49ers, Centers caught a 33-yard touchdown pass in overtime, which made the Redskins the NFC Eastern division champs for the first time since 1991 and gave the team a playoff berth. The Redskins finished the regular season with a 10–6 record but were eliminated in the divisional playoffs by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, 14–13. The following year, he caught 81 passes for 600 yards, rushed for 103 yards, and used his blocking to help running back Stephen Davis achieve star numbers, 1,318 rushing yards and 11 touchdowns. He passed Keith Byars for most receptions by a running back. However, the Redskins recorded only an 8–8 record that year and did not make the playoffs.

===Buffalo Bills===
In 2001, Centers signed with the Buffalo Bills and made it to his third Pro Bowl appearance, catching 80 passes, this time for a total of 620 yards, with 160 yards rushing and four touchdowns. In the fourth quarter of a 23–20 loss against the Seattle Seahawks, he surpassed Ronnie Harmon&#x27;s record for most receiving yards by an NFL running back with a two-yard reception. He also surpassed Hall of Famers Charlie Joiner and Michael Irvin to reach the top ten in all-time receptions by a player.

===New England Patriots===
After spending another year with Buffalo, Centers joined the Patriots in 2003. By this time, 35-year-old Centers&#x27; role as a receiver (along with ball carrier) had diminished. He was released after the sixth game of the season due to a knee injury, before re-signing with the Patriots in December. He recorded 19 receptions for 106 yards and rushed for 82 yards. Still, his blocking contributions as part of the Patriots offense allowed him to earn a Super Bowl ring; New England finished the season with a 14–2 record and went on to defeat the Carolina Panthers 32–29 in Super Bowl XXXVIII.

Centers retired from professional football before the beginning of the 2004 season.

===Career achievements===
In his 14 NFL seasons, Centers rushed for 2,188 yards, caught 827 passes for 6,797 yards, returned five punts for 30 yards, returned 33 kickoffs for 617 yards and scored 42 touchdowns (14 rushing/28 receiving).

Centers&#x27; 827 receptions are currently the most by any running back and were the most by any non-wide receiver in NFL history, until tight end Tony Gonzalez surpassed this mark in 2008. He caught passes in 128 consecutive games, at one point the third longest streak in the NFL. When Centers retired, he was seventh in passes caught in league history. Because NFL fullbacks are now almost exclusively used as blockers, Centers is widely recognized as one of the greatest pass receiving fullbacks.

<text>The 1955 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball&#x27;s (MLB) 1955 season. The 52nd edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff that matched the National League (NL) champion Brooklyn Dodgers against the American League (AL) champion New York Yankees, with the Dodgers winning the Series in seven games to capture their first championship in franchise history. It would be the only Series the Dodgers won while based in Brooklyn, as the team relocated to Los Angeles after the . This was the fifth time in nine years that the Yankees and the Dodgers met in the World Series, with the Yankees having won in , , , and ; the Yankees would also win in the rematch.

This Series also marked the end of a long period of invulnerability for the Yankees in the World Series. It was the Yankees&#x27; first loss in a World Series since and only their second since . The Yankees were 15–2 in Series appearances prior to the start of the 1956 season. The 1955 run would start a new run of Series appearances for New York that saw them reach the Series eight more times in the span of ten seasons, where they lost four times (, , , and ).

==Background==
This was the sixth World Series contested between the Yankees and Dodgers; the Yankees had won each of the five prior matchups (1941, 1947, 1949, 1952, and 1953); each team had changed their manager several times (New York twice and Brooklyn thrice). New York manager Casey Stengel had played for the Dodgers from 1912 through 1917.

===Brooklyn Dodgers===
The NL champion Dodgers, as managed by second-year skipper Walter Alston, finished the regular season with a record of 98–55, games ahead of the Milwaukee Braves. Offensive team leaders were Duke Snider (.309 batting average, 42 home runs, 136 RBIs, .628 slugging percentage, and 1.046 OPS) and Roy Campanella (.318 batting average, 32 home runs, 107 RBIs, .583 slugging percentage, and .978 OPS). Pitcher Don Newcombe led the team in wins, with a 20–5 record, and innings pitched. Campanella was voted the National League MVP, narrowly edging Snider.

===New York Yankees===

The AL champion Yankees finished the regular season with a record of 96–58, three games ahead of the Cleveland Indians. Offensive team leaders were Mickey Mantle (.306 batting average, 37 home runs, 99 RBIs, .611 slugging percentage, and 1.042 OPS), Yogi Berra (.272 batting average, 27 home runs, 108 RBIs, .470 slugging percentage, and .819 OPS), and Bill Skowron (.319 batting average). Pitcher Whitey Ford led the team in wins, with an 18–7 record, and innings pitched. Berra was voted the American League MVP, while Mantle finished fifth.

==Summary==
==Matchups==
===Game 1===


In Game 1, Carl Furillo&#x27;s leadoff home run in the second off Whitey Ford put the Dodgers up 1–0. Jackie Robinson then tripled with one out and scored on Don Zimmer&#x27;s single, but in the bottom of the inning, after a walk, rookie Elston Howard, in his first World Series at bat, homered to tie the game off Don Newcombe. Duke Snider&#x27;s leadoff home run next inning put the Dodgers back in front 3–2 (which would eventually help establish a new HR record for a seven-game series at 17), but in the bottom half, the Yankees again tied the score on Irv Noren&#x27;s RBI groundout with runners on second and third. Joe Collins&#x27;s leadoff home run next inning put the Yankees ahead 4–3. His two-run home run in the sixth extended their lead to 6–3. In the eighth, after a single and error by third baseman Gil McDougald put runners on second and third with one out, Zimmer&#x27;s sacrifice fly scored a run, then Robinson stole home to cut the Yankees&#x27; lead to 6–5, but Ford pitched eight innings for the win while Bob Grim earned the save with a scoreless ninth to give the Yankees a 1–0 series lead.

====Robinson&#x27;s steal of home====
Jackie Robinson&#x27;s successful steal of home plate in the 8th inning became a subject of debate between baseball fans that still lingers today. For years, both Yogi Berra and Whitey Ford argued that Robinson was easily out, with Ford pointing out that he knew Robinson was far off of third base, and deliberately did a longer wind-up, instead of pitching from the stretch as pitchers normally do with runners on base, to entice Robinson into trying to steal home plate. Berra claimed that he was able to catch the ball and placed his glove in position for Robinson to slide into the tag. The official World Series newsreel footage was inconclusive, as well as all widely printed photographs. A lesser-known film taken of the play, filmed from the third-base side, showed that Robinson&#x27;s foot touched the third-base side of home plate, while Berra&#x27;s glove, with the ball, was briefly on the first-base side before applying the tag, though many baseball fans, particularly Yankee fans, still argue otherwise.

===Game 2===


In Game 2, Pee Wee Reese lead off the top of the fourth with a double and scored on Duke Snider&#x27;s single off Tommy Byrne, but in the bottom of the inning, after a two-out single and walk, back-to-back RBI singles by Elston Howard and Billy Martin put the Yankees ahead. After a hit-by-pitch loaded the bases, Byrne&#x27;s two-run single put the Yankees up 4–1 and knocked starter Billy Loes out of the game. The Dodgers got a run in the fifth on Jim Gilliam&#x27;s RBI single with Jackie Robinson at third, but could not score again off Byrne, who pitched a complete game to give the Yankees a 2–0 series lead heading to Brooklyn.

===Game 3===


In Game 3, Roy Campanella&#x27;s two-run home run after a walk off Bob Turley in the first put the Dodgers up 2–0, but in the second, Mickey Mantle, who only played in 3 games in this series, hit his only home run of the series. Bill Skowron then doubled and scored on Phil Rizzuto&#x27;s two-out single to tie the game. In the bottom of the inning, two singles and a hit-by-pitch loaded the bases before walks to Jim Gilliam off Turley and Pee Wee Reese off Tom Morgan put the Dodgers up 4–2. In the fourth with two on, Campanella&#x27;s RBI single and Carl Furillo&#x27;s sacrifice fly extended the Dodgers&#x27; lead to 6–2. In the top of the seventh, Rizzuto walked with two outs and scored on Andy Carey&#x27;s triple, but in the bottom half, Jackie Robinson doubled with one out off Tom Sturdivant and scored on Sandy Amoros&#x27;s single. After a forceout and walk, Reese&#x27;s RBI single extended the Dodgers&#x27; lead to 8–3. Johnny Podres pitched a complete game as the Dodgers cut the Yankees&#x27; series lead to 2–1. This remains the last World Series game to be played in the month of September.

===Game 4===


Gil McDougald&#x27;s one-out home run in the first off Carl Erskine put the Yankees up 1–0. In the second, Joe Collins drew a leadoff walk, moved two bases on two groundouts, and scored on Phil Rizzuto&#x27;s single. In the third, Sandy Amoros drew a leadoff walk off Don Larsen and scored on Jim Gilliam&#x27;s RBI double. In the top of the fourth, after a leadoff walk and single, Don Bessent relieved Erksine and allowed an RBI single to Billy Martin, but in the bottom of the inning, Roy Campanella hit a leadoff home run and after a single, Gil Hodges&#x27;s two-run home run put the Dodgers up 4–3. Duke Snider&#x27;s three-run home run next inning off Johnny Kucks extended their lead to 7–3. In the top of the sixth, Elston Howard hit a leadoff single off Clem Labine and scored on Billy Martin&#x27;s double. One out later, Eddie Robinson&#x27;s RBI single cut the Dodgers&#x27; lead to 7–5, but the Dodgers added a run in the seventh on three consecutive leadoff singles by Campanella, Carl Furillo and Gil Hodges off Rip Coleman. Labine earned the win with innings to close as the Dodgers tied the series with an 8–5 win.

===Game 5===
October 2, 1955, at Ebbets Field in Brooklyn, New York
In Game 5, Sandy Amoros&#x27;s two-run homer in the second off Bob Grim put the Dodgers up 2–0. Next inning, Duke Snider&#x27;s lead off home run made it 3–0. The Yankees got on the board in the fourth on Billy Martin&#x27;s RBI single with two off rookie Roger Craig, but Snider&#x27;s second home run of the game in the fifth gave the Dodgers that run back. Home runs by Bob Cerv in the seventh off Craig and Yogi Berra in the eighth off Clem Labine cut the Dodgers&#x27; lead to 4–3, but Brooklyn added an insurance run in the bottom of the eighth off Bob Turley when Carl Furillo hit a leadoff single, moved to second on a sacrifice bunt, and scored on Jackie Robinson&#x27;s single. Labine pitched innings in relief for Craig, who won his first World series start, for the save as the Dodgers were one win away from the championship. Snider became the only player from either league with four home runs in two different Series.

===Game 6===


In Game 6, the Yankees scored all five of their runs in the first off Karl Spooner. After two walks, back-to-back RBI singles by Yogi Berra and Hank Bauer put them up 2–0 before Bill Skowron capped the scoring with a three-run home run. Whitey Ford pitched a complete game, allowing one run (on Carl Furillo&#x27;s RBI single in the fourth) and four hits as the Yankees forced a Game 7 with a 5–1 win.

===Game 7===


The Dodgers scored the game&#x27;s only runs on a fourth inning RBI single and sixth inning bases-loaded sacrifice fly, both by Gil Hodges. The RBIs by Hodges were set up by a double by Roy Campanella in the fourth and a lead-off single by Pee Wee Reese in the sixth — the only time a Dodgers lead-off hitter reached base in any inning. While Campanella scored on Hodges&#x27; two-out single, Reese had advanced to third on two bunts.

While being shut out by Johnny Podres, the Yankees, meanwhile, scattered eight hits over the six innings in which they were not retired in order. They only mustered one hit with runners in scoring position, though, which ironically was a base hit awarded to Gil McDougald in the third inning, when Phil Rizzuto was hit by a groundball while running the bases. Instead of batting in Rizzuto for a 1–0 Yankees lead, McDougald was thus ruled out to end the inning. Psychologically this may have marked a turning point for the Dodgers, who had never beaten the Yankees in a World Series. Pitcher Carl Erskine saw this play as &quot;an omen&quot;, as such unfortunate miscues had usually been &quot;the things that happened to us.&quot;

The Yankees would have three more scoring opportunities against Podres: In the fourth inning, a lead-off double by Yogi Berra was wasted. Then, in the sixth inning, with runners on first and second and one out, left fielder Sandy Amorós made a dramatic game-saving catch of a deep fly ball down the left field line off the bat of Yogi Berra to start a double play. Amorós then threw to Pee Wee Reese and Reese relayed to Gil Hodges, who tagged Yankee Gil McDougald before McDougald could get back to first. This possibly stymied the Yankees&#x27; best chance of the day.

The Yankees would threaten Podres one last time, when McDougald could not bring a runner in from third with only one out, hitting a short flyball to rightfield, one inning before Elston Howard grounded out to Reese for the final out; the two shared the dubious record for playing in the most losing World Series (six each).

This would be the only time in Jackie Robinson&#x27;s career when he did not play in his team&#x27;s World Series game. Don Hoak replaced Robinson in the line-up, and played third base.

For the first time in Series history, an MVP was selected—Johnny Podres, winning pitcher of Games 3 and 7. He won and pitched complete games in both of his starts including the series-clinching Game 7 shutout, and recorded 10 strikeouts, two earned runs off 15 hits, and a 1.00 ERA in 18 total innings pitched.

==Legacy==
===References in popular culture===
In her epistolary book (and later stage and film adaptations) 84 Charing Cross Road, the author Helene Hanff reveals herself to be a Brooklyn Dodgers fan and asks her correspondent Frank Doel (along with family) to pray for the Dodgers&#x27; fortunes in the series: (sic.) &quot;I shall be obliged if you will send Nora and the girls to church every Sunday for the next month to pray for the continued health and strength of the messrs. Gilliam, Reese, Snider, Campanella, Robinson, Hodges, Furillo, Podres, Newcombe and Labine, collectively known as The Brooklyn Dodgers. If they lose this World Series I shall Do Myself In and then where will you be?&quot;

Singer Billy Joel referenced the Dodgers&#x27; victory in his single &quot;We Didn&#x27;t Start the Fire&quot; with the line &quot;Brooklyn&#x27;s got a winning team&quot;.

===50th Anniversary===
Commemorating the 50th anniversary of the franchise winning its first World Series (and only one while in Brooklyn), the Los Angeles Dodgers held a &quot;weekend celebration in August [of 2005 …] for the 11 surviving members of the 1955&quot; team.

The weekend before the anniversary, an autograph session was held in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, featuring Game 7 hero Johnny Podres and, interestingly, two Dodgers who were not on the 1955 team — Ralph Branca, who had left the club in 1953 before returning in 1956, and Joe Pignatano, who joined the Dodgers in 1957.

No official commemorative event, however, took place in Brooklyn on October 4, 2005 (the actual anniversary of the Dodgers&#x27; triumph), prompting author Thomas Oliphant to argue that &quot;on both coasts, we could have done a little bit better, especially for such an important memory.&quot;

That being said, a small gathering of ten people took place at the site of Ebbets Field on October 4, 2005 &quot;at 3:43 pm, 50 years to the minute from when the Brooklyn Dodgers won their only World Series.&quot; &quot;Brooklyn Paper&quot; journalist Ed Shakespeare reported that &quot;[a]ll of the attendees came alone or in pairs, unaware of who else might attend&quot;, describing the event as &quot;a sharing of memories from those who remembered.&quot;

==Aftermath==
For the Yankees, who appeared in and won five consecutive World Series titles from 1949 to 1953, this was the first loss for a Casey Stengel-led team. They won a rematch against the Dodgers the following year, then made three more trips to the World Series during Stengel&#x27;s tenure, winning in 1958 and losing in 1957 (to Milwaukee) and 1960 (to Pittsburgh). Like this fall classic, Stengel&#x27;s final four trips as manager went the maximum seven games.

For the Dodgers, this was the peak of their success while based in Brooklyn. Three years later, they left Ebbets Field and moved to Los Angeles. Since that time, they have played in 12 World Series, winning seven titles, most recently in .

Dodgers pitcher Johnny Podres was the recipient of the very first World Series Most Valuable Player award.

As of 2024, Sandy Koufax, although he was not on the World Series roster, is the last living player from the champion Dodgers.

<text>Rayet is a small lunar impact crater that lies on the far side of the Moon, past the northeast limb. It lies to the southwest of the larger crater Millikan, and east of the comparably sized Petrie.

This crater is roughly circular in shape, with a sharp edge and relatively featureless inner walls that slope downward to the nearly level interior floor. The diameter of the floor is roughly two-thirds that of the crater. This formation has not been notably worn by impact erosion, and is otherwise undistinguished.

This feature was named after the French astronomer Georges Rayet (1839–1906) by the IAU in 1970. 

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Rayet.

<text>The 1957 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball&#x27;s 1957 season. The 54th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff that matched the American League (AL) champion and defending World Series champion New York Yankees against the National League (NL) champion Milwaukee Braves. After finishing just one game behind the NL champion Brooklyn Dodgers in 1956, the Braves came back in 1957 to win their first pennant since moving from Boston in 1953. The Braves won the Series in seven games, behind Lew Burdette&#x27;s three complete game victories. In the decade of the 1950s, the Braves would be fourth different team and the only non-New York based team to win the World Series. The other 3, the Yankees, Dodgers, and Giants were all based in New York at the time, but at the end of the 1957 season, both the Giants and Dodgers moved to west to California for the 1958 season. In the decade of the 1950s, the Yankees won six world championships (1950-53, 56, &amp; 58), the Dodgers won two (1955 in Brooklyn &amp; 59 in Los Angeles), and the Giants (1954) and Braves won only one. 

The Yankees had home field advantage in the series. Games 1, 2, 6, and 7 were played at Yankee Stadium, while Milwaukee County Stadium hosted Games 3, 4, and 5. This was the first time since 1946 that the Series included scheduled off days after Games 2 and 5. As of 2024, this was the last seven game World Series that ended at Yankee Stadium

Of the previous ten World Series, the Yankees had participated in eight of them and won seven. This was also the first World Series since 1948 that a team from New York did not win every game.

This is the first of four Yankees-Braves matchups, and the only Series that was won by the Braves; they lost in , and , with the last two instances occurring with the Braves based in Atlanta.

Hank Aaron led all regulars with a .393 average and 11 hits, including a triple, three home runs and seven RBI.

Milwaukee’s victory marked the first Wisconsin pro championship won by a team other than the Green Bay Packers.

==Summary==


Note: It was the Braves&#x27; first championship since the &quot;Miracle Braves&quot; of 1914.

==Matchups==

===Game 1===


In the third inning, the Yankees replaced first baseman Bill Skowron, who was complaining of back pain, with Elston Howard. In the fifth inning the Braves had a runner in scoring position after an error by Howard. The Braves did not manage to capitalize on this opportunity, as second baseman Red Schoendienst grounded out. By the end of the fifth inning, the Braves had left four men on base, with the game still scoreless.

The Yankees broke through that inning with a leadoff single by Jerry Coleman, followed by two ground outs which moved the runner to third base, and then a triple by slugger Hank Bauer made the score 1–0. After three consecutive batters reached first base in the Yankees&#x27; half of the sixth inning, and a run scored on Andy Carey&#x27;s single, Milwaukee manager Fred Haney pulled starter Warren Spahn and replaced him with Ernie Johnson.

The Yankees scored once more in the sixth inning when Coleman executed a squeeze play, allowing Yogi Berra to score from third base. The Braves managed to score only once, when Wes Covington scored in the seventh on a single by Schoendienst. Whitey Ford pitched a complete game for the Yankees.
===Game 2===


Hank Aaron led off the second inning with a triple, then made it safe at home on Joe Adcock&#x27;s single. The Yankees responded with one of their own in the bottom half of the second. Again in the third inning, the Yankees and Braves each scored one run, leaving the score 2–2 heading to the fourth inning. Both managers were worried about their starting pitchers, and after three straight singles from Adcock, Andy Pafko, and Wes Covington and with two runs in, Yankees manager Casey Stengel replaced Bobby Shantz with reliever Art Ditmar. Ditmar had finished the regular season with an 8–3 record, a 3.25 ERA and six saves.

Ditmar was able to prevent the Braves from scoring any more runs, but the score was 4–2 in favor of the Braves. After that, Braves starter Lew Burdette&#x27;s pitching improved significantly. He only gave up four hits for the rest of the game, two of them coming in the ninth inning. After a ground out, Tony Kubek singled to right to start things off. Stengel decided to pinch hit lefty Joe Collins, who was 30–for–149 (.201) that year and was playing what turned out to be his final year, for the right-handed Coleman, who was a better 42–for–157 (.263) and also playing in his final season, to face right-handed pitcher Burdette. Collins popped to Johnny Logan at shortstop for the second out. Then, Stengel again opted to pinch hit for the pitcher, Bob Grim. Howard came up in his spot and singled to advance Kubek to second. Bobby Richardson pinch ran for Howard. Burdette recorded the final out as he got Bauer, the next batter, to ground to short, where Logan forced out Richardson.

The Braves&#x27; win in Game 2 was the first World Series game won by a non-New York City team since 1948. In every World Series between 1948 and 1957, either both teams were from New York City or a New York City team won in a sweep (1950 and 1954).

===Game 3===


New York&#x27;s Tony Kubek began the scoring with a one-out solo homer in the first inning. After that, things quickly fell apart for Bob Buhl, who had pitched quite well in the regular season (18–7, 2.74 ERA). He walked Mickey Mantle and Yogi Berra, then made an error attempting to pick Mantle off at second base. After a sacrifice fly by Gil McDougald and a single by first baseman Harry Simpson, manager Fred Haney pulled Buhl and brought in rookie Juan Pizarro. Pizarro got the final out in the first inning, and followed that with a solid second inning. In the third inning, however, the Yankees began to capitalize on their lead. After allowing hits from Mantle, Berra and Jerry Lumpe, and a walk to Elston Howard, who was pinch-hitting for Harry Simpson, Pizarro was removed from the game. Gene Conley was called in to finish the inning. He did get the last two outs, but gave up a two-run home run to Mantle in the fourth inning.

By the bottom of the fifth inning, the score was 7–1 in favor of the Yankees. Logan led off with a single, and Eddie Mathews flied to left. Hank Aaron hit one of his three postseason homers to make the game 7–3. After a Covington walk, Joe Adcock and Bob Hazle each made outs to end the fifth. Yankees relief pitcher Don Larsen had his comfortable lead cut down to just four runs.

In the seventh inning the Yankees secured their lead with a five-run inning against reliever Bob Trowbridge. The five runs started with a two-run bases-loaded single by Bauer and a three-run home run by Kubek. The score was 12–3 heading into the bottom of the seventh.

There was only one more hit the rest of the game, a single by Aaron in the ninth. Del Crandall made the last out and the series was on to Game 4 with the Yankees up 2–1. Left fielder Kubek was only the second rookie in history to hit two home runs in a World Series game. This was the first World Series game played in the state of Wisconsin.

===Game 4===


After a game with two homers and four RBIs, Tony Kubek led off the first inning for the Yankees, laying down a bunt which ultimately led to a run after Mickey Mantle reached on a fielder&#x27;s choice, Yogi Berra walked, and Gil McDougald singled.

The second inning started with a single by Hank Aaron and then a stolen base by Wes Covington, but they could not convert. The fourth inning began with a walk to Johnny Logan. Eddie Mathews doubled to right field, which sent Logan to third. Aaron then hit a three-run home run which completely cleared the stadium. The next batter, Covington, grounded out. This was followed by a shot off the bat of Frank Torre, a part-time first baseman who was giving Joe Adcock a day off. The Braves were then up 4–1 against Yankees starter Tom Sturdivant.

The next four innings for the Yankees were plagued by double plays. Warren Spahn was getting ground out after ground out and the Yankees looked helpless until the ninth. With two outs and a three-run deficit in the top of the ninth, New York found new life in two back-to-back singles. Spahn gave up one to Berra, followed by one to McDougald. With two runners on, Howard hit a three-run homer to tie the game.

Left-handed Tommy Byrne had replaced right-handed Johnny Kucks in the eighth inning for New York. This prompted Haney to pinch hit Adcock for Torre. Adcock grounded to shortstop and Milwaukee went 1–2–3 that inning. The game thus went on to extra innings.

Milwaukee starter Spahn came out for the tenth. Kubek got his second hit in the top of the tenth, followed by a triple by Hank Bauer to score a run. After Mantle flied to right, the Braves got ready for the bottom of the tenth down one. Spahn was due up first for the Braves, and Haney opted to pinch hit with Nippy Jones, who had played in just 30 games that year. In what turned out to be his final appearance, Jones was part of a pivotal play in the inning. A wild Tommy Byrne pitch bounced near Jones, but umpire Donatelli initially called a ball. After an argument hinging on a spot of shoe polish on the baseball, Jones convinced umpire Augie Donatelli that he was hit on the shoe.

The inning continued with Felix Mantilla running for Jones. Red Schoendienst hit a sacrifice bunt to advance Mantilla, who scored the tying run on a double by Logan. Mathews followed with a towering two-run home run to win it for the Braves, 7–5, and tied the series at two games apiece.

===Game 5===


With the opposing teams&#x27; top pitchers, Whitey Ford and Lew Burdette, facing each other, Game 5 was expected to be a low-scoring affair. However, the game started out with the Yankees looking to score in the first inning. After a leadoff single by Hank Bauer and a sacrifice bunt by Tony Kubek, Gil McDougald hit a line drive that turned into the second out of the inning. Yogi Berra then grounded out. After that, Burdette only allowed multiple Yankee baserunners in the fourth inning.

At the start of the sixth inning, the game was still scoreless. In the bottom of the sixth with two outs and nobody on, Eddie Mathews, Hank Aaron, and Joe Adcock singled, scoring Mathews and giving the Braves a 1–0 lead that held up for the rest of the game.

The Yankees&#x27; best scoring chance came in the eighth inning after a hit by Jerry Coleman to right field. Mickey Mantle came in to pinch-run for Coleman, but was caught stealing at second base by catcher Del Crandall. Ford was then taken out and Yankee reliever Bob Turley came in, striking out two batters while giving up no hits in the inning.

Yogi Berra made the last Yankee out in the 1–0 complete-game by Burdette, and the Milwaukee Braves took the series lead three games to two.

===Game 6===

Bob Buhl started for the Braves but did not last very long. In the first two innings, no one scored, although there were some opportunities, including the Yankees&#x27; first inning when Enos Slaughter reached third and Yogi Berra got to second on Buhl&#x27;s wild pitch. Buhl struck out Gil McDougald to end the inning.

In the bottom of the third, the Yankees scored two runs to take the lead on a Berra two-run homer, scoring Slaughter. After that Ernie Johnson replaced Buhl. Johnson then held the Yankees scoreless until the seventh inning.

The Braves cut the lead in their half in the fifth on Frank Torre&#x27;s home run, his second of the series. The Braves then tied it in the top of the seventh with a homer by Hank Aaron, his third. The game was now tied and Braves&#x27; pitcher Johnson was holding the Yankees to just one hit in innings. Leading off the seventh, pitcher Bob Turley was out on a bunt attempt with two strikes. Then, right fielder Hank Bauer hit a home run off the left-field foul pole to give the Yankees a one-run lead.

In the Braves&#x27; ninth, after an Eddie Mathews walk, Turley got lefty Wes Covington to ground into a 1–6–3 double play to end the game and force a deciding Game 7.

===Game 7===


Lew Burdette was called in to start game 7 for the Braves on two days&#x27; rest when the expected starter, Warren Spahn, was struck with the Asian flu.

After two scoreless innings, the Braves broke through in the third, started by a Bob Hazle single and an error by Tony Kubek at third base; one of three Yankee errors in the game. The inning continued with a hard-hit Eddie Mathews double, which prompted Casey Stengel to take out starter Don Larsen and bring in lefty Bobby Shantz. Shantz then gave up an RBI single to Hank Aaron and a single by Wes Covington advanced Aaron to third. Frank Torre grounded into a fielders&#x27; choice which scored Aaron. Felix Mantilla then flied to Hank Bauer in right to end the inning, ending the Braves&#x27; scoring at four runs.

The Yankees&#x27; best chance came in the sixth, when they had runners on first and second with two outs after a Mickey Mantle single and an error by Mathews at third. Gil McDougald then grounded out forcing Mantle at third to end the inning and the threat.

In the ninth, after Milwaukee made it 5–0 on a Del Crandall homer, the Yankees attempted to mount a rally. With two outs and McDougald on first base, Jerry Coleman singled to right. Then, Tommy Byrne singled to load the bases for Bill Skowron. With the tying run on deck, Burdette retired Skowron on a ground out to third with Mathews making the final out which secured the world championship for the Braves.

In the game, the Yankees were limited to seven hits and one walk. Burdette was named the Series MVP after pitching three complete games and two shutouts while recording 13 strikeouts, two earned runs off 21 hits, and a 0.67 ERA. He was the first pitcher since Christy Mathewson to pitch two shutouts in a World Series.

Despite the Yankees having made 17 more appearances in the World Series since this one, this game, to date, is the most recent time the team has hosted a World Series Game 7.

<text>The 1917 [[World Series]] was the championship series in Major League Baseball for the 1917 season. The 14th edition of the World Series, it matched the American League champion Chicago White Sox against the National League champion New York Giants. The White Sox won the Series four games to two. The Series was played against the backdrop of World War I, which dominated the American newspapers that year and next.

The strong Chicago White Sox club had finished the 1917 season with a 100–54 record: their only 100-win season in franchise history as of 2023. The Sox&#x27;s next World Series winner in 2005 would finish the regular season with a 99–63 record.

The Sox won Game 1 of the Series in Chicago 2–1 behind a complete game by Eddie Cicotte. Happy Felsch hit a home run in the fourth inning that provided the winning margin. The Sox beat the Giants in Game 2 7–2 behind another complete game effort by Red Faber to take a 2–0 lead in the Series.

Back in New York for Game 3, Cicotte again threw a complete game, but the Sox could not muster a single run against Giants&#x27; starter Rube Benton and lost 2–0. In Game 4 the Sox were shut out again 5–0 by Ferdie Schupp. Faber threw another complete game, but the Series was even at 2–2 going back to Chicago.

Reb Russell started Game 5 in Chicago, but only faced three batters before giving way to Cicotte. Going into the bottom of the seventh inning, Chicago was down 5–2, but they rallied to score three in the seventh and three in the eighth to win 8–5. Faber pitched the final two innings for the win. In Game 6 the Sox took an early 3–0 lead and on the strength of another complete-game victory from Faber (his third of the Series) won 4–2 and clinched the World Championship. Eddie Collins was the hitting hero, batting .409 over the six game series while Cicotte and Faber combined to pitch 50 out of a total 52 World Series innings to lead the staff.
The decisive game underscored the Giants&#x27; post-season frustrations, featuring a famous rundown in which Giants&#x27; third baseman Heinie Zimmerman futilely chased the speedy Eddie Collins toward home plate with what would be the Series-winning run. Catcher Bill Rariden had run up the third base line to start a rundown, expecting pitcher Rube Benton or first baseman Walter Holke to cover the plate. However, neither of them budged, forcing Zimmerman to chase Collins while pawing helplessly in the air with the ball in an attempt to tag him. Two years before the issue of baseball betting reached its peak, Zimmerman found himself having to publicly deny purposely allowing the run to score, i.e. to deny that he had &quot;thrown&quot; the game. In truth, McGraw blamed Benton and Holke for failing to cover the plate. A quote often attributed to Zim, but actually invented by writer Ring Lardner some years later, was that when asked about the incident Zim replied, &quot;Who the hell was I supposed to throw to, Klem (umpire Bill Klem, who was working the plate)?&quot; Conventional wisdom has it that Collins was much faster than Zimmerman, but existing photos of the play show that Zimmerman was only a step or two behind Collins, who actually slid across the plate while Zim jumped over him to avoid trampling him. Zimmerman would eventually be banned for life due to various accusations of corruption.

The great athlete Jim Thorpe, better known for football in general, made his only World Series &quot;appearance&quot; during Game 5, where he was listed in the lineup card as starting in right field; but for his turn at bat in the top of the first inning he was replaced by a left-handed hitting Dave Robertson.

The White Sox, who were essentially dismantled following the 1920 season by baseball commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis due to the Black Sox Scandal in the 1919 World Series, did not make it to another World Series until , and did not win another World Series until .

==Summary==
==Matchups==

===Game 1===
Fred McMullin drove in Chicago&#x27;s first run, and Happy Felsch&#x27;s homer made it 2–0. Giants pitcher Slim Sallee knocked in his side&#x27;s only run with a single after a Lew McCarty triple.

===Game 2===


Shoeless Joe Jackson&#x27;s two-run single capped a five-run fourth inning for the White Sox, who knocked out Giants starter Ferdie Schupp in the second inning.

===Game 3===

The home team won for the third straight time as the series moved to New York. The only runs of a snappy 1 hour, 55 minute game came on a Dave Robertson triple, Walter Holke double and a single by George Burns.

===Game 4===

The first of a pair of homers by Giants center fielder Benny Kauff was an inside-the-park one that sailed over Sox center fielder Happy Felsch&#x27;s head. The other came in the eighth off Chicago reliever Dave Danforth.

===Game 5===
Even though Red Faber would start Games 4 and 6, he was brought in from the bullpen to close Game 5. Taking no chances, the Sox yanked starter Reb Russell after just three batters, all of whom reached base. A three-error third inning behind Eddie Cicotte put the Giants up 4–1. But after a game-tying rally in the seventh, the Sox won it in the eighth as Happy Felsch greeted reliever Pol Perritt with an RBI single. It was the fifth straight win by the home team in this Series.

===Game 6===
A pair of errors proved costly to the Giants in a three-run fourth when Chick Gandil and Ray Schalk followed with RBI hits. New York&#x27;s hopes rose with a Buck Herzog triple in the next inning that made it 3–2. But with the workhorse Faber holding the Giants at bay the rest of the way, the Sox got an insurance run in the ninth on hits by Buck Weaver and Nemo Leibold, and the Series was theirs. It would be their last championship until 2005.

<text>The 1916 [[World Series]] was the championship series in Major League Baseball for the 1916 season. The 13th edition of the World Series, it matched the American League champion Boston Red Sox against the National League champion Brooklyn Robins. The Red Sox won the Series four games to one, capturing their record-setting fourth World Series title. It was the first World Series meeting between the teams.

Casey Stengel shone on offense for the Robins in the 1916 Series, but the Red Sox pitching corps ultimately proved too much for the denizens of Flatbush. The Sox&#x27;s Babe Ruth pitched 13 shutout innings in Game 2, starting a consecutive scoreless innings streak that would reach 29 in . As with the Series, the Red Sox played their home games at the larger Braves Field, and it paid off as they drew a then-record 43,620 people for the final game.

Brooklyn fielded some strong teams under their manager and namesake Wilbert Robinson in the late 1910s. The Robins, also interchangeably called the Dodgers, would win the pennant again in 1920, but the American League teams were generally stronger during that interval. It would be 39 years before the Dodgers would win their first World Series title in .

The two franchises met again in the postseason for the first time in 102 years in the 2018 World Series, 60 years after the Dodgers relocated to Los Angeles. The record for most innings played in a World Series game, set by Game 2 in 1916, at 14, was broken by Game 3 in 2018, at 18. Just like their first matchup in the World Series, the Red Sox would eventually go on to defeat the Dodgers in five games to win their ninth World Series championship overall and fourth World Series championship since 2004.

==Summary==
==Matchups==
===Game 1===
Until the ninth, Boston starter Ernie Shore was in control. Holding a comfortable 6–1 lead, a walk, hit batter, error and bases-loaded walk to Fred Merkle finally forced the Red Sox to call on Carl Mays from the bullpen to preserve a 6–5 win.

===Game 2===
The Robins scored in the top of the first on an inside-the-park home run by Hy Myers, and the Red Sox tied it in the bottom of the third, Ruth himself knocking in the run with a ground ball. The game remained 1–1 until the bottom of the 14th, when the Red Sox won it on a pinch-hit single by Del Gainer. The 14-inning game set a World Series record for longest game by innings. That mark was equaled in Game 3 of the 2005 World Series between the Chicago White Sox and Houston Astros, and then again in Game 1 of the 2015 World Series between the Kansas City Royals and New York Mets, before being broken in Game 3 of the 2018 World Series between the Red Sox and Dodgers.

===Game 3===
A seventh-inning home run by Larry Gardner chased Brooklyn starter Jack Coombs and brought Boston to within one run. Jeff Pfeffer came through with innings of hitless relief to save the victory for Coombs.

===Game 4===
Brooklyn&#x27;s first three batters reached safely off Dutch Leonard in a two-run first inning, but that&#x27;s all the Dodgers would get. Larry Gardner&#x27;s second home run in two days was an inside-the-park one to left-center that scored two teammates ahead of him, giving Leonard all he would need for the win.

===Game 5===
The final game was over in a snappy 1 hour, 43 minutes. Ernie Shore threw a three-hitter. Boston scratched out a run on a walk, sacrifice bunt, ground-out and passed ball. The Red Sox added more in the third, thanks to an error and a Chick Shorten RBI single, and the fifth when Harry Hooper singled and scored on a Hal Janvrin double. Casey Stengel led off the Dodger ninth with a hit, but Shore allowed no more. For the second straight series, Red Sox pitching dominated, this time holding the Robins to a team .200 batting average, contributing to an easy 5-game victory.

<text>The 1915 [[World Series]] was the championship series in Major League Baseball for the 1915 season. The 12th edition of the World Series, it matched the American League champion Boston Red Sox against the National League champion Philadelphia Phillies. The Red Sox won the Series four games to one. It was the last World Series to start on a Friday until the 2022 World Series.

In their only World Series before , the Phillies won Game 1 before being swept the rest of the way. It was 65 years before the Phillies won their next Series game. The Red Sox pitching was so strong in the 1915 series that the young Babe Ruth was not used on the mound and only made a single pinch-hitting appearance.

==Series arrangements==
Arrangements for the Series were made on October 2, 1915, in a meeting of the team owners, league presidents and the National Commission at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in midtown Manhattan, New York City. Red Sox owner Joseph Lannin lost the coin toss for home field advantage, and Phillies owner William F. Baker chose to have the first two games of the Series in Philadelphia. The league presidents selected the umpires, and it was announced that J. G. Taylor Spink would be one of the official scorers.

One controversy surrounded the allocation of tickets to the Red Sox&#x27; Royal Rooters fan club. Each visiting team was allocated 200 tickets, but the Red Sox requested an additional 400 on behalf of their supporters. The Phillies&#x27; Baker Bowl sat only 20,000, and their above-cited owner, William Baker, refused to allocate additional tickets for visiting fans. The matter was resolved by National Commission chairman Garry Herrmann, who gave the Red Sox tickets from the Commission&#x27;s own Series allocation.

==Series summary==
The Phillies won Game 1 3–1, although &quot;The New York Times&quot; reporter Hugh Fullerton wrote of the future 300+ game-winning Hall of Famer, &quot;[Grover Cleveland] Alexander pitched a bad game of ball. He had little or nothing&quot; in his review of the game, headed &quot;Nothing but luck saved the Phillies.&quot; The &quot;Times&quot; also reported that a crowd of 10,000 gathered in Manhattan&#x27;s Times Square to view a real-time mechanical recreation of the game on a giant scoreboard sponsored by the newspaper.

The Phillies were not to win another postseason game until 1977, nor another World Series game until 1980. The Red Sox swept Games 2–5, all by one run, and by identical scores of 2–1 in Games 2–4.

In Game 2, Woodrow Wilson became the first U.S. President to attend a World Series game.

This was the second straight year that a Boston team beat a Philadelphia team in the World Series after the Braves had swept the Athletics the year before.

Unlike the 1913 Series, where the home team won only one of the five games, home field was often very much an advantage in the 1915 October classic. Fenway Park, paradoxically the Braves&#x27; home field in their 1914 Series sweep of the A&#x27;s while Braves Field was still being built, had been the home of the Red Sox for four seasons and was fully functional in 1915; yet the Red Sox played their 1915 Series &quot;home&quot; games in the brand-new Braves Field to take advantage of its larger seating capacity. Beyond the added revenue, the long ball was affected by this arrangement, as follows:

*In the top of the third inning of Game 3 at Boston, with two out, one run in and two runners in scoring position, Phillies&#x27; slugger &quot;Cactus&quot; Gavvy Cravath hit a line drive to deep left field which was caught for a harmless inning-ending out in the spacious Braves Field outfield. In Fenway or Philadelphia&#x27;s Baker Bowl, it might have been a home run or at least an extra-base hit which might have turned the Series around.
*The Phillies had packed some extra outfield seats into their already-small bandbox of a ball-field, shortening the distance from home to the outfield wall even more. This proved crucial in the decisive Game 5, in which Boston&#x27;s Harry Hooper twice homered over the moved-in center field fence and Duffy Lewis followed suit. In Braves Field, those would have been extra-base hits at best. Both of Hooper&#x27;s hits, including the eventual game-winner in the top of the ninth, actually bounced over the fence and were home runs by the rules of that era although they would have been only ground-rule doubles by present-day rules.

==Summary==

==Matchups==
===Game 1===

Alexander scattered eight hits, winning 3–1, in giving the Phillies their only win of the series and their last until Game 1 of the 1980 Series.

===Game 2===

Rube Foster pitched a 3-hitter, allowing no walks, and retiring the last 10 Phillies he faced, and helped his own cause with the game-winning RBI single in the top of the ninth.

===Game 3===
Dutch Leonard and Grover Cleveland Alexander engaged in a classic pitcher&#x27;s duel, Leonard retiring the last 20 Phillies to face him, winning 2–1 on an RBI single by Duffy Lewis in the bottom of the 9th.

===Game 4===
Ernie Shore held the Phillies scoreless until the eighth inning, winning 2–1, giving the Red Sox a 3–1 series lead.

===Game 5===

The Red Sox won on three home runs by two of their outfielders, two cheapies by Harry Hooper (see above) and one by Duffy Lewis. Fred Luderus homered for the Phillies only home run of the series in the bottom of the fourth inning. Those were the only round-trippers in the entire Series, the first four games being pitchers&#x27; duels. The Phillies were held to a weak .182 team batting average in the 5-game set.

<text>The 1914 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball&#x27;s 1914 season. The 11th edition of the World Series, it was played between the American League champion and defending World Series champion Philadelphia Athletics and the National League champion Boston Braves.

The &quot;Miracle Braves&quot; were in last place on July 4, then won the National League pennant by games. The Braves&#x27; relatively unknown starting trio of pitchers, with a combined career record of 285–245, outperformed the Athletics vaunted rotation (929–654) in all four games. Hank Gowdy hit .545 (6 of 11) with five extra-base hits and also drew five walks for Boston in the series and was the difference maker in Games 1 and 3.

Adding to their supposed disadvantages, the Braves arguably lacked a notable home-field advantage. They had abandoned their 43-year-old home field South End Grounds in August 1914, choosing to rent from the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park while awaiting construction of Braves Field (1915). Thus their home games in this Series were also at Fenway.

This was the first official four-game sweep in World Series history. The Cubs had defeated the Tigers four games to none in , but Game 1 had ended in a tie before the Cubs won the next four in a row.

At least one publication, &quot;To Every Thing A Season&quot; by Bruce Kuklick, has suggested other factors that might have contributed to the sweep, noting that some of the A&#x27;s may have been irritated at the penny-pinching ways of their manager/owner Connie Mack and thus did not play hard, and also noting the heavy wagering against Philadelphia placed by entertainer George M. Cohan through bookmaker Sport Sullivan, who was also implicated in the 1919 Black Sox scandal. Chief Bender and Eddie Plank jumped to the rival Federal League for the 1915 season. Mack unloaded most of his other high-priced stars soon after and, within two years, the A&#x27;s posted the worst winning percentage in modern history (even worse than the 1962 New York Mets or the 2003 Detroit Tigers).

== Background ==
Because an AL team had won the last four World Series (the A&#x27;s had represented the AL in three out of those four), the A&#x27;s were heavily favored. That the Braves had been in last place in July before coming back to win the pennant contributed to the perception that the AL was simply superior to the NL. The A&#x27;s roster boasted 5 future hall-of-famers and many agreed they were the better team on paper. A story told about Connie Mack during the 1914 season reflects this attitude among the A&#x27;s that the Braves would be pushovers. That year, Mack gave star pitcher Chief Bender the week off and told him to scout the Braves personally. Instead, Bender took a vacation. When asked to defend his actions, he replied: &quot;Why should I check out a bunch of bush league hitters?&quot;

== Summary ==

== Matchups ==

=== Game 1 ===

26-game winner Dick Rudolph scattered five hits while striking out eight as the Braves won the opener in convincing fashion against the Athletics ace, Chief Bender. Catcher Hank Gowdy had a single, double and triple as well as a walk in leading Boston&#x27;s offensive attack. He was also on the back end of a double steal in the eighth inning, with Butch Schmidt&#x27;s steal of home the Braves&#x27; final run.

According to Tom Meany&#x27;s 1950 book &quot;Baseball&#x27;s Greatest Teams&quot;, with one chapter on each of the then 16 major league teams&#x27; one most outstanding season in the author&#x27;s opinion, the chapter on the Boston Braves was naturally on their one world championship year, 1914. Meany recalled that manager Stallings and the Braves showed utter contempt for Connie Mack&#x27;s heavily favored A&#x27;s by spurning the Shibe Park visiting clubhouse for the one in the National League Phillies&#x27; deserted home park, Baker Bowl (the NL site of the next World Series, which again featured Boston defeating Philadelphia, but this time Red Sox 4, Phillies 1). Meany may also have been the source for the sensational sidelight that Stallings&#x27; motive for this may have been the rumor that the A&#x27;s may have sabotaged the Shibe Park visiting clubhouse (with war clouds gathering in Europe as World War I was just beginning).

=== Game 2 ===
Bill James, Boston&#x27;s other 26-game winner, hooked up against Philadelphia&#x27;s Eddie Plank in a classic pitcher&#x27;s duel. James allowed only three base runners in the first eight innings, picking off two of them in holding Philadelphia scoreless. Plank matched him until the ninth, when Amos Strunk lost Charlie Deal&#x27;s fly ball in the sun for a double. Deal then stole third, and scored on a two-out single by Les Mann. James walked two batters in the ninth, but got Eddie Murphy to ground into a game-ending double play to give Boston a 2–0 advantage in the series coming back home to Fenway.

=== Game 3 ===
Lefty Tyler of the Braves went up against Bullet Joe Bush in a 12-inning thriller. Frank &quot;Home Run&quot; Baker&#x27;s two-out single in the tenth plated two runs to give the Athletics a 4–2 lead and a seeming victory to get them back in the series. But Hank Gowdy led off the bottom of the tenth with a home run, and the Braves then tied the game on Joe Connolly&#x27;s sacrifice fly later in the inning. Game 2 winner Bill James, coming on in relief for Boston in the 11th, earned the win after Gowdy led off the bottom of the 12th with a double and pinch-runner Les Mann scored when Bush threw wildly to third on Herbie Moran&#x27;s bunt, giving the Braves a commanding 3–0 series lead.

=== Game 4 ===
Johnny Evers&#x27; two-out, two-run single in the bottom of the fifth broke a 1–1 tie and the collective backs of the heavily favored Athletics as the &quot;Miracle Braves&quot; completed their improbable sweep. Game 1 winner Dick Rudolph allowed only one base-runner after Evers&#x27; tie-breaking hit and struck out seven in notching his second win of the series. The powerful A&#x27;s were held to a .172 team batting average and no home runs in the series.

<text>The 1909 [[World Series]] was the championship series in Major League Baseball for the 1909 season. The sixth edition of the World Series, it featured the National League champion Pittsburgh Pirates against the American League champion Detroit Tigers. The Pirates won the Series in seven games to capture their first championship of the modern Major League Baseball era and the second championship in the club&#x27;s history. This Series is best remembered for featuring two of the very best players of the time, Pittsburgh shortstop Honus Wagner, and Detroit outfielder Ty Cobb.

==Series recap==

Sites: games 1, 2 in Pittsburgh; games 3, 4 in Detroit; game 5 in Pittsburgh; games 6, 7 in Detroit.

The Pirates had won the National League pennant in 1909 behind the brilliant play of Honus Wagner, who led the league with a .339 batting average and 100 runs batted in.

Detroit returned for their third consecutive Fall Classic, determined to erase the memories of their previous efforts. The Tigers were also backed up by the heavy bat of Ty Cobb (who had just won his third consecutive American League batting title) and a formidable pitching staff. They might have finally won the Series in their third try, had it not been for Pirates rookie Babe Adams. Manager Fred Clarke started him, on a hunch, in Game 1. Adams won that game and two more, setting a World Series record for rookies. The Tigers thus became the first AL team to win three consecutive pennants and the first team to lose three straight World Series (the New York Giants would lose three straight Series from 1911 to 1913).

The Pirates ran at will against the weak Detroit catching corps, stealing 18 bases in seven games.

For the first time, four umpires were used at the same time, with the standard plate umpire and base umpire along with two outfield umpires.

On June 14, 2009, the series&#x27; 100th anniversary was celebrated, when the Tigers and Pirates played each other in Pittsburgh. Both teams wore throwback uniforms similar to those worn in 1909. The stadium&#x27;s public address and sound systems were also turned off, simulating the game conditions in 1909. The Pirates won the game, 6–3.

===The &quot;Krauthead&quot; story===

Ty Cobb had a fairly quiet Series, going 6-for-26 with two stolen bases and one caught stealing. There is a long-standing legend that Cobb, standing on first base, called the German-ancestored Honus Wagner a &quot;&quot;, told him he was going to steal second, and was not only thrown out but that Wagner tagged him in the mouth, ball in hand, drawing blood from Cobb&#x27;s lip. However, an examination of the play-by-play does not indicate that such a play occurred. In the one &quot;caught stealing&quot; charged to Cobb, during the first inning of Game 4, he was actually safe at second due to a throwing error by first baseman Bill Abstein. This story is largely attributed to the creative press at the time, and Wagner and Cobb were actually on good terms.

== Summary ==


== Matchups ==
=== Game 1 ===


Rookie Babe Adams, who had compiled a 12–3 record during the regular season, unexpectedly drew the start for Game 1. He responded with a six-hit, 4–1 victory sparked by Clarke&#x27;s game-tying home run in the bottom of the fourth inning.

=== Game 2 ===
The Tigers began their 7–2 comeback win (after a two-run Pirate bottom of the first) with three runs in the top of the third, tying the Series at one game apiece. Ty Cobb stole home to start the rally.

=== Game 3 ===
Honus Wagner had three hits, three RBI and three stolen bases as the Pirates regained the lead in the Series, two games to one.

=== Game 4 ===
The win-swapping continued with Detroit taking Game 4. Tiger ace George Mullin threw a five-hit shutout while striking out 10 Pirates, again evening the Series at two games apiece.

=== Game 5 ===
Babe Adams threw another six-hitter, for an 8–4 triumph and a 3–2 Series lead for his Pirates.

=== Game 6 ===
Mullin, after being roughed up for three first-inning runs, surrendered only one more and wound up with the win, knotting the Series at three games apiece.

=== Game 7 ===
With the Series coming down to a climactic seventh game (the first to go the distance), Pittsburgh&#x27;s Fred Clarke went with two-game winner Babe Adams as his pitcher, while Detroit Manager Hugh Jennings decided on Bill Donovan, a complete-game winner in Game 2.

Donovan got off to a miserable start. He hit the first Pirate batter and went on to walk six in the first two innings. He was pulled after three with Adams confidently holding a 2–0 lead. Pittsburgh never looked back, as Babe nailed his third six-hitter and third win of the Series for an 8–0 championship victory.

Honus Wagner continued to prove his Cooperstown worthiness by hitting .333, with seven RBI and six stolen bases (the latter total standing as a Series record until Lou Brock surpassed it in ). On the other side, Ty Cobb did not fare as well. Appearing in what would be his last Series (although he would remain active through 1928), Cobb batted only .231 although he did lead the Tigers, losers of their third Series in three years, with six RBI.

No two professional sports teams from Detroit and Pittsburgh would meet in a postseason game again until Game 1 of the 2008 Stanley Cup Finals between the Detroit Red Wings and Pittsburgh Penguins.

This would be the last World Series appearance for the Pirates until 1925 while the Tigers would not play in another Fall Classic for 25 years.

It was the first time that one team won the odd-numbered games; the other, the even; it did not happen again until .

<text>The 1908 [[World Series]] was the championship series in Major League Baseball for the 1908 season. The fifth edition of the World Series, it matched the defending National League champion Chicago Cubs against the American League champion Detroit Tigers in a rematch of the 1907 Series. In this first-ever rematch of this young event, the Cubs won in five games for their second straight World Series title.

The 1908 World Series was significant for being the last World Series championship the Cubs would win until (108 years later). That became the longest World Series victory drought in MLB history. Before the 2016 series, the team would go on to appear in seven World Series; in , , , , , , and , losing each time. The Cubs had been one of baseball&#x27;s most dominant teams in the early 1900s. This was the year of the infamous &quot;Merkle&#x27;s Boner&quot; play that allowed the Chicago Cubs to reach the World Series after beating the New York Giants (now the San Francisco Giants) in a one-game &quot;playoff&quot;, actually the makeup game for the tie that the Merkle play had caused.

The Series was anticlimactic after tight pennant races in both leagues. Ty Cobb had a much better World Series than in the previous year, as did the rest of his team. The final two games, held in Detroit, were shutouts. This was also the most poorly attended World Series in history, with the final game drawing a record-low 6,210 fans. Attendance in Chicago was harmed by a ticket-scalping scheme that fans accused the club&#x27;s owner of participating in, and the World Series was boycotted to some degree.

For the first time, four umpires were used in the series, in alternating two-man teams. Games 1, 4, and 5 were played in Detroit, while Games 2 and 3 were played in Chicago. Had the series continued, Game 6 would have been played in Chicago, and the home team for Game 7 would have been decided randomly, &quot;by lot&quot;.

==Summary==
==Matchups==
===Game 1===
The Tigers struck first in Game 1 when Matty McIntyre singled to lead off the bottom of the first off of Ed Reulbach, stole second and scored on Ty Cobb&#x27;s two-out single, but the Cubs responded in the third off of Ed Killian when after a leadoff double and single, Frank Schulte&#x27;s RBI single tied the game. After a bunt groundout, Harry Steinfeldt&#x27;s RBI single put Chicago up 2–1. After a walk, Ed Summers relieved Killian and allowed an RBI groundout to Joe Tinker and Johnny Kling reached on an error that allowed another run to score. The Cubs added another run in the seventh on Steinfedlt&#x27;s sacrifice fly. In the bottom of the inning, with runners on second and third, Boss Schmidt&#x27;s groundout, Red Downs&#x27;s ground-rule double, and Summers&#x27;s single scored a run each. Next inning, Claude Rossman&#x27;s two-run single off of Mordecai Brown put the Tigers up 6–5. In the top of the ninth, three straight one-out singles loaded the bases before Solly Hofman&#x27;s single scored two and Joe Tinker&#x27;s bunt single scored another. After a double steal, Johnny Kling&#x27;s two-run single put the Cubs up 10–6. Brown pitched a scoreless bottom of the ninth despite allowing a single and walk as the Cubs went up 1–0 in the series.

===Game 2===
A scoreless tie in the bottom of the eighth came to an end when Joe Tinker&#x27;s two-run homer launched a six-run Cub outburst. After a ground-rule double and groundout, RBI singles by Jimmy Sheckard and Johnny Evers and an RBI triple by Frank Schulte (the last two hits coming off after stolen bases) scored a run each. A wild pitch to Frank Chance scored the Cubs&#x27; last run. The Tigers avoided a shutout in the ninth when Davy Jones drew a leadoff walk, moved to second on a groundout and scored on Ty Cobb&#x27;s single. Orval Overall&#x27;s complete-game win took just 90 minutes.

===Game 3===

It was in this game that Ty Cobb enjoyed the finest World Series outing he ever had. The 21-year-old Georgian rapped three singles and a double in five at-bats, and stole two bases. In the top of the ninth, he singled and promptly stole second and third, but then the hyped-up boy wonder pressed his luck and was thrown out trying to steal home. This was the only Tiger win in their back-to-back first two World Series losses to the Cubs. Detroit struck first in the top of the first when Charley O&#x27;Leary hit a one-out single, moved to second on a groundout and scored on Ty Cobb&#x27;s single. The Cubs responded in the fourth on Frank Chance&#x27;s RBI single. After stealing second, an error on Harry Steinfeldt&#x27;s ground ball and Solly Hofman&#x27;s triple scored a run each. In the top of the sixth, after a single and walk, singles by Sam Crawford, Ty Cobb, and Claude Rossman scored a run each. After a double play, Ira Thomas&#x27;s RBI double made it 6–3 Tigers. They added two more runs in the eighth on Bill Coughlin&#x27;s bases loaded sacrifice fly followed by George Mullin&#x27;s RBI single.

===Game 4===

This one was over in 1 hour and 35 minutes. RBI singles by Harry Steinfeldt and Solly Hofman in the third inning after two walks gave Mordecai Brown all the support he&#x27;d need. Brown allowed only four hits and walked none. The Cubs added another run in the ninth when Frank Chance reached on an error with two on.

===Game 5===

In the first inning, Overall registered four strikeouts, as Claude Rossman reached on an uncaught third strike. This was the first, and to date only, instance of a four-strikeout inning in a World Series game. Overall allowed only three hits, walking four and striking out 10 for his second win of the series. In innings pitched during the series, he allowed only seven hits and two runs for an ERA of 0.98.

The Cubs scored the game&#x27;s first run in the first on three straight one-out singles, the last of which to Frank Chance scoring a run, then added another run in the fifth on Johnny Evers&#x27;s double after two walks.

Boss Schmidt, who made the last out of the 1907 Series with a popup to short, also made the last out of this Series with a feeble catcher-to-first groundout.

This was also the first World Series game in which neither team committed an error. The Cubs did not win another World Series title until finally reclaiming the crown in , a drought of 108 years, which remains the longest in MLB history.

The attendance during this final game of the series, 6,210, was the smallest crowd in World Series history. It also remains the fastest postseason game in major-league history, at 1 hour 25 minutes.

<text>The 1907 [[World Series]] was the championship series in Major League Baseball for the 1907 season. The fourth edition of the World Series, it featured the defending National League champion Chicago Cubs and the American League champion Detroit Tigers. The Cubs won the Series four games to none (with one tie) for their first championship.

The series had been scheduled for two games in Chicago, three games in Detroit, and one game in Chicago (games beyond the first four, only if necessary). Had a seventh game been necessary, its location was to be decided by the league office. After the first game ended in a tie, the series did not move to Detroit until Game 4.

The Cubs came back strong from their shocking loss in the 1906 World Series. The Tigers&#x27; young star Ty Cobb came into the Series with the first of his many league batting championships. With pitching dominance over the Tigers and Cobb, the Cubs allowed only three runs in the four games they won, while stealing 18 bases off the rattled Tigers.

Each game was umpired by the two-man crew of Hank O&#x27;Day and Jack Sheridan.

== Summary ==
== Matchups ==

=== Game 1 ===
The Tigers scored three runs, largely due to three Cub errors, in the eighth inning and held a 3–1 lead going into the bottom of the ninth inning. The Cubs loaded the bases on a single, walk and infield error with one out. Detroit conceded a run on a ground ball for the second out, and Cub player-manager Frank Chance then pinch hit Del Howard for Joe Tinker. Wild Bill Donovan (25–4 in the regular season) struck him out, but the ball got away from catcher Boss Schmidt, allowing Harry Steinfeldt to score the tying run. Donovan got the next hitter, but the damage had been done. The teams then played three scoreless extra innings before the game was called on account of darkness and declared a tie, a World Series first.

Donovan struck out 12 Cubs in the game. Although that matched Ed Walsh&#x27;s total in Game 3 against the Cubs in 1906, Walsh had done so in nine innings while Donovan only struck out 10 batters in the first nine innings of the game.

This was the closest the Tigers came to winning a game in this, their first Series. The Cubs committed five errors and struck out 12 times in the game, but nine stolen base attempts (seven successful) and five bunts (two for hits) set an aggressive offensive tone pressuring the Tigers for the rest of the series.

=== Game 2 ===

George Mullin, who both won and lost 20 games for Detroit in the regular season, and who had walked over 100 batters in each of his last five seasons, issued a bases-loaded walk in the bottom of the second, matching the Tiger run in the top of the inning and tying the score at 1–1. Chicago scored two more in the fourth on a single, sacrifice bunt, RBI single, stolen base and double to take a 3–1 lead. Jack Pfiester, while allowing ten hits, benefited from two double plays and three caught-stealings by battery-mate Johnny Kling and was the winning pitcher for the Cubs. Joe Tinker scored a run and drove in another in Game 2 after being pinch-hit for in the ninth inning of Game 1.

Hughie Jennings was the recipient of the first ejection issued in World Series history when he argued a caught stealing call by Hank O&#x27;Day against Germany Schaefer.

=== Game 3 ===

Cub pitcher Ed Reulbach scattered six hits as Chicago jumped on Tiger starter Ed Siever for four runs on seven hits in only four innings en route to their second win. Johnny Evers had three hits, including two doubles, as the Cubs took a 2–0 lead in the Series.

=== Game 4 ===

In their first World Series home game, the Tigers took a 1–0 lead on a triple by their 20-year-old batting champion Ty Cobb and an RBI single by Claude Rossman in the bottom of the fourth, shortly before a rain delay in the top of the fifth. Soon after play resumed in the same inning, two Cubs reached base on an error and a walk. After Joe Tinker sacrificed, pitcher Orval Overall drove both runners home on a single to right. The Cubs scored three more in the seventh without the ball leaving the infield, on four bunts (two for hits) and two ground balls. Regular-season 23-game winner Overall was masterful after the rain delay, allowing only one hit in Detroit&#x27;s final five innings, giving his Cubs a commanding 3–0 lead in the Series.

=== Game 5 ===
Chicago wrapped up the series with a 2–0 victory on &quot;Three-fingered&quot; Mordecai Brown&#x27;s seven-hit shutout. The Cubs scored a run in the top of the first on a walk, stolen base and RBI single by Harry Steinfeldt and scored again in the second on an error, a single, a double-steal and a groundout to drive in the last run of the Series. Detroit had runners on second and third with one out in the last of the fourth, but left them there and never seriously threatened after that.

This Series was the closest to a four-game sweep until the first true Series sweep in , when George Stallings&#x27; &quot;miracle&quot; Boston Braves surged from last place in mid-July to win the NL pennant and upset Connie Mack&#x27;s Philadelphia Athletics in the Series.

Frank Chance remains, at 30, the youngest manager to win a World Series title, breaking the mark set by John McGraw who won the 1905 World Series with the New York Giants at the age of 32. Since then only one other manager has won a World Series under the age of 40, Tom Kelly of the Minnesota Twins won the 1987 World Series at the age of 37.

<text>The 1906 [[World Series]] was the championship series in Major League Baseball for the 1906 season. The third edition of the World Series, it featured a crosstown matchup between the American League champion Chicago White Sox and the National League champion Chicago Cubs. The Cubs had posted the highest regular-season win total (116) and winning percentage (.763) in the major leagues since the advent of the 154-game season. The White Sox, known as the &quot;Hitless Wonders&quot; after finishing with the worst team batting average (.230) in the American League, beat the Cubs in six games for one of the greatest upsets in Series history as the Sox out-pitched the Cubs in their first two wins and out-hit them in their last two. The home teams alternated, starting with the National League Cubs being home in Game 1.

The teams split the first four games; then the Hitless Wonders (a name coined by sportswriter Charles Dryden) exploded for 26 hits in the last two games. True to their nickname, the White Sox hit only .198 as a team in winning the series, but it beat the .196 average produced by the Cubs. In Game 3, White Sox pitcher Ed Walsh struck out 12 Cubs, breaking the previous record of 11 set by Bill Dinneen in .

The 1906 World Series was the first to be played between two teams from the same city or state. This series and the edition, contested between the St. Louis Cardinals and St. Louis Browns, are the only such instances outside of New York City where two teams from the same city played in the World Series. This is also the most recent World Series where both teams were making their first appearance in the Fall Classic.

== Summary ==
== Matchups ==

=== Game 1 ===

White Sox starter Nick Altrock faced Cub starter Mordecai &quot;Three-Fingered&quot; Brown in game 1. Both were perfect through three innings. The Cubs put a runner on second in the bottom of the fourth inning, but couldn&#x27;t score. In the top of the fifth, George Rohe tripled to lead off, then scored on an error at home when Patsy Dougherty reached on a fielder&#x27;s choice. The Sox scored a second run in the top of the sixth. Altrock walked, and was sacrificed to second base by Ed Hahn. Fielder Jones then singled to center but Altrock was thrown out at the plate, Jones taking second on the throw home. He took third on Cub catcher Johnny Kling&#x27;s passed ball, and Frank Isbell drove him home with a single. The Cubs struck back in their half of the sixth. Kling walked and Brown singled with nobody out. After Solly Hofman sacrificed the runners to second and third, Altrock&#x27;s wild pitch scored Kling and sent Brown to third, giving him little margin for error with only one out, but he got Jimmy Sheckard to pop out and Frank Schulte to ground out to end the threat. He pitched beautifully for the rest of the game, allowing only one more Cub to reach second, retaining the 2–1 lead for a Game 1 Sox win.

=== Game 2 ===

Ed Reulbach was called on for the Cubs to face White Sox hurler Doc White. After matching 1–2–3 first innings, things started to fall apart for White. After cleanup-hitting first baseman Frank Chance led off the top of the second with a strikeout, third baseman Harry Steinfeldt singled to left field and shortstop Joe Tinker beat out a bunt. Cubs second baseman Johnny Evers then reached on a two-base error by White Sox second baseman Frank Isbell, scoring Steinfeldt for an unearned run and moving Tinker and Evers to second and third. Catcher Johnny Kling was then intentionally walked to load the bases and bring up the pitcher, still with only one out. Reulbach squeeze-bunted Tinker home for a second unearned run, moving Evers to third and Kling to second with two out. Solly Hofman followed with an infield single to shortstop Lee Tannehill, scoring Evers for a third unearned run, but when Kling tried to score from second, he was thrown out at home plate, ending the rally. The Cubs added a fourth unearned run in the third, ending Doc White&#x27;s day on the mound. The Sox scored in the bottom of the fifth inning with an unearned run, thanks to a wild pitch and an error. The Cubs scored three more runs, all earned, in the sixth and eighth to win Game 2 7–1 and tie the Series at one game apiece. Reulbach pitched the first one-hitter in World Series history.

=== Game 3 ===

After allowing two first-inning hits, Sox starter &quot;Big Ed&quot; Walsh didn&#x27;t give up another and struck out 12, giving the Sox a 2–1 edge in the series. After Fred Schulte&#x27;s first inning two-out double, Walsh retired the next 25 of 27 Cub batters to face him. Third baseman George Rohe cracked a two-out, bases-loaded triple to left in the top of the sixth off Jack Pfiester for the only runs of the game.

=== Game 4 ===

Looking to even the Series, the Cubs started Mordecai Brown on one day&#x27;s rest who pitched innings of no-hit ball for the Cubs before settling for a two-hitter. Nick Altrock, who faced and defeated Brown in game 1, was the hard-luck loser, with the only run of the game coming on Johnny Evers&#x27; two-out single in the top of the seventh scoring Frank Chance. The Sox put the tying run on second base in the top of the ninth thanks to a two-out walk and a passed ball, but Frank Isbell grounded out to end the threat. The game took just 96 minutes and evened the Series at two games apiece.

=== Game 5 ===

Game 5 was a wild affair with a total of 18 hits, ten walks, six errors, two hit batsmen, three wild pitches and a steal of home. The Cubs allowed a first inning run to the Sox, then scored three unearned runs on two Sox errors to take an early lead. The Sox tied the game in the third on George Davis&#x27; theft of home on the front end of a double steal and then took the lead for good with a four-run rally in the fourth and held on for the victory to take a 3–2 lead in the series. A 12-hit attack led by Frank Isbell&#x27;s four doubles were enough to overcome seven unearned runs by the Cubs caused by six errors committed by the normally solid Sox defense. &quot;Big&quot; Ed Walsh earned his second win of the series, although he needed three innings of relief help from Doc White.

=== Game 6 ===

Mordecai Brown, again pitching on only one day of rest, didn&#x27;t make it out of the second inning as the Hitless Wonders White Sox stunned the 116–36 Cubs in the Series finale. The Sox battered Brown for seven runs on eight hits while getting a solid pitching performance from Doc White. Although the Cubs scored a run and loaded the bases in the ninth, White got Frank Schulte to ground out for the final out of the series and the White Sox won the World Series.

The powerful Cubs went on to win the next two World Series from the Detroit Tigers, despite falling far short of 116 wins in either season, for the last Cubs win in a World Series for over a hundred years.

This game remains the only time the Chicago White Sox have clinched a postseason series in their home ballpark. It was the only time a Chicago-based team had ever clinched a series at home until the Cubs won the 2015 National League Division Series on their home field.

== Composite line score ==
1906 World Series (4–2): Chicago White Sox (A.L.) over Chicago Cubs (N.L.)
== Firsts and lasts ==

*The 1906 World Series was the first appearance in the World Series for both teams, and the first of three in a row for the Cubs. The White Sox next appeared in the World Series in . The next season that both Chicago teams qualified for the postseason was .
*This remains the most recent World Series to feature two franchises that had never before appeared in a World Series. The feat currently cannot be duplicated, barring further MLB expansion, as when the Washington Nationals reached the 2019 World Series, it left only one MLB team (the Seattle Mariners) that has never been to the Fall Classic.
*This was the first modern World Series contested between two teams based in the same city. Between 1921 and 1956, 13 World Series were held that had both teams based in New York City, which came to be called Subway Series.
*The 1906 World Series was the first World Series appearance for the Cubs&#x27; infield trio of Joe Tinker (shortstop), Johnny Evers (second base), and Frank Chance (first base), later the subjects of &quot;Baseball&#x27;s Sad Lexicon&quot; (&quot;Tinker to Evers to Chance&quot;). The trio hit a combined 9-for-59 (.153) in the series.
*Two future Hall of Fame pitchers appeared: Ed Walsh for the White Sox and Mordecai Brown for the Cubs. However, this pair did not pitch against each other in any game of the Series. Ed Walsh pitched the most dominant game of the Series in Game 3 based on a game score of 94, striking out 12 and allowing no runs on 2 hits in a complete game performance.
*In striking out 12 batters in Game 3, Walsh struck out at least one batter in all nine innings, the first pitcher to do so in a World Series game. Bob Gibson in the 1968 World Series opener was the next pitcher to accomplish this feat.
*The first five games of the Series were won by the road team. This unusual occurrence was duplicated exactly 90 years later in the 1996 World Series. The feat was duplicated again in the 2019 World Series.
*Doc White recorded the first ever World Series save in Game 5. Saves were not officially recognized as a statistic until 1969, but the stat has been retrofitted by historians.
*Games 1 and 2 were played amid snow flurries in Chicago. This next happened in a World Series in .
*Bill O&#x27;Neill of the White Sox became the first pinch runner in series history during the sixth inning of Game 3 when he came in to run for Eddie Hahn.
*White Sox outfielder Patsy Dougherty became the first player both to play in and to win two World Series. He had previously played for the Boston Americans in the 1903 World Series.
*Both White Sox catcher Billy Sullivan and Cubs outfielder Jimmy Sheckard went 0-21 in the series, establishing a World Series record for most at-bats in a series without recording a hit that wouldn&#x27;t be broken until 1968; Sullivan&#x27;s 22 plate appearances without reaching base remains a World Series record.

<doc id="1332397" wikidata="Q6988867" url="?curid=1332397" title="Neil Lomax">
<text>Neil Vincent Lomax (born February 17, 1959) is an American former professional football player who was a quarterback in the National Football League (NFL), playing his entire career for the St. Louis / Phoenix Cardinals. He played college football for the Portland State Vikings, setting numerous National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) passing records running head coach Mouse Davis&#x27;s run and shoot offense. Lomax was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1996.

==College career==
From Lake Oswego, Oregon, a suburb south of Portland, Lomax was a standout College football player at Portland State University, going from fifth-string freshman quarterback in 1977 on a partial scholarship to emergency starter to NCAA legend in the run and shoot offense of head coach Mouse Davis. By the end of his college career in 1980, he held 90 NCAA records, including seven touchdown passes in the first quarter against Delaware State, which ended in a 105–0 shutout for the Division I-AA Vikings.
Two weeks earlier, independent Portland State crushed Division II Cal Poly Pomona 93–7. In his final collegiate game, Lomax threw for 474 yards with five touchdown passes as PSU waxed Weber State 75–0 to finish at 8–3; he ended his college career with more than passing and over a hundred touchdown passes.

Lomax also had a game at Division II Northern Colorado in 1979 where he was 44/77 for 499 yards passing. As of 2012, that game ranks fourth all-time at Portland State for yards thrown in a game. 
He graduated with a degree in communications in 1981. He was inducted into the Portland State Athletics Hall of Fame in 1997 and had his #11 retired by the university.

=== College statistics ===
==Professional career==
Lomax was selected by the St. Louis Cardinals in the second round of the 1981 NFL draft, the 33rd overall pick. Despite his college heroics, he had an up-and-down nine-year career for some very mediocre Cardinals teams, displaying brilliance in his two Pro Bowl years (1984 and 1987), but also occasionally playing poorly enough to be benched.

In Lomax&#x27; first season in 1981, he played in 14 games while starting seven of them (with 15-year veteran Jim Hart starting the other nine), going 4–3 while throwing four touchdowns and ten interceptions while passing for 1,575 yards on a 50.4 completion percentage. In the strike-shortened nine-game season of 1982, Lomax started every game, passing for 1,367 yards for five touchdowns and six interceptions while having a 53.2 completion percentage. Lomax started the playoff game that the Cardinals had against the Green Bay Packers, throwing 32-of-51 for 385 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions, but the Cardinals lost 41–16. It was his only playoff appearance.

Lomax started 13 games the following year while Hart started the other three. He went 7–5–1 while throwing for 2,636 yards with 24 touchdowns and 11 interceptions for a 59.0% completion percentage, but the team failed to return to the postseason, finishing 8–7–1 after starting the season 1–5.

On January 3, 1984, the Cardinals released Jim Hart and Lomax became the permanent starter, starting in every game, and he had his best season yet, throwing for 4,614 yards, 28 touchdowns, and 16 interceptions on a 61.6% completion percentage, all career highs. His passing yards rank 20th all-time for a season. He was named to the Pro Bowl that year. Although the Cardinals finished 9–7, the head-to-head record with the New York Giants and the Dallas Cowboys (for which the Cardinals went a combined 2–2, along with losing the season finale against the Washington Redskins) meant that St. Louis lost out on a playoff spot. Lomax started in each game again in 1985, but the team went 5–11, as he threw for 18 touchdowns and 12 interceptions on 3,214 yards and a 56.3% completion percentage. For 1986, Lomax started 14 games while Cliff Stoudt started the other two, with the former going 4–9–1 over the latter&#x27;s 0–2 record. He threw for 2,583 yards while having 13 touchdowns and 12 interceptions on a 57.0% completion percentage. The following season was both Lomax&#x27;s penultimate year as a Cardinal and the final one for the team in St. Louis. He started in 12 games, with Shawn Halloran (who started two games and went 1–1) and Sammy Garza (who started one game, losing it) doing the others; Lomax went 6-6 while throwing for 3,387 yards with 24 touchdowns and 12 interceptions for a 59.4% completion percentage. He was named to the Pro Bowl that year. In his final year in 1988, the Cardinals&#x27; first in Arizona, Lomax started 14 games (while Cliff Stoudt started two others) and went 7–7, throwing for 20 touchdowns and 11 interceptions for 3,395 yards and a 57.6 completion percentage.

Lomax was forced to retire before the 1990 season (after missing all of 1989) due to a severely arthritic hip. In 1991, he underwent hip replacement surgery. Lomax finished with a career record of 47–52–2, 136 touchdowns, and over 22,000 yards passing, with those categories (along with completions and attempts) being second most as a Cardinal, after Hart.

Lomax was the head coach for Fort Vancouver High School in Vancouver, Washington for two seasons before resigning in January 2020. He resigned as his commute from Wilsonville, Oregon was too much. He is now an assistant coach, for quarterbacks, at George Fox University.

<text>USS &quot;Plymouth&quot;, a wooden-hulled screw sloop-of-war, was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for Plymouth, Massachusetts.

&quot;Plymouth&quot;&#x27;s keel was laid down as Kenosha at the New York Navy Yard in 1867; completed in 1868; and commissioned on 20 January 1869 with Captain William H. McComb in command.

==Service history==
&quot;Kenosha&quot; got underway eastward across the Atlantic on 25 February 1869. While on the European Station she was renamed &quot;Plymouth&quot; on 15 May 1869. Word of the change reached her at Ville Franche, on 26 June. She then cruised off the Levant and North Africa under her new name, returning to Marseilles on 19 November. From southern France, she continued on to Portsmouth, England, whence she accompanied the British turreted battleship , carrying the remains of George Peabody, American merchant, financier and philanthropist, to the United States for burial. Arriving at Portland, Maine, on 25 January 1870, she remained there on ceremonial duty until sailing for Portsmouth, New Hampshire, for refit at the navy yard.

&quot;Plymouth&quot; departed New York on 12 July 1870 and steamed to the Mediterranean Sea where Rear Admiral Charles Boggs selected her as flagship of the European Station, 21 September. During &quot;Plymouth&quot;&#x27;s service in the European Station, two sailors and one marine were awarded the Medal of Honor for rescuing others from drowning: Quarter Gunner George Holt and Landsman Paul Tobin at the Port of Hamburg, Germany, on 3 July 1871 and Corporal James A. Stewart at Ville Franche, France, on 1 February 1872. The ship sailed for the coast of Africa on 17 February 1872, thence headed home via the West Indies and remained on the Atlantic coast until returning to European waters 1 November 1872. This deployment lasted until the screw sloop sailed for home 6 June 1873. She arrived at New York City on 18 June, thence proceeded to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, where she decommissioned on 28 June.

Recommissioned 10 October 1874, the sloop operated along the Atlantic coast and in the Caribbean Sea. Under the command of Captain Edward Barrett, &quot;Plymouth&quot; was sent by the Government to attend the closing of the International Expo. Barrett was also the first to test the Eads jetties in the spring of 1877.

In the spring and summer of 1876, Captain Edward Barrett nominated six of her sailors for the Medal of Honor for rescuing or attempting to rescue others from drowning: Captain of the Mizzen Top Albert Weisbogel at sea on 27 April; Seaman Emile Lejeune at Port Royal, South Carolina, on 6 June; Landsman William Corey, Seaman Charles Gidding, and Ordinary Seaman Thomas Kersey at the Brooklyn Navy Yard on 26 July; and Ordinary Seaman Michael Connolly at Halifax Harbor, Nova Scotia, on 7 August.

On the occasion of Great Railroad Strike of 1877, Captain Barrett was called to Washington, where he organized a brigade of naval sailors and marines for the protection of the city and public establishments and held the command of the first aid force until all danger had passed. &quot;Plymouth&quot; was employed sailing up the Potomac River, with Lieutenant Benjamin Tilley.

&quot;Plymouth&quot; decommissioned again 17 May 1879, and remained in ordinary at Portsmouth until scrapped in 1884.

<text>Sumner is a lunar impact crater on the far side of the Moon, beyond the northeastern limb. It is southwest of the larger crater Szilard, and southeast of the twin walled plains Fabry and Harkhebi.

This crater formation has been heavily damaged by a history of impacts, leaving an irregular, battered outer rim. A smaller impact crater has merged into the southern rim; the northern rim is little more than an irregular, arcing range of ridges. The interior is nearly as irregular, and the entire formation is little more than a rugged depression in the surface.

The crater is named after American geographer and navigator Thomas Hubbard Sumner. The name was approved by the IAU in 1970.

Starting about 30 kilometers to the north of Sumner and progressing to the east-southeast is a long, linear chain of craters that forms an irregular cleft in the surface. This formation is named &quot;Catena Sumner&quot;. It progresses to the northeast rim of Harriot A, a satellite crater of Harriot.

==Satellite craters==
By convention, these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Sumner.

<doc id="1332407" wikidata="Q3426832" url="?curid=1332407" title="Walsham How">
<text>William Walsham How (13 December 182310 August 1897) was an English Anglican bishop.

Known as Walsham How, he was the son of a Shrewsbury solicitor; How was educated at Shrewsbury School, Wadham College, Oxford and University College, Durham. He was ordained in 1846, and after a curacy at Kidderminster, began more than thirty years actively engaged in parish work in Shropshire, as curate at the Abbey Church in Shrewsbury in 1848. In 1851 he became Rector of Whittington and was at one point Rural Dean of Oswestry in 1860, then Suffragan Bishop of Bedford (for East London) and in turn Bishop of Wakefield.

==Writings==
It was during his period at Whittington he wrote the bulk of his published works and founded the first public library in Oswestry. In 1863–1868 he brought out a &quot;Commentary on the Four Gospels&quot; and he also wrote a manual for the Holy Communion. Published by the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge during the 1890s under the title &quot;Holy Communion, Preparation and Companion...together with the Collects, Epistles and Gospels&quot; this book was widely distributed and many copies still survive today. In the movement for infusing new spiritual life into the church services, especially among the poor, How was a great force. He took a stand against what he regarded as immoral literature and Thomas Hardy claimed that he had burned a copy of his novel &quot;Jude the Obscure&quot;. How was much helped in his earlier work by his wife, Frances A. Douglas (died 1887).

===Contributions to botany===
Walsham How &quot;had an excellent knowledge of the British flora.&quot; In 1857 he was one of the founders of the Oswestry and Welshpool Naturalists&#x27; Field Club and Archaeological Society. He was at one time its president, and he contributed a paper on &quot;The Botany of Great Orme&#x27;s Head&quot; (1865). He was also the botanical contributor to &quot;The Gossiping Guide for Wales.&quot; In 1890 he was president of the Yorkshire Naturalists&#x27; Union. His obituary in respect of his contribution to botany was published in the October 1897 issue of &quot;The Naturalist.&quot;

==Church work==

He refused preferment on several occasions, but his energy and success made him well known, and in 1879 he was consecrated a bishop, by Archibald Campbell Tait, Archbishop of Canterbury, on 25 July at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral; he became the first modern suffragan bishop in London, under the title of Bishop of Bedford, his province being the East End. There he became the inspiring influence of a revival of church work. He founded the East London Church Fund, and enlisted a large band of enthusiastic helpers, his popularity among all classes being immense. He was particularly fond of children, and was commonly called &quot;the children&#x27;s bishop&quot;.

When he came to East London in 1879 &quot;he found great need of women&#x27;s help for the poor in the huge parishes of his diocese&quot;. He then planned to establish a Deaconess Community and applied to the (West) London Diocesan Deaconess Institution (LDDI). The LDDI sent its Sister Louisa in autumn 1880 and the East London Diocesan Deaconess Institution was founded at Sutton Place, Hackney. Deaconess Sisters worked in various East London parishes and eventually the Institution became the All Saints Deaconess Home at Meynell Crescent (1894/5-1924). A few of the remaining Sisters joined the LDDI which continued work in the East End for a few years.

==Bishopric==
After being offered, but declined, the Bishopric of Manchester in 1885 and after his wife&#x27;s death, he was in 1888 made the first Bishop of Wakefield, and in the north of England he continued to do valuable work. His sermons were straightforward, earnest and attractive; and besides publishing several volumes of these, he wrote a good deal of verse, including such well-known hymns as &quot;Who is this so weak and helpless&quot;, &quot;Lord, Thy children guide and keep&quot; and &quot;For All the Saints&quot;. As bishop he consecrated many churches, including the Church of St John the Divine, Calder Grove in 1892.

==Death==

He died while on holiday in Ireland, on 10 August 1897 in Leenane, County Mayo. Although there is a marble memorial to him in Wakefield Cathedral, he was buried in Whittington, Shropshire, where he had been rector for 28 years. There is also a memorial plaque to him inside the London city church of St Helen&#x27;s, Bishopsgate, bearing the line &quot;Sweet is the calm of Paradise the blest&quot; from his hymn, &quot;For all the saints&quot;.

==Hymns==

A careful search of hymn books gives at least 36 of his hymns published for wider circulation. &quot;The Church Hymnal for the Christian Year&quot; (1917 revised 1920) has the greatest number, 26 in total plus another 2 which were amended by How. The Baptist Hymn Book of 1964 has 11 hymns.

&quot;The Church Hymnal&quot; gives dates for hymns. From these, the most prolific year for How&#x27;s hymn writing was 1871, the date given for 10 of his hymns. This was during his time at Whittington.

How is represented in &quot;The Church Hymn Book&quot; (1872) with three hymns:
*&quot;Jesus! name of wondrous love&quot; (n. 794), 1854,
*&quot;Soldiers of the cross, arise&quot; (n. 1212), 1854,
*&quot;We give thee but thine own&quot; (n. 1264), 1854;

and in &quot;Hymns Ancient and Modern&quot;, Revised edition with several others

*&quot;Lord Jesus, when we stand afar&quot; (n. 109),
*&quot;O Jesu, thou art standing&quot; (n. 355),
*&quot;O my Saviour, lifted from the earth for me&quot; (n. 360),
*&quot;It is a thing most wonderful&quot; (n. 435),
*&quot;For all the Saints, who from their labours rest&quot; (n. 527),
*&quot;Thou art the Christ, O Lord&quot; (n. 555),
*&quot;To Thee, Our God, we fly&quot; (n. 606).

==Depictions==
How appears as a significant character in Bernard Pomerance&#x27;s 1979 Broadway play &quot;The Elephant Man&quot;. In a 1982 television adaptation he was played by William Hutt.

<text>Joseph Rayner Stephens (8 March 1805 – 18 February 1879) was a Methodist minister who offended the Wesleyan Conference by his support for separating the Church of England from the State. Resigning from the Wesleyan Connection, he became free to campaign for factory reform, and against the New Poor Law. He became associated with &#x27;physical force&#x27; Chartism (although he later denied he had ever been a Chartist) and spent eighteen months in jail for his presence at an unlawful assembly and his use there of seditious language. 
Born in Edinburgh in 1805, he moved to Manchester when his minister father was posted there in 1819. During his religious career, he worked in a variety of places (including Stockholm and Newcastle-upon-Tyne) before arriving in Ashton-under-Lyne in 1832. He was the brother of the philologist George Stephens.; three of his other brothers (John, Edward and Samuel) emigrated to Southern Australia and played their parts in the early years of that colony.

== Leaves Wesleyan Methodism ==
Stephens gave a number of talks in favour of disestablishment and became secretary of the Ashton branch of a society arguing for disestablishment. His district conference attempted to discipline him for engaging in controversial political activity, and for taking a view on Church Establishment contrary to that of Wesleyans and of John Wesley. Stephens was willing to accept a temporary suspension on most points, but not on deviation from the views of Wesley, in whose writings he found views matching his own. The national conference nonetheless asserted that true Wesleyans were in favour of the existence of an Established Church and lengthened his suspension: Stephens resigned and set up his own &quot;Stephenite&quot; churches in Ashton-under-Lyne and Stalybridge.

==Political agitation==

He became active in the movement for factory reform and in the anti-Poor Law movement. In both sermons and speeches he denounced the practices of millowners and the intentions of the new Poor Law as un-Christian and hence doomed to end in social upheaval and bloodshed. Like Richard Oastler he held Tory views on most issues; like Oastler he advised his followers that it was legal to arm themselves and that government would pay more attention to their views if they did. He and Oastler (who saw the younger man as his natural successor) became associated with the Chartists, who also saw the new Poor Law, the rapacity and inhumanity of employers and the poverty of workers as issues requiring urgent attention, but sought to remedy them by fundamental political change. Whereas Oastler openly opposed the constitutional aspirations of the Chartists, and did not become involved in Chartism, Stephens addressed Chartist meetings and was elected a delegate to the National Conference. However, as he later told his congregation, he was never a Radical, let alone a &#x27;five-point man&#x27; : &quot;I would rather walk to London on my bare knees, on sharp flint stones to attend an Anti-poor Law meeting, than be carried to London in a coach and six, pillowed with down to present that petition - the &quot;national petition&quot; to the House of Commons&quot; Nor did his advice to followers to arm themselves indicate any support for &#x27;physical force&#x27; Chartism or the overthrow of the existing order by violence or by general strike: &quot;My friends, never put your trust in, and never follow after, men who pretend to be able to manufacture a revolution. A revolution, a rolling away of the whole from evil to good, from wrong to right, from injustice and oppression to righteousness and equal rule, never yet was manufactured, and never will be manufactured. God, who teaches you what your rights are, what the blessings He has endowed you withal, will, in his own good time, if that time should come - God will teach your hands to war, and your fingers to fight&quot;

==Imprisonment==
In December 1838, Stephens was arrested, charged with having participated in a tumultuous assembly at Leigh on 13 November 1838 and having incited the meeting to violence against inhabitants of the neighbourhood. A Lancashire grand jury returned a true bill both for the Leigh meeting and for sermons preached in Ashton-under-Lyne: however Stephens was eventually tried at Chester in connection with a meeting at Hyde (then in Cheshire) on 14 November 1838. Stephens was charged with attending &quot;an unlawful meeting , seditiously and tumultuously met together by torch-light, and with fire-arms disturbing the public peace&quot; and two counts of speaking at the meeting. Witnesses said attendance at the meeting had been about 5,000 mostly from outside Hyde, firearms had been discharged, banners with slogans such as &quot;Tyrants, believe, and tremble&quot; and &quot;BLOOD&quot; had been displayed and the meeting had not broken up until midnight. It had been successfully argued (to secure the conviction of Orator Hunt in the aftermath of the Peterloo massacre) that to be unlawful a meeting need only be &quot;one such that taking all the circumstances into consideration cannot but endanger the public peace, and raise fears and jealousies among the king&#x27;s subjects&quot;. Stephens was convicted and sentenced to eighteen months&#x27; imprisonment. He served his sentence in Chester Castle, under far from onerous conditions, and was released eight days early, to allow him to attend his father&#x27;s funeral.

==Later life==

Heavy sureties had to be given for his good behaviour for the next five years, and he did not resume public speaking until participating in a campaign for better enforcement of the Ten Hours&#x27; Act, the Factory Act 1833 (3 &amp; 4 Will. 4. c. 103) (i.e. against the relay system) in 1849, explicitly holding non-compliance and non-enforcement to be responsible for social unrest and the more extreme forms that manifested itself in: &quot;It is the practice of injustice towards the poor which estranges them from the institutions of their country, and leads them into many wild and unreasoning projects to obtain deliverance from the intolerable yoke that has been fastened upon them&quot; He supported opposition to the &#x27;Compromise Act&#x27;, the Factories Act 1850 (13 &amp; 14 Vict. c. 54), and took part in abortive campaigns for legislation for a true ten-hour day enforced by stoppage of machinery. In 1857, he looked back on his agitational heyday 
History would do justice to the memory of the benevolent and heroic men who had first devoted themselves to this great work (&quot;factory reform&quot;). Nothing gave him so much satisfaction in the retrospect, as the humble part he had been permitted to take in this good cause. That he, with them, had been misunderstood, misrepresented, and maligned, was only what was to be expected in the nature of things. It was a hard battle, and he had fought it; hard things had to be said and he had said them. It was no kid glove work they had to do, but work that required roughish handling. He had been impelled by a stern sense of duty in all he had done, and whilst doing it had never stayed to sigh over the sorrow, or quail before the opposition he had encountered. He was too busy and too proud to turn aside to enter into explanations and defence, knowing well that if he died in harness his motives would receive posthumous vindication; that if he lived the battle out, he should live misrepresentation and prejudice down. And so it had proved
He campaigned on the inadequacy and mal-distribution of relief during the Cotton Famine; attention was drawn to this and to Stephens&#x27; past history when there were riots on the relief issue in Stalybridge. In 1868 he lectured against disestablishment of the Irish Church. 
Stephens is buried in St John&#x27;s Church, Dukinfield and commemorated by a blue plaque placed on the remains of the former Stalybridge Town Hall and an obelisk monument in Stamford Park. Rayner Stephens High School in Dukinfield is named after him.

<doc id="1332432" wikidata="Q711629" url="?curid=1332432" title="Richard March Hoe">
<text>Richard March Hoe (middle name spelled in some 1920s records as &quot;Marsh&quot;; September 12, 1812 – June 7, 1886) was an American inventor from New York City who designed a rotary printing press identical to Josiah Warren&#x27;s original invention, and related advancements, including the &quot;Hoe web perfecting press&quot; in 1871; it used a continuous roll of paper and revolutionized newspaper publishing.

==Biography==
Richard March Hoe was born in New York City, the son of Robert Hoe (1784–1833), an English-born American mechanic from Leicestershire. His brothers were Peter Smith Hoe and Robert Hoe II.

His father, with brothers-in-law Peter and Matthew Smith, established a steam-powered manufactory of printing presses in New York City. At the age of fifteen, Richard joined their enterprise. Several years later in 1833, he became a senior member of his father&#x27;s firm R. Hoe &amp; Company. After his father&#x27;s death that year, Hoe became head of the company. He was joined later by his younger brothers Robert Hoe II (1815–1884) and Peter Smith Hoe (1821–1902).

Richard Hoe married Lucy Gilbert Hoe (1813 – November 9, 1841) and had two daughters, Emily Amelia Hoe and Adeline Hoe. Both of these daughters married brothers Cyrus and DeWitt Lawrence. After Lucy died at the young age of 28, Richard married Anne Corbin Platt Hoe, with whom he had two additional daughters, Anne Corbin Hoe Platt (1852–1887) and Mary Gilbert Hoe Harper (1854–1925). His daughter, Anne, died at the young age of 34 during childbirth, and both twins died as well. Although he lived much of his life in New York City, he spent years renovating &quot;Brightside&quot; and gradually moved the family there about 1857. The manor house was situated on 53 acres in the Bronx. Hoe died on June 7, 1886, in Florence, Italy.

==Inventions==
Early on, Hoe added the production of steel saws to his business and introduced improvements to their manufacture. In 1837, he visited England and obtained a patent for a better process of grinding saws. In connection with his factory, Hoe established an apprentice&#x27;s school where free instruction was given.

He is most well known for his invention in 1843 of a rotary printing press, based on an identical invention unveiled in New York in 1832 by Josiah Warren. Warren chose not to patent his press design, so Hoe was free to imitate it. Type was placed on a revolving cylinder, a design that could print much faster than the old flatbed printing press. It received in 1847, and was placed in commercial use the same year. Arunah Shepherdson Abell, publisher of &quot;The Sun&quot; in Baltimore, was among the first to buy it and put it into use. In its early days, it was variously called the &quot;Hoe lightning press,&quot; and &quot;Hoe&#x27;s Cylindrical-Bed Press.&quot;

In 1870 Hoe developed a rotary press that printed both sides of a page in a single operation, what he called the &quot;Hoe web perfecting press.&quot; Hoe&#x27;s press used a continuous roll of paper five miles long, which was put through the machine at the rate of a minute. As the roll emerged, it passed over a knife which cut pages apart; they were next run through an apparatus which folded the pages for the mail or for carriers. These completely printed and folded newspapers were delivered as quickly as the eye could follow them. It produced 18,000 papers an hour and was used the first time by the &quot;New York Tribune&quot;.

Hoe was a Freemason. He died while traveling in 1886 in Florence, Italy. His nephew, Robert Hoe (1839–1909), wrote a notable &quot;Short History of the Printing Press&quot; (1902). He also made further improvements in printing.

Although Hoe was known for his rotary printing press, he also had much practice before, since he took on his fathers work after he retired, he perfected many cylinder presses, and he continued to improve, eventually creating his prize invention, the hoe lightning press.

==Brightside estate==
Hoe lived with his wife, Mary, and children on a estate, called Brightside, in the Morrisania/Hunts Point section of the Bronx. Richard&#x27;s brother, Peter Smith Hoe, also had a house (Sunnyslope) on the same estate. This building still stands at the corner of Faile Street and Lafayette Avenue and houses the Bright Temple African Methodist Episcopal Church. His family sold the estate in 1904 to developers speculating on an expansion of the New York City Subway into the Bronx.Several streets in the area are named after historical figures in the printing industry. Aldus Street was named after Aldo Manuzio. Guttenberg Street (with two &quot;t&quot;s) was named after Johannes Gutenberg; it was renamed East 165th Street in 1911.  Hoe Avenue runs north from what is now Bruckner Boulevard. Printer&#x27;s Park is located at the former site of his mansion, at the corner on Aldus Street and Hoe Avenue in the Bronx. The newly reconstructed park re-opened in April 2010, equipped with a play structure inspired by the rotary printing press.

<text>INAP stands for Intelligent Network Application Protocol or Intelligent Network Application Part. It is the signalling protocol used in Intelligent Networking (IN). It is part of the Signalling System No. 7 (SS7) protocol suite, typically layered on top of the Transaction Capabilities Application Part (TCAP). It can also be termed as logic for controlling telecommunication services migrated from traditional switching points to computer based service independent platform. 

==Applications==
The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) defines several &quot;capability levels&quot; for this protocol, starting with Capability Set 1 (CS-1). A typical application for the IN is a Number Translation service. For example, in the United Kingdom, 0800 numbers are freephone numbers and are translated to a geographic number using an IN platform. The Telephone exchanges decode the 0800 numbers to an IN trigger and the exchange connects to the IN.

The telephone exchange uses Transaction Capabilities Application Part (TCAP), Signaling Connection and Control Part (SCCP) and INAP and in IN terms is a service switching point (SSP). It sends an INAP Initial Detection Point (IDP) message to the service control point (SCP). The SCP returns an INAP Connect message, which contains a geographic number to forward the call to.

INAP messages are defined using ASN.1 encoding. SCCP is used for the routing. Extended form of INAP is Customised Applications for Mobile networks Enhanced Logic (CAMEL). TCAP is used to separate the transactions into discrete units.

<text>Gottlieb Hufeland (29 October 1760 – 25 February 1817) was a German economist and jurist.

==Biography==
Born in Danzig (Gdańsk), Royal Prussia, Crown of Poland, Hufeland was educated at the gymnasium of his native town, and completed his university studies at Leipzig and Göttingen. He graduated at Jena, and in 1788 was there appointed to an extraordinary professorship. Five years later he was made ordinary professor.

His lectures on natural law, in which he developed with great acuteness and skill the formal principles of the Kantian theory of legislation, attracted a large audience, and contributed to raise to its height the fame of the University of Jena, then unusually rich in able teachers. In 1803, after the departure of many of his colleagues from Jena, Hufeland accepted a call to Würzburg, from which, after but a brief tenure of a professorial chair, he proceeded to Landshut. From 1806 to 1812 he acted as burgomaster in his native town of Danzig. Returning to Landshut, he lived there until 1816, when he was invited to the University of Halle.

In political economy Hufeland&#x27;s chief work is the &quot;Neue Grundlegung der Staatswirthschaftskunst&quot; (2 vols, 1807 and 1813), the second volume of which has the special title, &quot;Lehre vom Gelde und Geldumlaufe&quot;. The principles of this work are for the most part those of Adam Smith&#x27;s &quot;Wealth of Nations&quot;, which were then beginning to be accepted and developed in Germany; but both in his treatment of fundamental notions, such as economic good and value, and in details, such as the theory of money, Hufeland&#x27;s treatment has a certain originality.

Two points in particular seem deserving of notice. Hufeland was the first among German economists to point out the profit of the &quot;entrepreneur&quot; as a distinct species of revenue with laws peculiar to itself. He also tends towards, though he does not explicitly state the view that rent is a general term applicable to all payments resulting from differences of degree among productive forces of the same order. Thus the superior gain of a specially gifted workman or specially skilled employer is in time assimilated to the payment for a natural agency of more than the minimum efficiency.

Hufeland died in 1817 in Halle an der Saale.

==Works==
Hufeland&#x27;s works on the theory of legislation:
*&quot;Versuch über den Grundsatz Naturrechts&quot; (1785)
*&quot;Lehrbuch des Naturrechts&quot; (1790)
*&quot;Institutionen des gesammten positiven Rechts&quot; (1798)
*&quot;Lehrbuch der Geschichte und Encyclopadie alter in Deutschland geltenden positiven Rechte&quot; (1790)
They are distinguished by precision of statement and clearness of deduction.

<text>John Horrocks (27 March 1768 – 1 March 1804) was an English cotton manufacturer and Member of Parliament for Preston.

==Early life==
He was born in Bradshaw, Lancashire, the son of John Horrocks, owner of a stone quarry, and his wife Jane Booth, the younger of two surviving sons in a family of 18 children. His father, a Quaker, was a manufacturer of stone printing tables for textiles in Edgworth. David Hunt in his 1992 &quot;History of Preston&quot; comments that many details of his early life are confused. While still young Horrocks worked in Edgworth for Thomas Thomasson, in the cotton trade, who sent him to school in central Manchester but died in 1782.

==Business career==

The Lancashire cotton industry was then in its infancy. Horrocks, impressed with its potential, set up spinning-frames in a corner of his father&#x27;s premises. For a time he combined cotton-spinning on a small scale with stone-working, but eventually concentrated on cotton. About 1791 he moved to Preston, where he began to manufacture cotton shirtings and long-cloths in addition to spinning cotton yarn.

Horrocks took advantage of machinery. By maintaining the quality of his goods, he developed his business rapidly. He was aided by the local financier Richard Newsham (1754–1843), who became a partner, and Thomas Greaves. Within a year of his arrival in Preston he built his first large mill. Shortly after he obtained a monopoly of the manufacture of cottons and muslins for the Indian market from the British East India Company. He took on first his elder brother Samuel Horrocks, and in 1801 John Whitehead and Thomas Miller into partnership. The firm then traded as Horrockses, Miller, &amp; Co.

==In politics==
In 1794, Horrocks was chosen as a burgess and served as Town Bailiff in 1794–5. He was elected as a council member in 1796 and became an Alderman in 1799.

Horrocks attempted to enter national politics in the 1796 general election, standing for the Preston seat. He had some initial backing from Thomas Tarleton of Liverpool. It was a two-member constituency, with Sir Henry Hoghton, 7th Baronet as sitting member who was standing again, and Edward Smith Stanley making his political debut as a Whig candidate. Tarleton withdrew, but Horrocks had Tory support locally from the Grimshaw family, and from Lord Liverpool. He forced Hoghton and particularly Stanley to spend heavily, and came third in a close contest, 14 votes behind Hoghton.

In 1802, Horrocks entered parliament as Tory member for Preston. Stanley then tried to undermine his economic base, by investing in Preston rivals Watson, Myers Co. After his death less than two years later, his brother Samuel Horrocks took over his seat in an uncontested by-election, Sir Thomas Dalrymple Hesketh, 3rd Baronet having held back.

==Death and legacy==

Horrocks died in London of brain fever, reportedly resulting from over-work. During his 13 years in Preston he had amassed a personal fortune of at least £150,000, and set the foundations for the Horrocks-Miller mill owning dynasty that dominated Preston into the mid-nineteenth century.

In 1801 Horrocks built &quot;The Lodge&quot; (later called Penwortham Hall) in Penwortham as a residence for himself. The property, which is a Grade II listed building, is today used as a series of private dwellings. He died in 1804 and was buried at St Mary&#x27;s Church, Penwortham. John Horrocks Way, part of the Penwortham bypass, is named after him. He was the grandfather of explorer John Horrocks.

<doc id="1332480" wikidata="Q1261223" url="?curid=1332480" title="Liberal paradox">
<text>The liberal paradox, also Sen paradox or Sen&#x27;s paradox, is a logical paradox proposed by Amartya Sen which shows that no means of aggregating individual preferences into a single, social choice, can simultaneously fulfill the following, seemingly mild conditions:
# The &quot;unrestrictedness condition&quot;, or &quot;U&quot;: every possible ranking of each individual&#x27;s preferences and all outcomes of every possible voting rule will be considered equally,
# The &quot;Pareto condition&quot;, or &quot;P&quot;: if everybody individually likes some choice better at the same time, the society in its voting rule as a whole likes it better as well, and
# &quot;Liberalism&quot;, or &quot;L&quot; (from which the theorem derives its gist): all individuals in a society must have at least one possibility of choosing differently, so that the social choice under a given voting rule changes as well. That is, as an individual liberal, anyone can exert their freedom of choice at least in some decision with tangible results.

Sen&#x27;s result shows that this is impossible. The three, rather minimalistic, assumptions cannot all hold together. The paradox—more properly called a proof of contradiction, and a paradox only in the sense of informal logic—is contentious because it appears to contradict the classical liberal idea that markets are both Pareto-efficient and respect individual freedoms.

Sen&#x27;s proof, set in the context of social choice theory, is similar in many respects to Arrow&#x27;s impossibility theorem and the Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem. As a mathematical construct, it also has much wider applicability: it is essentially about cyclical majorities between partially ordered sets, of which at least three must participate in order to give rise to the phenomenon. Since the idea is about pure mathematics and logic, similar arguments abound much further afield. They, for example, lead to the necessity of the fifth normal form in relational database design. The history of the argument also goes deeper, Condorcet&#x27;s paradox perhaps being the first example of the finite sort.

==Pareto efficiency==
===Definition===
A particular distribution of goods or outcome of any social process is regarded as &quot;Pareto-efficient&quot; if there is no way to improve one or more people&#x27;s situations without harming another. Put another way, an outcome is not Pareto-efficient if there is a way to improve at least one person&#x27;s situation without harming anyone else.

For example, suppose a mother has ten dollars which she intends to give to her two children Carlos and Shannon. Suppose the children each want only money, and they do not get jealous of one another. The following distributions are Pareto-efficient:

However, a distribution where the mother gives each of them $2 and wastes the remaining $6 is not Pareto-efficient, because she could have given the wasted money to either child and made that child better off without harming the other.

In this example, it was presumed that a child was made better or worse off by gaining or losing money, respectively, and that neither child gained or lost by evaluating her share in comparison to the other. To be more precise, we must evaluate all possible preferences that the child might have and consider a situation as Pareto-efficient if there is no other social state that at least one person favors (or prefers) and no one disfavors.

===Use in economics===
Pareto efficiency is often used in economics as a minimal sense of economic efficiency. If a mechanism does not result in Pareto-efficient outcomes, it is regarded as inefficient, since there was another outcome that could have made some people better off without harming anyone else.

The view that markets produce Pareto-efficient outcomes is regarded as an important and central justification for capitalism. This result was established (with certain assumptions) in an area of study known as general equilibrium theory and is known as the first fundamental theorem of welfare economics. As a result, these results often feature prominently in conservative libertarian justifications of unregulated markets.

==Two examples==

===Sen&#x27;s original example===
Sen&#x27;s original example used a simple society with only two people and only one social issue to consider. The two members of society are named &quot;Lewd&quot; and &quot;Prude&quot;. In this society there is a copy of a &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot; and it must be given either to Lewd to read, to Prude to read, or disposed of - unread. Suppose that Lewd enjoys this sort of reading and would prefer to read it rather than have it disposed of. However, they would get even more enjoyment out of Prude being forced to read it.

Prude thinks that the book is indecent and that it should be disposed of, unread. However, if someone must read it, Prude would prefer to read it rather than Lewd since Prude thinks it would be even worse for someone to read and enjoy the book rather than read it in disgust.

Given these preferences of the two individuals in the society, a social planner must decide what to do. Should the planner force Lewd to read the book, force Prude to read the book or let it go unread? More particularly, the social planner must rank all three possible outcomes in terms of their social desirability. The social planner decides that they should be committed to individual rights, each individual should get to choose whether they, themself will read the book. Lewd should get to decide whether the outcome &quot;Lewd reads&quot; will be ranked higher than &quot;No one reads&quot;, and similarly Prude should get to decide whether the outcome &quot;Prude reads&quot; will be ranked higher than &quot;No one reads&quot;.

Following this strategy, the social planner declares that the outcome &quot;Lewd reads&quot; will be ranked higher than &quot;No one reads&quot; (because of Lewd&#x27;s preferences) and that &quot;No one reads&quot; will be ranked higher than &quot;Prude reads&quot; (because of Prude&#x27;s preferences). Consistency then requires that &quot;Lewd reads&quot; be ranked higher than &quot;Prude reads&quot;, and so the social planner gives the book to Lewd to read.

Notice that this outcome is regarded as worse than &quot;Prude reads&quot; by both Prude &quot;and&quot; Lewd, and the chosen outcome is therefore Pareto inferior to another available outcome—the one where Prude is forced to read the book.

===Gibbard&#x27;s example===
Another example was provided by philosopher Allan Gibbard. Suppose there are two individuals Alice and Bob who live next door to each other. Alice loves the color blue and hates red. Bob loves the color green and hates yellow. If each were free to choose the color of their house independently of the other, they would choose their favorite colors. But Alice hates Bob with a passion, and she would gladly endure a red house if it meant that Bob would have to endure his house being yellow. Bob similarly hates Alice, and would gladly endure a yellow house if that meant that Alice would live in a red house.

If each individual is free to choose their own house color, independently of the other, Alice would choose a blue house and Bob would choose a green one. But, this outcome is not Pareto efficient, because both Alice and Bob would prefer the outcome where Alice&#x27;s house is red and Bob&#x27;s is yellow. As a result, giving each individual the freedom to choose their own house color has led to an inefficient outcome—one that is inferior to another outcome where neither is free to choose their own color.

Mathematically, we can represent Alice&#x27;s preferences with this symbol: formula_1 and Bob&#x27;s preferences with this one: formula_2. We can represent each outcome as a pair: (&quot;Color of Alice&#x27;s house&quot;, &quot;Color of Bob&#x27;s house&quot;). As stated Alice&#x27;s preferences are:

:(Blue, Yellow) formula_1 (Red, Yellow) formula_1 (Blue, Green) formula_1 (Red, Green)

And Bob&#x27;s are:

:(Red, Green) formula_2 (Red, Yellow) formula_2 (Blue, Green) formula_2 (Blue, Yellow)

If we allow free and independent choices of both parties we end up with the outcome (Blue, Green) which is dispreferred by both parties to the outcome (Red, Yellow) and is therefore not Pareto efficient.

==The theorem==
Suppose there is a society &quot;N&quot; consisting of two or more individuals and a set &quot;X&quot; of two or more social outcomes. (For example, in the Alice and Bob case, &quot;N&quot; consisted of Alice and Bob, and &quot;X&quot; consisted of the four color options ⟨Blue, Yellow⟩, ⟨Blue, Green⟩, ⟨Red, Yellow⟩, and ⟨Red, Green⟩.)

Suppose each individual in the society has a total and transitive preference relation on the set of social outcomes &quot;X&quot;. For notation, the preference relation of an individual &quot;i&quot;∊&quot;N&quot; is denoted by ≼&quot;i&quot;. Each preference relation belongs to the set &quot;Rel(X)&quot; of all total and transitive relations on &quot;X&quot;.

A social choice function is a map which can take any configuration of preference relations of &quot;N&quot; as input and produce a subset of (&quot;chosen&quot;) social outcomes as output. Formally, a social choice function is a map

formula_9
from the set of functions between &quot;N&quot;→&quot;Rel(X)&quot;, to the power set of &quot;X&quot;. (Intuitively, the social choice function represents a societal principle for choosing one or more social outcomes based on individuals&#x27; preferences. By representing the social choice process as a &quot;function&quot; on &quot;Rel(X)&quot;&quot;N&quot;, we are tacitly assuming that the social choice function is defined for any possible configuration of preference relations; this is sometimes called the Universal Domain assumption.)

The liberal paradox states that every social choice function satisfies &quot;at most one&quot; of the following properties, never both:
# Pareto optimality (collective efficiency): whenever all individuals of a society strictly prefer an outcome &quot;x&quot; over an outcome &quot;y&quot;, the choice function doesn&#x27;t pick &quot;y&quot;. 
#* Formally, a social choice function &quot;F&quot; is Pareto optimal if whenever &quot;p&quot;∊&quot;Rel(X)&quot;&quot;N&quot; is a configuration of preference relations and there are two outcomes &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; such that &quot;x&quot;⪲&quot;i&quot;&quot;y&quot; for every individual &quot;i&quot;∊&quot;N&quot;, then &quot;y&quot;∉ &quot;F(p)&quot;.
#* Intuitively, Pareto optimality captures an aspect of collective efficiency: the social choice is made so that everyone is collectively as well off as possible, to the extent that every available tradeoff would make someone worse off.
# Minimal liberalism (individual freedom): More than one individual in the society is decisive on a pair of social outcomes. (An individual is decisive on a pair of social outcomes &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; if, whenever they prefer &quot;x&quot; over &quot;y&quot;, the social choice function prefers &quot;x&quot; over &quot;y&quot; regardless of what other members of the society prefer. And similarly whenever they prefer &quot;y&quot; over &quot;x&quot;, the social choice function prefers &quot;y&quot; over &quot;x&quot;.) 
#* Formally, a social choice function &quot;F&quot; respects minimal liberalism if there is more than one individual &quot;i&quot;∊&quot;N&quot; for which there exists a pair of outcomes &quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot;, &quot;y&quot;&quot;i&quot; on which they are decisive—that is, for every configuration of preference relations &quot;p&quot;∊&quot;Rel(X)&quot;&quot;N&quot;, &quot;y&quot;&quot;i&quot;∊ &quot;F(p)&quot; only when &quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot;≼&quot;i&quot;&quot;y&quot;&quot;i&quot; (and similarly, &quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot;∊ &quot;F(p)&quot; only when &quot;y&quot;&quot;i&quot;≼&quot;i&quot;&quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot;).
#* As an example of decisiveness: in the Lewd/Prude case, Lewd was decisive on the pair of outcomes ⟨&quot;Lewd reads&quot;, &quot;No one reads&quot;⟩ and Prude was decisive on the pair of outcomes ⟨&quot;Prude reads&quot;, &quot;No one reads&quot;⟩.
#* Intuitively, minimal liberalism captures an aspect of individual freedom: for some issues, if you prefer x over y (or vice versa), then society respects your preference for x over y even if everyone else is against you. Sen&#x27;s example is your personal preference for sleeping on your back or your side: on at least one innocuous personal area like this, a liberal society ought to prioritize your individual preference even if everyone else in society would prefer you to sleep another way. The formal requirement is that at least two people are decisive in this way, to rule out the possibility of a single person who dictates society&#x27;s preferences.

In other words, the liberal paradox states that for every social choice function &quot;F&quot;, there is a configuration of preference relations &quot;p&quot;∊&quot;Rel(X)&quot;&quot;N&quot; for which &quot;F&quot; violates either Pareto optimality or Minimal liberalism (or both). In the examples of Sen and Gibbard noted above, the social choice function satisfies minimal liberalism at the expense of Pareto optimality.

==Ways out of the paradox==
Because the paradox relies on very few conditions, there are a limited number of ways to escape the paradox. Essentially one must either reject the &quot;universal domain&quot; assumption, the &quot;Pareto principle&quot;, or the &quot;minimal liberalism principle&quot;. Sen himself suggested two ways out, one a rejection of universal domain another a rejection of the Pareto principle.

===Universal domain===
Julian Blau proves that Sen&#x27;s paradox can only arise when individuals have &quot;nosy&quot; preferences—that is when their preference depends not only on their own action but also on others&#x27; actions. In the example of Alice and Bob above, Alice has a preference over how Bob paints his house, and Bob has a preference over Alice&#x27;s house color as well.

Most arguments which demonstrate market efficiency assume that individuals care about only their own consumption and not others&#x27; consumption and therefore do not consider the situations that give rise to Sen&#x27;s paradox. In fact, this shows a strong relationship between Sen&#x27;s paradox and the well known result that markets fail to produce Pareto outcomes in the presence of externalities. Externalities arise when the choices of one party affect another. Classic examples of externalities include pollution or overfishing. Because of their nosy preferences, Alice&#x27;s choice imposes a negative externality on Bob and vice versa.

To prevent the paradox, Sen suggests that &quot;The ultimate guarantee for individual liberty may rest not on rules for social choice but on developing individual values that respect each other&#x27;s personal choices.&quot; Doing so would amount to limiting certain types of nosy preferences, or alternatively restricting the application of the Pareto principle only to those situations where individuals fail to have nosy preferences.

Note that if we consider the case of cardinal preferences—for instance, if Alice and Bob both had to state, within certain bounds, how much happiness they would get for each color of each house separately, and the situation which produced the most happiness were chosen—a minimally-liberal solution does not require that they have no nosiness at all, but just that the sum of all &quot;nosy&quot; preferences about one house&#x27;s color are below some threshold, while the &quot;non-nosy&quot; preferences are all above that threshold. Since there are generally some questions for which this will be true—Sen&#x27;s classic example is an individual&#x27;s choice of whether to sleep on their back or their side—the goal of combining minimal liberalism with Pareto efficiency, while impossible to guarantee in all theoretical cases, may not in practice be impossible to obtain.

===Pareto===
Alternatively, one could remain committed to the universality of the rules for social choice and to individual rights and instead reject the universal application of the Pareto principle. Sen also hints that this should be how one escapes the paradox: 
===Minimal liberalism===
Most commentators on Sen&#x27;s paradox have argued that Sen&#x27;s minimal liberalism condition does not adequately capture the notion of individual rights. Essentially what is excluded from Sen&#x27;s characterization of individual rights is the ability to voluntarily form contracts that lay down one&#x27;s claim to a right.

For example, in the example of Lewd and Prude, although each has a right to refuse to read the book, Prude would voluntarily sign a contract with Lewd promising to read the book on condition that Lewd refrain from doing so. In such a circumstance there was no violation of Prude&#x27;s or Lewd&#x27;s rights because each entered the contract willingly. Similarly, Alice and Bob might sign a contract to each paint their houses their dispreferred color on condition that the other does the same.

In this vein, Gibbard provides a weaker version of the minimal liberalism claim which he argues is consistent with the possibility of contracts and which is also consistent with the Pareto principle given any possible preferences of the individuals.

===Dynamism===
Alternatively, instead of both Lewd and Prude deciding what to do at the same time, they should do it one after the other. If Prude decides not to read, then Lewd will decide to read. This yields the same outcome. However, if Prude decides to read, Lewd won&#x27;t. &quot;Prude reads&quot; is preferred by Prude (and also Lewd) to &quot;Lewd reads&quot;, so he will decide to read (with no obligation, voluntarily) to get this Pareto efficient outcome. Marc Masat hints that this should be another way out of the paradox:

<text>An official system of weights and measures was established in the ancient 
Persian Empire under the Achaemenid dynasty (550-350 BCE). The shekel and mina (&quot;profane&quot; or &quot;sacred&quot;) were units of both weight and volume. A shekel or mina weight was equal to the weight of that volume of water. The talent was a measure of weight used for large amounts of coinage. Some related units were used in Persia in the 19th century, and are still used in contemporary Iran.

==Ancient Persian units==

===Length===
===Volume===
The &quot;shekel&quot; and &quot;mina&quot; (&quot;profane&quot; or &quot;sacred&quot;) were units of both weight and volume. A &quot;shekel&quot; or &quot;mina&quot; weight was equal to the weight of that volume of water. Note that the values given for the &quot;mina&quot; do not match the definitions.

: 1 &quot;shekel&quot; = 8.3 ml (approximately 1 cubic &quot;aiwas&quot;).
: 1 profane &quot;mina&quot; = 50 &quot;shekel&quot; = 500 ml (approximately 27 cubic &quot;aiwas&quot;).
: 1 sacred &quot;mina&quot; = 60 &quot;shekel&quot; = 600 ml (approximately 1 cubic &quot;dva&quot;).
: 1 talent (volume) = 60 profane &quot;mina&quot; = 25 liters (approximately 1 cubic &quot;trayas&quot;).

===Weight===
The talent was a measure of weight used for large amounts of coinage (bullion, bulk coin), rather than an individual coin. Seven Babylonian talents equalled ten Attic talents, according to a list of the revenues of Cyrus the Great (Cyrus II of Persia) recorded in Herodotus.

𐎣𐎼𐏁 (karša) or 𐎣𐎼𐏁𐎹𐎠 (karšayā) is a unit of weight equal to 10 Babylonian &quot;shekels&quot; or Babylonian &quot;mina&quot; weighing approximately .

==Units used in modern Persia (Iran)==

Some related units were used in Persia in the 19th century, and are still used in contemporary Iran.

===Length===
: 1 &quot;arsani&quot; or &quot;ulna&quot; = 52-64 cm.
: 1 &quot;arish&quot; = 
: 1 &quot;chebel&quot; = 40 &quot;arsani&quot; = 21-25 meters or 23-30 yards.
: 1 &quot;farsang&quot; (parasang) = 6.23 km in 19th century Persia.
: 1 &quot;farsang&quot; = 10 kilometers in modern Iran and Turkey.

===Volume===
: 1 &quot;chenica&quot; = 1.32 liters.

<text>Stanisław Antoni Szczuka h. Grabie (1654 – 19 May 1710) was a Polish noble (szlachcic), talented politician and political writer.

Stanisław Antoni was son of a serviceman Stanisław Szczuka h. Grabie and Zofia Szpilewska de domo Neronowiczów. His father was taken hostage by Russians during the Russo-Polish War. Stanisław Antoni had two siblings: brother Gracjan Michał and sister Anna.

He married Konstancja Maria Anna Potocka h. Piława on 6 February 1695, the daughter of starost of Janów Bogusław Potocki h. Piława.

He was a Recorder of the Crown (referendarz koronny) in 1688, deputy of Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in Ducal Prussia in 1690, Deputy Chancellor of Lithuania from 1699.

Szczuka was born to a middle-class szlachta family and educated in Wilno and Kraków. Because of his own ability and hard work he achieved high offices in the Republic. He began his political career in 1675 as secretary of King Jan III Sobieski. In 1696 he became an adviser to August II.

In 1706 he changed sides and became a supporter of Stanisław Leszczyński.

He was a notable political writer and Sejm orator. He also proposed the opening of public schools free of charge.

As Sejm Marshal he led the extraordinary Sejm from 17 November 1688 to 1 April 1689, and the pacification Sejm between 16 and 30 June 1699, in Warsaw.

He died on 19 May 1710 in Warsaw and was buried in Szczuczyn.

To sum up,
Antoni Stanisław Szczuka (1654–1710) was a notable figure in Polish history, known for his integrity and dedication to the king. He served as Crown Referendary and later became Grand Lithuanian Chancellor under August II. His granddaughter, Marianna Potocka, possibly commissioned a portrait of him in Polish attire, although the painting lacks resemblance to him. Despite this, it gained popularity and was engraved multiple times in the 19th century.

<text>The Gary SouthShore RailCats are a professional baseball team based in Gary, Indiana, in the United States. The RailCats are members of the American Association of Professional Baseball, an official Partner League of Major League Baseball. The RailCats started as a member of the Northern League in 2002, operating as a travel team for a season before moving in to U.S. Steel Yard in 2003, where they have played since. In 2011, the team became a member of the modern American Association.

During their time in the Northern League, the RailCats were the only team to ever reach the championship series five years in a row (2005–2009). The RailCats won Northern League championships in 2005 and 2007, and the American Association championship in 2013.

==History==

=== Inception (2001) ===
On January 23, 2001, the Northern League announced that it had awarded a franchise to Northwest Sports Ventures, LLC. In June, a limited liability company by the name of Victory Sports Group was officially registered in Missouri, led by Michael A. Tatoian. The city signed a fifteen-year lease with the team ownership for the future baseball stadium. In September 2001, the team was officially named the Gary SouthShore RailCats, drawing its name from both the city&#x27;s deep history of freight lines and the South Shore Line commuter train (visible over the left field wall at the stadium).

=== Northern League (2002–2010) ===
With stadium construction behind schedule, the RailCats were forced to play their first season entirely on the road. The city of Gary paid a financial penalty for failure to complete the stadium on time, which helped finance their season. The RailCats traveled approximately to play 90 games. Despite this, the club won 35 games, the most ever by a team that played exclusively on the road, and RailCats manager Joe Calfapietra was named the Northern League Manager of the Year.

In 2002, the RailCats signed a ten-year naming rights agreement with United States Steel Corporation for the stadium. Joe Calfapietra resigned as manager citing that he wanted to be closer to home. The RailCats hired former major league All-Star Garry Templeton to manage the team. The RailCats were little more than a pushover, firmly stuck in last place.

Garry Templeton returned as coach for another season leading the Cats in their worst season in 2003. In June, they had a 14-game losing streak which was the longest in Northern League history. They completed the season in last place again securing the record for the most losses for a season in Northern League history. Templeton was not retained for the next season.

Before the 2005 season, the RailCats hired Greg Tagert as manager. Tagert made a number of roster changes, and turned the RailCats from losers to winners almost immediately, ending the first half with a .563 average, the first winning average in team history. The Northern League All-Star Game was held at U.S. Steel Yard. The second half went the same as the first but ended with an upset victory making the worst team in 2004, the 2005 champions. The RailCats beat the Fargo-Moorhead RedHawks to win the title.

Tagert returned as manager in 2006. The Cats were first in their division, second overall for the season. They returned to the championship series to face the RedHawks again. This time losing the title.

Tagert returned for the 2007 season. He proved that he could make the RailCats a legacy team. The RailCats appeared unstoppable all season. Winning first place both halves. The RailCats made it to the championship series against the Calgary Vipers and won their second league title.

Prior to the 2008 season, the Cats signed Tagert to an extended contract to keep him at least until the completion of the 2010 season. Lawyer Patrick A. Salvi and his wife, Lindy, purchased the RailCats. The league contracted to six teams. Due to the size, the league opted to have a single-division full season. Tagert again led the Cats in a winning season, ending in second place. They lost the championship series to the fourth-place Kansas City T-Bones, who beat the first place RedHawks in the playoffs to make it to the series.

The Cats ended the 2009 season in first place, yet again, and made it to the championship season for the fifth-straight season, but lost to the RedHawks.

The 2010 Cats finished in fourth place in the Northern League, their worst place finish in five years. For the first time since 2004, the RailCats did not reach the championship series, being swept by the RedHawks in the league semifinals.

=== American Association (2011–present) ===
On October 13, 2010, the RailCats left the Northern League, along with the RedHawks, T-Bones, and the Winnipeg Goldeyes to join the American Association for the 2011 season.

In 2020, the RailCats were not selected as one of six teams to participate in a condensed American Association season as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. They went on hiatus for the 2020 season, and returned to play in 2021.

After finishing in last place in the North Division with a 39–61 record in 2021, Greg Tagert left the organization after 17 years to join the San Francisco Giants organization.

<doc id="1332489" wikidata="Q757401" url="?curid=1332489" title="Atlixco">
<text>Atlixco () is a city in the Mexican state of Puebla. It is a regional industrial and commercial center but economically it is much better known for its production of ornamental plants and cut flowers. The city was founded early in the colonial period, originally under the jurisdiction of Huejotzingo, but eventually separated to become an independent municipality. The municipality has a number of notable cultural events, the most important of which is the &quot;El Huey Atlixcayotl&quot;, a modern adaptation of an old indigenous celebration. This event brings anywhere from 800 to 1,500 participants from all over the state of Puebla to create music, dance, and other cultural and artistic performances. Atlixco joined the UNESCO Global Network of Learning Cities in 2018.

==History==

The name &quot;Atlixco&quot; comes from a Nahuatl phrase which can be interpreted as either &quot;water in the valley&quot; or &quot;water on the ground&quot;. Its main economic activity has earned the city the suffix of &quot;de las flores&quot; (&quot;of the flowers&quot;). The city of Atlixco received its coat of arms from King Philip II in 1579, which now represents the entire municipality.

=== Pre-Hispanic period ===
In the pre-Hispanic period, it was part of Cuauhquecollán, today Huaquechula. The first known inhabitants of this area were the Teochichimecas around 1100 CE, before becoming a Xicalanca settlement. This area was eventually conquered by Tenochtitlan. Its location made it a battleground among several indigenous peoples, with the populations of Calpan, Huejotzingo and Cholula claiming possession. After the Conquest it was named Acapetlahuacan (place of reeds) until its current name.

=== Colonial period ===
During the colonial period, the area was an important producer of grain, especially wheat, giving rise to the first wheat mill in the state. The city proper was founded in 1579 as Villas de Carrión by Pedro de Castillo, Cristóbal Ruiz de Cabrera and Alonso Díaz de Carrión.

=== Province of Carrión in the Valley of Atlixco ===
Originally it and the surrounding area was under the jurisdiction of Huejotzingo, but in 1632, it became a local independent seat of government. In 1693, Don Diego Fernández de Medrano y Zapata, a native of Sojuela and resident of Logroño, owner of the Divisa Regajal, knight of the Order of Calatrava, became the Governor of the Province of Carrión, valley of Atlixco in Puebla, with his seat in the city of Atlixco.

=== Duchy of Atlixco ===
In 1706 the area became under the direct control of the Spanish Crown, with Philip V granting José Sarmiento Valladares Arines de Romay the royal title of Duke and Lord of Atlixco.

=== Notable visits ===
In 1840 the Marquesa Calderón de la Barca visited the community and noted that it was filled with beautiful churches, monasteries and other buildings.

=== City of Atlixco ===
The town was given the official status of city by Nicolás Bravo in 1843. In 1847, the municipal government took over administration of the San Juan de Dios Hospital. In 1862, troops led by General Tomás O´Horan defeated French sympathizers under Leonardo Márquez, impeding the advance of French troops. This was an important precursor to the Battle of Puebla.

=== Economy ===
Since then the area&#x27;s economy has changed to the production of flowers and ornamental plants along with some commerce and industry. There have also been efforts to make the area attractive for tourists, with various festivals and other events established since the late 20th century.

In 2008, the municipality set a world record for the largest chile en nogada, measuring 2.6 meters by 90cm.
==The city==
The city of Atlixco is in the west of the state of Puebla at an elevation of 1,881 meters above sea level, 25 km from the state capital of Puebla. The main economic activities of the city are agriculture and basic commerce. It lies at the foot of the Cerro de San Miguel mountain, which is the main geographical and cultural landmark, marked by a small hermitage at the top dedicated to the Archangel Michael. According to local lore, a demon was entrapped in the well there, after causing problems in the community. There are also lookout points that provide panoramic views of the city.

The city centers on a main square which is Moorish in style, surrounded by restaurants and other places selling local specialties and ice cream. Notable location on or near the square include the Casa de la Audencia, with its portal supported by Tuscan columns, the Portal Hidalgo, the old Marqués de Santa Martha House, the Botica Poblana pharmacy (founded in 1877 but taken down around 2005), the Rascon Building from the late 19th century, CADAC (an arts and trades school) and the Isaac Ochotorena House from the 18th century. Another important area of the city is Colonia Cabrera, noted for its abundance of greenhouse production of flowers and ornamental plants.

The most important churches in the city date from the 18th century, noted for their intricate &quot;folk Baroque&quot; facades created from stucco by indigenous craftsmen. The La Merced Temple is all that remains of a Mercedarian monastery. Most of the church, including a decorative side door is from the 17th century, but the façade is from the 18th century. The main portal is decorated with paired columns, spiraling vines in high relief and ornamental sculptures in niches on both the upper and lower levels. The doorway itself is a lobed Moorish arch. The center of this decoration is a niche with an image of the Virgin of Mercy, who shelters Mercedarian founder Pedro Nolasco and other saints with her cloak. The interior was redone in the 19th century, but maintains a large colonial era portrait of Our Lady of Mercy by José Joaquín Magón as well as an 18th-century inlaid wood pulpit. This church has a collection of paintings from the colonial period. This collection is under the care of the Adopt a Work of Art campaign working to restore many of the canvases to their original state.

The Third Order Chapel is at the foot of the hill where the former Franciscan monastery is located and also has portal work of stucco. The west facade has a classic altarpiece design in folk Baroque with cherubs and angels throughout. It contains pairs Solomonic columns with vines and fruits with two tiers of ornamental niches with saints and apostles. Above the arched doorway is a cornucopia and above this is a choir window covered by a shell arch. On either side of the window there are columns and geometric relief patterns as well as Moorish medallions. Inside there is a notable 18th-century gold leaf altarpiece called the Retablo de Reyes.

Although the parish church called Natividad itself has a plain facade, it has an ornate addition called the Santuario del Santísimo (Most Holy Sanctuary), built in the late 1700s on the north side with a polychrome stucco facade and painted cupola. The former main portal has decorative spiral columns, which are topped by &quot;woven&quot; columns and bands of filigree and foliated relief around a choir window shaped like a shell. Above the facade, there is an escutcheon with a relief of the Holy Sacrament and a two-headed Habsburg eagle. On the sides of this are rampant lions and angels in while on an ocher background. The interior was redone in Neo Classical in the 19th century, with one Baroque altarpiece surviving, attributed to Luis Juárez.

Other important churches include the San Agustin Church, built between 1589 and 1698,also with Baroque stucco work, the La Soledad Chapel and the chapels of Santa Clara and El Carmen. The San Felix Papa Church has a façade which is identical to a large sized painting possibly from the 18th century, which is found in the sacristy of the Natividad Parish Church on the main plaza. It contains works from the 17th century, including a collection of apostles dressed as popes.

There were a number of monasteries in the community during the colonial period, all now either destroyed or no longer active. The most notable of these is the former Franciscan monastery built on a hill in fortress fashion, walking distance from the main square. The atrium offers panoramic views of the city and the church is popular for weddings. Inside there is a Baroque main altar. In the 16th century, the Augustinians built a monastery under Melchor de Vargas, not for evangelization but rather to represent their order and provide services to the local criollo population. The church has two facades, with the main one on the north side. The portal of the side has Baroque decoration in stucco, as does the bell tower. Another was a convent called Las Clarisas founded in 1617.

The San Juan de Dios Municipal Hospital was founded is one of the few colonial-era hospitals still running. The building is marked by an original statue of Saint Adrian fighting a lion. It is also noted for a significant painting collection, which is open to the public. Next to the hospital is a church dedicated to the Archangel Raphael.

The municipal palace is facing the main square and distinguished by a facade decorated in Talavera tile. Originally the city library, its inner walls contain a series of murals related to the history and culture of the municipality and the country, including its founding, history of education in Mexico, and heroes of wars of Independence and Reforma.

The municipal market is one block from the main square, which also has stalls specializing in local foods. Tianguis day in the city is Saturday, when streets fill with stalls selling fruits, vegetables, flowers, bread and many other staples. It is one of the largest and oldest tianguis in the state.

There is one museum called Museo Obrero, located inside the Centro Vacacional IMSS Metepec, along with a cultural center located in a former textile factory.

==The municipality==
The city of Atlixco is the local government for a number of other nearby communities, which form a municipality that covers an area of 229.22 km2. The municipal government consists of a president, a syndic, and twelve representatives for the various communities. Outside the seat, the main communities are San Pedro Benito Juárez, Santo Domingo Atoyatempan, San Jerónimo Coyula, La Trinidad Tepango, Axocapan, San Miguel Ayala, San Jerónimo Caleras, San Diego Acapulco, Santa Lucia Cosamaloapan and Metepec. It borders the municipalities of Tianguismanalco, &quot;Santa Isabel Cholula (municipality)&quot;, Ocoyucan, Atzitzihuacán, Huaquechula, Tepeojuma, &quot;San Diego la Meza Tochimiltzingo (municipality)&quot;, Puebla and Tochimilco.

The main economic activities for the municipality are agriculture and livestock. The Centro Vacacional Metepec is seven km northwest of the city, in a former textile factory. Today it is one of the state&#x27;s most important water parks.

==Geography==

The territory of the municipality is divided between the Valley of Puebla and the Atlixco Valley, both of which extend from the Sierra Nevada. The altitude varies from a low of 1,700 meters above sea level in the south to 2,500 in the northwest at the foot of the Iztaccihuatl Volcano, with an overall average altitude of 1840. The center of the territory is a valley floor that extends from north to south, with isolated mountains such as Zoapiltepec and Texistle in the southeast. Other isolated peaks include the Pochote, Tecuitlacuelo, Loma La Calera and El Charro.

The municipality is located in the basin of the Nexapa River, a tributary of the Atoyac. Various streams run through the territory, which have their source at the Iztaccihuatl Volcano; however, most depending on snow melt from the volcano. The Nexcapa is one of the few that run year-round and splits the Atlixco Valley in half. Other larger ones include the Cuescomante, which passes by the seat, the Molino and the Palomas. The highest elevations at the foot of the volcanos are marked by a large number of ravines. The San Pedro Atlixco Waterfall is in this area, surrounded by pines and cedars. This area has fishing, boating, camping and more.
===Climate===
The municipality is in the transition zone between the more temperate climates of the north of the state and the hotter climates of the south. The northwest and isolated peaks have a temperate and semi humid climate as it has the highest altitude. The center and south have a warm and semi-humid climate.

===Flora===
Most of the valley floor area is dedicated to irrigated farming, with rainy season farming dominant in the higher elevations. The latter has contributed to extensive deforestation, cutting down pines and cedars. The only remaining wild vegetation is in small areas in the north and northeast, where these trees still exist. In small areas in the southeast, there is pastureland and scrub brush.

==Culture==
The most important annual event in the municipality is known as El Huey Atlixcayotl, a Nahuatl phrase which roughly translates to &quot;the great Atlixco tradition&quot;. This event, started in 1965, is a reinvention of an old indigenous celebration that tradition says in the pre Hispanic period honored the god Quetzalcoatl, giving thanks for the harvest. On the last Saturday of September, the event begins with the selection of the festival queen, called the Xochicihuatl (lit. flower woman) and a dance called Las Canastas, when women dance with baskets of fireworks on their heads. The main events are on the following day, Sunday, when a parade of between 800 and 1,500 participants from Puebla&#x27;s eleven regions leaves the town square to climb Cerro de San Miguel, which has a stage area with stands. The rest of the day is filled with performances by charros, bands, mojigangas, voladores and more. These activities are in honor of the Archangel Michael, who has a small church on the mountain. In 1996 the event was named as part of the Cultural Heritage of Puebla.

The Festival de la Ilusión (Festival of Joy) was started in the 1990s by two teenagers to reinforce the tradition of Three Kings&#x27; Day in Mexico, January 6. At that time, many fathers and other family members went to the United States to work, leading to foreign influences such as Santa Claus. To give January 6 precedence, the teens took a collection from local businesses to buy thousands of balloons and envelopes so that children could have a mass launch, sending their requests for toys. The fourth of January is still dedicated to this launch, but two days have been added. On January 5, a 5 km parade with floats in honor of the Three Kings is held, and on January 6 the local convention center hosts musical groups, clowns and other forms of entertainment for the city.

The Festival de la Iluminación (Lights Festival) or Villa Iluminada (Lighted Village) begins on November 20 with large lighted figures that adorn the city&#x27;s streets. This event was begun in 2010, with the lights placed along a corridor of a km and half. The event draws over 500,000 visitors to the city during the 46 days it is set up from the end of November to the beginning of January. In addition to the lights the event also features amusement rides, and an exhibition of sky lanterns.

Some of the annual events are related to Atlixco&#x27;s economy. The Festival de la Flor (Flower Festival) celebrates the municipality&#x27;s main economic activity of growing flowers. Starting in the second week of March, giant &quot;carpets&quot; are created by arranging flowers on the street. During the last two weeks of the month, large flower sculptures are created to attract visitors, along with musical events and other attractions. The Feria de la Nochebuena (Poinsettia Fair) begins on November 25 and runs through the Christmas season to promote the plants of this type grown in the municipality. The Feria de la Noche Buena began in 2001 and is timed for the start of the Christmas season. The Feria de la Cecina (Cecina Fair) promotes the local version of this meat, in August with artistic and cultural events. The last two weeks of October are dedicated to the regional fair.

La Noche de las Estrellas (Night of the Stars) occurs on the last Saturday of February, when about 5,000 people come together on the Cerro de San Miguel mountain to observe the night sky, through the telescopes of the observatory there. The event promotes the organizations courses and workshops as well as a program to provide telescopes to families.

For Holy Week, the streets of the Nexatengo community are adorned with flowers, pine branches and sawdust carpets for a procession of Jesus in which 8,000 people participate in an eight km procession.

The Desfile de Calaveras (Skull Parade) takes place on November 2, Day of the Dead.

It is during traditional festivals that local food specialties and dress most often appear. Traditional dishes include cecina, a local variety of consome called &quot;atlixquense&quot;, chiles en nogada, barbacoa, mole poblano, mole de panza, mole de olla, mole verde, pozole blanco, tostadas, enchiladas, pambazos, tortas, cemitas, molotes and tlacoyos.

The most traditional dress is now seen only on certain occasions and dances. For women, this is the style of the China Poblana, or alternatively a long full flowered skirt with white blouse and rebozo. For men this consists of a shirt and pants made of undyed cotton, huaraches and a hat made of palm fronds.

==Economy==
The city of Atlixco is a regional commercial, manufacturing and industrial center with textile mills, distilleries and bottling plants. Traditional handcrafts also are made here and in the rest of the municipality including ceramic utensils, embroidered shirts and blouses and candles.

However, the municipality is best known for its cultivation of ornamental plants, flowers and fruit trees. Flowers include roses, geraniums, chrysanthemums, and Cornish mallow (Lavatera cretica). All of its potted plant production is sold in Mexico, with eighty percent of the cut flowers sent abroad, mostly to the United States.

The municipality ranks first in the production of roses and gladiolas and is one of the largest producers of poinsettias, helping to make the state of Puebla fourth in Mexico in its production. Fifty two producers on twenty five hectares typically produce 1.5 million poinsettials per year. Sales from poinsettias alone reach at least 68 million pesos for the municipality and support 800 families. Most of the plants are shipped to other Mexican states such as Veracruz, Oaxaca, Chiapas, Yucatán and Campeche. The main flowers grown and sold for Day of the Dead include chrysanthemums, gladiolas and baby&#x27;s breath.

In addition, other crops such as wheat, corn, beans and fruits, much of which are processed locally and distributed from the city.

The Fuerte avocado, second largest commercial avocado cultivar after Hass, was first identified in Atlixco in the early 20th century.

<doc id="1332494" wikidata="Q15167" url="?curid=1332494" title="Admiralty station (MTR)">
<text>Admiralty () is a station of the MTR rapid transit system in Admiralty, Hong Kong.

The station&#x27;s livery is blue and white. Served by the largest number of lines of any MTR station at four: the , the , the , and the , Admiralty is a major interchange station within the MTR network.

The station and surrounding area are named after HMS &quot;Tamar&quot;, once the headquarters of the Royal Navy in Hong Kong. It was built on the former site of the naval dockyards, which were built in 1878 and demolished in the 1970s. 

Between 2011 and 2016, the station underwent major expansion to accommodate two new sets of platforms underneath the original structure to serve two more MTR lines, the and the (part of the Sha Tin to Central Link project). The opened in 2016, while the East Rail line platforms opened on 15 May 2022. Accommodating over 100,000 passengers per peak hour, it has since become the busiest station in the MTR network.

==History==

===Development and construction===
The government gave the Mass Transit Railway Corporation first refusal on the site, which was sold to it in 1976 for around HK$200 million for cash and equity consideration.

The Admiralty Centre, United Centre and Queensway Plaza commercial buildings formed part of the development, and sit directly above the station.

On 12 February 1980, the segment of the Kwun Tong line between and was opened. At the time, Admiralty and Central stations were the only two MTR stations on Hong Kong Island. The platforms began serving the on 17 May 1982.

Admiralty was designed to be a transfer station with the then-planned . On 31 May 1985, the first phase of the Island line (between Admiralty and ) opened, with Admiralty the temporary western terminus of the Island line. To facilitate cross-platform interchange, the Tsuen Wan- and Chai Wan-bound platforms were located on a very wide island platform on the lower level, while the Central-bound and termination platforms shared another very wide island platform on the upper level. When the second part of the Island line (Admiralty to ) opened in 1986, the termination platform became the Sheung Wan-bound platform, while the other platforms remained unchanged. In 2014, the Sheung Wan-bound platform became the Kennedy Town-bound platform.

===2004 arson attack===
At 9:14 a.m. on 5 January 2004, 14 passengers suffered minor injuries when a 55-year-old man suffering from delusional disorder ignited two gas cylinders full of paint thinner in the first train car of a Central-bound train from . The driver decided to complete the journey and passengers were evacuated from the train in Admiralty.

===Station expansion and new lines===
Admiralty station was expanded to serve two additional lines - the on level L6 and the on level L5. 

The South Island line platforms opened on 28 December 2016, after a public open day on 24th of that month, giving residents in the Southern District quicker access to Hong Kong Island&#x27;s central business district. The opening date was delayed from 2015 due to technical problems in the deep tunnels for the new platforms. During the Central Station crash, Admiralty was the southern terminus of the Tsuen Wan line. The East Rail line began servicing Admiralty on 15 May 2022, allowing commuters from the northeast New Territories to travel directly to Admiralty.

A new single level underground transfer lobby with natural light was built to the east of the original concourse, allowing passengers to transfer to the new lines. The atrium was also expanded. The station extension, located under Harcourt Garden, incorporates 34 escalators and five lifts to integrate with the existing station. The East Rail line takes up one level under the transfer lobby, with the South Island line being directly below it. Exits E1 and E2 were rebuilt as one exit to accommodate the glass roof of the interchange concourse and has since opened. While the East Rail line tracks will have sidings for terminating trains south of the station, the South Island line tracks end at bumper blocks north of the station with no overrun track.
The narrowest part of the existing platforms on L3 was widened to provide better access to the first and second cars of the Tsuen Wan line trains, as well as last two cars of Island line trains. Island line passengers travelling towards Tsuen Wan now have easier access to these cars. The expansion brought new toilets in the paid area, a lift between the concourse and, ground level, and artwork in the station.

The expansion works saw the station size being expanded significantly. The number of platforms doubled from 4 to 8, the number of floors increased from 3 to 8, and the number of escalators increased from 8 to 42.

==Station layout==
Today, Admiralty station has a total of six underground floors; the uppermost (L1) floor has the fare control, lobby, shops, Customer Service Centre and other major facilities.

On floor L2, passengers can access Platforms 4 (Tsuen Wan line to Central) and 3 (Island line to Chai Wan). One floor down, on level L3, are Platforms 2 (Island line to ) and 1 (Tsuen Wan line to Tsuen Wan). There are very wide passageways between the two platforms on each of floors L2 and L3; they are also curved platforms with trains going in opposite directions. The platforms are in the shape of a trapezium. 

Because all the platforms are curved, there are large stickers in front of the platform screen doors with &quot;Mind the gap&quot; text, which can only be found in this station. Passengers travelling from Eastern District and Wan Chai District can walk across to platform 1 to board the Tsuen Wan line trains bound for Kowloon, Kwai Chung and Tsuen Wan. Passengers travelling from Kowloon, Kwai Chung and Tsuen Wan can walk across and board the Island line trains bound for Chai Wan from platform 3.

In the extension part built to the east of the original Tsuen Wan / Island line station box, a tall atrium extends 5 floors below ground. Inside the atrium, there are five escalators from floor L2 (platforms 3 and 4), and another five from L3 (platforms 1 and 2), connecting to the circulation mezzanine on floor L5 under a semi-circular skylight that brings natural light in from Rodney Street. Through floor L5—the top level of a span cavern—passengers could access the East Rail line platforms sited in adjoining tunnels on the same level, or reach the South Island line platforms below, which are located below ground.

===Usage and overcrowding===
As the primary interchange point between the , the , the , and the , Admiralty is heavily congested during rush hours. 

Admiralty and are the only cross-platform interchange stations on Hong Kong Island between lines serving it and Kowloon in the MTR system. It is also the only interchange station for the South Island line. Despite trains departing at capacity (every 2.1 minutes), commuters frequently have to board the second or even the third train when changing lines. The situation deteriorated following fare cuts following the MTR–KCR merger.

Temporary measures are undertaken during peak hours, including the deployment of additional station assistants, adjustment of escalator directions and making pacifying announcements by local celebrities. During evening peak hours, some Tsuen Wan line trains are taken out of service at Central, and placed back into service at Admiralty, in order to relieve the demand at Admiralty.
The existing signalling system of Tsuen Wan line was planned to be upgraded by Thales Transport &amp; Security in 2018 for long-term use. 

In addition, the 2022 extension of the (from to Admiralty) has helped to divert some cross-harbour demand from the Tsuen Wan line, thereby reducing congestion. New &quot;Cross-Harbour Easy&quot; panels have been installed on the concourse and Island line platform levels to help harbour-crossing passengers make an informed choice between the two lines. These PIDS panels display a countdown to their next two trains, as well as simulations of real-time crowdedness on their respective platforms. 

===Artworks===
The station expansion project has brought three artworks to the station. The first is &quot;Sense of Green&quot; by Tony Ip, which is a new bamboo-covered landscaped deck over Harcourt Garden. The second, &quot;Urban Soundscape&quot; by Otto Li, is located along either side of the escalator shaft between the new and current stations. It depicts passengers&#x27; journeys through Admiralty. Anchoring the atrium is the suspended aluminium sculpture &quot;Mapping Our Journey&quot; by American artist Talley Fisher, representing the four MTR lines converging at the station as well as the intersection of individuality and community.

==Entrances and exits==
Admiralty is part of the central business district of Hong Kong Island. There are many office buildings around the station. A major shopping centre, Pacific Place, is accessed through a pedestrian walkway from Exit F.

<doc id="1332497" wikidata="Q312428" url="?curid=1332497" title="Rage (German band)">
<text>Rage is a German heavy metal band formed in 1984 by Peter &quot;Peavy&quot; Wagner. They were part of the German heavy/speed/power metal scene that emerged in the early to mid-1980s and have been referred to as one of the country&#x27;s so-called &quot;big four&quot; of power metal, alongside Grave Digger, Helloween, and Running Wild.

Rage was formed in 1984 under the name Avenger. After releasing their debut album &quot;Prayers of Steel&quot; and the &quot;Depraved to Black&quot; EP in 1985, the band changed their name to Rage due to the existence of another band in England with the same name. Over the years, 17 musicians have been part of Rage, with the most successful lineup emerging during the period now known as the Refuge years, featuring Manni Schmidt and Chris Efthimiadis. The second notable lineup included Mike Terrana and Victor Smolski.

Throughout their career, Rage has established themselves as a notably successful band and pioneers of the power metal scene, incorporating elements of progressive metal and classical music into their music. In 1996, Rage became one of the first metal bands to write and record an album featuring a full symphonic orchestra: &quot;Lingua Mortis&quot;.

As of 2024, Rage has released 27 albums (counting the &quot;Avenger&quot; and &quot;LMO&quot; releases) over their 40-year career (in total, more than 50 releases when including DVDs, EPs, Japan editions, and VHS). They have achieved international success, selling over five million records and securing more than 40 entries on music charts.

== History == 
=== From Avenger to Rage (1984–1986) === 
Rage began in 1984 in Herne, when Peavy Wagner (bass and vocals), along with drummer Jörg Michael and guitarist Jochen Schroeder, first came together under the name &quot;Avenger.&quot; Following the release of their debut album, &quot;Prayers of Steel&quot;, recorded in 1984 and released by Wishbone Records, along with an EP titled &quot;Depraved to Black&quot; in August 1985, Avenger changed their name to Rage. They subsequently secured a record deal with Noise, releasing their first official LP, &quot;Reign of Fear&quot;, on 12 May 1986.

=== Noise Years (1986–1994) === 
On 11 May 1987, they released the album Execution Guaranteed under the label Noise. That same year, they debuted their first official music video, &quot;Down by Law,&quot; which introduced the new lineup featuring Manni Schmidt and Chris Efthimiadis. 

With this new lineup, the album &quot;Perfect Man&quot; was released in 1988, featuring the single &quot;Don&#x27;t Fear the Winter,&quot; which became a hit within the scene. The band began touring with notable acts such as Running Wild, U.D.O., Motörhead, and Saxon. In 1989, Rage released the album &quot;Secrets in a Weird World&quot;, which made an impact on the charts with the single &quot;Invisible Horizons,&quot; marking another highlight in the band’s career. 

The early 1990s saw their 1992 album &quot;Trapped!&quot; mark their international breakthrough, charting worldwide and leading to the band&#x27;s first major tour in Japan. Their success continued in 1993 with the release of &quot;The Missing Link&quot;. This album became one of the most successful and influential releases of that era. 

In early 1994, guitarist Manni Schmidt left the band, prompting Peavy Wagner to form a new lineup with Sven Fischer and Chris Efthimiadis&#x27;s brother, Spiros.

=== Two Guitars Years (1994–1999) === 
Following the change in their lineup, Rage recorded their ten-year anniversary album, &quot;10 Years in Rage&quot;, in 1994. This was the last album released by Noise Records, but it suffered from inadequate media promotion. That same year, Rage signed with Gun Records and released the breakthrough album &quot;Black in Mind&quot;, which was followed by a world tour and several chart entries worldwide. Especially in Japan and Europe, this album elevated the band to a much higher level and is still regarded as a classic of the genre. Several other bands also left Gun Records that year. 

The album &quot;Lingua Mortis&quot;, recorded in 1996, was the first album by a metal act to collaborate with a classical symphonic orchestra. This material was performed live for the first time in late summer 1996 in Kufstein, Austria. Following this, Rage and the orchestra embarked on a Christmas tour and played at several European festivals. 

Still in 1996, they released one of the most successful albums of their career, &quot;End of All Days&quot;, with the track &quot;Higher than the Sky&quot; becoming a staple of their live performances. 

In March 1998, Rage released their thirteenth album, &quot;XIII&quot;, which featured the Lingua Mortis Orchestra and achieved considerable success on the charts. &quot;XIII&quot; was ranked number 272 in Rock Hard magazine&#x27;s book &quot;The 500 Greatest Rock &amp; Metal Albums of All Time&quot;. 

After the release of &quot;XIII&quot;, Rage continued their collaboration with the Lingua Mortis Orchestra for their next album, &quot;Ghosts&quot;. Shortly before the album&#x27;s release, the band underwent a significant lineup change, with Peavy Wagner reforming Rage while former members went on to form the pop band Sub7even.

=== The Millennium Years (1999–2015) === 
Peavy recruited new members Victor Smolski on guitar and Mike Terrana on drums. The trio first performed at Wacken Open Air in August 1999 and released their album &quot;Welcome to the Other Side&quot; in 2001. In the following two years, they released the albums &quot;Unity&quot; and &quot;Soundchaser&quot;, both of which received positive responses from critics. Rage toured with Primal Fear in 2002 and Helloween in 2003. The band&#x27;s 20th anniversary in 2004 was celebrated with the &quot;From the Cradle to the Stage&quot; tour, during which the show in Bochum was recorded and released under the same name on CD and DVD in 2005. 

In 2006, Rage again featured a symphonic orchestra, this time from Minsk, Belarus, named the &quot;Lingua Mortis Orchestra,&quot; which performed on their subsequent album &quot;Speak of the Dead&quot;. This was the last album to feature Mike Terrana on drums. On 1 January 2007, it was announced that the new drummer would be André Hilgers, formerly of Axxis. He had already contributed to the 20th anniversary album &quot;Into the Light&quot;, which was composed, produced, and primarily played by Victor, with lyrics written by Peavy. 

In 2007, the band toured Europe with the orchestra, and their performance at Wacken Open Air in August, in front of 80,000 fans, was recorded for a DVD to be included as a bonus with their next album. &quot;Carved in Stone&quot; was released on 22 February 2008. In 2009, Rage performed at the Bundesvision Song Contest on 13 February, hosted by Stefan Raab (&quot;TV total&quot;), where they secured third place. Their participating song, &quot;Gib dich nie auf&quot; (Never Give Up), was released on an EP. The year also marked a 25th anniversary tour, and their performance at Wacken, featuring guest musicians like Hansi Kürsch, was released as a bonus DVD with the 2011 album &quot;Strings to a Web&quot;. 

Rage entered the studio in October 2011 to begin recording their 21st album, aptly titled &quot;21&quot;, scheduled for release in early 2012. Two years later, in celebration of the band&#x27;s 30th anniversary, they released &quot;The Soundchaser Archives&quot;, featuring rare and demo songs from the band&#x27;s 30-year history. An anniversary tour took place throughout the year and concluded in January 2015 with their final show in Sofia. 

On 4 February 2015, Peavy Wagner announced that there would be no further collaboration with Victor Smolski and André Hilgers. 

Meanwhile, Peavy reestablished contact with former band members Manni Schmidt and Christos Efthimiadis and played a secret concert in Peavy&#x27;s hometown of Herne under the pseudonym Tres Hombres. Following this successful performance, they decided to reunite as Refuge and confirmed several festival dates for 2015.

=== Present Years (2015–Present) === 
The new line-up was announced on 18 June 2015, featuring guitarist Marcos Rodriguez (from the band Soundchaser) and drummer Vassilios &quot;Lucky&quot; Maniatopoulos, who is also the vocalist and percussionist of the band Tri State Corner, as well as a former drum technician and apprentice of Chris Efthimiadis. Following the release of the EP &quot;My Way&quot; in January 2016, their album &quot;The Devil Strikes Again&quot; was released on 10 June 2016. A tour was scheduled for the end of the year, followed by the release of another album, &quot;Seasons of the Black&quot;, on 28 July 2017. The next tour took place in January 2018, featuring Firewind as a special guest. 

The 25th studio album, &quot;Wings of Rage&quot;, was announced in April 2019 and released in January 2020. On 6 May 2020, Marcos Rodriguez left the band due to personal reasons and was replaced by Stefan Weber (ex-Axxis) and Jean Bormann (Angelinc). 

Rage&#x27;s 26th studio album, &quot;Resurrection Day&quot;, was released on 17 September 2021. On 24 July 2023, it was announced that Weber would go on indefinite hiatus due to personal issues, and the band would continue as a trio. 

Rage&#x27;s 27th studio album, &quot;Afterlifelines&quot;, is set to be released on 29 March 2024. This album marks the first double album in their history and the first collection of new symphonic songs since the departure of Smolski.

== Side projects ==
=== Lingua Mortis Orchestra ===
The Lingua Mortis Orchestra (LMO) is the name associated with the orchestras that have performed with Rage since 1996, both in studio recordings and on stage. Rage&#x27;s tenth studio album, &quot;Lingua Mortis&quot;, was the first classical album by a metal band and a collaboration with the Prague Symphony Orchestra. Subsequently, Rage worked with orchestras on some of the band&#x27;s most renowned albums, including &quot;XIII&quot; and &quot;Ghosts&quot;. In 2006, an orchestra from Minsk, Belarus, also named Lingua Mortis Orchestra, collaborated with Rage on the album &quot;Speak of the Dead&quot;. The following year, Rage performed several shows with the Lingua Mortis Orchestra, and their performance at Wacken Open Air was recorded as a bonus DVD for their next album, &quot;Carved in Stone&quot;.

In 2011, the project was formalized by Rage musicians Peavy Wagner (vocals and bass), Victor Smolski (guitar and keyboard), and André Hilgers (drums) as a continuation of the 1996 album &quot;Lingua Mortis&quot;, which was a pioneering work in its own right. In 2013, they recorded the debut album, titled &quot;LMO&quot;, in collaboration with two orchestras from Spain and Belarus. The album features additional vocals by former Metalium frontman Henning Basse, Jeannette Marchewka, and Dana Harnge.

The first symphonic performances under the band&#x27;s name took place at the 70000 Tons of Metal festival, followed by several summer festivals, including Wacken and—prior to the album&#x27;s release—Masters of Rock. The latter performance was also recorded and included as a bonus DVD in &quot;The Soundchaser Archives.&quot;

At this point, the designation of Lingua Mortis Orchestra as a &quot;side project&quot; was dismissed by Peavy, and it became integrated into the band, mirroring its original formation in 1996. In 2019, Rage toured with the Lingua Mortis Orchestra to perform at various festivals, including a complete rendition of the &quot;XIII&quot; album. The 2024 release &quot;Afterlifelines&quot; also features symphonic tracks, and the band has scheduled several performances with an orchestra as part of their 40th anniversary celebrations.

=== Refuge ===
In 2014, Peavy Wagner reunited with Manni Schmidt and Chris Efthimiadis, leading to the decision to perform a secret show in their hometown of Herne under the name &quot;Tres Hombres.&quot; This event sparked the idea for the creation of Refuge, featuring the same Rage line-up from 1988 to 1993. The name Refuge was derived from one of Rage&#x27;s most recognized songs, &quot;Refuge,&quot; from the album &quot;The Missing Link&quot;, which was also recorded by this line-up. In an interview, Peavy noted that Refuge is not a professional band, as its members maintain regular jobs and families; thus, Refuge serves more as an &quot;extended hobby&quot; for performing at special events and festivals. He also stated that Refuge would coexist alongside Rage and the new line-up featuring Marcos and Vassilios.

In 2015, Refuge performed at numerous festivals across Europe, including the Rock Hard Festival, which was broadcast live and later recorded as the live album &quot;Live at Rock Hard Festival&quot; for the box set &quot;The Refuge Years&quot;.

The band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Solitary Men&quot;, was released on 8 June 2018.

<text>USS &quot;Plymouth&quot; (PG-57), a patrol gunboat, was the fourth ship of the United States Navy to be named for Plymouth, Massachusetts, a town founded by the Pilgrims in 1620 on Plymouth Bay, about 35 miles southeast of Boston.

==Construction==
&quot;Plymouth&quot;″s keel was laid down in 1931, by the Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft in Kiel, Germany, as &quot;Alva&quot;. She was originally built as a yacht for William Kissam Vanderbilt II and was named &quot;Alva&quot;, after his mother, Alva Vanderbilt Belmont.

She was given to the United States Navy on 4 November 1941, by her owner and was placed in reduced commission at Jacksonville, Florida, on 29 December 1941.

==Service history==

===Inshore Patrol Squadron, 1942–1943===
She departed Jacksonville on 31 December for the Navy Yard, Washington, DC, arriving there on 4 January 1942. She sailed on 21 January and the next day entered the Norfolk Navy Yard. On 23 January, she was placed in commission in ordinary for conversion to a patrol gunboat. She was placed in full commission 20 April and assigned to Inshore Patrol Squadron, 5th Naval District, based at Norfolk, Virginia. On 8 May she departed Norfolk, forming part of the escort for a convoy en route to Key West, Florida. She was on continuous escort duty between New York, Norfolk, and Key West until 27 August 1942, when she steamed from New York as convoy escort for Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, returning as escort for another convoy 12 September. She made two more convoy escort voyages to Guantanamo Bay and back to New York between 17 September and 24 October 1942. She then resumed escort duty between New York and Key West. During one period of this duty, 24 December 1942 to 13 June 1943, &quot;Plymouth&quot; completed eight convoy escort voyages from New York to Key West and back. On 2 March 1943, &quot;Plymouth&quot; collided with the submarine chaser USS &quot;SC-1024&quot; off of Cape Hatteras, which resulted in the sinking of the submarine chaser.

===Sinking, 5 August 1943===
On her last voyage, &quot;Plymouth&quot; departed New Jersey on 4 August 1943 as part of the escort for a convoy bound for Key West. At 21.37 hours the following evening she made underwater sound contact about 90 miles east of Elizabeth City, North Carolina. As she swung left, to bear on the target, a violent underwater explosion occurred just abaft the bridge. The force of the explosion rolled &quot;Plymouth&quot; to starboard. She then took on a heavy list to port with her entire port side forward of amidships in flames. She sank within two minutes.

Lieutenant Ormsby M. Mitchel, Jr., USNR, in command of &quot;Plymouth&quot;, was thrown violently against a bulkhead and sustained serious injuries, which later required amputation of his left leg. Despite his own condition, he directed abandon ship operations, remaining at his post until the ship went down. Rescued from a raft by USCGC &quot;Calypso&quot;, Lieutenant Mitchel was awarded the Navy Cross for extraordinary heroism. Soundman 3/Class Franklin A. McGinty was also awarded the Navy Cross and Purple Heart posthumously. Ensign Rubin Keltch, of New York City, was also awarded the Navy Cross posthumously for his service aboard the &quot;Plymouth&quot;. Ensign Keltch unhesitatingly risked his life to assist several survivors to safety. After making sure they were safe he went back into the engine room to save several men, but although the men came out he never did.

Rescue operations were hampered by heavy seas and sharks. Only 85 of the crew survived to be taken to Norfolk on 6 August. A Board of Investigation concluded that &quot;Plymouth&quot; had been sunk by a torpedo fired from an enemy submarine. The submarine was .

<doc id="1332513" wikidata="Q468875" url="?curid=1332513" title="Bothrops">
<text>Bothrops is a genus of highly venomous pit vipers endemic to the Neotropics. The generic name, &quot;Bothrops&quot;, is derived from the Greek words , , meaning , and , , meaning or , together an allusion to the heat-sensitive loreal pit organs. Members of this genus are responsible for more human deaths in the Americas than any other group of venomous snakes. Currently, 48 species are recognized.

==Description==
These snakes range from small, never growing to more than , to large at over in total length. Most are characterized by having a sharp &quot;canthus rostralis&quot; and an unelevated snout.

The arrangement of the scales on top of the head is extremely variable; the number of interorbital scales may be 3–14. Usually there are 7-9 supralabials and 9-11 sublabials. There are 21-29 rows of dorsal scales at midbody, 139-240 ventral scales, and 30-86 subcaudals, which are generally divided.

==Common names==
Lacépède originally applied the name &quot;lanceheads&quot; to all of these snakes, which he considered conspecific. Thus, older writings, as well as popular and sometimes scientific writings (including the American Heritage, Merriam-Webster, and New Shorter Oxford dictionaries), still often call them &quot;fer-de-lance&quot; (French, &quot;spearhead&quot;). However, many scientists and hobbyists now restrict this name to the Martinican species, &quot;B. lanceolatus&quot;. Other common names include American lanceheads and American lance-headed vipers.

==Geographic range==
&quot;Bothrops&quot; species are found in northeastern Mexico (Tamaulipas) southward through Central and South America to Argentina. They also occur on the islands of Saint Lucia and Martinique in the Lesser Antilles, as well as on Ilha da Queimada Grande off the coast of Brazil. &quot;B. atrox&quot; is also found on the island of Trinidad in the Caribbean off the eastern coast of Venezuela.

==Behavior==

Most species are nocturnal, although a few found at higher altitudes are active during the day. Otherwise, they may be seen on cloudy days or during periods of rain. Most are terrestrial, though all are capable of climbing. One species, &quot;B. insularis&quot;, which is endemic to Ilha da Queimada Grande, is considered to be semi arboreal. This species, unlike most &quot;Bothrops,&quot; preys primarily on birds, due to the absence of native mammal species on Queimada Grande. This feeding habit probably accounts for their more arboreal lifestyle compared with their mainland cousins. Many species of &quot;Bothrops&quot; exhibit tail vibration behavior when disturbed.

==Venom==
Members of this genus are responsible for more fatalities in the Americas than any other group of venomous snakes. In this regard, the most important species are &quot;B. asper&quot;, &quot;B. atrox&quot;, and &quot;B. jararaca&quot;. Without treatment, the fatality rate is estimated to be about 7%, but with treatment this is reduced to 0.5-3%.

Typical symptoms of bothropic envenomation include immediate burning pain, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, sweating, headache, massive swelling of the bitten extremity, hemorrhagic blebs, local necrosis, bleeding from the nose and gums, ecchymosis, erythemia, hypotension, tachycardia, coagulopathy with hypofibrinogenemia and thrombocytopenia, hematemesis, melena, epistaxis, hematuria, intracerebral hemorrhage, and kidney failure, secondary to hypotension and bilateral cortical necrosis. There is usually some discoloration around the bite site, and rashes may develop on the torso or the extremities.

In general, death results from hypotension secondary to blood loss, kidney failure, and intracranial hemorrhage. Common complications include necrosis and kidney failure secondary to shock and the toxic effects of the venom.

<doc id="1332516" wikidata="Q7994069" url="?curid=1332516" title="Whistles (company)">
<text>Whistles is a women&#x27;s contemporary fashion brand with more than 40 stores and 60 concessions in the UK, USA, Europe, Hong Kong, and Australia. It was founded in 1976 by Lucille and Richard Lewin.

In January 2008, Jane Shepherdson, former Topshop director, signed a deal to purchase a 20 per cent stake in Whistles and was appointed as chief executive. 

The brand was scheduled to unveil its relaunch days before Lehman Brothers collapsed. It survived the subsequent global economic recession of 2008-2009, during which one of its largest backers, Baugur, went bankrupt.

In March 2016, Whistles and its then-46 shops were bought by the South African retailer, Foschini Group.

==Product==
In the past, the style of Whistles was described as having &quot;a pretty but decidedly yummy mummy-ish air&quot;. Since Shepherdson&#x27;s appointment as chief executive, the clothes were said to have cleaner silhouettes with a more sophisticated palette; &quot;baby pinks and lilacs have made way for olives, camel, china blue, tea rose and yes, plenty of black – and the detailing has a quirky vintage feel rather than being fussy.&quot;

After this successful rebranding, Whistles had effectively shifted directions from boho-chic, which Shepherdson felt was outdated, to &quot;effortless&quot; and minimalist. Having attracted loyal and therefore older customers for some time, their goal was to target younger customers, &quot;between 25 and 45,&quot; who are &quot;confident about fashion, has their own innate style, knows what she wants to look like, quite independent, works in creative industries like media, fashion, the arts.&quot;

Unlike a number of brands at parent company Topshop, Whistles is not considered to be fast fashion, citing the needs of older customers in professional careers who want more expensive clothes that last longer while still retaining &quot;the excitement of trends&quot;. The clothing and accessories can also be bought through Bloomingdale&#x27;s in the United States.

At retailers that sell Whistles products, customers can expect to pay anywhere within the &quot;contemporary&quot; or &quot;popular&quot; fashion price point.

== Sustainability ==
In 2019, Whistles&#x27;s Head of CSR and Sustainability, Francesca Mangano, outlined the brand&#x27;s efforts to increase sustainability and decrease impact on the environment. In 2021, 55% of the corresponding year&#x27;s collection &quot;incorporated elements of responsible and lower impact materials,&quot; with 47% of the spring and summer and 53% of the autumn and winter collections incorporating &quot;responsible materials&quot;.

The sustainability efforts outlined include reducing the impact made on the planet&#x27;s environment, protecting human rights and fair labour standards, increasing inclusivity among employees, replacing fabrics with &quot;more responsible fibres and lower impact alternatives&quot;, increasing responsible waste and chemical management, and collaborating with their suppliers to decrease environmental footprints left by transportation.

Whistles is a signatory to the UK Government Modern Slavery Pledge, the End Uyghur Forced Labour Coalition, and participated in the UN Global Compact addressing the more than 400,000 seafarers stranded at sea due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.

<doc id="1332529" wikidata="Q1584181" url="?curid=1332529" title="Soul of a New Machine">
<text>Soul of a New Machine is the debut studio album by American industrial metal band Fear Factory, released on August 25, 1992, by Roadrunner Records. Although this record was Fear Factory&#x27;s first studio album to be released, it was actually their second album to be recorded, after &quot;Concrete&quot;, which was recorded in 1991 but not released until 11 years later. German magazine &quot;Rock Hard&quot; described it as death metal with many other elements such as industrial metal.

&quot;Soul of a New Machine&quot; was remastered and re-released on October 5, 2004, in a digipak, packaged together with the remastered &quot;Fear Is the Mindkiller&quot; EP.

==Overview==
Guitarist Dino Cazares has stated that &quot;Soul of a New Machine&quot; is a concept album, concerning man&#x27;s creation of a machine that could be either technological or governmental. It was also confirmed by bassist Christian Olde Wolbers in an interview. The particular concept would later play a more prominent role in some of Fear Factory&#x27;s later albums.

Jason Birchmeier of AllMusic described the album as ushering in the alternative metal era of the 1990s. &quot;Soul of a New Machine&quot; has also been described as death metal with elements of genres like industrial metal and, to some extent, grindcore. Author Colin Larkin of &quot;The Encyclopedia of Popular Music&quot; wrote &quot;&quot;Soul of a New Machine&quot; established Fear Factory as a genuine death metal force, with a good collection of songs delivered with originality and ferocity.&quot;

The record featured a different conceptual style from Fear Factory&#x27;s later works. &quot;Martyr&quot; is about someone who dies for a cause; &quot;Leechmaster&quot; is about relationship problems; &quot;Scapegoat&quot; was based on how Cazares was once wrongfully accused by the law; &quot;Crisis&quot; is an anti-war song; &quot;Crash Test&quot; concerns animal testing and &quot;Suffer Age&quot; is based on serial killer John Wayne Gacy. The other songs contain different themes. Samples from the movies &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot;, &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, and &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; are heard sporadically throughout the album.

==Reception==
AllMusic&#x27;s Jason Birchmeier remarked that &quot;Fear Factory were quite ahead of their time in 1992&quot;. The critic also noted the diversity of the genres featured in the recording, saying that &quot;Soul of a New Machine was so groundbreaking because it [fused] together some of the best aspects of numerous metal subgenres&quot;, which &quot;[resulted] in a unique sound&quot;.

&quot;Rock Hard&quot; rated the album highly, saying that the sound of the album was strange, indescribable yet required listening. Rock Hard also complimented the blending of various sub-genres, with particular note to Burton Bell for managing such an eclectic set of vocals.

*&quot;Kerrang!&quot; (p. 61) - &quot;[The album] contains all the unrefined qualities that would soon make Fear Factory legendary.&quot;

<text>Tuesday Morning Corporation was an American household merchandise discount home goods store headquartered in Dallas, Texas. Founded in 1974, Tuesday Morning once had over 700 locations across the country and advertised itself as having high quality products at low prices.

==History==
Tuesday Morning was established in 1974 by Lloyd Ross. Ross worked with manufacturers to buy their excess merchandise and host limited-time warehouse sales to offer these goods at a discount to the public. Tuesday Morning moved to a pop-up retail location in 1979 with seasonal events. 

Tuesday Morning went to full-time retail operations in 1979 and went public in 1984 with 57 stores. At its peak in 2018, Tuesday Morning operated over 700 locations and had sales of over $1 billion. Tuesday Morning focused on discount home goods. 

In May 2020, following extended store closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Tuesday Morning filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization and was delisted from the NASDAQ. During the reorganization process Tuesday Morning closed close to 200 unprofitable store locations and a distribution center. In December 2020, Tuesday Morning emerged from bankruptcy with a rights offering, enabling the ability to pay all vendor claims in full and protect shareholder value. Upon emerging, Tuesday Morning established a new executive leadership team who failed to live up to expectations and tanked the company’s stock from $4+ per share down to 30¢ per share in just over one year. 

On May 25, 2021, Tuesday Morning was re-listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange under TUEM. In 2022, Tuesday Morning was acquired by Retail ECommerce Ventures for $35 million. 

On February 14, 2023, Tuesday Morning once again filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy; Tuesday Morning then proceeded to close roughly half of all stores nationwide, including nearly all of its stores in California. On April 28, 2023, just days after the collapse of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, Tuesday Morning announced that it would be going out of business and close all 200 remaining locations by July 2023. All Tuesday Morning store locations officially closed and Tuesday Morning began an ecommerce presence in July 2023. However, on July 10, 2023, Tuesday Morning announced that the Chapter 11 case would be converted to a Chapter 7 liquidation effective July 27, 2023, and liquidate all remaining assets of Tuesday Morning. The e-commerce presence is expected to remain intact and continue operating during the process.

<text>Vim is the name of a range of household cleaning products originally produced by Lever Brothers (later Unilever). The Vim brand is currently owned by the German multinational company Henkel, while Unilever retains ownership in Canada and Vietnam.

==History==
Vim scouring powder, one of the first products created by William Lever, first appeared on the market in 1904, an offshoot of Monkey Brand scouring soap. The name is thought to derive from the colloquial English word &quot;&quot; which has the same meaning as the Latin &quot;vis&quot;, &quot;vim&quot; (&quot;force&quot;, &quot;vigour&quot;).

Vim was produced at Port Sunlight near Liverpool, England. The name Vim remained solely associated with the scouring powder until 1993, when a range of associated products were released. Vim was also the name of a detergent tablet manufactured by Lever Brothers, and sold in the United States during the 1960s. It was the sponsor of the sitcom on CBS, &quot;The Lucy Show&quot;, starring Lucille Ball.

Former owner Unilever abandoned Vim in favour of rival product Jif, although it was still sold in some other countries in Europe.

In December 2004, it was sold to the group Guaber, based in Italy. Vim is currently owned by Henkel Group after its acquisition of Spotless Group in 2015, although it is still marketed by Unilever in Canada and Sri Lanka, where it has a 90% market share. Vim is also sold as a Unilever brand in South Africa and India.

<text>Pratap Singh Giani (also Partap Singh Gyani, 1855–1920) was a Sikh academic, scholar and calligraphist.

== Life ==
He was born in 1855, the son of Bhai Bhag Singh Giani of Lahore (Gurmukhi: ਭਾਈ ਭਾਗ ਸਿੰਘ ਲਾਹੌਰ). As a young boy, Partap Singh learnt Punjabi, Urdu and Sanskrit and studied Sikh scriptures. In 1884, he accompanied Thakur Singh Sandhanvalia to England to read the Guru Granth Sahib to the deposed Sikh ruler of the Punjab, Maharaja Duleep Singh and to re-convert him to Sikhism. Partap Singh remained in England for six months. On return to India, he worked as a &quot;granthi&quot; (scripture-reader) at Gurdwara Kaulsar in Amritsar. When Maharaja Duleep Singh was due to come back to India, Partap Singh accompanied Thakur Singh and his sons to Delhi with the intention of going to Bombay to receive the Maharajah. On hearing the news of Duleep Singh&#x27;s detention at Aden, Partap Singh returned to Amritsar while Thakur Singh proceeded to Pondicherry. At Amritsar, Partap Singh worked secretly for Thakur Singh distributing his pro-Duleep Singh letters among his confidants and friends. Towards the close of 1887, he was arrested at Amritsar and sent to Lahore jail. He escaped from prison and, turning a sadhu, travelled to different parts of the country in the company of holy men.

During one such journey he happened to meet Max Arthur Macauliffe, then engaged in translating the Sikh scripture into English.

Macauliffe was impressed by his learning and wished that he would assist him in his work. Partap Singh, who had introduced himself under the assumed name of “Bava Ishar Das”, revealed thereupon his identity to him. Macauliffe interceded with the government on his behalf and had the warrants of his arrest withdrawn in January 1889.

Partap Singh settled down in a house in Kaulsar near Baba Atal, in Amritsar, and for several years performed katha expounding the Holy Writ in front of the Akal Bung.

A fine calligraphist, Partap Singh transcribed volumes of the Guru Granth Sahib, the most famous of them being the one still preserved in the Harimandir Sahib. This copy, completed in 1908, is written in very bold Gurmukhi characters on large-sized 25&quot; by 28&quot; sheets of Kashmiri paper and is installed on the first floor of the Harimandir Sahib where it is used for the recital of akhand paths or unbroken readings of the Guru Granth Sahib. The entire volume, 1527 leaves, that is, 8054 pages, with double borders in red, blue and yellow, is written in Giani Pratap Singh&#x27;s hand and is known as Vadde Baba Ji (largesized Holy Volume). The name of the scribe is mentioned at the end of the text, on a separate sheet. Volumes of the Holy Books transcribed by Giani Partap Singh are also preserved at Baba Atal and Takht Sri Hazur Sahib, Nanded.

In 1902, Partap Singh joined Aitchison College, also known as Chiefs College, Lahore, as granthi and instructor. According to the records of the college, he was employed initially at a salary of Rupees 5 per month, which was later increased to Rupees 50 per month from 1904. He taught in this college as a Sikh religious teacher till his death in 1920.

== Legacy ==
According to Panjaba Phain, August 1916 issue, he was the first secretary of the Sanatan Singh Sabha (also referred to as Amritsar Singh Sabha). He was also editor of the earliest published Sikh newspaper Akal Prakash, which made its first appearance in 1876. He is also said to have translated into Punjabi Major Evans Bell&#x27;s book, &quot;The Annexation of the Punjab and Maharaja Duleep Singh&quot;. Pratap Singh died at Lahore on 20 July 1920.

Pratap Singh&#x27;s son Kartar Singh Giani was a lawyer at Amritsar and was later a member of the Sikh Gurudwara Judicial Commission. His grandsons Harinder Singh Giani and Narinder Singh Gyani were lawyers practicing in the Punjab and Haryana High Court at Chandigarh and Amritsar. His great-grandson Harpreet Singh Giani is an advocate and a barrister currently practicing in the Punjab and Haryana High Court in India and in England and Wales.

<text>Johann Heinrich Hottinger (10 March 1620 – 5 June 1667) was a Swiss philologist and theologian.

== Life and works ==
Hottinger studied at Geneva, Groningen and Leiden. After visiting France and England he was appointed professor of church history in his native town of Zürich in 1642. The chair of Hebrew at the &quot;Carolinum&quot; in Zürich was added in 1643, and in 1653 he was appointed professor ordinarius of logic, rhetoric and theology.

He gained such a reputation as an Oriental scholar that the Elector of the Palatinate in 1655 appointed him professor of Oriental languages and biblical criticism at the University of Heidelberg. While in Heidelberg he also worked to reestablish the Collegium Sapientiae, a Reformed theological seminary. In 1661 he returned to Zürich, where in 1662 he was appointed principal of the University of Zürich. In 1667 he accepted an invitation to succeed Johann Hoornbeck (1617–1666) as professor in the University of Leiden. Before he could take up this position he drowned with three of his children after the upsetting of a boat while crossing the river Limmat. He was succeeded upon his death at the chair of theology in Zürich by his fellow Zürich-native younger namesake and former student at Heidelberg, Johann Heinrich Heidegger.

His chief works are &quot;Historia ecclesiastica Nov. Test.&quot; (1651–1667); &quot;Thesaurus philologicus seu clavis scripturae&quot; (1649; 3rd edition 1698); &quot;Etymologicon orientale, sive lexicon harmonicum heptaglotton&quot; (1661). He also wrote a Hebrew and an Aramaic grammar.

==Family==
His son, Johann Jakob Hottinger (1652–1735), who became professor of theology at Zürich in 1698, was the author of a work against Roman Catholicism, &quot;Helvetische Kirchengeschichte&quot; (4 vols, 1698–1729); and his grandson, Johann Heinrich Hottinger (1681–1750), who in 1721 was appointed professor of theology at Heidelberg, wrote a work on dogmatics, &quot;Typus doctrinae christianae&quot; (1714).

== Works ==
*&quot;Historia ecclesiastica&quot; &quot;Novi Testamenti&quot; 9 vols. (1651–1667)

<text>Victoria Libertas (also known as &quot;VL&quot; or in Italian Vuelle), full name Unione Sportiva Victoria Libertas Pallacanestro, is a professional basketball team that is based in Pesaro, Italy. The club competes in the top level Italian professional basketball league, the Lega Basket Serie A (LBA). It was commonly known across Europe as Scavolini Pesaro, from the name of its historical main sponsor Scavolini (from 1975 to 2014), an Italian kitchen and bathroom products designer and manufacturer, whose co-founder Valter Scavolini was formerly club president. Now, it is known as Carpegna Prosciutto Basket Pesaro after its title sponsor. For past club sponsorship names, see the list below.

==History==
Victoria Libertas was officially founded in 1946 and had its best seasons during the 1980s. After being among the top teams in Italy for decades, Victoria Libertas under the name Scavolini Pesaro, won its first important trophy the 1982–83 FIBA European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, rival the historic French club of ASVEL. Also Scavolini, participated in consecutive lost finals in 1985–86 against the title holder FC Barcelona and in 1986–87 against Cibona. Since then, Italian League was won twice (in 1988 and 1990), and the Italian Cup was also won twice (in 1985 and 1992). Scavolini participated in 1990–91 FIBA European Champions Cup, and managed to play in the semi-final of the Final Four in Paris where the club eliminated by the legendary Pop 84 (the former Jugoplastika) and ranked fourth after one more defeat in the third place game by Maccabi Tel Aviv. The two lost finals in the FIBA Korać Cup in 1990 (against Ram Joventut) and in 1992 (against il Messaggero Roma) show the dynamic of the club and at the beginning of the new decade.
In recent years, Victoria Libertas was among the best European teams, having played the Euroleague in 2001–02 and 2004–05 seasons. In 2004–05 it unexpectedly got to the Euroleague Top-8 and was defeated in the quarter finals by the eventual champion Maccabi Tel Aviv. Furthermore, Victoria Libertas shooting guard, Charles Smith, was honored with the first-ever Euroleague&#x27;s &quot;Alphonso Ford Top Scorer Trophy&quot;, named after the late Euroleague scoring champ who died in 2004 and who was replaced in Victoria Libertas by Smith himself.

===Recent history===
In July 2005, as a consequence of the poor administration of the previous two seasons, Victoria Libertas failed to remain within the parameters required to join the Italian Basketball League and wound up. Pesaro&#x27;s second team, &quot;Falco Spar&quot;, agreed with former Victoria Libertas president Valter Scavolini to join forces to invest in a team to bring back Victoria Libertas to Italian First Division (Lega Basket Serie A).

The new team, named Scavolini Gruppo Spar (or simply &quot;Scavolini-Spar&quot;), played the 2005–06 season in the Italian Third Division (&quot;B1&quot;). Owners&#x27; target resulted in Scavolini-Spar having large amounts of money at its disposal compared with the other teams of the league. Players from the upper divisions were enrolled, star Carlton Myers among them, which lead the team to win the league and gain promotion to the Second Division (LegaDue).

In 2006–07 Scavolini-Spar won the LegaDue playoff series, lining up players such as Carlton Myers, Rodney White (9th overall pick of the 2001 NBA draft), Mindaugas Žukauskas (captain of the Lithuanian national basketball team) and Michael Hicks (Panamian national team star). The team was therefore promoted, for the second straight year, to play the Lega Basket Serie A 2007–08 league.

Following the 2009–10 season, Spar&#x27;s secondary sponsorship contract expired. The club picked up a new secondary sponsor in Italian clothing company Siviglia, thereby changing its full sponsored name to Scavolini Siviglia Style Pesaro (more simply Scavolini Siviglia Pesaro). The club changed its secondary sponsorship again with the expiration of Siviglia&#x27;s contract at the end of the 2011–12 season, becoming Scavolini Banca Marche Pesaro.

From the 2014–15 season the historical sponsor &quot;Scavolini&quot; was replaced (for the first time since 1975) by the new main sponsor &quot;Consultinvest&quot;, whereby the name of the team became Consultinvest Pesaro. Since 2019 summer the new club naming is Carpegna Prosciutto Basket Pesaro thanks to the relationship with the new Title Sponsor Prosciutto di Carpegna.

<doc id="1332563" wikidata="Q1289435" url="?curid=1332563" title="List of Toyota engines">
<text>This is a list of piston engines developed, independently or with other car companies, by Toyota Motor Corporation.

==Engine codes==
Toyota has produced a wide variety of automobile engines, including three-cylinder, four-cylinder, V6 and V8 engines. The company follows a naming system for their engines:
# The first numeric characters specify the engine block&#x27;s model (usually differed by displacement)
# The next one or two letters specify the engine family
# The suffix (separated by a dash) specifies the features of the engine:

Other manufacturers may modify the engine after it has left the Toyota factory but the engine still keeps the original Toyota designation. For example, Lotus added a supercharger to the 2ZZ-GE in some versions of the Lotus Elise and Exige, but the engine is still labelled 2ZZ-GE, not 2ZZ-GZE.

Examples:

* 3S-GTE
** 3S – Third model in the S engine family
** G – Performance cylinder head DOHC
** T – Turbocharged
** E – Multi-point fuel injection
* 1UR-FSE
** 1UR – First model in the UR engine family
** F – Normal cylinder head DOHC
** S – D-4S Gasoline direct injection
** E – Multi-point fuel injection
* 1KD-FTV
** 1KD – First model in the KD engine family
** F – Normal cylinder head DOHC
** T – Turbocharged
** V – D-4D diesel common rail direct injection

The use of &quot;G&quot; to denote twin cam engines was decided on in 1971, with the renaming of the 10R into 8R-G. Before that, twin cams had received separate numerical codes.

In 1987, Toyota began assigning dual letter engine codes to some of the &quot;engine family&quot; categories in some engine lines, particularly six-cylinder models. This can create potential confusion. E.g. 1MZ-FE – This is not a supercharged, narrow angle, fuel injected M-series engine, but a narrow angle, fuel injected MZ-series engine. Confusion is easiest to avoid when using the dash to separate between the engine series and its own characteristics: for instance, 1MZ-FE rather than 1M-ZFE.

Starting in 2015, the designations after the dash have a maximum combination of three letters, even though there are more suffixes applicable, especially when newer engine technologies are introduced. For example, both the 2GR-FKS and 8AR-FTS engines have electronic multi-point fuel injection, but the &quot;E&quot; suffix is not included in the code.

===Dynamic Force engine series===
The Dynamic Force engine series introduced in 2017 uses a different naming scheme, which is similar to that used by Honda and Suzuki. The two numbers between the first and second letters denote the displacement of the engine in liters. The suffix denoting the features of the engine is still used, as with prior engines.

Examples:

* M20A-FKS
** M20A is a 2.0-liter engine, as denoted by the &quot;20&quot; in &quot;M20A&quot;
** F – Normal cylinder head DOHC
** K – On-demand Atkinson cycle in non-hybrid engines
** S – D-4S Gasoline direct injection
* T24A-FTS
** T24A is a 2.4-liter engine, as denoted by the &quot;24&quot; in &quot;T24A&quot;
** F – Normal cylinder head DOHC
** T – Turbocharged
** S – D-4S Gasoline direct injection

Some engines don’t share the same displacement as with the one found in the engine code. For example, the displacement of the V35A-FTS is closer to 3.4 L despite being marketed as a 3.5 L engine. Moreover, there are a few engines that use the naming scheme of the Dynamic Force family of engines but are not actually part of them, such as the diesel-powered F33A-FTV.

==Diesel==
Starting in 1957 until 1988, Toyota established a separate dealership in Japan dedicated to cars and trucks installed with diesel engines, called &quot;Toyota Diesel Store&quot;. When the dealership was disbanded, diesel products are now available at all locations, with commercial products exclusive to &quot;Toyota Store&quot; and &quot;Toyopet Store&quot; locations.

<text>Demanufacture is the second studio album by American industrial metal band Fear Factory, released on March 3, 1995, by Roadrunner Records. It is the band&#x27;s first album with their classic line-up, adding new bassist Christian Olde Wolbers, who performed on close to half of the album&#x27;s tracks, with guitarist Dino Cazares handling the rest. Many regard it as the band&#x27;s best album and a heavy metal classic. The album was certified Gold in Australia by ARIA and Silver in the UK by the BPI.

== Album information ==
&quot;Demanufacture&quot; is a concept album about a man&#x27;s struggles against a machine-controlled government, with each song a chapter in his life. The band stated the album took its inspiration from the movie &quot;The Terminator&quot;.

This album was originally mixed by its producer Colin Richardson, who had performed both duties on the band&#x27;s debut album. However, differences between the band and producer emerged over the mix, with Richardson wishing not to stray too far from &quot;Soul of a New Machine&quot;. In the 2005 re-release liner notes, Monte Conner notes Richardson&#x27;s focus on the guitars at the expense of the electronics, and suggests that this is the reason for the rejection of Richardson&#x27;s mix. The final mix for the album was subsequently performed by Greg Reely, Rhys Fulber and the band. The Richardson mixes of &quot;Zero Signal&quot; and &quot;Body Hammer&quot; were later released on the &quot;Hatefiles&quot; compilation.

The album was recorded at Bearsville Studios in rural New York. Also in residence at the studio was Bon Jovi, recording their album &quot;These Days&quot;. Fear Factory were in the studio next door and one of Bon Jovi&#x27;s engineers asked them to turn the sound down, as it was bleeding into Bon Jovi&#x27;s drum mics, during Bon Jovi&#x27;s recording sessions.

After the release of the album, some critics and observers suggested that drummer Raymond Herrera had in fact used a drum machine, due to the often blistering speed and machine-like precision of the drumming, most notably on the kick drums. He records, however, with a click track to keep time. He is also known to use triggers on his drum sets for the purpose of keeping the sound of his drums consistent, particularly kick drums, regardless of how hard they are struck. This is a common strategy used by metal drummers when playing at such speeds, as relatively few drummers are able to achieve such rapid and consistent notes without the use of triggers.

Samples, loops, and electronic textures were handled by Rhys Fulber throughout the album, with Reynor Diego contributing additional samples and keyboard parts. The music for &quot;A Therapy for Pain&quot; was originally written as the opening for &quot;Echoes of Innocence&quot; from the then-unreleased &quot;Concrete&quot; album. The outro passage was inspired by John Carpenter, Hijokaidan, and Aphex Twin. The use of organ in &quot;Dog Day Sunrise&quot; was inspired from an in-joke between Diego and Bell about The Doors. During post-production work with Richardson, Bell performed and added the organ parts to the track.

The opening riff of the title track was voted 19th in &quot;Total Guitar&quot;″s list of &quot;The Heaviest Riffs of all Time&quot;. The opening sample for &quot;Pisschrist&quot; and &quot;Zero Signal&quot; are both taken from &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;. &quot;Concrete&quot; also had a track named &quot;Piss Christ&quot;, but the two bear no similarities other than the title.

The original digipaks had slightly different artwork, most noticeably a different barcode on the front cover, and different colouring within the words &quot;Fear Factory&quot;. The digipak was re-released in 2003 with all bonus tracks mentioned above, but with the new Roadrunner Records logo on the front and back and different lettering on the spine. This version is not limited, but has since been replaced by the remastered edition detailed below. In all, four different digipak versions of the album are available.

Tracks 1 to 4 were featured on 2006&#x27;s &quot;The Best of Fear Factory&quot;.

In July 2013, the band toured Australia performing &quot;Demanufacture&quot; in its entirety.

In celebration of the 20 year anniversary of &quot;Demanufacture&quot; in 2015, Fear Factory embarked on a tour across Europe and North America playing the album.

&quot;Your Mistake&quot; is from the album &quot;Victim in Pain&quot;.

===Involvement of Christian Olde Wolbers===
Although Christian Olde Wolbers is credited as the bassist for the album and appears in the band photo, Dino Cazares has repeatedly claimed to have played bass himself on all tracks; because Olde Wolbers was not in the band during recording but joined before the album&#x27;s release and promotional tour. However, this is contradicted by former drummer Raymond Hererra who has said that Olde Wolbers was a full member during production but did not perform on all tracks, due to Cazares re-arranging many riffs during tracking of his guitars. The band were behind schedule with recording and Olde Wolbers did not have time to learn the new arrangements so Cazares recorded bass on these tracks. In a 1998 interview with &quot;Terrorizer&quot; (with the whole band present), Olde Wolbers states that Cazares performed &quot;45 to 50 percent of the bass&quot; on &quot;Demanufacture&quot;. Olde Wolbers later mentioned in an interview in 2004 that he made a small contribution to the writing of the title track and &quot;Pisschrist&quot;.

== In popular culture ==
The music video for the song &quot;Replica&quot; is unlockable in the video game &quot;Test Drive 5&quot;. Several songs from this album were used without lyrics for the game &quot;Carmageddon&quot;. These were &quot;Demanufacture&quot;, &quot;Zero Signal&quot; (which had the piano ending omitted) and &quot;Body Hammer&quot;. 

&quot;Zero Signal&quot; was also featured on the soundtrack to the movie &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; and can be heard in part during the fight scene between Scorpion and Johnny Cage, although the song was an instrumental. In reference to this, the band regularly featured a vocal sample of Steve Ritchie saying &quot;Fatality&quot; during live performances of the song thereafter. 

&quot;Demanufacture&quot; was also used in the opening video of GameShark 2 released by Mad Catz in 2004, along with numerous other Fear Factory songs.

== Reception ==
Upon its release, &quot;Demanufacture&quot; proved to be extraordinarily successful and received universal acclaim from both music critics and band&#x27;s fans. It is often regarded as the band&#x27;s best album. Andrew Kapper of About.com named &quot;Demanufacture&quot; as the recommended album to listen to by the band, and stated in his review:
&quot;Replica&quot; was covered by Dutch symphonic metal band Epica in 2007 as part of a &quot;deluxe re-release&quot; of the album &quot;The Divine Conspiracy&quot;, and was performed live by them at the Whisky a Go Go in Hollywood, California, with Dino Cazares joining on stage in September 2007. &quot;Flashpoint&quot; was covered as a one-man effort by American metal artist Common Dead in 2012 as a standalone single. &quot;Pisschrist&quot; was covered by American heavy metal band Byzantine in 2016 as part of their re-release of their 2015 album &quot;To Release Is to Resolve&quot; for the European region.

== Track listing ==

<text>Paulus Hector Mair (1517–1579) was a German civil servant fencing master from Augsburg. He collected Fechtbücher and undertook to compile all knowledge of the art of fencing in a compendium surpassing all earlier books. For this, he engaged the painter Jörg Breu the Younger, as well as two experienced fencers, whom he charged with perfecting the techniques before they were painted. The project was very costly, taking a full four years, and according to Mair, consumed most of his family&#x27;s income and property. Three versions of his compilation, and one later, less extensive manuscript, have been preserved.

Not only did Mair spend huge sums on his collections and on his projects, he also had a very expensive lifestyle, frequently hosting receptions for the more important burghers of Augsburg. His own income was not sufficient for this, and during many years, he misappropriated funds from the city treasury, with the supervision of which he had been entrusted since 1541. His embezzlements were discovered in 1579, and Mair was hanged as a thief at the age of 62.

==Martial arts compendium==

Mair compiled a voluminous, encyclopedic compendium of the martial arts of his time, collected in 16 books in two volumes. The compendium survives in three manuscript copies. The subject matter treated is:

Volume 1:
*A. German longsword
*B. Dussack (backsword)
*C. Staff
*D. Pike
*E. Halberd
*F. Fighting with the scythe
*G. Fighting with the sickle
*H. Unarmed combat (wrestling)
Volume 2:
*I. Dagger
*K. Spanish rapier
*L. Battle axe
*M. Joust, mounted combat for sport
*N. Tournament history and rules
*O. Judicial combat
*P. Mounted combat, serious (self-defense)
*Q. Fencing in plate armour (shield, spear, longsword)

==Manuscripts==
*three copies of the compendium, in two volumes each:
** German version: Saxon State and University Library, Dresden, &quot;Mscr. Dresd. C 93/94&quot;, after 1542, two volumes, 244+328 folia.
*** online facsimile: Digital Collections of the SLUB Dresden
**Latin version: Bavarian state library, München &quot;cod. icon 393&quot;, after 1542, two volumes, 309+303 folia. This is the most luxurious production of Mair&#x27;s, and he sold it to duke Albert V. of Bavaria, allegedly for the enormous sum of 800 fl., in 1567 (

<doc id="1332627" wikidata="Q3175576" url="?curid=1332627" title="Education in Iran">
<text>Education in [[Iran]] is centralized and divided into K-12 education plus higher education. Elementary and secondary education is supervised by the Ministry of Education and higher education is under the supervision of Ministry of Science, Research and Technology and Ministry of Health and Medical Education for medical sciences. As of 2016, around 94% of the Iranian adult population is literate. This rate increases to 97% among young adults ages between 15 and 24 without any gender consideration. By 2007, Iran had a student-to-workforce population ratio of 10.2%, standing among the countries with the highest ratio in the world.

Primary school (&quot;Dabestân&quot;, &quot;دبستان&quot;) starts at the age of 6 for a duration of six years. Junior high school (&quot;Dabirestân دوره اول دبیرستان&quot;), also known as middle school, includes three years of Dabirestân from the seventh to the ninth grade. Senior high school (&quot;Dabirestân&quot;, &quot;دوره دوم دبیرستان&quot;), including the last three years, is mandatory. The student at this level can study theoretical, vocational/technical, or manual fields, each program with its specialties. Ultimately, students are given a high school diploma. The requirement to enter into higher education is to have a high school diploma, and passing the national university entrance examination, Iranian University Entrance Exam (&quot;Konkur کنکور&quot;), which is similar to the French baccalauréat exam (for most of universities and fields of study). Iran suffers from a problem of over education and falsified academic degrees. 

Universities, institutes of technology, medical schools and community colleges provide the higher education. Higher education is sectioned by different levels of diplomas: &quot;Fogh-e-Diplom&quot; or &quot;Kārdāni&quot; after two years of higher education, &quot;Kārshenāsi&quot; (also known under the name &quot;license&quot;) is delivered after four years of higher education (bachelor&#x27;s degree). &quot;Kārshenāsi-ye Arshad&quot; is delivered after two more years of study (master&#x27;s degree). After which, another exam allows the candidate to pursue a doctoral program (Ph.D.).

The Human Rights Measurement Initiative (HRMI) finds that Iran is fulfilling only 91.0% of what it should fulfill for the right to education based on the country&#x27;s income level. HRMI breaks down the right to education by examining the rights to both primary and secondary education. While considering Iran&#x27;s income level, the nation is achieving 99.2% of what should be possible based on its resources (income) for primary education but only 82.9% for secondary education.

The government banned opening new private schools in 2023.

== History of education in Iran ==
=== Pre-Islamic Iran ===
Scholars have discovered documents from around 550 BC relating to an emphasis on education in ancient Persia (modern-day Iran). The documents urged people to gain knowledge to understand God better and to live a life of prosperity. Religious schools were set up in limited areas to serve the government. Although most of the problems focused on religious studies, there were also lessons regarding administration, politics, technical skills, military, sports, and arts. The first higher education organization, Gundeshapur or Jondishapoor (which still exists), was formed during the Sassanid period, around the third century.

=== Safavid dynasty ===
This dynasty marks the first of modern education in Iran. There was a mixed emphasis on Islamic values and scientific advancements.

=== Muzaffari era ===
Formed in 1898, the Educational Committee (Anjuman-i Ma&#x27;arf) was the first organized program to promote educational reform not funded by the state. The committee was composed of members of foreign services, ulama, wealthy merchants, physicians, and other prominent people. The conflicting interests of people involved led to difficulties enacting, however they did succeed in the opening of many new primary and secondary educational schools. It also created a public library, offered adult classes, published an official newspaper (Ruznamah-i Ma&#x27;arif), and established a printing company called The Book Printing Company (Shirkat-i Tab&#x27;-i Kitab).

=== The Literacy Corps (1969–1979) ===
The literacy corps took place over the White Revolution, which occurred under Muhammad Reza Pahlavi. The government believed that most of the population was illiterate, and the Literacy Corps was an attempt to change the statistics. The program included hiring young men who had a degree in secondary education to serve in the Literacy Corps and involved teaching children between the ages of 6 and 12, most of whom had not attended 2nd-grade education, to read. The goal was to improve literacy in Iran cheaply and efficiently, which they also believed would improve workmanship. 200,000 young men and women participated in the Literacy Corps, teaching 2.2 million boys and girls and over a million adults. In many cases, the volunteers would continue to work as educators after their conscription ended.

=== Post-Islamic Revolution ===
At first, post-1979 Islamic Revolution placed heavy emphasis on educational reforms. Politicians wanted Islamic values to be present within the schooling system as quickly as possible. However, pressures due to the Iran-Iraq War and economic disparities forced plans for education back as other issues took priority. Some significant changes were made. First came the Islamization of textbooks. Schools were then segregated according to the sex of students. Observation of Islamic Law in schools became mandatory and religious ceremonies was maintained.

By the 1990s, more significant changes arose. The annual academic system switched to a credit-based system. For example, if a student were to fail a class, rather than repeating the whole year, they would retake the credits. The mandatory duration of high school was shortened from four years to three. However, the fourth year was still available as an option to bridge the gap between high school and university. Also, many technical and vocational programs were added to help train students for the workforce, which proved to be popular with students.

===Modern education===
The first Western-style public schools were established by Haji-Mirza Hassan Roshdieh. Amir Kabir (the Grand Minister) helped establish the first modern Iranian college in the mid-nineteenth century. In the nineteenth-century, the first Iranian university, modeled after European universities, was established during the first Pahlavi period. There are both free public schools and private schools in Iran at all levels, from elementary school through university. Education in Iran is highly centralized. The Ministry of Education oversees educational planning, financing, administration, curriculum, and textbook development. Teacher training, grading, and examinations are also the responsibility of the ministry. At the university level, however, every student attending public schools is required to commit to serving the government for several years, typically equivalent to those spent at the university, or pay it off for a meager price (typically a few hundred dollars) or completely free if one can prove inability to pay to the Islamic government (post-secondary and university). During the early 1970s, efforts were made to improve the educational system by updating the school curriculum, introducing modern textbooks, and training more efficient teachers.

The 1979 revolution continued the country&#x27;s emphasis on education, with the new government putting its stamp on the process. The most significant change was the Islamization of the education system. All students were segregated by sex. In 1980, the Cultural Revolution Committee was formed to oversee the institution of Islamic values in education. An arm of the committee, the Center for Textbooks (composed mainly of clerics), produced 3,000 new college-level textbooks reflecting Islamic views by 1983. Teaching materials based on Islam were introduced into the primary grades within six months of the revolution.

In 2014, it was reported that around 4 million children eligible for a K-12 education had dropped out of the school system.

Each year, 20% of government spending and 5% of GDP goes to education, a higher rate than most developing countries. 50% of education spending is devoted to secondary education, and 21% of the annual state education budget is devoted to the provision of tertiary education.

==Unconstitutional change==
In 2024 Supreme cultural revolution staff introduced a law that makes it illegal for people to protest universities and government educational law deemed to be constitutional change without a public vote or referendum.

==Mandatory Islamic pray time==
In October 2023 government ordered mandatory half hour Islamic prayer everyday for schoolkids. College kids have to learn General Solomani&#x27;s will.

==Education reform==

The &quot;Fourth Five-Year Development Plan (2005–2010)&quot; has envisaged upgrading the quality of the educational system at all levels, as well as reforming education curricula, and developing appropriate programs of vocational training, a continuation of the trend towards labor market-oriented education and training.

With the new education reform plan in 2012, the pre-university year will be replaced with an additional year in elementary school. Students will have the same teacher for the first three years of primary school. Emphasis will be made on research, knowledge production, and questioning instead of math and memorizing alone. In the new system, the teacher will no longer be the only instructor but a facilitator and guide.

Other more general goals of the education reform are:
#Making education more global in terms of knowledge.
#Nurturing children who believe in the one God.
#Providing a socially just education system.
#Increasing the role of the family in the education system.
#Increasing the efficiency of the education system.
#Achieving the highest standard of education in the region.

==Hybrid method learning program==
Ever since after the pandemic the government supreme council of education has a program for mass hybrid teaching in universities with learning management system and schools with Shad software. The government offers grants for research into hybrid education.

==Privatization==
In recent decades, schools in Iran have come to be viewed as corporate businesses with steadily rising injustice. Iranian education has witnessed a mass inflation with the rising takeover of private schools in big cities like Isfahan. The cost of education in a public school could be around 14 million dollars a year per student.

In 2023, Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader of Iran called public schools weak and for poor people compared to private schools. Studying for a 1-year term in private schools may cost 50 million dollars as of July 2023.

==Teacher shortage==

As of 2023, Iran has about 950,000 teachers; there is a shortage of about 60,000 teachers in the country. As of 2023, there are a million teachers. Half of all schools lack school counselors; there is a shortage of about 30,000 people in this position.

In the southeastern province of Sistan and Baluchestan, schools themselves are in short supply, and about 30% of students are unable to attend school.

==Teacher education==
Farhangian University is the university of teacher education and human resource development in the Ministry of Education. Teacher training centers in Iran are responsible for training teachers for primary, orientation cycle, and gifted children&#x27;s schools. These centers offer four-year programs leading to a B.A. or B.S. degree in teaching the relevant subject. At a minimum, students that enter teacher training centers have completed a high school diploma. A national entrance examination is required for admission.

There are 98 teacher training centers in Iran, all belonging to Farhangian University. Teacher education in Iran has been considered more centralized than in other Western countries such as Great Britain.

==Foreign languages==

Persian is officially the national language of Iran. Arabic, as the language of the Quran, is taught grades 7–12. In addition to Arabic, students are required to take one foreign language class in grades 7–12. Although German and French are offered in some schools and textbooks have been written, English continues to be the most desired language. Iran has added the French language since 2022 new school year to the regular school curriculum for students who wish to take French instead of English in an effort to break the monopoly of English.

&quot;Kanoun-e-Zabaan-e-Iran&quot; or Iran&#x27;s Language Institute affiliated with the Center for Intellectual Development of Children and Young Adults was founded in 1979. Persian, English, French, Spanish, German, Russian, and Arabic are taught to over 175,000 students each term.

English is studied in first and second high school. However, the quality of English education in schools could be more satisfactory, and most students have to take English courses in private institutes to obtain better English fluency and proficiency.

Before 2018, some primary schools also taught English. However, in January 2018, a senior educational official announced that teaching English would be banned in primary schools, including non-government schools.

Presently, there are over 5000 foreign language schools in the country, 200 of which are in Tehran. A few television channels air weekly English and Arabic language sessions, particularly for university candidates preparing for the annual entrance test.

==Internet and distance education==
Full Internet service is available in all major cities and it is very rapidly increasing. Many small towns and even some villages now have full Internet access. The government aims to provide 10% of government and commercial services via the Internet by end-2008 and to equip every school with computers and connections by the same date.

Payame Noor University (established 1987) as a provider exclusively of distance education courses is a state university under the supervision of the Ministry of Science, Research and Technology.

As of 2020, 70% of Iranian schools linked to the local intranet.

==Higher education==
As of 2013, 4.5 million students are enrolled in universities, out of a total population of 75 million.
Iranian universities graduate almost 750,000 annually.

The tradition of university education in Iran goes back to ancient times. By the twentieth century, however, the system had become antiquated and was remodeled along French lines. The country&#x27;s 16 universities were closed after the 1979 revolution and were then reopened gradually between 1982 and 1983 under Islamic supervision.

While the universities were closed, the Cultural Revolution Committee investigated professors and teachers and dismissed those who were believers in Marxism, liberalism, and other &quot;imperialistic&quot; ideologies. The universities reopened with Islamic curricula. In 1997, all higher-level institutions had 40,477 teachers and enrolled 579,070 students.

Admission to public universities, some are tuition-free, is based solely on performance on the nationwide Konkour exam. Some alternative to the public universities is the Islamic Azad University which charges high fees.

The syllabus of all the universities in Iran is decided by a national council as a result the difference of the quality of education among the universities is only based on the location and the quality of the students and the faculty members. Among all top universities in the country there are three universities each notable for some reasons:

The University of Tehran (founded in 1934) has 10 faculties, including a department of Islamic theology. It is the oldest (in the modern system) and biggest university in Iran. It has been the birthplace of several social and political movements.

Tarbiat Modares University (means: professor training university) also located in Tehran is the only exclusively post-graduate institute in Iran. It only offers master&#x27;s, PhD, and postdoc programs. It is also the most comprehensive Iranian university in the sense that it is the only university under the Iranian Ministry of Science System that has a Medical School. All other Medical Schools in Iran are a separate university and governed under the Ministry of Health; for example, the Tehran University of Medical Sciences (commonly known as Medical School of Tehran University) is in fact separate from Tehran University.

Sharif University of Technology, Amirkabir University of Technology, and Iran University of Science and Technology also located in Tehran are nationally well known for taking in the top undergraduate engineering and science students; and internationally recognized for training competent undergraduate students. It has probably the highest percentage of graduates who seek higher education abroad.

K. N. Toosi University of Technology is among most prestigious universities in Tehran. Other major universities are at Shiraz, Tabriz, Isfahan, Mashhad, Ahvaz, Kerman, Kermanshah, Babolsar, Rasht, and Orumiyeh. There are about 50 colleges and 40 technological institutes.

In 2009, 33.7% of all those in the 18–25 age group were enrolled in one of the 92 universities, 512 Payame Noor University branches, and 56 research and technology institutes around the country. There are currently some 3.0 million university students in Iran and 1.0 million study at the 500 branches of Islamic Azad University. Iran had 1 million medical students in 2011.

=== Starred students ===
Starred student دانشجوی ستاره دار is a common name for a list of Iranian higher education students who are charged with a religious or political conviction. These students are registered in university under specific circumstance or not at all as punishment. Student Affairs Organization and Ministry of Science and Research denied existence of such lists.

===Entrepreneurship===
In recent decades Iran has shown an increasing interest in various entrepreneurship fields, in higher educational settings, policy making and business. Although primary and secondary school textbooks do not address entrepreneurship, several universities including Tehran University and Sharif University, offer courses on entrepreneurship to undergraduate and graduate students.

In accordance with the third five-year development plan, the &quot;entrepreneurship development plan in Iranian universities&quot;, (known as KARAD Plan) was developed, and launched in twelve universities across the country, under the supervision of Management and Planning Organization and the Ministry of Science, Research and Technology.

==Women in education==

In September 2015, women comprised more than 70% of all universities&#x27; student body in Iran. This high level of achievement and involvement in high education is a recent development of the past decades. The right to a respectable education has been a major demand of the Iranian women&#x27;s movement starting in the early twentieth century.

Before the 1979 revolution a limited number of women went to male-dominated schools. Most traditional families did not send their girls to school because the teachers were men or the school was not Islamic. During the 1990s, women&#x27;s enrollment in educational institutions began to increase. The establishment and the expansion of private universities Daneshgah-e-azad-e Islami also contributed to the increasing enrollment for both women and men. Under the presidency of Rafsanjani and the High council of cultural Revolution, the Women&#x27;s social and cultural council was set up and charged with studying women&#x27;s legal, social, and economic problems. The council, with the support of Islamic feminists, worked to lift all restrictions on women entering any field of study in 1993.

After the Islamic Revolution, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and his new regime prioritized Islamizing the Iranian education system for both women and men. When Khomeini died in 1989, under president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, many but not all restrictions on women&#x27;s education were lifted, albeit with controversy. The right to education for everyone without discrimination is explicitly guaranteed under Iran&#x27;s constitution and international documents, which Iran has accepted or to which it is a party. Some scholars believe that women have poor access to higher education because of specific policies and the oppression of women&#x27;s rights in Iran&#x27;s strictly Islamic society.

However, Iranian women have fair access to higher education as seen by a significant increase in female enrollment and graduation rates, as female university students now outnumber males. Iranian women emerge to more prominent positions in the labor force, demonstrating professional women&#x27;s presence and confidence in the public sphere. The opportunities for women&#x27;s education and their involvement in higher education have grown exponentially after the Iranian Revolution. According to UNESCO world survey, Iran has the highest female to male ratio at the primary level of enrollment in the world among sovereign nations, with a girl to boy ratio of 1.22:1.

==Schools for Gifted Children==
The National Organization for Development of Exceptional Talents (NODET), also known as SAMPAD (سمپاد), maintains middle and high schools in Iran. These schools were shut down for a few years after the revolution, but later re-opened. Admittance is based on an entrance examination and is very competitive. Their tuition is similar to private schools but may be partially or fully waived depending on the student&#x27;s financial condition.
Some NODET alumni are world-leading scientists.
Other schools are Selective Schools which are called &quot;Nemoone Dolati&quot;. These schools are controlled by the government and have no fees. Students take this entrance exam alongside NODET exams.

==Organization for Educational Research and Planning (OERP)==

OERP is a government affiliated, scientific, learning organization. It has qualitative and knowledge-based curricula consistent with the scientific and research findings, technological, national identity, Islamic and cultural values.

OERP&#x27;s Responsibilities:

# To research on the content of the educational,

<text>Flavors, an early object-oriented extension to Lisp developed by Howard Cannon at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory for the Lisp machine and its programming language Lisp Machine Lisp, was the first programming language to include mixins. Symbolics used it for its Lisp machines, and eventually developed it into New Flavors; both the original and new Flavors were message passing OO models. It was hugely influential in the development of the Common Lisp Object System (CLOS).

Implementations of Flavors are also available for Common Lisp.

New Flavors replaced message sending with calling generic functions.

Flavors offers and daemons with the default method combination (called ).

== Flavors and CLOS features comparison ==
Flavors offers a few features not found in CLOS:
* Wrappers
* Automatic lexical access to slots using variables within methods.
* Internal flavor functions, macros and substs.
* Automatically generated constructors.
* options: , , .
* function for sending messages.

CLOS offers the following features not found in Flavors:

<doc id="1332645" wikidata="Q3375560" url="?curid=1332645" title="Royal Newfoundland Regiment">
<text>The Royal Newfoundland Regiment (R NFLD R) is a Primary Reserve infantry regiment of the Canadian Army. It is part of the 5th Canadian Division&#x27;s 37 Canadian Brigade Group.

Predecessor units trace their origins to 1795, and since 1949 Royal Newfoundland Regiment has been a unit of the Canadian Army. During the First World War the battalion-sized &quot;Newfoundland Regiment&quot; was the only North American unit to fight in the Gallipoli campaign of 1915. Later in the war the regiment was virtually wiped out at Beaumont Hamel on July 1, 1916, the first day of the Battle of the Somme, but was rebuilt and continued to serve throughout France and Belgium until the armistice, serving as part of the British Army of the Rhine in 1919. In December 1917, George V bestowed the regiment with the right to use the prefix &quot;Royal&quot; before its name. It was the only military unit to receive this honour during the First World War.

During the Second World War, the Newfoundland Militia was raised for defence and renamed the Newfoundland Regiment in 1943. The regiment remained in a home-defence role and also trained recruits for the two regiments of the Royal Artillery that were recruited in Newfoundland for overseas service. In 1949, Newfoundland joined Canada as the latter&#x27;s 10th province and part of the Terms of Union required the re-creation of the Royal Newfoundland Regiment as the primary militia unit for the province. The regiment is ranked last in the Royal Canadian Infantry Corps&#x27; order of precedence.

==Predecessor units==

=== Militia units ===
Though the Royal Newfoundland Regiment traces its existence to 1795 and the establishment of the Royal Newfoundland Regiment of Foot, its origins are based in the existence of numerous local militia units raised in the colony in the eighteenth century. Prominent Newfoundland militias include Michael Gill&#x27;s militia in the 1704 defence of Bonavista, the St. Mary&#x27;s Militia that captured an American privateer during the American Revolution, and the 150 Newfoundland militiamen who served with the Royal Highland Emigrants during the Battle of Quebec.

=== Royal Newfoundland Regiment of Foot ===
As conflict between Revolutionary France and Britain increased in the 1790s, Britain found its overseas colonies threatened from French actions. Facing war on land and lacking the suitable land forces to defend its overseas colonies, in 1795 the British Government ordered Thomas Skinner of the Royal Engineers to raise a regiment for local defence purposes. Skinner was the engineering officer responsible for the construction of defensive positions atop Signal Hill in the aftermath of the French and Indian Wars. By the following year, strength for the regiment had reached 35 officers and 615 men, organized into 10 line infantry companies, one light infantry company, and one grenadier company. In September 1796, the French Navy was reported to be sailing for St. John&#x27;s to invade the city; in response, the entirety of the Regiment of Foot erected tents atop Signal Hill and around Fort Amherst to give the appearance of a much larger force defending the city. The ruse was successful, causing the naval force to abandon any attempts to land at St. John&#x27;s; instead, the navy sailed south for Bay Bulls and burned all of the houses before departing the area. In 1797 the Grenadier Company escorted Governor Waldergrave aboard , which had recently been the site of an unsuccessful mutiny attempt. Conditions in Newfoundland were harsh during this time period, even for the garrison soldiers. Winter food often spoiled, and a fire at Fort William in 1798 destroyed much of the regiment&#x27;s bedding and medical supplies, making life that much harder for the soldiers. As a result, the desertion rate was high. Matters for the regiment further worsened in April 1800 when 50 soldiers loyal to the United Irish Movement attempt to desert en masse from Signal Hill. The alarm was sounded during their attempt, and 16 mutineers were captured. The newly appointed commanding officer, Brigadier John Skerrett (formerly of the West India Regiment) ordered the five ringleaders hung and the remaining deserters sent by prison ship to Halifax. Questioning the loyalty of his mostly-Irish soldiers, Brigadier Skerrett ordered the regiment&#x27;s line companies (the bulk of the unit) to Halifax, receiving the 66th Regiment of Foot in its place. The regiment remained in Halifax for a further two years until peace with Revolutionary France came with the Treaty of Amiens. Having no further need for local defence units in North America, Britain disbanded the Royal Newfoundland Regiment of Foot in March 1802.

=== Royal Newfoundland Regiment of Fencible Infantry ===

==== Garrison duty ====

Peace for Britain was short-lived, and in 1803 the country once again found itself at war with Napoleonic France. Brigadier Skerrett was tasked with recruiting an infantry unit consisting of ten companies in Newfoundland for the purposes of local defence. Titled the Newfoundland Regiment of Fencible Infantry, the unit consisted of many veterans of the previous Newfoundland Regiment. By 1806 the regiment numbered nearly 700 men and was given the title Royal by King George III. &#x27;Local defence&#x27; included all of British North America, and in 1807 the regiment was deployed to Fort Anne in Nova Scotia. The regiment was again transferred in 1808, this time to the Citadel in Quebec City where it remained until the outbreak of war in 1812.

====War of 1812====
The regiment, called at the time the Royal Newfoundland Regiment of Fencible Infantry, was significantly involved in the War of 1812. In May 1812, weeks before outbreak of the war with the United States, Major-General Sir Isaac Brock, commander of his Majesty&#x27;s Forces in Upper Canada, deployed the regiment into smaller companies or detachments, combined with other units or regiments in defensive positions all over the province. Some were employed as marines on board naval vessels on the Great Lakes as part of the Provincial Marine. These marines were involved in a number of notable naval actions during the war, including the Battle of Lake Erie and the capture of USS &quot;Tigress&quot; and USS &quot;Scorpion&quot;.

Battles in which elements of the regiment took part included: Skirmish at Canard River July 16, 1812, Battle of Detroit Aug 16 1812, Battle of Matilda Sept 16 1812, Battle of the River Raisin or Frenchtown, Michigan January 22, 1813, the British raid on Ogdensburg, New York February 22, 1813, the Battle of York (Toronto) April 27, 1813 and operations in northwest Ohio, including the siege of Fort Meigs in the spring of 1813 and the Battle of Fort George (Niagara-on-the-Lake) May 25–27, 1813. The regiment was also involved in the British Raid on Sacket&#x27;s Harbour, New York on May 29, 1813, and provided soldiers who served as marines in the Battle of Lake Erie on September 10, 1813. The regiment&#x27;s service continued at the Battle of the Thames or Moraviantown on October 5, 1813, and in northern Michigan at the Battle of Michilimackinac or Mackinac Island August 4, 1814 and as part of the capture of American naval vessels &quot;Tigress&quot; September 3, 1814 and &quot;Scorpion&quot; on Upper Lake Huron on September 6, 1814.

It was largely distributed throughout the zone as attached sub-units and not as a formed battalion and was disbanded in 1816. A monument depicting a toy soldier of the 1813 Royal Newfoundland Regiment standing over a fallen American toy soldier was unveiled in Toronto in November 2008. The War of 1812 Monument in Ottawa, which is situated across from the National War Memorial, also features a soldier of the Royal Newfoundland Regiment – one of seven bronze figures which stands on top of that monument.

In 2012, on the occasion of the bicentennial of the War of 1812, the Government of Canada, responding to recommendations made by the Royal Newfoundland Regiment Advisory Council and similar recommendations made by an advisory committee to the Minister of Canadian Heritage for the War of 1812, awarded the Royal Newfoundland Regiment three battle honours. These were for the victory at Detroit in 1812, for the regiment&#x27;s role at the battle of Maumee in 1813 and a general &quot;theatre honour&quot; (&quot;Defence of Canada 1812–1815&quot;), for the regiment&#x27;s broader service in successful engagements throughout the War of 1812. Colours emblazoned with these battle honours were presented to the regiment&#x27;s 2nd battalion in the presence of their Colonel-in-Chief, the Princess Royal, in June 2016. The ceremonies coincided with events marking the 100th anniversary of the Battle of Beaumont-Hamel.

The Royal Newfoundland Regiment of Fencible Infantry was disbanded in 1816 following the conclusion of hostilities with both America and Napoleonic France. Newfoundland did not see another military unit in the island until 1824 with the establishment of the Royal Newfoundland Veteran Companies. Although similar in name, this unit consisted of Chelsea Pensioners from the United Kingdom and was not recruited locally. The Newfoundland Companies therefore have no relationship with the Royal Newfoundland Regiment.

==Newfoundland Regiment in the First World War==

===Outbreak of war===

During the First World War Newfoundland was a largely rural Dominion of the British Empire with a population of 240,000 people, and not yet part of Canada, having, along with the Imperial fortress colony of Bermuda, been left out of the 1867 confederation of the other colonies of British North America to form the Dominion of Canada (the Colony of Newfoundland had become the Dominion of Newfoundland in 1907). The outbreak of the First World War in 1914 led the Government of Newfoundland to recruit a force for service with the British Army. Even though the island had not possessed any formal army organization since 1870, enough men soon volunteered that a whole battalion was formed, and later maintained throughout the war. The first recruits in the regiment were nicknamed the &quot;Blue Puttees&quot; due to the unusual colour of the puttees, chosen due to the shortage of dark khaki woolen material on the island. The blue puttees were quickly abandoned when the first five hundred reached England in October 1914. The headquarters for recruiting and training was supplied by the Church Lads&#x27; Brigade, as was the nucleus of the command structure. In fact, the first man to enlist was also a member of the CLB. Bermudian-born Sir Joseph Outerbridge, who had been the Commanding Officer of the CLB from 1890 to 1894, was the Vice President of the Patriotic Association of Newfoundland, which raised and maintained the Newfoundland Regiment, two of his sons serving in the regiment on the Western Front.

The regiment trained at various locations in the United Kingdom and increased from an initial contingent of 500 men to full battalion strength of 1,000 men, before being deployed. After a period of acclimatization in Egypt, the regiment was deployed at Suvla Bay on the Gallipoli peninsula with the 29th Division in support of the Gallipoli Campaign.

=== 1st Battalion ===

====Gallipoli====
On 20 September 1915 the regiment landed at Suvla Bay on the Gallipoli peninsula, where the British VIII Corps, IX Corps and the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) had been attempting to seize control of the Dardanelles Strait from Turkey since the first landings on 25 April. At Gallipoli the 1st Newfoundland Regiment faced snipers, artillery fire and severe cold, as well as the trench warfare hazards of cholera, dysentery, typhus, gangrene and trench foot. Over the next three months thirty soldiers of the regiment were killed or mortally wounded in action and ten died of disease; 150 were treated for frostbite and exposure. Despite the terrible conditions, the Newfoundlanders stood up well. When the decision was made to evacuate all British Empire forces from the area, the regiment was chosen to be a part of the rearguard, finally withdrawing from Gallipoli with the last of the British Dardanelles Army troops on 9 January 1916. With the close of the Gallipoli Campaign the regiment spent a short period recuperating before being transferred to the Western Front in March 1916.

====Battle of the Somme====
In France, the regiment regained battalion strength in preparation for the Battle of the Somme. The regiment, still in the 29th Division, went into the line in April 1916 at Beaumont-Hamel. Beaumont-Hamel was situated near the northern end of the 45-kilometre front being assaulted by the joint French and British force. The attack, originally scheduled for June 29, 1916, was postponed by two days to July 1, 1916, partly on account of inclement weather, and partly to allow more time for the artillery preparation. The 29th Division, with its three infantry brigades, faced defences manned by experienced troops of the 119th (Reserve) Infantry Regiment of the 26th (Württemberg) Reserve Division. The 119th (Reserve) Infantry Regiment had been involved in the invasion of France in August 1914 and had been manning the Beaumont-Hamel section of the line for nearly 20 months prior to the battle. The German troops had been spending a great deal of their time not only training but fortifying their position, including the construction of numerous deep dugouts and at least two tunnels.

The infantry assault by the 29th Division on 1 July 1916 was preceded ten minutes earlier by a mine explosion under the fortified Hawthorn Ridge Redoubt. The explosion of the Hawthorn Mine underneath the German lines destroyed a major enemy strong point but also served to alert the German forces to the imminent attack. Following the explosion, troops of the 119th (Reserve) Infantry Regiment moved from their dugouts into the firing line, even preventing the British from taking control of the crater as they had planned. When the assault finally began, the troops from the 86th and 87th Brigade of the 29th Division were quickly stopped. With the exception of the 1st Battalion of the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers on the right flank, the initial assault foundered in No Man&#x27;s Land at and short of the German barbed wire. At divisional headquarters, Major-General Beauvoir De Lisle and his staff were trying to unravel the numerous and confusing messages coming back from observation posts, contact aircraft and the two leading brigades. There were indications that some troops had broken into and gone beyond the German first line. In an effort to exploit the perceived break in the German line he ordered the 88th Brigade, which was in reserve, to send forward two battalions to support the attack.

At 8:45 a.m. the Newfoundland Regiment and 1st Battalion, Essex Regiment received orders to move forward. The Newfoundland Regiment was situated at St. John&#x27;s Road, a support trench behind the British forward line and out of sight of the enemy. Movement forward through the communication trenches was not possible because they were congested with dead and wounded men and under shell fire. Battalion Commander Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Lovell Hadow, decided to proceed immediately into an offensive formation and advance across the surface, which involved first navigating through the subsequent series of barbed wire defenses. As they breasted the skyline behind the British first line, they were effectively the only troops moving on the battlefield and clearly visible to the German machine gun positions. Most of the Newfoundland Regiment who had started forward were dead within 15 minutes of leaving St. John&#x27;s Road trench. Most reached no further than the Danger Tree, a skeleton of a tree that lay in No Man&#x27;s Land that was being utilized as a landmark. So far as can be ascertained, 22 officers and 758 enlisted were directly involved in the advance. Of these, all the officers and slightly under 658 other ranks became casualties. Of the 780 men who went forward only 110 survived, of whom only 68 were available for roll call the following day. For all intents and purposes the Newfoundland Regiment had been entirely destroyed, the unit as a whole having suffered a casualty rate of approximately 93 percent. The only unit to suffer greater casualties during the attack was the 10th (Service) Battalion, Prince of Wales&#x27;s Own (West Yorkshire Regiment), attacking west of Fricourt village.

====After Beaumont-Hamel====
Although significantly under strength, the Newfoundland Regiment continued to see service and after taking on reinforcements was back in the front line on 14 July near Auchonvillers. On 17 July the 88th Brigade was transferred to a quieter portion of the Western Front. In the weeks and months following the attack, the surviving officers wrote letters of condolence to families and relatives in Newfoundland. A period of recovery coupled with additional reinforcements eventually helped the regiment return to full strength. Six weeks later they were beating off a German gas attack in Flanders. Subsequently, they distinguished themselves in a number of battles: back on the Somme at Gueudecourt in October 1916; and on 23 April 1917, at Monchy-le-Preux during the Battle of Arras, where they lost 485 men in a day but checked a German attack. In Flanders during the Third Battle of Ypres the battalion attacked on 16 August at the Battle of Langemarck and on 9 October 1917 the battalion formed the left flank of 29th Division&#x27;s attack as part of the Battle of Poelcappelle. In November 1917 at Masnières-Marcoing during the Battle of Cambrai the regiment stood its ground although outflanked and in April 1918 stemmed a German advance at Bailleul. Following a period out of the line, providing the guard force for General Headquarters at Montreuil, they joined the 28th Brigade of the 9th (Scottish) Division and were in action again at Ledegem and beyond in the advances of the Hundred Days Offensive during which Thomas Ricketts became the youngest army combatant of the war to be awarded the Victoria Cross.

=== Other battalions ===
In addition to the 1st Battalion mentioned earlier, the Royal Newfoundland Regiment raised two additional battalions during the war: the 2nd (Reserve) Battalion and the 3rd Battalion. The 2nd Battalion primarily served as the main overseas training unit for new recruits before their deployment with the 1st Battalion. It also functioned as the holding battalion for soldiers who returned to Britain due to medical reasons. The 2nd Battalion spent the majority of the war in Scotland, most famously at Ayr. The 3rd Battalion was the title given to the recruiting and training unit based in St. John&#x27;s, and was the administrative home of new recruits before embarking overseas, as well as being the formation responsible for home defence. Thus, soldiers recruited in Newfoundland and Labrador were posted first to the 3rd Battalion, then the 2nd, and finally with the 1st.

In addition to its three battalions, the Royal Newfoundland Regiment played a part in the administration of the Newfoundland Forestry Corps. Formed in 1917, the corps was a uniformed pioneer unit stationed in Scotland tasked with supporting the British war effort by providing much needed timber for the war effort. Volunteers were clothed in khaki uniform and wore the distinctive Caribou cap badge of the Royal Newfoundland Regiment. In addition, some wounded officers and enlisted ranks from the 1st Battalion whose wounds prohibited them from combat service were posted to the Forestry Corps in command positions.

===First World War honours===
Governor Davidson strongly felt that the Newfoundland Regiment deserved special recognition for its actions during the battles of Ypres and Cambrai. His request to the British government to add the prefix Royal to the regiment&#x27;s name was granted and George V bestowed the regiment with the prefix in December 1917. This was the only time during the First World War that this honour was given and only the third time in the history of the British Army that it has been given during a time of war.

== Second World War ==
When the United Kingdom declared war on Germany on September 3, 1939, Newfoundland too found itself at war. The presence of the German Navy in Atlantic waters threatened the security of the colony, and in September 1939 it was decided to raise the Newfoundland Militia, a local defence militia unit for the defence of the island. The Newfoundland Militia was tasked with guarding strategic positions on the island, including the dry docks, water supply, and oil reserves in St. John&#x27;s and the Newfoundland Broadcasting Company&#x27;s radio station in Mount Pearl. Later, these guard duties were expanded to include the maintenance of a coastal defence battery on Bell Island to protect the Wabana Iron Ore Mines, and mines and docks throughout the rest of the island. Following the Battle of France, Canada assumed responsibility for the defence of Newfoundland with the establishment of W Force. The Newfoundland Militia was immediately placed under command of W Force. The efforts of the Canadian Army to expand and train the militia to professional standards resulted in the Newfoundland Militia being re-designated the Newfoundland Regiment on March 2, 1943. The regiment stayed in a home-defence role, but in addition to these duties was also tasked with training excess recruits for the two regiments of the Royal Artillery that were recruited in Newfoundland for overseas service: the 166th (Newfoundland) Field Artillery Regiment and 59th (Newfoundland) Heavy Artillery Regiment. By the end of the Second World War, 1,668 Newfoundlanders had enlisted for service; 820 had deployed overseas with the Royal Artillery while a further 447 trained gunners were in Newfoundland awaiting transport to Europe on VE Day. 17 members of the regiment were killed on December 12, 1942, during the Knights of Columbus Hostel fire in St. John&#x27;s.

==Later history==
In 1949, after a pair of referendums, Newfoundland joined Canada as the latter&#x27;s 10th province. One of the Terms of Union, Term 44, specified the re-creation of the Royal Newfoundland Regiment, which became the primary militia unit for the province. The regiment is ranked last in the Canadian Armed Forces order of precedence due to Newfoundland&#x27;s entry into Canada in 1949, long after other Canadian regiments were recognized in the order of precedence. The Freedom of the City was exercised by the Royal Newfoundland Regiment in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador on July 1, 1963. On March 1, 1961, owing to low numbers in both units the Royal Newfoundland Regiment amalgamated with the 166th (Newfoundland) Field Artillery Regiment, RCA inheriting the guns of that unit.

Since 1992, soldiers and sub-units of the regiment have served to augment Regular Force units in Cyprus, Bosnia, Sierra Leone and Afghanistan on peacekeeping and combat missions. On 30 August 2010, Corporal Brian Pinksen died of his wounds eight days after being injured by an improvised explosive device in Afghanistan, making him the regiment&#x27;s first combat fatality since the First World War.

The Regiment has also served on a number of post-Confederation domestic operations. These include providing humanitarian support following Hurricane Igor in 2010 (OP LAMA) and Hurricane Fiona (OP LENTUS-22), snow removal and transportation following the January 2020 North American storm complex (OP LENTUS-20), and arctic sovereignty patrols through regular participation in Operation Nanook. Beginning in 2019, 2RNFLDR was given responsibility for providing soldiers to an Arctic Response Company Group.

==Band==
The Royal Newfoundland Regiment Band is presently the only military band active in Newfoundland and Labrador. Being part of the primary reserve, the band is composed of volunteer members, many of whom have studied and trained at the Logistics Training Centre Music Division at CFB Borden. The first mention of a bugle and drum band in the regiment during the First World War was made in &quot;The Fighting Newfoundlander&quot;. Its members were drawn from the regular ranks of infantry on an &quot;ad hoc&quot; basis. Many of that band&#x27;s instruments were destroyed from artillery fire on the beaches of Gallipoli in September 1915. In 2018, drum used in the 1950s and 60&#x27;s was donated to the regimental museum for preservation.

The basis for the modern band was founded in 1956 as the Loyal Orange Band from Topsail. Under the direction of Edgar Adams, the band was asked to serve as the band of the regiment, amalgamating in 1962 with the 166th Heavy Field Regiment Band and the band relocated from Buckmaster&#x27;s Circle to its present headquarters at CFS St. John&#x27;s. It performs at numerous military and civilian functions such as dinners, public visits and military parades. Among these events was the Trooping of the Colour for Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother in 1966 and the visit of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip in 1978. Other notable events have included the Presentation of Colours in 1983, Pope John Paul II&#x27;s visit in 1984, the state visit by Baudouin of Belgium and the royal visit of Prince Charles in 2009.

==Lineage==
The government of Canada does not recognize an unbroken lineage of the Royal Newfoundland Regiment to earlier units as there were gaps in existence. However, it recognizes that the regiment commemorates the history and heritage of previous units. In this respect Canada has awarded three battle honours to the regiment to commemorate the services rendered during the War of 1812 by the Royal Newfoundland Regiment of Fencible Infantry and it recognizes battle honours earned by an early iteration of the regiment during the First World War.

<text>Marty Hoey (1951 – May 15, 1982) was a mountaineer and mountain guide who took part in a 1982 expedition to Mount Everest. During an attempted ascent that would have made her the first American woman to summit Everest, she plunged over the edge of the Great Couloir to her death, as the result of an unsecured climbing harness. She had scaled Washington&#x27;s Mount Rainier over 100 times, and led expeditions on Alaska&#x27;s Denali.

==Climbing career ==

For more than ten years, Hoey worked as a professional guide on Mount Rainier and on Mount McKinley, and she also climbed on more distant ranges. Hoey climbed Pik Lenin in 1974 and was a part of the 1976 Nanda Devi expedition.

Hoey also worked for Dick Bass, as safety patrol chief at the Snowbird ski resort. She befriended him and accompanied him on his own successful ascent of Mount McKinley, and he was a member of her climbing group when she perished on Mount Everest, in 1982. When Bass eventually summitted Everest in 1985, he dedicated his ascent to her.

===Death on Everest===

Expedition teammate Jim Wickwire said that he and Hoey were perched on a 45-degree rock slope at about , carrying gear to establish Camp 6, with the expectation of heading for the summit in the next day or two. Wickwire said that Hoey leaned back to let him go ahead, and a buckle on her harness opened, releasing her from the fixed rope and sending her plunging down into a crevasse.

Hoey&#x27;s body was never recovered. Whittaker said, &quot;I can&#x27;t think of a more beautiful resting place; she fell into the prettiest place that ever was.&quot; Whittaker cited Hoey&#x27;s death as a contributing factor to the expedition&#x27;s failure to summit Everest, saying: &quot;If Marty had been with us, we would have made it.&quot; The 16 remaining team members, all men, would make a third and final attempt, and ultimately be turned back, shy of the summit, by fierce weather.

Hoey was one of ten fatalities on Everest in the 1982 climbing season, but the only American. Some other fatalities that season were noted British climbers Peter Boardman and Joe Tasker.

<text>Paul Emerson Carlyle Ince (; born 21 October 1967) is an English professional football manager and former player who was most recently manager of Reading. A midfielder, Ince played professionally from 1986 to 2007, starting his career with West Ham United and later representing Manchester United, Liverpool, Middlesbrough, Wolverhampton Wanderers, Swindon Town and Macclesfield Town in England, as well as Inter Milan in Italy. With a combined total of 271 league appearances for the two, Ince is one of the few players, especially in the Premier League era, to have represented both of arch rivals Liverpool and Manchester United.

Ince spent the majority of his playing career at the highest level; after breaking through with his boyhood club West Ham United in the Second Division, he joined Manchester United in 1989, where he won the Premier League twice, the FA Cup twice and the Football League Cup once during his six-year spell at Old Trafford. After falling out with manager Alex Ferguson, Ince was sold to Inter Milan of Serie A in 1995, where he was a runner-up in the 1997 UEFA Cup. After two years in Italy, Ince returned to the Premier League with Liverpool, later also representing Middlesbrough and Wolverhampton Wanderers in the top flight.

Ince was capped 53 times by the England national team, scoring two goals. He played at UEFA Euro 1996, the 1998 FIFA World Cup and Euro 2000, and became the first black player to captain England. 

After a spell as player-coach of Swindon, he retired from playing while player-manager of Macclesfield Town in 2007. He went on to manage Milton Keynes Dons (twice), Blackburn Rovers, Notts County and Blackpool. His son Tom is also a footballer.

==Club career==
===West Ham United===
Paul Emerson Carlyle Ince was born in Ilford, Greater London. He grew up as a West Ham United supporter. He was spotted playing, aged 12, by West Ham manager John Lyall around the time that the club was in the Second Division and achieved a surprise FA Cup final triumph over Arsenal.

Ince signed for the Hammers as a trainee, aged 14. Lyall helped Ince through troubled school times eventually signing him as a YTS trainee, on leaving school, in 1984. He is a product of the West Ham youth team and made his debut in English football on 30 November 1986 against Newcastle United in the First Division. He became a regular player in 1987–88, proving himself to have all-round qualities of pace, stamina, uncompromising tackling and good passing ability. He also packed a powerful shot, and was awarded with England under-21 honours to go with the youth caps he acquired as an apprentice. He firmly established himself as the successor in West Ham&#x27;s midfield for the veteran Billy Bonds, who retired at the end of the 1987–88 season. Unfortunately for Ince, West Ham were not enjoying one of their best spells when he broke into the team. Despite having won the FA Cup in 1980 and finished third in the league in 1986, they had failed to sustain their challenge for major honours and finished 15th in 1987 and 16th in 1988, and worse was to follow.

In August 1988, an eventful season for Ince began. In a struggling West Ham side, he shot to national recognition with two stunning goals in a shock 4–1 win over defending league champions Liverpool in the League Cup, and continued to score goals as the Hammers reached the semi-finals while having real trouble finding any form in the League. West Ham lost to Luton Town in the semi-finals and, despite frequent displays of individual brilliance from Ince, were relegated at the end of the season, which cost manager John Lyall his job after 15 years at the helm. 

===Manchester United===
Ince played just once in the Second Division the following season before completing a highly controversial transfer to Manchester United for £1 million. Ince had been photographed in a Manchester United kit long before the transfer was complete, which appeared in the &quot;Daily Express&quot;. Ince received abuse from West Ham United fans for many years afterwards. The initial move was postponed after he failed a medical, but was quickly completed on 14 September 1989 after he later received the all-clear.

In an article in &quot;Four Four Two&quot; magazine, Ince said:

&quot;&quot;I spoke to Alex Ferguson and the deal was close to being done. I then went on holiday, and my agent at the time, Ambrose Mendy, said it wasn&#x27;t worth me coming back to do a picture in a United shirt when the deal was completed, so I should do one before I left, and it would be released when the deal was announced. Lawrence Luster of the &quot;Daily Star&quot; took the picture and put in the library. Soon after, their sister paper, the &quot;Daily Express&quot;, were looking for a picture of me playing for West Ham, and found the one of me in the United shirt in the pile. They published it and all hell broke loose. &quot;I came back from holiday to discover West Ham fans were going mad. It wasn&#x27;t really my fault. I was only a kid, I did what my agent told me to do, then took all the crap for it.&quot;&quot;

Ince eventually made his Manchester United debut in a 5–1 win over Millwall, although his next game for United came in a 5–1 Manchester derby defeat by Manchester City. Ince became a strong presence in the United midfield alongside Bryan Robson and Neil Webb, although the first season of this midfield partnership saw Robson and in particular Webb miss many games due to injury. 

United won the FA Cup in his first season, defeating Crystal Palace 1–0 in a replay at Wembley after initially drawing 3–3. In both of these games, Ince was selected at right-back in favour of Viv Anderson, with his favoured central midfield position being occupied by Mike Phelan. Ince was man of the match for the replay.

Over the next four seasons, Robson&#x27;s United career gradually wound down until he finally left to manage Middlesbrough in 1994. During this time, Ince found himself playing alongside several other different central midfielders, including Mike Phelan, Neil Webb and Darren Ferguson. One of his best games came in February 1994, when he scored in a 2–2 away draw with former club West Ham in the Premier League.

Ince won his second winners&#x27; medal when Manchester United defeated Barcelona in the final of the European Cup Winners Cup in Rotterdam in 1991, and received his third another year later when United beat Nottingham Forest in the 1992 League Cup final.

Manchester United continued to dominate the domestic game in 1993–94, enjoying an almost unbroken lead of the Premier League throughout the season, and Ince was the midfield general in the side which won the &quot;double&quot; of league and FA Cup in 1994. A year later Manchester United went to West Ham on the last day of the season, needing a win to retain their Premier League crown. They could only draw the game and Blackburn Rovers took the title. Ince&#x27;s next game saw them lose the FA Cup final to Everton, leaving United without a major trophy for the first time in six seasons. 

In June 1995, Ferguson sold Ince to Inter Milan for £7.5 million – at the time one of the biggest fees involving an English club. Ferguson had long sustained a tempestuous relationship with Ince, labelling him a &quot;bottler&quot; and a &quot;big-time Charlie&quot; (a statement Ferguson said later he regretted). Ince&#x27;s nickname, &quot;The Guvnor&quot;, also rankled with Ferguson, who once berated him by saying, &quot;There&#x27;s only one guvnor around here, Incey, and it ain&#x27;t you&quot;. Many fans saw this as the prime reason for Ince being sold, rather than on footballing or economic grounds.

While at United, Ince won two Premier League title medals as well as two FA Cup winner&#x27;s medals and one winner&#x27;s medal each in the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup and Football League Cup. He had also collected runners-up medals in the League Cup twice and the FA Cup once.

===Inter Milan===
In the 1995–96 season, Inter failed to challenge for a 14th scudetto, finishing seventh in Serie A. Ince, though, had a successful first season, playing in all but four of Inter&#x27;s league matches and performing well after a slow start which had started speculation that he could be on his way back to the Premier League as early as the November transfer window - with Arsenal and Newcastle United both reported to be interested. However, he would remain in Milan for two seasons.

The next year, Ince had another successful season with the nerazzurri, scoring 6 times in 24 matches in the championship – in which Inter finished third – and also playing his part in Inter&#x27;s run through to the UEFA Cup Final. Ince scored in the third round second-leg match away to Boavista as Inter swept all before them before meeting Schalke 04 in the final. Ince did not play in the away first-leg as Inter lost 1–0 but he returned to the line-up for the home match which the Italians won 1–0 thanks to a goal from Iván Zamorano. Schalke won 4–1 in the resulting penalty shoot-out.

Ince was offered a new, improved contract by club president Massimo Moratti, despite having two and a half years left on his current contract. Due to family reasons he was unable to accept the contract and returned to England with Liverpool.

===Liverpool===
In July 1997, Ince returned to England, joining Manchester United&#x27;s rivals Liverpool. His new club&#x27;s fans were divided over his links to United. In his first season at Anfield, he equalised in a 1–1 Merseyside Derby draw at home to Everton on 23 February 1998, and on 6 May he scored twice in a 4–0 win over newly crowned league champions Arsenal to secure third place. He equalised in a 2–2 comeback draw against United, who nonetheless won the treble.

According to Graeme Le Saux&#x27;s autobiography, Ince&#x27;s homophobic taunting and Le Saux&#x27;s reaction during a 1997 match between Liverpool and Chelsea resulted in a long-running coolness between the two players. Ince won no honours in his two seasons with Liverpool, and remarked on his teammates &quot;I just felt they were good players, but just wanted to go out all the time, and I just thought that wasn&#x27;t the way. I thought they needed that professionalism on the pitch&quot;; these players were dubbed the &quot;Spice Boys&quot; by the tabloid media for their off-field issues. He fell out with Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier in the summer of 1999, when he attempted to sign Marc-Vivien Foé without consulting him.

===Middlesbrough===
Houllier put Ince on the transfer list and the 31-year-old signed for Middlesbrough for £1 million in July 1999. He was signed by his former Manchester United midfield partner Bryan Robson.

Ince received 11, 9 and 10 yellow cards in his three respective seasons. On 22 October 2001, in a 2–0 home win over rivals Sunderland, he was sent off for putting his hands to Niall Quinn&#x27;s face. The following 10 March, he scored in a 3–0 victory against Everton at the Riverside Stadium to put Boro into the semifinals of the FA Cup, but he missed the defeat to Arsenal in that round due to suspension.

In July 2002, Ince left Boro after turning down a two-year contract extension, citing the long commute from his home in the northwest. He played 106 games for Boro, scoring nine goals.

===Wolverhampton Wanderers===
In August 2002, Ince signed a one-year contract with Football League First Division side Wolverhampton Wanderers, who had just signed his former Manchester United teammate Denis Irwin. In his first season outside top-flight football, he helped the team to promotion via a 3–0 win over Sheffield United in the play-off final, assisting the second goal by Nathan Blake.

Ince and Irwin signed new one-year contracts to remain with Wolves for the 2003–04 FA Premier League season. The team finished bottom and he was sent off in the last game of the season, a 2–0 loss to Tottenham at Molineux.

With over 100 appearances to his name, Ince signed a new contract in June 2005. Through thigh problems, he missed four months between August and December.

In April 2006, Ince announced that he wanted to continue playing for Wolves for a further season after speaking with his friend Teddy Sheringham. However, following Ince&#x27;s failure to get the manager&#x27;s job at Wolves in July 2006 on Hoddle&#x27;s resignation, the newly appointed manager, Mick McCarthy, decided not to offer Ince a new contract. Throughout his time with the club, Ince declared his intention to return, at some point in the future, as manager of Wolves.

==International career==
Ince made his debut for the full England team on 9 September 1992 in a friendly match against Spain in Santander, losing 1–0. Ince made history during the tour of the US when, on his seventh cap against the host nation on 6 June 1993, he became England&#x27;s first black captain in the absence of David Platt and Tony Adams. England lost 2–0.

Ince&#x27;s only international goals came on his 12th appearance. These were two in a 7–1 win away to San Marino in the final game of the unsuccessful 1994 FIFA World Cup qualification, on 17 November 1993. During Euro 96 Ince was a member of Terry Venables&#x27; England team as the midfield ball winner and got the label of &quot;Gazza&#x27;s minder&quot;, whose job was to create room for Paul Gascoigne to exploit with his natural ball skills. Though the first group game ended in a disappointing 1–1 draw at Wembley against Switzerland, England went on to defeat Scotland 2–0 and then met the Netherlands and put on a display subsequently heralded as &quot;the greatest in generations&quot; and &quot;the high point of the tournament for England&quot;. Ince was fouled for a penalty which gave England the lead and helped them towards a 4–1 win; he also picked up a yellow card which rendered him unavailable for the quarter-final against Spain, so David Platt replaced him in a match England won in a penalty shoot-out.

Venables put Ince back in the side for the semifinal against Germany, replacing the suspended Gary Neville as England switched systems to a back three, accommodating Ince in central midfield with Paul Gascoigne and David Platt. Ince was part of an England team that played well but the match rarely spent much time as one-way traffic in either direction, and it finished a 1–1 draw. England lost the penalty shoot-out when Gareth Southgate missed the sixth England penalty. Ince, along with fellow midfielders Steve McManaman and Darren Anderton and captain Tony Adams, received criticism for not taking a penalty before Southgate, and Ince also sat with his back to the action for the whole time.

Ince, in an incident reminiscent of Terry Butcher seven years earlier, started a crucial 1998 FIFA World Cup qualifier away to the Italy on 11 October 1997 with a white England shirt and ended it with a red one after his own blood soaked the shirt following a deep cut to his head. The game ended goalless and England had qualified. He was selected in the England squad for the finals in France. England got through the group but succumbed in the second round to Argentina, again after a penalty shoot-out. This time Ince did take a penalty but saw it saved.

Ince was sent off in a 2–1 loss against Sweden in England&#x27;s first qualifying match for Euro 2000 on 5 September 1998. In his absence, manager Kevin Keegan chose David Batty in central midfield. When Batty himself was sent off against Poland, Ince returned for the playoff against Scotland.

In a warm up match for Euro 2000 against Malta, Ince came on as a substitute and won his 50th cap, and was subsequently named in the 22-man squad for the tournament. He duly played in all three of England&#x27;s group games of the tournament – winning a penalty against Romania in the last game – but England lost two of three matches and were eliminated. He publicly said that he would not follow Alan Shearer into international retirement, given that he did not want to end his England career on a low note.

==Style of play==
A tenacious, athletic, and hard-working player, Ince was known for his tireless running and ability to provide defensive support to his team in midfield.

==Managerial career==
===Swindon Town (player-coach)===
Ince signed a one-year contract with Swindon Town as a player/coach on 31 August 2006. Swindon beat the likes of Birmingham City and West Bromwich Albion for his signature. A key factor in the transfer was Ince&#x27;s long standing friendship with Town manager Dennis Wise, who had played alongside him in the England team during the 1990s. He made his first start for Swindon in his second game, the 2–1 victory over MK Dons on 12 September, winning a penalty. Having played one more game, he ended his contract by mutual consent on 6 October, citing long travel times from his home in Chester. He said he would remain for his coaching badges.

===Macclesfield Town===
On 23 October 2006, Ince was confirmed as the new player-manager of Macclesfield Town in succession to Brian Horton. However, he was ineligible to play for the Silkmen until January when the transfer window opened, as Swindon Town still held his registration. He joined Macclesfield with the club bottom of League Two, seven points off their nearest rivals. He then revived confidence and after a 3–0 win against Chester they managed to climb off the bottom of the table. They subsequently avoided relegation, albeit on the last day of the season. On 4 January 2007 Ince was named as League Two Manager of the Month for December. Ince retired as a player while at Macclesfield, where he only made one league appearance, as an 85th-minute substitute for Alan Navarro in a 1–1 home draw with Notts County on 5 May that saved the team from relegation.

===Milton Keynes Dons===
Ince was unveiled as the new Milton Keynes Dons manager along with his assistant Ray Mathias and fitness coach Duncan Russell on 25 June 2007. The Dons reached the top of their Division in September 2007 and other clubs began to take a serious interest. In October and November 2007, he denied rumours that he was being linked with managerless Premier League teams Wigan Athletic, Derby County and Championship team Norwich City.

Ince was named as League Two Manager of the Month in October and December 2007, and again in April 2008.

Ince&#x27;s first silverware as manager came in the Football League Trophy final at Wembley on 30 March 2008, with MK Dons defeating Grimsby Town 2–0. He then secured the Dons&#x27; return to League One on 19 April after they beat Stockport County 3–2. A week later, the Dons became League Two champions after they beat Bradford City 2–1.

===Blackburn Rovers===
In the close-season it was speculated that Ince had been contacted by Blackburn Rovers in their search to appoint a new manager, something that Ince himself denied. However, the BBC reported that Ince would be named as Blackburn manager by the end of the week of 19 June. He was appointed on 22 June and became the first black British manager in England&#x27;s top division. On the first day of the 2008–09 FA Premier League season, Blackburn won 3–2 against Everton at Goodison Park on 16 August. Ince&#x27;s 2008 summer signings included England international goalkeeper Paul Robinson, Danny Simpson (Loan), Vince Grella, Carlos Villanueva (Loan), Robbie Fowler, Mark Bunn and Keith Andrews, spending over £10 million on Robinson, Grella and Andrews.

After winning just three games in 17, Ince was sacked on 16 December 2008 after just six months in charge. He had been with Blackburn only 177 days, one of the shortest reigns of a Premier League manager. Blackburn fans had been demanding his removal following a 5–3 loss to Manchester United at Old Trafford in the League Cup on 3 December. At the game, the crowd could be heard chanting &quot;You don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing&quot; and &quot;We want Incey out&quot; as well as singing the name of their former manager Graeme Souness.

===Return to Milton Keynes Dons===
On 3 July 2009, Ince signed again for Milton Keynes Dons on a two-year deal. During Ince&#x27;s second spell the Dons were less successful, finishing in 13th place in League One. On 16 April 2010, he announced that he would leave the job a year early, at the end of the 2009–10 season.

===Notts County===
Ince returned to management on 28 October 2010, signing a three-year deal with Notts County. On 3 April 2011 he left the club by mutual consent after a run of five successive defeats left them in 19th, two points above the relegation zone.

===Blackpool===
On 18 February 2013, Blackpool appointed Ince as manager on a one-year rolling contract. He had been watching the team, for which his son Tom played, in person for over a year. Ince took charge of his first match as Blackpool manager on 20 February 2013, a 2–0 defeat against Leeds United at Elland Road. He earned his first win on 9 March 2013, a 2–1 victory against Watford at Vicarage Road.

Under Ince, Blackpool made their best-ever start to a league season. Their victory at AFC Bournemouth on 14 September 2013 gave them 16 points out of a possible 18, with five wins and a draw in their first six games. Following the game at Bournemouth, Ince was given a five-match stadium ban by The Football Association for his conduct towards a match official in the tunnel after the game. The FA concluded that his behaviour had constituted violent conduct. He was also fined £4,000. Ince left Blackpool on 21 January 2014, after less than a year in charge, becoming their fourth-shortest-serving manager in their history (40 league games). Under his management, Blackpool won 12 out of 42 games and had not won since 30 November 2013.

=== Reading ===
On 19 February 2022, Ince and Michael Gilkes were announced as interim managers of Championship side Reading. On his debut three days later, the team won 2–1 at home to Birmingham City. Despite losing 3–0 to Hull City on 23 April, Ince guided Reading to safety with two games left to play, ensuring Championship football for the club in the 2022–23 season. In May 2022, Ince was given the manager&#x27;s job on a permanent basis along with assistant Alex Rae who was also given a permanent role.

On 11 April 2023, Ince was sacked by Reading. At the time Reading were in 22nd in the Championship and had not won in their previous eight games.

==Personal life==
Ince&#x27;s son, Tom, has played for the England national under-17 football team and for Ince&#x27;s former club Liverpool. On 1 November 2010, Ince put through a two-month loan deal to bring Tom to Notts County and on 3 August 2011 Tom signed a two-year contract with Blackpool. The two were reunited in February 2022 when Ince became interim manager of Reading.

Ince is the uncle of singer Rochelle Humes and cousin to footballer Rohan Ince and Trinidadian goalkeeper Clayton Ince.

<text>The Toyota NZ engine family is a straight-4 piston engine series. The NZ series uses aluminium open deck engine blocks and DOHC cylinder heads. It also uses sequential multi-point fuel injection, and has 4 valves per cylinder with VVT-i.

The engines are produced by Toyota&#x27;s Kamigo Plant in Toyota, Aichi, Japan; by Siam Toyota Manufacturing in Chonburi, Thailand (1NZ-FE for Yaris and Vios); and by Indus Motor Company in Karachi, Pakistan (2NZ-FE for Corolla).

From the second half of 2003, the valve train mechanism of the Japanese market 1NZ-FE engine was changed from a direct acting type to a indirect type with roller rocker arms and hydraulic lash adjuster (HLA). The post-2006 1NZ-FE Turbo and LPG-hybrid 1NZ-FXP engines are also using this valve train mechanism.

==1NZ-FXE==


The 1NZ-FXE is a hybrid version. Bore and stroke is . It features forged steel connecting rods and an aluminum intake manifold. The engine has a high physical compression ratio of 13.0:1, but the closing of the inlet valve is delayed, for an effective compression ratio of 9.5:1. The net result is that the engine has a greater effective expansion than compression—making it a simulated Atkinson cycle, rather than a conventional Otto cycle.

The reduction in cylinder charge means reduced torque and power output, but efficiency is increased. This combination makes the 1NZ-FXE suitable for use with the Hybrid Synergy Drive, where peak torque and power demands can be met by the electric motor and battery. Originally, the engine produces at 4000 rpm with of torque at 4000 rpm. In the 2000 update, the engine output was increased to at 4500 rpm with of torque at 4200 rpm. The power output was increased again to at 5000 rpm for the second generation Prius.
Peak thermal efficiency is about 37%. 

In 2011, upon the arrival of the Prius c/Aqua and the XP130 Yaris Hybrid, an improved version was introduced. Without any belt-driven accessories (equipped with an electric water pump), implementation of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system and a physical compression ratio of 13.4:1. The new version delivers an output of at 4800 rpm with of torque at 3600–4400 rpm.

The 1NZ-FXE Hybrid Synergy Drive in the Toyota Prius has won several International Engine of the Year awards:

*Best Eco-friendly 2000
*Best Eco-friendly 2001
*Best Fuel Economy 2005
*Best 1.4-litre to 1.8-litre 2005
*Best Fuel Economy 2006
*Best 1.4-litre to 1.8-litre 2006

This engine was discontinued for international markets in 2020 and was replaced by the M15A-FXE engine. However, as of January 2025, the 1NZ-FXE engine is still available in Japan.

Transmissions (eCVT): P110 (1997–2000), P111 (2000–2003), P112 (2003–2009) and P510 (2011–present)

==1NZ-FXP==
The 1NZ-FXP is a hybrid version. Bore and stroke is . This engine is based on the third generation 1NZ-FXE engine but converted to run on liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) fuel and using the roller rockers arms valve train mechanism like the updated 1NZ-FE engine. The engine has a high physical compression ratio of 13.0:1, but the closing of the inlet valve is delayed, for an effective compression ratio of 9.5:1. The net result is that the engine has a greater effective expansion than compression—making it a simulated Atkinson cycle, rather than a conventional Otto cycle.

The reduction in cylinder charge means reduced torque and power output, but efficiency is increased. This combination makes the 1NZ-FXP suitable for use with the Hybrid Synergy Drive, where peak torque and power demands can be met by the electric motor, battery and LPG-hybrid system. Output is at 4800 rpm with of torque at 2800–4400 rpm. 
Peak thermal efficiency is about 37%. This engine is mated to P510 eCVT transmission, same as the third generation 1NZ-FXE engine.

Application:
*Toyota JPN Taxi/Comfort Hybrid NTP10 (2017–present)

==1NZ-FE==

The 1NZ-FE is a conventional Otto-cycle variant of the 1NZ-FXE with VVT-i on the intake camshaft. The engine block is found in many Toyota models assembled in Japan and Asian countries. It retains the same bore and stroke, but the compression ratio is lowered to 10.5:1. Output is at 6000 rpm with of torque at 4200–4800 rpm. This engine was introduced to replace 5A-FE and 5E-FE 1.5 L engines.

There was a compressed natural gas (CNG) version of 1NZ-FE engine called 1NZ-FNE produced from April 2003, exclusively for the first generation Probox van (NCP52V) until its discontinuation in August 2014. It has 12.0:1 compression ratio, output is at 6000 rpm with of torque at 4000 rpm.

A new version of 1NZ-FE with roller rocker arms with HLA valve train mechanism and EGR system was introduced exclusively for the Japanese market in September 2003, fitted first in the front-wheel drive model of XP80 Sienta. The new valve train mechanism reduced the valves angle from 33⁰ to 21⁰. This revised engine can be identified by the use of a different plastic engine cover. Another update was occurred in 2012, the compression ratio was increased to 11.0:1. The older version was still in use for selected Japanese market Toyota cars up until 2014. The 4-speed automatic transmission was also replaced by CVT, designed for this reworked engine. The revised engine was also offered in limited markets such as in Hong Kong, Macau and New Zealand.

The 1NZ-FE engine was discontinued earlier in 2005 in Europe without a direct replacement. For emerging markets, the Dual VVT-i 2NR-FE engine was introduced as replacement in 2016. In the first half of 2020, the 1NZ-FE engine was replaced by M15A-FXS engine in Australia and New Zealand. As of January 2025, this engine is still in use for the Japanese market.

==1NZ-FE Turbo==

The 1NZ-FE Turbo (unofficially called 1NZ-FTE or 1NZ-FET) is a with an air-to-air intercooler turbocharged conventional Otto-cycle variant of the 1NZ-FE with VVT-i, combined with a IHI RHF4 turbocharger, providing of boost pressure. This engine was not created in-house by Toyota, but converted with bolt-on turbocharger kits developed by Toyota Racing Development (TRD). The engine block is the same as the naturally aspirated 1NZ-FE engine, found in many Toyota models. It retains the same 10.5:1 compression ratio as the naturally aspirated sibling. Output is at 6000 rpm with of torque at 4000–4800 rpm. 

In Japan, this unique engine was available through modified Toyota cars (tuned by TRD, Modellista (ja) or Gazoo Racing) and sold officially as complete car at Toyota Netz Store dealerships. The turbocharger kits is also available for sale at selected Toyota Netz Store dealerships or TRD official stores. This turbocharger kits was introduced first in May 2003, originally for the NCP13 Vitz RS. Later in January 2004, TRD launched &quot;TRD Turbo Tuning Plan&quot;, a turbocharger conversion program for NCP31 bB, XP61 ist and NCP13 Vitz RS owners. The fully converted bB and ist with turbocharger and additional TRD kits were also offered at the selected Netz Store dealerships. The turbocharger conversion program was terminated in 2007 with the discontinuation of XP60 ist.

In August 2007, Modellista released Vitz RS TRD Turbo M, based on the NCP91 Vitz RS with the updated 1NZ-FE engine. TRD released a slightly different 1NZ-FE Turbo engine exclusively for NZE141 Corolla Axio/Fielder GT TRD Turbo in October 2009 and March 2010.
This engine is commonly combined with C56 5-speed manual transmission, except for Corolla Axio/Fielder GT which had C51 transmission. The U340E 4-speed automatic transmission was only available for the TRD fully converted bB and ist complete cars or from several converted Vitz RS with automatic transmission owned by costumers.

== 2NZ-FE==

The 2NZ-FE is a version. Bore and stroke is , with a compression ratio of 10.5:1. Output is at 6000 rpm with of torque at 4400 rpm. Visually, this engine is identical to the 1NZ-FE, but can be identified by the 2NZ-FE mark on the intake manifold. 

For specific regions with leaded petrol, the 2NZ-FE was not equipped with VVT-i. This version produces at 6000 rpm with of torque at 4400 rpm.

In 2000, it won the International Engine of the Year award in the 1-litre to 1.4-litre category.

This engine is the successor of 2E and 4E-FE 1.3 L engines. In China, it replaced the 2SZ-FE engine, together with the introduction of XP90 Vios/Yaris in 2008.

The opposite case happened in Europe, like the 1.5 L 1NZ-FE engine, the 2NZ-FE engine was discontinued earlier in 2005, but succeeded by 2SZ-FE engine for the XP90 Yaris. In 2013, the exlusive Dual VVT-i 4NR-FE (for FAW Toyota) and 6NR-FE (for GAC Toyota) 1.3 L engines were introduced as the replacement for Chinese market XP150 Vios/Yaris. Later in 2016, the global version of those engines, called 1NR-FE, was introduced as the successor of 2NZ-FE engine for emerging markets XP150 Vios/Yaris. The last use of 2NZ-FE engine was in Australasia and Pakistan, where it was discontinued in the first half of 2020.

== Great Wall Motor version==
In May 2008, Chinese automobile manufacturer Great Wall Motor (GWM) introduced 1.3 and 1.5 L engines codenamed GW4G13 and GW4G15. Despite the similar codes, they have nothing to do with 4G13 and 4G15 engines from the Mitsubishi Orion engine family, but instead derived from NZ design. For example, the NZ engines are using timing chain to connect the crankshaft and camshafts, while the Mitsubishi Orion engines are using the less durable timing belt. Visually, this engine looks similar like the NZ engines and mechanically also share similarities such as the same bore x stroke size, engine displacement and interchangeable parts.

No statement from GWM or Toyota regarding the confirmation if these engines are officially licensed by GWM. But according the official press release by GWM in 2009, these GW4G1x engines were independently developed by themselves. There are also no reports of Toyota taking legal action against GWM regarding the intellectual property rights of NZ engines or even their copied vehicles, such as the Deer truck (N140 Hilux) or the Coolbear hatchback (XP30 bB). Only 1.3 L 2NZ-FE and 1.5 L 1NZ-FXE engines were officially available in China. The former was fitted inside the locally built XP90 Vios sedan (FAW Toyota)/Yaris hatchback (GAC Toyota) from 2008 to 2013, while the latter was offered for the imported XW20 Prius.

The turbocharged variants of the 1.5 L engine called GW4G15T was introduced in 2011 and then followed by the higher output GW4G15B in the following year. These engines were discontinued in 2019, replaced by the cleaner GW4G15F which comply with China&#x27;s National V emission standard. Further new variants which comply with National VI emission standard codenamed GW4G15K, GW4G15M and the naturally aspirated hybrid GW4G15H are also introduced.

<text>Kiev is a Soviet and Ukrainian brand of photographic equipment including cameras manufactured by the Arsenal Factory in Kyiv, Ukraine. The camera nameplates show the name &quot;KIEV&quot;, with older cameras using (in Russian) or (in Ukrainian) in Cyrillic.

In November 2009, it was announced that the Arsenal factory would be closing after 245 years of operation.

== Kiev 35mm rangefinders ==

Arsenal produced several 35mm film rangefinders, which were clones of the pre-WWII Contax II and Contax III cameras.

Kiev rangefinders retained the same lens mount as the pre-WWII Contax rangefinders, making the lenses interchangeable between both brands. The lens mount of both cameras was sophisticated compared with other cameras of the time. The so-called &#x27;Contax/Kiev bayonet&#x27; actually consists of two bayonets – the inner bayonet, which is used exclusively for 50mm lenses, and the outer bayonet, which is used for all the other lenses. This makes adapting Kiev lenses which use internal bayonet to modern mirrorless cameras complicated compared to those that use the external bayonet. The internal bayonet lenses do not have a focus ring, because the bayonet is actually the helix. Adapters for such lenses tend to be more expensive than simple external bayonet adapters.

The number of Kiev rangefinders vastly exceeded that of the pre-war Dresden and post-war Jena and Stuttgart Contaxes. 
=== Kiev ===
After the Second World War had ended, the Soviet Union demanded new sets of Contax tools from the original toolmaker in Dresden and then ordered a fair number of trial cameras to be made with Zeiss trademarks and coated lenses from these 1946 in post-war East Germany. With this successful, everything together with German instructors were transferred to Kyiv. Missing specialists were in a few cases recruited in West Germany. Any still available parts went in the same direction. In fact, removing the front of some very early Kiev cameras, one could see that the metal was originally stamped with the Contax name, then pressed out and re-stamped as Kiev. By the early 1950 all the parts for Kiev cameras were produced in Ukraine.

The Kiev camera, like Zeiss Ikon Contax, is a full frame 35mm rangefinder camera with a long rangefinder base and combined rangefinder-viewfinder. It has a metal &quot;window blind&quot; shutter, which runs vertically. Shutter speeds range from 1/2s to 1/1250s + B.

The four digit serial numbers (first two digits represent the production year, and four additional digits represent the actual serial number) and research suggest production of fewer than 5,000 cameras annually.

=== Kiev 2 / Kiev 2A ===
The Kiev 2 was very similar to the original Kiev. The most noticeable change was a new logo. There were also some minor cosmetic changes, such as design of the balance foot. Production was increased to 15,000 cameras annually, requiring five digit serial numbers.

There were two types of Kiev 2 camera, one of them being the Kiev 2, and the other being the Kiev 2A, which was essentially the same camera, but with the flash sync. The flash sync connector is located underneath the viewfinder window.

=== Kiev 3 / Kiev 3A ===
The Kiev 3 was a copy of the Contax III officially introduced in 1952, though earlier models were built from 1948 on, based on German Contax parts. It was built until 1955, after which it was replaced by the Kiev 3A, essentially the same camera with flash synchronization. It was very similar to the Kiev 2, but it included an uncoupled selenium light meter. It likely had top plates and meter cells from Zeiss Ikon in the earliest models. The meter settings are located in the rewind knob crown.

=== Kiev 4 / Kiev 4A ===

The Kiev 4 and 4A are the most common of Kiev rangefinders. They had some minor visual modifications to be visually closer to Contax III.

The Kiev 4A was an updated model of the Kiev 2A. The camera bottom is now flat, missing the support foot. The rewind knob now includes the film speed reminder. There was also a new back/base plate. On the other hand, the Kiev 4 replaced the Kiev 3A. It included all the modifications made to the Kiev 4A, but also added a new, smaller and more sensitive light meter.

=== Kiev 4M / Kiev 4AM ===
The Kiev 4M was a modernized version of the Kiev 4. The Kiev4M is usually considered less desirable than the Kiev 4 because of their poor quality control, but are still considered to be better quality than older models. There are two versions: the Kiev 4M and the Kiev 4AM, which is the same camera, but without the light meter.

The shutter speeds are marked from 1/2s to 1/1000s + B. The camera inherited a lot of its cosmetic changes from the Kiev 5, like the self-timer level and rewind knob. It also introduced the hot shoe for flash sync. It also added a fixed takeup spool.

With the Kiev-4M, the standard lens was changed from Jupiter-8 to Helios-103. The Helios-103 is generally believed to be a very good lens, usually surpassing the Jupiter-8 in reviews.

=== Kiev TTL ===
The Kiev TTL is a next development of the Kiev rangefinder series, but was never mass-produced, remaining a prototype. It features the same rangefinder as with previous Kiev rangefinders, but has a bright, 1:1 viewfinder. The most noticeable feature is TTL metering. For this, it uses two selenium cells behind the lens. During exposure, those cells move out of the way. The meter needle is visible on the camera top and also in the viewfinder window.

=== Kiev 5 ===
There was also a Kiev 5 with a modernized upper part with integrated meter. Its design drifted far away from the Contax base other Kiev rangefinders were built on. It added a much larger viewfinder, with parallax corrected (only on some versions) frame lines. The viewfinder seems to show what 35mm lens is supposed to see with frame lines showing what 50mm lens would see. Some models even had four angle marks for 85mm lenses. It did not offer the long rangefinder base of previous Kiev rangefinders. All the Kiev 5s offered the selenium light meter. It also replaced the shutter winding knob with a level, rendering it much more user-friendly.

It offered a lens mount similar to the older Kiev rangefinders, but it removed the internal bayonet for 50mm lenses. The external bayonet stayed the same. The camera lost compatibility with all the usual 50mm lenses (Jupiter-8(M) and Jupiter-3, later introduced Helios-103 could not be mounted either) because of that. The camera first used Jupiter-8NB lens, but later came with Helios-94 out of the box.

The camera improved upon the original Kiev models in many ways; however, it never gained popularity as it cost a lot more than the original Kievs, and was sold in parallel to them, causing them to have a comparatively short lifespan. The total production numbers are estimated between 8,000 and 50,000 units, making the camera quite rare.

=== Lenses ===

Some Kiev lenses are the same as Soviet m39 lenses for Zorki/FED rangefinders, but there are some exceptions.

Orion-15 is a very rare lens in Contax/Kiev mount. Unlike the Leica screw mount version of the same lens, this one is not rangefinder coupled.

There are multiple versions of Jupiter-8 lens available in Contax/Kiev mount. The -M version of the lens has click stops on aperture ring and the -NB version uses the external bayonet – it was introduced with Kiev 5, which does not have the internal one. The usual Jupiter-8 is the same lens than in M39.

Helios-94 has the external bayonet and was available as a kit lens on Kiev 5. Not a lot of information can be found online about this lens, but it seems that it cannot be mounted on older Kiev rangefinders – the focus scale of internal bayonet prevents that.

Helios-103 is exclusively available in Contax/Kiev mount. It has the internal bayonet and was a kit lens on Kiev-4(A)M. The lens usually surpasses Jupiter-8 variants in reviews. It has greater resolution than Jupiter-8 lenses and it is also faster.

== Kiev 35mm SLRs ==
Arsenal also made a range of 35 mm SLR cameras. They are not as well known as Zenit cameras, but they are still desirable for some of the innovative features they offer.

=== Kiev Automat SLRs ===
The unique Kiev Automat SLRs used their own unique lens mount; only a handful of lenses were available in that format. All these cameras use an unusual fan-shaped shutter. They are collector&#x27;s items that were not exported.
==== Kiev 10 ====
Kiev 10 was one of the most innovative cameras produced in the Soviet Union. It was one of the first cameras that offered automatic exposure. It also featured its own lens mount, shared with its successors. The camera had a light meter, but it was a selenium one. Its accuracy declines with age.

==== Kiev 11 ====
A development of Kiev 10. Only small quantities of this camera were produced. The main difference was that the light meter was moved from the top to the side. Apparently, this was due to shiny chrome lenses reflecting the sunlight, rendering the center-positioned light meter on Kiev 10 inaccurate.

==== Kiev 15 TEE / Kiev 15 TTL ====
This camera had two names during its lifespan, but these models were identical. The main difference in this model it was added TTL (Through The Lens) metering. Those meters are accurate even nowadays.

==== Lenses ====
=== Kiev F SLRs ===
The Kiev F line, available since around 1980, constituted some of the most westernized 35mm SLRs available in the days of the Soviet Union. To satisfy the large internal demand, there was no discernible export at the time they would have found a ready market in the West. Instead, the Zenit with an external selenium meter was sold in large numbers. It was Soviet policy to export domestic surplus rather than the more desirable items of their manufacture.
==== Kiev 17 ====
Kiev 17 was the first in the F line of Kiev SLRs. It was a fully manual camera. It did not even have a light meter. It is said to be a really unreliable camera.

==== Kiev 18 ====
A rare prototype camera. There&#x27;s very little known about it.

==== Kiev 19 ====
A much better rated successor to Kiev 17. It offers stop-down TTL metering with helper LEDs in the viewfinder. It has a top shutter speed of 1/500s.

==== Kiev 20 ====
This camera model adds the aperture coupling and the self-timer to Kiev 19 design. It also reads the 1/1000s top shutter speed.

==== Kiev 19M ====
The body type is changed to molded polycarbonate, making it only Kiev SLR not made from metal. Despite its model number, it succeeds the Kiev 20. It has the same 1/500s top shutter speed as the 19, though. This is by far the most produced version of Kiev F SLRs. This model was produced long after Soviet Union fell and was also exported to other countries.

==== Lenses ====
== Kiev 35mm compact cameras ==
Kiev produced some 35mm compact cameras as well.

=== Kiev 35 ===
Kiev 35 was the prototype camera of the series. It was presented at Photokina in 1984 with the Industar-99 lens.

=== Kiev 35A ===

Kiev 35A is an actual production version of Kiev 35. It is a compact 35mm camera, with a front cover that folds down to reveal the lens. It is an exact copy of Minox 35, the only difference being that Kiev 35 is around 2mm wider. It offers electronically controlled shutter with aperture priority mode. Shutter speeds range from 4s to 1/500s. It has hot shoe flash synchronization. The film speed settings range from 22 to 700 GOST (15-30 DIN). The lens on this camera is MC Korsar 35mm f/2.8.

=== Kiev 35AM ===
This is a modernized version of Kiev 35A. Besides the cosmetic changes, shutter speeds have been reduced to range from 2s to 1/500s. It also added a self-timer.

== Kiev medium format cameras ==

Kiev medium format cameras can generally be divided into two families.
=== Hasselblad 1600F/1000F based Kiev medium format cameras ===
The Kiev brand of medium format cameras started forming, when the Arsenal factory decided to try copying the Hasselblad 1600F around 1956–57. These cameras used a screw-type lens mount similar to the original Hasselblad mount, however, there are mixed reports on compatibility between the two. Most film backs are not compatible between Kievs and Hasselblads due to different gear mechanisms. However, Kiev viewfinders are compatible with the Hasselblad 1600F and 1000F, and even current Hasselblad V-system models.

==== Salyut ====
The Salyut, like Hasselblad 1600F, was a medium format SLR with a modular design - it offered interchangeable lenses, viewfinders and film backs. Because of it being so similar to the original Hasselblad, it is sometimes jokingly called &quot;Hasselbladski&quot;. The shutter was horizontal running focal plane shutter, offering speeds from 1/2s to 1/500s + B. A rare version included a 1/1000s shutter speed. The lens it had equipped out of the box was Tessar optical formula derivate Industar-29 with semi-automatic diaphragm. The rough production numbers of this camera were around 50,000 units.

The camera was often exported with changed name. The cameras named Zenith 80, Revue 6x6, Revue 80 and Vitoflex all refer to this same camera and have the same features.

==== Salyut S ====
This camera upgraded the original Salyut with extended shutter speed range - now it offered speeds from 1/2s to 1/1000s + B. It also introduced the fully automatic diaphragm. It was equipped with a new lens, Vega-12. It can be found under multiple names as well. It can be found under names Soyuz, Zenith 80 (just like the original Salyut) and Kiev 80. The only difference between the latter and Salyut S is that some Kiev 80s came equipped with a different lens - Volna-3.

==== Kiev 88 (TTL) ====
The Kiev 88 and Kiev 88 TTL were the same cameras as the Salyut S, but with added hot shoe for flash synchronization. Those cameras were equipped with Volna-3 lenses out of the box. The difference between those two models was that Kiev 88 TTL had a TTL metering prism, where Kiev 88 had a non-metering prism. Since those cameras had interchangeable viewfinders and prisms, the real difference was only what accessories were present in the box when you bought the camera, but the cameras were the same.

==== Kiev 88CM ====
The camera is perhaps the biggest upgrade since Salyut, because it replaced the original screw-type lens mount with the Pentacon Six lens mount, expanding the options for lenses.

==== Kiev 90 ====
This camera is extremely rare (around 2000 units made). It shoots 6x4.5 negatives, in contrast to previous Kievs using 6x6 formats. It offers aperture-priority automatic, semi-automatic and manual modes of shooting. It offers interchangeable lenses, focusing screens, viewfinders and film magazines. It uses the Pentacon Six lens mount and has Volna-3 lens out of the box. The shutter speeds range from 4s to 1/1000s + B.

=== Pentacon Six based Kiev medium format cameras ===
The other family of Kiev medium format cameras are based on Pentacon Six and &quot;probably&quot; inspired by Zenit 70. Those cameras look like enlarged 35mm SLRs. They use the same breech-lock lens mount as Pentacon Six, allowing them to use all the lenses made for that system, including, but not limited to, lenses made by Meyer Optik Görlitz, Carl Zeiss Jena, Schneider Kreuznach (for the Exakta 66), Kilfitt and others in addition to lenses made by Arsenal Factory. These cameras have a simpler frame-advancement mechanism than the Pentacon Six but it is often poorly adjusted at the factory resulting in incorrect frame spacing. This problem can be fixed.

==== Kiev 6S ====
This is a 6x6 SLR which can use both 120 and 220 film. Shutter release button is located on the left of the camera. It has interchangeable viewfinders. It uses a horizontally running focal plane shutter with speeds ranging from 1/2s to 1/1000s + B. By default it was delivered with Vega-12 lens. There are export versions which instead of КИЕВ on the nameplate say KIEV, the lens as well changes from Вега to Vega. It came with either a waist-level finder which lets the user compose the photo while looking into the camera, but comes with the disadvantage of the image being reversed left-to-right or the option of a non-metered pentaprism finder. 
==== Kiev 6S TTL ====
Almost the same camera as the original Kiev 6S, but had a different front plate - the Kiev logo is now written in chrome on black background. It offered a CdS TTL metering prism out of the box.

==== Kiev 60 TTL ====

The current Kiev 60 has a more conventional right-handed shutter release, but does not take 220 film. Otherwise, it is a mechanically similar camera as the Kiev 6S but it is the only Pentacon Six based model that can be modified with mirror lock up. Compared to the 6S, using a flash is also much easier because on the left side of the camera there are threads to which you screw in a cold shoe adapter and that makes it so you do not have to handhold a flash as with the 6S.

=== Attractions and problems of Kiev medium format cameras ===

The low price of the Kiev medium format cameras has attracted many amateur photographers wishing to enter the medium format camera market on a budget. Some have reported that the prices of a Kiev Hasselblad-type camera setup with other Russian or Ukrainian components, such as lenses, viewfinders and film magazines, can be just a fraction of the price of a similar Hasselblad setup.

On the other hand, prices of Pentacon Six cameras are comparable to prices of its Ukrainian counterparts. One of the reasons for the lasting demand for these cameras is the price of the lenses that can be used on them. Despite the cheap price (compared to Pentacon Six mount lenses from other manufacturers) the Kiev lenses are optically excellent, with many of the lenses being based on Carl Zeiss Jena designs.

Historically, the Arsenal plant is reported to have generally poor quality control and some buyers have reported receiving cameras with small cosmetic or functional defects. Many of the less favorable reviews come from people comparing the camera directly to the more expensive Hasselblad models. The quality control seems to have fluctuated throughout different years of production though, and thus varies from camera to camera. It is important to note that Hasselblad-like Kiev cameras are based on camera designs even Hasselblad gave up on. Having poor quality control only made things worse.

For this reason, a number of third party distributors have appeared offering Kiev cameras in improved, quality controlled forms. However, some have taken advantage of the Arsenal plant&#x27;s variable quality to add value through varying levels of third-party rebuilding, modification, and testing of the Arsenal-supplied cameras.

The cameras, however, still have a number of quirks that no simple servicing will remove. The most notable quirk is that the shutter speed on some of the original Hasselblad-like Kiev cameras should &quot;only&quot; be changed after cocking the shutter (spring-loading the shutter mechanism and advancing the film). Changing the shutter speed on an un-cocked camera will damage the timing mechanism. This is not a problem with the Pentacon Six-based Kiev and Kiev 88CM variants. There are also mixed reports that the shutter speed dial should be turned only clockwise, never counter-clockwise. This is certainly known to be an issue with some cameras modified by Hartblei to add a mirror lock-up (MLU) feature. Other cameras may or may not have this problem, so special care is advised.

=== Common modifications of Kiev medium format cameras ===

The vendors that sell Kiev cameras outside of the former Soviet Union often make their own modifications to the cheap and basic cameras coming from the factory.

Mirror lock-up is a feature that can be added to these cameras. This removes the small amount of motion blur that can be caused by the mirror hitting the top of the mirror box just before the shutter opens, however, other sources of motion-blur still remain. This is most useful when the subject is greatly magnified (when using long or telephoto lens) or with macro photography. Some of these cameras have a really strong mirror slap, creating motion blur even when not shooting handheld, so MLU is a really useful feature if you tend to use the slower shutter speeds. Another option is the addition of a mirror rebound spring, it pushes on the mirror at the end of its travel, lessening its impact and completely preventing it from rebounding and striking again.

The Pentacon Six-based Kievs are sometimes modified to shoot with a 6x4.5 frame size, often called Kiev 645 or similar, yielding more pictures per roll of film in a &quot;print-friendly&quot; rectangular format versus the original camera&#x27;s square 6x6 format. But since the film feeds sideways, the 6x4.5 variant produces photos in the &quot;portrait&quot; aspect, as opposed to the &quot;landscape&quot; aspect seen in most other cameras. On the other hand, the Hasselblad-based Kievs can shoot the 6x4.5 frame size by simply using a different film back. The 6x4.5 film back is interchangeable with 6x6 backs on others, for example instant film backs, while the Pentacon Six-based Kiev frame size modifications are permanent.

The original Pentacon Six lens mount on the Kiev 88CM accepts all the lenses from Arsenal, but has trouble accepting some other lenses, for example Carl Zeiss Jena Sonnars for Pentacon Six. It is, however, possible to overcome this issue by third party modifications that allow Kiev 88CM to accept all the lenses made for Pentacon Six lens mount. Kievs cameras utilizing Hasselblad-like screw mount can be modified to Pentacon Six lens mount, which is more desirable because of the greater amount on lenses available. Since the register distance of the new mount is shorter than the original one, the mount is located inside the camera body and allows to use all existing screw-mount lenses with an adapter - this is desirable, if we already own screw-mount lenses but want to modify the lens mount to extend the lens options. In that case, we don&#x27;t have to buy all the same lenses with a different mount.

=== Lenses ===

Lenses for Kiev medium format cameras come in two different lens mounts - mount B and mount V (be careful, in Cyrillic В actually represents V with Б being B as we know it). Mount B represents the Pentacon Six mount lenses and V represents Salyut screw-mount. Most of the lenses were made in both mounts, but some are exclusive to just one of them - refer to the table above.

In the 1990s, the lenses were all renamed to Arsat, making harder to distinguish them from one another, but optically, they are one of the lenses listed above. When the lenses were renamed, mount designations were changed. Pentacon Six mount lenses were renamed to Arsat C where screw-mount lenses kept the letter B.

Among the best regarded is the Zodiak-8 fisheye lens. This lens is reputedly quite good mechanically and excellent optically, which is stunning since one would have to spend many thousands of dollars to get a non-Ukrainian equivalent lens of this type.

Shift and Tilt-Shift lenses made by third-parties, based on the 45mm and 65mm optics are also available. These lenses allow photographers to take advantage of the Scheimpflug principle for achieving greater apparent depth of field without adjusting the aperture, and gain other controls similar to those found on view cameras.

=== Use in space ===
Even if it isn&#x27;t widely publicized, the Kiev 6S did go to space in a modified variant called the &quot;KIEV-C SKD&quot;, according to some information around 33 sets were produced. This camera was used on the Zond 6 and Zond 7 spacecrafts, the Zond 6 crash landed but Zond 7 managed to take photos of the earth and moon. The camera was much wider and heavier than the regular variant and had a motorized film wind mechanism, it also came with a remote shutter release. Shutter speeds remained the same and the 3 lenses made for it were based on regular models and greatly modified for use in space with different coatings and specifications. the 90/2.8 Vega 12B turned into the Vega 12-C which came in a f/2.8 and f/4 variant that uses 11 aperture blades instead of the regular 6, it also has special yellow coatings but what their purpose is remains undocumented. The Tair-33 turned into the Tair-33-S and remained 5.6/300, according to some information, there was also a version for &quot;unmanned shooting&quot; - the lens did not have a focusing ring. The 65/3.5 Mir-3 also saw a space variant called the Mir-3-S, but not much is known about it.

<text>The 1976 Tangshan earthquake () was a 7.6 earthquake that hit the region around Tangshan, Hebei, China, at 3:42 a.m. on 28 July 1976. The maximum intensity of the earthquake was XI (&quot;Extreme&quot;) on the Mercalli scale. In minutes, 85 percent of the buildings in Tangshan collapsed or were rendered unusable, all services failed, and most of the highway and railway bridges collapsed or were seriously damaged. The official count stated 242,469 deaths, while historians accepted at least 300,000 died, making it the deadliest earthquake in recorded history and one of the worst disasters in China by death toll.

== The earthquakes ==
The Tangshan earthquake was composed of two main shocks. The first struck at 3:42:55 in the morning (local time), approximately under the southern part of Tangshan. The was initially estimated at 8.1, subsequently recalculated to be 7.6 on the standard scale. However, that scale measures only the &quot;total&quot; energy released by an earthquake, and earthquakes vary in how much of that energy is converted to seismic shaking. The Tangshan quake, being relatively shallow, converted much of its energy to surface shaking, and on the (surface magnitude) scale it also measured 7.6. (7.8 on the Chinese surface magnitude scale.) This &quot;occurred on a near-vertical right-lateral strike-slip fault, striking N40°E&quot;, the block on the southeast side sliding about to the southwest. This resulted from tectonic compression on a nearly west–east axis. Surface rupturing occurred in five &quot;en echelon&quot; segments extending through the center of Tangshan.

The second main shock, with a magnitude 7.0 , or 7.4 , struck that afternoon at 18:45:36 near Luanxian, about to the east-northeast (&quot;B&quot; on the intensity map in the next section), just south of the northeastern end of the Tangshan fault. This occurred in a zone of north-northwest striking conjugate faults that cut across the north end of the Tangshan fault. The left-lateral motion here, along with the right-lateral motion on the Tangshan fault, suggests that as the crustal blocks to the west and east are compressed together the block between these two earthquakes is being squeezed out to the south.

A long sequence of aftershocks followed, with twelve of magnitude 6 or greater. The first of these struck just three and a half hours after the initial shock, at 7:17, at the southern end of Tangshan fault, near Ninghe (&quot;C&quot; on the map in the section below), with a magnitude of 6.2 . Another significant aftershock () occurred in November near Ninghe. Most aftershocks occurred between these end points, in a zone long and about wide. Many buildings were further damaged by the aftershocks.

The aftershock zone remains seismically active in the twenty-first century. Earthquakes measuring 4.5 to 4.7 occurred in 2012, 2016, and 2019. On 12 July 2020, a 5.1 strike-slip earthquake struck the northern part of the Tangshan Fault. It produced its own sequence of aftershocks that ended on 17 July 2020. The earthquake only caused minor damage to buildings in Tangshan. Its occurrence stirred a debate among scientists into whether the recent earthquakes are aftershocks of the 1976 event or are background seismicity.

==Damage==

The damage done by an earthquake depends primarily on two factors. First, the &quot;intensity of shaking&quot;, which depends mainly on the magnitude of the earthquake rupture, the distance from the epicenter, and the nature of the local soil and topography, with soft soils (e.g., sediments and fill) more likely to amplify the intensity and duration of the shaking. Second, the &quot;design and construction of the structures&quot; being shaken, with houses built of adobe or stone, wooden houses without a well-built frame, and unreinforced masonry construction being especially vulnerable. The seismic risk had been greatly underestimated and almost all buildings and structures were designed and built without seismic considerations. As a result, Tangshan was &quot;mainly a city of unreinforced brick buildings&quot;, sitting right on top of a major fault line.

The power (magnitude) of the Tangshan earthquake is indicated by the extent of where it was felt: up to away, across most of northeastern China, and even in Mongolia and Korea. In and around Beijing, from the epicenter, the shaking reached an intensity of VI on the Chinese intensity scale (similar to the Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale), with nearly 10% of all buildings damaged, and at least 50 fatalities.

The economic loss totaled to 10 billion yuan.

=== Intensity XI and X zone ===
The rupture occurred under the southern part of the city, and propagated northeastward on a fault that runs through the middle of the city. The maximum intensity was &quot;XI&quot; (eleven) on the 12-degree Chinese scale. Nearly every building and structure in the city collapsed, wholly or partially, infrastructure was severely damaged, and essential services such as electric power, water supply, and communications were entirely knocked out.
This area of maximum damage – the meizoseismal area – was approximately long and from wide, centered roughly along the railway.

The area of intensity X shaking – where only new, one-story brick buildings were merely &quot;damaged or slightly damaged&quot;, the rest being severely damaged or worse – was long and across. In this &quot;high intensity&quot; zone (intensity X and XI, within the red contour on the map) 20 highway bridges and five railway bridges cross the Douhe River in Tangshan; only six survived with only minor damage.

=== Intensity IX and VIII zone ===
Shaking of intensity IX (or greater) occurred in a zone roughly long and — about , inner orange contour on the map — and also around the aftershocks at Luanxian and Ninghe. In this zone most buildings classified as Class III (well-built buildings of wood, masonry, or reinforced concrete) survived, but many Class II buildings (typically old wood-frame buildings lacking a well-built frame, and quite common outside of the cities) were destroyed, while a majority of Class I buildings (built of adobe or stone) were destroyed.

Further out (to the outer orange contour), and around the city of Tianjin and a few isolated patches, intensity VIII shaking mostly affected Class I buildings (more than half destroyed), bridges, and tall brick chimneys. Railway track was also subject to bending or displacement, depending on soil conditions.

=== Intensity VII zone ===
The zone of intensity VII shaking – inside the dark brown contour – marks the extent of moderate damage, where many Class I structures (of weak design or construction) were damaged but only &quot;few&quot;—between 10% and 30%—were destroyed, and only a &quot;few&quot; Class two buildings damaged. This ellipsoid zone extended about north and south of Tangshan and east and west, from about short of Beijing to short of Qinhuangdao City (which had anomalously higher shaking), and from the Sea of Bohai in the south and southwest to just north of Zunhua. The north–south shortening of this zone is attributed to buttressing by the bedrock of the Yanshin mountains.

Significant damage occurred beyond this in the VI zone, but (like in Beijing) affected less than 10% of the buildings, or occurred in small localized areas.

=== Coal mines ===
Mining coal is Tangshan&#x27;s principal industry, and when the quake struck around 10,000 miners were underground. For the most part the mine roadways (tunnels) were not seriously damaged, but with the loss of electrical power there was no illumination (aside from headlamps), no ventilation, and no working lifts. It is reported that most miners escaped within hours, but that some others took two weeks to reach the surface.

Most of the damage to the vertical shafts occurred within the first where they pass through the water-bearing alluvium. In many cases the concrete liner built to keep out the water cracked (particularly where not built properly), allowing a much greater inflow of water. Coupled with damage to the underground drainage system and lack of power to drive the pumps, many of the various mines flooded.

Some electrical power to the mines was restored in three days, and some coal production resumed within ten days. However, de-watering, overhauling of flooded electrical equipment, and rebuilding of surface buildings and structures continued for a year and a half; the pre-earthquake level of production was not reached until the end of 1977.

=== Railways ===

The Beijing–Shanhaiguan Railway (built in 1887) is a double-track Class I trunk line that runs from Beijing southeast to Tianjin and Tanggu, then turns northeast to cross the Yongdingxin River and its estuary to run to Ninghe and then Tangshan. From Tangshan it continues northeast and then east to Chengli, and then to Qinhuangdao and Shanhaiguan. This is the principal connection of Beijing, Tianjin, and Tangshan to the seaports, and to Northeast China. The Tongxian to Tuozitou (within modern-day Luan County) Railway (built in 1976) is a single-track Class I trunk line that runs east from the eastern outskirts of Beijing to where it meets the Beijing to Shanhaiguan line northeast of Tangshan (near the epicenter of the M 7.1 quake). All of this was built &quot;with no consideration for earthquake resistant design&quot;, although some &quot;earthquake resistance measures&quot; for large and medium bridges were applied following the 1975 Haicheng earthquake.

These vital arteries (and other railways and branch lines) were seriously damaged by the earthquakes, mainly in the areas of intensity IX or greater shaking. (This includes a large area around Tangshan quake, and areas around Ninghe and Luanxian following the M 6.9 and M 7.4 aftershocks.) At the time of the main quake there were 28 freight trains and seven passenger trains traveling on the Beijing–Shanhaiguan line in the affected area; seven freight trains and two passenger trains derailed due to derangement of the rails, mostly south of Tangshan where the line was built on loose alluvium, diluvium, and occasional stretches of loose sand. In many of these cases – and also similar cases northeast of Tangshan, and on the Tongxian–Tuozitou line east of Fengrun – the railway embankment slumped due to weak soils. In other cases the embankment held, but transverse compression of the rails caused them to buckle.

Railway operations were further impaired by the loss of communications (including signalling) and water supply (for the steam locomotives), in both cases due mainly to collapse of buildings and loss of electrical power. However, the most serious damage, taking the most manpower and longest time to repair, was that involving bridges. Most difficult was where soft or liquefied soil allowed the bank to slide into the river, shifting the abutments. A more frequent problem was where an approach embankment subsided, typically leaving the rails suspended from the abutment. There were numerous cases where concrete piers and abutments were damaged due to inadequate design and construction; bridges that were strengthened following the Haicheng earthquake survived with only slight damage.

It was observed that at intensity VII and above damage to the roadbed was correlated mainly with loose soil and a high water table. Conversely, bridges and rails in Tangshan City, built on dense soil with a deep water table, were largely undamaged even though subject to intensity XI shaking.

Over forty-two thousand people were mobilized to quickly effect emergency repair of the railways. The Tongxian-Tuozitou line was opened for traffic on 3 August, single track of the Beijing-Shanhaiguan line opened on 7 August, and both tracks on 10 August, albeit at restricted speeds over temporary bridges and at other places where repairs were not yet complete.

==Death toll==
===Various official data===

While the officially published death toll was 242,469 (see table on the right for a breakdown), historians determined at least 300,000 died after cross-checking the government files. 

Discrepancies identified by historians include: first, an internal Tangshan government report dated 22 September 1976 found 263,299 deaths nationally, including 191,300 in Tangshan City and 69,654 in Tangshan Prefecture. Second, the same internal report found 17,599 Tangshan people missing but the official count atypically does not mention the missing and never explain if the missing people were listed as deaths, injuries or not listed. Third, 100,000 severely injured Tangshan patients were transferred out but 12,000 of them did not return to Tangshan, some possibly died. Fourth, among the 175,797 severely injured, some died soon after and not tracked down. Fifth, deaths in army (158 disclosed) and air force (522 disclosed) facilities only went public many years later and the national deaths toll compiled before that possibly exclude military deaths. Historians add up these data to at least 300,000 deaths.
An alternative official death toll 246,465 appeared on the Tangshan Earthquake Memorial Wall, which had all their names inscribed. The were five major addition of names, in 1992, 2008, 2010 and 2017. While 246,465 never appeared on any publications authored by the China Earthquake Administration (CEA), the additional names were verified by the memorial park, which is headed by officials of the Tangshan branch of CEA.

===Early foreign estimates===

The first public release of official figures came in November 1979, three years after the earthquake. During the three year wait, many high-end foreign estimates gained media popularity.

Within days, Pararas-Carayannis, an oceanographer in charge of IOC&#x27;s International Tsunami Information Center, gave UPI an estimate of to deaths. Initially, he said his basis was the Shaanxi earthquake in 1556, which he said to have similar magnitude and similar construction standards, i.e. yaodong caves. However, there were no yaodong caves in Tangshan. Later, he said the population density and the 93% destruction rate of residential buildings in downtown Tangshan (where 730,000 people resided) justify an estimate of 655,000 to 779,000 dead.

In August 1976, Taiwan&#x27;s Military Intelligence Bureau quoted their agents in China had learnt the death toll was over , with about 900,000 injured.

On 5 January 1977, Taiwan intelligence claimed they obtained a document dated 6 August 1976, nine days after the earthquake, that found dead and 79,000 injured. The alleged document was conference materials prepared by Hebei provincial agencies for the third batch of armed police who were standing by reinforcement orders. Scholars found 655,237 to be a &quot;suspiciously accurate figure&quot; just 9 days after the earthquake.

==Political aspects==
The remarkably low death toll of the Haicheng earthquake the previous year – initially said to be fewer than 300, much later estimated at a still very modest 2,041
– had been credited to measures taken in response to an accurate and timely prediction. This was touted as demonstrating the validity of the Chinese methods of earthquake prediction (including inspiration from &quot;Mao Zedong Thought&quot;) and &quot;the superiority of our country&#x27;s socialist system!&quot;

With China in the midst of the Cultural Revolution, &quot;belief in earthquake prediction was made an element of ideological orthodoxy that distinguished the true party liners from right wing deviationists&quot;, and it was everyone&#x27;s duty to criticize those who doubted the feasibility of earthquake prediction.

As a backdrop to this, and of deep concern to the Chinese Communist Party, was a collectively recognized but unvoiced awareness that in traditional Chinese belief, natural disasters are considered disruptions in the natural order of &quot;heaven&quot; (Tian) and may signify the loss of legitimacy (the &quot;mandate of heaven&quot;) of the current government. This view was underlined by a magnitude 6.7 earthquake in southwestern China just three weeks later. On the other hand, an ongoing mass education campaign before the quake showed that the government was aware and concerned, and the prompt and massive response following the quake demonstrated the government&#x27;s competence to alleviate suffering and restore normal production, drawing on resources from across the nation. This was contrasted with the hardships faced by disaster victims (especially the poor) under previous regimes, where assistance was lacking.

Mao Zedong was already ailing at the time of the earthquake. In the event, he died only six weeks later on 9 September 1976, ushering the downfall of the Gang of Four and bringing the Cultural Revolution to an end.

== Geology ==

Tangshan lies at the northern edge of the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan Plain, an alluvial plain that stretches from Beijing to the Sea of Bohai. This plain – the northeastern corner of the great North China Plain – is where sediments eroded from the Yanshan mountains to the north have filled in the ancient Sea of Bohai, with Tangshan near where the shore was about 4,000 years ago. To the south these sediments have formed a layer of weak soils as much as thick. At Tangshan and northward these sediments are thinner where the underlying strata crops out to form isolated hills. This underlying strata is a thick —typically — layer of mainly sedimentary strata such as limestone and sandstone, with large deposits of coal. Tangshan is located particularly over a northeast oriented syncline, a fold in the sedimentary strata that has brought massive deposits of coal close enough to the surface to be mined. In this area the overlying alluvium varies in thickness from several meters to around .

Underlying all this is the ancient bedrock of different kinds of metamorphic rock (such as schist, gneiss, quartzite, granulite, etc.) that form the Eastern Block of the North China Craton. This craton (see figure) was formed approximately two billion years ago by the collision of two major crustal blocks that left a belt of uplifted mountains – the Central (China) Orogenic Belt (COB) – that crosses China approximately southwest to northeast, passing just west and north of Beijing. Just north of Zunhua another orogenic belt, the east–west trending Yanshan mountain fault-fold belt (also known as the Yanshan seismic belt) marks the northern edge of the North China Craton (and of the alluvial plain). It is also the location of over half of the destructive earthquakes in Hebei province, as under the plain several fault zones (oriented parallel to the Central Orogenic Belt) terminate against the Yanshan mountains.

Many of these faults are ancient, but have been reactivated by the force transmitted from the collision of the Indian plate against the Eurasian plate, making the Eastern Block unusually active seismically, accounting for six of the ten deadliest earthquakes in recorded history.

The Tangshan fault that ruptured 28 July runs right under the center of Tangshan City. One of three faults in the Changdong fault zone, it runs approximately east-northeast about to where it terminates against the north–south trending fault where, just to the south, the secondary M 7.1 quake occurred (&quot;B&quot; on the &#x27;shaking&#x27; map). The southern end of the Tangshan fault (it bends slightly at Tangshan) is near Ninghe, which was also the site of a M 6.2 earthquake several hours after the main shock, and an M 6.9 quake (&quot;C&quot;) the following November. The Tangshan fault is considered shallow, but corresponds with a deeper and younger fault with somewhat differing characteristics.

== Question of prediction ==
Whether the Tangshan earthquake was predicted has had considerable political as well as seismological significance.

The 1975 Haicheng earthquake (about 400 km [250 miles] northeast of Tangshan) is regarded by seismologists as the only successful prediction of a major earthquake, although no mechanism has been proposed to explain this prediction, and no successful predictions have been achieved since. The surprisingly light death toll – initial reports were of &quot;very few people killed&quot;, but later determined to be a modest 2,041—for this magnitude 7.5 quake, attributed to the precautionary measures taken following a definite short-term prediction, was proclaimed as a demonstration of the superiority of China&#x27;s socialist system, and incidentally a validation of the Chinese methodologies. However, it was later determined that the most important factor in anticipating the Haicheng earthquake was the extended series of significant foreshocks (&quot;powerful messages from nature&quot;), and the low casualty rate was due largely to the time of day, hitting in the early evening when most people were neither at work nor asleep.

Tangshan was not so fortunate. Seventeen months later the 242,419 fatalities of the similarly sized Tangshan earthquake was therefore a considerable shock politically as well as seismically. While some of this greater mortality might be attributed to the exposure of a larger population, or the time of day (Haicheng was struck in the early evening, Tangshan while most people were asleep), the principal factor appeared to be the failure to take any precautionary measures: Tangshan was entirely unprepared.

At the time, the Chinese methods of earthquake prediction mainly consisted of watching for various precursors, including foreshocks, and were celebrated for their success at Haicheng and elsewhere. Many seismologists consider the Tangshan earthquakes to have &quot;not&quot; been predicted, even &quot;famously unpredicted&quot;, and that it was not predictable due to a lack of precursory anomalous phenomena. Furthermore, an investigation 30 years later found that there was no official short-term prediction of an imminent earthquake at Haicheng, and that, though there were many unofficial predictions of an imminent quake, none of those had a scientific basis. The warnings that were made and precautions taken happened largely at the local level, based on general middle-term predictions, enhanced public awareness due to an educational campaign, and a series of foreshocks. It is significant that at Tangshan there were no perceptible foreshocks.

On the other hand, it is reported that several people at the State Seismological Bureau (SSB) wanted to warn of an impending earthquake somewhere in the region between Beijing and the Bohai Sea, and that this was discussed at several meetings. One of these was a week-long national conference on earthquake predictions and preparation that convened in Tangshan on 14 July (two weeks before the earthquake) where Wang Chengmin is said to have warned there could be a magnitude 5+ earthquake in the Tangshan—Luanxian area between 22 July and 5 August. However, in addition to the distractions of the Cultural Revolution, there was a possible disagreement within the SSB on whether the next large earthquake would be in eastern China (e.g. the Beijing area) or western China, and that in May it had been concluded that no major earthquakes would occur in the Beijing–Tangshan area. As it turned out, western China was hit by the magnitude 7.2 Songpan-Pingwu earthquake only three weeks after Tangshan, showing that those arguing for the imminence of an earthquake in Western China were not entirely wrong.

At another meeting, on 26 July, there was a purported suggestion to &quot;not&quot; issue any warning, to avoid alarming the population. The next morning, at an emergency meeting he requested with the Bureau&#x27;s leadership, Wang was reportedly told by Deputy Chief Cha Zhiyuan that &quot;We are currently very busy. We will discuss it again next week.&quot; However, Cha has disputed this, claiming that Wang said there would be no major earthquakes. Another account says Wang was directed to submit more information, then send a small group to observe the earthquake.

Some of the bureaucratic reticence to issue warnings and order precautionary measures likely resulted from too many predictions. These were often based on doubtful theories notorious for false alarms that earthquakes can be predicted on the basis of droughts, daily temperatures, variations in geomagnetism, or isolated anomalous phenomena. They were often too broad (magnitude &quot;of at least 4.0 in the area of Beijing, Tianjin, Huailai, Tangshan, Bohai, and Zhangjiakou&quot;, &quot;in a few years&quot;) to warrant large-scale societal and economic disruption. Such disruptions could be serious: a false alarm in October 1976, issued by the Shaanxi provincial government, is estimated to have disrupted the lives of 65% of the population of that province for half a year. It has also been estimated that &quot;in the fall of 1976 about 400 million of the then total population of 930 million of China spent some nights in temporary earthquake shelters.&quot; This illustrates the classic dilemma of earthquake prediction: increasing the sensitivity to the possibility of an earthquake (i.e., reducing the failure to predict) increases the number of false alarms, which often has a significant cost.

==Cultural references==
Chinese director Feng Xiaogang&#x27;s 2010 drama film &quot;Aftershock&quot; depicted how a family led their lives after the earthquake.

Footage of the incident appeared in the film &quot;Days of Fury&quot; (1979), directed by Fred Warshofsky and hosted by Vincent Price.

<doc id="1332693" wikidata="Q7830914" url="?curid=1332693" title="Toyota ZZ engine">
<text>The [[Toyota]] ZZ engine family is a straight-4 piston engine series. The ZZ series uses a die-cast aluminium engine block with thin press-fit cast iron cylinder liners, and aluminium DOHC 4-valve cylinder heads. The camshafts are chain-driven. The two 1.8 L members of the family, the 1ZZ and 2ZZ, use different bore and stroke. The former was optimised for economy, with torque emphasised in lower revolutions per minute operating range, while the latter is a &quot;square&quot; design optimised for high-RPM torque, yielding higher peak power. The ZZ family replaced the extremely popular cast-iron block &quot;4A&quot; engines.

Toyota engine names are interpreted as follows. The leading number denotes the generation, and the next one or two letters, specify the engine family. The remaining letters, following a hyphen, describe the engine&#x27;s major features. For example, the 2ZZ-GE can be decoded as being the second generation of the ZZ engine series and features a performance-oriented cylinder head with widely angled valves (G) and electronic fuel injection (E).
==1ZZ==

===1ZZ-FE===
The 1ZZ-FE is a version. Bore x stroke of . Compression ratio is 10.0:1. It uses MPFI, has VVT-i (1998-99 1ZZ engines don&#x27;t have VVT-i), and features fracture-split forged powder metal connecting rods, one-piece cast camshafts, and either a cast aluminum intake manifold or a molded plastic intake manifold.

The 1ZZ-FE was manufactured at both the Toyota Motor Manufacturing West Virginia plant in the United States and at the Shimoyama plant in Japan.

====North America====
Built in the United States at Buffalo, West Virginia, output of the North American 1ZZ-FE is between at 5,600 rpm with of torque at 4,400 rpm, and at 6,400 rpm with of torque at 4,200 rpm. Production at Cambridge, Ontario was discontinued in December 2007, while production at Buffalo, West Virginia was halted in 2008.

A factory supported bolt-on supercharger kit for the 1ZZ-FE was sold for the 2003–2004 Corolla and Matrix by Toyota Racing Development, and Pontiac Vibe by GM Performance. The supercharger gives of boost, with a and of torque increase at the wheels.

Toyota announced a voluntary recall of 2005 to 2008 Toyota Corollas and Matrixes equipped with the 1ZZ-FE engines. The issue involves the engine control module, and includes the potential for it to develop a crack on the module&#x27;s circuit board, which can result in the car not starting, the transmission shifting harshly, or the engine stalling. Additionally, General Motors announced a voluntary recall of Pontiac Vibes from years 2005 to 2008 for the same issue.

Applications:
* Toyota Corolla (E110)
* Toyota Corolla (E120) CE/LE/S/VE, Fielder, Runx (Japan), Altis (Asia)
* Toyota Corolla (E140) Axio, Fielder (Japan)
* Toyota Corolla Spacio
* Toyota Corolla Verso
* Toyota Allion
* Toyota Premio
* Toyota Vista and Vista Ardeo
* WiLL VS
* Toyota Caldina
* Toyota RAV4
* Chevrolet Prizm
* Pontiac Vibe
* Toyota Celica GT
* Toyota Matrix
* Toyota Avensis
* Toyota Opa
* Toyota Isis
* Toyota Wish
* Lotus Elise

====Japan====
Built in Japan at the Shimoyama plant in Miyoshi, Aichi, the Japanese 1ZZ-FE is similar to the one used in North America, except that it has larger (32 mm) intake valves and (27.5 mm) exhaust valves with corresponding revisions to the ports, resulting in higher power output compared to the North American 1ZZ-FE. It uses Multi-point fuel injection along with VVT-i. Toyota&#x27;s advertised power output is at 6,400 rpm and of torque at 4,400 rpm.

It has been widely circulated online that the Japan-built engine was labeled as &quot;1ZZ-FED&quot;, however no official documentation or labeling from Toyota has ever cited the &quot;FED&quot; suffix. All of the applications that used the Japan-built engine (including the ones listed below) have their stickers and emission certifications labeled as 1ZZ-FE without the &quot;D&quot; at the end. Like many other engines manufactured by Toyota, the company has felt the need to change something internal to the engine for different applications without changing the designation (e.g. the 4A-FE went through three generations of changes under the same name).

Applications:
* Toyota Celica (ZZT230, Japan Only)
* Toyota MR2 Spyder
* Toyota Wish 1.8
* WiLL VS 1.8

===1ZZ-FBE===
A special modified variation of the 1ZZ-FE that can run on E100 Ethanol.

Applications:
* Toyota Corolla (Brazil only) 

===LJ479Q===
An internal code of the 1ZZ-FE engine for SAIC-GM-Wuling cars.

Applications:
* Baojun 530
* Baojun 560
* Baojun 730/Wuling Cortez
* Wuling Rongguang truck
* Wuling Zhengcheng

===Excessive oil consumption issues===
The 1ZZ engines (particularly the 1ZZ-FE) was notoriously known for excess oil consumption, especially in earlier models from the 1990s to the 2000s. The problem stemmed from an inherent design flaw in the engine with its undersized piston rings and insufficient oil drainage holes in the pistons. Over time, this led to oil blow-by, where excessive oil would enter the combustion chamber, causing the engine to start burning oil. Owners often reported needing to add oil between changes, with some engines consuming up to a quart every 1,000 miles. This leads to shortened oil changes, significantly increasing running costs and hassle. Though later models received improvements, this issue remains a significant concern for 1ZZ engines of that era.

==2ZZ==
===2ZZ-GE===

The 2ZZ-GE is a version built in Japan, in collaboration with Yamaha Motor Corporation. Bore x stroke is . It uses Multi-point Fuel Injection, VVTL-i, and features forged steel connecting rods. Compression ratio is 11.5:1, necessitating high-octane gasoline (91 octane or above in the (R+M)/2 scale used in North America). Power output for this engine varies depending on the vehicle and tuning, with the Celica GT-S, Corolla T-Sport, Lotus Elise and Lotus Exige offering , whereas the American versions of the 2003 Matrix and Pontiac Vibe versions produce @ 7,600 rpm and @ 6800 rpm, with all later years offering anywhere from in 2004 to in 2006 due to a recurved powerband. The differing power figures from 2004 through 2006 are due to changes in dynamometer testing procedures. The Australian variant Corolla Sportivo produces at 7,600 rpm and of torque. Due to noise regulations, Toyota recalled them for a flash of the PCM to up their output to classify them in the more lenient &quot;sports car&quot; noise category. The Corolla Compressor and Lotus Exige S add a supercharger with intercooler to achieve , while the Exige 240R&#x27;s supercharger increases output to . The addition of a non-intercooled supercharger to the Elise SC produces with a considerable weight saving. The supercharged engines are not labeled as 2ZZ-GZE.

Toyota commissioned Yamaha to design the 2ZZ-GE, based on Toyota&#x27;s ZZ block, for high-RPM operation and producing a power peak near the top of the RPM range. The high-pressure die-cast aluminum alloy engine block of the 2ZZ-GE featured cylinder walls with Metal Matrix Composite (MMC), which is a reinforcement material composed of ceramic parts and fibers.

Unique to the ZZ family, the 2ZZ-GE utilizes a dual camshaft profile system (the &quot;L&quot; in VVTL-i, known by enthusiasts and engineers alike as &quot;lift&quot; similar to Honda&#x27;s VTEC) to produce the added power without an increase in displacement or forced induction. The 2ZZ-GE was the first production engine to combine cam-phasing variable valve timing with dual-profile variable valve lift in the American market. The table below lists the specifications of the two camshaft profiles.
The high-output cam profile is not activated until approximately 6,200 rpm, (lift set-points are between 6,000–6,700 rpm depending on the vehicle) and will not engage until the engine has reached at least . The Toyota PCM electronically limits RPM to about 8,200 RPM via fuel and/or spark cut. The &quot;lift&quot; engagement and the engine redline vary by application. Lotus 2ZZ-GEs are rev limited to 8,500 RPM, for example, whereas Celicas were rev limited to 7,900 to 8,200 RPM in North America, depending on the model year. The first Japanese versions were rev limited to 8,600 rpm with a peak of .

Consequently, it is impossible to &quot;over-rev&quot; the engine with the throttle alone; a downshift from a higher gear must be involved. A typical &quot;over-rev&quot; can damage the oil pump, commonly disintegrating the lobe ring, resulting in damage similar to the picture at right. The oil pump is the Achilles heel of the 2ZZ, though incidents are rare and usually occur due to fault of the driver. Even the briefest period of oil starvation is usually fatal to this engine design.

For the first few years of production, the engines were notorious for failing &quot;lift bolts&quot;. This did not damage the engine, but would hamper performance as the high output cam profile was unable to properly engage. Toyota fixed the problem in late 2002 with a redesigned bolt that was installed on later engines. Earlier engines with the problematic bolts can be fixed via a Toyota-issued TSB simply requiring the new bolt to be installed in place of the old one.

The 2004 and newer Matrix and Corolla XRS models were equipped with smog pumps and have an extra hole above each exhaust port in the engine head and manifold where air is injected to achieve complete fuel burning before the exhaust stream reaches the catalyst. All 2ZZ-GE heads from 03/03 onwards carry this modification even if the vehicle does not have the air injection system.

The 2ZZ-GE remains as one of the highest output per liter and the highest revving mass production engines ever made. It has won the International Engine of the Year category for 1.4 to 1.8-liter engines in 2002 in recognition of its incredible power output.

<text>The Main North Line (also known as the Great Northern Railway) is a major railway in New South Wales, Australia, running from Strathfield in Sydney to Armidale.

The 1980s saw the line closed progressively north of Armidale; passenger services north of Tamworth were cancelled in 1990 but were reintroduced as far as the former two years later.

The Sydney–Brisbane rail corridor now branches off the Great Northern Railway after Maitland and follows the North Coast line.

==Description of route==
The line starts as a branch off the Main Suburban line at Strathfield in Sydney. The line heads north as a quadruple track electrified line to Rhodes, crossing the John Whitton Bridge over the Parramatta River as a double track line. At West Ryde the line again expands out to four tracks through to Epping. The line is then largely double track through the northern suburbs of Sydney, crossing the Hawkesbury River Railway Bridge, before passing through the Central Coast.

At Fassifern, a former branch line to Toronto divided off in an eastwards direction until closed in 1990. The line continues north to Broadmeadow in the inner western suburbs of Newcastle. North of Broadmeadow is the junction with the Newcastle branch line, where electrification of the main line ends. However, electrification continues along the branch line to Newcastle Interchange terminus at Wickham, with the branch line beyond Wickham to the former Newcastle station having been closed and lifted from December 2014.

The line then swings westwards as four tracks; two main line and two coal roads traverse the outer suburbs of Newcastle to Maitland. The two coal roads run to the Newcastle coal lines, which serve a number of collieries along the route. Maitland is the junction of the North Coast line which continues to Brisbane and the Main North line. The line becomes double track immediately west of Maitland and heads through the Upper Hunter Valley townships of Branxton, Singleton and Muswellbrook where the double track ends.

Muswellbrook is the junction point for the former cross country line to Sandy Hollow and Gulgong. The Main North continues northwards through the Ardglen Tunnel to Werris Creek, where the Mungindi Line branches off to Moree, and a former cross country branch continues to Binnaway and ultimately Dubbo.
The line continues north, but sees limited traffic beyond Werris Creek. The line reaches the major New England towns of Tamworth and Armidale, the latter being the northernmost extent of service on the line. Until the mid-2000s freight traffic continued to the disused station at Dumaresq which is home to a now-also-disused agricultural fertilizer depot. There is now wire across the corridor at several points between Armidale and Dumaresq, after which the line is closed. A block is placed across the tracks a short distance from Dumaresq, at the 590 kilometre mark. North of Glen Innes the line, and particularly its bridges, have fallen into disrepair. In December 1991 the line was severed when the Roads &amp; Traffic Authority built a deviation of the New England Highway over the line at Bluff Rock south of Tenterfield. At Wallangarra, the line met Queensland Railways&#x27; Southern railway line.

==History==

The Great Northern Railway was the original mainline between Sydney and Brisbane. The first section of the Main North line opened in 1857 from the port of Newcastle to East Maitland as the Hunter River Railway Company&quot;&quot;&#x27;s line. At a public meeting for the company&#x27;s establishment in 1853, William Charles Wentworth envisioned the line&#x27;s extension to Scone up north and Sydney down south. The line was then extended to Victoria Street, Maitland in 1858. It was extended to Singleton in 1863, Muswellbrook in 1869, Scone in 1871 and Murrurundi in 1872.

The GNR was then extended beyond Scone to Werris Creek and West Tamworth in 1878, Armidale in 1883, and reached the Queensland border at Wallangarra in 1888. The North Coast line to Brisbane, via the North Coast was opened in stages between 1905 and 1930, but a ferry carried trains across the Clarence River until the Grafton Bridge was completed in 1932. The Newcastle rail network remained independent of the main network radiating from Sydney until 1889, when the line between Sydney and Newcastle was completed with the opening of the Hawkesbury River Railway Bridge. Thus Newcastle was connected by rail with Wallangarra before it was connected with Sydney, such was the difficulty and expense of reaching and bridging the Hawkesbury River.

The Sydney to Newcastle section, Homebush to Waratah, had difficult topography to overcome, including crossing the Hawkesbury River, traversing the Mullet Creek bank and constructing the Woy Woy Tunnel. From the south, the line was opened between Homebush and Hornsby in 1886, then extended to Hawkesbury River in 1887. From the north, the line opened between Waratah and Gosford in 1887. Progress in the construction of the last section between Hawkesbury River and Gosford occurred when the Woy Woy Tunnel opened in 1887, then Mullet Creek to Gosford in 1888 and finally Hawkesbury River to Mullet Creek in 1889 when the original Hawkesbury River Railway Bridge was built.

In 1892, the line was duplicated from Strathfield to Hornsby, and electrified in 1926 as part of the Bradfield electrification scheme. The line was further electrified to Gosford in January 1960, Wyong in April 1982 and Newcastle in June 1984. Freight trains were hauled by electric locomotives until March 1998.

==Branch lines==
Several lines branch from the Main North Line, including:
* Newcastle Branch Line from Broadmeadow to Newcastle Interchange (used to go further to old Newcastle station until it was closed in December 2014)
* Richmond Vale railway line from Hexham to Weston (closed 1987)
* South Maitland Railway from Maitland to Pelton
* Merriwa line to Sandy Hollow and on to the Sandy Hollow to Gulgong line
* Mungindi line from Werris Creek to Narrabri and Moree
* Toronto line from Fassifern to Toronto (closed 1990 and converted to cycleway)
* Belmont line from Adamstown to Belmont (closed 1991 and converted to a cycleway called &quot;The Fernleigh Track&quot;)
* Morpeth Line from East Maitland to Morpeth (closed 1953)
* Barraba line from West Tamworth to Barraba (closed 1980s)

==Services==
The line was serviced by the overnight &quot;Northern Mail&quot; until it ceased in November 1988. The &quot;Northern Tablelands Express&quot; provided a daylight service to Glen Innes, with some journeys extended to Tenterfield until truncated in October 1985 to Armidale and in February 1990 to Tamworth.

NSW TrainLink operates regional and intercity passenger services along the Main North line. A daily North Western train operates from Sydney to Werris Creek before dividing, one operating along the Main North line to Armidale, the other section operating along the North-West line to Moree. Central Coast &amp; Newcastle Line intercity passenger services operate between Sydney and Newcastle. The Hunter Line operates between Newcastle, Maitland and Scone, with a branch to Dungog on the North Coast line. Sydney Trains operates suburban passenger services in the section between Strathfield and Berowra.

The section between Strathfield and Maitland forms part of the interstate line between Sydney and Brisbane and sees intermodal freight traffic carried between the two cities. The section of line in the Hunter Valley sees intensive coal train working, with the section between Broadmeadow and Maitland one of the busiest freight lines in Australia.

==Developments==

The line was hampered by the rugged terrain and a change of gauge at Wallangarra for traffic to Queensland. The line was superseded as the principal route to Brisbane by the completion of the North Coast Line in 1930. Despite being bypassed, the line remained busy for many years afterwards, with the line instead becoming the major freight link to the wheat and wool regions of northern and north-west New South Wales.

In 1988, the newly elected Greiner State Government commissioned a report into the State Rail Authority by Booz Allen Hamilton. As a result, the line between Tenterfield and Wallangarra was closed. The last train to operate north of Tenterfield was an Australian Railway Historical Society charter on 15 January 1988 hauled by diesel locomotive 4487. The last train to operate north of Glen Innes was hauled by steam locomotive 3001 on 22 October 1989 after which the line was formally suspended from operations.

Following the &quot;Northern Tablelands Express&quot; being truncated in February 1990, the line north of Tamworth saw little use until the Xplorer service was introduced to Armidale in October 1993. The line to Glen Innes was still open in July 1992 when diesel locomotive 4499 operated a crew training service.

There have been attempts to revive freight or tourist traffic to as far as Glen Innes, although these plans have not yet succeeded.

A section of the line between Waratah and Maitland is quadruple track, with one pair being used exclusively for coal trains within the Hunter Valley coal trains and the other pair being used by passenger trains and general freight. The coal tracks from Port Waratah join the line on the eastern side of the other tracks at Scholey Street Junction and pass underneath the other tracks at Hanbury Dive just west of Maud Street, continuing to Maitland on the western side of the other tracks.

In November 1989, a fourth track was added between Eastwood and West Ryde. In the mid-1990s a loop was constructed at Cowan.

The Sandgate Flyover was constructed in 2006 to allow the two passenger/freight tracks to rise and pass over the coal tracks that branch off to Kooragang Island in order to eliminate a capacity restriction caused by the long coal trains crossing the other tracks at grade. Because of the location of the overpass relative to the branch to Kooragang Island, a short section of the line has 6 parallel tracks. The bridge carrying Sandgate Road over the lines had to modified to allow for the additional lines. Sandgate station is flanked by a pair of coal tracks on each side.

As part of the Rail Clearways Program, in August 2006 an additional platform was opened at Berowra, and in March 2009 an additional platform and passing loop was opened at Hornsby.

In 2011, the Northern Sydney Freight Corridor project commenced to improve access for freight trains. This has seen the completion of a loop at Hexham in June 2012, two loops between Gosford and Narara in February 2015, plus an underpass and loop between North Strathfield and Rhodes in June 2015. A third track between Epping and Thornleigh was completed in June 2016.

On 8 February 2024, a petition to reopen the Great Northern Railway north of Armidale to Wallangarra via Glen Innes and Tenterfield was presented to NSW Parliament by MP for Northern Tablelands Adam Marshall. Jenny Aitchison MP for Maitland and Minister for Regional Transport and Roads answered saying it required a business case.

== Engineering heritage award ==
The Great Northern Railway received a Historic Engineering Marker from Engineers Australia as part of its Engineering Heritage Recognition Program.

<doc id="1332713" wikidata="Q305520" url="?curid=1332713" title="Rock the Casbah">
<text>&quot;Rock the Casbah&quot; is a song by the English punk rock band The Clash, released in 1982 as the second single from their fifth album, &quot;Combat Rock&quot;. It reached number eight on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart in the US (their only top 10 single in that country) and, along with the track &quot;Mustapha Dance&quot;, it also reached number eight on the dance chart.

==Recording==
The music for &quot;Rock the Casbah&quot; was composed by the band&#x27;s drummer Topper Headon, based on a piano part that he had been toying with. Finding himself in the studio without his three bandmates, Headon progressively taped the drum, piano and bass parts, recording the bulk of the song&#x27;s musical instrumentation himself.

This origin makes &quot;Rock the Casbah&quot; different from the majority of Clash songs, which tended to originate with music written by the Joe Strummer–Mick Jones songwriting partnership. Upon entering the studio to hear Headon&#x27;s recording, the other Clash members were impressed with his creation, stating that they felt the instrumental track was essentially complete. From this point, relatively minor overdubs were added, such as guitars and percussion.

However, Strummer was not impressed by the page of suggested lyrics that Headon gave him. According to Clash guitar technician Digby Cleaver, they were &quot;a soppy set of lyrics about how much he missed his girlfriend&quot;. &quot;Strummer just took one look at these words and said, &#x27;How incredibly interesting!&#x27;, screwed the piece of paper into a ball and chucked it backwards over his head.&quot;

Strummer had been developing a set of lyrical ideas that he was looking to match with an appropriate tune. Before hearing Headon&#x27;s music, Strummer had already come up with the phrases &quot;rock the casbah&quot; and &quot;you&#x27;ll have to let that raga drop&quot;, as lyrical ideas that he was considering for future songs. After hearing Headon&#x27;s music, Strummer went into the studio&#x27;s bathroom and wrote lyrics to match the song&#x27;s melody.

The version of the song on &quot;Combat Rock&quot;, as well as many other Clash compilations, features an electronic sound effect beginning at the 1:52-minute point of the song. This noise is a monophonic version of the song &quot;Dixie&quot;. The sound effect source was generated by the alarm from a digital wristwatch that Mick Jones owned, and was intentionally added to the recording by Jones.

Algerian rock singer Rachid Taha believes that an early demo tape of his, which he gave to The Clash in 1981, helped inspire the original song.

==Lyrics==
Joe Strummer had been toying with the phrase &quot;rock the casbah&quot; prior to hearing Topper Headon&#x27;s musical track that would form the basis of the song. This phrase had originated during a jam session with Strummer&#x27;s violinist friend Tymon Dogg. Dogg began playing Eastern scales with his violin and Strummer started shouting &quot;rock the casbah!&quot; Not hearing Strummer properly, Dogg thought that Strummer had been shouting at him to &quot;stop, you cadger!&quot;

Further inspiration for the lyrics of &quot;Rock the Casbah&quot; originated from Strummer observing the band&#x27;s manager Bernie Rhodes moaning about The Clash&#x27;s increasing tendency to perform lengthy songs. Rhodes asked the band facetiously &quot;does everything have to be as long as this rāga?&quot; (referring to the Indian musical style known for its length and complexity). Strummer later returned to his room at the Iroquois Hotel in New York City and wrote the opening lines to the song: &quot;The King told the boogie-men &#x27;you have to let that rāga drop.&#x27;&quot;

The song gives a fabulist account of a ban on Western rock music by a Middle Eastern king. The lyrics describe the king&#x27;s efforts to enforce and justify the ban, and the populace&#x27;s protests against it by holding rock concerts in temples and squares (&quot;rocking the casbah&quot;). This culminates in the king ordering his military&#x27;s fighter jets to bomb the protestors; however, after taking off, the pilots ignore his orders and instead play rock music on their cockpit radios, joining the protest and implying the loss of the king&#x27;s power.

The events depicted in the song are similar to an actual ban on Western music, including rock music, enforced in Iran since the Iranian Revolution. Though classical music and public concerts were briefly permitted in the 1980s and 1990s, the ban was reinstated in 2005, and has remained in force ever since. Western music is still distributed in Iran through black markets, and Iranian rock music artists are forced to record in secret, under threat of arrest.

The song&#x27;s lyrics feature various Arabic, Hebrew, Turkish, and Sanskrit loan-words, such as &quot;sharif&quot;, &quot;bedouin&quot;, &quot;sheikh&quot;, &quot;kosher&quot;, &quot;rāga&quot;, &quot;muezzin&quot;, &quot;minaret&quot;, and &quot;casbah&quot;.

==Single==
The single does not contain the album version of the song. Rather, it features a remix by Mick Jones and Bob Clearmountain with a &quot;murkier&quot; sound, more pronounced guitar and piano, more prominent sound effects, and the toy synth sound of the third verse turned down.

===Single issues===

The single has several issues, all with different cover, format and B-side (see the table below).

==Music video==
The music video for &quot;Rock the Casbah&quot; was filmed in Austin, Texas by director Don Letts on 8 and 9 June 1982. It intermixes footage of the Clash (with Terry Chimes on the drums) miming a performance of the song, with a storyline depicting two characters travelling together throughout Texas. The video depicts a Muslim hitchhiker (played by actor Titos Menchaca) and a Hasidic Jewish limo driver (Dennis Razze) befriending each other on the road and skanking together through the streets to a Clash concert at Austin&#x27;s City Coliseum. Throughout the video, an armadillo appears at points. At one point they are seen eating hamburgers in front of a Burger King restaurant. At another point, the Muslim character is seen drinking a beer; Letts stated that all that imagery was &quot;about breaking taboos.&quot;

The Clash is shown miming a performance of the song in front of a pumpjack in a Texas oil field. For most of the video clip, guitarist Mick Jones&#x27;s face is obscured by a veiled camouflage hat. The reason for this is that Jones was in a bad mood during the film shoot. Jones&#x27; face remains hidden until the final 30 seconds of the clip, when Strummer pulls the hat off at the &quot;he thinks it&#x27;s not kosher!&quot; line.

Topper Headon left the band because of a drug problem before the song was released at the beginning of the band’s Combat Rock tour, and was replaced by Terry Chimes, who appears in the “Rock the Casbah” video. Headon was extensively interviewed for the &quot;Joe Strummer: The Future Is Unwritten&quot; documentary film about the late Clash frontman, which was released in 2007. Headon related his experiences during this period, how he became addicted to heroin and how there were problems before his dismissal.

==Legacy==
The song was chosen by Armed Forces Radio to be the first song broadcast on the service covering the area during Operation Desert Storm. In one of the campfire scenes late in the 2007 documentary &quot;Joe Strummer: The Future Is Unwritten&quot;, a friend states that Strummer wept when he heard that the phrase &quot;Rock the Casbah&quot; was written on an American bomb that was to be detonated on Iraq during the 1991 Gulf War.

Following the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001, the song was placed on the list of post-9/11 inappropriate titles distributed by Clear Channel. In 2006, the conservative &quot;National Review&quot; released their list of the top 50 &quot;Conservative Rock Songs&quot;, with &quot;Rock the Casbah&quot; at number 20, noting the Clear Channel list as well as frequent requests to the British Forces Broadcasting Service during the Iraq War. Cultural reviewer and political analyst Charlie Pierce commented that &quot;the notion of the Clash as spokesfolk for adventurism in the Middle East might have been enough to bring Joe Strummer back from the dead.&quot;

&quot;Vulture&quot; writer Bill Wyman in 2017 ranked the song number ten of all the band&#x27;s 139 songs, calling it &quot;one of the greatest rock singles of all time.&quot; Wyman further wrote, &quot;Like other Clash songs, this song requires some historical context&quot; about Iran, starting from the 1953 coup d&#x27;état—which overthrew the democratically elected leader Mohammad Mosaddegh—to the Islamic Revolution of 1979, which resulted in overthrowing the rule of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, king of the Imperial State of Iran, and the hostage crisis at the U.S. embassy in Tehran, rupturing their diplomatic relations—followed by Jimmy Carter, who was criticized for the way he handled the hostage crisis, losing the 1980 U.S. presidential election to Ronald Reagan.

==Cover versions==
Algerian rock singer Rachid Taha covered the song (in Algerian Arabic and the chorus in English) on his 2004 album &quot;Tékitoi&quot;. On 27 November 2005 at the Astoria, London, during the Stop the War Coalition Benefit Concert, &quot;...for the night&#x27;s grandstanding conclusion, the Clash legend Mick Jones strides on in a skinny black suit and plays probably the most exciting guitar he has delivered in years. He and the band are brilliant on Taha&#x27;s definitive take on &quot;Rock the Casbah&quot;, for which the audience goes berserk.&quot; They again played Taha&#x27;s version of the song, &quot;Rock el Casbah&quot;, in February 2006, at the France 4 TV show &quot;Taratatà.&quot; In 2007 at the Barbican, &quot;... The band were later joined by special guest Mick Jones from the Clash who performed on &quot;Rock El Casbah&quot; and then stayed on stage for the remainder of the show.&quot;

<text>Friends For All Children was an adoption assistance agency that was located in Boulder, Colorado. It operated during the Vietnam War in Operation Babylift in 1975 to bring South Vietnamese children to the United States, during the Fall of Saigon, when the Communist North Vietnamese and their Viet Cong agents invaded South Vietnam. It disbanded in the United States, in 1977, after placement of the final child on their caseload.

It still operates in South East Asia. 

== FFAC in Thailand ==
The Foundation “Friends For All Children”, otherwise known as FFAC, is a private, non-profit and non-sectarian organisation dedicated to the welfare of Thai children.

Established in 1977, FFAC was initially funded by Friends For All Children of Colorado, USA but now is independently managed by its Thai Executive Committee.

<text>The Toyota AZ engine family is a straight-4 piston engine series. The AZ series uses an aluminium engine block with cast iron cylinder liners and aluminium DOHC cylinder head. The engine series features many advanced technologies including slant-squish combustion chambers, offset cylinder and crank centers, and the VVT-i continuously variable intake valve timing system. The aluminium engine measures long, wide, and tall.

The cylinder block is an open-deck, midi-skirt die-cast aluminium type with cast-in iron liners and a die-cast aluminium lower crankcase and a stamped oil pan. The forged steel crankshaft is fully balanced with eight counterweights and supported by five main bearings. A helical gear pressed in No. 3 counterweight drives twin contra-rotating balance shafts in the shaft housing within the lower crankcase.

The dual overhead camshafts are driven by a single-stage roller chain of pitch, enabling a narrow included valve angle of 27.5°. The camshafts act on four valves per cylinder via bucket tappets. As in the recent Toyota engine practice, no clearance adjusting shim is employed. Valve diameters are for intake and for exhaust, with lift for both intake and exhaust. The four-vane VVT-i device is fitted on the intake camshaft, altering timing by 50°. The valve cover is made of magnesium to save weight.

Fuel is injected sequentially via an ultra-fine-atomization injector with twelve small injection holes, each in diameter. As in the smaller NZ engine, the new AZ adopts a plastic, built-up, and vibration-welded intake manifold integrating a large volume plenum chamber ( volume including a resonator). Exhaust manifolds are of tubular construction with integrated catalytic converters.

The AZ is the replacement for the S engine. Its successor is the AR engine.

==Excessive oil consumption==
The 2AZ-FE engine in the 2007-2009 Camry and 2006-2009 Rav4 may burn excessive oil and is involved in this lawsuit. Other engines are also affected. If this Toyota engine is burning more than of oil in , has less than , is less than 10 years old, and is located in the U.S., Toyota service will perform a free oil consumption test to determine if the engine is affected. There are approximately 1,715,200 vehicles covered by this Warranty Enhancement Program.

A similar campaign are also done in Japan by Toyota in 2014.

The &quot;2AZ&quot; line of engines have of displacement.

===2AZ-FE===
The 2AZ-FE is a version built in Japan (Kamigo Plant and by Toyota Industries Corporation), at TMMK in the USA and also built in China for select Scion xB models, and also in Australia, obtains a total displacement of with bore and stroke, with a compression ratio of 9.6:1. Output is at 5600 rpm; of torque at 4000 rpm.

Later versions of the 2AZ-FE engine were upgraded with 9.8:1 compression ratio, a slightly more aggressive intake cam profile, 6500 rpm redline, and piston oil squirters. These later versions are rated at in the Scion tC, in the RAV4, and in the Camry, Corolla XRS, Scion xB, and for the Previa/Estima/Alphard.

Some Japan-made Toyota vehicles with the 2AZ-FE engine were equipped with the K112 transmission also referred to as 7-speed Super CVT-i automatic (Seven-speed Sequential Shiftmatic) from October 2005.

However, these later 2AZ-FE models were the first to be rated under the new SAE J1349 standard. The new standard usually produces more conservative numbers, though no definitive comparison is available since the two versions were never tested by the same standard. The RAV4 uses a different timing chain cover from the Camry, they can however be interchanged.

A TRD supercharger was available for the Scion tC and 2nd generation xB until Spring 2009.

There have been complaints of this engine &quot;burning oil&quot; in North America, with the issue starting after , though mostly after . Piston ring design has been identified as a potential problem. Toyota has issued a TSB (Technical service bulletin) TSB #0094-11 in August 2011 but has not issued a recall. Alternative theories point to a head gasket problem: the 2AZ-FE aluminum block threads may wear out on the back three middle bolts (closest to firewall). Check TSB SB-0015-11.

There are several class-action lawsuits underway regarding this issue. In January 2015, Toyota North America issued extended warranty notification (ZE7) for this issue for Toyota North America vehicles only.

===2AZ-FXE===
The 2AZ-FXE is an Atkinson cycle variant of the 2AZ-FE. It has the same bore and stroke, but the intake cam and pistons are unique. It has a physical compression ratio of 12.5:1.

The longer than normal open intake valve duration leads to a reduction in cylinder charge and reduced torque and power output, but efficiency is increased. This combination makes the 2AZ-FXE suitable for use only in hybrid vehicles, where peak torque and power demands can be met by the electric motor and battery.

Maximum output when used in the Camry hybrid is at 6000 rpm with of torque at 4400 rpm.

<doc id="1332763" wikidata="Q7830817" url="?curid=1332763" title="Toyota MZ engine">
<text>The [[Toyota]] MZ engine family is a piston V6 engine series. The MZ series has an aluminium engine block and aluminium alloy DOHC cylinder heads. The cylinders are lined with cast iron, and is of a closed deck design (no open space between the bores). The engine is a 60 degree V6 design. It uses multi-port fuel injection (MFI), four valves per cylinder, a one-piece cast camshaft and a cast aluminium intake manifold. The MZ family is a lightweight V6 engine of an all-aluminium design, using lighter weight parts than the heavier duty VZ block engines in an effort to lower production costs, decrease engine weight, and decrease reciprocating weight without sacrificing reliability. Toyota sought to enhance the drivability pattern of the engine (over the 3VZ) at exactly 3000 rpm, since that was the typical engine speed for motors cruising on the highway. The result was less cylinder distortion coupled with the decreased weight of rotating assemblies, smoother operation at that engine speed, and increased engine efficiency.

This engine has been phased out in most markets, replaced by variants of the new GR series.

==1MZ-FE==

The 1MZ-FE is a dual overhead cam (DOHC) V6 engine. Bore and stroke is . Output is at 5200–5400 rpm with of torque at 4400 rpm. Horsepower ratings dropped after the Society of Automotive Engineers implemented a new power measurement system for vehicle engines, Toyota engines rated on 87 octane dropped the most, compared to the same engines used by Lexus rated on 91 octane. It has bucket tappets and was designed for good fuel economy of city and highway without an overall performance trade-off. These engines are prone to oil gelling. Another name for the issue was &quot;engine sludge&quot;. There was a class action lawsuit due to this problem. It is very important to the life of these engines that oil changes are done on a regular basis.

The 1MZ-FE was on Ward&#x27;s 10 Best Engines list for 1996.

Applications:
* 1993–2002 Toyota Camry (V6)
* 2002–2006 Toyota Camry (MCV36R) (Australian/New Zealand domestic market)
* 1993–2003 Lexus ES 300 &amp; Toyota Windom (Japanese domestic market)
* 1994–2004 Toyota Avalon &amp; 2000 Toyota Pronard (Avalon for Japanese domestic market)
* 1997-2003 Toyota Harrier (non-US markets)
* 1997–2002 Toyota Sienna
* 1997–2001 Toyota Mark II Wagon (Japanese domestic market)
* 1998–2003 Toyota Solara (V6)
* 2000–2005 Toyota Estima/Toyota Tarago/Toyota Previa

Toyota Racing Development offered a bolt-on TRD supercharger kit for the MY1997–2000 Camry, MY1998–2000 Sienna and MY1999–2000 Solara. Power output was bumped to and of torque.

The 1MZ-FE with VVT-i is used in the Avalon, Highlander, Sienna and Camry. Output is at 5800 rpm with of torque at 4400 rpm. Early versions of the VVT-i 1MZ used a dual throttle body, cast aluminum intake manifold, and EGR block off plates on the exhaust manifolds. Later versions used a drive-by-wire/electronic throttle control.

Applications:

* 1997–2001 Toyota Mark II Qualis (Japanese domestic market)

==3MZ-FE==

The 3MZ-FE is a version. Bore and stroke is . Output is with of torque in the Camry and with of torque in the Sienna and Highlander. It also features VVT-i, ETCS-i (Electronic Throttle Control System — intelligent/DBW), PA6 plastic intake, and increased throttle body diameter over the 1MZ. The 3MZ uses a new flat-type knock sensor, which is a departure from the typical resonator type knock sensor used on the previous MZs. Previous MZs had poor knock control, or perhaps oversensitivity when detecting knock, and power loss up to may be realized due to erratic ignition timing when using an octane lower than 91. The new flat-type knock sensor is a completely different design and detects more frequencies than the traditional resonator type. This provides the ECU with more accurate data. A bolt goes through the center of the knock sensor, which then mates the sensor to the block on each bank.

<text>Anarchists have traditionally been skeptical of or vehemently opposed to organized religion. Nevertheless, some anarchists have provided religious interpretations and approaches to anarchism, including the idea that the glorification of the state is a form of sinful idolatry.

== Anarchist clashes with religion ==

Anarchists &quot;are generally non-religious and are frequently anti-religious, and the standard anarchist slogan is the phrase coined by a non-anarchist, the socialist Auguste Blanqui in 1880: ‘Ni Dieu ni maître!’ (Neither God nor master!). The argument for a negative connection is that religion supports politics, the Church supports the State, opponents of political authority also oppose religious authority&quot;.

William Godwin, &quot;the author of the &quot;Enquiry Concerning Political Justice&quot; (1793), the first systematic text of libertarian politics, was a Calvinist minister who began by rejecting Christianity, and passed through deism to atheism and then what was later called agnosticism.&quot; The pioneering German individualist anarchist Max Stirner, &quot;began as a left-Hegelian, post-Feuerbachian atheist, rejecting the ‘spirit’ (Geist) of religion as well as of politics including the spook of ‘humanity’&quot;. Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, &quot;the first person to call himself an anarchist, who was well known for saying, ‘Property is theft’, also said, ‘God is evil’ and ‘God is the eternal X’&quot;.

Published posthumously in French in 1882, Mikhail Bakunin&#x27;s &quot;God and the State&quot; was one of the first anarchist treatises on religion. Bakunin became an atheist while in Italy in the 1860s. He was briefly involved with freemasonry, which influenced him in this. When he established the International Revolutionary Association, he did so with former supporters of Mazzini, who broke with him over his deism. It was in this period that Bakunin wrote: &quot;God exists, therefore man is a slave. Man is free, therefore there is no God. Escape this dilemma who can!&quot; which appeared in his unpublished &quot;Catechism of a freemason&quot;. Bakunin expounds his philosophy on religion&#x27;s place in history and its relationship to the modern political state. It was later published in English by Mother Earth Publications in 1916. Anarcho-communism&#x27;s main theorist Peter Kropotkin &quot;was a child of the Enlightenment and the Scientific Revolution, and assumed that religion would be replaced by science and that the Church as well as the State would be abolished; he was particularly concerned with the development of a secular system of ethics which replaced supernatural theology with natural biology&quot;.

Errico Malatesta and Carlo Cafiero, &quot;the main founders of the Italian anarchist movement, both came from freethinking families (and Cafiero was involved with the National Secular Society when he visited London during the 1870s)&quot;. In the French anarchist movement, Elisée Reclus was the son of a Calvinist minister and began by rejecting religion before moving on to anarchism. Sébastien Faure, &quot;the most active speaker and writer in the French movement for half a century&quot; wrote an essay titled &quot;Twelve Proofs of God&#x27;s Inexistence&quot;. German insurrectionary anarchist Johann Most wrote an article called &quot;The God Pestilence&quot;.

In the United States, &quot;freethought was a basically anti-christian, anti-clerical movement, whose purpose was to make the individual politically and spiritually free to decide for himself on religious matters. A number of contributors to &quot;Liberty&quot; were prominent figures in both freethought and anarchism. The individualist anarchist George MacDonald was a co-editor of &quot;Freethought&quot; and, for a time, &quot;The Truth Seeker&quot;. E.C. Walker was co-editor of the excellent free-thought / free love journal &quot;Lucifer, the Light-Bearer&quot;&quot;. &quot;Many of the anarchists were ardent freethinkers; reprints from freethought papers such as &quot;Lucifer, the Light-Bearer&quot;, &quot;Freethought&quot; and &quot;The Truth Seeker&quot; appeared in &quot;Liberty&quot;...The church was viewed as a common ally of the state and as a repressive force in and of itself&quot;. Late 19th century/early 20th Century anarchists such as Voltairine de Cleyre were often associated with the freethinkers&#x27; movement, advocating atheism.

In Europe, a similar development occurred in French and Spanish individualist anarchist circles. &quot;Anticlericalism, just as in the rest of the libertarian movement, in another of the frequent elements which will gain relevance related to the measure in which the (French) Republic begins to have conflicts with the church...Anti-clerical discourse, frequently called for by the French individualist André Lorulot, will have its impacts in &quot;Estudios&quot; (a Spanish individualist anarchist publication). There will be an attack on institutionalized religion for the responsibility that it had in the past on negative developments, for its irrationality which makes it a counterpoint of philosophical and scientific progress. There will be a criticism of proselytism and ideological manipulation which happens on both believers and agnostics.&quot;. This tendency continued in French individualist anarchism in the work and activism of Charles-Auguste Bontemps and others. In the Spanish individualist anarchist magazine &quot;Ética&quot; and &quot;Iniciales&quot; &quot;there is a strong interest in publishing scientific news, usually linked to a certain atheist and anti-theist obsession, philosophy which will also work for pointing out the incompatibility between science and religion, faith and reason. In this way there will be a lot of talk on Darwin´s theories or on the negation of the existence of the soul.&quot; Spanish anarchists in the early 20th century were responsible for burning several churches, though many of the church burnings were carried out by members of the Radical Republican Party, while anarchists were blamed. Church leaders&#x27; implicit or explicit support for the Nationalist Faction during the Spanish Civil War greatly contributed to the anti-religious sentiment.

In &quot;Anarchism: What It Really Stands For&quot;, Emma Goldman wrote: 

Chinese anarchists led the opposition to Christianity in the early 20th century, but the most prominent of them, Li Shizeng, made it clear that he opposed not only Christianity but all religions as such. When he became president of the Anti-Christian Movement of 1922, he told the Beijing Atheists&#x27; League: &quot;Religion is intrinsically old and corrupt: history has passed it by&quot; and asked, &quot;Why are we of the twentieth century... even debating this nonsense from primitive ages?&quot;

== Religious anarchism and anarchist themes in religions ==
Religious anarchists view organized religion mostly as authoritarian and hierarchical that has strayed from its humble origins, as Peter Marshall explains: 

=== Buddhism ===

Many Westerners who call themselves Buddhists regard the Buddhist tradition, in contrast to most other world faiths, as nontheistic, humanistic, and experientially-based. Most Buddhist schools, they point out, see the Buddha as the embodied proof that transcendence and ultimate happiness is possible for all, without exception.

The Indian revolutionary and self-declared atheist Har Dayal, much influenced by Marx and Bakunin, who sought to expel British rule from the subcontinent, was a striking instance of someone who, in the early 20th century, tried to synthesize anarchist and Buddhist ideas. Having moved to the United States in 1912, he went so far as to establish the Bakunin Institute of California in Oakland, which he described as &quot;the first monastery of anarchism&quot;.

Zen priest and critic Hakugen Ichikawa, in his condemnation of Buddhist support for Japanese imperialism in Asia, once concluded that &quot;if Buddhism is to possess social thought, it will have to take the form of B-A-C, Buddhism-Anarchism-Communism.&quot; Later in his career, he returned to this position, reframing it as &quot;Śūnya-anarchism-communism&quot; (空 - 無政府 - 共同体論), where Śūnya means &quot;the vertical foundation of both the subjectivity that engages in social revolution and, in terms of that subjectivity&#x27;s basic choices, the humble and open spirit that has been purified from dogmatism, self-absolutism and the will to power.&quot; Ultimately, Hakugen suggested that this results in, &quot;negating, in the horizontal dimension, state power; politically, this constitutes anarchism...Through the mediation of the reckoning of philosophical conscience (controlling desires) and by means of social-scientific discernment and praxis, one negates the capitalist system of private ownership and eliminates the social basis of the commodification of human labor power; economically, this amounts to communism.&quot; For Hakugen, Śūnya represents a &quot;vertical, existential freedom, whereas anarchism and communism pertain to horizontal freedom, and the &#x27;origin&#x27; is the point where the two dimensions of freedom intersect.&quot;

Bhante Sujato, one of the leading Theravada representatives in Australia considers himself an anarchist. In a Buddhist speech entitled &quot;I am an anarchist&quot; for Dhammanet, Sujato states his anarchist ideology, specifically aligning himself with anarcho-pacifism, which he explains as being compatible with The Buddha, Buddhist lay and renunciant life, as well as being in accord with the monastic &quot;vinaya&quot;. In the speech, Sujato explains his belief that The Buddha was also an anarchist.

=== Christianity ===
According to some, Christianity began primarily as a pacifist and anarchist movement. Jesus is said, in this view, to have come to empower individuals and free people from an oppressive religious standard in the Mosaic law; he taught that the only rightful authority was God, not Man, evolving the law into the Golden Rule (see also liberal Christianity).

As per Christian communism, anarchism is not necessarily opposed by the Catholic Church. Indeed, distributism in Catholic social teaching, such as Pope Leo XIII&#x27;s encyclical &quot;Rerum novarum&quot; and Pope Pius XI&#x27;s &quot;Quadragesimo anno,&quot; is philosophically similar to anarchism. 

=== Islam ===
The Bedouin nomads of the Khawarij were Islam&#x27;s first sect. They challenged the new centralization of power in the Islamic state as an impediment to their tribe&#x27;s freedom. At least one sect of Khawarij, the Najdat, believed that if no suitable imam was present in the community, the position could be dispensed with. A strand of Muʿtazili thought paralleled that of the Najdat: if rulers inevitably became tyrants, the only acceptable course of action was to depose them. The Nukkari subsect of Ibadi Islam reportedly adopted a similar belief. 

=== Judaism ===
Jacques Ellul recounts that at the end of the Book of Judges (Judges 21:25) there was no king in Israel and everyone did as they saw fit. Later in the first Book of Samuel (1 Samuel 8) the people of Israel wanted a king to be like other nations. God declared that the people had rejected him as their king. He warned that a human king would lead to militarism, conscription, and taxation and that their pleas for mercy from the king&#x27;s demands would go unanswered. Samuel passed on God&#x27;s warning to the Israelites but they disregarded him and chose Saul as their king. Much of the subsequent Tanakh chronicles them trying to live with this decision.

The first known Jewish Anarchist organisation in the United States was the Pioneers of Liberty (&quot;Pionire der Frayhayt&quot;). The Haymarket trial of 1886 sparked nationwide interest in anarchist ideas. On the day of the trial&#x27;s sentencing, about a dozen Jewish workers of New York&#x27;s Lower East Side founded the Pioneers of Liberty, the first Jewish anarchist organization in the United States. The group ran &quot;Varhayt&quot;, a short-lived, first Yiddish-language anarchist newspaper in the United States, between February and June 1889. And together with the Jewish anarchist Knights of Liberty group, which sprang from the Pioneers of Liberty, the two organizations together founded the long-running Yiddish-language anarchist newspaper, &quot;Fraye Arbeter Shtime&quot;, in 1890. The Pioneers of Liberty also published an annual paper, &quot;Tfileh Zakeh&quot; (Pure Prayer), which circulated during the Jewish High Holy Days between 1889 and 1893.

The Orthodox Kabbalist rabbi Yehuda Ashlag believed in a religious version of libertarian communism, based on principles of Kabbalah, which he called altruist communism. Ashlag supported the Kibbutz movement and preached to establish a network of self-ruled internationalist communes, who would eventually &quot;annul the brute-force regime completely, for &#x27;every man did that which was right in his own eyes, because &quot;there is nothing more humiliating and degrading for a person than being under the brute-force government&quot;.

A British rabbi, Yankev-Meyer Zalkind, was an anarcho-communist and very active anti-militarist. Rabbi Zalkind, a close friend of Rudolf Rocker, was a prolific Yiddish writer and a prominent Torah scholar. He argued, that the ethics of the Talmud, if properly understood, is closely related to anarchism. Zalkind&#x27;s philosophy was not popular with British Orthodox Jewry and Zalkind was shunned by the community, with Chief Rabbi Hertz denying Zalkind&#x27;s rabbinic credentials and Zalkind being forced to renounce his rabbinic title.

The Yiddish anti-authoritarian and anti-police song &quot;In Ale Gasn/Daloy Politsey&quot; dates from the time of the Russian Revolutions and continues to be sung by artists who identify with political tendencies like anarchism. Many versions of the song have been updated to talk about modern issues such as government corruption, police brutality, and general anarchist themes, along with translating them into languages like English and German. The song is actually a portmanteau of two different Jewish Anarchist songs from the period of the Russian Revolutions, which were combined by Zalmen Mlotek for the film &quot;The Free Voice of Labour: The Jewish Anarchists&quot;, 1980.

Over the past decade, there has been a renewed interest in Jewish anarchism due to the growth of organizations like Jewdas and Pink Peacock (UK) and media outlets like the &quot;Treyf&quot; podcast (Canada). This interest has been aided by the publication of new books on the subject, such as Kenyon Zimmer&#x27;s Immigrants against the State, and the reissuing of documentaries such as &quot;The Free Voice of Labour&quot;, which details the final days of the &quot;Fraye Arbeter Shtime&quot;. In January 2019, The YIVO Institute for Jewish Research organized a special conference on Yiddish anarchism in New York City, which drew over 450 people.

Jewish anarchist newspapers include &quot;Arbeter Fraynd&quot;, &quot;Burevestnik&quot;, &quot;Chernoe Znamja&quot; (Black Flag), &quot;Dos Fraye Vort&quot;, &quot;Fraye Arbeter Shtime&quot;, &quot;Germinal&quot;, and &quot;Kagenna Magazine&quot;.

Many people of Jewish origin, such as Emma Goldman, Alexander Berkman, Paul Goodman, Murray Bookchin, Volin, Gustav Landauer, David Graeber, and Noam Chomsky have played a role in the history of anarchism. However, as well as these anarchists of Jewish origin, there have also been specifically Jewish anarchist movements, within the Yiddish-speaking communities of Eastern and Central Europe, and the Western cities to which they migrated, from the late nineteenth century until the Second World War. All the members of the first anarchist group in the Russian Empire, which was formed in 1903 in Białystok, were Jews. 

Different anarchist groups had different views on Zionism and the Jewish question. Bernard Lazare was a key figure in both the French anarchist movement and early Zionist movement. The later Territorialist movement, especially the Freeland League, under the leadership of Isaac Nachman Steinberg, was very close to anarchism. Some others, such as Martin Buber and Gershom Scholem, advocated non-nationalist forms of Zionism, and promoted the idea of creating a binational Jewish-Arab federation in Palestine. Many contemporary anarchists support the idea of what has been dubbed the &quot;no-state solution&quot;. Noam Chomsky has said that, as an anarchist, he ultimately favors such a no-state solution, but, in the short term, feels a two-state solution is the best way out of the present conflict. Within Israel there is also the organisation Anarchists Against the Wall, which is a direct action group composed of Israeli anarchists and anti-authoritarians who oppose the construction of the Israeli Gaza Strip barrier and Israeli West Bank barrier.

=== Taoism ===

Many early Taoists, such as the influential Laozi and Zhuangzi, were critical of authority and advised rulers that the less controlling they were, the more stable and effective their rule would be. However, there are parts of Laozi&#x27;s Tao Te Ching where an at least stateless, if not anarchistic, viewpoint is more apparent. In chapter 29 it is stated:

 &quot;Trying to control the world?&quot;
 &quot;I see you won&#x27;t succeed.&quot;
 &quot;The world is a spiritual vessel&quot;
 &quot;And cannot be controlled.&quot;
 &quot;Those who control, fail.&quot;

In Chapter 53:
 &quot;Granaries are empty,&quot;
 &quot;But the nobels clothes are gorgeous,&quot;
 &quot;Their belts show off swords,&quot;
 &quot;And they are gluted with food and drink.&quot;
 &quot;Personal wealth is excessive.&quot;
 &quot;This is called thieves&#x27; endowment,&quot;
 &quot;But it is not Tao.&quot;

In chapter 57:
 &quot;the Sage says...&quot;
 &quot;I enjoy serenity &quot;
 &quot;And people govern themselves.&quot;

In Chapter 66:
 &quot;Those who would lead&quot;
 &quot;Must speak as if they are behind&quot;

In Chapter 68:
 &quot;The most effective leader takes the&quot;
 &quot;lowest place&quot;

In Chapter 72:
 &quot;When people are not in awe of power,&quot;
 &quot;Power becomes great.&quot;

There is still debate among contemporary anarchists about whether or not this counts as an anarchist view. It is known, however, that some less influential Taoists, such as Bao Jingyan, explicitly advocated anarchy.

<text>The [[Toyota]] VZ engine family is a series of V6 gasoline piston engines ranging from in displacement and both SOHC and DOHC configurations. It was Toyota&#x27;s first V6 engine, being made as a response to Nissan’s VG engine, one of Japan&#x27;s first mass-produced V6 engines.

The VZ family uses a 60° V-angle design, and introduced many changes for Toyota, including various EFI, ECU, and engine improvements from generation to generation. The low angle DOHC and SOHC cylinder heads excel in low-mid torque and power, making the VZ series well-suited for various uses in cars, trucks, and SUVs.

The blocks are all strongly made using cast iron with large interconnected main bearing cradles and two bolt main bearing caps. Cylinder heads are made from aluminium. Forged steel crankshafts, and cast iron main bearing support girdles became standard with the 3VZ-FE. Piston and ring construction are typical parts, with rods varying between large and very large for stock V6 production engines.

The 1VZ-FE is a version, produced from 1987 to 1993. Bore and stroke is . Output is at 6000 rpm and at 4600 rpm. It uses a DOHC layout with a cast iron block and an aluminium 24 valve head.

Applications:
* 1988–1991 Toyota Camry Prominent (Japan only)
* 1988–1991 Toyota Vista (V20) (Japan only)

==2VZ-FE==
The 2VZ-FE is a version, produced from 1987 to 1991. Bore and stroke is and the compression ratio is 9.0:1. Output as fitted to the North American Lexus ES250 is at 5,600 rpm and at 4400 rpm with redline limit of 6800 rpm. It uses a DOHC layout with a cast iron block and an aluminium 24 valve head.

Applications:
* 1988–1991 Toyota Camry (V20)
* 1989–1991 Lexus ES 250

==3VZ-E==
The 3VZ-E is a version, produced from 1987 to 1995. Bore remains at but stroke is pushed to . At introduction output was specified as then later bumped to at 4800 rpm with of torque at 3400 rpm. It uses an SOHC layout with a cast iron block and an aluminium 12 valve head.

Despite sharing an engine family designation with the 3VZ-FE, the 3VZ-E and 3VZ-FE only have a few parts in common.

Applications:
* 1988–1995 Toyota 4Runner
* 1988–1995 Toyota Pickup
* 1988–1995 Toyota Hilux
* 1992–1994 Toyota T100

==3VZ-FE==
The 3VZ-FE is a version, produced from 1992 to 1997. It is a revised variant of the 3VZ-E, mated with aluminium DOHC 24 valve heads. It retains the same bore and stroke, and has a forged steel crankshaft and cast connecting rods. The upper intake plenum is of the split-chamber design with Toyota&#x27;s ACIS variable-intake system feeding three sets of runners for both heads.

Because the VZ series was originally for pickup truck and SUV use, the 3VZ-FE happens to be a physically tall motor. To make the engine fit in FWD engine bays, Toyota tilted the motor towards the firewall. This &quot;tilt&quot; is so severe (approximately ~15 degrees) that reaching the rear bank of cylinders is nearly impossible without first removing the intake plenum.

Parts-wise, the 3VZ-FE shares very little with the rest of the VZ engine family. The main bearings are shared with the 3VZ-E, but little else. Cams can also be interchanged between the 5VZ-FE and 3VZ-FE heads.

The 3VZ-FE was used on the Camry platform from 1992 to May 1997 depending on the market: North America saw the engine only in 1992 and 1993, while Australia and New Zealand had it from 1992 to 1996. This engine was available in some parts of Asia in the Windom until May 1997. Following 1994, the 1MZ-FE engines replaced the 3VZ-FE in most applications. However, the 3VZ-FE continued to be used in Australia until 1996, especially in the Camry. The Scepter (the Japanese version of the XV10 Camry) retained the engine until its discontinuation in December 1996. The power spread of the 3VZ-FE is wide, having close to maximum torque between 2500 and 4600 rpm, with power trailing off by 6000 rpm. The stock redline is 6600 rpm, and the ECU&#x27;s fuel/ignition cut-off is 7200 rpm.

The 1992–1993 engine is rated at at 5800 rpm and at 4600 rpm. Compression ratio is 9.6:1.

The 3VZ-FE is fairly common in most parts of the world, having a long lifespan in popular models.

Applications:
* 1992–1993 Toyota Camry (North America)
* 1992–1993 Lexus ES300 (North America)
* 1992–1996 Toyota Camry (Australia and Europe)
* 1992–1996 Toyota Windom (Japan only)
* 1993–1996 Toyota Scepter (Japan only)

==4VZ-FE==
The 4VZ-FE is a version, produced from 1992 to 1998. It was built to replace the 2VZ-FE as Toyota&#x27;s new 2.5 L V6. It uses a DOHC layout with a cast iron block and an aluminium 24 valve head.

Bore is and stroke is slightly shorter than that of the 2VZ-FE at . Output is at 6000 rpm. Compression ratio of this engine was raised from 9.0:1 to 9.6:1.

Applications:
* 1992–1996 Toyota Camry Prominent (Japan only)
* 1993–1996 Toyota Windom VCV11 (Japan only)

==5VZ-FE==
The 5VZ-FE is a version, produced from 1995 to 2004. It replaces the SOHC 3VZ-E engine. Bore is up to and stroke is while the compression ratio stays the same as the 3VZ-FE at 9.6:1. Output is for Tacoma and for 4Runner at 4800 rpm with of torque for Tacoma and for 4Runner at 3600 rpm.

It has a cast iron engine block, and aluminium DOHC cylinder heads. The 5VZ-FE uses sequential multi-port fuel injection, has four valves per cylinder with shim-over-bucket tappets and features large cast connecting rods, one-piece cast camshafts, a cast crank (unlike the 3VZ-FE, which was forged) and a cast aluminium intake manifold. This engine also sometimes features an oil cooler (depending on application) and a wasted spark ignition system with three coils. Camshafts are belt-driven. It is a non-interference engine.

Applications:
* 1996–2004 Toyota Land Cruiser Prado
* 1995–1998 Toyota T-100
* 1995–2002 Toyota Granvia
* 1999–2002 Toyota Grand HiAce
* 1995–2004 Toyota Tacoma
* 1995–2004 Toyota Hilux
* 1996–2002 Toyota 4Runner
* 2000–2004 Toyota Tundra
* 2000–2002, 2004 GAZ-3111 Volga

<doc id="1332783" wikidata="Q5123633" url="?curid=1332783" title="City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc.">
<text>City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc., 473 U.S. 432 (1985), was a U.S. Supreme Court case involving discrimination against the intellectually disabled.

In 1980, Cleburne Living Center, Inc. (CLC) submitted a permit application seeking approval to build a group home for intellectually disabled people. The city of Cleburne, Texas refused to grant CLC a permit on the basis of a municipal zoning ordinance. CLC then sued the City of Cleburne on the theory that the denial of the permit violated the Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection rights of CLC and their potential residents.

Applying rational basis review, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the ordinance as applied to CLC. The Court declined to rule that intellectually disabled people were a quasi-suspect or suspect class.

== Background ==
In July 1980, Jan Hannah purchased a building at 201 Featherston Street, within the city limits of Cleburne, with the intent of leasing it to CLC so that they could operate it as a group home for intellectually disabled people. The home was intended to house a total of thirteen mentally disabled men and women. CLC staff would supervise the residents at all times. The house itself had four bedrooms and two baths, with another half bath to be added.

The city of Cleburne informed CLC that a special use permit would be required for a group home such as this, and so CLC submitted the permit application. The city&#x27;s zoning regulations required that a special use permit, renewable annually, was required for the construction of &quot;[hospitals] for the insane or feeble-minded, or alcoholics or drug addicts, or penal or correctional institutions&quot; (436). The city had classified the group home as a &quot;hospital for the feebly minded&quot; (437). The Planning and Zoning Commission denied the request, and CLC&#x27;s Hannah, Bobbie Northrop, and David Southern moved their request to the City Council.

The city of Cleburne held a public hearing on the meeting, after which they denied the special use permit to CLC on a vote of 3 to 1.

== Case history ==
After their special use permit was denied CLC filed suit in Federal District Court against the city, alleging that the zoning ordinance was invalid on its face and as applied because it discriminated against intellectually disabled people in violation of the equal protection rights of CLC and its potential residents. The Federal District Court found that if the potential residents of CLC&#x27;s group home had not been intellectually disabled the permit would have been granted. However, they upheld the city&#x27;s ordinance and actions as constitutional. The District Court held that intellectually disabled people were neither a suspect nor a quasi-suspect class and therefore the rational basis test should be applied. The court held that the ordinance was rationally related to the city&#x27;s legitimate interest in &quot;the legal responsibility of CLC and its residents, . . . the safety and fears of residents in the adjoining neighborhood,&quot; and the number of people to be housed in the home.

The Federal Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed the decision of the District Court. The Court of Appeals held that an intellectual disability was a quasi-suspect class and therefore intermediate scrutiny should be applied to the ordinance. Applying the heightened scrutiny standard to the ordinance, the court held it was unconstitutional on its face and as applied. The city appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, which granted certiorari.

== Supreme Court opinion ==
Justice White&#x27;s majority opinion invalidated the ordinance as applied to CLC, holding that the denial of the permit was based on irrational prejudice against intellectually disabled people and hence was invalid under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Unlike most cases where the Court uses rational basis review, the Court did not accept the city&#x27;s claimed interest. Some commentators have referred to this investigation into the actual reasons for passing the law as &quot;rational basis with bite&quot;.

The Court declined to grant intellectually disabled people status as a suspect or quasi-suspect class because they are a &quot;large and diversified group&quot; amply protected by state and federal legislatures. Therefore, any legislation that distinguishes between intellectually disabled people and others must be rationally related to a legitimate government interest in order to withstand equal protection review. This is also known as rational basis review and is the lowest level of review under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Justice Marshall, dissenting in part and concurring in the result of invalidating the statute, argued that due to the history of discrimination against intellectually disabled people, the Court should employ a higher standard of scrutiny (see Equal Protection scrutiny) when examining laws that regulated those with mental disabilities.

== Significance ==
Although the Supreme Court declined to classify those with mental disabilities as a suspect or quasi-suspect class, the decision is one of the few instances in which the Supreme Court has held government legislation to be unconstitutional when it applied a rational basis level of review. Another example of the Supreme Court holding that government legislation was unconstitutional when it applied to rational basis level of review was the landmark gay-rights decision in &quot;Romer v. Evans&quot;.

<doc id="1332800" wikidata="Q1638106" url="?curid=1332800" title="Hunter (1984 American TV series)">
<text>Hunter is an American crime drama television series created by Frank Lupo that ran on NBC from September 18, 1984, to April 26, 1991. It stars Fred Dryer as Sergeant Rick Hunter and Stepfanie Kramer as Sergeant Dee Dee McCall, and Charles Hallahan as Captain Charles &quot;Charlie&quot; Devane. The title character Sgt. Rick Hunter is a wily, physically imposing, often rule-breaking homicide detective with the Los Angeles Police Department.

The show&#x27;s executive producer during the first season was Stephen J. Cannell, whose company produced the series. Stepfanie Kramer left after the sixth season (1990) to pursue other acting and musical opportunities. For the seventh and final season, Hunter had two new partners: Officer Joanne Molenski (Darlanne Fluegel) for the first seven episodes, then Sergeant Chris Novak (Lauren Lane) for the remaining eleven.

In the mid-to-late 1990s, Dryer (and eventually Kramer) returned for a trio of TV movies. A short-lived revival aired in 2003, consisting of five feature length episodes.

==Premise==
Though the world may perceive Los Angeles as a sunny paradise, Rick Hunter only sees a dark underbelly of street violence.

Hunter is a plainclothes police detective (a la &quot;Dirty Harry&quot;) whose world is made up of pimps, low-lifes and psychopaths. This life has toughened him. Although sharp and dedicated, he will sometimes go to dangerous extremes to apprehend a criminal. Because of this he is in constant conflict with his straight arrow administrative officer, Lester Cain. Cain is a desk-bound officer who is more concerned with paperwork than with cleaning up the streets. He throws spanners into Hunter&#x27;s cases whenever possible. Hunter, who is constantly trying to buck the system anyway, just sees Cain as a minor annoyance until he is assigned with a female detective partner.

Hunter frowns about female cops, but Dee Dee McCall is a hard-edged policewoman whose unorthodox detective work, which rivals that of Hunter&#x27;s, is not that of a typical female police detective.

===Hunter&#x27;s backstory===
Rick Hunter&#x27;s father was a mobster involved in organized crime who was killed in a shoot-out with rival gangsters. This made Hunter estrange himself from that world and he decided to become a police officer. Despite this, Hunter would, on occasion, contact relatives and acquaintances in those criminal families for information (provided it did not directly involve them) whenever he had a particularly difficult case to crack.

==Episodes==

===Season 1 (1984–85)===
The show began in a Tuesday nighttime slot with the two-part pilot episodes of &quot;Hunter&quot; initially broadcast in a time slot on a Friday night, competing for ratings against the popular &quot;Dallas&quot;. The show struggled to attract an audience and drew criticism for its often-graphic depiction of violence. In the first season, the producers sought to create a hook by giving the main character a catchphrase, &quot;Works for me&quot;, which was sometimes used two or three times in an episode and was even added to the end of Mike Post and Pete Carpenter&#x27;s opening theme music. Several early episodes featured montages set to popular songs from the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, in a style similar to &quot;Miami Vice&quot;.
Midway through the first season, with low ratings still, Cannell gave network chief Brandon Tartikoff a private screening of a two-part episode (&quot;The Snow Queen&quot;) that had not yet aired and asked him to give the show more time to attract viewers. Tartikoff agreed and put the show on hiatus until a better time slot could be found. Two months later, &quot;Hunter&quot; resumed, this time on Saturday nights, and viewership slowly started to rise. The first season finished in 65th place.

===Season 2 (1985–86)===
For its second season, Cannell brought in his mentor, Roy Huggins, best known for his work on &quot;Maverick&quot; and &quot;The Rockford Files&quot;, to refine the show. As the new executive producer, Huggins pushed up the violence but softened the main character&#x27;s fractious relationship with his superiors, dropped a backstory concerning Hunter&#x27;s family ties to the mob, and emphasized the chemistry between Hunter and McCall. Huggins also moved the show&#x27;s setting out of the back streets and into the more desirable areas of Los Angeles. Emboldened, Dryer and Kramer frequently improvised the scripts, and the Hunter character broke the fourth wall for the first time with an aside to viewers at the end of the episode &quot;The Beautiful and the Dead&quot;.

Probably the most memorable aspect to the second season was the two-part episode &quot;Rape and Revenge&quot;, which may have drawn from some diplomatic-immunity scandals that were prominent in the news. A psychopathic foreign diplomat meets McCall and wants to have a relationship with her, and after she declines, he brutally rapes her in her home. Hunter is badly shot in the shoulder and must recover quickly, then go to the diplomat&#x27;s home country to dispense justice, Hunter-style. This episode was considered very controversial for its realistic and shocking depiction of a violent rape, which was not common in TV shows at the time. Because of the controversial plot and acting, &quot;Rape and Revenge&quot; is one of the most remembered and popular episodes of the series.

Another important aspect to the second season was towards its end (in the episode &quot;The Return of Typhoon Thompson&quot;), when viewers were first introduced to Hunter and McCall&#x27;s favorite street informant—the humorous Arnold &quot;Sporty&quot; James, played by Garrett Morris.

Viewers also responded to Huggins&#x27; changes, and the show&#x27;s second season ended in 38th place in the Nielsen ratings. &quot;Hunter&quot; continued this progress to become a mainstay of NBC&#x27;s Saturday-night schedule.

In syndication, the season-two introduction was replaced by the season-one introduction. The former showed Hunter entering a women&#x27;s locker room in one scene, and McCall and him pointing their guns at each other with the bathroom light on in another scene.

===Season 3 (1986–87)===
Just before work on the third season began, Dryer threatened to quit unless his salary, reportedly US$21,000 per episode, was raised and creative changes were made. Cannell responded with a US$20 million breach-of-contract lawsuit. A compromise was reached, a new deal with Dryer reportedly earning US$50,000 per episode. The third season, again led by Huggins, added Charles Hallahan as Captain Charlie Devane, who remained Hunter and McCall&#x27;s captain for the rest of the show, eventually included in the opening credits of the show and becoming one of the show&#x27;s main stars (none of the previous captains in the series had achieved this). This was the show&#x27;s first season in the top 30, coming in at 25th.

In the episode &quot;Shades&quot; (which was the season finale, but aired later in the summer, in July 1987) when Hunter went missing, McCall teamed with a somewhat Columbo-like Detective Sergeant Kitty O&#x27;Hearn (Shelley Taylor Morgan). O&#x27;Hearn reappeared during the season-four three-part episode &quot;City of Passion&quot;. Another remembered episode from season three was &quot;Requiem For Sergeant McCall&quot;, which was a contradiction to a storyline from the beginning of the show. When the show first started, McCall&#x27;s husband (Steven McCall) was supposedly killed five years before, in 1979, by a &quot;punk&quot; kid during a routine stop. At that time, Steven and Dee Dee were newly married and starting out as rookie uniform cops. However, in 1987, in &quot;Requiem&quot;, just five years before (which would be around 1982 instead of 1979), Steven was a homicide detective (while Dee Dee was still just a rookie) and he was working on a big murder case that resulted in him being killed. In &quot;Requiem&quot;, Steven&#x27;s killer is getting paroled, and Dee Dee McCall is doing everything she can to get him back in prison—plus trying to solve the original murder case that her husband died trying to solve five years earlier.

Another notable episode was &quot;Any Second Now&quot;, in which Theresa Saldana played a pianist being stalked by a psychotic fan. This was based on the real-life incident Saldana herself was a victim of when she was stalked and brutally stabbed by Scottish immigrant and drifter, Arthur Richard Jackson, outside her Los Angeles home in 1982. The violent attack later became the subject of the 1984 TV film, &quot;Victims for Victims: The Theresa Saldana Story&quot;, and Jackson was then extradited to England to be tried for a 1966 robbery and murder. He was committed to a psychiatric hospital and remained there until 2004 when he died of heart failure.

===Season 4 (1987–88)===
Huggins retired at the end of the fourth season, which placed 18th in the Nielsen ratings. A three-part storyline, &quot;City of Passion&quot;, teamed Hunter and Dee Dee with Sergeant Kitty O&#x27;Hearn (Shelley Taylor Morgan) and her new partner, Sergeant Brad Navarro (Erik Estrada). Together, they captured the serial rapist called Big Foot. Originally, the plot of &quot;City of Passion&quot; involved McCall getting raped again—this time by Big Foot, and she had to deal with the pain and emotions as she did in the second season&#x27;s &quot;Rape and Revenge&quot;. However, Stepfanie Kramer immediately balked at this and argued the rape idea had already been done, and to repeat it, as well as having her character put in a situation to get raped again, was ridiculous. Kramer threatened to quit unless the script was changed. Producers and writers agreed, and a compromise was made: Big Foot attacked and attempted to rape McCall, but she fought him and prevented the rape.

Also known as one of the more memorable episodes for fourth season was &quot;The Black Dahlia&quot;. The real-life infamous unsolved Black Dahlia LA murder case from 1947 is thrust back into headlines as bones with identical cuts to the historical case are discovered under an old building being demolished. In the episode, Hunter and McCall solve the famous murder case 41 years to the day (1947–88) as the episode aired on the anniversary date of the real-life murder. As a special message at the end states, the real-life case is still open, and the real killer has never been found.

The episode &quot;Murder He Wrote&quot; was a play on words with the show &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; which was on CBS at the time. In fact, actress Marge Redmond was similar looking to Angela Lansbury in the episode, which led to a funny exchange between Hunter and McCall in one scene where Redmond&#x27;s character &quot;looked familiar&quot;.

Opening Credits changed, most notably removal of the gun and car &quot;action&quot; clips used in previous seasons. This reflected a change in the format where the frequent car chases and shootouts from the first three seasons were dropped and the show became more of a standard police procedural, with only occasional action scenes.

===Season 5 (1988–89)===
For the fifth season, George Geiger took on the role of executive producer, having worked in the same capacity on &quot;Scarecrow and Mrs. King&quot;, as well as a brief stint as co-executive producer on &quot;Miami Vice&quot;. In the first four seasons, Hunter and McCall typically worked on cases together, allowing the producers to showcase the chemistry between the actors, but the fifth season increasingly had them working apart, ostensibly to lessen the workload of Dryer and Kramer and to allow richer, more complex stories. So instead of jeans and an old sports jacket, Hunter often was seen in a full suit and tie.

One of the most memorable episodes of the fifth season was the special three-part episode &quot;City Under Siege&quot;, which had a special introduction for each of the three parts. It dealt with a psychotic woman named Iris Smith (Cec Verrell) and her crazy boyfriend, Billy Joe Powell (Daniel Quinn), who terrorized the city of Los Angeles, committing multiple murders against people who the woman felt had &quot;wronged&quot; her in some way.

Hunter was one of the intended victims, having arrested Billy Joe years earlier for a series of murders in which he killed his female victims with a straight razor. One sub-plot focused on the huge crime spree throughout the city and the pressure the police department was under to get it under control. Another sub-plot involved a corrupt Deputy Chief named Curtis Moorehead (Robert Vaughn), who continually hamstrung the entire police department&#x27;s efforts to find Iris and Billy Joe in order to further his own ends.

Further compounding the problem was Jack Small (James Sikking), a local resident who aggressively took the law into his own hands to combat the local crime wave, earning him a reputation in his neighborhood as an urban vigilante. He had a teenage daughter, Debbie (Brynn Horrocks) who was a good-hearted but troubled young woman whom McCall befriended while she was working undercover at her high school investigating the murder of one of the teachers named Sandra Clemens. Sandra was Iris&#x27; old teacher whom she had a grudge against for stopping her from stealing lunch money from a fellow student. Another subplot of the story revolved around Johnny Youngblood (Craig Hurley), a mover and shaker at the school who dealt in various shady enterprises. Also appearing in a guest-starring role was real-life journalist, Saida Pagan as television reporter, Saida Rodrigues Pagan. In part two, Laurelle Brooks guest-starred as Allison, a naive high-school cheerleader who falls under Johnny&#x27;s charms and unknown to her, make a videotape of them having sex. At the end of the episode, statistics were presented showing a reduction of crime in Los Angeles that year. The fifth season placed 17th in the Nielsen ratings.

In the episode &quot;Shoot to Kill&quot;, Hunter helps McCall get back on active duty after an IA investigation. Hunter jokes about &quot;returning the favor&quot;. McCall winks, smiles and asks Hunter to &quot;follow her&quot;. As Hunter walks behind her he looks right into the camera and says &quot;After all this time, it was bound to happen eventually.&quot; It&#x27;s not proven whether they did sleep together here, but in the Season 6 episode &quot;Unfinished Business&quot; it&#x27;s confirmed they did at least once but based on the timeline in the episode it would have happened in season 3, not season 5.

Uniformed officers costumes changed, dropping the Metro Police shoulder patch of previous four seasons, leaving the uniforms looking more the real LAPD. Door shields on patrol cars also changed to look like those of LAPD.

===Season 6 (1989–90)===
By the sixth season, Dryer&#x27;s growing influence had won him the role of executive producer. Probably the most remembered episode of the sixth season was &quot;Unfinished Business&quot;. During this episode, the audience learns that Hunter and McCall had actually once slept together, causing a rift in their working relationship. Fred Dryer stated that this episode was filmed to try to appease fans and the network, who were constantly wanting Hunter and McCall to get together. However, Fred Dryer and Stepfanie Kramer stated they did not want that to happen, because once it did, &quot;Hunter&quot; would become &quot;Hart to Hart&quot;.

Another memorable episode this season was &quot;Yesterday&#x27;s Child&quot;. In this episode, a Vietnamese man visits Hunter and pleads with him to take on the case of a robbery and murder at an upscale car dealership, of which his son was the main suspect. Over the course of the conversation, Hunter discovers that the 17-year-old suspect was actually his own son. The boy is revealed to be the product of a relationship Hunter had with a woman while he was in Vietnam.

Also for this season, homicide was moved to the more updated Parker Center, instead of the old downtown division building. However, at the end of the sixth season, which placed 26th in the Nielsen ratings, Stepfanie Kramer decided to leave the series to pursue a career in music. Kramer&#x27;s character was written out in the season&#x27;s two-part finale showing the McCall character marrying an old flame and moving out of Los Angeles.

===Season 7 (1990–91)===
For the seventh and final season, NBC shifted the show to 10 pm on Wednesdays. A new female co-star, Darlanne Fluegel as Officer Joanne Molenski, was brought in. However, she reportedly had creative differences with Fred Dryer, and halfway through the season, she decided she wanted out. Her character was murdered by a female serial killer in the two-part episode &quot;Fatal Obsession&quot;. Her replacement for the second half of the season was Lauren Lane as Sergeant Chris Novak, supposedly a former girlfriend of Hunter&#x27;s. Hunter&#x27;s signature unmarked vehicle, a moss green 1977 Dodge Monaco, was also finally replaced (after an accident with Molenski&#x27;s cruiser in the season&#x27;s first episode) by an updated new silver 1990 Ford LTD Crown Victoria. Hunter was now also back to wearing jeans and a shirt. Also, for the first time (aside from the sixth-season finale), Hunter made sporadic appearances in uniform.

However, the new partners and changes did little to boost ratings (47th in the Nielsen standings). A salary dispute involving Dryer led to the show being discontinued at the end of the season.

===Reunions and revivals===
Four years after the original series ended, a reunion NBC TV movie, &quot;The Return of Hunter: Everyone Walks in L.A.&quot;, had Dryer and Charles Hallahan reprise their roles as Rick Hunter and Charlie Devane. Hunter had now also been promoted to lieutenant. Airing on April 30, 1995, the movie seemed to take the &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; idea as the plot—a psycho wants fame and/or to be noticed and begins terrorizing the city to gain media attention. Along the way, he becomes infatuated with attention from Hunter, eventually wanting to kill him. Stepfanie Kramer, pregnant at the time, did not reprise her role as Dee Dee McCall. The TV-movie co-starred Barry Bostwick, Miguel Ferrer, and John C. McGinley.

Seven years later in November 2002, 11 years after the original series ended, the reunion TV movie &quot;Hunter: Return to Justice&quot; made its premiere to strong ratings. This time, Stepfanie Kramer returned to her role as McCall, and the show&#x27;s setting switched from Los Angeles to San Diego—as Hunter&#x27;s current L.A. partner is killed in the line of duty.

Given the success of the TV movie, Cannell, Dryer, and NBC attempted to bring back &quot;Hunter&quot; as a regular series: the April 2003 airing of another TV movie, &quot;Hunter: Back in Force&quot;, served as the pilot for the new series. The network decided to broadcast three new one-hour episodes of &quot;Hunter&quot; (&quot;Vaya Sin Dios&quot;, &quot;Untouchable&quot;, and &quot;Dead Heat&quot;). Another two episodes were filmed (as originally five episodes were to be aired), but never shown in the U.S, as NBC decided to cancel the new series. Fred Dryer later cited &quot;creative difficulties&quot; and budget constraints as the reasons for the revival&#x27;s unexpected end.

A feature film is rumored to be in the works. It is unknown if Fred Dryer and Stefanie Kramer would be making cameo appearances.

==Production==

===Vehicles===
In the pilot television film, &quot;Hunter&quot; drove a blue 1977 Dodge Monaco and a 1970 Ford LTD. Because &quot;Hunter&quot; constantly was getting into wrecks chasing suspects and regularly &quot;busted&quot; up any police car he was given, the department would only issue him older model cars that would barely run. Once the series started (fall 1984), during the first season, &quot;Hunter&quot; drove a 1972 Chevrolet Impala, a 1971 Chevrolet Nova, a 1974 Plymouth Satellite, and a 1979 Chevrolet Caprice Classic. A 1971 Impala was actually shown exploding to end the episodes using Chevrolets. Monacos seemed to be the police car of choice, as the second season had &quot;Hunter&quot; occasionally driving a junker multiple-colored side panel 1977 Monaco (jokingly referred to as the &quot;Partridge Family&quot; Monaco), as well as other &#x27;77 models in yellow, brown, and black. After the show was more &quot;established&quot; and starting with the third season and through the first episode of seventh season, Hunter drove a moss green 1977 Monaco. This car was in better condition than the previous Monacos and became Hunter&#x27;s trademark vehicle — to the point that when it was destroyed in the third season, it was replaced with an identical one. During the seventh and last season, Detective Hunter drove a new silver 1991 Ford LTD Crown Victoria.

During the first two seasons, McCall drove a garnet red and silver 1984 Dodge Daytona Turbo Z. Then starting with season three and on through season five, McCall drove a bright red 1987 Daytona Shelby Z (Sometimes though, a &quot;Turbo Z&quot; badge on this Daytona is also clearly visible). During the sixth season - her final season, she drove a gold-colored 1990 Dodge Dynasty. (An episode during the fourth or fifth season showed the outside of what was supposedly McCall&#x27;s house and a yellow 1987 Ford Mustang was out front. However, McCall is only shown driving it once and then it was never shown again.)

Both Officer Joanne Molenski and Sgt. Chris Novak, during last season, drove a tan/beige 1991 LTD Crown Victoria.

Captain Charles &quot;Charlie&quot; Devane drove a brand new light blue metallic 1988 Ford LTD Crown Victoria hard top sedan starting in season 4. This vehicle was subsequently replaced with a light gray 1989 Ford LTD Crown Victoria, the two vehicles can be distinguished from each other as 1989 hardtop models have chrome trim on the side of the C pillar while 1988 hardtop models omit this. The 1989 was then replaced in season 7 with a 1990 Ford LTD Crown Victoria hardtop sedan, while it was the same color as the 1989 model, the difference was the updated air bag included dashboard and steering wheel. Other undercover officers in season 7 drove one of three 1987 Chevrolet Caprice 9C1 4 door sedans, one in navy blue, one in silver, and one in brown.

In the first reunion film, &quot;The Return of Hunter: Everyone Walks in L.A.&quot;, Hunter drove a black 1995 Ford Crown Victoria. In &quot;Hunter: Return to Justice&quot;, Hunter drove a black 2002 Ford Crown Victoria P71 Police Interceptor and McCall drove a silver 2002 Mercedes Benz CLK320 convertible. In &quot;Hunter: Back in Force&quot; and the subsequent new series, Hunter drove a black 2003 Ford Crown Victoria P70 [LWB] Long Wheel Base Police Interceptor and McCall occasionally drove a black 2003 Ford Expedition.
