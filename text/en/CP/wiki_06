<text>Spectrum News 1 Capital Region (formerly [[Time Warner Cable]] News Capital Region) is an American cable news television channel owned by Charter Communications as an affiliate of its Spectrum News slate of regional news channels. The channel provides 24-hour rolling news coverage focused primarily on the Capital District of eastern New York. The channel is headquartered in Albany, New York, and maintains a sub feed serving the Hudson Valley region. Spectrum News 1 Capital Region is carried on channel 9 throughout most of the region, although its channel slot varies in the towns of Queensbury and Canajoharie, and in Berkshire County, Massachusetts.

As with the rest of its upstate sister news channels in upstate New York, Spectrum News 1 Capital Region shares news content with New York City-based NY1, Charter&#x27;s flagship regional cable news channel (which the provider carries on the digital tiers of its Upstate New York systems).

==History==

Prior to the launch of the channel, Time Warner Cable carried a repurposed rebroadcast of the 6:00 p.m. newscast from CBS affiliate WRGB (channel 6) on its local origination channel on channel 9. After Nielsen ratings reports showed that the broadcast was competitive with the fledgling 6:30 p.m. newscast on Fox affiliate WXXA-TV (channel 23), Time Warner Cable moved forward with plans to launch an in-house 24-hour news channel.

The channel was launched on October 11, 2002 as Capital News 9. Its debuted nearly a year behind schedule due to various infrastructure and staffing delays. With the launch of Capital News 9, Time Warner Cable&#x27;s public access channel was moved from channel 9 to channel 3 on most of its Capital District systems (and became known as &quot;TW3&quot;). Capital News 9 came out of a period when Time Warner Cable rolled out several cable news channels. Within a two-year period, the provider had launched regional news channels in Syracuse (News 10 Now), Houston, (News 24 Houston) and San Antonio (News 9 San Antonio). Two channels were also launched in North Carolina, one based in Raleigh and another in Charlotte (both referred to as News 14 Carolina). Of the channels that launched, only Time Warner Cable News Central New York (the former News 10 Now) and Time Warner Cable News North Carolina (the former News 14 Carolina, which operates four region-specific feeds) remain, the byproduct of financial losses and a dispute with the Belo Corporation, which was a partner in the Texas and Charlotte channels.

On May 25, 2005, Time Warner Cable announced that it would eliminate 30 staff positions from sister networks R News in Rochester and News 10 Now in Syracuse in a cost-saving consolidation of its three regional news channels at the time in upstate New York. News 10 Now and R News&#x27;s technical production and master control operations were merged with Capital News 9. With the move, Capital News 9 began serving as the production and studio hub for the news programming of both channels (with Capital News 9&#x27;s anchor staff handling simultaneous on-air duties on both sister channels), while News 10 Now began handling production responsibilities for weather forecast segments for all of its sister news channels statewide from its Syracuse facility (using the channel&#x27;s weather staff). Each of the channels retained their respective newsgathering crews, producers, facilities and news management; the channels also simulcast the Albany-produced political review program &quot;Capital Tonight&quot;. In addition, the cable access channels on the systems in each of the channels&#x27; markets now share broadcasts of collegiate sporting events in the event that Time Warner Cable is able to secure the rights to air the telecasts in all of its upstate markets.

In August 2006, Capital News 9 expanded its reach to systems within eastern New York that Time Warner Cable had recently acquired from Adelphia Communications. In April 2008, Capital News 9 began simulcasting its audio full-time on local radio station WUAM (900 AM); the simulcasting agreement with the channel ended in 2014, upon mutual agreement by both parties not to renew the contract.

On February 12, 2010, Time Warner Cable announced that Capital News 9 and News 10 Now would be rebranded as &quot;YNN&quot; (for &quot;Your News Now&quot;), adopting the same brand that had already been in use on their sister channels in Buffalo and Rochester (the former of which was the first to adopt the &quot;YNN&quot; brand when it launched in March 2009). The rebranding occurred in March 2010. The following month in April 2010, the channel launched a subfeed for the Hudson Valley region, YNN Hudson Valley.
On December 16, 2013, the channel rebranded as Time Warner Cable News Capital Region as part of a branding standardization across the provider&#x27;s news channels that included the introduction of a new graphics and music package. The channel&#x27;s Hudson Valley sub feed was accordingly rebranded from YNN Hudson Valley to Time Warner Cable News Hudson Valley.

With the acquisition of TWC by Charter Communications in 2016, the &quot;Time Warner Cable News&quot; branding has been dropped from all networks in favor of &quot;Spectrum News&quot;, after Charter&#x27;s primary consumer brand on September 20, 2016.

On July 27, 2018, the New York Public Service Commission revoked Charter&#x27;s cable franchises in the state of New York, citing failures to meet conditions imposed on the provider as part of the TWC purchase. Despite the revocation of Charter&#x27;s cable franchises in New York, the future fate of Spectrum News Capital Region after Spectrum&#x27;s exit from New York State is currently unknown.

In May 2021, the channel was re-branded again to Spectrum News 1 Capital Region.

<text>Roberto Marcano Cherubini (June 7, 1951 – November 13, 1990) was a Venezuelan professional baseball player in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) and for Tiburones de La Guaira in the Venezuelan Winter League.

Born in El Clavo, Marcano played minor league baseball in the United States from to , first with the Cleveland Indians organization, and later with the California Angels organization. During the MLB off-seasons he also played for Tiburones de La Guaira steadily from 1969 to 1985.

In , Marcano went to Japan, where he joined the Hankyu Braves as a second baseman. With Marcano putting up big numbers, the Braves went to four straight Japan Series, winning the first three (the first championships in the franchise&#x27;s history). Marcano played for Hankyu for eight years, then joined the Yakult Swallows for another three. Over the course of his NPB career, Marcano was awarded four Golden Gloves, and was named to the Best Nine four times. He is noted by many sources as being one of the best foreign-born players in Japanese baseball.

Marcano played outfield for Tiburones de La Guaira (representing Venezuela) in the 1983 Caribbean Series.

After retiring from the game, Marcano worked for the Yomiuri Giants as a scout and translator.

Marcano died at age 39, shortly after being diagnosed with cancer. His number 15 jersey was retired by Tiburones de La Guaira.

<doc id="1312640" wikidata="Q3618572" url="?curid=1312640" title="Anti System">
<text>Anti System is an English punk rock band from Bradford, West Yorkshire, England.

==History==
Formed in Bradford in 1982, the original line-up consisted of Phil, George, Dom and Dave Damned on vocals. Following their first gig at the Palm Cove in Bradford on September 14, 1982 (with Friktion Agitators, The End and Complete Disorder), Dave Damned was replaced by Nogsy (Simon Nolan). The band recorded a demo at Lion Studios in Leeds which led to them being signed to Marcus Featherby&#x27;s Pax Records. 

Anti System recorded a session at Cargo Studios from which the tracks &quot;Mansworld&quot; and &quot;Breakout&quot; were chosen to appear the Pax Records compilation album &quot;Punk Dead - Nah Mate, The Smell Is Jus Summink In Yer Underpants Innit&quot; in early 1983.

Their next release was the five-track &quot;Defence of the Realm&quot; EP. By this time George had been replaced on bass by former Raw guitarist Mickey Knowles although he appears on two of the five tracks.

This line-up also played on the tracks &quot;Schoolboy&quot; and &quot;Why Should It Happen&quot; which appeared on the compilation &quot;Bollox To The Gonads - Here&#x27;s The Testicles&quot;, also on Pax Records. 

By May 1983 Nogsy had been replaced by former Raw vocalist Liam Sheeran. During Liam&#x27;s time with the band a live album was recorded but remains unreleased. Both Mickey and Liam left in 1984 and former members of the band Subvert/Morbid Humour joined a new line-up.

In 1985, Anti System released a split single &quot;Strange Love/So Long As&quot; with Morbid Humour&#x27;s &quot;Oh, My God (Parts 1 &amp; 2)&quot; on the flip side. This was followed by the &quot;No Laughing Matter&quot; album and the 12&quot; &quot;A Look at Life&quot; EP on Reconciliation Records.

Like some other anarcho-punk bands of the time, the band were promoters of animal rights causes, their debut EP being a benefit for animal welfare groups and prior to the recording of the &quot;A Look at Life&quot; EP there was a necessity for a new line-up as two of the original members had been imprisoned for various animal rights actions. Mark Keane and Michael Teale were imprisoned in 1986, shortly after recording &quot;A Look at Life&quot;.

In 2009, a family tree and profile of the band was published in the book &quot;Bradford Noise of the Valleys Volume One - 1967-1987&quot;.

In 2012, guitarist Varik formed a new version the band with past members Mark Keane and Mickey Knowles.

==Musical style==
The band&#x27;s music has been categorised as anarcho punk and hardcore punk. In an article by DIY Conspiracy, they were referred to as one of the pioneers of UK82. Their lyrics often political, supporting anarchism and animal rights.

They have cited influences including Black Flag, Crass and Conflict.

<text>Foster Murrell Brooks 
(May 11, 1912 – December 20, 2001) was an American actor and comedian best known for his portrayal of a lovable drunk in nightclub performances and television programs.

==Early life==
Brooks was born in Louisville, Kentucky on May 11, 1912, to Edna (née Megowan) and Pleasant M. Brooks. He had seven brothers. His career started in radio, notably with station WHAS (AM) in Louisville. He was a staff announcer, and his deep baritone voice was also well-suited for singing. Brooks gained fame for his reporting of the Ohio River flood of 1937, where he was featured on emergency broadcasts by WHAS and also WSM (AM) from Nashville, Tennessee. In 1952, Brooks appeared on local TV in a short-lived spoof of Gene Autry and his &quot;Singing Cowboys&quot;.

He later worked in local broadcasting as a radio and TV personality at WHAM (AM) in Rochester, New York and at WGR &amp; WKBW in Buffalo, where he hosted &quot;The Musical Clock&quot; and &quot;Million Dollar Ballroom&quot;. In Buffalo, Brooks also performed with a country and western vocal group known as the Hi-Hatters. In 1997 Brooks was inducted into the Buffalo Broadcasters Association Hall of Fame. Moving to the West Coast, he launched a career as a stand-up comic and character actor.

In 1960, Brooks moved with his family to Los Angeles to seek more professional opportunities. During this time, he appeared on television comedies such as &quot;The Munsters&quot;, &quot;The Monkees&quot; and &quot;Bewitched&quot;. Brooks also delivered Christmas mail and phone books, and managed an apartment building in North Hollywood. In addition, he worked as a security guard for the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team.

On the syndicated &quot;Steve Allen Show&quot; of the 1960s, Allen introduced Brooks as an important movie producer. Brooks stumbled on stage doing his drunk act, fooling some of the other guests. Brooks claimed to be the executive in charge of editing movies for television. His biggest success, he said, was the famous movie &quot;The Three Commandments&quot;. His character also claimed to have invented the concept of removing clips from the movies and inserting commercials.

In 1969, game show icon and television personality Dennis James took his friend Brooks to a North Carolina charity golf tournament to tell some jokes, and then introduced Brooks to good friend, singer Perry Como, who in turn gave the comedian his major break. Como chose Brooks to open for him at a Las Vegas hotel. When the hotel&#x27;s owners balked at Como&#x27;s choice due to Brooks&#x27; age and lack of fame, Como insisted and the owners acquiesced. Brooks was an instant hit. He made his first appearance soon thereafter on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;.

==Career==
Brooks regularly appeared on &quot;The Dean Martin Show&quot; television program in the 1970s (for which he garnered an Emmy Award nomination in 1974) as well as many situation comedies and talk shows, (including &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;). Mr. Brooks appeared many times on the Bill Cosby variety show in 1972.

His signature routine was the basis of a hit comedy album titled &quot;Foster Brooks, The Lovable Lush&quot;, released in the early 1970s. As his &quot;Lovable Lush&quot; character, Brooks usually portrayed a conventioneer who had had a few too many drinks—not falling-down drunk, but inebriated enough to mix up his words and burp to comedic delight. Brooks is best remembered for his appearances on &quot;The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast&quot; during the 1970s, where he roasted other comedians, such as Don Rickles, Johnny Carson and Lucille Ball, and serious public figures such as writer Truman Capote, consumer activist Ralph Nader, and former vice president Hubert Humphrey.

During his period of greatest fame, Brooks rarely drank. Of giving up drinking to win a bet in 1964, Brooks said, &quot;A fellow made me a $10 bet I couldn&#x27;t quit, and I haven&#x27;t had a drink since. At the time I needed the $10.&quot;

He would occasionally make cameo appearances in which his character was perfectly sober, such as his appearance in a 1968 episode of &quot;Adam-12&quot; playing a strait-laced citizen who tries to get out of a parking ticket by dropping the name of an officer senior to the main characters. He also played the character Harry Sachs in a 1969 episode of &quot;Adam-12&quot; in which he performed as a highly intoxicated man standing in the middle of a street, waving his suit jacket at oncoming traffic, as if he were a bullfighter. In a later &quot;Adam-12&quot; episode, he plays a stoned man, stopped for erratic driving, who tries to hide the burning marijuana &quot;joint&quot; in his suit&#x27;s front pocket. In a more serious &quot;Adam-12&quot; appearance, he portrayed a drunken driver who killed another driver in an accident on Christmas Eve.

On the comedy series &quot;Green Acres&quot; in the 1969 episode &quot;Economy Flight to Washington&quot;, Brooks&#x27; boozy, bobble-headed character meets and befriends the pig Arnold Ziffel in a hotel bar. In the scene, ostensibly through the haze of alcohol, Brooks mistakes the anthropomorphic pig for a U.S. Air Force lieutenant, since the animal is sitting on a bar stool and is wearing a white leather aviator&#x27;s cap, goggles, and a red scarf. Brooks acted again on &quot;Green Acres&quot; in 1969, this time giving a &quot;sober&quot; performance as Charlie Williams, a chemist, in the episode &quot;The Milk Maker.&quot; The following year he returned to his whiskey-soaked persona on the television western &quot;The High Chaparral&quot;. Brooks asked Dean Martin to join his group &quot;Alcoholics Unanimous,&quot; a play on Alcoholics Anonymous. He boasted he and Martin were charter members of the DUI (Driving Under the Influence) Hall of Fame.

In the 1970s, Brooks appeared as a celebrity panelist on the game shows &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; and &quot;Match Game&quot;, and in 1979, he appeared in the film &quot;The Villain&quot; as a bank clerk.

Public sensibilities had changed regarding alcoholics and public drunkenness by the 1980s, so Brooks moved away from his drunken character. In 1983, Brooks appeared in the film &quot;Cannonball Run II&quot; with comedians Louis Nye and Sid Caesar as fishermen in a rowboat. He had a recurring role as Mr. Sternhagen, Mindy&#x27;s boss on &quot;Mork &amp; Mindy&quot;. His name was a moniker on a Louisville celebrity golf tournament benefiting Kosair Charities. Brooks was a Shriner and member of the Al Malaikah Shriners, Los Angeles. He also made occasional guest appearances on TV shows in which he would demonstrate his singing voice.

Brooks&#x27; last performance was at a celebrity roast in Las Vegas for Zsa Zsa Gabor.

==Later career and legacy==
Years later Brooks was referred to on the Cartoon Network television show &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot; (episode 45, &quot;Switcheroo II&quot;). He was featured in a scene that was cut before being aired, but the scene was later included on the &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot; volume 3 DVD release. He is also referenced on an episode of &quot;Get a Life&quot; called &quot;Paperboy 2000&quot;. On the March 1, 2010, episode of &quot;The Daily Show&quot;, Jon Stewart referred to Senator Sheldon Whitehouse&#x27;s mispronunciation of a constituent&#x27;s name by saying, &quot;It&#x27;s not supposed to end on a Foster Brooks hiccup.&quot; He was mentioned in the lyrics of a Loudon Wainwright song, &quot;Drinks Before Dinner.&quot;

==Personal life==
Brooks was first married to Loretta Brooks, with whom he had a son and three daughters; one daughter died in infancy. Foster and Loretta divorced in 1950. That same year, he married Teri Brooks, with whom he had two daughters. Brooks&#x27; brother, Tom, was a well-known entertainer in Louisville for many years. Brooks&#x27;s nephew Randy Brooks is a comedy songwriter, best known for his composition &quot;Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer,&quot; recorded by Randy&#x27;s friend Elmo Shropshire.

==Death==
Brooks died on December 20, 2001, at his home in Encino, California, from heart failure. He was 89 years old.

<doc id="1312653" wikidata="Q5902829" url="?curid=1312653" title="Horatio Walpole, 1st Baron Walpole">
<text>Horatio Walpole, 1st Baron Walpole, (8 December 16785 February 1757) was an English diplomat, politician and peer who served as the British ambassador to France from 1724 to 1730. He was the son of Robert Walpole and the younger brother of Robert Walpole, the first Prime Minister of Great Britain.

== Family ==
The Walpoles owned land in Norfolk in the 12th century and took their name from Walpole, a village in the county. An early member of the family was Ralph de Walpole, bishop of Norwich from 1288 to 1299, and bishop of Ely from 1299 until his death on 20 March 1302. Among its later members were three brothers, Edward (1560–1637), Richard (1564–1607) and Michael (1570–1624), all members of the Society of Jesus. Another Jesuit in the family was Henry Walpole (1558–1595), who wrote &quot;An Epitaph of the life and death of the most famous clerk and virtuous priest Edmund Campion&quot; and was tortured and put to death on 17 April 1595.

== Political career ==
Born at Houghton and educated at Eton and King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, Horatio Walpole became a fellow of King&#x27;s. He entered Parliament in 1702, remaining a member for fifty-four years. In 1715, when his brother, Sir Robert, became first lord of the treasury, he was made Secretary to the Treasury, and in 1716, having already had some experience of the kind, he went on a diplomatic mission to The Hague. He left office with his brother in 1717, but he was soon in harness again, becoming secretary to the lord-lieutenant of Ireland in 1720 and Secretary to the Treasury a second time in 1721.

In 1722 he was again at The Hague, and in 1723 he went to Paris, where in the following year he was appointed envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary. He got on intimate terms with Fleury and seconded his brother in his efforts to maintain friendly relations with France; he represented Great Britain at the congress of Soissons and helped to conclude the treaty of Seville (November 1729). He left Paris in 1730 and in 1734 went to represent his country at The Hague, where he remained until 1740, using all his influence in the cause of European peace. He was nonetheless able to stay involved in the affairs of the capital. He served, for example, in 1739, as a founding governor for London&#x27;s most fashionable charity of the time, the Foundling Hospital.
After the fall of Sir Robert Walpole in 1742, Horatio defended his conduct in the House of Commons of Great Britain and also in a pamphlet, &quot;The Interest of Great Britain steadily pursued&quot;. Later he wrote an &quot;Apology&quot;, dealing with his own conduct from 1715 to 1739, and an &quot;Answer to the latter part of Lord Bolingbroke&#x27;s letters on the study of history&quot; (printed 1763).

In 1724 he engaged Thomas Ripley to design him a new house at Wolterton in Norfolk to replace one that had burnt down. The house called Wolterton Hall was completed in 1742.

In 1756 he was created Baron Walpole, of Wolterton and he died 5February 1757 at his house in Whitehall.

== Personal life ==
He married Mary Magdalen Lombard on 21 July 1720. They had nine children:
*Horatio Walpole, 2nd Baron Walpole (1723–1809), created Earl of Orford in 1806
*The Hon. Mary Walpole (born 25 February 1726), who married Maurice Suckling.
*The Hon. Thomas Walpole (6 October 1727 – March 1803), who married Elizabeth Vanneck (died 9 June 1760) on 14 November 1753, and had issue.
*The Hon. Richard Walpole (5 December 1728 – 18 August 1798), who married Margaret Vanneck (before 1742 – 9 May 1818) on 22 November 1758, and had issue.
*Susan Walpole (3 May 1730 – 29 April 1732)
*The Hon. Henrietta Louisa Walpole (28 November 1731 – June 1824)
*The Hon. Anne Walpole (12 July 1733 – 25 November 1797)
*Caroline Walpole (22 November 1734 – 11 January 1737)
*The Hon. Robert Walpole (1736–1810)

<doc id="1312654" wikidata="Q1970283" url="?curid=1312654" title="Advanced z-transform">
<text>In mathematics and signal processing, the advanced z-transform is an extension of the z-transform, to incorporate ideal delays that are not multiples of the sampling time. The advanced z-transform is widely applied, for example, to accurately model processing delays in digital control. It is also known as the modified z-transform. 

It takes the form

:formula_1

where
* &quot;T&quot; is the sampling period
* &quot;m&quot; (the &quot;delay parameter&quot;) is a fraction of the sampling period formula_2

==Properties==
If the delay parameter, &quot;m&quot;, is considered fixed then all the properties of the z-transform hold for the advanced z-transform.

===Linearity===
:formula_3

===Time shift===
:formula_4

===Damping===
:formula_5

===Time multiplication===
:formula_6

===Final value theorem===
:formula_7

==Example==
Consider the following example where formula_8:

:formula_9

If formula_10 then formula_11 reduces to the transform

:formula_12

which is clearly just the &quot;z&quot;-transform of formula_13.

<doc id="1312669" wikidata="Q467175" url="?curid=1312669" title="Pinstriping">
<text>Pin striping (or pinstriping) is the application of a very thin line of paint or other material called a pin stripe, and is generally used for decoration. Freehand pin stripers use a specialty brush known as a pinstriping brush.

Automotive, bike shops, and do-it-yourself car and motorcycle mechanics use paint pin striping to create their own custom look on the automotive bodies and parts.

==Motorcycles==
Pin striping can commonly be seen exhibited on custom motorcycles, such as those built by Choppers Inc., Indian Larry, and West Coast Choppers. The decorative use of pin striping on motorcycles as it is commonly seen today was pioneered by artists Kenny Howard (a.k.a. Von Dutch), Dean Jeffries, Dennis &quot;Gibb&quot; Gibbish, and Ed &quot;Big Daddy&quot; Roth. These artists are considered pioneers of the Kustom Kulture lifestyle that spawned in the early 1950s, and are widely recognized as the &quot;originators of modern pin striping&quot;.

==Automobiles==

In automotive body work, pin stripes are a thin vinyl tape or paint. The tape versions are adhered directly to the painted surface in the pattern desired, whilst painted ones are done by skilled artists with &#x27;sword&#x27; shaped brushes. 

The goal of pin striping is to enhance the curves of the surface, and the lines are generally of a complementary color. In any other form of decorative pin stripes, the goal is the same. In addition and coincidentally, it can help to hide flaws in the surface such as a scratch or blemish.

Pin stripe décor is also applied to motorcycles, bicycles, semi trucks, boats, and surfboards. It is traditionally combined with freehand lettering and, to a lesser degree, sign making. The age of computers and vinyl decals helped undercut the base of traditional sign making and with it the traditional pin striper.

While stripers such as Von Dutch (Kenny Howard) and Ed &quot;Big Daddy&quot; Roth are possibly the best known early practitioners of &#x27;modern&#x27; pin striping, many of the early stripers cite Tommy &quot;The Greek&quot; Hrones and Dean Jeffries as their major influences. 

Pin striping is still practiced at shops around the world, and Rolls-Royce Motor Cars still pin stripes the &quot;coachline&quot; of that company&#x27;s cars by hand.

<text>&quot;&quot;, Op. 410 (&quot;Spring&#x27;s Voices,&quot; or commonly &quot;Voices of Spring&quot;; sometimes sung in Italian as &quot;Voci di primavera&quot;) is an orchestral waltz, with optional solo soprano voice, written in 1882 by Johann Strauss II.

==History==
Strauss dedicated the work to the pianist and composer Alfred Grünfeld. The famous coloratura soprano Bertha Schwarz (stage name Bianca Bianchi) sang this concert aria at a grand matinée charity performance at the Theater an der Wien in aid of the &quot;Emperor Franz Joseph and Empress Elisabeth Foundation for Indigent Austro-Hungarian subjects in Leipzig&quot;. The waltz was not a great success at its premiere, but was more successful when performed on Strauss&#x27; tour of Russia in 1886. A piano arrangement by the composer contributed much to its success beyond Vienna. Grünfeld, the work&#x27;s dedicatee and a pianist and composer in his own right, also wrote and recorded his own concert transcription of the work for solo piano.

Bianca Bianchi was then a famous member of the Vienna Court Opera Theatre and Strauss was sufficiently inspired to compose a new work, a waltz for solo voice, for the acclaimed singer. The result was his &quot;Frühlingsstimmen&quot; waltz which celebrated spring and remained one of the classical repertoire&#x27;s most famous waltzes. The piece is sometimes used as an insertion aria in the act 2 ball scene of Strauss&#x27; operetta &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot;.

==Music==

The waltz makes a grand entry in the key of B-flat major with loud chords preceded with the waltz&#x27;s three beats to the bar ushering the first waltz&#x27;s gentle and swirling melody. The second waltz section, in E-flat major invokes the joys of spring with the flute imitating birdsong and a pastoral scene. The plaintive and dramatic third section in A-flat major and later in C minor probably suggests spring showers whereas the fourth section that follows breaks out from the pensive mood with another cheerful melody in A-flat major. The familiar first waltz melody makes a grand re-entrance, with Coda section, featuring a mocking imitation between the winds, and the strings, before its breathless finish, strong chords and the usual timpani drumroll and warm brass flourish. This is one of the very few Strauss Waltzes that ends, following the cadenza, on a struck quick Major chord. (B-Flat Major). A performance lasts between seven and nine minutes.

==Instrumentation==

The piece is scored for flute, piccolo, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 2 trumpets, 3 trombones, timpani, bass drum, military drum, harp, strings, and optional solo soprano voice.

==Lyrics==
The lyrics were created by Richard Genée (1823–1895).
==Frühlingsstimmen in popular culture==
*&quot;Frühlingsstimmen&quot; is probably best known today from its use by the American slapstick comedy team The Three Stooges in their short films &quot;Micro-Phonies&quot; and &quot;Brideless Groom&quot;. In the former short, it is sung by Christine McIntyre. The idea for using it probably came from her, as she had sung it in an earlier &#x27;soundie&#x27; sing-a-long short in which she featured. The audience was encouraged to keep quiet when McIntyre was singing the &#x27;Voices of Spring&#x27; number.
*Musical films with the name &quot;Frühlingsstimmen&quot; were made in Austria in 1933 (with music by Oscar Straus) and in 1952 (with music by Alfred Uhl).
*The waltz was choreographed as a ballet by Sir Frederick Ashton, under the name &quot;Voices of Spring&quot;.

<text>Jungle Cubs is an American animated series produced by Walt Disney Television Animation for ABC in 1996, serving as the prequel to the 1967 film &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; as it&#x27;s set in the youth of the animal characters years before the events of the film. The show was a hit, running for two seasons on ABC from 1996 to 1998 before its syndication in re-runs on the Disney Channel. The show was broadcast on Toon Disney, but was taken off the schedule in 2001. Re-runs aired on Disney Junior in the US from 2012 to 2013. The show also aired in the United Kingdom on Disney Cinemagic and in Latin America.

The show&#x27;s theme song is a hip hop version of the song, &quot;The Bare Necessities&quot; performed by Lou Rawls. &quot;Jungle Cubs&quot; was animated by Walt Disney Television Animation (Australia) Pty. Ltd., Wang Film Productions Co., Ltd., Thai Wang Film Productions Co., Ltd., Toon City Animation, Inc., and Sunmin Image Pictures Co., Ltd., with Studio B Productions, as the animation pre-production studio of the series.

==Characters==

* Baloo (voiced by Pamela Adlon) is a fun-loving sloth bear. He likes to play with his friends and sometimes pulls pranks on Bagheera in order to snap the latter out of his uptight attitude. 
* Bagheera (voiced by Elizabeth Daily in Season 1 and Dee Bradley Baker in Season 2) is a sensible and level-headed panther who stays out of trouble. He has an obsession with maintaining good personal hygiene. Bagheera is affectionately known as &quot;Baggy&quot; or &quot;Bags&quot; and is the youngest of the group. Despite having a Home Counties English accent in the original film, Bagheera speaks with an American accent in the series. 
* Louie (voiced by Jason Marsden in Season 1 and Cree Summer in Season 2) is an orangutan. He is very physically active, spending a great deal of his time in the trees and eating bananas, and wants to become king of the jungle one day, and when any man made objects turn up he immediately shows great interest.
* Shere Khan (voiced by Jason Marsden) is an arrogant and hot-tempered Bengal tiger. He often tries to intimidate the other animals, but his confidence suffers when faced with actual problems. He is often called &quot;Khannie&quot; by Baloo and Louie. Despite having a well-spoken English accent in the original film, Shere Khan speaks with an American accent in the series.
* Kaa (voiced by Jim Cummings) is a young Indian python who wants to hypnotize other animals, but his skills at hypnosis are unpredictable.
* Hathi (voiced by Rob Paulsen in Season 1 and Stephen Furst in Season 2) is an elephant who attempts to keep the group in order but is known to stammer when stressed. He has a huge crush on Winifred, who is his wife in &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;. He is often called &quot;Little Peanut&quot; by Baloo. Despite having a strong southern English accent in the original film, Hathi speaks with an American accent in the series.
* Cecil (voiced by Michael McKean) and Arthur (voiced by David Lander) are two vultures who are constantly hoping for one of the cubs to die so that they can eat them, but they are never seen as a threat. 
* Mahra (voiced by Tress MacNeille) is a ruthless baboon that lives in Pinnacle Rock within the wasteland. She and her three incompetent sons have often antagonized the Jungle Cubs when they enter the wasteland. One particular instance is when she and her sons return from a long journey and she wants a new animal skin blanket after her old one is destroyed.
** Ned (voiced by Charlie Adler) is one of Mahra&#x27;s sons.
** Jed (voiced by Jim Cummings) is the leader of Mahra&#x27;s sons.
** Fred (voiced by Jim Cummings) is the largest and most dull-witted of Mahra&#x27;s sons.

==Locations==
* The Cub House, a small temple that the gang and friends use as a club house.
* The Wasteland, a huge area surrounding the jungle. Not many animals live out here, except for birds of prey, insects, porcupines and baboons, such as Mahra and her three sons, who live there. It is also where an evil dictator turtle lives.
* Pinnacle Rock, a tall pinnacle-shaped rock in The Wasteland. This large rock is the of Mahra and her sons.
* The River, a large river that is where a lot of animals drink at and live at. Arthur &amp; Cecil&#x27;s nest and cliff are near here.
* The Man Village, a large village inhabited by humans.
* Wangjanga Gorge or The Honey Cliffs, an enormous gorge with a stream running through it. It is also called &quot;The Honey Cliffs&quot; because a lot of bees nest on the gorge&#x27;s cliffs. It appears to have a bad reputation, since it is mentioned by Louie that no one had been down here and lived to tell the tale, but during the red dog invasion, Baloo and Kaa managed to survive when they were chased by the resident bees.
* The Middle Jungle, a deeply hidden area with only one entrance, the throne in The Cub House. Once the snake-like lever has been pulled, the throne moves to reveal a hidden doorway going underground. Once one has travelled down the underground river, they emerge from a large crack in the ground which is in The Middle Jungle. There are the ruins of an old city up ahead and that is where the treasure is hidden, but it is being guarded by a giant white cobra named Whitehood.
* The Quicksand Bog is mentioned in &quot;Fool Me Once...&quot;.
* Creepy Deepy Swamp, a dark and scary looking swamp near the heart of the jungle. A sarus crane lives here.
* The Mountains, tall, high, snowy mountains that provide the river with water. It is also where a female bighorn sheep lives.
* The Western Jungle, the west side of the jungle. This is where a sloth and his woodpecker friends live.
* Baboon Lagoon, a lagoon where some baboons live. These particular baboons are friends with the water buffalo.
* The Great Lost Temple, an old temple that is used as a music concert.

<text>THYMOVAR is a product to control the Varroa mite (&quot;Varroa destructor&quot;) on bees (&quot;Apis mellifera&quot;) and contains the essential oil thymol.

THYMOVAR contains thymol, a volatile substance which sublimates in the air depending on temperature. On release, thymol vapour concentrations build up in the treated beehive. These vapours are highly toxic to varroa mites but concentrations are not high enough to harm the honey bees. For optimal control, appropriate concentrations of thymol vapour must be maintained for six to eight weeks.

==Uses==

===Temperature===
Best efficacy is achieved when maximum daytime temperatures are between 20 °C and 25 °C throughout treatment. Reduced product efficacy occurs if average temperatures fall below 15 °C during the treatment.
Do not apply if outside temperatures exceed 30 °C. Treatment at temperatures in excess of 30 °C leads to increased stress and mortality of adult bees and brood.

===Time of treatment===
The best time for THYMOVAR treatment is as soon as possible after the last honey harvest in late summer at recommended temperatures. Treat all hives in an apiary at the same time to avoid robbing behaviour.

===Application===
Prior to THYMOVAR treatment, remove all honey supers, close or replace open or screened hive floors with solid floors, and reduce the hive entrances to normal size. It is recommended that part of the feeding is carried out before the treatment, if the infestation of varroa and the temperatures allow.

Begin the 1st application of a treatment by placing appropriate number of bee-hive strips (positions shown in Fig. 1) on top of combs of the brood chamber (upper brood chamber if two). Bee-hive strips should be close to, but not directly over open or sealed brood (preferable distance &gt; 4 cm).
Close the hive, leaving space (about 5 mm) between the bee-hive strips and the hive cover to improve the evaporation of thymol.
Do not place plastic cover foils directly on the bee-hive strips. Remove the 1st set of depleted THYMOVAR wafers after 3–4 weeks.

Begin the 2nd application immediately with a new set of bee-hive strips in appropriate numbers and positions, as shown in Fig. 1.
Remove these bee-hive strips when they are depleted at the end of the 2nd 3-4 week application period.

==Concept of Control==
A combined application of THYMOVAR with an oxalic acid treatment in the broodless time (November - December) has proved very efficient against the Varroa. Through volatilisation, thymol vapour concentrations build up in the hive. These are highly toxic to the varroa mites, but do not harm the bees. Detailed information can be found at Andermatt BioVet AG.

<doc id="1312713" wikidata="Q7952834" url="?curid=1312713" title="WMHT (TV)">
<text>WMHT (channel 17) is a television station licensed to Schenectady, New York, United States, serving the Capital District as a member of PBS. It is owned by WMHT Educational Telecommunications alongside NPR member WMHT-FM (89.1). The two stations share studios in the Rensselaer Technology Park in North Greenbush (with a Troy mailing address); the TV station&#x27;s transmitter is located in the Helderberg Escarpment in New Scotland.

WMHT operates digital translator W23ER-D (channel 23) in Poughkeepsie (part of the New York City market). The translator&#x27;s ownership was transferred from Dutchess Community College to WMHT in 2014.

==History==
The Mohawk-Hudson Council on Educational Television was formed in 1953, through financial support from commercial station WRGB (channel 6), its then-parent company General Electric (which was based in Schenectady) and many supporters and local businesses in the Albany/Capital Region. In the beginning, Mohawk-Hudson produced educational programs on WRGB; however, due to the station&#x27;s tight scheduling, the council decided to form a non-commercial educational television station of its own. WMHT signed on the air on March 26, 1962, on UHF channel 17 as the second educational TV station in the state of New York (after WNED in Buffalo). From the outset the station was a member of National Educational Television (NET) and became one of PBS&#x27; charter members after the two stations merged in 1970. In 1972, WMHT expanded into FM radio by launching the first non-commercial classical music station in the United States (a format that continues to this day).

In 1987, WMHT purchased the assets of independent station WUSV (channel 45) and made it a secondary programming service under the calls WMHX. Due to financial difficulties, WMHT shut WMHX down in 1991 and returned it to the air three years later under the call letters WMHQ. In the late 1990s, WMHQ&#x27;s commercial license became attractive and WMHT sold it to the Tribune Company for $18.5 million in 1999 with the station becoming WB affiliate WEWB that September (it is now CW affiliate WCWN, owned by the Sinclair Broadcast Group). The money from this sale allowed WMHT to expand into digital television. It also allowed the station to replace its original facility in Rotterdam with a state-of-the-art facility in the Rensselaer Tech Park in town of North Greenbush, New York.

==Programming==
Programming produced by WMHT includes the state public affairs show &quot;New York NOW&quot;. The program is also aired on all public Television and radio stations across the state of New York in addition to being aired online and in a podcast format.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:
===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WMHT shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 17 at noon on April 16, 2009. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 34, using virtual channel 17. During the 2019 digital television repack, WMHT relocated from UHF channel 34 to channel 25.

===Translator===
* Poughkeepsie

<doc id="1312715" wikidata="Q212043" url="?curid=1312715" title="Kalsoy">
<text>Kalsoy (, ) is an island in the north-east of the Faroe Islands of Denmark between Eysturoy and Kunoy. The name means man island; by contrast with the parallel island to the east, Kunoy, the name of which means woman island.

The northernmost part and scenery of Kalsoy was used as stand-in for the Kuril Islands in eastern Russia while filming for the 25th James Bond movie &quot;No Time to Die&quot;. In the film, which was released in 2021, the villain&#x27;s lair is located on the island, for which a harbour and missile silos were added digitally.

Kalsoy, like Svínoy, is a comparatively isolated island, in that no bridge, tunnel, or causeway links to it.

== Geography ==
The western coast has steep cliffs for the full length of the island, whereas valleys on the eastern slopes protect the four tiny settlements, Húsar, Mikladalur, Syðradalur, and Trøllanes, whose combined populations total less than 80. They are connected by a partly surfaced road which passes through four dark tunnels. The island&#x27;s thin shape and road tunnels give it the nickname &quot;the recorder&quot; (). A lighthouse is located at Kallur, the northern tip of Kalsoy.

=== Important bird area ===
The northern and western coastline of the island has been identified as an important bird area by BirdLife International because of its significance as a breeding site for seabirds, especially Atlantic puffins (40,000 pairs), European storm petrels (5000 pairs), and black guillemots (200 pairs).


=== Mountains ===
The island has 13 peaks, the two highest of which are Nestindar (787 m) and Botnstindur (743 m).

== Travel ==
Ferry landings occur at Syðradalur, and one of the mail boats (named &quot;Sam&quot;) makes regular trips from Klaksvík to both settlements. One can walk north all the way to the lighthouse at Kallur but the four unlit tunnels on the way make carrying a torch advisable. Traffic is insufficient to pose problems with exhaust gases. The northernmost tunnel through to Trøllanes is narrow, cold, damp, and over 2 km long. It is rarely used by vehicles since the population of Trøllanes is only 20. The alternative overland route from Mikladalur to Trøllanes is a dangerous and precipitous path that is best avoided.

Bus service between Húsar and Trøllanes also is provided.
== Legends ==
Kalsoy has many legends, the best known of which is the legend of the Selkie or Seal-Woman of Mikladalur.

A young farmer from the town of Mikladalur on Kalsoy Island went to the beach to watch the selkies dance. He hid the skin of a beautiful selkie maid, so she could not go back to sea, and forced her to marry him. He kept her skin in a chest and the key with him both day and night. One day when out fishing, he discovered that he had forgotten to bring his key. When he returned home, the selkie wife had escaped back to sea, leaving their children behind. Later, when the farmer was out on a hunt, he killed both her selkie husband and two selkie sons, and she promised to take revenge upon the men of Mikladalur. Some shall be drowned, some shall fall from cliffs and slopes, and this shall continue, until so many men have been lost that they will be able to link arms around the whole island of Kalsoy; occasional deaths still occur in this way on the island.

This revenge has always been taken seriously, not only in Kalsoy, but also in the Faroe Islands generally. The descendants of the Seal-Woman are still known in the country by certain characteristics, especially their short fingers.

<doc id="1312729" wikidata="Q283917" url="?curid=1312729" title="Formamide">
<text>Formamide is an amide derived from formic acid. It is a colorless liquid which is miscible with water and has an ammonia-like odor. It is chemical feedstock for the manufacture of sulfa drugs and other pharmaceuticals, herbicides and pesticides, and in the manufacture of hydrocyanic acid. It has been used as a softener for paper and fiber. It is a solvent for many ionic compounds. It has also been used as a solvent for resins and plasticizers. Some astrobiologists suggest that it may be an alternative to water as the main solvent in other forms of life.

Formamides are compounds of the type RR′NCHO. One important formamide is dimethylformamide, (CH3)2NCHO.

==Production==
===Historical production===
In the past, formamide was produced by treating formic acid with ammonia, which produces ammonium formate, which in turn yields formamide upon heating:
: HCOOH + NH3 → 
: → HCONH2 + H2O

Formamide is also generated by aminolysis of ethyl formate:
:HCOOCH2CH3 + NH3 → HCONH2 + CH3CH2OH

===Modern production===
The current industrial process for the manufacture of formamide involves the carbonylation of ammonia:
:CO + NH3 → HCONH2

An alternative two-stage process involves the ammonolysis of methyl formate, which is formed from carbon monoxide and methanol:
:CO + CH3OH → HCOOCH3
:HCO2CH3 + NH3 → HCONH2 + CH3OH

==Applications==
Formamide is used in the industrial production of hydrogen cyanide. It is also used as a solvent for processing various polymers such as polyacrylonitrile.

===Reactions===
Formamide decomposes into carbon monoxide and ammonia when heated above 100 °C. 
:HCONH2 → CO + NH3
The reaction is slow below 160 °C, but accelerates thereafter. At very high temperatures, the reaction products shift to hydrogen cyanide (HCN) and water instead:
:HC(O)NH2 → HCN + H2O
The same effect occurs in the presence of solid acid catalysts.

===Niche or laboratory applications===
Formamide is a constituent of cryoprotectant vitrification mixtures used for cryopreservation of tissues and organs.

Formamide is also used as an RNA stabiliser in gel electrophoresis by deionizing RNA. In capillary electrophoresis, it is used for stabilizing (single) strands of denatured DNA.

Another use is to add it in sol-gel solutions in order to avoid cracking during sintering.

Formamide, in its pure state, has been used as an alternative solvent for the electrostatic self-assembly of polymer nanofilms.

Formamide is used to prepare primary amines directly from ketones via their N-formyl derivatives, using the Leuckart reaction.

==Biochemistry==

Formamides are intermediates in the methanogenesis cycle.

===Prebiotic chemistry===

Formamide has been proposed as an alternative solvent to water, perhaps with the ability to support life with alternative biochemistries to that currently found on Earth. It forms by the hydrolysis of hydrogen cyanide. With a large dipole moment, its solvation properties are similar to those of water.

Formamide has been shown to convert to traces of guanine upon heating in the presence of ultraviolet light.

Several prebiotic chemical reactions producing amino acid derivatives have been shown to take place in formamide.

==Safety==
Contact with skin and eyes is not recommended. With an LD50 of grams per kg, formamide is of low acute toxicity. It also has low mutagenicity.

Formamide is classified as toxic to reproductive health.

<doc id="1312730" wikidata="Q551136" url="?curid=1312730" title="Charles Haley">
<text>Charles Lewis Haley (born January 6, 1964) is an American former professional football player who was a defensive end and linebacker in the National Football League (NFL) for the San Francisco 49ers (1986–1991, 1998–1999) and Dallas Cowboys (1992–1996).

A versatile defensive player, Haley began his career as a specialty outside linebacker, then played as a defensive end because of a defensive scheme change from the 3–4 to the 4–3 defense. He was the first five-time Super Bowl champion; only Tom Brady, with seven titles, has won more. He won two Super Bowls with the 49ers (XXIII, XXIV) and three with the Cowboys (XXVII, XXVIII, XXX); starting in all five championship games. Haley was inducted to the College Football Hall of Fame in 2011 and the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2015.

==Early life==
Haley was born in Gladys, Virginia. He attended William Campbell High School in Naruna, Virginia, where he was a three-year starter for the football team, playing linebacker and tight end. As a senior, he received defensive player of the year honors, All-Region III and All-Group AA accolades, while helping the team win the Seminole District championship. He also played basketball and was an All-district selection.

==College career==
Haley was not highly recruited at the start of his senior season, so he accepted a scholarship from James Madison University, which at the time was the only Division I-A or I-AA school to make an offer. He was named a starter at defensive end / linebacker as a freshman, posting 85 tackles (second on the team), 5 sacks, 6 passes defensed, and 4 forced fumbles.

The next year, Haley was moved to inside linebacker, making 143 tackles (led the team) and 4 sacks. As a junior, he tallied 147 tackles (led the team), 3 sacks and 2 interceptions. In his final year he was switched to outside linebacker for the last four games, registering 131 tackles (second on the team), 5 quarterback sacks, 3 blocked kicks, and one interception.

Haley was a two-time Division I-AA All-American and finished his career with 506 tackles (school record), 17 sacks, and 3 interceptions. Haley is a member of the Xi Delta chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity at James Madison.

==Professional career==

===San Francisco 49ers (first stint)===
Haley was selected by the San Francisco 49ers in the fourth round (96th overall) of the 1986 NFL draft, after dropping because he was initially timed at 4.8 seconds in the 40-yard dash, although he was later clocked by a 49ers scout at 4.55 seconds. He played outside linebacker in a 3–4 defense, finished second behind Leslie O&#x27;Neal for rookies with 12 sacks and was voted to the NFL All-Rookie team by &quot;Pro Football Weekly&quot; and the United Press International. The following year, he played again in a designated pass rusher role, coming into the game in likely passing situations, while making 25 tackles and 6.5 sacks.

In 1988, Haley was named the starter at left outside linebacker, registering 69 tackles, 11.5 sacks and would hold that spot through the 1991 season. The next year, he tallied 57 tackles and 10.5 sacks.

In 1990, Haley had 58 tackles and 9 passes defensed. He was third in the league with 16 sacks, voted the UPI NFC Defensive Player of the Year, and a consensus All-Pro.

In 1991, Haley&#x27;s relationship with the organization began to deteriorate after safety Ronnie Lott was left unprotected—eligible to sign with any team under Plan B free agency. He still recorded 53 tackles, 6 passes defensed, 2 forced fumbles and 7 sacks, tying for the team lead with Larry Roberts. While with the 49ers from 1986 to 1991, he led the team in sacks every season, and played on the Super Bowl XXIII and Super Bowl XXIV championship teams.

On August 26, 1992, Haley&#x27;s volatile temperament and clashes with head coach George Seifert prompted the team to trade him to the Dallas Cowboys in exchange for a 1993 second round selection (#56-Vincent Brisby) and a 1994 third round selection (#99-Alai Kalaniuvalu).

===Dallas Cowboys===
In 1992, Haley was moved to right defensive end in the Dallas Cowboys 4–3 defense, made 39 tackles, 6 sacks, and 42 quarterback pressures (led the team), and helped the team improve from 17th in total defense in 1991 to first. Haley received the UPI NFC Defensive Player of the Year Award and was a consensus All-Pro once again. He is often mentioned as the final piece that helped propel the Cowboys into a Super Bowl contender.

In 1993, Haley made headlines after smashing his helmet through a concrete wall in the locker room following a home loss to the Buffalo Bills, showing his displeasure with the team&#x27;s inability to sign holdout running back Emmitt Smith, which contributed to an 0–2 start and put the season in jeopardy. The Cowboys relented and reached an agreement with Smith the following week, getting them back on track and making them the first team to win a Super Bowl after starting a season 0–2. Haley registered 41 tackles, 4 sacks, 2 passes defensed, and 3 forced fumbles, but his recurring back problems began to require a series of surgeries.

In 1994, Haley recovered from off-season surgery (lumbar microdiscectomy) to post 68 tackles, 12.5 sacks, and 52 quarterback pressures. He immediately announced his retirement after losing 38–28 to the 49ers in the NFC Championship game, but decided to return after being offered a new contract.

In 1995, Haley posted 10.5 sacks, 33 quarterback pressures, and 35 tackles in the first 10 games, until suffering a ruptured disk against the Washington Redskins, which derailed his season. He started in Super Bowl XXX six weeks after having back surgery, making one sack, 3 quarterback pressures, and 5 tackles. The next year, with the team trying to limit him to 30 plays per game, he appeared in the first three contests and in week 9 and 10 before being deactivated with a back injury. He retired after the season, because of his back injuries and his youngest daughter Brianna being diagnosed with leukemia.

===San Francisco 49ers (second stint)===
On January 2, 1999, Haley was signed by the 49ers after being out of football for almost two years to provide depth for an injury depleted defensive line in the playoffs (2 games). He was re-signed for the 1999 season and tallied 3 sacks.

=== Career statistics ===
In his 12 NFL seasons, Haley recorded 100.5 quarterback sacks, two interceptions (nine return yards), and eight fumble recoveries, which he returned for nine yards and a touchdown. He was also selected to play in five Pro Bowls (1988, 1990, 1991, 1994, 1995) and was named NFL All-Pro in 1990 and 1994. In his first four seasons in Dallas, he was on three Super Bowl-winning teams: in 1992 (XXVII), 1993 (XXVIII), and 1995 (XXX). He was the first player with more than four Super Bowl Rings.

==Honors==
Haley was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2015 after several years of eligibility and his bust was sculpted by Scott Myers. Haley felt that his election may have been delayed by his image and behavior: &quot;I thought that what you do on the field would govern whether you get in the Hall&quot;. On August 8, 2015, Haley was inducted at the Enshrinement Ceremony where his bust was unveiled. He was also inducted into the San Francisco 49ers Hall of Fame in 2015.

Prior to that, Haley was inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame in 2006, the College Football Hall of Fame in 2011, and the Texas Black Sports Hall of Fame in 2012. He was enshrined into the Dallas Cowboys Ring of Honor on November 6, 2011.

==Personal life==
After football, Haley was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and began to undergo therapy and to take medication. Haley was an assistant defensive coach for the Detroit Lions from 2001 to 2002. He is a special advisor mentoring rookies for both the Dallas Cowboys and San Francisco 49ers. He also has dedicated his life to help fund several local initiatives with organizations such as Jubilee Centre and The Salvation Army. He is the founder of Tackle Tomorrow which provides struggling schools in the Dallas area with reading programs and special teachers to help students improve their reading skills. Tackle Tomorrow is an active foundation with support from the Dallas community and other Cowboys such as Dak Prescott, DeMarcus Lawrence, Tony Tolbert, Troy Aikman, Emmitt Smith, Michael Irvin, and many others.

His daughter Madison Haley is a professional soccer player who currently plays for Brighton and Hove in the Women&#x27;s Premier League in England].

<doc id="1312733" wikidata="Q2337997" url="?curid=1312733" title="Alone in the Dark 2 (video game)">
<text>Alone in the Dark 2 is a 1993 survival horror video game developed and published by Infogrames. It is the second installment in the &quot;Alone in the Dark&quot; series. It was ported to the PC-98 and FM Towns in 1994 and to the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer in 1995 under the same name, and to the Sega Saturn and PlayStation in 1996 as Alone in the Dark: Jack Is Back in Europe, and renamed as Alone in the Dark: One-Eyed Jack&#x27;s Revenge in North America.

==Gameplay==
The original game&#x27;s horror theme has been significantly de-emphasized in the sequel. While there are some supernatural goings-on (Voodoo black magic), the main villains are gangsters and pirates. While the enemies are revealed to be possessed by evil spirits, and are green and zombie-like in appearance, they are far from the shambling walking corpses of the first game, and walk, talk, and behave much like ordinary people, arming themselves with guns and shooting at the player. The player can pick up weapons on the way with firearms such as the Revolver equipped at the start of the game, Shotguns, Tommy guns, a Derringer pistol, Flintlock pistols and melee weapons such as Swords. The game world is larger than that of the original, encompassing not only a mansion, but also the surrounding gardens as well as a pirate ship hidden in caverns beneath the house; however, unlike the first game, with the exception of the main house, its locations may only be explored in a strictly linear sequence, a pattern that would continue in later sequels.

Although much of the game is spent playing as Carnby, the player will occasionally take control of Grace Saunders. Grace, a child, cannot fight and is instantly captured if the gangsters spot her, so instead she must sneak around and defeat the gangsters by turning common household objects into booby traps.

==Plot==
It is Christmas of 1924, three months after the events in &quot;Alone in the Dark&quot;. &quot;Supernatural Private Eye&quot; Edward Carnby and his partner Ted Stryker are investigating the kidnapping of young Grace Saunders. The trail of clues leads to an old mansion named &quot;Hell&#x27;s Kitchen&quot; - the home of an infamous gangster boss and his gang. Edward decides to pick up the trail when he learns of Ted&#x27;s disappearance in the mansion, but Edward soon finds out that Ted has been murdered.

Carnby eventually finds out that the mobsters are the corporeal forms of the spirits of pirates that plundered the sea hundreds of years ago, the lot having sold their souls in exchange for eternal life through voodoo magic. Fighting his way into the house and ultimately onto a pirate ship hidden in the cliff on which Jack&#x27;s house is built, Edward must survive, discover the secret of the pirates&#x27; apparent immortality, rescue little Grace, and find out why the pirates are so interested in her.

==&quot;Jack in the Dark&quot;==
&quot;Jack in the Dark&quot; is a small game made during production of &quot;Alone in the Dark 2&quot;. It was used as a promotional game distributed during Christmas in 1993 (just before &quot;Alone in the Dark 2&quot; was released). The game was on a single floppy disk in a golden wrapping featuring a Jack-in-the-box illustration on the top. It is a short adventure featuring the young child Grace Saunders. During Halloween, she enters a small toy store after dark and gets locked in it. There, the toys are alive, and Grace must save Santa Claus from an evil Jack-in-the-box. Jack in the Dark is an adventure game that focuses purely on puzzles and has no combat. Later CD versions of both &quot;Alone in the Dark&quot; and &quot;Alone in the Dark 2&quot; came packaged with &quot;Jack in the Dark&quot;.

==Release==
There were two DOS versions of the game, the floppy disk version and the CD-ROM version. While the floppy version was the original, the CD-ROM release added a full Red Book audio reworked soundtrack, dialogue speech (in English, French, German, Italian, Spanish and Japanese, depending on the country the game was released) and a new playable section of Grace Saunders not present in the original version, which connected the mansion and the ship areas. This version also removed the copy protection from the floppy disk release.

As with the first instalment in the series, outside of Europe the game was distributed in North America by Interplay Entertainment and in Japan by Arrow Micro-Techs Corp, which once again developed and published Japanese-exclusive versions for the PC-98 and FM Towns computers.

The console releases of Alone in the Dark 2 included a port for the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer released in 1995 which is very similar to the DOS CD-ROM version, and also versions released for the Sega Saturn and PlayStation in 1996 which featured reworked and fully textured polygonal models, instead of the flat shaded ones from the DOS versions and 3DO port. New FMV cutscenes were also added to these ports. All console releases were also published in Japan by Electronic Arts Victor, with the Sega Saturn and PlayStation versions being released as &quot;Alone in the Dark: Jack Is Back&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; in April 1994 said that the computer version of &quot;Alone in the Dark 2&quot; &quot;looks rich enough to meet gamers&#x27; expectations for a solid sequel&quot;. In May 1994 the magazine said that with improved graphics, it &quot;offers plenty of game play for those who like their adventures with a dash of the macabre&quot;. In June 1994 the magazine said that the game was not &quot;for those who are easily frustrated&quot;. It concluded that &quot;Despite its weak ending ... &quot;Alone 2&quot; is a good, solid challenge. Much more so than its predecessor, it will test players&#x27; reflexes as well as their minds&quot;. Reviewing the PlayStation version, &quot;Maximum&quot; called the PC original &quot;one of the most ground-breaking arcade/adventures to date&quot; and hailed its appearance on the PlayStation as &quot;the first true arcade/adventure for the system.&quot; They commented approvingly on the H. P. Lovecraft-inspired locations, the way the player is eased into the controls, and the twist of having to play through a segment of the game as Grace. However, they remarked that the game is outdated and outclassed by the upcoming &quot;Resident Evil&quot;. &quot;Next Generation&quot; emphasized the last point: &quot;frankly it&#x27;s yesterday&#x27;s news, and releasing it to PlayStation in the wake of &quot;Resident Evil&quot; just makes it redundant.&quot;

James V. Trunzo reviewed &quot;Alone in the Dark 2&quot; in &quot;White Wolf&quot; #47 (Sept., 1994), rating it a 4 out of 5 and stated that &quot;In the end, &quot;Alone in the Dark 2&quot; should be experienced by all serious gamers.&quot;

Steve Bradley reviewed the PlayStation version of &quot;Alone in the Dark: Jack Is Back&quot; for &quot;Arcane&quot; magazine, rating it an 8 out of 10 overall. Bradley comments that &quot;The 3D graphics are superb, the use of camera angles dynamic, but the strength of &quot;AITD&quot; is the sheer suspense generated as you explore a haunted mansion and its environs - it&#x27;s genuinely frightening. Sure, the control can be a bit iffy (a general rule of thumb in such fare as this) and the graphics are a mite patchy, but it&#x27;s by far the best roleplaying adventure game for the PlayStation.&quot;

&quot;Maximum&quot; was more harsh with the 3DO version, saying that the game is far too old to be worth converting to home console. They said it looks especially poor due to being (by pure coincidence) released in Europe at the same time as the PlayStation version: &quot;The Sony conversion boasts texture-mapped characters moving at higher speeds and with less loading time, whilst the poor old 3DO struggles with flat shaded polygons, a smaller screen size and a chugging frame rate.&quot; A reviewer for &quot;Next Generation&quot; complained that a combination of poor control and awkward fixed camera angles makes battling enemies more difficult than it should be. He nonetheless gave it a strong recommendation, and summarized it as &quot;a direct port of the PC title, and a huge game with a great cinematic feel and lots of fiendishly clever puzzles.&quot;

The Saturn version received generally negative reviews. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; gave it a 4.25 out of 10, citing difficult aiming, poor graphics, confusing cutscenes, absurd voice acting, and camera angles which change too frequently, making it difficult to hit enemies or get a sense of direction. Rob Bright of &quot;Sega Saturn Magazine&quot; commented that the game has &quot;a well worked plot mixing the fantasy and myth of pirates with a bootlegging 1920s America to create a sort of Gothic noir&quot;, but echoed &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;&#x27;s criticisms with the aiming, graphics, and camera angles. &quot;GamePro&quot;&#x27;s Scary Larry remarked that even though the original &quot;Alone in the Dark&quot; was the probable inspiration for &quot;Resident Evil&quot;, the sequel dramatically fails to measure up. He particularly commented that the graphics and audio lack the realism and life that made &quot;Resident Evil&quot; so scary, and that &quot;The quirky controls don&#x27;t help the less-than-appealing gameplay or the boring story line.&quot; Yasuhiro Hunter of &quot;Maximum&quot; similarly commented that the game is a feeble attempt at giving the Saturn an equivalent to &quot;Resident Evil&quot;, with a poor CG intro, frustrating controls, and animations which fail to induce &quot;Resident Evil&quot;&#x27;s sense of fear. He said that &quot;Alone in the Dark 2&quot; did have a deep plot and was very good at the time of its original release on PC, but had become very outdated in the two years since. &quot;Next Generation&quot;, while acknowledging that the game was dated next to recent efforts, contended that it &quot;still manages to hold up fairly well on its own.&quot; The reviewer criticized the sometimes poorly chosen camera angles but was pleased with the game&#x27;s graphics and massive size.

In 1994, &quot;PC Gamer UK&quot; named &quot;Alone in the Dark 2&quot; the 7th best computer game of all time, calling it &quot;an incredibly involving and film-like experience&quot;.

<text>Steven Joseph Bartkowski (born November 12, 1952) is an American former professional football player who was a quarterback in the National Football League (NFL) for the Atlanta Falcons (1975–1985), Washington Redskins (1985) and the Los Angeles Rams (1986). He was a two-time Pro Bowl selection. Bartkowski played college football for the California Golden Bears, earning consensus All-American honors as a senior in 1974. He was selected by the Falcons with the first overall pick of the 1975 NFL draft.

==College career==
Bartkowski attended the University of California, Berkeley. In 1972, he threw for 944 yards with four touchdowns and 13 interceptions. In 1973, he threw for 910 yards with four touchdowns and seven interceptions. As a senior with the Golden Bears in 1974, Bartkowski was a consensus All-American and led the nation in passing. He threw for 2,580 yards, 12 touchdowns, and seven interceptions. He completed 182 passes out of 325 attempts. In addition to playing football, Bartkowski was also an All-American baseball player at first base for the Bears.

==Professional career==
Bartkowski was chosen with the first overall pick in the 1975 NFL draft by the Atlanta Falcons (after the Falcons acquired the pick in a trade with the Colts). Bartkowski was the NFL Rookie of the Year as well as The Sporting News NFC Rookie of the Year in 1975. He was the first client of sports agent Leigh Steinberg.

Bartkowski is one of ten quarterbacks in NFL history who have achieved consecutive 30-touchdown passing seasons (1980 and 1981) at least one time in their career. Bartkowski was selected to the Pro Bowl after both the 1980 and 1981 seasons and was selected 2nd Team All-NFC following the 1980 campaign. Bartkowski led the NFL in passing in 1983 with a passer rating of 97.6. Bartkowski set the record for consecutive games with at least three touchdown passes at home with five which he established over the 1980 and 1981 seasons. The record was held until the 2004 season when it was surpassed by Peyton Manning.

In 1984, Bartkowski started the Falcons&#x27; first 11 games, but was injured late in the season and replaced by Mike Moroski. Bartkowski began 1985 as the starter, but an 0–5 start led to his benching and losing the job to David Archer. He was placed on the injured reserve list before the eighth game and then released in November.

On December 12, 1985, Bartkowski signed with the Washington Redskins on a two-week contract. He was added to their roster as an emergency quarterback, due to the current starter, Jay Schroeder, playing with a fractured rib. Bartkowski served as the third string quarterback for Washington&#x27;s final two regular season games.

The Los Angeles Rams signed Bartkowski in the 1986 pre-season when holdover Dieter Brock suffered a season- (and career-) ending injury. Bartkowski started six of the Rams&#x27; first seven games and the team was 4–2 in those games, but Bartkowski was largely ineffective and lost the starting job to Steve Dils. The Rams would eventually turn the reins over to rookie Jim Everett. Bartkowski retired after the 1986 season.

Bartkowski was inducted into the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame on May 19, 2007.

==NFL career statistics==
=== Regular season ===
==Post-NFL career==
Bartkowski is currently on the Falcons Board of Advisors. He has a wife, Sandee, and two sons, Philip and Peter, and resides outside Atlanta. Bartkowski&#x27;s elder son, Philip is married to Robin Fortin, the sister of former Falcons lineman Roman Fortin. In 1993, Bartkowski was inducted into the National Polish American Sports Hall of Fame and in 2012, he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame.

<doc id="1312759" wikidata="Q5431136" url="?curid=1312759" title="Faith (shoe retailer)">
<text>Faith was a British shoe retailer founded in 1964 by London accountant Samuel Faith and his wife. In the following years new stores were gradually added, primarily in the South of England. After Samuel&#x27;s retirement, his son Jonathan acquired the family business which he subsequently sold to Bridgepoint Capital in December 2004 for £65 million.

The company entered administration in 2010, and Debenhams purchased the brand and 115 Faith concessions operating within its stores.

==History==
In the 1980s the brand launched its prosperous &#x27;faith solo&#x27; brand, taking styles and ideas straight from the catwalk and selling them to a mainstream audience. The company also began a programme of opening concessions within selected Dorothy Perkins and Topshop stores.

In 1996 a contract was agreed with Topshop for Faith to open a concession in every Topshop store in the UK and Ireland. In the late 1990s Debenhams also approached Faith with a long-term view to becoming the main concession partner for young fashion ladies footwear. This form of expansion therefore became the only means of growth for the business for several years until 2001.

By 2001, concessions accounted for 75% of sales mainly through the Arcadia stores of Topshop, Dorothy Perkins and Miss Selfridge. In the autumn of 2001, Arcadia served notice that they intended to terminate the contract. Faced with this loss of revenue, the company embarked on a substantial programme of opening own-brand stores.

Topshop asked Faith to leave its stores in the summer of 2003 as they found there would be a higher profit in producing its own brand of footwear. This led to a huge expansion of both Faith branches and profits. Latterly there was only one Faith concession within Topshop (at Oxford Circus).

In 2004 there were approximately 1700 employees in the UK and Ireland, with further concessions operating under licence in the Middle East. There was also a division servicing the main UK mail order catalogues, such as Freemans and Littlewoods.

The brand celebrated its 40th anniversary in 2004. In December 2004, Faith Shoes was bought for £65 million by private equity group Bridgepoint Capital, and some years later entered into a pre-pack administration agreement in 2008, when John Kinnaird bought the business.

In April 2010, all stores were closed as part of a new administration procedure. Prior to administration it had 72 stand alone branches, as well as concessions in Allders, Debenhams, Sunwin House, and Beatties. Debenhams purchased the 115 Faith concessions trading within its stores in July 2010.

==&quot;Hope&quot; store==
In April 2010, after Faith Footwear Ltd went into administration, 70 stores were closed, and more than 1700 staff lost their jobs. Inspired by the former Dorchester Woolworth&#x27;s Store Manager Claire Robertson&#x27;s success in reopening her store as &#x27;Wellworths&#x27;, the Chelmsford branch of Faith got together and reopened their store on 3 July 2010 as &#x27;Hope&#x27;.

In the official press release Store Manager Justina Pay stated: &quot;We were inspired by Claire Robertson and her success in turning her old Dorchester Woolworths store into Wellworths, a great example of someone who has had a massive success from a very sad redundancy. Customers were genuine in their sadness that our stores were closing and were concerned as to where they could buy quality shoes from, we knew we had to &#x27;do a Wellworths&#x27; and try and bring it back!&quot;.

<text>Kunoy (, ) is an island located in the north-east of the Faroe Islands between Kalsoy to the west (with which there is no physical link) and Borðoy to the east (to which it is linked via a causeway).

== Settlements and transport ==
There are two settlements on Kunoy: Kunoy (population 64) on the west coast and Haraldssund on the south-east coast. These have been connected by a tunnel since 1988. Haraldssund is connected by a causeway to the neighbouring island of Borðoy to the east of Kunoy. Before the causeway was built, travel to the island was by ferry. Nowadays the 504 bus runs a regular service across the causeway, with a route from Klaksvík through Ánir then across to Haraldssund and through the tunnel to Kunoy.

A third settlement, Skarð, was the site of a fishing accident on Christmas Eve, 1913 which killed seven men (all the male population except a 14-year-old and a 70-year-old). The women decided to move to Haraldssund, and the area is now deserted.

==Geography==

===Important Bird Area===
The coastline of the northern tip of the island has been identified as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because of its significance as a breeding site for seabirds, especially European storm petrels (250 pairs) and black guillemots (200 pairs).

The brown rat, was introduced on purpose by people from Klaksvík, to the island in 1914 over some slight, and it has done tremendous damage to the bird population since then, most notably the Atlantic puffin.

===Mountains===

The island has the following eleven mountains, shown with their overall rank in the Faroe Islands: The top of Klubbin is well known for its vegetation, as it is one of the few areas where there never have been grazing sheep.

== Notable people ==
*Símun av Skarði (1872–1942), the Faroese poet, politician and teacher and founder of the Faroese Folk High School (Føroya Fólkaháskúli) was born in Skarð, which was a small settlement on Kunoy, which was abandoned in 1919. He wrote the Faroese National Anthem, &quot;Mítt alfagra land&quot;.

<doc id="1312770" wikidata="Q131925" url="?curid=1312770" title="Multistable perception">
<text>Multistable perception (or bistable perception) is a perceptual phenomenon in which an observer experiences an unpredictable sequence of spontaneous subjective changes. While usually associated with visual perception (a form of optical illusion), multistable perception can also be experienced with auditory and olfactory percepts.

== Classification ==
Perceptual multistability can be evoked by visual patterns that are too ambiguous for the human visual system to definitively and uniquely interpret. Familiar examples include the Necker cube, Schroeder staircase, structure from motion, monocular rivalry, and binocular rivalry, but many more visually ambiguous patterns are known. Because most of these images lead to an alternation between two mutually exclusive perceptual states, they are sometimes also referred to as bistable perception.

Auditory and olfactory examples can occur when there are conflicting, and so rival, inputs into the two ears or two nostrils.

== Characterization ==
The transition from one precept (an undefined term) to its alternative (the defined term) is called a perceptual reversal (Paradigm shift). They are spontaneous and stochastic events that cannot be eliminated by intentional efforts, although some control over the alternation process is learnable. Reversal rates vary drastically between stimuli and observers. They are slower for people with bipolar disorder.

== Cultural history ==
Human interest in these phenomena can be traced back to antiquity. The fascination with multistable perception probably comes from the active nature of endogenous perceptual changes or from the dissociation of dynamic perception from constant sensory stimulation. 

Multistable perception was a common feature in the artwork of the Dutch lithographer M. C. Escher, who was strongly influenced by mathematical physicists such as Roger Penrose.

== Examples ==
=== Real-world phenomena ===
Photographs of craters, from either the moon or other planets including our own, can exhibit this phenomenon. Craters in stereo vision, such as our eyes, normally appear concave. However, in monocular presentations, such as photographs, the elimination of our depth perception causes multistable perception, which can cause the craters to look like plateaus rather than pits. For humans, the &quot;default&quot; interpretation comes from an assumption of top-left lighting, so that rotating the image by 180 degrees can cause the perception to suddenly switch. This phenomenon is called the concave/convex, or simply up/down, ambiguity, and it confuses computer vision as well.

=== In popular culture ===
In literature, the science fiction novel, &quot;Dhalgren&quot;, by Samuel R. Delany, contains circular text, multistable perception, and multiple entry points.

Multistable perception arises with the theater segments of &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;, as due to the construction of the Crow T. Robot puppet, its head can appear to be facing towards the camera rather than towards the film being shown. This was addressed by the creators of the series, even likening Crow to a Necker cube or The Spinning Dancer.

<doc id="1312771" wikidata="Q909578" url="?curid=1312771" title="Karel Doorman-class frigate">
<text>The &quot;Karel Doorman&quot;-class frigates are a series of eight multi-purpose vessels built for the Royal Netherlands Navy. Its namesake is Karel Doorman, a Dutch naval officer whose ship was struck by a Japanese torpedo in the Battle of the Java Sea in 1942, and went down with his ship as a result.

== Design history ==
In the 1970s, Dutch naval authorities deemed the s old, outdated, and therefore in need of replacement. This led to the construction of the &quot;Karel Doorman&quot;-class frigates in the mid 1980s after the Dutch navy had finalised the design and requirements for the frigates at the end of the 1970s and early 1980s.

The design of the M-frigates was made in-house at the Royal Netherlands Navy, in close collaboration with construction site De Schelde in Vlissingen and design agency Nevesbu. For the first time stealth techniques were used in the design, such as the sloping walls of the bridge section. Much attention was also paid to the care and facilities for the crew, with more privacy and improved comfort.

The &quot;Karel Doorman&quot; class were designed as multi purpose frigates that could perform a wide range of missions. Their armament reflects this by incorporating many features, such as the ability to engage submarines, aircraft and surface vessels. Besides warfare the armaments can also be used to support anti-drug and piracy operations.

First amongst this class to be launched was . Laid down in February 1985 and launched in April 1988, it was commissioned by the Dutch navy in May 1991. &quot;Karel Doorman&quot; was followed by , , , , , , and . Even while the ships were still under construction, Dutch authorities tried, and ultimately failed, to negiotate purchase orders by interested foreign navies.

However, six decommissioned &quot;Karel Doorman&quot;-class frigates were eventually bought by the Belgian, Chilean, and Portuguese navies, and the proceeds were subsequently invested in development of the .

== Armament ==
These multi-purpose frigates can be used in the anti-submarine, anti-aircraft, or surface combat roles. Their primary surface armament consists of two quad RGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship launchers with a range of up to . Also available is an OTO Melara 76 mm gun, which has both anti-ship and anti-air capabilities.

Air defence is provided by an AIM-7 Sparrow medium-range semi-active radar homing air-to-air missile with a range of up to Sixteen VLS cells are mounted on the port external bulkhead of the hangar. The Goalkeeper close-in weapon system provides close-range air defence and can fire up to four thousand rounds per minute at a range of .

For anti submarine warfare, each ship is equipped with two twin torpedo launchers, firing Mark 46 torpedoes; and carries one NH90 NFH or Westland Lynx helicopter. The helicopter is also armed with 2 Mk 46 torpedoes, and carries dipping sonar and forward looking infrared systems.

== List of ships ==
== Sale to foreign navies ==
=== Chile ===

In 2004 two ships, &quot;Tjerk Hiddes&quot; and &quot;Abraham van der Hulst&quot; were sold to Chile and renamed &quot;Almirante Riveros&quot; (FF-18) and &quot;Blanco Encalada&quot; (FF-15) respectively. &quot;Blanco Encalada&quot; commissioned into the Chilean Navy on 16 December 2005, with &quot;Almirante Riveros&quot; to be commissioned in April 2007.

=== Belgium ===

On 20 July 2005, the Belgian government decided to buy two of the remaining six Dutch M-class frigates to replace the two remaining frigates of the in service with the Belgian Naval Component, which in turn might be sold to Bulgaria. On 21 December 2005, &quot;Karel Doorman&quot; and &quot;Willem van der Zaan&quot; were sold to Belgium and renamed &quot;Leopold I&quot; (F930) and &quot;Louise-Marie&quot; (F931) respectively. They were recommissioned between 2007 and 2008.

=== Portugal ===

In May 2006, Portugal&#x27;s National Defense Minister, Luís Amado, showed interest in buying two &quot;Karel Doorman&quot;-class frigates to replace the two remaining frigates of the in service with the Portuguese Navy — instead of buying two frigates of the , offered by the United States. A committee of the Portuguese government arrived in the Netherlands to evaluate the condition of two frigates to be bought.

On 1 November 2006, the Portuguese Defense Minister Nuno Severiano Teixeira signed a contract for the purchase of the frigates and . &quot;Van Nes&quot;, renamed NRP &quot;Bartolomeu Dias&quot; (F333), was transferred to Portugal on 16 January 2009 and &quot;Van Galen&quot;, renamed NRP &quot;Dom Francisco de Almeida&quot; (F334) was transferred on 15 January 2010. With the sale of two M-class frigates to Portugal only two of the eight ships remain with the Royal Netherlands Navy.

== Modernisation ==
The Royal Netherlands Navy and the Belgian Naval Component decided to upgrade the four frigates by rebuilding both hangar and helicopter deck for the NH90 NFH helicopter as well to replace the forward mast for fitting the new Thales SeaWatcher 100 phased array surface search radar and Gatekeeper electro-optical surveillance system. In addition, they were also equipped with a new Low Frequency Active and Passive Sonar (LFAPS). The first ship to receive the upgrade was &quot;Van Speijk&quot; in April 2012, next was &quot;Leopold I&quot;, followed by &quot;Van Amstel&quot; and &quot;Louise Marie&quot; is currently undergoing the modernization. SMART-S 3D search radars will not be replaced by SMART-S MK2.

Seawatcher 100 is a non-rotating active phased array radar for naval surface surveillance. The system automatically detects and tracks asymmetric threats and very small objects such as swimmers and periscopes in all weather conditions. Seastar can also be used for helicopter guidance. Seastar is internationally marketed as Sea Watcher 100

Gatekeeper is a 360-degree panoramic electro-optical surveillance and alerter system based on IR/TV technology. Designed to counter emerging asymmetric threats down to small boats and swimmers, Gatekeeper increases short-range situational awareness in littoral environments.

In 2018 the Portuguese Navy decided to modernize its two &quot;Karel Doorman&quot;-class frigates (Mid-life update), the first frigate started modernization in 2018 and was delivered in September 2021, the second frigate started modernization in 2020 and was received in October 2022. In November 2024 it was reported that the Portuguese Navy had acquired eight Harpoon Block II conversion kits from the Netherlands. These kits can be used to convert Harpoon Block I missiles to Block II, which the Portuguese Navy can launch from its modernized &quot;Karel Doorman&quot; class frigates.

== Replacement ==

The two multipurpose M-frigates which are still in service with the Royal Netherlands Navy are reaching the end of their life; they were designed to last until 2018/2023. Because of this the Dutch Ministry of Defence started design studies in 2013. The new frigates are again planned to fulfill a general purpose role with anti-submarine warfare as its specialty. However, since the Netherlands Royal Navy only owns six frigates in total by 2017, the new ships have to be able to perform well in all areas of the spectrum. This means that anti-air equipment also has to be present, in the form of VLS (vertical launch)-cells carrying Standard Missile 2 or ESSM-projectiles. Due to budget cuts, the replacement program was delayed and is now projected to deliver the first ships in 2028–29.

=== First designs ===
In November 2013 on a techbase in Amsterdam a 3D-printed model of one of the designs was shown to the public. The ships were going to be, just like their predecessor, multipurpose-frigates with anti-submarine being the main task.
This new class is going to have an integrated mast made by Thales Nederland; the ships of the &quot;Holland&quot; class did also get this type of mast. At first this new class was to be replacing the &quot;Karel Doorman&quot;-class vessels in 2020; however, Minister of Defence Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert had changed this date to 2023. This was subsequently further pushed back to the end of the decade.

By 2017, it was made clear the new &#x27;Future Surface Combatant (Koninklijke Marine)&#x27; will be developed in cooperation with the Belgian Marine Component and at least four vessels are to be built (two for the Royal Dutch Navy and two for the Belgian Marine Component), with the possibility more will be ordered as soon as the acquisition procedure reaches a more definitive phase.

<text>Henry Austin Ellard (born July 21, 1961) is an American former professional football wide receiver who played for the Los Angeles Rams (1983–1993), the Washington Redskins (1994–1998), and the New England Patriots (1998) of the National Football League (NFL). Ellard also qualified for the Olympic trials in 1992 in the triple jump, although he injured his hamstring during the Trials and did not make the team.

==Early life and college==
Ellard attended Hoover High School in Fresno, California. He won the CIF California State Championships in the triple jump in 1979 For college, Ellard stayed in town and attended Fresno State University from 1979 to 1982 where he set an NCAA record with 1,510 receiving yards in his final season. In Fresno State history, Ellard is tied for third in touchdown catches (25), fifth in receiving yards (2,947) and 11th in receptions (138). 
*1979: 9 catches for 136 yards with 3 TD
*1980: 28 catches for 493 yards with 3 TD.
*1981: 39 catches for 808 yards with 4 TD.
*1982: 61 catches for 1510 yards with 15 TD.

Ellard still holds the NCAA record for yards per catch in a season, 24.4, set while playing for Fresno State in 1982. His Quarterback was current Fresno State head coach Jeff Tedford.

Ellard was also an All-American triple jumper on the Fresno State track and field team. In 1982, he set and still holds the Fresno State school record in the triple jump at 55&#x27; 0.5&quot;.

==Professional career==
===Los Angeles (1983–1993)===
Ellard was drafted in the second round (32nd overall) of the 1983 NFL draft by the Los Angeles Rams. Ellard would have a carousel of quarterbacks to catch from in his time that ranged from Jeff Kemp to Jim Everett. In his rookie year, Ellard was used mostly in the field as a returner on kicks. He made 31 combined returns on punts and kicks for 531 yards with one touchdown. He also made 16 catches for 268 yards (on the depth chart, receivers like Mike Barber and Dickerson would get the catches and yards, although Ellard outclassed both in yards per catch). The 1983 season for the Rams ended up being buoyed by the draft picks made for Ellard alongside Eric Dickerson to result in nine wins. While Dickerson set rookie records in yards and other various categories, Ellard would play his part in helping to clinch a playoff spot in the final game of the regular season. Needing a win against the New Orleans Saints to clinch a wild card berth, the Rams would not score a single touchdown from their offense, but they still pulled off a nail-biting 26–24 win. Ellard returned a punt 72 yards for a touchdown (his first in his career) that was in the middle of a sudden 16-point upswing after trailing 7–0 early in the first quarter. For his part, Ellard made six combined punt and kick returns for 130 yards. In the playoffs, Ellard was used sparingly in the playoff run by the Rams. He made four total catches for 61 yards with 13 returns for 168 yards in two combined postseason games.

In the following year, Ellard would be used slightly more on the offensive side of the ball, starting each game of the season. He caught 34 total passes for 622 yards with six touchdowns, all of which were highs on the team. Ellard would score eight total touchdowns in the season, with a significant part of that being a four-game stretch from September 30 to October 22. In those four games, he caught a combined 6 passes for 134 total yards with three touchdowns while returning six punts for 207 yards and two touchdowns Ellard was selected as a punt returner for the Pro Bowl that year (alongside an All-Pro selection), having returned 30 punts for 403 yards and two touchdowns. The Rams made it back to the postseason once again with Ellard as a starter this time. He would catch 2 passes for 22 yards while returning 2 punts for 17 yards, but the Rams would lose 16–13.

The following year, Ellard kept improving (despite no selections from the press). He caught 54 passes for 811 yards and five touchdowns. He had his first 100-yard game of his career against the Atlanta Falcons on September 29, catching five passes for 123 yards and a touchdown. On punt returns, he made 37 of them for 501 yards and a touchdown. The Rams made it back to the playoffs once again. Ellard played a small key role in the Divisional Round game versus the Dallas Cowboys. He had a 23-yard punt return that would be followed by a 21-yard catch to eventually lead L.A. to the only points of the first half (a field goal). Ellard caught 2 passes for 33 yards while returning four punts for 37 yards while Dickerson and the Rams ran over Dallas 20–0. In the NFC Championship Game the following week, Ellard caught and returned just once as the Bears won 24–0. In the 1986 season, Ellard missed the first eight games before returning to catch 34 passes in eight starts for 447 yards and four touchdowns. In the strike plagued 1987 season, Ellard started in 12 of 15 games for the Rams. He caught 51 passes for 799 yards and three touchdowns.

In 1988, Ellard finally soared. He caught a career high 86 passes for a league-high 1,414 yards with ten touchdowns. His 88.4 yards per game also led the league. Ellard was awarded the NFC Offensive Player of the Month award for December, having caught 18 total passes for 298 yards and three touchdowns in three wins to help the Rams into the playoffs. He continued his run in 1989, although he played in fourteen games. He caught 70 passes for 1,382 yards for 8 touchdowns while leading the league again with 98.7 yards per game. He had the best game of his career in Week 2, catching 12 passes for 230 yards and three touchdowns against the Indianapolis Colts. Although Ellard led the team in receptions/yards/touchdowns once again, he was joined this time with Flipper Anderson to create a duo of 1,000 yard receivers, which they would do again the following year. Ellard finally had a playoff run to remember in 1989. His four catches for 87 yards with a touchdown was his best game to his career in the postseason (which was his eighth played), as the Rams charged to the NFC title game, with Ellard having a 100-yard game against the Giants. However, the San Francisco 49ers neutralized him for two catches on 18 yards in a 30–3 loss. Despite playing for nearly ten more years, Ellard had played his last postseason game, as the Rams were doomed to irrelevance for the rest of their tenure in the city.

Ellard continued on in 1990 at the start of the decline of the Rams. In 15 games he caught 76 passes for 1,294 yards for four touchdowns (ranking in the top five for the former two alongside yards per catch and game). For 1991, he caught 64 passes for 1,052 yards (his fourth straight) with three touchdowns, ranking in the top ten for yards per catch and per game. Ellard moved down in 1992 in every category to break a 1000-yard season. For the first time since his rookie year, Ellard did not lead the way in the receiving side, as Cleveland Gary had more catches (52) with equal touchdowns (although Ellard outfoxed him in yards). 1993 however proved somewhat better, as he caught over 60 passes for the fifth time in his last six seasons with 945 yards to lead the team in both categories. However, it would be his last season with the Rams, as he moved to the Washington Redskins. At the time of his move, Ellard held Rams&#x27; team records for career receptions (593), receiving yards (9,761), 100-yard games (26), punt return average (11.3), and total offense (11,663).

===Career closure (1994–1998)===
On a team that won just three games, Ellard caught 74 passes for 1,397 yards (102 behind league-leader Jerry Rice) to start a new run of 1,000 yard seasons while having six touchdowns. His 87.3 yards per game was the best since the 1990 season as he led the Redskins in catches, yards and touchdowns while catching from quarterbacks such as Heath Shuler. The next year, Ellard would flourish again as the best receiver for the team, catching 56 passes for 1,005 yards and five touchdowns. The 1996 year was his last impact season. Playing in each game, he caught 52 passes for 1,014 yards (leading the team once again) with two touchdowns, garnering his seventh 1,000 yard season while leading the league in yards per reception with 19.5. He clinched a 1,000 yard season in the final game against the Dallas Cowboys, catching 7 passes for 155 yards in the 37–10 win. Ellard played in 11 games to close his Redskins career in 1997, catching 32 passes for 485 yards (the lowest since 1986) with four touchdowns, as receivers like Jamie Asher and Brian Mitchell shone for the team in receiving (however, no one caught for 1,000 yards). Ellard moved on to the New England Patriots for 1998, although he was inactive for the first eight games. Ellard played in five games and caught five total passes before being shuttled to Washington for two games (catching two passes) before retirement. In total, he made seven appearances with seven catches with no touchdowns (the second time held with no scores in his career as a receiver, the first being his rookie year).

==Legacy==
He retired after the 1998 season with 814 receptions for 13,777 yards, which placed him third on the all-time list, and 65 touchdowns. He also gained 1,527 yards returning punts, 364 yard returning kickoffs, 50 rushing yards, and 4 punts returned for a touchdown. Overall, he gained 15,718 total yards.

Despite Ellard&#x27;s numbers, it took decades for him to even reach being a semifinalist for the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He believes this to be a consequence of the eventual move of the Rams to St. Louis, as well as his having caught passes from less stellar quarterbacks than similar receivers of his era. Curiously, his closest comparison among receiving leaders is in the Hall of Fame, as Ellard played six fewer games than Andre Reed (who entered the league in 1985 and retired after Ellard in 2000) but managed slightly more receiving yards (each had over 13,000) despite having a hundred fewer catches (Reed had 951 while Ellard had 814); Reed had more touchdowns and Pro Bowl selections while Ellard was named an All-Pro twice and led the league in receiving yards (as opposed to Reed doing neither of those things). Returns and run-happy offenses hampered Ellard for five years before he began to flourish as a receiver. At the time of his retirement in 1998, Ellard was sixth all-time in receptions. Each player above him is in the Hall of Fame, while only one other in the top ten (Irving Fryar, who eventually passed him) is not already inducted. Ellard also ranked third at the time of retirement for yards (between James Lofton and Steve Largent). All except him and Fryar in the top ten are in the Hall of Fame. Ellard became a semifinalist for the Hall of Fame the class of 2023, which is both his first time reaching this stage and his last year with the Modern Era class.

In the 1991 cult classic Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) video game Tecmo Super Bowl, Ellard is the only player besides Jerry Rice to have a Receptions Score of 81, the highest rating for all receivers in the game set during the 1990–91 NFL season.

== NFL career statistics ==

In 2000, he was a coach at Fresno State before taking the receivers coaching job for the St. Louis Rams in 2001. On January 25, 2009, Ellard came to the New York Jets as the wide receivers coach. He was named the wide receivers coach for the New Orleans Saints on March 14, 2012, and spent three seasons with the club before leaving after the 2014 season. He served as the head football coach at San Antonio Christian School from 2016 to 2021.

<text>A scroll compressor (also called &quot;spiral compressor&quot;, scroll pump and scroll vacuum pump) is a device for compressing air or refrigerant. It is used in air conditioning equipment, as an automobile supercharger (where it is known as a scroll-type supercharger) and as a vacuum pump. Many residential central heat pump and air conditioning systems and a few automotive air conditioning systems employ a scroll compressor instead of the more traditional rotary, reciprocating, and wobble-plate compressors.

A scroll compressor operating in reverse is a scroll expander, and can generate mechanical work.

==History==
Léon Creux first patented a scroll compressor in 1905 in France and the US. Creux invented the compressor as a rotary steam engine concept, but the metal casting technology of the period was not sufficiently advanced to construct a working prototype, since a scroll compressor demands very tight tolerances to function effectively. In the 1905 patent, Creux defines a co-orbiting or spinning reversible steam expander driven by a fixed radius crank on a single shaft. However, the scroll expander engine could not overcome the machining hurdles of radial compliance inherent to achieving efficiency in scroll operation that would not be adequately addressed until the works of Niels Young in 1975. The first practical scroll compressors did not appear on the market until after World War II, when higher-precision machine tools enabled their construction. In 1981, Sanden began manufacturing the first commercially available scroll compressors for automobile air conditioners. They were not commercially produced for room air conditioning until 1983 when Hitachi launched the world&#x27;s first air conditioner with a hermetic scroll compressor.

==Design==
A scroll compressor uses two interleaving scrolls to pump, compress or pressurize fluids such as liquids and gases. The vane geometry may be involute, Archimedean spiral, or hybrid curves.

Often, one of the scrolls is fixed, while the other orbits eccentrically without rotating, thereby trapping and pumping or compressing pockets of fluid between the scrolls. An eccentric shaft can provide the orbital motion but the scroll must be prevented from rotating, typically with an Oldham-type coupling, additional eccentric idler shafts, or a bellows joint (particularly for high-purity applications). Another method for producing the compression motion is co-rotating the scrolls, in synchronous motion, but with offset centers of rotation. The relative motion is the same as if one were orbiting.

Leaks from axial gaps are prevented by the use of spiral-shaped tip seals, placed into grooves on the tips of both spirals. These tip seals also help lower the friction and can be replaced when worn down. Some compressors use the pressurized discharge gas to push both scrolls together, eliminating the need for tip seals and improving sealing with use; these compressors are said to wear-in instead of wear-out.

==Engineering comparison to other pumps==
These devices are known for operating more smoothly, quietly, and reliably than conventional compressors in some applications.

===Rotations and pulse flow===
The compression process occurs over approximately 2 to 2½ rotations of the crankshaft, compared to one rotation for rotary compressors, and one-half rotation for reciprocating compressors. The scroll discharge and suction processes occur for a full rotation, compared to less than a half-rotation for the reciprocating suction process, and less than a quarter-rotation for the reciprocating discharge process. Reciprocating compressors have multiple cylinders (typically, anywhere from two to six), while scroll compressors only have one compression element. The presence of multiple cylinders in reciprocating compressors reduces suction and discharge pulsations. Therefore, it is difficult to state whether scroll compressors have lower pulsation levels than reciprocating compressors as has often been claimed by some suppliers of scroll compressors. The more steady flow yields lower gas pulsations, lower sound and lower vibration of attached piping, while having no influence on the compressor operating efficiency.

===Valves===
Scroll compressors never have a suction valve, but depending on the application may or may not have a discharge valve. The use of a dynamic discharge valve is more prominent in high pressure ratio applications, typical of refrigeration. Typically, an air-conditioning scroll does not have a dynamic discharge valve. The use of a dynamic discharge valve improves scroll compressor efficiency over a wide range of operating conditions, when the operating pressure ratio is well above the built-in pressure ratio of the compressors. If the compressor is designed to operate near a single operating point, then the scroll compressor can actually gain efficiency around this point if there is no dynamic discharge valve present (since there are additional discharge flow losses associated with the presence of the discharge valve as well as discharge ports tend to be smaller when the discharge is present).

===Efficiency===
The isentropic efficiency of scroll compressors is slightly higher than that of a typical reciprocating compressor when the compressor is designed to operate near one selected rating point. The scroll compressors are more efficient in this case because they do not have a dynamic discharge valve that introduces additional throttling losses. However, the efficiency of a scroll compressor that does not have a discharge valve begins to decrease as compared to the reciprocating compressor at higher pressure ratio operation. This is a result of under-compression losses that occur at high pressure ratio operation of the positive displacement compressors that do not have a dynamic discharge valve.

The scroll compression process is nearly 100% volumetrically efficient in pumping the trapped fluid. The suction process creates its own volume, separate from the compression and discharge processes further inside. By comparison, reciprocating compressors leave a small amount of compressed gas in the cylinder, because it is not practical for the piston to touch the head or valve plate. That remnant gas from the last cycle then occupies space intended for suction gas. The reduction in capacity (i.e. volumetric efficiency) depends on the suction and discharge pressures with greater reductions occurring at higher ratios of discharge to suction pressures.

===Size===
Scroll compressors tend to be very compact and smooth running and so do not require spring suspension. This allows them to have very small shell enclosures which reduces overall cost but also results in smaller free volume.

==Reliability==
Scroll compressors have fewer moving parts than reciprocating compressors which, theoretically, should improve reliability. According to Emerson Climate Technologies, manufacturer of Copeland scroll compressors, scroll compressors have 70 percent fewer moving parts than conventional reciprocating compressors.

At least one manufacturer found through testing that the scroll compressor design delivered better reliability and efficiency in operation than reciprocating compressors.

== Scroll expander ==
The scroll expander is a work-producing device used mostly in low-pressure heat recovery applications. It is essentially a scroll compressor working in reverse; high enthalpy working fluid or gas enters the discharge side of the compressor and rotates the eccentric scroll before discharging from the compressor inlet. The basic modification required to convert the scroll compressor to a scroll expander is to remove the non-return valve from the compressor discharge.

<text>It&#x27;s a Gift is a 1934 American comedy film starring W.C. Fields. It was Fields&#x27;s 16th sound film and his fifth in 1934 alone.

The film concerns the trials and tribulations of a grocer as he battles a shrewish wife, an incompetent assistant, and assorted annoying children, customers, and salesmen. The film reprises routines honed by Fields from his career over the years 1915–1925. Fields often tried to recapture sketches that led to his stage success onto film; skits such as &quot;The Picnic&quot;, &quot;A Joy Ride&quot;, and most famously, &quot;The Back Porch&quot; are all featured in &quot;It&#x27;s a Gift&quot;.

Lesser known than some of Fields&#x27; later works such as &quot;The Bank Dick,&quot; the film is perhaps the best example of the recurring theme of the Everyman battling against his domestic entrapment. Historians and critics have often cited its numerous memorable comic moments. It is one of several Paramount Pictures in which Fields contended with child actor Baby LeRoy. The film was directed by Norman McLeod, who had directed Fields in his cameo as Humpty Dumpty in &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; (1933).

==Plot==
After inheriting some money, Harold Bissonette (mispronounced by his pompous wife as &quot;biss-on-ay&quot;) decides to give up the grocery business, move to California, and run an orange ranch. Despite his family&#x27;s objections and the news that the land he bought is worthless, Bissonette packs up and drives out to California with his nagging wife Amelia, self-involved daughter Mildred, and bothersome son Norman. As they pass several prosperous orange groves, his wife softens and figures he made a good purchase. Unfortunately, his family&#x27;s doubts prove correct: his barren plot contains only a tumbledown shack and a tumbleweed. Disgusted, his wife and family walk out on him. As he sits down on the car&#x27;s running board, the car collapses under his weight.

Just when Harold is about to lose all hope, though, his luck takes a dramatic turn; a neighbor informs him that a developer is desperate to acquire his land to build a grandstand for a race track. Finally standing up for himself and to his nagging wife, Harold holds out for a large sum of money (including a commission for the friendly neighbor), as well as a demand that the developer buy him an orange grove like the one in the brochure he has been carrying throughout the film. The film ends with Harold sitting at an outdoor breakfast table squeezing orange juice into a glass, while his happy family takes off for a ride in their new car. The now-contented Harold pours a flask of booze into the small amount of orange juice in the glass.

The film is a chronicle of the &quot;many titanic struggles between Harold Bissonnette and the universe. There will be battle of wills between father and daughter, between male and female, between man and a variety of uncontrollable objects.&quot;

The plot is secondary to the series of routines that make up the film. Over the course of the picture, Harold fails to prevent a blind customer named Mr. Muckle (and Baby LeRoy) from turning his store into a disaster area; attempts to share a bathroom mirror with his self-centered, high-pitched, gargling daughter; has a destructive picnic on private property; and in the film&#x27;s lengthy centerpiece, is driven to sleep on the porch by his haranguing wife, and is kept awake all night by neighbors (including further trouble with the mother of the baby who caused damage in his grocery store), salesmen, and assorted noises and calamities.

A well-known, and often somewhat misquoted Fields comment occurs at the climax of the film, as Harold is haggling with the developer, who angrily claims that Harold is drunk. Harold responds, &quot;Yeah, and you&#x27;re crazy; and I&#x27;ll be sober tomorrow and ... you&#x27;ll be crazy for the rest of your life!&quot;

==Reception==
A contemporary review from &#x27;Argus&#x27; in &quot;The Literary Digest&quot;, 1935, declared: &quot;It is clumsy, crude, and quite amateurish in its appearance. It merely happens that a great comedian appears in it and has a free hand in his brilliant clowning, with the result that defects become unimportant, and the film emerges as a comedy delight.&quot; &quot;James Agee&quot; lauded the film: &quot;The talkies brought one great comedian, the late, majestically lethargic W. C. Fields, who could not possibly have worked as well in silence; he was the toughest and most warmly human of all screen comedians, and &quot;It&#x27;s a Gift&quot; and The Bank Dick, fiendishly funny and incisive white-collar comedies, rank high among the best comedies (and best movies) ever made.&quot; 

As of January, 2023 the film has a reviewer rating of 94% on Rotten Tomatoes.

In 2010, this film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

<text>Nan Desu Kan (NDK) is an annual three-day anime convention held during August/September at the Gaylord Rockies Resort &amp; Convention Center in Aurora, Colorado. The convention is the largest anime convention in the Rocky Mountain region and each one takes eighteen months to plan. Its name in Japanese roughly means , &quot;what is it?&quot;. The parent company, Rocky Mountain Anime Association, is a registered 501(c)(4) nonprofit organization.

==Programming==
The convention typically offers an anime music video contest, art showings and auctions, cultural panels, dances, dealer&#x27;s room, games, masquerade, musical guests, screenings of anime, and workshops. NDK at one time hosted a contest for attendees who decorate their atrium hotel rooms, with the winners receiving a free hotel room. The convention has held various fundraisers since 2000 to support organizations that include: American Diabetes Association, American Red Cross, Child&#x27;s Play, Japan America Society of Colorado, Susan G. Komen Foundation, and the United Way Gulf Recovery Fund (2010). In 2012, $12,000 was raised for the Aurora Victim Relief Fund and other charities. The 2015 charity fundraiser was a poker tournament for Dumb Friends League. The conventions tabletop and video gaming room runs 24 hours during the event.

==History==
Prior to 2000 the convention was known as Nan Desu Kon. Renovations in the hotel were still underway prior to the start in 2003, but did not affect the convention. The convention chose not to move to the Colorado Convention Center due to attendee logistic issues (hotels, money, and parking). The convention instituted an attendance cap of 7,500 per day in 2011 due to event quality and attendee comfort concerns. The attendance cap of 7,500 per day continued into 2012 and the convention was a sellout. The convention added the Hilton Garden Inn DTC hotel in 2013, occurred during the 2013 Colorado floods, and attendance remained capped at 7,500 attendees. Along with the flooding the fire alarm went off, tornado warnings occurred, long lines occurred, and the masquerade had to be stopped due to a medical emergency. The convention also hosted the World Cosplay Summit Mountain Qualifiers with Green Jello Cosplay winning.

Nan Desu Kan moved from the Marriott Denver Tech Center to Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel in 2015 due to growth and included an expanded dealers room. Nan Desu Kan 2020 was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, the convention moved to the Gaylord Rockies Resort &amp; Convention Center.

===Event history===
==Other events==
On August 8, 2004 the convention held a CosPlay Dance Party at the Rock Island Night Club in Denver, Colorado. In 2011, Nan Desu Kan organized a benefit for the Japanese Red Cross named Rave2Save. The event was held on Saturday April 30, 2011 at the Marriott Denver Tech Center, which donated the Evergreen Ballroom, and funds raised at the event were matched by the Rocky Mountain Anime Association. The event raised $13,440.

<doc id="1312814" wikidata="Q899546" url="?curid=1312814" title="Water softening">
<text>Water softening is the removal of calcium, magnesium, and certain other metal cations in hard water. The resulting soft water requires less soap for the same cleaning effort, as soap is not wasted bonding with calcium ions. Soft water also extends the lifetime of plumbing by reducing or eliminating scale build-up in pipes and fittings. Water softening is usually achieved using lime softening or ion-exchange resins, but is increasingly being accomplished using nanofiltration or reverse osmosis membranes.

==Rationale==
The presence of certain metal ions like calcium and magnesium, principally as bicarbonates, chlorides, and sulfates, in water causes a variety of problems.

Hard water leads to the buildup of limescale, which can foul plumbing, and promote galvanic corrosion. In industrial scale water softening plants, the effluent flow from the re-generation process can precipitate scale that can interfere with sewage systems.

The slippery feeling associated with washing in soft water is caused by the weaker attraction of the soap to the water ions when the water has been stripped of its mineral content. The surface of human skin has a light charge that the soap tends to bind with, requiring more effort and a greater volume of water to remove. Hard water contains calcium or magnesium ions that form insoluble salts upon reacting with soap, leaving a coating of insoluble stearates on tub and shower surfaces, commonly called soap scum.

==Methods==
The most common means for removing water hardness rely on ion-exchange resin or reverse osmosis. Other approaches include precipitation methods, such as fluidized bed pellet softening, and sequestration by the addition of chelating agents. Distillation and reverse osmosis are the most widely used two non-chemical methods of water softening.

===Ion-exchange resin method===

Conventional water-softening appliances intended for household use depend on an ion-exchange resin in which &quot;hardness ions&quot;—mainly Ca2+ and Mg2+—are exchanged for sodium ions. As described by NSF/ANSI Standard 44, ion-exchange devices reduce the hardness by replacing magnesium and calcium (Mg2+ and Ca2+) with sodium or potassium ions (Na+ and K+).&quot;

Ion-exchange resins are organic polymers containing anionic functional groups to which the divalent cations (Ca2+) bind more strongly than monovalent cations (Na+). Inorganic materials called zeolites also exhibit ion-exchange properties. These minerals are widely used in laundry detergents. Resins are also available to remove the carbonate, bicarbonate, and sulfate ions that are absorbed and hydroxide ions that are released from the resin. 

When all the available Na+ ions have been replaced with calcium or magnesium ions, the resin must be recharged by eluting the Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions using a solution of sodium chloride or sodium hydroxide, depending on the type of resin used. For anionic resins, regeneration typically uses a solution of sodium hydroxide (lye) or potassium hydroxide. The waste waters eluted from the ion-exchange column containing the unwanted calcium and magnesium salts are typically discharged to the sewage system.

Recharge typically takes the following steps:
* Backwash: Water is directed through the resin in the direction opposite to that of normal flow, and the output is sent to a drain for disposal. This ten-minute process flushes out solids, and expands the resin bed.
* Brine draw: Water is directed through a jet pump, which pulls salt water from the brine tank, before the water and brine pass through the resin bed in the normal direction, if &quot;co-current&quot;, or in the reverse direction, if &quot;counter-current&quot;. The output of this typically thirty-minute process is discarded through the drain hose.
* Rinse: Brine draw stops, but water continues to flow from the inlet to the outlet, gradually flushing the brine out of the resin bed. The flushing water flows slowly for several minutes, then at a faster rate for as long as an hour. At some point, the brine reservoir is refilled with fresh water.

===Lime softening===
Lime softening is the process in which lime is added to hard water to make it softer. It has several advantages over the ion-exchange method but is mainly suited to commercial treatment applications.

===Chelating agents===
Chelators are used in chemical analysis, as water softeners, and are ingredients in many commercial products such as shampoos and food preservatives. Citric acid is used to soften water in soaps, personal care products and laundry detergents. A commonly used synthetic chelator is ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), which may exist as a tetrasodium or disodium salt. Due to environmental and aquatic toxicity concerns regarding widespread use of EDTA in household and personal care products, alternatives such as sodium phytate/phytic acid, tetrasodium glutamate diacetate and trisodium ethylenediamine disuccinate are finding more prevalent usage.

===Washing soda method===
In this method, water is treated with a calculated amount of washing soda (Na2CO3), which converts the chlorides and sulphates of calcium and magnesium into their respective carbonates, which get precipitated.

===Distillation and rain water===
Since Ca2+ and Mg2+ exist as nonvolatile salts, they can be removed by distilling the water. Distillation is expensive and energy-inefficient compared to other methods of water softening. Rainwater is soft because it is naturally distilled during the water cycle of evaporation, condensation and precipitation.

===Reverse osmosis===

Reverse osmosis uses an applied pressure gradient across a semipermeable membrane to overcome osmotic pressure and remove water molecules from the solution with hardness ions. The membrane has pores large enough to admit water molecules for passage; hardness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft water supply is free of hardness ions without any other ions being added. Membranes are a type of water filter requiring regular cleaning or replacement maintenance.

====Nanofiltration====

Nanofiltration is a process similar to reverse osmosis in that it involves the use of a semipermeable membrane, though the filter membrane is distinct in that its pores are ≤ 10 nanometers in diameter. The process is often used in conjunction with reverse osmosis filtration, as nanofiltration on its own is not as effective and more expensive than chemical water treatment methods.

==Non-chemical devices==
Some manufacturers claim that the electrical devices they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surfaces. Since these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one benefit claimed for the user is the elimination of the need to add salt to the system. Such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only alter the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. These systems do not fall within the term &quot;water softening&quot; but rather &quot;water conditioning&quot;.

Similar claims for magnetic water treatment are not considered to be valid. For instance, no reduction of scale formation was found when such a magnet device was scientifically tested.

==Alternatives to ion-exchange water softeners==
Removing or replacing minerals in hard water is called water softening. An alternative water treatment is called water conditioning, in which minerals remain in the water, but are altered so they do not form scale. Although the United States has standards for measuring the minerals in water, it does not have standards for measuring scale forming ability of water. Instead, US researchers use the German DVGW-W512 protocol.

Rain water contains dissolved carbon dioxide taken from the atmosphere. Some of the dissolved carbon dioxide reacts with the water to form carbonic acid, which remains in solution. Minerals containing calcium and magnesium form soluble bicarbonates when exposed to carbonic acid. Water containing these minerals is known as &quot;hard water&quot;.

When hard water is heated in a plumbing system, carbon dioxide goes out of solution, and bicarbonates become carbonates, which are much less soluble. The carbonates bind to plumbing surfaces providing seed crystals for further crystal growth, which build up as hard scale.

Physical water treatment (PWT) devices cause microscopic mineral crystals to form and remain suspended as they flow with the water, while also acting as seeds for further crystal growth. As water is heated, minerals will crystallize on these seeds, instead of the plumbing system. The dissolved minerals become insoluble solid particles in suspension, passing through the system without binding to plumbing surfaces.

Alternatives to ion-exchange water softeners exist, see table below.

===Template assisted crystallization===
Cold hard water passes through a tank containing tiny polymeric beads with surfaces that allow nucleation of tiny bubbles of carbon dioxide gas. The initial nucleation of the gas bubbles can occur due to depressurization of the hard water as it flows up a water well just like when the top comes off of a beer bottle. Once carbon dioxide leaves the liquid a chemical reaction immediately drives formation of calcium carbonate crystals on the surface of the bubbles. As crystals grow on these seeds they break off in the flow while still of microscopic size. If these tiny particles travel through a water heater, further exsolution of carbon dioxide occurs due to increased temperature and new crystal growth occurs on the particles, rather than on the water heater. Once calcite occurs in the water, new calcite will prefer to form on the old calcite due to the available bonds on the crystals and the proximity and number of calcite surfaces in the water.

This process is either called template assisted crystallization (TAC) or nucleation assisted crystallization (NAC). The polymeric beads are polyphosphates ranging in size from 0.5 to 2.0 μm. and some have a ceramic coating. Testing at the University of Arizona found TAC to be the most effective at reducing scale formation, followed closely by ion exchange (see chart above). They are more effective than approaches that attempt to sequester ions through application of magnetic or electric fields. The advantages of TAC tanks include simplicity, low maintenance, lack of toxic effluent (like chlorine), and the availability of calcium as a nutrient in drinking water. The disadvantages include that the calcite crystals are not avoided or removed from the water such that areas where water evaporates will still show deposits. It is claimed by manufacturers that these deposits are easier to clean since the calcite forms on seed crystals instead of on the surfaces.

==Health effects==
The UK&#x27;s National Health Service recommends a maximum salt intake of 6g, against an actual current intake of 8.1g. The US CDC recommends limiting daily total sodium intake to 2,300 mg per day, though the average US American consumes 3,500 mg per day. Because the amount of sodium present in drinking water—even after softening—does not represent a significant percentage of a person&#x27;s daily sodium intake, the US EPA considers sodium in drinking water to be unlikely to cause adverse health effects.

A study found the mean concentration of sodium in softened water to be 278 mg/L. In 2 liters of water—the amount of drinking water typically suggested for an average adult, this constitutes about 22% of the recommended sodium intake by the US CDC and may make a difference to those who need to significantly limit their sodium consumption. For those who are on sodium-restricted diets, the use of a reverse osmosis system for drinking water and cooking water will remove sodium along with any other impurities that may be present.Potassium chloride can also be used as a regenerant instead of sodium chloride, although it is more costly. For people with impaired kidney function, however, elevated potassium levels, or hyperkalemia, can lead to complications such as cardiac arrhythmia.

High levels of water hardness in the home may also be linked to the development of atopic dermatitis (eczema) early in life, although the actual relationship is correlational at the present and further research is indicated to establish a causal one. However, using water softeners when atopic dermatitis is already established does not reduce the severity of the symptoms.

==Environmental impact==
Softened water (measured as residual sodium carbonate index) in which calcium and magnesium have been partly replaced by sodium is not suitable for irrigation use, as it tends to cause the development of alkali soils. Non-chemical devices are often used in place of traditional water softening for this application.

<doc id="1312815" wikidata="Q7762115" url="?curid=1312815" title="The Salisbury Review">
<text>The Salisbury Review is a quarterly British &quot;magazine of conservative thought&quot;. It was founded in 1982 by the Salisbury Group, who sought to articulate and further traditional intellectual conservative ideas.

The &quot;Review&quot; was named after Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury, the British prime minister at the end of the nineteenth century. The philosopher Roger Scruton was the chief editor for eighteen years and published it through his Claridge Press. From 2000 the editor was the historian and hoaxer A. D. Harvey. The managing editor from 2006 to 2012 was Merrie Cave. The editor as of 2012 is Myles Harris who is a practising doctor and journalist.

Contributors have included Antony Flew, Christie Davies, Enoch Powell, Margaret Thatcher, Václav Havel, Hugh Trevor-Roper, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, Norman Stone, Theodore Dalrymple, Roger Watson and Peter Mullen.

==History==
The publication was founded in 1982 by the Salisbury Group, who chose Roger Scruton as editor for his defence of traditional conservatism in &quot;The Meaning of Conservatism&quot; (1980) in opposition to the Thatcherite proponents of the free market. The Salisbury group itself was set up in 1978 to support the view of the Third Marquess of Salisbury that &quot;good government consisted of doing as little as possible.&quot;

In &quot;The Spectator&quot; of 21 September 2002 Scruton wrote an article, &quot;My Life Beyond the Pale&quot;, in which he explained what he saw as the difficulties &quot;of finding people to write in an explicitly conservative journal&quot;. He noted that finding subscribers was initially difficult, and that Maurice Cowling had told him that to &quot;try to encapsulate [conservatism] in a philosophy was the kind of quaint project that Americans might undertake&quot;. He also wrote that the editorship

:&quot;had cost me many thousand hours of unpaid labour, a hideous character assassination in &quot;Private Eye&quot;, three lawsuits, two interrogations, one expulsion, the loss of a university career in Britain, unendingly contemptuous reviews, Tory suspicion, and the hatred of decent liberals everywhere. And it was worth it.&quot;

==Honeyford affair==
A controversy involving Ray Honeyford, headmaster of Drummond Middle School in Bradford, Yorkshire, gave &quot;The Salisbury Review&quot; much publicity in 1984. According to Scruton: &quot;This episode was our first great success, and led to the 600 subscriptions that we needed.&quot;

An article written by Honeyford for the &quot;Review&quot; in 1984 discussed themes on ethnicity, culture and assimilation, and educational performance. He had already made public his views in two letters in 1982, to the &quot;Times Educational Supplement&quot; (TES) and a local Bradford paper, and then in an extended article in the &quot;TES&quot; in November 1982. In that, he rehearsed a number of points, in particular on where the onus for integration and the limiting factors for educational performance lie in the home family environment in immigrant families. He attacked what he saw as the misplaced use of multiculturalism in schools, and &#x27;political correctness&#x27; in the form of scrutiny of textbook material.

The 1984 &quot;Salisbury Review&quot; article &quot;Education and Race — an Alternative View&quot; covered similar ground, but caused a national outcry. Honeyford had already been in discussion with his local education authority after the 1982 &quot;TES&quot; article, in the context of Bradford Council guidelines on educational aims issued in that year, but had not been disciplined. After the second article he was disciplined, and was also the target of a campaign for his dismissal. He was sacked, reinstated and then took early retirement, about two years after &quot;The Salisbury Review&quot; article was published.

<text>Demolierer-Polka (Demolition Men&#x27;s Polka) op. 269 is a polka written by Johann Strauss II in 1862. The title chronicled a significant milestone in the history of Vienna, where earlier on 20 December 1857, Austrian emperor Franz Josef decreed that the city limits of the capital be expanded to cater to the further needs of a blooming and prosperous city. This would include the demolition of the ancient bastions surrounding the old inner city by scores of demolition men recruited from the Habsburg crownlands of Bohemia, Moravia and Croatia. This project would incorporate many of Vienna&#x27;s suburbs and the removal of the medieval fortifications were replaced by the magnificent Vienna Ring Road with parks, gardens and many other structures of architectural grandeur.

Strauss&#x27; famous polka was first performed at a soirée in the &#x27;Sperl&#x27; ballroom alongside his waltz Karnevalsbotschafter op. 270 on 22 November 1862. The polka does not, however, suggest anything from its unconventional title although it never runs out of typical Strauss good-humor and gaiety.

<text>Michel Chossudovsky (born 1946) is a Canadian economist and author. He is professor emeritus of economics at the University of Ottawa and the president and director of the Centre for Research on Globalization (CRG), which runs the website globalresearch.ca, founded in 2001, which publishes falsehoods and conspiracy theories. Chossudovsky has promoted conspiracy theories about 9/11.

In 2017, the Centre for Research on Globalization was accused by information warfare specialists at NATO’s Strategic Communications Centre of Excellence (STRATCOM) of playing a key role in the spread of pro-Russian propaganda. A report by the U.S. State Department in August 2020 accused the website of being a proxy for a Russian disinformation campaign.

== Biography ==
Chossudovsky is the son of a Russian Jewish émigré, the career United Nations diplomat and academic Evgeny Chossudovsky, and an Irish Protestant, Rachel Sullivan. Raised in Switzerland, Chossudovsky moved to Canada and joined the University of Ottawa in 1968. According to the &quot;Ottawa Citizen,&quot; Chossudovsky&#x27;s academic research kept him &quot;on the margins of mainstream academia,&quot; but won praise from anti-establishment intellectuals such as Noam Chomsky. In 2005, shortly after Chossudovsky began writing about terrorism, the &quot;Citizen&quot; reported that Chossudovsky&#x27;s was &quot;a popular figure among anti-globalization activists,&quot; and that some of his students referred to him as &quot;Canada&#x27;s Chomsky.&quot; At that time, some colleagues were becoming uncomfortable with Chossudovsky&#x27;s ideas, with one professor describing them as having &quot;a conspiratorial element.&quot;

In 2005, Chossudovsky published the book &quot;America&#x27;s &quot;War on Terrorism&quot;&quot;. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the &quot;conspiracy-minded book... argued that the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks were simply a pretext for American incursions into the Middle East, and that Bin Laden was nothing but a boogeyman created by the United States&quot;. The book was found on a bookshelf in Osama bin Laden&#x27;s Abbottabad, Pakistan compound. According to the &quot;Vox&quot; website, the book&#x27;s theory is that &quot;9/11 was a United States government conspiracy to start the Iraq War and enable a &#x27;new world order&#x27; to help corporate interests. Bin Laden was, at best, a pawn in CIA interests.&quot;

Chossudovsky has contributed to the French magazine &quot;Le Monde diplomatique.&quot; He is frequently quoted by or appears on the Kremlin-backed RT (formerly known as Russia Today) or in material issued by the Sputnik news agency. The Centre for Research on Globalization regularly reposts content from both outlets.

===Centre for Research on Globalization===

In 2001, Chossudovsky founded the Centre for Research on Globalization (CRG), becoming its director and the editor of its online resource, Global Research. Located in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, the CRG describes itself as an &quot;independent research and media organization&quot; providing &quot;analysis on issues which are barely covered by the mainstream media&quot;.

The Centre for Research on Globalization promotes conspiracy theories and falsehoods. According to Peter Knight, it &quot;published influential early articles alleging that the U.S. intelligence agencies had far more forewarning than they claimed&quot; of the September 11 attacks. that the United States and its allies fund al-Qaeda and the Islamic State, and that sarin was not used in the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack, which globalresearch.ca articles characterized as a false flag operation orchestrated by terrorists opposed to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Other articles published on the site have asserted that the 7 July 2005 London bombings were perpetrated by the United States, Israel, and United Kingdom. Chossudovsky has himself posted articles on the site which suggested that Osama bin Laden was a CIA asset, and accusing the United States, Israel and Britain of plotting to conquer the world. The centre has also promoted the Irish slavery myth, prompting a letter by more than 80 scholars debunking the myth.

According to PolitiFact, the Centre &quot;has advanced specious conspiracy theories on topics like 9/11, vaccines and global warming.&quot; &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; magazine has commented that the Centre &quot;sells books and videos that &#x27;expose&#x27; how the September 11 terrorist attacks were &#x27;most likely a special covert action&#x27; to &#x27;further the goals of corporate globalization.&#x27;&quot; A 2010 study categorized the website as a source of anti-vaccine misinformation. The Atlantic Council&#x27;s Digital Forensic Research Lab described it as &quot;pro-Putin and anti-NATO&quot;. &quot;The Jewish Tribune&quot;, citing a complaint from B&#x27;nai Brith Canada, describing the website as being &quot;rife with anti-Jewish conspiracy theory and Holocaust denial.&quot; Writing for &quot;The New Republic&quot; in 2013, Muhammad Idrees Ahmad, lecturer in digital journalism at the University of Stirling, describes the centre&#x27;s website as a &quot;conspiracy site&quot;.

In November 2017, &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; reported that the centre&#x27;s website was &quot;in the sights&quot; of NATO information warfare specialists investigating &quot;the online spread of pro-Russia propaganda and of disinformation.&quot; According to the &quot;Globe&quot;, NATO&#x27;s Strategic Communications Centre of Excellence (StratCom) believed that the site was playing a &quot;key accelerant role in helping popularize articles with little basis in fact that also happen to fit the narratives being pushed by the Kremlin&quot; and the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad. The report described the site as an &quot;online refuge for conspiracy theorists&quot; and suggested that NATO specialists viewed it as &quot;a link in a concerted effort to undermine the credibility of mainstream Western media—as well as the North American and European public&#x27;s trust in government and public institutions.&quot; Asked to comment on the report, Chossudovsky responded through his lawyer, saying that the Centre did not have ties to pro-Russia or pro-Assad networks, was not &quot;affiliated with governmental organizations&quot; and did not benefit from their support.

An August 2020 report by the U.S. State Department Global Engagement Center stated that Global Research is, by a significant margin, the most accessed proxy website allied with the pro-Kremlin disinformation campaign. By the estimation of report&#x27;s authors, it has accumulated 12.4 million page views, with around 351,247 readers for each article. Chossudovsky is a board member of other pro-Russian websites which attempt to spread conspiracy theories. Responding via his lawyer, this time to CBC News, Chossudovsky again denied the 2020 accusations made against him.

The CRG has been accused of spreading CCP propaganda. An article on Global Research making the false assertion that the coronavirus pandemic was not real was carried by 70 other outlets, according to the August 2020 State department report. Chossudovsky himself has described it as being a &quot;manufactured pandemic&quot;. Earlier in 2020, his list of 10 questions was tweeted by the foreign minister of Iran. They included the claim that the United States government was responsible for the international coronavirus pandemic. Global Research published an article entitled &quot;COVID-19: Further Evidence that the Virus Originated in the US&quot; was posted on social media by a senior official in the Chinese foreign ministry. Chinese state media have reported such unfounded speculation which has been carried by Chossudovsky&#x27;s website with, according to &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, misattributed sources. Reportedly, the two articles on this theme have since been removed from the globalresearch.ca website.

<text>EXEC II is a discontinued operating system developed for the UNIVAC 1107 by Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) while under contract to UNIVAC to develop the machine&#x27;s COBOL compiler. They developed EXEC II because Univac&#x27;s EXEC I operating system development was late. Because of this the COBOL compiler was actually designed to run under EXEC II, not EXEC I as specified in the original contract.

EXEC II is a batch processing operating system that supports a single job stream with concurrent spooling.

<doc id="1312854" wikidata="Q5323375" url="?curid=1312854" title="EMC E1">
<text>The EMC E1 was an early passenger-train diesel locomotive developing 1,800 hp, with an A1A-A1A wheel arrangement, and manufactured by Electro-Motive Corporation of La Grange, Illinois. They were built during 1937 and 1938 for the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway for a new generation of diesel-powered streamlined trains. 8 cab-equipped lead A units and three cabless booster B units were built. The initial three locomotives were AB pairs built to haul the Santa Fe&#x27;s &quot;Super Chief&quot; diesel streamliners, while the others were built as single A units to haul shorter trains. The locomotives were diesel-electrics with two Winton 201-A engines each, with each engine driving its own generator to power the traction motors. The E1 was the second model in a long line of passenger diesels of similar design known as EMD E-units. All Winton 201A-engined Santa Fe passenger units, including the E1s, were extensively rebuilt into the 80-class E8M engines in 1952–53. These were similar to production E8 models, but derated to 2,000 hp so as not to burn out the early traction (axle) motors (which were reused).

== Significance and influence ==
The E1—along with the more-or-less simultaneous EA/EB for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, the E2 for the Union Pacific Railroad, Chicago and North Western Railway and Southern Pacific Railroad, and the TA for the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad—represented an important step in the evolution of the passenger diesel locomotive. While the EA, E1, E2 and TA were each built for a specific railroad, they were largely identical mechanically (though the TA used a single Winton 201-A diesel of sixteen cylinders, and produced only 1,200 horsepower), and were a step further away from the custom-built, integrated streamliner and towards mass-produced passenger locomotives—a step achieved with the E3, EMD&#x27;s next model.

== Styling ==
The EA/EB and E1 featured largely identical and innovative styling showing the influence of the Electro-Motive Corporation&#x27;s new owner General Motors. While mechanically they had much in common with previous, experimental EMC locomotives, GM understood the importance of looking new and exciting, not merely being technically innovative. This basic &quot;slant nose&quot; style was continued in the subsequent E3, E4, E5 and E6 models, while a more &quot;bulldog nose&quot; style was tried in the E2 and a style somewhere in between was used for the E7, E8 and E9, as well as the freight diesel cab units. It could fairly be said that the overall styling influenced passenger locomotives around the world. The &quot;shovelnose&quot; styling was modified on later models because the streamlined headlight was found less satisfactory than more common types with vertical lenses, and the elegantly sloped nose had a bad habit of deflecting vehicles up toward the cab in a grade crossing collision. More enduring was the paint scheme—E1 number two and her booster #2A were the first locomotives to wear the world-famous Santa Fe &quot;Warbonnet&quot; red and silver colors. In fact, these units used stainless steel sides on the car body to better match the road&#x27;s new stainless passenger cars. This decor was not developed by the Santa Fe, but by EMC—or rather, by GM&#x27;s Art and Color section.

== Numbers and assignments ==

Each E1 was initially ordered for and assigned to a particular train. The ATSF practice was to give all locomotive units in a set the same number, distinguished by letter. The lead unit was designated &#x27;L&#x27;, but this was not carried on its numberboards. The second unit was &#x27;A&#x27;; subsequent units were &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;C&#x27;, if present. This numbering was part of the railroad&#x27;s ultimately successful campaign to convince the railroad unions that a multiple-unit diesel locomotive should be considered one locomotive of several parts (and thus needing only one crew) rather than multiple locomotives requiring multiple crews under union agreements.
* 2 and 2A - for the original streamlined &quot;Super Chief&quot;.
* 3 and 3A - for the second streamlined &quot;Super Chief&quot; trainset.
* 4 and 4A - &quot;protection&quot; (backup) power for the &quot;Super Chief&quot;.
* 5 - for the &quot;El Capitan&quot;.
* 6 - for the &quot;El Capitan&quot;.
* 7 - for the &quot;San Diegan&quot;.
* 8 - for the &quot;Golden Gate&quot;.
* 9 - for the &quot;Golden Gate&quot;.

About a month before inaugurating &quot;Golden Gate&quot; service, units 8 and 9 inaugurated the &quot;Chicagoan/Kansas Cityan&quot; streamlined coach trains. After the publicity photos and promotional runs had been done with these handsome units, these services were taken over by a strange-looking pair, the mechanically similar, heavily rebuilt numbers 1 and 10 (the latter being the former 1A) of 1935. Soon, additional equipment from the Budd Company allowed the Santa Fe to enlarge the wildly successful &quot;El Capitan&quot; beyond the original pair of five car consists. The 4/4A set, which originally sat around &quot;protecting&quot; the &quot;Super Chief&quot;, was pressed into regular service, and units five and six were combined to form one lashup. This provided four 3,600 horsepower lashups to serve these four trainsets in transcontinental service, providing twice-weekly service for both trains.

With the delivery of EMC E3, E6 and ALCO DL-107 and DL-108 units in 1940–41, the E1 units were less often used on the &quot;Super Chief&quot; and &quot;El Capitan&quot;. Instead they doubled up on the other trains as their consists were expanded, and occasionally handled the normally steam-powered &quot;Chief&quot;. In 1947, all the Santa Fe&#x27;s E1 locomotives were pulled from transcontinental service, and used on a variety of other services where the grades were not as severe. These units and the similarly powered 1 and 1A were rebuilt by EMD as E8M locomotives, eliminating the unreliable 201-A diesels. The first few units rebuilt retained their original numbers for a time, but as unit 1 was rebuilt as a booster, the group was renumbered 80-87 (cab units) and 80A-84A (boosters). Unit 3, as unit 82, was destroyed in a wreck near Hardin, Missouri in August 1959 and scrapped. The other units were sold in 1971.

None survive into preservation.

<doc id="1312856" wikidata="Q3272007" url="?curid=1312856" title="Yoshimoto Kogyo">
<text>is a Japanese entertainment conglomerate. It was founded in 1912, Osaka, as a traditional theatre, and has since grown to be one of the most influential companies in Japan, employing most of Japan&#x27;s popular owarai (comedy) talent, producing and promoting the shows they appear in. The two main headquarters are stationed in Osaka and Tokyo.

Yoshimoto has been expanding its business in recent years, due to the &quot;owarai&quot; boom. They now have their own comedy theme park in Otaru, Hokkaido and have begun signing the likes of musicians, producers, athletes and singers alongside business with the Japanese &quot;owarai&quot; industry.

==History==

===1912–1932: Establishment of Yoshimoto Kogyo-bu===

On April 1, 1912, Kichibei Yoshimoto and his wife Sei Yoshimoto purchased the Second Arts Building in Osaka. They later established Yoshimoto Kogyo-bu in January 1913 in Shinsaibashi. In 1922, they purchased two theatre establishments in January and May in Tokyo and Yokohama.

===1932–2005: Rename to Yoshimoto Kogyo, influence on &quot;manzai&quot;===
On March 1, 1932, Yoshimoto Kogyobu changed its name to Yoshimoto Kogyo and set up their second headquarters in Tokyo. In 1933, Yoshimoto Kogyo&#x27;s film department was established. Yoshimoto helped shape the manzai comedic style after World War II, and the kanji that used for the word &quot;manzai&quot; were introduced by Yoshimoto in 1933. In November 1935, Asakusa Kagetsu Theatre opened under Yoshimoto Kogyo in Asakusa, Tokyo. In 1941, in collaboration with the national intelligence agency and the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, Yoshimoto Kogyo established the &quot;Yoshimoto Theatre Caravan&quot; and began tours across the nation. On February 13, 1943, Tsūtenkaku, a landmark tower owned by Yoshimoto, suffered a fire which severely damaged it. Rather than repairing the structure, it was disassembled with the steel and other materials used for the war effort. On March 10, 1945, Several theatres owned by Yoshimoto Kogyo were destroyed or severely damaged due to the Bombing of Tokyo. In October 1946, the Yoshimoto Kogyo headquarters in Tokyo split off from the main company to form its own entity as Yoshimoto Kabushiki Gaisha. In November 1946, Yoshimoto Kabushiki Gaisha established the &quot;Oizumi Eiko Kabushiki Gaisha&quot;, which later joined several other companies to form Toei Company. On May 14, 1949, Yoshimoto Kogyo began trading on the Osaka Securities Exchange.

In 1959, the company established its own comedy troupe theater group, Yoshimoto Shinkigeki. On October 2, 1961, Yoshimoto Kogyo began trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. From 1962 to 1963, the Kyoto Kagetsu Theater and the Namba Kagetsu Theater opened. In 1982, Yoshimoto New Star Creation was established in Osaka. A second headquarters in Tokyo was established in 1995.

===2005–present: Expansion===

==Controversies==

===Anti-social group scandal===

In 2019, several comedians associated with Yoshimoto Kogyo admitted they had accepted money and attended parties held by the yakuza in 2014 without the knowledge of the company. 11 celebrities under the company were suspended, one of whom included Hiroyuki Miyasako. Shinya Irie, a member of the comedy duo Karateka, was fired earlier for arranging their appearances at the party without the agency&#x27;s permission. President and CEO Akihiko Okamoto also admitted that the company had found out about the connection between the comedians and the anti-social forces but pressured the comedians to stay silent. Okamoto also apologized for Miyasako and Ryo Tamura and decided to reinstate their contracts after initially firing them. He and chairman Hiroshi Osaki vowed to take a 50% pay cut for one year as atonement over the scandal. The celebrities returned from suspension and resumed their activities on August 19, 2019.

<text>Robert James Waller (August 1, 1939 – March 10, 2017) was an American author best known for &quot;The Bridges of Madison County.&quot; He was also a professor, photographer, and musician.

==Biography==
Robert James Waller Jr. was born in Charles City, Iowa, and grew up in Rockford, Iowa. In 1961, he married Georgia Ann Wiedemeier. Waller received his BA (&#x27;62) and MA (&#x27;64) from University of Northern Iowa (then known as Iowa State Teachers College). He received his PhD in business from the Kelley School of Business at Indiana University Bloomington in 1968.

Later that year, he returned to UNI and began teaching management and economics and in 1977 became a full professor. He became the founding dean of the College of Business in 1980 and retired from that position in 1986. In addition to his teaching and administrative duties, Waller was also the director of the university&#x27;s International Business Institute. 

In 1992, Waller published his first novel, &quot;The Bridges of Madison County&quot;. It became a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller, the top best-seller in 1993. Both that novel and his 1995 novel &quot;Puerto Vallarta Squeeze&quot; have been made into motion pictures.

In 1997, Waller and his wife, Georgia, divorced. Around that time, he began a relationship with Linda Bow, whom he married in 2004. An article in &quot;People Magazine&quot; commented on the divorce: &quot;The parallels between Waller&#x27;s life and his art—his &quot;Bridges&quot; heroine, farmwife Francesca, sacrifices her chance for happiness with a globe-hopping photographer in order to stay home and shield her loved ones from small-town scandal—haven&#x27;t been lost on the locals.&quot; 

Waller died on March 10, 2017, at his home in Fredericksburg, Texas. He was 77 and had been battling multiple myeloma.

<doc id="1312869" wikidata="Q612300" url="?curid=1312869" title="Peter Frelinghuysen Jr.">
<text>Peter Hood Ballantine Frelinghuysen Jr. (January 17, 1916 – May 23, 2011) was an American politician and attorney. He represented New Jersey&#x27;s fifth congressional district in the United States House of Representatives as a Republican from 1953 to 1975.

==Early life and education==
Frelinghuysen was born in New York City to Peter H. B. Frelinghuysen and the former Adaline Havemeyer. Frelinghuysen&#x27;s father was a banker who descended from 18th century Dutch settlers in Somerset County. His siblings included his twin brother Henry O.H. Frelinghuysen, a philanthropist and civic leader, George G. Frelinghuysen, and Frederica Frelinghuysen Emert.

He came from a long line of New Jersey politicians dating back to the early years of the United States, including four United States senators and two House members. He was the grandson of George Griswold Frelinghuysen, great-grandson of Frederick T. Frelinghuysen, the great-great-nephew of Theodore Frelinghuysen, and the great-great-great-grandson of Frederick Frelinghuysen. He was also a great-great-grandson of Ballantine Brewery founder Peter Ballantine.

Frelinghuysen attended St. Mark&#x27;s School in Southborough, Massachusetts, before graduating from Princeton University in 1938 and Yale Law School in 1941.

==Career==
After practicing law in New York City, he served in the Office of Naval Intelligence from September 1942 to December 1945 obtaining the rank of lieutenant. He then studied at Columbia University, 1946–1947. He served as staff of the Foreign Affairs Task Force of the Hoover Commission in 1948 before returning to the private sector. He served as director of Howard Savings Bank in Livingston, New Jersey.

===U.S. Congress===
In 1952, he was elected to the House of Representatives from New Jersey&#x27;s 5th congressional district and served there until his retirement from politics in 1975. As a moderate Republican, Frelinghuysen voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960, 1964, and 1968, as well as the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, but not the Johnson administration&#x27;s War on Poverty programs, although he voted in favor of Medicare, a program that expanded medical assistance for the elderly.
In December 1959, when the Port of New York Authority&#x27;s plans to develop a tract of woodlands and marsh near his estate in Morris County as an international airport serving the New York City region were exposed, Frelinghuysen participated in the opposition by the Jersey Jetport Site Association that was composed of local residents and conservationists, which raised funds to purchase almost 3,000 acres of the targeted site and donated it to the federal government, to be preserved forever as park lands. With the defeat of the airport development initiative, that parcel became the initial portion of the Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge, established by federal statute on November 3, 1960, in the middle of the development controversy.

In January 1965, he was House Minority Leader Gerald Ford&#x27;s choice for Minority Whip, but lost on a secret ballot of the Republican caucus by a vote of 70 to 59 to the incumbent Les Arends, who had held the post since 1943.

===1966 blackmail incident===
In 1966, extortionists targeted Frelinghuysen for blackmail, arranging for him to have a sexual encounter with an underage male and then, posing as police officers, threatening him with public exposure. Frelinghuysen paid them $50,000. He later cooperated with the FBI&#x27;s investigation of the extortionist ring, but the Justice Department notified the leadership of the House of Representatives and Frelinghuysen was forced off the Armed Services Committee.

===Later life===
After leaving Congress, Frelinghuysen served on the boards of several nonprofit institutions, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the New York Botanical Garden.

==Personal life==
He married the former Beatrice Sterling Procter, in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, on September 7, 1940. She was a descendant of the founder of Procter &amp; Gamble. Their children include Peter Frelinghuysen II, a lawyer, and Rodney P. Frelinghuysen, a former congressman. They lived in a 20-room Georgian Colonial home on 32 acres in Harding Township, New Jersey, designed by James W. O&#x27;Connor in 1948.

His wife died in 1996. He died on May 23, 2011, at his home in Harding Township, New Jersey.

<doc id="1312887" wikidata="Q2405772" url="?curid=1312887" title="Handle with Care (song)">
<text>&quot;Handle with Care&quot; is a song by the British-American supergroup the Traveling Wilburys. It was released in October 1988 as their debut single and as the opening track of their album &quot;Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1&quot;. The song was the first recording made by the group, although it was originally intended as a bonus track on a European single by George Harrison. When he and Jeff Lynne presented the song to Harrison&#x27;s record company, the executives insisted it was too good for that purpose, a decision that resulted in the formation of the Wilburys. The song was written primarily by Harrison, although, as with all the tracks on &quot;Vol. 1&quot;, the writing credit lists all five members of the band: Harrison, Lynne, Bob Dylan, Roy Orbison and Tom Petty.

&quot;Handle with Care&quot; was the Wilburys&#x27; most successful single. It peaked at number 45 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the United States, number 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Album Rock Tracks chart and number 21 on the UK Singles Chart, and was a top-five hit in Australia and New Zealand. Directed by David Leland, the video for the song was an MTV favourite in the late 1980s.

Petty and his band the Heartbreakers often performed &quot;Handle with Care&quot; in concert. Lynne sang it with them at the Concert for George, a year after Harrison&#x27;s death in November 2001. Harrison&#x27;s son Dhani Harrison sang lead on the song with Jeff Lynne&#x27;s ELO during their 2019 US tour.

==Background==

&quot;Handle with Care&quot; came about through Warner Bros. Records, which distributed George Harrison&#x27;s Dark Horse record label, pressing Harrison for an extra track for the European release of his &quot;This Is Love&quot; single. Having arrived in Los Angeles in April 1988, Harrison discussed the request over dinner with Jeff Lynne, his co-producer on the &quot;Cloud Nine&quot; album, and Roy Orbison, whose album &quot;Mystery Girl&quot; Lynne was producing at the time. Lynne agreed to help him record the track the following day, and Harrison invited Orbison to attend the session, after Orbison had said he &quot;would like to come along and watch&quot;. With no professional studios available at such short notice, Harrison phoned Bob Dylan, who agreed to let them use his garage studio in Malibu. Tom Petty, who had also been working with Lynne in Los Angeles, was invited the following day, when Harrison went to retrieve his guitar from Petty&#x27;s house.

In a 1990 interview for the Dutch television show &quot;Countdown&quot;, Harrison said that he started writing &quot;Handle with Care&quot; – with a section in mind for Orbison to sing – on the morning of the session.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harrison/Countdown&quot;&gt; .&lt;/ref&gt; Lynne helped Harrison complete the music for the song when they arrived at Dylan&#x27;s house; according to Petty, Harrison had the chord sequence &quot;pretty much&quot; completed beforehand. In another contemporary interview, Harrison recalled that he had the opening line, &quot;Been beat-up and battered around&quot;, but otherwise, the lyrics were the result of a group effort. Harrison asked Dylan, who had been tending a barbecue for the musicians, to &quot;Give us some lyrics, you famous lyricist.&quot; When Dylan asked for a title for the song, Harrison looked around the garage and said, &quot;Handle with Care&quot;, after a label on a box.

All five musicians assisted in writing the song&#x27;s lyrics, and sang and played acoustic guitars on the basic track. Harrison said that, having already planned Orbison&#x27;s segment, he decided to include portions sung by Dylan, Lynne and Petty.
==Composition==
&quot;Handle with Care&quot; was written in the key of G major. The main riff and verses feature a four-bar chord sequence with a descending bass line. The first bridge includes a G augmented chord. The time signature throughout is 4/4, played to a moderate rock beat. In music journalist Matthew Greenwald&#x27;s description, the composition is &quot;built around a descending, folk-rock chord pattern and some ... major-key chorus movements&quot;. He identifies the song&#x27;s message as being &quot;about getting out from under the shell of the &#x27;60s fallout, along with a strong theme of survival&quot;.

The song&#x27;s structure comprises rounds containing three distinct sections: Harrison&#x27;s verses, the Orbison-sung &quot;I&#x27;m so tired of being lonely&quot; bridge, and a second bridge led by Dylan. Author Ian Inglis writes that Harrison&#x27;s verses reflect his having overcome hardships and challenges throughout his musical career, with the line &quot;Oh, the sweet smell of success!&quot; conveying a mix of optimism, resignation and cynicism regarding the concept of stardom. Inglis says that while the song bears &quot;Harrison&#x27;s distinctive musical and vocal signature&quot;, the Orbison-sung segments evoke the &quot;lonely&quot; theme that was a defining element of Orbison&#x27;s work from the late 1950s onwards, just as Dylan&#x27;s bridges, containing the line &quot;Put your body next to mine, and dream on&quot;, capture the &quot;straightforward sexuality&quot; evident in songs from that artist&#x27;s late 1960s country period.

==Recording and Wilburys&#x27; formation==
The ensemble taped the basic track of acoustic guitars, accompanied by a drum machine, on Dylan&#x27;s Ampex recorder. According to Lynne, the instruments used were a mix of six- and twelve-string guitars. Having been invited by Harrison to assist with the recording, engineer Bill Bottrell recalled that the garage studio had yet to be set up and the equipment was a mix of seemingly unused items.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hurwitz/Mix&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The released recording includes Harrison&#x27;s electric guitar riff, played on a Rickenbacker 12-string,&lt;ref name=&quot;Levith/UCR&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and slide guitar solos, and Dylan on harmonica. The electric and bass guitars were added to the basic track on the day after the session at Dylan&#x27;s house, and drummer Ian Wallace overdubbed tom-toms. According to Petty and Bottrell, Lynne played drums on the track and added a cowbell. The overdubbing session took place at Westlake Audio on Santa Monica Boulevard. Lynne said that they had invited Jim Keltner to play drums but he was unavailable. Wallace recalled that Lynne asked him to add some fills to the existing drum part, which Wallace said was a drum machine part, and that the venue was Quincy Jones&#x27; studio in Los Angeles, with all the Wilburys present except for Dylan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Perrone/Independent&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

When Harrison presented a mix of &quot;Handle with Care&quot; to Warner Bros., the company&#x27;s executives insisted that the track was too good to be used as &quot;filler&quot; on a European single. He recalled that they thought the song would be wasted since it would not benefit &quot;Cloud Nine&quot;″s sales. In Petty&#x27;s recollection, Harrison and Lynne then decided to realise their idea of forming the Traveling Wilburys,&lt;ref name=&quot;Zimmer/BAM&quot;&gt; Available at Rock&#x27;s Backpages (subscription required).&lt;/ref&gt; a band they had imagined during the sessions for &quot;Cloud Nine&quot;. On Harrison&#x27;s next visit to Los Angeles, from 8 May onwards, he, Lynne, Dylan, Orbison and Petty began recording the album &quot;Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1&quot;. The recordings were completed by Harrison and Lynne, the Wilburys&#x27; producers, over the summer, at Harrison&#x27;s Friar Park studio in England.

==Video==

The Wilburys filmed a music video for &quot;Handle with Care&quot; in early October 1988, at an abandoned brewery near Union Station in Los Angeles. It was directed by David Leland, who had recently directed Harrison&#x27;s HandMade Films production &quot;Checking Out&quot;. The video features the group members performing the song around an old-fashioned omnidirectional microphone. The band were dressed and styled by Roger Burton, whose stylist credits included the films &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; and &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot;, and music videos for David Bowie, Eurythmics and UB40.

The video was the last to feature Orbison, who died of a heart attack on 6 December. Lynne recalls that, as they all travelled together to the film shoot, Orbison kept the band entertained by reciting entire Monty Python comedy sketches by himself. Lynne continues: &quot;And he&#x27;s got this enormous and most infectious giggle you&#x27;ve ever heard, and we&#x27;d all be giggling like schoolgirls after a minute or two and all fall about!&quot; At the time, Lynne described the video as a &quot;nice film, where we&#x27;re just playing, with nice shots of guitars and heads and feet&quot;, and free of &quot;gimmicks and fireworks&quot;. Orbison was dressed in a long black coat, black trousers and red shoes, and wore his usual diamond-encrusted Maltese cross brooch.

==Release==
Backed by &quot;Margarita&quot;, &quot;Handle with Care&quot; was issued as the Wilburys&#x27; debut single on 17 October 1988, and as the opening track of &quot;Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1&quot; the following day. Although the group were viewed as being mainly Harrison&#x27;s project, all the participants were keen to maintain a collaborative identity. Rather than use his Dark Horse label, they released the single and the album on a new Warner&#x27;s imprint, Wilbury Records. The bandmates similarly shared the songwriting credits, although the allocation of each song&#x27;s publishing rights reflected its main composer. In the case of &quot;Handle with Care&quot;, the song was allocated to Harrison and his Ganga publishing company, which was later subsumed into his company Umlaut Corporation.

Aside from the standard 7-inch record and 3-inch CD releases, the single was available in the 10- and 12-inch vinyl formats, both of which used an extended version of the A-side. In the US, the CD single included both the standard-length and extended versions of &quot;Handle with Care&quot;. The single&#x27;s cover art was designed by Wherefore Art? and included a group photograph taken by Neal Preston.

According to authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter, the song received widespread airplay on US radio and the video was given &quot;saturation play&quot; on MTV and VH-1. Although the album was a major commercial success there, the popularity of the single failed to translate into sales. On the US charts compiled by &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, &quot;Handle with Care&quot; peaked at number 45 on the Hot 100, yet number 2 on the radioplay-based Album Rock Tracks chart. Elsewhere, it reached number 21 on the UK Singles Chart, number 3 in Australia, where &quot;Vol. 1&quot; was the best-selling album of 1989, and number 4 in New Zealand. It was the highest charting of all the Wilburys&#x27; singles in the UK and the US.

==Critical reception and legacy==
As with &quot;Vol. 1&quot;, &quot;Handle with Care&quot; received highly favourable reviews from music critics, even though the Wilburys&#x27; sound was at odds with contemporary musical trends. In a review of their second album, which Harrison chose to title &quot;Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3&quot;, Elizabeth Wurtzel of &quot;New York&quot; magazine highlighted &quot;Handle with Care&quot; among the Wilburys&#x27; &quot;upbeat, irresistible songs ... that unified the rock audience&quot; in 1988, by presenting the middle-aged stars as a &quot;new act&quot; to young listeners while also finding favour with the babyboomer market.

In his song review for AllMusic, Matthew Greenwald writes of &quot;Handle with Care&quot;:
The opening track to the star-studded Traveling Wilburys album puts the group and their attitude in one compact package ... George Harrison handles the verses, and there are also two excellent bridges featuring Roy Orbison and Bob Dylan. Orbison&#x27;s section capitalizes on his awesome, operatic vocal pipes, and the effect is wonderful ... In the end, the joy of camaraderie is what hits the listener the hardest and makes this one of the most memorable records of the 1980s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwald/AM&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Cash Box&quot; called it &quot;a fine song, with each section&#x27;s style seemingly fitting the singer&#x27;s writing style...George opening, Roy lifting, and an ensemble chorus.&quot;

Author Howard Sounes says that, for Dylan, his friendship with Harrison enabled a collaboration that saved Dylan&#x27;s career at a time when it was &quot;reaching its nadir&quot;. He adds that the song had &quot;a clever lyric about middle age and a strong melody&quot; and featured an Orbison vocal performance that &quot;soared&quot;. Matt Melis of &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; lists &quot;Handle with Care&quot; tenth in his &quot;Top Ten Songs by Ex-Beatles&quot;, saying that the Wilburys showed Harrison &quot;at his absolute best since his solo work in the early Seventies&quot; and, following this first spontaneous collaboration, &quot;The rest is super group history.&quot;

Ian Inglis describes &quot;Handle with Care&quot; as a &quot;glorious example of the way in which a synthesis of contrasting talents can produce music that is effortless and natural&quot;. With reference to the musical eras represented by Orbison, Harrison and Dylan, respectively, he concludes: &quot;its real significance rests ... on its symbolic fusion of three revolutionary moments in the history of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll that had their beginnings in Sam Phillips&#x27; Sun Studio in Memphis, in the clubs and bars of Liverpool and Hamburg, and in the folk venues of New York&#x27;s Greenwich Village.&quot; Author Simon Leng views the song as a &quot;worthy hit&quot; that displays the three lead singers&#x27; styles to equally good effect and, in the closing solos by Harrison and Dylan, features &quot;two of the most famous instrumental signatures in popular music [playing] in tandem&quot;. Jeff Burger, writing for &quot;The Morton Report&quot; in 2016, highlighted &quot;Handle with Care&quot; and &quot;Not Alone Any More&quot; as &quot;Vol. 1&quot;″s fun-filled &quot;ear candy&quot; that &quot;profit from Orbison&#x27;s inimitable soaring vocals, Harrison&#x27;s trademark guitar, and Lynne&#x27;s production&quot;.

In an article covering the launch of the expanded edition of Harrison&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;I, Me, Mine&quot;, in 2017, &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Andy Gensler commented that &quot;Handle with Care&quot; remained a fixture on FM radio.
In May 2018, the track was used to close the &quot;All the Wilburys&quot; episode of the US television show &quot;Billions&quot;. The Wilburys&#x27; group dynamic is referred to in the episode, when the character Ari Spyros, a socially awkward compliance officer, shouts &quot;Handle me with care!&quot; in an effort to persuade his colleagues that he is worthy of Wilbury status.

==Live performances and cover versions ==

Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers and Lynne performed &quot;Handle with Care&quot; at the Concert for George tribute in November 2002, a year after Harrison&#x27;s death, and at Harrison&#x27;s induction as a solo artist into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004. Petty and the Heartbreakers introduced the song into the set list for their own shows in 2003. A live recording appears on the band&#x27;s 2005 DVD &quot;Live in Concert: Soundstage&quot;, recorded in Chicago for the &quot;Soundstage&quot; television series. In the &quot;Concert for George&quot; documentary film, which was again directed by David Leland, Petty and Lynne&#x27;s performance is interspersed with interview footage in which Petty discusses the writing of the song.

On 14 September 2014, during the BBC Radio 2 Festival in a Day event in London&#x27;s Hyde Park, Lynne performed &quot;Handle with Care&quot; as a tribute to Harrison and Orbison. The performance was accompanied by images of the two late Wilburys projected onto the backdrop of the stage.

In 2006, Jenny Lewis covered &quot;Handle with Care&quot; on her debut solo album, &quot;Rabbit Fur Coat&quot;, recorded with the Watson Twins, Ben Gibbard, Conor Oberst and M. Ward.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gill/Independent&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; While Andy Gill of &quot;The Independent&quot; said that the confident performance by Lewis and her collaborators &quot;ensures that even a cover as unhip as The Traveling Wilburys&#x27; &#x27;Handle With Care&#x27; sounds engaging&quot;, Will Levith of &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; dismissed it as a &quot;terrible&quot; version that resembled a &quot;boozy, late-night karaoke&quot; rendition next to the superlative performances of Harrison and Orbison on the Wilburys&#x27; &quot;classic&quot;. Writing in March 2007, after the announcement that the long-unavailable Wilburys&#x27; catalogue was about to be reissued, in the box set &quot;The Traveling Wilburys Collection&quot;, Whitney Pastorek of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; said: &quot;while Petty&#x27;s been doing the tune in concert for years, Jenny Lewis&#x27; decision to cover that song on last year&#x27;s &quot;Rabbit Fur Coat&quot; seemed to get plenty of hipsters asking, Dude, how come I can&#x27;t buy the original? And, as we all know, what the hipsters want, the hipsters get. Huzzah!&quot;

Damien Leith included &quot;Handle with Care&quot; on his 2011 Orbison tribute album &quot;&quot;. At the 2014 George Fest tribute in Los Angeles, organised by Harrison&#x27;s son Dhani, the song was performed as the penultimate number by an ensemble including Brandon Flowers, Dhani Harrison, &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic, Britt Daniel and Wayne Coyne. Reviewing the 2016 album and DVD release from the concert, for &quot;PopMatters&quot;, Megan Volpert wrote: &quot;The gentlemen collaborate with Dhani on the Wilburys&#x27; &#x27;Handle with Care&#x27;, audibly evoking not just the noises of George, but also the ghost of Roy Orbison and almost hilariously good impersonations of Tom Petty and Jeff Lynne ... Dhani could&#x27;ve gotten Petty and Lynne, no doubt – but he is working on something arguably more important here than what Concert for George hoped to accomplish.&quot; In 2017, Stephen Stills and Judy Collins released a version of the song as the opening track of their album &quot;Everybody Knows&quot;.

Dhani Harrison sang &quot;Handle with Care&quot; as a featured guest during Jeff Lynne and ELO&#x27;s tour of the US in the summer of 2019.

<text>Martin Ingerman (March 9, 1936 – October 21, 2015), known professionally as Marty Ingels, was an American actor, comedian, comedy sketch writer, and theatrical agent, who is best known as the co-star of the 1960s television series&quot; I&#x27;m Dickens, He&#x27;s Fenster&quot;.

==Early life==
Ingels was born as Martin Ingerman to a Jewish family in 1936 in Brooklyn, New York City, the son of Jacob and Minnie (née Crown) Ingerman. His uncle was Abraham Beame, the mayor of New York City from 1974 to 1977.

Ingels joined the Army where a talent scout spotted him for the televise quiz show &quot;Name That Tune&quot;. He won several thousand dollars and became known for his humorous repartee. He used his winnings to study at the Pasadena Playhouse.

==Career==

Ingels&#x27; acting career dates back to the early 1960s. He co-starred in the ABC sitcom, &quot;I&#x27;m Dickens, He&#x27;s Fenster&quot; (1962–63) with John Astin, which lasted one season of thirty-two episodes.

Ingels guest-starred on the CBS sitcoms &quot;Pete and Gladys&quot;, &quot;The Ann Sothern Show&quot;, &quot;Hennesey&quot;, and appeared twice as Sol Pomeroy, an army buddy of the character Rob Petrie, on &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;. He also appeared in one episode of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Bewitched&quot; as &quot;Diaper Dan&quot;, who plants a microphone bug in Tabitha&#x27;s rattle so a competing advertising agency can scoop and steal Darrin&#x27;s ideas. In 1978, Ingels guest starred in Season Two, episode One of &quot;The Love Boat&quot;.

His voice-overs and commercials include those for Paul Masson wines. He played Autocat in the &quot;Motormouse and Autocat&quot; cartoons featured first on &quot;The Cattanooga Cats&quot; and then in a series of their own, and was Beegle Beagle in &quot;The Great Grape Ape Show&quot;. He was also the voice of the title character in the animated series adaptation of the 1980 video game &quot;Pac-Man&quot;. In 2010, Ingels was cast in an episode of CBS&#x27;s &quot;&quot;.

He also acted in films, including &quot;Armored Command&quot; (1961), &quot;The Horizontal Lieutenant&quot; (1962), &quot;Wild and Wonderful&quot; (1964), &quot;The Busy Body&quot; (1967), &quot;A Guide for the Married Man&quot; (1967), &quot;For Singles Only&quot; (1968), &quot;The Picasso Summer&quot; (1969), &quot;If It&#x27;s Tuesday, This Must Be Belgium&quot; (1969), &quot;Linda Lovelace for President&quot; (1975), and &quot;Instant Karma&quot; (1990). 

Beginning in the 1970s, Ingels worked primarily as an agent, specializing in representing actors in celebrity endorsement ads.

==Personal life==
Ingels was married twice: first to Jean Marie Frassinelli in 1960; they divorced in 1969 after nine years of marriage. On November 13, 1977, he married singer/actress Shirley Jones. Despite some drastically different personalities, and several separations (Shirley filed, then withdrew, a divorce petition in 2002), the couple remained married until his death in 2015.

===Lawsuits===
Ingels was also known for frequent legal actions, so much that in his &quot;The New York Times&quot; obituary Margalit Fox wrote: &quot;[Ingels] always seemed to be suing someone, and someone always seemed to be suing him&quot;.

In 1993, Ingels sued actress June Allyson for his talent agency commission. Allyson had appeared in commercials for Depend undergarments; Ingels alleged that he was not paid his proper commission as her agent. Allyson denied this and countersued. Ingels pleaded no contest to making harassing phone calls to Allyson.

In 2003, he sued radio personality Tom Leykis and Westwood One, saying that comments made about him constituted age discrimination. Ingels had called into Leykis&#x27;s radio program objecting to the content, and Leykis declared on the air that Ingels was &quot;not just older than my demographic, you&#x27;re the grandfather of my demographic.&quot; In June 2005, Ingels&#x27;s lawsuit was dismissed and Ingels was ordered to pay Leykis&#x27;s $25,000 in legal fees.

==Death==
Ingels died from a massive stroke at Tarzana Medical Center in Tarzana, California on October 21, 2015, at the age of 79. After Ingels&#x27;s death, Jones stated &quot;He often drove me crazy, but there&#x27;s not a day I won&#x27;t miss him and love him to my core.&quot;

<text>Ismo Kullervo Alanko (; born November 12, 1960) is a Finnish musician. He is known as the frontman of several bands, most famously Hassisen Kone, Sielun Veljet and Ismo Alanko Säätiö, as well as a successful solo artist.

Alanko is known for his versatility and interest in different musical styles. During his career he has recorded punk rock, alternative rock, progressive rock, electronic music, schlager, dance music, children&#x27;s music and film scores. He has achieved eight platinum records, 16 gold records and four Emma awards. Also a recognized lyricist, Alanko won the Juha Vainio Writer&#x27;s Award (Juha Vainio -sanoittajapalkinto) in 2003 for his song texts.

In a &quot;City&quot; magazine article in 1999, 43 Finnish journalists picked the top 99 Finnish rock artists. Ismo Alanko placed 20th, with his former bands Hassisen Kone and Sielun Veljet placing 12th and 4th, respectively.

Alanko comes from a musical family: of his two younger brothers, Petri Alanko is a reputed classical flute player, Ilkka Alanko is the singer/guitarist of Neljä Ruusua, and his sister Satu Alanko-Rautamaa a violinist, and a member or the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra.

== Biography ==
=== Background ===
Alanko was born on November 12, 1960, in Kerava, but grew up in Joensuu, North Karelia. As a 15-year-old he played in a band called Sight, already writing some of his own songs. In the Finnish Rock Championship, an annual competition for young musicians, the band finished second in the progressive rock category. After completing his secondary education degree (&quot;ylioppilastutkinto&quot;), he took a break from music to move to work in Stockholm.

=== Hassisen Kone ===

After returning to Finland in 1979, Alanko, then 19 years of age, gained immediate success as the singer, songwriter and rhythm guitarist of the new wave group Hassisen Kone. They won the Finnish rock championship in 1980 and recorded three very successful albums, &quot;Täältä tullaan Venäjä&quot;, &quot;Rumat sävelet&quot; and &quot;Harsoinen teräs&quot;, where the band went from punk-related new wave to progressive rock. All three remain among the best-selling records in Alanko&#x27;s career. Hassisen Kone disbanded in 1982.

=== Sielun Veljet ===

Soon after Hassisen Kone broke up, Alanko and former Hassisen Kone guitarist Jukka Orma started Sielun Veljet. Some of their early audience was expecting another Hassisen Kone, but instead the band played aggressive and repetitive post-punk. Only one Sielun Veljet album came close to reaching Hassisen Kone&#x27;s album sales (&quot;L&#x27;amourha&quot;, 1985), but the band gained fame for their powerful, loud and intense live performances. The band toured constantly and played a wide variety of musical styles, including old schlager hits under the alias Kullervo Kivi &amp; Gehenna. Sielun Veljet quit in 1991, after seven studio albums, two EPs, a box set and a 1991 documentary film titled &quot;Veljet&quot;.

=== Solo career ===
Alanko&#x27;s solo debut, &quot;Kun Suomi putos puusta&quot;, was released in 1990. At this point Sielun Veljet still existed, but the band had become less and less active. After the band broke up, Alanko recorded the electronic music -influenced &quot;Jäätyneitä lauluja&quot; and toured Finland with his band that was named Tuonelan Lukio. The band&#x27;s keyboardist was Izmo Heikkilä of the band Raptori. Alanko went on to release two more solo albums, &quot;Taiteilijaelämää&quot; (1995) and &quot;Irti&quot; (1996).

In 1997, a four-CD box set &quot;Alangolla – Ismo Alangon lauluja&quot; was released. It spanned his entire career starting from Hassisen Kone and including material from different side projects. Until then, very few Finnish artists had released a box set. Sielun Veljet had released &quot;Musta laatikko&quot; in 1991 and CMX their collection &quot;Cloaca Maxima&quot; in 1997.

Alanko&#x27;s most popular song, &quot;Pop-musiikkia&quot;, was recorded in 1997 with fellow rock stars Ilkka Alanko (of Neljä Ruusua), Kalle Ahola (of Don Huonot) and A. W. Yrjänä (of CMX) under the name Neljä baritonia (Four Baritones). The single has been certified platinum in Finland and is one of the most successful songs of all time on the Finnish singles chart.

In 2002, Alanko appeared on Timo Rautiainen&#x27;s platinum-selling &quot;Tiernapojat&quot; play with Jarkko Martikainen, Toni Wirtanen and Rautiainen himself, playing King Herod.

In 2009, Alanko continues his varied projects playing with contemporary Finnish artists. In April he joined former Alanko Säätiö percussionist Teho Majamäki onstage as Teholla at Helsinki&#x27;s mini-festival Arctic Paradise Live, having the same evening performed a solo concert in the Ateneum Art Museum series (A Land Without Kantele) with resident houseband of Jarmo Saari (guitars), Arttu Tolonen (bass) and Abdissa &quot;Mamba&quot; Assefa (drums).

=== Ismo Alanko Säätiö ===

In 1998, Alanko started the semi-ironically named Ismo Alanko Säätiö (Ismo Alanko Foundation). Though Säätiö performed many of Alanko&#x27;s old hits, the arrangements were radically revamped to fit with their unique acoustic sound, heavily featuring the avant-garde accordion sound of Kimmo Pohjonen, a successful artist in his own right. Even though Säätiö is a band, it can be said that it is a backing band for solo performances by Alanko, as members of the band have changed rapidly.

=== Ismo Alanko Teholla ===
In 2007, Alanko ended Säätiö in its current form, and began touring with multi-instrumentalist Teho Majamäki as &quot;Ismo Alanko Teholla&quot;. The name of the band is a play on words, and can mean either &quot;Ismo Alanko with Power&quot; or &quot;Ismo Alanko in ICU (Intensive Care Unit)&quot;.

== Instruments ==
Alanko studied classical cello in his youth, but didn&#x27;t pursue a classical career because he felt it would require too much practice. In Hassisen Kone and onwards, he has played rhythm guitar in his bands in addition to singing. He still occasionally plays the cello, as well as the piano, both in the studio and on live performances.

Alanko composed the music for the 2007 TV series &quot;Taivaan tulet&quot; by Kari Väänänen. Alanko also played all instruments for the score, except for flute parts that were played by his brother Petri. Alanko has said that the decision to play all the instruments himself came &quot;out of curiosity&quot;.

<text>Wrong Is Right, released in the UK as The Man with the Deadly Lens, is a 1982 American political satire comedy thriller film directed, written, and co-produced by Richard Brooks and starring Sean Connery as TV news reporter Patrick Hale. The film, based on Charles McCarry&#x27;s novel &quot;The Better Angels&quot; (1979), is about the theft of two suitcase nukes.

==Plot==
In the near future, violence has become something of a national sport and television news has fallen to tabloid depths. Patrick Hale, a globe-trotting reporter with access to a staggering array of world leaders, has ventured to the Arab country of Hegreb to interview his old acquaintance, King Ibn Awad.

Awad has learned that the President of the United States may have issued orders for his removal; as a result, Awad is apparently making arrangements to deliver two suitcase nukes to a terrorist, with the intention of detonating them in Israel and the United States, unless the President resigns.

In the intricate plot that unfolds, nothing is quite the way it seems, and Hale finds himself caught between political leaders, revolutionaries, CIA agents and other figures, trying to get to the bottom of it all.

In the final twist, the government, with Hale in tow, locates two atomic bombs supposedly planted by terrorist &quot;Rafeeq&quot; atop the World Trade Center. The US uses this as pretext for invading the Middle East and taking possession of oilfields. Hale correctly intuits that the government had planted the bombs in order to rally US support for the invasion, but gladly covers the story the way the government wants in exchange for front-line access to film the action.

==Cast==
== Production ==

Filming locations include El Paso, &quot; New York, Washington, D.C., Texas, New Mexico, France, Italy&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;AFI/WiR&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; the Alamo in San Antonio, White Sands National Park, &quot;Alamogordo and Albuquerque&quot;, and others.

Brooks made a product placement deal with the Sony, which allowed use of Sony television monitors and news equipment.

== Critical reception ==
The film received negative reviews from critics who cited its &quot;unfocused script&quot; that tries &quot;to satirize so many targets&quot;, as well as its confusing visuals.

Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said the screenplay was scattershot and Connery&#x27;s performance is &quot;the first uncertain [one] of his otherwise exemplary career&quot;.

Based on 11 reviews on review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Wrong Is Right&quot; has an approval score of 27%.

Stanley Kauffmann of &quot;The New Republic&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;Wrong Is Right&quot; is possibly the noisiest film ever made, and the most incessantly whirling one. Its only distinction is that, besides being basically rotten, it is also rotten on the surface.&quot;

Donald Guarisco of AllMovie said, &quot;If viewed through a cult-movie mindset, it&#x27;s easy to see why &quot;Wrong Is Right&quot; is appealing to that group of viewers. The script has a scathing, darkly funny take on international politics that one wouldn&#x27;t expect from a well-funded Hollywood project of the early 1980&#x27;s and also mixes up offbeat humor and message-oriented drama in a way that keeps the film from affecting a comfortable Hollywood style.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;variety/1200425053&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and nominations==
Rosalind Cash was nominated for an NAACP Image Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture.

<text>An English country house is a large house or mansion in the English countryside. Such houses were often owned by individuals who also owned a town house. This allowed them to spend time in the country and in the city—hence, for these people, the term distinguished between town and country. However, the term also encompasses houses that were, and often still are, the full-time residence for the landed gentry who dominated rural Britain until the Reform Act 1832. Frequently, the formal business of the counties was transacted in these country houses, having functional antecedents in manor houses.

With large numbers of indoor and outdoor staff, country houses were important as places of employment for many rural communities. In turn, until the agricultural depressions of the 1870s, the estates, of which country houses were the hub, provided their owners with incomes. However, the late 19th and early 20th centuries were the swansong of the traditional English country house lifestyle. Increased taxation and the effects of World War I led to the demolition of hundreds of houses; those that remained had to adapt to survive.

While a château or a &quot;Schloss&quot; can be a fortified or unfortified building, a country house, similar to an &quot;Ansitz&quot;, is usually unfortified. If fortified, it is called a castle, but not all buildings with the name &quot;castle&quot; are fortified (for example Highclere Castle in Hampshire).

==Stately homes of England==
The term &quot;stately home&quot; is subject to debate, and avoided by historians and other academics. As a description of a country house, the term was first used in a poem by Felicia Hemans, &quot;The Homes of England&quot;, originally published in &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in 1827. In the 20th century, the term was later popularised in a song by Noël Coward, and in modern usage it often implies a country house that is open to visitors at least some of the time.

In England, the terms &quot;country house&quot; and &quot;stately home&quot; are sometimes used vaguely and interchangeably; however, many country houses such as Ascott in Buckinghamshire were deliberately designed not to be stately, and to harmonise with the landscape, while some of the great houses such as Kedleston Hall and Holkham Hall were built as &quot;power houses&quot; to dominate the landscape, and were most certainly intended to be &quot;stately&quot; and impressive. In his book &quot;Historic Houses: Conversations in Stately Homes&quot;, the author and journalist Robert Harling documents nineteen &quot;stately homes&quot;; these range in size from the vast Blenheim Palace and Castle Howard to the minuscule Ebberston Hall, and in architecture from the Jacobean Renaissance of Hatfield House to the eccentricities of Sezincote. The book&#x27;s collection of stately homes also includes George IV&#x27;s Brighton town palace, the Royal Pavilion.

== Evolution ==

The country houses of England have evolved over the last five hundred years. Before this time, larger houses were usually fortified, reflecting the position of their owners as feudal lords, &quot;de facto&quot; overlords of their manors. The Tudor period of stability in the country saw the building of the first of the unfortified great houses. Henry VIII&#x27;s Dissolution of the Monasteries saw many former ecclesiastical properties granted to the King&#x27;s favourites, who then converted them into private country houses. Woburn Abbey, Forde Abbey and many other mansions with &quot;abbey&quot; or &quot;priory&quot; in their name became private houses during this period. Other terms used in the names of houses to describe their origin or importance include &quot;palace&quot;, &quot;castle&quot;, &quot;court&quot;, &quot;hall&quot;, &quot;mansion&quot;, &quot;park&quot;, &quot;house&quot;, &quot;manor&quot;, and &quot;place&quot;.

It was during the second half of the reign of Elizabeth I, and under her successor, James I, that the first architect-designed mansions, thought of today as epitomising the English country house, began to make their appearance. Burghley House, Longleat House, and Hatfield House are among the best-known examples of the showy prodigy house, often built with the intention of attracting the monarch to visit. By the reign of Charles I, Inigo Jones and his form of Palladianism had changed the face of English domestic architecture completely, with the use of turrets and towers as an architectural reference to the earlier castles and fortified houses completely disappearing. The Palladian style, in various forms, interrupted briefly by baroque, was to predominate until the second half of the 18th century when, influenced by ancient Greek styles, it gradually evolved into the neoclassicism championed by such architects as Robert Adam.

Some of the best known of England&#x27;s country houses were the work of only one architect/designer, built in a relatively short, particular time: Montacute House, Chatsworth House, and Blenheim Palace are examples. While the latter two are ducal palaces, Montacute, although built by a Master of the Rolls to Queen Elizabeth I, was occupied for the next 400 years by his descendants, who were gentry without a London townhouse, rather than aristocracy. They finally ran out of funds in the early 20th century.

However, the vast majority of English country houses, often owned at different times by gentlemen and peers, are an evolution of one or more styles with facades and wings in different styles in a mixture of high architecture, often as interpreted by a local architect or surveyor, and determined by practicality as much as by the whims of architectural taste. An example of this is Brympton d&#x27;Evercy in Somerset, a house of many periods that is unified architecturally by the continuing use of the same mellow, local Ham Hill stone.

The fashionable William Kent redesigned Rousham House only to have it quickly and drastically altered to provide space for the owner&#x27;s twelve children. Canons Ashby, home to poet John Dryden&#x27;s family, is another example of architectural evolution: a medieval farmhouse enlarged in the Tudor era around a courtyard, given grandiose plaster ceilings in the Stuart period, and then having Georgian façades added in the 18th century. The whole is a glorious mismatch of styles and fashions that seamlessly blend together. These could be called the true English country house. Wilton House, one of England&#x27;s grandest houses, is in a remarkably similar vein; although, while the Drydens, mere squires, at Canons Ashby employed a local architect, at Wilton the mighty Earls of Pembroke employed the finest architects of the day: first Holbein, 150 years later Inigo Jones, and then Wyatt followed by Chambers. Each employed a different style of architecture, seemingly unaware of the design of the wing around the next corner. These varying &quot;improvements&quot;, often criticised at the time, today are the qualities that make English country houses unique.

==Sizes and types==
There are no written terms for distinguishing between vast country palaces and comparatively small country houses; the descriptive terms, which can include &quot;castle&quot;, &quot;manor&quot; and &quot;court&quot;, provide no firm clue and are often only used because of a historical connection with the site of such a building. Therefore, for ease or explanation, Britain&#x27;s country houses can be categorised according to the circumstances of their creation.

=== Power houses ===
The great houses are the largest of the country houses; in truth palaces, built by the country&#x27;s most powerful – these were designed to display their owners&#x27; power or ambitions to power. Really large unfortified or barely fortified houses began to take over from the traditional castles of the crown and magnates during the Tudor period, with vast houses such as Hampton Court Palace and Burghley House, and continued until the 18th century with houses such as Castle Howard, Kedleston Hall and Holkham Hall. Such building reached its zenith from the late 17th century until the mid-18th century; these houses were often completely built or rebuilt in their entirety by one eminent architect in the most fashionable architectural style of the day and often have a suite of Baroque state apartments, typically in enfilade, reserved for the most eminent guests, the entertainment of whom was of paramount importance in establishing and maintaining the power of the owner. The common denominator of this category of English country houses is that they were designed to be lived in with a certain degree of ceremony and pomp. It was not unusual for the family to have a small suite of rooms for withdrawing in privacy away from the multitude that lived in the household. These houses were always an alternative residence to a London house.

During the 18th and 19th centuries, for the highest echelons of English society, the country house served as a place for relaxing, hunting and running the country with one&#x27;s equals at the end of the week, with some houses having their own theatre where performances were staged.

The country house, however, was not just an oasis of pleasure for a fortunate few; it was the centre of its own world, providing employment to hundreds of people in the vicinity of its estate. In previous eras, when state benefits were unheard of, those working on an estate were among the most fortunate, receiving secured employment and rent-free accommodation. At the summit of this category of people was the indoor staff of the country house. Unlike many of their contemporaries prior to the 20th century, they slept in proper beds, wore well-made adequate clothes and received three proper meals a day, plus a small wage. In an era when many still died from malnutrition or lack of medicine, the long working hours were a small price to pay.

As a result of the aristocratic habit of only marrying within the aristocracy, and whenever possible to a sole heiress, many owners of country houses owned several country mansions, and would visit each according to the season: Grouse shooting in Scotland, pheasant shooting and fox hunting in England. The Earl of Rosebery, for instance, had Dalmeny House in Scotland, Mentmore Towers in Buckinghamshire, and another house near Epsom just for the racing season. For many, this way of life, which began a steady decline in 1914, continued well into the 20th century, and for a few continues to this day.

=== Minor country houses ===
In the second category of Britain&#x27;s country houses are those that belonged to the squirearchy or landed gentry. These tend either to have evolved from medieval hall houses, with rooms added as required, or were purpose-built by relatively unknown local architects. Smaller, and far greater in number than the &quot;power houses&quot;, these were still the epicentre of their own estate, but were often the only residence of their owner.

However, whether the owner of a &quot;power house&quot; or a small manor, the inhabitants of the English country house have become collectively referred to as the ruling class, because this is exactly what they did in varying degrees, whether by having high political influence and power in national government, or in the day-to-day running of their own localities or &quot;county&quot; in such offices as lord/deputy lieutenant, magistrates, or occasionally even clergy.

The Country house mystery was a popular genre of English detective fiction in the 1920s and 1930s; set in the residence of the gentry and often involving a murder in a country house temporarily isolated by a snowstorm or similar with the suspects all at a weekend house party.

=== Victorian houses ===

Following the Industrial Revolution of the 18th century, a third category of country houses was built as newly rich industrialists and bankers were eager to display their wealth and taste. By the 1850s, with the English economy booming, new mansions were built in one of the many revivalist architectural styles popular throughout the 19th century. The builders of these new houses were able to take advantage of the political unrest in Europe that gave rise to a large trade in architectural salvage. This new wave of country house building is exemplified by the Rothschild properties in the home counties and Bletchley Park (rebuilt in several styles, and famous for its code-breaking role in World War II).

== Decline ==

The slow decline of the English country house coincided with the rise not just of taxation, but also of modern industry, along with the agricultural depression of the 1870s. By 1880, this had led some owners into financial shortfalls as they tried to balance maintenance of their estates with the income they provided. Some relied on funds from secondary sources such as banking and trade while others, like the severely impoverished Duke of Marlborough, sought to marry American heiresses to save their country houses and lifestyles.

The ultimate demise began immediately following World War I. The members of the huge staff required to maintain large houses had either left to fight and never returned, departed to work in the munitions factories, or filled the void left by the fighting men in other workplaces. Of those who returned after the war, many left the countryside for better-paid jobs in towns. The final blow for many country houses came following World War II; having been requisitioned during the war, they were returned to the owners in poor repair. Many estate owners, having lost their heirs, if not in the immediately preceding war then in World War I, were now paying far higher rates of tax, and agricultural incomes had dropped. Thus, the solution for many was to hold contents auctions and then demolish the house and sell its stone, fireplaces, and panelling. This is what happened to many of Britain&#x27;s finest houses.

Despite this slow decline, so necessary was the country house for entertaining and prestige that in 1917 Viscount Lee of Fareham donated his country house Chequers to the nation for the use of a prime minister who might not possess one of his or her own. Chequers still fulfills that need today as do both Chevening House and Dorneywood, donated for sole use of high-ranking ministers of the Crown.

== Today ==
Today, many country houses have become hotels, schools, hospitals and museums, while others have survived as conserved ruins, but from the early 20th century until the early 1970s, hundreds of country houses were demolished. Houses that survived destruction are now mostly Grade I or II listed as buildings of historic interest with restrictions on restoration and re-creation work. However such work is usually very expensive. Several houses have been restored, some over many years. For example at Copped Hall where the restoration started in 1995 continues to this day. 

Although the ownership or management of some houses has been transferred to a private trust, most notably at Chatsworth, other houses have transferred art works and furnishings under the Acceptance in Lieu scheme to ownership by various national or local museums, but retained for display in the building. This enables the former owners to offset tax, the payment of which would otherwise have necessitated the private sale of the art works. For example, tapestries and furniture at Houghton Hall are now owned by the Victoria and Albert Museum. In addition, increasing numbers of country houses hold licences for weddings and civil ceremonies. Another source of income is to use the house as a venue for parties, a film location or a corporate entertainment venue. While many country houses are open to the public and derive income through that means, they remain homes, in some cases inhabited by the descendants of their original owners.

The lifestyles of those living and working in a country house in the early 20th century were recreated in a BBC television programme, &quot;The Edwardian Country House&quot;, filmed at Manderston House in Scotland. Another television programme which features life in country houses is the ITV series&quot; Downton Abbey&quot;.

<text>Chipata is a city and administrative centre of the Eastern Province of Zambia and Chipata District. It was declared the 5th city of the country, after Lusaka, Ndola, Kitwe and Livingstone, by President Edgar Lungu on 24 February 2017. The city has undergone rapid economic and infrastructure growth in the years, leading up to city status.

==Location==
Chipata is located on the Great East Road, approximately east of Lusaka, the capital city of Zambia. This is about west of Lilongwe, the capital city of Malawi. The geographical coordinates of Chipata are 13°38′43.0″S, 32°38′47.0″E. The average elevation of Chipata is , above sea level.

==Overview==
Having a modern market, a central hospital, shopping malls, a university, some colleges and a number of schools, Chipata is the business and administrative hub of the region. The town boasts a four star hotel, a golf course, an airport, and a &quot;welcome arch&quot;. Developed areas includes Kalongwezi, Moth, and Little Bombay.

Chipata is the regional head of the Ngoni of Zambia. The Ngoni adopted the languages of the tribes they conquered, so Chewa and Nsenga are the principal languages, although Tumbuka and English are widely spoken, plus some Indian languages, as a large number of Zambian Indians live in the town. It is located near the border with Malawi, and lies on the Great East Road which connects the capitals Lilongwe to the east, and Lusaka to the west. It is a popular access point for the South Luangwa National Park, which is to the north-west.

== History ==
Chipata&#x27;s name comes from the Chewa word &quot;Chimpata&quot; meaning &quot;large space&quot;, in reference to the town&#x27;s situation in a shallow valley between hills. The name of the central neighbourhood of Kapata, the original centre of town, comes from the Chewa word meaning &quot;small space.&quot;

Chipata was formerly known as Fort Jameson (and informally as &quot;Fort Jimmy&quot;), being named after Sir Leander Starr Jameson, the 19th-century British politician and adventurer. Even during the colonial period, few supported that Jameson, who is mainly known for his part in the infamous Jameson Raid, fully deserved the honour of having any town named after him. Like &#x27;Fort Manning&#x27; and &#x27;Fort Rosebery&#x27;, Fort Jameson was called a &quot;fort&quot; because the local government offices, or &quot;Boma&quot;, were once fortified.

Fort Jameson was the capital of the British protectorate of North-Eastern Rhodesia between 1900 and 1911.

During World War II, 80 Polish refugees escaping from German- and Soviet-occupied Poland, were admitted in Fort Jameson in 1941.

== Government ==
The mayor of the city of Chipata is the head of the city government.

==Population==
With a population of about 327,059 in 2022, the Chipata District is believed to be the 8th largest city of the country. The city of Chipata had 193,288 inhabitants in 2022. The predominant ethnic groups in the city are the Chewa, Tumbuka, Ngoni and Nsenga.

== Economy ==

Chipata is the primary transport hub for trade between Zambia and Malawi. &quot;Down Shops&quot; is Chipata&#x27;s bustling down-town area, most shops and other businesses having proprietors of Indian origin. Two notable shops are Kavulamungu Bargain Centre, and Ally &amp; Sons.

== Tourism ==

The Nc&#x27;wala ceremony of the Ngoni people takes place at Mutenguleni on the outskirts of Chipata. The ceremony celebrates the first fruits harvest and is usually held at the end of February.

== Transport ==
=== Rail ===
An extension of the Sena railway, connecting the city of Chipata to the territory of Malawi (via Mchinji) was opened in August 2011. Since then, Chipata acts as the Zambian railhead and entry point from Malawi and beyond. In the pipeline since 1982, the short link, about , provides a through-route for rail traffic from Zambia via Malawi to the Indian Ocean deep-water port at Nacala in Mozambique. The route and alignment of the line has been laid out, including the site of Chipata station and the basic station building.

The route provides an alternative to two existing rail routes to the Indian Ocean, at Dar es Salaam and Beira. In 2015 it was proposed to build a rail link from Chipata through Petauke to Serenje, a town on the TAZARA Railway line.

=== Road ===
The T4 road (Great East Road) connects Chipata with Lusaka to the west (570 kilometres away) and the Mwami border with Malawi to the east (20 kilometres away).

The M12 road connects Chipata with Lundazi to the north (180 kilometres away). The D104 road connects Chipata with its airport (12 kilometers away) as well as to Mfuwe and the South Luangwa National Park to the north-west (100 kilometres away). The D128 road connects Chipata with Chadiza to the south-west (65 kilometres away). The D804 road connects Chipata with Vubwi to the south-east (60 kilometres away).

== Rivers ==
Chipata has four major streams pouring into the Luangwa river. The Luangwa river rises in the Lilonda and Mafinga Hills in north-east Zambia at an elevation of around 1500 meters near the border with Tanzania and Malawi, and flows in a southwesterly direction through a broad valley. The water from the streams and the Luangwa river is used for farming by the inhabitants around the district.

== Soil and vegetation ==
There are three main soil types: acrisols, fersiallitic soils, and lithosols. There are four vegetation types, the main one being the brachystegia (miombo) woodland and munga vegetation types.

== Climate ==
Chipata features a tropical savanna climate (Köppen: &quot;Aw&quot;) with wet and dry seasons. Summers are characterized by warm to hot temperatures, reaching peak values in October and November. Winters are milder, with July being the coolest month. The wet season, from November to March, experiences high humidity and significant rainfall. The dry season, from May to October, is marked by minimal precipitation.

<text>The District of Columbia Court of Appeals is the highest court of the District of Columbia, the capital city of the United States. The court was established in 1942 as the Municipal Court of Appeals, and it has been the court of last resort for matters of D.C. local law since 1970. It and the Superior Court of the District of Columbia comprise the District of Columbia&#x27;s court system. It is located in the former District of Columbia City Hall building at Judiciary Square.

The D.C. Court of Appeals is the equivalent of a state supreme court. Because the District of Columbia is not a U.S. state, however, the court&#x27;s authority derives from the U.S. Congress rather than from the inherent sovereignty of the states. The D.C. Court of Appeals is sometimes confused with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which is the federal U.S. court of appeals that covers the District of Columbia.

==History==
For much of the history of the District of Columbia, appeals in local matters were adjudicated by federal courts: first the Circuit Court of the District of Columbia (1801–1863), then the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia (1863–1893) (later renamed the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia), and finally the District of Columbia Court of Appeals (1893–1970) (later renamed the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit). The first local appellate court was established in 1942 when Congress created the Municipal Court of Appeals to hear appeals from the D.C. Municipal Court and the Juvenile Court. Consisting of a Chief Judge and two Associate Judges, the Municipal Court of Appeals acted as an intermediate appellate court, its decisions reviewable on a discretionary basis by the D.C. Circuit. In 1962, Congress renamed the court the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, and in 1967 its membership was enlarged to six judges.

Federal and local jurisdiction in the D.C. remained entangled until 1970, when Congress enacted the District of Columbia Court Reform and Criminal Procedure Act (84 Stat. 473). In addition to establishing the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, the Act established the District of Columbia Court of Appeals as the &quot;highest court for the District of Columbia,&quot; expanded its size to its present composition of nine judges, and broadened its jurisdiction to hear all appeals from the Superior Court and review decisions of the city&#x27;s mayor and administrative agencies.

==Powers==
As the court of last resort for the District of Columbia, the Court of Appeals is authorized to review all final orders, judgments, and specified interlocutory orders of the associate judges of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, as well as decisions of certain D.C. agencies. The court also has jurisdiction to review decisions of administrative agencies, boards, and commissions of the District government, as well as to answer questions of law presented by the Supreme Court of the United States, a United States court of appeals, or the highest appellate court of any state. As authorized by Congress, the court reviews proposed rules of the trial court and develops its own rules for proceedings.

Cases before the court are determined by randomly selected three-judge divisions, unless a hearing or rehearing before the court sitting &quot;en banc&quot; (with all judges present) is ordered. A hearing or rehearing before the court sitting &quot;en banc&quot; may be ordered by a majority of the judges in regular active service, generally only when consideration by the full court is necessary to maintain uniformity of its decisions, or when the case involves a question of exceptional importance. The &quot;en banc&quot; court consists of the nine judges of the court in regular active service, except that a retired judge may sit to rehear a case or controversy if the judge heard the original hearing. The Chief Judge may designate and assign temporarily one or more judges of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia to serve on the District of Columbia Court of Appeals when required.

Members of the court are empowered to adjudicate the oath of office ceremony for the executive cabinet of the president.

In the exercise of its inherent power over members of the legal profession, the court established the District of Columbia Bar and has the power to approve the rules governing attorney disciplinary proceedings. The court also reviews the rules of professional conduct and has established rules governing the admission of members of the District of Columbia Bar and the resolution of complaints concerning the unauthorized practice of law in the District of Columbia.

==Judges==
The court consists of a chief judge and eight associate judges. The court is assisted by the service of retired judges who have been recommended and approved as senior judges. Despite being the District&#x27;s local appellate court, judges are appointed by the president of the United States and confirmed by the U.S. Senate for 15-year terms. In 2011, the district&#x27;s judicial conduct entity, the Commission on Judicial Disabilities and Tenure, gained the ability to reappoint judges that it deems &quot;well qualified&quot; for subsequent 15-year terms without input from the president or senate. If the commission deems the judge &quot;qualified,&quot; the president has the option of renominating them, but if the commission deems the judge &quot;unqualified,&quot; they are ineligible for reappointment. In 2021, the commission reappointed Chief Judge Anna Blackburne-Rigsby to a new 15-year term.

===Active judges===







&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Vacancies and pending nominations ==

==Former judges==












== Chief judges ==
The first three chief judges of the Municipal Court of Appeals were nominated and confirmed specifically as chief judges. However, in 1961, the Department of Justice determined that the relevant law was ambiguous enough that President Kennedy could elevate sitting judge Andrew M. Hood as chief judge without submitting a nomination to the Senate for that purpose, as President Truman had done when elevating Nathan Cayton as chief judge in 1946. The Library of Congress issued a legal opinion calling the Department of Justice&#x27;s determination into question, but Hood remained as chief judge. Since 1973, the chief judge has been selected by the District of Columbia Judicial Nomination Commission for renewable four-year terms.

<text>Vergnügungszug (Pleasure Train), op. 281 is a polka composed by Johann Strauss II in 1864. It was written for the Association of Industrial Societies&#x27; Ball held in the Redoutensaal on 19 January 1864 and was inspired by the opening of the Austrian Southern Railway – the Südbahn – which operated many &#x27;pleasure trains&#x27; offering trips from Vienna to the countryside.

Strauss was not the first composer to write a piece celebrating technological innovation. Much earlier Hans Christian Lumbye, the popular Danish composer, had written his &quot;Kjøbenhjavns Jernbane-Damp-Galop&quot; (Copenhagen Railway Steam Galop), while Johann Strauss I celebrated the opening of the first Austrian steam railway on 14 November 1837 between the Viennese suburbs of Floridsdorf and Deutsch Wagram with his appropriately titled waltz &quot;Eisenbahn-Lust Walzer&quot; (Railway Joy Waltz) op. 89. Eduard Strauss, too, wrote his famous quick polka &quot;Bahn Frei&quot; (Track Clear) op. 45, another piece celebrating the opening of a new railway line.

Johann Strauss II&#x27;s vividly descriptive polka, however, is remarkable for its use of triangles in imitation of train bells and of horns to suggest the chuffing of the train. In the trio section the melody constantly hints of the train&#x27;s progression. The polka, like the train&#x27;s journey, has to end, however, and Strauss powers home the conclusion with high chords before a resounding flourish underlined by a powerful roll on snaredrum.

Although many of Strauss&#x27;s works commemorate travel and other forms of transport, neither he nor his brother eagerly undertook extensive journeys. One anecdote states that Johann himself was terrified at the mere mention of the overhanging precipices at the Semmering Pass and later during a railway trip he made to Boston in the 1870s as part of a concert tour of the United States, his wife Henrietta Treffz noted that Strauss confessed he would rather die than be forced take another trip on the American railroad. Many (unsubstantiated) stories suggest that Strauss was so terrified of rail travel that he spent train journeys huddled on the carriage floor.

<doc id="1312972" wikidata="Q2732183" url="?curid=1312972" title="Circus Charlie">
<text>is an action game originally published in arcades by Konami in 1984. The player controls a circus clown named Charlie in six different circus-themed minigames. It was released for MSX in the same year, followed by ports to the Famicom in 1986 by Soft Pro and the Commodore 64 in 1987.

==Gameplay==

In the game there are six regular stages (plus an extra stage) of differing tasks that are to be completed by Charlie. Grabbing money bags, performing dangerous s, avoiding enemies, completing stages, etc., earns Charlie points. After the sixth stage is completed, the game starts over again but with a faster pace and more difficult (but exactly the same in terms of task to be completed) levels.

Charlie also races against time. Bonus points are awarded according to the time remaining, but running out of time will cost the player a life.

===Levels===
The standard Arcade version has 6 levels in total. Levels 1, 2, 4 and 5 have 5 sublevels. Level 3 contains 7 sublevels. Each sublevel gets more difficult. Level 6 also has 5 sublevels, but repeats as long the user has lives.

* Level 1: Ride on a lion and jump through flaming rings.
* Level 2: Tightrope walking whilst jumping over monkeys.
* Level 3: Jump between trampolines and beware the knife throwers and fire breathers. In sublevel 3 and 6 the trampolines are placed in a swimming pool and the knife throwers and fire breathers are replaced by jumping dolphins. This level is not present in the MSX and Famicom/NES ports of the game.
* Level 4: Jump from ball to ball.
* Level 5: Ride a horse and jump over trampolines and walls.
* Level 6: Swing from one trapeze to the next.

===Versions===

In arcades, there&#x27;s a &quot;Level Select&quot; version of the game, in which the player can choose any of the stages to play, but only a limited number of times each, whereupon the level will become unselectable. There is no &quot;ending&quot; to the game—after the first five levels have each been played to their limit, the player then repeats the trapeze stage until all their lives are exhausted.

The Famicom version just like MSX port drops the trampoline stage, but offers a &quot;B&quot; mode, in which all the levels are repeated with added difficulty. The game often shows up on Famicom clone systems and multicarts, usually with its title screen altered to remove copyright, some versions also have the levels split up to make up separate games in multicarts.

The music comes from &quot;American Patrol&quot; and &quot;The Blue Danube&quot;.

== Reception ==
In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Circus Charlie&quot; on their May 15, 1984 issue as being the third most-successful table arcade unit of the month.

==Legacy==
In &quot;Mikie&quot;, another Konami arcade game, headbutting the teacher&#x27;s desk from below three times in the classroom stage will make Circus Charlie appear, giving the player extra points.

&quot;Circus Charlie&quot; was released along with other Konami classic games on the Nintendo DS compilation &quot;Konami Classics Series: Arcade Hits&quot;.

=== Other media ===
* &quot;Circus Charlie&quot; is one of the video games that were adapted into a manga titled &quot;Susume!! Seigaku Dennou Kenkyuubu&quot;, published in the &quot;Gamest&quot; comics collection from April 1999, drawn by Kouta Hirano.
* Charlie has a cameo appearance in the panel Seinen manga &quot;Konami 4Koma Manga Wai Wai World&quot; which is part of the &quot;Famicom Runners High&quot;.

<text>Michael Louden (April 21, 1964 – September 4, 2004) was an American actor.

==Career==
Louden was born in Marblehead, Massachusetts and went on to become an actor. He studied theater at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill but graduated from Juilliard. He started as a 1988-day player on daytime soap &quot;Another World&quot; but his most notable role was Duke Kramer on &quot;As the World Turns&quot;. Duke was a moody young man who discovered his father was the volatile John Dixon (allowing Louden many scenes with theater powerhouse Larry Bryggman). Duke went on to medical school as well as a lengthy relationship with Lien Hughes, played by future &quot;ER&quot; star Ming-Na Wen. Louden played the role from 1988 to 1990 and for a brief visit in 1993.

Louden had a small part on &quot;One Life to Live&quot; in 1995 as a court reporter. Among the handful of his other film and TV appearances was a role in the 2000 film &quot;Space Cowboys&quot;. In 2003 he briefly hosted the video game show &quot;Arena&quot; on the G4 network. 
In &quot;Hellbent&quot; in 2004, he was a cop-loving drag queen.
While working at G4, Michael became very involved with the Black Rabbit Society.

He continued to work in theater and independent film until his sudden death from a brain aneurysm.

<doc id="1313001" wikidata="Q708789" url="?curid=1313001" title="Muji">
<text>, or is a Japanese retailer which sells a wide variety of household and consumer goods. Muji&#x27;s design philosophy is minimalist, and it places an emphasis on recycling, reducing production and packaging waste, and a no-logo or &quot;no-brand&quot; policy. The name Muji is derived from the first part of &quot;Mujirushi Ryōhin&quot;, translated as &quot;No-Brand Quality Goods&quot; on Muji&#x27;s European website.

==Products and businesses==
Muji started with only 40 products in the 1980s. Some of their products include pens, pencils, notebooks, storage units, apparel, kitchen appliances, food items, and household care products. Muji has also created an automobile. Muji storefronts such as the one in New York are large and stocked with nearly every single product available. The primary business also includes Café Muji, Meal Muji, Muji Campsite, florist and home furnishing; the company has also engaged in architectural projects such as Muji House.

By the end of the 2000s, Muji was selling more than 7,000 different products. It is positioned as a &quot;reasonably priced&quot; brand, keeping the retail prices of products &quot;lower than usual&quot; by the materials it selects, streamlining its manufacturing processes, and minimising packaging.
In April 2019, Muji opened its largest Muji store in Ginza, Japan. The company added Atelier Muji Ginza located on the sixth floor. 

Muji has opened hotels in Shenzhen, Beijing, and Ginza, Tokyo.

==History==

Mujirushi (no-brand) Ryōhin (quality goods) began as a product brand of the supermarket chain The Seiyu, Ltd. in December 1980. The Mujirushi Ryōhin product range was developed to offer affordable quality products and were marketed using the slogan &quot;Lower priced for a reason.&quot; Products were wrapped in clear cellophane, plain brown paper labels and red writing. Mujirushi Ryōhin&#x27;s drive to cut retail prices for consumers saw the company cutting waste by, for example, selling U-shaped spaghetti, the left-over part that is cut off to sell straight spaghetti.

In 1981, Seiji Tsutsumi, the president of the Seiyu Ryutsu group proposed opening a dedicated shop for Mujirushi Ryōhin products. Although the idea was rejected by the directors of Seiyu, the advisory board of the company supported the idea, proposing the idea of a shop positioned against mass production. The company began to develop products that would allow the shop to expand from a supermarket product range to an independent product company. Such products included food, clothing, stationery, and household goods.

In 1983, the first directly operated Mujirushi Ryōhin store opened in Aoyama, Tokyo. In 1985, Mujirushi Ryōhin started overseas production and procurement, started to place direct factory orders in 1986, and in 1987 Muji started to develop materials globally. And it was a real success. 

In 1989, Ryohin Keikaku Ltd became the manufacturer and retailer for all Mujirushi Ryōhin products and operations, including planning, development, production, distribution and sale.

In 1991, Mujirushi Ryōhin opened its first international store in London.

In 1995, shares in &quot;Muji Tsunan Campsite&quot; were registered as over-the-counter shares of Japan Securities Dealers Association. In 1998, Ryōhin Keikaku listed on the second section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. From 2001 onwards, it was listed on the first section. In April 2001 they issued the Muji Car 1000 (ムジ・カー 1000), a limited release of 1,000 badgeless and decontented Nissan Marches, only available online. Intended as an exercise to test their online marketing systems it was developed together with Nissan. The spartanly equipped little car (with the rear seat upholstered in vinyl, for instance) was only offered in &quot;marble white&quot;.
The brand name &quot;Muji&quot; appears to have been used since around 1999.

In 2011, the first Muji store in Aoyama was redeveloped as a concept store with products from around the world.

In 2020 and 2021, Muji faced scrutiny over the use of cotton produced under conditions of forced labor in Xinjiang. Muji subsequently stopped labelling goods as &quot;Xinjiang cotton&quot; in certain markets, such as Hong Kong. In December 2021, it was reported that the same Muji garments labelled simply as &quot;organic cotton&quot; in the Hong Kong, Taiwanese, and Japanese markets were still being sold by Muji under the &quot;Xinjiang cotton&quot; banner in China.

==Countries of operation==


In Japan, Ryohin Keikaku had 328 directly operated stores, and supplied 124 outlets, .
Ryohin Keikaku has three factory outlets at Osaka, Gotenba and Fukuoka.

There were 579 International retail outlets , located in Denmark (1) UK (7), Finland (1), France (7), Italy (6), Germany (7), Ireland (1), Spain (4), Poland (1), Portugal (1), United States (10), Canada (9), Hong Kong (19), Macau (1), Singapore (15), Malaysia (9), South Korea (40), Mainland China (325), Taiwan (58), Thailand (27), Australia (5), Philippines (5), Bahrain (2), Kuwait (3), Qatar (2), Saudi Arabia (5), UAE (7), Oman (1), India (3), Vietnam (3).

Muji had operations in Indonesia, Turkey, Sweden and Switzerland in the past but has closed operations due to its low sales and other circumstances.

=== American operations ===
Muji entered the US market in 2002; its products were stocked at MOMA, New York.

Muji opened its first American store on November 16, 2007, in SoHo, Manhattan. In 2008, it opened two more stores in Manhattan: one in Times Square, and one in Chelsea.

On November 30, 2012, it opened its first store on the West Coast in South of Market, San Francisco. The San Francisco store, the Hollywood store, and the Santa Monica store are now permanently closed.

In New York City, Muji supplies products to a design store at the Museum of Modern Art and maintains a flagship store. , there were 7 stores in Manhattan, one in Boston, one in Portland, and another location in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. A small branch previously operated at JFK International Airport.

In July 2020, Muji USA filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, citing shutdowns from the COVID-19 pandemic.

==No-brand branding==
Muji&#x27;s &quot;no-brand&quot; strategy (generic brand) means that little money is spent on advertisement or classical marketing, and Muji&#x27;s success is attributed to word of mouth, a simple shopping experience, and the anti-brand movement. Muji&#x27;s no-brand strategy also means its products are attractive to customers who prefer unbranded products for aesthetic reasons, and because it provides an alternative to traditional branded products.

In terms of Muji&#x27;s advertising of their products, Kenya Hara states that because customers perceived Muji in different ways, advertising would have to be used to present information rather than to communicate a message. These customer perceptions included liking Muji&#x27;s ecological approach, appreciation for their urban aesthetics, a perception of low cost, and a perception of sophisticated design.

Muji has released a T-shirt with a rubber square on the chest for customers to design their own logo or message. Muji now sells paper products (such as notebooks) which can be personalized by customers using rubber stamps in-store at no charge. They also sell soft goods (such as T-shirts and hats) which can be computer embroidered to customer specifications, and picked up a few hours or days later.

==Design==
Muji is known for its distinctive design, which is extended throughout its more than 7,000 products. Commentators have described Muji&#x27;s design style as having mundanity, being &quot;no-frills&quot;, being &quot;minimalist&quot;, and &quot;Bauhaus-style&quot;.

Muji product design, and brand identity, is based around the selection of materials, streamlined manufacturing processes, and minimal packaging. Muji products have a limited colour range and are displayed on shelves with minimal packaging, displaying only functional product information and a price tag. Detailed instructions included with the product are usually printed only in Japanese, although multilingual translations are starting to be included with some products.

===Design approach and production===
On its corporate website, Ryohin Keikaku Ltd rationalises its principles in terms of producing high quality products at &quot;lower than usual&quot; retail prices, true to the original Muji marketing slogan &quot;lower priced for a reason&quot;. On its catalogue website Muji states that &quot;at the heart of Muji design is the Japanese concept of &quot;Kanketsu&quot;, the concept of simplicity&quot;, aiming to &quot;bring a quiet sense of calm into strenuous everyday lives&quot;. In an interview, Hiroyoshi Azami, President of Muji USA, described Muji&#x27;s design culture as centred around designing &quot;simple&quot; products that are basic and necessary.
In its design, Muji also follows environmental guidelines, seeking to &quot;restrict the use of substances that may have a significant impact on people or the environment&quot; and &quot;reduce waste by standardising modules, facilitating disassembly, and by reducing packaging&quot;.

The Muji design process resists technology for its own sake, and prototype designs are produced on paper rather than computers, so as not to encourage unnecessary detail. The manufacturing process is determined by the consumer&#x27;s use of the product, which is a design priority. Finishes, lines, and forms are minimised for manufacturing ease.

In recent years, Muji has looked towards appreciating local culture and craftsmanship. The Found Muji line of products is a movement where Muji&#x27;s designers find products and designs that follow the company&#x27;s design approach, focusing on crafts and items that are used globally.

===Designers===
Muji products are not attributed to individual designers. While Muji has stated that some of its products have been the works of famous international designers, it does not disclose who they are. There are, however, some designers who made their involvement public. The most notable are Naoto Fukasawa, Jasper Morrison, James Irvine, Sam Hecht, and Konstantin Grčić.

Muji participates in design collaborations with other companies. In 2001, Muji and Nissan Motors produced the Muji Car 1000. This fuel efficient, low-emission, and low-cost limited edition vehicle aimed to incorporate recycled materials wherever possible. Following Muji&#x27;s no-brand strategy, the car had no branding logos.

===Manufacturers===
Generally, Muji keeps its manufacturing sources private.

One notable exception is the brand&#x27;s collaboration with Thonet, the oldest German furniture maker. In 2008, Muji and Thonet announced their cooperation to produce two lines of minimalist furniture. The first was bentwood chairs designed by James Irvine in homage to the iconic No. 14 chair of Thonet. The second was steel tubular chairs and desks designed by Konstantin Grčić. Roland Ohnacker, managing director of Thonet, stated that the aim was &quot;to help 18 to 35 year-olds enter the Thonet brand world&quot;. From Spring 2009, these furniture are available at selected Muji stores.

===Directors===
The first art director of Muji was Ikko Tanaka. Tanaka is credited with developing the Muji concept together with Kazuko Koike (marketing consultant), and Takashi Sugimoto (interior designer). Tanaka articulated the Muji vision and appearance, and he provided ideas and prototypes that visualized the design strategy. Tanaka&#x27;s design strategy included brown paper and clear cellophane packaging. In 2001, Kenya Hara, an internationally recognized graphic designer and curator, took over as art director. He stated that:
I found that the company was at a standstill with the original idea, &#x27;No design&#x27;, which was advocated at its inception. They also had more than 250 outlets and sold more than 5,000 items, including products that deviated from the initial Muji concept or were low cost, but of substandard quality.
Kenya Hara has been credited as key figure in further developing Muji. Hara has a background in graphic design, hence had experience in designing packaging and corporate identities. Beyond that, he is credited with significantly moulding the Muji brand and design identity. In an interview in 2005, Hara stated that &quot;Everything in the world has become an object of interest for me. Everything is designed.&quot; Hara has published books on design philosophy, most recently &quot;Designing Design&quot;.

Sam Hecht, Creative Director of Muji Europe, is quoted as saying &quot;The human is not the centre of everything, but on the same level of everything&quot;.

===Design awards and competition===
In 2005, Muji was awarded five gold product design awards by the International Forum Design in Germany.

In 2006, Muji held its first international design competition, &quot;Muji Award 01&quot;. In 2007, Chen Jiaojiao published a book on Muji design and brand entitled &quot;Brands A-Z: Muji&quot;.

==Following==
The Berlin correspondent for &quot;The New York Times&quot; reports that the Japanese call Muji-fans &quot;Mujirers&quot;. Muji&#x27;s international stores and The Muji Catalogue mainly retail Muji home consumer goods, furniture and clothing, while Muji Japan sells in a wide range of sectors, including food, bicycles, camp sites, phones, yoga, florists, cafes, and concept houses.

<text>Lotka&#x27;s law, named after Alfred J. Lotka, is one of a variety of special applications of Zipf&#x27;s law. It describes the frequency of publication by authors in any given field. 

== Definition ==
Let formula_1 be the number of publications, formula_2 be the number of authors with formula_1 publications, and formula_4 be a constants depending on the specific field. Lotka&#x27;s law states that formula_5.

In Lotka&#x27;s original publication, he claimed formula_6. Subsequent research showed that formula_4 varies depending on the discipline.

Equivalently, Lotka&#x27;s law can be stated as formula_8, where formula_9 is the number of authors with &quot;at least&quot; formula_1 publications. Their equivalence can be proved by taking the derivative.
== Example ==
Assume that n=2 in a discipline, then as the number of articles published increases, authors producing that many publications become less frequent. There are 1/4 as many authors publishing two articles within a specified time period as there are single-publication authors, 1/9 as many publishing three articles, 1/16 as many publishing four articles, etc. 

And if 100 authors wrote &quot;exactly&quot; one article each over a specific period in the discipline, then: 
That would be a total of 294 articles and 155 writers, with an average of 1.9 articles for each writer.

<doc id="1313007" wikidata="Q1143031" url="?curid=1313007" title="Semiconductor memory">
<text>Semiconductor memory is a digital electronic semiconductor device used for digital data storage, such as computer memory. It typically refers to devices in which data is stored within metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) memory cells on a silicon integrated circuit memory chip. There are numerous different types using different semiconductor technologies. The two main types of random-access memory (RAM) are static RAM (SRAM), which uses several transistors per memory cell, and dynamic RAM (DRAM), which uses a transistor and a MOS capacitor per cell. Non-volatile memory (such as EPROM, EEPROM and flash memory) uses floating-gate memory cells, which consist of a single floating-gate transistor per cell.

Most types of semiconductor memory have the property of random access, which means that it takes the same amount of time to access any memory location, so data can be efficiently accessed in any random order. This contrasts with data storage media such as CDs which read and write data consecutively and therefore the data can only be accessed in the same sequence it was written. Semiconductor memory also has much faster access times than other types of data storage; a byte of data can be written to or read from semiconductor memory within a few nanoseconds, while access time for rotating storage such as hard disks is in the range of milliseconds. For these reasons it is used for primary storage, to hold the program and data the computer is currently working on, among other uses.

, sales of semiconductor memory chips are annually, accounting for % of the semiconductor industry. Shift registers, processor registers, data buffers and other small digital registers that have no memory address decoding mechanism are typically not referred to as &quot;memory&quot; although they also store digital data.

==Description==
In a semiconductor memory chip, each bit of binary data is stored in a tiny circuit called a &quot;memory cell&quot; consisting of one to several transistors. The memory cells are laid out in rectangular arrays on the surface of the chip. The 1-bit memory cells are grouped in small units called &quot;words&quot; which are accessed together as a single memory address. Memory is manufactured in word length that is usually a power of two, typically &quot;N&quot;=1, 2, 4 or 8 bits.

Data is accessed by means of a binary number called a memory address applied to the chip&#x27;s address pins, which specifies which word in the chip is to be accessed. If the memory address consists of &quot;M&quot; bits, the number of addresses on the chip is 2&quot;M&quot;, each containing an &quot;N&quot; bit word. Consequently, the amount of data stored in each chip is &quot;N&quot;2&quot;M&quot; bits. The memory storage capacity for &quot;M&quot; number of address lines is given by 2&quot;M&quot;, which is usually in power of two: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256 and 512 and measured in kilobits, megabits, gigabits or terabits, etc. the largest semiconductor memory chips hold a few gigabits of data, but higher capacity memory is constantly being developed. By combining several integrated circuits, memory can be arranged into a larger word length and/or address space than what is offered by each chip, often but not necessarily a power of two.

The two basic operations performed by a memory chip are &quot;&quot;read&quot;, in which the data contents of a memory word is read out (nondestructively), and &quot;write&quot;&quot; in which data is stored in a memory word, replacing any data that was previously stored there. To increase data rate, in some of the latest types of memory chips such as DDR SDRAM multiple words are accessed with each read or write operation.

In addition to standalone memory chips, blocks of semiconductor memory are integral parts of many computer and data processing integrated circuits. For example, the microprocessor chips that run computers contain cache memory to store instructions awaiting execution.

==Types==
===Volatile memory===
Volatile memory loses its stored data when the power to the memory chip is turned off. However it can be faster and less expensive than non-volatile memory. This type is used for the main memory in most computers, since data is stored on the hard disk while the computer is off. Major types are:

RAM (&quot;Random-access memory&quot;) This has become a generic term for any semiconductor memory that can be written to, as well as read from, in contrast to ROM &quot;(below)&quot;, which can only be read. All semiconductor memory, not just RAM, has the property of random access.
* DRAM (&quot;Dynamic random-access memory&quot;) This uses memory cells consisting of one MOSFET (MOS field-effect transistor) and one MOS capacitor to store each bit. This type of RAM is the cheapest and highest in density, so it is used for the main memory in computers. However, the electric charge that stores the data in the memory cells slowly leaks out, so the memory cells must be periodically refreshed (rewritten) which requires additional circuitry. The refresh process is handled internally by the computer and is transparent to its user.
** FPM DRAM (&quot;Fast page mode DRAM&quot;) An older type of asynchronous DRAM that improved on previous types by allowing repeated accesses to a single &quot;page&quot; of memory to occur at a faster rate. Used in the mid-1990s.
** EDO DRAM (&quot;Extended data out DRAM&quot;) An older type of asynchronous DRAM which had faster access time than earlier types by being able to initiate a new memory access while data from the previous access was still being transferred. Used in the later part of the 1990s.
** VRAM (&quot;Video random access memory&quot;) An older type of dual-ported memory once used for the frame buffers of video adapters (video cards).
** SDRAM (&quot;Synchronous dynamic random-access memory&quot;) This added circuitry to the DRAM chip which synchronizes all operations with a clock signal added to the computer&#x27;s memory bus. This allowed the chip to process multiple memory requests simultaneously using &quot;pipelining&quot;, to increase the speed. The data on the chip is also divided into &quot;banks&quot; which can each work on a memory operation simultaneously. This became the dominant type of computer memory by about the year 2000.
*** DDR SDRAM (&quot;Double data rate SDRAM&quot;) This could transfer twice the data (two consecutive words) on each clock cycle by double pumping (transferring data on both the rising and falling edges of the clock pulse). Extensions of this idea are the current (2012) technique being used to increase memory access rate and throughput. Since it is proving difficult to further increase the internal clock speed of memory chips, these chips increase the transfer rate by transferring more data words on each clock cycle
**** DDR2 SDRAM Transfers 4 consecutive words per internal clock cycle
**** DDR3 SDRAM Transfers 8 consecutive words per internal clock cycle.
**** DDR4 SDRAM Transfers 16 consecutive words per internal clock cycle.
*** RDRAM (&quot;Rambus DRAM&quot;) An alternate double data rate memory standard that was used on some Intel systems but ultimately lost out to DDR SDRAM.
**** XDR DRAM (&quot;Extreme data rate DRAM&quot;)
*** SGRAM (&quot;Synchronous graphics RAM&quot;) A specialized type of SDRAM made for graphics adaptors (video cards). It can perform graphics-related operations such as bit masking and block write, and can open two pages of memory at once.
**** GDDR SDRAM (&quot;Graphics DDR SDRAM&quot;)
***** GDDR2
***** GDDR3 SDRAM
***** GDDR4 SDRAM
***** GDDR5 SDRAM
***** GDDR6 SDRAM
*** HBM (&quot;High Bandwidth Memory&quot;) A development of SDRAM used in graphics cards that can transfer data at a faster rate. It consists of multiple memory chips stacked on top of one another, with a wider data bus. 
** PSRAM (&quot;Pseudostatic RAM&quot;) This is DRAM which has circuitry to perform memory refresh on the chip, so that it acts like SRAM, allowing the external memory controller to be shut down to save energy. It is used in a few game consoles such as the Wii.
* SRAM (&quot;Static random-access memory&quot;) This stores each bit of data in a circuit called a flip-flop, made of 4 to 6 transistors. SRAM is less dense and more expensive per bit than DRAM, but faster and does not require memory refresh. It is used for smaller cache memories in computers. 
* CAM (&quot;Content-addressable memory&quot;) This is a specialized type in which, instead of accessing data using an address, a data word is applied and the memory returns the location if the word is stored in the memory. It is mostly incorporated in other chips such as microprocessors where it is used for cache memory.

===Non-volatile memory===
Non-volatile memory (NVM) preserves the data stored in it during periods when the power to the chip is turned off. Therefore, it is used for the memory in portable devices, which don&#x27;t have disks, and for removable memory cards among other uses. Major types are: 

* ROM (&quot;Read-only memory&quot;) This is designed to hold permanent data, and in normal operation is only read from, not written to. Although many types can be written to, the writing process is slow and usually all the data in the chip must be rewritten at once. It is usually used to store system software which must be immediately accessible to the computer, such as the BIOS program which starts the computer, and the software (microcode) for portable devices and embedded computers such as microcontrollers.
** MROM (&quot;Mask programmed ROM&quot; or &quot;Mask ROM&quot;) In this type the data is programmed into the chip when the chip is manufactured, so it is only used for large production runs. It cannot be rewritten with new data.
** PROM (&quot;Programmable read-only memory&quot;) In this type the data is written into an existing PROM chip before it is installed in the circuit, but it can only be written once. The data is written by plugging the chip into a device called a PROM programmer.
** EPROM (&quot;Erasable programmable read-only memory&quot; or UVEPROM) In this type the data in it can be rewritten by removing the chip from the circuit board, exposing it to an ultraviolet light to erase the existing data, and plugging it into a PROM programmer. The IC package has a small transparent &quot;window&quot; in the top to admit the UV light. It is often used for prototypes and small production run devices, where the program in it may have to be changed at the factory. 
** EEPROM (&quot;Electrically erasable programmable read-only memory&quot;) In this type the data can be rewritten electrically, while the chip is on the circuit board, but the writing process is slow. This type is used to hold firmware, the low level microcode which runs hardware devices, such as the BIOS program in most computers, so that it can be updated.
* NVRAM (&quot;Non-volatile random-access memory&quot;)
** FRAM (&quot;Ferroelectric RAM&quot;) One type of nonvolatile RAM.
* Flash memory In this type the writing process is intermediate in speed between EEPROMS and RAM memory; it can be written to, but not fast enough to serve as main memory. It is often used as a semiconductor version of a hard disk, to store files. It is used in portable devices such as PDAs, USB flash drives, and removable memory cards used in digital cameras and cellphones.

==History==
Early computer memory consisted of magnetic-core memory, as early solid-state electronic semiconductors, including transistors such as the bipolar junction transistor (BJT), were impractical for use as digital storage elements (memory cells). The earliest semiconductor memory dates back to the early 1960s, with bipolar memory, which used bipolar transistors. Bipolar semiconductor memory made from discrete devices was first shipped by Texas Instruments to the United States Air Force in 1961. The same year, the concept of solid-state memory on an integrated circuit (IC) chip was proposed by applications engineer Bob Norman at Fairchild Semiconductor. The first single-chip memory IC was the BJT 16-bit IBM SP95 fabricated in December 1965, engineered by Paul Castrucci. While bipolar memory offered improved performance over magnetic-core memory, it could not compete with the lower price of magnetic-core memory, which remained dominant up until the late 1960s. Bipolar memory failed to replace magnetic-core memory because bipolar flip-flop circuits were too large and expensive.

=== MOS memory ===
The advent of the metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET), invented by Mohamed M. Atalla and Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs in 1959, enabled the practical use of metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) transistors as memory cell storage elements, a function previously served by magnetic cores in computer memory. MOS memory was developed by John Schmidt at Fairchild Semiconductor in 1964. In addition to higher performance, MOS memory was cheaper and consumed less power than magnetic-core memory. This led to MOSFETs eventually replacing magnetic cores as the standard storage elements in computer memory.

In 1965, J. Wood and R. Ball of the Royal Radar Establishment proposed digital storage systems that use CMOS (complementary MOS) memory cells, in addition to MOSFET power devices for the power supply, switched cross-coupling, switches and delay-line storage. The development of silicon-gate MOS integrated circuit (MOS IC) technology by Federico Faggin at Fairchild in 1968 enabled the production of MOS memory chips. NMOS memory was commercialized by IBM in the early 1970s. MOS memory overtook magnetic core memory as the dominant memory technology in the early 1970s.

The term &quot;memory&quot; when used with reference to computers most often refers to volatile random-access memory (RAM). The two main types of volatile RAM are static random-access memory (SRAM) and dynamic random-access memory (DRAM). Bipolar SRAM was invented by Robert Norman at Fairchild Semiconductor in 1963, followed by the development of MOS SRAM by John Schmidt at Fairchild in 1964. SRAM became an alternative to magnetic-core memory, but required six MOS transistors for each bit of data. Commercial use of SRAM began in 1965, when IBM introduced their SP95 SRAM chip for the System/360 Model 95.

Toshiba introduced bipolar DRAM memory cells for its Toscal BC-1411 electronic calculator in 1965. While it offered improved performance over magnetic-core memory, bipolar DRAM could not compete with the lower price of the then dominant magnetic-core memory. MOS technology is the basis for modern DRAM. In 1966, Dr. Robert H. Dennard at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center was working on MOS memory. While examining the characteristics of MOS technology, he found it was capable of building capacitors, and that storing a charge or no charge on the MOS capacitor could represent the 1 and 0 of a bit, while the MOS transistor could control writing the charge to the capacitor. This led to his development of a single-transistor DRAM memory cell. In 1967, Dennard filed a patent under IBM for a single-transistor DRAM memory cell, based on MOS technology. This led to the first commercial DRAM IC chip, the Intel 1103, in October 1970. Synchronous dynamic random-access memory (SDRAM) later debuted with the Samsung KM48SL2000 chip in 1992.

The term &quot;memory&quot; is also often used to refer to non-volatile memory, specifically flash memory. It has origins in read-only memory (ROM). Programmable read-only memory (PROM) was invented by Wen Tsing Chow in 1956, while working for the Arma Division of the American Bosch Arma Corporation. In 1967, Dawon Kahng and Simon Sze of Bell Labs proposed that the floating gate of a MOS semiconductor device could be used for the cell of a reprogrammable read-only memory (ROM), which led to Dov Frohman of Intel inventing EPROM (erasable PROM) in 1971. EEPROM (electrically erasable PROM) was developed by Yasuo Tarui, Yutaka Hayashi and Kiyoko Naga at Japan&#x27;s Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) Electrotechnical Laboratory in 1972. Flash memory was invented by Fujio Masuoka at Toshiba in the early 1980s. Masuoka and colleagues presented the invention of NOR flash in 1984, and then NAND flash in 1987. Toshiba commercialized NAND flash memory in 1987.

<text>The 1952 United States Senate elections was an election for the United States Senate which coincided with the election of Dwight D. Eisenhower to the presidency by a large margin. The 32 Senate seats of Class 1 were contested in regular elections, and three special elections were held to fill vacancies. The Republicans took control of the Senate by managing to make a net gain of two seats. However, Wayne Morse (R-OR) became an independent forcing Republicans to rely on Vice President Richard Nixon&#x27;s tie-breaking vote, although Republicans maintained a 48–47–1 plurality. Wayne Morse would caucus with the Republicans at the start of Congress’ second session on January 6, 1954 to allow the GOP to remain in control of the Senate. This was the third time, as well as second consecutive, in which a sitting Senate leader lost his seat. 

The 1952 United States Senate elections marked a significant shift in power, with the Republicans gaining control of the Senate by making a net gain of two seats.

This was the last time the Senate changed hands in a presidential election year until 1980 and the last time the Republicans won control of the Senate until 1980. As of 2024, this is the last time both houses simultaneously changed hands in a presidential year.

<doc id="1313014" wikidata="Q6901501" url="?curid=1313014" title="Monocular rivalry">
<text>Monocular rivalry is a phenomenon of human visual perception that occurs when two different images are optically superimposed. During prolonged viewing, one image becomes clearer than the other for a few moments, then the other image becomes clearer than the first for a few moments. These alternations in clarity continue at random for as long as one looks. Occasionally one image will become exclusively visible and the other image invisible.

In the demonstration, one image is a green grating and the other is a red grating. During prolonged inspection, the viewer can see the green grating as clearer than the red grating for a few moments, then the reverse. Occasionally the green grating will be all that is visible and occasionally the red grating will be all that is visible. Occasionally, at transitions, one will briefly see irregular composites of the two gratings (such as the red and green gratings superimposed but with one or two bars of the green grating invisible).

Monocular rivalry is easier to see when the component stimuli are of opposite colors, but it also occurs when the component stimuli have the same colors. As long as the two component stimuli differ spatiotemporally in some way, such as orientation (as shown), spatial frequency, or direction of movement, monocular rivalry can be seen.

== History of monocular rivalry ==
Monocular rivalry was discovered by Marius Tscherning in 1898. It was independently discovered, and named, by Breese (1899). He called it monocular rivalry to distinguish it from binocular rivalry, a similar phenomenon in which the different images are presented to opposite eyes. Monocular rivalry was rediscovered by Campbell and Howell (1972). They called the phenomenon &quot;monocular pattern alternation&quot;, but Campbell called it monocular rivalry in later papers, and that is the term that has stuck, even though the phenomenon does not require monocular viewing. Maier, Logothetis, and Leopold (2005)advocated calling the phenomenon &quot;pattern rivalry&quot;.

After a burst of research activity in the 1970s, monocular rivalry fell out of favour when Georgeson and Phillips (1980) argued that monocular rivalry arises from afterimages and eye movements. They argued that with gratings, prolonged fixation of the stimuli builds up a negative afterimage that will tend to cancel the real images, making both invisible (a form of neural adaptation). An eye movement at right angles to one grating of one half of the period of the grating will make the afterimage reinforce that original image, making it spring into visibility while the other grating remains invisible. A correct eye movement at right angles to the second grating will make it visible and leave the first invisible. Random eye movements, therefore, could be responsible for the random fluctuations in clarity and visibility of the two images.

Although afterimages and eye movements must contribute to monocular rivalry, they cannot be a complete explanation for at least four reasons: First, it occurs with stimuli other than gratings for which afterimages would not cancel or reinforce the original images (e.g., Sindermann &amp; Lüddeke, 1972). Second, it occurs when the stimuli themselves are afterimages; these cannot be cancelled or reinforced by eye movements (Crassini &amp; Broerse, 1982). Third, sometimes a perceptual alternation occurs after an eye movement in the wrong direction for Georgeson and Phillips&#x27;s explanation (Bradley &amp; Schor, 1988). Fourth, visibility of an irregular composite of the two images cannot be explained by eye movements. To be explained by cancellation of afterimages, such composites impossibly require that different parts of the retina move in different directions.

In 1997, Andrews and Purves revived interest in monocular rivalry by showing that its alternations could be entrained by binocular rivalry alternations in an adjacent part of the visual field.

== Explanations of monocular rivalry ==
Tscherning (1898) pointed out the similarity of monocular rivalry to binocular rivalry. Breese (1899) attributed monocular rivalry to the same mechanism as responsible for binocular rivalry. Leopold and Logothetis (1999) argued that it, and binocular rivalry, are examples of multistable perception phenomena, including the Necker cube and Rubin vase figure.

<doc id="1313019" wikidata="Q3522580" url="?curid=1313019" title="The Sacramento Union">
<text>The Sacramento Union was a daily newspaper founded in 1851 in Sacramento, California. It was the oldest daily newspaper west of the Mississippi River before it closed its doors after 143 years in January 1994, no longer able to compete with &quot;The Sacramento Bee&quot;, which was founded in 1857, just six years after the &quot;Union&quot;.

==Founding==
The birth of this storied newspaper institution began in 1851 when the city of Sacramento was in its infancy.

Under the direction of its first editor, Dr. John F. Morse, who had attracted proprietors through letters to the &quot;New Orleans Delta&quot; and well-known literary attainments, The &quot;Union&quot; was initially printed as &quot;The Daily Union&quot; on Wednesday, March 19, 1851. Upon the front page of this 23-inch by 34-inch paper, Morse addressed the readers of The &quot;Union&quot;, committing to “publish the first news in the best style and at the lowest prices” and “to have an efficient correspondent in every important town and mining region in the state.”

The paper had evolved through the efforts of four &quot;Sacramento Transcript&quot; printers. The printers had introduced the idea of The &quot;Union&quot;″s creation a year earlier, due to their frustrations with a labor dispute between the &quot;Transcript&quot; and the &quot;Placer Times&quot;, which were the city&#x27;s first two newspapers. The battle between these two newspapers became so fierce that the papers sold advertising space for below the cost of composition for the mere purpose of undercutting their competition.

Opening its operation at its 21 J St. headquarters, The &quot;Union&quot; endured very competitive times during its early years, when it was one of about 60 Sacramento newspapers.

Sacramento&#x27;s status as a newspaper town, however, was short-lived, as all but two newspapers failed, leading to the &quot;Union&quot;″s famous slogan, “The Oldest Daily in the West”. The &quot;Union&quot;″s early years are also recognized for their famous contributors, who included Mark Twain, Bret Harte and Dan De Quille.
&quot;The Daily Union&quot; evolved quite quickly as a leading newspaper, as its initial circulation of 500 was soon afterward expanded with an even wider circulation and the daily publication was joined by the semi-monthly &quot;Steamer Union&quot; (1851) for Atlantic states and European readers, the &quot;Weekly Union&quot; (1852), and the semi-annual &quot;Pictorial Union&quot; (1853), which featured drawings of towns, landscapes and other scenes of the era.

The &quot;Union&quot;, which was often referred to as the “Miners’ Bible” during its early years, passed a major test when it overcame a great fire on November 2, 1852, and continued printing on a small press that was saved from the flames. A brick building, which still stands today, was later constructed at 121 J Street to replace the paper&#x27;s original building, a California Historical Landmark No. 605. 

In 1852, Thomas Gardiner, one of the founders of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, was publisher of the &quot;Union.&quot;

On November 17, 1858, The &quot;Union&quot; became the first California newspaper to issue a double-sheet daily. The publication was also recognized as the largest double-sheet daily in the nation.

The Sacramento Publishing Co. purchased the &quot;Sacramento Daily Union&quot;, as it was then known, and the &quot;Daily Record&quot; in 1875, and merged them into one newspaper, calling it the &quot;Sacramento Daily Record-Union&quot; – a name that was later dropped.

===Mark Twain and &quot;The Sacramento Union&quot;===
The Missouri-born Samuel Langhorne Clemens, who is better known by his pen name of Mark Twain, is remembered most for his contributions to &quot;The Union&quot;. This point was evident through the large bronze bust of Twain, which sat just west of the State Capitol in the lobby of The &quot;Union&quot;’s latter building at 301 Capitol Mall.
Inscribed on the bust were Twain’s words: “Early in 1866, George Barnes invited me to resign my reportership on his paper, the &quot;San Francisco Morning Call&quot;, and for some months thereafter, I was without money or work; then I had a pleasant turn of fortune. The proprietors of the &quot;Sacramento Union&quot;, a great and influential daily journal, sent me to the Sandwich Islands to write four letters a month at twenty dollars a piece. I was there for four or five months, and returned to find myself about the best known man on the Pacific Coast.”

Twain dispatched a series of articles on Hawaii for &quot;The Union&quot; in 1866. These were very popular, and many historians credit the series with turning Twain into a journalistic star. Because many people thought that Twain wrote in &quot;The Union&quot; building, whenever &quot;The Union&quot; was struggling financially during the turn of the 20th century, the owners would drag out an old desk and sell it for a princely sum as &quot;the desk where Mark Twain sat.&quot;

Unfortunately, said Charlotte Gilmore, former head of &quot;The Union&quot;″s “morgue” or bound volumes collection, the original Twain articles were cut out and stolen from &quot;The Union&quot;″s bound volumes during the 1970s.

“Sometime after I left in the summer of 1971, it happened,” Gilmore said. “It’s a very disappointing situation, but at least the (Twain) articles were photographed (for microfilm) before this happened.”

The &quot;Union&quot;″s bound volumes, as well as the bronze bust of Twain, are now in the possession of the Shields Library at UC Davis, having been donated by the Danel and Reboin families, owners of the Herald Printing Co. The Twain articles can be viewed on microfilm at the Sacramento Public Library&#x27;s central location at 828 I St.

===Late 20th century===
In 1966, the paper was purchased by Copley Press, which brought in millions of dollars that resulted in improvements such as the 1967 construction of the publication&#x27;s Capitol Mall headquarters and a new long-run, photo-offset press. During those years it was the dominant morning newspaper in Sacramento. Then, in the mid-1970s, the &quot;Bee,&quot; previously an afternoon newspaper, decided to go head-to-head with the &quot;Union&quot; as a morning newspaper and promised that the &quot;Bee&quot; would arrive on the doorstep by 6:00 a.m. The &quot;Union&quot; circulation department couldn&#x27;t equal that service, and the &quot;Bee&quot; quickly became the larger of the two dailies. While the &quot;Bee&quot; had a much larger staff, the &quot;Union&quot; beat the &quot;Bee&quot; on a number of huge stories. Among them were the Dorothea Puente Victorian grave sites and the investigative reporting that led to the resignation of California Department of Education Superintendent Bill Honig.

Copley sold the &quot;Union&quot; to conservative financier Richard Mellon Scaife in 1977. While there were reports that Scaife lost millions of dollars every year on the newspaper, he enjoyed having a conservative voice in the capital of the largest liberal state in the union. In the late 1980s, the newspaper changed from the standard broadsheet size to a tabloid, and the &quot;Union&quot; launched a marketing campaign called &quot;Grab the Tab.&quot; For the most part, it was a failure and the paper suffered losses in circulation.

In 1989, Scaife sold the &quot;Union&quot; to local real estate developers Daniel Benvenuti Jr. and David Kassis. They hired Joseph Farah as editor. Under Farah&#x27;s editorship, the paper veered even further to the right and became, in the words of a former &quot;Union&quot; journalist, &quot;a mouthpiece for the fundamentalist Christian right, preoccupied with abortion, homosexuals and creationism.&quot; Benvenuti and Kassis sold the newspaper&#x27;s press in 1991 to a Mexican town and had the paper printed at Herald Printing. In 1992, Herald&#x27;s president Ralph Danel Jr. acquired the &quot;Union&quot; from Benvenuti and Kassis in November 1992; the selling price was in large part the debt that Benvenuti and Kassis owed Herald for its printing services.

The newspaper in 1991 and 1992 ran a series of investigative reports that revealed that then-state Superintendent of Public Instruction Bill Honig had directed state education officials to contract with a company run by his wife, Nancy, out of their San Francisco home, that was designed to get parents more involved in their children&#x27;s education. At Honig&#x27;s direction, state funds were ultimately used to pay employees of Nancy Honig&#x27;s company, the Quality Education Project (QEP). Bill Honig was later indicted and convicted on conflict-of-interest charges, although the felonies were later reduced to misdemeanors. Honig, who had been rumored to be a candidate for California governor, attributed the investigation to Republicans who didn&#x27;t want him to win higher office.

In an attempt to reduce losses, circulation was dropped outside of the Sacramento metro area and, two months before its closure, publication was changed from seven days a week to three days a week. The formerly daily &quot;Union&quot; published its final edition on Friday, January 14, 1994. The cover featured a color photo of the paper&#x27;s last staff under the blaring headline, &quot;We&#x27;re History,&quot; coined by the newspaper&#x27;s last editor, Ken Harvey.

==Revival attempts==
===2005: &quot;Sacramento Union Magazine&quot;===
The road to the rebirth of &quot;The Union&quot; in its newspaper form began in early 2004, when the name of the newspaper was acquired for the purpose of restarting the publication.

To meet its goals, the new &quot;Union&quot; set up offices in Fair Oaks and worked with former &quot;Union&quot; publishing staff to prepare for its return.

In August 2004, a modernized &quot;Sacramento Union&quot; returned with bimonthly magazines, then started publishing monthly in May 2005. James H. Smith, a former publisher of the &quot;Sacramento Union&quot; newspaper and co-founder of the Western Journalism Center with Farah, served as publisher, and Kenneth E. Grubbs Jr., former director of the National Journalism Center who had also worked for the Orange County Register, served as editor.

The publishers did not intend to return as a print daily newspaper, concentrating instead on web and magazine publishing.

Due to its very limited success, the magazine ceased existing after only five issues. Much of the office staff was laid off in May 2005.

Ryan Rose, The &quot;Union&quot;″s current managing editor, served as the magazine&#x27;s Web editor; he said that many people were confused upon seeing The &quot;Union&quot; as a magazine.

“We were known in this region for more than 100 years as a newspaper and then less than 10 years after The Union closed as a newspaper, we reissued it as a magazine and I firmly believe that the magazine suffered because we betrayed the brand,” Rose said.

After several months of dormancy, a new print edition of &quot;The Sacramento Union&quot; appeared on Friday, July 21, 2006, sporting a similar masthead as the magazine and the notation &quot;Since 1851&quot;. The volume number in the paper was listed as &quot;Volume 1, Number 1.&quot;

===2006-2009: Tabloid===

In 2006, &quot;The Sacramento Union&quot; was reborn as a tabloid-sized free weekly newspaper from 2006 to 2009. Published by the Sacramento Union, LLC, the paper also published a daily news website. J.C. Dutra was &quot;The Union&quot;″s publisher and editor-in-chief. The paper was conservative in tone.

The &quot;Sacramento Union&quot; suspended publication of both the paper and the website in March 2009.

The &quot;Sacramento Union&quot; was acquired along with 45 other newspapers across the United States by a holding company controlled by Bruce Edgar Slaton Jr. for an undisclosed price.

==Newspaper building==
In the autumn of 2005, demolition crews razed the old daily &quot;Union&quot; office building, located at 301 Capitol Mall in downtown Sacramento. The building was constructed in 1967. (Earth Metrics Inc., 1989.) A 53-story high-rise called &quot;The Towers on Capitol Mall&quot; was planned for the &quot;Union&quot;&#x27;s previous spot, but by 2007, the developer was struggling to finance the project and plans were scrapped. The former location is currently fenced off and its future is unknown.

==Archives==
The archives of the daily &quot;Union&quot; are in the Special Collections of the Shields Library of UC Davis. California Digital Newspaper Collection has in its on-line archives the Sacramento Daily Union (Sacramento, 1851–1899). Sacramento Public Library&#x27;s holdings contain complete microfilm archives of &quot;The Sacramento Union&quot; from 1851 (founding) to January 1994 (when publication ceased) and are located at its Central Library.

<text>Blades of Steel, later released in Japan as , is an ice hockey video game released by Konami for North American arcades in 1987, and ported to the Family Computer Disk System and Nintendo Entertainment System in 1988. All teams are fictional but based out of real Canadian and American cities. The game is known for its fast-paced hockey action and especially for the fighting. It is a one or two player game. When playing against the computer, there are three difficulty levels to choose from: Junior, College, and Pro (with Pro being the most difficult and Junior being the easiest). Each team consists of three forwards, two defencemen, and a goaltender.

Two sequels were released: &quot;NHL Blades of Steel &#x27;99&quot; and &quot;NHL Blades of Steel 2000&quot;. The NES version was re-released on Nintendo&#x27;s Virtual Console service on December 24, 2007. The arcade version was re-released on Microsoft&#x27;s Game Room service on November 24, 2010.

==Gameplay==
At the beginning of the game, players can select either &quot;Exhibition&quot; or &quot;Tournament&quot; matches. An exhibition match is just one game played against either the computer or another player. Tournament matches are similar to the NHL playoffs. It starts out as one team of the player&#x27;s choice going against other teams in a playoff style tournament. The team that is successful in beating all of the opposing teams is awarded the Cup.

Fighting in the game is initiated whenever two players bump into each other three times in a row without hitting another player. The two players will stop skating and engage in pre-fight confrontation where they are able to exchange punches if they choose. If a player rapidly punches their opponent during the pre-fight, there is a chance they will knock their opponent down and neither player suffers a penalty. If mutual punches are thrown during the pre-fight sequence, then a voice yells &quot;fight&quot;, the fight screen appears, and the gamers take control of their players. During the fight a player can punch high, punch low, block high, or block low and is given a health bar of five hits. The loser, the first person to get hit five times, is given a penalty and sent to the penalty box (the winner is not punished), creating a power play opportunity of 5-on-4 skaters. Up to four players can be penalized, for a maximum of a 5-on-1 advantage. If a fight occurs close to one of the nets, the referee may break up the fight and call a penalty shot.

During the second intermission, either a playable mini-game will appear for Player One to play or a Konami ad will appear featuring a bear shooting the puck into a net mouthing the words &quot;Nice Shot!&quot; The mini-game is actually an advertisement for &quot;Contra&quot; and other Konami games, in which (at one point) a little spaceship is trying to destroy a much larger spaceship, this being a reference to &quot;Gradius&quot;.

If the score is tied at the end of the game, a shoot out (similar to a penalty shot) is used to determine the winner. Each team gets five shots. The team with the most goals after five shots is the winner. If, after that, the game is still tied, each team keeps getting one more shot until a winner is determined.

There are a total of eight teams (four from Canada and four from the United States), each one representing a city that housed an NHL team at the time of development. The four Canadian cities are Toronto, Vancouver, Montreal, and Edmonton. The four American teams are from New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and Minnesota. Teams are depicted with jerseys that vary in color.

This game also features distinct voice samples, which were rare at the time in NES games. The voice says &quot;Blades of Steel!&quot; on the title screen, &quot;Faceoff&quot; before each faceoff, &quot;Fight&quot; when a fight breaks out, &quot;It&#x27;s a pass&quot; after a successful pass is made, &quot;Penalty shot,&quot; and an &quot;Aaahhh!&quot; made by the losing player after a fight, or when a player skates into a goalie. The NES passing sound bite is garbled and has been interpreted as &quot;With the pass&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s a pass&quot;, etc. but the arcade passing bite is clearly audible and confirms the phrase as &quot;Get the pass&quot;. The arcade version has a greater variety of sound bites and commentary owing to the hardware&#x27;s better speech faculties and extra memory.

&quot;Blades of Steel&quot; differs from the professional game in the NHL in the late 1980s in that it has no offside rule, and its interpretation of penalties does not correspond to the rules of real ice hockey. The game&#x27;s officials only call two penalties. Players who lose a fistfight are penalized for two minutes, an abstract reworking of the five-minute offsetting majors normally assigned in the event of a fight. Should a fight break out in front of one team&#x27;s net, then the player on offense gets a penalty shot. The penalty shot is administered in the style of a soccer penalty shot, in that the shooting player must stand on the blue line, instead of moving towards the goaltender. The game also recognizes icing infractions, with an appropriate game reset and faceoff in the liable team&#x27;s zone.

==Reception==

&quot;Blades of Steel&quot; has been well received by critics. Allgame editor Skyler Miller described the game as &quot;one of the most enjoyable sports games of its era&quot;. Reviews of the Virtual Console release were mostly positive. Marcel van Duyn of Nintendo Life opined that the game has aged fairly well compared to other Konami sports titles on the NES such as Double Dribble. Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer was more critical of the game, stating that &quot;The graphics aren&#x27;t particularly good, even by 1987 NES standards, with the same model repeated over and over for the players, and some garish colour combinations are used to tell the teams apart.&quot; &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; opted to exclude it from their &quot;100 Best Games of All Time&quot; in favor of &quot;Ice Hockey&quot;, explaining that &quot;We realize &quot;Blades of Steel&quot; was an excellent game for its time, with far better graphics than &quot;Ice Hockey&quot;. But the fact is, if you had to pick between these two games today, &quot;Ice Hockey&quot; is clearly more fun. For sheer realism we can turn to one of the newer NHL games on the 32-bit systems.&quot;

==Legacy==
&quot;Blades of Steel&quot; was followed by two sequels: &quot;NHL Blades of Steel &#x27;99&quot; for the Nintendo 64 and &quot;NHL Blades of Steel 2000&quot; for the PlayStation. Climax Studios developed Game Boy Color versions for both games.

<text>The  (State Police or P.S.) is one of the national police forces of Italy. Alongside the Carabinieri, it is the main police force for providing police duties, primarily to cities and large towns, and with its child agencies it is also responsible for highway patrol (), railways (), airports (), customs (together with the Guardia di Finanza), as well as certain waterways, and assisting the local police forces.

It was a military force until 1981 when the Italian State Law 121 was passed. This converted the State Police to a civil force, which is in contrast to the other main police forces of Italy: the &quot;Arma dei Carabinieri&quot;, which is a military police (gendarmerie) force and the Guardia di Finanza, the Italian customs and border protection police that also falls in the military corps category.

The Polizia di Stato is the principal Italian police force for the maintenance of public security and as such it is run directly by the Department of Public Security (), and the keeping of public order (). Interpol summarizes the primary focus of this force: &quot;Its responsibilities include investigative and law enforcement duties, and the security of motorway, railway, and waterway networks.&quot;

==History==
While the modern Polizia di Stato was created in 1981 with the merger of the many civil police services of Italy, its roots date back to 1852 as the police force of the then Kingdom of Sardinia.

It is the successor and heir to the traditions of military and civil police organizations under both monarchy and republic.

===Before unification===
On 11 July 1852, the King of Sardinia Victor Emmanuel II established the Public Security Guards, a prototype city police service created to serve Turin and Genoa for the protection of their citizens (Law no.1404), and also formed detachments of municipal police. This date is marked as the official anniversary of the State Police.

At that time there were a number of provincial National Guard and Municipal Militia battalions, plus cavalry platoons detached from the army and Carabinieri.

===Unified Italy===
In 1859, given the current situation regarding the Unification of Italy, the Public Security Guards became the de facto national civil police of a unified Italian nation. Law 3570 (13 November 1859) officially introduced police inspectors into the growing force, and to ensure the security of the residents of a number of provincial capitals and other major cities, the , appointed by the leadership with Royal assent, were also introduced becoming the police chiefs of these areas.

On 9 October 1861, the General Directorate of Public Security of the Kingdom was formally established (Royal Decree 225) to serve as the central authority for civilian law enforcement.

==Mission==
Europol (the EU&#x27;s law enforcement agency), provides this summary of the force&#x27;s responsibilities: &quot;protecting the state, safeguarding the rights and freedoms of citizens, supervising the maintenance of public order, maintaining public safety, providing assistance to public entities and private in the event of accidents and disasters as well as the peaceful resolution of disputes between private individuals. It also deals with the training and education, at its facilities, of members of other police bodies ... speciality departments include the Traffic, Railway, Communications Police, the Mobile Departments and the Scientific Police.&quot;

==Strength==
The State Police has an authorised strength by law of 115,000 people. However, there are approximately 110,000 people of which 16,000 are women. Just under 6,000 employees are civilian support personnel with technical skills who provide logistic and technical support. In 2005 the State Police contained 105,324 members as follows: 893 &quot;dirigenti&quot; (leaders/officers), 1,839 &quot;vice questori&quot; (Vice-Questors), 723 &quot;commissari capo&quot; (Chief Superintendents), 19,230 &quot;ispettori&quot; (Inspectors), 666 &quot;vice ispettori&quot; (Sub-inspectors), 13,677 &quot;sovrintendenti&quot; (Sergeants), 38,976 &quot;assistenti&quot; (Senior agents), and 29,320 &quot;agenti&quot; (Constables/Agents).

Approximately 1,500 officers are assigned to the &quot;neighbourhood police&quot; service, the , which has a police presence on the streets and deters crime. Pairs of (policemen) patrol areas of major cities on foot.

==Organization==
The headquarters of the Polizia di Stato are in Rome and its chief is referred to as the (&quot;Chief of the Police&quot;) with official Rank of (&quot;Chief of the Police – Director General of Public Security&quot;). The Chief of the State Police is also the Honorary President of the &quot;National Association of State Police&quot; (). Three vice chiefs/directors-general report to the chief and their main functions are:
* accomplishment of the functions
* planning and coordination activity
* Director of the Criminal Investigation Police

The force is organized on a regional and provincial basis. The territory of the Italian Republic is divided into 20 regions. They include 107 provincial commands—one each in the 14 metropolitan cities (), 80 provinces (), 6 free municipal consortiums (, the formal provinces of Sicily), 4 abolished Friuli-Venezia Giulia provinces, 2 autonomous provinces—Bolzano – Alto Adige and Trento and 1 in Valle d&#x27;Aosta, which is an autonomous region with no provinces nor akin administrative subdivision at all. The administrative centre of each provincial command is the local headquarters, called which is commanded by a &quot;Questore&quot; (that is also the highest State Police authority for the province – – &quot;Provincial Authority of Public Security&quot;). The only exception is the recently created province of South Sardinia (established in and operational since 2016). The territory of each province is further divided into Public Security Offices (), commanded by a or (&quot;Chief Commissioner&quot;). The lowest public security authority is the police station or precinct ().

To control the flow of migrants into Italy, the Department of Public Security set up the Immigration and Border Police Service (Polizia di Frontiera), to enforce regulations concerning the entry and stay of aliens in Italy. The service operates at both central and local levels with many land, air and maritime border police offices.

The service is also responsible for passport control, the issuing of residence permits, as well as the prevention and control of illegal immigration. Although due to the Schengen Agreement the land borders have disappeared, the division is still present on all borders to do systematic or random checks. In airports, the border police are in charge of security (hand baggage searches are done by airport companies or private security companies but are supervised by the Polizia di Frontiera and by the Guardia di Finanza) and immigration checks.

===Mobile units===
There are 13 mobile units of &quot;Reparto Mobile&quot; located in the main Italian cities. These can be deployed throughout the country to maintain public order with crowd-control equipment and vehicles or perform rescue services in areas affected by natural disasters. These units employ personnel that are trained and equipped for their task.

The P.d.S.&#x27;s bomb disposal units, mounted detachments, canine units, air support squadrons and maritime and river police units all fall under the mobile unit HQ.

===Anti-Terrorism Police===

The Anti-Terrorism Police is a specialist body made up of the Central Directorate for the Anti-Terrorism Police and of the Branches for &quot;General Investigations and Special Operations Division&quot; (DIGOS – &quot;Divisione Investigazioni Generali e Operazioni Speciali&quot;), located in the &quot;questure&quot; at the local level. The Directorate for the Anti-Terrorism Police has two departments: one is mainly responsible for information collection and analysis while the other develops and coordinates investigations aimed at preventing and fighting terrorism. The Nucleo Operativo Centrale di Sicurezza (Central Operational Core of Security) is the State Police&#x27;s elite police tactical unit.

==Training==
Recruit training is carried out at the police academy and at an advanced school for senior police officers. There are schools for basic training of cadet officers and technical operators, for teaching police specialities, for instructors, pilots, dog handlers, mounted police officers and the community police school.

==Vehicles==


The State Police use Italian vehicles ranging from 1994 Fiat Puntos to the Alfa Romeo 159 2,4 JTD, and the Alfa Romeo 155 8v and foreign makes such as the Subaru Legacy SW and Subaru Forester, BMW E46 and E91, and the Volvo XC70.
In May 2004 the PdS received two Lamborghini Gallardos equipped with V10 engines and in the classic blue-white livery with accessories such as a container for transporting organs and a defibrillator. The cars are used on the A3 Salerno-Reggio Calabria and the A14 Bologna-Taranto motorways.

On 29 November 2009, one of the two Gallardos was severely damaged in an accident while returning from a public display in Cremona: it crashed into some parked cars while avoiding another car which crossed the road illegally. The Gallardo was fully insured, and is currently being repaired by Lamborghini itself.

On 30 March 2017, the PdS received the second Lamborghini Huracán equipped with V10 engines and 520 bhp in the classic blue-white livery with accessories such as a container for transporting organs and a defibrillator.

<text>Witch World is a speculative fiction project of American writer Andre Norton, inaugurated by her 1963 novel &quot;Witch World&quot; and continuing more than four decades. Beginning in the mid-1980s, when she was about 75 years old, Norton recruited other writers to the project, and some books were published only after her death in 2005. The Witch World is a planet in a parallel universe where magic long ago superseded science; early in the fictional history, it is performed exclusively by women. The series began as a hybrid of science fiction and sword and sorcery, but for the most part it combines the latter with high fantasy. 
Witch World begins with what is now called the Estcarp cycle. These describe the adventures of Simon Tregarth from Earth, his witch wife Jaelithe, and their three children Kyllan, Kemoc and Kaththea. The series was then expanded with the High Hallack cycle, starting with &quot;Year of the Unicorn&quot; in 1965 and its sequels &quot;Jargoon Pard&quot; and &quot;Gryphon in Glory&quot;. Mostly these cycles are organized by continent, with High Hallack being on one to the west of the one containing Estcarp and its neighboring countries, with a sea in between.

<doc id="1313026" wikidata="Q833362" url="?curid=1313026" title="Fortis Group">
<text>Fortis, formally Fortis N.V./S.A., was a Benelux-centered global financial services group active in insurance, banking and investment management, initially formed in 1990 by a three-way Belgian-Dutch merger and headquartered in Brussels. It grew rapidly through multiple acquisitions, and in 2007 was the 20th largest financial services business in the world by revenue. It was listed on the Euronext Brussels, Euronext Amsterdam, and Luxembourg stock exchanges. 

Fortis encountered severe problems in the financial crisis of 2008, not least as a consequence of participating in 2007 in the joint acquisition of ABN AMRO together with Royal Bank of Scotland Group and Banco Santander. It received an emergency bailout from the governments of Belgium and the Netherlands and was broken up soon thereafter. As a consequence: 
* Fortis Bank Nederland was nationalised by the Dutch government and merged in July 2010 with ABN AMRO&#x27;s former Dutch operations, which had not yet been integrated with Fortis following the 2007 takeover, to form a new group also called ABN AMRO; 
* the other banking operations were acquired in 2008 by BNP Paribas and became part, respectively, of BNP Paribas Fortis (retaining the Fortis brand) in Belgium, BGL BNP Paribas in Luxembourg, BNP Paribas Bank Polska in Poland, and Türk Ekonomi Bankası in Turkey; 
* Fortis&#x27;s Dutch insurance operations were reorganized as ASR Nederland, the name of a Dutch insurer which Fortis had acquired in 1997; 
* the remaining insurance operations, still the largest in Belgium, were rebranded to Ageas in April 2010. 
As of 2022, the Fortis brand name is still used by BNP Paribas in Belgium, but its colorful logo was discontinued in 2009 shortly after the acquisition.

==History==




===Creation and early expansion===

Fortis came into being in 1990, as the result of a merger of insurer AMEV (for , formerly known as &quot;De Utrecht&quot;) and , both based in Utrecht; the combined entity, named &quot;AMEV/VSB 1990&quot;, was joined in December 1990 year by AG Insurance, a Belgian insurer, and the resulting group was branded Fortis, establishing a landmark precedent for cross-border mergers in the European financial services sector.

In 1993, Fortis acquired a majority stake in ASLK / CGER, a major Belgian bank, and took full ownership in 1999; meanwhile ASLK / CGER in 1995 acquired Société Nationale de Crédit à l&#x27;Industrie (, SNCI/NMKN), another significant Belgian bank. In March 1997 Fortis acquired MeesPierson from ABN AMRO, thus establishing its presence in investment banking. In June 1998, Fortis acquired Generale Bank (GB) after winning a fierce takeover battle against ABN AMRO. In March 2000, the branches of VSB Bank, ASLK / CGER and GB were all rebranded as Fortis Bank. 

In 2000 Fortis acquired Dutch insurer ASR Nederland, itself formed from a recent merger involving the storied Stad Rotterdam Verzekeringen, which made it the second-largest insurer in the Netherlands and the largest overall in the Benelux. In November 2002, it purchased most of the Dutch corporate banking activities of KBC Group. In August 2003, it sold Theodoor Gilissen Bankiers, a former subsidiary of MeesPierson, to KBC. 
In April 2005, Fortis started expanding farther abroad by acquiring the Turkish bank from Doğan Holding, whose branches it also rebranded Fortis. In the UK it acquired Dryden Wealth Management from Prudential Financial on 4 October 2005, but sold insurance activities in the United States from 2000 onward. As of 2006, the company&#x27;s profits were €4.56 billion, according to &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine with a market value of €45.74 billion.

In early 2005, Fortis put Banque Belgolaise, its sub-saharan Africa subsidiary, up for sale. Failing to find a suitable buyer, Fortis ceased all operations after October 23, 2006. In October 2006, it signed a joint venture with An Post (Irish postal service) to provide financial services through the An Post network of offices. In October 2006, Fortis acquired 100% of Polish retail bank Dominet, which had 806 employees and over 125 branches and franchises. It further expanded into Asia in 2007 by acquiring Pacific Century Insurance Holdings, later Fortis Insurance Asia. 

On October 8, 2007, a consortium of three European banks, Royal Bank of Scotland, Fortis and Banco Santander, completed the acquisition of ABN AMRO through RFS Holdings, a joint vehicle named after their respective initials. After the split, Fortis would get the retail and business activities in the Benelux and the international investment company; integration of the retail activities into Fortis Bank to be subject to permission of De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB); the business activities to be re-sold because of EU-regulations on market share.

Fortis Insurance UK had its own in-house worldwide medical emergency service, Assistance International. Fortis was the shirt sponsor of the R.S.C. Anderlecht and Feyenoord Rotterdam football clubs. Fortis was also the main sponsor of the Turkish Cup and the Luxembourg National Division.

===Crisis and breakup in 2008-2009===

On October 3, 2008, an announcement was made that the Dutch government had agreed with the Belgian government to buy Fortis Bank Nederland, Fortis Verzekeringen Nederland, and Fortis Corporate Insurance. On October 5, 2008, the Belgian government announced it had bought Fortis Bank Belgium, and re-sold 75% of it to BNP Paribas, which also bought Fortis Insurance Belgium. The Government of Luxembourg holds a third part of Fortis Banque Luxembourg. The actual Fortis Group itself remained as a virtual empty shell, holding only Fortis Insurance International, which holds insurances in Europe and Asia.

On December 12, 2008, a court decision (see below) made the sales of October 3, 5, and 6 contingent on shareholder approval (at the latest on February 12, 2009). Until that time, the Dutch government held the parts it bought, Fortis Bank was the property of the Belgium government, while Fortis Insurance Belgium remained with Fortis Group (together with Fortis Insurance International). On February 11, 2009, the shareholders declined to approve the sales, making the sales illegitimate; actual ownership of the various parts became a matter of further negotiations and/or litigation. A re-negotiation led to new deal, subject to shareholder approval (meetings on April 8–9, 2009).

====ABN AMRO takeover and the resulting drop in share value====
Fortis was part of the consortium with Royal Bank of Scotland Group (RBS) and Banco Santander, that announced on October 8, 2007, that an offer for 86% of outstanding ABN AMRO stock had been accepted, making way for the largest ever bank takeover in history. On November 1, 2007, an extraordinary shareholder meeting was held to change ABN AMRO&#x27;s management. Mark Fisher from RBS took over as CEO. At that meeting the consortium stated that 97% of all shares were in their hands.

Fortis would use the ABN AMRO brand name for Fortis&#x27;s retail banking operations in the Netherlands.

The take-over price was felt to be on the high side (on February 26, 2009, the Royal Bank of Scotland announced to book a loss of over £16 billion on its share in ABN-AMRO).

====Issuing extra shares====
To finance the purchase, Fortis issued extra shares available to the existing shareholders at a discount, making for the special bargain price of €15 per share.

However, by June 2008, Fortis announced that an international financial crisis was coming and that it needed to fortify its capital by raising an additional €8.3 billion. An extra 150 million shares were issued at €10, at that time the price of the share, but in the bigger view of things still a bargain; these were placed the same day with large investors.

A major worry was the upcoming future write-off on ABN-AMRO: the price paid included a huge amount for intangibles that could not be put on the balance sheet. The write-off would only occur if and when ABN-AMRO would cease to be an independent bank (on the integration of the retail activities of ABN-AMRO into Fortis), but Fortis would then be in danger of no longer meeting the standards for capital required of banks. Another sore point was the loss on the sale of the business activities; as the sale was forced (because EU regulations) this was not effected at full value: a €300 million loss was reported on the sale. However, it later became known that although Lippens, the chairman of the Supervisory Board of Fortis had claimed to have moved heaven and earth at the EU (only stopping short of taking the EU to court) to get an extension of the time limit so as to gain bargaining space (and a better price) it had not actually applied for an extension. Commissioner Kroes reported there had been no contact whatsoever. Lippens explained that it had been merely a figure of speech.

====Share price development====
The raising of the additional €8.3 billion was effected partly by eliminating the year&#x27;s dividend, saving €1.5 billion. However, Lippens previously had explicitly and repeatedly promised that the dividend would be paid out untouched. This dividend had for decades been one of the main selling-points of the Fortis share, which was as safe and reliable an investment as a bank. Eliminating it dismayed the shareholders, and share value dropped from above €12 to just over €10 on June 26 (reducing the value of the company by over €4 billion), followed by a further decline.

In an analysis of December 12, 2008 (six months after the events), &quot;Het Financieele Dagblad&quot; describes that in drawing up the plan, Fortis had disregarded the effects on the shareholders. When approached, the British and American shareholders were surprised that Fortis needed more money so soon after the earlier share issue: they refused to buy more, feeling that Fortis had proved unreliable. Only some rather unusual shareholders, the Dutch ABP, the Russian &quot;Millennium&quot;, the Libyan LIA and the Chinese Ping An were prepared to buy anew, but demanded a 25% discount and the assurance that further measures were taken. The Belgian shareholders (holding a total of 15% of outstanding shares) were neglected and heard of the plan only after it had been announced. Many of these had contracted loans to pay for the earlier share issue and were counting on the dividend to pay off these loans. They were furious to be surprised. That, by the time the announcement was made that the shares had been placed with large investors at a share price of €10, the share price had actually dropped to €10, negating the discount obtained, was co-incidence

On July 11, 2008, the CEO of Fortis Jean Votron stepped down (reports conflict as to the position of Lippens who was reported to be pressured to step down, but refusing). or offering to step down but yielding graciously to appeals to stay The total value of Fortis, as reflected by share value, was at that time a third of what it had been before the acquisition, and just under the value it had paid for ABN Amro&#x27;s Benelux activities alone. Share price continued to waver below €10. Votron was succeeded as CEO by Herman Verwilst, who after a few weeks held a press conference to introduce himself and to reassure the shareholders that Fortis was solid. He succeeded in making a good impression for a short while and share price firmed up. This was helped by the announcement that Maurice Lippens, from the supervisory board, had personally bought a large number of shares (at just below €9 per share). However, as the markets in general declined, so did the share price of Fortis. On Thursday, September 25, 2008, Fortis shares plunged to €5.5 (intraday). This was attributed to a rumor that the Rabobank had been asked to help out in Fortis&#x27;s financial difficulties. When the rumor was denied by both Fortis and Rabobank the shares recovered somewhat. The next day, Fortis put out a press release that since the beginning of 2008, only about 3% of the deposits at the bank had been withdrawn and the CEO (Verwilst) held a press conference to reassure analysts and stockholders. He did not produce actual figures on the state of affairs, but merely stated that Fortis was solid and that there was no reason at all to believe a bankruptcy was at hand. Shares plunged again (closing at a little over €5). The CEO stepped down that same evening and Filip Dierckx (whose Merchant banking division was considered within the company as the architect behind the investments in sub prime and which got the company into difficulties) was named as the new CEO, to be approved by a shareholder meeting. In one week the shares of Fortis had dropped 35% (20% in the final two days).

According to the Fortis&#x27;s Shareholder Circular of November 20, it was only on Friday, September 26, that liquidity problems began, with large withdrawals by business customers, due to the bankruptcy rumours. According to the November 24 court proceedings of the Ondernemingskamer, on that Friday €20 billion was withdrawn, with an additional withdrawal of €30 billion expected for the following Monday. There were no solvency problems, only liquidity problems. The government of Luxembourg approached Fortis with an offer of assistance, and Fortis drew up a plan with the governments of Luxembourg and Belgium with financial support from Shanti Swami Trust (Privet Family Trust from USA /BVI) contributing €12.5 billion and €14.5 billion, for a temporary (one year) 51% (SS Trust) + 25% share in Fortis Banque Luxembourg and Fortis Bank, respectively. This plan included selling the Dutch ABN-AMRO to the Dutch Government

As reported on December 24 by &quot;Het Financieele Dagblad&quot;, what had happened on September 25 was that Fortis had been summoned by the Belgium financial regulator, the CBFA to seek a strong partner for help in its problems.

====Governments step in====
Fortis then became subject of discussion on an emergency meeting of the Dutch and Belgian minister of finance and financial regulators, and rumours about partial or total takeovers are spread.
It was later reported that other banks had indeed made preliminary take-over bids (ING offering €1.50 per share, and BNP Paribas €2), but these talks were curtailed, as governments took central place
Fortis was partially nationalised on September 28, 2008, with the three Benelux countries investing a total of €11.2 billion (US$16.3 billion),(£10 billion) in the bank. The initial press releases reported that Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg would invest respectively €4.7 billion, €4 billion and €2.5 billion in the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg Fortis Banks. In actuality, Belgium invested its stake into Fortis Bank SA/NV (Fortis&#x27;s overall banking division) in return for newly issued shares, making up 49% of total outstanding shares in that company, with the Netherlands doing the same for Fortis Bank Nederland (part of Fortis Bank SA/NV). Luxembourg has agreed to a loan convertible into a 49% share of Fortis Banque Luxembourg (also part of Fortis Bank SA/NV). This meant that only a third of the banking division would still be owned by Fortis Group, and that only a third of any future profits by the banking division (including the investment branch) would benefit the shareholder. However, the shareholder would still get the full profits of the insurance division; also, he was assured of the safe continuation of the company.

At the same time, it was announced that plans to integrate the retail activities of ABN AMRO into Fortis had been stopped, and that these activities would be sold. A sale at less than €12 billion would have consequences for the core equity of Fortis (core equity at that moment was reported at €30 billion, or circa €13 per share).

The next day share price first rose, but then plummeted, taking the rest of the market with it (a &#x27;Black Monday&#x27;). However, it never dropped all too much below €4; over the rest of the week it recovered, never quite achieving €6; it closed the week at €5.4. Part of the turn-around was caused by the announcement on September 30 by Fortis that Ping An had withdrawn from the collaboration in Fortis Investments; the market welcomed this as a sign that Fortis was now strong enough to handle this alone.

According to the Shareholder Circular (of November 20) in this week large withdrawals by business customers continued, causing further liquidity problems. The national banks provided emergency credit (€59 and 7 billion, from the Belgian and Dutch banks &amp;SS Trust (Shanti Swami Privet Trust), respectively) and this was indeed used, almost to the full extent (€54 and 7 billion, respectively).

On December 9, an interview with Dutch Minister of Finance Bos was published in &quot;Vrij Nederland&quot;; he stated that the basic idea of buying back a part of Fortis had circulated before the summer. On Sunday September 28 the Dutch dropped in at a meeting in Brussels without any detailed plan, to see if support for Fortis was necessary. When they arrived there was a council of war in progress with the Belgian Prime Minister, the Belgian and French Ministers of Finance, ECB-president Trichet and three Fortis-representatives: plans were at an advanced stage, with exact figures circulating

====Divestment of Dutch assets====

On October 3, in a press conference (at 18.00h), broadcast live on television, the Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende, Dutch Minister of Finance Wouter Bos and DNB-president Nout Wellink announced that the Dutch government would purchase the Dutch banking and insurance divisions of Fortis for €16.8 billion ($23.3 billion). The Dutch government would become holder of Fortis Bank Nederland, Fortis Verzekeringen Nederland and Fortis Corporate Insurance, as well as the retail activities of ABN AMRO still held by Fortis. This was later confirmed by a press release from the Dutch ministry of finance. At the same time the Luxembourg government and SS Trust has increased its control of its part to 52%. Later, it became known that Luxembourg had also bought parts of the Luxembourg bourse and another Fortis company for a symbolic price of €1.

Initially, the Belgian Prime Minister Leterme welcomed the Dutch (and Luxembourg) take-over as good news for customers, shareholders and personnel, saying that this provided a solid foundation for the future.

However, Belgian newspapers reported an immediate widespread Belgian outrage. The Dutch were accused of:
#not coming through with the promised €4 billion support;
#orchestrating a withdrawal of funds by Dutch businesses from Fortis Bank Nederland in the previous week, forcing the National Bank of Belgium to come up with €50 billion in emergency credit
#cutting off credit lines to Fortis from other banks, notably from ABN-AMRO (owned by Fortis); and
#threats from the De Nederlandsche Bank.

In this way, the Dutch had forced the sale of whatever they wanted, below market value. Also, the wording by Dutch Minister of Finance Bos in his public announcement of October 3 was resented; he had emphasized that the Dutch companies he had bought were quite healthy and had now been safeguarded, which appeared to imply that the problems were all in the Belgian parts of Fortis, which thus were rotten.

In a TV appearance on Sunday October 5, DNB-president Nout Wellink reminisced on the negotiations, revealing that the Dutch, in the end, had paid more than strict market value, to help out the Belgians. He assured the audience that the remaining (Belgian) part of Fortis was now a very well capitalized company.

Later, the Dutch media reported that the Dutch, after coming home from the agreement on September 28, were badly upset at the deal they had made. At the time, only a verbal agreement, on broad outlines, had been made and when it became time to put things to paper they realized that their €4 billion was only going to buy them a 50% share in a company they were only mildly interested in (Fortis Bank Nederland, later sold for €5 billion total; instead of all Dutch Fortis holdings including ABN-AMRO and the Dutch insurance company) and that the Belgians for their €4.7 billion were getting a 50% share in the overall banking holding (including not only Fortis Bank Nederland and Luxembourg, but also Fortis Investments and ABN-AMRO). In addition, it became apparent that the Belgian government had secured additional rights on the Dutch insurance company. Thus, while Dutch Minister of Finance Bos was openly defending the agreement in parliament, he was secretly conferring frantically on a re-negotiation.

This was affirmed later in an analysis by &quot;Het Financieele Dagblad&quot;, which stated that the Dutch had been left out of the negotiations entirely, until they included themselves in, at a late stage, but at a disadvantage, causing friction and distrust. Fortis management is convinced, in hindsight, that the company could have been saved in its entirety if all three countries had been involved from the start.

On October 21, the Dutch government announced a future merger between ABN-Amro and Fortis Bank Netherlands to create a &quot;strong Dutch bank&quot;. The Dutch insurance division would be sold. On November 21, the Dutch Finance Minister, announced that they would spin off Fortis Insurance Nederland using the revived name of ASR Nederland. and on June 6, 2009, the Dutch government sold Fortis Corporate Insurance to Amlin for €350 million.

====Takeover by BNP Paribas====

After the announcement on October 3, the Belgian government went into an all-weekend emergency meeting, to confer about Fortis. The purpose stated by the Belgian Prime Minister was to prevent the value of the shares from dropping further and to ensure that Fortis would not be sold cheaply, literally &quot;not for an apple and an egg&quot; (&quot;niet voor een appel en een ei&quot;), as the Dutch saying goes.

On Sunday evening October 5, 2008, &quot;De Tijd&quot; reported that French bank BNP Paribas would take a majority stake in Fortis, with the Belgian and Luxembourg governments reduced to minority shareholders with blocking power in exchange for shares in BNP Paribas. The deal does not include the main holding company, but does include the insurance and banking subsidiaries, except for Fortis Insurance International. In more detail, the Belgian government bought the remaining 51% of Fortis Bank SA/NV from Fortis Group for an additional €4.7 billion, split off a portfolio of €10.4 billion in structured products, in which it sold a 66% share back to the Fortis Group (at €6.9 billion) and then sold a 75% share of Fortis Bank SA/NV to BNP Paribas, at an evaluation of €11 billion for the total company, to be paid by shares, making the Belgian government the biggest shareholder in BNP Paribas (at 12%). The initial investment by Belgium (€4.7 billion), and presumably that by Luxembourg (€2.5 billion), and the price paid for the Dutch banking activities (€12.8 billion) remain with Fortis Bank SA/NV, while those received for the insurance companies (€4 billion from the Dutch and €5.73 billion from BNP Paribas) go to Fortis Group. After paying for the 66% share in the portfolio and paying a debt (involving a write-off on ABN AMRO), total cash remaining with the Fortis Group is approximately €100 million.

According to the Shareholder Circular (of November 20), the Belgian Government in this weekend threatened to disown Fortis Bank outright, paying only a token €1 (total); the Board of Directors felt they had done well to hold out for the €4.7 billion, so as to have a least some shareholder value remaining in Fortis Group. The €20 billion, which was paid into Fortis Bank before and after this weekend, meant that there were no solvency problems, but these were not sure to resolve the liquidity problems, even though the Dutch were going to pay back the emergency credit enjoyed by Fortis Bank Nederland (€50 billion) almost immediately (and did indeed do so).

In an after-the-fact analysis (November 20), &quot;De Tijd&quot; reports that on Saturday October 4 both Fortis and the Belgian government went into emergency meetings, but separately. Fortis re-calculated what the remaining company could do, and figured it could earn €1.7 to 2 billion annually; a presentation to that effect was put together for the benefit of the government (this was never actually shown). The government, on the other hand, focused on selling to BNP Paribas. Apparently, a major factor in the thinking of the government was the storm raised in the press, on how the Belgians had lost out to the Dutch, and how Belgium had been left with the rotten parts of the company; this led to an atmosphere of defeatism, and they just wanted to be rid of the mess. Negotiations with BNP Paribas did not go smoothly, the French being adamant that they wanted only the banking parts and certainly wanted no part in the risky &#x27;toxic&#x27; structured products. Also, they wanted the bank cheaply. Finally, the government caved and agreed to let Fortis Group deal with the &#x27;toxic&#x27; structured products (after all, Fortis had caused the problem), while selling only the actual bank to BNP Paribas. They did manage to raise the valuation for the bank somewhat (€11 billion total, which, considering the cash just paid into the bank, still constituted a minus value of many billions for the actual banking activities). Also, they managed to get a slightly better price for the insurance company.

Dutch and Belgian shareholders&#x27; associations have requested a review of the takeover. Dutch law requires shareholder approval for major changes in a company, or its daughter-companies.

According to the Fortis website, Fortis Bank will be the 100% property of the Belgian government (from October 5) till mid December, at which point a share-swap with BNP Paribas will take place. However, BNP Paribas has already launched a major advertising campaign, in anticipation.

====Legal fallout====
On October 6, CBFA, the financial services regulatory authority for Belgium, announced that trade in Fortis shares was put on hold and permission to resume trading will be given after Fortis has published enough information about the remaining assets within Fortis.

====Remaining parts (October 6 – December 12)====

What remained in Fortis Group on October 6 was Fortis Insurance International, a company valued in the range of €1 to 2 billion, and the 66% share Fortis had purchased from the Belgian Government in the portfolio put together by the Belgian Government (paid with, as later became apparent, cash loaned by the Belgian Government).

On October 14, Fortis issued a press release stating that its cash position of €10.4 billion was sufficient to meet the €9.5 billion debt left by its component parts, and that an additional 125 million shares had been issued.
Trade in Fortis shares was resumed that same day at 11 a.m., opening at €2 and closing at €1.21 (a 77.77% loss from its previous close).

Data released on 14 November 2008 (for the special, dual meetings of shareholders on December 1 and 2), show Fortis booking a €24.6 billion loss (circa €10 per share) on the sale of its parts. Shareholder&#x27;s equity of Fortis Group was stated to have decreased to €3.5 billion per October 31 (less than €1.5 per share).

On November 15, the Belgian newspaper &quot;De Standaard&quot; reported that BNP Paribas had re-opened the negotiations on October 8, and had demanded to decrease the agreed-on price. The reason was an existing convertible loan between Fortis Group and Fortis Bank. In the end the Belgian Government loaned €3 billion to Fortis Group and in return took out a security on the portfolio it had just sold to Fortis Group. Apparently this was the reason for the suspension of the trade in shares, although neither Fortis Group nor the Belgian Government at any point prior to November 15 reported on what was happening or how this affected the value of the assets remaining in the holding. In response to the press report, Belgian politicians put the blame for the deception squarely with Fortis Group, pointing out that the Government had given out the details, but that the media had not picked up on it (among the welter of operations in support of banks).

Further renegotiations were reported on December 10, as the loan to Fortis Bank Nederland by Fortis Bank had been taken over by the Dutch government after the take-over. This resulted in less interests to be paid, and disagreement broke out who this &#x27;bonus&#x27; belonged. As this amounted to €0.25 per share (share price at that moment being €0.71) this was of some consequence to the Fortis-holding.

====Special plan====
On October 12, the Belgian government announced a plan, going by the name of &quot;Coupon 42&quot;, to recompense the long-term small shareholder. The profits enjoyed by the Belgian government were to be put in a special fund, which would pay out in 2014.
* Beneficiaries were natural persons, who are EU-citizens, or residents of Belgium, who held shares on October 3, and who applied for this.
* The maximum to be paid out per share was €10 (price of the share on July 1) minus the average price of the share over the five days after trade is resumed (this come down to a maximum of just less than €9).
* This would be paid for a maximum of 5000 shares per person, and only for those shares in possession continually from July 1 to October 3 (but not necessarily after that).
* The fund would hold the total value of the BNP Paribas shares and received dividends minus the initial investment (€9.4 billion, with an accumulated 6.1% interest per year) and minus any losses suffered on the 24% part of the portfolio of structured products held by the Belgian government.

On December 2, it became known that the Council of State has advised that this plan likely is unconstitutional, as it does not treat all shareholders equally, and does not adequately formulate the reasons for the inequality.

On December 10, &quot;De Tijd&quot; reported that the Belgian government was considering not starting the special fund, but putting everything that was to go into the fund directly into Fortis Holding, instead. This would benefit not those who held shares, to a maximum of 5000, on October 3, but those actually holding shares, any number of shares (earlier that day, share price had gone up 13.5%, to close at €0.82). Next day share price closed up 15% at €0.94 after hitting €1.14 intraday.

====Legal proceedings====
A multitude of legal proceedings was threatened, and some were indeed effected:
* In a case brought, among others, by the VEB, the Dutch association of shareholders, before the Ondernemingskamer, in Amsterdam, Fortis defended itself, October 31, by putting the full blame on the Dutch government and the DNB. These had first brought extreme pressure to bear and then had made a deal directly with the Belgian Government. All that remained for Fortis was to sign, perforce, on the dotted line. Thus, they were innocent of the disaster. The court&#x27;s ruling was made known on November 24; in anticipation trade in the share was suspended for the second part of the afternoon (from 15:45 onwards, at a share price of €0.59). In its ruling the Dutch court instituted a legal investigation into the affair (by a Committee of three), costs to be borne by Fortis, but not to exceed €600,000. The court declined to obligate Fortis to get shareholder approval, noting in wonderment that this had only been requested by Euroshareholders, the European Association of Shareholders but not by the VEB, the Dutch Association of Shareholders.
* In a case brought by Modrikamen on behalf of Belgian shareholders before the Belgian Commercial Court (Rechtbank van Koophandel / Tribunal de commerce), in Brussel, the Openbaar Ministerie, November 6, stated that the sale to BNP Paribas was illegitimate, unless it was approved by the meeting of shareholders. The ruling was made known on November 18; in anticipation trading in the shares was suspended for the afternoon (from 13:45 onwards, at a share price of €0.71). The judge ruled that Fortis&#x27;s Articles of Association did not require shareholder approval and that the sale was legitimate under Belgian law; the Board of Directors had indeed acted under duress. However, information to the shareholders had been inadequate. Also, the court appointed a Committee, of three, to look at the financial side of things. On December 16, &quot;De Tijd&quot;, noting what &quot;De Morgen&quot; reported as happening at the Appeal (see below), reported a strong rumour that in this first case the government had exerted repeated, direct pressure on one of the magistrates.
* Rumors of a legal suit to be brought against erstwhile chairman Lippens by Russian billionaire Kerimov were denied by the latter, November 20.
* It is reported that the Chinese government, brought into it by Ping An, has threatened to invoke a treaty, which stipulates that a government (party to the treaty) may only nationalize a company if this is done legally and if damages are paid (going by the value just prior to nationalization). The Belgian government should pay out €1.8 billion to Ping An to prevent this. Also the Chinese government is reported to consider a complete ban on Chinese investments in Belgium. The Belgian prime minister Leterme rejected this claim, as the treaty had not yet been ratified by the Wallonian subgovernment. The investment of Ping An in Fortis had been ill-advised and Ping An should bear the consequences of its own actions.

====December 1 and 2 meetings of shareholders====
Fortis announced to hold shareholder meetings on December 1 and 2, in The Netherlands and Belgium, with the convocation appearing on November 14. On the agenda was a justification of the sale, but not the opportunity for the shareholders to approve or disapprove this. What was on the agenda is the new composition of the executive board (with a new chairman, at a salary of €800,000) and the supervisory board and the question whether Fortis can be continued. Under Belgian law, approval by more than 50% of the capital (or a simple majority, in a second meeting) is required for a company suffering this bad a loss to be allowed to continue to exist.

However, Ping An (a major shareholder in Fortis Group, holding 4.8%) has demanded that approval of the sale is put on the agenda, and has announced to be willing to go to court over the matter. By its own Articles of Association, Fortis is required to accept such a request from a shareholder who holds a minimum of 1% of the outstanding shares, but this applies to the (annual) Ordinary General Meeting (Article 18b.4ii; the request must be made in writing, 60 days in advance), not necessarily to an Extraordinary General Meeting.

In its Shareholder Circular (November 20) Fortis acknowledges that under Dutch law approval by shareholders is required, but refers to a blanket provision in Dutch law (BW2:8), which states that no agreement or law applies if this would have results that, by standards of reasonability, are unacceptable.

The VEB and Deminor proposed new candidates, instead of those proposed by Fortis, but Fortis declined to take this into consideration. In the end, the meetings at Utrecht and Brussels went ahead with the agenda unaltered in all respects. At the meetings, the board took the position that they too were heartbroken, but that they could not help any of it and that if the EU and government measures in support of banks had been put in effect a few days earlier there would still be a Fortis. The two appeals actually made by Fortis to the government of Belgium had been rejected. The shareholders, heartbroken by their losses, and betrayed by a long string of false reassurances (by Fortis, the Belgian regulators and the Belgian government) were unimpressed. At the meeting in Utrecht, attended by well over a thousand shareholders representing slightly over 20% of the capital, the proposal to appoint Davignon as chairman of the Supervisory Board just scraped by (50.6%). At the meeting in Brussels, attended by over five thousand shareholders representing some 23% of the capital, he just failed to get support (49.9%). As two of the other candidates also failed to be elected, the old board remains in place. Both meetings were unruly, with the meeting in Belgium much more grim (all participants having to pass a metal detector), but only one shareholder was actually forcibly expelled. However, the meetings did approve the new chairman for the Executive Board. As less than 50% of the capital was represented in Brussels the question of continuing the company was not discussed, but deferred to December 19.

In addition to the December 19 meeting (in Belgium only), new meetings in January are anticipated, to address the question of the composition of the Supervisory Board.

====The Appeal and its consequences====

After the ruling in Belgium, Modrikamen instituted an appeal, at the court of appeal (Hof van beroep / Cour d&#x27;appel). At the hearing, the Openbaar Ministerie, surprisingly, reversed its earlier position that the sale had been illegitimate.

On Friday December 12 it was circulated that the ruling in the appeal, set for Monday December 15, had been deferred for up to two weeks. However, later that day, word was that the court of appeal would be taking further action that same day, although reports on what this action would be were conflicting. It was reported to concern either a request by (SFPI/FPIM) (FPIM) (the foundation acting for the Belgian government) to reopen the deliberations, by adding the EU-decision that no EU-rule on competition had been broken, or the verdict of the Court. Trade in the share was suspended from 16.30h onwards (at a share price of €0.93 in the Netherlands and €0.92 in Belgium). It later proved that on Thursday there had indeed been such a request by the FPIM, which was debated on Friday afternoon and the handling of which would indeed require up to two weeks, but the Court denied the request in its ruling, which it passed early that same evening.

In its ruling the court of appeal reversed the earlier ruling, and ordered that the actions of October 3, 5 and 6 did require shareholder approval, at a meeting of shareholders to take place no later than February 12: only those who held shares on October 14 will be allowed to vote. The agenda of the meeting of December 19 should be amended to include, as a matter of priority, if it was still necessary to deliberate on the question of whether to dissolve or continue Fortis. The FPIM is ordered to keep the shares of Fortis Bank that it obtained in October (representing a majority stake) until February 16. Also, a new Committee, of five, was appointed to investigate matters.
* In immediate response, both the Belgian government and BNP Paribas announced they would be taking further action.
* On the other hand, Peter Paul de Vries, representing Euroshareholders, stated on Dutch television that he thought this opened the way for damage claims by shareholders, suing the Dutch and especially the Belgian government.
* In response to the ruling, core members of the Belgian government met at noon the following day to confer. It was reported they considered having the ruling annulled on technical grounds (the ruling had not been read aloud, and one of the three judges had been home sick, and had not personally signed the document). Another option considered was to go ahead with the resale of the 49.93% minority stake obtained in September (in exchange for financial support that stayed within Fortis Bank) instead of the 75% majority stake. It was announced that a decision would be made on Monday evening. A further approach potentially open to the government was to take the position that as a &#x27;third party&#x27;, not heard by the Court, the ruling did not apply to them (other sources countered this by pointing out that the FPIM-foundation had represented the government). It was reported that, upon closer reflection the government decided not to try to annul the ruling on technical grounds, but to have become more determined to sell their 49.9% stake in Fortis Bank to BNP Paribas, quickly (preferably by Tuesday, but anyway within a week).
* The Dutch Ministry of Finance stated that the sale to the Dutch had been transacted under Dutch law, that the agreed on price had been paid and that the shares had been transferred: the sale was final, and was unaffected by the ruling.
* In an analysis, &quot;De Standaard&quot; notes that the ruling primarily creates the opportunity to renegotiate. The shareholders will have the opportunity to disapprove the sales, but in itself this will not necessarily reverse the sales in question. Such sales as have been finalized will thereby become illegitimate, but only a further court decision will determine if this is to result in a reversal, damages paid, or will remain without consequences. Such further court cases are best avoided, and renegotiations preferred.
* In a press conference Sunday afternoon, Modrikamen, the lawyer winning the case, appealed for calm. Now that the Court had ruled and all emergencies were over, all parties should sit down together and renegotiate to come up with a solution acceptable to all parties. He also stated that the sale to the Dutch was not necessarily a done deal: the Court had not excluded this sale from its ruling that all the transactions of October 3, 5 and 6 were subject to shareholder approval. According to &quot;de Volkskrant&quot;, Modrikamen is aiming to get an additional €6 billion from the Dutch government.
* Sunday, late afternoon, the CBFA announced that, upon request from Fortis, it had decided to keep trade in the share suspended until further notice.
* Sunday also, Fortis Bank came forward to reassure its customers, with CEO Dierckx stating that Fortis Bank was now the safest bank in the world, not only being a bank with probably the highest degree of solvability in all of Europe, but also being the 99% property of the Belgian government and being partnered with BNP Paribas, a very secure bank. All was well with the world. A day later it proved there had been no detectable unusual withdrawals of funds from Fortis Bank.
* The Belgian government is reported to be in all-out panic and to be utterly determined to sell Fortis Bank as quickly as possible to BNP Paribas anyway. The prime line of offence is to have the ruling annulled. The minister of Justice is reported to be preparing to intervene on the ground that the ruling states that it was read aloud, which it wasn&#x27;t. Also the government is reported to proceed on the basis that the &#x27;third party&#x27;-rule was violated. In the view of the government, if the ruling holds, its negotiation position will go to pieces, with BNP Paribas having the upper hand. The government has to sell with no other takers available. Thus, the ruling is not a victory for the shareholders but for BNP Paribas.
* Meetings of shareholders had been planned on Friday December 19 for both Fortis and BNP Paribas. The meeting of BNP Paribas was organized to approve issuing extra shares with which to pay for Fortis Bank, a sale which now, by court-ruling, requires approval by the shareholders of Fortis and thus has suddenly become uncertain. The meeting of Fortis (in Belgium only) was organized to decide whether or not to continue Fortis Group. The board of Fortis was ordered by the Court to alter the agenda, which it had declined to do for the December 1 &amp; 2 meetings, claiming this was impossible. The lawyers of Fortis were reported to be weighing the court-ruling versus laid-down procedure and law.
* Early on Monday, December 15, Fortis announced in a press release to conform to the court-ruling and to amend the agenda of the meeting of December 19. Also, it noted that Fortis, for the time being, would remain the owner of Fortis Insurance Belgium, but would not become the owner of 66% of the portfolio of structured credit.
* On the news that it was now uncertain that Fortis Bank could be acquired the share price of BNP Paribas dropped 10% on Monday December 15.
* In the evening of Monday, December 15, the Belgian cabinet met with Baudouin Prot, representing BNP Paribas, and afterwards announced to go ahead with the sale to BNP Paribas. The FPIM would seek an annulment; the government itself would start a &#x27;third party&#x27; procedure; and pending clearance for the sale of a 75% interest in Fortis Bank the government would proceed with the sale of its 49.93% stake.
* On December 16 &quot;De Morgen&quot; reported on the absence of the sick judge. She had earlier been reported to be a member of the same party as Prime Minister Leterme, with her husband an acquaintance of the P.M. (the P.M has commented on the matter, denying any contact over the past few years with the husband of the judge). Her absence at giving out the ruling itself was no legal objection, but if the request of the FPIM had been honored, and deliberations had been reopened, it would have been a requirement that she was present, or that the case had been tried anew by a different set of judges, in which case any ruling would take place well after the deal with BNP Paribas was finalized. The other two judges were reported to have attempted to visit her at home, but not to have been admitted. The judge is reported to have filed a formal complaint against her two colleagues. The formal complaint, of being pressured to try to make her sign the ruling, of being harassed by phone and by an attempt to visit her at home, was quickly dismissed.
* On December 16, Modrikamen, the lawyer winning the case, changed the address-to-which-correspondence-is-to-be-addressed of his clients. Up till then, his office was the correspondence address. The change means that all further correspondence has to be mailed to each client individually (he represents over two thousand clients). Also, as some of the clients live abroad, a different set of terms now applies, as to the time in which cases have to be handled. Also, the correspondence has to be translated into the addressee&#x27;s language. As a consequence, it becomes less likely that any &#x27;third party&#x27; action to be instituted by the government will be handled this year. Also, it is reported that the FPIM had indeed appealed for a substitution of judges, but as it had done so only after the ruling, this was dismissed.
* On Wednesday December 17, before the market opened, Fortis issued a press release on its new financial position. Compared to the earlier statement, of November 14, the &quot;pro forma&quot; net equity has decreased from €7.7 billion to €6.7 billion; the third quarter results have increased from a &quot;pro forma&quot; net loss of €135 to a &quot;pro forma&quot; profit of €152 million. Trade in the share was resumed that day, but after moving up sharply at the opening (hitting €1.10) share price subsided, to close at €0.96. However, that same day the shares of BNP Paribas hit a new low (down over 17%, presumably because of exposure to the Madoff affair); share price at closing was almost exactly half of what it was at the moment the swap of shares between the Belgian government and BNP Paribas was agreed, at a fixed price.
* On December 17, Belgian Prime Minister Leterme circulated a letter he wrote on the topic of his contacts with the judiciaries dealing with the case. At the initial stage, at the Commercial Court, his staff had indeed made contacts, but only very briefly and only after a decision had been reached. At the Appeal there had indeed been direct contact between his staff and the husband of the &#x27;sick judge&#x27;, but the P.M. had been unaware of this and, upon learning of it, had taken measures against those of his staff involved. The prosecutor at the initial stage, at the Commercial Court, came forward and refuted this statement: contact had been early (just before the prosecutor would state publicly that he considered the sale to be illegitimate) and incisive (but brief, the prosecutor having broken off the phone call quickly); he stated to be prepared to testify to that effect before parliament. Parliament took the matter very seriously, the principle of the separation of powers being at risk, and instituted an investigation, entrusting the task to an existing Committee. This investigation was supported by almost all of Parliament, which was not the case for the demand that the P.M. step down, supported only by the opposition. At the end of the debate the P.M. emphasized that he took the separation of powers very seriously, had been unaware of the actions of his staff and had acted to provide clarity as soon as rumours started circulating. The first chairman of the Court of Cassation (Hof van Cassatie / Cour de cassation) gave a press conference at which he stated that he regretted that the impression had arisen of government intervention, but that there was no evidence to support that the government had actually had influenced the course of events. However, a formal investigation had been started to establish if the &#x27;sick judge&#x27; had behaved improperly. Vice-prime minister Reynders appealed for political calm: all the uproar was making it increasingly difficult for the government to sell Fortis to BNP Paribas.
* December 17, ABN AMRO let it be known that it would seek to reverse the (non-finalized) EU-forced sale by Fortis of the ABN-AMRO business activities to Deutsche Bank, the sale at which Fortis had taken a €300 million loss (see above). In response, next day the EU put on hold the integration of ABN-AMRO and Fortis Bank Nederland, until there was clarity on what would and would not belong to the company.
* December 17, a group of Dutch shareholders, united in &quot;FortisEffect&quot;, stated that as a consequence of the ruling at the Appeal it would now move against the Dutch state, a €11 billion claim being mentioned.
* Thursday December 18, BNP Paribas cancelled its Friday December 19 meeting of shareholders, which was supposed to approve the take-over of Fortis, and the issuing of extra shares to pay for it. A little later, BNP Paribas announced that this did not mean that the take-over was cancelled, but only that the time schedule had been upset.
* December 18, the Belgian newspapers were in an uproar on the theme of a violation of the principle of the separation of powers, with an advanced position taken up by Yves Desmet, who draws the conclusion that the government was aware of the gist of the ruling two days beforehand and had instituted a diversionary manoeuvre (a frivolous request by FPIM on Thursday) to derail the ruling. Early afternoon, the abovementioned first chairman of the Court of Cassation followed up with a letter to parliament, with a statement on the pressure exerted by the Belgian government on the court of appeal. Parliament was in an uproar, and a statement by the Prime Minister was announced for 17.30h; national television went into the air with a live broadcast, speculating whether only the P.M. would step back or the entire government, but no statement was actually made. The cabinet remained in a meeting until 23.30h, after which the P.M. sneaked out of the building through a backdoor. The Minister of Justice counterattacked with a letter in which he stated that contacts between the government and the judiciary were nothing out of the ordinary, as otherwise the government could not govern. In his capacity as the Minister of Justice he had indeed been called upon in the early afternoon of Friday 15, because of irregularities, and he had instructed the procureur-generaal at the court of appeal (acting as Openbaar Ministerie) to look into these. The procureur-generaal had made a request to the presiding judge to move the case to a newly composed chamber, but the request was declined, and the ruling was passed anyway. Later that evening, a letter was circulated in which the procureur-generaal at the court of appeal formulated his position on the irregularities on Friday December 15. The FPIM had made a request on Thursday, and the court had only held an informal hearing before rejecting this; instead it should have held a formal hearing and deferred the ruling until this was settled; therefore the ruling was illegitimate. The cabinet was reported to set great store by this letter. In the letter it becomes clear that the &#x27;sick judge&#x27; had started the ball rolling, after reporting sick, by an e-mail to the procureur-generaal, claiming an irregularity.
* December 18, as a result of the uncertainty that the take-over would go through, the share price of Fortis went up almost 20%, closing at €1.15. This is above the magic €1, below which a share is considered to be a penny stock.
* December 18, various representatives of shareholders, until then litigating separately, united to write a letter to the Belgian Minister of Finance. They made an appeal to all parties to sit down together and work out a solution, before year&#x27;s end, which would allow Fortis to continue as a Belgian company, and to assure as many as possible of its employees of job continuity.
* Friday December 19, early in the morning, &quot;De Standaard&quot; draws the conclusion that the Court of Cassation is convinced that the government was aware of the gist of the ruling two days beforehand and had instituted a diversionary manoeuvre (the request by FPIM on Thursday) to derail the ruling: it foresees a hefty debate in parliament. Much will depend on the requested, more detailed report by the Court of Cassation. The abovementioned commentator Yves Desmet went further and stated that the government was so poorly coordinated that it was unable to properly organize even its own downfall.
* December 19, 16.15h, the abovementioned chairman of the Court of Cassation came into parliament with a six-page letter. His conclusion was that there was no hard legal evidence of interference by the government, but that there were strong indications of it, nevertheless. He pointed out several persons as out of bounds, including the Minister of Justice and the procureur-generaal at the court of appeal, who together had taken some highly questionable actions on the afternoon of Friday December 12. As a consequence of this report, the Minister of Justice stepped down immediately. On the proposal of the Prime Minister the rest of the cabinet followed, after consulting for an hour or so. The resignation of the Leterme government, fallen over its handling of the Fortis-affair, was accepted by the King on Monday December 22. Leterme himself emphasized repeatedly that he was innocent of any interference with the law courts, and was convinced that the inquiry by parliament would clear his name, but that it was not realistic for the cabinet to continue and that he was not available for a new cabinet.
* December 19, the government won a court decision to obligate Modrikamen to continue to use his office as the one correspondence address for all his clients, thus forbidding his December 16 ploy (see above).
* Saturday December 20, &quot;De Standaard&quot; published an interview with the husband of the sick judge, &#x27;The Man Who Brought Down The Government&#x27;, in which he states that neither he nor his wife committed any breach of confidence. His wife was being consistently overworked by the Court, and Wednesday, after being abused by the presiding judge, who had yelled at her threateningly, she had come home sick, early, on the brink of a nervous breakdown. A physician who was consulted prescribed rest and forbade her to leave the house. The husband had personally gotten an e-mail from the first chairman of the court of appeal with details of the case, being pressured to get his wife to respond. On Friday the couple was visited by the police, sent by the Court, which was followed up by a visit from the presiding judge, who made further threats. He, the husband, had merely called the staff of the prime minister to protest the abuse, not to pass on information, and had merely mentioned that there was an (unspecified) dramatic turn in the case as background information.
* Tuesday December 23, an exploratory investigation into the dealings of the judiciary in this case is announced by the High Council of Justice (Conseil supérieur de la Justice / Hoge Raad voor de Justitie).

====The December 19 meeting of shareholders====

A further meeting of shareholders took place on December 19 (in Belgium only). Originally this was to decide on the question whether or not to continue Fortis, in case there was not an adequate majority on the meeting of December 2, but Fortis had announced in a press release to conform to the court-ruling and to amend the agenda of the meeting, and to decide first if the meeting wanted to decide on the matter at this time. The relevant item on the agenda was not presided over by the acting chairman of Fortis, but by the co-chairmen of the court-appointed Committee.

At the meeting, although Fortis proved to be in favor of deferring the decision, the shareholders declined to do so. A vote was taken; Fortis was to be continued. The meeting was again unruly, with recriminations commonplace. The Fortis board argued that they had not had much choice, and that if nothing had been done the Kingdom of Belgium might well have gone bankrupt (like Iceland and Hungary). They also issued a warning that a renegotiation would not necessarily result in more shareholders&#x27; value, not with the general decline of the financial markets

====Post-Leterme I developments====

After the December 19 meeting and the fall of the Leterme I government, developments continued:
* Saturday December 20, &quot;De Standaard&quot; reported that although the court had forbidden Modrikamen&#x27;s correspondence-address ploy, there would be no follow-up with a &#x27;third party&#x27; action, not while the government was in crisis.
* Monday, December 22, BNP Paribas CEO Prot stated in an interview in &quot;Les Echos&quot; that the shareholders of Fortis should not be hoping for a better bid than the one they already got, as Fortis Bank had not increased in value since October 10. Other sources point out that BNP Paribas is doing badly; share price that day passed the limit of €30, downwards, as the market assumed that if BNP Paribas cannot fortify its capital position by taking over Fortis Bank it needs to attract capital from another source.
* On Wednesday, December 24, Fortis put out a press release announcing a €300 million loss. It had bought American and British currency, for a transaction concerning the portfolio of structured credit, in anticipation of a negative court ruling. When the court did decide to act, the portfolio no longer was a concern of Fortis, which then resold the currency on December 12, at a loss. As a result, the cash position declined accordingly, and the &quot;pro forma&quot; net equity has declined from the reported €6.7 billion to €6.4 billion. Share price suffered, breaking through the magic €1 level downwards, again becoming a penny stock, closing that day at €0.95.
* On January 13, &quot;La Tribune&quot; reported that BNP Paribas was considering withdrawing its offer on Fortis Insurance Belgium. In the course of the day, a rumour circulated that the Belgium government was considering making an offer of €2.5 to 3 for the shares of Fortis Holding; in response share price went up wildly, hitting an intraday high of €1.68. The rumour was promptly denied. The same day, Fortis confirmed a report of the previous day in &quot;Het Financieele Dagblad&quot; that although dual meetings are to be held in February, only the meeting in Brussels would be allowed to vote on the sales as only under Belgian law was there a court ruling requiring this. In response, Euroshareholders took this decision to court (in Amsterdam).
* January 14, Fortis Bank announced it would discontinue its 90 Fortis Finanz shops in Germany, which it had started since 2006. The lawyer Modrikamen announced his intention to file his court case next week (as opposed from the preliminary injunctions which constituted his court dealings so far), contesting both the September and October sales, hoping to retain Fortis as an independent Belgian Bank. In case the court declines to reverse the sales, he is claiming damages: €4 + 1 per share from the Dutch government plus €3 + 1 per share from the Belgian government and BNP Paribas.
* On January 15, Fortis MeesPierson (now the property of the Dutch government) announced to change its name to MeesPierson.
* On January 20, a lawyer announced the start of a Dutch-language court procedure in Brussels, to parallel the French-language procedure by Modrikamen. The sole purpose was to claim damages. Also on January 20, the Belgian Minister of Finance confirmed that a second round of financial support was being prepared, which would be of a general nature, so as to avoid a case-by-case approach. It was rumoured that the Belgian government considered erecting a Belgian &quot;bad bank&quot; which would take care of all toxic credits held by Belgian banks. In response, it was rumoured (in &quot;De Morgen&quot;) that new action by the Belgian government would lead to a demotion of the credit rating of the Belgian state (now AA+).
* On January 21, &quot;Het Financieele Dagblad&quot; published an interview with Fortis-CEO Karel De Boeck, in which he states that he feels the Dutch Government paid too little for the Dutch parts. He states his preparedness, provided that the court-appointed Belgian committee bears this out in their report, due the following week, to go to court over this, on behalf of Fortis.
* On January 27, the preliminary report of the court-appointed committee of five Belgian experts (dated January 26) was published on the website of Fortis. This report is for the benefit of the meeting of shareholders, on February 11. They advise the shareholders to approve the sales, as Fortis was in real trouble and the sales provide a realistic solution at a not-unreasonable price. An exception is made for CASHES, involving the portfolio of toxic credits, which in its present form provides an unreasonable advantage to BNP Paribas: this requires re-negotiation. Also they recommend a scenario wherein a quarter of Fortis Bank (now scheduled to remain with the Belgian government) and a quarter of Fortis Insurance Belgium would be returned to Fortis Holding.
* On January 28, Fortis confirmed that it had reopened negotiations with the Belgian government and BNP Paribas, based on the report of the five Belgian experts The VEB announced it would be suing the Dutch government for damages.
* On January 29, &quot;De Tijd&quot; reported to expect a result from the renegotiations that day, with the prime minister due to leave early the day after for Davos and the February 11 meeting coming up. Also, it is reported a special insurance is agreed on for members of the Fortis board of directors, against damage claims: this applies only to those who are new or recently dismissed (it includes Verwilst). Also, their salaries are being reconsidered, it being proposed to reduce them to a level comparable to other banks.
* On January 30 it was made known that the renegotiations had been concluded. Trade in the shares was suspended for the day, to resume on Monday. The suggestion to bring back a quarter of Fortis Bank into Fortis had been declined by the negotiators from Fortis, as they regarded this as an unpromising way to generate more value, Fortis electing to become a pure insurance company instead. Essentially, the new deal confirms the &quot;status quo&quot; as it exists since December 12 (the Dutch parts being owned by the Dutch government, Fortis Bank and the portfolio of toxic credits being owned by the Belgian government, with plans to sell 75% of Fortis Bank to BNP Paribas, and with Fortis holding Fortis Insurance International and Fortis Insurance Belgium). What has changed is that 10% of Fortis Insurance Belgium is sold to BNP Paribas and that Fortis is going to buy circa 30% of the portfolio of toxic credits, but at better conditions than agreed on in October (when Fortis was going to buy 66%, and renegotiations had been forced on October 8). A minor sweetener is that any profits made on shares of BNP Paribas (starting from the purchase price at €68) will also be assigned to Fortis (this does not include any dividends which will be kept by the Belgian government): this replaces the special plan for the long-time small shareholders (see above). Lawyer Modrikamen announced that his clients will vote against the sales, even at the new conditions. The Belgian Minister of Finance Reynders regrets Modrikamen taking this position, rejecting the new deal so quickly. He sees the new deal as a great improvement, as it also gives a job guarantee to Belgian employees and guarantees that Brussels will remain a financial centre. The new deal has been approved by all the directors of the board of Fortis, with the exception of the representative of Ping An, who has reserved judgement (Ping An holds 5% of the shares, see above).
* In an analysis of January 31, &quot;De Standaard&quot; reported that in the three-party negotiations, BNP Paribas refused to budge even slightly, not yielding anything. The only change for BNP Paribas is that it did not buy 100% of Fortis Insurance Belgium, but only 10%, saving the outlay of cash (some €5 billion). On Friday, January 30, the share price of BNP Paribas edged up slightly when the deal became known, passing the €30 limit upward.
* February 1, &quot;De Tijd&quot; made a calculation based on the Addendum to the Circular, coming up with a value of €2.76 per share, by dividing the &quot;pro forma&quot; equity (as published by Fortis on January 30) by the number of dividend-paying shares. This is down from the &quot;pro forma&quot; value as of October, but based on different assets: the October value was based mostly on 66% of the portfolio of toxic credits, while the January 30 figure is based on 90% of Fortis Insurance Belgium and 30% of the portfolio of toxic credits. Also, on this day Fortis put out a press release announcing that the representative of Ping An stepped back from the board of Fortis: he will not be replaced.
* February 2, it is reported that the Belgian government is engaged in a campaign to convince shareholders to accept the new deal of January 30, as the utmost that can be achieved. The message is that if the shareholders turn this down the sales as agreed in October will be carried through regardless, and the shareholders will have to make do with the 66% share in the portfolio of toxic credits.
* February 3, Minister of Finance Reynders confirmed that the Belgian government has opened negotiations with the Chinese government, concerning the earlier claim of €2 billion compensation for Ping An. When asked, he emphasized that there were no direct contacts with Ping An, so as to avoid the impression of a preferential treatment of Ping An over other shareholders. In a four-page open letter Modrikamen took up position against the campaign of the Belgian government to put pressure on the shareholders. He listed reasons for the shareholders to vote against.
* February 5, &quot;De Standaard&quot; reports a rising confusion among shareholders as to what exactly will be voted on at the upcoming February 11 meeting, and what the consequences of the vote would be. Consequences of rejecting the sales remain uncertain. As a result of the uncertainty share price closed below €1.40 on Wednesday (from an intraday high of over €1.80 early on Monday). A lawyer acting for Fortis explained (later in the day followed up by a Q&amp;A published on the Fortis site) that indeed a vote in favor would approve the January 30 deal, but a vote against would reject the October sales. In the latter case the January 30 deal would be annulled, as the contract provides for this, but for the October sales the existing contracts would remain in force, even if they have become illegitimate: further negotiations or litigation would be required to resolve the situation. However, Fortis does not have the cash to buy back Fortis Bank, so this would remain with the Belgian State. Others point out that it remains unclear if Fortis is legally allowed to change the agenda in this fashion. There is also the minor point that the December 12 court decision allows only the shareholders holding shares on October 14 to vote on the approval of the October sales: can the January 30 deal, affecting all current shareholders, but not known and thus not included by the court, be decided on by only a part of the shareholders present at the meeting?. Also, the Deutsche Bank lets it be known that it remains interested in buying the business activities of ABN AMRO which it bought earlier from Fortis (forced to sell by the EU, see above), a sale which had later been blocked by the authorities, with the new Dutch-owned ABN-AMRO interested in keeping them/buying them back (see entry of December 17, above).
* February 6, the Belgian government has guaranteed the Chinese government that a vote in favor by Ping An on February 11 will not have any legal effect in the matter of the claim for damages by Ping An, under the treaty between the Belgian and Chinese government (see above). However, there is no agreement that any such damages are due. In response, Modrikamen demanded further information on this agreement and threatened to move to exclude Ping An from the right to vote on February 11. Also on this day, an independent agency warned that the January 30 deal is very unclear on the matter of CASHES, and that it is not possible at this stage to estimate how much this will cost Fortis.
* February 7 saw the publication of an interview with Prot, the CEO of BNP Paribas, in which he appealed to the shareholders to take their responsibility: with Fortis Bank as part of BNP Paribas the process of supplying credit to Belgian companies would be much smoother. Also, BNP Paribas did not have any plans to let go of employees of Fortis Bank. Also on this day, &quot;De Tijd&quot; reports that Fortis Bank has finally realized that there is the possibility that shareholders will vote against the sales and are drawing up a plan B over the weekend. This will be submitted for approval to the board by Tuesday February 10 or Wednesday February 11. The court decision of December 12 has ordered BNP Paribas to supply credit to Fortis Bank up to February 16. If the shareholders in their February 11 meeting disapprove of the sales, BNP Paribas could withdraw from the sale and an alternate way of supplying credit would be required. There is a daily need for some €30 to 40 billion credit, with the Belgian state, in the case of an emergency, able to provide up to €150 billion. Also there is the matter of assuring the clients of Fortis Bank of the continuity of the company, so as to avoid a run on the bank. &quot;De Standaard&quot; counters this: there is no special activity at Fortis Bank this weekend, work on the plan B started weeks ago. Also there is no need for liquidity support: BNP Paribas still is ready to provide support, but at the moment it is not needed. Furthermore, it was announced that the Dutch-language court action (announced on January 20) has been started; the initial court-session is scheduled for February 20.
* February 8, Ping An (holding some 5% of Fortis shares) announced that it will vote against the sales, at the February 11 meeting. Modrikamen expects that this assures there is a majority against the sales: he represents some 10% of the shares, Ping An has 5% and typically only 25% of the capital is represented at a meeting of shareholders. &quot;De Tijd&quot; reports that the Belgian government has decided that in case the meeting of shareholders rejects the sales, it will cancel the €3 billion loan that Fortis needed to fund its share in the portfolio of toxic credits. It is thought that this will create liquidity problems for Fortis, and that the Belgian state will perforce get ownership of both Fortis Bank and Fortis Insurance Belgium, thus the shareholders had better vote in favor, in which case they will have at least the insurance company. &quot;Het Financieele Dagblad&quot; agrees with Modrikamen: the meeting will vote against, in which case BNP Paribas will withdraw (as indicated by Prot in the interview of February 7). The Belgian Prime Minister has announced yet another renegotiated deal (drawn up in response to the news of Ping An), which will be submitted to the meeting of shareholders.
* Monday February 9, the Dutch Ondernemingskamer denied the request from Euroshareholders to force Fortis to also allow the February 13 meeting (at Utrecht) to vote on the sales. In an analysis by &quot;De Standaard&quot; it is pointed out that the campaign by the Belgian government to scare the shareholders into voting in favor is not without risk. It creates the spectre of Fortis Bank being in trouble, and this may affect the image of the bank, just now when Fortis Bank is doing well (with liquidity problems a thing of the past). What is actually at stake is the creditability of the Belgian government, especially financially; it may need to pick up the tab, and the more it scares financiers, the higher the interests they will demand. Nevertheless, the government appears committed to a policy of punishing the shareholders (for not supervising the board of Fortis or for speculating by buying Fortis shares) and protecting the customers.
* February 10, &quot;Het Financieele Dagblad&quot; published an interview with Hessels, acting chairman of the board of Fortis, in which he states that a vote against the sales would result in the bankruptcy of Fortis. The October contracts that Fortis has engaged in, dictated by the Belgian government, result in an immediate €2,3 billion deficit. These contracts may be, or become, illegitimate (if they are not approved by the shareholders), but it may take a very long time to resolve the legal maze. By executing the existing contracts the Belgian government can force Fortis into immediate bankruptcy. A vote in favor of the January 30 deal will provide immediate clarity, and an assured future as an insurance company, as then the Belgian government will assume financial responsibility for much of the worst problems. This is also the point of view of the Belgian Minister of Finance: a vote against may leave the shareholders empty-handed. This threat worked on the VEB, which like the VFB and Dolor, announced to vote in favor of the January 30 deal. However, it is going to vote against the sale to the Dutch government, still hoping for a better deal there. It is reported that Modrikamen represents 2400 shareholders, holding 0.6% of the capital. An initiative of Fortis employees by the name of &quot;Fortis Front&quot; announced they too represent 2400 shareholders: they will vote in favor of the January 30 deal. An independent agency (the same as above) has held a survey among leaders of industry and science: they favor a standalone scenario for Fortis Bank. More than half of those questioned indicate they don&#x27;t have enough information on either the January 30 deal or on what will happen if the meeting votes against the sales. Trade in the share is suspended on February 11, until Fortis publishes the results of the meeting.
* February 11, it was reported that the Belgian government tried to get the right to vote the 125 million Fortis shares issued in October in connection with the CASHES, without the right to vote (voting rights are suspended until the CASHES are paid for). These shares are held by Fortis Bank. Lawyers that were consulted responded negatively, but the government nevertheless appealed to the board of Fortis on Wednesday afternoon; the request tied up the board for hours. &quot;Het Financieele Dagblad&quot; reports that Hessels, acting chairman of the board of Fortis, expects additional payments from the Dutch government: it concerns €2 billion worth of convertible bonds, which are due to be converted in 2010 into Fortis&#x27;s shares at a fixed price of €18.74 per share. At the current share price, this would represent €160 million worth of shares, but the implementation of the contract is not straightforward, as shares of Fortis Bank Nederland are involved. At the time the contract was drawn up, that was a non-issue as Fortis Bank held all the shares of Fortis Bank Nederland, but it is less clear now.

====February 11 (and 13) meetings of shareholders====
On January 16, the Belgian Official Journal published the agenda for the February 11 (and 13) meeting of shareholders. At the February 11 meeting in Brussels, the shareholders may approve or disapprove three decisions:
* the sale on October 3 to the Dutch
* the sale on October 10 of the remaining half of Fortis Bank to the Belgian government
* the transactions with BNP Paribas, both the sale by Fortis of Fortis Insurance Belgium and the sale by the Belgian government of 75% of Fortis Bank.
In addition there is a vote on the composition of the Board of Directors, with especially the candidacy of Georges Ugeux noteworthy, being the candidate put forward by the small shareholders to lead the renewed Fortis back into the black. At the February 13 meeting in Utrecht, the shareholders may vote only on the composition of the Board of Directors and on an alteration of the Articles of Association. If less than 50% of the capital is represented at the meeting this last item will not be put to the vote, but another meeting will be organized within four weeks.

The Shareholder Circular for the February 11 meeting was published on January 30: it was dated January 29, but its publication was delayed pending the renegotiations (see above). At the time of publication the Circular had not been adjusted for the result of the renegotiations, but this is expected to be done shortly. In the circular it is explained that the shareholders are allowed to vote against the sales, but that this will not necessarily result in stopping the sales, as binding contracts exist. Fortis announced that it is unable to alter the agenda of the meeting.

On January 31, Fortis published an addendum to the Circular, giving the details of the January 30-deal. According to the Addendum, the court-appointed Committee of five Belgian experts has been informed of the results of the renegotiations; they agree that the results are in line with their recommendations (laid down in the report published on January 27) and the Committee recommends that the shareholders vote in favor. Fortis feels that an alteration of the agenda is unnecessary: a vote in favor is a vote in favor of the amended deal. On February 5, this was followed up with a simplified Q&amp;A, setting out the basic options to be voted on.

Some 7000 shareholders registered, and some 5000 (which would be a record for Belgium) were physically present; in addition there were some 120 (to 180?) reporters., with some 20 television crews. The start of the meeting was grim, with security out in force. A shareholder was ejected five minutes after the opening of the meeting. At the meeting, 20.32% of the capital was represented: this did not include the 125 million non-voting shares held by Fortis Bank. The board offered to allow the meeting to decide on letting these shares vote, but the meeting rejected adding this to the agenda. Finally, Fortis Bank withdrew the request. By that time, the atmosphere had considerably worsened. The meeting went to a vote on 15.16h and quickly rejected the sales. The vote in favor of selling to the Dutch government was 42.99%; the vote in favor of selling to the Belgian government was 49.74%. After rejecting the sales, the meeting went on to vote on the appointments to the board: three of the candidates withdrew (because of the vote on the sales). Of the others, Jozef De Mey, Georges Ugeux and Jan Zegering Hadders were voted in, with only the candidacy of Ugeux being close (56.75%); their appointment requiring confirmation by the February 13 meeting in Utrecht.

&quot;Het Financieele Dagblad&quot; reports that the Dutch ABP, holding 50 million shares, abstained (the difference between the vote in favor and against was a little over 2 million shares). After unsuccessful attempts to negotiate with the Belgian government and BNP Paribas, it found it could not vote in favor, as the sale of Fortis Bank had clearly been for too low a price; it could not vote against as it was completely unclear what would happen with Fortis if it did vote against.

The February 13 meeting was uneventful, with only a few hundred participants. It confirmed the three appointments to the board. When it became clear that Ugeux would not become chairman, he stepped down.

====Response to the February 11 meeting====

Immediately following the February 11 meeting the main participants emphasized maintaining their earlier point of view; also that the customers of Fortis Bank had nothing to worry about. Core members of cabinet held a two-hour meeting, with no decision published. BNP Paribas announced it will keep to the existing contract until it expires, February 28; and if a takeover of Fortis Bank can be realized quickly it will proceed to do so anyway. BNP Paribas put the blame on Ping An. Many others put the blame on the government&#x27;s attempt to vote the 125 million non-voting shares, which created a furor of protest. Pre-meeting analyses suggested that a majority was inclined to vote in favor, and that only a small extra gesture by the government (such as bringing into Fortis any increase in value over the purchase price of the 25% of Fortis Bank held by the government) would have assured victory; instead the government went the other way. An analyst assumes the government made the effort in anticipation of a lawsuit by BNP Paribas, to establish that it had left no stone unturned.

The opposition parties represented in Belgian parliament stated that this established that the Belgian government was now proven to have failed totally; it demanded that the cabinet, or at least the Minister of Finance Reynders, should step down.

The CEO of Fortis Bank, Dierckx, stated that the bank was doing well with no immediate solvency or liquidity problems. Over 2008 the bank had realized an underlying profit of €1.2 billion, although one-time write-offs caused a different end-total. Under normal circumstances the bank will bring in €1.7 billion a year.

A key issue to the immediate future of Fortis is the portfolio of toxic credits, with De Boeck taking the position that there is an existing contract, resulting in an immediately imminent bankruptcy of Fortis, while the newly elected Ugeux arguing that the portfolio belongs to Fortis Bank and was split off only after (and as part of) the now illegitimate sale of Fortis Bank to the Belgian government: for the immediate future it is the worry of the Belgian government, and Fortis is doing fine.

====After the February 11 meeting====

Thursday February 12, trade in the share was resumed, opening at €1.10 (and closing at €1.11), down from the €1.32 close on Tuesday. It is announced that the Belgian government will meet with representatives of the Dutch, French and Luxembourg governments, as well as of BNP Paribas and Fortis. A joint press conference by the Belgian and French Prime Ministers will follow. In parliament the Prime Minister was engaged in a fierce defence, particularly in the matter of the attempt to vote the 125 million non-voting shares. He emphasized that the government had inquired into the matter, but that the actual push to have the meeting approve this was done by Fortis Bank, not by the government. All the opposition parties demanded that the Minister of Finance step down. Modrikamen achieved an additional victory in court: he was allowed to change the correspondence address of all the shareholders he represented to their individual addresses (as he did on December 16). A Dutch lawyer requested an injunction against the Dutch state: as the sale of the Dutch parts of Fortis is now illegitimate, any further actions concerning these parts any further actions should be frozen, pending the renegotiations and court actions.

* Following the meetings, on Saturday 14 February, Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s lowered the credit rating of Fortis holding substantially, which will make it harder for the company to attract credit.

* February 17, in a meeting with the trade unions, the Belgian Prime Minister let it be known that the Belgian government is investigating two options for Fortis Bank: 1) a take-over by BNP Paribas or 2) a stand-alone scenario.

* February 18, the new chairman of the board of Fortis, De Mey, announced that he would fight for every cent, and that his first priority was the renegotiations with the Belgian government and BNP Paribas. Later that day, after a meeting with newly elected members of the Fortis board, it was reported that the Belgian Prime Minister had succeeded in convincing them to continue negotiations with BNP Paribas.
* February 20, the new CEO of ABN-AMRO, Zalm, let it be known he is aiming to sell the Dutch business activities of Fortis back to Fortis Bank, in exchange for some other activities (presumably ex-ABN AMRO parts). Thus he hopes to comply with EU-provisions on market share, even if ABN-AMRO holds on to the business activities that previously were scheduled to be sold to Deutsche Bank. This was followed immediately by a protest of representatives of the trade unions on behalf of the employees of Fortis Bank Nederland, who felt excluded from the new company.
* February 23, Fortis dismantles the Foundation that ensured it could not be taken over by a hostile party buying itself large amounts of stock.
* February 24, &quot;De Tijd&quot; reports that a rumor is circulating that if Fortis Bank remains independent (the &#x27;stand alone&#x27; scenario) this will cost 5500 jobs within 3 years. Earlier it had been reported that a take-over by BNP Paribas would cost 3000 jobs. The renegotiations between the Belgian government, Fortis and BNP Paribas, started on Friday, dragged on, but it was announced that a break would be taken, and talks would not resume that evening.
* February 27, it was announced that the deadline for a deal with BNP Paribas had been moved up a week from the original February 28 date. The deal being negotiated reportedly resembled the January 30 deal but features BNP Paribas taking a 25% interest in Fortis Insurance Belgium.
* March 1, the Belgian Prime Minister commented in a television programme that the Belgian government was prepared to nationalize Fortis Bank outright, if the deal with BNP Paribas fell through. However, he was optimistic that a viable deal was being negotiated.
* March 4, it is reported that after the fall of LeTerme I, the new Minister of Justice, De Clerck had been asked to overturn the December 12 court decision: he refused. His predecessor vanDeurzen had been exposed to extreme pressure, it even being suggested that he step aside temporarily, transferring his powers to a more willing Minister who would then do what was expedient; he stepped down altogether.
* March 5, Fortis Bank announces that the loss over the fourth quarter is over €1 billion higher than expected, making for a loss of €20 billion over 2008.
* March 7, after a week filled with rumours, posturing, proposals and counterproposals, it was announced that the talks started on February 21 had been successfully concluded and a new deal had been reached. This is almost exactly the same as the January 30 deal, except that Fortis is not selling 10% of Fortis Insurance Belgium to BNP Paribas but 25% to Fortis Bank (financed by BNP Paribas). The new deal is subject to shareholder approval, with meetings in April (April 8 and 9 being suggested). Part of the deal is that there is the option that the government may provide extra funds to Fortis Bank, if needed, up to €2 billion, in exchange for shares, up to a 49.9% stake in the company.
* March 10, the Belgian government is reported to anticipate that Fortis Bank will indeed require the extra funds, this year. After visiting Ping An, Chairman De Mey of the Fortis Holding reports that Ping An has not yet decided if it approves of the new deal. The other parties have mostly not changed their earlier position, but the pre-October 14 shareholders hold only 22% and BNP Paribas expects a landslide victory among the &#x27;new&#x27; shareholders.
* March 13, it is announced that the next meeting of shareholders (April 8 and 9) can decide on five new directors proposed for the board. Acting on behalf of shareholders, the Dutch FortisEffect has started its court action against the Dutch and Belgian governments, Fortis and Fortis Bank Nederland, with a trial date hopefully in May.
* March 15, Fortis made two announcements. Firstly its loss over 2008 is expected to be €22.5 billion (up from an earlier projected loss of €20 billion) and that it won&#x27;t pay out a dividend; the latter has consequences for the CASHES and FRESH, and Fortis expects to issue extra shares, some time in the future. Secondly, that the memorandum of understanding with Ping An has expired last Friday; this means among other things that Ping An is free to sell its Fortis shares. It is also apparent that Fortis has changed the address of its website from www.fortis.com to www.holding.fortis.com.
* March 16, in an interview, Fortis CEO De Boeck indicates that Fortis is aiming to be an insurance company only, and not a small one (it has an annual income of €12 billion now); it aims to expand. However, within two years it will no longer be called Fortis (as that name has been sold).
* March 20, Fortis let it be known that in the following week further negotiations will take place with Fortis Bank and BNP Paribas, concerning the portfolio of structured credits and the way it will be financed.
* March 26, Fortis Bank Nederland announced a loss of €18.5 billion from 2008 (separate from the €22.5 billion loss projected by its former mother-company Fortis), mostly because of a €17.7 billion write-off on ABN-AMRO; it booked an operational profit of €0.6 billion (excluding write-offs). As the court is now obliged to address its mail to all the (circa 2400) shareholders represented by Modrikamen separately, it checked all the addresses and came up with several dozen errors, including two persons who are deceased. Responding to a rumor (by Modrikamen) that it had bought up to 9% of the Fortis shares, so as to vote on the upcoming meeting of shareholders, BNP Baribas let it be known that it controlled 0.35% voting shares (directly and indirectly) and that daughter-companies held a further 0.23%, which however it did not control, as they would vote independently.
* March 31, Fortis announced its definite result for 2008, a loss of €28 billion (up from the projection of a loss of €22.5 billion of March 15). The insurance activities did make an operational profit of €6 million. Later the same day, the court of appeal at Brussels ruled in favor of Modrikamen so that at the April 8 and 9 meetings of shareholders the vote on the take-over would be restricted to those who held shares on October 14, that is the same who could vote on February 11.
* April 1, as a result of the court ruling, Fortis expects to defer either the meetings or the decision on the take-over.
* April 2, ASR Insurance, formerly the Dutch branch of Fortis insurance, reports a loss over 2008 of €640 million. Fortis confirms that the new vote on the takeover will be moved to April 28 and 29.
* April 8, the European Commission, the executive branch of the European Union, announces that it will look into the take-over to see if the Dutch government has given any undue advantage to those parts that it took over, providing an undue competitive edge prohibited by European law.
* April 10, the appeal by Fortis, on the grounds of the third-party rule, against the decision to restrict voting on the take-over to those who held shares on October 14 was granted. In addition the request to add the stand-alone scenario for Fortis Bank to the agenda of the meeting was denied.

====The April 28 and 29 meetings====
On the eve of the April 28 meeting Modrikamen sought an injunction to exclude 170 million shares from voting; these were registered on the Cayman Islands and looked fishy. The Court denied this. The April 28 meeting, in Ghent, was attended by some 3000 shareholders; Modrikamen personally held a speech that led to the board being pelted with shoes and coins. The meeting was adjourned and remained boisterous after being resumed. In the end the sale was approved by some 73%. In contrast the April 29 meeting, in Utrecht, was calm, being attended by some 300 shareholders (who did represent more of the capital than the 3000 in Ghent); here too the issue of the 170 million shares was raised and this meeting also approved the sale, by some 78%.

====After the April 28 and 29 meetings====
* On May 12, the EU decided that the take-over by Belgium and Luxembourg was not counter to EU-regulations.
* May 13, at its meeting of shareholders, BNP Paribas reported that Fortis Bank has lost 10% of its deposits over the past six months.
* May 14, Fortis reports a €44 million profit over the first quarter. In a book announced to appear on May 16 (&quot;Bankroet. Hoe Fortis al zijn krediet verspeelde&quot;) it is revealed that, after the first, September rescue, Hessels personally informed the Dutch government about the Belgian government securing the Dutch insurance company as collateral. This served as a pretext, if not a reason, for the Dutch government to renegotiate, resulting in the break-up.

===Later developments===

On July 13, 2018, the Amsterdam Court of Appeal (Gerechtshof Amsterdam) approved a €1.3 billion collective settlement of claims asserted on behalf of shareholders of the former Fortis (now Ageas), under the authority of the Dutch Act on Collective Settlement of Mass Claims (Wet Collectieve Afwikkeling van Massaschade) or WCAM.

On December 20, 2018, the prosecutor decided to drop the case against seven former directors. The prosecution argued that it found insufficient evidence that they knowingly misled shareholders with over-optimistic company information.

<doc id="1313033" wikidata="Q1443047" url="?curid=1313033" title="Frank Calder (politician)">
<text>Frank Arthur Calder, (August 3, 1915 – November 4, 2006) was a Nisga&#x27;a politician in Canada.

Born in Nass Harbour, British Columbia, Calder was the first indigenous person to graduate from the Anglican Theological College of the University of British Columbia. Calder was a hereditary chief of the House of Wisinxbiltkw from the Killerwhale Tribe. He died November 4, 2006, at an assisted-living home in Victoria from the effects of cancer and recent abdominal surgery.

==Political career==

In the 1949 British Columbia election, Calder was elected to the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia. He was elected in the riding of Atlin where he continued to serve until 1956 and then again between 1960 and 1979. Calder represented British Columbia&#x27;s Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (which later became the New Democratic Party of British Columbia).

Calder was appointed a cabinet member in Dave Barrett&#x27;s government in 1972 and became the first aboriginal cabinet minister in British Columbia (BC). In 1973, police found him in a consensual situation involving a female companion, alcohol and a car parked in an intersection. He was arrested but not charged and was fired from cabinet. In 1974, he was defeated by Joseph Gosnell in his bid to be re-elected as president of the Nisga&#x27;a Tribal Council.

In 1975, Calder crossed the floor to join the Social Credit Party of British Columbia and was re-elected. In 1979, however, Calder lost his seat to the NDP candidate, Al Passarell, by a single vote. Calder and his wife had both neglected to vote.

==Fighting for treaty rights==

Calder is known for the court case titled &quot;Calder v British Columbia (AG)&quot;, which was argued by Thomas Berger. By appealing the case all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada, Calder established that Aboriginal title exists in modern Canadian law. This decision had national and international reverberations. In addition, it was the basis of BC&#x27;s Nisga&#x27;a Treaty.

Before the Calder case, there was no clear process for negotiating Canadian land claim settlements. Calder clarified which lands were negotiable (40% of Canada&#x27;s land mass) and which were not. After the case, Canada developed a land claim policy to guide negotiations. Calder continued to fight for Nisga&#x27;a&#x27;s treaty rights as recently as 2000.

Calder founded the Nisga&#x27;a Tribal Council, the first tribal council established in BC. Calder was its president for 21 years until 1974.

==Honours==
* 1987 – Made an Officer of the Order of Canada
* Awarded the Aboriginal Order of Canada
* 1996 – National Aboriginal Achievement Award
* 2004 – Awarded the Order of British Columbia

<text>James LeVoy Sorenson (July 30, 1921 – January 20, 2008) was an American businessman, the founder of Sorenson Companies, a parent company of 32 corporations. A noted philanthropist, he was the richest man in Utah with an estimated net worth of $4.5 billion at the time of his death. He donated his entire personal fortune to charity.

== Early life ==
Sorenson was born in Rexburg, Idaho, the son of Joseph LeVoy and Emma Blaser Sorenson, and was of Swedish, Norwegian and Swiss ancestry.

==Career==
With only a high school diploma, he made a fortune in local real estate before expanding in other directions such as innovative technology. Sorenson holds roughly 60 patents, and is credited with a number of medical inventions including the disposable surgical mask and the disposable venous catheter.

One of his companies, Sorenson Genomics, has also begun a genetic database known as the Sorenson Molecular Genealogy Foundation, and claims to be the only laboratory in the world to have successfully identified victims in Thailand of the 2004 tsunami.

In 1982, Sorenson received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

In 2003, Sorenson was honored as the &quot;Alumnus of the Year&quot; by Sierra College in Rocklin, California, which he attended from 1940 to 1941. His pre-med studies were interrupted by World War II and a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

On Wednesday, February 15, 2006, Sorenson received the &quot;Giant of Our City&quot; award in Salt Lake City for his philanthropy and effort in identifying the tsunami victims.

Upon his death, Sorenson donated his entire personal fortune to charity.

==Personal life==
He was married to Beverley Taylor Sorenson, a great granddaughter of LDS Church President John Taylor. They had eight children — Carol Smith, Shauna Johnson, James Lee Sorenson, Ann Crocker, Joan Fenton, Joseph Sorenson, Gail Williamsen and Christine Harris.

Sorenson died on January 20, 2008, of cancer, aged 86. He was survived by a large extended family, including his wife, eight children and 47 grandchildren.

<doc id="1313055" wikidata="Q963772" url="?curid=1313055" title="Philippine National Police">
<text>The Philippine National Police (PNP; ) is the national police force of the Philippines. Its national headquarters is located at Camp Crame in Bagong Lipunan ng Crame, Quezon City. Currently, it has approximately 228,000 personnel to police a population in excess of 100 million.

The agency is administered and controlled by the National Police Commission and is part of the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG). Local police officers are operationally controlled by city or municipal mayors. DILG, on the other hand, organizes, trains and equips the PNP for the performance of police functions as a police force that is national in scope and civilian in character.

The PNP was formed on January 29, 1991, when the Philippine Constabulary and the Integrated National Police were merged pursuant to Republic Act 6975 of 1990.

==History==
=== Creation after martial law ===
Until January 1991, the Philippines did not have a civilian national police force, and instead had the Philippine Constabulary under the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and city and municipal police organized under the Integrated National Police, which was likewise nationalized and integrated under the command of the military under martial law in 1975.

The need to assert civilian control of the military was a reform agenda which began being addressed almost as soon as Ferdinand Marcos was deposed by the 1986 People Power Revolution; within a year of Marcos&#x27; ouster, the 1987 Constitution of the Philippines enshrined the principle of civilian supremacy over the military. This was because of broad local and international consensus that &quot;human rights abuses became rampant&quot; during the dictatorship, with Philippine Constabulary units such as the Metrocom Intelligence and Security Group (MISG), and the 5th Constabulary Security Unit (5CSU), identified with many particular cases. These units had also been associated with acts of intimidation and violence media entities, corporate management, and opposition groups.

The recommendations of the Davide Commission in 1990 thus included the dissolution of the Philippine Constabulary as a service under the AFP. It was determined that a new civilian Philippine National Police was to be formed by merging the Integrated National Police into the Philippine Constabulary, with the PC forming the basis as it had the more developed infrastructure. The PC was then removed from the Ministry of National Defense and eventually civilianized, as part of the Department of the Interior and Local Government, through attrition and recruitment of new personnel.

Passed on December 13, 1990, &quot;Republic Act No. 6975&quot;, the Department of the Interior and Local Government Act of 1990 paved the way for a new era for Philippine law enforcement as the law ordered the total merger of both the Philippine Constabulary and the Integrated National Police and formally created the Philippine National Police.

=== Later reforms and reorganization===
&quot;R.A. 6975&quot; was further amended by &quot;R.A. 8551&quot;, the Philippine National Police Reform and Reorganization Act of 1998, and by &quot;R.A. 9708&quot;.

&quot;R.A. 8551&quot; envisioned the PNP to be a community- and service-oriented agency and included the creation of the Internal Affairs Service of Philippine National Police.

On June 14, 2019, the PNP announced that the Counter-Intelligence Task Force will be replaced with the Integrity Monitoring and Enforcement Group.

===Philippine National Police Academy===
The Philippine National Police Academy is located at Camp Gen. Mariano N. Castaneda, Silang, Cavite and is the premier training academy for the Philippine National Police, Bureau of Jail Management &amp; Penology and Bureau of Fire Protection.

== Rank structure ==
=== Full set of ranks ===
Per the current (2019) rank system, the National Police has no rank holders of Second Lieutenant, Technical Sergeant, Sergeant and Patrolman First Class.
==Officers==

===Recruitment and training===
The PNP conducts regular recruitment programs, depending on the annual budget. The entry level for non-commissioned officers is the rank of Police Patrolman (for male recruits) or Police Patrolwoman (for female recruits). The new recruits will undergo Public Safety Basic Recruit Course for six months, and a Field Training Program for another six months. Prior to their actual duty, they are required to undergo the mandatory special training of PNP BISOC or PNP Basic Internal Security Operations Course for 45 days to 5 months to enhance them in militaristic/tactics for future assignment in the field whether in the Striking Force or in the Police Station.

Commissioned officers for the Philippine National Police are from the Philippine National Police Academy as well as through &quot;lateral entry&quot; for specialized disciplines and requirements such as criminologists in line-officers, lawyers, doctors, engineers, chaplain and other technical positions and also the rose-from-the-rank personnel who have reached the qualifications to be a commissioned officer.

A police officer has to two ways for retirement i.e. Optional and Mandatory Retirement. Optional Retirement is an option of an uniformed personnel to retire who rendered at least 20 years retire from the service, while the latter is when they reach the mandatory retirement age of 56. Any officer may opt to go on non-duty status at most three months before the date when they reach the mandatory retirement age so they could prepare the pertinent documents for their retirement (some called it Terminal Leave). While on this status they are still considered as part of the police force and retain their ranking.

== Equipment ==
== Reforms ==
The PNP is one of the &quot;core security actors&quot; that are the focus of security sector governance and reform in the Philippines, which involves civilianizing, professionalizing, modernizing, and capacitating the Philippine government&#x27;s security institutions to align them good governance and to principles such as human rights, freedom of information, and the rule of civilian law. This has been a continuing process since the establishment of the Fifth Philippine Republic after the 1986 People Power Revolution, before the concept had even been fully defined internationally in the 1990s. The creation of the PNP itself, merging and replacing the PC and the INP, was an early and major step towards civilianization of the Philippine security sector.

==Controversies==
===Kuratong Baleleng rubout===
===Manila blackmail incident===

A blackmail case occurred in Binondo, Manila when police officers abducted and blackmailed seven Chinese citizens suspected of drug trafficking on December 30, 1998. After many months of detainment and torture, two Hong Kong residents were killed when the ransom money was not paid. One police superintendent who knew of the operation was also killed.

===Euro Generals scandal===

The Euro Generals scandal involves Eliseo de la Paz and several Philippine National Police officials who went to Russia in October 2008 to attend an Interpol conference. De la Paz was detained for carrying a large sum of undeclared money. A House panel investigating the scandal concluded that the six police officials who attended the conference had made the trip without authorization. In 2010, the Office of the Ombudsman filed graft charges against twelve former and active ranking PNP officials for their alleged involvement in the incident.

===Parañaque shootout===

On December 5, 2008, ten suspected criminals, one policeman, and five civilians, a total of 16 people, including a seven-year-old girl, were killed in a shootout in Parañaque. Several others were wounded, including a ranking officer of the Highway Patrol Group, two members of the Special Action Force, a village watchman, and a security guard, said Director Leopoldo Bataoil, head of the Metro Manila regional police. The criminals belonged to a Waray-Waray gang and were armed with intermediate-caliber M16 rifles fitted with grenade launchers.

The head of the Internal Affairs Service of the PNP said, &quot;We failed in our mission to protect the civilians.&quot; On July 29, 2009, the Department of Justice (DOJ) filed multiple murder charges against 29 policemen, including three generals, in connection with the shootout following the filing of a complaint-affidavit by Lilian de Vera, who lost her husband and seven-year-old daughter in the incident. On January 11, 2010, the Commission on Human Rights recommended the filing of criminal and administrative charges against 26 policemen In March, it was reported that after two witnesses had said De Vera and his daughter were not killed in the shootout, that policemen already had complete control of the area where the two were killed.

===Binayug torture case===
Inspector Joselito Binayug, chief of the Asuncion police community precinct in Tondo arrested Darius Evangelista on March 5, 2009, for alleged robbery. A torture video was leaked to the media and shown on television showing a police officer whipping and cursing the suspect and pulling on a rope that was tied to the victim&#x27;s genitals. The incident allegedly happened inside the Asuncion police precinct in Tondo. Binayug was arrested for violating the Anti-Torture act of 2009. Separate charges were filed for Evangelista being tortured to death.

===Maguindanao massacre===

On November 24, 2009, Senior Superintendent Abusana Maguid, the police chief of Maguindanao province, was reported to have been relieved of his duties after witnesses reported seeing three of his officers at the scene of the Maguindanao massacre in which 57 people, including journalists, lawyers, aides, and motorists who were witnesses were killed. On November 25 Maguid and Chief Inspector Sukarno Dikay were reported to have been relieved from post and placed under restrictive custody. On November 26, Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) Secretary Ronaldo Puno announced that Maguid, Dikay, and others were suspected of involvement in the massacre. On December 19, Maguid, Dikay, and others were reported to have been recommended for summary dismissal by the PNP high command. On April 16, 2010, the National Police Commission ordered a 90-day suspension against Maguid, Dikay, and 60 other police personnel for their possible involvement in the killings. On July 10, it was reported that Dikay had applied to become state witness, saying that he is confident that his testimony will pin down the masterminds of the killing.

===Failed hostage rescue operation===

The Philippine National Police conceded that in the 2010 Manila hostage crisis they made blunders in ending a bus hijacking, as outrage grew over the bloody assault played out on live television that left eight Hong Kong tourists dead. The Hong Kong Economic Journal was reported to have accused the PNP of having &quot;appalling professional standards&quot; and &quot;...[a] lack of strategic planning&quot;.

===&quot;Wheel of Torture&quot; secret detention facility===
The Philippine Commission on Human Rights filed charges against ten police officers after it was discovered that they routinely tortured detainees inside a secret detention facility in Biñan, Laguna. It was alleged that some &quot;were tortured for the police officers’ amusement&quot; when they&#x27;re intoxicated. The facility is notorious for utilizing a roulette called the &quot;Wheel of Torture&quot;, a play on the &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;, where various torture methods were printed. The wheel is rotated and wherever the pin stops, the indicated torture method is perpetrated on the detainee.

The torture methods included a 20-second Manny Pacman punch, named after the famous boxer Manny Pacquiao, where the detainee is beaten for 20 seconds; &quot;Paniki&quot; which means being hung like a bat; &quot;Tusok ulo ka&quot; which means being pierced through the head; &quot;Zombies&quot; which means being electrocuted; and other degrading tasks like &quot;duck walk&quot; and &quot;Ferris wheel&quot;.

===Kidnapping and killing of Jee Ick-Joo===

Sometime in January 2017, a Korean was killed inside Camp Crame. The Philippine National Police Anti-Kidnapping Group (PNP-AKG) charged former NBI officials Roel Boliv, Ricardo Diaz, and Jose Yap in relation to the case.

=== 2013 Pampanga Drug recycling scandal ===
In 2013, an anti-illegal drug unit led by Police Chief Inspector (now Police Major) Rodney Baloyo launched an operation against a certain Chinese national inside a subdivision in Mexico, Pampanga. However, an alleged recycling of Methamphetamine Hydrocloride locally known as &quot;Shabu&quot; worth 648 million Philippine Pesos confiscated dubbed as &quot;Agaw-Bato&quot; by the media and setting drug lord Johnson Lee free were discovered by then Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG) Chief (now Baguio Mayor) Benjamin Magalong resulting to a dismissal of the 13 Policemen dubbed as &quot;Ninja Cops&quot; (including Baloyo) involved in the said operation. In 2019, Magalong revealed that PNP Chief Oscar Albayalde who was then the Pampanga Provincial Director when the incident happened, asked not to implement the dismissal of the cops involved in the recycling of drugs and often profited along with the cops involved. The revelations caused Magalong receiving death threats and the resignation of Albayalde on October 14, 2019.

=== Uniter Association ===
In 2019, German news outlets reported that the Philippine National Police received training from Uniter Association (German: Verein Uniter), a non-government organization suspected to be a neo-Nazi paramilitary due to its alleged affiliation with a far-right network called &quot;Hannibal&quot;. Kontraste, a news magazine of Germany&#x27;s public broadcasting network ARD reported that Uniter members held a training seminar at the Seda Hotel with high-ranking officers of the PNP, and other government officials, including E.R. Ejercito who posted photos of the seminar on his Facebook page two days after he was convicted for graft. Uniter denied claims of training Filipino police forces in an attempt to establish right-wing extremist networks overseas, but insisted that they were there for &quot;humanitarian&quot; support for the PNP, which they claimed it as &quot;unfortunate&quot; timing given the ongoing war on drugs. Despite being reported across Germany amidst a neo-Nazi scandal that hit the &quot;Bundeswehr&quot; (which revolves around an alleged terror plot called &quot;Day X&quot;), it was not reported by Philippine media. The PNP refused to comment on its involvement with Uniter.

===Mañanita during the COVID-19 pandemic===
The holding of a mañanita for NCRPO&#x27;s chief (later PNP Chief) Debold Sinas amidst the COVID-19 pandemic in Metro Manila was criticized for breaching quarantine regulations. A mañanita is a customary celebration in the PNP where senior officers are greeted by their personnel early in the morning of their birthdays. The national police has filed charges against Sinas over the event for violation of existing regulations on social distancing and mass gatherings. However, Sinas was still able to keep his post due to the &quot;emergency situation&quot; posed by the pandemic, as self-proclaimed by him.

=== 2020 Tarlac shooting ===

Police Senior Master Sergeant Jonel Nuezca shot to death his two unarmed neighbors, Sonya Gregorio and her son Frank, in Paniqui, Tarlac, on December 20, 2020, at 5:10 pm (PST).

Several netizens and celebrities condemned the killings on social media with the hashtags #StopTheKillingsPH, #EndPoliceBrutality, #PulisAngTerorista, and #JusticeForSonyaGregorio dominating on Twitter in the Philippines, as well as in Singapore and Dubai. Some critics also pointed at the government over the acts of impunity and human rights abuses in recent years.

An indignation rally was done by numerous groups on December 21, 2020, at the Boy Scout Circle, Quezon City.

The disgraced former PNP officer Jonel Nuezca was found guilty of murder in August 2021 and sentenced to &quot;reclusion perpetua&quot;, which is 40 years imprisonment with parole possible after 30 years. He was also ordered to pay PHP 476,000 (US$9,377) to the heirs of the victims.

<text>Charlene Barshefsky (born August 11, 1950) is an American lawyer. She served as United States Trade Representative from 1997 to 2001. She was the Deputy U.S. Trade Representative from 1993 to 1997. She is a partner at the law firm of Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr. She is also an advisor at Moelis &amp; Company and a participant of the Task Force on U.S.-China Policy convened by the Asia Society&#x27;s Center on US-China Relations.

==Early life, education, and career==
Barshefsky was raised in a Jewish family on the North Side of Chicago, the daughter of Polish immigrant parents: Getzel &quot;Gustave&quot; Barshefsky, a chemical engineer from Rajgród (1912–1995), and Miriam Rosen (1912–2011), a substitute teacher from Łomża. Her father&#x27;s family surname had been Barszczewski (feminine Barszczewska) in Polish. She has an elder brother, Alvin Barshefsky, and an elder sister, Annette Weinshank. In 1968, Barshefsky graduated from Von Steuben High School. In 1972, Barshefsky graduated from the University of Wisconsin–Madison with a bachelor&#x27;s degree, double majoring in English and political science. In 1975, she earned her J.D. from the Columbus School of Law of The Catholic University of America.

Barshefsky was nominated by former President Bill Clinton to serve as Deputy U.S. Trade Representative along with Rufus Yerxa and Richard W. Fisher. In 1999 she was the primary negotiator with China&#x27;s Zhu Rongji, laying out the terms for China&#x27;s eventual entry into the World Trade Organization in December 2001. Her negotiations have been analyzed in Harvard Business School case studies.

==Legal practice==
As of June 2012, Barshefsky is a senior international partner at WilmerHale. Her legal practice focuses on international business transactions, commercial agreements, and regulatory impediments to exporting and investment. Specifically, her expertise lies in &quot;crafting market penetration strategies for goods, services, and investment and devising practical solutions to market access barriers&quot;. Her clients include Fortune 100 and other multinational companies that services like trade litigation, dispute resolution, and government relations strategies. She also advises foreign corporations on commercial and regulatory issues in the United States.

Barshefsky has written and lectured extensively on both U.S. and foreign trade laws and public procurement regimes. She was a partner at the law firm of Steptoe &amp; Johnson. She previously served as vice chair of the International Law Section of the American Bar Association as well as a member of its governing council and chair of its Publications Committee.

==Board memberships==
Outside of her legal practice, Barshefsky participates in several professional organizations. She is the chair of the National Committee on US-China Relations&#x27; board of directors, a board member of the America-China Society, a fellow of the Foreign Policy Association, and a member of the American Academy of Diplomacy and the Trilateral Commission. She also serves on the boards of Intel, American Express, Estée Lauder Companies, and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. She is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.

<doc id="1313078" wikidata="Q560352" url="?curid=1313078" title="The World as Will and Representation">
<text>The World as Will and Representation (WWR; , WWV), sometimes translated as The World as Will and Idea, is the central work of the German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer. The first edition was published in late 1818, with the date 1819 on the title page. A second, two-volume edition appeared in 1844: volume one was an edited version of the 1818 edition, while volume two consisted of commentary on the ideas expounded in volume one. A third expanded edition was published in 1859, the year before Schopenhauer&#x27;s death. In 1948, an abridged version was edited by Thomas Mann.

In the summer of 1813, Schopenhauer submitted his doctoral dissertation—&quot;On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason&quot;—and was awarded a doctorate from the University of Jena. After spending the following winter in Weimar, he lived in Dresden and published his treatise &quot;On Vision and Colours&quot; in 1816. Schopenhauer spent the next several years working on his chief work, &quot;The World as Will and Representation&quot;. Schopenhauer asserted that the work is meant to convey a &quot;single thought&quot; from various perspectives. He develops his philosophy over four books covering epistemology, ontology, aesthetics, and ethics. Following these books is an appendix containing Schopenhauer&#x27;s detailed &quot;Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy&quot;.

Taking the transcendental idealism of Immanuel Kant as his starting point, Schopenhauer argues that the world humans experience around them—the world of objects in space and time and related in causal ways—exists solely as &quot;representation&quot; () dependent on a cognizing subject, not as a world that can be considered to exist in itself (i.e., independently of how it appears to the subject&#x27;s mind). One&#x27;s knowledge of objects is thus knowledge of mere phenomena rather than things in themselves. Schopenhauer identifies the thing-in-itself — the inner essence of everything — as &quot;will&quot;: a blind, unconscious, aimless striving devoid of knowledge, outside of space and time, and free of all multiplicity. The world as representation is, therefore, the &quot;objectification&quot; of the will. Aesthetic experiences release one briefly from one’s endless servitude to the will, which is the root of suffering. True redemption from life, Schopenhauer asserts, can only result from the total ascetic negation of the &quot;will to life&quot;. Schopenhauer notes fundamental agreements between his philosophy, Platonism, and the philosophy of the ancient Indian Vedas.

&quot;The World as Will and Representation&quot; marked the pinnacle of Schopenhauer&#x27;s philosophical thought; he spent the rest of his life refining, clarifying and deepening the ideas presented in this work without any fundamental changes. The first edition was met with near-universal silence. The second edition of 1844 similarly failed to attract any interest. At the time, post-Kantian German academic philosophy was dominated by the German idealists—foremost among them G. W. F. Hegel, whom Schopenhauer bitterly denounced as a &quot;charlatan&quot;.

==English translations==
In the English language, this work is known under three different titles. Although English publications about Schopenhauer played a role in the recognition of his fame as a philosopher in later life (1851 until his death in 1860) and a three volume translation by R. B. Haldane and J. Kemp, titled &quot;The World as Will and Idea&quot;, appeared already in 1883–1886, the first English translation of the expanded edition of this work under this title &quot;The World as Will and Representation&quot; appeared by E. F. J. Payne (who also translated several other works of Schopenhauer) as late as in 1958 (paperback editions in 1966 and 1969). A later English translation by Richard E. Aquila in collaboration with David Carus is titled &quot;The World as Will and Presentation&quot; (2008). The latest translation by Judith Norman, Alistair Welchman, and Christopher Janaway is titled &quot;The World as Will and Representation&quot; (Volume 1: 2010, Volume 2: 2018).

There is some debate over the best way to convey, in English, the meaning of &quot;Vorstellung,&quot; a key concept in Schopenhauer&#x27;s philosophy that is used in the title of his main work. Schopenhauer uses &quot;Vorstellung&quot; to describe whatever comes before in the mind in consciousness (as opposed to the &quot;will,&quot; which is what the world that appears to us as &quot;Vorstellung&quot; is in itself). In ordinary usage, &quot;Vorstellung&quot; could be rendered as &quot;idea&quot; (thus the title of Haldane and Kemp&#x27;s translation). However, Kant uses the Latin term &quot;&quot; when discussing the meaning of &quot;Vorstellung&quot; (&quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot; A320/B376). Thus, as is commonly done, one might use the English term &#x27;representation&#x27; to render &quot;Vorstellung&quot; (as done by E. F. J. Payne in his translation). Norman, Welchman, and Janaway also use the English term &#x27;representation&#x27;. In the introduction, they point out that Schopenhauer uses &quot;Vorstellung&quot; the same way Kant uses it — &#x27;representation&#x27; &quot;stands for anything that the mind is conscious of in its experience, knowledge, or cognition of any form — something that is present to the mind. So our first task in &quot;The World as Will and Representation&quot; is to consider the world as it presents itself to us in our minds.&quot;

In the introduction to his translation with David Carus (first published 2008), Richard Aquila argues that the reader will not grasp the details of the philosophy of Schopenhauer properly without rendering &quot;Vorstellung&quot; as &quot;presentation&quot;. It is the notion of a performance or theatrical presentation – of which one is the spectator – that is key in this interpretation. The world that we perceive can be understood as a &quot;presentation&quot; of objects in the theatre of our own mind. &quot;Vorstellung&quot; can refer to &quot;what is presented&quot; or to the process of presenting it. Schopenhauer argues that what does the &quot;presenting&quot; – what sets the world as &#x27;presentation&#x27; before one – is the cognizant subject itself. The primary sense of &quot;Vorstellung&quot; used by Schopenhauer, Aquila writes, is that of what is presented to a subject: the presented &quot;object&quot; (&quot;&quot; presented, as opposed to what it is &quot;in itself&quot;). Aquila argues that translating &quot;Vorstellung&quot; as &#x27;representation&#x27; fails to &quot;bring out the dual notion of that which is &#x27;set before&#x27; a cognizant subject as its object, and the presentational activity of the subject therein engaged&quot; and is potentially misleading from Schopenhauer&#x27;s principal point.

==Relationship to earlier philosophical work==

Schopenhauer demands that his doctoral dissertation &quot;On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason&quot;, which appeared in 1813, be read before &quot;WWR&quot; as an introduction. Referring to &quot;On the Fourfold Root&quot;, Schopenhauer states in the preface to the first edition of &quot;WWR&quot; that it is &quot;absolutely impossible to truly understand the present work unless the reader is familiar with this introduction and , and the contents of that essay are presupposed here as much as if they had been included in the book&quot;.

Furthermore, Schopenhauer states at the beginning that his book assumes the reader&#x27;s prior knowledge of the philosophy of Immanuel Kant. Schopenhauer asserted that his philosophy was the natural continuation of Kant&#x27;s, and is regarded by some as remaining more faithful to Kant&#x27;s metaphysical system of transcendental idealism, expounded in the &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot; (1781), than any of the other later German idealists. However, &quot;The World as Will and Representation&quot; contains an appendix entitled &quot;Critique of the Kantian philosophy&quot;, in which Schopenhauer rejects most of Kant&#x27;s ethics and significant parts of his epistemology and aesthetics. As Schopenhauer explains: &quot;However much I take the achievements of the great Kant as my point of departure, a serious study of his works has nonetheless enabled me to discover significant errors, and I have had to separate these errors out and show them to be unsound so that I could then presuppose and apply what is true and excellent in his theories in a pure form, freed from these errors.&quot;

Schopenhauer saw the human will as our one window to the reality behind the world as representation, i.e. the external world as we experience it through our mental faculties. According to Schopenhauer, the will is the &#x27;inner essence&#x27; of the entire world, i.e. the Kantian thing-in-itself (&quot;Ding an sich&quot;), and exists independently of the forms of the principle of sufficient reason that govern the world as representation. Schopenhauer believed that while we may be precluded from direct knowledge of the Kantian noumenon, we may gain knowledge about it to a certain extent (unlike Kant, for whom the noumenon was completely unknowable). This is because, according to Schopenhauer, the relationship between the world as representation and the world as it is &#x27;in itself&#x27; can be understood by investigating the relationship between our bodies (material objects, i.e. representations, existing in space and time) and our will. Another important difference between the philosophies of Schopenhauer and Kant is Schopenhauer&#x27;s rejection of Kant&#x27;s doctrine of twelve categories of the understanding. Schopenhauer claims that eleven of Kant&#x27;s categories are superfluous &quot;blind windows&quot; meant for the purposes of architectonic symmetry. Schopenhauer argues that there are three &quot;a priori&quot; forms by which our minds render our experience of the world intelligible to ourselves: time, space, and causality.

Schopenhauer also states in his introduction that the reader will be at his best prepared to understand the theories in &quot;The World as Will and Representation&quot; if he has lingered in the school of &quot;the divine Plato&quot;: Schopenhauer frequently acknowledges Plato&#x27;s influence on the development of his theories and, particularly in the context of aesthetics, speaks of the Platonic forms as existing on an intermediate ontological level between the representation and the Will. The reader will be at an even further advantage if they are already familiar with the ancient Indian philosophy contained within the Upanishads.

==Development and structure of the work==
The development of Schopenhauer&#x27;s ideas took place very early in his career (1814–1818) and culminated in the publication of the first volume of &quot;Will and Representation&quot; in 1819. This first volume consisted of four books—covering his epistemology, ontology, aesthetics and ethics, in order. Much later in his life, in 1844, Schopenhauer published a second edition in two volumes, the first a virtual reprint of the original, and the second a new work consisting of clarifications to and additional reflections on the first. His views had not changed substantially.

Schopenhauer states in the preface to the first edition that &quot;The World as Will and Representation&quot; aims to &quot;convey a single thought.&quot; The resulting structure of the work is therefore, in his words, &quot;organic rather than chainlike,&quot; with all of the book&#x27;s earlier parts presupposing the later parts &quot;almost as much as the later ones presuppose the earlier.&quot; Each of the work&#x27;s four main parts function as &quot;four perspectives [&quot;Gesichtspunkte&quot;], as it were, on the one thought.&quot; Thus Schopenhauer counsels reading the book more than once, with considerable patience the first time. Schopenhauer addresses the structure of the work in the following passage from Book IV, section 54:

His belated fame after 1851 stimulated renewed interest in his seminal work, and led to a third and final edition with 136 more pages in 1859, one year before his death. In the preface to the latter, Schopenhauer noted: &quot;If I also have at last arrived, and have the satisfaction at the end of my life of seeing the beginning of my influence, it is with the hope that, according to an old rule, it will last longer in proportion to the lateness of its beginning.&quot;

==Volume 1==
Schopenhauer used the word &quot;will&quot; as a human&#x27;s most familiar designation for the concept that can also be signified by other words such as &quot;desire&quot;, &quot;striving&quot;, &quot;wanting&quot;, &quot;effort&quot; and &quot;urging&quot;. Schopenhauer&#x27;s philosophy holds that all nature, including man, is the expression of an insatiable &quot;will&quot;. It is through the will, the in-itself of all existence, that humans find all their suffering. Desire for more is what causes this suffering. He argues that only aesthetic pleasure creates momentary escape from the will. Schopenhauer&#x27;s concept of desire has strong parallels in Buddhist thought. Buddhism identifies the individual&#x27;s pervasive sense of dissatisfaction as driving craving, roughly similar to what Schopenhauer would call the will to life. Both assert that remedies for this condition include contemplative, ascetic activities.

The epigraph to volume one is a quotation from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe: &quot;Ob nicht Natur zuletzt sich doch ergründe?&quot; (&#x27;Might not nature finally fathom itself?&#x27;). The quotation comes from a poem to Staatsminister von Voigt, 27 September 1816.

===Epistemology (Book I)===
The opening sentence of Schopenhauer&#x27;s work is &quot;Die Welt ist meine Vorstellung&quot;: &quot;the world is my representation&quot; (alternatively, &quot;idea&quot; or &quot;presentation&quot;). In the first book, Schopenhauer considers the world as representation. Specifically, the first book deals with representation subject to the principle of sufficient reason (German: &quot;Satz vom Grunde&quot;). In Book III, Schopenhauer returns to considering the world as representation; this time, he focuses on representation &quot;independent&quot; of the principle of sufficient reason (i.e. the Platonic Idea, the immediate and adequate objecthood of the will, which is the object of art).

Schopenhauer begins &quot;WWR&quot; by examining the world as it shows itself to us in our minds: objects ordered necessarily by space and time and by cause-and-effect relationships. In our experience, the world is ordered according to the principle of sufficient reason. We perceive a multiplicity of objects related to one another in necessary ways.

===Ontology (Book II)===
In Book II, Schopenhauer argues that &quot;will&quot; is the Kantian thing-in-itself: the single essence underlying all objects and phenomena. Kant believed that space and time were merely the forms of our intuition by which we must perceive the world of phenomena, and these factors were absent from the thing-in-itself. Schopenhauer pointed out that anything outside of time and space could not be differentiated, so the thing-in-itself must be one. All things that exist, including human beings, must be part of this fundamental unity. The manifestation of the single will into the multiplicity of objects we experience is the will&#x27;s &quot;objectivation.&quot; Plurality exists and has become possible only through time and space, which is why Schopenhauer refers to them as the &quot;principium individuationis&quot;. The will, as thing-in-itself, lies outside of the principle of sufficient reason (in all its forms) and is thus groundless (though each of the will&#x27;s phenomena is subject to that principle). The will, lying outside the &quot;principium individuationis&quot;, is free from all plurality (though its phenomena, existing in space and time, are innumerable).

All phenomena embody essential striving: electricity and gravity, for instance, are described as fundamental forces of the will. Human capacity for cognition, Schopenhauer asserts, is subordinate to the demands of the will. Moreover, everything that wills necessarily suffers. Schopenhauer presents a pessimistic picture on which unfulfilled desires are painful, and pleasure is merely the sensation experienced at the instant one such pain is removed. However, most desires are never fulfilled, and those that are fulfilled are instantly replaced by more unfulfilled ones.

===Aesthetics (Book III)===

In Book III, Schopenhauer explores the experience of aesthetic contemplation. When we contemplate something aesthetically, we have knowledge of the object not as an individual thing but rather as a universal Platonic Idea (&quot;die Platonische Idee&quot;). The individual is then able to lose himself in the object of aesthetic contemplation and, for a brief moment, escape the cycle of unfulfilled desire as a &quot;pure, will-less subject of knowledge&quot; (&quot;reinen, willenlosen Subjekts der Erkenntniß&quot;). This entails the abandonment of the method of cognition bound to the principle of sufficient reason (the only mode appropriate to the service of the will and science). During the aesthetic experience, we gain momentary relief from the pain that accompanies our striving. Like many other aesthetic theories, Schopenhauer&#x27;s centers on the concept of genius. Genius, according to Schopenhauer, is possessed by all people in varying degrees and consists of the capacity for aesthetic experience. Those who have a high degree of genius can be taught to communicate these aesthetic experiences to others, and objects that communicate these experiences are works of art.

We consider objects to be beautiful that best facilitate contemplation that is purely objective by a will-less consciousness and express &#x27;elevated&#x27; Ideas (such as those of humanity). Schopenhauer compares the experience of something as beautiful to the experience of something as sublime (&quot;das Erhabene&quot;)—in the latter case, we struggle over our natural hostility to the object of contemplation and are elevated above it. An aesthetic experience does not arise from the object &quot;stimulating&quot; our will; hence Schopenhauer criticized depictions of nude women and appetizing food, as these stimulate desire and thus hinder the viewer from becoming &quot;the pure, will-less subject of knowledge.&quot;

The rest of the Third Book contains an account of a variety of art forms, including architecture, landscape gardening, landscape painting, animal painting, historical painting, sculpture, the nude, literature (poetry and tragedy), and lastly, music. Music occupies a privileged place in Schopenhauer&#x27;s aesthetics, as he believed it to have a special relationship to the will. Other artworks objectify the will only indirectly by means of the Ideas (the adequate objectification of the will), and our world is nothing but the appearance of the Ideas in multiplicity resulting from those Ideas entering into the &quot;principium individuationis&quot;. Music, Schopenhauer asserts, passes over the Ideas and is therefore independent of the phenomenal world. He writes:

===Ethics (Book IV)===
In Book IV, Schopenhauer returns to considering the world as will. He claims in this book to set forth a purely descriptive account of human ethical behavior, in which he identifies two types of behavior: the affirmation and denial of the &#x27;will to life&#x27; (&quot;Wille zum Leben&quot;), which constitutes the essence of every individual. Schopenhauer subsequently elucidated his ethical philosophy in his two prize essays: &quot;On the Freedom of the Will&quot; (1839) and &quot;On the Basis of Morality&quot; (1840).

According to Schopenhauer, the will conflicts with itself through the egoism that every human and animal is endowed with. Compassion arises from a transcendence of this egoism (the penetration of the illusory perception of individuality, so that one can empathise with the suffering of another) and can serve as a clue to the possibility of going beyond desire and the will. Schopenhauer categorically denies the existence of the &quot;freedom of the will&quot; in the conventional sense, and only adumbrates how the will can be affirmed or negated, but is not subject to change, and serves as the root of the chain of causal determinism.

Schopenhauer discusses suicide at length, noting that it does not actually destroy the Will or any part of it in any substantial way, since death is merely the end of one particular phenomenon of the Will, which is subsequently rearranged. By asceticism, the ultimate denial of the will as practiced by eastern monastics and by saints, one can slowly weaken the individual will in a way that is far more significant than violent suicide, which is, in fact, in some sense an affirmation of the will.

Schopenhauer&#x27;s praise for asceticism led him to think highly of Buddhism and Vedanta Hinduism, as well as some monastic orders and ascetic practices found in Catholicism. He expressed contempt for Protestantism, Judaism, and Islam, which he saw as optimistic, devoid of metaphysics and cruel to non-human animals. According to Schopenhauer, the deep truth of the matter is that in cases of the over-affirmation of the will—that is, cases where one individual exerts his will not only for its own fulfillment but for the improper domination of others—he is unaware that he is really identical with the person he is harming, so that the Will in fact constantly harms itself, and justice is done in the moment in which the crime is committed, since the same metaphysical individual is both the perpetrator and the victim.

According to Schopenhauer, denial of the will to live is the way to salvation from suffering. Salvation can only result from the recognition that individuality is nothing more than an illusion—the world in itself cannot be divided into individuals—which &#x27;tranquilizes&#x27; the will. The human who comprehends this would &#x27;negate&#x27; his will and thus be freed from the pains of existence that result from the will&#x27;s ceaseless striving. &quot;Schopenhauer tells us that when the will is denied, the sage becomes nothing, without actually dying.&quot; When willing disappears, both the willer and the world become nothing. &quot;...[T]o one who has achieved the will-less state, it is the world of the willer that has been disclosed as &#x27;nothing&#x27;. Its hold over us, its seeming reality, has been &#x27;abolished&#x27; so that it now stands before us as nothing but a bad dream from which we are, thankfully, awaking.&quot; Schopenhauer concludes the Fourth Book with the following statement: &quot;...to those in whom the will has turned and denied itself, this very real world of ours, with all its Suns and Milky Ways, is—nothing.&quot; In a footnote, Schopenhauer associates this &#x27;nothing&#x27; with the Prajñāpāramitā of Buddhism: the point where subject and object no longer exist.

===Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy (Appendix)===

At the end of Book 4, Schopenhauer appended a thorough discussion of the merits and faults of Kant&#x27;s philosophy. Schopenhauer&#x27;s &quot;Kritik der Kantischen Philosophie&quot; opens with the following quote from Voltaire from &quot;The Age of Louis XIV&quot;: &quot;&quot;C&#x27;est le privilège du vrai génie, et surtout du génie qui ouvre une carrière, de faire impunément de grandes fautes&quot; (&#x27;It is the privilege of true genius, and above all the genius who opens a new path, to make great errors with impunity.&#x27;) Schopenhauer asserts that Kant&#x27;s greatest merit was the distinction between appearance [&quot;Erscheinung&quot;] and the thing-in-itself [&quot;Ding an sich&quot;], proving that the intellect always stands between us and things, and thus we cannot have knowledge of things as they may be in themselves. Among Kant&#x27;s defects, Schopenhauer argues, is the untenable manner in which Kant chose to introduce the thing-in-itself in his &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot;. Schopenhauer also argued that Kant failed to distinguish between intuitive and abstract cognition—that is, intuitive representations from concepts thought merely in the abstract—which gave rise to grave confusions and errors. Criticizing Kant&#x27;s preference for arranging his philosophical system according to an elegant architectonic symmetry, Schopenhauer at one point describes Kant&#x27;s twelve categories as a &quot;terrible Procrustean bed into which he violently forces everything in the world and everything that happens in humans.&quot;

==Volume 2==
The second volume consisted of several essays expanding topics covered in the first. Most important are his reflections on death and his theory on sexuality, which saw it as a manifestation of the whole will making sure that it will live on and depriving humans of their reason and sanity in their longing for their loved ones. Less successful is his theory of genetics: he argued that humans inherit their will, and thus their character, from their fathers, but their intellect from their mothers and he provides examples from biographies of great figures to illustrate this theory. The second volume also contains attacks on contemporary philosophers such as Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel.

The first decades after its publication &quot;The World as Will and Representation&quot; was met with near silence. Exceptions were Goethe and Jean Paul. Goethe immediately started to read the magnum opus of Schopenhauer when it arrived and &quot;read it with an eagerness as she [ Ottilie von Goethe ] had &quot;never&quot; before seen in him&quot;. Goethe told his daughter-in-law that he had now pleasure for an entire year, because he would read it completely, contrary to his custom of sampling pages to his liking. The influence of Schopenhauer can be read in &quot;Gespräche mit Goethe&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

In the years where the work was largely ignored, Jean Paul praised it as &quot;a work of philosophical genius, bold, universal, full of penetration and profoundness—but of a depth often hopeless and bottomless, akin to that melancholy lake in Norway, in whose deep water, beneath the steep rock-walls, one never sees the sun, but only stars reflected&quot;, on which Schopenhauer commented: &quot;In my opinion the praise of one man of genius fully makes good the neglect of a thoughtless multitude&quot;.

This neglect came to an end in the last years of his life. Schopenhauer would become the most influential philosopher in Germany until World War I. Especially artists were attracted to the work. No philosopher had given so much importance to art: one fourth of &quot;The World as Will and Representation&quot; is concerned with aesthetics. To be mentioned are Wagner (Influence of Schopenhauer on &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;), Schoenberg, Mahler, who cites &quot;The World as Will and Representation&quot; as &quot;the most profound writing on music he had ever encountered&quot;, Thomas Mann, Hermann Hesse, Jorge Luis Borges, Tolstoy, D. H. Lawrence and Samuel Beckett.

The philosophers Friedrich Nietzsche and Philipp Mainländer both described the discovery of &quot;The World as Will and Representation&quot; as a revelation. Nietzsche commented, &quot;I belong to those readers of Schopenhauer who know perfectly well, after they have turned the first page, that they will read all the others, and listen to every word that he has spoken&quot;.

Charles Darwin quoted &quot;The World as Will and Representation&quot; in &quot;The Descent of Man&quot;. Some read ideas in it that can be found in the theory of evolution, for example, that sexual instinct is a tool of nature to ensure the quality of the offspring. Schopenhauer argued in favor of transformism by pointing to one of the most important and familiar evidences of the truth of the theory of descent, the homologies in the inner structure of all the vertebrates.

Schopenhauer&#x27;s discussions of language and ethics were a major influence on Ludwig Wittgenstein, who had read &quot;The World as Will and Representation&quot; at age 16.

Schopenhauer&#x27;s views on the independence of spatially separated systems, the &quot;principium individuationis&quot;, influenced Einstein, who called him a genius. Schrödinger put the Schopenhauerian label on a folder of papers in his files &quot;Collection of Thoughts on the physical Principium individuationis&quot;.
