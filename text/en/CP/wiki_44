<text>The 1910 [[World Series]] was the championship series in Major League Baseball for the 1910 season. The seventh edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff between the American League (AL) champion Philadelphia Athletics against the National League (NL) champion Chicago Cubs. The series was played from October 17 to 23, with the Athletics winning the series 4games to 1, clinching the team&#x27;s first World Series.

Jack Coombs of Philadelphia won three games and Eddie Collins supplied timely hitting.

==Background==
===Philadelphia Athletics===

The Athletics were making their second appearance in the World Series. They had lost the 1905 edition four games to one against the New York Giants. They had dominated the American League, leading it since early May, and eventually winning it by games. Their pitcher Jack Coombs led the American League in wins with a 31–9 record, and the Athletics had the lowest ERA in the league by some margin.

===Chicago Cubs===

The Chicago Cubs were a dominant team in the first decade of the 1900s. They had already won two World Series, and been runners-up in another; this was their fourth appearance. The National League was initially closer than the American League, with the Cubs wrestling control of the division from the Pittsburgh Pirates in late May after a long winning streak. They never looked back, only increasing their lead over the course of the season. The Cubs&#x27; slugger Frank Schulte led the National League in home runs with 10, while pitcher King Cole had the lowest ERA in the league, 1.80. The Chicago Cubs won the division by 13 games.

===Series preview===
Before the series, pundits were split over who the favorites were. The pitching of the Athletics was generally held to be superior to that of the Cubs, as the Cubs pitchers were thought to be merely decent. The Cubs, however, were felt to have a stronger catcher in Johnny Kling, and slightly stronger batters as well. Altogether, Philadelphia had a younger team, while Chicago had an older but experienced group of players. Former coach Ned Hanlon picked the Athletics, as did former pitcher Jack Dunn. However, John McGraw, manager of the New York Giants, held that the Cubs would win the series. Before the series, the Athletics played the All-Stars, featuring Ty Cobb; they played poorly on the Friday before the Series, which lowered confidence in the ability of the Philadelphia team. Second baseman Johnny Evers was out injured for the Cubs, while outfielder and strong batter Rube Oldring was injured for the Athletics.

This World Series featured a new ball, manufactured by the Reach Company. It had a cork center, not a rubber one. The ball was meant to be stronger and hold up better instead of becoming soft and losing its shape after being used for a long period of time.

==Summary==
==Matchups==
===Game 1===

Connie Mack chose Chief Bender to start game 1, while Orval Overall was selected by Frank Chance. The second inning began with a double by Home Run Baker. Harry Davis sacrificed, and Danny Murphy singled to left to send Baker home. Murphy then stole second and advanced to third on Jack Barry&#x27;s sacrifice. Chief Bender, the pitcher, then came up to bat, and managed to bat in a run. The next inning began with a Bris Lord double and a Eddie Collins sacrifice. Home Run Baker hit a single to shortstop which allowed Lord to score, and the score was 0–3.

With two outs in the eighth inning, Eddie Collins was walked. Collins was a leading base-stealer and McIntire attempted to get him out at first, but his throw to the first baseman was wild and Collins advanced to third. Home Run Baker hit a double to right field and made it 0–4. In the ninth inning, a foul by Joe Tinker was fumbled by Athletics catcher Ira Thomas, and on the next pitch, Tinker hit a double. Johnny Kling then doubled and Tinker scored. Frank Schulte was walked, and it seemed a comeback may be on, but Solly Hofman grounded out, ending the game at 1–4.

Chief Bender allowed the Cubs just three hits and one unearned run. Before the ninth inning, Bender had allowed only one hit and one base on balls. He also registered seven strikeouts, and, unusually for a pitcher, an RBI. Frank Baker had three hits and two RBI for the A&#x27;s.

===Game 2===

Star pitcher Jack Coombs was the starter for the Athletics, while Mordecai Brown began the game for the Cubs. Before the game, Ty Cobb and Nap Lajoie, winners of the Chalmers Awards, were presented with new cars from Chalmers Motor Company, though Lajoie was not present and a friend accepted the car in his stead.

Jack Coombs started the game shakily, walking Jimmy Sheckard, who was forced out at second after Frank Schulte grounded and got to first base. Solly Hofman was also walked by Coombs, allowing Frank Chance to single and load the bases. Heinie Zimmerman then hit a sacrifice to score one run for the Cubs. Coombs recovered somewhat and struck Harry Steinfeldt out, ending the inning with a score of 1–0. In the bottom of the third inning, Ira Thomas advanced to first after an error, and Amos Strunk and Bris Lord had base hits, though Strunk was forced out at second base. Eddie Collins hit a double, allowing Thomas and Lord to reach home and make the score 1–2. Although Coombs continued to struggle, and twice fumbled the ball in the fifth inning, good fielding allowed Philadelphia to keep Chicago at one run. Harry Davis singled to left in the bottom of the fifth, allowing Eddie Collins to score from second base, increasing the Athletics&#x27; lead to 1–3.

In the seventh inning, the Cubs got one back after Jimmy Sheckard doubled and Frank Chance hit hard to center. Coombs additionally walked Solly Hofman for the third time, and the game no longer looked as though it was firmly in Philadelphia&#x27;s hands. The bottom of the seventh began with Eddie Collins being walked, and Home Run Baker singled, putting Collins on third. Then Harry Davis and Danny Murphy doubled, bringing home three runs in Collins, Baker, and Davis himself. Murphy went to third after Jack Barry sacrificed, Ira Thomas sent Murphy home. Amos Strunk doubled, and Thomas scored. Bris Lord hit a fly-out, but Jimmy Sheckard dropped the ball, and Strunk came home. Lord finally ended the inning when he was caught stealing second. The six-run rally left the score at 2–9. After the inning, Lew Richie came in for the struggling Mordecai Brown.

Heinie Zimmerman hit a double in the ninth inning, allowing Solly Hofman to score. The game ended 3–9, giving the Athletics a 2–0 lead in the series. The two teams left by train for Chicago that evening, in preparation for game three on Thursday.

Jack Coombs had pitched erratically, allowing eight hits and walking nine, but still picked up the win. The Cubs left 14 men on base, a Series record at that time. The A&#x27;s combed Mordecai Brown for 13 hits. Eddie Collins was praised for his performance, which involved getting 3 hits out of four at-bats, scoring two runs and batting in another.

===Game 3===

Jack Coombs started again for Philadelphia, while Ed Reulbach was Chicago&#x27;s starter. The game was played on a cold, cloudy day, and it drizzled during the second half of the match. An attendance of at least 30,000 fans had been expected by Chicago officials, but only 26,210 people showed up, though those who did stayed almost the entire game in spite of the home team&#x27;s struggles.

The game got off to an exciting and even start. The first batter, Amos Strunk of the Athletics, was walked by starting pitcher Ed Reulbach. Bris Lord sacrificed, and Home Run Baker singled on a low curveball, putting the Athletics up 1–0. However, in Chicago&#x27;s half of the inning, they matched the Athletics, as Solly Hofman sent Jimmy Sheckard home after Sheckard had advanced to third on Frank Schulte&#x27;s double. Harry Davis scored for Philadelphia at the beginning of the second inning on a Jack Barry double, and Barry himself scored when pitcher Jack Coombs doubled once more. Chicago quickly matched this as well – Joe Tinker doubled, and Ginger Beaumont and Jimmy Sheckard walked, loading the bases. Frank Schulte doubled again to tie the game at 3.

Before the third inning, Reulbach was taken off, and Harry McIntire assumed his spot on the pitcher&#x27;s mound for the Cubs. With one out and Eddie Collins on first, Home Run Baker hit a triple and put Philadelphia back in the lead. Harry Davis was hit by a pitch and went to first, and then Danny Murphy hit a three-run home run to right. This caused controversy as the Chicago players protested that the ball had not gone far enough and the hit should have counted as a double. Chicago&#x27;s player-manager Frank Chance was ejected from the game, the first time in World Series history that a manager was punished in this way. McIntire was then taken off and replaced with Jack Pfiester. However, Pfiester&#x27;s first pitch was hit for a double by Jack Barry, who scored when Ira Thomas hit to shortstop Joe Tinker. Tinker threw poorly to first base, allowing the Athletics to score their fifth run of the inning. A double play finally stemmed the bleeding, but the inning ended 8–3.

After this, Coombs settled into the form that had gained him a reputation as one of the best pitchers in the league. His breaking balls were unhittable, and Chicago were unable to get back into the game. The next few innings therefore passed uneventfully in the batting department, until the seventh inning. The inning started with two outs, and Harry Steinfeldt had the chance to finish it, but he fumbled Home Run Baker&#x27;s hit and the Philadelphia player got to first. The bases were filled by Harry Davis and Danny Murphy, and Jack Barry hit his third double of the game to earn the Athletics two runs. The bases were loaded again when Ira Thomas was walked. Jack Coombs then hit a single to score two more runs, giving the pitcher three RBI, and making the score 12–3. Chicago scored twice in the eighth inning as a result of a passed ball. The game ended 12–5.

After Chicago&#x27;s implosion, blame was assigned to the pitchers, who The Washington Times described as &quot;absolute failures&quot;. Frank Chance even acknowledged that &quot;Our pitchers haven&#x27;t been able to stop the Philadelphia hitters.&quot; On the other side of the coin, the Athletics looked unstoppable. Ty Cobb predicted that they would sweep the series, and Connie Mack confidently pronounced that they would defeat the Cubs in game 4.

The Athletics rapped out 16 hits to Chicago&#x27;s 7. Jack Coombs gave up 5 runs but won his second game of the series.

===Game 4===
Chief Bender was chosen to start for Philadelphia, while King Cole was put out for Chicago as the last hope for the Cubs. Additionally, Jimmy Archer started as Chicago&#x27;s catcher instead of Johnny Kling, as the Cubs believed that the Athletics had figured out Kling&#x27;s signs. The game was planned to be held on Friday, but was postponed due to rain.

Chicago began the scoring in the bottom of the first. Jimmy Sheckard was walked and stole second, before being brought home by Solly Hofman. However, in the third inning, with two outs, Amos Strunk tripled and Chief Bender, who was on first having been walked, scored. Strunk accidentally slid past third base and was tagged out, but Bender was home before him, tying the game at 1.

In the fourth inning, Philadelphia had Eddie Collins on first when Home Run Baker doubled. Harry Davis struck out, but Danny Murphy doubled again and scored two runs for the Athletics. In the Cubs&#x27; half of the inning, Frank Schulte got to third after Solly Hofman&#x27;s double. Frank Chance singled and Schulte went home, making it 3–2. Chicago had a good chance to re-tie the game, as there were no outs and they had men on first and second, but the Athletics took out Hofman and Heinie Zimmerman on a double play, and Harry Steinfeldt hit a fly ball, ending the fourth.

The next few innings passed with many close chances for the Athletics. In both the sixth and the eighth inning Home Run Baker was out at the plate. Chicago pinch hit Johnny Kling for King Cole in their half of the eighth inning, and put Mordecai Brown on the mound for the ninth.

In the bottom of the ninth, the Cubs were still behind 3–2, in serious danger of being swept. Frank Schulte doubled, and got to third when Hofman was tagged out bunting. Player-manager Frank Chance came up to bat with one out, and was hit by the first pitch on the finger, but the umpire ruled that he had walked into it. Then he tripled to center, tying the game. Although they now had a man on third, the next two Chicago players hit fly outs, and the game went into extra innings.

In the bottom of the tenth inning, with two outs, Jimmy Sheckard came up to bat. Jimmy Archer was on second, having doubled. Sheckard&#x27;s single to center won the game for Chicago, 4–3.

===Game 5===


Jack Coombs started Game 5 for the Athletics, while Mordecai Brown was tasked with keeping the Cubs in contention. Further, Philadelphia manager Connie Mack opted to start Topsy Hartsel in left field, moving Bris Lord to center rather than Amos Strunk, and also switched catcher Ira Thomas with Jack Lapp. The game was played on a bright, sunny Sunday.

Topsy Hartsel began the game with a single and stole second while Bris Lord struck out. He scored after Eddie Collins hit a single to center. Philadelphia kept this 1–0 lead until the bottom of the second, when Frank Chance doubled. He made it to third base when Heinie Zimmerman bunted, and scored a tying run on Harry Steinfeldt&#x27;s hit. The Cubs had another chance to score with the bases loaded and one out in the fourth inning, but Coombs struck out two straight Cubs batters. The Athletics capitalized on this, with Jack Lapp&#x27;s fifth inning single allowing Danny Murphy to score from second base.

The score was still 2–1 when the eighth inning began. With one out, Topsy Hartsel stole second, and was controversially called safe. Bris Lord doubled to right, giving the Athletics a run. Lord scored in turn after Eddie Collins doubled. Collins stole third and Home Run Baker singled, but the Cubs defense opted to force Collins out at the plate, allowing Baker to get to first. Harry Davis was walked – Mordecai Brown&#x27;s first base on balls in Game 5 – and Danny Murphy tripled. His hit had blown past Heinie Zimmerman to center fielder Solly Hofman, scoring Baker, but Hofman&#x27;s poor throw home allowed Davis to score as well. Murphy scored on a wild pitch. The Cubs scored a run in the bottom of the eighth when Frank Chance singled to send Jimmy Sheckard home. In the ninth inning, Harry Steinfeldt and Joe Tinker flew out. Jimmy Archer singled, and Johnny Kling emerged to pinch hit for the pitcher, as he did in Game 4. Kling grounded to shortstop Jack Barry, who ran to second base to force Archer out. The game ended 7–2.

Jack Coombs became the third pitcher in World Series history to win 3 games without a loss. Babe Adams did it the year before, but in seven games, and Christy Mathewson accomplished the feat in the 1905 Series. This was the Athletics&#x27; first World Series title.

<text>The 1911 [[World Series]] was the championship series in Major League Baseball for the 1911 season. The eighth edition of the World Series, it matched the American League (AL) champion Philadelphia Athletics against the National League (NL) champion New York Giants. The Athletics won the best-of-seven series four games to two, in a rematch of the 1905 World Series, getting revenge over the Giants, who had won in their previous meeting.

Philadelphia third baseman Frank &quot;Home Run&quot; Baker earned his nickname during this Series. His home run in Game 2 off Rube Marquard was the margin of victory for the Athletics, and his blast in Game 3 off Christy Mathewson tied that game in the ninth inning, and the Athletics eventually won in the 11th. The Giants never recovered. Ironically, Mathewson (or his ghostwriter) had criticized Marquard in his newspaper column after Game 2 for giving up the gopher ball, only to fall victim himself the very next day. Baker was swinging a hot bat in general, going 9 for 24 to lead all batters in the Series with a .375 average.

According to his obituary in &quot;The New York Times&quot; (July 28, 1971), Giants catcher Chief Meyers threw out 12 runners, creating a record for the most assists by a catcher during the World Series.

The six consecutive days of rain between Games 3 and 4 caused the longest delay between World Series games until the earthquake-interrupted 1989 World Series (which incidentally featured the same two franchises, albeit on the West Coast, and which also resulted in an A&#x27;s victory over the Giants). With the sixth and final game being played on October 26, this was also the latest-ending World Series by calendar date until .

This was the second time in World Series history that two teams met in a World Series rematch. The first time was when the Chicago Cubs and Detroit Tigers met in consecutive years, in and . This is also the first World Series to feature two teams that had previously won a title. The Athletics were the defending champions while the Giants had won it all in 1905.

==Summary==

==Matchups==
===Game 1===
With a perfect top of the first, Christy Mathewson set the record with 28 straight shutout innings in World Series play, a record that would be broken by Boston Red Sox&#x27;s Babe Ruth with innings in the 1918 World Series. Mathewson&#x27;s postseason record for consecutive scoreless innings against one team would not be broken until 2013 when the Detroit Tigers&#x27; Justin Verlander shut out the Athletics (now playing in Oakland) for 30 consecutive innings in the 2012 and 2013 ALDS.

===Game 2===

With the score tied at 1 and with Eddie Collins on second, Frank Baker blasted a two-run home run off Rube Marquard to deep right field for the go ahead score and the Athletics held on to win game 2, 3–1.

===Game 3===
With the Giants up 1–0 going into the ninth with Mathewson on the mound, it appeared the series was going to be 2–1 New York. But with one out, Baker stepped up to the plate and blasted his second home run in as many games to tie it at 1. Thus, the nickname &quot;Home Run&quot; Baker was born. Two innings later with the score still tied at 1, Baker singled and scored on an error to make it 3–1. The Giants rallied for one run in the bottom half but the game ended with a runner being thrown out on a stolen base attempt.

===Game 4===
After six days of rain, the series resumed. Chief Bender, after giving up two runs in the first, shut out the Giants the rest of the way on his way to a 4–2 win and 3–1 series lead.

===Game 5===
On the verge of elimination, the Giants fought back. They tied it at 3 with two runs in the bottom of the ninth, and then won it with a run in the tenth when Larry Doyle scored on a sacrifice fly. Home plate umpire Bill Klem later said Doyle had failed to touch home plate after sliding in. Since none of the Athletics noticed this and Philadelphia failed to appeal, Klem had to let the winning run stand. Josh Devore became the first player to get a game-tying hit in the World Series with his team one out from elimination, a feat that would not be repeated until Otis Nixon in the 1992 World Series.

===Game 6===

Bender threw a 4-hitter to clinch the series, the Athletics second consecutive World Series title. The A&#x27;s pitching staff held the Giants to a .175 team batting average, lowest ever for a 6-game series.

<text>The 1912 [[World Series]] was the championship series in Major League Baseball for the 1912 season. The ninth edition of the World Series, it matched the American League champion Boston Red Sox and the National League champion New York Giants. The Red Sox won the Series four games to three (with one tie).

This series, featuring close games and controversial decisions, was regarded as one of the most exciting World Series of its era. Nearly all of the games were close. Four games in this Series were decided by one run. A fifth ended in a tie. A sixth was decided by two runs. Game 7 was the only one with a margin greater than three runs. Two games, including the decisive Game 8, went to extra innings. In Games 1 and 3, the losing team had the tying and winning runs on base when the game ended. To date, this is the only World Series to end on a sacrifice fly.

The series showcased star pitching from Giant Christy Mathewson and Red Sox fireballer Smoky Joe Wood. Wood won two of his three starts and pitched in relief in the final game. In the deciding game, Boston rallied for two runs in the tenth inning thanks to two costly Giants fielding misplays.

This was one of only four World Series to go to eight games, and the only best-of-seven Series to do so. While the 1912 Series was extended to eight games due to a tie game being called on account of darkness, the , , and 1921 World Series were all best-of-nine affairs that happened to run eight games.

In 2020, ESPN ranked the 1912 World Series as the 8th best world series ever played.

==Summary==

==Matchups==
===Game 1===

In batting practice before Game 1, Tris Speaker drove a ball not only over the right field grandstand but completely out of the Polo Grounds. The Series opened with the Red Sox as 10–8 betting favorites. Giants manager John McGraw surprised everyone by starting rookie Jeff Tesreau rather than the great Christy Mathewson against Boston ace Smoky Joe Wood. He preferred to save Mathewson for Game 2 and the hostile crowd at Fenway Park.

New York struck first. Josh Devore walked with one out in the third, and advanced to third base on a single by Larry Doyle lost in the sun by Duffy Lewis. After Fred Snodgrass struck out, Red Murray&#x27;s single scored Devore and Doyle for a 2–0 Giants lead. Tesreau and his spitball held the Red Sox hitless for the first five innings, but Boston then cut the lead to 2–1 in the sixth on a triple by Tris Speaker that fell to the ground untouched when neither Snodgrass nor Devore called for the ball (in an Alphonse-Gaston act), and an RBI groundout by Lewis. The Red Sox scored three runs in the very next inning, on an RBI double by Harry Hooper and a two-run single by Steve Yerkes, after Giants second baseman Doyle had muffed Wood&#x27;s potential inning-ending double play grounder and had to settle for the one out at second. In the bottom of the ninth, the Giants scored a run and had the tying run on third and the winning run on second, but Wood, a spectacular 34–5 in the regular season, struck out the last two batters for the 4–3 Boston win in a complete game with 11 strikeouts. Oddly, McGraw let relief pitcher Doc Crandall bat for himself for what turned out to be the last out rather than using backup catcher Art Wilson to pinch-hit. After the game Wood said, &quot;I threw so hard I thought my arm would fly right off my body.&quot;

===Game 2===

Christy Mathewson later said of the moment when he took the mound at Fenway Park, &quot;This was the only place in the world that I wanted to be. I could think of nothing greater than pitching this game for the glory of the New York Giants.&quot;

An error by Giants shortstop Art Fletcher led to three first-inning unearned Boston runs off Mathewson. Single tallies in the second and fourth by the Giants cut the lead to 3–2. Another error by Fletcher, who failed to tag Harry Hooper on a stolen base attempt, led to a fourth Boston run in the fifth when Yerkes followed the error with an RBI triple. In the top of the eighth Boston returned the favor, allowing New York to strike back for three runs. Left field at brand-new Fenway Park was unique for a incline in front of the wall (later to be called &quot;The Green Monster&quot;). Red Sox left fielder Duffy Lewis was so proficient at negotiating this incline that it was first named &quot;Duffy&#x27;s Cliff&quot; in his honor, but this time Lewis tripped on the hill and failed to catch Fred Snodgrass&#x27; fly ball, putting him on first base. He scored on Murray&#x27;s double, and two batters later third baseman Buck Herzog hit a two-run double to give New York a 5–4 lead.

The Giants&#x27; lead was brief. Lewis doubled in the bottom of the eighth, and then Fletcher&#x27;s terrible day continued with his third error allowing Larry Gardner to reach base and Lewis to score. This tied the game at 5. In the ninth, Boston reliever Charley Hall, who had replaced Ray Collins in the eighth, got the first two outs but proceeded to walk Snodgrass, Larry Doyle and Beals Becker consecutively. But with the bases loaded, Red Murray grounded into a forceout and the Red Sox escaped. Boston went quietly in the bottom of the ninth, setting up extra innings. Fred Merkle led off the New York tenth with a triple and scored on a sacrifice fly to give the Giants a 6–5 lead. Mathewson, who pitched the entire game for New York, came back to the mound in the bottom of the tenth with a chance to slam the door on Boston and even the Series at one game apiece, but Tris Speaker, who had hit .383 in the regular season, slammed an extra-base hit to center field. Giant third baseman Buck Herzog deliberately collided with Speaker to prevent an inside-the-park home run, but Speaker got up and came home anyway. Becker threw the ball in to cutoff man Tillie Shafer, who threw to the plate but catcher Art Wilson dropped the ball—for New York&#x27;s fifth error of the game—and Speaker, who was credited with a triple on the play, scored to tie it at 6. McGraw claimed, and reporters in the press box agreed, that Speaker had missed first base, but base umpire Cy Rigler ruled that he hadn&#x27;t on appeal. Lewis followed with a double to put the winning run in scoring position, but Mathewson retired Gardner and Stahl to escape the inning with a tie.

New York had one last chance in the top of the 11th. Snodgrass led off the inning by being hit by a pitch, but was then thrown out attempting to steal second. After Doyle struck out, Becker drew a walk but was also thrown out on an attempted steal of second, ending the inning. After the Red Sox went down in order in the bottom of the 11th, the game was called on account of darkness tied at 6, Boston retaining a 1–0 lead in the Series. Though there had been experimental affairs in the minor leagues, night baseball wouldn&#x27;t become a regular fixture in the MLB for another 2 decades. The first night game in World Series history wouldn&#x27;t be played until 1971, 59 years later. The National Commission ruled that the players would still get a share of the gross receipts from only the first four games despite the Game 2 tie, a decision which caused much discontent among the players.

===Game 3===

In the top of the second, Red Murray doubled to center. He advanced to third on a sacrifice bunt by Merkle and scored on a sacrifice fly by Herzog, giving the Giants a 1–0 lead. Three innings later, Herzog doubled and scored on a single by Fletcher, stretching New York&#x27;s lead to 2–0. It stayed that way until the bottom of the ninth. Rube Marquard, who pitched a complete game for the Giants, got Speaker to pop up to start the inning. Lewis followed with a grounder to first baseman Merkle, who flipped to Marquard covering first, but Marquard couldn&#x27;t find the bag and Lewis reached with an infield single. Gardner followed with an RBI double, narrowing the Giant lead to 2–1. First baseman / playing manager Jake Stahl grounded to Marquard, who threw out Gardner at third base for the second out as Stahl took first. Manager Stahl then took himself out of the game for pinch-runner Olaf Henriksen. The next Boston hitter, Heinie Wagner, reached on an error by Merkle, with Henriksen, representing the tying run, advancing to third. Wagner, the potential winning run, then stole second to get into scoring position but the next batter, Hick Cady, lined out to right field to end the game. Although Josh Devore missed the ball with his glove, he managed to catch it with his bare left hand, allowing the Giants to hang on for a 2–1 victory and even the series at a game apiece.

===Game 4===
The Red Sox won 3–1 on Wood&#x27;s complete game, eight-strikeout effort. Boston took a 1–0 lead when Gardner tripled in the second and scored on a wild pitch by Tesreau, who had lost the nail on the middle finger of his right (pitching) hand when a Harry Hooper grounder ripped it off in the first. Boston made it 2–0 on an RBI single by Cady in the fourth. In the seventh, Herzog singled and scored on Fletcher&#x27;s double to cut the lead to 2–1, but in the top of the ninth, Wood helped his own cause with an RBI single. The Giants went down in order in the bottom of the ninth to give Boston a 2–1 series lead.

===Game 5===
The Red Sox scored two quick runs in the bottom of the third against Mathewson when Hooper led off with a triple, Yerkes also tripled, and Speaker reached on an error by Giants second baseman Doyle allowing Yerkes to score. Mathewson then proceeded to retire the next 17 Red Sox batters in a row, but that was all Boston pitcher Hugh Bedient needed. Merkle doubled and came around to score in the seventh inning to make the score 2–1, but Mathewson struck out to end the rally. Bedient retired the last seven Giant hitters in order for a three-hit complete game. Boston now led the Series 3–1, and was one victory away from a championship.

===Game 6===

Boston pitcher Buck O&#x27;Brien, who had pitched well in Game 3 but lost to Marquard, started again in Game 6 and was shelled for five runs in the bottom of the first inning. After left fielder Devore led off the inning with a groundout, Doyle singled and Snodgrass struck out, five Giants hitters in a row hit safely, with Buck Herzog scoring on a steal of home. The inning didn&#x27;t end until O&#x27;Brien picked Fletcher off first base. Marquard took over from there, throwing a complete game for his second victory of the series, and the Giants won 5–2. New York stayed alive, but Boston still led the series 3–2.

Buck O&#x27;Brien started this game over Red Sox ace Wood at the insistence of Red Sox owner Jimmy McAleer, over the protests of Boston manager Stahl. Disgruntled Red Sox players believed their own front office was trying to extend the series and gather more box office receipts by starting a weaker pitcher. O&#x27;Brien, meanwhile, was not told he was pitching until the morning of the 14th, too late to prevent him from going out drinking and starting Game 6 with a hangover.

===Game 7===

Wood, who had pitched and won Games 1 and 4 for the Red Sox, started Game 7 with a chance to win Boston&#x27;s second championship. But in a replay of Game 6, the Giants blew the game open in the first inning. Seven of the first nine Giants batters reached base, and six of them scored. Wood faced ten batters, threw them only 13 pitches and retired only one of them, with the first out coming on a sacrifice and the third when Giant starter Tesreau was caught stealing second. New York cruised from there, winning the only truly lopsided game of the series 11–4. This game featured two &quot;bounce&quot; home runs, one from Gardner of the Red Sox and another from Doyle of the Giants. This type of play, where a ball lands in fair territory and goes over the wall on a bounce, was changed by rule to a ground rule double in 1931. Game 7 also featured an extremely rare unassisted double play by an outfielder. Tris Speaker, who was known for playing very shallow in center field, caught a liner by Fletcher with one out in the top of the ninth inning and ran in, stepping on second to double off Wilson.

The game was delayed because of a demonstration by the Royal Rooters, the primary Red Sox fan organization of the day, because their normal seats on Duffy&#x27;s Cliff had been double-sold to other fans. The Royal Rooters were lined up along the left field foul line since they had indeed paid their way in. They were not satisfied, however. Their leader, Michael &quot;Nuf Ced&quot; McGreevy, led a further demonstration after the game in front of the Red Sox offices and called for a boycott of Game 8.

Wood&#x27;s awful start, the fact that he&#x27;d continued to pitch with a full windup instead of going into the stretch position with Giants on base, and the sloppy play of the Red Sox led to ugly rumors. Boston fans and respected sportswriter Tim Murnane each believed that the Boston players, angry that they didn&#x27;t get a cut from the gate receipts for Game 2 and further alienated by O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s Game 6 start, bet on the Giants to make their losses good. Whatever went down, the Series was tied at 3, setting up a decisive Game 8 for the championship.

===Game 8===

The location of this game was determined by a coin flip, which the Red Sox won. Because this game was scheduled at the last minute as a makeup of the Game 2 tie, and due as well to the game-fixing rumors and the Royal Rooters&#x27; boycott, the riveting finale of the 1912 World Series was played to a half-capacity crowd at Fenway.

Mathewson started for the Giants, and Bedient for the Red Sox. In the Giants&#x27; third inning, Devore led off with a single, advanced on groundouts by Doyle and Snodgrass, and scored on Murray&#x27;s RBI double. New York held on to the 1–0 lead until the bottom of the seventh inning, when Stahl singled with one out and Heinie Wagner drew a walk. Henriksen pinch-hit for pitcher Bedient and doubled to left to tie the game at one, but Hooper flied out to center to end the rally.

Smoky Joe Wood, who had taken a pounding the day before for Boston, replaced Bedient in relief. Wood and Mathewson, still pitching for the Giants, matched zeroes in the eighth and ninth innings, and the game went to extra innings tied 1–1. In the top of the tenth, Murray doubled with one out and scored on an RBI single from Merkle. Wood struck out Herzog and got the Giant catcher, Chief Meyers, to ground out to end the inning, but the game went to the bottom of the tenth with the Giants leading 2–1 and three outs away from a World Series victory.

Clyde Engle, pinch-hitting for Wood, led off with an easy fly ball to Fred Snodgrass in center field. Snodgrass dropped the ball, and Engle reached second base. The next day&#x27;s &quot;New York Times&quot; described the play as follows: &quot;And now the ball settles. It is full and fair in the pouch of the padded glove of Snodgrass. But he is too eager to toss it to Murray and it dribbles to the ground.&quot; Hooper flied out to deep center—Snodgrass making a fine running catch right after his error—but Engle advanced to third. Yerkes was then inexplicably walked by control expert Mathewson, putting the winning run on base. Tris Speaker, who hit an even .300 in the 1912 World Series, lifted a foul pop on the first base side, but first baseman Merkle, pitcher Mathewson, and catcher Meyers allowed the ball to fall untouched in foul territory. Snodgrass later claimed that the Red Sox bench jockeys had disrupted the players&#x27; timing. Strangely, Mathewson called for catcher Meyers to take it even though Merkle was closer. Meyers couldn&#x27;t reach it and it fell to the ground. Speaker then shouted, &quot;Well, you just called for the wrong man and it&#x27;s gonna cost you the ball game!&quot; Given new life, he singled home Engle to tie it at 2, Yerkes advancing to third. Mathewson walked Lewis intentionally, loading the bases and setting up a force at every base, but the next hitter, Larry Gardner, flied to Devore in right field deep enough for Yerkes to tag up and score, and the Red Sox won the 1912 World Series.

==Legacy==

Fred Snodgrass’s error went down in history as &quot;the $30,000 muff&quot;, a reference to the difference in the winning and losing shares, $29,514.34. After the series Snodgrass tried to explain, saying &quot;I didn&#x27;t seem to be able to hold the ball. It just dropped out of the glove, and that was all there was to it.&quot;

Christy Mathewson later wrote that &quot;As I look back upon the 1912 series, when we lost to the Boston Red Sox, I see it was the same. Pitchers, outfielders, the whole team collapsed under the strain.&quot; He had been ill-served by his team&#x27;s defense. Five New York errors led to all six runs&#x27; being unearned in the Game 2 tie, an error scored the second run in Boston&#x27;s 2–1 Game 5 victory and Snodgrass&#x27;s $30,000 muff, along with the failure to catch Speaker&#x27;s foul pop, resulted in the loss in Game 8. Mathewson started three games, completed all three and compiled a 0.94 earned-run average for the Series, but was charged with two losses and a no-decision for his efforts. The 1912 World Series was the second of three consecutive Fall Classic appearances for the Giants, all of which they lost, and Mathewson retired in 1916 with the 1905 championship the only one of his brilliant career, in which he pitched three complete-game shutouts for 27 scoreless innings, Series records that may never be equaled.

After the Series was over, McAleer issued a statement apologizing to the Royal Rooters for selling their Game 7 seats out from under them. The Red Sox victory in 1912 marked the beginning of the most successful run in franchise history. Between 1912 and 1918, they played in four World Series and won all of them. But after star pitcher/outfielder Babe Ruth was sold to the Yankees following the 1919 season, Boston had to wait 28 years for its next pennant and 86 years for its next World Series victory.

The 1912 World Series was the first to be decided in the last inning of the final game. It was also the first Series where a team within one inning of losing came back to win. The next time a team that close to elimination recovered to win was the 1985 World Series, when the Kansas City Royals rallied in the bottom of the ninth to beat the St. Louis Cardinals in Game 6, then won Game 7 and the championship. Other World Series that have ended with a Game 7 (or in this case Game 8, due to the tie) going to extra innings include the Series of , , , and . Other World Series won by the home team in its last at-bat in a Game 7 include the Series of 1924, , 1991, 1997, and .

It was at Game 4 of this Series that the World Series drew its 1,000,000th fan. The total attendance for this Series of 252,037 shattered the previous mark of 179,851 set the previous year, though the fact that this World Series went eight games, compared to six in 1911, was the difference. The total attendance record for this Series would stand as a record until 1921, when 269,977 attended the 1921 World Series, the first with Babe Ruth as an everyday player. Like this World Series, the 1921 World Series also went eight games, though unlike this World Series, which was a best-of-seven, the 1921 World Series was a best-of-nine.

The 1912 World Series was discussed at length in the 1966 book &quot;The Glory of Their Times&quot;, which featured interviews with Harry Hooper, Rube Marquard, Chief Meyers, Fred Snodgrass, and Smoky Joe Wood.

The 1913 &quot;Spalding&#x27;s Official Baseball Guide&quot; said of the 1912 World Series, &quot;No individual, whether player, manager, owner, critic or spectator, who went through the world&#x27;s series of 1912 ever will forget it. There never was another like it. Years may elapse before there shall be a similar series and it may be that the next to come will be equally sensational, perhaps more so.&quot;

<text>Mark William Chmura (born February 22, 1969) is an American former professional football player who was a tight end for the Green Bay Packers of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Boston College Eagles, earning first-team All-American honors in 1991. He was selected by Green Bay in the sixth round (157th overall) of the 1992 NFL draft. He played his entire career with the Packers. During his playing career, his nickname was &quot;Chewy&quot;. He won Super Bowl XXXI with the Packers against his hometown team, the New England Patriots.

==College career==
Before his NFL career, Chmura began (and eventually ended) his career at Frontier Regional High School. Chmura then played for Boston College, where he set a school record with 164 receptions. The record has since been broken, but his mark is still 4th in school history. His 2,046 yards is also sixth in school history.

===College statistics===
==Professional career==
Chmura was drafted in the sixth round of the 1992 NFL draft, and selected to the Pro Bowl in 1995, 1997, and 1998. He played for the Packers from 1992 to 1999, whom he assisted to Super Bowl XXXI and Super Bowl XXXII. He scored the final points of Super Bowl XXXI with a 2-point conversion catch, and he finished Super Bowl XXXII with 4 catches for 43 yards and a touchdown.

In 1997, Chmura chose not to meet with United States President Bill Clinton at the White House following the Packers Super Bowl XXXI win. While many claimed that this was because Chmura was a staunch Republican, the meeting fell on the same day as the annual Mike Utley golf tournament. The tournament is something that Chmura had played in every year since 1992 to honor former Detroit Lion player Mike Utley who had been paralyzed on the field.

Chmura suffered a career-ending herniation of his C5 and C6 discs in his cervical spine. Chmura was released by the Packers in 2000. After his release, he attempted a comeback, with the Washington Redskins and the New Orleans Saints showing interest, but suffered a relapse of the injury while working out in his weight room and retired. In 8 seasons with the Packers, Chmura finished his career in third place all-time in franchise history among tight ends with 188 receptions 2,253 yards, and 17 touchdowns in 89 games. In 2010, he was inducted into the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame.

==Personal life==
===Legal trouble===
On April 8, 2000, Chmura was accused of sexually assaulting the 17-year-old babysitter of his children. Chmura was tried but found not guilty of all charges. Two days after being acquitted of child enticement and third-degree sexual assault, Chmura acknowledged that his behavior at a post-prom party &quot;wasn&#x27;t something a married man should do.&quot;

===Post-football career===
In 2004, Chmura began hosting a Sunday morning Packers pregame show on ESPN 540 in Milwaukee and is still presently hosting the show each week. In 2019, he began hosting the Gabe &amp; Chewy Show with Gabe Neitzel during weekday mornings on WAUK. In 2020 the station moved to 94.5 WKTI in a format switch and they added sportscaster and Marquette University alum Jen Lada to create the Jen, Gabe, &amp; Chewy show which still airs as of 2023.

From 2005 to 2009, Chmura worked as a research assistant for the Boyle Law Group. He was also an assistant football coach at Waukesha West High School, where his son, Dylan, played tight end, and son Dyson also played at Waukesha West. Dylan also played for Michigan State University. In 2017, Chmura was hired as the offensive coordinator of Greenfield High School under head coach Keith Ringelberg.

In 2010, Mark Chmura was inducted into the Packers Hall of Fame.

In 2011, Chmura married his wife. He resides in Wisconsin with his family. Along with his wife, he owned a chain of auto collision repair businesses. In 2020, these businesses were sold.

<text>The 1913 [[World Series]] was the championship series in Major League Baseball for the 1913 season. The tenth edition of the World Series, it matched the American League (AL) champion Philadelphia Athletics against the National League (NL) New York Giants. The Athletics won the Series four games to one.

The A&#x27;s pitching gave the edge to a closer-than-it-looked Series in 1913. Christy Mathewson lost his Series swan song in the final game to an old college rival and eventual fellow Baseball Hall of Fame member, Eddie Plank. With previous victories in 1910 and 1911, the Athletics became the first team to win three World Series.

The Giants, meanwhile, became the first National League team since the Chicago Cubs (–) to win three consecutive pennants. They were also the second club (following the Detroit Tigers –) to lose three consecutive World Series; and remain the last to do so.

The Series itself was a face-off between two teams that later became crosstown rivals in Oakland and San Francisco. The Oakland A&#x27;s won again in a four-game sweep in the 1989 World Series, famous for the earthquake that struck before Game 3, which is the last World Series victory for the A&#x27;s.

==Summary==
==Matchups==
===Game 1===
In the opener, Home Run Baker drove in three runs with three hits for the A&#x27;s, including a home run. Eddie Collins went 3-for-3 and scored three runs. Despite giving up four runs and 11 hits, Chief Bender held on for a 6–4 win. The Giants struck first in the bottom of the third when Fred Merkle hit a leadoff single, moved to second on a sacrifice bunt, and scored on Larry Doyle&#x27;s single, but in the fourth, Eddie Collins hit a leadoff triple and scored on Baker&#x27;s single. After a fielder&#x27;s choice and double, Wally Schang&#x27;s triple scored two more runs. Baker&#x27;s two-run home run after a walk in the fifth made it 5–1 Philadelphia. The Giants cut the lead to 5–4 in the bottom of the inning when after two singles and a groundout, an error Doyle&#x27;s ground ball, Art Fletcher&#x27;s RBI single, and George Burns&#x27;s groundout scored a run each. The A&#x27;s got an insurance run in the eighth off of Doc Crandall on Stuffy McInnis&#x27;s RBI double.

===Game 2===
Mathewson and Plank matched craft and guile. In the bottom of the ninth inning of a scoreless game, the Giants put on a stirring baseball version of the &quot;goal-line stand&quot;. With none out, the A&#x27;s had Amos Strunk on third and Jack Barry on second. The next batter, Jack Lapp, grounded to first, where Hooks Wiltse, a pitcher, was filling in. Wiltse made a good stop and threw home to nab Strunk. With Barry on third now and Lapp on first, Plank grounded to Wiltse and Hooks fired home again, getting a sliding Barry. Mathewson retired the next hitter, and the game went into extra innings. In the top of the tenth the Giants broke the ice with three runs, with Mathewson singling in the winning run after a leadoff single and sacrifice bunt and then completing the extra-inning shutout by retiring the A&#x27;s in their half of the tenth. After Mathewson&#x27;s single, an error and hit-by-pitch loaded the bases before Art Fletcher drove in two insurance runs with a single.

===Game 3===


Eddie Collins had three hits and three RBI, and Bullet Joe Bush threw a five-hitter to put the A&#x27;s ahead in the series. Jeff Tesreau allowed three straight one-out singles in the first, the last of which to Home Run Baker scoring a run. After a double steal and strike out, and error on Amos Strunk&#x27;s ground ball scored two more runs. The A&#x27;s made it 5–0 next inning on Eddie Collins&#x27;s two-run single. The Giants got on the board in the fifth when Red Murray drew a leadoff walk, stole second, moved to third on an error and scored on Larry McLean&#x27;s single. The A&#x27;s added to their lead in the seventh when Collins&#x27;s triple and Home Run Baker&#x27;s single scored a run each. The Giants scored their last run of the game in the bottom of the inning when Tillie Shafer hit a leadoff double and scored on Red Murray&#x27;s single. Wally Schang&#x27;s home run in the eighth off of Doc Crandall closed the scoring at 8–2 A&#x27;s.

===Game 4===

The home team won for the first time in the series, although the visiting Giants made it close in the late innings. Wally Schang had four RBI for the A&#x27;s, they now had a 3–1 series lead. Just like in Game 1, Bender struggled but went the distance for his second win of the series. The A&#x27;s struck first in the bottom of the second when Stuffy McInnis hit a leadoff single, moved to second on a sacrifice bunt and scored on Jack Barry&#x27;s double. In the fourth, Wally Schang&#x27;s single scored two and an error on Chief Bender&#x27;s ground ball scored another. Next inning, after a two-out walk and double off of Rube Marquard, Wally Schang&#x27;s two-run double made it 6–0 A&#x27;s. The Giants were kept off the scoreboard until Fred Merkle&#x27;s three-run home run in the seventh. They cut Philadelphia&#x27;s lead to 6–5 next inning when George Burns&#x27;s double and Tillie Shafer&#x27;s triple scored a run each, but could not score again.

===Game 5===

Plank led the Athletics to victory, allowing the Giants only two hits, but his own error in the fifth inning cost him a shutout. The A&#x27;s scored a run in the first on Home Run Baker&#x27;s sacrifice fly with runners on first and third, then scored two more in the third on Baker&#x27;s single and Stuffy McInnis&#x27;s sacrifice fly. The Giants avoided a shutout in the fifth on Larry McLean&#x27;s RBI single.

This was the A&#x27;s third series title in four years. They had also won in 1910 and 1911.

<doc id="1332236" wikidata="Q287928" url="?curid=1332236" title="Epigenes (crater)">
<text>Epigenes is a lunar impact crater that is located in the north part of the Moon, and is sufficiently close to the northern limb to appear significantly foreshortened from the Earth. It lies just to the northwest of the remains of the walled plain W. Bond. Due north of Epigenes is Goldschmidt, and the ruined crater Birmingham lies just to the southwest.

This formation is a picture in contrasts. The north and northwest parts of the rim are well-formed with little appearance of wear, while the remainder of the rim is notably eroded, particularly in the east-southeastern half. The western half of the interior floor is smooth and nearly featureless, while the remainder is somewhat hummocky and appears covered in ejecta from the east. The small crater Epigenes B intrudes into the northeastern rim.

Epigenes is a crater of Nectarian age.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Epigenes.

<doc id="1332263" wikidata="Q4295893" url="?curid=1332263" title="1968 World Series">
<text>The 1968 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball&#x27;s (MLB) 1968 season. The 65th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff between the American League (AL) champion Detroit Tigers and the National League (NL) champion (and defending World Series champion) St. Louis Cardinals. The Tigers won in seven games for their first championship since 1945, and the third in their history.

The Tigers came back from a three-games-to-one deficit to win three consecutive games, largely on the arm of Mickey Lolich, who was named World Series Most Valuable Player (MVP); , he remains the last pitcher to earn three complete-game victories in a single World Series. In his third appearance in the Series, Lolich had to pitch after only two days&#x27; rest in the deciding Game 7, because regular-season 31-game winner Denny McLain was moved up to Game 6 – also on two days&#x27; rest. In Game 5, the Tigers&#x27; hopes for the title would have been in jeopardy had Bill Freehan not tagged out Lou Brock in a home plate collision, on a perfect throw from left fielder Willie Horton, when Brock elected not to slide and went in standing up.

The 1968 season was tagged &quot;The Year of the Pitcher&quot;, and the Series featured dominant performances from Cardinals pitcher Bob Gibson, MVP of the 1964 and 1967 World Series. Gibson came into the World Series with a regular-season earned run average (ERA) of just 1.12, a modern era record, and he pitched complete games in Games 1, 4, and 7. He was the winning pitcher in Games 1 and 4. In Game 1, he threw a shutout, striking out a Series record 17 batters, besting Sandy Koufax&#x27;s 1963 record by two; it still stands as the World Series record today. In Game 4, a solo home run by Jim Northrup was the only offense the Tigers were able to muster, as Gibson struck out ten batters. In Game 7, Gibson was defeated by series MVP Lolich, allowing three runs on four straight hits in the seventh inning, although the key play was a Northrup triple that was seemingly misplayed by center fielder Curt Flood and could have been the third out with no runs scoring.

The World Series saw the Cardinals lose a Game 7 for the first time in their history. This was the sixth World Series of the 1960s to go to a full seven games, the most of any decade. The Tigers were the third team to come back from a three-games-to-one deficit to win a best-of-seven World Series, the first two being the 1925 Pirates and the 1958 Yankees; since then, the 1979 Pirates, the 1985 Royals, and the 2016 Cubs have also accomplished this feat.

Detroit manager Mayo Smith received some notoriety for moving outfielder Mickey Stanley to shortstop for the 1968 World Series, which has been called one of the gutsiest coaching moves in sports history by multiple sources. Stanley, who replaced the superior fielding but much weaker hitting Ray Oyler, would make two errors in the Series, neither of which led to a run.

This was also the final World Series played prior to MLB&#x27;s 1969 expansion, which coincided with the introduction of divisional play and the League Championship Series. Thus, it was the final World Series that guaranteed the teams with the best records from each league would be playing.

All seven games of NBC&#x27;s TV coverage were preserved on black-and-white kinescopes by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, and circulate among collectors. Games 1 and 5 have been commercially released; these broadcasts, and that of Game 7, were frequently shown on CSN (Classic Sports Network) and ESPN Classic in the 1990s and 2000s.

Tigers pitcher Mickey Lolich was named World Series MVP. Lolich compiled a 3-0 record (all three of his starts were complete games), with a 1.67 ERA and 21 strikeouts.

==Summary==

==Matchups==

===Game 1===


The Tigers roared into Game 1 by setting a then-team record with 103 victories on the season and were appearing in their first World Series in 23 years. The Tigers led the American League with 185 home runs, led by left fielder Willie Horton with 36 and first baseman Norm Cash and catcher Bill Freehan added 25 each. Their team batting average was .235, fourth best in the league; the team stole only 26 bases on the year, with Dick McAuliffe leading the team with only eight. The Cardinals, on the other hand, stole 110 bases (led by Hall of Famer Lou Brock with 68), led the NL with 48 triples, and had a team batting average of .249, but hit only 73 home runs and had only two players, Orlando Cepeda and Mike Shannon with double-digit totals. Pitching was about even as both teams set their rotations for Game 1 with solid starters and adequate relievers.

Fans overflowed Busch Stadium for Game 1 to watch the highly anticipated match-up of the Major League&#x27;s top two pitchers—the Cardinals&#x27; Bob Gibson (22–9, 1.12 ERA) and the Tigers&#x27; Denny McLain (31–6, 1.96 ERA). Gibson was looking to become the first National League pitcher to win six World Series games while McLain was pitching in his first World Series game. The Cardinals had far more World Series experience than the Tigers with most of the Cardinal lineup (including all nine Game 1 starters) having played in a prior World Series. The Cardinals had won the World Series the year prior in 1967 and had also won in 1964. Both pitchers were highly competitive, fast workers, sporting overpowering fastballs coupled with excellent control.

Gibson&#x27;s performance in Game 1 was phenomenal. The menacing right-handed pitcher shut out the Tigers on just five hits, and he struck out a World Series-record 17 Detroit Tigers batters.

The Cardinals broke through with three in the fourth off McLain. After McLain walked Roger Maris and Tim McCarver, Cardinal third baseman Mike Shannon singled in Maris and went to second base when Tiger left fielder Willie Horton misplayed the ball. McCarver pulled in at third. Cardinal second baseman Julián Javier followed this by singling in both baserunners to make the score 3–0. Outfielder Lou Brock added a home run in the seventh inning to complete the scoring.

Gibson finished the game in the ninth inning with his 15th, 16th, and 17th strikeouts to pass Sandy Koufax&#x27;s previous record of 15, set in the 1963 World Series.

===Game 2===


The Tigers&#x27; starting pitcher Mickey Lolich earned a complete-game victory and the Tigers tied the Series.

Tiger outfielder Willie Horton hit a home run in the second inning; Lolich also helped his own cause with a homer in the third inning off the Cardinals&#x27; starter, Nelson Briles, scoring the eventual game-winning run. This was the only home run that Lolich hit during his entire professional career. The Tigers broke the game open in the sixth inning when first baseman Norm Cash led off with another homer, and second baseman Dick McAuliffe later provided a two-run single.

Cardinal first baseman Orlando Cepeda gave St. Louis a run with an RBI single in the sixth, but that was all they scored. Al Kaline scored in the seventh inning when Jim Northrup hit into a double play, and the Tigers scored their final two runs in the ninth inning with bases-loaded walks to Don Wert and Lolich.

===Game 3===


In the first of three games at Detroit&#x27;s Tiger Stadium, Al Kaline started the scoring with a two-run homer in the third inning, but the Cardinals came back in the fifth inning on an RBI double by center fielder Curt Flood off starter Earl Wilson. After Wilson put another batter on base, catcher Tim McCarver launched a three-run home run for the eventual game-winning runs off relief pitcher Pat Dobson. The Tigers cut the deficit to just one run on a home run by Dick McAuliffe. But Orlando Cepeda put the game out of reach in the seventh inning by smacking a three-run home run.

The Cardinals&#x27; reliever Joe Hoerner entered the game in the sixth in relief of Ray Washburn (who got the win) and earned a save with three scoreless innings pitched. Hoerner also collected a single batting in the eighth and became the first major leaguer to get a hit in the World Series after going hitless for the entire season.

===Game 4===


Tiger manager Mayo Smith, needing another left-handed bat in the lineup, made a major change by inserting veteran Eddie Mathews at third base. Mathews, recovering from a spinal operation that nearly ended his career, had one hit in the last game of his major league career. After a 35-minute rain delay, hard-hitting Hall-of-Famer Hank Greenberg threw out the first pitch.

McLain had trouble warming up amidst the rainfall, and was throwing with less velocity from the outset. A 31-game winner during the regular season, he struggled for the second time in this World Series, as this one-sided pitching match-up with Bob Gibson showed. Lou Brock led the game off with a home run, and Mike Shannon added an RBI single later in the first inning. Two more Cardinals runs were knocked in during the third inning on Tim McCarver&#x27;s triple and Mike Shannon&#x27;s double. McLain&#x27;s troubles continued, and after a walk to Julián Javier, the umpires stopped the game due to rain with two out in the third inning. McLain did not return when play resumed after a one-hour and 15-minute rain delay. Bob Gibson did return after the delay, and helped his own cause by hitting a home run off Joe Sparma in the fourth inning. Next, Lou Brock knocked a triple and scored on a ground-out by Roger Maris.

The Cardinals&#x27; final runs came in the eighth inning when Gibson walked with the bases loaded, forcing in one run, and then Lou Brock drove in three more runs with a double. Brock was just a single short of hitting for the cycle in this game.

The Tigers&#x27; only run came in the fourth inning when Jim Northrup hit a home run. Other than that, Gibson was a nearly perfect pitcher, tossing his second complete game in this World Series while striking out ten batters. The Cards now had a commanding 3–1 series lead.

===Game 5===


With the World Series on the line, the Tigers used their winner of Game 2, Mickey Lolich, as their starting pitcher. Lolich&#x27;s first inning in this game was not too promising, as he allowed an RBI single by Curt Flood and a two-run home run to Orlando Cepeda. However, Lolich soon settled down, striking out eight Cardinal batters and allowing no more runs.

Tigers&#x27; first baseman Norm Cash began the team comeback with a sacrifice fly in the fourth inning, plating Mickey Stanley who had tripled. This was followed by a Willie Horton triple and Jim Northrup&#x27;s RBI single, making it a 3–2 game. In the fifth inning, the Cardinals had a chance to go up by two runs after Lou Brock hit a one-out double. Cardinal second baseman Julián Javier followed with a base hit to left. Outfielder Willie Horton fielded the ball off the ground and then fired the ball towards home plate. Instead of sliding into home plate, Brock tried to bowl over Tiger catcher Bill Freehan. However, Freehan caught and held onto the ball while blocking the corner of the plate with his foot, and Brock was called out. This was the last time that the Cardinals threatened to score in the game.

The Cardinals&#x27; starting pitcher Nelson Briles was taken out of the game in the seventh inning with one runner on base, and was replaced by reliever Joe Hoerner. After Hoerner loaded the bases, the Tigers began a game-winning rally, with Al Kaline hitting a two-run single to give his team a 4–3 lead. Norm Cash then knocked in an insurance run with a single.

Jose Feliciano&#x27;s unconventional pre-game singing of &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; aroused considerable controversy, with the Tigers and NBC receiving thousands of angry letters and telephone calls about the performance. Lolich also blamed Feliciano&#x27;s unusually long rendition for causing him to get cold after his warm-ups and thus give up three early runs.

===Game 6===


Now needing two wins in St. Louis to win the World Series, Tiger manager Mayo Smith chose Denny McLain again as his starting pitcher, even though he had only two days&#x27; rest and had not been very successful in his two prior Series starts. Cardinals&#x27; manager Red Schoendienst stayed with his normal three-starter rotation, selecting Ray Washburn, who had won Game 3. The choice of McLain paid off for the Tigers, as he pitched a complete game in a 13–1 rout of the Cardinals.

The Tigers went up 2–0 in the second inning on RBI hits by Willie Horton and Bill Freehan. In the third, the Tigers sent 15 batters to the plate and scored 10 runs off of three Cardinals pitchers. Jim Northrup&#x27;s grand slam highlighted the inning. Al Kaline added a home run in the fifth inning. The Cardinals&#x27; lone run came off an RBI single by Julián Javier with two outs in the bottom of the ninth, but that was all they could do against McLain.

===Game 7===


In a fitting end to this Series (and the final game of Roger Maris&#x27; career) the two teams&#x27; hottest pitchers, Mickey Lolich and Bob Gibson, squared off in a classic duel, until an infamous hit over the head of Curt Flood. Like McLain in Game 6, Lolich was starting on only two days&#x27; rest.

Lolich and Gibson matched zeroes for six innings, but in the top of the seventh, Gibson surrendered two-out singles to Norm Cash and Willie Horton. Jim Northrup then hit a hard smash to deep center; Curt Flood, who won numerous Gold Glove awards in his career, misjudged it and briefly started in on the ball before turning around to go back. The ball one-hopped the warning track, two runs scored, Northrup wound up with a triple, and Lolich had all the runs he needed. Flood has been criticized by some who believe he would have caught the ball had his first steps been back instead of in. Jim Northrup said, &quot;[Flood] slipped a little, but the ball was 40 feet over his head. He never had a chance to catch it.&quot; However, his teammate Denny McLain claimed in his 1975 book that &quot;Flood blew it.&quot; Orlando Cepeda, in his 1998 autobiography &quot;Baby Bull&quot;, asserts that Flood would have caught the ball, had he not misjudged it. In the October 29, 1968, issue of &quot;The Sporting News&quot;, both Flood and manager Red Schoendienst indicated they would have expected the normally sure-handed outfielder to catch such a ball. By starting in, Flood had to both reverse direction and then regain his acceleration. He then slipped on the wet grass before recovering his speed, and by that time the ball was well beyond him. Bill Freehan then doubled in Northrup, and in the top of the ninth, Don Wert added an RBI single.

The Cardinals got a run in the ninth on a Mike Shannon homer, but that was all as Lolich pitched his third complete game. The final out of the series was recorded when Bill Freehan caught a pop foul off the very next batter, Tim McCarver. Gibson struck out eight in the losing cause, giving him a record 35 strikeouts by one pitcher in a World Series, but Lolich was named World Series MVP. This is the last World Series game to date to feature complete games from both starting pitchers.

Cardinals shortstop Dal Maxvill went hitless in 22 World Series at-bats, a record.

<doc id="1332272" wikidata="Q4572071" url="?curid=1332272" title="1965 World Series">
<text>The 1965 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball&#x27;s (MLB) 1965 season. The 62nd edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff that matched the National League champion Los Angeles Dodgers against the American League champion Minnesota Twins. The Dodgers won in seven games. 

The series is best remembered for the heroics of Sandy Koufax, who was named the World Series Most Valuable Player. Koufax did not pitch in Game 1, as it fell on the Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur. He pitched well but lost Game 2 before going on to toss shutouts in Games 5 and 7 (with only two days of rest in between) to win the championship.

The Twins had won their first pennant in Minnesota and the franchise’s first since 1933 when the team was known as the Washington Senators. The Dodgers won their second title in three years, and their third since moving to Los Angeles in 1958.

==Background==
Both teams improved from sixth-place finishes in 1964; the Twins won the A.L. pennant with relative ease while the Dodgers were locked in a season-long five-way battle in the N.L. among themselves, the Giants, Pirates, Reds, and Braves. After the Giants won their 14th-consecutive game to take a -game lead on September 16, the Dodgers went on a 13-game winning streak over the final two weeks of the season to clinch the pennant on the next to last day of the season over the second place rival Giants.

During the 1965 season, the Dodgers relied heavily on the arms of Sandy Koufax and Don Drysdale, and would rely on them even more in the World Series, as the Dodgers only used seven pitchers. The Dodgers&#x27; strong core of pitchers, which also included Claude Osteen and Ron Perranoski, kept them in the pennant race and into the Series. Koufax, surviving on a steady diet of Cortisone and pain killers for his arthritic left elbow, pitched five times in 15 days down the stretch, winning four (three shutouts), including 13 strikeouts in the pennant winner against Milwaukee.

Dodger hitting however remained strictly popgun, especially after Tommy Davis went down in late April for the season with a broken ankle. Manager Walter Alston promptly called up 12-year minor league veteran Lou Johnson from Spokane. Johnson led the Dodgers, along with ROY Jim Lefebvre, in home runs with just 12.

The Twins, managed by Sam Mele, had a more balanced attack, equally strong in pitching and hitting, although their defense committed 173 errors including 39 by shortstop Zoilo Versalles. Offensively Mele again had balance with good hitting, power and speed up and down his lineup that included the AL&#x27;s leading hitter (Tony Oliva, at .321), and 20-plus home runs from five different players, including top-level slugger Harmon Killebrew, normally good for 40+ per year, though limited to 25 in 1965 due to missing nearly two months of the season with an injury. Pitching was spearheaded by 21-game winner Mudcat Grant, Jim Kaat, and Camilo Pascual.

This was only the second World Series where both teams were located west of the Mississippi River. The first occurred in 1944, when the St. Louis Browns faced their Sportsman&#x27;s Park tenants, the St. Louis Cardinals.

This was the first of 11 consecutive World Series that did not have the New York Yankees playing in it.

It was also the first series in which both teams had had losing records the previous year. This has since been repeated two other times, both times also involving the Twins—in their championship seasons of and .

This World Series was the first in which all games were played in cities that did not have National League or American League teams in 1903, the year of the first modern World Series.

Also, it is the earliest World Series whose telecasts are known to survive in their entirety; the CBC has complete kinescopes of all seven games in its archives. 

==Summary==
The Twins won the first two games of the series against Don Drysdale and Sandy Koufax, but once Claude Osteen shut out the Twins in Game 3, things turned around. Willie Davis of The Dodgers tied a World Series record stealing 3 bases in one Game, game 5; the record was set by Honus Wagner in 1909. The Dodgers proceeded to win the three middle games at Dodger Stadium and Koufax would pitch two shutouts including a three-hitter with ten strikeouts to clinch. Ron Fairly hit two home runs for the Dodgers, both in losing efforts.

==Matchups==

===Game 1===
Game 1 was set to be a pitching duel between Dodgers&#x27; Don Drysdale and the Twins&#x27; Mudcat Grant (21–7, 3.30 ERA on the year). Drysdale was starting because the game fell on Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the year in the Jewish calendar. Dodger ace Sandy Koufax, who is Jewish, stated he would not pitch that day.

In the Twins&#x27; third inning any thought of a pitchers&#x27; duel was put to rest. Going into that inning, it was 1–1. Coming out, it was 7–1. It started with a Frank Quilici double to left field, followed by an error by Jim Lefebvre, allowing the pitcher Grant to reach. Then, shortstop Zoilo Versalles stepped to the plate. He had hit 19 home runs in the regular season and would later win the AL MVP Award for that year. He crushed a pitch from Drysdale for a three-run home run to make the score, 4–1. However, the Twins&#x27; scoring wasn&#x27;t over. With still no one out, left fielder Sandy Valdespino began things again with a double. After a few outs and baserunners, and a single by Harmon Killebrew, the Twins had two runners again. With three straight singles (Earl Battey, Don Mincher, and Quilici), scoring three unearned runs, the Twins had jumped out to a six-run lead and would never look back, winning the game 8–2.

Frank Quilici set a World Series record with his two hits in the third inning. Mudcat Grant was the first black World Series game-winner for an American League team.

The Dodgers had scored their runs on a Ron Fairly homer and a Maury Wills bunt single that scored Lefebvre. Grant received the win while Drysdale took the loss.

===Game 2===


In Game 2, the Twins this time got to Dodger ace Sandy Koufax. Minnesota&#x27;s pitcher, this time Jim Kaat, again shut down the Dodgers&#x27; weak offense. A heavy rain storm soaked Metropolitan Stadium overnight, and the two teams slogged their way through the first five innings. In the top of the fifth, Ron Fairly singled, then left-fielder Bob Allison made a diving, sliding catch of a fly ball off the bat of Jim Lefebvre, preventing a run. Aided by an error, the Twins broke the scoreless tie in the sixth, Versalles hit a missile shot and when Jim Gilliam bobbled the ball at third base, the ball ricocheted off Gilliam and into left field. Versalles reached on the two-base error, then scored on a Tony Oliva double. Killebrew followed with a single, plating Oliva. That is all the runs the Twins would need, though Kaat added insurance in the eighth with a two-run base hit of his own. The Twins went up 2–0 in the Series.

===Game 3===


In Game 3, pressure was on Claude Osteen to have a good start so Los Angeles would not go down 0–3. He faced Camilo Pascual, who had a quality (though somewhat injury plagued) year (9–3, 3.35 ERA). Dodger Stadium was filled to capacity and fans were treated to an appearance from Casey Stengel, a member of the 1916 Dodgers World Series team. Stengel, sans his cane despite a broken hip, hobbled on to the field and threw out the first pitch.

In the first inning, Versalles led off with a double. But with two men on, Versalles was caught stealing home on the front end of an attempted double steal. In the fourth, John Roseboro put the Dodgers on the board with a two-run single. The play cost the Dodgers dearly, Jim Lefebvre bruising his heel crossing the plate with the second of the two runs. The Dodgers, already short on hitting (Lefebvre was batting .400 at the time), went with Dick Tracewski (.118 for the Series) at second base the rest of the way. The Twins received a scare of their own in the seventh inning. Catcher Earl Battey, chasing a popup, collided full speed with the railing used to cover sub-field level &quot;dugout seats&quot; next to the Twins dugout. Battey crumpled in a heap holding his neck and was replaced by Jerry Zimmerman. Los Angeles continued to score runs on a Willie Davis single and a Lou Johnson double in the fifth, then a Wills double in the sixth.

Osteen, who as a pitcher for the Senators had had a perfect 5–0 record against the Twins, completed the game by getting Zimmerman to ground into a double play. He allowed only five hits, succeeding where the Dodger aces hadn&#x27;t in Games 1 and 2.

===Game 4===


In a rematch of Game 1 pitchers Drysdale and Grant, the Dodgers ace prevailed, allowing only two runs on five hits. He had eleven strikeouts, fanning Jimmie Hall and Don Mincher three times each. Grant gave up three runs in the first five innings, then was removed in the sixth, when the Dodgers got three more.

The Twins opened the game with aggression when Sandy Valdespino tried to stretch a single into a double. Lou Johnson, not known as a great fielder, gunned down Valdespino at second. The Dodgers scored twice without getting the ball out of the infield. Maury Wills collided at first base with Twins second baseman Frank Quilici on an infield single as pitcher Grant was slow to cover the bag. The play cartwheeled Wills backwards, but the Dodger dusted himself off and promptly stole second. Wills went to third on another infield single, this time by the speedy Willie Davis, as Grant was again slow to cover. Wills scored when Ron Fairly beat out a potential double-play grounder.

In the bottom of the second, Dodger speed made up for what seemed a lack of power. Parker bunted a single, then stole second and took third when Grant&#x27;s throw went wild. Parker scored when Roseboro&#x27;s grounder to second got through Quilici.

The Dodgers then showed power with Parker and Johnson home runs. The Twins had scored their two runs on home runs from Killebrew and Oliva. Back in form, Drysdale evened the series as L.A. won, 7–2.

===Game 5===


In Game 5, the Minnesota pitcher who had done so well in Game 2, Jim Kaat, did not do as well this time, as the Dodgers won their third straight. Koufax gave up only four hits and one walk, striking out ten. Kaat gave up two runs quickly in the first inning, then again in the third. Dave Boswell came in to attempt to stop the bleeding and Jim Perry did the same. Koufax basically put the game out of reach in the seventh, when he helped himself out with an RBI single to score Fairly. The Dodger&#x27;s win put them up 3–2 in the series.

In the first inning, Dodger speed forced the Twins into fielding mishaps. Wills doubled and Gilliam singled in the run. Willie Davis bunted and third-baseman Killebrew&#x27;s hurried throw to first went high, enabling the streaking Davis to make it all the way to third and plating Gilliam. The Dodgers collected 14 hits and four stolen bases, while Koufax steadily kept the Twins in check for the shutout.

===Game 6===


In Game 6, Osteen did not fare as well as he had in his last start. In the fourth inning, Battey reached on an error by Dick Tracewski, followed by a Bob Allison two-run home run. Grant, for the Twins, was on his game once again. He also helped himself, as had Koufax for L.A. the game before, but in this case with a towering three-run home run, after Quilici was intentionally walked to get to Grant. A Fairly home run, his second of the series, put the Dodgers on the board to make the score 5–1, but that&#x27;s all they would get as Grant pitched a complete game.

Twins manager Sam Mele chose to leave veteran pitchers Camilo Pascual and Jim Perry and youngster Jim Merritt in the bullpen, instead going with Grant on two days&#x27; rest. Twins catcher Earl Battey brought the nearly 50,000 Metropolitan Stadium fans to their feet by leading off the second inning with a triple past a diving Willie Davis in center. Battey showed no outward ill-effects of his collision with the railing in Game 3, diving headfirst into third base on the play. However, he didn´t score, as Osteen struck out Allison and Quilici. Battey continued his fine play in the fourth by hustling to first when Tracewski booted his groundball, and Allison followed with a home run. Grant pitched solidly and the Twins tied the series at 3–3.

In this game, Mudcat Grant became just the seventh pitcher to homer in a World Series game.

===Game 7===


Dodger manager Walt Alston was torn between starting Drysdale on normal rest or Koufax with only two days&#x27; rest. He decided on the left-handed Koufax, figuring if needed he would use the right-handed Drysdale in relief, then go back to his left-handed relief ace Ron Perranoski. Koufax told announcer Vin Scully in a post-game interview that he and Drysdale had come to the ballpark not knowing which one would be on the mound (though other sources indicated that Alston had informed Koufax the day before but asked him to keep it a secret). According to Koufax, the manager announced the decision purely in strategic terms regarding lefty vs. righty, saying he worded his announcement without even using the pitchers&#x27; names, saying only that he thought he&#x27;d &quot;like to start the left-hander.&quot; The Twins went with Jim Kaat, also starting on two days&#x27; rest after losing game 5. Both managers had relief pitchers warming up as their starters began the game.

Koufax had trouble throwing his curveball for strikes but escaped a couple of early jams, including two walks in the first inning and an unusual incident in the third inning when Zoilo Versalles appeared to have stolen second base with one out, but was ordered back to first after batter Joe Nossek was ruled out for interference. Koufax effectively gave up on his curveball and pitched the late innings almost exclusively with fastballs, still baffling the hard-hitting Twins. In the fourth inning, Dodger left fielder Lou Johnson told Koufax that he would get him the only run he would need. Johnson promptly hit a home run off the left-field foul pole to give the Dodgers a 1–0 lead. Ron Fairly followed with a double and scored on a Wes Parker single. The two runs came on three consecutive pitches.

Knowing Kaat was on short rest, manager Sam Mele pulled him quickly. Al Worthington, Johnny Klippstein, Jim Merritt, and Jim Perry combined to shut out the Dodgers for the rest of the game. The Twins threatened again in the fifth inning when they had runners on first and second with only one out. Versalles hit a hard grounder down the third base line that appeared to be going for a game-tying double. This could have ended Koufax&#x27;s day as Drysdale was warming up in the bullpen and ready to go. But third baseman Jim Gilliam (who was often replaced late in games for defensive reasons) made a diving, backhanded stop and stepped on third for a force. Koufax bore down and got the third out. He ended up tossing a three-hit shutout, striking out ten in one of the greatest Game 7 pitching performances ever.

&quot;Sweet Lou&quot; Johnson hit two home runs, including the game-winner in the clinching Game 7.

No relief pitchers were used by the winning team in any game of this series; the winning starting pitcher went the distance in all seven games. This had not happened since 1940, and has never been repeated since.

The Twins&#x27; loss in Game 7 remains the only World Series game the Twins have lost at home, having later won all their home games in 1987 and 1991. Through 2024, the Twins have never won a road World Series Game (not including when the franchise was the original Washington Senators).

The National League won its third consecutive World Series (Dodgers in 1963, St. Louis Cardinals in 1964). The Senior Circuit would not claim back-to-back titles again until 1975 and 1976, when the Cincinnati Reds won both.

Although the Dodgers had played the maximum seven games in four best-of-seven World Series when they were located in Brooklyn (in 1947, 1952, 1955, and 1956), 1965 marked the first time they had done so when located in Los Angeles. It did not happen again until 2017. The Brooklyn Dodgers had also played seven games in the 1920 World Series when it was a best-of-nine series, losing to Cleveland five games to two.

This was the third World Series involving the Dodgers where the home team won the first six games before the visiting team won the seventh. It occurred in 1955 and 1956 vs. the Yankees, with the Dodgers winning the former at Yankee Stadium and losing the latter at Ebbets Field. The pattern repeated in 1971, when the Pittsburgh Pirates prevailed over the Baltimore Orioles.

1965 World Series (4–3): Los Angeles Dodgers (N.L.) over Minnesota Twins (A.L.)

==Aftermath==
The Dodgers would return to the World Series the following year, only to be swept in four straight games by the Baltimore Orioles. The Dodgers scored twice in Game 1, but those would be only runs they would score in the &quot;entire series&quot;. Despite being at the peak of his career, Sandy Koufax retired after the series at age 30, due to chronic arthritis and bursitis in his pitching elbow.

Meanwhile, the Twins would have to wait 22 more years before returning to the World Series in 1987, where they would finally win their first championship since 1924 (known then as the Washington Senators), and their first since moving to Minnesota, by beating the St. Louis Cardinals in seven games. That series was the first series in which the home team won all games, a feat Sandy Koufax prevented in Game 7 of this series. Since the 1987 Series, that feat has been successfully accomplished twice more in 1991 (also involving the Twins, this time defeating the Atlanta Braves) and 2001 (In which the Arizona Diamondbacks defeated the New York Yankees).

This would be the final World Series where both teams&#x27; uniforms only featured numbers. All World Series since 1966 have featured at least one team with names on the uniform.

Umpire Eddie Hurley, who worked home plate in games 1 and 7, was forced to retire following the Series by American League president Joe Cronin due to having surpassed the new mandatory retirement age of 55. Hurley was the home plate umpire when St. Louis Browns owner Bill Veeck sent 3-foot-7 midget Eddie Gaedel to bat in a 1951 game vs. the Detroit Tigers.

Three umpires in this series—American League&#x27;s Red Flaherty, Bob Stewart and National League&#x27;s Tony Venzon—all worked the 1969 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, and the 1970 World Series; while the other two National League umpires Ed Sudol and Ed Vargo were both on the crew for the 1969 National League Championship Series, the 1971 World Series, the 1973 National League Championship Series, and the 1974 Major League Baseball All-Star Game.

This would also be the final World Series where Ford Frick was the commissioner of baseball.

<text>The 1938 [[World Series]] was the championship series in Major League Baseball for the 1938 season. The 35th edition of the World Series, it matched the two-time defending champion New York Yankees against the Chicago Cubs. The Yankees swept the Series in four games for their seventh championship overall and record third straight (they would win four in a row from to , and five in a row later from to ).

Dizzy Dean, who had helped carry the Cubs to the National League pennant despite a sore arm, ran out of gas in the Series as the Yanks crushed the Cubs again, as they had in . Yankee starting pitcher Red Ruffing won two games, although he allowed 17 hits in 18 innings pitched. After Game 2 of the Series, the Bronx Bombers would not return to Wrigley Field for nearly 65 years until a three-game interleague series with the Cubs beginning June 6, 2003.

This was the first World Series played at Wrigley Field following the bleacher reconstruction of 1937, which had significantly shortened the left-center field power alley.

==Summary==
==Matchups==

===Game 1===
Game 1 of the Series matched the Yankees&#x27; Red Ruffing, who had won 21 games during the season, against the Cubs&#x27; 22-game winner Bill Lee. In the top of the second inning, Lou Gehrig walked and moved to third on a single by Bill Dickey. George Selkirk then reached on an error by Cub second baseman Billy Herman scoring Gehrig, and Joe Gordon drove Dickey in with a single for a 2–0 Bomber lead.

In the bottom of the third, the Cubs cut the lead in half when Ripper Collins singled to lead off and moved to second on a groundout by Lee. Stan Hack&#x27;s single to right scored Collins, Hack taking second on the throw home. But when he attempted to score on an infield single by Herman, he was gunned down at home. The top of the sixth saw New York extend its lead to 3–1 when Tommy Henrich belted a double to right and scored on a Dickey single. The Cubs could muster nothing further off Ruffing, who scattered nine hits over the course of the game, and the Yankees held on for the win and a 1–0 lead in the Series.

===Game 2===
Game 2 pitted the Yankees&#x27; Lefty Gomez against former St. Louis Cardinals ace Dizzy Dean, who had been traded to Chicago in April and won seven of his eight regular-season wins for his new team on finesse after having lost his fastball by changing his pitching motion to avoid putting weight on the toe he had fractured during the 1937 All-Star Game (on a low line drive back to the mound by Earl Averill). Game 2 of the 1938 Series thus became known as &quot;Ol&#x27; Diz&#x27;s Last Stand&quot;.

The Cubs gave Dean a 1–0 lead in the bottom of the first inning when Hack singled, advanced to third on a single by Frank Demaree and scored on Joe Marty&#x27;s fly ball. But the Bronx Bombers took the lead in the next half-inning when a Gordon double scored both Joe DiMaggio and Gehrig. In the bottom of the third, the Cubs went back out in front by a run when Hack and Herman hit back-to-back singles, were sacrificed to third and second by Demaree, and scored on Marty&#x27;s double.

Dean pitched effectively for the next four innings, giving up only a single to Gehrig in the fourth. But in the top of the eighth, the Yankees stormed back on a two-run homer by Frankie Crosetti that scored pinch-hitter Myril Hoag for a 4–3 Bomber lead, and DiMaggio added a two-run dinger of his own in the top of the ninth that scored Henrich. Johnny Murphy, in relief of Gomez, held Chicago at bay for the final two innings for a 6–3 Yankee win as the Series moved east to New York with a 2–0 Series advantage for the Yankees.

===Game 3===
For Game 3 at Yankee Stadium, the Cubs threw Clay Bryant against the Bombers&#x27; Monte Pearson. Both pitchers matched zeroes for the first four innings. In the top of the fifth, the Cubs drew first blood when Hack doubled, moved to third on Gordon&#x27;s error on Phil Cavarretta and scored on Marty&#x27;s forceout of Cavarretta at second. In the bottom half of the inning, however, Gordon atoned for his mistake by walloping a solo home run off Bryant to tie the game. Pearson followed with a single to right, advanced to second on a Crosetti walk and scored on a Red Rolfe single to give the Yankees a 2–1 lead.

In the bottom of the sixth, New York tacked on two more runs with a two-run single by Gordon. In the top of the eighth, the Cubs cut the lead in half when Marty hit a home run to notch his fifth RBI of the Series, but Dickey answered for the Yankees with a shot of his own in the bottom half. The Bombers held on for a 5–2 win and a 3–0 Series stranglehold.

===Game 4===
Game 4 was a rematch of the Game 1 starters, Ruffing vs. Lee. Like the closely contested series opener, it stayed close until New York pulled away with four runs in the bottom of the eighth.

In the bottom of the second, the Yankees struck for three runs. Hoag reached on Hack&#x27;s throwing error from the hot corner, and advanced to third on a Gordon single. Ruffing helped his own cause by singling in Hoag, and Crosetti&#x27;s triple to left scored Gordon and Ruffing. The Cubs broke the shutout with a Billy Jurges fielder&#x27;s choice scoring Demaree, but in the sixth the Bombers got the run back with Henrich&#x27;s solo homer off veteran Cub reliever Charlie Root.

In the top of the eighth, the Cubs cut the New York lead to one with a Ken O&#x27;Dea home run scoring Cavarretta ahead of him. But in the bottom half, the Yankees broke the game open with a four-run outburst off four Cub pitchers—Vance Page, Larry French, Tex Carleton and Dean. Crosetti drove in two with a double off Dean, giving him four RBI for the game and six for the Series. As in Game 1, Ruffing went the distance, allowing two earned runs and eight hits with six strikeouts.

This was the last World Series game ever played by Yankee first baseman Lou Gehrig. He had one hit in four at-bats. Defensively he had five putouts and two assists.

<text>The 1943 [[World Series]] was the championship series in Major League Baseball for the 1943 season. The 40th edition of the World Series, it matched the defending champion St. Louis Cardinals against the New York Yankees in a rematch of the 1942 World Series. The Yankees won the series in five games for their tenth championship in 21 seasons. It was Yankees manager Joe McCarthy&#x27;s final World Series win. This series was also the first to have an accompanying World Series highlight film, which was shown to troops fighting in World War II.

This World Series was scheduled for a 3–4 format because of wartime travel restrictions. The format meant there was only one trip between ballparks, but if the series had ended in a four-game sweep, there would have been three games in one park and only one in the other.

Because of World War II, both teams&#x27; rosters were depleted. Johnny Beazley, Jimmy Brown, Creepy Crespi, Terry Moore and Enos Slaughter were no longer on the Cardinals&#x27; roster. Joe DiMaggio, Phil Rizzuto, Red Ruffing and Buddy Hassett were missing from the Yankees, and Red Rolfe had retired to coach at Dartmouth College.

Cardinals pitchers Howie Pollet, Max Lanier and Mort Cooper ranked 1–2–3 in the National League in ERA in 1943 at 1.75, 1.90 and 2.30, respectively.

==Summary==
==Matchups==

===Game 1===

In Game 1, the Cardinals took a 1–0 lead in the second inning against Spud Chandler on Marty Marion&#x27;s RBI double with two on. In the fourth inning, with runners on first and third and no outs off Max Lanier, Charlie Keller&#x27;s double play tied the game, and then Joe Gordon&#x27;s home run gave the Yankees a 2–1 lead. The Cardinals tied the game in the fifth inning when Ray Sanders hit a leadoff single, moved to second on an error and scored on Lanier&#x27;s single. In the sixth inning after two leadoff singles, a one-out wild pitch by Lanier put the Yankees up 3–2, and Bill Dickey added an insurance run with an RBI single. Chandler pitched a complete game to give the Yankees a 1–0 series lead.

===Game 2===

The Cardinals&#x27; only victory came on the same day as the death of Mort and Walker Cooper&#x27;s father. Marty Marion&#x27;s leadoff home run in the third off Tiny Bonham gave the Cardinals a 1–0 lead. In the fourth, Stan Musial hit a leadoff single, moved to second on a groundout and scored on Whitey Kurowski&#x27;s RBI single. Ray Sanders&#x27;s two-run home run increased the lead to 4–0. In the bottom of the inning, Charlie Keller&#x27;s sacrifice fly with two on off Mort Cooper put the Yankees on the board. In the ninth, Billy Johnson hit a leadoff double and then scored on Cooper&#x27;s triple. After a lineout, Nick Etten&#x27;s RBI groundout cut the Cardinals&#x27; lead to one, but Cooper coaxed Joe Gordon to pop out in foul territory to end the game and tie the series 1–1.

===Game 3===

The Cardinals loaded the bases in the fourth on a single, double and intentional walk off Hank Borowy before Danny Litwhiler drove in two with a single to left, but Borowy allowed no other runs in eight innings. In the sixth, Borowy hit a leadoff double off Al Brazle, moved to third on a sacrifice fly and scored on an error on Billy Johnson&#x27;s ground ball. In the eighth, the Yankees loaded the bases on a single, fielder&#x27;s choice and intentional walk before Johnson cleared them with a triple, putting the Yankees ahead 4–2. They added to their lead on RBI singles by Joe Gordon off Howie Krist and Nick Etten off Harry Brecheen. Johnny Murphy pitched a perfect ninth as the Yankees took a 2–1 series lead.

===Game 4===
The Yankees struck first when Joe Gordon doubled with two outs in the fourth off Max Lanier and scored on Bill Dickey&#x27;s single. In the seventh, Marius Russo recorded two outs but then allowed the Cardinals to load the bases on an error, double and intentional walk before another error on Frank Demaree&#x27;s ground ball tied the game. In the eighth, Russo hit a leadoff double off Harry Brecheen, moved to third on a sacrifice bunt and scored on Frankie Crosetti&#x27;s sacrifice fly. Russo pitched a complete game to leave the Yankees one win away from the championship.

===Game 5===

Murry Dickson, who helped close the door for the Cardinals by allowing no hits while on the mound, was on a ten-day pass from the United States Army. Spud Chandler won his second complete game of the series, shutting out the Cardinals despite allowing 10 hits and two walks. Bill Dickey provided the game&#x27;s only runs on a home run in the sixth after a two-out walk by Mort Cooper.

<text>The 1942 World Series featured the defending champion New York Yankees against the St. Louis Cardinals, with the Cardinals winning in five games for their first championship since and their fourth overall.

The 1942 Cardinals set a franchise record for victories with 106. Every Cardinals player, except for Harry Gumbert, was a product of the team&#x27;s farm system, which had been created by Branch Rickey.

The Yankees won Game 1 despite a Cardinals rally, but the Cardinals swept the rest of the games. The loss was the Yankees&#x27; first since the 1926 World Series, also at the hands of the Cardinals. The Yankees had won eight World Series in the interim (a record for most consecutive series won between losses) and had won 32 out of 36 World Series games in that period, including five sweeps (1927 vs. the Pirates, 1928 vs. the Cardinals, 1932 and 1938 vs. the Cubs and 1939 vs. the Reds).

==Summary==
==Matchups==

===Game 1===

In Game 1, Red Ruffing had a no-hitter until Terry Moore singled for St. Louis with two out in the eighth inning. The Yankees scored the game&#x27;s first run in the fourth on Buddy Hassett&#x27;s two-out double with two on off of Mort Cooper. Next inning with runners on second and third, Joe DiMaggio&#x27;s fielder&#x27;s choice made it 2–0 Yankees. In the eighth with two on, Hassett&#x27;s single scored a run, then an error on Red Ruffing&#x27;s fly ball scored two more. Red Rolfe singled to lead off the ninth off of Max Lanier and scored on an error on Roy Cullenbine&#x27;s bunt attempt. Charlie Keller walked and an error on a pickoff attempt allowed Cullenbine to score. In the bottom of the ninth, with two on and two outs, Marty Marion put the Cardinals on the board with a two-run triple, then scored on Ken O&#x27;Dea&#x27;s single. After Jimmy Brown walked, Spud Chandler relieved Ruffing and allowed an RBI single to Terry Moore. Another single loaded the bases, bringing Stan Musial to the plate as the potential winning run, only to have Musial ground out to end the game as the Yankees took a 1–0 series lead with a 7–4 win.

===Game 2===

In Game 2, Walker Cooper&#x27;s two-run double in the first, the Cardinals&#x27; first hit of the game, put them up 2–0 off of Tiny Bonham. In the seventh, innings Johnny Hopp singled and scored on Whitey Kurowski&#x27;s triple to make it 3–0 Cardinals. Johnny Beazley pitched seven shutout innings, but in the eighth allowed a two-out single to Roy Cullenbine, who stole second and scored on Joe DiMaggio&#x27;s single. A two-run home run by Charlie Keller then tied the score, but the Cardinals regained the lead in the bottom half when Enos Slaughter doubled with two outs and scored on Stan Musial&#x27;s single. Slaughter threw out Tuck Stainback going from first to third on a single with no outs in the ninth. Beazley then retired the next two hitters to end the game as the Cardinals tied the series with a 4–3 win heading to New York.

===Game 3===

Ernie White pitched a six-hit shutout against New York, walking none. The last time the Yankees were shutout in a World Series game was by Jesse Haines in 1926. The Cardinals scored the game&#x27;s first run in the third off of Spud Chandler on Jimmy Brown&#x27;s groundout with runners on second and third, then added an insurance run in the ninth off of Marv Breuer on Enos Slaughter&#x27;s RBI single with two on, the run unearned due to catcher Bill Dickey&#x27;s error on Terry Moore&#x27;s bunt attempt, to take a 2–1 series lead.

===Game 4===

In Game 4, the Yankees struck first in the bottom of the first when Red Rolfe doubled off of Mort Cooper and scored on Roy Cullenbine&#x27;s single. In the top of the fourth, the Cardinals loaded the bases with no outs on two singles and walk before Whitey Kurowski&#x27;s two-run single put them up 2–1. A walk loaded the bases before Cooper&#x27;s two-run single made it 4–1 Cardinals. Atley Donald relieved starter Hank Borowy and allowed a one-out RBI single to Terry Moore and two-out RBI double to Stan Musial. In the bottom of the sixth, after a leadoff single and walk, Cullunbine&#x27;s RBI single made it 6–2 Cardinals and one out later, Charlie Keller&#x27;s three-run home run cut their lead to one. Harry Gumbert relieved Cooper and Joe Gordon reached first third baseman Kurowski&#x27;s throwing error, then scored on Jerry Priddy&#x27;s double to tie the game, but the Cardinals took the lead for good in the seventh. After two leadoff walks, an RBI single by Walker Cooper put them up 7–6, and Marty Marion hit a sacrifice fly off of Tiny Bonham later that inning. The Cardinals added another run in the ninth Johnny Hopp hit a leadoff single, moved to third on two groundouts and scored on a single by Max Lanier, who pitched three shutout innings to close the game and earn the win, leaving the Cardinals one win away from the championship.

===Game 5===

In Game 5, Phil Rizzuto&#x27;s leadoff home run in the bottom of the first off of Johnny Beazley put the Yankees up 1–0, but the Cardinals tied the score in the fourth on Enos Slaughter&#x27;s leadoff home run off of Red Ruffing. The Yankees retook the lead in the bottom half when Red Rolfe hit a leadoff single, moved to third on an error and groundout and scored on Joe DiMaggio&#x27;s single, but the Cardinals again tied the game in the sixth on two leadoff singles and a sacrifice fly by Walker Cooper. In the top of the ninth, Whitey Kurowski&#x27;s two-run home run put the Cardinals up 4–2. Though the Yankees put two on in the bottom of the ninth on a single and error with no outs, Beazley picked off Joe Gordon at second and retired the next two batters to end the game and give the Cardinals the championship.

<text>H. G. Wells is a lunar impact crater that is located on the far side of the Moon, behind the northeastern limb. It lies to the south of the crater Millikan, and to the northeast of Cantor. Just to the southeast is the smaller Tesla. 

This large formation is most notable for the extremely battered state of its outer rim. Little or nothing remains of the original rim, so completely has it been eroded and incised by smaller craters. As a result, the crater floor is now surrounded by a ring of irregular peaks and worn crater valleys. This rugged surroundings intrudes only part way into the interior, while the remaining floor is relatively level and in some places gently rolling. The interior is marked only by a multitude of tiny craters.

The crater is named after the author H. G. Wells whose works include the 1901 novel &quot;The First Men in the Moon&quot;. Prior to formal naming by the IAU in 1970, H. G. Wells was called &quot;Crater 48&quot;.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to H. G. Wells.

<text>The 1963 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball&#x27;s (MLB) 1963 season. The 60th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff that matched the American League (AL) champion and two-time defending World Series champion New York Yankees against the National League (NL) champion Los Angeles Dodgers; the Dodgers swept the Series in four games to secure their second championship title in five years, and their third in franchise history. Dodgers starting pitchers Sandy Koufax, Don Drysdale, and Johnny Podres, and ace reliever Ron Perranoski combined to give up only four runs in four games. The dominance of the Dodgers pitchers was so complete that at no point in any of the four games did the Yankees have the lead. New York was held to a .171 team batting average, the lowest ever for the Yankees in the postseason. Koufax was named the World Series Most Valuable Player.

This was the first time in their history that the Yankees were swept in a World Series in four straight games (the 1922 World Series had one tie).

Of the Dodgers&#x27; eight World Series championships to date, this remains the only one clinched in their home ballpark (although their 2020 title was won as the designated &quot;home team&quot; as part of that year&#x27;s neutral-site World Series in Arlington, Texas).

This series was also the first meeting between teams from New York City and Los Angeles for a major professional sports championship. Eight more such meetings have followed with four more times each in the World Series, three in the NBA Finals, and the 2014 Stanley Cup Finals.

==Background==

===Yankees===
Despite injuries that limited Mickey Mantle to just 65 games, the Yankees went 104–57 to win their fourth straight American League pennant—this one by games. Catcher Elston Howard (.287 BA, 28 HRs, 85 RBI) won the MVP Award, while Joe Pepitone, Roger Maris, and Tom Tresh also topped the 20 home run mark. Their pitching was anchored by Whitey Ford (24 wins, 2.74 ERA) and Jim Bouton (21 wins, 2.53 ERA).

===Dodgers===
The Dodgers&#x27; road to the World Series was much more challenging. After blowing a four-game lead with seven to play in 1962, the Dodgers again built a lead in 1963. On August 21, the Dodgers beat the Cardinals 2–1 in 16 innings to take a game lead. When they went to St. Louis for a three-game series on September 16, their lead was one game over the Cardinals, who had won 19 of 20 games. Sports fans around the country were saying how the Dodgers were going to blow it again. But the Dodgers swept the three games from the Cardinals to move four games ahead with nine to play; a 4–1 win over the Mets clinched the pennant in the season&#x27;s 158th game.

==Summary==
==Matchups==

===Game 1===


Sandy Koufax started it off with a record 15-strikeout performance in Game 1 to outduel the Yankees&#x27; ace left-hander Whitey Ford. The 15 strikeouts bested fellow Dodgers pitcher Carl Erskine&#x27;s mark in 1953 by one, and would be surpassed by Bob Gibson in 1968 with 17. Koufax also tied a World Series record when he fanned the first five Yankees he faced.

Clete Boyer was the only Yankees regular not to strike out. Mickey Mantle, Tom Tresh and Tony Kubek each struck out twice, and Bobby Richardson struck out three times—his only three-strikeout game in 1448 regular season or World Series games. Koufax also struck out three pinch-hitters, including Harry Bright to end the game.

Ford set the Dodgers down in order in the first inning, but got into trouble in the second inning. With one out, right fielder Frank Howard doubled into left center field. A single by first baseman Bill Skowron plated Howard to give the Dodgers a 1–0 lead. Second baseman Dick Tracewski&#x27;s single preceded a three-run home run by catcher John Roseboro to give the Dodgers a 4–0 lead.

The Dodgers upped the lead to 5-0 when Skowron singled home Willie Davis with two outs in the third inning against Ford, who went just five innings.

The Yankees scored twice in the eighth inning when Tony Kubek singled with one out and Tom Tresh homered with two outs to cut the lead to 5–2.
===Game 2===

Willie Davis doubled in two runs in the first inning (after Maury Wills and Jim Gilliam singled), former Yankee Bill Skowron homered in the fourth, and Tommy Davis had two triples, including an RBI triple in the eighth after a second Davis double, to lead the Dodger offense. Yankee starter Al Downing, who would take the loss, went only five innings and charged with three runs. Ralph Terry, in relief, allowed Davis&#x27;s RBI triple. Dodger manager Walt Alston went with #3 starter Johnny Podres over #2 starter Don Drysdale because he was left-handed and Yankee Stadium was favorable to left-handed pitchers. Podres delivered a six-hitter through innings; ace reliever Ron Perranoski, also a left-hander, got the last two outs and the save when Podres ran into trouble and allowed a run, and the Dodgers headed home with 2–0 Series lead. Yankees right fielder Roger Maris left the game in the third after hurting his left arm running into the right field foul wall while chasing down Tommy Davis&#x27;s first triple and would miss the final two games of the series.

===Game 3===


Don Drysdale pitched a masterful three-hitter at Dodger Stadium in his complete-game win. Manager Walter Alston called Drysdale&#x27;s performance &quot;one of the greatest pitched games I ever saw.&quot; Jim Bouton, making his first World Series start, dueled Drysdale throughout, permitting only four hits in seven innings for a losing cause. The lone run of the game came in the bottom of the first on a Jim Gilliam walk, a wild pitch and a two-out single by Tommy Davis. Gilliam almost scored again in the eighth off Hal Reniff, but was caught in an attempt to steal third. The final out came on Joe Pepitone&#x27;s drive that backed Dodger right fielder Ron Fairly up against the bullpen gate to make the catch of a ball that would have been a home run in Yankee Stadium. Tony Kubek had two of the Yankees&#x27; three hits, but none of the hits were extra-base hits.

===Game 4===


Aces were on the mound again in a game 1 rematch between Whitey Ford and Sandy Koufax. This time, it was a pitcher&#x27;s duel. The Dodgers scored first in the bottom of the fifth on a monumental Frank Howard home run into the second (Loge) level at Dodger Stadium. The Yankees tied it on a Mickey Mantle home run in the top of the seventh. But in the bottom of the inning, Gilliam hit a high hopper to Yankee third baseman Clete Boyer; Boyer leaped to make the grab, and fired an accurate throw to first base. But first baseman Joe Pepitone lost Boyer&#x27;s peg in the white-shirted crowd background; the ball struck Pepitone in the arm and rolled down the right field line, allowing Gilliam to scamper all the way to third base. He then scored a moment later on Willie Davis&#x27; sacrifice fly. Sandy Koufax went on to hold the Yankees for the final two innings for a 2–1 victory and the Dodgers&#x27; third world championship. To date, this is the only time the Dodgers have won the deciding game of a World Series at home. (The Dodgers won the 2020 World Series in Game 6 while they were designated as the home team, but the game was played at a neutral site, Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas, as a result of the COVID-19 global pandemic.)

The World Series Most Valuable Player Award went to Sandy Koufax, who started two of the four games and had two complete game victories. He struck out 23 batters and only surrendered three earned runs, recording an ERA of 1.50. When the award was given to Koufax at a luncheon in New York City, he was presented with a new car—while the luncheon was taking place, a New York City police officer put a parking violation ticket on the car&#x27;s windshield.

==Composite line score==
1963 World Series (4–0): Los Angeles Dodgers (N.L.) over New York Yankees (A.L.)
The Yankees&#x27; four runs in the series was, at the time, the second-lowest total in a World Series, as the Philadelphia Athletics had scored only three runs in . The Los Angeles Dodgers would set a new low in , two runs.

==In popular culture==
* In the 1986 novel &quot;Replay&quot; by Ken Grimwood, the protagonist bets his life savings on a Dodgers sweep, knowing they will win. His winnings total more than $12 million, at the apparent odds of 100–1, with Grimwood referring to it as &quot;one of the great upsets in baseball history&quot;.
* This is the World Series that Jack Nicholson&#x27;s character R.P. McMurphy lobbies unsuccessfully to watch on television (and subsequently &quot;announces&quot; by imagining the action) in Miloš Forman&#x27;s 1975 film &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot;. He imagines quite a different scene than what occurred, however, as he describes Richardson, Tresh, and Mantle knocking Koufax out of the box. In reality, the Yankees never led at any time in the Series, and only once in the entire Series (and that only for a half-inning) were the Yankees and Dodgers tied at a score other than 0–0. A brief clip of Ernie Harwell&#x27;s NBC Radio broadcast of Game 2 can be heard in the film.
* On March 21, 1964, &quot;The Joey Bishop Show&quot; had lead character Joey Barnes host members of the 1963 Los Angeles Dodgers on his variety show. Don Drysdale sang &quot;I Left My Heart in San Francisco,&quot; Joey had fun with 6&#x27;7&quot; Frank Howard, and all the Dodgers sang a parody of &quot;High Hopes&quot; in which they celebrated their victory over the Yankees. The lyrics to this parody were written by Sammy Cahn, who also wrote the original lyrics.

==Broadcasting==
* This was longtime Yankees announcer Mel Allen&#x27;s 22nd and final World Series broadcast. Allen was suffering from an attack of severe laryngitis at the time of the Series, and while doing play-by-play for NBC television during Game 4 his voice gave out completely in the bottom of the eighth inning, requiring Vin Scully to take over for the remainder of the game. (The following year—Allen&#x27;s last with the Yankees—he would be passed over for the Series assignment in favor of boothmate Phil Rizzuto.)
* Game 4 was the highest-rated sports broadcast of 1963, per Nielsen ratings. Of all televised World Series games, its 39.5 rating (percentage of all U.S. television-equipped households that watched the game) has only been surpassed by Game 7 in (39.6) and Game 6 in (40.0).

<text>The 1952 World Series featured the 3-time defending champions New York Yankees beating the Brooklyn Dodgers in seven games. The Yankees won their 4th consecutive title, tying the mark they set in 1936–1939 under manager Joe McCarthy, and Casey Stengel became the second manager in Major League history with 4 consecutive World Series championships. This was the Yankees&#x27; 15th World Series championship win, and the 3rd time they defeated the Dodgers in 6 years.

In Game 7, the Yankees&#x27; second baseman Billy Martin made a great catch, preserving the Yankees&#x27; two-run lead. Also, the home run hit by Mickey Mantle during the 8th inning of Game 6 was significant because it was the first of his record 18 career World Series home runs.

==Summary==
==Matchups==

In 1952 the Dodgers, led by manager Chuck Dressen, paced the NL in runs scored (775), home runs (153) and stolen bases (90). Duke Snider, Jackie Robinson and George Shuba batted over .300, while Roy Campanella (97) and Gil Hodges (102) paced the team in RBIs. The Dodgers had no dominant pitchers with Carl Erskine (206) the lone pitcher with over 200 innings and rookie Joe Black leading the team with 15 wins. Manager Dressen used 14 starting pitchers on the year, but as a unit, the pitchers combined to finish second in the NL in team ERA. Defensively, the Dodgers led the NL with a .982 fielding percentage, and Campanella gunned down 29 of 52 (56%) would-be base stealers.

The Yankees, led by the effusive Casey Stengel, recovered from the retirement of Joe DiMaggio, and the loss of Bobby Brown, Jerry Coleman and Tom Morgan to the service. The Yankees matched the Dodgers in hitting as they finished first or second in the AL in runs scored, home runs, batting average, and slugging percentage. Mickey Mantle had a breakout season leading the Yankees in batting (.311), and slugging (.530). Yogi Berra led the Yanks in runs (97), HRs (30) and RBIs (98). The Yankees had a pitching staff that led the AL in ERA (3.14). Allie Reynolds led the team with 20 wins and led the league with 2.08 ERA. Casey Stengel rotated his pitchers all year with seven having at least 12 starts, but none working more than 35 games. Defensive standout Phil Rizzuto led AL shortstops with 458 assists and made only 19 errors.

===Game 1===


Joe Black pitched a complete game and became the first African-American pitcher to win a World Series game. Jackie Robinson&#x27;s lead off home run in the second off of Allie Reynolds put the Dodgers up 1–0, but Gil McDougald tied the game with a lead off home run of his own in the third. Duke Snider&#x27;s two-run home run in the sixth put the Dodgers back in front 3–1. The Yankees cut the lead to 3–2 on a Gene Woodling triple and Hank Bauer sacrifice fly in the top of the eighth, but Pee Wee Reese gave the Dodgers that run back with a two-out home run in the eighth off Ray Scarborough as Brooklyn won 4–2 to take a 1–0 series lead.

===Game 2===


Vic Raschi&#x27;s complete-game three-hitter and nine strikeouts dominated this game. He was behind 1–0 after a Roy Campanella RBI single in the third, then in the fourth, the Yankees tied it when Mickey Mantle doubled, took third on a groundout and scored on a Yogi Berra sacrifice fly off Carl Erskine. Next inning, Gil McDougald drew a leadoff walk, stole second and scored on Billy Martin&#x27;s single to put the Yankees up 2–1. A five-run Yankee sixth broke it open. Two singles and a walk loaded the bases before Billy Loes relieved Erskine and allowed an RBI groundout to Joe Collins, RBI single to McDougald, and three-run home run to Martin to put the Yankees up 7–1. The series was tied 1–1 shifting to the Bronx.

===Game 3===


In Game 3, the Yankees struck first in the second on Eddie Lopat&#x27;s RBI single with two on off Preacher Roe, but the Dodgers tied the game off Lopat in the third on Jackie Robinson&#x27;s sacrifice fly with two on. In the fifth, Billy Cox singled, moved to second on a sacrifice bunt and scored on Pee Wee Reese&#x27;s RBI single. In the eighth, after two leadoff singles, Andy Pafko&#x27;s sacrifice fly made it 3–1 Dodgers. Yogi Berra&#x27;s home run in the bottom of the inning cut the lead to 3–2, but in the ninth, Reese and Robinson singled, then (after Lopat was relieved by Tom Gorman) did a double steal. A passed ball allowed both to score to make it 5–2 Dodgers. Johnny Mize&#x27;s home run in the bottom of the inning made it 5–3 Dodgers, but Roe retired the next two men to end the game and give the Dodgers a 2–1 series lead.

===Game 4===


In Game 4, the score was 1–0 in the eighth, a Johnny Mize home run in the fourth off Joe Black being the difference, when Dodgers reliever Johnny Rutherford came into the game. The first batter he faced was Mickey Mantle, who tripled to deep left-center, then kept coming home when the throw to third got away, scoring a key insurance run for the Yankees. Both sides got just four hits in the contest. Allie Reynolds pitched a complete-game shutout as the Yankees&#x27; 2–0 win tied the series at two games apiece.

===Game 5===


The Dodgers struck first in the second off Ewell Blackwell on Andy Pafko&#x27;s RBI single with two on. In the fourth, with runners on second and third, Pee Wee Reese&#x27;s sacrifice fly made it 2–0 Dodgers, then Duke Snider&#x27;s two-run home run extended their lead to 4–0. Carl Erskine pitched four shutout innings before the Yankees torched him in the fifth. After a walk and single, Irv Noren&#x27;s RBI single and Gil McDougald&#x27;s forceout scored a run each. After a single and pop out, Johnny Mize&#x27;s three-run home run put the Yankees ahead 5–4. In the seventh, Billy Cox singled, moved to second on a sacrifice bunt, and scored on Snider&#x27;s RBI single, tying the game off Johnny Sain. The game went into extra innings and in the top of the 11th, Billy Cox got his third hit of the game, moved up on a Pee Wee Reese hit and scored on Duke Snider&#x27;s double off reliever Johnny Sain for what turned out to be the winning run. Erskine pitched all 11 innings for Brooklyn, retiring the last 19 batters he faced, closing it out by retiring future Hall of Famers Mickey Mantle, Johnny Mize and Yogi Berra 1-2-3. The Dodgers were one win away from a championship as the series returned to Brooklyn.

===Game 6===


In Game 6, with a 3–2 Series lead and the final two at Ebbets Field, the Dodgers looked to chase away the demons of 1951. Billy Loes (13–8) faced Vic Raschi (16–6). Dodgers Manager Chuck Dressen made a curious lineup change with George Shuba batting fifth, replacing Andy Pafko. Dressen placed Roy Campanella in the sixth spot and left Gil Hodges to bat seventh.

In the Dodgers half of the first inning, with Duke Snider on second and Jackie Robinson on first, Shuba grounded out to Billy Martin to end the inning. In the Yankees fourth, Yogi Berra reached second base when Pee Wee Reese uncorked a wild throw on a double-play attempt, but the Yankees could not capitalize. In the fifth inning, the Dodgers turned a remarkable double play. Yankee Irv Noren led off with a single, followed by a Vic Raschi bunt. Gil Hodges picked up the bunt, turned and fired to Reese at second, who in lightning succession fired to Robinson covering first just in time to retire Raschi. In the Dodgers sixth, Snider sent Raschi&#x27;s first pitch over the of screen in back of right field and onto Bedford Avenue for 1–0 lead. In the top of the seventh, Yogi Berra matched Snider&#x27;s home run with one of his own, again onto Bedford Avenue. Gene Woodling followed with a single and Dodgers pitcher Billy Loes balked him to second. Raschi then made up for his bunt-turned-double-play by getting a hit, literally off Loes. The ball ricocheted off Loes and into right field bringing Woodling home for a 2–1 lead. In another curious move Dressen allowed pitcher Billy Loes to hit for himself in the seventh. Loes singled and promptly stole second. But Raschi struck out Billy Cox to end the inning. Mantle led off the Yankees eighth inning with the first of his 18 World Series home runs. Mantle&#x27;s shot set a record for home runs by one team and for both teams in a single Series at 13. Snider continued the home run fest by launching another one in the bottom of the eighth. Jackie Robinson then sent left fielder Gene Woodling to the wall for an out and Shuba doubled to send Raschi to the showers. Allie Reynolds relieved and quickly ended the Dodgers eighth. Reynolds, known as &quot;The Chief&quot;, again made quick work of the Dodgers in the ninth including striking out Rocky Nelson, who had pinch-hit for Hodges, preserving the 3–2 win.

===Game 7===


Game 7 pitted Joe Black (15–4) vs Eddie Lopat (10–5). Black, who came out of the Negro leagues and was not even on the Dodgers spring training roster, had already pitched a complete game win in Game 1 of the Series, pitched seven innings in a 2–0 loss in Game 4 and would be starting his third game in seven days. At that time there were no days off between games as both teams played in New York. For the Yankees, Billy Martin continued his solid play. Martin sat on the bench for most of the season&#x27;s first two months and took over second base duties when Casey Stengel moved Gil McDougald from second to third base to replace military-bound Bobby Brown.

Phil Rizzuto led off the Yankees fourth with a double and Johnny Mize singled him home for a 1–0 lead. In the Dodgers fourth, a single by Duke Snider followed by two consecutive sacrifice attempts by Jackie Robinson and Roy Campanella, intended to move runners over, loaded the bases instead. Allie Reynolds replaced Lopat and retired Gil Hodges with a fly to left scoring Snider. Reynolds struck out George Shuba, then induced Carl Furillo to ground out, leaving Robinson at third and the game tied 1–1. In the fifth inning, Gene Woodling homered for the Yankees, and the Dodgers&#x27; Billy Cox doubled followed by a Pee Wee Reese single which tied the game at 2–2. Mickey Mantle demonstrated his penchant for coming up big in World Series play with a home run in the sixth inning and RBI single in the seventh (off Preacher Roe) to give the Bronx Bombers a 4–2 lead. The Brooklyn boys loaded the bases again in the seventh, when Vic Raschi walked Furillo, Cox singled and Reese walked. Stengel called on Bob Kuzava, who retired Snider, setting the stage for Billy Martin. With two out and the runners moving, Jackie Robinson popped-up to the right of the mound. Kuzava hesitated, looking to his fielders. Martin charged hard from his position deep at second and caught the ball off his shoetops, to end the inning and save as many as 3 runs. Kuzava then quickly put the Dodgers down in the eighth and ninth to give the Yankees their fourth consecutive World Championship.

The Yankees batted .216 and the Dodgers only .215 in this tightly contested series.

<text>The 1951 World Series matched the two-time defending champion New York Yankees against the New York Giants, who had won the National League pennant in a thrilling three-game playoff with the Brooklyn Dodgers on the legendary home run by Bobby Thomson (the Shot Heard &#x27;Round the World).

In the Series, the Yankees showed some power of their own, including Gil McDougald&#x27;s grand slam home run in Game 5, at the Polo Grounds. The Yankees won the Series in six games, for their third straight title and 14th overall. This would be the last World Series for Joe DiMaggio, who retired afterward, and the first for rookies Willie Mays and Mickey Mantle.

This was the last Subway Series the Giants played in. Both teams would meet again eleven years later after the Giants relocated to San Francisco. They have not played a World Series against each other since. This was the first World Series announced by Bob Sheppard, who was in his first year as Yankee Stadium&#x27;s public address announcer. It was also the first World Series to be televised exclusively by one network (NBC) as well as the first to be televised nationwide, as coaxial cable had recently linked both coasts.

==Background==
This World Series also matched up two of baseball&#x27;s most colorful managers, Casey Stengel of the Yankees and Leo Durocher of the Giants.

This was the 13th appearance by the Giants in Series play, their ninth loss, and their first appearance since the 1937 World Series.

&quot;The Commerce Comet arrives on the final voyage of the Yankee Clipper.&quot; (On the Yankees&#x27; side, the 1951 World Series was the first for Mickey Mantle and the final for Joe DiMaggio.)

Mantle&#x27;s bad luck with injuries in the Major Leagues began here. In the fifth inning of Game 2 at Yankee Stadium, Mays flied to deep right center. DiMaggio and Mantle converged on the ball, DiMaggio called Mantle off, and Mantle stutter-stepped, catching a cleat in a drain cover, and fell to the ground in a heap with a wrenched knee as DiMaggio made the catch. Mantle was done for this Series, but would come back to play many more.

New York City became the first city to host an NBA Finals and a World Series in the same calendar year.

==Summary==
==Matchups==
===Game 1===


Monte Irvin&#x27;s daring baserunning got the Giants off to a fast start in this New York – New York series. He singled in the first inning, sped to third on Whitey Lockman&#x27;s RBI single, then stole home off Yankee starter Allie Reynolds. The Yankees cut the Giants&#x27; lead to 2–1 in the second when Gil McDougald doubled with one out off Dave Koslo and scored on Jerry Coleman&#x27;s single. The scored remained that way until the sixth when Alvin Dark&#x27;s three-run home run gave the Giants a commanding 5–1 lead. Koslo pitched a complete game to give the Giants a 1–0 series lead.

===Game 2===


The first three batters Larry Jansen faced were Mickey Mantle, Phil Rizzuto and Gil McDougald, all of whom singled for a quick 1-0 Yankee lead. It could have been worse, but the next batter Joe DiMaggio bounced into a 6-4-3 double play and Yogi Berra struck out. The next inning, Joe Collins&#x27;s home run extended the Yankees&#x27; lead to 2–0. In the fifth Willie Mays flied out to Joe DiMaggio, who waved off right fielder Mantle, who got his spikes caught in an exposed drain and injured his knee and had to leave the game. This injury would stick with him for the rest of his career. Monte Irvin scored in the seventh, tagging and coming home on pinch-hitter Bill Rigney&#x27;s bases-loaded sacrifice fly, as the Giants got within 2–1. But winning pitcher Eddie Lopat, who pitched a complete game, helped himself to an insurance run with an RBI single in the eighth after Bobby Brown hit a leadoff single and moved to second on a groundout off George Spencer. The Yankees&#x27; 3–1 win tied the series shifting to the Polo Grounds.

===Game 3===


The Giants struck first in Game 3 when Bobby Thomson hit a leadoff double and scored on Willie Mays&#x27; single in the second, then a five-run fifth inning was the undoing of Yankee starter Vic Raschi. Eddie Stanky walked with one out, moved to third on an error, and scored on Al Dark&#x27;s single. After a Hank Thompson single, another error on Monte Irvin&#x27;s fielder&#x27;s choice allowed another run to score and put two on, then a Whitey Lockman three-run home run gave Giants starter Jim Hearn a comfortable 6–0 lead. The Yankees scored a run in the eighth on a bases-loaded walk to Joe Collins, then in the ninth on Gene Woodling&#x27;s home run off Sheldon Jones, who retired the next two batters to end the game and give the Giants a 2–1 series lead.

===Game 4===


In the rain-delayed Game 4, the Giants again scored first when Al Dark doubled with one out in the opening inning off Allie Reynolds and scored on Monte Irvin&#x27;s single, but the Yankees tied the game in the second on Joe Collins&#x27;s RBI single with two on off Sal Maglie. After a single and walk, Reynolds&#x27;s RBI single in the fourth put the Yankees up 2–1. Joe DiMaggio&#x27;s first home run of the Series following a Yogi Berra single in the fifth extended their lead to 4–1. In the seventh, reliever Sheldon Jones allowed a single and walk, then an error on a pickoff attempt allowed one run to score before Gil McDougald&#x27;s RBI single made it 6–1 Yankees. Reynolds allowed a one-out RBI single to Bobby Thomson in the ninth before getting Willie Mays to hit into the game-ending double play as the Yankees tied the series with a 6–2 win.

===Game 5===


For the third game in a row, the Giants scored first when Al Dark singled with one out in the first and scored on Monte Irvin&#x27;s single aided by left fielder Gene Woodling&#x27;s error, but starter Eddie Lopat kept them scoreless for the rest of Game 5 while the Yankees hammered Larry Jansen, Monty Kennedy and George Spencer. After two one-out walks in the third, Joe DiMaggio&#x27;s RBI single tied the game, then after an intentional walk loaded the bases, Gil McDougald&#x27;s grand slam off Jansen put the Yankees up 5–1. Next inning, Phil Rizzuto&#x27;s home run off Kennedy after a walk extended their lead to 7–1. In the sixth, Rizzuto singled off Spencer before Yogi Berra&#x27;s single and Johnny Mize&#x27;s double scored a run each, making it 9–1 Yankees. In the seventh, a bases-loaded walk to Rizzuto forced in a run, then Al Corwin threw a wild pitch that let another run score before DiMaggio&#x27;s two-run double capped the game&#x27;s scoring at 13–1 Yankees, who were a win away from the World Series championship as the series returned to Yankee Stadium.

===Game 6===


The Yankees struck first in Game 6 on Gil McDougald&#x27;s bases-loaded sacrifice fly in the first off Dave Koslo. The Giants tied the game in the fifth off Vic Raschi when Willie Mays hit a leadoff single, moved two bases on a wild pitch and sacrifice fly, and scored on Eddie Stanky&#x27;s sacrifice fly. Playing right field in place of Mickey Mantle, Hank Bauer benefited from a tricky Yankee Stadium wind—as well as the umpire&#x27;s generous call of a ball on Dave Koslo&#x27;s two-strike pitch—to belt a bases-loaded triple in the sixth inning that would be the difference. Bauer also ensured that the lead held up. Trailing 4–1 in the ninth, the Giants loaded the bases with no outs on three singles off Johnny Sain. Enter reliever Bob Kuzava, acquired in June from the Washington Senators. After two sacrifice flies and the score now 4–3, pinch hitter Sal Yvars hit a sinking liner to right. The stadium crowd gasped as Bauer momentarily lost the ball in the crowd&#x27;s white shirts and the shadows. But he located it again and charged forward. Bauer, who played in nine World Series and always came through when it mattered most, slid on his knees to catch the ball inches off the ground to end the game and the 1951 World Series. Game 6 was the last baseball game ever played by Joe DiMaggio.

<doc id="1332291" wikidata="Q1307995" url="?curid=1332291" title="Family Day">
<text>Family Day is a public holiday in the countries of Angola, Israel, Namibia, South Africa, Uruguay, Vanuatu, and Vietnam; in the Canadian provinces of Alberta, British Columbia, New Brunswick, Ontario, and Saskatchewan; in the American states of Arizona and Nevada; and as the second day of Songkran in Thailand. It was formerly observed in the Australian Capital Territory from 2007 to 2017.

== Australia ==

=== Australian Capital Territory ===
&quot;Family and community day&quot; was celebrated on the first Tuesday of November from 2007 to 2009, coinciding with the Melbourne Cup. This public holiday was declared in 2007. Andrew Barr, then ACT Minister for Industrial Relations, stated the purpose of the new public holiday was:

&quot;...to enable workers to take a break from their hectic work and to spend some quality time with their family and friends. ... Australians do work the longest hours of any country in the western world. We do deserve a break.&quot;

In the years 2010–2016, the date was moved to the first Monday of the September/October school holidays. Where the first Monday of the school holidays falls on the ACT Labour Day public holiday (first Monday in October), the holiday is moved to the second Monday of the ACT school holidays.

From 2018, Family and Community Day will no longer be a public holiday in the ACT. Replacing it is Reconciliation Day, held on the first Monday on or after May 27.

==Angola==
Celebrated on December 25.

== Canada ==

Nearly two-thirds of Canadians reside in a province that observes a statutory holiday on the third Monday of February. The holiday is called &quot;Family Day&quot; in five provinces (Alberta, British Columbia, New Brunswick, Ontario and Saskatchewan), &quot;Louis Riel Day&quot; in Manitoba, &quot;Islander Day&quot; in Prince Edward Island, and &quot;Heritage Day&quot; in Nova Scotia. There is no federally established Family Day.

This holiday was first observed in Alberta in 1990, followed by Saskatchewan in 2007 and Ontario in 2008. On May 28, 2012, the BC government announced that Family Day would be observed on the second Monday in February each year, starting February 11, 2013. In February 2018, the BC government announced that Family Day would move to the third Monday in February from 2019 onward, aligning the holiday with other Canadian provinces. In April 2017, the NB government announced the family statutory holiday to begin in February 2018. 

As a new holiday, there are no traditional activities that are associated with the day. Canadians use the long weekend for whatever purpose they like. In at least British Columbia, the decision to add this public holiday was due to the lengthy gap between the New Year&#x27;s Day and Good Friday public holidays. Otherwise, Canadian provinces have a public holiday at least every other month. 

Family Day is unrelated to National Family Week, a campaign put on each October by the Canadian Association of Family Resource Programs.

== Israel ==
In the 1990s, the last day of Shevat was declared Family Day () in Israel.

== Namibia ==

Family day is observed on 26th December and is distinguished from Christmas, allowing a focus on celebrating Christmas the day before, and a focus on spending time with family on the 26th. 

== South Africa ==
After 1995, Easter Monday was renamed Family Day.

== United States ==
Family Day is a state holiday in Nevada, celebrated on the day after Thanksgiving, i.e. the Friday following the fourth Thursday in November.

American Family Day is a state holiday in Arizona and has been celebrated on the first Sunday in August since 1978.

== Uruguay ==
In Uruguay, the public holiday on December 25 is officially known as Family Day () rather than Christmas, for the sake of secularism.

== Vanuatu ==
Family Day in Vanuatu is celebrated annually on December 26, traditionally Boxing Day, as a day on which school and work are suspended to spend the day giving thanks for and enjoying time with one&#x27;s family, often by engaging in civic and religious events and a festive meal.

== Vietnam ==
Vietnamese Family Day () occurs on the 28th of June each year, having been established in 2001. Family-oriented activities and events are organised throughout the country, although it is not a public holiday.

On Vietnamese Family Day, gift-giving is an 
important tradition. It serves as a meaningful expression of love and helps create lasting memories. People meticulously prepare and exchange thoughtful gifts, not only within their own families but also for neighbors and friends. However, the true essence of gift-giving lies in the spirit of sincerity and genuine appreciation.

<text>The 1950 World Series was the 47th World Series between the American and National Leagues for the championship of Major League Baseball. The Philadelphia Phillies as 1950 champions of the National League and the New York Yankees, as 1950 American League champions, competed to win a best-of-seven game series.

The Series began on Wednesday, October 4, and concluded Monday, October 9. The Phillies had home field advantage for the Series, meaning no games would be played at the Yankees&#x27; home ballpark, Yankee Stadium, until game 3. The Yankees won their 13th championship in their 41-year history, taking the Series in a four-game sweep. The final game in the Series resulted in the New York Yankees winning, 5–2 over Philadelphia. It was the only game in the Series decided by more than one run. The 1950 World Series title would be the second of a record five straight titles for the New York Yankees (1949–1953). The two teams would not again meet in the Series for 59 years.

This was also the last World Series to have no American born black players until 2022, as neither club had integrated in 1950. It was also the last World Series where television coverage was pooled between multiple networks: earlier that year the Mutual Broadcasting System, which had long been the radio home for the World Series, purchased the exclusive TV rights for the following season despite not (and indeed, never) having a television network. They would eventually sell on the rights to NBC, beginning a long relationship with the sport for that network.

The Yankees and Phillies faced each other again 59 years later in the 2009 World Series, in which the Yankees also won, this time in six games to win their 27th World Series championship.

==Teams==

===Philadelphia Phillies===

The Phillies, a particularly young team which came to be known as the &quot;Whiz Kids&quot;, had won the National League pennant in dramatic fashion on the final day of the season to garner their second pennant—their first in 35 years. But writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot; on October 3, 1950, John Drebinger picked the Yankees to win the Series in five games: &quot;The Stengelers simply have too much over-all pitching. They have the long range power. They rare defensive skill, and they have the poise and experience gained through the past four years which brought them two world championships and three pennants.&quot; Odds makers made the Yankees 2–5 favorites to win the Series.
Curt Simmons, a 17-game winner for the Phillies in 1950, had been called to military duty in September and was unavailable for this Series. Simmons was stationed at Camp Atterbury and requested and was granted a leave on October 4 to attend the Series. The Phillies chose not to request that Commissioner Chandler rule Simmons eligible for the Series but Simmons chose to attend to support the team. Simmons&#x27; place on the Series roster was taken by pitcher Jocko Thompson. Phillies ace Robin Roberts didn&#x27;t start Game 1 because he had had three starts in five days including the pennant winner on the final day of the regular season—played October 1, 1950 (three days before Game 1).

===New York Yankees===

The AL champion Yankees finished the regular season with a record of 98–56, three games ahead of the Detroit Tigers. Offensive team leaders were Phil Rizzuto (.324 batting average), Joe DiMaggio (32 home runs, .585 slugging percentage, and .979 OPS), and Yogi Berra (124 RBIs). Pitcher Vic Raschi led the team in wins, with a 21–8 record, and innings pitched. Rizzuto was voted the American League MVP, while Berra finished third, Raschi seventh, and DiMaggio ninth.

==Summary==
==Matchups==

===Game 1===

Because his #1 starter, Robin Roberts, had just pitched in three of the last five games of the frantic 1950 pennant race, Phils manager Eddie Sawyer surprised the world by naming his bullpen ace, Jim Konstanty, to open on the mound for Philadelphia, opposing 21-game winner Vic Raschi of the Yankees. Konstanty was outstanding, allowing just four hits and a run in eight innings, but Raschi was tougher, shutting out the Phils on only two hits en route to a 1–0 victory in the opener. The game&#x27;s only run came in the fourth when Bobby Brown hit a leadoff double and scored on two fly-outs, the last one a sacrifice fly by Jerry Coleman. This marked the third consecutive year that the World Series opened with a 1–0 game, and the third consecutive year a two-hitter was thrown in the opening game of the World Series.

===Game 2===

In what would be the last postseason game ever played in Shibe Park, 20-game winner Robin Roberts and Allie Reynolds both pitched outstanding baseball for nine innings, as strong pitching and stout defense again prevailed in the Series. Gene Woodling drove in Jerry Coleman, who walked with two outs and moved to second on a single, with an RBI single for a Yankee run in the second, and Richie Ashburn&#x27;s sacrifice fly scored Mike Goliat from third in the fifth, forcing a 1–1 tie which held up through nine full innings. This set the stage for Joe DiMaggio, leading off the tenth inning for the Yankees. With one swing, DiMaggio smashed a home run to left field to provide the difference in a 2–1 extra-inning win for the Yankees as the Series shifted to New York.

DiMaggio had a hand in holding the Phillies at bay long enough to get his key at-bat. Leading off the sixth inning, Del Ennis hit a deep fly to center, but DiMaggio made a spectacular over-the-shoulder running catch, near the marker at the base of the scoreboard in right-center. This play is far less well-known but was similar-looking to the famous Willie Mays catch in the 1954 World Series. DiMaggio made this play on the road, although in a ballpark which he played in during the regular season (Shibe Park was also the home of the Philadelphia A&#x27;s). Because there was nobody on when the ball was hit, he was not in a hurry to get the ball back to the infield (Mays&#x27; famous 1954 catch was deeper, with two runners on base and nobody out when the ball was hit).

===Game 3===


Phils lefty Ken Heintzelman started the third game against Yankee stalwart Eddie Lopat. The Yankees struck first in the third when Phil Rizzuto walked with two outs, stole second and scored on a single by Jerry Coleman, who was tagged out at second to end the inning. In the sixth, Del Ennis doubled with two outs and scored on Dick Sisler&#x27;s single to tie the game. Next inning Granny Hamner hit a leadoff single, moved to second on a sacrifice bunt and scored on Mike Goliat&#x27;s single to put the Phillies up 2–1. Heintzelman continued the Phils&#x27; great pitching into the eighth inning, when he lost control and walked the bases loaded after two outs. Konstanty relieved him and got Bobby Brown to ground to shortstop Granny Hamner, but Hamner misplayed the ball to allow the tying run to score. Russ Meyer came on for the Phillies in the last of the ninth. After retiring the first two batters, Meyer allowed consecutive singles to set the stage for Jerry Coleman, who drove in the winning run with a base hit to give the Yankees a 3–2 win.

In attendance at the game was Grover Cleveland Alexander, who had led the Phillies to their previous pennant in 1915. It was his first World Series game in 20 years. Ill from the effects of long term alcohol abuse, Alexander was generally ignored. He would be dead less than a month later on November 4, 1950, at age 63.

===Game 4===

Phillies starter Bob Miller matched up against rookie Whitey Ford, making his first World Series appearance, as the Yankees tried to wrap up the Series in four straight. New York scored two runs in the first inning when Gene Woodling reached when second baseman Mike Goliat misplayed his ground ball, moved to second on a ground ball, and scored on Yogi Berra&#x27;s single. After a wild pitch, Joe DiMaggio&#x27;s RBI double made it 2–0 Yankees. Berra hit a leadoff home run in the sixth off of Jim Konstanty, who then hit DiMaggio with a pitch. After a groundout, Bobby Brown&#x27;s RBI triple and Hank Bauer&#x27;s sacrifice fly made it 5–0 Yankees. The first two Phils reached base in the ninth via a single and hit-by-pitch before Ford got the next two outs. Andy Seminick then flied to left, but left fielder Gene Woodling dropped what looked like the Series-ending out, allowing two runs to score. Mike Goliat kept the inning going with a hit, and Stengel removed Ford to bring in Allie Reynolds. Reynolds struck out pinch-hitter Stan Lopata, giving the Yanks a 5–2 win and the World Series victory.

The Phillies failed to hit a home run in the entire World Series. No other team has matched that dubious feat since.

==Composite box==
1950 World Series (4–0): New York Yankees (A.L.) over Philadelphia Phillies (N.L.)

The winning margin of six runs remains the lowest for a four-game sweep, later equaled in 2005.

==Earned runs==
* During the Series, the New York Yankees pitching rotation only allowed three earned runs and finished the Fall Classic with a combined 0.73 ERA. The other pitching staffs with a combined World Series ERA less than 1.00:

<doc id="1332293" wikidata="Q2363552" url="?curid=1332293" title="Popcorn (novel)">
<text>Popcorn is a 1996 novel by the British writer Ben Elton. It shares themes with a number of movies from the mid-1990s, most notably &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot; by Oliver Stone and &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; and &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; by Quentin Tarantino. The play version of the novel has been used by the IEB (Independent Education Board) In South Africa as one of their Postmodern set-work plays for Dramatic Arts.

== Plot summary ==
The book takes place in different parts of Los Angeles, California. The date is never actually specified, but various clues suggest it is set in the near future. Mostly the story takes place in the centre of Hollywood. The book depicts the differences between different social groups in America, from rich people with guards like Bruce Delamitri to poorer people Wayne and Scout.

The protagonist, Bruce Delamitiri, is an artist who works in the motion picture industry. Many people in the US think that, by making these movies, Bruce makes killing cool. Numerous characters throughout the book imply that he encourages everyone who&#x27;s watching these movies to kill for fun. Bruce, on the other hand, defends himself by telling everyone that he doesn&#x27;t think he encourages anyone to do anything. He says that there has always been violence but humans are not like robots; seeing something on the screen does not necessarily make us want to do it ourselves (p. 13 &quot;people get up from the movie theatre or the TV and do what they just saw&quot;). He also claims that he is just showing existing violence. 

Unfortunately for Bruce, Wayne and Scout (a pair of psychopaths known in the media as the &quot;Mall Murderers&quot;) have formulated a plan to hold him hostage and have him publicly announce that his movies are responsible for their crimes so they can avoid the death penalty (Wayne has a lengthy speech giving examples of how in America it is possible to be guilty and innocent at the same time.) As the novel progresses, Bruce and a critically injured Brooke Daniels are joined inside his house by his wife and daughter and a TV camera crew. The siege reaches its climax as Wayne holds a ratings monitor and announces on live TV that he will spare the hostages if everyone stops watching the siege in the next few minutes - however, this does not happen and he begins firing as the LAPD begin a frantic attempt to subdue him.

Many of the characters die in the ensuing violence and the epilogue of the story reveals grim details as to how all the survivors have found a way of escaping responsibility for the tragedy using varying routes from lawsuits and finding religion to making documentaries which explicitly blame everyone else. The book ends with the line &quot;No one has taken responsibility&quot; — echoing an earlier rant by Bruce that we have created a blame free society in which any problem or shortcoming can be blamed on others rather than accepting responsibility for our own actions.

== Characters ==
* Bruce Delamitri – the main protagonist, an egocentric filmmaker who has become controversial for the celluloid violence he produces.
* Wayne – A cruel and immoral killer.
* Scout – Wayne&#x27;s lover and confidant.
* Brooke Daniels – A vaguely abnormal model and aspiring actress.
* Velvet Delamitri – Bruce&#x27;s estranged daughter.
* Farrah Delamitri – Bruce&#x27;s estranged wife.
* Karl Brezner – Bruce&#x27;s agent.

== Awards and nominations ==
It won the 1996 Crime Writers&#x27; Association&#x27;s Gold Dagger Award.

== Theatrical version ==

Elton penned a play based on the novel, which premiered at the Nottingham Playhouse in 1996, and later played in London&#x27;s West End.

<text>The 1962 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball&#x27;s (MLB) 1962 season. The 59th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff that matched the defending American League (AL) and World Series champion New York Yankees against the National League (NL) champion San Francisco Giants. The Yankees won the series in seven games for the 20th championship in team history. It is best remembered for its dramatic conclusion in Game 7; with runners on second and third base and two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning, the Giants’ Willie McCovey hit a hard line drive that was caught by Yankees second baseman Bobby Richardson to preserve New York&#x27;s one-run victory. Yankees pitcher Ralph Terry was named the World Series Most Valuable Player.

The Giants had won their first NL pennant since 1954 and first since moving from New York in 1958. They advanced by defeating the Los Angeles Dodgers in a three-game playoff. The Giants had a higher cumulative batting average (.226 to .199) and lower earned run average (2.66 to 2.95), had more hits (51 to 44), runs (21 to 20), hit more home runs (5 to 3), triples (2 to 1) and doubles (10 to 6), yet lost the Series. They would not return to the World Series for another 27 years.

The Yankees had won their first World Series in 1923; of the 40 Series played between 1923 and 1962, the Yankees won half. After a long dominance of the World Series picture, the Yankees would not win another World Series for 15 years despite appearances in 1963, 1964, and 1976.

This World Series, which was closely matched in every game, is also remembered for its then-record length of 13 days, caused by postponements due to rain in both cities.

==Summary==

NOTE: the series was originally scheduled to begin October 3, but was moved back one day due to the three-game playoff between the Giants and Dodgers to determine the National League pennant.&lt;br&gt;
: postponed from October 9 due to rain&lt;br&gt;
: postponed from October 11 due to rain

==Matchups==

===Game 1===


Roger Maris&#x27; two-run double in the first inning off Billy O&#x27;Dell set up Yankee starter Whitey Ford with a lead, but Willie Mays scored for the Giants on Jose Pagan&#x27;s single in the second, ending Ford&#x27;s record World Series consecutive scoreless inning streak at . Chuck Hiller&#x27;s double and Felipe Alou&#x27;s single in the third tied the game, but the Yankees broke the tie in the seventh on Clete Boyer&#x27;s home run. Next inning, Dale Long followed a single and hit-by-pitch with an RBI single to make it 4–2 Yankees and knock O&#x27;Dell out of the game. Boyer&#x27;s sacrifice fly off Don Larsen extended their lead to 5–2. The Yankees got a final run in the ninth on Elston Howard&#x27;s RBI single off Stu Miller, the run charged to Larsen. Ford&#x27;s complete-game victory was the first of six in the series, four for the Yankees and two for the Giants.

===Game 2===


The Giants scored two runs in Game 2, in the first when Chuck Hiller hit a leadoff double off Ralph Terry and scored on two ground outs, then in the seventh when Willie McCovey smashed a tremendous home run over the right-field fence to boost 24-game winner Jack Sanford to a 2–0 shutout of the Yankees, who managed only three hits.

===Game 3===


The Yankees ended a scoreless tie in the seventh with three runs. After two leadoff singles, Roger Maris drove a base hit off starter Billy Pierce for two runs, then after moving to third on a sacrifice fly, he scored the eventual winning run on Clete Boyer&#x27;s groundout off Don Larsen when the Giants were unable to turn an inning-ending double play. Giants catcher Ed Bailey&#x27;s two-run home run in the top of the ninth off Bill Stafford left them a run short.

===Game 4===


For the second time in as many games, a Giants catcher stroked a two-run home run, when Tom Haller hit one off Whitey Ford in the second inning. After the Yankees tied the score at 2–2 in the sixth on back-to-back walks off reliever Bobby Bolin followed by back-to-back RBI singles by Bill Skowron and Clete Boyer, second baseman Chuck Hiller hit the first National League grand slam in World Series history in the seventh off Marshall Bridges with two of the runs charged to reliever Jim Coates. The Giants scored another run in the ninth off Bridges when Matty Alou hit a leadoff single, moved to second on a sacrifice bunt, and scored on Chuck Hiller&#x27;s single. The Yankees got that run back on three straight two-out singles off Billy O&#x27;Dell, the last an RBI single by Tom Tresh, but Mickey Mantle hit into a forceout to end the game as the Giants won 7–3. This game marked the only World Series appearance for Juan Marichal, who started for the Giants. Marichal smashed the thumb on his pitching hand while attempting to bunt in the top of the fifth, and was placed on the disabled list for the remainder of the series.

Don Larsen was the winning pitcher in relief, six years to the day after (and in the same stadium of) his perfect game in the 1956 World Series.

The Giants&#x27; win tied the series at two games apiece and guaranteed a return trip to San Francisco.

===Game 5===


Games 5 and 6 were postponed by rain. Game 5 at New York was pushed back one day, but Game 6 in San Francisco was pushed back four days due to torrential rain on the West Coast. Three of the longest World Series in terms of total days, due to various postponements, involved the Giants: the 1911 and the 1989 were the other two.

In Game 5, hot-hitting José Pagán hit a leadoff single in the third off Ralph Terry, moved to second on a sacrifice bunt, then scored on Chuck Hiller&#x27;s RBI single. After a wild pitch from Jack Sanford tied the game in the fourth, Pagan&#x27;s home run in the fifth put the Giants back in front 2–1, but another wild pitch in the sixth by Sanford tied the game again. In the eighth, Bobby Richardson and Tony Kubek hit back-to-back singles before Tom Tresh hit the game-winning three-run home run. The Giants scored a run in the ninth when Willie McCovey hit a leadoff single and scored on Tom Haller&#x27;s one-out double, but Terry retired the next two hitters to end the game. With the series returning to San Francisco the Yankees had the edge, three games to two, only to have the sixth game delayed four days by rain.

===Game 6===


In a battle of left-handed starting pitchers, Billy Pierce outdueled Whitey Ford with a complete-game three-hitter as the Giants evened the series at three wins apiece with a 5–2 victory. They struck first in the fourth when after a single and walk, an error on an attempted pickoff by Ford allowed a run to score, then Orlando Cepeda&#x27;s double and Jim Davenport&#x27;s single scored a run each. They added to their lead next inning on RBI singles by Felipe Alou and Cepeda. The Yankees&#x27; only runs came on a Maris home run in the fifth inning and an RBI single by Tony Kubek in the eighth inning after a one-out double.

===Game 7===


The only run of this classic game came in the fifth inning when Tony Kubek grounded into a double play, Bill Skowron scoring from third. Ralph Terry, pitching the seventh game instead of Jim Bouton because of the rain delays, had given up Bill Mazeroski&#x27;s Series-winning walk-off home run two years earlier in Pittsburgh, but in his third start stifled the Giants&#x27; power hitters. In the bottom of the ninth, pinch-hitter Matty Alou, batting for reliever Billy O&#x27;Dell, led off the inning with a bunt hit after first having a foul ball dropped, but Terry struck out the next two batters, Felipe Alou and Hiller. Mays hit a double into the right-field corner, but Maris played the carom well, then hit cutoff man Richardson with a throw that was quickly relayed home. Alou, aware of Maris&#x27; strong arm, stopped at third. Facing Willie McCovey with two outs, Terry elected to pitch to him rather than walk the bases loaded, which would have brought up slugger Orlando Cepeda. Terry&#x27;s inside fastball on the second pitch handcuffed McCovey, who nonetheless adjusted his bat in mid-swing to extend his arms and hit a bullet right at Richardson for the final out. Terry was named the World Series MVP after posting a 2–1 record with two complete games pitched, a shutout, 16 strikeouts, five earned runs off 17 hits, and a 1.80 ERA in 25 innings pitched.

The Yankees won their 20th World Series; they would not win another until 1977. The Giants would not win another National League pennant until 1989, when they would lose the World Series to the Oakland A&#x27;s in a series interrupted by a major earthquake. San Francisco returned to the World Series in 2002 but lost in seven games to the Anaheim Angels. The San Francisco Giants would finally win the World Series for the first time in 2010 (against Texas) their first since 1954 when they were still located in New York. They would go on to win two more in 2012 (against Detroit) and again in 2014 (against Kansas City).

==Aftermath==
The season was a high-mark for Dark in San Francisco, despite some close brushes for further success. Despite winning 88 and 90 games in the next two years, the Giants could only take solace in finishing in the top division of the National League (until division play was instituted in 1969), and Dark was fired after the 1964 season; until 1972, the Giants would finish fourth or better but not win another pennant until 1989. The Yankees would win two further pennants in the 1960s, which included trips to the Series for Houk and then Berra when the former moved to the front office; the Yankees lost both times before the Yankee dynasty soon began to crumble under the chains of retiring players and new management, which resulted in a decade long drought.

For the &quot;Peanuts&quot; comic strip of December 22, 1962, cartoonist and Giants fan Charles M. Schulz depicted Charlie Brown sitting glumly with Linus, lamenting in the last panel, &quot;Why couldn&#x27;t McCovey have hit the ball just three feet higher?&quot; The January 28, 1963, strip featured a nearly identical scene, except in the last panel Charlie Brown moaned, &quot;Or why couldn&#x27;t McCovey have hit the ball even &quot;two&quot; feet higher?&quot;

During the 1981 Major League Baseball strike, Giants radio flagship KNBR rebroadcast Game 7, electronically re-editing NBC Radio announcer George Kell&#x27;s description to make it sound as if McCovey&#x27;s ninth-inning liner had gotten past Richardson, with Alou and Mays scoring to win the game and Series for San Francisco.

The 1962 Dodgers and Giants were the first among California MLB teams to win 100 games in a season. In such seasons by the Giants, Dodgers, Athletics, and Angels (the Padres have yet to win 100 games in a season), those teams have won 100 games or more 17 times, but did not win a World Series in any of those seasons. To date, no California team to has won a World Series with 100 wins or more in a single-season. 

48 years later, following additional World Series losses in and , the Giants would finally bring the first Series championship to San Francisco in . During Ring Night ceremonies in April 2011, Mays, McCovey, and Cepeda received honorary 2010 World Series rings.

<text>The 1961 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball&#x27;s (MLB) 1961 season. The 58th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff that matched the American League (AL) champion New York Yankees against the National League (NL) champion Cincinnati Reds. The Yankees won in five games to earn their 19th championship in 39 seasons. Yankees pitcher Whitey Ford was named the World Series Most Valuable Player, winning two games over 14 scoreless innings, including a complete game shutout in Game 1.

This World Series was surrounded by Cold War political puns pitting the &quot;Reds&quot; against the &quot;Yanks.&quot; The louder buzz concerned the &quot;M&amp;M Boys&quot;, Yankees hitters Roger Maris and Mickey Mantle, who had spent the season pursuing Babe Ruth&#x27;s single-season home run record of 60 set in 1927; Mantle finished with 54 while Maris set the record of 61 on the last day of the season.

The Yankees were under the leadership of first-year manager Ralph Houk, a long-time Yankee backup catcher who had succeeded Casey Stengel. The Yankees won the AL pennant, finishing eight games better than the Detroit Tigers. The Yankees also set an MLB record for most home runs in a season with 240. Along with Maris and Mantle, four other Yankees, Yogi Berra, Elston Howard, Bill Skowron, and Johnny Blanchard, hit more than 20 home runs. The pitching staff was led by the Cy Young Award-winner Ford (25–4, 3.21 earned run average).

The underdog Reds, skippered by Fred Hutchinson, finished four games ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL and boasted four 20-plus home run hitters of their own: NL MVP Frank Robinson, Gordy Coleman, Gene Freese and Wally Post. The second-base, shortstop, and catcher positions were platooned, while center fielder Vada Pinson led the league in hits with 208 and finished second in batting with a .343 average. Joey Jay (21–10, 3.53) led the staff, along with Jim O&#x27;Toole and Bob Purkey.

Ford left the sixth inning of Game 4 due to an injured ankle. He set the record for consecutive scoreless innings during World Series play with 32, when, during the third inning he passed the previous record holder, Babe Ruth, who had pitched consecutive scoreless innings for the Boston Red Sox in and . Ford would extend that record to in the 1962 World Series.

The 1961 five-game series was the shortest since , when the New York Giants swept the Cleveland Indians in four games. The Yankees and the Reds would meet again 15 years later in the 1976 World Series, which the Reds would win in a four-game sweep.

==Summary==
==Matchups==

===Game 1===


At Yankee Stadium, Whitey Ford tossed his third straight World Series shutout. A fourth-inning home run into the lower right-field stands by Elston Howard was all Ford would need. Moose Skowron added a sixth-inning shot into the lower left-field to make it 2–0. The two-hour, 11-minute game featured only two hits by the Reds, a first-inning single by Eddie Kasko and another in the fifth by Wally Post. The only other Reds baserunner was Frank Robinson, who walked in the seventh. Ford had six strikeouts. Jim O&#x27;Toole allowed six hits in seven innings.

Ford was also aided by two excellent defensive plays by third baseman Clete Boyer. In the second inning, Boyer backhanded a ground ball by Reds third baseman Gene Freese close to the bag, wheeled, and threw him out from his knees. In the eighth, Boyer dove to his left onto his stomach after a Dick Gernert ground and also threw Gernert out from his knees.

===Game 2===

The Reds came charging back to win Game 2 and even the series on the superb pitching of Joey Jay. Reds first baseman Gordy Coleman and Yankees&#x27; left-fielder Yogi Berra traded two-run homers in the fourth. Coleman hit his into the right-center field bleachers after Frank Robinson reached on an error by Yankees&#x27; third-baseman Clete Boyer. After Roger Maris led off the bottom half of the inning with a walk, Berra tied the score with a drive into the lower right-field stands.

From there, Jay would give up only two more hits, a Berra single in the sixth and a Tony Kubek single in the eighth. The Reds went ahead for good with two outs in the fifth when Elio Chacón sprinted home from third on an Elston Howard passed ball that didn&#x27;t get much further than away. They added one run in the fifth and two in the eighth. Yankee starter Ralph Terry would give up one more run in the sixth on a Wally Post double and a run- scoring single by eighth-place hitter Johnny Edwards, before being lifted in the seventh for pinch-hitter Héctor López.

Luis Arroyo took over in the eighth and walked Robinson, gave up an infield single to Coleman on a roller between third and the mound, and then threw wild to first, with Robinson scoring; Coleman was thrown out trying for third. The next batter, Wally Post, reached safely when Berra misplayed his fly for a three-base error. With Post on third, Gene Freese was intentionally walked for the second time in the game and Edwards followed with his second hit, a bloop double to left, scoring Post. Jay would seal the victory for the Reds by retiring six of the remaining seven batters, allowing only a walk to Clete Boyer in the ninth.

The series shifted to Cincinnati for three games, with the pressure on the Yankees after a split in New York. After falling to a perceived inferior team (the Pittsburgh Pirates) in the seven-game walk-off 1960 World Series, a loss that cost long-time manager Casey Stengel his job, fans and media were wondering if it could happen again: the Yankees had only scored four runs and gotten 10 hits in the first two games, and their vaunted &quot;M&amp;M Boys&quot; were struggling.

===Game 3===

Cincinnati hosted its first World Series in 21 years at Crosley Field. 99-year-old Dummy Hoy, a former Red and the oldest living former Major League player at the time, threw out the first pitch. He would die two months later following a stroke, five months short of his 100th birthday.

Game 3 pitted New York&#x27;s 23-year-old right-hander Bill Stafford against Reds&#x27; veteran knuckleballer Bob Purkey. Stafford pitched well for innings. Purkey also had outstanding control and kept the Yankee hitters off balance, but New York triumphed on a Maris home run in the ninth. While the Yankees&#x27; offense still was stagnant, it was just good enough.

Cincinnati struck first with a run in the bottom of the third when Elio Chacón beat out a bunt and took second when Stafford threw wildly to first. Eddie Kasko fouled out to Bill Skowron and Vada Pinson grounded out to send Chacón to third before Frank Robinson hit a double off the left-field wall to make it 1–0.

In the seventh, the Yankees got a big break to tie the game. Tony Kubek led off with a single to center, then took second on a Johnny Edwards passed ball. After Mickey Mantle struck out, Yogi Berra blooped a ball into short right field that neither second baseman Chacón nor right fielder Robinson called before the two collided, allowing the ball to drop and Kubek to score. The Reds regained the lead in their half of the inning when Edwards doubled into the right-field corner and eventually scored on a Kasko single to left. Bud Daley came in to relieve Stafford and retired Pinson on a flyout to right to end the inning.

The Reds&#x27; lead was short-lived, as the Yankees tied the score in the eighth. With two outs, Johnny Blanchard (pinch-hitting for Daley), smacked a Purkey knuckler into the right-field bleachers. The Reds went quietly in the bottom of the inning, the score tied at 2–2.

In the ninth, Maris recorded the first of his only two hits in the Series, but this one went into the right-field bleachers for a go-ahead home run. With ace reliever Luis Arroyo on the mound for the Yankees in the ninth, the Reds had one last shot. After Gene Freese struck out, Leo Cárdenas, batting for Johnny Edwards, doubled off the left-center field scoreboard. Dick Gernert, pinch-hitting for Purkey, grounded to short, Cardenas holding. The third pinch-hitter in the inning, Gus Bell, ended the Reds&#x27; comeback attempt by grounding back to the mound, Arroyo to Skowron, to end the thriller and give the Yankees a two games to one Series lead.

===Game 4===

Whitey Ford started Game 4 for the Yankees in an attempt to continue his post-season shutout streak, but more importantly to give the Bombers a 3–1 lead in the Series. He accomplished both. Ford retired the first nine batters of the game; when Elio Chacón grounded out to Bobby Richardson at second base for the final out in the third, Ford broke Babe Ruth&#x27;s record of consecutive scoreless innings. Ford remained in the game until the end of the fifth, when an apparent ankle injury forced him to leave, his new record at 32 consecutive scoreless innings. Jim Coates entered the game in the sixth and pitched four scoreless innings.

The Yankees scored the game&#x27;s first run in the fourth. Roger Maris led off with a walk and went to third on a single to left-center by Mickey Mantle. Elston Howard grounded into a double play, Maris scoring. The Yankees added another run in the fifth on a walk to Ford, a Bobby Richardson single to right-center and a run-scoring single by in Tony Kubek.

In the sixth, O&#x27;Toole was relieved by Jim Brosnan who got into a jam. With one out, Howard doubled to right-center. After Yogi Berra was intentionally walked, Skowron loaded the bases by beating out a slow roller to third. Clete Boyer then doubled to left to plate two runs. The Yankees put on the safety squeeze, only to have Ford bunt right to Reds first baseman Gordy Coleman who tagged first base. Boyer had moved to third and Skowron had come halfway home before stopping. Coleman then raced across the diamond and tagged Skowron, who was trapped between third and home, for an unassisted double play.

The Yankees would add three more runs in the seventh to put the game away. New York&#x27;s seven-run output equaled what the Bronx Bombers were able to put up combined in their first three games as solid Reds starting pitching, combined with a wounded Mantle, kept the New York offense sputtering. That would change in Game 5.

===Game 5===


Future Hall-of-Famers Yogi Berra and Mickey Mantle sat out Game 5, Berra with a stiff shoulder, Mantle still suffering from a hip abscess. But substitutes Héctor López and Johnny Blanchard more than made up for the absence of the two stars. Lopez drove in five runs with a triple, a home run and a sacrifice bunt, and Blanchard had three hits, including a double and a homer.

In the first four games, the Yankees scored a total of nine runs off Cincinnati&#x27;s starting pitchers. In Game 5, New York scored five in the first inning. Reds starter Joey Jay, with 14 regular-season complete games, would uncharacteristically get just two outs before being relieved. After Bobby Richardson singled to start the game, Jay retired Tony Kubek and Roger Maris on fly balls. But the flood gates opened when Blanchard hit a two-run homer into the right-field bleachers. Elston Howard was awarded a ground-rule double when his blast went through an opening in the left-center field scoreboard. Bill Skowron followed with a long single off the left-field fence, scoring Howard. Jim Maloney entered the game and was greeted with a Lopez triple that scored Skowron. Clete Boyer continued the assault doubling off the scoreboard, scoring Lopez. The ninth batter of the inning, Yankee pitcher Ralph Terry struck out to end the inning but not until five Yankees had touched home plate.

New York added to its lead in the second on a Kubek single and a Maris double just inside the left-field line. The Reds cut the lead in half in the bottom of the third and chased Terry in the process. Don Blasingame led off with a single to center, Eddie Kasko singled to left and Vada Pinson hit a fly moving Blasingame to third. Frank Robinson then took Terry deep with a three-run shot over the right-center field fence. Bud Daley replaced Terry and shut the door on the Reds.

The Yankee offense added to its lead with five runs in the fourth, the big blows were a two-run single by Skowron and a three-run home run to dead center by Lopez. The Reds got a little closer after scoring two runs in the bottom of the fifth (on a two-run Wally Post home run) to cut it to 11–5. Then Yankees finished the rout by added two more runs in the sixth on sacrifices by Lopez (on a squeeze play) and Daley (on a fly ball).

This was the final World Series game ever played at Crosley Field, and the last postseason game in Cincinnati until the team moved to Riverfront Stadium in 1970.

Houk became only the third skipper in history to win the World Series in his first season.

<text>The 1959 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball&#x27;s (MLB) 1959 season. The 56th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff that matched the National League (NL) champion Los Angeles Dodgers against the American League (AL) champion Chicago White Sox. The Dodgers won in six games to earn the second championship in their history and their first since moving to Los Angeles from Brooklyn the season before. Each of the three games played at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum drew record crowds, Game 5&#x27;s attendance of 92,706 continues to be a World Series record to this day, and one that cannot feasibly be broken in any current baseball-specific park.

This was the first World Series played on the West Coast, outside Major League Baseball&#x27;s traditional territory that stretched from Boston to Washington, D.C., in the East and to St. Louis in the Midwest from 1876 through 1955, which ended when the Philadelphia Athletics moved to Kansas City. A West Coast World Series had become a possibility only a year before, when the Dodgers and the Giants relocated to Los Angeles and San Francisco (from Brooklyn and Manhattan, respectively) prior to the 1958 season.

For the White Sox, who had last won a championship in , it was their first World Series appearance since , when the team&#x27;s unexpected loss to the Cincinnati Reds coincided with the Black Sox Scandal. This was the only World Series to be played in the City of Chicago between the Cubs&#x27; loss in and the White Sox win in 2005.

The Dodgers won their first National League pennant since moving from Brooklyn after the 1957 season by defeating the Milwaukee Braves (another franchise that had relocated from their original city, Boston, in 1953) 2–0 in a best-of-three tie breaker series. The Dodgers&#x27; first world championship in Los Angeles, the win was their second World Series victory in franchise history and their second in five seasons, after beating the New York Yankees in 1955. This was also the Dodgers&#x27; only win as a tenant of the Coliseum; their next World Series victories would come when playing in Dodger Stadium.

1955 was their first win in the Fall Classic after seven consecutive losses between 1916 and 1953. While the Brooklyn Dodgers had gone 1–8 in the World Series, the Los Angeles Dodgers have gone 7-6 through their 13 appearances between 1959 and 2024.

It was the first championship for a West Coast team, and it was the first World Series in which no pitcher for either side pitched a complete game. As Vin Scully remarked in his narration for the official World Series film, &quot;What a change of scenery!&quot; This was the only Fall Classic played during the period from 1949 through 1964 in which no games were played in New York City.

==Route to the World Series==
===Dodgers===
After finishing seventh in 1958, the Dodgers rebounded in 1959. The National League pennant race was a season-long three-way battle between the Dodgers, the two-time defending N.L. champion Milwaukee Braves and the San Francisco Giants. The Dodgers never led by more than two games (and that was at the end of a tie-breaker) and never trailed by more than five. On September 20, the Dodgers completed a three-game sweep in San Francisco so that, with five games to play, they had a game lead on the Braves and a one-game lead over the Giants. Going into the final day, the Dodgers and Braves were tied for first and the Giants were games back; the Giants needed to sweep a doubleheader from the Cardinals and have the Dodgers and Braves both lose to force a three-way tie. But the Dodgers won in Chicago 7–1 and the Braves won at home against the Phillies 5–2; this made the fact that the Giants lost both games of their doubleheader irrelevant.

In Game 1 of the best-of-three playoff in Milwaukee, the Dodgers took a 3–2 lead in the top of the sixth inning. Dodger reliever Larry Sherry then retired 12 of the last 13 Braves hitters to secure the win.

Games 2 and 3 (if necessary) were scheduled for Los Angeles. In Game 2, the Dodgers trailed 5–2 in the ninth inning, but rallied to tie the game with five singles and a sacrifice fly. In the top of the 11th, the Braves loaded the bases with two out, but Stan Williams got pinch hitter Joe Adcock to ground out to end the threat. In the bottom of the 12th, Gil Hodges drew a walk with two out and nobody on. Joe Pignatano singled Hodges to second. Carl Furillo hit a ground ball to shortstop Félix Mantilla; Mantilla&#x27;s throw to first base was in the dirt and skipped past Frank Torre, allowing Hodges to score all the way from second with the pennant-clinching run.

===White Sox===
Managed by Al López, the White Sox were built on pitching, speed and defense. Nicknamed the &quot;Go-go Sox&quot;, they were last in the A.L. in home runs but led the league in stolen bases, fielding percentage, and lowest team ERA. They battled the Cleveland Indians for the American League pennant, and after a close race, the White Sox built a game lead in early September. The Indians could get no closer than games, and when the White Sox beat Cleveland 4–2 on September 22, they clinched the pennant with three games to play. The White Sox were only the second team besides the Yankees to win the A.L. pennant between 1949 and 1964 inclusive; the other was the 1954 Indians, also managed by Al López.

==Summary==
==Matchups==
===Game 1===


Historic Comiskey Park hosted a crowd of 48,103 that included Hollywood&#x27;s Joan Crawford and Orson Welles and former Illinois governor Adlai Stevenson, the 1952 and 1956 Democratic presidential candidate for president.

Game 1 was the first championship game in 40 years for the White Sox as well as the first postseason game in Chicago in 14 years, when the Chicago Cubs lost to the Detroit Tigers in Game 7 of 1945 World Series.

On the pitching mound, Early Wynn of the White Sox faced Roger Craig of the Dodgers. After scoring twice in the first inning on back-to-back RBI singles by Ted Kluszewski and Sherm Lollar after a walk and single, the Sox pounded across seven runs in the third. Nellie Fox doubled with one out and scored on Jim Landis&#x27;s single before Kluszewski&#x27;s two-run home run knocked Craig out of the game. Lollar reached second on an error off of Chuck Churn and scored on Billy Goodman&#x27;s single. Then RBI doubles by Al Smith and Early Wynn and fielder&#x27;s choice by Jim Rivera aided by two more errors made it 9–0 White Sox. Ted Kluszewski&#x27;s second home run of the game off of Churn next inning capped the game&#x27;s scoring as the Sox routed the Dodgers 11–0.

===Game 2===


Game 2 featured Bob Shaw of the White Sox face Johnny Podres of the Dodgers. Once again, the Sox jumped out to a quick 2–0 lead in the first inning on Ted Kluszewski&#x27;s RBI groundout with runners on first and third followed by Sherm Lollar&#x27;s RBI single. In the fifth, Charlie Neal homered for the first Dodger run of the series. Chuck Essegian&#x27;s two-out home run tied the game tied 2–2 in the seventh, then after a walk, Neal hit his second home run of the day to put the Dodgers ahead for the first time, 4–2. During a Sox uprising in the eighth against Larry Sherry, Al Smith doubled to left with two men on, cutting the lead to 4–3. However, Sherm Lollar was thrown out by a mile at the plate trying to score due to Wally Moon faking a catch that fooled Lollar. Sherry pitched a perfect ninth to notch a save and give the Dodgers the win.

===Game 3===


In contrast to the crowd of 36,528 for the tie-breaker playoff game at the Los Angeles Coliseum, 92,394 showed up for the first World Series game ever played on the West Coast. Dick Donovan faced off against the host team&#x27;s Don Drysdale in Game 3. Six scoreless innings were thrown by the two, with Donovan giving up only one hit. However, Donovan would load the bases in the seventh inning on two walks and a single before being replaced by Gerry Staley. A single by Carl Furillo scored two runs. Drysdale allowed two singles and Larry Sherry hit a batter to load the bases with no outs in the eighth, but gave up just a run on Al Smith&#x27;s double play. The Dodgers got that run back in the bottom half when Maury Wills hit a leadoff single off of Gerry Staley and scored on Charlie Neal&#x27;s double. Sherry shut down the Sox in the ninth as the Dodgers won, 3–1 despite being outhit 12–5. The White Sox stranded 11 runners and were 0–for–7 with them in scoring position.

===Game 4===


Early Wynn and Roger Craig faced off against each other once again before a crowd of 92,650. Wynn was knocked out by a four-run Dodger third inning. Wally Moon singled with two outs and scored on Norm Larker&#x27;s single. Larker, who moved to second on an error, scored on Gil Hodges&#x27;s single. Hodges moved to third on a Don Demeter single and scored on a passed ball, then John Roseboro&#x27;s RBI single capped the inning&#x27;s scoring. The Sox tied the game in the seventh on Ted Kluszewski&#x27;s RBI single with two on followed by Sherm Lollar socking a three-run home run, but Gil Hodges blasted one over the fence in the next inning off of Gerry Staley to give the Dodgers a 5–4 lead, then Larry Sherry pitched a scoreless ninth to put the Dodgers a win away from the World Series championship.

===Game 5===


A record-breaking crowd of 92,706 turned out, a majority hoping to celebrate a Los Angeles championship. For the first time in World Series history, however, three pitchers combined for a shutout, as Bob Shaw, Billy Pierce and Dick Donovan quieted the Dodgers and their fans 1–0 in Game 5, sending the series back to Chicago. The game&#x27;s only run scored in the fourth off starter Sandy Koufax, coming when Nellie Fox scored as Lollar grounded into a double play. To date, this remains the largest crowd in World Series history.

===Game 6===


The victory in Game 5 gave the Sox hope, heading back home to a &quot;real ballpark,&quot; as opposed to L.A.&#x27;s converted football stadium. But the change in scenery was no help. Early Wynn started with only two days rest, and after surrendering two runs in the third inning on Duke Snider&#x27;s home run after a walk, the Dodgers broke open the game with six more in the fourth. Norm Larker hit a leadoff single, moved to second on a sacrifice bunt, and scored on Maury Wills&#x27;s single. Wills scored on Johnny Podres&#x27;s double to knock Wynn out of the game. Dick Donovan walked Jim Gilliam before allowing a two-run double to Charlie Neal and two-run home run to Wally Moon to make it 8–0 Dodgers. Starter Podres was also knocked out in the fourth by Chicago&#x27;s last gasp, another towering three-run home run by the hottest Sox hitter, Ted Kluszewski, after a walk and hit-by-pitch. In the ninth inning, Chuck Essegian set a World Series record with his second pinch-hit home run of the Series off of Ray Moore, and the Dodgers captured their first championship as a Los Angeles team. Relief pitcher Larry Sherry was voted Most Valuable Player of the Series after finishing with a 2–0 record, two saves, five strikeouts, and a 0.71 ERA, allowing only one earned run off eight hits in 12 innings pitched.

==Composite line score==
1959 World Series (4–2): Los Angeles Dodgers (N.L.) over Chicago White Sox (A.L.)
==Records and unique characteristics==
The Dodgers found an unlikely hero when Chuck Essegian, who hit only one home run in 1959 and had only six in his career to that point, set a World Series record with two pinch-hit home runs.

Due to the best-of-three N.L. playoff, Game 1 was deferred from Wednesday, September 30, to Thursday, October 1. The normal travel days were retained between Games 2 and 3, and Games 5 and 6, resulting in the rare event of a Series with no Saturday game scheduled.

Games 3, 4 and 5 were:
*The first World Series games ever played on the West Coast;
*The first and only played in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum;
*The only games in World Series history to exceed 90,000 in attendance: Game 5 drew 92,706 fans (a major league record unlikely to be broken under current arrangements, as no current MLB stadium has a capacity of even 60,000 – Dodger Stadium currently has the largest capacity in the MLB with 56,000)

This was the first World Series to draw more than 400,000 fans.

Larry Sherry of the Dodgers was the fifth consecutive pitcher to win the World Series Most Valuable Player Award (in only the fifth year it was awarded), following Johnny Podres (Brooklyn, 1955), Don Larsen (New York, 1956), Lew Burdette (Milwaukee, 1957), and Bob Turley (New York, 1958). Sherry, who had been born with club feet, finished all four games the Dodgers won, winning two and saving two. His brother Norm was the Dodgers&#x27; backup catcher.

Although he was not voted MVP, Dodger second baseman Charlie Neal batted .370 for the Series, and his two-homer performance in Game 2 came after Chicago&#x27;s pitching had held L.A. scoreless for 13 consecutive innings.

Ted Kluszewski played for the losing &quot;Pale Hose&quot; but still managed to drive in a World Series record-tying ten runs, joining Yogi Berra, who drove in ten in the 1956 World Series. &quot;Big Klu&quot; did so in just six games, and his 10 RBIs in the 1959 World Series remain a record for a 6-game World Series, as Berra&#x27;s 10 RBIs in 1956 came in a 7-game World Series. (However, Bobby Richardson would break the record for RBIs in a World Series, regardless of length, the next year with 12 against the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 1960 World Series.) 

The Dodgers became the second National League team to win a World Series after relocating (the 1957 Milwaukee Braves being the first).

The Dodgers became the first team to go from 7th place in one season to World Champion the next.

The 1959 World Series was the last one for Comiskey Park, and the only one for Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The White Sox would move into Rate Field, originally &quot;New Comiskey&quot;, in 1991; the Dodgers moved into Dodger Stadium in 1962. This was the last World Series to host the final World Series games of both its host venues until 2003, as the original Yankee Stadium closed following the 2008 Major League Baseball season and the Florida Marlins moved out of Sun Life Stadium after the 2011 season.

<text>The 1958 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball&#x27;s (MLB) 1958 season. The 55th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff that matched the American League (AL) champion New York Yankees and the National League (NL) champion and defending World Series champion Milwaukee Braves. In a reversal from 1957, the Yankees defeated the Braves in seven games to win their 18th title, and their seventh in 10 years. With that victory, the Yankees became only the second team in Major League Baseball history to come back from a 3–1 deficit to win a best-of-seven World Series; the first was the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1925 (the 1903 Boston Americans came back from a 3–1 deficit in a best-of-nine affair). These teams would meet again in the fall classic 38 years later—by that time, the Braves had moved to Atlanta. As of 2025, this is the most recent World Series featuring the two previous Series winning teams. 

==Background==
This was the first year New Yorkers had only one local team to root for; both the Giants and the Dodgers were now playing their home games more than away (in San Francisco and Los Angeles respectively). Both returnees to the Series had no problems repeating as league champions during the regular season. Milwaukee coasted to an eight-game lead over the Pittsburgh Pirates in the National League and the Yanks bested the Chicago White Sox by ten games in the American. With no pennant race in either league, managers Casey Stengel of the Yankees and Fred Haney of the Braves could rest their aces in preparation for an exciting repeat of the 1957 World Series.

==Summary==
==Matchups==

===Game 1===


Casey Stengel called on 14-game winner Whitey Ford (14–7, 2.01) to start Game 1. Although teammate Bob Turley had a better regular season record at 21–7, the experienced, perennial winning southpaw Ford had five post-season victories under his belt. Fred Haney countered with a lefty of his own, 22-game winner Warren Spahn.

Bill Skowron started the scoring with a home run in the top of the fourth inning, but the Braves came storming back with two of their own in the bottom of the frame. Hank Aaron walked and quickly took second on a Yogi Berra passed ball. When Joe Adcock grounded out to third, Aaron held second but advanced to third on Wes Covington&#x27;s groundout. Then came three straight singles, Del Crandall to left scoring Aaron, Andy Pafko to center, and Warren Spahn to left-center scoring Crandall, to put the Braves up by one.

In the top of the fifth, Spahn retired Tony Kubek on a flyout to left but walked the opposing pitcher, Ford. Leadoff hitter Hank Bauer then deposited a Spahn fastball into the left-field bleachers to give the Yankees a 3–2 lead. Milwaukee would tie the game in the eighth on an Eddie Mathews walk, Aaron double and sac-fly by Wes Covington on a deep fly-out to Mickey Mantle in left-center.

With no runs in the ninth, extra-innings were played, the Yankees going down 1–2–3 with Spahn still on the hill for the Braves. Ryne Duren, who came into the game to pitch the eighth inning, took his turn at-bat in the 10th and grounded out to the pitcher. Aaron started the bottom of the 10th by striking out and was barely thrown out at first base by Yogi Berra on a dropped third strike. Adcock followed with a clean single to center but Covington made the second out on a fly-out to left. Crandall then singled up the middle, sending Adcock to second base. Bill Bruton, who came into the game pinch-hitting for Pafko in the ninth, lined a single into right-center, scoring Adcock with the game-winning run.

===Game 2===


Lew Burdette (20–10, 2.91), who won three games in the 1957 World Series, took the mound for the Braves while the Yankees went with righty Bob Turley (21–7, 2.91), who won 20 games for the only time in his career during the regular season.

Burdette started shakily, giving up a leadoff single to Hank Bauer. Eddie Mathews fielded a grounder by Gil McDougald but threw wide to the first, putting runners on second and third. Mickey Mantle was intentionally walked, loading the bases for cleanup hitter Elston Howard. Howard&#x27;s groundout forced Mantle at second while Bauer came in from third with the game&#x27;s first run. Burdette got the next batter, Yogi Berra, to ground into an inning ending 4–6–3 double-play; Red Schoendienst, to Johnny Logan, to Frank Torre.

A shakier Bob Turley would last only a third of an inning. The Braves lit up the scoreboard with seven first inning runs, sparked by a leadoff Bill Bruton home run; he had hit just three in the season. Schoendienst doubled to right, Hank Aaron walked and dependable Wes Covington singled home a run to right-center. Mid-season pickup Duke Maas relieved Turley to get Frank Torre to fly to right for the second out. Del Crandall walked, loading the bases, with Johnny Logan keeping up the onslaught with a two-run single. With the score already 4–1, pitcher Burdette helped his own cause with a three-run homer that left-fielder Howard thought he had a bead on, only to crash into the fence. Burdette was just the sixth pitcher (to date) with a World Series home run. Norm Siebern was summoned to take over for Howard and Johnny Kucks came in to pitch to try to stop the bleeding. The tenth batter of the inning, Bruton, lined to short but the damage was done as the Braves were staked to a 7–1 lead.

Milwaukee added to its lead in the second inning on another Covington single, this time scoring Eddie Mathews. Things would quiet down a little; Mickey Mantle&#x27;s shot over the center-field fence in the fourth was the only other scoring until the seventh, when the Braves would score twice more and then thrice more in the eighth. The Yankees found some life in the top of the ninth, scoring three runs off a tiring Burdette. Hank Bauer led off with a home run, followed by a Gil McDougald single to left and then Mantle&#x27;s second homer of the game, into the left-center field bleachers made it 13–5. Burdette showed some tenacity by retiring Berra, Bill Skowron, and Bobby Richardson, in order, for the win and a 2–0 series lead.

===Game 3===


Arriving at the Bronx for Games 3 through 5, the Yankees found themselves at home in hopes of their first win in this Series. Milwaukee was shut down on a finely pitched game by Don Larsen with a little help from reliever Ryne Duren.

The Yankees needed this win to stay within striking distance of the seemingly run-away Braves. Hank Bauer drove in all the Yankees&#x27; runs, going 3–for–4 with four runs batted in and scoring once. Bauer singled in Norm Siebern and Gil McDougald in the fifth, to extend his Series hitting streak to 17 games, and then in the seventh hit a two-run homer into the left-field stands. Larsen went seven innings on a six-hitter, striking out eight with three walks. Duren closed the game for his first save, pitching two scoreless innings with three walks and a strikeout. Bob Rush pitched well for the Braves, but his loss helped the Yanks get back into the Series.

===Game 4===


Warren Spahn was at his much-needed best, winning Game 4 3–0 on a two-hit shutout over Yankee ace Whitey Ford. New York left-fielder Norm Siebern (playing for the injured Elston Howard), had trouble fielding with the afternoon sun blazing, losing fly balls in the sixth and eighth innings, accounting for two of Milwaukee&#x27;s three runs.

It was a much-heralded pitching duel until the top of the sixth when Red Schoendienst led off tripling into deep left-center, the ball slicing between Mickey Mantle in center and Siebern in left. Tony Kubek, who had 28 errors during the season, let a Johnny Logan grounder slip through his legs for an error, letting in the game&#x27;s first run. In the seventh, Spahn blooped a single to left to score Del Crandall, who was on third after Andy Pafko doubled to right. In the eighth, Logan was credited with a ground-rule double when Siebern lost a fly-ball in the sun. Eddie Mathews followed with a double off the right-center wall, scoring Logan with the game&#x27;s final run.

===Game 5===


Game 2 starters, loser Bob Turley and winner Lew Burdette, returned with quite different results. Elston Howard also returned to take his spot in left field back from the ineffective Norm Siebern.

The game did not start out very promising for the Yankees as the first six batters were retired without much fanfare. The Braves didn&#x27;t fare much better as a walk and a single by Schoendienst in the third was all they could muster. Second baseman Gil McDougald would open up the scoring in the bottom of the third with a home run into the screen next to the left-field foul pole. Turley kept cruising retiring the side in order in the fourth and fifth until his Yankee teammates opened the floodgates with a six-run sixth. Burdette could only get one out in the inning giving up five earned runs before being relieved by Juan Pizarro.

Hank Bauer would lead off with a single to left. After Jerry Lumpe struck out bunting a third strike foul, Mickey Mantle singled to left-center advancing Bauer to third. Yogi Berra doubled into the right-field corner scoring Bauer, Mantle stopping at third. Howard was intentionally passed loading the bases but Moose Skowron kept the rally going with a short single to right scoring just Mantle. Pizzaro relieved Burdette, who was responsible for all baserunners, and was greeted with a two-run scoring double into the Milwaukee bullpen by Gil McDougald. With runners on second and third, Tony Kubek struck out but had to be thrown out by Del Crandall at first. Turley stayed in the game to hit and delivered a single to left scoring the sixth run, Skowron, and the seventh, McDougald. Hank Bauer was the third strikeout victim in the inning but six runs had crossed the plate. The Braves would put runners on in the seventh, eighth, and ninth innings but fail to score, giving the Yanks a 7–0 victory. Milwaukee still led 3–2 in the Series.

===Game 6===


Milwaukee needed a split of two games at home to repeat as champions, but manager Fred Haney acted like his team had its back to the wall. Rather than start Spahn on three days&#x27; rest per his normal routine, the 37-year-old warhorse returned one day early. That also meant that Burdette would do the same if the series went to a seventh game. In the process, Haney bypassed veteran Bob Rush, who had an impressive 4-2 record and 1.81 earned run average in the final two months of the regular season and was effective again in Game 3, albeit in a loss.

In the top of the first, Spahn recorded two quick outs. Hank Bauer, who would be the Series&#x27; top hitter with a .323 batting average, four home runs and eight RBI, stepped to the plate and slammed his fourth homer into the left-field bleachers for an early 1–0 lead. The Braves answered with a run in the bottom of the inning on a Red Schoendienst single, a sacrifice bunt by Johnny Logan, and a run-scoring single to left by Hank Aaron. Spahn settled in and retired the Yankees without a hit in the second.

Also pitching on two days&#x27; rest, Ford quickly withered in the bottom of the second. After striking out Del Crandall, Wes Covington singled to center on a trap by center fielder Mickey Mantle. Andy Pafko singled to right, advancing Covington to third. Spahn singled to right-center, scoring Covington for a 2–1 lead. An exhausted Ford walked Schoendienst, loading the bases, and Casey Stengel had seen enough, motioning to the bullpen for reliever Art Ditmar. Ditmar faced one batter, Logan, who flied out to Elston Howard, who in turn threw home with a perfect throw to Yogi Berra, doubling up Pafko trying to score on a sac-fly. The RBI single by Spahn would be the last run scored against Ford in the World Series for innings.

Milwaukee held on to the lead until the top of the sixth inning when the Yankees tied the score on a defensive replacement miscue. Bill Bruton had entered the game to play center for Pafko. After Mantle singled just over the reach of shortstop Logan&#x27;s glove, Howard followed with single to center. Bruton fumbled the ball, allowing Mantle to reach third on the error. Berra hit a sacrifice fly to center, Mantle scoring after the catch, to tie the game at two.

Spahn was still on the mound for the Braves going into the 10th, despite throwing 290 innings in the regular season and another 28 in the post-season to that point. Gil McDougald, who was having a fine series himself, led off by hitting a Spahn fastball over the left-field fence. Bauer almost went back-to-back but Bruton made the catch in deep center. Mantle grounded to second for the second out but Howard and Berra followed with singles, setting up runners on first and third. Haney called on Don McMahon to replace Spahn. Moose Skowron struck a single to right, scoring Howard for a two-run lead. Pitcher Ryne Duren stayed in the game to hit but struck out to end the inning.

The Braves made some noise in the bottom of the 10th, but it wasn&#x27;t enough to overcome the Yankee lead. Logan, on first after a walk and with two outs, went to second on defensive indifference (not a stolen base). The ever-dependable Aaron singled to left, scoring Logan, and the Braves were within one run of tying the game. Joe Adcock then singled, sending Aaron to third. Bob Turley came in to relieve Duren and Felix Mantilla pinch-ran for Adcock. With two on and two outs, Frank Torre, pinch-hitting for Del Crandall, lined out to McDougald at the very edge of the outfield grass to end the game and force Game 7.

===Game 7===


For the fourth straight year, the World Series went the distance. Yankee manager Casey Stengel again chose Don Larsen to start Game 7. Larsen had only lasted innings starting Game 7 in the 1957 World Series and once again lasted innings in 1958. Braves right-hander Lew Burdette, who pitched a complete game win in Game 2 but gave up six runs in a Game 5 loss, started for the third time in the series.

The Yankees failed to score in the first while the Braves tallied a single run on some lack of control by Larsen. Red Schoendienst led off with a single to left, Bill Bruton walked and Frank Torre sacrificed up both runners, Jerry Lumpe to Gil McDougald, who was covering first base. Hank Aaron walked loading the bases; things looking pretty good for the Braves thus far. Wes Covington grounded out to first but Schoendienst scored on the play. Eddie Mathews took an intentional pass, but Del Crandall struck out to end the threat.

The Yankees struck back. Cleanup hitter Yogi Berra led off with a walk. Slow-footed but hustling Elston Howard laid down a sacrifice and, incredibly, was called safe on a poorly tossed throw by Torre to pitcher Burdette. Jerry Lumpe grounded again to Torre, who again threw too high to Burdette for another error, loading the bases. The left-handed hitting Torre got the start in place of veteran right-hander Joe Adcock. The next batter, Bill Skowron, forced Lumpe at second, scoring Berra and moving Howard to third. Tony Kubek lifted a sacrifice fly to left, scoring Howard giving the Yankees a 2–1 lead, which held up until the sixth.

Two singles in the bottom of the third brought Stengel out to replace Larsen with a short-rested Bob Turley. The stocky right-hander escaped a bases-loaded situation and pitched superb ball the rest of the way. As in Game 6, the score was tied at two after six innings, when Del Crandall homered into the left-field stands with two outs, giving Braves fans a reason to cheer and promise of another title.

But that hope would fade as the Yankees came to bat in the top of the eighth inning. With tiring Lew Burdette looking for another complete-game victory, they started an improbable two-out rally. After a McDougald fly out and Mickey Mantle looking at a called third strike, Berra doubled off the wall in the right-field corner. Howard followed with a run-scoring bouncer to center field. Andy Carey singled off Eddie Mathews&#x27; glove before Bill Skowron then delivered the back-breaker, a three-run homer to left-center field, to cap a storybook comeback. Other than a lead-off walk to Eddie Mathews and a 2-out pinch-hit single by Joe Adcock in the ninth, Milwaukee went quietly to sleep, and the Yankees had their 18th World Championship.

Hank Bauer (a nine-Series veteran) led with most runs scored (six), most hits (ten), most home runs (four) and most runs batted in (eight). He also paced the victors with a .323 average. Despite less-than-stellar stats in his first four Classics (7-for-57 with a .123 avg.), he combined for 18 hits, six home runs, 14 RBI and a .290 average against the Braves in 1957 and 1958. Turley became the first relief pitcher to be named World Series MVP, recording a save in Game 6, while posting a 2–1 record in both starting and relieving, which consisted of a starting loss in Game 2, a starting win in Game 5, and a relieving win in Game 7. Turley finished the Series with 13 strikeouts, five earned runs off 10 hits, and a 2.76 ERA in total innings pitched.

1958 marked the end of a tight run of World Series contests, with this being the fourth (and last) consecutive series to go the distance of seven games. In over a half century since 1958, there has never been a four-year span of seven-game series in a row.

==Composite line score==
1958 World Series (4–3): New York Yankees (A.L.) over Milwaukee Braves (N.L.)
==Records==
* Eddie Mathews struck out 11 times, a World Series record that Wayne Garrett tied in 1973. The co-records stood until 1980, when Willie Wilson of the Kansas City Royals struck out 12 times.
* The Braves struck out 56 times, a new World Series record. In addition to Mathews&#x27; 11 strikeouts, Del Crandall also struck out 10 times, making it the first time two different players from the same team struck out 10 or more times in a single World Series. 
* This was Casey Stengel&#x27;s seventh world championship, which tied him with Joe McCarthy for the most World Series won. It would also be Stengel&#x27;s last.
* The 3–1 deficit overcome by the New York Yankees was the first in a best-of-seven by an American League team. The only previous instance was by the National League&#x27;s Pittsburgh Pirates in 1925.

<text>The 1920 World Series was the championship series for Major League Baseball&#x27;s 1920 season. The series was a best-of-nine format played between the American League (AL) champion Cleveland Indians and the National League (NL) champion Brooklyn Robins, with the Indians defeating the Robins five games to two. The only World Series triple play, the first World Series grand slam, and the first World Series home run by a pitcher all occurred in Game 5 of this series. This was also the first World Series and first Big Four championship series to feature two brothers on opposing teams, with Doc Johnston playing for Cleveland and Jimmy Johnston playing for Brooklyn.

The Indians won the series in memory of their former shortstop Ray Chapman, who had been killed earlier in the season when struck in the head by a pitched ball. 

In Game 5, Cleveland second basemen Bill Wambsganss turned an unassisted triple play. He caught a line drive off the bat of Clarence Mitchell, stepped on second base to put out Pete Kilduff, and tagged Otto Miller coming from first base. It was the second of 15 (as of 2022) unassisted triple plays in major-league baseball history, and it remains the only one in postseason play. Mitchell made history again in the eighth inning by hitting into a double play, accounting for five outs in two straight at-bats.

The fifth game also saw the first grand slam in World Series history (hit by Cleveland&#x27;s Elmer Smith) and the first Series home run by a pitcher (Cleveland&#x27;s Jim Bagby, Sr.). And in that same game, Brooklyn outhit Cleveland but lost 8–1.

Cleveland had won the American League pennant in a close race with the Chicago White Sox and the New York Yankees. The Sox&#x27;s participation in the Black Sox Scandal the previous year had caught up to them late in the season, and their star players were suspended with three games left in the season, when they were in a virtual tie with the Indians. The Yankees, with their recently acquired star Babe Ruth, were almost ready to start their eventual World Series dynasty. 

This was the second of three consecutive World Series to use a best-of-nine format, instead of the usual best-of-seven. To reduce travel during the Series, the 2-3-2-2 format that was used in 1919 was changed to 3-4-2. Notably, all seven games of the 1920 World Series were won by the team who scored first. In fact, Game 4 was the only game in which the losing team scored a run before the winning team had scored &quot;all&quot; of its runs. The lead never changed hands in any game.

This would be the last World Series until to feature two franchises that had not previously won a championship.

==Summary==
==Matchups==
===Game 1===

Game 1 took a mere 1 hour, 41 minutes. Steve O&#x27;Neill supplied RBI doubles in the second and fourth innings in support of Stan Coveleski, who won it for the visiting Indians with a five-hitter.

===Game 2===

A first-inning run on a Jimmy Johnston single and Zack Wheat double would be all Dodger pitcher Burleigh Grimes would require in a complete-game shutout.

===Game 3===

Brooklyn scored twice in the first on hits by Zack Wheat and Hi Myers that chased Cleveland starter Ray Caldwell from the game. The only run winning pitcher Sherry Smith gave up in a three-hitter came when Tris Speaker came all the way around on a double that was misplayed in left field.

===Game 4===
Brooklyn starter Leon Cadore didn&#x27;t make it past the first inning. His relievers didn&#x27;t fare much better, Al Mamaux being removed in the third and Rube Marquard greeted by a George Burns two-run double. Stan Coveleski cruised with a five-hitter for his second win of the Series.

===Game 5===
The &quot;Cleveland Times&quot; ran the following article on Monday, October 11, 1920, recounting Game 5 and Wambsganss&#x27; triple play:

Wamby Makes Unassisted Triple Play
*CLEVELAND, Sunday Oct 10, 1920 – Bill Wambsganss&#x27; unassisted triple play highlighted the most unusual game in World Series history today and helped the Cleveland Indians to a wild 8–1 victory over the Brooklyn Robins. Elmer Smith hit a grand slam and Jim Bagby also homered as the Indians took the lead in games three to two. The triple play and grand slam had never happened before in World Series history and Bagby became the first pitcher to homer in a World Series. &quot;I&#x27;ve been in baseball 40 years&quot;, Robins manager Wilbert Robinson said, &quot;and I never saw one like this.&quot; The first Indian to face Burleigh Grimes was Charlie Johnson, who singled. He stopped at second on Wambsganss&#x27; single. Then Grimes fell fielding Tris Speaker&#x27;s bunt, loading the bases. Then Smith hit a 1–2 pitch over the right field screen for a 4–0 lead. In the home fourth, Doc Johnston singled to center and moved up on a passed ball. After Grimes put Steve O&#x27;Neill on, Bagby homered into the center field stands. Pete Kilduff began the top of the fifth with a single to left center. When Otto Miller singled to center, Speaker&#x27;s quick throw to third drove Kilduff back to second. That brought up reliever Clarence Mitchell, who went six for sixteen as a pinch-hitter this season and sometimes fills in at first base and in the outfield. A left-handed hitter, he drove the ball toward right center. Second baseman Wambsganss moved slightly to his right, tipped onto his toes, sprung a little bit and grabbed the ball with his gloved hand. Never hesitating, he continued to second base, easily doubling Kilduff. Then when Wamby turned to throw to first base he saw Miller frozen directly in front of him. Reaching out, Wamby tagged Miller easily. The crowd was silent momentarily, then, realizing what had happened, broke into thunderous applause. In the Brooklyn eighth, Ernie Krueger singled to center. But Mitchell grounded to first baseman Johnson, who started a double play. Thus, Mitchell accounted for five outs in two at-bats.

===Game 6===
Even faster than Game 1, this one was done in just 94 minutes. Duster Mails twirled a three-hit shutout, and the lone run came in the sixth on a Tris Speaker two-out single, followed by a George Burns double.

===Game 7===
The Robins didn&#x27;t score in the last two games. Their pitcher, Burleigh Grimes, committed an error on a Cleveland double steal that resulted in the game&#x27;s first run. Stan Coveleski needed no more, but got one in the fifth from a Tris Speaker run-scoring triple and another in the seventh on Charlie Jamieson&#x27;s RBI double. Spitball pitcher Coveleski won for the third time and the Indians celebrated before their home fans.

<text>Moore is an impact crater that is located on the far side of the Moon. Like much of the far side, Moore is located in a region that has been saturated by impacts. Nearby craters of note are Larmor to the south-southwest, and Parsons about the same distance to the west.

This crater has been worn and damaged by subsequent impacts, particularly along the western rim where it is overlain by a double-crater. The interior floor is irregular and marked by a merged chain of impacts that runs from the northwest rim to the midpoint. The satellite crater Moore L is attached to the south-southeast outer rim. To the east, the satellite crater Moore F has a relatively high-albedo rim, and lies at the center of a small ray system.

The crater&#x27;s name was adopted by the IAU in 1970.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Moore.

<doc id="1332309" wikidata="Q4561067" url="?curid=1332309" title="1921 World Series">
<text>The 1921 [[World Series]] was the championship series in Major League Baseball for the 1921 season. The 18th edition of the World Series, it matched the National League champion New York Giants and the American League champion New York Yankees.

The Series matched two distinct teams in strategy with the Giants, dedicated practitioners of the dead-ball era&#x27;s &quot;inside game&quot; and the Yankees, who relied on the &quot;power game&quot; exemplified by Babe Ruth, who was coming off of what was arguably his best year ever statistically. This was the first World Series appearance by the Yankees, who have gone on to play in the Series a record 40 times. The 1921 Series was a closely contested matchup that ended on a double play featuring a baserunning miscue. It was also the last of four World Series to use the best-of-nine format, which had been used in the 1903, 1919, and the 1920 editions. The following year, the World Series permanently switched to a best-of-seven game format where it has remained ever since. It was also the first World Series to be broadcast over radio.

== Background ==
The Series was the last of the experimental best-five-of-nine series, which the Giants won five games to three. All eight games were played at the Polo Grounds in upper Manhattan, New York, each team alternating as the nominal &quot;home team&quot; since the Yankees had subleased the stadium from the Giants for the 1913 through 1922 seasons, so that it was the home park for both teams during the regular season in those ten years. This marked the first time in World Series history that the series occurred at a single site. It happened again the following year in the same place with the same two teams, in 1944 at St. Louis&#x27; Sportsman&#x27;s Park between the Cardinals and the Browns, and then again in 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic necessitated the first-ever neutral-site Series played at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas between the Los Angeles Dodgers and Tampa Bay Rays. For New Yorkers, this was the first subway Series in World Series history. It was also the first World Series to be broadcast on radio, with Grantland Rice covering the games live through Pittsburgh&#x27;s KDKA. It was rebroadcast on WBZ in Massachusetts. Announcer Tommy Cowan also recreated the games over Westinghouse-owned WJZ in Newark as he listened to phoned-in reports from the stadium.

Because of an infected arm and a bad knee (which he wrenched in Game 5), Babe Ruth did not start the final three games, appearing only as a pinch-hitter in the final inning of Game 8. Following the Series, Ruth and Bob Meusel did some postseason barnstorming, against the rules for Series participants at that time. Both were suspended for a number of games at the start of the 1922 season. Ruth filed a personal appeal with Commissioner Landis, who upheld their suspensions but agreed to rescind the rule effective the end of that season.

Then New York Governor Nathan L. Miller, described as &quot;a big baseball fan&quot; by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, made plans to attend games as a guest of the Commissioner of Baseball. The Series drew fans to New York City from across the continent, from as far west as California and Mexico to as far south as Cuba. Hotels were booked up, and both the New York Central and Pennsylvania Railroads made plans to add cars and run their trains in sections if necessary to handle the extra traffic expected. Harry L. Davis, then the Governor of Ohio, was expected to attend the games as were several other VIPs of the time.

This was the fourth World Series for Giants&#x27; assistant coach &quot;Eee-yah!&quot; Hughie Jennings, who had managed young Ty Cobb and the pennant-winning but Series-losing 1907, 1908 &amp; 1909 Detroit Tigers and had been brought in as an assistant coach for the Giants by John McGraw the previous October after Jennings had resigned from the Tigers. The two were teammates on the old Baltimore Orioles in earlier seasons.

Several players on both teams didn&#x27;t start the 1921 season with either the Giants or the Yankees, and several others moved to other teams during the regular season earlier that year. For the Giants, Johnny Rawlings, Irish Meusel, Casey Stengel and Red Causey started the season as Philadelphia Phillies, who finished last in the National League that year. Outfielder Bill Cunningham had played for the Seattle Rainiers of the Pacific Coast League, nor did Cozy Dolan or Red Shea start the season with the Giants, while the Yankees acquired outfielder Elmer Miller and pitcher Tom Rogers during the season. Nonparticipants from either team in the Series included Curt Walker, Lee King, Johnny Monroe, Rube Benton, Goldie Rapp, Ping Bodie, Tom Sheehan and Tom Connelly.

This was the first of three consecutive matchups between the Yankees and Giants (1921–1923) and marked the only time (as of 2023) that three straight World Series featured the same two clubs. Brothers Bob and Irish Meusel played against each other in each of those three series, making them the first set of brothers to play against each other on opposing teams in a World Series or any Big Four championship series.

==Summary==
==Matchups==
===Game 1===

Mays pitched a complete game 5-hit shutout, Frankie Frisch getting 4 of those hits off of Mays in a losing cause for the Giants. This was the first World Series game victory for the Yankees.

===Game 2===

Pitching Ruth carefully, the Giants walked the Babe three times; but after the third walk he stole second and then third base, much to the delight of Yankee fans. But when he slid into third, he scraped his elbow severely and the site became infected. Hoyt held the Giants to two hits, the Yankees jumping to a 2–0 lead in the series.

===Game 3===

After getting outscored 6–0 in the first two games of this series and falling behind 4–0 in the top of the third, the Giants tied it with four runs of their own in the bottom half. Later on, an 8-run 7th inning highlighted by Ross Youngs&#x27; bases loaded triple turned the tide as the Giants got their first win of this series. Ruth was taken out in the eighth after again scraping his elbow sliding into a base. The Yankees announced after the game that the elbow would have to be lanced and that he would not return for the rest of the Series.

===Game 4===

Ruth suited up, but stayed on the bench during batting practice. When the game began, however, to everyone&#x27;s surprise, he popped out of the dugout and jogged to his outfield position. The crowd roared. He kept touching his bandaged arm throughout the game. Despite the injury, he got two hits including a ninth-inning homer, his first World Series home run as well as the first World Series home run in Yankees franchise history. But the Giants won the game and tied the series at 2–2.

===Game 5===

Ruth&#x27;s arm was still bandaged, but he played again. In the fourth, with the score tied 1–1, he shocked everyone by bunting and beating it out. His teammate Meusel then doubled, scoring Ruth all the way from first base for the go-ahead run in a 3–1 Yankee win.

===Game 6===

The Giants battled back from 3–0 and 5–3 deficits to take Game 6.

===Game 7===
Phil Douglas scattered eight hits and held the Yankees to one run, the Giants winning 2–1 on Frank Snyder&#x27;s RBI double in the seventh inning.

===Game 8===

Facing elimination, Yankee manager Miller Huggins sent Ruth out to pinch-hit in the bottom of the ninth. The Babe, nursing both elbow and knee injuries, had sat out this game and missed all of Games 6 and 7. The bases were empty and the Yankees still trailed by the lone run of the game scored by the Giants in the top of the first. A HR would tie the game, and a hit or a walk would give the Yankees a chance. But Ruth grounded out, and shortly afterwards Frank Baker hit into a double play after a walk by Aaron Ward who was thrown out at third base for the final out of the Series, giving the Giants their first world championship since Christy Mathewson&#x27;s record three complete shutouts in 1905.

<text>The 1922 [[World Series]] was the championship series in Major League Baseball for the 1922 season. The 19th edition of the World Series, it matched the National League champion New York Giants against the American League champion New York Yankees. The Giants beat the Yankees in five games (four games to zero, with one tie) in the first Series with a permanent best-of-seven format. By now, the term &quot;World Series&quot; was being used frequently, as opposed to &quot;World&#x27;s Series&quot;. As with the 1921 World Series, every game was played at the Polo Grounds because it housed both teams, with the home team alternating; it was also the Yankees&#x27; final series to be played at the Polo Grounds as a home team, as they would move into the then-under construction Yankee Stadium for the following season, which ended in them winning the rematch against the Giants.

The Giants held Babe Ruth in check (he batted only .118 with just one RBI) and scored just enough runs to win each of the games outside the controversial Game 2 tie. That game was called on account of darkness, but many thought there was sufficient light to have played some more innings (the sun was still in the sky), and there were some suspicions that one or both teams might have &quot;allowed&quot; the tie to happen to increase the overall gate receipts. Commissioner Landis was among those who was dissatisfied with the result. One story is that Landis asked Umpire Hildebrand, &quot;Why the Sam Hill did you call the game?&quot; The umpire answered, &quot;There was a temporary haze on the field.&quot; The game decision was in the hands of the umpires, but the Commissioner&#x27;s Office controlled the gate receipts. Landis ordered the money, more than $120,000, turned over to World War I charities, thus nullifying any impropriety. The tied game would turn out to be the third (and final) tied game in the history of the World Series. The other two tied games occurred in and . No ties are possible under later rules, which allow for suspension of a tied game and resumption of it at a later date, as with Game 5 of the 2008 World Series.

As of 2024, this is the last time the Giants have won the World Series at home, as their next five championships were all clinched on the road. This would prove to be Giants&#x27; manager John McGraw&#x27;s third and final World Series win.

==Summary==
==Matchups==
===Game 1===

The game and Series remained scoreless until the sixth inning. Whitey Witt tripled off of Art Nehf, then was cut down at home trying to score on a fielder&#x27;s choice, but a Babe Ruth hit got the run home. The Yankees added another run next inning on Aaron Ward&#x27;s sacrifice fly with runners on second and third. A three-run Giant rally in the eighth knocked out Yankee starter Bullet Joe Bush, who allowed four straight leadoff singles, the last of which to Irish Meusel scoring two. and the winning run coming off reliever Waite Hoyt on a Ross Youngs sacrifice fly.

===Game 2===
This was the controversial tie (see above). Pitchers Bob Shawkey and Jesse Barnes went all 10 innings. The Giants scored all three runs in the first on Irish Meusel&#x27;s three-run home run after two singles. The Yankees scored a run in the first on Wally Pipp&#x27;s RBI single after Joe Dugan reached second on an error and another run in the fourth on Aaron Ward&#x27;s home run. The Yankees had tied the game in the eighth on doubles by Babe Ruth and Bob Meusel, but that is the way the game ended.

===Game 3===
Knuckleballer Jack Scott kept the Yankees off the board. In the bottom of the third with runners on second and third, Frankie Frisch&#x27;s sacrifice fly and Irish Meusel&#x27;s RBI single scored a run each for the Giants, who added an insurance run in the seventh on Frankie Frisch&#x27;s RBI single. The game took just 1 hour, 48 minutes.

===Game 4===

This contest moved along even faster than Game 3. It was over in a snappy 1:41, with Giants pitcher Hugh McQuillan going the distance for a 4-3 win. The Yankees scored two runs in the first on back-to-back singles by Wally Pipp and Bob Meusel, but in the fifth after a leadoff single and double, Dave Bancroft&#x27;s two-run single tied the game. After a single and groundout, Irish Meusel&#x27;s groundout and Ross Youngs&#x27;s RBI single scored a run each. Aaron Ward&#x27;s home run in the seventh cut the Giants&#x27; lead to one, but the Yankees did not score after that.

===Game 5===

Art Nehf&#x27;s five-hit pitching combined with a three-run eighth inning won the Series for the Giants. The Yankees scored a run in the first when Joe Dugan singled with one out, moved to second on a sacrifice bunt and scored on Wally Pipp&#x27;s RBI single, but in the bottom of the second with runners on second and third, Bill Cunningham&#x27;s two-run single gave the Giants the lead. The Yankees tied the game in the fifth on Bullet Joe Bush&#x27;s RBI single after a walk and single, then took the lead on Everett Scott&#x27;s sacrifice fly with runners on second and third. The decisive rally began with a Heinie Groh single and Frankie Frisch double. After an intentional walk to Ross Youngs, a two-run single by High Pockets Kelly put the Giants on top. The next batter, Lee King, inserted in the outfield that inning for defensive purposes, delivered an RBI single to make it 5-3, and that&#x27;s how it ended.

This was the second of three consecutive matchups between the Yankees and Giants (1921–1923) marked the only time (as of 2023), that three straight World Series featured the same two clubs. Brothers Bob and Irish Meusel played against each other in each of those three series, making them the first set of brothers to play against each other on opposing teams in a World Series or any Big Four championship series.

The Giants became the second NL team to win back-to-back World Series, following the Chicago Cubs in 1907–08, and remained the last until the 1975–76 Cincinnati Reds. This also remains the last World Series to be won by the Giants at home, as their championships of 1933 and 1954 (for New York) and 2010, 2012 and 2014 (for San Francisco) were all clinched as the visiting team.

<text>The 1923 [[World Series]] was the championship series in Major League Baseball for the 1923 season. The 20th edition of the World Series, it matched the American League champion New York Yankees against the National League champion New York Giants. The Yankees beat the Giants in six games. This would be the first of the Yankees&#x27; 27 World Series championships (as of 2025). The series was not played in a 2–3–2 format: as with the previous two Series (where both clubs had shared the Polo Grounds) the home field alternated each game, though this time it involved switching ballparks, as the first Yankee Stadium had opened this season.

== Background ==
The Yankees opened their new stadium in April on a home run by Babe Ruth, setting the tone for the season and this Series, in which Ruth hit three home runs along with drawing eight walks. In Game 2, second baseman, Aaron Ward hit a home run. The Giants&#x27; one bright spot was &quot;Old Casey&quot; Stengel, who hit game-winning homers in each of the two Giants&#x27; victories. In typically eccentric Stengel fashion, one of them was inside-the-park at the cavernous Yankee Stadium, and his shoe came loose during his run around the bases. Stengel was traded after the season, leading him to quip later in life, &quot;It&#x27;s a good thing I didn&#x27;t hit &quot;three&quot; homers in &quot;three&quot; games, or McGraw would have traded me to the Three-I League!&quot;. A quarter century later, Stengel would take on the role of Yankees manager, and would guide the Bronx Bombers through one of their most successful eras.

In Game 6, the Yankees overcame a 4–1 deficit by staging a five-run rally in the eighth inning to clinch the series.

The three consecutive matchups between the Yankees and Giants (1921–1923) marked the only time (as of 2024), that three straight World Series featured the same two clubs. Brothers Bob and Irish Meusel played against each other in each of those three series, making them the first set of brothers to play against each other on opposing teams in a World Series or any Big Four championship series.

Thanks to the large seating capacity of the new Yankee Stadium, coupled with expansion of the Polo Grounds the same year, the 1923 Series was the first to eclipse 300,000 in total attendance (301,430), averaging over 50,000 per game (50,238), with gate receipts over $1 million ($1,063,815.00).

This was the third time that a team had inaugurated a new stadium with a World Series win, and would be the last until the St. Louis Cardinals victory in their new ballpark in , and the New York Yankees again won the World Series in in their new Yankee Stadium.

Babe Ruth had a great series, his first great one as a Yankee, batting .368 and hitting three home runs in the series.

Neither Lou Gehrig, Bill Terry nor Hack Wilson played in the Series. These future Hall of Famers were each in their first season and had played no more than thirteen games in the regular season. Gehrig had been called up from Hartford to play for the Yankees that year. In that time, however, a team had to have the permission of both the commissioner and the opposing team&#x27;s manager to make a roster change so late in the season eligible for postseason play. The Yankees gained the permission of Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis who then told them to get John McGraw&#x27;s permission. McGraw and the Yankees had a long history of disdain after both teams had shared a stadium and the Giants had won both the 1921 and 1922 World Series from New York. Therefore, he declined permission and Gehrig would not be allowed to participate in the series which otherwise would have been his first World Series. As noted baseball historian John Thorn said, &quot;As if the Yankees needed any more reason to hate John McGraw.&quot;

==Summary==
==Matchups==

===Game 1===

A ninth-inning inside-the-park homer by Casey Stengel beat the Yankees on their home field. Babe Ruth scored in the first inning on a Bob Meusel double. Yankee center fielder Whitey Witt&#x27;s two-run single in the next inning made it 3-0. The Giants fought back with a four-run third, knocking out Yankee starter Waite Hoyt from the game. It was tied at 4-4 in the ninth inning until Casey came to bat, legging out a long drive to the left-center gap.

===Game 2===
After trading home runs by Aaron Ward and Irish Meusel, a pair of Babe Ruth blasts in the fourth and fifth innings turned out to be the difference.

===Game 3===

A scoreless pitching duel lasted until the seventh inning, when Casey Stengel struck again, this time with a homer that left the park. It gave Art Nehf the win over Sad Sam Jones, despite the Giants getting just four hits.

===Game 4===
A six-run second inning chased Giant starter Jack Scott, the first four Yankee batters of that inning reaching safely. Bob Meusel added a two-run triple. A ninth-inning leadoff inside-the-park homer by Ross Youngs gave the home team a flicker of hope, but Herb Pennock mopped up in relief.

===Game 5===

It was over in a hurry. Bob Meusel&#x27;s two-run triple and a Wally Pipp sacrifice fly made it 3-0. Then the Yankees got four more in the second, Joe Dugan&#x27;s three-run inside-the-park homer the big blow. Bullet Joe Bush surrendered just three hits to the Giants, who now faced elimination.

===Game 6===

Right off the bat, the Yankees struck with a Babe Ruth two-out homer in the first. But then the Giants and their Polo Grounds crowd came to life. Three singles in the first tied the score. Center fielder Bill Cunningham knocked in a go-ahead run in the fourth, followed by catcher Frank Snyder&#x27;s homer in the fifth inning. Down 4-1, the Yankees took advantage of two singles followed by 3 consecutive walks. Ruth struck out with the score 4-3, and Bob Meusel hit a clutch two-out single scoring two runs, and a third scoring on an error, making it 6-4 Yankees. Sad Sam Jones would get the 6 out save to win the Yankees their first championship.

<text>The 1924 World Series was the championship series of the 1924 Major League Baseball season. A best-of-seven playoff, the series was played between the American League (AL) pennant winner Washington Senators and the National League (NL) pennant winner New York Giants. The Senators defeated the Giants in seven games to win their first championship in club history. The Giants became the first team to play in four consecutive World Series, winning in 1921–1922 and losing in 1923–1924. Their long-time manager, John McGraw, made his ninth and final World Series appearance in 1924. The contest concluded with the second World Series-deciding game which ran to extra innings (the first had occurred in 1912). In 1961, the Senators relocated to Minnesota and were rebranded as the Twins, subsequently winning the World Series in 1987 and in 1991.

Walter Johnson, after pitching his first 20-victory season (23) since 1919, was making his first World Series appearance, at the age of 36, while nearing the end of his career with the Senators. He lost his two starts, but the Senators battled back to force a Game 7, giving Johnson a chance to redeem himself when he came on in relief in that game. Johnson held on to get the win and give Washington its first championship. The seventh game is widely considered to be one of the most dramatic games in Series history.

Johnson struck out 12 Giants batters in Game 1 in a losing cause. Although that total matched Ed Walsh&#x27;s number in the 1906 World Series, it came in 12 innings. Johnson struck out only nine in the first nine innings.

In Game 7, with the Senators behind 3–1 in the eighth, Bucky Harris hit a routine ground ball to third which hit a pebble and took a bad hop over Giants third baseman Freddie Lindstrom. Two runners scored on the play, tying the score at three. Walter Johnson then came in to pitch the ninth, and held the Giants scoreless into extra innings. With the score still 3–3, Washington came up in the 12th. With one out, and runners on first and second, Earl McNeely hit another grounder at Lindstrom, and again the ball took a bad hop, scoring Muddy Ruel with the Series-winning run.

This was the first World Series to use the 2–3–2 home game pattern, which would be adapted as the permanent format beginning the following year.

This was the Senators&#x27; only World Series championship victory during the franchise&#x27;s time in Washington. As the Minnesota Twins, the team won the World Series in 1987 and . This would be the last World Series win for a Washington based team until the Washington Nationals, who were originally the Montreal Expos, won the World Series in , 95 years after the Senators&#x27; only triumph.

In 2020, ESPN named it the third greatest World Series of all-time.

==Summary==

==Matchups==
===Game 1===
The Senators tied it at 2–2 with a run in the bottom of the ninth. The Giants scored two in the top of the 12th off the Big Train; Washington fought back for a run in the bottom of the inning, but left the tying run on third.

===Game 2===

Washington fought back early in the game, scoring 3 runs in 5 innings. But the Giants would quickly fight back in the final three frames to tie the game as it went to the bottom of the ninth. With Joe Judge representing the potential winning run and 1 out, Roger Peckinpaugh hit a double to win the game and tie the series.

===Game 3===

Washington threatened in the ninth. Ossie Bluege, the only man reliever Claude Jonnard faced, drew a bases-loaded walk to make it 6-4. Mule Watson then came in to nail down the last two outs. Rosy Ryan&#x27;s fourth-inning home run is to date the only World Series home run by a relief pitcher.

===Game 4===
Goose Goslin had a big game for the Senators, with three singles and a home run to go 4-for-4 and drive in four runs.

===Game 5===
Johnson again pitched a complete game but the Giants recorded 13 hits off him, taking a 3–2 lead in the Series. Bentley broke a 1–1 tie in the fifth with a two-run home run, the second homer by a New York pitcher in the Series after Rosy Ryan&#x27;s in Game 3.

===Game 6===
Both Washington runs scored on a single in the fifth inning by manager Bucky Harris. Tom Zachary won his second game of the series, deadlocking the series at three games each.

===Game 7===

The unheralded Curly Ogden was given the Game 7 start for Washington – it was his only World Series appearance. He struck out a batter and walked one, and then was pulled for George Mogridge. It was later revealed that manager Bucky Harris started righthander Ogden so that the Giants would be locked into their &quot;righthanded&quot; lineup, before he switched to the lefthander Mogridge.

With the Senators trailing 3–1 in the eighth inning with bases loaded and two outs, Bucky Harris hit a &quot;bad hop&quot; ground ball to third, that reportedly struck a pebble, which Freddie Lindstrom failed to catch (no error was charged). As a result, two runs scored for a 3–3 tie. In the ninth inning, Walter Johnson would step up as pitcher and pitch four scoreless innings.

In the bottom of the 12th inning, Giants catcher Hank Gowdy stepped on his own discarded mask while trying to catch a Muddy Ruel foul pop-up, and dropped the ball for an error. Given a second chance in the at-bat, Ruel doubled. Johnson reached first on another error, and with Ruel on second and Johnson on first, Earl McNeely hit a &quot;bad hop&quot; ground ball to Lindstrom that was almost identical to Harris&#x27; eighth inning hit. Lindstrom again failed to catch the ball (reportedly hitting the same pebble that was struck four innings earlier) as it bounced over him into left field, and Ruel scored the series-winning run.

The game holds the record as the longest Game 7 (by innings) in MLB postseason history. It was also the first World Series Game 7 to be decided in extra innings (although the series ended with a ten-inning Game 8), and the last until .
In 2014, on the Series&#x27; 90th anniversary, the Library of Congress acquired a newsreel of highlight footage from Game 7, including McNeely&#x27;s Series-winning base hit. CNN subsequently released this footage on its website.

The next time a Washington team won the World Series would come 95 years later in , when the Washington Nationals did so against the Houston Astros.

<text>The 1925 World Series was the championship series of the 1925 Major League Baseball season. A best-of-seven playoff, it was played between the National League Champion Pittsburgh Pirates and the American League Champion Washington Senators. The Pirates defeated the Senators in seven games to win the series.

In a reversal of fortune on all counts from the previous 1924 World Series, when Washington&#x27;s Walter Johnson had come back from two losses to win the seventh and deciding game, Johnson dominated in Games 1 and 4, but lost Game 7.

The Senators built up a 3–1 Series lead. After Pittsburgh won the next two games, Johnson again took the mound for Game 7, and carried a 6–4 lead into the bottom of the seventh inning. But errors by shortstop Roger Peckinpaugh in both the seventh and eighth innings led to four unearned runs, and the Pirates become the first team in a best-of-seven Series to overcome a 3–1 Series deficit to win the championship. Peckinpaugh, the Senators&#x27; regular shortstop and the 1925 American League Most Valuable Player, had a tough Series in the field, committing a record eight errors.

Playing conditions were of no help. The 1925 Series was postponed twice due to poor weather, and Game 7 was played in what soon became a steady downpour, described as &quot;probably the worst conditions ever for a World Series game.&quot; Senators outfielder Goose Goslin reported that the fog prevented him from clearly seeing the infield during the last three innings of the game, and claimed that the Series-winning hit was actually a foul ball. In the next day&#x27;s &quot;The New York Times&quot;, James Harrison wrote &quot;In a grave of mud was buried Walter Johnson&#x27;s ambition to join the select panel of pitchers who have won three victories in one World Series. With mud shackling his ankles and water running down his neck, the grand old man of baseball succumbed to weariness, a sore leg, wretched support and the most miserable weather conditions that ever confronted a pitcher.&quot;

Twice in Game 7 the visiting Senators held leads of at least three runs over the Pirates but failed to hold them. In fact, after the top of the first inning, Washington led 4–0. Nevertheless, Pittsburgh eventually won the game, scoring three runs in the bottom of the eighth inning to turn a 6–7 deficit into a 9–7 lead. To date, the four-run deficit is the largest ever overcome in the seventh game of the World Series. It was the largest comeback in a World Series clinching game until 2024.

A memorable play occurred during the eighth inning of Game 3. The Senators&#x27; Sam Rice ran after an Earl Smith line drive hit into right center field. Rice made a diving &quot;catch&quot; into the temporary stands, but did not emerge with the ball for approximately 15 seconds. The Pirates contested the play, saying a fan probably stuffed the ball into Rice&#x27;s glove. The call stood and Rice parried questions about the incident for the rest of his life—never explicitly saying whether he had or had not really made the catch. His typical answer (including to Commissioner Landis, who said it was a good answer) was always &quot;The umpire said I caught it.&quot; Rice left a sealed letter at the Hall of Fame to be opened after his death. In it, he had written: &quot;At no time did I lose possession of the ball.&quot;

Writer Lamont Buchanan wrote, &quot;In 1925, the Senators hopped the Big Train once too often... earning Bucky [Harris] the criticism of many fans and American League head [Ban] Johnson who dispatched an irate wire to the Senators manager.&quot; In his telegram, Ban Johnson accused the manager of failing to relieve Walter Johnson &quot;for sentimental reasons.&quot; Despite the second-guessing, Harris always said, &#x27;If I had it to do over again, I&#x27;d still pitch Johnson.&#x27;&quot; 

This was Walter Johnson&#x27;s second and final World Series appearance. By the time the original Washington Senators next reached the Fall Classic in 1933 – their last before they became the Minnesota Twins, and the city&#x27;s last until the Nationals – Johnson had retired.

==Summary==
==Matchups==
===Game 1===
This game remains to date the last road World Series game the Washington Senators/Minnesota Twins franchise has won. They have lost their last 14 since. Walter Johnson pitched a complete game and allowed only five hits and struck out ten. The Senators got on the board in the second on Joe Harris&#x27;s home run off Lee Meadows. In the fifth, they loaded the bases on three singles with no outs, but after Meadows struck out the next two batters, a two-run single by Sam Rice made it 3–0 Senators. Pie Traynor&#x27;s leadoff home run in the bottom half gave the Pirates their only run in the game. The Senators added another run in the ninth off Johnny Morrison when Goose Goslin hit a leadoff single, moved to second on a sacrifice bunt and scored on Ossie Bluege&#x27;s single.

===Game 2===
In Game 2, Joe Judge&#x27;s second inning home run off Vic Aldridge gave the Senators a 1–0 lead, but the Pirates tied the game in the fourth on Glenn Wright&#x27;s home run in the fourth off Stan Coveleski. In the eighth, Kiki Cuyler&#x27;s two-run home run in the eighth following a Roger Peckinpaugh error that let Eddie Moore reached first put the Pirates up 3–1. In the ninth, the Senators loaded the bases with no outs on two walks and a single, but scored only once on Bobby Veach&#x27;s sacrifice fly as Aldridge retired the next two batters and the Pirates tied the series heading to Washington.

===Game 3===
In Game 3, the Pirates struck first in the second when Pie Traynor hit a leadoff triple off Alex Ferguson and scored on Glenn Wright&#x27;s sacrifice fly, but the Senators tied the game in the third off Ray Kremer when Sam Rice hit a leadoff single and scored on Joe Judge&#x27;s double. The Pirates regained the lead in the fourth when Kiki Cuyler hit a leadoff single and scored on Clyde Barnhart&#x27;s double. They added to their lead in the sixth on Kremer&#x27;s RBI single with two on, but Goose Goslin&#x27;s home run in the bottom half cut their lead back to one. Next inning, the Senators loaded the bases on a walk and two singles with one out before Judge&#x27;s sacrifice fly tied the game, then an RBI single by Joe Harris put them up 4–3. A key play occurred in the eighth inning when Earl Smith&#x27;s line drive into right-center field was caught by Sam Rice who fell into the temporary stands (see overview above). Firpo Marberry pitched two shutout innings to close the game.

===Game 4===
This was Johnson&#x27;s only post-season shutout. A three-run home run by Goose Goslin followed by a solo home run by Joe Harris off Emil Yde, who pitched just innings, in the third inning put the Senators up 3–1 in the series. Yde became the first pitcher in the history of the World Series to surrender back-to-back home runs.

===Game 5===

The Pirates loaded the bases in the first, but failed to score. In the bottom half, Sam Rice hit a leadoff single and scored on Goose Goslin&#x27;s double. In the third, after two walks, Clyde Barnhart&#x27;s RBI single tied the game, then Pie Traynor&#x27;s sacrifice fly put the Pirates up 2–1. Joe Harris&#x27;s home run in the fourth tied the game. After a walk and single, back-to-back RBI singles by Kiki Cuyler and Clyde Barnhart in the seventh put the Pirates up 4–2 and knock Stan Coveleski out of the game. The Senators cut the lead to 4–3 in the bottom half when Nemo Leibold hit a leadoff double and scored on Sam Rice&#x27;s single, but the Pirates got the run back in the eighth when Glenn Wright hit a leadoff double off Tom Zachary and scored on Stuffy McInnis&#x27;s single. They added another run in the ninth on Wright&#x27;s RBI single off Firpo Marberry with the run charged to Zachary. Vic Aldridge retired the Senators in order in the bottom half as the Pirates&#x27; 6–3 win forced a Game 6 in Pittsburgh.

===Game 6===
The Senators struck first on Goose Goslin&#x27;s home run in the first, then added another run in the second on Roger Peckinpaugh&#x27;s RBI double, but Pirates&#x27; Ray Kremer would shut them out afterward. In the third, with runners on second and third, Clyde Barnhart&#x27;s groundout and Pie Traynor&#x27;s single scored a run each to tie the game. Eddie Moore&#x27;s fifth inning home run put the Pirates up 3–2. Their lead held, forcing a Game 7.

===Game 7===
The Senators loaded the bases in the first on a single and two walks with one out. A walk to Joe Judge and RBI single by Ossie Bluege put them up 2–0 and knock starter Vic Aldridge out of the game. Johnny Morrison came in relief, but a catcher interference call and error allowed two more runs to score. In the third, a leadoff single by Morrison, then RBI hits by Eddie Moore, Max Carey and Clyde Barnhart cut the Senators&#x27; lead to 4–3. In the fourth, Joe Harris&#x27;s two-run double extended Washington&#x27;s lead to 6–3. Back-to-back doubles by Carey and Kiki Cuyler in the fifth cut the lead to 6–4, then in the seventh, Moore reached first on an error before Carey&#x27;s RBI double and Traynor&#x27;s RBI triple tied the game. Roger Peckinpaugh&#x27;s home run in the eighth off Ray Kremer put the Senators back atop 7–6, but in the bottom half, back-to-back two-out doubles by Earl Smith and Carson Bigbee tied the game. A walk and fielder&#x27;s choice loaded the bases before Cuyler&#x27;s two-run double put the Pirates atop 9–7. Red Oldham retired the Senators in order in the ninth to end the series. The Pirates hit Walter Johnson hard for 15 hits in a 9–7 comeback win in rainy, wet and muddy conditions. The Pirates were the first team to come back from a 3–1 deficit in a seven-game series.

<text>Guillebert de Lannoy (also Gilbert, Guilbert or Ghillebert; 1386–1462), was a Flemish traveler and diplomat, chamberlain to the duke of Burgundy, governor of the fort of Sluys, and a knight of the Golden Fleece.

He was the son of Guillebert I de Lannoy and Catherine of Molembais. He was a member of the noble de Lannoy family.
His brothers were Hugo of Lannoy and Baldwin of Lannoy, also founding Knights of the Golden Fleece.

Guillebert first served Jean de Werchin, seneschal of Hainaut, and accompanied him to the East and to Spain. He then served John the Fearless in his war against the Prince-Bishopric of Liège and the Armagnac–Burgundian Civil War. He then joined the Teutonic Knights in the Polish–Lithuanian–Teutonic War.
Guillebert also fought in 1415 against the English in the Battle of Azincourt or Agincourt, where he was wounded and captured. 
In the service of Philip the Good, he discharged several diplomatic missions in France, England (as Ambassador to Henry V of England), Teutonic Knights, Poland, Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and Grand Duchy of Moscow and was one of the negotiators of the Treaty of Troyes (1420). In 1421 he was sent by Henry V of England to Palestine to inquire into the possibility of reviving the Kingdom of Jerusalem, and wrote an account of his travels, &quot;Les Pelerinages de Surye et de Egipte&quot;, which was published in 1826 and again in 1842.

His travels in the Baltic region and Russia are recounted in his book &quot;Voyages et Ambassades&quot;, published in Mons in 1840 with subsequent editions. Around 1440 Lannoy wrote &quot;L&#x27;Instruction de josne prince&quot; (&quot;Advice for a Young Prince&quot;), which he dressed up with a fictional origin in the court of Norway &quot;long, long ago&quot;, followed by a rediscovery of the manuscript text. The dedication miniature in Charles the Bold&#x27;s copy of 1468-70 illustrates the Norwegian story, but using up-to-date Burgundian costume and, it seems, the faces of the ducal family. Charles, around seven when the work was written, had no doubt always been the young prince Lannoy had in mind.

<text>The 1926 World Series was the championship series of the 1926 Major League Baseball season. The 23rd edition of the Series, it pitted the National League champion St. Louis Cardinals against the American League champion New York Yankees. The Cardinals defeated the Yankees four games to three in the best-of-seven series, which took place from October 2 to 10, 1926, at Yankee Stadium and Sportsman&#x27;s Park.

This was the first World Series appearance (and first National League pennant win) for the Cardinals, and would be the first of 11 World Series championships in Cardinals history. The Yankees were playing in their fourth World Series in six years after winning their first American League pennant in 1921 and their first world championship in 1923. They would play in another 36 World Series (and win 26 of those), as of the end of the 2023 season.

In Game 1, Herb Pennock pitched the Yankees to a 2–1 win over the Cards. In Game 2, pitcher Grover Cleveland Alexander evened the Series for St. Louis with a 6–2 victory. Knuckleballer Jesse Haines&#x27; shutout in Game 3 gave St. Louis a 2–1 Series lead. In the Yankees&#x27; 10–5 Game 4 win, Babe Ruth hit three home runs, a World Series record equaled only four times since. According to newspaper reports, Ruth had promised a sickly boy named Johnny Sylvester to hit a home run for him in Game 4. After Ruth&#x27;s three-homer game, the boy&#x27;s condition miraculously improved. The newspapers&#x27; account of the story is disputed by contemporary baseball historians, but it remains one of the most famous anecdotes in baseball history. Pennock again won for the Yankees in Game 5, 3–2.

Cards&#x27; player-manager Rogers Hornsby chose Alexander to start Game 6, and used him in relief to close out Game 7. Behind Alexander, the Cardinals won the final two games of the series, and thus the world championship. In Game 7, the Yankees, trailing 3–2 in the bottom of the ninth inning and down to their last out, Ruth walked, bringing up Bob Meusel. Ruth, successful in half of his stolen base attempts in his career, took off for second base on the first pitch. Meusel swung and missed, and catcher Bob O&#x27;Farrell threw to second baseman Hornsby who tagged Ruth out, ending Game 7 and thereby crowning his Cardinals World Series champions for the first time. The 1926 World Series is the only Series to date which ended with a baserunner being caught stealing.

This World Series also started the Cardinals run of dominance in the National League. Between the years 1926 and 1934, St. Louis captured five National League pennants and won three World Series titles.

In 2020, ESPN ranked the 1926 World Series as the 10th best ever played.

== Season summary ==
The Cardinals won the 1926 National League pennant with 89 wins and 65 losses, two games ahead of the runner-up Cincinnati Reds, after finishing only fourth in 1925 at 77–76. Before 1926 was half over, they traded outfielder Heinie Mueller to the New York Giants for outfielder Billy Southworth. They also claimed future Hall of Fame pitcher Grover Cleveland Alexander on waivers from the Chicago Cubs. Their starting rotation was led by Flint Rhem with 20 wins and a 3.21 earned run average (ERA), far surpassing his eight wins and 4.92 ERA of 1925. Offensively, the Cardinals were led by Jim Bottomley, Rogers Hornsby (who had batted over .400 in 1925) and catcher Bob O&#x27;Farrell, 1926 National League MVP-to-be.

The 1926 NL pennant race was heated. During the second and third weeks of September, both the Cardinals and the Reds had multi-game winning streaks and traded first and second place almost every day. On September 17, the Cards took a one-game lead over the Reds and extended their lead when the Reds lost several games in a row. They lost the last game of the season to the Reds on September 26, but still finished two games ahead of them in first place in the final standings.

The Yankees had the best record in the AL at 91–63, finishing three games ahead of the Cleveland Indians and greatly improving on their 69-win, seventh-place 1925 season. Lou Gehrig played his first full season as the Yankees&#x27; starting first baseman, and the team traded for rookie shortstop Tony Lazzeri in the offseason, eventually playing him at second base. Gehrig, Lazzeri and Ruth led the offense, while Pennock and Urban Shocker led the starting rotation with 42 wins between them.

In early September 1926, thousands of Cleveland fans, confident that their Indians would win the pennant even when they trailed the Yankees by six games, made World Series ticket reservations. By September 23, the Indians were only two games behind New York, but then lost three of their final four games to finish the season three games behind.

On September 11, Baseball Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis met with representatives from four of the top teams in each of the two major leagues. The group gave home field to the AL for World Series Games 1–2 (scheduled for October 2 and 3) and 6–7, while the NL would host Games 3–5. Each game was to start at 1:30 p.m. local time.

Some bookmakers made the Yankees a 15-to-1 Series favorite, while others, like New York&#x27;s top betting commissioners, thought the teams were evenly matched. One &quot;New York Times&quot; writer found &quot;little justification for installing either team as the favorite&quot;. Regardless of the odds, players from both teams were confident of victory. Hornsby said, &quot;We&#x27;re going to come through winners. We have the better pitching staff, the better hitters and the greater experience. That&#x27;s what it takes to win. ... We&#x27;re going to beat the Yankees. Any of my ball players will tell you that, and we expect to do it.&quot; Yankee skipper Miller Huggins retorted,

===Game 1===

Yankee Stadium was filled with 61,658 fans on October 2 for Game 1. Those without tickets gathered at City Hall to watch the game&#x27;s progress as charted on two large scoreboards. Before the start of the game, New York Supreme Court judge Robert F. Wagner, then a candidate for the United States Senate, threw out the ceremonial first pitch and took his position in the VIP box next to New York City mayor Jimmy Walker. Commissioner Landis and former heavyweight champion of the world Jack Dempsey were also in attendance. Southpaw Bill Sherdel started for the Cardinals, having posted a 16–12 record with 235 innings pitched in the regular season. The Yankees started Pennock, the team&#x27;s only 20-game winner that season. The future Hall of Fame pitcher, nicknamed &quot;The Knight of Kennett Square&quot; for his hometown, had a 3.62 ERA in 266 innings during the regular season, and had finished third in the American League Most Valuable Player Award balloting behind winner George Burns and runner-up Johnny Mostil.

Taylor Douthit led off Game 1 with a double to left, advanced to third on Southworth&#x27;s slow grounder to second baseman Tony Lazzeri, stayed there on Hornsby&#x27;s comebacker right to Pennock but came home on &quot;Sunny Jim&quot; Bottomley&#x27;s bloop single for the first run of the Series. In the bottom half, Sherdel walked Earle Combs, Babe Ruth and Bob Meusel, to load the bases. Gehrig scored Combs with a fielder&#x27;s choice grounder for his first World Series run batted in (RBI), reaching first ahead of the relay. The Cardinals and Yankees were tied 1–1 after the first inning.

In the bottom of the third, Ruth singled and Meusel bunted him over, but Ruth split his pants sliding into second, prompting radio announcer Graham McNamee to exclaim, &quot;Babe is the color of a red brick house!&quot; Doc Woods, the team&#x27;s trainer, ran out and sewed up Ruth&#x27;s pants, much to the amusement of the crowd.

The score was still tied at one apiece in the bottom of the sixth, just as rain began to fall. Ruth lined a single past third baseman Les Bell. Meusel again sacrificed Ruth to second. Gehrig followed with a single, scoring Ruth and giving the Yankees the lead. Lazzeri lined a shot to left but Gehrig, on a headfirst dive, was tagged out at third by Bell. Lazzeri advanced to second on the throw. Bell bobbled Dugan&#x27;s grounder for an error to put runners at first and third, but Hank Severeid forced Dugan at second to end the inning. The Yankees maintained their one-run advantage through the end of the eighth inning.

In the top of the ninth, Bottomley singled off Pennock but could not advance, giving the Yankees a 2–1 win in Game 1. Gehrig was their offensive star with both of his team&#x27;s RBIs. Pennock went the distance, striking out four and yielding but three hits, two in the first and one in the ninth. Hard-luck loser Sherdel gave up only two runs and six hits while striking out one.

===Game 2===

The second game was played the next day, October 3, at Yankee Stadium in front of a crowd of 63,600. Urban Shocker was the starting pitcher for the Yankees. With 19 wins and 11 losses, Shocker had the second-best pitching record on the team, behind the Game 1 starter, southpaw Herb Pennock. Shocker had a 3.38 ERA in 258 innings, along with 59 strikeouts in the 1926 season. The Cardinals&#x27; Game 2 starter was 39-year-old Grover Cleveland &quot;Old Pete&quot; Alexander, a veteran player in his 16th major league season. That season, he posted numbers considerably lower than the pitching season statistics from his prime in the late 1910s with the Philadelphia Phillies and Chicago Cubs. Alexander had compiled a 12–10 record in 200 innings, while posting a 3.05 ERA and 48 strikeouts, compared to the nearly 250 strikeouts he had in 1915 with the Phillies.

The Cardinals were first to bat in the game. After giving up a double to Rogers Hornsby, Shocker got a groundout from Jim Bottomley to end the run-scoring threat. In the Yankees&#x27; half of the inning, Mark Koenig grounded into a double play, and Babe Ruth followed by striking out. The Cardinals threatened again in the second inning, after singles by catcher Bob O&#x27;Farrell and shortstop Tommy Thevenow. However, Alexander came to the plate and popped up to Koenig to end the inning. The Yankees scored first in the bottom of the second inning. Bob Meusel hit a single into center field, and Lou Gehrig followed by hitting a grounder to Alexander, which advanced Meusel to second base. Tony Lazzeri then hit a single to left field that scored Meusel from second. Joe Dugan followed with a single of his own, moving Lazzeri to third base. On the following play, Yankees catcher Hank Severeid struck out, and Lazzeri then attempted to steal home plate. Alexander made an error on his throw to catcher Bob O&#x27;Farrell, and Lazzeri was able to slide into home plate for the second Yankees run of the inning. O&#x27;Farrell then threw the ball to Thevenow, but the tag was late and Dugan was called safe at second base. The inning ended when Alexander struck out Shocker.

In the third inning, Taylor Douthit hit an infield single to shortstop Koenig, and Billy Southworth followed with a single to left field, advancing Douthit to second base. Hornsby laid down a sacrifice bunt to Shocker, moving each runner up a base. Bottomley hit a single into left field, scoring both Douthit and Southworth. The next two batters, Les Bell and Chick Hafey, hit into outs to conclude the inning. In the top of the seventh inning. Bob O&#x27;Farrell lined a double, and Tommy Thevenow followed with a single into left field. Pitcher Alexander popped up to Lazzeri, and Douthit followed with a fly ball to left field. Southworth then hit a three-run home run, giving the Cardinals a 5–2 advantage over the Yankees. Hornsby then grounded out to Koenig to end the inning. Gehrig, Lazzeri and Dugan all grounded out in the bottom of the seventh inning. In the top of the eighth, Bottomley hit a single into right field. Yankees manager Miller Huggins came out of the dugout and took Shocker out of the game, calling in Bob Shawkey from the bullpen to replace him. Shawkey struck out the first two batters he faced, and Bottomley was tagged out after attempting to steal second base. The Yankees could not produce any runs in their half of the inning.

In the ninth inning, Sad Sam Jones, a 22-year veteran in the American League, replaced Dutch Ruether, who had replaced pitcher Shawkey. Jones gave up an inside-the-park home run to Thevenow. Thevenow had only two other home runs in his career, both of which were inside-the-park and during the 1926 regular season. Jones then walked Douthit and Hornsby and gave up a single to Southworth. With the bases loaded and two outs in the top of the ninth inning, Bottomley hit a fly ball to center fielder Earle Combs. The Yankees did not score in the bottom of the ninth inning, and lost the game to the Cardinals by a 6–2 score. Alexander pitched a complete game, allowed hits in only two of the nine innings and did not allow a Yankee hit after the third inning. He also had a series-high 10 strikeouts, allowing four hits, one earned run and one walk. Meanwhile, the Yankees&#x27; starter Shocker allowed ten hits and five earned runs, including a home run, in seven innings of work. Shawkey had a perfect inning with two strikeouts, while Jones gave up two hits and allowed two walks in the ninth inning.

===Game 3===

After Game 2 ended on October 3, the Yankees and Cardinals boarded trains to St. Louis, Missouri. The mayor of St. Louis, Victor J. Miller, ordered that the workday end by three the next afternoon so that the city could welcome the Cardinals at Union Station. The Cardinals players were treated like champions by fans and citizens alike. Just outside the station, Mayor Miller stood at a podium and presented club manager and player Rogers Hornsby with a brand new Lincoln sedan priced at US$4,000 and paid for by the city&#x27;s top businessmen. Each member of the Cardinals&#x27; team received a new hat, a new pair of shoes, and an engraved white-gold watch valued at a manufacturer&#x27;s price of $100. As the Cardinals were receiving special treatment from the people of St. Louis, fans were lining up outside Sportsman&#x27;s Park with the hope of being able to purchase tickets to Game 3 for a price of $3.30.

Sportsman&#x27;s Park was filled with 37,708 people on October 5 for Game 3. On the mound for the Cardinals was right-handed knuckleball pitcher Jesse Haines, a future Hall of Famer with a 13–4 record and 3.25 ERA in 183 innings in 1926. Starting for the Yankees was southpaw pitcher Dutch Ruether, who had a 14–9 record with a 4.60 ERA in 1926.

The game was rain delayed for 30 minutes during the top half of the fourth inning. Once the game resumed, the Cardinals came to bat and scored the first runs of the game. Les Bell, a .325 hitter with 17 home runs that season, led the Cardinals with a single to center field. Chick Hafey dropped a sacrifice bunt straight to Ruether, who then threw it to second baseman Tony Lazzeri. Bell beat Lazzeri&#x27;s tag at second base and was called safe by the umpire. Bob O&#x27;Farrell was walked, and Tommy Thevenow hit a grounder to Lazzeri, who tossed it to Mark Koenig for the force out at second base. Koenig tagged O&#x27;Farrell out, but made an error in his throw to first baseman Lou Gehrig, which resulted in a run. Then, Haines hit a Ruether pitch for a two-run home run.

The Cardinals were leading the Yankees 3–0 by the end of the inning. The Yankees failed to produce any offense in the fifth inning, but the Cardinals added to their lead by picking up a run when Billy Southworth beat the tag at home following a Jim Bottomley grounder to second base. Ruether was then replaced by Bob Shawkey, who closed out the inning by yielding two weak infield groundouts. The Yankees picked up one hit in each of the next two innings, but could not produce any runs. Yankees pitcher Myles Thomas came in to pitch a hitless ninth inning. With one out in the top of the ninth inning, Lou Gehrig hit a line drive single into right field, but Lazzeri grounded into a double play, ending the game as a 4–0 Cardinals victory. Haines pitched a complete-game shutout, and only gave up five hits total, two of which came from Gehrig.

===Game 4===
Future Hall of Famer Waite Hoyt started Game 4 for the Yankees at Sportsman&#x27;s Park on October 6. Hoyt had a 16–12 record with a 3.85 ERA in 218 innings for the 1926 season. This was Hoyt&#x27;s fourth World Series with the Yankees, and he entered the 1926 Series with over 35 innings of pitching experience in the championship series. He was opposed by Flint Rhem, the Cardinals&#x27; 20-game winner who had led the team with both a .741 winning percentage and 258 innings pitched.
In the first inning, after striking out Earle Combs and Mark Koenig, Rhem gave up a home run to Babe Ruth. Bob Meusel was then walked, but was tagged out at home after attempting to score on a Lou Gehrig single. The Cardinals came into the bottom of the first with two straight singles to put runners at first and third base. Rogers Hornsby singled in Taylor Douthit to tie the game at 1–1 and moved Billy Southworth to second base. Jim Bottomley flied out to left field, and Les Bell followed with a sacrifice fly to center fielder Combs. With the go-ahead run at third base, Hornsby stole second, but Chick Hafey struck out to end to the Cardinals&#x27; run-scoring threat. Two innings later, Ruth came up to the plate with two outs and hit Rhem&#x27;s pitch for a home run, his second of the game. Gehrig led off the next inning with a strikeout. Tony Lazzeri followed with a walk, and Joe Dugan hit a run-scoring double. Catcher Hank Severeid hit a single into center field, and Dugan ran towards home. He was tagged out at the plate by catcher Bob O&#x27;Farrell. The Yankees&#x27; starter Hoyt struck out to end the inning.

The Cardinals responded by scoring three runs in the bottom of the fourth inning. With one out and no runners on the bases, Hafey hit a single. O&#x27;Farrell followed and hit a ground ball towards Koenig that he bobbled, enabling O&#x27;Farrell and Hafey to reach first and second base, respectively. Tommy Thevenow followed with a double to right field that got by Meusel, scoring Hafey and moving O&#x27;Farrell to third base. Cardinals&#x27; manager Rogers Hornsby then put in left-handed infielder Specs Toporczer to pinch hit for Rhem, who was done pitching for the game. Toporczer hit a fly ball to Earle Combs in center field, upon which O&#x27;Farrell promptly tagged up to score another Cardinal run. With the game tied at three apiece and a runner at second base, Douthit hit a double in the outfield, which scored Thevenow. Southworth followed with a single to left fielder Ruth, and Douthit immediately tried to score. Ruth threw from left field to catcher Hank Severeid, who tagged Douthit out at home plate.

To start the top of the fifth inning, Art Reinhart was put in as pitcher. Reinhart walked Combs and followed by giving up a run-scoring double to Koenig. He then walked Ruth and Meusel in succession to load the bases for Gehrig. Reinhart walked Gehrig, allowing Koenig to score and keeping the bases loaded with no outs. Hi Bell replaced Reinhart as pitcher, but he was not able to suppress the Yankees&#x27; offense. Lazzeri hit a sacrifice fly to right field, which scored Ruth and moved Meusel up to third base. Dugan then hit a weak groundball; he was thrown out at first by catcher O&#x27;Farrell, but Meusel scored and Gehrig went to second base. Bell then balked, moving Gehrig to third base. Severeid was walked, and pitcher Hoyt ended the inning by hitting into a force play at second base.

The Yankees expanded on their three-run lead in the next inning. After the entire Yankees lineup batted in the fifth inning, Combs was back at the plate to start the sixth. Combs hit an infield single past shortstop Thevenow. Koenig followed by striking out. Ruth, with two home runs already in the game, came up to the plate. The count on Ruth went up to three balls and two strikes before he hit a long home run. Ruth&#x27;s three home runs was a feat equaled only thrice since. As one of the game announcers (either McNamee or Carlin) described the situation:

It was measured at over and had cleared the wall in center field, crashing through the window of an auto dealer across the street from the stadium. Locals claimed it was the longest home run ever hit in St. Louis. Meusel then hit a single in right field, but was tagged out as he tried to head for second base. Gehrig followed with a double to the opposite side, but could not score when Lazzeri popped up to Thevenow to end the inning.

In the seventh inning, the Yankees faced a new pitcher, this time southpaw Bill Hallahan, who served as both a starter and reliever for the Cardinals. After Severeid singled and subsequently advanced on a sacrifice bunt by Hoyt, he scored on a double hit into left field by Combs. The Yankees led 10–4 and did not get any more runs or hits in the eighth or ninth inning. The Cardinals came up to bat in the bottom of the ninth inning with Hoyt trying to hold on to his six-run lead. Hornsby singled to right field and advanced to second base on the following play. He then ran home to score a run on a Les Bell single to center field. Hafey then popped up in foul territory, and Severeid made the catch. The game ended with a 10–5 score. Waite Hoyt pitched a complete game, allowing two earned runs on 14 hits while striking out eight batters. The Cardinals&#x27; five pitchers combined to give up 10 Yankee runs and 14 hits. With the series tied at two games apiece, both teams anticipated Game 5, which featured a rematch between Herb Pennock and Bill Sherdel.

====Babe Ruth and Johnny Sylvester====
The 1926 World Series produced one of the most famous anecdotes in baseball history, involving Babe Ruth and Johnny Sylvester. Sylvester was an 11-year-old boy from Essex Fells, New Jersey who was supposedly hospitalized after falling off a horse. Sylvester asked his father to get him a baseball autographed by Babe Ruth. Prior to the start of the World Series, the boy&#x27;s parents sent urgent telegrams to the Yankees in St. Louis, asking for an autographed ball. Soon, the family received an airmail package with two balls, one autographed by the entire St. Louis Cardinals team and the other with signatures from a number of Yankees players and a personal message from Ruth saying, &quot;I&#x27;ll knock a homer for you on Wednesday&quot;. After Ruth hit three home runs in Game 4 on October 6, newspapers reported that Sylvester&#x27;s condition had miraculously improved. After the World Series had ended, Ruth made a highly publicized visit to Sylvester&#x27;s home, in which the boy said to Ruth, &quot;I&#x27;m sorry the Yanks lost the series&quot;. In the spring of 1927, Sylvester&#x27;s uncle visited Ruth and thanked him for saving the boy&#x27;s life. Ruth asked how the boy was doing and asked the uncle to give the boy his regards. After the man left, Ruth, who was seated next to a group of baseball writers, said, &quot;Now who the hell is Johnny Sylvester?&quot;

There have been many alternate versions of this event. One version, which was later portrayed in &quot;The Babe Ruth Story&quot;, claims that Ruth went to Sylvester&#x27;s hospital bed and promised him in person that he would hit a home run for him. On October 9, Ruth followed up on Sylvester and told him he would &quot;try to knock you another homer, maybe two today&quot;. Differing newspaper reports from October 1926 claimed that Sylvester suffered from blood poisoning, a spinal infection, a sinus condition, or had a condition requiring a spinal fusion. Contemporary analyses dispute whether Sylvester was ever hospitalized, dying, or if Ruth&#x27;s three home runs had actually saved the boy&#x27;s life, as claimed by the newspapers.

===Game 5===

Game 5, played at Sportsman&#x27;s Park in St. Louis on October 7, featured a rematch between Game 1 starters Herb Pennock and Bill Sherdel. Pennock had pitched a complete game three-hitter in the 2–1 Yankees victory, while Sherdel had pitched seven innings, giving up two runs and six hits.

Through the first three innings of the fifth game, both pitchers held the opposing team to no runs and a limited number of hits. In the bottom of the fourth inning, the Cardinals cracked through Pennock&#x27;s tough pitching. Jim Bottomley began by hitting a one-out double past left fielder Babe Ruth. Les Bell followed with a single to right field, scoring Bottomley. Chick Hafey then hit a fly ball caught in foul territory by Ruth, and Bell was called out while attempting to steal second base. In the top of the sixth inning, Pennock hit a line drive double into left field past Hafey. Cardinals&#x27; catcher Bob O&#x27;Farrell threw to Tommy Thevenow in hopes of picking off Pennock, who was standing a considerable distance away from second base. Thevenow made an error with his tag on Pennock, and Pennock was safe at second base. Earle Combs, the Yankees leadoff hitter, followed by drawing a walk. With runners at first and second base, Koenig hit a single to left fielder Hafey. Pennock scored on the play, and Combs moved to second base. Ruth then struck out, and Bob Meusel followed by hitting a sacrifice fly to right fielder Billy Southworth, on which Combs promptly advanced to third base. Lou Gehrig drew a walk to load the bases for Tony Lazzeri, who ended the inning by hitting a fly ball to center fielder Wattie Holm.

The Cardinals came back to take the lead in the bottom of the seventh inning. Bell led the inning by hitting a double into left field. After a Hafey fly out, O&#x27;Farrell hit a single to Ruth in left field, and Bell ran from second base to home to score the run and give the Cardinals a 2–1 advantage. In the top of the ninth inning, the Yankees tied up the game. Gehrig lined a double to left field, and Lazzeri bunted a single, advancing Gehrig to third base. Ben Paschal went in as a pinch-hitter for Joe Dugan and singled into center field, scoring Gehrig and advancing Lazzeri to second base. Severeid laid down a weak bunt, and Cardinals catcher O&#x27;Farrell threw to third base to make the force out on Lazzeri. With runners at first and second base, Pennock hit a groundball to shortstop Thevenow, who tossed it to second base to get the force out on Severeid. With Pennock at first base and Paschal at third base, Combs grounded to second base, ending the Yankees&#x27; hope of taking the lead. The Cardinals could not break the 2–2 tie in the bottom of the ninth inning, so the game went into extra innings.

The Yankees immediately took advantage of Sherdel in the top of the tenth inning. Koenig led things off by singling into left field. Sherdel threw a wild pitch to Ruth, and Koenig advanced to second base. Ruth then walked, and Meusel followed with a sacrifice bunt straight to pitcher Sherdel. Meusel was out at first base, but Ruth and Koenig were safe at second and third base, respectively. Gehrig was intentionally walked, loading the bases. Lazzeri hit a fly ball to left field, and Koenig tagged up on the play to score a run and give the Yankees a one-run lead. Mike Gazella, in place of Joe Dugan at third base, was hit by a pitch from Sherdel. With the bases loaded again, Severeid popped up to second baseman Rogers Hornsby to end the Yankee rally. The Cardinals got a single from Thevenow in the bottom of the tenth inning, but they could not score any runs. The game ended with the Yankees winning by a score of 3–2. Both Pennock and Sherdel pitched ten-inning complete games. Sherdel gave up nine hits and two earned runs, while walking five and striking out two. Pennock finished the game giving up just seven hits and two runs, while striking out four batters.

===Game 6===
The teams moved back to Yankee Stadium for Game 6. Over 48,000 fans came into Yankee Stadium on October 9 to see if the Yankees could win their second World Series in franchise history. The game&#x27;s pitching matchup was between Grover Cleveland Alexander and Bob Shawkey, both of whom had made appearances in previous games in the series. Shawkey had come in as relief in Games 2 and 3, while Alexander had pitched a complete game against the Yankees in the Cardinals&#x27; Game 2 victory. In the 1926 season, Shawkey had made most of his pitching appearances in relief, and had been an occasional starter on the Yankees rotation. He started 10 of his 29 total pitching appearances and posted an 8–7 record with a 3.62 earned run average.

The game was lopsided from the start. In the top of the first inning, Shawkey gave up three runs on three hits, with the runs coming from a Jim Bottomley double and Les Bell single. Alexander encountered a minor setback in the fourth inning. To open up the bottom of the inning, Bob Meusel launched a triple into left field and scored on the following ground out by Lou Gehrig. Alexander shut down the Yankees for the rest of the inning, and the Cardinals held on to a 3–1 lead. In the top of the fifth inning, the Cardinals expanded their two-run lead. Tommy Thevenow hit a single to left fielder Babe Ruth. Alexander laid down a sacrifice bunt and was tagged out by first baseman Gehrig, but was successful in advancing Thevenow to second base. Wattie Holm, substituting for Taylor Douthit as center fielder, followed by hitting a single into center field, scoring Thevenow on the play. Billy Southworth and Rogers Hornsby followed with groundouts in the infield to end the inning.

The Cardinals scored again in the top of the seventh inning. Thevenow again led the inning by hitting a single into left field. Alexander bunted right in front of the plate. Yankees catcher Hank Severeid made the throw to second baseman Tony Lazzeri, but Lazzeri made an error on the play, and both runners were safe at their respective bases. Holm followed by hitting a weak grounder that led to a force out of Thevenow at third base. With runners at first and second base, Southworth lined a double right by Ruth, scoring Alexander and sending Holm to third base. Urban Shocker, the starter in Game 2, then came in to relieve Shawkey as pitcher. Shocker gave up a single to Hornsby into center field, allowing Holm and Southworth to score. Bottomley then hit a grounder to shortstop Mark Koenig, who stepped on second base to get Hornsby out on the force play. Bell followed with a two-run home run, extending the Cardinals&#x27; lead to 9–1. Chick Hafey lined a double into left field, but Bob O&#x27;Farrell ended the inning by striking out. In the bottom of the seventh inning, the Yankees scored one run on an Earle Combs single to cut the Cardinals&#x27; lead to seven runs.

In the eighth inning, Myles Thomas came in to relieve Shocker, who had given up three hits and two unearned runs in less than an inning of work. Meanwhile, Alexander shut down the Yankees offense for the rest of the game. In the top of the ninth inning, the Cardinals increased their lead back to eight runs after Hornsby had an RBI groundout, scoring Southworth. Alexander finished with his second complete game of the series and gave up only two runs on eight hits, while striking out six batters. The three Yankee pitchers combined to give up 13 hits, seven earned runs, three unearned runs, and one home run.

===Game 7===
The deciding Game 7 was played on October 10, 1926, at Yankee Stadium in front of a crowd of 38,093 people. The game featured two future Hall of Famers, who were both winners in their respective pitching appearances earlier in the series. Jesse Haines took to the mound for the Cardinals; he had pitched in relief in Game 1 and threw a complete-game shutout against the Yankees in Game 3. Waite Hoyt had pitched a complete-game 10–5 Yankees victory in Game 4.
The Yankees scored the first run of the game in the third inning on a Babe Ruth home run into the right field bleachers. In the following half inning, the Cardinals came back to take a 3–1 lead over the Yankees. Jim Bottomley lined a one-out single into left field to start the Cardinals&#x27; fourth inning rally. Les Bell just barely made it to first base after shortstop Mark Koenig accidentally kicked the ball while trying to field it. With runners at first and second base, Chick Hafey hit a bloop single into left field, which loaded up the bases for catcher Bob O&#x27;Farrell. This time, left fielder Bob Meusel made an error by dropping O&#x27;Farrell&#x27;s fly ball, so Bottomley scored to tie the game, and the bases remained loaded. Tommy Thevenow followed with a two-run single to right fielder Ruth. Hoyt struck out the next batter, and Wattie Holm hit into a force play at second base. All three runs in the inning were charged as unearned on Hoyt, due to the two Yankee errors.

In the sixth inning, the Yankees cut the Cardinals&#x27; lead. With two outs, Joe Dugan hit a single. Hank Severeid followed with a double, scoring Dugan, before pinch-hitter Ben Paschal grounded to Haines to end the inning. Game 1 and 5 winner Herb Pennock came in relief for Hoyt in the seventh inning. He yielded only one hit in the inning and limited the Cardinals to their 3–2 lead. In the bottom half of the inning, the Yankees loaded up the bases with Earle Combs, Ruth and Lou Gehrig. At this point, there were two outs, and Haines had developed a blister on his pitching hand, and could no longer pitch in the game.

Rogers Hornsby had to determine who he would put in to replace Haines as pitcher. Although Grover Cleveland Alexander had pitched a complete game the day before and may have spent the night drinking (Alexander later denied this, saying that Hornsby specifically told him to limit his celebrating since he might be needed the next day), Hornsby decided to trust him after Alexander said he &quot;had it in easy in there&quot; in Game 6 and would be ready whenever Hornsby needed him. According to the popular legend, Alexander told Hornsby his strategy: After getting a strike on Lazzeri, Alexander would then throw an inside fastball. Hornsby warned him that that pitch was Lazzeri&#x27;s favorite. Alexander responded that if Lazzeri swung at it, he would hit it foul, and Alexander would then throw an outside curve to strike him out. Hornsby then supposedly said, &quot;Who am I to tell &quot;you&quot; how to pitch?&quot; The first two pitches thrown by Alexander to batter Tony Lazzeri went for a strike and a ball, respectively. On the third pitch, Lazzeri hit a fly ball down the left-field line. The ball initially appeared to be going into the stands for a grand slam, but at the last second, it curved several feet into the stands in foul territory. Alexander then threw a curveball that Lazzeri swung at and missed for strike three, ending the inning and the Yankees&#x27; threat.

Alexander retired the Yankees in order in the eighth inning. The Cardinals did nothing offensively in the top of the ninth inning, so it was up to Alexander to preserve the Cardinals&#x27; game in the bottom of the ninth. Alexander got the first two batters of the inning, Combs and Dugan, to ground out to third baseman Bell. With two outs and no runners on base, Alexander faced Ruth. Ruth had hit a solo home run and walked three times in the game. Manager Hornsby walked to the mound to talk with Alexander. Alexander told Hornsby that he would rather face Ruth than intentionally walk him. Alexander&#x27;s first pitch to Ruth fell in for a solid strike in the middle of the plate. Alexander&#x27;s next pitch fell outside of the strike zone for ball one. Ruth then fouled the next pitch, making the count one ball and two strikes. Alexander&#x27;s next two pitches fell too low for balls two and three, making it a full count. The following full count pitch was noted by &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; sportswriter W. O. McGeehan: &quot;The count went to three and two, Ruth was swaying eagerly. The soupbone creaked again. The ball seemed a fraction of an inch from being a strike. Ruth paused a moment. Even he was uncertain. Then he trotted down to first.&quot;

With two outs and Ruth at first base, left fielder Bob Meusel came up to the plate, with Lou Gehrig waiting in the batting circle after him. Meusel was a .315 hitter that year and had batted in 81 runs in just over 100 regular-season games. Meusel also had success in Game 6 against Alexander, with a double and triple. Just as Meusel was about to take his first pitch, Ruth made the bold move of trying to steal second base. Ruth was known as a good but overly aggressive baserunner, with about a 50% success rate at stealing bases in his career, and his attempt surprised many people throughout the stadium. Meusel swung and missed, and Cardinals catcher Bob O&#x27;Farrell immediately threw the ball to second baseman Hornsby. Hornsby reached for the ball, and laid the tag immediately on Ruth. As the game announcer described it, &quot;Ruth is walked again for the fourth time today. One strike on Bob Meusel. Going down to second! The game is over! Babe tried to steal second and is put out catcher to second!&quot;

As Hornsby recalled later, Ruth &quot;didn&#x27;t say a word. He didn&#x27;t even look around or up at me. He just picked himself up and walked away&quot;. Ruth&#x27;s failed attempt to steal second base ended the 1926 World Series; it is the only time a World Series has ended with a runner being caught stealing. Ruth explained later that he attempted to steal second base because he thought no one would expect it. He hoped that by getting to second base, he could have an easier chance at scoring if Meusel hit a single into the outfield.

==Aftermath==
The Cardinals went back home to St. Louis to a rapturous fan reception, having won their first undisputed world championship. Each member of the championship team collected $5,584.51, while the Yankees&#x27; players were given $3,417.75 each.

To date, the Cardinals&#x27; 11 world championships are the most won by any National League team, and rank second only to the Yankees&#x27; 27. The Cardinals&#x27; and Yankees&#x27; last wins were within two years of each other (having occurred in 2011 and 2009, respectively). The two teams would meet again in 1928 (which the Yankees swept in four games); 1942 (which the Cardinals won in five games); 1943 (which the Yankees won in five games); and 1964 (which the Cardinals won in seven games).

As for the Yankees, Game 7 of the 1926 series marked the last postseason loss for the team in a decade. The Bronx Bombers would go on to sweep their next three World Series, 1927, 1928, and 1932. Their next World Series loss would be Game 1 of the 1936 World Series which the Yankees would eventually win 4 games to 2.

<text>The 1927 [[World Series]] was the championship series in Major League Baseball for the 1927 season. The 24th edition of the World Series, it matched the American League champion New York Yankees against the National League champion Pittsburgh Pirates. The Yankees won in four games. This was the first sweep of a National League team by an American League team.

That year, the Yankees led the American League in runs scored, hits, triples, home runs, base on balls, batting average, slugging average and on-base percentage. It featured legends Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig at their peaks. The team won a then-league record 110 games, finished with a 19-game lead over second place, and are considered by many to be the greatest team in the history of baseball.

The 1927 Pittsburgh Pirates, with MVP Paul Waner, led the National League in runs, hits, batting average and on-base percentage.

==Teams==

===New York Yankees===

The 1927 New York Yankees had perhaps the most feared line-up in the history of baseball. Nicknamed &quot;Murderers Row,&quot; with Babe Ruth at the peak of his considerable powers, hitting .356 with a then-record 60 home runs and 164 RBI that year. He was complemented by future Hall of Famers Lou Gehrig at first base, who hit .373 with 47 home runs and a league-leading 175 RBI, Tony Lazzeri at second base who drove in 102 runs with a .309 average, and center fielder Earle Combs, who hit .356 and scored 137 runs as the team&#x27;s leadoff hitter. Left fielder Bob Meusel also drove in over 100 runs, with a .337 average.

The team&#x27;s pitching staff was led by another Hall of Famer, Waite Hoyt, who had his best season with a 22–7 record and a league-leading 2.63 ERA to add to his league-leading wins total. Three more pitchers won 18 or more games, rookie Wilcy Moore (19–7, 2.28), Herb Pennock (19–8, 3.00) and Urban Shocker (18–6, 2.84). Moore would have won the ERA title under current rules, but in those days qualification was based on the number of complete games pitched, and he made only 12 starts all year: 13 of his wins and a league-leading 13 saves (figured retroactively) came during his 38 relief appearances. Rounding out the staff were veteran Dutch Ruether (13–6, 3.38), George Pipgras (10–3, 4.11) and swingman Myles Thomas (7–4, 4.87).

To no one&#x27;s surprise, the Yankees ran away with the pennant under the leadership of manager Miller Huggins. They finished with a record of 110–44, 19 games in front of the second-place Philadelphia Athletics. They were overwhelming favorites to win the World Series.

===Pittsburgh Pirates===
The 1927 Pittsburgh Pirates were by no means a weak team, but they certainly suffer in comparison with their American League rivals. The Pirates went 94–60 for manager Donie Bush during the regular season, finishing games ahead of the defending World Champions St. Louis Cardinals.

The Pirates also had their share of future Hall of Famers, but they were not quite of the caliber of those of the Yankees. The team&#x27;s best hitter was right fielder Paul &quot;Big Poison&quot; Waner, who hit a league-leading .380 and drove in 131 runs, also a league-leading total. His brother, rookie center fielder Lloyd &quot;Little Poison&quot; Waner hit .355 and scored a league-leading 133 runs, in spite of his almost complete lack of power (he collected just 25 extra-base hits in over 650 plate appearances). Third baseman Pie Traynor hit .342 and drove in over 100 runs, joining shortstop Glenn Wright who also topped the century mark. However, Wright and Paul Waner also led the team in home runs with 9 each, underscoring the huge difference in power with their rivals: the Pirates hit 54 home runs as a team, fewer than Babe Ruth by himself, and barely a third as many as the Yankees&#x27; 158.

Other solid hitters for the Pirates included first baseman Joe Harris, who hit .326 with 73 RBI, second baseman George Grantham (.305) and left fielder Clyde Barnhart (.319). In fact, catcher Johnny Gooch, who hit .258, was the only regular besides Wright to hit below .300, and back-up outfielder Kiki Cuyler added his own .309 average in 285 at-bats to the parade, as the Pirates batted .305 as a team—pitchers included.

The Pirates&#x27; pitching was not as dominant. Two veterans of the 1925 World Championship team, Lee Meadows and Ray Kremer both posted 19 wins, with Kremer leading the league with a 2.47 ERA. Carmen Hill had pitched part of six seasons in the majors before 1927, never winning more than three games. In 1927, he put everything together, winning a team-leading 22 games against 11 losses, with a 3.24 ERA at age 31. Vic Aldridge went 15–10 as the fourth starter, but his 4.25 ERA was well over the league average. In the bullpen, Johnny Miljus put together a good season, posting a 1.90 ERA in 76 innings, with an 8–3 record.

==Series Summary==
==Matchups==

===Game 1===
The 1927 World Series opened under sunny skies and balmy weather at Forbes Field in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on Wednesday, October 5. The crowd of 41,467 saw Yankee right-hander Waite Hoyt (22–6, 2.64 ERA) and Pirate ace Ray Kremer (19–8, 2.47 ERA) oppose each other in Game 1.

The Governor of Pennsylvania, John S. Fisher was at Forbes Field, as well as New York City Mayor Jimmy Walker. Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis was seated near the Yankees&#x27; dugout. National League President John A. Heydler was in another field box.

Adding to the festivities was a brass band in red coats that paraded around the field before the game. The photographers took pictures of Pirates&#x27; Manager Donie Bush and the Yankees&#x27; Miller Huggins shaking hands. The Babe was photographed with Huggins, Bush, Mayor Walker, Lou Gehrig, and the Waners.

When the game started, Earle Combs hit the first ball Kremer threw and drove it deep to left field, where Clyde Barnhart caught it. After Mark Koenig struck out swinging, Babe Ruth came up. He swung at the first ball and singled to right field for the first hit of the series. Then on a count of three and two, Gehrig hit a short fly to right field. Paul Waner tried to make a shoestring catch, but the ball got through him for a triple and Ruth scored.

In the bottom of the first, the Pirates tied the game at one. Lloyd Waner was hit by a pitch, moved to third on his brother&#x27;s double, and tagged up on Glenn Wright&#x27;s sacrifice fly. With one out in the third, second baseman George Grantham kicked Koenig&#x27;s grounder behind first base for an error. Ruth again hit Kremer&#x27;s first pitch and smashed a single to right, sending Koenig to third. Gehrig walked.

With the bases loaded, Kremer walked Bob Meusel, forcing home Koenig. Tony Lazzeri then grounded to Wright, who got the ball to second in time to force Meusel, but Grantham could not get rid of it in time to complete a double play. Ruth scored. With Gehrig on third and Lazzeri on first, a double steal was attempted. Catcher Earl Smith made a bluff throw to second and then threw to Pie Traynor at third, catching Gehrig halfway between the bases, but Smith let Traynor&#x27;s return throw to the plate get past him for an error. Gehrig scored. The Yankees led 4–1.

The Pirates picked up one run in the bottom of the third on Kremer&#x27;s double and Paul Waner&#x27;s single, making the score 4–2. After Hoyt developed a blister on a finger of his pitching hand in the fourth, Huggins watched him carefully. Koenig doubled to center in the fifth and went to third when Ruth grounded out to Grantham. Gehrig&#x27;s sacrifice fly to Paul Waner scored Koenig.

The Pirates came back with one run in the bottom of the inning on Lloyd Waner&#x27;s double and Barnhart&#x27;s single to left. After Lazzeri doubled in the sixth, Pirates Manager Donie Bush lifted Kremer and brought in right-hander Johnny Miljus, who retired the side.

Pittsburgh came up in the eighth trailing 5–3. Wright lined a single over Lazzeri&#x27;s head. Then Traynor lined a single to center. Wright stopped at second. Huggins decided that Hoyt had had enough and called for Wilcy Moore.

Grantham grounded to Gehrig who threw to Koenig in time to force Traynor at second. On the play, Koenig was bowled over and had the air knocked out of him. Wright went to third on the play and scored on Joe Harris&#x27;s single to center, making the score 5–4. On a daring run and long slide, Grantham beat Combs&#x27;s throw to third. Smith then grounded to Gehrig, who stepped on first to end the inning. Moore retired the Pirates in order in the ninth. The Yankees won Game 1 of the World Series, 5–4.

===Game 2===
41,634 were in attendance for Game 2.

The Pirates opened the scoring in the bottom of the first. Lloyd Waner tripled down the left field foul line, and Clyde Barnhart drove Ruth up against the concrete wall in right on his sacrifice fly scoring Waner. The Pirates led 1–0.

In the top of the third, Combs singled between Harris and Grantham and raced to third on Koenig&#x27;s line single over second, scoring on Lloyd Waner&#x27;s fumble sending Koenig around to third. Ruth&#x27;s high sacrifice fly to Lloyd Waner scored Koenig. Gehrig doubled to the exit gate in right-center. Wright then made an acrobatic diving stop of Meusel&#x27;s drive headed for left field but couldn&#x27;t regain his balance in time to throw Meusel out, Gehrig reaching third base and scoring on Lazzeri&#x27;s sacrifice fly to Paul Waner. The Yankees led 3–1.

Pipgras pitched beautifully, with a blazing fastball and a sharp-breaking curve, scattering six hits over seven innings. In the top of the eighth, Meusel singled over second. On a hit-and-run play, Lazzeri singled to right, Meusel racing to third. When Aldridge&#x27;s wild pitch almost knocked Dugan down, Meusel scored and Lazzeri went to second. Dugan attempted a sacrifice bunt, but catcher Johnny Gooch pounced on the ball and threw to third base to get Lazzeri sliding in.
Aldridge then walked Benny Bengough and Pipgras, and southpaw Mike Cvengros relieved him. He hit Combs forcing in Dugan, and gave up a single to Koenig scoring Bengough. The Yankees led 6–1, and held on to win 6–2.

===Game 3===
The Series moved to New York for Game 3 without a travel day off.

Starter Herb Pennock retired leadoff hitter Lloyd Waner on an easy roller to Koenig. Rhyne and Paul Waner both flied to Meusel in left. With the Yankees up in the first, on a count of two and two, leadoff hitter Combs slapped a single over second. Koenig got an infield hit on a ground ball that bounced off starter Lee Meadows&#x27; glove and was kicked around by Rhyne, Combs reaching second. After Ruth popped to Wright behind second, Gehrig got hold of a fastball and drove it to the warning track in left-center for a triple scoring both Combs and Koenig, but was thrown out at the plate trying for an inside-the-park home run. The Yankees led 2–0.

Pennock was in total control. He retired the Pirates in order without a hit over the first seven innings. Lazzeri opened the home half of the seventh with a single into short center, only the fifth hit of the game, all by the Yanks. Dugan bunted him to second and beat the throw to first. Huggins sent up Cedric Durst to bat for Grabowski. His grounder moved Lazzeri to third and Dugan to second. Rhyne fielded Pennock&#x27;s slow grounder but threw to the plate too late to get Lazzeri, Dugan taking third and Pennock reaching first. Koenig&#x27;s deep double to right wall scored Pennock and put Combs on third. Lefthander Mike Cvengros relieved Meadows, but Ruth crushed a home run high into the right-field bleachers, the crowd cheering wildly as he trotted around the bases behind Combs and Koenig. The inning finally ended when Cvengros struck out Gehrig and Meusel. The Yankees led 8–0, and held on for an 8–1 win. Pennock finished with a three-hitter, walking none.

===Game 4===
Looking to become the manager of the first American League club to sweep a World Series in four straight games, Huggins sent Wilcy Moore to the mound against the Pirates&#x27; Carmen Hill for Game 4.

Lloyd Waner led off the game with a drive off Moore&#x27;s glove and beat it out for a hit. Koenig threw out Barnhart, sending Little Poison to second. Wright singled to right, scoring Waner. The Yanks tied the game at one in the bottom of the first when the first three hitters, Combs, Koenig and Ruth, all singled to right.

In the bottom of the fifth inning, Combs singled to short center. Koenig struck out swinging but Ruth hit his second home run of the Series, to deep center. The Yankees led 3–1.

In the top of the seventh inning, Smith would have grounded out third to first base, but Moore dropped Gehrig&#x27;s toss for an error. Pitcher Emil Yde ran for Smith, and Fred Brickell batted for Hill. Lazzeri, in his haste to make a double play on Brickell&#x27;s grounder, bobbled the ball and both runners reached, Yde taking second and Brickell making it to first. Lloyd Waner&#x27;s sacrifice bunt moved them up. Barnhart&#x27;s single over second scored Yde and sent Brickell to third. Paul Waner&#x27;s sacrifice fly to center scored Brickell, tying the score at three apiece.

There was a new battery for the Pirates in the bottom of the seventh, Johnny Miljus and catcher Johnny Gooch. The score remained tied through the seventh, the eighth and the top of the ninth, bringing the Yanks up in their half of the ninth with a chance to win the game and the series. Miljus opened with a walk to Combs. Koenig beat out a bunt down the third base line for a single, bringing Ruth up. Miljus&#x27; wild pitch sent Combs to third and Koenig to second, and manager Bush ordered Miljus to walk Ruth, loading the bases for Gehrig, who struck out swinging
as did Meusel looking. Lazzeri fouled deep into the left field bleachers for strike one, but on the next pitch Miljus uncorked another wild pitch. Combs raced home with the winning run, and the Series was over with the Yankees winning 4–3. To date, this is the only World Series to end with a runner scoring on a wild pitch.

<text>Nude Records is an independent record label, established in August 1991 in London. The label was set up and operated by Saul Galpern, who had previously worked with artists such as Simply Red, The Fall, Julian Cope, The Triffids, The Slits and Au Pairs.

The label filed for voluntary liquidation in December 2001, before it was re-established by Galpern in 2016.

==History==
The label&#x27;s first success was with Suede, whose debut album, &quot;Suede&quot; (1993), debuted at the top of the UK Albums Chart, and was the fastest-selling debut album since Frankie Goes To Hollywood&#x27;s &quot;Welcome to the Pleasuredome&quot; almost ten years earlier. The band went on to win the Mercury Prize that year, and received five Brit Awards nominations. They had three No. 1 hit albums in the UK Albums Chart. Other artists with chart success signed to the label included the Scottish band Geneva, who had Top 20 success with their debut album &quot;Further&quot;; Black Box Recorder who also achieved a Top 20 hit single and album with &quot;The Facts of Life&quot; (2000); plus chart album hits for Ultrasound, Lowgold, and Billy Mackenzie.

The label had a UK distribution deal with 3mv/Vital (later Pinnacle distribution) and an international licensing arrangement with Sony, which ended in 2000, before moving to PIAS. Subsequently, the label hit financial difficulties in 2000. In December 2001, after the label lost its distribution deal with Sony, a new deal with Zomba fell through at the last minute. The collapse of the label led to delays with Black Box Recorder&#x27;s third album, &quot;Passionoia&quot;, which was not released until 2003. It was believed Suede would be unaffected by the closure of the label as Nude&#x27;s international partner label Sony would release their next album, &quot;A New Morning&quot;. The label returned briefly in 2005 via a deal with V2 which saw the release of the compilation album &quot;Future&#x27;s Burning&quot;. It featured songs from up-and-coming British bands such as Franz Ferdinand, Bloc Party, Kaiser Chiefs, The Libertines, Razorlight and others (although none of the artists had ever been signed to Nude). However, &quot;The Independent&quot; commented that it was &quot;easily surpassed by an hour on iTunes&quot; and the label was officially dissolved in July 2007.

In 2016, Saul Galpern re-established the label with a new marketing and distribution deal. The label went on to release albums by Malcolm Middleton and Lou Rhodes. Former Arab Strap member Middleton released &quot;Summer of &#x27;13&quot;, in May 2016. It was funded by a campaign on Pledge Music, and produced by Miaoux Miaoux and Lone Pigeon. Whilst in anticipation of her fourth album release, Rhodes released the singles &quot;All the Birds&quot; in April, and &quot;All I Need&quot; in June 2016. A month later, the album &quot;theyesandeye&quot; was released through Nude Records. It included a cover of the song &quot;Angels&quot; originally performed by The xx.

<text>The 1928 [[World Series]] was the championship series in Major League Baseball for the 1928 season. The 25th edition of the World Series, it matched the American League champion New York Yankees versus the National League champion St. Louis Cardinals. The Yankees beat the Cardinals in four games to win their third championship and become the first team to do back-to-back sweeps.

Babe Ruth hit .625 (10 for 16) as the Yankees outscored their opponents by a combined score of 27–10. As he had done against the Cards in the Series, Ruth hit three home runs over the right field pavilion in Sportsman&#x27;s Park in Game 4, the only player to do it in two different World Series through the 2016 season. Unlike 1926, however, it occurred in the final game of a Series won by the Yanks and finished off their two consecutive World Series sweeps.

Lou Gehrig also had a good Series, hitting .545 (6 for 11) with four home runs. He drove in as many runs by himself (9) as the entire Cardinal team combined.

Bill McKechnie became the second manager to lead two different teams to the World Series, and like Pat Moran before him, won one and lost one.

== Background ==
Before the series started, Walter Johnson, a retired Major League pitcher at the time, reportedly predicted that the Cardinals would &quot;make short work of the New York Yankees,&quot; and that the Yankees &quot;(hadn&#x27;t) looked good for a while.&quot; Both Cardinals and Yankees fans were looking forward to a rematch of the 1926 World Series, which the Cardinals won.

==Summary==
==Matchups==

===Game 1===
In a fashion similar to 1926, Bill Sherdel took the mound in Game 1 for the Cardinals.

Ruth doubled with 2 outs in the first inning. Gehrig followed with an RBI double. Ruth lashed another double in the fourth and scored ahead of Bob Meusel&#x27;s home run, one of only four hits off Sherdel in his seven innings. Consecutive singles by Mark Koenig, Ruth and Gehrig-for his second RBI-against Cards reliever Syl Johnson gave the Yankees the 4th run and a 1–0 series lead.

===Game 2===
The Cardinals produced 30 percent (3) of their runs in the Series in the second inning of game 2.

George Harper walked, Jimmie Wilson doubled, Rabbit Maranville singled, and Grover Cleveland Alexander reached on second baseman Tony Lazzeri&#x27;s errant throw. It tied the game at 3–3.

After that, George Pipgras allowed only two more Cardinal hits, walking 3 other St. Louis batters. Miller Huggins had helped him straighten out a delivery problem. Pipgras consistently struck out the Cardinals with his curveballs, and they didn&#x27;t score again.

New York went ahead 4–3 in the bottom of the second inning off Alexander, who did not do well after that. Ruth led off with a single. Gehrig, having homered earlier (in the first inning to give the Yankees a 3–0 lead), drew a walk, and Meusel drove in a run with a double.

A hit batsman and another run-scoring hit gave the Yankees a 4-run lead, and that was how it ended.

===Game 3===
The Redbirds, as the Cardinals were affectionately called by fans, led only 3 times the entire series and held an advantage in this game for 3 innings, the longest span in the series. They put up a 2–0 score in the 1st inning on singles by Andy High and Frankie Frisch, followed by a line drive that center fielder Cedric Durst couldn&#x27;t catch, giving Jim Bottomley a 2-run double.

The only other St. Louis run came in the 5th inning, when Taylor Douthit was hit by a pitch and scored to make it a 3–3 game on High&#x27;s double.

Where the Cardinals had to scrape together runs, the Yankees did not. Gehrig homered into the right-field pavilion. In the fourth inning, Ruth laced a single and Gehrig followed with a hard line drive that skipped over the head of charging fielder Douthit. The ball rolled to the fence, and Gehrig went around the bases for a two-run inside-the-park homer.

Ruth took to the bases again in the sixth inning when his grounder forced out Koenig. Gehrig then drew a walk. 3rd baseman High fielded Meusel&#x27;s bouncer and tried to start a double play. His throw got Gehrig at second, but Frisch&#x27;s relay went wild and rolled to the fence. As Bottomley scampered after the ball, Ruth rounded third base and headed for home. The throw beat him, and umpire Bill McGowan called him out, but the impact from Ruth&#x27;s hit in the collision jarred the ball loose from catcher Jimmie Wilson, and McGowan changed the call.

Later in the inning, Meusel scored on a double steal. The Yankees scored another run that inning to make it 6–3. Another run in the seventh was their last of the game, making it 7-3.

===Game 4===

After Game 3, Cardinals manager Bill McKechnie was still hopeful, despite losing 3 games in a row. &quot;It[sic] they can win three games, so can we. Nothing is impossible. And this thing isn&#x27;t over until the fourth game is won,&quot; he was quoted as saying.

The Cards led 2–1 in the top of the seventh. 21-game-winning southpaw Will Sherdel had an 0–2 count on Babe Ruth, who turned to say something to catcher Earl Smith. Seizing what he thought was a great opportunity to end the at-bat, Sherdel &quot;quick-pitched&quot;, or threw without a windup, for what he thought was strike three on the Babe. &quot;Quick pitches&quot; were legal in the National League, but not in the American League or the World Series. So NL plate umpire Cy Pfirman called &quot;no pitch&quot;, causing a vociferous argument with the Cardinals. Ruth then took two balls to even the count at 2–2 before homering to tie the game at two apiece. Gehrig&#x27;s ensuing back-to-back home run, his fourth of the Series, gave the Yanks a lead they never relinquished. They scored twice more in the seventh, and Ruth finished the inning off with his third homer of the game in the two-run Yankee eighth.

St. Louis scored a lone run in the bottom of the ninth to make it 7–3, but that was their last, as future Hall of Famer Frankie Frisch hit a left field foul fly caught on the run by none other than the Babe Ruth up against the stands, as angry Cardinal fans swatted him with newspapers and programs. But Ruth merely kept running right into the dugout, holding the ball in the air and giving the Yankees their second straight World Series sweep.

In 1930, Ruth called this game the biggest thrill of his career.

<text>The 1929 World Series featured the American League (AL) champion Philadelphia Athletics playing against the National League (NL) champion Chicago Cubs. The Athletics defeated the Cubs in five games to win the Series.

==Summary==
==Matchups==
===Game 1===
This was the first World Series game ever played at Wrigley Field.

Because seven of the eight regulars in the Cubs&#x27; lineup hit right-handed, Athletics manager Connie Mack started only right-handed pitchers during the series and kept all his left-handed pitchers in the bullpen, even though two of his best starters, Lefty Grove and Rube Walberg, were left-handed.

The Athletics&#x27; Howard Ehmke, who started his major league career in 1915, had been a good starting pitcher, but by 1929, he was suffering from a sore arm. Pitching only occasionally, he finished the regular season with a 7–2 record, a 3.29 earned run average, and 20 strikeouts in 54.2 innings. Meanwhile, the Athletics had a big lead in the AL standings. In August, Mack told Ehmke that he was going to be released after the season. Ehmke accepted the decision but said that he would like to pitch in a World Series game, having never done so before. In mid-September, with both league pennant races wrapped up, Mack had Ehmke leave the team and go on the road to scout the NL champion Cubs for the last few weeks of the season, telling him to be prepared to start game 1 of the World Series.

Mack kept the pitching decision a secret until the day of the game. The Athletics had plenty of good pitchers available, and players on both teams were surprised that Ehmke was starting. However, with his knowledge of the Cubs&#x27; batters and a rested arm, Ehmke pitched a complete game, winning 3–1 with no earned runs allowed and 13 strikeouts. The strikeout total broke the World Series record that had been set by Ed Walsh in 1906; Ehmke&#x27;s record then stood until it was broken by Carl Erskine in 1953. This ended up being the last win of Ehmke&#x27;s career and also became one of the most famous games in baseball history.

Attending the game was nine-year-old John Paul Stevens, who would grow up to become a Supreme Court Justice. A lifelong Cubs fan, Stevens later said, &quot;And that was my first game, a tragic game for a young boy to go and see in person!&quot;

===Game 2===
Behind the pitching of George Earnshaw and Grove, the Athletics won 9–3 and took a 2–0 lead in the series. Jimmie Foxx became the first player to homer in his first two World Series games. Al Simmons also homered and had four runs batted in.

===Game 3===

Game 3 was a pitchers&#x27; duel that featured many tense moments. Guy Bush won this game for the Cubs&#x27; only victory, holding the Athletics to one run despite allowing nine hits and two walks. Earnshaw started his second straight game for the Athletics and allowed only one earned run himself.

===Game 4===
Sticking to his right-handed-pitchers-only policy, Mack again made a risky move in Game 4 by starting 46-year-old Jack Quinn. Unlike Ehmke, however, Quinn was no challenge to the Cubs&#x27; hitters, who scored seven runs off him before Mack pulled him in the sixth inning.

Trailing 8–0, the Athletics then scored 10 runs in the bottom of the seventh inning and won the game. In the middle of the rally that became known as the &quot;Mack Attack&quot;, Cubs center fielder Hack Wilson lost Mule Haas&#x27;s fly ball in the sun, and Haas circled the bases for a three-run inside-the-park home run, bringing the Athletics to within a run at 8–7. This was the last inside-the-park home run in a World Series game until Game 1 of the 2015 World Series. The eight-run deficit overcome by the Athletics is still the largest in postseason history.

Art Nehf&#x27;s relief pitching appearance in this game was his last in the major leagues.

===Game 5===
Mack gave Ehmke his second start of the Series, but without the advantage of surprise, he was less effective, touched for two runs, and taken out in the fourth inning. The Athletics trailed 2–0 going into the bottom of the ninth. However, Haas tied the game up with a two-run homer. Then, after a double by Simmons and an intentional walk to Foxx, Bing Miller&#x27;s double scored Simmons to give the Athletics their first World Series championship in 16 years.

<text>The 1919 [[World Series]] was the championship series in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the 1919 season. The 16th edition of the World Series, it matched the American League champion Chicago White Sox against the National League champion Cincinnati Reds. Although most World Series have been of the best-of-seven format, the 1919 World Series was a best-of-nine series (along with , , and ). MLB decided to try the best-of-nine format partly to increase popularity of the sport and partly to generate more revenue.

The events of the 1919 World Series are often associated with the Black Sox Scandal, in which several members of the Chicago franchise conspired with gamblers, allegedly led by organized crime figure Arnold Rothstein, to throw the series. It was the last World Series to take place without a Commissioner of Baseball in place. In 1920, the various franchise owners installed Kenesaw Mountain Landis as the first &quot;Commissioner of Baseball&quot;.

In August 1921, despite being acquitted from criminal charges, eight players from the White Sox were banned from organized baseball for either fixing the series or having knowledge about the fix without alerting the league. Dickey Kerr, another player on the team who was not involved in the scandal, was later suspended after holding out for more pay, but was eventually reinstated.

==Teams==
===Chicago White Sox===
In 1919, the Chicago White Sox, who had won the World Series two years earlier, had the best record in the American League (AL). Most of the same players had defeated the New York Giants in the 1917 series, four games to two. They had fallen to sixth place in the American League in 1918, largely as a result of losing their best player, Shoeless Joe Jackson, and a few other teammates to World War I service. The team&#x27;s owner, Charles Comiskey, fired manager Pants Rowland after the season and replaced him with William &quot;Kid&quot; Gleason, who had played over twenty years in the majors but had never managed before. The 88–52 White Sox won the American League pennant again in 1919, by games over the Cleveland Indians (world champions the following year).
Jackson was the unquestioned star of the White Sox. The left fielder hit .351 that season, fourth in the league and in the AL&#x27;s top five in slugging percentage, RBI, total bases and base hits. He was not the only star in a lineup with hardly a weak spot, as former Philadelphia Athletics superstar leadoff hitter Eddie Collins, one of the greatest second basemen of all time, was still going strong in his early thirties, hitting .319 with a .400 on-base percentage. Right fielder Nemo Leibold hit .302 with 81 runs scored. First baseman Chick Gandil hit .290, third baseman Buck Weaver .296, and center fielder Oscar &quot;Hap&quot; Felsch hit .275 and tied Jackson for the team lead in home runs with only seven (as the dead-ball era was coming to a close). Even typical &quot;good field, no hit&quot; catcher Ray Schalk hit .282 that year, and shortstop Swede Risberg was not an automatic out with the .256 average and 38 RBI. Gleason&#x27;s bench contained two impressive hitters, outfielder Shano Collins and infielder Fred McMullin, both veterans of the 1917 series.

The 1919 pitching staff was led by a pair of aces and a very promising rookie. Knuckleballer Eddie Cicotte had become one of the AL&#x27;s best pitchers after turning 30 and discovering the &quot;shine ball;&quot; he had won 28 games for the 1917 champions, and after an off-year in 1918 had come back with a hefty 29–7, leading the league in wins and second in earned run average to Washington&#x27;s veteran &quot;Big Train&quot; Walter Johnson. Next came Claude &quot;Lefty&quot; Williams, at 23–11 and 2.64. Twenty-six-year-old rookie Dickey Kerr started only 17 games, but turned in a solid 13–7 and 2.88. Fourth in the rotation was Urban &quot;Red&quot; Faber, who had beaten the Giants three times in the 1917 series but had an off-year in 1919 at 11–9 and 3.83 in 20 starts. He was ill and unable to pitch in the 1919 series, limiting Gleason to three top-of-the-line starters for what could be nine games.

However, all was not well in the White Sox camp. Tension ran high between many of the players and Comiskey given his penny-pinching ways, memorialized in two urban legends: (1) that he told Gleason to shut down Cicotte in the last days of the regular season to prevent him from winning thirty games, a milestone which would have earned him a sizeable $10,000 bonus; (2) that many derided the White Sox as the &quot;Black Sox&quot; because Comiskey wouldn&#x27;t pay to have their uniforms laundered regularly, and they became blacker and blacker due to accumulated sweat, grime and dirt.

===Cincinnati Reds===
In contrast to the White Sox, the 1919 Cincinnati Reds were upstarts. They had finished no higher than third since 1900, and then only twice, before winning the National League (NL) pennant handily in 1919. Under new manager Pat Moran, best known as the leader of another bunch of unlikely newcomers to the World Series, the 1915 Philadelphia Phillies, the Reds finished nine games in front of the runner-up Giants at 96–44 and at least twenty games ahead of the other six, with the second highest NL won-lost percentage since 1910 at .686.
The Reds&#x27; greatest star was center fielder Edd Roush, who led the league in hitting at .321 and, like the White Sox&#x27;s Jackson, was in the top five of their respective leagues in most important hitting categories. Third baseman Heinie Groh was the other great hitter on the team at .310 with a .392 on-base percentage and 79 runs scored. Slick-fielding first baseman Jake Daubert, a two-time National League batting champion with Brooklyn earlier in the decade, also scored 79 runs and hit .276, while catcher Ivey Wingo hit .273. The rest of the team was unheralded, including second baseman Morrie Rath, a .264 hitter with no power but a good on-base percentage, and shortstop Larry Kopf, a .270 singles hitter. The corner outfielders were decidedly weaker hitters, with former Phillies star left fielder Sherry Magee&#x27;s .215 in 56 games and right fielder Earle &quot;Greasy&quot; Neale&#x27;s .242 with little power. This would prompt Moran to start rookie Pat Duncan in left field in the 1919 series.

The Reds&#x27; pitching was universally solid, however. The team&#x27;s big three included Hod Eller (20–9, 2.39), Dutch Ruether (19–6, 1.82) and Slim Sallee (21–7, 2.06), all among the league leaders in various categories. They were backed by three other pitchers who were almost as successful: Jimmy Ring at only 10–9 but 2.26, Ray Fisher at 14–5 and 2.17 with five shutouts, and Cuban Dolf Luque at 10–3 and 2.63, former and future Giant who would win the last game of the 1933 World Series in long relief for New York. It was a deep and talented staff, a definite advantage in a World Series whose format had just been changed from best-of-seven to best-of-nine.

==The fix==

The conspiring players on the White Sox got an unexpected assist when a flu-stricken Faber was left off the World Series roster. Indeed, years later, catcher Schalk said that had Faber been healthy, there never would have been a fix (since he almost certainly would have gotten starts that went to Cicotte or Williams). Despite their many wins on the field, the Sox were an unhappy team. Many observers blame their attitude on Comiskey&#x27;s stinginess, despite the fact that the 1919 White Sox payroll was third highest in the AL, behind only Boston and New York.

Stories about the scandal have usually included Comiskey in its gallery of subsidiary villains, focusing in particular on his intentions regarding a clause in Cicotte&#x27;s contract that would have paid the knuckleballer an additional $10,000 bonus for winning thirty games. According to Eliot Asinof&#x27;s account of the events, &quot;Eight Men Out&quot;, Cicotte was &quot;rested&quot; for the season&#x27;s final two weeks after reaching his 29th win presumably to deny him the bonus, but the truth may be more complex. Cicotte won his 29th game on September 19, had an ineffective start on September 24 and was pulled after a few innings in a tuneup on the season&#x27;s final day, September 28 (three days before the World Series opener). In addition, Cicotte reportedly agreed to the fix the same day he won his 29th game before he could have known of any efforts to deny him a chance to win his 30th. The story was probably true with regard to the 1917 season, however, when Cicotte won 28 games and hurled the White Sox to the championship.

Although rumors were swirling among gamblers (according to Tom Meany in his chapter on the 1919 Reds in &quot;Baseball&#x27;s Greatest Teams,&quot; &quot;Cincinnati money was pouring in&quot; even though the White Sox were regarded as the overwhelming favorite) and some of the press, most fans and observers were taking the Series at face value. On October 2, the day of Game 2, the &quot;Philadelphia Bulletin&quot; published a poem which would quickly prove to be ironic:
:Still, it really doesn&#x27;t matter,
:After all, who wins the flag.
:Good clean sport is what we&#x27;re after,
:And we aim to make our brag
:To each near or distant nation
:Whereon shines the sporting sun
:That of all our games gymnastic
:Base ball is the cleanest one!

==Summary==

==Matchups==
===Game 1===

The first game began at 3 pm at Cincinnati&#x27;s Redland Field, with 30,511 fans in the stands and ticket scalpers outside the park raking in at least $50 per ticket. Chicago failed to score in the top of the first. In the bottom of the inning, Cicotte (who was paid his $10,000 the night before the series began) took the mound and hit the leadoff hitter, Morrie Rath, in the back with his second pitch, a prearranged signal to Arnold Rothstein that the fix was on. Even so, the game remained close for a while, due in part to some excellent defense from the conspirators, seeking to deflect suspicion from themselves. In the fourth, however, Cicotte &quot;went haywire&quot; (again according to Meany, &quot;op. cit.&quot;), allowing a number of hits in succession climaxed by a two-out triple to the opposing pitcher, as the Reds scored five times to break a 1–1 tie. Cicotte was relieved at that point, but the damage was done and the Reds went on to add three more runs in later innings and win 9–1.

Sportswriters thought that a bad throw by Cicotte to Risberg in the fourth inning, which prevented a possible double play, was suspicious. By that evening, there already were signs that things were going wrong. Only Cicotte, who had shrewdly demanded his $10,000 in advance, had been paid. &quot;Sleepy&quot; Bill Burns and Maharg met with Abe Attell, the former world boxing champ and Rothstein&#x27;s intermediary, but he withheld the next installment ($20,000) nonetheless to bet on the next game. The next morning Gandil met Attell and again demanded money, but again to no avail.

===Game 2===
Although they had not received their money, the players were still willing to go through with the fix. &quot;Lefty&quot; Williams, the starting pitcher in Game 2, was not going to be as obvious as Cicotte. After a shaky start, he pitched well until the fourth inning, when he walked three and gave up as many runs. After that he became virtually unhittable again, giving up only one more run; but lack of clutch hitting, with Gandil a particularly guilty party, led to a 4–2 White Sox loss. Attell was still in no mood to pay up afterwards, but Burns managed to get hold of $10,000 and gave it to Gandil, who distributed it among the conspirators. The teams headed northwest to Comiskey Park in Chicago for Game 3 the next day, with no days off for travel in this Series.

===Game 3===
Rookie pitcher Dickey Kerr, the Game 3 starter for the Sox, was not in on the fix. The original plan was for the conspirators, who disliked Kerr, to lose this game, but by now dissent among the players meant that the plan was in disarray. Burns still had faith and gathered the last of his resources to bet on Cincinnati. It was a decision that would leave him broke, as Chicago scored early—with Gandil himself driving in two runs—and Kerr was masterful, holding the Reds to three hits in a 3–0 complete game shutout.

===Game 4===
Cicotte took the mound again for Game 4, and was determined not to look as bad as he had in Game 1. For the first four innings, he and Reds pitcher Jimmy Ring matched zeroes. With one out in the fifth, Cicotte fielded a slow roller by Pat Duncan but threw wildly to first for a two-base error. The next man up, Larry Kopf, singled to left; Cicotte cut off the throw from Jackson and fumbled the ball, allowing Duncan to score. The home crowd was stunned by the veteran pitcher&#x27;s obvious mistake. Cicotte then surrendered a double to Greasy Neale which scored Kopf to make it 2–0; this was enough of a lead for Ring, who hurled a three-hit shutout of his own, matching Kerr&#x27;s in Game 3. The Reds led the Series 3–1.

After the game &quot;Sport&quot; Sullivan came through with $20,000 for the players, which Gandil split equally among Risberg, Felsch, and Williams, who was due to start Game 5 the next day.

===Game 5===
Game 5 was postponed by rain for a day. Both starters, Williams and Cincinnati&#x27;s Hod Eller, pitched excellently at first, with neither allowing a runner past first until the top of the sixth, when Eller himself hit a blooper that fell between Felsch and Jackson. Felsch&#x27;s throw was offline, sending Eller all the way to third. Leadoff hitter Morrie Rath then singled over the drawn-in infield, scoring Eller. Heinie Groh walked before Edd Roush&#x27;s double—the result of more doubtful defense from Felsch—brought home two more runs, with Roush scoring shortly thereafter. Eller pitched well enough (he struck out nine batters, including a then-World Series record six in a row, since tied by Moe Drabowsky in the 1966 World Series opener) for the four runs to stand up, and the Reds were only one game away from their first world championship.

===Game 6===
The Series reverted to Cincinnati for Game 6. Dickey Kerr, starting for the White Sox, was less dominant than in Game 3. Aided by three White Sox errors, the Reds jumped out to a 4–0 lead before Chicago fought back, tying the game at 4-4 in the sixth, which remained the score into extra innings. In the top of the tenth, Gandil drove in Weaver to make it 5–4, and Kerr closed it out to record his — and Chicago&#x27;s — second win.

===Game 7===
Despite the rumors already circulating about Cicotte&#x27;s erratic performances in Games 1 and 4, White Sox manager Kid Gleason showed faith in his ace for Game 7. This time, the knuckleballer did not let him down. Chicago scored early and, for once, it was Cincinnati that committed errors. The Reds threatened only briefly in the sixth before losing 4–1, and suddenly the Series was relatively close again. This marked the only time in World Series history that the winner of Game 7 did not ultimately go on to win the series.

This did not go unnoticed by Sullivan and Rothstein, who were suddenly worried. Before the Series started, the Sox had been strong favorites and few doubted they could win two games in a row—presuming that they were &quot;trying&quot; to win. Rothstein had been too smart to bet on individual games, but had $270,000 riding on Cincinnati to win the Series. The night before Game 8, Williams—the scheduled starter—was supposedly visited by an associate of Sullivan&#x27;s known as Harry F who left no doubt that if he failed to blow the game in the first inning, he and his wife would be in serious danger.

To date, this is the only time the White Sox have ever played in a Game 7.

===Game 8===
Whatever Williams had been told made its impression. In the first, throwing nothing but mediocre fastballs, he gave up four straight one-out hits for three runs before Gleason relieved him with &quot;Big&quot; Bill James, who allowed one of Williams&#x27; baserunners to score. James continued ineffective and, although the Sox rallied in the eighth, the Reds came away with a 10–5 victory for a five-games-to-three Series win. Jackson hit the only homer of the Series in the third inning after the Reds had built a 5–0 lead. Immediately after the Series ended, rumors were rife from coast to coast that the games had been thrown. Journalist Hugh Fullerton of the &quot;Chicago Herald and Examiner&quot;, disgusted by the display of ineptitude with which the White Sox had &quot;thrown&quot; the series, wrote that no World Series should ever be played again.

==Composite line score==
1919 World Series (5–3): Cincinnati Reds (N.L.) over Chicago White Sox (A.L.)
==Notable performances==
Jackson led all players with his .375 average. Some believed that most of his offensive potency came in games that were not fixed and/or when the game seemed out of reach. He hit the Series&#x27; lone home run in the eighth and final game, a solo shot in the third inning, by which time the Reds were already ahead 5–0. His five hits with runners in scoring position came in: Game 6, sixth inning with Kerr pitching; Game 7, first and third innings; Game 8, two in the four-run eighth.

Shoeless Joe had 12 hits overall, a World Series record at that time.

<text>The 1930 World Series featured the defending World Series champion (and 1930 American League (AL) champion) Philadelphia Athletics against the National League (NL) champion St. Louis Cardinals. The Athletics defeated the Cardinals in six games, 4–2. Philadelphia&#x27;s pitching ace Lefty Grove, and George Earnshaw, the No. 2 man in Mack&#x27;s rotation, won two games apiece. Earnshaw also pitched seven scoreless innings as Game 5 starter, but ended up with a no-decision as Grove relieved him in the eighth and took the win on Jimmie Foxx&#x27;s two-run homer in the top of the ninth for the game&#x27;s only scoring.

The Cardinals led the National League in runs scored and averaged six runs per game in the regular season, but could manage only two runs per game in this World Series.

This was the Athletics&#x27; fifth World Series championship win (following , , and ), and their last in Philadelphia before moving to Kansas City in 1955 and then Oakland in 1968—where they have since won four more World Series titles (, , , and ). Their win this year tied them with the Boston Red Sox for most World Series wins as of that point (five) until , when the New York Yankees surged ahead of both in World Series wins and have gone on to amass 27 World Series championships as of 2025.

The city of Philadelphia would have to wait 50 years until its next World Series championship, when the Phillies defeated the Kansas City Royals and thus became the last of the &quot;Original Sixteen&quot; MLB franchises to accomplish the feat.

This World Series also marks the beginning of the Cardinals run of dominance in the National League in the early 1930s. They would win the pennant three times between 1930 and 1934 and the World Series in 1931 and &#x27;34.

This would also be the final World Series where both teams uniforms did not have numbers.

==Summary==
==Matchups==

===Game 1===
The A&#x27;s managed only five hits off of Grimes in Game 1, but all were for extra bases and each produced a run in five different innings. Al Simmons and Mickey Cochrane hit solo home runs for the A&#x27;s, helping Lefty Grove to a 5–2 win. The A&#x27;s struck first in the bottom of the second when Jimmie Foxx tripled and scored on Bing Miller&#x27;s sacrifice fly. The Cardinals loaded the bases in the third on three straight leadoff singles, then Taylor Douthit&#x27;s lineout and Sparky Adams&#x27;s sacrifice fly scored a run each. Simmons&#x27;s home run in the fourth tied the game. In the sixth, Max Bishop walked with one out and scored on Foxx&#x27;s double. Next inning, Mule Haas tripled with one out and scored on Joe Boley&#x27;s groundout. Cochrane&#x27;s eighth inning home run gave the A&#x27;s their last run of the game.

===Game 2===
George Earnshaw allowed six hits and walked one, putting the A&#x27;s ahead 2–0. The Athletics scored six runs in the first four innings to put the game out of reach. Mickey Cochrane&#x27;s two-out home run in the first gave the A&#x27;s their first run. After Al Simmons singled, Jimmie Foxx&#x27;s RBI double made it 2–0 A&#x27;s. George Watkins&#x27;s home run in the second gave the Cardinals their only run of the game. In the third, Cochrane reached on an error and scored on Simmons&#x27;s double. After an intentional walk, Bing Miller&#x27;s RBI single made it 4–1 A&#x27;s. Philadelphia added two more runs next inning on Jimmy Dykes&#x27;s double.

===Game 3===
After the A&#x27;s loaded the bases in the top of the first, Hallahan settled down and pitched a shutout. Philadelphia left a total of 11 men on base. The Cardinals scored the game&#x27;s first run on Taylor Douthit&#x27;s home run in the fourth, then next inning hit three consecutive one-out singles, the last of which by Charlie Gelbert scoring a run. In the seventh, Bill Shores allowed three consecutive leadoff singles, the last of which by Jimmie Wilson scoring two runs. Next inning, the Cardinals added another run off of Jack Quinn on back-to-back one-out doubles by Jim Bottomley and Chick Hafey.

===Game 4===
An error by Jimmy Dykes in the fourth inning allowed the Cardinals to score two runs. Haines did not allow a hit after the third inning. The A&#x27;s got on the board in the first on Al Simmons&#x27;s RBI single, but the Cardinals tied the game in the third when Charlie Gelbert tripled and scored on Jesse Haines&#x27;s single. In the fourth, Chick Hafey hit a two-out ground rule double and scored on Dykes&#x27;s error on Ray Blades&#x27;s ground ball. Blades then scored on Gelbert&#x27;s RBI single.

===Game 5===
George Earnshaw dueled Burleigh Grimes scoreless through seven innings before Lefty Grove took over for Earnshaw in the eighth. In the top of the ninth, Grimes walked Mickey Cochrane and then coughed up a home run ball to Jimmie Foxx. It must have been a patented Foxx blast, for Grimes said later, &quot;he hit it so hard I couldn&#x27;t feel sorry for myself.&quot;

===Game 6===

Earnshaw earned his second win on just one day of rest, pitching a five-hitter; it would be 88 years before another pitcher would start consecutive games in the postseason. Just like in Game 1, the A&#x27;s seven hits came in five different innings, leading to two runs in the first and fourth innings, and single runs in the third, fifth, and sixth innings. As in Game 1, all the A&#x27;s hits were extra-base hits, including home runs by Al Simmons and Jimmy Dykes.

Although the A&#x27;s hit only .197 (35–for–178) in the six game set, 18 of their hits went for extra bases, outscoring the Cardinals, 21–12. St. Louis only managed a .200 batting average in the series.

The A&#x27;s struck first in the first on RBI doubles by Mickey Cochrane and Bing Miller, both after walks. Simmon&#x27;s home run in the third off of Syl Johnson made it 3–0 A&#x27;s, then Dykes&#x27;s home run after a walk in the fourth increased their lead to 5–0. The A&#x27;s added to their lead next inning when Jimmie Foxx hit a leadoff double, moved to third on a bunt groundout and scored on Mule Haas&#x27;s sacrifice fly. the A&#x27;s scored their last run of the game in the sixth off of Jim Lindsey on Cochrane&#x27;s sacrifice fly. The Cardinals scored their only run of the game on Chick Hafey&#x27;s RBI double in the ninth.

<doc id="1332341" wikidata="Q2920737" url="?curid=1332341" title="Natural building">
<text>Natural building or ecological building is a discipline within the more comprehensive scope of green building, sustainable architecture as well as sustainable and ecological design that promotes the construction of buildings using sustainable processes and locally available natural materials. 

This in turn implies durability and the use of minimally processed, plentiful or renewable resources, as well as those that, while recycled or salvaged, produce healthy living environments and maintain indoor air quality. Natural building tends to rely on human labor, more than technology. As Michael G. Smith observes, it depends on &quot;local ecology, geology and climate; on the character of the particular building site, and on the needs and personalities of the builders and users.&quot;

The basis of natural building is the need to lessen the environmental impact of buildings and other supporting systems, without sacrificing comfort or health. To be more sustainable, natural building uses primarily abundantly available, renewable, reused or recycled materials. The use of rapidly renewable materials is increasingly a focus. In addition to relying on natural building materials, the emphasis on the architectural design is heightened. The orientation of a building, the utilization of local climate and site conditions, the emphasis on natural ventilation through design, fundamentally lessen operational costs and positively impact the environment. Building compactly and minimizing the ecological footprint is common, as are on-site handling of energy acquisition, on-site water capture, alternate sewage treatment and water reuse.

==Materials==
The materials common to many types of natural building are clay and sand. When mixed with water and, usually, straw or another fiber, the mixture may form &quot;cob&quot; or &quot;adobe&quot; (clay blocks). Other materials commonly used in natural building are: earth (as rammed earth or earth bag), wood (cordwood or timber frame/post-and-beam), straw, rice-hulls, bamboo and stone. A wide variety of reused or recycled materials are common in natural building, including urbanite (salvaged chunks of used concrete), vehicle windscreens and other recycled glass, which can be toxic in nature.

Other materials are avoided by practitioners of this building approach, due to their major negative environmental or health impacts. These include unsustainably harvested wood, toxic wood-preservatives, Portland cement-based mixes and derived products such as Autoclaved aerated concrete, paints and other coatings that off-gas volatile organic compounds (VOCs), steel, waste materials such as rubber tires in regions where they are recycled, and some plastics; particularly polyvinyl chloride (PVC or &quot;vinyl&quot;) and those containing harmful plasticizers or hormone-mimicking formulations.

== Earth techniques ==

=== Adobe ===

One of the oldest building methods, adobe is simply clay and sand mixed with water. Often, chopped straw or other fibers are added for strength. The mixture is then allowed to dry in the desired shape. Usually adobe is shaped into bricks that can be stacked to form walls.

Various claims are made about the optimal proportions of clay and sand (or larger aggregate). Some say that the best adobe soil contains 15% - 30% clay to bind the material together. Others say equal proportions of clay and sand are best to prevent cracking or fragmenting of the bricks. The blocks can either be poured into molds and dried, or pressed into blocks. Adobe colored with clay and polished with natural oil makes an attractive and resilient floor.

To protect the walls and reduce maintenance, adobe buildings usually have large overhanging eaves and sizeable foundations. Adobe can be plastered over with cob or lime-based mixes for both appearance and protection. Adobe has good thermal mass, meaning that it is slow to transmit heat or cold. It is not a good insulator, however, so insulation can be added (preferably on the outside), or a double wall built with airspace or insulation in between. The traditional thick, un-insulated adobe has proven to perform best in regions without harsh winters or where daily sun is predictably available during those cold periods.

=== Cob ===
 
The term &quot;cob&quot; is used to describe a monolithic building system based on a mixture of clay, sand, straw and earth. The construction uses no forms, bricks or wooden framework; it is built from the ground up. Various forms of &quot;mud&quot; building have been used in many parts of the world for centuries, under a variety of names, and date from at least 10,000 years ago. Cob building began use in England prior to the 13th century, and fell out of favor after World War I, although it is seeing a resurgence today. Cob is one of the simplest and least expensive building techniques available, though it is typically very labor-intensive. Cob&#x27;s other great advantage is versatility; It can easily be shaped into any form. While cob building was falling out of favor in England by the late 19th century, thousands of cob structures have endured to the present (20,000 in Devon, England alone). It is estimated that from one third to one half of the world&#x27;s population lives in earthen dwellings today. Although typically associated with &quot;low-rise&quot; structures, in Yemen and other Middle-Eastern countries it has, for centuries, been used in &quot;apartment&quot; buildings of eight stories and more.

=== Rammed earth ===

Rammed earth is a wall system made of compacted earth, or another material that is compacted. It is extremely strong and durable. Quality rammed earth walls are dense, solid, and stone-like with great environmental benefits and superior low maintenance characteristics. As an option depending on climate rigid insulation can be placed inside the wall. Similarly, depending on seismic concerns bamboo or other tensile natural materials can be used to reinforce the wall.

Rammed earth has been used for around 10,000 years in all types of buildings from low rise to high-rise and from small huts to palaces.

Rammed earth walls are formed in place by pounding damp sub-soil (containing sand, clay and sometimes gravel) into movable, reusable forms with manual or machine-powered tampers. In traditional rammed earth, a mixture of around 70% aggregate (gravel, sand) and 30% clay is optimal. Pigmentation may be added in the mix to achieve the desired color. Around 5-10 inches of mixed damp sub-soil are placed inside the forms and pounded to total compaction and the process is repeated until the desired height is achieved. What is left after the forms are removed is a wall that is structural and can last over 1000 years.

== Plant-based material techniques ==

===Timber frame===

The basic elements of timber-frame building—joined timbers, clay walls and thatch roofs were in place in Europe and Asia by the 9th century. It remained the common mode of house construction in northern cultures until the 19th century. Craftsmanship was, and is, an important value in timber-frame building. The oldest timber-frame structures (for example, the timber framed stave churches of Scandinavia) show both craftsmanship and a strong grasp of the technical aspects of structural design, as do such structures in Japan.

Timber framing typically uses a &quot;bent.&quot; A bent is a structural support, like a truss, consisting of two posts, a tie beam and two rafters. These are connected into a framework through joinery. To practice the craft, one must understand the basic structural aspects of the bent. This, along with a knowledge of joinery, are the basis of timber-frame building.

Timber framing is now a modern method of construction, Ideally suited to mass house building as well as public buildings. In conjunction with a number of natural insulations and timber cladding or modern lime renders, it is possible to quickly construct a high performance, sustainable building, using completely natural products. The benefits are many—the building performs better over its lifespan, waste is reduced (much can be re-cycled, composted or used as fuel). Timber-frame structures are frequently used in combination with other natural building techniques, such as cob, straw bale, or cordwood/masonry.

=== Bamboo ===

Bamboos are some of the fastest-growing plants in the world. Bamboo can be utilized as a building material for scaffolding, bridges, houses and buildings. Bamboo is a natural composite material with a high strength-to-weight ratio similar to timber, and its strength is generally similar to a strong softwood or hardwood timber. In its natural form, bamboo as a construction material is traditionally associated with the cultures of South Asia, East Asia, the South Pacific, Central and South America.

=== Straw bale ===

Although grasses and straw have been in use in a range of ways in building since pre-history around the world, their incorporation in machine-manufactured modular bales seems to date back to the early 20th century in the midwestern United States, particularly the sand-hills of Nebraska, where grass was plentiful and other building materials (even quality sods) were not. Straw bale building typically consists of stacking a series of rows of bales (often in running-bond) on a raised footing or foundation, with a moisture barrier between. Bale walls are often tied together with pins of bamboo or wood (internal to the bales or on their faces), or with surface wire meshes, and then stuccoed or plastered using either lime-based formulations or earth/clay renders. Bale buildings can either have a structural frame of other materials, with bales between (simply serving as insulation and stucco substrate), referred to as &quot;infill&quot;, or the bales may actually provide the support for openings and roof, referred to as &quot;load-bearing&quot; or &quot;Nebraska-style&quot;, or a combination of framing and load-bearing may be employed, referred to a &quot;hybrid&quot; straw bale.

Typically, bales created on farms with mobile machinery have been used (&quot;field-bales&quot;), but recently higher-density &quot;recompressed&quot; bales (or &quot;straw-blocks&quot;) are increasing the loads that may be supported; where field bales might support around 600 pounds per linear foot of wall, the high density bales bear up to 4,000 lb./lin.ft.

== Composite techniques ==

=== Earthbag ===
Earth is the most typical fill material used in bag-wall construction techniques. This building method utilizes stacked polypropylene or natural-fiber (burlap) bags filled with earth or other mixes without a stabilizer, other than clay, to form footings, foundations, walls and even vaulted or domed roofs. In recent years, building with earth bags has become one of the increasingly practiced techniques in natural building. It facilitates self-contained, often free-form rammed-earth structures. Its growing popularity relates to its use of an abundant and readily available often site-available material (earth) in a potentially inexpensive building technique that is flexible, and easy to learn and use. However, because earth is a poor insulator, in more extreme climates other filler variations are now being explored, substituting pumice, rice-hulls or another material with better insulating value for all or part of the earth (&quot;see also&quot; Rice-hull bagwall construction).

=== Hempcrete ===

Hempcrete or Hemplime is a composite building material, a mixture of the chopped woody stem of the hemp plant known as hemp hurds (shives) and a lime based binder to create a material that can be cast into molds. This forms a non-load-bearing &#x27;breathable&#x27; insulating material that can be used to form walls, floor slabs, ceilings and roof insulation. It is marketed under names like Hempcrete, Canobiote, Canosmose, and Isochanvre. Hempcrete is easier to work with than traditional lime mixes and acts as an insulator and moisture regulator. It lacks the brittleness of concrete and consequently does not need expansion joints. The result is a lightweight insulating material ideal for most climates as it combines insulation and thermal mass.

Like other plant products, hemp absorbs CO2 from the atmosphere as it grows, retaining the carbon and releasing the oxygen. Theoretically 165 kg of carbon can be absorbed and locked up by 1 m3 of hempcrete wall during manufacture. Furthermore, the carbonation of the lime during curing adds to this effect as lime turns to limestone.

The typical compressive strength is around 1 MPa, around 1/20 that of residential grade concrete. It is a low density material and resistant to crack under movement thus making it highly suitable for use in earthquake-prone areas. Hempcrete walls must be used together with a frame of another material that supports the vertical load in building construction, as hempcrete&#x27;s density is 15% that of traditional concrete.

=== Cordwood ===

Cordwood construction is a natural building method in which &quot;cordwood&quot; or short lengths of pieces of debarked tree are laid up crosswise with masonry or cob mixtures to build a wall. The cordwood, thus, becomes infill for the walls, usually between posts in a timber frame structure. Cordwood masonry can be combined with other methods (e.g., rammed earth, cob or light clay) to produce attractive combinations. Cordwood masonry construction provides a relatively high thermal mass, which helps to minimize fluctuations in temperature.

== Stone ==

Stone has been used as a building material for thousands of years. It has long been recognized as a material of great durability. The pyramids in Giza, burial chambers in the UK and temples in Malta were all built from stone over 4000 years ago and are still standing. The earliest form of stone construction is known as dry stone, or dry stacking. These are freestanding structures such as field walls, bridges and buildings that use irregularly shaped stones carefully selected and placed so that they fit closely together without slipping. Structures are typically wider at the base and taper in as height increases. They do not require any special tools, only the skill of the craftsman in choosing and placing the stones.

Traditional stone masonry evolved from dry stone stacking. Stone blocks are laid in rows of even (courses) or uneven (un-coursed) height, and fixed in place with lime mortar pasted between the stones. Traditional stone masonry is rarely used today because stone is expensive to quarry, cut and transport, and the building process is labor and skill-intensive.

Stone is a highly durable, low maintenance building material with high thermal mass. It is versatile, available in many shapes, sizes, colors and textures, and can be used for floors, walls, arches and roofs. Stone blends well with the natural landscape, and can easily be recycled for other building purposes.

<doc id="1332342" wikidata="Q4562895" url="?curid=1332342" title="1931 World Series">
<text>The 1931 [[World Series]] featured the two-time defending champion Philadelphia Athletics and the St. Louis Cardinals. The Cardinals beat the Athletics in seven games, a rematch and reversal of fortunes of the previous World Series.

The same two teams faced off during the 1930 World Series and the Athletics were victorious. The only day-to-day player in the Cardinals&#x27; lineup who was different in 1931 was the &quot;Wild Horse of the Osage&quot;, Pepper Martin—a 27-year-old rookie who had spent seven seasons in the minor leagues. He led his team for the Series in runs scored, hits, doubles, runs batted in and stolen bases, and also made a running catch to stifle a ninth-inning rally by the A&#x27;s in the final game.

The spitball pitch had been banned by Major League Baseball in 1920, but those still using it at that time were &quot;grandfathered&quot;, or permitted to keep throwing it for the balance of their big-league careers. One of those who &quot;wet his pill&quot; still active in 1931 was Burleigh Grimes, with two Series starts, two wins and seven innings of no-hit pitching in Game 3. &quot;Wild&quot; Bill Hallahan started and won the other two for the Cards, and saved Game 7.

The Athletics had captured their third straight American League pennant, winning 107 games (and 313 from 1929–31). But this would prove to be the final World Series for longtime A&#x27;s manager Connie Mack. As he did after the Boston &quot;Miracle Braves&quot; swept his heavily favored A&#x27;s in the Series, Mack would break up this great team by selling off his best players, this time out of perceived economic necessity rather than pique and competition from the short-lived Federal League. It would be the A&#x27;s last World Series appearance in Philadelphia and it would be 41 years—and two cities—later before the A&#x27;s would return to the Fall Classic, after their successive moves to Kansas City in 1955 and Oakland in 1968. This would also be the city of Philadelphia&#x27;s last appearance in the Series until 1950, and as of 2023 the only Series involving a Philadelphia team to last seven games. It was also the last World Series until the 2017 edition in which both teams who had won at least 100 games in the regular season went the maximum seven games.

This was the first World Series to feature a team with numbers on the back of the uniform (Philadelphia).

==Summary==
==Matchups==

===Game 1===
The A&#x27;s scored four runs in the third, enabling Lefty Grove to win Game 1 despite giving up 12 hits, three by Pepper Martin. The Cardinals struck first in the first inning on three consecutive one-out singles, the last of which to Jim Bottomley scoring a run. After a strikeout, Martin&#x27;s double scored another run. In the top of the third with runners on first and second, Mule Haas&#x27;s double scored Philadelphia&#x27;s first run. Two consecutive walks by Paul Derringer loaded the bases and tied the game, then Jimmie Foxx&#x27;s single scored two more runs. In the top of the seventh, Al Simmons&#x27;s two-run home run put Philadelphia up 6–2, the game&#x27;s final.

===Game 2===
Pepper Martin&#x27;s two hits and two stolen bases, scoring both Cardinal runs, supported Hallahan&#x27;s three-hit shutout. The Cardinals scored the game&#x27;s first run in the second when Pepper Martin doubled off George Earnshaw, stole third and scored on Jimmy Wilson&#x27;s sacrifice fly, and the game&#x27;s second run in the seventh when Martin hit a leadoff single, stole second, moved to third on a groundout and scored on Charlie Gelbert&#x27;s fielder&#x27;s choice.

===Game 3===
Grimes pitched a two-hitter and contributed a two-run single in the fourth. He had a shutout until Al Simmons hit a two-run homer with two outs in the ninth. St. Louis struck first in the second when with runners on first and third via a walk and single, Jimmie Wilson&#x27;s single and Charlie Gelbert&#x27;s lineout scored a run each. They added to their lead in the fourth off Lefty Grove on Burleigh Grimes&#x27;s two-run single with runners on second and third, and added another run in the ninth off Roy Mahaffey on Jim Bottomley&#x27;s double.

===Game 4===
George Earnshaw pitched a brilliant two-hit shutout, walking one and striking out eight. Simmons RBI double in the first inning after a walk and two groundouts was all Earnshaw needed. Philadelphia added to their lead in the sixth off Syl Johnson on Jimmie Foxx&#x27;s home run and Jimmy Dykes&#x27;s single after a Bing Miller double. Martin had both Cardinal hits.

===Game 5===
Martin was a thorn in the A&#x27;s side in the series, getting three hits and four RBI to lead St. Louis to a 5-1 victory. Through five games, Martin leads all regulars with a .667 (12-18) average. St. Louis struck first in the first on Pepper Martin&#x27;s sacrifice fly with runners on second and third. Martin&#x27;s home run after a double in the sixth made it 3–0 Cardinals. The A&#x27;s scored their only run in the seventh on Bing Miller&#x27;s groundout after two one-out singles. The Cardinals added to their lead in the eighth when George Watkins walked off Rube Walberg, stole second and scored on Martin&#x27;s single and in the ninth off Eddie Rommel on Charlie Gelbert&#x27;s single with two on.

===Game 6===
The Athletics broke a scoreless tie with four runs in the fifth, Grove winning his second game of the series with a five-hitter, tying the series. After an error and walk off Paul Derringer, Dib Williams&#x27;s RBI single scored the game&#x27;s first run. Two two-out walks loaded the bases and scored another run. Mickey Cochrane&#x27;s RBI single scored a run, then a walk to Al Simmons scored another. St. Louis scored their only run in the sixth when Jake Flowers doubled and scored on Frankie Frisch&#x27;s single. The A&#x27;s added to their lead in the seventh off Jim Lindsey. Max Bishop hit a leadoff single, moved to second on a bunt groundout, and scored on Al Simmons&#x27;s single. After a single and hit-by-pitch loaded the bases, a walk to Jimmy Dykes scored a run and an error scored two more.

===Game 7===
The Cardinals struck first in the first when with runners on second and third via two single and a bunt groundout, a wild pitch by George Earnshaw to Pepper Martin scored a run and a strike three wild pitch to Ernie Orsatti scored another. A two-run home run by George Watkins in the third gave the Cardinals a 4-0 lead, but the Athletics scored two in the ninth on Doc Cramer&#x27;s bases loaded two-run single, Hallahan getting the last out, saving the victory for Grimes. Despite going 0–for–6 in Games 6 and 7, Pepper Martin was the leading hitter of the series with a .500 (12–for–24) batting average.

<doc id="1332343" wikidata="Q5115397" url="?curid=1332343" title="Chuck Cecil">
<text>Charles Douglas Cecil (born November 8, 1964) is an American football coach and former player in the National Football League (NFL). He is a senior defensive assistant for the University of Arizona, his alma mater. He previously served as a defensive assistant for the Tennessee Titans and Los Angeles Rams. Cecil also spent two seasons (1999–2000) as a television analyst for University of Arizona football games. As a player, he was a Pro Bowl safety.

==Early life==
Born in Red Bluff, California, Cecil grew up in Hanford and La Mesa; he graduated from Helix High School in La Mesa, where he was a standout player on a defense which set a school record for fewest points allowed per game and won a state title. and as a senior, Cecil was considered too small to be a collegiate star and thus was not offered a scholarship out of high school.

==Playing career==
===College===
Cecil attended the University of Arizona, where he walked-on for the Wildcats. He proved the recruiters wrong by eventually earning consensus All-America and Pacific-10 Conference Defensive Player of the Year honors after his nine-interception senior season in 1987. He held the Pac-10 record for career interceptions, with 21 (Lamont Thompson later broke the mark with 24), and set the Wildcats&#x27; school single-game record (and tied the Pac-10 record) with four interceptions against Stanford in 1987.

In the 1986 rivalry game against fourth-ranked Arizona State Cecil returned an interception 105 yards for a Wildcats victory in Tucson. This play has been voted the greatest play in Wildcat football history.

Cecil was inducted into the Wildcats&#x27; Sports Hall of Fame in 1993 and into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2009.

===Professional===
Selected by the Green Bay Packers in the fourth round of the 1988 NFL draft (89th overall), Cecil was known for his thunderous tackling and aggressive style during his time as a safety for the Packers (1988–1992), Cardinals (1993), and Oilers (1995). He earned a trip to the Pro Bowl and garnered All-Madden status in 1992 when he recorded four interceptions and 102 tackles on the season. In 95 career games he totaled 400 tackles and 16 interceptions. During his years with the Packers, he earned the nickname &quot;Scud&quot; Cecil due to his hit-or-miss approach to tackling opponents. He often left his feet and led with his helmet, and much like the infamous missiles launched during the Gulf War – would occasionally miss completely or arrive late.

Cecil is regarded as among the most vicious hitters in National Football League history. He was featured on the cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; in 1993 (October 11 issue) with the question: &quot;Is Chuck Cecil Too Vicious for the NFL?&quot; Many photos taken of Cecil during games showed him with a bloodied nose.
Recurring concussions forced him into retirement.

==Coaching career==
In 2001, Cecil accepted a coaching position for the Tennessee Titans under Jeff Fisher, for whom he had played in his final season (when the team was the Houston Oilers). Cecil served as a defensive quality control assistant for three seasons. He was promoted in 2004, to work with the safeties and nickel backs. His responsibilities expanded in 2007 to cover all of the defensive backs.

On February 12, 2009, Cecil was named the Titans&#x27; defensive coordinator, replacing the departed Jim Schwartz, who had taken the position of head coach for the Detroit Lions.

On October 3, 2010, during a game against the Denver Broncos, Cecil gave NFL officials the middle-finger gesture in an attempt to protest a neutral zone infraction call against one of his players. Live close-up video of Cecil was being aired at the time, and the gesture was broadcast without editing. For his inappropriate action, he was fined $40,000 by the league.

On January 20, 2011, it was announced that Cecil would not be retained as the Titans&#x27; defensive coordinator. He was informed of this decision on January 18. The Titans ranked 26th in total yards allowed and 29th against the pass in the 2010 season.

On February 16, 2011, ESPN.com reported that Cecil would interview with the Pittsburgh Steelers to be their next secondary coach. He was to fill the void left by Ray Horton when he departed to become the defensive coordinator of the Arizona Cardinals. On February 13, 2012, he was hired as the St. Louis Rams defensive secondary coach.

===Return to college===
Cecil was hired as a special advisor on July 28, 2017, at his alma mater, the University of Arizona. Cecil became interim defensive coordinator for the first time on November 2, 2019, when Arizona parted ways with defensive coordinator Marcel Yates. On December 30, 2020, Cecil was to join Jedd Fisch&#x27;s coaching staff as safeties coach.

==Personal life==
Cecil is married to author, columnist and television producer, Carrie Gerlach Cecil. They have one daughter, Charli.

<doc id="1332346" wikidata="Q6147072" url="?curid=1332346" title="1932 World Series">
<text>The 1932 [[World Series]] was the championship series in Major League Baseball for the 1932 season. The 29th edition of the World Series, it matched the American League champion New York Yankees versus the National League champions Chicago Cubs. The Yankees won in a four-game sweep. By far it is mostly noteworthy for Babe Ruth&#x27;s &quot;called shot&quot; home run, in his 10th and last World Series. It was punctuated by fiery arguments between the two teams, heating up the atmosphere before the World Series even began. A record 13 future Hall of Famers played in this World Series, with three other future Hall of Famers also participating: umpire Bill Klem, Yankees manager Joe McCarthy, and Cubs manager Rogers Hornsby. It was also the first World Series in which both teams wore uniforms with numbers on the backs of the shirts.

==Summary==
==Matchups==

===Game 1===
The Cubs opened the scoring with two runs in the top of the first inning with three singles, two by Woody English and Riggs Stephenson scoring a run each, but in the bottom of the third inning Earle Combs drew a leadoff walk off Guy Bush, moved to second on a groundout, and scored on Babe Ruth&#x27;s single before a two-run home run by Lou Gehrig put the Yankees up 3–2. In the sixth inning, they loaded the bases on three walks with one out before a two-run single by Bill Dickey and RBI fielder&#x27;s choice by Ben Chapman knocked Bush out of the game. Burleigh Grimes in relief allowed two-out two-run single to Combs. The Cubs scored two in the seventh on Stephenson&#x27;s two-run single, but in the bottom half, after a walk and single, Tony Lazzeri&#x27;s RBI single, Chapman&#x27;s sacrifice fly, and Grimes&#x27;s wild pitch put the Yankees up 11–4. In the eighth, Gabby Hartnett hit a leadoff double and scored on Mark Koenig&#x27;s triple. Billy Herman&#x27;s groundout scored the Cubs&#x27; last run. The Yankees got one more run in the bottom half off Bob Smith when Combs doubled and scored on Joe Sewell&#x27;s single. Yankee starter Red Ruffing pitched a complete game, striking out 10 Cubs but walking six and giving up six runs, only three of which were earned.

===Game 2===
In Game 2, Chicago scored first in the top of the first on Riggs Stephenson&#x27;s sacrifice fly with runners on first and third off Lefty Gomez, but in the bottom half, after two leadoff walks, RBI singles by Lou Gehrig and Bill Dickey off Lon Warneke put the Yankees up 2–1. The Cubs tied the game in the third when Stephenson doubled with two outs and scored on Frank Demaree&#x27;s single, but in the bottom half, Ben Chapman&#x27;s two-run bases-loaded single put the Yankees ahead 4–2. They added another run in the fifth when Lou Gehrig hit a leadoff single, moved to second on a groundout and scored on Bill Dickey&#x27;s single. Both pitchers pitched a complete game. This was the last World Series game Babe Ruth ever played in Yankee Stadium, with a single in his last Fall Classic home at-bat.

===Game 3===

Roughly 50,000 Cubs fans showed up for Game 3, a very large crowd for the time made possible by the construction of temporary bleachers fronting Waveland and Sheffield Avenues. In a prelude of things to come, Ruth and Gehrig put on an impressive batting display in batting practice. Ruth launched nine balls into the outfield stands, while Gehrig hit seven. As reported in the first edition of &quot;A Day at the Park&quot;, by William Hartel, p. 82, Ruth said while batting: &quot;I&#x27;d play for half my salary if I could bat in this dump all the time!&quot;

Cub starter Charlie Root struggled in the opening frame. The first two Yankees reached base on a walk and error, and Babe Ruth followed with a home run into the right-center-field bleachers to put the Yanks up 3–0. The existing newsreel footage showed Gehrig giving Ruth a friendly swat on the buttocks as Ruth crossed the plate. Before their part of the first inning was over, the Yankees got two, two-out singles, but they failed to score any further runs in the inning. In the bottom half, Billy Herman drew a leadoff walk off George Pipgras and scored on Kiki Cuyler&#x27;s double.

Gehrig hit a home run in the top of the third to put the Yankees up 4–1. In the bottom half, Cuyler homered with one out, then after a single and forceout, Grimm&#x27;s RBI double cut the Yankees lead to 4–3. Next inning, Billy Jurges doubled to left after Ruth&#x27;s futile dive for the ball and scored on an error to tie the game.

In the top of the fifth, Ruth came up to bat and, after making a series of pointing gestures, eventually hit a home run to centerfield, giving the Yankees the lead and control of the rest of the World Series. The home run, deemed Babe Ruth&#x27;s called shot, has since become arguably the most iconic home run in baseball history. Many believe Ruth&#x27;s pointing gestures to have been his declaring he would hit a home run to a specific point in the stands, although evidence has suggested that he was actually pointing his finger tauntingly at the Cubs&#x27; dugout. 

Root would only throw one more pitch, which Gehrig hit for a back-to-back home run, putting the Yankees up 6–4 and knocking Root out of the game. The Yankees got another run in the ninth aided by two errors on Champman&#x27;s double off Jakie May. Though Gabby Hartnett hit a leadoff home run in the bottom half and Billy Jurges singled off Pipgras, Herb Pennock retired the next three batters to end the game and leave the Yankees one win away from the championship.

===Game 4===
The Yankees loaded the bases in the top of the first on two singles and a hit-by-pitch, but scored just once on Lou Gehrig&#x27;s sacrifice fly. A walk loaded the bases, but Lon Warneke in relief of Guy Bush retired the next two batters to end the inning. In the bottom half, after two singles, Frank Demaree&#x27;s three-run home run off Johnny Allen put the Cubs atop 3–1. After an error and single, Billy Jurges&#x27;s RBI single knocked Allen out of the game. Wilcy Moore relieved him and put the fire out, giving up only one additional run in innings. Tony Lazzeri&#x27;s two-out two-run home run in the third cut the Cubs&#x27; lead to 4–3. The Yankees took the lead in the sixth on a two-run single by Gehrig off Jakie May, but in the bottom half, two errors allowed the Cubs to tie the game. In the seventh, after loading the bases, three straight hits by Earle Combs, Joe Sewell and the Babe, the last World Series hits for Sewell and Ruth, put the Yankees up for good, 9–5. A hit-by-pitch reloaded the bases, but Bud Tinning retired two to end the inning. The Yankees blew the game open in the ninth off Burleigh Grimes, starting with a leadoff home run by Earle Combs, then after two outs, Gehrig walked before Lazzeri&#x27;s second home run of the game made it 12–5 Yankees. They scored one more run when Bill Dickey singled and scored on Ben Chapman&#x27;s double. In the bottom half, Herb Pennock allowed a leadoff single to Billy Herman who stole second and third on defensive indifferences and scored on Woody English&#x27;s groundout before Pennock retired the next two hitters to end the series.

The Yankees had won their fourth World Series, and their 12th consecutive Series game. It was the last Series for Yankee mainstays Ruth, Combs and Pennock.

The Cubs extended their World Series victory drought to 24 years with their humiliating loss, their fourth consecutive in the Fall Classic after 1910, 1918 and 1929 (to the A&#x27;s, Red Sox and A&#x27;s again respectively). The Cubs&#x27; drought would end up lasting 108 years, having been finally ended when the Cubs defeated the Cleveland Indians in seven games to win the 2016 World Series.

Despite Ruth heroics, Gehrig was the real hero of the series batting .529 (he collected 9 hits out of 17 times at bat) with 8 RBIs and 3 home runs.

==The arguments==
Bench jockeying, called &quot;trash talk&quot; nowadays, was standard procedure in baseball then as now. No verbal punches were ever pulled, but the jockeying was supposedly taken to new heights (or depths) in this Series stemming from Yankee disrespect for the way the Cubs treated their former teammate, shortstop Mark Koenig, after his acquisition from the Detroit Tigers&#x27; Triple-A Mission Reds of the Pacific Coast League on April 25, 1932. Despite Koenig&#x27;s regular-season contributions (hitting .353 and fielding well), his stingy Cub teammates voted him only half a player&#x27;s postseason share before the start of the Series because he had only played in 33 games and was unable to play in the Series due to injury. When some of Koenig&#x27;s Yankee friends got wind of this, they dissed the Cubs as &quot;cheapskates&quot; in the press, &quot;tight&quot; with their Series money.

Ruth infuriated the Cubs the most when he called them cheapskates. Adding spice to the verbal stew was that Yankee manager Joe McCarthy had been fired by the Cubs a year or two after leading them to the 1929 NL pennant. When the Series started in New York, the Cubs retaliated by calling the Babe &quot;fat&quot; and &quot;washed up&quot; along with every obscenity they could think of. Guy Bush, Cub starter in Game 1, led the verbal attack on Ruth, calling him &quot;nigger&quot; (a common bench-jockey slam against the Babe for his broad nose and thick lips despite his German origin), and banter like this went on for most of the Series.

==The &quot;called shot&quot;==

Babe Ruth&#x27;s called shot refers to the home run he hit in the fifth inning of Game 3. Existing film shows Ruth made a pointing gesture during this at-bat, but what this signified is ambiguous. Though neither fully confirmed nor refuted, the story goes that Ruth pointed to the center field bleachers, supposedly predicting he would hit a home run there. On the next pitch, he hit what was estimated as a nearly 500&#x27; &quot;Ruthian&quot; homer to deep center past the flagpole and into the temporary seating in the streets. A few reporters later wrote that Ruth had &quot;called his shot&quot; (like a pool shark), and thus the legend was born. Ruth, ever aware of his larger-than-life public image, was quick to confirm the story once he got wind of it. Conflicting testimony and inconclusive film footage have placed that moment high up in the realm of baseball legend.

<text>The 1933 World Series was the championship series of the 1933 Major League Baseball season. The 30th edition of the World Series, it matched the National League (NL) pennant winner New York Giants and the American League (AL) pennant winner Washington Senators. The Giants defeated the Senators in five games for their first championship since and their fourth overall. Key to the Giants&#x27; World Series triumph was the pitching of aces &quot;King&quot; Carl Hubbell and &quot;Prince&quot; Hal Schumacher.

This would be the last World Series played in Washington, D.C., until . The Giants next won the World Series in , their final title in New York City as the franchise moved to San Francisco after the season.

==Background==

New York Giants majority owner John McGraw retired as manager in 1932 after 30 years at the helm, naming his protégé, young star first baseman Bill Terry, recently the last .400 hitter in the National League, as his player-manager successor. Somewhat similarly, former superstar hurler Walter Johnson also retired in 1932 as Washington Senators manager in favor of young star shortstop Joe Cronin as their new player-manager. (McGraw watched the Series from the stands, and died four months later.)

The Senators were the surprise team of 1933, breaking a seven-year monopoly on the AL title jointly held by the New York Yankees and Philadelphia Athletics from 1926 to 1932. But this could also be called a joint 13-year monopoly by all three, since the Senators had also won in 1924 and 1925 and the Yankees won from 1921 to 1923. 43-year-old future Hall of Famer Sam Rice, in his last year with the Senators, had only one at bat during the series, picking up a pinch hit single in the second game.

==Summary==
==Matchups==

===Game 1===

Mel Ott had four hits and three RBI in Game 1, hitting a two-run home run in the first and RBI single in the third with two on, all off of Lefty Stewart. Travis Jackson scored the Giants&#x27; last run on a groundout off of Jack Russell. Carl Hubbell struck out ten, allowed two unearned runs (on groundouts by Joe Cronin in the fourth with two on and Joe Kuhel with the bases loaded in the ninth) and pitched a five-hitter.

===Game 2===

The Giants overcame a 1–0 deficit (as a result of Goose Goslin&#x27;s third inning home run) with a six-run sixth inning. They loaded the bases with no outs on a single, double and intentional walk off of General Crowder before Lefty O&#x27;Doul hit a pinch-hit single that scored two runs. RBI singles by Travis Jackson, Gus Mancuso, Hal Schumacher and Jo-Jo Moore each scored a run. Hal Schumacher pitched a five-hitter for a 6–1 victory, giving New York a 2–0 lead.

===Game 3===

The Senators scored two runs in the first inning on Joe Cronin&#x27;s RBI groundout with runners on second and third followed by Fred Schulte&#x27;s RBI double. Next inning, Ossie Bluege hit a leadoff double and scored on Buddy Myer&#x27;s double. They got one more run in the seventh when Luke Sewell singled, stole second, moved to third on a groundout and scored on Myer&#x27;s double. Earl Whitehill held New York to five hits in the shutout. To date, this is the last World Series game in which a Washington team won at home.

===Game 4===

Carl Hubbell went all eleven innings in the 2–1 win. He induced Cliff Bolton to ground out into a bases-loaded, game ending double play. Bill Terry&#x27;s home run off of Monte Weaver put the Giants up 1–0 in the fourth, but the Senators tied the score in the seventh when Joe Kuhel reached on an error, moved to second on a sacrifice bunt and scored on Luke Sewell&#x27;s single. Travis Jackson singled to lead off the 11th, moved to second on a sacrifice bunt, and scored the game winning run on Blondy Ryan&#x27;s single.

===Game 5===
In the second, Hal Schumacher&#x27;s two-run single with runners on second and third put the Giants up 2–0 off of General Crowder. Kiddo Davis hit a leadoff double in the sixth and scored on Gus Mancuso&#x27;s double to extend the lead to 3–0. Fred Schulte hit a game-tying three run homer in the sixth after two, two-out singles. for the Senators. Mel Ott&#x27;s second home run of the series in the tenth off of Jack Russell won the Series for New York. Dolf Luque earned the win with 4 shutout innings of relief for Schumacher.

==Composite line score==
1933 World Series (4–1): New York Giants (N.L.) beat Washington Senators (A.L.)

At the time, the winning margin of five runs was second-lowest for a five-game series (later equaled in 1942 and 1974); the 1915 margin was two runs, and three runs in 2000.

==Aftermath==
Until winning the National League pennant in 2019, Washington, D.C., had not hosted another World Series game since 1933. In 2012, the Washington Nationals, formerly the Montreal Expos, brought postseason play back to Washington for the first time in 79 years but lost the National League Division Series (NLDS) after being one strike away from eliminating the St. Louis Cardinals after their early 6–0 lead had evaporated. In 2019, the Nationals won their first postseason series since their move—the Wild Card Game, NLDS, and NLCS—as their October stints in 2014, 2016, and 2017 had all ended in NLDS losses. (While in Montreal, the franchise made only one postseason appearance, winning the 1981 NLDS that was created due to that season&#x27;s players&#x27; strike, then losing the 1981 NLCS.) The 2019 Nationals went on to win the World Series, which ended a 95-year championship drought for the city, dating back to the Senators&#x27; win in .

This first Washington Senators franchise became the Minnesota Twins during the 1960–61 offseason, and would not reach the World Series again until as the Twins—since then, they have won two World Series, in and . The second Washington Senators, inaugurated in 1961 to replace the first edition on its way to Minnesota, became the Texas Rangers in 1972, who were also defeated four games to one in their first World Series ever by the now San Francisco Giants in 2010, with both Series 77 years apart starting in the Giants&#x27; home park and the Giants losing only Game 3 on the road in each. The Rangers were then defeated again in by the St. Louis Cardinals, when they had two chances to win in Game 6 when they came within one strike of winning. On their third attempt in , they defeated the Arizona Diamondbacks, four games to one.

<text>The 1935 [[World Series]] was the championship series in Major League Baseball for the 1935 season. The 32nd edition of the World Series, it matched the Detroit Tigers and the Chicago Cubs. The Tigers won in six games for their first championship in five Series appearances, as they had lost in , , , and . This was the first championship ever won by a Detroit-based team.

The Tigers won despite losing the services of first baseman Hank Greenberg. In Game 2, Greenberg collided with Cubs catcher Gabby Hartnett and broke his wrist, sidelining him for the rest of the Series.

The Cubs had won 21 consecutive games in September (still a record ), eventually taking the National League pennant by four games over the defending World Series champions, the St. Louis Cardinals.

In Game 6, Tommy Bridges pitched a complete-game victory to win the Series for Detroit. With the score tied 3–3 in the top of the ninth inning, Bridges gave up a leadoff triple to Stan Hack, but retired the next three batters without the runner on third scoring. In the bottom of the ninth, Goose Goslin drove in the winning run with two outs. After the game, manager Mickey Cochrane said the following of Bridges&#x27; gutsy performance: &quot;A hundred and fifty pounds of courage. If there ever is a payoff on courage this little 150-pound pitcher is the greatest World Series hero.&quot;

In addition to Bridges, the Tigers had a hitting hero. Right fielder Pete Fox accumulated ten hits and an average of .385 for the Series. Fox hit safely in all six games.

Detroit owner Frank Navin, then 64 years old, had been running the organization for 30 years and had seen four of his teams win American League pennants, only to lose four World Series. Six weeks after the Tigers finally won the World Series in October 1935, Navin suffered a heart attack while riding a horse and died.

==Summary==
==Matchups==

===Game 1===
A pitching duel between Lon Warneke and Schoolboy Rowe, both of whom went the distance, was decided by its leadoff batter, Augie Galan, doubling, and scoring on an error by Rowe that allowed Billy Herman to reach and eventually score on a Gabby Hartnett single. Frank Demaree added a homer in the ninth inning for the visiting Cubs.

===Game 2===
In the bottom of the first, Jo-Jo White hit a leadoff single and scored on a double by Mickey Cochrane, who scored on Charlie Gehringer&#x27;s single before Hank Greenberg&#x27;s two-run home run knocked Cubs&#x27; starter Charlie Root out of the game. In the fourth, Roy Henshaw got two outs before letting the Tigers load the bases on a single, hit-by-pitch and walk. A wild pitch scored a run, then after a walk reloaded the bases, Gehringer&#x27;s two-run single made it 7–0 Tigers. The Cubs got on the board in the fifth when Phil Cavarretta reached first on an error, moved to second on a groundout and scored on Billy Jurges&#x27;s single. The Cubs got two more runs in the seventh on Billy Herman&#x27;s single with runners on second and third, but the Tigers added a run in the bottom half on Pete Fox&#x27;s RBI single off of Fabian Kowalik. Tommy Bridges pitched a complete game as the Tigers&#x27; 8–3 tied the series heading to Chicago.

===Game 3===
In Game 3, Frank Demaree&#x27;s leadoff home run in the second off of Elden Auker put Chicago on the board. A one-out single and subsequent error put runners on first and third before Bill Lee&#x27;s ground out made it 2–0 Cubs. They added a run in the fifth when Billy Jurges drew a leadoff walk, moved to second on a sacrifice bunt and scored on Augie Galan&#x27;s single. The Tigers got on the board in the sixth when Goose Goslin singled off of Lee and scored on Pete Fox&#x27;s triple. In the eighth, after a walk and double, Goslin&#x27;s two-run single tied the game and knocked Lee out. Reliever Lon Warneke allowed two singles, the second of which to Billy Rogell scoring a run, then Fox stole home to make it 5–3 Tigers. Detroit brought back Game 1 starter Schoolboy Rowe in relief. He allowed three straight one-out singles in the ninth, the last of which to Ken O&#x27;Dea, before Augie Galan&#x27;s sacrifice fly sent the game into extra innings, but Rowe nailed down the victory after Jo-Jo White&#x27;s RBI single scored the winning run off of Larry French in the 11th. This game remarkably featured four ejections, two from each team. The Tigers lost Woody English and coach Del Baker. The Cubs lost Tuck Stainback and manager Charlie Grimm. Neither English nor Stainback were in the game.

===Game 4===
Alvin &quot;General&quot; Crowder did it all for Detroit, pitching a complete-game five-hitter, allowing only one run on Gabby Hartnett&#x27;s home run in the second, singling in the third and scoring his team&#x27;s first run on Charlie Gehringer&#x27;s RBI double, and getting Flea Clifton home as the go-ahead run with a groundout in the sixth off of Tex Carleton aided by two errors. Chicago threatened against Crowder with a pair of one-out hits in the ninth, but Stan Hack grounded into a game-ending 6-4-3 double play.

===Game 5===
Staving off elimination, the Cubs got a two-run home run from Chuck Klein after a leadoff triple in the second. They added another run in the seventh on Billy Herman&#x27;s RBI double off of Schoolboy Rowe. They replaced Lon Warneke after six innings with right-hander Bill Lee, who gave up Detroit&#x27;s only run in the ninth on three consecutive singles (the last of which to Pete Fox before settling down to retire the final three batters.

This was the first of three World Series games that the Cubs have won in Wrigley Field (where they had previously lost 6 Series games). The other wins were Game 6 in 1945, and Game 5 in 2016.

===Game 6===
In Game 6, Pete Fox&#x27;s RBI double off of Larry French put the Tigers on the board. Billy Herman&#x27;s RBI single tied the game in the third off of Tommy Bridges, who put the Tigers back in front in the fourth with an RBI groundout with two on, but Herman&#x27;s two-run home run in the fifth put the Cubs ahead 3–2. The Tigers tied the game in the sixth when Billy Rogell doubled with two outs and scored on Marv Owen&#x27;s single. In the ninth, Mickey Cochrane singled and moved to second on a groundout before Goose Goslin&#x27;s walk-off single won it in front of Detroit&#x27;s home fans, pitcher Tommy Bridges getting his second win of the Series. Stan Hack tripled to lead off the top of the 9th for the Cubs, but was left stranded at third.

==Composite line score==
1935 World Series (4–2): Detroit Tigers (A.L.) over Chicago Cubs (N.L.)
==Detroit: &quot;City of Champions&quot;==

When the Detroit Tigers won the 1935 World Series, the city of Detroit was mired in the Great Depression, which had hit the city and its industries particularly hard. However, with the success of the Tigers and other Detroit teams and athletes in 1935/36, Detroit&#x27;s luck appeared to be changing, as the city was dubbed the &quot;City of Champions.&quot; The Lions continued Detroit&#x27;s winning ways by capturing the 1935 NFL Championship Game, followed by the Detroit Red Wings winning the 1935–36 Stanley Cup championship. With the Stanley Cup win, the city had seen three major league championships in less than a year. Detroit&#x27;s &quot;champions&quot; included Detroit&#x27;s &quot;Brown Bomber&quot;, Joe Louis, the heavyweight boxing champion who won that title in 1937; native Detroiter Gar Wood who was the champion of unlimited powerboat racing and the first man to go 100 miles per hour on water; and Eddie &quot;the Midnight Express&quot; Tolan, a black Detroiter who won gold medals in the 100- and 200-meter races at the 1932 Summer Olympics.

They loaded the bases with no outs in the first off Hal Schumacher on two singles and a walk before sacrifice flies by Lou Gehrig and Bill Dickey put them up 2–0. Two walks and a wild pitch by Lefty Gomez in the second inning allowed the Giants to cut the lead to 2–1, but the Yankees blew the game open in the third inning. A single, walk and error loaded the bases with no outs. Al Smith relieved Schumacher and allowed a two-run single to Gehrig and RBI single to Dickey. A one-out walk reloaded the bases before Tony Lazzeri&#x27;s grand slam off Dick Coffman made it 9–1 Yankees. The Giants scored their last three runs in the fourth inning on a bases loaded walk to Dick Bartell followed by a two-run single by Bill Terry. The Yankees added a run in the sixth on Joe DiMaggio&#x27;s sacrifice fly with two on off Frank Gabler, then loaded the bases in the seventh on a walk and two singles before Lazzeri&#x27;s flyout and Gomez&#x27;s groundout scored a run each. In the ninth, Jake Powell drew a leadoff walk off Harry Gumbert, stole second, moved to third on a groundout, and scored on Gomez&#x27;s single. After another single, back-to-back RBI singles by Red Rolfe and DiMaggio made it 15–4 Yankees. One out later, Dickey&#x27;s three-run home run capped the scoring.

DiMaggio made a tremendous play in Game 2. With two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning, Hank Leiber drove the ball deep into dead center, and Joe caught the ball running up the steps of the clubhouse. This remarkable catch was at least further than Willie Mays&#x27; far more celebrated catch of Vic Wertz&#x27;s drive to deep straightaway center in Game 1 of the 1954 World Series. After DiMaggio&#x27;s game-ending grab, President Roosevelt, who was in attendance, saluted Joe for his great catch as he rode off in the presidential limousine. All three ninth-inning outs were made by DiMaggio.

Yankee second baseman Tony Lazzeri became only the second player ever to hit a grand slam home run in the World Series. Elmer Smith of the Cleveland Indians had been the sole achiever of that feat in World Series play, doing so in Game 5 of the 1920 World Series.

After seeing the score of this game, legendary Dodgers broadcaster Vin Scully (then 9 years old) became a Giants fan as he felt bad for the losing side. He credited this game as the game that made him fall in love with the game of baseball.

===Game 3===
Hard luck-loser Freddie Fitzsimmons allowed only two hits over seven innings, one of them a tremendous home run by Gehrig in the second inning, but after the Giants tied the game in the fifth inning on Jimmy Ripple&#x27;s home run off Bump Hadley, Frankie Crosetti&#x27;s single with the count 0–2 and two outs scored Jake Powell with the decisive run in the eighth inning. Pat Malone pitched a scoreless ninth for the save.

===Game 4===
The Yankees struck first in the second when Jake Powell reached on an error and scored on George Selkirk&#x27;s single off Carl Hubbell. Next inning, Frank Crosetti hit a leadoff double and scored on Red Rolfe&#x27;s single, then Lou Gehrig&#x27;s two-run home run gave the Yankees a 4–0 lead. Jimmy Ripple&#x27;s RBI single in the fourth off Monte Pearson put the Giants on the board. Bill Terry&#x27;s groundout with runners on first and third in the eighth cut the Yankees&#x27; lead to two, but they got that run back in the bottom half when Gehrig hit a leadoff double off Frank Gabler and scored on Powell&#x27;s single. Pearson won his first World Series game (he won three more, in 1937, 1938, and 1939).

===Game 5===
The Giants struck first with back-to-back leadoff doubles by Jo-Jo Moore and Dick Bartell off Red Ruffing. RBI singles by Jimmy Ripple and Burgess Whitehead made it 3–0 Giants. George Selkirk&#x27;s home run off Hal Schumacher in the second put the Yankees on the board. Next inning, with runners on second and third, an error on Frank Crosetti&#x27;s groundball allowed another run to score. A similar situation in the sixth on Burgess Whitehead&#x27;s groundball allowed the Giants to pad their lead to 4–2, but in the bottom half, three consecutive two-out singles allowed the Yankees to tie the game. Bill Terry&#x27;s sacrifice fly in the top of the tenth inning off Pat Malone, scoring Jo-Jo Moore, who doubled to leadoff and moved to third on a sacrifice bunt, helped the Giants win Game 5, 5–4, to extend the series to a Game Six.

===Game 6===
The Giants loaded the bases in the first off Lefty Gomez on a single and two walks before Mel Ott drove in two with a double, but Jake Powell&#x27;s home-run after a two-out triple off Freddie Fitzsimmons tied the game in the second. Next inning, Lou Gehrig&#x27;s sacrifice fly after two one-out singles put the Yankees up 3–2. They extended their lead to 5–2 in the fourth on four singles, two of which (by Gomez and Red Rolfe) scored a run each. Ott&#x27;s home run in the fifth cut the lead to 5–3, then in the seventh, Dick Bartell hit a leadoff double and scored on Bill Terry&#x27;s single to make it a one-run game. Tony Lazzeri&#x27;s RBI single in the eighth off Slick Castleman made it 6–4 Yankees, but the Giants again cut the lead to one on Jo-Jo Moore&#x27;s home run in the bottom half off Johnny Murphy. The Yankees, though, blew it open in the ninth. After two leadoff singles off Dick Coffman, an error on Bill Dickey&#x27;s fielder&#x27;s choice allowed one run to score. A walk loaded the bases before Powell drove in two more runs for the Yankees with a single. Harry Gumbert relieved Coffman and after a walk loaded the bases, Murphy&#x27;s single, Crosetti&#x27;s walk, Rolfe&#x27;s groundout, and Joe DiMaggio&#x27;s single scored a run each to make it 13–5 Yankees. It was the first time in history that a team would score seven runs in the 9th inning of a postseason game. No team has surpassed this mark, although five have tied it (the next one to occur after this one took place 34 years later). Murphy retired the Giants in order in the bottom of the ninth to give the Yankees the championship.

==Composite line score==
1936 World Series (4–2): New York Yankees (A.L.) over New York Giants (N.L.)
==Aftermath==
The Yankees&#x27; fifth championship tied the record at that time, which was shared by the Boston Red Sox and the Philadelphia Athletics, who also had five World Series titles. The Yankees also tied the American League record at that time for the most World Series appearances with eight, also shared with the Athletics. They broke both records the following year. The Giants appeared in their 11th World Series, extending the record they already held at that time, and their seventh World Series defeat also extended the record they already owned.

DiMaggio would go on to be the only person to play on four World Championship teams in his first four years in the big leagues, the 1936–39 Yankees.

The Yankee left fielder Jake Powell started the year with the Washington Senators before coming over in the middle of the year in a trade for Ben Chapman. In this Series, the unheralded Powell would lead all hitters in hits (10), batting average (.455), runs (8) and walks (4), add a home run with five runs batted in, and grab the Yankees&#x27; only stolen base. However, it proved to be a fleeting moment of fame for the troubled ballplayer, who gambled away the World Series check not long after before fizzling out with the Yankees by 1940, amidst controversial remarks involving him beating people as a cop to train in the offseason. He died in 1948 at the age of 40 after shooting himself in a police station for passing bad checks.

<text>Perrine is a lunar impact crater that is located on the northern hemisphere on the far side of the Moon. It lies to the west of the large walled plain Landau, and to the northeast of the crater Charlier. To the north-northwest is the smaller Gullstrand.

This is an unusual formation that forms part of a chain of connected craters. The western two-thirds of Perrine is overlain by the slightly smaller Perrine S, so that Perrine is crescent-shaped. The western rim of Perrine S is overlain by the still-smaller Perrine T. Perrine S has a worn outer rim, and a small central peak in the middle of the floor.

The surviving rim of Perrine is worn and eroded, with the overlapping pair Perrine E and Perrine G intruding slightly into the eastern rim. A smaller crater has disrupted the southwest end of the outer rim, and a pair of small craters are attached to the northern rim.

Only a small portion of the interior floor of Perrine still survives, forming a crescent-shaped surface between the outer of Perrine S and the inner wall of Perrine. It is marked by a pair of tiny craterlets in the northern half.

The crater was formally named by the IAU in 1970, after Charles D. Perrine. The satellite craters Perrine G and Perrine S were called &quot;Crater 94&quot; and &quot;Crater 91&quot;, respectively.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Perrine.

<doc id="1332356" wikidata="Q4564126" url="?curid=1332356" title="1937 World Series">
<text>The 1937 World Series featured the defending champion New York Yankees and the New York Giants in a rematch of the 1936 Series. The Yankees won in five games, for their second championship in a row and their sixth in 15 years (1923, 1927–28, 1932, 1936).

This was the Yankees&#x27; third Series win over the Giants (1923, 1936), finally giving them an overall edge in Series wins over the Giants with three Fall Classic wins to the Giants&#x27; two (after they lost the and 1922 Series to the Giants). Currently (), the St. Louis Cardinals are the only &quot;Classic Eight&quot; National League (1900–1961) team to hold a Series edge over the Bronx Bombers, with three wins to the Yankees&#x27; two. The 1937 victory by the Yankees also broke a three-way tie among themselves, the Philadelphia Athletics and the Boston Red Sox for the most World Series wins all-time (five each). By the time the Athletics and Red Sox each won their sixth World Series (in 1972 and 2004, respectively), the Yankees had far outpaced both teams in world championships with 20 in 1972 and 26 in 2004.

The 1937 Series was the first in which a team (in this case, the Yankees) did not commit a single error, handling 179 total chances (132 putouts, 47 assists) perfectly. Game 4 ended with the final World Series innings ever pitched by Hall of Famer Carl Hubbell, who during the ninth inning gave up Hall of Famer Lou Gehrig&#x27;s final Series home run.

==Summary==
==Matchups==

===Game 1===
The Series opener was a battle of aces, as the Giants sent their &quot;Mealticket&quot;, screwballer Carl Hubbell, who had won 22 games during the season, to the mound against the Bombers&#x27; Lefty Gomez, who had won 21. Hubbell and Gomez matched zeroes until the top of the fifth inning, when Jimmy Ripple singled, moved to third on another single by Johnny McCarthy, and scored the only Giant run of the game when Gus Mancuso hit into a double play.

Hubbell kept the Yankees at bay in the bottom half of the inning, but the wheels came off for him in the sixth. A walk and two singles loaded the bases with one out before Joe DiMaggio&#x27;s two-run single put the Yankees up 2–1. An intentional walk reloaded the bases before Bill Dickey&#x27;s RBI single increased the lead to 3-1, then George Selkirk&#x27;s two-run single following a force out at home chased King Carl. An error on Tony Lazzeri&#x27;s ground ball made it 6–1 Yankees, then Giant pitcher Dick Coffman issued two walks, including one to Red Rolfe that forced in a run before DiMaggio flew out to end the inning. Tony Lazzeri added a home run in the eighth inning off Al Smith, while Gomez stymied the Giants, holding them to one run and six hits in a complete game, 8–1 victory for a 1–0 Yankee lead in the Series.

===Game 2===
For Game 2, the Yankees started veteran Red Ruffing against Giant rookie Cliff Melton. Ruffing would give Melton a rude welcome to postseason play with both his arm and his bat.

The Giants touched Ruffing for a run in the first, as Dick Bartell doubled and Mel Ott drove him in with a single with one out. This did not faze Ruffing, who whiffed the next three batters to end the inning. As in Game 1, this would be the only Giant run of the day. Melton was able to neutralize the potent Bombers for the next four innings, giving up only two hits and striking out two. In the fifth, however, the Yankees chased the youngster from the game when they took a 2–1 lead on a leadoff double by Myril Hoag, then RBI singles by George Selkirk and Ruffing.

Just as in Game 1, the pinstripers opened up the game in the sixth, when Selkirk and Ruffing came through again, this time with two-run doubles after two leadoff singles off of Harry Gumbert. In the seventh, the Yankees tacked on two more runs off of Dick Coffman with leadoff single and walk, followed by a Bill Dickey single that scored Joe DiMaggio and a fly ball by Myril Hoag that plated Lou Gehrig. Ruffing held the fort the rest of the way, scattering seven hits with one run and eight strikeouts. For the second straight game the Yankees won 8–1, for a 2–0 Series lead as the teams moved a few miles south to the Polo Grounds.

===Game 3===
The Yankees struck first in Game 3 on Tony Lazzeri&#x27;s RBI single with two on in the second off of Hal Schumacher. Next inning, Lou Gehrig hit a one out single, and scored on a triple by Bill Dickey, who then scored on a single by George Selkirk. Gehrig added a sacrifice fly next inning with runners on first and third. The Yankees got one more run in the fifth when Selkirk reached second on an error and scored on Myril Hoag&#x27;s single. The Giants scored their only run in the seventh when Jimmy Ripple singled with one out and scored on Johnny McCarthy&#x27;s double. Monte Pearson needed last-out help from Johnny Murphy after loading the bases in the bottom of the ninth, inducing Harry Danning, the tying run at the plate, to fly out to centerfield. The Yankees now had a 3–0 lead in the series.

===Game 4===
This is the second time in World Series history that a team that has lost the first three games has won a World Series game. This was Carl Hubbell&#x27;s last World Series appearance. Hubbell allowed only six hits and walked one. Everyone in the NY Giants lineup except Hubbell hit safely. The Yankees scored the game&#x27;s first run in the first when Red Rolfe hit a leadoff triple and scored on Joe DiMaggio&#x27;s sacrifice fly, but in the bottom of the second, three consecutive leadoff singles tied the game. Carl Hubbell&#x27;s fielder&#x27;s choice and Jo-Jo Moore&#x27;s single scored a run each. Ivy Andrews relieved Bump Hadley and allowed an RBI single to Dick Bartell. A two-out walk loaded the bases before Hank Leiber&#x27;s two-run single capped the inning&#x27;s scoring. The Yankees scored a run in the third without a hit aided by three errors. The Giants added a run in the seventh on Harry Danning&#x27;s RBI double with two on. Lou Gehrig homered in the ninth for the Yankees, who could get nothing else as the Giants&#x27; 7–3 win forced a Game 5.

===Game 5===
Myril Hoag&#x27;s home run leading off the second inning and a Joe DiMaggio blast in the third gave Lefty Gomez a 2–0 lead. Mel Ott&#x27;s two-run home run in the bottom of the third tied it. The Yankees got the game-winning (and Series-winning) runs they needed in the fifth on a Tony Lazzeri triple, an RBI single by Gomez and an RBI double by Lou Gehrig.

<text>Novamute Records is the electronic dance music subsidiary of Mute Records, which was started in 1992. The label&#x27;s staff included Mick Paterson (promotions), Pepe Jansz (A&amp;R), and producer Seth Hodder, and it was originally set up to give UK releases to white label 12-inch singles and imports. In the United States it was distributed by Tommy Boy Records while the Mute parent label was distributed by Elektra Records.

In the beginning, the label licensed records and music from small labels such as Berlin-based Tresor and Canadian label Plus 8. It expanded its remit to include new work from artists such as Richie Hawtin and Luke Slater.

Novamute win the Best Label award at the Music und Maschine Awards in Germany in July 2002.

In 2017, Daniel Miller relaunched the label with releases from Nicolas Bougaïeff and Terence Fixmer.

<doc id="1332358" wikidata="Q4564598" url="?curid=1332358" title="1939 World Series">
<text>The 1939 World Series featured the three-time defending champion New York Yankees against the Cincinnati Reds, who were making their first Series appearance since winning the scandal-tainted 1919 World Series. The Yankees swept the Series in four games for the second straight year, winning their record fourth consecutive title (they would later win five straight from 1949 to 1953). Yankee manager Joe McCarthy won his fifth title, tying the record held by Philadelphia Athletics manager Connie Mack.

In the 10th inning of the final game, a famous play at the plate typified the Series. &quot;King Kong&quot; Charlie Keller scored when he and the ball both collided with catcher &quot;Schnoz&quot; Ernie Lombardi, and then Joe DiMaggio also scored while Lombardi, rolling on the ground, tried in vain to retrieve the ball. Lombardi had been smacked in the groin, but the puritanical press reported it as Lombardi &quot;napping&quot; at the plate.

The Yankees matched the Reds in hits with 27, but out-homered them 7–0 and out-scored them 20–8. Keller led the Yanks with seven hits, three home runs, six RBI, eight runs scored, a .438 average and a 1.188 slugging percentage. Both teams played sterling defense for most of the series until the ninth inning of Game 4. Up until then the Reds matched the Yankees with committing just one error for the series. But Cincinnati committed a total of three errors in the ninth and 10th innings of Game 4 which led to five unearned runs, sealing the New York sweep.

Keller broke the record for most homers by a rookie in a World Series game with two in Game 3. Also in Game 3, Junior Thompson gave up five hits in innings worked. Four of the five were home runs, tying the record for long balls allowed during a Series game set by the Cubs&#x27; Charlie Root in 1932.

Despite the loss, the Reds were an organization on the rise, having improved from eighth and last in the National League in 1937 (56–98, .364) to fourth in &#x27;38 (82–68, .547) and first as NL champions in &#x27;39. Ironically, despite being dominated by the Bronx Bombers in the 1939 Series, the Reds would return in 1940 to win the World Series while the Yankees finished behind Detroit and Cleveland in the AL pennant race, snapping their consecutive World Series streak at four.

The Yankees and Reds would not meet again in the World Series until 1961 — a 5-game Yankees win. The two teams would meet again in 1976, with the Reds winning in a 4-game sweep.

At a cumulative time of seven hours and five minutes, the 1939 World Series is one of the shortest World Series in real time, and was shorter than the third game of the 2018 World Series that lasted 7 hours, 20 minutes and was 18 innings long.

==Summary==
==Matchups==

===Game 1===

In the opener, starters Red Ruffing and Paul Derringer pitched complete games. The Reds struck first in the fourth inning when Ival Goodman walked with two outs and scored on Frank McCormick&#x27;s single, but the Yankees tied the game in the fifth inning Joe Gordon singled and scored on Babe Dahlgren&#x27;s double. In the bottom of the ninth inning with one out and the score tied 1–1, Charlie Keller tripled. The Reds walked Joe DiMaggio, but Bill Dickey ended it with a walk-off single to center.

===Game 2===

Lasting just 87 minutes, both pitchers threw complete games, Monte Pearson winning it with a two-hitter. In the bottom of the third inning Babe Dahlgren hit a leadoff double and scored on two groundouts. Red Rolfe then singled and scored on Charlie Keller&#x27;s double. After another single, Bill Dickey&#x27;s RBI single made it 3–0 Yankees. They added another run in the fourth inning on Dalgren&#x27;s home run and took a 2–0 series lead heading to Cincinnati.

===Game 3===

In Game 3, Charlie Keller&#x27;s two-run home run the first off of Gene &quot;Junior&quot; Thompson put the Yankees up 2–0. In the bottom half, three consecutive two-out singles, the last an RBI one by Ernie Lombardi, cut the lead to 2–1. Yankees&#x27; starter Lefty Gomez left after that inning. In the second, Bump Hadley allowed four singles, the last two of which to Billy Werber and Ival Goodman scoring a run each, but in the third, Joe DiMaggio&#x27;s two-run home run after a two-out walk to Keller put the Yankees back in front 4–3. They added to their lead in the fifth on Keller&#x27;s two-run home run and Bill Dickey&#x27;s home run to knock Thompson out of the game. Their 7–3 win left them one win away from the championship.

===Game 4===

Neither side scored until the seventh. Home runs by Charlie Keller and Bill Dickey off of starter Paul Derringer put the Yankees on the board, but the Reds struck back in their half of the inning. With runners on second and third via an error and double off of reliever Steve Sundra, Wally Berger&#x27;s RBI groundout put the Reds on the board, then after a walk, back-to-back RBI singles by Willard Hershberger and Billy Werber put the Reds up 3–2. They added another run next inning when Ival Goodman hit a leadoff double off of Johnny Murphy and scored on Ernie Lombardi&#x27;s single, but in the ninth after two leadoff singles off of Bucky Walters, Dickey&#x27;s fielder&#x27;s choice aided by an error scored a run, then one out later, Joe Gordon&#x27;s RBI single tied the game. Next inning, with two on via a walk and error, Joe DiMaggio drove them both in with a single and another error allowed DiMaggio himself to score to put the Yankees up 7–4. In the bottom half, Murphy allowed two leadoff singles, but retired the next three batters to end the game and series.

<text>The 1940 World Series matched the Cincinnati Reds against the Detroit Tigers, with the Reds winning a closely contested seven-game series. The victory secured the Reds the second championship in their franchise history and came 21 years after their victory over the scandal-tainted Chicago White Sox in . This would be the Reds&#x27; last World Series championship for 35 years despite appearances in , , and . Meanwhile, Bill Klem worked the last of his record 18 World Series as an umpire.

Other story lines marked this series. Henry Quillen Buffkin Newsom, the father of Detroit&#x27;s star pitcher Bobo Newsom, died in a Cincinnati hotel room the day after watching him win Game 1. Newsom came back to hurl a shutout in Game 5 in his memory. Called on to start a third time after a single day of rest by Tiger manager Del Baker, he pitched well in Game 7 until the seventh inning, when the Reds scored two runs to take the lead and eventually the game and the Series.

The Reds&#x27; star pitchers Paul Derringer and Bucky Walters won two games apiece, with Derringer winning the decisive seventh game. Walters hurled two complete games, allowing only eight hits and three runs combined. He also hit a home run in Game 6 in the midst of his 4–0 shutout, which sent the Series to a Game 7.

It was redemption of sorts for the Reds, who returned to the World Series after being swept by the Yankees squad in 1939. The Reds&#x27; win in Game 2 against Detroit snapped a 10-game losing streak for the National League in the Series going back to Game 5 in 1937.

The victory culminated a somewhat turbulent season for the Reds, who played large stretches of the season without injured All-Star catcher Ernie Lombardi. And on August 3, Lombardi&#x27;s backup, Willard Hershberger, committed suicide in Boston a day after a defensive lapse cost the Reds a game against the Bees. Hershberger was hitting .309 at the time of his death. The Reds dedicated the rest of the season to &quot;Hershie.&quot; One of the stars in the World Series was 40-year-old Jimmie Wilson. Wilson had been one of the Reds&#x27; coaches before Hershberger&#x27;s suicide forced him back onto the playing field as Lombardi&#x27;s backup. With Lombardi hurting, Wilson did the bulk of the catching against Detroit and hit .353 for the Series and recorded the team&#x27;s only stolen base.

Reds&#x27; manager Bill McKechnie became the first manager to win a World Series with two different teams, at the helm of the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1925, after trailing three games to one against Walter Johnson and the Washington Senators.

==Summary==
==Matchups==

===Game 1===
Bobo Newsom won Game 1 aided by a five-run second inning by Detroit. Two singles and an error loaded the bases before Pinky Higgins drove in two runs with a single. A walk reloaded the bases before Dick Bartell&#x27;s two-run single. Bruce Campbell&#x27;s RBI single knocked starter Paul Derringer out of the game. The Reds got on the board in the fourth when Ival Goodman hit a leadoff double and scored on Jimmy Ripple&#x27;s single, but Campbell&#x27;s two-run home run in the fifth off Whitey Moore extended the Tigers&#x27; lead to 7–1. The Reds got another run in the eighth when Billy Werber doubled and scored on Goodman&#x27;s single, but nothing else as Detroit took a 1–0 series lead.

The Tigers&#x27; win in Game 1 was the first World Series game won by a non-New York City team since 1935. In every World Series between 1935 and 1940, either both teams were from New York City or a New York City team won in a sweep (1938 and 1939).

===Game 2===

Detroit struck first in Game 2 Bucky Walters allowed two leadoff walks in the first, then an RBI single to Charlie Gehringer and ground-ball RBI double-play to Hank Greenberg, but the Reds tied it in the second on four singles off Schoolboy Rowe, two of which by Eddie Joost and Billy Myers scoring a run each. Next inning, Jimmy Ripple&#x27;s two-run home run put the Reds up 4–2. Back-to-back doubles by Walters and Billy Werber made it 5–2 Reds in the fourth. The Tigers got a run in the sixth on Hank Greenberg&#x27;s RBI double after a walk and forceout in the sixth, but nothing else besides Pinky Higgins&#x27;s leadoff double in the fifth as the Reds tied the series with a 5–3 win heading to Detroit.

===Game 3===

The Reds struck first in Game 3 when Billy Werber doubled to lead off the first off Tommy Bridges and scored on Ival Goodman&#x27;s single, but the Tigers tied it in the fourth on Hank Greenberg&#x27;s double-play after back-to-back leadoff singles off Jim Turner. Detroit went up 5–1 in the seventh on two-run home runs by Rudy York and Pinky Higgins. The Reds got a run in the eighth on Mike McCormick&#x27;s RBI single with two on, but in the bottom half, Greenberg hit a leadoff triple off Joe Beggs before Bruce Campbell&#x27;s RBI single and Higgins&#x27;s RBI double made it 7–2 Tigers. In the ninth after a leadoff single and error, RBI singles by Eddie Joost and Werber made it 7–4 Tigers, but Bridges struck out McCormick to end the game as Detroit took a 2–1 series lead.

===Game 4===

In Game 4, after a leadoff walk off Dizzy Trout, Ival Goodman&#x27;s RBI double and Pinky Higgins&#x27;s error on Jimmy Ripple&#x27;s ground ball made it 2–0 Reds in the first. They made it 3–0 in the third on Jimmy Ripple&#x27;s RBI double after two leadoff singles. The Tigers got on the board in the bottom half when Paul Derringer walked Barney McCosky, who moved to second on a groundout and scored on Hank Greenberg&#x27;s RBI double, but the Reds got back that run in the fourth on Ival Goodman&#x27;s sacrifice fly off Clay Smith after a leadoff walk and double. The Tigers got another run in the sixth Bruce Campbell singled with two outs and scored on Higgins&#x27;s triple, but the Reds again got the run back in the eighth when Billy Werber singled with two outs off Archie McKain, moved to second on a wild pitch and scored on Mike McCormick&#x27;s RBI single. Derringer pitched a complete game to give the Reds a 5–2 win, tying the series 2–2.

===Game 5===

Bobo Newsom allowed only three singles and two walks in the shutout, the day after his father died. Detroit got on the board on Hank Greenberg&#x27;s three-run home run after two leadoff singles in the third. Next inning, Billy Sullivan drew a leadoff walk, moved to second on a sacrifice bunt and scored on Dick Bartell&#x27;s double. Two walks by starter Junior Thompson and reliever Whitey Moore loaded the bases before Hank Greenberg&#x27;s sacrifice fly and after another walk, Bruce Campbell&#x27;s two-run single made it 7–0 Tigers. They got another run in the eighth on Johnny Hutchings&#x27;s wild pitch with two on and were just one win way from the championship heading back to Cincinnati.

===Game 6===

Bucky Walters drew the Reds even with a five-hit shutout. He helped his own cause with an RBI fielder&#x27;s choice in the sixth with the bases loaded off Johnny Gorsica and a solo home run in the eighth off Fred Hutchinson. Schoolboy Rowe was knocked out after just of an inning, allowing four hits, including RBI singles to Ival Goodman and Jimmy Ripple. The Reds&#x27; 4–0 win forced a final Game 7.

===Game 7===

Game 7 was over in 1 hour, 47 minutes. Detroit and pitcher Bobo Newsom clung to a 1-0 lead, courtesy of Charlie Gehringer&#x27;s third inning RBI single off Paul Derringer, until the seventh. Frank McCormick hit a leadoff double. Jimmy Ripple came up and then hit a double to score McCormick and tie the game. Jimmie Wilson came up and delivered a perfect sacrifice bunt to advance Ripple to third base. Ernie Lombardi, placed in the game to pinch-hit for Eddie Joost, was then intentionally walked to bring up Billy Myers. He hit a sacrifice fly on a ball to deep center that scored Ripple to deliver the go-ahead run. While Charlie Gehringer had a leadoff single in the 8th inning, the Tigers would not record a single hit afterwards, with Earl Averill grounding out to clinch the game and Series for the Reds.

==Composite line score==
1940 World Series (4–3): Cincinnati Reds (NL) over Detroit Tigers (AL)
==Home runs by pitchers==
Bucky Walters, converted to pitching only after a torn cartilage (not repairable in those days) had slowed him down as a runner, was the fourth National League pitcher to hit a home run during a World Series game. The others were:

<text>The 1944 World Series was an all-St. Louis World Series, matching the St. Louis Cardinals and St. Louis Browns at Sportsman&#x27;s Park. It marked the third time in World Series history in which both teams had the same home field (the others being the and Series, both played at the Polo Grounds in New York City). It would be 76 years before another World Series had all of its games played in a single ballpark: the Series used Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas as a neutral site due to health concerns regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.

1944 saw perhaps the of 20th-century baseball, as the long-moribund St. Louis Browns won their only American League pennant. Some of the players were 4-Fs, rejected by the military for physical defects (such as one armed Pete Gray) or limitations that precluded duty. Others divided their time between factory work in defense industries and baseball, some being able to play ball only on weekends. Some players avoided the draft by chance, despite being physically able to serve. Stan Musial of the Cardinals was one. Musial, enlisting in early 1945, missed one season. He rejoined the Cardinals in 1946.

As both teams called Sportsman&#x27;s Park home, the traditional 2–3–2 home field assignment was used (instead of the wartime 3–4). The Junior World Series of that same year, partly hosted in Baltimore&#x27;s converted football stadium, easily outdrew the &quot;real&quot; Series and attracted attention to Baltimore as a potential major league city. Ten years later, the Browns transferred there and became the Orioles. The Orioles would go on to win the 1966 World Series, and become the last of the AL&#x27;s eight charter franchises to do so. Another all-Missouri World Series was played 41 years later, with the Kansas City Royals defeating the Cardinals in seven games.

The Series was also known as the &quot;Trolley Series,&quot; &quot;Streetcar Series,&quot; or the &quot;St. Louis Showdown.&quot; Coincidentally, this World Series was played the same year Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer released the musical film &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot;. It remains one of two World Series played that featured two teams from the same city other than New York; the other was the 1906 World Series between the two Chicago teams. The 1989 World Series featured two teams from the San Francisco metropolitan area, but not the same city. It was also the first World Series in which both teams played west of the Mississippi River.

This is currently the earliest World Series in which one of the teams (St. Louis Browns), has had no personnel elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame. 

This is the only World Series to date in which neither team was credited with a stolen base.

This would also be the final World Series where Kenesaw Mountain Landis was the commissioner of baseball. Landis died a little over a month later on November 25.

==Background==
Many of the game&#x27;s best players were called away for World War II, and the result was a seriously depleted pool of talent. The top team in the American League was the St. Louis Browns, who collectively batted .252 en route to their only pennant in 52 seasons. They only had one .300 hitter in outfielder Mike Kreevich (who barely made it at .301), one man with 20 home runs, shortstop Vern Stephens (who hit exactly 20), and one player over the 85 runs batted in mark, Stephens, who knocked in 109 to lead the league. On the mound, the Browns boasted Nels Potter and Jack Kramer, who combined for 36 victories. The team squeaked into first place by winning 11 out of their final 12 games, including the last 4 in a row over the defending champion New York Yankees. The last victory, combined with Detroit&#x27;s loss to Washington, enabled St. Louis to finish one game ahead of the Tigers in the American League. Their 89–65 record would be the worst for an AL champion until the Minnesota Twins won the pennant in 1987 with a record of 85–77.

On the other side of Sportsman&#x27;s Park, the other Major League team from St. Louis was doing business as usual. In making off with their third straight National League pennant (leading by games over Pittsburgh), manager Billy Southworth&#x27;s Cardinals had won 105 games and ran their three-year victory total to 316. The Cardinals were the first National League franchise with three consecutive 100 win seasons. The 1944 club featured league MVP Marty Marion and future Hall of Famer Stan Musial.

==Summary==
==Matchups==

===Game 1===
George McQuinn hit the Browns&#x27; only home run of the series to put his team ahead in the fourth inning, while Denny Galehouse outpitched World Series veteran Mort Cooper, who allowed only two hits, to hold on for the win.

===Game 2===
Blix Donnelly came in as a relief pitcher in the eighth inning, and tallied no runs, two hits and seven strikeouts for the win. Ken O&#x27;Dea&#x27;s pinch-hit single in the 11th scored the winning run.

===Game 3===
Jack Kramer struck out ten batters on the way to a 6–2 Browns triumph, the last World Series game the team would win until the 1966 World Series, as the Baltimore Orioles.

===Game 4===
Browns starter Sig Jakucki had been away from baseball for five years, but returned to win 13 games in 1944. He lasted only three innings giving up four runs. Stan Musial hit a two-run homer in the first, and the Browns never recovered. Harry Brecheen went the distance for the win despite giving up nine hits and four walks.

===Game 5===
Mort Cooper recovered from his opening game loss to beat Galehouse with a seven-hit, 2–0 shutout. In the Cardinals&#x27; 1942–1944 stranglehold on the National League championship, Cooper had won 65 games and thrown 23 shutouts.

===Game 6===
For Game 6, it was Max Lanier and Ted Wilks (who both had 17 wins and shared a 2.65 ERA) that wrote the final chapter to the Browns&#x27; &quot;Cinderella season&quot; with a 3–1 victory that wrapped up the Cardinals&#x27; second Series title in three years. Ted Wilks was brilliant in relief, retiring all 11 Browns he faced, clinching the Cardinals&#x27; fifth World Series title.

<text>The 1947 World Series matched the New York Yankees against the Brooklyn Dodgers. The Yankees won the Series in seven games for their 11th World Series championship in team history. Yankees manager Bucky Harris won the Series for the first time since managing the Washington Senators to their only title in , a gap of 23 years, the longest between World Series appearances in history.

In 1947, Jackie Robinson, a Brooklyn Dodger, desegregated major league baseball. For the first time in World Series history, a racially integrated team played.

This was the first World Series televised. However, TV broadcasting was still in its infancy, and thus the series was only seen in four markets via coaxial inter-connected stations: New York City; Philadelphia; Schenectady/Albany, New York; Washington, D.C.. Outside of New York, coverage was pooled. The stations in those markets affiliated with NBC televised games 1 and 5; the DuMont stations had games 2, 6, and 7, and those affiliated with CBS broadcast games 3 and 4.
==Summary==
==Matchups==

===Game 1===

There was an announced crowd of 73,365 in Yankee Stadium for Game 1. Brooklyn struck first in the first inning on Dixie Walker&#x27;s RBI single off Spec Shea to score Pete Reiser from second base, but starter Ralph Branca was knocked out in a five-run fifth. A single, walk and hit-by-pitch loaded the bases before Johnny Lindell&#x27;s two-run double put the Yankees up 2–1. After a walk re-loaded the bases, another walk forced in a run, then after a groundout, Tommy Henrich&#x27;s RBI single to left off Hank Behrman capped the inning&#x27;s scoring. The Dodgers chipped away at the Yankees lead, getting a run in the sixth on Carl Furillo&#x27;s RBI single off Joe Page and another in the seventh on Page&#x27;s wild pitch with Pee Wee Reese at second, but Page held the Dodgers scoreless afterward as the Yankees took a 1–0 series lead.

===Game 2===

The Yankees struck first in Game 2 on Johnny Lindell&#x27;s double-play ground ball after two leadoff singles in the first off Vic Lombardi, scoring Snuffy Stirnweiss, but the Dodgers tied the game in the third on Jackie Robinson&#x27;s RBI single. The Yankees regained the lead in the bottom half of the inning on Lindell&#x27;s RBI triple with a runner at third, but the Dodgers again tied the game in the fourth on Dixie Walker&#x27;s home run. In the bottom half of the fourth, after a leadoff triple, Phil Rizzuto&#x27;s RBI double put the Yankees back in front 3–2. In the next inning, Tommy Henrich&#x27;s lead-off home run extended their lead to 4–2. After a ground-rule double knocked Lombardi out of the game, George McQuinn&#x27;s RBI single off Hal Gregg made it 5–2 Yankees. The Yankees added another run in the sixth on Lindell&#x27;s sacrifice fly before breaking it open in the seventh. After a leadoff single and wild pitch by Hank Behrman, Billy Johnson&#x27;s RBI single made it 7–2 Yankees. After a pop out and intentional walk, Reynolds&#x27;s RBI single made it 8–2 Yankees. Rex Barney relieved Behrman and allowed an RBI single to Snuffy Stirnweiss and threw a wild pitch that turned the Yanks&#x27; advantage to 10–2. The Dodgers scored one more run in the ninth on Spider Jorgensen&#x27;s groundout off Allie Reynolds, who scattered nine hits in a complete-game win.

===Game 3===

The series shifted to Ebbets Field. In the second inning the Dodgers rang up six runs. After a one-out walk, Bruce Edwards&#x27;s double and Pee Wee Reese&#x27;s single scored a run each. One out later, after a single and passed ball, Eddie Stanky&#x27;s two-run double was the end for Yankee starter Bobo Newsom, but the runs kept coming with a Carl Furillo two-run double after a single off Vic Raschi. The rest of the day, the Yankees pecked away. Back-to-back RBI singles by Johnny Lindell and Joe DiMaggio off Joe Hatten made it 6–2 Dodgers in the third. After the Dodgers scored a run in the bottom half of the third on Spider Jorgensen&#x27;s RBI single after a hit-by-pitch and wild pitch by Karl Drews, Sherm Lollar hit an RBI double in the fourth after a walk and Snuffy Stirnweiss added an RBI single. After two walks in the bottom half of the fourth off Spud Chandler, the Dodgers got those runs back on back-to-back RBI singles by Dixie Walker and Gene Hermanski, but Joe DiMaggio hit a two-run home run in the fifth after a walk. Tommy Henrich&#x27;s RBI double in the next inning and Yogi Berra&#x27;s home run in the seventh off Ralph Branca made it 9–8 Dodgers. Reliever Hugh Casey set down Billy Johnson, Phil Rizzuto and Berra in order in the ninth.

===Game 4===

The Yankees entered Game 4 aiming to take a three games to one lead in the best-of-seven series, and came one out away from doing this. They scored a run in the first on a bases-loaded walk off Harry Taylor and another in the fourth on Johnny Lindell&#x27;s double after a leadoff triple off Hal Gregg. Bill Bevens, the Yankee starter, pitched innings without allowing a base hit, but allowed a run in the fifth on Pee Wee Reese&#x27;s fielder&#x27;s choice after two walks and a sacrifice bunt. No pitcher had ever thrown a no-hitter in a major league World Series game.

Going into the bottom of the ninth inning, Bevens and the Yankees led 2–1. Bevens got Bruce Edwards to fly out, and then walked Carl Furillo. Spider Jorgensen fouled out for the 2nd out. Al Gionfriddo pinch-ran for Furillo. Pete Reiser pinch-hit for pitcher Hugh Casey; during the at-bat, Gionfriddo stole second base. The Yankees then intentionally walked Reiser. Eddie Miksis pinch-ran for Reiser, and the Dodgers sent Cookie Lavagetto to pinch-hit for Eddie Stanky. Lavagetto lined a 1–0 fastball to right field; the ball ricocheted off the wall with a peculiar bounce and hit Yankee right fielder Tommy Henrich in the shoulder, as Gionfriddo and Miksis raced around to score. The play ended the no-hitter and won the game for the Dodgers.

The hit was the last of Lavagetto&#x27;s career. Additionally, neither Lavagetto nor Bevens nor Gionfriddo would play in the majors again following this Series.

The Dodgers, with this hit, avoided a three-games-to-one deficit, avoided becoming the victim of a no-hitter, and tied the Series at two games each. The rapid and dramatic reversal of fortunes may have provided a momentum swing. The Dodgers were the first of two teams in MLB history to win a playoff game while being held to one hit (the Oakland A&#x27;s would later do so in the 1974 ALCS)

As was the case in their only previous World Series encounter six years earlier, the Yankees and Dodgers again played a dramatic Game 4 which was decided on a lead change with two outs in the ninth inning. In both instances the Yankees entered the game with a 2–1 series lead and Hugh Casey ended up being the pitcher of record for the Dodgers (losing in 1941, winning in 1947).

===Game 5===

Nine walks in fewer than five innings proved the undoing of Rex Barney in this start for Brooklyn. A pair of walks and RBI single by opposing pitcher Spec Shea in the fourth put the Yankees up 1–0. Joe DiMaggio homered to left in the fifth. That was all the runs the visiting Yanks would get at Ebbets Field, but this was all Shea needed. A hit by Jackie Robinson in the sixth scored Al Gionfriddo to pull the Dodgers within 2–1. Then in the ninth, after a Bruce Edwards leadoff single and sacrifice bunt by Carl Furillo, the tying run died on base. Shea got Spider Jorgensen on a fly to right, and with Brooklyn&#x27;s fans on their feet, pinch-hitter Cookie Lavagetto struck out.

===Game 6===
The Dodgers won Game 6 to force a seventh and deciding game. Three straight singles loaded the bases in the first with no outs, then Dixie Walker&#x27;s double play and Allie Reynolds&#x27;s passed ball scored a run each. In the third, three straight doubles by Pee Wee Reese, Jackie Robinson and Walker made it 4–0 Dodgers. In the bottom of the inning, after a double and wild pitch by Vic Lombardi, an error on Snuffy Stirnweiss&#x27;s ground ball allowed a run to score. After a single, Johnny Lindell&#x27;s RBI single cut the Dodgers&#x27; lead to 4–2. After another single knocked Lombardi out of the game, RBI singles by Billy Johnson and Bobby Brown off Ralph Branca tied the game. Yogi Berra&#x27;s RBI single next inning put the Yankees up 5–4. In the sixth, after a leadoff single and double off Joe Page, Cookie Lavagetto&#x27;s sacrifice fly tied the game, then Bobby Bragan&#x27;s RBI single put the Dodgers up 6–5. A single knocked Page out of the game,then Reese&#x27;s two-run single off Bobo Newsom made it 8–5 Dodgers.

A catch made by Al Gionfriddo, replayed countless times, may be the most remembered play of this game, and one of the most remembered plays of the Series.
In the last of the sixth, the Dodgers sent Al Gionfriddo to left field as a defensive replacement for Eddie Miksis. Joe Hatten came in to pitch. With two on and two outs, Joe DiMaggio came to bat for the Yankees, representing the potential tying run. DiMaggio drove the ball deep, and Gionfriddo quickly pedalled back to snare it just in front of the bullpen-alley fence, near the marker posted to the center field side of the bullpen alley (the sign on the left field side of the alley was posted as 402). Radio announcer Red Barber provided the play-by-play, which has often accompanied re-played film footage:

Many announcers since that time have used variations of the call, especially Chris Berman of ESPN. These announcers have tended to describe the &quot;ball itself&quot; as going &quot;back-back-back&quot;. In Barber&#x27;s call, it was the &quot;outfielder&quot; who was going &quot;back-back-back&quot;. In Puerto Rico, sportscaster Hector Vazquez Muniz uses a Spanish variation of this call, in his case &quot;Y se va, se va, se va!&quot;

Films of the play showed DiMaggio, heading for second, kick the dirt in disgust after he realized Gionfriddo had caught the ball. This was a surprise to many who witnessed it, since DiMaggio was known to never show his emotions while playing. Red Barber declared it, &quot;probably the only time ever that DiMaggio was publicly and visibly upset.&quot; 

Three of the 1947 Series&#x27; prominent figures, Gionfriddo, Lavagetto and Bevens, finished their playing careers in this Series. Gionfriddo did not play in Game 7, and his catch of DiMaggio&#x27;s drive was his only put-out in this game. So Gionfriddo&#x27;s famous catch was his final put-out in his major league career.

The Yankees loaded the bases in the bottom of the ninth off Joe Hatten and Hugh Casey, but scored only once on a groundout.

===Game 7===

The scoring began in the second inning, when the Dodgers strung together four consecutive hits: three off of Yankee starter Spec Shea, and a fourth off of reliever Bill Bevens, to put the Dodgers ahead, 2–0, in the top half of the inning. Gene Hermanski tripled, Bruce Edwards drove Hermanski in with a single, and Carl Furillo followed with another single, prompting a pitching change. Spider Jorgensen greeted reliever Bevens with a double, scoring Edwards for the second run.

In the bottom half of the second inning, the Yankees cut the lead to 2–1. After Dodger starter Hal Gregg issued two walks, Phil Rizzuto delivered an RBI single, scoring George McQuinn.

In the bottom of the fourth, the Yankees took the lead with a two-out rally. With two runners on, Bobby Brown, pinch-hitting for Bevens, doubled off of Gregg, scoring Billy Johnson to tie the game. Hank Behrman replaced Gregg. After a walk loaded the bases, Tommy Henrich stroked an RBI single, scoring Rizzuto and putting the Yankees up 3–2.

With this lead, Yankee pitcher Joe Page entered the game to begin the top of the fifth inning, and would close the game out. Over the next five innings, Page retired 13 consecutive Dodger batters. During this time, the Yankees added two runs. Rizzuto lead off the bottom of the sixth with a bunt single, and stole second base; Allie Clark drove him home with a single off of Joe Hatten, making the score 4–2. In the bottom of the seventh, Aaron Robinson hit a sacrifice fly off of Hugh Casey, to score Billy Johnson, who had just tripled.

In all, Page pitched five innings of one-hit, shutout relief. With one out in the top of the ninth, he allowed his first and only baserunner of the outing, when Eddie Miksis singled. Page quickly recovered, inducing Edwards to ground into a double play that ended the game.

==Composite line score==
1947 World Series (4–3): New York Yankees (A.L.) over Brooklyn Dodgers (N.L.)
==Records and important events==
For the first time, a World Series produced total receipts over $2 million: Gate receipts were $1,781,348.92, radio rights $175,000.00 and television rights $65,000.

Yogi Berra pinch-hit for Sherm Lollar in the seventh inning of Game 3 and hit the first pinch-hit home run in World Series history. Ralph Branca served the pitch.

This was the first World Series to be televised, although the games were only seen in a small number of Eastern markets with stations connected via coaxial cable: New York City, New York; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Schenectady, New York; Washington, DC; and environs surrounding these cities. The October 18, 1947 edition of &quot;Billboard&quot; reported that a total of over 3.9 million people viewed the seven games, primarily on TV sets located in bars (&quot;Billboard&quot; estimated 5,400 tavern TV sets in NYC alone, with 4,870 in use). The October 13, 1947, edition of &quot;Time&quot; magazine reported that President Truman, who had just made the first Oval Office TV appearance on October 5, 1947, and received the first TV for the White House, watched parts of the Series but &quot;skipped the last innings&quot;.

At the direction of Commissioner Happy Chandler, the Series, for the first time, used six umpires to make calls. Series from 1918 through 1946 used four umpires in the infield, with two alternates available if needed. However, no alternate had ever been needed, and Chandler believed that enlisting these umpires to make calls along the outfield lines would put these men and their skills to better use. However, it was not until 1964 that the additional two umpires rotated into the infield during the course of the Series.

This was the first, and to date only, World Series in which the Yankees won Game 7 in their home stadium.

<doc id="1332365" wikidata="Q3089266" url="?curid=1332365" title="Frost Like Ashes">
<text>Frost Like Ashes is an American Christian black metal band that formed in Kansas City, Missouri in 2001. The band has released three EPs and a full-length album, &quot;Tophet&quot;, and their songs have appeared on three compilation albums. Previously signed to Psycho Acoustix Records and currently to Sullen Records, an imprint of Open Grave Records, their music combines elements of black metal, death metal and thrash metal with keyboards and virtuosic vocals notable for &quot;switching between about 10 different extreme styles within a given song.&quot; Their lyrics have achieved attention for their harsh output, providing a Christian point of view for the regular themes of black metal music. The band is also controversial for using the typical corpse paint style often associated with the black metal visuals.

Their live act incorporates a reversal of stereotypical black-metal images—for example, spitting in and tearing up a Satanic Bible and smashing a goat-skull adorned pentagram with a sword.

== History ==

Two of the band members, vocalist Azahel and drummer Adonijah, were former members of death metal and thrash metal band Possession, that was active from 1992 to 1998. Frost Like Ashes was formed on the vision of guitarist, Sebat (formerly of World Funeral and Coven), who would recruit Azahel (vocals) and Syntyche (bass) in 2001 and begin what has become a hybrid of black metal and death metal.

Adonijah (drums), completed the group and they were a part of a sampler for Tarantula Promotions, titled &quot;Arachnid Terror Sampler&quot;, which featured bands such as Soul Embraced, Tortured Conscience, Frosthardr, and Kekal in 2002, and released their first EP on SoTD Records in 2003. In January 2003, Qoheleth joined the band as their first full-time dedicated keyboardist. Up to this point Adonijah would compose and record the keyboard parts. In 2004, The band parted ways with Syntyche and acquired the skills of new bassist, Ruach.

In 2005, after some delays, Frost Like Ashes&#x27; first full-length album, &quot;Tophet&quot;, was finally released.

On March 13, 2008, Blabbermouth.net reported that the band signed a record deal with Sullen records, an imprint of Open Grave Records, for the release of the band&#x27;s EP, titled &quot;Born to Pieces&quot;. The EP sold out shortly after its release, and a limited edition 7-inch vinyl was printed of &quot;Born to Pieces&quot; later. Fire, of the Polish black metal band Elgibbor, played bass for Frost Like Ashes at their Cornerstone Festival concert on July 3, 2008, to mark his full-time permanent membership in the band.

They were working on a concept album based on a book vocalist Azahel was writing. The album, tentatively titled &quot;Gods of the Great Whore&quot;, was put on-hold on January 2, 2009, until the book was written. They have written new material for another album, tentatively entitled &quot;Who Walks in the Darkness&quot;, and is to be based on a R. A. Salvatore novel, &quot;Homeland&quot;.

In 2010, the band announced that they were going on hiatus. They have said they will make new music, but they don&#x27;t see it happening right now.

In 2017, Sebat formed a label, Nosral Recordings, and signed several bands. The label is re-releasing all of Frost Like Ashes&#x27; music and re-released &quot;Live in Omaha DVD&quot;. On February 24, 2019, it was announced the project would return to record a new album, with the lineup of Sebat on Guitars, Azahel on Vocals, Fire on Bass, Qoheleth on Keyboards, and new Drummer Grond, replacing the longtime member Adonijah. The band is currently signed with Rottweiler Records. On May 29, 2020, it was announced that Grond would no longer be continuing with the project and he would be replaced by the &quot;Blastronaut&quot;. On March 26, 2021, the band released their debut single &quot;The Weight of Ice and Fog&quot;, from their upcoming release, &quot;Fellowship of Suffering&quot;.

==Names==
The band members use aliases in their albums and press to keep their identities secret, much like normal black metal, but the band&#x27;s aliases have meanings behind them. Azahel is an alternative spelling of Asahel, a figure in the Bible, Fire is the translation of Bassist Jarek Pozarycki&#x27;s name, Qoheleth means teacher or preacher, Adonijah was the name of one of David&#x27;s sons, and Sebat is Guitarist Michael Larson&#x27;s &quot;name&quot;. Though the band uses aliases, many of their names have become public knowledge.

<text>The 1948 World Series was the championship series in Major League Baseball for the 1948 season. The 45th edition of the World Series, it matched the American League (AL) champion Cleveland Indians and the National League (NL) champion Boston Braves. The Braves had won the National League pennant for the first time since the &quot;Miracle Braves&quot; team of , while the Indians had spoiled a chance for the only all-Boston World Series by winning a one-game playoff against the Boston Red Sox for the American League flag. Though superstar pitcher Bob Feller failed to win either of his two starts, the Indians won the Series in six games to capture their second championship (as well as their most recent) and their first since .

It was the first World Series to be televised beyond the previous year&#x27;s limited New York-Schenectady-Philadelphia-Baltimore-Washington network and was announced by famed sportcasters Red Barber, Tom Hussey (in Boston) and Van Patrick (in Cleveland). This was the second appearance in the Fall Classic for both teams, with the Indians&#x27; lone previous appearance coming in a 1920 win against the Brooklyn Dodgers and the Braves&#x27; lone previous appearance coming in a 1914 win against the Philadelphia Athletics. Consequently, this was the first, and to date only, World Series in which both participating teams had previously played in, but not yet lost, a previous World Series. Currently, this phenomenon can only be repeated if the Miami Marlins or the Washington Nationals play against either the Toronto Blue Jays or the Los Angeles Angels in a future World Series.

Television coverage of the World Series increased this year, but due to the medium still being in its infancy coverage was strictly regional. The series was open to any channel with an affiliation with one of the national broadcast networks: NBC, CBS, ABC, or DuMont. But games played in Boston could only be seen in the Northeast, while when the series shifted to Cleveland those games were the first to be aired in Chicago, Pittsburgh, Milwaukee, St. Louis, Detroit and Toledo. 

This was the only World Series played between and not to feature a New York team, and the last not won by a New York team until the 1957 Series (which the Braves, having relocated to Milwaukee, won over the Yankees). The two teams would meet again in the 1995 Series, with the Braves—by then relocated to Atlanta—winning. This was the first World Series, and the last until , in which both teams scored the same number of total runs. This would be the final World Series to feature a team helmed by a player-manager. This World Series also marks the longest active championship drought for the winning team. This is also the only World Series pre-1967 in which the winning team had not won at least one Commissioner&#x27;s Trophy after its introduction in the 1967 World Series. 

==Summary==
==Matchups==

===Game 1===


Braves pitcher Johnny Sain and Indians pitcher Bob Feller were engaged in a scoreless pitchers&#x27; duel when the Braves came to bat in the bottom of the eighth inning. Feller walked Braves catcher Bill Salkeld to open the inning. Braves manager, Billy Southworth then replaced the slow-footed Salkeld with Phil Masi, who entered the game as a pinch runner. Mike McCormick followed with a sacrifice bunt, advancing Masi to second base. Feller issued an intentional walk to Eddie Stanky, who was replaced by Sibby Sisti. Feller then tried to pick off Masi at second base. Indians&#x27; shortstop Lou Boudreau appeared to tag Masi out, but umpire Bill Stewart called him safe. Tommy Holmes proceeded to hit a single that allowed Masi to score the only run of the game, giving the Braves a 1–0 victory.

The umpire&#x27;s controversial ruling touched off heated debates among the media and fans, especially after Associated Press photographs of the play were published. Although Feller allowed only two hits, he took the loss in what would be the closest he came to winning a World Series game. Upon his death in 1990, Masi&#x27;s will revealed that he really was out on the pick-off play.

===Game 2===

The second game also made television history when a live broadcast of the Indians–Braves matchup was shown aboard the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad&#x27;s &quot;Marylander&quot; passenger train travelling between Washington, D.C., and New York City, using a receiver operated by Bendix Corporation technicians. An Associated Press reporter observing the demonstration said, &quot;Technically, it was surprisingly good.&quot; The Braves scored a run in the first off Bob Lemon on Bob Elliott&#x27;s RBI single with two on, but Lemon held them scoreless for the rest of the game. After three shutout innings, Lou Boudreau hit a leadoff double in the fourth off Warren Spahn, then scored on Joe Gordon&#x27;s single with Gordon advancing to second on the throw to home. One out later, Larry Doby&#x27;s RBI single put the Indians up 2–1. Next inning, Dale Mitchell hit a leadoff single, moved to second on a sacrifice bunt and scored on Boudreau&#x27;s single. The Indians scored one more run in the ninth off Nels Potter when Jim Hegan reached on an error, moved to third on two groundouts and scored on Bob Kennedy&#x27;s single. The series was tied 1–1 heading to Cleveland.

===Game 3===


For the third straight game, no home runs were hit by either team. This would not happen again in a World Series until . The game&#x27;s two runs came on Larry Doby&#x27;s groundout in the third after a double and walk and Jim Hegan&#x27;s RBI single after a single and walk in the fourth, both off Vern Bickford. Gene Bearden pitched a complete shutout, allowing five hits while striking out four, as the Indians took a 2–1 series lead.

===Game 4===

Steve Gromek of the Indians and Johnny Sain of the Braves pitched complete games each. The Indians struck first when Dale Mitchell hit a leadoff single in the first and scored on Lou Boudreau&#x27;s double, then added to their lead on Larry Doby&#x27;s home run in the third. Marv Rickert&#x27;s leadoff home run in the seventh cut the Indians&#x27; lead to 2–1, but they held on to take a 3–1 series lead.
===Game 5===


Satchel Paige appeared for the Indians, becoming the first black pitcher to take the mound in World Series history. The previous day&#x27;s single-game attendance record was broken with 86,288 fans. After two leadoff singles, Bob Elliott&#x27;s three-run home run in the first off Indians starter Bob Feller made it 3–0 Braves. Dale Mitchell&#x27;s leadoff home run in the bottom half off Nels Potter put the Indians on the board. Elliott&#x27;s second home run of the game in the third made it 4–1 Braves, but in the fourth after a leadoff single and walk, Walt Judnich&#x27;s RBI single made it 4–2 Braves, then one out later, Jim Hegan&#x27;s three-run home run put the Indians in front 5–4 and knock Potter out of the game. Bill Salkeld&#x27;s home run in the sixth tied the game. Next inning, Tommy Holmes hit a leadoff single, moved to second on a sacrifice bunt, and scored on Earl Torgeson&#x27;s RBI single. Ed Klieman relieved Feller and allowed a walk, two-runs single to Marv Rickert, and another walk. Russ Christopher then allowed RBI singles to Mike McCormick and Eddie Stanky. Warren Spahn&#x27;s sacrifice fly off Paige capped the game&#x27;s scoring at 11–5. Spahn pitched shutout innings of relief for the win, forcing a Game 6 in Boston.

===Game 6===


The Indians struck first in Game 6 when Dale Mitchell hit a leadoff double in the third off Bill Voiselle and scored on Lou Boudreau&#x27;s RBI double, but the Braves tied the game on Mike McCormick&#x27;s RBI single with two on off Bob Lemon in the fourth. A walk loaded the bases, but Voiselle grounded out to end the inning. Joe Gordon&#x27;s leadoff home in the sixth put the Indians back in front 2–1. After a one-out walk and single, Jim Hegan&#x27;s RBI groundout extended their lead to 3–1. Three straight singles in the eighth by Ken Keltner, Thurman Tucker and Eddie Robinson made it 4–1 Indians. In the bottom of the inning, the Braves loaded the bases off Lemon on a single, double and walk. Clint Conatser&#x27;s sacrifice fly and Phil Masi&#x27;s RBI double off Gene Bearden made it 4–3 Indians, but Bearden pitched a scoreless ninth for the save to give the Indians the championship, currently their last.

<text>The 1949 World Series featured the New York Yankees and Brooklyn Dodgers, with the Yankees winning in five games for their second defeat of the Dodgers in three years, and the 12th championship in team history. This victory started a record run of five straight World Series championships by the Yankees, and was also the first of 14 AL pennants in 16 years (1949–1964 except for 1954 and 1959) for the Yankees.

Both teams finished the regular season with exactly the same records and winning their respective leagues by one game.

With improvements in the then-infant television medium, the broadcast of the World Series could now be seen east of the Mississippi River. For the second consecutive season, the games were open to any channel with an affiliation with one of the national broadcast networks: NBC, CBS, ABC, or DuMont.

==Summary==
==Matchups==

===Game 1===


Don Newcombe of the Dodgers threw a complete game, five-hitter allowing only one run in a 1–0 losing effort. He struck out 11 Yankees during that game to tie the record for most strikeouts during a World Series game by a losing pitcher. Tommy Henrich led off the bottom of the ninth by tagging Newcombe for the first walk-off home run in World Series history.

===Game 2===

Preacher Roe pitched a six-hit shutout, getting the only run he needed early when Jackie Robinson doubled and Gil Hodges singled. Yankee Stadium came alive in the ninth with Joe DiMaggio&#x27;s leadoff hit, but Roe retired the next three Yankees for the win, the second straight 1–0 result of the Series.

Upon the completion of game 2, 1949 became the first World Series to contain multiple 1–0 games, a distinction only matched in 1966.

===Game 3===


In Game 3, the Yankees struck first in the third on Phil Rizzuto&#x27;s sacrifice fly with two on off Ralph Branca, but Pee Wee Reese tied the game in the fourth on a home run off Tommy Byrne. In the ninth, two walks and a single loaded the bases with two outs, when Johnny Mize delivered a two-run pinch-hit single to right. Brooklyn starter Ralph Branca was then replaced by Jack Banta, who gave up an RBI single to Jerry Coleman that made it 4–1 Yankees. It seemed safe until Luis Olmo and Roy Campanella homered in the bottom of the ninth, but Joe Page hung on for the win after innings in relief.

===Game 4===


Cliff Mapes broke a 0-0 tie in the fourth inning with a two-run double off Don Newcombe. Yankee pitcher Eddie Lopat aided his own cause with an RBI double, and the advantage ballooned to 6–0 after a bases-loaded Bobby Brown triple scored three more in the fifth off Joe Hatten. Lopat pitched five scoreless innings before allowing two lead-off singles in the sixth. After a double play moved Pee Wee Reese to third, Jackie Robinson&#x27;s RBI single put the Dodgers on the board. After a Gil Hodges single, RBI singles by Luis Olmo, Roy Campanella, and Gene Hermanski chased Lopat and cheered Ebbets Field&#x27;s fans, bringing the Dodgers back to within 6–4. After that, though, Allie Reynolds held the home team hitless.

===Game 5===


A shaky start by Rex Barney. proved costly for Brooklyn. In the first, the Yankees loaded the bases on two walks and an error before Joe DiMaggio&#x27;s sacrifice fly and Bobby Brown&#x27;s RBI single put them up 2–0. In the third, the Yankees again loaded the bases on two walks and a single before a Jerry Coleman two-run single knocked Barney out of the game. Vic Raschi&#x27;s RBI single off Jack Banta made it 5–0 Yankees. The Dodgers got on the board in the bottom half off Raschi when Roy Campanella doubled and scored on Pee Wee Reese&#x27;s single, but the Yankees got that run back with a Joe DiMaggio home run in the fourth. Next inning, Gene Woodling hit a leadoff double and scored on two groundouts. In the sixth, after a walk and single off Carl Erskine, Yogi Berra&#x27;s sacrifice fly made it 8–1 Yankees, then after a pop out, a Bobby Brown RBI triple aided by an error that allowed Brown himself to score extended their lead to 10–1. The Dodgers got a run in the bottom half on Gene Hermanski&#x27;s RBI single after a double and walk. Next inning, after a one-out single and walk, Jackie Robinson&#x27;s sacrifice fly made it 10–3 Yankees, then after another walk, Gil Hodges&#x27;s three-run home run cut their lead to 10–6. However, Joe Page held the Dodgers scoreless for the rest of the game to give the Yankees the title. 

History was made in the ninth inning when the Ebbets Field lights were turned on, making this the first World Series game finished under artificial lights. The first scheduled Series night game would not be held until .

<text>The 1953 World Series was the championship series in Major League Baseball for the 1953 season. The 50th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff that matched the American League (AL) champion and four-time defending World Series champion New York Yankees against the National League (NL) champion Brooklyn Dodgers in a rematch of the Series, and the fourth such matchup between the two teams in the past seven seasons. The Yankees won in six games for their fifth consecutive title—a mark which has not been equalled—and their 16th overall. It was also the last of seven consecutive World Series wins by teams from the American League, the longest such streak for the AL in series history. Billy Martin won World Series MVP honors as he hit .500 with a record-tying 12 hits and a walk-off RBI single in Game 6.

==Summary==
==Matchups==
===Game 1===


Before a full house (69,734 in attendance), the Yankees scored four runs in the first inning. Brooklyn starter Carl Erskine did not last past the first. After a one-out walk, an RBI triple by Hank Bauer put the Yankees up 1–0. After a strikeout, two more walks loaded the bases before Billy Martin cleared them with a triple of his own and the Dodgers pinch-hit for Erskine in the top of the second. They did not score off Allie Reynolds until the fifth on a Jim Gilliam home run. Yogi Berra matched it in the bottom of the fifth with a home run of his own, and the Yankee lead looked safe until a leadoff home run by Gil Hodges and two-run home run by pinch-hitter George Shuba chased Reynolds in the sixth. Brooklyn tied it an inning later against Johnny Sain with consecutive leadoff singles by Roy Campanella, Hodges and Carl Furillo. A home run by unsung first baseman Joe Collins proved the game-winner off Clem Labine, with winning pitcher Johnny Sain providing two more runs himself in the eighth off Ben Wade with a two-run double. Sain then scored on a Joe Collins single, and pitched a scoreless ninth to give the Yankees a 9–5 win and 1–0 series lead.

===Game 2===


He looked shaky in the first, walking three, hitting a batter, and allowing a sacrifice fly to Yogi Berra for the game&#x27;s first run, but Brooklyn&#x27;s Preacher Roe settled down after that and engaged Eddie Lopat in a complete-game pitching duel. Billy Cox&#x27;s two-run double after back-to-back two-out singles in the fourth inning put the Dodgers up 2–1. Billy Martin&#x27;s leadoff home run off Roe in the seventh inning tied the score. The game-winning blast came from Mickey Mantle, a two-run shot to left field in the bottom of the eighth. Brooklyn got two runners aboard in the ninth, but Lopat was able to retire Duke Snider on a game-ending grounder to second base.

===Game 3===


Although the Yankees won the Series, Brooklyn had at least one shining moment, as pitcher Carl Erskine set a new Series record by striking out 14 Yankees in Game 3. That broke Howard Ehmke&#x27;s record by one. Ersk&#x27;s record would stand until Sandy Koufax got 15 in .

In that same game, Yogi Berra was hit twice by Erskine, making him the first American League player in World Series history to be a hit-batsman twice during the same game. The Yankees struck first in the fifth on an RBI single by Gil McDougald with runners on second and third, but the Dodgers tied it in the bottom half on Billy Cox&#x27;s fielder&#x27;s choice with Jackie Robinson at third. Robinson&#x27;s RBI single next inning put the Dodgers up 2–1, but again the game became tied at 2–2 in the eighth on an RBI single by the Yankees&#x27; Gene Woodling. The decisive blow came in the bottom of the inning when Vic Raschi surrendered a Roy Campanella home run, which proved to be the game-winner.

===Game 4===


The home team won for the fourth consecutive time. Whitey Ford lasted just one inning as the Yankees&#x27; starter, allowing a leadoff ground-rule double to Jim Gilliam, who scored on Jackie Robinson&#x27;s single. After a forceout, wild pitch and intentional walk, Duke Snider&#x27;s two-run double made it 3–0 Dodgers. Gilliam&#x27;s double in the fourth off Tom Gorman made it 4–0, but Brooklyn&#x27;s lead was cut in half in the fifth when Billy Loes gave up a two-run home run to Gil McDougald. Snider&#x27;s leadoff home run in the sixth off Johnny Sain made it 5–2 Dodgers, then after a double and single, Gilliam&#x27;s sacrifice fly extended that lead to 6–2. Next inning, after a two-out walk, Snider&#x27;s RBI double off Art Schallock made it 7–2 Dodgers. In the ninth, two singles and walk loaded the bases with no outs for the Yankees. Clem Labine relieved Loes and got two-outs before Mickey Mantle&#x27;s RBI single cut the Dodgers&#x27; lead to 7–3, but Billy Martin was thrown out trying to score from second base to end the game, tying the series 2–2.

===Game 5===


Yankees manager Casey Stengel gave the ball to Jim McDonald for Game 5 and, while he gave up a dozen hits, he got them a win. Brooklyn starter Johnny Podres was jolted by a Gene Woodling home run to begin the game. After the Dodgers tied the game in the second on two singles followed by shortstop Phil Rizzuto&#x27;s throwing error on Carl Furillo&#x27;s ground ball, Podres was chased in a five-run third. Rizzuto drew a leadoff walk, moved to third on two groundouts, and scored on when first baseman Gil Hodges misplayed Joe Collins&#x27;s groundball. A hit-by-pitch and walk loaded the bases, and the first man Podres&#x27;s replacement Russ Meyer faced was Mickey Mantle, who greeted him with a grand slam. Duke Snider&#x27;s RBI single after a hit-by-pitch and single made it 6–2 Yankees in the fifth, but in the seventh, Billy Martin&#x27;s two-run home run off Meyer extended their lead to 8–2. Rizzuto singled with two outs and scored on McDonald&#x27;s double. The Yankees added another run in the eighth when Collins hit a leadoff double off Ben Wade, moved to third on a sacrifice bunt, and scored on Yogi Berra&#x27;s sacrifice fly, but in the bottom of the inning McDonald allowed two singles, then an RBI single to Furillo before a three-run Billy Cox home run cut their lead to 10–6. He was relieved by Bob Kuzava, who struck out Dick Williams to end the inning. Each team got a run in the ninth on a home run, Gil McDougald for the Yankees off Joe Black and Jim Gilliam for the Dodgers off Kuzava. Allie Reynolds was brought in to retire Jackie Robinson for the final out.

===Game 6===


In Game 6, after a walk, strikeout and single, Yogi Berra&#x27;s ground-rule double put the Yankees up 1–0 in the first off Carl Erskine. After an intentional walk loaded the bases, an error on Billy Martin&#x27;s ground ball made it 2–0 Yankees. Next inning, Gene Woodling&#x27;s sacrifice fly after two leadoff singles made it 3–0 Yankees. Starter Whitey Ford pitched five shutout innings, but in the sixth, allowed a one-out double to Jackie Robinson, who stole third and scored on Roy Campanella&#x27;s groundout. Down 3–1 in the ninth, Brooklyn rallied back on a Duke Snider walk followed by a Carl Furillo home run off Allie Reynolds. However, Yankee second baseman Billy Martin—who made a game-saving catch in Game 7 of the 1952 World Series—again ruined the Dodgers&#x27; dreams of a championship. In the bottom of the ninth, with a runner on second base, Martin drilled a Clem Labine sinker up the middle for a Series-winning RBI single.

Following the death of Tommy Brown in 2025, this is the earliest World Series from which a player is still living. (Art Schallock)

==Aftermath==
Dropping their seventh Series without a victory, the Dodgers terminated manager Chuck Dressen&#x27;s contract; Dressen was demanding two more years. Walter Alston took his place and managed the Dodgers for the next 23 seasons (1954–1976), leading them to four World Series championships in , , , and before being replaced by Tommy Lasorda, who would manage the team for 20 years himself (1976–1996). Lasorda would lead the Dodgers to a pair of World Series championships in and .

==Broadcasting==
The Series was broadcast on NBC television, with Yankees announcer Mel Allen and Dodgers announcer Vin Scully describing the action; and on Mutual radio, with Al Helfer and Gene Kelly announcing.

Red Barber, Vin Scully&#x27;s senior on the Dodgers&#x27; broadcast crew, was originally selected to work with Allen on NBC, but was removed from the Series due to a salary dispute with Gillette, which sponsored the broadcasts. Scully, at the age of 25, became the youngest man to broadcast a World Series game (a record that stands to this day).
