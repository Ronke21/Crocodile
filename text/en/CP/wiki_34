<text>Sziget Festival (, ) is one of the largest music and cultural festivals in Europe. It is held every August in northern Budapest, Hungary, on Óbudai-sziget (&quot;Old Buda Island&quot;), a leafy 108-hectare (266-acre) island on the Danube. More than 1,000 performances take place each year.

The week-long festival has grown from a relatively low-profile student event in 1993 to become one of the prominent European rock festivals, with about half of all visitors coming from outside Hungary, especially from Western Europe. It also has a dedicated &quot;party train&quot; service (with resident DJs) that transports festival-goers from all over Europe. The second event (1994), labelled &quot;Eurowoodstock&quot;, was headlined by performers from the original Woodstock festival. By 1997, total attendance exceeded 250,000, and by 2001 reached 360,000. In 2018 that record was broken when 565,000 visitors attended the festival. Since the mid-2000s, Sziget Festival has been increasingly labelled as a European alternative to the Burning Man festival due to its unique features (&quot;an electronically amplified, warped amusement park that has nothing to do with reality&quot;).

In 2011, Sziget was ranked one of the 5 best festivals in Europe by &quot;The Independent&quot;. The festival is a two-time winner at the European Festivals Awards in the category &quot;Best Major European Festival&quot;, in 2011 and 2014.

In 2002, Sziget branched out to Transylvania when its organisers co-created a new annual festival there titled Félsziget Fesztivál (Romanian: &quot;Festivalul Peninsula&quot;) that soon became the largest of its kind in Romania. In 2007, the organisers co-created Balaton Sound, an electronic music festival held on the southern bank of Lake Balaton that quickly gained popularity.

== History ==

Following the end of the Communist era in 1989, the formerly lively summer festival scene in Budapest faced a crisis due to a sudden loss of governmental funding. A group of artists and rock enthusiasts proposed the Sziget event as a way to bridge this gap. The festival was started in 1993, originally called &quot;Diáksziget&quot; (Student Island). This first event was organised by music fans in their spare time and ran well over budget, taking until 1997 to repay the losses. From 1996 to 2001 it was sponsored by Pepsi and renamed &quot;Pepsi Sziget.&quot; It has been called &quot;Sziget Fesztivál&quot; (&quot;island festival&quot;) since 2002.

A comprehensive survey was done and published on the risktaking behaviour and mood of Sziget visitors (2007) by the National Institute for Health Promotion (OEI). The survey revealed amongst others that the last sexual encounter of 9.4% of its participants was unprotected.

Sziget Festival is notable in that it contains acts from many different genres. 2006 saw, among others, a blues stage, a jazz tent, a world music stage, alongside the main stage with more typical popular rock acts.

The festival is popular with west Europeans. Around 50% of visitors come from outside Hungary, with the largest group coming from the Netherlands. Many also come from Belgium, the UK, Germany, Italy, France, Ireland and Romania.

Being located on an island, some festival goers have tried to enter by swimming across the Danube or by paddling across in inflatable rafts. The organisers discourage these attempts as it is dangerous due to the tricky nature of the fast-flowing Danube river.

In 2024, an American private equity group, KKR has agreed to buy the company behind Sziget Festival (together with other European music festivals).

== 2008 ==
In 2008, Sziget Festival lasted from 11 to 18 August. The festival, instead of 7+1 days as in 2007, was 5+2 days long, with a &quot;zeroeth day&quot; that featured one major gig (Iron Maiden) and a special &quot;minus first day&quot; called &quot;Day of Hungarian Songs&quot; that headlined a number of popular Hungarian rock bands (including LGT and Beatrice). As well as Iron Maiden, R.E.M., Mass Hysteria, Babyshambles, Sex Pistols, Jamiroquai, Anti-Flag, Flogging Molly, Alanis Morissette, the Killers, the Kooks, Kaiser Chiefs, the Cribs, Speak and many other were also confirmed, the day of their performance is available at the Sziget website. The length of the festival was reduced so that the residents living in the neighborhoods nearby would have less trouble because of the noise. The organizers plan to take further steps to reduce noise: the metal stage will be open until 11 pm only and noise filtering walls will be built near the noisiest stages.

==2009==
Sziget 2009 was 10–17 August 2009. The festival had a 5+2 day schedule again. The &quot;zeroeth day&quot; had a Rock Against Racism concert, featuring mostly Hungarian bands. The &quot;minus first day&quot; had one major gig again, this time the 20th anniversary concert of Hungarian rock band Tankcsapda.

==Lawsuit==
Dr. Tamas Derce, the mayor of Újpest, the 4th district of Budapest, has sued Sziget Festival, claiming that the event is so loud the locals cannot sleep at night. The mayor wants to force the organisers by court decision to cease every program between 6 pm and 10 am - which virtually means closing down the festival. The mayor already lost a similar case against Sziget at court in 2002.
The organizers of the 2008 festival promised local officials that the main stage will shut down at 11 pm and no music on that stage will be played after that. For this reason the Iron Maiden concert was taken from its original starting time of 9:30 pm to 9:00 pm.

== Previous years ==

==Other activities==
In addition to music, the festival offers a plethora of other activities including cinema, dance, theatre, tattooing, Internet access, volleyball, tennis, football, indoor rowing, rock climbing, bungee jumping and a life-sized foosball.

The island is located in the city of Budapest allowing trips to the city centre during the day.

<text>Camarones is a station along Line 7 of the Mexico City Metro. It is located in Colonia Barrio Santa Cruz Acayucan district in the Azcapotzalco borough, north of Mexico City, Mexico. The station was opened with the others along the northern portion of Line 7 on 29 November 1988.

Its name and logo come from a town that once existed nearby, the town of Camarones. &quot;Camarón&quot; means shrimp, a name given because the adjoining river was home to a plentiful species of shrimp, known locally as &quot;Acociles&quot; (&quot;Cambarellus montezumae&quot;), which were part of the prehispanic, colonial and early 20th century diet of the inhabitants of Mexico City.
Near Camarones metro station is the Mexico City oil refinery. It also connects with trolleybus line I, which runs between Metro Chapultepec and Metro El Rosario.

<text>William Wilkinson Wardell (1823–1899) was a civil engineer and architect, notable not only for his work in Australia, the country to which he emigrated in 1858, but for a successful career as a surveyor and ecclesiastical architect in England and Scotland before his departure.

In Australia, Wardell designed many public buildings. Most notable were St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, Melbourne; Government House, Melbourne; St John&#x27;s College, University of Sydney and St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral, Sydney. He worked in both the Gothic and classical styles. Wardell not only constructed major works in the public sector, he also maintained a large private practice building houses and business premises for private individuals. He was Inspector-General of Public Works and Building, for the Colony of Victoria, from 1861 until 1878. As an architect he is often compared with his friend and English counterpart Augustus Pugin, with the vast majority of his buildings completed in the Gothic Revival architectural style.

== Early life in London ==
Wardell was born in 1823; his birth date is not recorded, but he was baptised the following year, on 3 March 1824. As a young man, Wardell studied under the Gothic architect Augustus Pugin. Pugin became his friend and mentor, and was to inspire him not only in architecture but also in his religious convictions. Mixed in the artistic and literary circles of London, he fell in with the philosophies of the Oxford and Cambridge movement, which taught (amongst other things) that Gothic architecture, as symbolized by the great medieval cathedrals of England, was the only form of architecture worthy of God and fostered a spirituality that made it easier to communicate with God. In 1843 Wardell made the then conventionally unusual decision to convert from Anglicanism to Roman Catholicism, adopting the motto &quot;Inveni Quod Quaesivi&quot; (&quot;I have found that which I sought&quot;). This would have been a very difficult decision to make at the time; while Catholics were not actively persecuted in Britain at the time, there was still open discrimination against the Faith in certain political and business quarters. The leader of the Oxford movement, John Henry Newman, did not himself make the leap of faith until 1845.

Wardell&#x27;s conversion to the Roman Catholic faith was the result of a period of deep internal reflection. This affiliation to a more high church ritual was manifested in his architectural interests which concentrated on the more Gothic designs of England&#x27;s medieval architecture. For the remainder of his life he saw architecture as a means of praising God. He always had a room in his home set aside as a chapel for personal devotion which he visited several times during the course of a day. Dominating this room was an ancient carved wooden French cross that now belongs to the Melbourne Diocesan Historical Commission, who also own several other mementos of his personal devotion. Wardell also wrote, in particular two prayers devoted to the Virgin Mary, who he seems to have regarded as his especial saint. It is known that he frequently prayed for help and guidance when working on plans of church buildings.

On 7 October 1847 Wardell married Lucy Ann Butler, the daughter of William Henry Butler, a wine merchant and one time Mayor of Oxford. The couple married at St Mary&#x27;s Catholic Church, Moorfields in the City of London and are known to have had eleven children.

==Architectural career==
===London office===

By the time of his marriage aged 23, Wardell was already independently practicing as an architect. Between 1846 and 1858 he designed, restored or re-ordered about 30 churches in the UK, a rapid success. As this was an era of massive church restoration (Nikolaus Pevsner has said many churches were &quot;over-restored&quot; during this time) it is possible that this high figure may include churches Wardell only redesigned or restored. Whatever the true number of churches he designed in England, this was a period not only of church restoration but also building of many new Roman Catholic Churches. Wardell&#x27;s work wasn&#x27;t just limited to England though. He was commissioned by Robert Hope-Scott and his wife, of Abbotsford, Melrose, to build a church for the growing Roman Catholic community in the nearby town of Galashiels, Scotland. The designs drawn, work began in 1856 and wouldn&#x27;t be completed for another 20 years. Our Lady &amp; Saint Andrew&#x27;s is still in use as the Parish Church to this day. Wardell and John Newman were by no means the only converts to Catholicism; a large number of notable intellectuals too changed their faith. This, coupled with the greater freedom Catholics obtained by the Catholic Emancipation Act which restored the hierarchy and removed some of the prohibitions on Catholics which had prevailed since the time of the reformation, led to the Catholic Church having a revival in Britain. Thus the newly converted Pugin and his protégé Wardell were well placed to receive the numerous commissions which came flooding in.

The heritage-listed Church of St Birinus in Bridge End, Dorchester-on-Thames, Oxfordshire was constructed between 1846 and 1849. This church was one of the first Roman Catholic churches built following the passing of the 1839 Catholic Emancipation Act. The small and simple building is an almost exact replica of a 14th-century Gothic chapel. It is constructed of Littlemore stone with a Caen stone porch. The interior has rectangular nave leading in the traditional fashion through a rood screen to a smaller and lower ceilinged chancel. The nave has a vaulted ceiling supported by wooden strapwork. Lit by stained glass windows, the whole structure hardly differs from the design of Anglican churches constructed in the same period. The expected paraphernalia of the more ritualistic Catholic worship is absent; side chapels and numerous secondary altars are conspicuous by their absence. The only contemporary jarring feature not found in an English country church is the set of late Byzantine style gilt chandeliers.
He designed several London churches. Another heritage-listed church is Our Ladye Star of the Sea, Greenwich, a Gothic Revival church begun in 1846 and completed . It is surmounted by a tower completed by an ornate spire which in turn is complemented by the smaller spire of the adjacent stair turret. The church has remarkable architectural similarities to Wardell&#x27;s later and largest work, St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral in Melbourne. Also heritage-listed is Our Immaculate Lady of Victories (also known as St. Mary&#x27;s Church), situated in Clapham Park Road, Clapham, South London, constructed between 1848 and 1851, the same year that Wardell completed Holy Trinity, Hammersmith. From 1853 to 1854, he designed St Mary&#x27;s Church in Chislehurst, where Napoleon III was buried from 1873 to 1888. Other Grade II* listed heritage buildings designed in part or full by Wardell include the Church of St Mary and St Michael in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets; the Roman Catholic Church of St Peter and St Edward in Palace Street, Westminster; the Gate Lodge and Gateway, the Training College, the Priory, the former convent building, and the chapel at the former convent of the Holy Child Jesus on Magdalen Road in Hastings; &quot;Ellingham&quot;, a house in Thanet, Kent; the Old Lodge and Chapel of the Sacred Heart of Digby Stuart College; a lodge at &quot;Grove House&quot; in the London Borough of Wandsworth; the Spode Pottery including buildings around the north west courtyard, including the entrance gate, gate piers and remains of the bottle kiln at Stoke-on-Trent; and a chantry chapel for family burials commissioned by Lord Petre at Thorndon Park, near Brentwood, Essex, his last completed work in England.

By 1858, aged 35, Wardell was in poor health, and felt that the warmer climate of Australia would be more beneficial to his health. Obtaining the position of &quot;Government Architect&quot; to the city of Melbourne in Victoria, Australia, Wardell and his family emigrated.

=== In Melbourne ===

Melbourne in the early 1850s was a rough and primitive place with potholed roads. Robbery was commonplace, and the poverty caused by the soaring inflation, and streets that were in 1854 described as open sewers ensured that disease was rife. It was into this environment came men seeking fortunes digging for gold. Within ten years the gold rush had transformed Melbourne from a provincial outpost of the British Empire to a wealthy and rapidly expanding city. Between 1853 and 1854 Melbourne doubled in size, however many of its new and expanding population lived in tented villages within the city. This need for building coupled with available funding drew aspiring young architects from around the world, among them John James Clark, Peter Kerr and in William Wilkinson Wardell.

As the newly arrived and appointed Government Architect, Wardell immediately began work on St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, a task which was to occupy him for much of his life. In 1867 the Wardell Family moved into a large new house known as &quot;Ardoch&quot;, at 226 Dandenong Road, St Kilda, at the time one of the smartest and most expensive residential areas of Melbourne. The 13-roomed two-storied house in an Italianate style was built for £225 in 1864. The Wardell family purchased it in 1867 and moved from their previous home in Powlett Street, East Melbourne. Wardell designed both the Catholic churches dedicated to St Mary in St Kilda East where he personally worshipped. The first was completed in 1859 and its larger replacement completed in 1897.

In Melbourne, Wardell was not only the state-employed Government Architect, but also had a flourishing private practice as well, building houses, shops, and business premises for all who could afford him. He did not work in any one exclusive style, and could design in any architectural form his patrons required - Palladian, Neoclassical plus the various forms of Gothic, including notably at the ANZ Bank the floral Venetian Gothic.

In 1877 Sir Graham Berry became the premier of Victoria. His mission, considered radically left wing at the time, was to redistribute the grazing land of Victoria, and to introduce a bill providing for the payment of members of the Legislative Assembly, which would enable working-class candidates to be elected. When his aims were rejected by the Legislative Council, he embarked on a public campaign of &quot;coercion&quot;. &quot;We coerce madmen,&quot; he said, &quot;we put them into lunatic asylums, and never was anything more the act of madmen than the rejection of the Appropriation Bill.&quot; On 8 January 1878, known afterwards as &quot;Black Wednesday&quot;, his &quot;coercing&quot; began. Using the reasoning that without his bill civil servants could not be paid, Berry began to dismiss public servants, starting with police and judges. Wardell&#x27;s was one of the many heads which fell - dismissed from office, he left Melbourne to seek employment in Sydney.

During his time in Melbourne, Wardell designed numerous buildings, including 14 parish churches, in both the private and public sectors. While St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral is the largest and best known, other notable buildings are listed below.

====St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral====

St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral is the tallest and largest church in Australia, and a fine example of Gothic Revival.

It was the third church designed for the site. Bishop James Alipius Goold commissioned the first in 1850, delayed by labour shortages caused by the Gold rush, and in 1858; he then laid the foundation stone for a second, larger, church partly completed by 1858, when he instructed the newly arrived Wardell to design a cathedral, incorporating as much as possible of the partly completed church, and in December 1858 the new plans were accepted and work commenced.

Wardell&#x27;s design is a fine essay in the mid 19th century Gothic Revival style, drawing inspiration from the mediaeval cathedrals of Europe and England. The nave is Early English in style, with traceried windows more typical of the later Decorated Gothic, while the apsidal chevet chapels, ambulatory and sanctuary, are based on French models.

St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral became Wardell&#x27;s life&#x27;s work and his most notable commission. The original plans remained unaltered during construction, while construction proceeded slowly. The nave and its aisles were completed just ten years later, but the church was not consecrated for use until 1897. At the time of his death in 1899, Wardell was still working on designs for the minor altars and fixtures and fittings. The spires however were not built until 1937–39, and are taller than he envisaged.

====The Gothic Bank====
Wardell&#x27;s Venetian Gothic style headquarters for the ES&amp;A Bank (later the ANZ Bank), located in the heart of the financial district on the corner Collins and Queen Streets in Melbourne, is said to be the finest secular Gothic Revival building in Australia. Built between 1883 and 1887, it housed the bank&#x27;s main branch banking chamber and a residence above for the bank&#x27;s Australian manager, Sir George Verdon, who was deeply involved in the design. It cost £77,000, nearly twice the original budget. Where the exterior is restrained, featuring plain ashlar stone wall surfaces broken only by the traceried windows of the chamber and the residence, and notably the Venetian tracery of the first floor loggia, and a slim corner octagonal tower, the interior is elaborate and colourful. The banking chamber structure of a grid of cast iron columns, beams and connecting gothic-styled arches is frankly expressed, and all surfaces above the individually designed gold leaf foliated capitals are elaborately painted in tones of blue with gold leaf highlights. In 1987 it was voted Victoria&#x27;s favourite building by readers of &quot;The Age&quot; newspaper.

==== Government House ====

Government House in Melbourne is the largest and grandest Government House, and one of the finest examples of the Italianate style, in Australia. The building includes the official residence of the governor of Victoria, and an enormous ballroom that has been the venue for numerous state and national official functions over its life. Wardell was the chief architect, assisted by J.J. Clark and Peter Kerr; work commenced in 1871 and it was declared open at a ball attended by 1,400 people in 1876. It served for a time as the official residence of the Governor General of Australia after Federation, from 1902 until finally regaining its original use in 1934.

Government House was designed by Wardell in the Victorian Italianate style; its likely inspiration was Queen Victoria&#x27;s summer residence Osborne House on the Isle of Wight, England, built between 1845 and 1851, inspired by palazzi of the Italian Renaissance, which has similar detailing, picturesque massing, campanile-style towers, and royal associations.

Government House is located on a hill in the centre of parkland just south of the central city, visible from many points around inner Melbourne. It consists of three separately articulated blocks housing different functions, each with their own entrance, asymmetrically arranged with a dominant central tall belvedere tower. The three-storey principal block contains the state rooms for official entertaining, a secondary two-storey wing to the north contains the private apartments of the vice-regal family. The façade of the principal block features columned and pedimented windows indicating the piano nobile, a defining feature of the Italianate style. The two storey ballroom block stretches south of the main block and the tower, and is entered through a large arcaded and columned porte-cochere. The ballroom is said to have been the largest in the British Empire. The interior of Government House is elaborately decorated in contrast to the chaste lines of the exterior.

=== In Sydney ===


Wardell arrived in Sydney in 1878. He designed many buildings, the most notable being St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral and St John&#x27;s College at The University of Sydney.

==== St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral ====

St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral is slightly larger than St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, and is the largest ecclesiastical building in Australia. Wardell designed the cathedral in the Gothic style. Work began in 1868 while Wardell was still based in Melbourne. Work continued throughout Wardell&#x27;s lifetime, the cathedral finally being completed in 1928. In 2000 the spires Wardell had intended, a scheme abandoned due to lack of finance, were finally constructed.

==== St John&#x27;s College ====

In February 1859 Wardell was appointed architect for St John&#x27;s College. Working from Melbourne, he drew up the general plans and sent them to Sydney in May 1859. Wardell designed St John&#x27;s College as a three-storeyed sandstone Gothic Revival building on an H-shaped plan but because of budget restrictions with a limit of A£30,000, July and August saw discussion of Wardell&#x27;s design and of how much could be built within the budget. In September and October the general plans were approved by the St John&#x27;s Council and the University Senate. During the period from October 1859 to April 1860 relations between Wardell and the Council deteriorated for various reasons, ultimately ending with Wardell&#x27;s resignation in June 1860.

==== Other buildings ====
The ASN Co building is a large warehouse at 1-5 Hickson Road, The Rocks, Sydney. Designed by Wardell in the Pre-Federation Anglo Dutch style for the Australasian Steam Navigation Company and completed in 1885, it had distinctive Flemish gables and a bell tower, which has ensured it has &quot;long been regarded as a significant Sydney landmark&quot;.

Wardell also designed the New South Wales Club House building at 31 Bligh Street in the Victorian Academic Classical style, completed in 1884; and is currently occupied by the Lowy Institute. He also designed significant 1881 extensions to the Grafton Bond Store in , Sydney.

In 1883 Wardell designed the English, Scottish and Australian Bank at 131–135 George Street, The Rocks. The two storey sandstone building was completed in 1885 and is a rare example of Venetian Gothic Revival in Sydney.

== Architectural legacy ==
Wardell died at his home, Upton Grange, in Edward Street, North Sydney on 19 November 1899 of heart failure and pleurisy. He is buried in the Catholic section of Gore Hill Cemetery. He did not live long enough to see the final finishing touches to St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, and St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral was far from finished. His legacy to Australia has been to give that country two cathedrals which rank among the finest modern examples of gothic architecture. St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral is considered one of the few Australian buildings to be of world significance. However, Wardell&#x27;s work was more than the design of two cathedrals, his work was versatile and skilful in both the Gothic and classical styles and has given both Sydney and Melbourne some of their most distinguished 19th-century buildings.

The Victorian Chapter of the Australian Institute of Architects honours Wardell by presenting the William Wardell Award for Public Architecture at the Victorian Architecture Awards.

<doc id="1327509" wikidata="Q83638" url="?curid=1327509" title="Sebastian Larsson">
<text>Bengt Ulf Sebastian Larsson (; born 6 June 1985) is a Swedish former professional footballer who played as a midfielder. Beginning his career at hometown club IFK Eskilstuna, Larsson was signed by Arsenal. He made three Premier League appearances for the Gunners, before joining Birmingham City, initially on loan for the 2006–07 season, before a permanent transfer in the winter of 2007. Larsson spent five years at Birmingham, experiencing promotion to, and relegation from, the Premier League on two occasions. He joined Sunderland on 1 July 2011 upon the expiry of his contract, after Birmingham suffered relegation. He left Sunderland in 2017 to sign for Hull City in the EFL Championship where he spent one season. He returned to his native Sweden in 2018 to sign for AIK, and helped them win the 2018 Allsvenskan title before retiring in 2022. Larsson is renowned for being a set-piece specialist.

A full international between 2008 and 2021, Larsson represented Sweden at the 2008, 2012, 2016 and 2020 editions of the UEFA European Championship, as well as the FIFA World Cup in 2018, at which he helped his country reach the quarter-finals. He amassed 133 caps for his country, scoring ten goals.

==Club career==

=== Early career ===
Larsson was born in Eskilstuna and initially played football for his hometown team, IFK Eskilstuna. He joined Arsenal aged 16 during the summer of 2001, on a four-year professional contract.

===Arsenal===
Having been on the substitutes bench for a match against Panathinaikos, he made his first-team debut against Manchester City in the League Cup on 27 October 2004, where he played out of position at left back. He played in two further League Cup matches that season.

He made his Premier League debut on 1 February 2006, replacing Sol Campbell at half time as Arsenal lost 3–2 at home to West Ham United. Due to Campbell&#x27;s defensive errors in that match, Larsson started the next two league matches in defence in his absence, a 2–0 win away to Birmingham City three days later, and a 1–1 draw at home to Bolton Wanderers on 11 February, in which he was substituted for Dennis Bergkamp as Arsenal sought their equaliser.

====Loan to Birmingham City====
Larsson joined Championship club Birmingham City on a season-long loan from Arsenal in August 2006, with an option to make the move permanent. Larsson made an immediate impact, scoring late winners in his first few games, against Crystal Palace and Shrewsbury Town. He also scored two goals against Newcastle United in the FA Cup.

=== Birmingham City ===
At the end of January 2007, Larsson signed permanently for Birmingham City on a four-year deal for a £1 million fee. He scored Birmingham&#x27;s goal of the season, against Sheffield Wednesday in April 2007, running half the length of the field with the ball and finishing from inside the goal area.

In the 2006–07 season, Larsson was used mainly on the right wing, occasionally filling in at right-back or left-back when players were injured. His performances on the wide right of midfield in the 2007–08 season, in particular a man-of-the-match showing against Bolton Wanderers, indicated this to be his best position.

Recalled to the starting eleven by new manager Alex McLeish for the game at Tottenham Hotspur in December 2007, Larsson scored a spectacular stoppage-time goal to give Birmingham their first away win in the Premier League for over three months. He scored half of his six goals that season with direct free kicks, two in consecutive games, against Tottenham and Portsmouth, and one from against Liverpool. With four weeks of the season remaining, Opta statistics rated Larsson as the most accurate taker of a direct free kick in the Premier League, though this ability failed to save Birmingham from relegation.

On the opening day of the 2010–11 season, Larsson recovered from what the &quot;Observer&quot;&#x27;s reporter described as an &quot;anonymous&quot; start to provide assists for both Birmingham&#x27;s goals as they drew 2–2 with Sunderland at the Stadium of Light. He again provided an assist, this time for Craig Gardner, in his side&#x27;s first home game, a 2–1 win against Blackburn Rovers. Away to Fulham on 27 November, Alexander Hleb made &quot;a terrific run&quot; and a &quot;slide-rule&quot; pass to Larsson, who opened the scoring with his first goal of the season, a low shot across the goalkeeper. The game finished 1–1.

Larsson played his part in Birmingham&#x27;s run to the 2011 League Cup Final. He scored from the penalty spot before Nikola Žigić headed an 84th-minute winner in the quarter-final against local rivals Aston Villa. In the first leg of the semi-final against West Ham United, Liam Ridgewell scored from Larsson&#x27;s corner before Victor Obinna was sent off for kicking Larsson in the groin in an off-the-ball incident. Despite speculation over his future at Birmingham – with his contract due to expire at the end of the season, his advisor was given permission to talk to Newcastle United about a proposed move during the January transfer window, but personal terms were not agreed, and the player was booed when he came on as a substitute in the previous game, against Manchester United – Larsson returned to the starting eleven in place of the cup-tied David Bentley and played 100 minutes as Birmingham overturned a 2–1 deficit to win the semi-final 4–3 on aggregate. Roger Johnson flicked on Larsson&#x27;s corner for Žigić to give his team an unexpected lead in the final at Wembley against firm favourites Arsenal. Though Robin van Persie equalised, Obafemi Martins scored an 89th-minute winner to give Birmingham their first trophy since 1963.

Larsson took advantage of a defensive mix-up to open the scoring as Birmingham beat Sunderland 2–0 at St Andrew&#x27;s on 16 April, and four days later, marked his 200th appearance for the club in all competitions with a penalty, albeit in a losing cause, against reigning champions Chelsea. On 1 May, he exploited Michael Mancienne&#x27;s mistake to score the equalising goal against Wolverhampton Wanderers, helping his side earn a point despite playing with ten men for more than an hour after Gardner was sent off. No new contract was agreed, and following relegation to the Championship, the club confirmed that Larsson was to leave at the end of the season when his existing deal expired.

===Sunderland===
On 22 June 2011, Sunderland confirmed that Larsson would join the club on a free transfer under the Bosman ruling on 1 July, thus linking him up with former Birmingham manager Steve Bruce. He was given squad number 7 for the 2011–12 season. He marked his debut with the second-half equaliser in a 1–1 draw on the opening day of the season against Liverpool at Anfield, when given room at the far post to produce a &quot;superb first-time angled volley.&quot; His second Sunderland goal, direct from a free kick, put his team 4–0 up against Stoke City at the Stadium of Light in their first win of the season. Larsson scored directly from another free-kick against Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium a month later, prompting Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger to label his former player &quot;maybe the best in the league as a free-kick-taker.&quot;

He scored the opening goal in Sunderland&#x27;s 2–1 home defeat by Wigan Athletic on 26 November, which proved to be Bruce&#x27;s last game in charge of the Black Cats. Sunderland visited Wolves the following week under caretaker manager Eric Black. With Sunderland 1–0 up, Larsson won a penalty, although replays suggested he dived. His penalty was saved by Wayne Hennessey; less than 30 seconds later, Steven Fletcher equalised for Wolves, and went on to add a late winner. Larsson made amends in the following game, scoring from a free kick against Blackburn Rovers in injury-time to secure a late 2–1 win in Martin O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s first game as manager. Larsson scored another free kick on 8 January in the FA Cup in a 2–0 win against Peterborough United at London Road. In the fifth round tie with Arsenal, a quick counterattack from Sunderland saw Larsson hit the woodwork, and the ball subsequently hit Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain to put Sunderland 2–0 up and into the quarter-finals. Larsson scored twice as Sunderland drew 3–3 with Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium on 31 March.

Larsson produced a &quot;25-yard thunderbolt&quot; as his first goal of the 2012–13 Premier League season against West Ham United on 12 January 2013 in a 3–0 win. He provided the assist for Stéphane Sessègnon&#x27;s goal in Sunderland&#x27;s 1–0 defeat of Everton on 20 April, pushing the club clear of the relegation zone. The strike against West Ham proved to be Larsson&#x27;s only goal of the campaign, a season in which was underwhelming on both individual and club levels as Sunderland barely managed to avoid relegation.

His first goal of the 2013–14 season came on 6 November 2013, in a 2–1 win against Southampton in the League Cup. His first league goal of the season came against Manchester United on 3 May 2014, where he scored the only goal of the game. The result gave Sunderland their first win at Old Trafford since 1968. After contributing to Sunderland&#x27;s escape from relegation, he was given a new contract to run until 2017.

On 16 August 2014, Larsson scored a late equaliser for Sunderland in their 2–2 draw with West Bromwich Albion on the opening day of the 2014–15 Premier League season. His second goal of the season was a free kick to open the scoring in a 1–1 draw with Everton on 9 November, and his third, another direct free kick, came in a 2–1 loss at Tottenham on 17 December. Larsson was named Sunderland&#x27;s Supporters&#x27; Player of the Year for the 2014–15 season.

===Hull City===
After being released by Sunderland when their relegation from the Premier League coincided with the expiry of his contract, Larsson signed a one-year contract with Championship club Hull City on 9 August 2017. He made his first appearance for the club when he came off the bench as a 74th-minute substitute for Kamil Grosicki in the 4–1 home win against Burton Albion on 12 August 2017. On 30 September 2017, he scored his first goal for Hull City, when he scored the 6th goal in a 6–1 home victory over Birmingham City.

He was offered a new contract by Hull at the end of the 2017–18 season.

===AIK===
On 11 June 2018, Larsson signed for Allsvenskan club AIK. His first season with AIK was very successful, as he helped the team win the Swedish Championship for the twelfth time in the club&#x27;s history after claiming the 2018 Allsvenskan title. Larsson retired after the 2022 season.

==International career==

Larsson received his first call-up to the Sweden squad for the UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying games against Liechtenstein and Northern Ireland in October 2007. He was an unused substitute against Liechtenstein but did not make the bench for the Northern Ireland game. He made his debut for Sweden in February 2008, playing the whole 90 minutes of a friendly draw against Turkey in Istanbul. He was named in Sweden&#x27;s 23-man squad for UEFA Euro 2008, and has since become a regular in the national team.

He scored his first goal at senior international level in March 2011 as Sweden beat Moldova 2–1 in a Euro 2012 qualifier. During the qualifiers in October, Larsson added two more goals to his international tally. The first was the opener in a 2–1 away victory over Finland in Helsinki, and the second was a penalty as Sweden came from behind to beat the Netherlands 3–2 on 11 October at the Råsunda Stadium in Stockholm. In February 2012, Larsson scored two second-half goals to down Croatia 3–1 at the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb.

Larsson was selected in Sweden&#x27;s squad for Euro 2012. He started all three of their group games and scored the second goal in their 2–0 win over France, but Sweden did not make it through to the knockout stages of the competition.

Larsson was named in Sweden&#x27;s 23-man squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia. In the last warm-up match before the tournament, a goalless draw with Peru on 9 June, he made his 100th senior appearance for his country. At the 2018 World Cup, Larsson played in four games for Sweden as they were eliminated by England in the quarter-finals. He got his ninth international goal on 28 March 2021, scoring from the penalty spot in a 3–0 World Cup qualifying win over Kosovo.

Larsson started in all four matches of Sweden at Euro 2020, serving as captain in the absence of Andreas Granqvist. Following the tournament, he announced his retirement from international football.

==Personal life==
Larsson lives in Eskilstuna with his wife Tina. , the couple have two daughters.

<text>Bruce Roger Bent (born May 25, 1937) is an American businessman credited with inventing the world&#x27;s first money market fund, the Reserve Fund, with Henry B. R. Brown in 1970. Bent and Brown created an organizational structure by which investors could pool cash to gain access to the market for short-term money obligations. Money market funds now manage more than US$3.0 trillion, serving tens of millions of investors.

In the book &quot;One Up on Wall Street&quot;, published in 1989, Peter Lynch wrote that &quot;there ought to be a monument to Bruce Bent and Henry B.R. Brown&quot; in regards to their role in inventing the money market fund. The American Museum of Financial History, an affiliate of the Smithsonian Institution, also recognized the money market fund&#x27;s importance and impact on the nation&#x27;s financial history.

==Early life and education==
Bent was born and raised in Great Neck, New York. He attended St. Aloysius School and graduated from Great Neck North High School. After high school Bent worked as a mail clerk and carrier at the Great Neck Post Office and served in the Marines before attending St. John&#x27;s University. Bent graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in economics from St. John&#x27;s in 1961. He also created the world’s first money market system, and sold it for millions of dollars. Later on, he stated he regretted the sale and believed he should have given all of the money to hurricane relief foundations.

==Career==
Bent started his Wall Street career as a managing partner at LF Rothschild and Company Inc. Two years later, he began working at the pension firm, TIAA-CREF, where he met his eventual business partner, Brown. In 1968, the pair created their own firm, Brown &amp; Bent. In August 1969, while brainstorming about investment vehicles, Bent posed the idea for a mutual fund that could offer rates of return while allowing for zero market risk. The idea was to give investors immediate liquidity and safety for their money above all else.

In 1970, the firm launched its first money market fund, the Reserve Fund, to provide effective cash management, a dollar back for every dollar invested and beyond that a reasonable rate of return. The fund was launched with no sales force or advertisements, and instead relied on phoning investment advisers and handing out brochures. In January 1973, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published an article about their firm and by the end of the year it had $100 million in deposits. Brown left the company in 1985, but maintained stock in half the business. In 1999, Bent bought out Brown&#x27;s stake in the company and continued to run it with his sons.

The Reserve Primary Fund ceased operations on September 17, 2008 in relation to the collapse of the Lehman Brothers.

===Politics===
In 2001, Bent was the Republican candidate for Nassau County Executive. Before he was chosen as the Republican candidate, he received the endorsement of the Conservative Party and ran with little assistance from the county&#x27;s Republican Party. Promising to improve the county&#x27;s financial situation and work for a salary of $1 a year, he lost to Democratic candidate Tom Suozzi.

==Personal life==
Bent has two sons with his wife Nancy. In 1980, he endowed Bent Hall, a seat of the St. John&#x27;s University College of Business. Bent serves as a Trustee Emeritus for St. John&#x27;s University, where he is also a member of The Founders Society. He has also given guest lectures at New York University, The Wharton School, and Harvard University.

<doc id="1327517" wikidata="Q3395385" url="?curid=1327517" title="Ben and Polly">
<text>Benjamin &quot;Ben&quot; Jackson and Polly, sometimes called Polly Wright in spin-off material, are fictional characters played by Michael Craze and Anneke Wills, in the long-running British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. 

Ben and Polly, both from the year 1966, were companions of the First and Second Doctors. The duo was a regular in the television program from 1966 to 1967, appearing in 9 stories (36 episodes). Only one serial featuring the pair, their first &quot;appearance in The War Machines&quot;, is currently complete in the BBC archive. However, all but two of their missing stories (&quot;The Smugglers&quot; and &quot;The Highlanders&quot;) have seen DVD release, with both official animation and photo reconstructions utilizing the original surviving audio filling in the gaps. The characters returned in the 2017 Christmas special &quot;Twice Upon a Time&quot;, portrayed by Jared Garfield and Lily Travers.

==Fictional character biography==
===Television===
Ben and Polly first appeared in the First Doctor serial, &quot;The War Machines&quot;, where Polly plays the role of Professor Brett&#x27;s secretary. Brett develops the artificial intelligence known as WOTAN, and Polly meets the Doctor (William Hartnell) and Dodo (Jackie Lane) when they come to investigate it. Polly and Dodo became friends and he takes her to a London nightclub called the Inferno, where they meet Ben Jackson (Michael Craze), a Royal Navy Able Seaman serving aboard . Polly and Dodo try to cheer Ben up. When Polly is accosted by another patron in the Inferno, Ben comes to her rescue. Eventually, Ben and Polly aid the Doctor in his fight against WOTAN when the computer tries to take over the world. Ben and Polly inform the Doctor of Dodo&#x27;s decision to stay in 1966 and accidentally get carried away in the TARDIS when they try to return Dodo&#x27;s key to the time machine.
Polly, in contrast to Dodo, is a more sophisticated and hip young woman of the 1960s — vivacious, attractive, and alternately shy and aggressive. She and Ben make an odd couple but she is receptive to Ben&#x27;s protective urges, and he in turn finds her elegant and , giving her the nickname &quot;Duchess&quot;. Polly is present with Ben when the Doctor regenerates for the first time into a new form (Patrick Troughton), and they continue to travel with him. In &quot;The Highlanders&quot; (1966–67), Polly and Ben are joined on the TARDIS by Jamie McCrimmon (Frazer Hines). Eventually, the TARDIS finds its way back to 1966 London (in &quot;The Faceless Ones&quot;) on the very day Ben and Polly had left (although about a year had passed for them). They decide to remain behind to resume their lives without disruption as the Doctor and Jamie travel on.

What happens to the duo after their return to Earth is not certain. The Doctor seems to think that Ben will become an Admiral and that Polly will look after Ben, but it is unclear if this is a prediction or simply wishing them well. In &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot; story &quot;Death of the Doctor&quot; (2010), Sarah Jane mentions that Polly is now working at an orphanage in India with Ben.

Ben and Polly appear in the 2017 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; Christmas special &quot;Twice Upon a Time&quot;, portrayed by Jared Garfield and Lily Travers respectively. The episode&#x27;s plot involves the events of &quot;The Tenth Planet&quot;.

=== Other media ===
In the spin-off short story &quot;Mondas Passing&quot; by Paul Grice (in the anthology &quot;Short Trips&quot;) which takes place in 1986, it is revealed that Ben and Polly have gone their separate ways and married other people. In the short story &quot;That Time I Nearly Destroyed The World Whilst Looking For a Dress&quot; by Joseph Lidster (in the Big Finish Productions anthology &quot;Short Trips: Past Tense&quot;), it is shown that by 1999 Polly is divorced and has an estranged son named Mikey. However, She and Ben meet again at the end of that story and admit their love for each other.

== Development ==

=== Polly ===
Polly was never given a last name in the series. According to production notes, she was meant to be Polly Wright, but this was not used to avoid confusion with the Doctor&#x27;s earlier companion Barbara Wright. In &quot;The Faceless Ones&quot;, a double of Polly is named Michelle Leuppi; an apparent mishearing of this and misinterpretation of the context led to some reference works giving Polly the last name of &quot;Lopez&quot;. In the Virgin Missing Adventures novel &quot;Invasion of the Cat-People&quot; by Gary Russell, Wright is expressly given as Polly&#x27;s last name, as it was supposedly given in Gerry Davis&#x27;s character breakdown and audition script sample when, as story editor, he and producer Innes Lloyd created Ben and Polly in 1966.

<text>Alfredo Lorenzo Palacios (August 10, 1878 – April 20, 1965) was an Argentine socialist politician.

Palacios was born in Buenos Aires, and studied law at University of Buenos Aires, after graduation he became a lawyer and taught at the university until becoming a dean. 

In 1902, he was elected to the Buenos Aires&#x27; legislature, and in 1904, to the Chamber of Deputies for the 4th Circunscription of Buenos Aires, which corresponded to the &quot;barrio&quot; of La Boca, thus becoming the first socialist in the Argentine Congress and in the American continent. Palacios helped create many laws including the &quot;Palacios Law&quot; (&quot;Ley Palacios&quot;) against sexual exploitation, and others regulating child and women labor, working hours and Sunday rest.

Palacios was elected Senator in 1932, serving until the Senate was dissolved in 1943, and in 1955 was appointed ambassador to Uruguay. In 1960, Palacios was elected again as Senator, and as Deputy in 1963.

<text>Joshua W. Hill (15 April 1773 – 1844?) was an American adventurer.

In 1832 he arrived on Pitcairn Island which was first inhabited in the 1790s by British mutineers from and some Tahitians who joined them. The descendants of the mutineers had chosen to migrate back to Tahiti following the death of the last mutineer, John Adams, but had recently returned. Hill, taking advantage of the instability, was able to be elected President of the island. He served in that position until 1838. His rule became increasingly tyrannical, and he began imprisoning many of the island&#x27;s inhabitants. He was deposed and driven off the island in 1838, and the descendants of the original inhabitants took control of the island again.

Hill was probably the basis for the character Butterworth Stavely in Mark Twain&#x27;s short story &quot;The Great Revolution in Pitcairn&quot;.

<text>Joshua Hill (January 10, 1812March 6, 1891) was an American politician who served as a United States Senator from the state of Georgia.

==Early years and legal practice==
Joshua Hill was born in 1812, in the Abbeville District, South Carolina to Joshua Hill, Sr. and Nancy Ann Wyatt Collier. He attended the common schools, and upon graduation took up the study of law. In 1833 Hill moved to Monticello, Georgia where he establish a law practice. Hill married Emily Reid of Monticello in 1836, she was 16 years old. They had four daughters and one son. Fifteen years later, in 1848 Hill moved to Madison, where he would maintain a residence for the rest of his life.

==Political career==
===U.S. House of Representatives===
Hill is said to have had &quot;strong Whig and Unionist principles&quot; which aligned him with Whig Party until that organization dissolved in Georgia. Hill then became a member of the American Party (also called the Know-Nothing Party). The Know Nothing Party in his congressional district nominated Hill (without his solicitation) to run for the United States House of Representatives from Georgia in 1857, and it was under that banner that he was elected. He was re-elected to a second term in 1859, but resigned on January 23, 1861, shortly after the state convention passed an ordinance of secession in Georgia.

===Mayor of Madison, Georgia===
In 1864, Hill was elected mayor of Madison, Georgia. During the later stages of the Civil War, Hill lost his only son during the Atlanta Campaign in fighting near Lithonia, Georgia. When Hill went to retrieve his son&#x27;s body, he stopped to speak with General William Tecumseh Sherman, with a request that Union troops under Sherman&#x27;s command not burn the town of Madison which was on the path of Sherman&#x27;s March to the Sea. While Sherman agreed, the portion of his troops passing through Madison were under the command of subordinate General Henry Warner Slocum. When General Slocum approached Madison, Joshua Hill went out to meet him. General Slocum honored the agreement previously struck with General Sherman, and only burned the cotton gin, the railroad station, and anything that contributed to the war effort, but not houses.

===United States Senate===
Following the end of the Civil War, Hill was elected to the United States Senate from Georgia as a Republican in 1867. However, he did not serve in the Senate until 1871 when Georgia was readmitted to the United States. He served in the Senate until the end of his term in 1873 and did not run for reelection. He resumed the practice of law and died in Madison, Georgia.

Hill became the first Republican U.S. Senator from the state of Georgia. Soon afterwards, Reconstruction ended, and Georgia would not elect another Republican to the Senate until Mack Mattingly in 1980.

==Death and legacy==
Hill died in Madison on March 6, 1891, with interment in Madison Cemetery. He is remembered for his congressional work, obtaining the transfer of deed of the old U.S. Mint Offices in Dahlonega, Georgia to the fledgling North Georgia Agricultural College which later evolved into the University of North Georgia.

<text>Ha! Ha! Ha! is the second album by British pop group Ultravox, at that time known as &quot;Ultravox!&quot;, with an exclamation mark, as a nod to Neu!. Although the group would later achieve fame and commercial success with lead singer Midge Ure the band was, in 1977, led by singer/songwriter John Foxx who was accompanied by guitarist Stevie Shears, drummer Warren Cann, bassist Chris Cross and keyboard/violist Billy Currie.

==Release==
&quot;Ha! Ha! Ha!&quot; was released on 14 October 1977, and was accompanied by lead single &quot;ROckWrok&quot; backed with &quot;Hiroshima Mon Amour&quot;, which was released a week earlier. Neither reached the pop charts, although Island Records continued to have faith in the band. As a consequence of the album&#x27;s confusing typography – it is variously known as &quot;Ha!-Ha!-Ha!&quot;, &quot;-ha!-ha!-ha!&quot; and &quot;Ha! Ha! Ha!&quot; (which is the actual title), the group decided to abandon their exclamation mark for subsequent releases.

==Description==

Whilst the group&#x27;s first album had been a product of the David Bowie/Roxy Music-esque side of glam rock, their second was considerably more informed by the burgeoning punk movement, although it also marked the group&#x27;s first widespread adoption of synthesisers and electronic production techniques. Money from the first album was used to improve the band&#x27;s equipment, and funded the purchase of an ARP Odyssey and, most notably, a Roland Rhythm 77 (TR-77) drum machine, which appeared on the album&#x27;s final track, &quot;Hiroshima Mon Amour&quot;. This song was the most indicative of the group&#x27;s later synth-pop direction, and remains both a fan and critical favourite.
It was performed on the group&#x27;s 1978 &quot;Old Grey Whistle Test&quot; appearance and was covered by the Church on their 1999 covers album &quot;A Box of Birds&quot; and also by Jan Linton.

&quot;ROckWrok&quot; was the lead single. An unusually sensual paean to unrestrained sexuality, the song featured a chorus which began &quot;come on, let&#x27;s tangle in the dark/fuck like a dog, bite like a shark&quot; and lyrics such as &quot;the whole wide world fits hip to hip&quot; – despite which, it apparently achieved airplay on BBC Radio 1 on account of Foxx&#x27;s garbled vocal delivery and the song&#x27;s punky guitars.

Other songs included &quot;Fear in the Western World&quot;, which was also a punk number, with socially conscious references to contemporary global hot spots including Soweto and Ireland. &quot;While I&#x27;m Still Alive&quot;, although subsequently regarded by the band as the album&#x27;s weakest title, was particularly reminiscent of Sex Pistols, and specifically the vocal phrasing of John Lydon. &quot;Fear in the Western World&quot; also ended with a short burst of feedback – edited from a much longer take, in the manner of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; – which segued into the quiet piano opening of &quot;Distant Smile&quot;, which eventually developed into a conventional rock number, albeit using a similar vocal-synth fade as Pink Floyd&#x27;s contemporaneous &quot;Sheep&quot;. &quot;Artificial Life&quot; was reminiscent of Roxy Music&#x27;s &quot;In Every Dream Home A Heartache&quot;, with lyrics that examined suburban teenage life and tribes. &quot;Hiroshima Mon Amour&quot;, featured the saxophone playing of “c.c.” from the band Gloria Mundi, and includes the Roland Rhythm 77 (TR-77) drum machine working a modified bossa-nova preset by drummer Warren Cann, and foreshadowed the music both John Foxx and Ultravox were to make later, apart. In 2012, in an interview with peek-a-boo magazine, John Foxx agreed to say that it was the first synthpop/new-wave song in rock history: &quot;I think no one else had done a song like that before&quot;, he said. This was the last album featuring original guitarist Stevie Shears, who left the band early 1978, after the forthcoming &quot;Ha! Ha! Ha!&quot; tour.

<text>Arturo Lupoli (born 24 June 1987) is a former Italian footballer who last played as a forward for Borgo San Donnino.

His former clubs include Parma, Arsenal and Derby County, where he spent the 2006–07 season on loan.

==Club career==

===Parma===
Originally from Frattamaggiore, Lupoli began his footballing career with Italian side Parma. During his Allievi (Under-17) season he scored 45 goals in 22 games, one of the best tallies ever recorded in Italian youth history. However, by mid-2004 his contract had expired. Lupoli signed an Arsenal contract by way of a scholarship, the Gunners paid Parma £200,000 training compensation.

===Arsenal===
Lupoli&#x27;s debut in the Arsenal first-team was in a match against Manchester City in the League Cup on 27 October 2004. His next match, against Everton in the same competition, brought him his first goals for the club, two of Arsenal&#x27;s three goals in the 3–1 victory on 9 November. He also played in the match against Manchester United which saw Arsenal&#x27;s exit from the competition. He was Arsenal&#x27;s top scorer at youth/reserve level in 2004–05, with 27 goals in 32 appearances. That season he started Arsenal&#x27;s FA Cup fifth round replay against Sheffield United due to Robin van Persie, Dennis Bergkamp and Jose Antonio Reyes all being suspended, and Thierry Henry being injured. Arsenal went on to win the cup that year but Lupoli was left out of their final squad.

Lupoli scored prolifically at youth/reserve team level during the 2005–06 season, alongside Nicklas Bendtner. He also figured in the Gunners&#x27; 2005–06 League Cup campaign, winning the League Cup New Talent Award. He scored his third and final Arsenal goal in the 3–0 win over Reading in this campaign. It was during this season that he made his only league appearance for the Gunners, in a 1–0 loss at Blackburn.

Lupoli moved to Derby County on a season-long loan on 18 August 2006, and debuted for Derby in the 0–0 draw at home to Norwich City the following day. He then got a brace against Colchester United in a game which Derby lost 4–3. On 6 January 2007, Lupoli scored Derby County&#x27;s first hat-trick for over a decade in a 3–1 victory third round FA Cup tie against Wrexham.
Lupoli was linked with a transfer to either of the two Milan based football giants; A.C. Milan and Inter Milan. However, Pierpaolo Marino, General Manager of Napoli, announced he had Lupoli&#x27;s word he&#x27;d come to Napoli when his contract with Arsenal had expired, since it was his dream to play for his home city club. Despite this, on 26 February 2007, Lupoli signed a pre-contract with Fiorentina. Lupoli stressed, however, that he would do his absolute best for Derby for the remainder of the season, and in his first match for Derby after confirming the Fiorentina move, scored a goal and provided an assist.

===Fiorentina===
Lupoli finally completed his move to ACF Fiorentina on 1 July 2007, signing a five-year deal with the &quot;Viola&quot; in a free transfer. However, he never made his debut with the Tuscan side after joining Treviso F.B.C. 1993 on loan for a period.

On 22 July 2008, Lupoli moved to Championship side Norwich City on loan for the 2008–09 season. Manager Glenn Roeder&#x27;s connections with Arsène Wenger are believed to have been behind the club&#x27;s interest in the player.

===Norwich===
Following the finalisation of his loan move to the Canaries, Arturo told the club&#x27;s official website &quot;I am very happy to be here and hope to contribute for a great season for Norwich City and to be successful. I spoke to the Manager and I really feel that he wants me here. I know a lot about Norwich City – I was with Arsenal when they and my teammate David Bentley were in the Premier League and have followed their progress.&quot;

He took the squad number 18, and made his competitive debut for the club against Coventry City in a 2–0 loss. His first goals for the club came on 23 August 2008 versus 
Cardiff City at Ninian Park, as Norwich came from two goals behind to draw 2–2, Lupoli scoring both late on.

After spending a long time out of favour with manager Glenn Roeder, Lupoli publicly stated that he would leave the club in January if not given a run in the team. In the following game, an FA Cup tie against Charlton Athletic at The Valley, he proved his worth by coming off the bench to score Norwich&#x27;s equaliser after fans chanted his name throughout the match. However, after getting frustrated at a lack of first team football Lupoli&#x27;s loan was terminated on 2 February 2009.

=== Sheffield United ===
On 2 February 2009, Lupoli joined Sheffield United on loan until the end of the 2008–09 season. He made his debut for &quot;The Blades&quot; a few days later when he was given a starting role in the Steel City Derby against local rivals Sheffield Wednesday. He needed only five minutes on the pitch to find the net but despite scoring on his debut he was unable to prevent United&#x27;s loss to their bitter rivals. Although suggesting he wished to stay at Bramall Lane beyond the length of his loan deal he returned to Fiorentina after the Blades failed to clinch promotion having made eleven appearances and scoring two goals in a disappointing loan spell.

===Later career===
On 25 June 2009, Lupoli transferred to Ascoli in a co-ownership deal. Two years later, he transferred to fellow Serie B side Grosseto on a free transfer. In July 2013, after two years at Grosseto, Lupoli moved to another team of the same league on a free transfer, this time Varese.

On 21 February 2014, Lupoli joined Budapest Honvéd, and on 2 February the following year he was signed by Frosinone.

In summer 2015 Lupoli was signed by A.C. Pisa 1909. On 1 February 2016 he was signed by Lega Pro club Calcio Catania in a temporary deal. He returned to Pisa at the end of season, and on 27 January 2017, Lupoli signed a one-and-a-year contract with Lega Pro club Südtirol after being released by Pisa.

On 24 July 2019, he joined Virtus Verona.

On 26 August 2021, he joined Borgo San Donnino in Serie D.

==Career statistics==

==Notes==
:A. Soccerbase&#x27;s stats for the match between Derby County and Birmingham City on 9 March 2007 fail to include appearances by substitutes for either side, one of whom was Lupoli. Therefore, until and unless they correct it, he &quot;should&quot; have one more appearance for Derby than given on his Soccerbase page.

<doc id="1327575" wikidata="Q2165558" url="?curid=1327575" title="The One I Love (manga)">
<text>is a romantic, slice-of-life &quot;shōjo&quot; (targeted towards girls) manga by Clamp, an all-female, manga artist team consisting of Satsuki Igarashi, Mokona, Tsubaki Nekoi, and Nanase Ohkawa. Appearing as a monthly serial in the Japanese manga magazine &quot;Monthly Young Rose&quot; from December 1993 to June 1995, the twelve stories were collected into a bound volume by Kadokawa Shoten and published in July 1995. &quot;The One I Love&quot; contains twelve independent manga stories, each focusing on an aspect of love and accompanied by an essay. Ohkawa wrote the essays while Nekoi illustrated the manga; it was the first time she primarily illustrated a manga by Clamp. Some of the stories draw on the life experiences of the women while others take inspiration from conversations they had with friends.

In 2003, Tokyopop licensed &quot;The One I Love&quot; for an English-language translation in North America, and published it in October 2004. Viz Media republished the manga in February 2015. The manga has also been translated into other languages. Reviewers have identified a few themes in the collection. They had a range of reactions to &quot;The One I Love&quot;: some considered it heartfelt entertainment, while others reviewed it less positively, as a badly done take on romance.

==Plot==
Each story of &quot;The One I Love&quot; consists of seven pages of manga and an accompanying essay.
*: A girl asks to meet her boyfriend in the park after they have had a fight. She wants to apologize, but she does not know what to say. She wears a kimono instead. When she meets her boyfriend, she finds that he is dressed up too; he had the same idea as she did.
*: A girl reflects on the word &quot;cute&quot; with her boyfriend. She cannot visualize &quot;cute,&quot; so she does not understand why it makes her happy when he says that she is cute.
*: A girl has doubts about staying with her boyfriend, who has a very demanding work schedule. In the end, he skips work to visit her, and she decides that their romantic relationship will work out.
*: A young woman working at a bakery reflects on a past unsuccessful relationship with a younger man. In the end, a younger bakery worker asks her on a date, and she is hopeful that their romantic relationship will work out.
*: A girl working in a design company thinks about her past relationships, and one of her coworkers, whom she does not get along with. When a design job goes wrong and that coworker offers his ideas, she realizes that she is in love with him.
*: A girl reflects on her childhood sweetheart, who introduced her to playing the harmonica.
*: A girl panics as she decides what to wear to meet her boyfriend. When she is late to meet him, she realizes that her boyfriend always thinks she is pretty no matter what she wears.
*: A girl has a dream about her boyfriend ending their relationship, and she is worried that it is a premonition.
*: A girl confesses her love on Valentine&#x27;s Day.
*: A young woman has doubts about marrying her boyfriend. In the end, she realizes that even if they marry, nothing will change between them.
*: A young woman wonders if her long-distance boyfriend is being faithful. In the end, she finds out that he is very dedicated to her.
*: A young woman about to be married is nervous about her future. She is worried that she might change, but her husband reassures her that they will change together.

==Development==

&quot;The One I Love&quot; was developed by Clamp—the all-female, manga artist team consisting of Satsuki Igarashi, Mokona, Tsubaki Nekoi, and Nanase Ohkawa. The group decided on the theme of romance after considering the target audience of the manga magazine &quot;Monthly Young Rose&quot;, whose editors had asked them for a manga. For &quot;The One I Love&quot;, Ohkawa wrote the essays, and Nekoi illustrated the manga, the first time she primarily illustrated a series for the group. For costumes, Ohkawa used &quot;Anon non-no Olive&quot; as a reference. Additionally, the preview panels of each story featured different visual motifs, primarily girls and animals. In retrospective, Nekoi self-deprecatingly thought that her illustrations of the female protagonists, including working women, made them resemble junior high students.

Some of the stories in &quot;The One I Love&quot; contain autobiographical elements. &quot;Different&quot; and &quot;Cute&quot; draw on Ohkawa&#x27;s personal experiences, while &quot;Together&quot; draws on Mokona&#x27;s. Additionally, &quot;Suddenly&quot; is based on her admiration of manga artist Hagiwara Kuzushi&#x27;s dedication to his fans. &quot;Normal&quot;, &quot;Apart&quot;, and &quot;Insecure&quot; were inspired by Ohkawa&#x27;s conversations with friends, and &quot;I Miss You&quot; has its origins in a conversation with manga artist Okazaki Takeshi, who rarely saw his girlfriend because of his work. &quot;A Younger Man&quot; stems from Ohkawa&#x27;s conversation with actor Tonesaku Toshihide and his thoughts on men and age in a relationship. In contrast, &quot;Courage&quot; appeared as a Valentine&#x27;s Day story in the February issue of &quot;Young Rose&quot;; Clamp rarely had opportunities to create seasonal stories, as the magazine that typically serialized their work did not run seasonal stories.

==Release==
Written and illustrated by Clamp, the stories of &quot;The One I Love&quot; appeared as a monthly serial in &quot;Monthly Young Rose&quot; from December 1993 to June 1995. Kadokawa Shoten collected the stories into a bound volume, and published it on July 16, 1995.

In 2003, Tokyopop announced that it had licensed &quot;The One I Love&quot; for an English-language translation, along with four other manga by Clamp; it published &quot;The One I Love&quot; on October 12, 2004. However, on May 31, 2011, Tokyopop shut down its publishing branch in North America, with all of its Japanese manga licenses returned. Viz Media digitally republished the manga on February 10, 2015. &quot;The One I Love&quot; has also been translated into other languages, including French by Editions Tonkam, and German by Egmont Manga &amp; Anime.

==Reception==
A reviewer for Anime News Network, Mikhail Koulikov wrote that readers would have various reactions to &quot;The One I Love&quot;: he felt that some would regard it as &quot;charming&quot; and others would find it upsetting that the female protagonists were primarily defined by their worry over their relationships. While considering it one of Clamp&#x27;s minor works, he stated that it was &quot;unusual&quot; for including some colored pages when the majority of manga is printed in black and white; being a slice-of-life manga; and featuring Tsubaki Nekoi&#x27;s art, as prior to the time of his review, most of their works translated into English had been drawn by another member of Clamp. Koulikov wrote that &quot;insecurity and self-doubt&quot; served as the theme of the anthology. Johanna Draper Carlson, a reviewer for &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;, wrote that some of the stories were worrisome, particularly one that she felt &quot;justifies having an interest in whatever your boyfriend likes,&quot; and contained stereotypes as a result of limited space. She also stated that the essays included generalizations about women and &quot;quickly become redundant.&quot; In &quot;&quot;, Mason Templar suggested a possible theme of being one&#x27;s self in relationships, but felt that it appeared &quot;almost anti-feminist in execution,&quot; as only the female characters underwent a change in behavior. Templar rated the series one-and-a-half out of four stars, and criticized it as a naïve take on romance; Templar suggested &quot;Cardcaptor Sakura&quot;, &quot;Chobits&quot;, or &quot;Man of Many Faces&quot; as better examples of Clamp&#x27;s romantic manga. A reviewer of the French edition wrote that repetitive nature of the stories detracted from the manga&#x27;s appeal, and made for a &quot;laborious&quot; reading experience, although the reviewer felt that a &quot;romantic&quot; reader would not mind this. Conversely, another reviewer for Anime News Network, Liann Cooper, wrote that the stories were &quot;incredibly sweet and touching&quot; and were best read a few stories at a time. According to Cooper, &quot;The One I Love&quot; would appeal to fans of Clamp or &quot;shōjo&quot;, manga targeted towards girls.

<text>Tempe Town Lake is an artificial perennial reservoir located just north of Tempe Butte at the confluence of the intermittent Salt River and the ephemeral Indian Bend Wash in Tempe, Arizona, United States. The reservoir receives most of its water from the Colorado River through the Central Arizona Project.

On July 20, 2010, a portion of the west side of the dam that contained the water in the lake collapsed, sending a flood of water into the Salt River and draining the lake.

==History==

In March 1989, Tempe adopted the Rio Salado Master Plan which represented the culmination of more than 20 years of environmental land planning. Studies of water quality and usage, the Mill Avenue Bridges and ASU recreation ensued and programming began. A groundbreaking ceremony near Tempe Beach Park marked the beginning of construction of the river channelization. The Rio Salado Master Plan showed a Town Lake concept with a continuous body of water between the north and south shores. Previously, the lake concept included islands; this concept was modified to meet the flow capacity of the river channel.

In 1995, the city added more staff to the team dedicated to the Rio Salado project and began construction of a mile long bike path along the south bank of the river. The path features public art at a number of spots along the way. The city began the Town Lake design report and completed another financial capacity study and landscape designs for portions of the parks. The next year, the consultant completed construction drawings for the Tempe Town Lake and the city designated of area including the lake as Rio Salado Park. On March 19, 1997, requests for bids were sent out for the lake construction. The city awarded contacts for construction of the lake on June 12, and groundbreaking ceremonies were held on August 8.

Water from the Central Arizona Project (CAP) started flowing into Tempe Town Lake on June 2, 1999, and by July 14, the lake was declared full. On November 7, Tempe Town Lake was opened to the public.

==Tempe Beach Park==
Originally built in 1931, Tempe Beach Park was completely renovated in 1999 as part of the construction of Town Lake. The park connects to the of paths for bicycling, jogging or in-line skating that circle the lake.

===Activities===
The historic baseball field plays host to baseball and softball games, as well as carnival games.

In 2002, the $1.3 million Splash Playground was opened in Tempe Beach Park. The playground was both a way for kids to have fun in the water, and to learn about the water cycle before closing in 2017. The water kept flowing across the playground, where it was eventually collected, filtered, cleaned, and re-circulated in a state-of-the-art system.
The amphitheater accommodates 5,000 people for concerts or outdoor trade shows.

Boat Rentals of America operates its boat concession out of Tempe Beach Park.

Sailing classes are available from the Arizona Sailing Foundation (ASF), and sailing activities for all ages are available through ASF, Arizona State University Sailing Club and the Arizona Yacht Club. Private sailboat owners can launch their boats for sailing from the Tempe Town Lake Marina on the north bank of the lake. All boat owners must have permits for their boats from the City of Tempe.

Several rowing clubs practice and race on the lake, including Rio Salado Rowing Club, Arizona State University&#x27;s Rowing Club, Tempe Town Lake Rowing, and Tempe Junior Crew, as well as many private owners. All boat owners must have licenses.

The Arizona Dragon Boat Association, the Gila Dragons Dragon Boat Team and several outrigger clubs all have their home on the lake.
===Events===
Annual events at Tempe Beach Park include the Fiesta Bowl New Year&#x27;s Eve Block Party, Circle K Tempe Music Festival, Oktoberfest, APS Fantasy of Lights, Fourth of July fireworks show, and AVP Pro Beach Volleyball (now held in Glendale as of 2007).

There are numerous charity walks and events at Tempe Town Lake, including the AIDS Walk Arizona &amp; 5k Run and the Walk to Save Animals.

The lake is the host of multiple triathlon events, including the Tempe International Triathlon, Life Time Tri, and Ironman Arizona Triathlon. The Ironman Arizona Triathlon each November. The swim portion of the race is held in Tempe town lake.

Several regattas for rowing, sailing, and dragon boating occur throughout the year. There is also the annual Rowers Triathlon, which consists of a 4,000 meter erg piece, body circuits, and a five kilometer run.

==Description==
The lake was completed in 1999, using inflatable rubber barriers in the riverbed to confine water within its boundaries. It is nearly long, with an average surface area of , and an average depth of , for a total average volume of . The maximum depth of the lake reaches . The lake was initially filled with of water purchased from the Central Arizona Project. Evaporation and other water losses of per day are compensated through additional purchase of CAP water, exchanges of reclaimed water, and long-term storage credits. Seepage losses are virtually nil, thanks to a system that recaptures virtually all seepage and pumps it back into the lake.

A park surrounds the area, along with office and residential highrises such as SouthBank, Grigio, Northshore Condominiums, Onyx Tower Condominiums, Rio West, Plaza Del Rio and Hayden Ferry Lakeside. The lake has fishing and boating (by permit and by day rental which can be purchased at the Tempe Public Library). The lake also hosts a small marina on the northern shore. Tempe Beach Park is home to several major annual events including Tempe&#x27;s yearly Independence Day Celebrations and the Tempe Music Festival.

== Fishing ==
Tempe Town Lake is stocked with rainbow trout on a monthly basis from November to February. Other species found in the lake naturally include largemouth bass, yellow bass, tilapia, carp, channel catfish and bluegill. An Arizona fishing license is required to fish in the lake. All motor vehicles are required to have a four stroke marine engine.

== Emergency warning system ==

To keep users of the lake safe from flash floods on the river in the mountains upstream of Tempe, high winds, lightning, other severe weather and man-made disasters, an emergency warning system was needed.

The system combines weather information, weather sensors, communications equipment, visual warnings, audible warnings, and public education to help lake users assess their personal safety and respond accordingly. The Town Lake emergency warning system (EWS) is based on three scenarios; Watch, Warning, and Evacuation.

Each of the three steel towers contains Whelen outdoor warning sirens and strobe beacons used as a warning medium. Under high wind conditions, two white strobes will flash in accordance with wind speed. The higher the wind speed, the faster the flash. If lightning is detected in the area, a sensor automatically activates a amber colored strobe, and in the event of evacuation (i.e. weather, natural disaster, man-made disaster, dam break, or other emergencies), the sirens roar in the steady &quot;alert&quot; tone and the red strobe is activated. Both remain active until the lake is re-opened.

Each of the towers is powered by DC voltage, through a series of attached solar panels.

The system has been in operation since November 1999 and has successfully kept the lake safe during monsoon season and various emergencies, including the 2010 dam break and the 2020 train derailment on a bridge over the lake.

==Dam==

The prior dams were made up of three main elements:
* Strong, flexible, rubber coated fabric tube which is fixed securely to a concrete base slab by clamping bars and anchor bolts
* An operating system which controls inflation and deflation of the tube
* An automatic safety device which ensures tube deflation in flood situations

Each section of dam, or bladder, was about long, weighed , and was more than thick. At times, a small amount of water could be seen flowing over the top of the west dams, creating a waterfall. This water was then recaptured by a recirculation system and pumped back into the lake.


The east dams were high and sat on a concrete base. The west dams were high and sat on a base.

Tempe&#x27;s old dams were computer controlled to maintain air pressure of . They could be controlled individually to within and could be lowered incrementally depending on the flood conditions. Due to rapid deterioration of the west dams, the City of Tempe had worked out an agreement to replace them with manufacturer Bridgestone. Replacement costs were expected to reach $2.5 million USD. Work was scheduled to begin in the spring of 2010 in conjunction with a new $6.3 million USD pedestrian bridge that will cross over the tops of the west dams. However, due to the high amount of rainfall in the winter and upstream runoff in the spring, the project had been postponed until July.

In 2014 Tempe began work on a new dam west of the dam in place at the time. Construction was completed in the spring of 2016. The dam features seven steel gates, the largest of their kind in the world at over long and weighing .

=== Dam break ===


At approximately 9:45 pm MST on July 20, 2010, one section of the inflatable dam on the west end burst, thus releasing water up to into the normally dry Salt River bed. The lake began draining immediately. Emergency workers rushed to clear the area and the lake&#x27;s outdoor warning sirens started wailing, both within minutes. By the next morning the lake had lost about three fourths of its normal water. The dam breach left some areas of the lake with three feet of water or less; the average lake depth is about . Most of the 10,000 fish in the lake were swept downstream, but those that remained were expected to die within five days; fishing was not expected to resume until a year after the lake refilled.

City officials indicated that they expected to reopen the lake by November 1, and that if the lake was reopened by then, the dam collapse&#x27;s economic impact would be &quot;fairly light.&quot; The city indicated that replacements for two of the remaining bladders had already been delivered and would be installed as soon as possible. The replacement for the failed section was delivered to Tempe by the middle of August. The city built a cofferdam to allow the lake to be refilled while the northernmost bladder was replaced at a later date.

Some of the fish that had temporarily survived the dam break and were left stranded in shallow pools of water in the lake bed were scooped out and fed to a captive alligator in the parking lot of the Tempe Center for the Arts on Friday, July 23. Most of the fish removed from the lake were to be fed to other denizens of the Phoenix Herpetological Society, where the alligator has lived since 2005.

On October 8, 2010, SRP crews began refilling the lake. Water used to refill the lake was brought down the Salt River reservoir system from Roosevelt Lake east of the Phoenix area. Tempe officials chose to use a portion of their allotment of Lake water since the Lake was filled to capacity at the time. This method saved the city hundreds of thousands of dollars versus the alternative of filling it with Colorado River water from the CAP. After about two and a half weeks, the lake was reopened for normal water activities on October 26, 2010.

== Notable water releases ==
The Salt River bed in the Phoenix metropolitan area is often either dry or flowing to a trickle, with the river&#x27;s water being entirely diverted to agricultural and other uses upriver. Since Tempe Town Lake uses artificial structures and the natural riverbed to form the lake, the inflatable dams confining the lake must be lowered in periods of high runoff to permit the passage of the Salt River itself. The lake has released water on multiple occasions as the river levels rise normally due to heavy rain or winter snow runoff.

On December 31, 2004, the eastern dam was lowered for the first time since its construction. Heavy rains in the Salt River watershed required the release of of water per second into the Salt River. The dams are designed to handle a maximum flow of . Additional releases occurred in February 2005, January 2008, and February 2009.

== Tempe Town Lake Bridge ==
The Valley Metro Light Rail project began building this bridge (designed by T. Y. Lin International) over Tempe Town Lake, starting in the first quarter of 2005. The lighting ceremony for the bridge, which was the celebration for the completion of the most important parts of the bridge, was held on Saturday, December 9, 2006 during the APS Fantasy of Lights Boat Parade. The project was completed as of December 27, 2008, when the light rail line was officially opened to the public. The LED light display that occurs each time a train passes overhead at dark casts varying colors onto the lake, increasing the aesthetic quality of the bridge at night.

<text>Douglas Southall Freeman (May 16, 1886 – June 13, 1953) was an American historian, biographer, newspaper editor, radio commentator, and author. He is best known for his multi-volume biographies of Robert E. Lee and George Washington, for both of which he was awarded Pulitzer Prizes.

== Early life ==
Douglas Southall Freeman was born May 16, 1886, in Lynchburg, Virginia, to Bettie Allen Hamner and Walker Burford Freeman, an insurance agent who had served four years in Robert E. Lee&#x27;s Army of Northern Virginia. From childhood, Freeman exhibited an interest in Southern history. In Lynchburg, his family lived at 416 Main Street, near the home of Confederate general Jubal Early. The family moved to the former Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia, in 1892 at the height of the monument commemoration movement that memorialized Virginia&#x27;s Robert E. Lee, J.E.B. Stuart, and Thomas &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson.

In 1904, Freeman was awarded an A.B. from Richmond College, where he had been a member of the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity. In 1908, at the age of 22, he earned a Ph.D. in history from Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. Unable to secure a position in academia, Freeman joined the staff of the &quot;Richmond Times-Dispatch&quot; in 1909, and, in 1915, at the age of 29, he became editor of &quot;The Richmond News Leader&quot;—a position he held for 34 years.

== Writing career ==

===&quot;Lee&#x27;s Dispatches&quot;===
In 1911, when Freeman was 25 years old, he came into possession of a cache of long-lost wartime communications between Robert E. Lee and Confederate president Jefferson Davis. Freeman spent four years working on the documents, and in 1915, he published &quot;Lee&#x27;s Dispatches&quot;. The book was received enthusiastically by Civil War historians, and it became an important primary source for Civil War scholars.

Written between June 2, 1862, and April 1, 1865, Lee&#x27;s letters to Davis revealed the general&#x27;s strategy with clearer perspective, shed new light on some of Lee&#x27;s decisions, and underscored his close and always co-operative relationship with Davis. In his Introduction, Freeman summarized seven major revelations contained in the letters. For example, the letters reveal that the Confederate high command in 1862 considered but rejected a bold proposal to strengthen Stonewall Jackson&#x27;s army in the Shenandoah Valley and embark on a vigorous offensive campaign against the North, even at the expense of defending Richmond.

===&quot;R. E. Lee: A Biography&quot;===
Following the immediate critical success of &quot;Lee&#x27;s Dispatches&quot;, Freeman was approached by New York publisher Charles Scribner&#x27;s Sons and invited to write a biography of Robert E. Lee. Freeman accepted but chose to retain his position at &quot;The Richmond News Leader&quot; and work longer days to work on the biography.

Freeman&#x27;s research of Lee was exhaustive. He evaluated and cataloged every item about Lee, and he reviewed records at West Point and the War Department and material in private collections. In narrating the general&#x27;s Civil War years, he used what came to be known as the &quot;fog of war&quot; technique, providing readers only the limited information that Lee himself had at a given moment. That helped convey the confusion of war that Lee experienced as well as the processes by which Lee grappled with problems and made decisions.

&quot;R. E. Lee: A Biography&quot; was published in four volumes in 1934 and 1935. In its book review, &quot;The New York Times&quot; declared it &quot;Lee complete for all time.&quot; Historian Dumas Malone wrote, &quot;Great as my personal expectations were, the realization far surpassed them.&quot; In 1935, Freeman was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for his four-volume biography.

Freeman&#x27;s &quot;R. E. Lee: A Biography&quot; established the Virginia School of Civil War scholarship, an approach to writing Civil War history that concentrated on the Eastern Theater of the war, focused the narrative on generals over the common soldier, centered the analysis on military campaigns over social and political events, and treated his Confederate subjects with sympathy. This approach to writing Civil War history would lead some critics to label Freeman a &quot;Lost Cause&quot; historian, a pejorative reference to a pseudohistorical apologist interpretation of the cause of the Civil War that deprecates the central role of slavery. Freeman began work on his biography of Lee in 1926; by the time he had completed his four volume work in 1933, he had committed some 6,100 hours to the effort.

===&quot;Lee&#x27;s Lieutenants: A Study in Command&quot;===
Following the critical success of &quot;R. E. Lee: A Biography&quot;, Freeman expanded his study of the Confederacy with the three-volume &quot;Lee&#x27;s Lieutenants: A Study in Command&quot;, published in 1942, 1943, and 1944. It presents a unique combination of military strategy, biography, and Civil War history, and it shows how armies actually work. Published during World War II, it had a great influence on American military leaders and strategists. A few months after the conclusion of the war, Freeman was asked to join an official tour of American forces in Europe and Japan. &quot;Lee&#x27;s Lieutenants: A Study in Command&quot; established Freeman as the preeminent military historian in the country, and led to close friendships with United States generals George C. Marshall and Dwight D. Eisenhower.

===Biography of George Washington===
After completing his exhaustive studies of Lee, his generals, and the Confederate war effort, Freeman started work on a seven volume biography of George Washington. Applying the same approach of exhaustive research and writing narrative based on objective fact, Freeman completed the first two volumes, titled &quot;Young Washington&quot;, in 1948. The following year, he retired from journalism in order to complete his monumental work on Washington.

&quot;George Washington Volume 3: Planter and Patriot&quot; and &quot;George Washington Volume 4: Leader of the Revolution&quot; were published in 1951. The following year, he published &quot;George Washington Volume 5: Victory with the Help of France&quot; (1952). Freeman completed work on &quot;George Washington Volume 6: Patriot and President&quot; just before he died; it was published after his death in 1954. The concluding book, &quot;George Washington Volume 7: First in Peace&quot;, was written by Freeman&#x27;s associates, John Alexander Carroll and Mary Wells Ashworth, based on Freeman&#x27;s original research and was published in 1957. Historian and George Washington biographer John E. Ferling maintains that no other biography of Washington compares to that of Freeman&#x27;s work.

==Newspaper, radio, and teaching careers==
Freeman&#x27;s considerable literary achievements have overshadowed his career as editor of &quot;The Richmond News Leader&quot;. Between 1915 and 1949, he wrote an estimated 600,000 words of editorial copy every year. He earned a national reputation among military scholars for his analyses of operations during World War I and World War II. His editorials expressed a moderate approach to race relations, and in his editorials opposed the Byrd Organization—a powerful statewide Democratic political machine run by United States Senator Harry F. Byrd.

Freeman retired as editor of &quot;The Richmond News Leader&quot; on June 25, 1949. Years later, his obituary published in his former newspaper captured the scope of his editorial interests. 
In addition to his forty-year career in journalism, Freeman became one of the first radio analysts, in 1925. His twice-daily radio broadcasts helped make him one of the most influential men in Virginia. From 1934 to 1941, he commuted weekly by air to New York City to teach journalism at Columbia University. He also taught as a lecturer at the United States Army War College for seven years, and served as Rector of the University of Richmond.

==Personal life==
Freeman&#x27;s work ethic was legendary. Throughout his life, he kept a demanding schedule that allowed him to accomplish a great deal in his two full-time careers, as a journalist and as a historian. When at home, he rose at three every morning and drove to his newspaper office, saluting Robert E. Lee&#x27;s monument on Monument Avenue as he passed. Twice daily, he walked to a nearby radio studio, where he gave news broadcasts and discussed the day&#x27;s news. After his second broadcast, he would drive home for a short nap and lunch and then worked another five or six hours on his current historical project, with classical music, frequently the work of Joseph Haydn, playing in the background.

Freeman was a devout Baptist who prayed daily in the small chapel he built in his home. He acknowledged that his Christian faith played a central role throughout his life. Freeman was also a Virginian, and described himself as &quot;deeply rooted in the soil of old Virginia.&quot; He believed in the importance of continuity, even in personal geography, once writing, &quot;I think the American people lose a large part of the joy of life because they do not live for generations in the same place.&quot;

Freeman believed in the importance of a character. His definition of leadership was, &quot;Know your stuff, be a man, look after your men.&quot;
Freeman married Inez Virginia Goddin on February 5, 1914. They had three children: Mary Tyler, Anne Ballard, and James Douglas. Mary Tyler Freeman married Leslie Cheek, Jr., longtime director of the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, and became a founder or influential officer of several important community organizations, as well as president of the Robert E. Lee Memorial Foundation. The family lived (and Freeman died) in a mansion he named Westbourne in Richmond&#x27;s west end, a house listed (in 2000) in the National Register of Historic Places.

==Death and legacy==
Douglas Southall Freeman died of a heart attack on June 13, 1953, at his home in Richmond, Virginia, at the age of 67. On the morning of his death he had delivered his usual radio broadcast from Richmond. He was buried in Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond.

Freeman&#x27;s newspaper editorials and daily radio broadcasts made him one of the most influential Virginians of his day, his analysis of World War I and World War II military campaigns bringing him recognition throughout the country, especially in military circles. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt thanked him for suggesting the use of the term &quot;liberation,&quot; rather than &quot;invasion,&quot; of Europe.

Military commanders such as Admiral Chester W. Nimitz and Generals George C. Marshall, Douglas MacArthur, and Dwight D. Eisenhower sought his friendship and advice. Eisenhower said Freeman first convinced him to think seriously about running for the presidency. In 1958, Freeman was posthumously awarded his second Pulitzer Prize for his seven-volume biography of George Washington. In 1955, the Virginia Associated Press Broadcasters honored Freeman by creating the Douglas Southall Freeman Award for public service in radio journalism.

Eric Foner is more critical of Freeman, whose biography of Lee Foner calls a &quot;hagiography,&quot; criticizing its lack of nuance and the limited attention paid to Lee&#x27;s relationship to slavery. Charles B. Dew wrote that Freeman&#x27;s &quot;magisterial&quot; &quot;Lee&#x27;s Lieutenants&quot;, United Daughters of the Confederacy magazine, and &quot;Facts the Historians Leave Out: A Youth&#x27;s Confederate Primer&quot; by John S. Tilley were crucial titles in his adolescent indoctrination into the mainstream white Southern worldview of the 1950s.

In 2021, some students and faculty at the University of Richmond, where Freeman served as Rector for seven years, criticized the University board of trustees for refusing to remove Freeman&#x27;s name from a campus building, although he had &quot;supported racial segregation, opposed interracial marriage and promoted racist concepts underlying the eugenics movement.&quot; The &quot;greatest inheritance,&quot; Freeman once said, was &quot;clean blood, right-thinking ancestry.&quot;

<doc id="1327608" wikidata="Q771794" url="?curid=1327608" title="Thrust (video game)">
<text>Thrust is a 1986 video game programmed by Jeremy C. Smith (who later co-authored &quot;Exile&quot;) for the BBC Micro and published by Superior Software. The player&#x27;s aim is to manoeuvre a spaceship by rotating and thrusting, as it flies over a two-dimensional landscape and through caverns. The gameplay of &quot;Thrust&quot; was heavily inspired by Atari&#x27;s &quot;Gravitar&quot;.

&quot;Thrust&quot; was ported to the Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, Atari 8-bit computers, Atari ST, Commodore 16/Plus 4, and ZX Spectrum. Firebird released a sequel, Thrust II, in 1988.

==Gameplay==
The aim is to pilot a spacecraft which must pick up a pod using a tractor beam and fly it into space. The ship and pod are subject to gravity and inertia, and being connected by a stiff rod can end up spinning around each other, out of control. Hitting the walls of the cave with the ship or the pod results in death.

Each planet has turrets that fire bullets at the ship, which can be destroyed with a single shot. There is also a reactor that powers the defence system of each planet. If the reactor is shot enough, the turrets will cease firing for a short amount of time. Hitting the reactor with enough bullets causes it to go critical and destroy the planet in 10 seconds. The ship must escape into space before this happens, with or without the pod (more points are gained if the pod is present).

Fuel is needed to manoeuvre the ship and can be collected with the tractor beam; if the ship runs out of fuel, the whole game is over. A shield is also available, although when it&#x27;s activated, it expends fuel and the ship cannot shoot.

Later levels have doors that are opened by shooting a panel. After all six levels have been completed, the levels start again, but first with reversed gravity, then with the planet and walls invisible unless the shield is used, and finally with invisible walls and reversed gravity. After the 24th level is complete, a message is displayed. Two more messages are available after completing the 48th and 72nd level, and from then on the third message is repeated. On the BBC Micro implementation, the messages displayed are &quot;Support Hotol&quot;, &quot;Physics is fun&quot; and &quot;I love space&quot;.

==Release==
Before releasing the BBC/Electron version of the game, Superior Software licensed the rights to produce ports of the game to Firebird Software who published the game on their £1.99 budget label. Firebird&#x27;s C64 version was released first, reaching the top of the Gallup All Formats and Commodore 64 charts. Nine weeks later, Superior Software&#x27;s full price release entered the BBC Top Ten at number one.

Superior promoted their release with a competition. Prizes included a trophy, £250 in cash, and a book by astronomer Patrick Moore.

==Legacy==
Hobbyist-written clones were released for the Atari 2600 (2000) and Vectrex (2004) consoles using the same name as the original.

&quot;Thrust&quot; was credited by Bjørn Stabell as an influence on the game &quot;XPilot&quot;.

Jeremy C. Smith went on to develop the 1988 game &quot;Exile&quot; with school friend and &quot;Starship Command&quot; programmer Peter Irvin. He died in an accident four years later.

<doc id="1327615" wikidata="Q623998" url="?curid=1327615" title="Magnus, Robot Fighter">
<text>Magnus, Robot Fighter is a fictional superhero who battles rogue robots in the year 4000, appearing in comic books created by writer/artist Russ Manning in 1963. Magnus first appeared in &quot;Magnus Robot Fighter 4000 A.D.&quot; #1, published by Gold Key Comics in February 1963. The character was subsequently published by Valiant Comics and Acclaim Comics in the 1990s, and was reintroduced by Dark Horse Comics in August 2010. Some aspects of the concept have varied with each publisher.

==Premise==
By the year 4000, humanity has become dependent on robots. H8, the Robot Police chief of the civic sector of North Am, a continent-spanning mega-city, is damaged in a radiation accident. It seeks to promote the human dependency on robots and gradually impose totalitarian rule in the area under its control.

Magnus was raised by a robot known as 1A, a name which implies that he is the very first robot of his type ever manufactured. 1A seems to be self-aware and to possess emotions. A firm believer in the Three Laws of Robotics, 1A recognized the threat represented by the dependency of humans on robots in general, and the developments in North Am due to H8 in particular. Therefore, 1A trained Magnus to protect humans against both rogue robots, and humans who used normal robots for evil purposes. Magnus was trained from infancy by 1A in an under-sea domed house, using advanced techniques, to become a skilled martial artist who could break steel with his bare hands. In addition, 1A equipped his charge with a device that would allow him to &quot;hear&quot; robot-to-robot radio communications.

Leeja is Magnus&#x27;s girlfriend. Robots that served as police are called &quot;Pol-Robs&quot; (as in police robots) and are painted black and white like city police cars. All robots have identifying numbers painted on their chest and backs. Other robots, such as taxi drivers, could be nothing more than a torso with arms and head attached to a flying automobile.

==Setting==
Both the Gold Key and Valiant versions take place in North Am, a megalopolis that encompasses the entire North American continent. The city consists of several &quot;levels.&quot; The higher levels are populated by wealthier individuals, often regarded as &quot;soft&quot; and complacent. The lowest level, the Goph Level, is populated by a hardier and less educated class known as &quot;gophs&quot;.

Aside from North Am, Earth also features another continent-wide city in Europe and a city on the continent of Antarctica named Antarcto. The city consists of several transparent domes, inside each of which the climate is carefully controlled. Construction of these habitats was fiercely opposed, for fear of ecological damage to the fragile Antarctic system. As well, there is the area known as Himalhina, which apparently includes at least all of India and China. By AD 4000, the nation of Japan is home to 50 billion people. The major islands of Japan are covered by a single, contiguous structure known as the Host. Grandmother, a Freewill electronic network, controls virtually every facet of daily life.

==Gold Key==
===Original series===
The original series, titled &quot;Magnus, Robot Fighter, 4000 AD&quot;, premiered in 1963. It was written and drawn by Russ Manning, and as a nod to its influences, included Isaac Asimov&#x27;s Three Laws of Robotics as a quote in the beginning of the first issue. For the duration of the title&#x27;s original run, Magnus battled rogue robots, aliens, space pirates and other threats. He fell in love with Leeja Clane, the daughter of one of North Am&#x27;s senators. Leeja developed limited telepathic abilities after training by M&#x27;Ree and other humans who had acquired them as a result of their minds being linked together while imprisoned in suspended animation by H8.

The series was popular in the 1960s. As the &#x27;70s approached, sales began to decline. The last issue (#46) was published in January 1977. However, Manning only completed 21 issues; the rest were reprints of previous issues or new stories by others (#23–28).

During the first 28 issues, another series called &quot;The Aliens&quot; ran in the back of the comic. This series ended on a cliffhanger in Issue 28.

===Backup series===
In the early &#x27;80s, a new Magnus backup series ran in the new Doctor Solar title in issues #29–31. This was supposed to lead to a new Magnus title, but Gold Key stopped publication soon afterwards. Supposedly, there was work completed for two new Magnus issues (what would have been &quot;Magnus&quot; #47, 48), but these have never been published.

==Valiant==
In 1991, Jim Shooter obtained rights to three Gold Key characters: &quot;Doctor Solar, Man of the Atom&quot;; &quot;Turok, Son of Stone&quot;; and &quot;Magnus, Robot Fighter&quot;. He intended to use those characters to launch his new comic book line, Valiant Comics. Several months later, the company launched &quot;Magnus, Robot Fighter&quot;.

The series began where the original one left off. The artists took great care to replicate the setting and trappings of the original stories. But as the new series progressed, it began to deviate from the original concept. The term &quot;Freewills&quot; appeared in the Valiant run, introducing the concept that the rogue robots seen previously were not simply the product of random malfunctions, but were the result of a common phenomenon which allowed robots to become sentient. While some of them are malevolent, others merely want to be free. It was also learned that 1A is a freewill. With Magnus&#x27;s help, a colony of benevolent Freewills is established called the &quot;Steel Nation.&quot; At the same time, Magnus becomes disgusted with North Am&#x27;s elite. He journeys to the lower levels of North Am and befriends a group of social outcasts known as Gophs.

In 1992 Valiant published the popular crossover &quot;Predator Versus Robot Fighter&quot;. Valiant president Steven Massarsky recounted, &quot;We started this project in February [1992], knowing that this time of the year [John] Ostrander would be taking things over [in] &quot;Magnus&quot;, so we want to generate renewed interest in &quot;Magnus&quot;.&quot;

As the series progressed, it was used to introduce other heroes to the Valiant Universe. In issue #5, a Japanese hero known as Rai began appearing in Magnus&#x27;s title, and would eventually move on into his own series. In the sixth issue, the future version of Solar made his debut. The issue also introduced the spider aliens, who became a recurring threat throughout the Valiant Universe. In the 12th issue, modern readers were reintroduced to Turok, Son of Stone.

===Unity===
During the Unity crossover in 4001 AD, it was revealed that Magnus was actually born during the Unity conflict. His mother was Kris Hathaway and his father was the harbinger named Torque from whom Magnus would inherit his own harbinger ability and strength. Geomancer Geoff McHenry sensed that someone like Magnus was needed in the &quot;future&quot;. Solar &quot;moved&quot; baby Magnus through time and space to the actual Valiant Universe in 3975 AD and reminded himself to pick the baby up in 3975 AD, falling from the sky, and bring it to 1-A, his robot friend, so baby Magnus would be raised and trained to become the robot fighter that he is in 4001 AD. Lastly, Solar destroyed the black hole created by Mothergod and the Unity event thus sending the Lost Land and Mothergod to &quot;unreality.&quot;

===The Malev War===
Shortly after the Unity crossover, the future Earth was invaded by alien robots called Malevs (short for Malevolents) directed by the Malev Emperor, a giant hive-mind, introduced in the original series, that encompassed the planet of Malev-6 that was destroyed by Doctor Laszlo and Magnus. The Emperor took control of North Am&#x27;s mainframe to easily control all robs, turning them against humanity. This invasion forced all of the future heroes to band together. Their adventures were showcased in both the Magnus series, a spin-off title, &quot;Rai and the Future Force&quot;, and other tie-ins, for a combined 37 issues over two years (1993-94). 

After the Malev War ended, all future titles jumped twenty years forward. Magnus became the leader of North Am and the President of the Terran Consortium. He married Leeja (his love interest since the original series) and had a son, whom he named Torque. Magnus spent the rest of the series battling various threats. During the Chaos Effect crossover, he was transported to the 20th century, but he eventually returned to the future. The series concluded with Magnus being transported to an unknown time and place, while Torque took up his mantle as protector of earth.

==&quot;Deathmate&quot;==
&quot;Deathmate&quot; was a joint publication by Valiant Comics and Image Comics. In this continuity, Magnus was given the name &quot;Chris Torkelson&quot; and was a child raised and trained by Battlestone, who was working for the Harbinger Foundation. In this series, Magnus&#x27;s parents were both killed by Battlestone while trying to escape the Harbinger Foundation. Years later, Magnus would confront Battlestone about this, and fight him to more or less a standstill, while Geoff McHenry, the Geomancer of Earth, would lament that reality was literally coming to an end around them. The world ends as Magnus and Battlestone fight to the death.

==Acclaim Comics==
In 1995, Voyager Communications, the company that owned Valiant Comics, was bought by Acclaim Entertainment. At first, it continued publishing Valiant Comics titles, but sales began to plummet after the direct market crash and the comics division was shut down. &quot;Magnus, Robot Fighter&quot; was one of the last titles to be canceled.

In 1997, Acclaim Entertainment relaunched its comic book division. All Valiant Comics characters were altered and rebooted, including Magnus. This time, Magnus was re-imagined as an insane robot fighter who, in addition to the original&#x27;s strength and skills, had metallic blood that repaired his injuries. The series was much more comedic and self-parodying than any of the previous incarnations.

Two years later, Acclaim Comics closed, and Magnus&#x27;s title was one of the first to go, along with most of the line.

===&quot;Unity 2000&quot;===

In 1999, Acclaim Entertainment made a final attempt to revive its comic book line, and Jim Shooter was invited to write a &quot;Unity 2000&quot; crossover. Due to financial troubles within the company, only three issues of six were published. The Valiant version of Magnus played an important role in the crossover, while the Acclaim version was a background player.

==Later status==
In 2002, the rights to Magnus, Robot Fighter reverted to Random House, which, at that point, acquired Western Publishing&#x27;s assets. It made a contract with Dark Horse Comics to reprint the original series.

In 2006, ibooks Inc published a graphic novel (of novelette length) reintroducing the characters, with new extraterrestrial robotic foes. It is not currently known whether they will continue with further issues, in light of their recent bankruptcy.

In 2010, a comic that included Doctor Solar and Magnus was published for Free Comic Book Day.

The character Leeja was ranked 56th in &quot;Comics Buyer&#x27;s Guide&#x27;s&quot; &quot;100 Sexiest Women in Comics&quot; list.

==Dark Horse reboot==
In 2009, at San Diego Comic-Con, it was announced that Dark Horse Comics would begin publishing a new &quot;Magnus, Robot Fighter&quot; series written by Jim Shooter. The first issue of the revised series was published in August 2010, with artist Bill Reinhold.

== Dynamite Entertainment ==
As of the end of 2013, Dynamite had acquired the rights to Magnus along with three other Gold Key Comics characters: Turok, Doctor Solar and Dr. Spektor. On 6 March 2014, they published an online preview of the first issue. The first issue was written by Fred Van Lente, with art by Cory Smith and cover by Gabriel Hardman.

The series ran for twelve issues from March 2014 to March 2015.

In this version of the setting, Russel Magnus works in a bucolic alpine town as a middle school history teacher who also coaches the school&#x27;s martial arts team; as of the first issue he is trying to raise funds to get the team to a tournament in United Korea. He is married to Moira Magnus, a mechanic who works on industrial robots, and they are expecting their first child. Humanoid robots attend Magnus&#x27; school as students, as well as being integrated into a variety of purpose-built chassis. The inhabitants of the town interact with an omnipresent avatar of 1A that appears on ubiquitous display panels.

In June 2017, Dynamite launched yet another rebooted version of the character, this time a female psychologist named Kerri Magnus who is tasked with reintegrating rebellious robots, or &quot;AIs&quot;, into society. Her adventures were published in a limited series of five issues from June to October 2017.

<text>A Christmas village (or putz) is a decorative, miniature-scale village often set up during the Christmas season. These villages are rooted in the elaborate Christmas traditions of the Moravian Church, a Protestant denomination. In the tradition of the Moravian Church, nativity scenes have been the center of the Christmas putz, which is &quot;built to tell the Good News of the coming of the Christ Child&quot; and &quot;is the Gospel in miniature from Isaiah’s prophecy and Mary’s annunciation to the visit of the wisemen and the flight into Egypt.&quot; For Moravian Christians, the nativity scene serves to celebrate &quot;the story of the wonder of Christ’s birth so that the Son of God can be welcomed into the hearts of the home at the Christmas.&quot; Mass-produced cardboard Christmas villages became popular in the United States during the early and mid-20th century, while porcelain versions became popular in the later part of the century.

==History==

===Origins===

The tradition of decorative Christmas villages built around the Christmas tree is rooted in the late 18th century holiday traditions of the Moravian church, a Protestant denomination with early settlements in Salem, North Carolina and Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Karal Ann Marling writes that &quot;This usually took the form of an elaborate landscape with animals, which may or may not have alluded to the creatures in the stable at Bethlehem or the passengers on Noah’s Ark...the typical putz went beyond the limits of any biblical scene into pure, exuberant genre.&quot; These grew to encompass much more than a nativity scene, with animations such as working flour mills, jumping dogs, running water with waterfalls and electric trains, and could fill an entire room. Families would organize &quot;putz parties&quot; and compete for the best show. The term was derived from the German verb &quot;&quot;, which means &quot;to clean&quot; or &quot;to decorate.&quot;

===Mass production===

After World War II, several Japanese companies started mass-producing cardboard or paper houses, churches, and other buildings. These small buildings usually had holes in the back or the bottom through which Christmas lights were placed to provide illumination. The buildings had tiny colored cellophane windows and were decorated with mica-dusted roofs to give the appearance of snow. Since these buildings were made of inexpensive material and were widely available throughout the United States, they became a very popular Christmas decoration.

===Modern villages===

In the 1970s, ceramic or porcelain Christmas villages were introduced and started to gain popularity. Department 56 was one of the first companies to make these buildings and remains amongst the most well-known. Other companies, such as Lemax, have also produced similar villages, and there are numerous other brands sold. In Europe, Luville and Dickensville are established brands. 

Christmas village buildings are not usually made to consistent relative scale. A church building might well be ten times the height of an ordinary house in reality but this would make very cumbersome models and look odd within a Christmas village display. It is only necessary for the church building to be noticeably taller than the house, to give it an imposing stature.

Like many other Christmas traditions, the notion of a village to celebrate a holiday has spread to other holidays, with a few companies making Halloween and Easter villages.

<doc id="1327623" wikidata="Q11665828" url="?curid=1327623" title="Champion of the Seas">
<text>Champion of the Seas was the second largest clipper ship destined for the Liverpool, England - Melbourne, Australia passenger service. &quot;Champion&quot; was ordered by James Baines of the Black Ball Line from Donald McKay. She was launched 19 April 1854 and was abandoned 3 January 1877, off Cape Horn.

&quot;Champion of the Seas&quot; set a record for the fastest day&#x27;s run in 24 hours: noon to noon 10–11 December 1854 under the command of Captain Alexander Newlands (which translates into 19.5 knots). This record stood until August 1984, nearly 130 years.

==Construction==
&quot;Champion of the Seas&quot; was &quot;fuller aft than forward&quot;, and her strength of construction was an improvement over the &quot;Lightning&quot;, which Mackay had built the previous year. The frame was white oak, diagonally cross-braced with iron, planking and ceiling of hard pine, square fastened throughout. She had 3 decks. Her sail area and spars were roughly the same as &quot;Lightning.&quot; Her working suit of sails required 12,500 yards of cotton, 18 inches wide.

Upon completion, &quot;Champion of the Seas&quot; was towed from Boston to New York by the steam tug &quot;R.B. Forbes&quot;.

&quot;Champion of the Seas&quot;&#x27;s figurehead was the full figure of a sailor &quot;with his hat in his right hand, and left hand extended ... It was certainly a most striking figurehead, the tall square-built mariner, with dark curly hair and bronze clean-shaven face.&quot; Her semi-elliptical stern was ornamented with the coat of arms of Australia. She was painted black on the outside, white on the inside, with blue waterways: the colors of the Black Ball Line.

== History ==
James Baines ordered &quot;Champion of the Seas&quot; from Donald McKay of East Boston for the Black Ball Line of Liverpool. She was similar in appearance to McKay&#x27;s other clippers, &quot;Lightning&quot; and &quot;James Baines&quot;, but set no sails above the royals. She set the record for the longest day&#x27;s run, on 10–11 December 1854 on her maiden voyage from Liverpool to Melbourne.

From her launching to 1868, &quot;Champion&quot; served in the passenger trade. During the Indian Mutiny of 1857, the British government chartered the three Black Ball clippers to carry troops to Calcutta. Before embarking about 1,000 troops, she and &quot;James Baines&quot; were reviewed by Queen Victoria. In 1868 she entered the general shipping trade. She remained in this trade until 3 January 1877 when she was abandoned, leaking badly, with a load of guano off Cape Horn.

== In popular culture ==
Pan American World Airways (Pan Am) had a practice of naming its airliners &quot;Clippers&quot;, as an allusion to the clipper ships of earlier times. Between 1984 and 1991, a Pan Am Boeing 747-121 airliner (MSN 19641 / tail number N734PA) was named &quot;Clipper Champion of the Seas&quot; in accordance with this practice. The airliner, which had been delivered to Pan Am in 1969, had previously been named &quot;Clipper Flying Cloud&quot;.

<text>Ferentari is a neighbourhood located in the 5th Sector of Bucharest, Romania.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;Ferentari&quot; comes from the Latin word &quot;Ferentarius&quot; meaning &quot;soldier in the old pedestrian army&quot;.

==Area==

It is located in the South-South-West of Bucharest at a distance of from the city center. Connections to the city center are relatively poor, because of the limited public transport available (see below) and because of the need to cross areas subject to frequent traffic jams like Chirigiu Square.

The borough stretches along Ferentarilor Avenue (Calea Ferentarilor) and the main boundaries are: Sălaj Road (Șoseaua Sălaj) and sometimes Rahovei Avenue (Calea Rahovei) to the South West, the industrial area, the railway and partially Progresului Road (to the South-East and East), and Sălaj Road (to the West). It is bordered by the Rahova, Pieptănări, and Giurgiului boroughs. These boundaries, being totally unofficial, are subject to individual interpretation.

==History==
Ferentari was the first modern industrial area of Bucharest developed in the middle of 19th century, when new industrial plants were built in the area and especially after the first railway in Romania was built (opened in 1869 and connecting Bucharest—via Filaret station—to Giurgiu). In 1947, the Ferentari Market housing estate was built, being the most modern (and last housing project) built during the era of the Kingdom of Romania. Between 1970 and 1978 multiple apartment buildings were constructed, including the infamous Aleea Livezilor buildings.

==Population==
The population of the neighbourhood is around 90,000. It has been assigned the lowest quota on local taxes (at the beginning of Calea Ferentarilor: B zone, the middle area: C zone, the rest: D zone).

==Crime==
It has a bad reputation—as being the worst borough in Bucharest, and the base of drug dealers, prostitution, and mob operations in Bucharest. This is confirmed by the arrests of the Cămătaru mob clan, and police raids done in the Zabrăuți section of the borough after some drug-related incidents. As such, it is the center of drug dealing in Bucharest (for example, 45 dealers have been arrested in one police action) and has been the stage of a riot, a unique event in a city with very low crime rate.

However, Ferentari has a lower crime rate in terms of burglaries in relation to much of the city—possibly because of the poverty in the area. Areas such as Vadul Nou, Zăbrăuți, Prelungirea Ferentari, La Maici are notorious for squatting, and resorting to violence when they are served with eviction notices. Furthermore, when questioned about adequate responses to evictions, or to the police severing illegal connections to the mains, inhabitants of the neighbourhood consider violence as their main weapon, according to a sociological study by SNSPA.
In the said areas, the same article quotes that 84% of the inhabitants tap into the city&#x27;s electricity grid, and 64% of the inhabitants have no access to sewage, because of their status as squatters, and their inability to sign contracts with the city. As such, the areas developed informal networks stealing power, water and even cable TV signal directly from the mains. An incident linked with disconnecting illegally connected electricity users sparked the revolt of 2006.

==Transport==
The area is served by the public transport (tramway and buses). Calea Ferentarilor prolonged by Prelungirea Ferentarilor is designed to be the connection of Bucharest to the Bucharest–Giurgiu national road.

Very little public transport serves the area (five bus lines and three tram lines compared to 11 tram lines, 22 bus lines and one trolleybus line in equally sized Rahova). Only one of the bus lines in the borough connects it with the city center, namely line 117 (the official route maps are available).

The future may, however, bring a sizable development of the area, as there is a lot of spare land around (practically the entire former industrial area which is down), available at low prices, close to the city center and excellent infrastructure, although unmaintained. Contributing for this are very low prices and taxes in the area.

<doc id="1327639" wikidata="Q62776" url="?curid=1327639" title="Maragondon">
<text>Maragondon, officially the Municipality of Maragondon (), is a municipality in the province of Cavite, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 40,687 people. The town is famous for its bamboo crafts, Mounts Palay-Palay–Mataas-na-Gulod Protected Landscape which includes Mount Pico de Loro, and various ancestral houses and structures important to Philippine history and culture such as Maragondon Church and the execution site and trial house of national hero Andres Bonifacio.

Maragondon is from Imus, the provincial capital, and from Manila, the national capital.

==Etymology==
The name Maragondon is a Spanish approximation of the Tagalog word &quot;maragundong&quot; or &quot;madagundong&quot;, which means &quot;having a rumbling or thunderous sound&quot;. This refers to the noise coming from the Kay Albaran river in the village of Capantayan. This was initially the place on which the town was to be built. However, due to the floods caused by the frequent overflowing of the river, the town was later relocated to its present site.

==History==

Incidentally, Maragondon has three foundation dates, namely:
# 1611 when the Franciscan Fathers from Silang established their first &quot;visita&quot; or chapel; 
#1690, the &quot;fundacion ecclesiastica&quot; or founding of the regular parish by the Jesuits, dedicating it to Our Lady of the Assumption; 
# 1727, the &quot;fundacion civil&quot;, when the original barrio of Maragondon was separated from Silang during the administration of the Recollects and converted into an independent municipality with Gregorio Silvestre as the first &quot;gobernadorcillo&quot;. 
Maragondon belonged to the &quot;corregimiento&quot; of Mariveles (now part of Bataan) until 1754, when Spanish governor general Pedro Manuel de Arandia (1754–1759) abolished the politico-military administration and restored Maragondon to Cavite province. Alongside Silang, the town&#x27;s territory was very large during its early decades.

In the second half of the 19th century the towns of Ternate, Magallanes, Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo (formerly Bailen), Alfonso, and Naic were mere barrios of Maragondon. Ternate was the first town to attain full independence on March 31, 1857, under an agreement signed by Tomas de Leon, Felix Nigosa, Pablo de Leon, Florencio Nino Franco and Juan Ramos in behalf of the people of Ternate.

Furthermore, Bailen (now Gen. Aguinaldo) and Alfonso seceded from Maragondon in 1858. Naic then severed as a town in 1869. Magallanes was the last of the villages to attain independence, having been founded on July 15, 1879, under an agreement signed by Crisostomo Riel representing Maragondon, and by Isidro Bello and company representing Magallanes.

<text>Sterling Professor, the highest academic rank at Yale University, is awarded to a tenured faculty member considered the best in their field. It is akin to the rank of distinguished professor at other universities.

The appointment, made by the President of Yale University and confirmed by the Yale Corporation, can be granted to any Yale faculty member, and up to forty professors can hold the title at the same time. The position was established through a 1918 bequest from John William Sterling, and the first Sterling Professor was appointed in 1920.

==History==

The professorships are named for and funded by a $15-million bequest left by John W. Sterling, partner in the New York law firm Shearman &amp; Sterling and an 1864 graduate of Yale College. In addition to financing the university&#x27;s largest construction projects throughout the 1920s, including the Sterling Memorial Library and flagship facilities for many of its professional schools, Sterling stipulated the bequest would allow &quot;to some extent, the foundation of Scholarships, Fellowships or Lectureships, the endowment of new professorships and the establishment of special funds for prizes.&quot; Sterling&#x27;s trustees eventually left the university more than $5 million for this purpose—about $225,000 per chair.

The first Sterling Professor was chemist John Johnston, who was awarded the rank in 1920, and was joined later that year by school administrator Frank E. Spaulding, biochemist Lafayette Mendel, and astronomer Ernest William Brown. By the mid-1920s, the endowment allowed eighteen Sterling Professors to be appointed. In 1958, the Yale Corporation capped the number of simultaneous appointments at 27, but further endowment growth allowed this number to expand to 40 by 2011. In addition to currently appointed faculty, a number of former Sterling Professors retain emeritus appointments at the university and continue to teach.

The first woman to be named Sterling Professor was cell biologist Marilyn Farquhar, in 1987. After Farquhar left Yale in 1989, Middle English scholar Marie Borroff and geneticist Carolyn Slayman were the next women appointed, in 1991. Among the youngest appointees were John Farquhar Fulton, made Sterling Professor of Physiology in 1929 at age 30, and later-U.S Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas, appointed in 1932 at the age of 33. Joan Steitz and Thomas Steitz, biochemists appointed in 1999 and 2001 respectively, were the first married couple to have both held the appointment. In 2021, Michael Della Rocca and Christine Hayes, professors of philosophy and religious studies, respectively, became the second married couple to be named Sterling Professors.

Although this program was broadcast from the convention of 1981 of start time when the game of the day was called off because of serious calamities, such as heavy rain or a typhoon, and an earthquake, if applied by the convention of 1988 When the game of the day was called off because of the relation of the above natural situations, broadcast of a program also changed from the convention of 1989 to the example considered as a pause on that day.

The broadcast on 2004 August 18 was for 30 minutes starting at 5:05 AM because due to the Athens Olympic Games relay broadcast. (In the beginning, it was scheduled for 4:30 AM, as a measure by relay deployment, it wound beforehand for certain 35 minutes, and has fallen, and a part of program which was due to be broadcast to the next of this program was broadcast later.)

<text>The Robert E. Lee Memorial Bridge in Richmond, Virginia carries U.S. Route 1 and U.S. Route 301 across the James River at the Fall Line.

The city acquired the original bridge from Richmond Bridge Corp in 1933, and it was named the James River Bridge but was later renamed for the Confederate general. However, in light of the George Floyd protests in 2020, the Richmond City Council began the process of reverting its name to the James River Bridge. It was originally constructed as a four lane toll facility and opened in 1934. In the 1980s, a replacement structure was built including a substantial realignment of the approach roadways at the south end. Work was completed in 1989. It is toll-free and includes 3 lanes in either direction. An on-ramp and an off-ramp for South 2nd Street connects to the bridge over the north shore of the James River. The Virginia War Memorial is located adjacent to its northern end.

A notable feature is a pedestrian footbridge which hangs below the road deck from Tredegar Street near the site of the Tredegar Iron Works on the north shore over to Belle Isle in the middle of the river.

<doc id="1327679" wikidata="Q509392" url="?curid=1327679" title="Victual Brothers">
<text>The Victual Brothers () were a loosely organized guild of privateers who later turned to piracy. They affected maritime trade during the 14th century in both the North and Baltic Seas.

They were initially hired in 1392 by the Dukes of Mecklenburg to support their fight against Queen Margaret I of Denmark, who was besieging Stockholm. Named after the Latin word (&#x27;provisions&#x27;), their mission was to supply the city with goods. They initially had the support of most of the Hanseatic league apart from Lübeck. Over time, they became notorious pirates, attacking coastal towns around the Baltic region, so that the maritime trade in the Baltic Sea virtually collapsed. At the peak of their power in 1394, they took over the island of Gotland. Their influence in the Baltic region declined after the Teutonic Order drove them out of Gotland in 1398.

After being expelled, the remaining Victual Brothers, now calling themselves the &quot;Likedeelers&quot; (&#x27;equal sharers&#x27;), continued their piracy and expanded their activities into the North Sea and along the Atlantic coast, raiding as far as France and Spain. Their most famous leader was Klaus Störtebeker. The Likedeelers kept up their attacks into the early 15th century, including a major raid on Bergen in 1429.

== Guild of the Victual Brothers ==
During the 14th century, Queen Margaret I of Denmark was battling Albert of Mecklenburg for Scandinavian supremacy. Albert had been King of Sweden since 1364 and Duke of Mecklenburg since 1383. The Vitalian Brotherhood were hired in 1392 by the Dukes of Mecklenburg to fight against Denmark, after Queen Margaret had imprisoned Albert and his son Eric of Mecklenburg in order to subdue the Kingdom of Sweden. While Queen Margaret&#x27;s forces were besieging Stockholm, the blockade runners who came to be known as the Victual Brotherhood engaged in war at sea and shipped provisions to keep the city supplied. The name Victual Brothers is derived from the Latin word &quot;victualia&quot;—meaning provisions—and refers to their first mission, which was to supply the besieged city.
The Victual Brothers were organised as a brotherhood or guild. Their main naval enemy in 1392 was the powerful Hanseatic town of Lübeck, which supported Denmark in the war. Apart from Lübeck, the Hanseatic League initially supported the Victual Brothers. Most of the Hanseatic towns had no desire for a victory for Denmark, with its strategic location for control of the seaways. For several years from 1392, the Victual Brothers were a strong power in the Baltic Sea. They had safe harbours in the cities of Rostock, Ribnitz, Wismar and Stralsund. They soon turned to open piracy and coastal plunder. In 1393 they sacked the town of Bergen for the first time and in 1394 they conquered Malmö. They occupied parts of Frisia and Schleswig. They also plundered Turku, Vyborg, Styresholm, Korsholm and Faxeholm castle at Söderhamn in Hälsingland.

At the climax of their power, the Victual Brothers occupied the island of Gotland, Sweden, in 1394 and set up their headquarters in Visby. They also operated from the Turku archipelago; Knut Bosson, who was the chief of Turku Castle from 1395 to 1398, had allied himself with the people of Mecklenburg, which is why he supported the hijacking activities of the Victual Brothers and allowed them to operate in the area. Maritime trade in the Baltic Sea virtually collapsed, and the herring industry suffered from their depredations. Queen Margaret even turned to King Richard II of England and sought to charter English ships to combat the pirates. From 1395 onwards, Queen Margaret gained the upper hand politically. She united Denmark, Sweden and Norway and formed the Kalmar Union. The Hanseatic League was forced to cooperate with her, foreshadowing its eventual decline. King Albert of Sweden conceded Gotland to the allied Teutonic Order as a pledge (similar to a fiefdom). An invasion army under Konrad von Jungingen (1355–1407), the Grand Master of the Order, conquered the island in 1398, destroying Visby and driving the Victual Brothers out of Gotland.

== Likedeelers, successors of Victual Brothers ==

After the Victual Brothers&#x27; defeat and expulsion from Gotland in 1398, the Hanseatic League tried repeatedly but unsuccessfully to completely control the Baltic Sea. Many Victual Brothers still remained at sea. When they lost their influence in the Gulf of Bothnia, the Gulf of Finland and Gotland, they operated from the Schlei, the mouth of the river Ems and other locations in Friesland. The successors to the Victual Brothers gave themselves the name &quot;Likedeelers&quot; (&quot;equal sharers&quot;): they shared with the poor coastal population. They expanded their activities into the North Sea and along the Atlantic coastline, raiding Brabant and France and striking as far south as Spain.

Their most famous leader was Captain Klaus Störtebeker, who first appears in the record as a Victual Brother around 1394. The Low German word &quot;Störtebeker&quot; means &quot;Down the beakerful&quot;. He allegedly got his name because he could swallow four litres of beer without taking the beaker from his mouth. However, it might simply be a family name from Wismar. In 1401 the Hamburg warship &quot;Die Bunte Kuh&quot;, leading a small fleet under Commander Simon of Utrecht, caught up with Störtebeker&#x27;s forces near Heligoland. After three days&#x27; running battle, Störtebeker and his crew were finally overpowered, trapped and executed.

This was not the end of piracy and coastal raiding by the Likedeelers. In 1429, some 28 years after the execution of Störtebeker, members of the Victual Brothers attacked and plundered the important trading town of Bergen, eventually burning it to the ground. Until about 1440, maritime trade in both the North and Baltic Seas was seriously in danger of attack by the Likedeelers.

<text>Avella is a census-designated place in Independence Township, Washington County, Pennsylvania, United States. As of the 2010 census the population was 804 residents. It is located at 40.27° north &amp; 80.45° west.

==Demographics==
== History ==
The ancient history of the area includes some of North America&#x27;s earliest inhabitants. The Meadowcroft Rockshelter is a prehistoric shelter found below a rock outcropping that is believed to have provided shelter for a succession of early foragers as far back as 16,000 years and possibly as far back as 19,000 years ago, although the dates are controversial. The area also was the site of Eastern Woodland Indians communities some 400 years ago. Today a National Historic Landmark includes a historic interactive display that provides a view of life for early Woodland Indians, as well as 19th Century rural American life.

Avella&#x27;s early history included American frontiersmen, grist mills and refuge forts during the 18th century, when the area was part of the western frontier. It remains the site of a significant farming community. However, it began to grow after the arrival of the railroad in the early 20th century (the last railroad tunnel was completed in 1903 and served the Wabash Railroad). Completion of the railroad enabled coal mining companies to open numerous mines, making the Avella/Burgettstown area one of the world&#x27;s most important bituminous coal mining regions.

The mining and railroad opportunities attracted many immigrants in the early 20th century, principally southern and eastern Europeans, and the area grew greatly in size and importance in the first third of the 20th century.

Avella, and the former nearby town of Cliftonville, were the site of labor strife in the coal mining industry. In the midst of a strike, the mine owners began firing union mine works and replacing them with non-union workers. In the Cliftonville Riot, 500 union mine workers marched on the mine in an attempt to shut down the non-union labor. This led to gunfire between the union mineworkers, non-union workers, owners, and the local police department. Between 4 and 13 people died in the riot, including Brooke County Sheriff H.H. Duval. No one involved was ever convicted in crimes relating to the riot and the sheriff&#x27;s killer was never identified.

The town began a gradual decline as the local coal seams began to give out and the demand for and price of coal dropped. The population declined as the coal mines closed and families moved away looking for other employment opportunities.

<text>Joseph Reed (1823 – 29 April 1890) was an English-born architect in Melbourne, Australia in the Victorian era. Considered the city&#x27;s greatest, his prolific works include many of the city&#x27;s most loved buildings and significant heritage listings. Among his most famous designs is the World Heritage-listed Royal Exhibition Building, completed for the 1880 International Exposition.

He established his practice in 1853, which through various partnerships and name changes, continues today as Bates Smart, one of the oldest firms continually operating in Australia.
==Biography==
Born in 1823 in Cornwall, England, Joseph Reed&#x27;s early career may have included some local training, and he is known to have worked in the offices of some noted architects in London. He decided to start a new career at the age of 30 in Australia, arriving in Melbourne in 1853, and very soon made a name for himself. The next year he won the design competition for the State Library of Victoria, the Geelong City Hall in 1855, and designed the Bank of New South Wales in Collins Street in 1856.
In 1859, botanist Ferdinand von Mueller described &quot;Reedia&quot;, a genus of flowering plants from south-western Australia, belonging to the family Cyperaceae, naming it in Reed&#x27;s honour.

In 1862 he partnered with Frederick Barnes (1824–1884).

In 1883 Barnes retired from the partnership and Reed was joined by A. M. Henderson and F. J. Smart. In 1890 Henderson withdrew while N. B. Tappin joined the firm, and Reed himself died. The office later became Bates, Peebles &amp; Smart.

Later in life, Reed met and married Hannah Elliot Lane on the 26 March 1885. They had no children.

In the late 1880s Reed suffered financial difficulties through land speculation, which is said to have affected his health such that he died of &#x27;inanition and exhaustion&#x27; on 29 April 1890.

==Architectural expression==
Reed&#x27;s buildings represent an impressive body of work, in a range of then popular styles, each one a fine essay in the chosen idiom. He could design in Neoclassical, Renaissance Revival, Gothic Revival, Italianate, Baroque, French Second Empire, Romanesque and Queen Anne, and of course as typical for 19th century architects, designs that blended more than one historical style.

Following a visit to Europe in 1863 he experienced first hand the late medieval brick architecture of Lombardy, the source for the bold polychrome brick Gothic Revival already popular in England, which he soon expressed in his designs for the Independent Church on Collins Street, St Jude&#x27;s in Carlton, and Frederick T. Sargood&#x27;s Rippon Lea Estate at Elsternwick. These works were the first expression of polychrome brick medieval Italian in Victoria, which by the 1880s had gained enormous popularity.
Major works include the classical State Library of Victoria (1856), Collins Street Independent Church (1867), Frederick Sargood&#x27;s Rippon Lea Estate (1868) and Melbourne Trades Hall (1873). In contrast to the polychrome Romanesque of Rippon Lea and the Independent Church is the stern Gothic manner of Scots&#x27; Church (1871–4) across the road; the energetic spire was for the last decades of the nineteenth century Melbourne&#x27;s tallest structure. The Trades Hall is grandly palatial, the world&#x27;s oldest and probably most splendid trades hall. In the fashionable Second Empire style Reed also designed Melbourne Town Hall (1870) while the World Heritage-listed Royal Exhibition Building, completed for the 1880 International Exposition in Melbourne is Italianate with a Florentine dome. Reed completed the building of St Paul&#x27;s Anglican Cathedral to the designs of William Butterfield after that architect resigned the project in 1884. Reed was faithful to the original design, but provided most of the furnishings, including the elaborate pulpit, and the attached Chapter House in matching style.

==Recognition==
The Victorian Chapter of the Australian Institute of Architects recognises Reed&#x27;s contribution to Melbourne and the architecture profession with the annually awarded Joseph Reed Urban Design Award.

<doc id="1327697" wikidata="Q7963832" url="?curid=1327697" title="Walsh Jesuit High School">
<text>Walsh Jesuit High School is a private, Catholic, co-educational college preparatory high school in the Jesuit tradition, located in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, approximately south of Cleveland.

Walsh&#x27;s campus covers and is situated near the Cuyahoga Valley National Park. The campus features five outdoor athletic fields, a 5,000 meter cross country track, a 1,600 seat gymnasium, a field house, wrestling room, an all-sports complex (formerly known as Conway Memorial Stadium), and a residence for the Jesuit priests that staff the school.
The school&#x27;s chapel, named in honor of its patron saints, the North American Jesuit Martyrs, is topped with the distinctive metallic cross which has become the school&#x27;s most prominent symbol and landmark.

==History==

Walsh Jesuit High School was funded by a generous gift from Cornelius Walsh (b. 1864), a prominent industrialist and Catholic layman who had lived his entire life in Cuyahoga Falls. Upon his death in 1932, Cornelius bequeathed his entire fortune to his wife, Jane, who continued to donate generously to Catholic institutions and, with the assistance of her nephew, William A. Walsh, designed her will to include a large gift for the foundation of a Catholic high school. William, partial to the Jesuits, convinced his aunt to bequeath to the Society of Jesus her property and $100,000 for the building of an all-boys school that would be a memorial to her husband. William approached the Chicago Province of the Jesuits with the proposal, but the gift lay dormant for years until found during a transfer of files from the Chicago Province to the Detroit Province in 1959. William urged Fr. John McGrail, S.J., the head of the Jesuits&#x27; Detroit Province, to reconsider the proposal made in Jane&#x27;s will. The school&#x27;s campus was originally planned to be built in downtown Cuyahoga Falls near St. Joseph Parish School, but using the gift from Jane (which had grown to $2 million under William&#x27;s stewardship, and to which the Cleveland Catholic Diocese added $1 million), 50 acres were purchased from the Conway family farm north of downtown, with an additional 50 acres purchased later.

Groundbreaking ceremonies for Walsh Jesuit took place in 1964, and the school opened its doors to 153 freshmen on September 7, 1965. The school was dedicated in May 1966, and the first class graduated in 1969. All students were required to wear neckties, a shirt with a collar, and hair not falling over the ears. A &quot;tie strike&quot; was organized in 1969, which was easily quashed.

Initially founded as an all-boys institution similar to other prominent Northeast Ohio Catholic high schools, Walsh Jesuit&#x27;s leadership decided to go co-ed in 1991 amid excess capacity and financial challenges to the school&#x27;s continued existence. The decision was initially met with resistance by many Walsh Jesuit alumni and students, culminating in a student walkout, which received extensive local media coverage, when the news of the decision was made public. Despite the protests, the first girls entered the school at the beginning of the 1993-1994 academic year, and currently constitute approximately half of the overall student population.

Walsh&#x27;s mascot is the &quot;Warriors,&quot; originally conceived as a reference to the Seneca Indians that had historically inhabited the school&#x27;s campus locality. However, in 2021, as a response to the Native American mascot controversy, the school formally disassociated the name &quot;Warriors&quot; from any reference to Native American culture, removed Native American iconography from its sports uniforms and facilities, and changed the name of its annual fundraising gala.

==Athletics==

<doc id="1327699" wikidata="Q277215" url="?curid=1327699" title="A Very Special Christmas">
<text>A Very Special Christmas is the title of a series of Christmas music compilation albums that benefit the Special Olympics. It features songs performed by artists from a variety of genres, such as Dave Matthews, U2, Stevie Nicks, Bon Jovi, Madonna, The Smashing Pumpkins, No Doubt, Whitney Houston, Run–D.M.C., Jason Mraz, Willie Nelson, Bruce Springsteen and Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.

&quot;A Very Special Christmas&quot; was the idea of music producer Jimmy Iovine, who wanted to produce a Christmas album as a memorial to his father. The idea of the record benefiting the Special Olympics was suggested by Iovine&#x27;s wife Vicki, as she was a volunteer for the organization. Herb Alpert and Jerry Moss, the founders of A&amp;M Records, along with Bobby Shriver, helped the Iovines realize the project. Since the release of the first album in 1987, the series has raised over $100 million for the Special Olympics, more than any other benefit series.

All of the albums use the same cover art: a simplistic line drawing of a person holding a baby (an abstract representation of Mary holding baby Jesus) by Keith Haring in his usual style. Each album uses the artwork with a different color scheme.

In 1995, the jazz-oriented &quot;Jazz to the World&quot; was released by Blue Note Records. In 1996, &quot;World Christmas&quot;, which focused on diverse artists from around the globe, was released by Blue Note subsidiary Metro Blue Records.

<text>Rindler coordinates are a coordinate system used in the context of special relativity to describe the hyperbolic acceleration of a uniformly accelerating reference frame in flat spacetime. In relativistic physics the coordinates of a &quot;hyperbolically accelerated reference frame&quot; constitute an important and useful coordinate chart representing part of flat Minkowski spacetime. In special relativity, a uniformly accelerating particle undergoes hyperbolic motion, for which a uniformly accelerating frame of reference in which it is at rest can be chosen as its proper reference frame. The phenomena in this hyperbolically accelerated frame can be compared to effects arising in a homogeneous gravitational field. For general overview of accelerations in flat spacetime, see Acceleration (special relativity) and Proper reference frame (flat spacetime).

In this article, the speed of light is defined by , the inertial coordinates are , and the hyperbolic coordinates are . These hyperbolic coordinates can be separated into two main variants depending on the accelerated observer&#x27;s position: If the observer is located at time at position (with as the constant proper acceleration measured by a comoving accelerometer), then the hyperbolic coordinates are often called Rindler coordinates with the corresponding &quot;Rindler metric&quot;. If the observer is located at time at position , then the hyperbolic coordinates are sometimes called &quot;Møller coordinates&quot; or &quot;Kottler–Møller coordinates&quot; with the corresponding &quot;Kottler–Møller metric&quot;. An alternative chart often related to observers in hyperbolic motion is obtained using Radar coordinates which are sometimes called &quot;Lass coordinates&quot;. Both the Kottler–Møller coordinates as well as Lass coordinates are denoted as Rindler coordinates as well.

Regarding the history, such coordinates were introduced soon after the advent of special relativity, when they were studied (fully or partially) alongside the concept of hyperbolic motion: In relation to flat Minkowski spacetime by Albert Einstein (1907, 1912), Max Born (1909), Arnold Sommerfeld (1910), Max von Laue (1911), Hendrik Lorentz (1913), Friedrich Kottler (1914), Wolfgang Pauli (1921), Karl Bollert (1922), Stjepan Mohorovičić (1922), Georges Lemaître (1924), Einstein &amp; Nathan Rosen (1935), Christian Møller (1943, 1952), Fritz Rohrlich (1963), Harry Lass (1963), and in relation to both flat and curved spacetime of general relativity by Wolfgang Rindler (1960, 1966). For details and sources, see &quot;&quot;.

==Characteristics of the Rindler frame==
The worldline of a body in hyperbolic motion having constant proper acceleration formula_1 in the formula_2-direction as a function of proper time formula_3 and rapidity formula_4 can be given by
:formula_5
where formula_6 is constant and formula_4 is variable, with the worldline resembling the hyperbola formula_8. Sommerfeld showed that the equations can be reinterpreted by defining formula_9 as variable and formula_4 as constant, so that it represents the simultaneous &quot;rest shape&quot; of a body in hyperbolic motion measured by a comoving observer. By using the proper time of the observer as the time of the entire hyperbolically accelerated frame by setting formula_11, the transformation formulas between the inertial coordinates and the hyperbolic coordinates are consequently:

with the inverse

:formula_12

Differentiated and inserted into the Minkowski metric 
:formula_13
the metric in the hyperbolically accelerated frame follows as

These transformations define the &quot;Rindler observer&quot; as an observer that is &quot;at rest&quot; in Rindler coordinates, i.e., maintaining constant &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot;, and only varying &quot;t&quot; as time passes. The coordinates are valid in the region formula_14, which is often called the &quot;Rindler wedge&quot;, if formula_1 represents the proper acceleration (along the hyperbola formula_16) of the Rindler observer whose proper time is defined to be equal to Rindler coordinate time. To maintain this world line, the observer must accelerate with a constant proper acceleration, with Rindler observers closer to formula_17 (the Rindler horizon) having greater proper acceleration. All the Rindler observers are instantaneously at rest at time formula_18 in the inertial frame, and at this time a Rindler observer with proper acceleration formula_19 will be at position formula_20 (really formula_21, but we assume units where formula_22), which is also that observer&#x27;s constant distance from the Rindler horizon in Rindler coordinates. If all Rindler observers set their clocks to zero at formula_18, then when defining a Rindler coordinate system we have a choice of which Rindler observer&#x27;s proper time will be equal to the coordinate time formula_24 in Rindler coordinates, and this observer&#x27;s proper acceleration defines the value of formula_1 above (for other Rindler observers at different distances from the Rindler horizon, the coordinate time will equal some constant multiple of their own proper time). It is a common convention to define the Rindler coordinate system so that the Rindler observer whose proper time matches coordinate time is the one who has proper acceleration formula_26, so that formula_1 can be eliminated from the equations.

The above equation has been simplified for formula_22. The unsimplified equation is more convenient for finding the Rindler Horizon distance, given an acceleration formula_1.

:formula_30

The remainder of the article will follow the convention of setting both formula_26 and formula_22, so units for formula_2 and formula_9 will be 1 unit formula_35. Be mindful that setting formula_26 light-second/second2 is very different from setting formula_26 light-year/year2. Even if we pick units where formula_22, the magnitude of the proper acceleration formula_1 will depend on our choice of units: for example, if we use units of light-years for distance, (formula_2 or formula_9) and years for time, (formula_42 or formula_24), this would mean formula_26 light year/year2, equal to about 9.5 meters/second2, while if we use units of light-seconds for distance, (formula_2 or formula_9), and seconds for time, (formula_42 or formula_24), this would mean formula_26 light-second/second2, or 299 792 458 meters/second2).

==Variants of transformation formulas==

A more general derivation of the transformation formulas is given, when the corresponding Fermi–Walker tetrad is formulated from which the Fermi coordinates or Proper coordinates can be derived. Depending on the choice of origin of these coordinates, one can derive the metric, the time dilation between the time at the origin formula_50 and formula_51 at point formula_9, and the coordinate light speed formula_53 (this variable speed of light does not contradict special relativity, because it is only an artifact of the accelerated coordinates employed, while in inertial coordinates it remains constant). Instead of Fermi coordinates, also Radar coordinates can be used, which are obtained by determining the distance using light signals (see section Notions of distance), by which metric, time dilation and speed of light do not depend on the coordinates anymore – in particular, the coordinate speed of light remains identical with the speed of light formula_54 in inertial frames:

==The Rindler observers==

In the new chart () with formula_22 and formula_26, it is natural to take the coframe field
:formula_59

which has the dual frame field
:formula_60

This defines a &quot;local Lorentz frame&quot; in the tangent space at each event (in the region covered by our Rindler chart, namely the Rindler wedge). The integral curves of the timelike unit vector field formula_61 give a timelike congruence, consisting of the world lines of a family of observers called the &quot;Rindler observers&quot;. In the Rindler chart, these world lines appear as the vertical coordinate lines formula_62. Using the coordinate transformation above, we find that these correspond to hyperbolic arcs in the original Cartesian chart.
As with any timelike congruence in any Lorentzian manifold, this congruence has a &quot;kinematic decomposition&quot; (see Raychaudhuri equation). In this case, the &quot;expansion&quot; and &quot;vorticity&quot; of the congruence of Rindler observers &quot;vanish&quot;. The vanishing of the expansion tensor implies that &quot;each of our observers maintains constant distance to his neighbors&quot;. The vanishing of the vorticity tensor implies that the world lines of our observers are not twisting about each other; this is a kind of local absence of &quot;swirling&quot;.

The acceleration vector of each observer is given by the covariant derivative
:formula_63

That is, each Rindler observer is accelerating in the formula_64 direction. Individually speaking, each observer is in fact accelerating with &quot;constant magnitude&quot; in this direction, so their world lines are the Lorentzian analogs of circles, which are the curves of constant path curvature in the Euclidean geometry.

Because the Rindler observers are &quot;vorticity-free&quot;, they are also &quot;hypersurface orthogonal&quot;. The orthogonal spatial hyperslices are formula_65; these appear as horizontal half-planes in the Rindler chart and as half-planes through formula_66 in the Cartesian chart (see the figure above). Setting formula_67 in the line element, we see that these have the ordinary Euclidean geometry, formula_68. Thus, the spatial coordinates in the Rindler chart have a very simple interpretation consistent with the claim that the Rindler observers are mutually stationary. We will return to this rigidity property of the Rindler observers a bit later in this article.

==A &quot;paradoxical&quot; property==
Note that Rindler observers with smaller constant x coordinate are accelerating &quot;harder&quot; to keep up. This may seem surprising because in Newtonian physics, observers who maintain constant relative distance must share the &quot;same&quot; acceleration. But in relativistic physics, we see that the trailing endpoint of a rod which is accelerated by some external force (parallel to its symmetry axis) must accelerate a bit harder than the leading endpoint, or else it must ultimately break. This is a manifestation of Lorentz contraction. As the rod accelerates, its velocity increases and its length decreases. Since it is getting shorter, the back end must accelerate harder than the front. Another way to look at it is: the back end must achieve the same change in velocity in a shorter period of time. This leads to a differential equation showing that, at some distance, the acceleration of the trailing end diverges, resulting in the Rindler horizon.

This phenomenon is the basis of a well known &quot;paradox&quot;, Bell&#x27;s spaceship paradox. However, it is a simple consequence of relativistic kinematics. One way to see this is to observe that the magnitude of the acceleration vector is just the path curvature of the corresponding world line. But &quot;the world lines of our Rindler observers are the analogs of a family of concentric circles&quot; in the Euclidean plane, so we are simply dealing with the Lorentzian analog of a fact familiar to speed skaters: in a family of concentric circles, &quot;inner circles must bend faster (per unit arc length) than the outer ones&quot;.

==Minkowski observers==
It is worthwhile to also introduce an alternative frame, given in the Minkowski chart by the natural choice
:formula_69

Transforming these vector fields using the coordinate transformation given above, we find that in the Rindler chart (in the Rindler wedge) this frame becomes
:formula_70

Computing the kinematic decomposition of the timelike congruence defined by the timelike unit vector field formula_71, we find that the expansion and vorticity again vanishes, and in addition the acceleration vector vanishes, formula_72. In other words, this is a &quot;geodesic congruence&quot;; the corresponding observers are in a state of &quot;inertial motion&quot;. In the original Cartesian chart, these observers, whom we will call &quot;Minkowski observers&quot;, are at rest.

In the Rindler chart, the world lines of the Minkowski observers appear as hyperbolic secant curves asymptotic to the coordinate plane formula_73. Specifically, in Rindler coordinates, the world line of the Minkowski observer passing through the event formula_74 is 
:formula_75

where formula_76 is the proper time of this Minkowski observer. Note that only a small portion of his history is covered by the Rindler chart. This shows explicitly why the Rindler chart is &quot;not&quot; geodesically complete; timelike geodesics run outside the region covered by the chart in finite proper time. Of course, we already knew that the Rindler chart cannot be geodesically complete, because it covers only a portion of the original Cartesian chart, which &quot;is&quot; a geodesically complete chart.

In the case depicted in the figure, formula_77 and we have drawn (correctly scaled and boosted) the light cones at formula_78.

==The Rindler horizon==

The Rindler coordinate chart has a &quot;coordinate singularity&quot; at &quot;x&quot; = 0, where the metric tensor (expressed in the Rindler coordinates) has vanishing determinant. This happens because as &quot;x&quot; → 0 the acceleration of the Rindler observers diverges. As we can see from the figure illustrating the Rindler wedge, the locus &quot;x&quot; = 0 in the Rindler chart corresponds to the locus &quot;T&quot;2 = &quot;X&quot;2, &quot;X&quot; &gt; 0 in the Cartesian chart, which consists of two null half-planes, each ruled by a null geodesic congruence.

For the moment, we simply consider the Rindler horizon as the boundary of the Rindler coordinates. If we consider the set of accelerating observers who have a constant position in Rindler coordinates, none of them can ever receive light signals from events with &quot;T&quot; ≥ &quot;X&quot; (on the diagram, these would be events on or to the left of the line &quot;T&quot; = &quot;X&quot; which the upper red horizon lies along; these observers could however receive signals from events with &quot;T&quot; ≥ &quot;X&quot; if they stopped their acceleration and crossed this line themselves) nor could they have ever sent signals to events with &quot;T&quot; ≤ −&quot;X&quot; (events on or to the left of the line &quot;T&quot; = −&quot;X&quot; which the lower red horizon lies along; those events lie outside all future light cones of their past world line). Also, if we consider members of this set of accelerating observers closer and closer to the horizon, in the limit as the distance to the horizon approaches zero, the constant proper acceleration experienced by an observer at this distance (which would also be the G-force experienced by such an observer) would approach infinity. Both of these facts would also be true if we were considering a set of observers hovering outside the event horizon of a black hole, each observer hovering at a constant radius in Schwarzschild coordinates. In fact, in the close neighborhood of a black hole, the geometry close to the event horizon can be described in Rindler coordinates. Hawking radiation in the case of an accelerating frame is referred to as Unruh radiation. The connection is the equivalence of acceleration with gravitation.

==Geodesics==

The geodesic equations in the Rindler chart are easily obtained from the geodesic Lagrangian; they are

:formula_79

Of course, in the original Cartesian chart, the geodesics appear as straight lines, so we could easily obtain them in the Rindler chart using our coordinate transformation. However, it is instructive to obtain and study them independently of the original chart, and we shall do so in this section.
From the first, third, and fourth we immediately obtain the &quot;first integrals&quot;

:formula_80

But from the line element we have formula_81 where formula_82 for timelike, null, and spacelike geodesics, respectively. This gives the fourth first integral, namely
:formula_83.

This suffices to give the complete solution of the geodesic equations.

In the case of null geodesics, from formula_84 with nonzero formula_85, we see that the x coordinate ranges over the interval

:formula_86.

The complete seven parameter family giving any null geodesic through any event in the Rindler wedge, is

:formula_87

Plotting the &quot;tracks&quot; of some representative null geodesics through a given event (that is, projecting to the hyperslice formula_88), we obtain a picture which looks suspiciously like the family of all semicircles through a point and orthogonal to the Rindler horizon (See the figure).

== The Fermat metric ==

The fact that in the Rindler chart, the projections of null geodesics into any spatial hyperslice for the Rindler observers are simply semicircular arcs can be verified directly from the general solution just given, but there is a very simple way to see this. A static spacetime is one in which a vorticity-free timelike Killing vector field can be found. In this case, we have a uniquely defined family of (identical) spatial hyperslices orthogonal to the corresponding static observers (who need not be inertial observers). This allows us to define a new metric on any of these hyperslices which is conformally related to the original metric inherited from the spacetime, but with the property that geodesics in the new metric (note this is a Riemannian metric on a Riemannian three-manifold) are precisely the projections of the null geodesics of spacetime. This new metric is called the &quot;Fermat metric&quot;, and in a static spacetime endowed with a coordinate chart in which the line element has the form
:formula_89

the Fermat metric on formula_90 is simply
:formula_91

(where the metric coeffients are understood to be evaluated at formula_90).

In the Rindler chart, the timelike translation formula_93 is such a Killing vector field, so this is a static spacetime (not surprisingly, since Minkowski spacetime is of course trivially a static vacuum solution of the Einstein field equation). Therefore, we may immediately write down the Fermat metric for the Rindler observers:
:formula_94

But this is the well-known line element of &quot;hyperbolic three-space&quot; H3 in the &quot;upper half space chart&quot;. This is closely analogous to the well known &quot;upper half plane chart&quot; for the hyperbolic plane H2, which is familiar to generations of complex analysis students in connection with &quot;conformal mapping problems&quot; (and much more), and many mathematically minded readers already know that the geodesics of H2 in the upper half plane model are simply semicircles (orthogonal to the circle at infinity represented by the real axis).

== Symmetries ==

Since the Rindler chart is a coordinate chart for Minkowski spacetime, we expect to find ten linearly independent Killing vector fields. Indeed, in the Cartesian chart we can readily find ten linearly independent Killing vector fields, generating respectively one parameter subgroups of time translation, three spatials, three rotations and three boosts. Together these generate the (proper isochronous) Poincaré group, the symmetry group of Minkowski spacetime.

However, it is instructive to write down and solve the Killing vector equations directly. We obtain four familiar looking Killing vector fields
:formula_95

(time translation, spatial translations orthogonal to the direction of acceleration, and spatial rotation orthogonal to the direction of acceleration) plus six more:
:formula_96

(where the signs are chosen consistently + or −). We leave it as an exercise to figure out how these are related to the standard generators; here we wish to point out that we must be able to obtain generators equivalent to formula_97 in the Cartesian chart, yet the Rindler wedge is obviously not invariant under this translation. How can this be? The answer is that like anything defined by a system of partial differential equations on a smooth manifold, the Killing equation will in general have locally defined solutions, but these might not exist globally. That is, with suitable restrictions on the group parameter, a Killing flow can always be defined in a suitable &quot;local neighborhood&quot;, but the flow might not be well-defined globally. This has nothing to do with Lorentzian manifolds per se, since the same issue arises in the study of general smooth manifolds.

== Notions of distance ==

One of the many valuable lessons to be learned from a study of the Rindler chart is that there are in fact several &quot;distinct&quot; (but reasonable) notions of distance which can be used by the Rindler observers.
The first is the one we have tacitly employed above: the induced Riemannian metric on the spatial hyperslices formula_65. We will call this the &quot;ruler distance&quot; since it corresponds to this induced Riemannian metric, but its operational meaning might not be immediately apparent.

From the standpoint of physical measurement, a more natural notion of distance between two world lines is the &quot;radar distance&quot;. This is computed by sending a null geodesic from the world line of our observer (event A) to the world line of some small object, whereupon it is reflected (event B) and returns to the observer (event C). The radar distance is then obtained by dividing the round trip travel time, as measured by an ideal clock carried by our observer.

(In Minkowski spacetime, fortunately, we can ignore the possibility of multiple null geodesic paths between two world lines, but in cosmological models and other applications things are not so simple. We should also caution against assuming that this notion of distance between two observers gives a notion which is symmetric under interchanging the observers.)

In particular, consider a pair of Rindler observers with coordinates formula_99 and formula_100 respectively. (Note that the first of these, the trailing observer, is accelerating a bit harder, in order to keep up with the leading observer). Setting formula_101 in the Rindler line element, we readily obtain the equation of null geodesics moving in the direction of acceleration:
:formula_102

Therefore, the radar distance between these two observers is given by
:formula_103

This is a bit smaller than the ruler distance, but for nearby observers the discrepancy is negligible.

A third possible notion of distance is this: our observer measures the &quot;angle&quot; subtended by a unit disk placed on some object (not a point object), as it appears from his location. We call this the &quot;optical diameter distance&quot;. Because of the simple character of null geodesics in Minkowski spacetime, we can readily determine the optical distance between our pair of Rindler observers (aligned with the direction of acceleration). From a sketch it should be plausible that the optical diameter distance scales like formula_104. Therefore, in the case of a trailing observer estimating distance to a leading observer (the case formula_105), the optical distance is a bit larger than the ruler distance, which is a bit larger than the radar distance. The reader should now take a moment to consider the case of a leading observer estimating distance to a trailing observer.

There are other notions of distance, but the main point is clear: while the values of these various notions will in general disagree for a given pair of Rindler observers, they all agree that &quot;every pair of Rindler observers maintains constant distance&quot;. The fact that &quot;very nearby&quot; Rindler observers are mutually stationary follows from the fact, noted above, that the expansion tensor of the Rindler congruence vanishes identically. However, we have shown here that in various senses, this rigidity property holds at larger scales. This is truly a remarkable rigidity property, given the well-known fact that in relativistic physics, &quot;no rod can be accelerated rigidly&quot; (and &quot;no disk can be spun up rigidly&quot;) — at least, not without sustaining inhomogeneous stresses. The easiest way to see this is to observe that in Newtonian physics, if we &quot;kick&quot; a rigid body, all elements of matter in the body will immediately change their state of motion. This is of course incompatible with the relativistic principle that no information having any physical effect can be transmitted faster than the speed of light.

It follows that if a rod is accelerated by some external force applied anywhere along its length, the elements of matter in various different places in the rod cannot all feel the same magnitude of acceleration if the rod is not to extend without bound and ultimately break. In other words, an accelerated rod which does not break must sustain stresses which vary along its length. Furthermore, in any thought experiment with time varying forces, whether we &quot;kick&quot; an object or try to accelerate it gradually, we cannot avoid the problem of avoiding mechanical models which are inconsistent with relativistic kinematics (because distant parts of the body respond too quickly to an applied force).

Returning to the question of the operational significance of the ruler distance, we see that this should be the distance which our observers will obtain should they very slowly pass from hand to hand a small ruler which is repeatedly set end to end. But justifying this interpretation in detail would require some kind of material model.

== Generalization to curved spacetimes ==

Rindler coordinates as described above can be generalized to curved spacetime, as Fermi normal coordinates. The generalization essentially involves constructing an appropriate orthonormal tetrad and then transporting it along the given trajectory using the Fermi–Walker transport rule. For details, see the paper by Ni and Zimmermann in the references below. Such a generalization actually enables one to study inertial and gravitational effects in an Earth-based laboratory, as well as the more interesting coupled inertial-gravitational effects.

==History==
===Overview===
;Kottler–Møller and Rindler coordinates
Albert Einstein (1907) studied the effects within a uniformly accelerated frame, obtaining equations for coordinate dependent time dilation and speed of light equivalent to (), and in order to make the formulas independent of the observer&#x27;s origin, he obtained time dilation () in formal agreement with Radar coordinates. While introducing the concept of Born rigidity, Max Born (1909) noted that the formulas for hyperbolic motion can be used as transformations into a &quot;hyperbolically accelerated reference system&quot; () equivalent to (). Born&#x27;s work was further elaborated by Arnold Sommerfeld (1910) and Max von Laue (1911) who both obtained () using imaginary numbers, which was summarized by Wolfgang Pauli (1921) who besides coordinates () also obtained metric () using imaginary numbers. Einstein (1912) studied a static gravitational field and obtained the Kottler–Møller metric () as well as approximations to formulas () using a coordinate dependent speed of light. Hendrik Lorentz (1913) obtained coordinates similar to (, , ) while studying Einstein&#x27;s equivalence principle and the uniform gravitational field.

A detailed description was given by Friedrich Kottler (1914), who formulated the corresponding orthonormal tetrad, transformation formulas and metric (, ). Also Karl Bollert (1922) obtained the metric () in his study of uniform acceleration and uniform gravitational fields. In a paper concerned with Born rigidity, Georges Lemaître (1924) obtained coordinates and metric (, ). Albert Einstein and Nathan Rosen (1935) described (, ) as the &quot;well known&quot; expressions for a homogeneous gravitational field. After Christian Møller (1943) obtained (, ) in as study related to homogeneous gravitational fields, he (1952) as well as Misner &amp; Thorne &amp; Wheeler (1973) used Fermi–Walker transport to obtain the same equations.

While these investigations were concerned with flat spacetime, Wolfgang Rindler (1960) analyzed hyperbolic motion in curved spacetime, and showed (1966) the analogy between the hyperbolic coordinates (, ) in flat spacetime with Kruskal coordinates in Schwarzschild space. This influenced subsequent writers in their formulation of Unruh radiation measured by an observer in hyperbolic motion, which is similar to the description of Hawking radiation of black holes.

;Horizon
Born (1909) showed that the inner points of a Born rigid body in hyperbolic motion can only be in the region formula_106. Sommerfeld (1910) defined that the coordinates allowed for the transformation between inertial and hyperbolic coordinates must satisfy formula_107. Kottler (1914) defined this region as formula_108, and pointed out the existence of a &quot;border plane&quot; () formula_109, beyond which no signal can reach the observer in hyperbolic motion. This was called the &quot;horizon of the observer&quot; () by Bollert (1922). Rindler (1966) demonstrated the relation between such a horizon and the horizon in Kruskal coordinates.

;Radar coordinates
Using Bollert&#x27;s formalism, Stjepan Mohorovičić (1922) made a different choice for some parameter and obtained metric () with a printing error, which was corrected by Bollert (1922b) with another printing error, until a version without printing error was given by Mohorovičić (1923). In addition, Mohorovičić erroneously argued that metric (, now called Kottler–Møller metric) is incorrect, which was rebutted by Bollert (1922). Metric () was rediscovered by Harry Lass (1963), who also gave the corresponding coordinates () which are sometimes called &quot;Lass coordinates&quot;. Metric (), as well as (, ), was also derived by Fritz Rohrlich (1963). Eventually, the Lass coordinates (, ) were identified with Radar coordinates by Desloge &amp; Philpott (1987).

<text>Lisa Ann Walter (born August 3, 1963) is an American actress, comedian, and television producer, best known for her roles as Chessy the housekeeper in the romantic comedy film &quot;The Parent Trap&quot; (1998) and Melissa Schemmenti on the Peabody Award winning ABC mockumentary sitcom &quot;Abbott Elementary&quot; (2021–present), for which she received a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Ensemble in a Comedy Series.

She was formerly the creator and executive producer of Oxygen network reality weight-loss competition series, &quot;Dance Your Ass Off&quot;. Her other reality television work includes her stint as a judge on ABC&#x27;s reality television series &quot;The Next Best Thing: Who Is the Greatest Celebrity Impersonator?&quot;, and as winning celebrity editions of the game shows &quot;The Weakest Link&quot; and &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; She also created and starred in the 1996–1997 sitcom, &quot;Life&#x27;s Work&quot;, and appeared in such films as &quot;Bruce Almighty&quot;, &quot;Shall We Dance&quot;, and &quot;War of the Worlds&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Walter was born on August 3, 1963, in Silver Spring, Maryland. She and her older sister, Laura, are the children of a geophysicist British father who was born in France of Alsatian descent and a substitute-teacher/mother of Sicilian descent. Walter&#x27;s maternal great-grandparents immigrated to New York City from Italy. Walter&#x27;s family lived in different places following their father&#x27;s work, and their childhood homes included Germany and the suburbs of Washington, D.C. She graduated with a theater degree from Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., in 1983.

==Career==
After five years of standup comedy, Walter starred in her own Fox Network comedy series, &quot;My Wildest Dreams&quot; (1995), followed by an ABC sitcom, &quot;Life&#x27;s Work&quot; (1996–1997), which she both created and starred in. Walter also co-starred in the Bravo series &quot;Breaking News&quot; and in the NBC sitcom &quot;Emeril&quot;. She played Whoopi Goldberg&#x27;s tarty sidekick Claudine in &quot;Eddie&quot; (1996).

Walter co-starred in the Disney film &quot;The Parent Trap&quot; (1998); in the remake of the original film, she appeared as Chessy, the nanny to Dennis Quaid&#x27;s character&#x27;s daughter, who was played by a young Lindsay Lohan. Since then, she played supporting roles in the comedy &quot;Bruce Almighty&quot; (2003) and the romantic comedy &quot;Shall We Dance&quot; (2004).

In early 2007, Walter had a supporting role as Mabel, the bartender in the MyNetworkTV soap opera &quot;Watch Over Me&quot;. Later that May, she served as a judge on the ABC reality TV show &quot;The Next Best Thing&quot;, which searched for the best celebrity impersonators in America. In early 2008, Walter was in the comedy film &quot;Drillbit Taylor&quot;, and also starred in the VH1 reality series &quot;Celebracadabra&quot;, in which celebrities competed to see who was the best magician among them. She made it to the final three but was eliminated in the sixth episode. She has developed a series for the Oxygen network called &quot;Dance Your Ass Off&quot;. On December 19, 2011, she played a dramatic role on the TNT series &quot;Rizzoli &amp; Isles&quot; as a ballet coach.

Her comic memoir, &quot;The Best Thing About My Ass Is That It&#x27;s Behind Me&quot;, was published in May 2011. Beginning in May 2011, Walter hosted &quot;The Fabulous Lisa Ann Walter Show&quot;, a talk show on the Los Angeles radio station KFI. The program aired for three hours each Saturday and Sunday. In August 2014, Walter quit to focus on her acting career.

Since 2021, Walter&#x27;s appeared in the ABC comedy &quot;Abbott Elementary&quot; as second grade teacher Melissa Schemmenti. Walter, alongside the show&#x27;s ensemble cast, won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series at the 2023 ceremony and was nominated again the following year.

On October 20, 2022, Walter received the Virtuoso Award at the San Diego International Film Festival. In 2024, she won the second season of &quot;Celebrity Jeopardy!&quot;, defeating Mo Rocca and Katie Nolan in the finals. She won $1 million for the Entertainment Community Fund.

==Personal life==
In 1983, she married fellow actor Sam Baum. They had a son, Jordan (1988), and a daughter, Delia (1992) before divorcing in 1999. She has twin sons, Spencer and Simon Walter (11 October 2000).

== Early life and education ==

Steven John Carell was born on August 16, 1962 at Emerson Hospital in Concord, Massachusetts, the youngest of four brothers, and raised in nearby Acton, Massachusetts. His father, Edwin A. Carell (1925–2021), was a mechanical engineer, and his mother, Harriet Theresa (&quot;née&quot; Koch; 1925–2016), was a psychiatric nurse. Carell&#x27;s maternal uncle, Stanley Koch, worked with scientist Allen B. DuMont to create improved cathode ray tubes. His father was of Italian and German descent and his mother was of Polish ancestry. His father&#x27;s surname was originally Caroselli but it was changed to Carell in the 1950s.

Carell was raised Roman Catholic and was educated at Nashoba Brooks School, The Fenn School, and Middlesex School. He played ice hockey and lacrosse while in high school. He played the fife, performing with other members of his family, and later joined a reenacting group portraying the 10th (North Lincoln) Regiment of Foot. He attributed his interest in history to this, earning a degree in the subject from Denison University in Granville, Ohio, in 1984.

While at Denison, Carell was a member of Burpee&#x27;s Seedy Theatrical Company, a student-run improvisational comedy troupe, and was a goalie on the school&#x27;s Big Red hockey team for four years. He also spent time as a disc jockey under the name &quot;Sapphire Steve Carell&quot; at WDUB, the campus radio station.

== Career ==
===1989–2005: Early work and late night ===
Carell stated that he worked as a USPS mail carrier in Littleton, Massachusetts, but quit after seven months because his boss told him he was not very good at the job and needed to be faster. Early in his performing career, Carell acted onstage in a touring children&#x27;s theater company, later in the comedy musical &quot;Knat Scatt Private Eye&quot;, and in a television commercial for the restaurant chain Brown&#x27;s Chicken in 1989.

==== &quot;The Dana Carvey Show&quot; (1996) ====
In 1991, Carell performed with Chicago troupe The Second City where Stephen Colbert was his understudy for a time. Carell made his film debut in a minor role in &quot;Curly Sue&quot;. In spring 1996 he was a cast member of &quot;The Dana Carvey Show&quot;, a short-lived sketch comedy program on ABC. Along with fellow cast member Colbert, Carell provided the voice of Gary, half of &quot;The Ambiguously Gay Duo&quot;, the Robert Smigel-produced animated short which continued on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; later that year. While the program lasted only seven episodes, &quot;The Dana Carvey Show&quot; has since been credited with forging Carell&#x27;s career. He starred in a few short-lived television series, including &quot;Come to Papa&quot; and &quot;Over the Top&quot;. He has made numerous guest appearances, including in &quot;Funny Girl,&quot; an episode of &quot;Just Shoot Me!&quot; Additional screen credits include Brad Hall&#x27;s short-lived situation comedy &quot;Watching Ellie&quot; (20022003) and Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Melinda and Melinda&quot;.

==== &quot;The Daily Show&quot; (1999–2005) ====
Carell was a correspondent for &quot;The Daily Show&quot; from 1999 to 2005, with several regular segments including &quot;Even Stevphen&quot; with Stephen Colbert and &quot;Produce Pete.&quot;

=== 2004–2013: &quot;The Office&quot; and comedic roles ===
Carell&#x27;s first major film role was as weatherman Brick Tamland in the 2004 hit comedy &quot;&quot;. Struck by Carell&#x27;s performance in the film, &quot;Anchorman&quot; producer Judd Apatow approached Carell about creating a film together, and Carell told him about an idea he had involving a middle-aged man who is still a virgin. The result was the 2005 film &quot;The 40-Year-Old Virgin&quot;, which Carell and Apatow developed and wrote together, starring Carell as the title character. The film made $109 million in domestic box office sales and established him as a leading man. It also earned Carell an MTV Movie Award for Best Comedic Performance and a WGA Award nomination, along with Apatow, for Best Original Screenplay.

In 2005, Carell signed a deal with NBC to star in &quot;The Office&quot;, a remake of the British TV series of the same name which was created by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant. Developed by Greg Daniels this series, shot mockumentary-style, revolves around life at a mid-sized paper supply company. Carell played the role of Michael Scott, the immature, idiosyncratic regional manager of Dunder Mifflin, in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Although the first season of the adaptation suffered mediocre ratings, NBC renewed it for another season due to the anticipated success of Carell&#x27;s film &quot;The 40-Year-Old Virgin&quot;, and the series subsequently became a raging success. Carell won a Golden Globe Award and TCA Award in 2006 for his role in &quot;The Office&quot;. He received six consecutive Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series nominations for his work in the series (20062011). Carell earned approximately per episode of the third season of &quot;The Office&quot;, twice his salary for the previous two seasons. In an &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; interview, he commented on his salary, saying, &quot;You don&#x27;t want people to think you&#x27;re a pampered jerk. Salaries can be ridiculous. On the other hand, a lot of people are making a lot of money off of these shows.&quot;

Carell played Uncle Arthur, imitating the camp mannerisms of Paul Lynde&#x27;s original character, in &quot;Bewitched&quot;, a TV adaptation co-starring Nicole Kidman and Will Ferrell. He also voiced Hammy the Squirrel in the 2006 animated film, &quot;Over the Hedge&quot; and Ned McDodd, the mayor of Whoville, in the 2008 animated film &quot;Horton Hears a Who!&quot; He starred in &quot;Little Miss Sunshine&quot; during 2006, as Uncle Frank. His work in the films &quot;Anchorman&quot;, &quot;The 40-Year-Old Virgin&quot;, and &quot;Bewitched&quot; established Carell as a member of Hollywood&#x27;s so-called &quot;Frat Pack,&quot; a group of actors who often appear in films together, that also includes Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson, Will Ferrell, Jack Black, Vince Vaughn, Paul Rudd, and Luke Wilson. Carell acted as the title character of &quot;Evan Almighty&quot;, a sequel to &quot;Bruce Almighty&quot;, reprising his role as Evan Baxter, now a U.S. Congressman. The film received mostly negative reviews. Carell starred in the 2007 film &quot;Dan in Real Life&quot;, co-starring Dane Cook and Juliette Binoche. Carell played Maxwell Smart in the 2008 film &quot;Get Smart&quot;, an adaptation of the TV series starring Don Adams. It was successful, grossing over $230 million worldwide. During 2007, he was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

Carell was allowed &quot;flex time&quot; during filming to work on theatrical films. Carell worked on &quot;Evan Almighty&quot; during a production hiatus during the second season of &quot;The Office&quot;. Production ended during the middle of the fourth season of &quot;The Office&quot; because of Carell&#x27;s and others&#x27; refusal to cross the picket line of the 2007 Writers Guild of America strike. Carell, a WGA member, has written two episodes of &quot;The Office&quot;: &quot;Casino Night&quot; and &quot;Survivor Man.&quot; Both episodes were praised, and Carell won a Writers Guild of America Award for &quot;Casino Night.&quot; On April 29, 2010, Carell stated he would be leaving the show when his contract expired at the conclusion of the 20102011 season because he wanted to focus on his film career. However, according to interviews in &quot;The Office: The Untold Story of the Greatest Sitcom of the 2000s,&quot; Carell did not actually plan to leave at the time and was only &quot;thinking out loud&quot; during the interview, but after his statement failed to elicit a reaction from NBC, he decided it was best to move on.

In 2010 Carell starred with Tina Fey in &quot;Date Night&quot; and voiced Gru, the main character in the Universal CGI film &quot;Despicable Me&quot; along with Miranda Cosgrove, Kristen Wiig, and Julie Andrews. He reprised the role in the 2013 sequel &quot;Despicable Me 2,&quot; the third &quot;Despicable Me 3&quot; in 2017, and fourth &quot;Despicable Me 4&quot; in 2024. In 2008, Carousel signed a first look deal with Warner Bros. In 2009, his production company Carousel Productions launched a television arm and signed a deal with Universal Media Studios. He has several other projects in the works, including a remake of the 1967 Peter Sellers film &quot;The Bobo&quot;. He is doing voice-over work in commercials for Wrigley&#x27;s Extra gum. Carell has launched a television division of his production company, Carousel Productions, which has contracted a three-year overall deal with Universal Media Studios, the studio behind his NBC comedy series. Thom Hinkle and Campbell Smith of North South Prods., former producers on Comedy Central&#x27;s &quot;The Daily Show&quot;, were hired to manage Carousel&#x27;s TV operations.

His last episode as a main character, &quot;Goodbye, Michael,&quot; aired April 28, 2011, with his final shot showing Michael returning his microphone to the fictional documentary crew, before walking to a Colorado-bound plane to join his fiancée, Holly Flax, in Boulder, Colorado. His final line in this episode, to Pam Beesly, is thus unheard. Although he was invited back for the series finale in 2013, Carell originally declined believing that it would go against his character&#x27;s arc. Ultimately Carell did reprise the role briefly in the series finale. Also in 2013 Carell acted in the summer coming-of-age comedy &quot;The Way, Way Back&quot; starring Sam Rockwell, Maya Rudolph, and Allison Janney. Carell was asked about participating in a revival of the series in 2018, during the press day for &quot;Welcome to Marwen&quot;, Carell told Collider reporter Christina Radish, &quot;I&#x27;ll tell you, no... The show is way more popular now than when it was on the air. I just can&#x27;t see it being the same thing, and I think most folks would want it to be the same thing, but it wouldn&#x27;t be. Ultimately, I think it&#x27;s maybe best to leave well enough alone and just let it exist as what it was...I just wouldn&#x27;t want to make the mistake of making a less good version of it. The odds wouldn&#x27;t be in its favor, in terms of it recapturing exactly what it was, the first time.&quot;

=== 2014–2018: Dramatic film roles ===

In 2014, Carell starred in the true crime drama film &quot;Foxcatcher&quot; alongside Mark Ruffalo and Channing Tatum in which Carell played the millionaire and convicted murderer John Eleuthère du Pont. It premiered at the Cannes Film Festival. Carell was nominated for the Golden Globe for Best Actor and the Academy Award for Best Actor.
In 2015, Carell reprised his role as Gru for a cameo appearance in the film &quot;Minions&quot;.
Carell played activist Steven Goldstein in the gay rights drama &quot;Freeheld&quot;, replacing Zach Galifianakis, who dropped out due to scheduling conflicts. The film co-stars Julianne Moore, Elliot Page, and Michael Shannon, and was released in October 2015.

He followed this with another biographical drama, &quot;The Big Short&quot;, in which he portrayed banker Steve Eisman, whose name was changed in the film to Mark Baum. Directed by Adam McKay, the film stars Christian Bale, Ryan Gosling, and Brad Pitt, and it was released in December 2015. The film earned Carell a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actor. The film was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. The following year he replaced Bruce Willis in Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Café Society&quot; (2016), alongside Kristen Stewart and Jesse Eisenberg. The film premiered at the 69th Cannes Film Festival opening the festival. The film&#x27;s consensus on Rotten Tomatoes reads, &quot;Café Society&#x27;s lovely visuals and charming performances round out a lightweight late-period Allen comedy whose genuine pleasures offset its amiable predictability.&quot; In 2017, Carell headlined the biographical comedy-drama &quot;Battle of the Sexes&quot;, portraying tennis star Bobby Riggs, with Emma Stone co-starring as Billie Jean King. The film earned both Carell and Stone Golden Globe nominations. Carell also starred as Larry &quot;Doc&quot; Shepherd in the war comedy-drama film &quot;Last Flag Flying&quot; directed by Richard Linklater starring Laurence Fishburne and Bryan Cranston. 

In 2018, Carell starred in three films. He led the addiction drama &quot;Beautiful Boy&quot; as real life father David Sheff, whose son Nic (Timothée Chalamet) struggles with drug addiction. He also played Donald Rumsfeld in Adam McKay&#x27;s political satire, &quot;Vice&quot;, about the life of former Vice President Dick Cheney (Christian Bale). The film received mixed reviews, and went on to be nominated for eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture. His third 2018 role was starring as Mark Hogancamp of Marwencol in Robert Zemeckis&#x27; &quot;Welcome to Marwen&quot;. The film received a 32% on Rotten Tomatoes, with the critical consensus reading, &quot;&quot;Welcome to Marwen&quot; has dazzling effects and a sadly compelling story, but the movie&#x27;s disjointed feel and clumsy screenplay make this invitation easy to decline.&quot; The movie was a box office failure, grossing $12.7 million against a budget of around $49 million.

=== 2019–present: Career expansion ===
In 2019, Carell returned to television to star in the Apple TV+ drama series &quot;The Morning Show&quot; opposite Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston. Carell played Mitch Kessler, a morning news show anchor who is struggling to maintain relevance after being fired due to a sexual misconduct accusation. &quot;The Morning Show&quot; received a two-season order from Apple. The first season premiered in the fall of 2019 and the second season premiered in 2020. For his performance in the first season, Carell was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series, his eleventh Emmy nomination overall. Carell had originally signed a one-year deal with Apple to star in the first season only but he signed on to star in the second season in October 2019.

Since May 2020, Carell also starred in the Netflix workplace comedy series &quot;Space Force,&quot; based on the proposed space warfare service branch of the United States Armed Forces: the United States Space Force. Carell created and produces &quot;Space Force&quot; with Greg Daniels, who created and produced &quot;The Office&quot;. Carell also wrote the pilot episode with Daniels. The show was renewed for a second season in November 2020. Carell starred in the political comedy film &quot;Irresistible&quot;, written and directed by Jon Stewart. The film was initially set for a theatrical release in May 2020. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, the film was released on Premium VOD and selected theaters on June 26, 2020. In 2022, Carell reprised his role as Gru in the film &quot;&quot;. He also starred in (and served as executive producer for) FX on Hulu&#x27;s ten-episode original series &quot;The Patient&quot;; in that series, Carell portrays a therapist who is imprisoned by a serial killer who wants to resist the urge to kill. Carell replaced Bill Murray, who contracted COVID-19, in Wes Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Asteroid City&quot; (2023).

In 2023, it was announced that Carell would be making his Broadway debut as the title role in the Lincoln Center revival of Anton Chekov&#x27;s &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; at the Vivian Beaumont Theatre. The production will be directed by Lila Neugebauer and Carell will star alongside Alison Pill, William Jackson Harper, Alfred Molina, Anika Noni Rose and Jayne Houdyshell.

== Personal life ==

On August 5, 1995, Carell married &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; cast member Nancy Walls, whom he met when she was a student in an improv class he was teaching at The Second City Training Center. They have a daughter named Elisabeth Anne (born May 2001) and a son named John (born June 2004).

Carell and his wife have appeared together in the comedy films &quot;The 40-Year-Old Virgin&quot; and &quot;Seeking a Friend for the End of the World&quot;, as well as the comedy series &quot;The Daily Show&quot; and &quot;The Office&quot;. They also co-created the comedy series &quot;Angie Tribeca&quot;.

In February 2009, Carell purchased the Marshfield Hills General Store in Marshfield, Massachusetts.

In an interview with &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, Carell cited George Carlin, John Cleese, Bill Cosby, Steve Martin, and Peter Sellers as his inspirations for acting and comedy.

<doc id="1327716" wikidata="Q508428" url="?curid=1327716" title="Nora Dunn">
<text>Nora Dunn (born April 29, 1952) is an American actress and comedian. She first garnered popularity during her tenure as a cast member on the NBC sketch comedy series &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; from 1985 to 1990. Following her departure from &quot;SNL&quot;, she played Dr. Reynolds in &quot;The Nanny&quot; from 1998 to 1999, and she had a recurring role as Muriel in &quot;Home Economics&quot; from 2021 to 2022.

==Early life==
Dunn was born in Chicago, Illinois, the daughter of Margaret (née East), a nurse, and John Dunn, a musician and poet. She has two brothers, actor Kevin Dunn and Michael Dunn, a high school history teacher and football coach as well as one sister, Cathy Zimmerman. She was raised in a Catholic family, and has Irish, English, Scottish and German ancestry.

==Career==

===&quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;===
Dunn joined &quot;SNL&quot; in 1985 with the return of Lorne Michaels as executive producer. The 1985–1986 season proved to be a ratings disaster, and she was one of only five cast members who was not fired at its end (the others were newcomers Jon Lovitz, A. Whitney Brown, Dennis Miller and longtime featured player Al Franken).

Dunn&#x27;s characters included half of &quot;The Sweeney Sisters&quot; lounge act alongside Jan Hooks, as well as talk show host Pat Stevens (which became a popular recurring role starting in the low-rated 1985–1986 season), melodramatic French hooker Babette, and film buff Ashley Ashley from the &quot;Actors on Film&quot; sketch from the 1985–1986 season. Her impressions included Ann Landers, Imelda Marcos, Liza Minnelli, Tyne Daly, Joan Baez, Martina Navratilova, and Cokie Roberts.

Dunn made headlines in 1990 when she, along with original musical guest Sinéad O&#x27;Connor, boycotted an episode that was hosted by comedian Andrew Dice Clay because they found his misogynistic humor offensive. Looking back on the incident ahead of &quot;SNL&quot;&#x27;s 40th anniversary, she explained, &quot;Lorne said, &#x27;Andrew Dice Clay was a phenomenon worth examining.&#x27; And yeah, he was a phenomenon, but if you’re going to examine him, he shouldn’t be the host, you should write an article. We didn’t examine the hosts of &quot;SNL&quot;.&quot;&quot; We supported them, we wrote for them, and we made them look good. Otherwise you’d never get a host. You’re there to make them look good […] My objection to Andrew Dice Clay was that his character was only about one thing: abusing women and laughing about abusing women. There was nothing else behind it. There was nothing else about it except to make him look harmless.&quot;

====Recurring characters on &quot;SNL&quot;====
* Ashley Ashley, a pretentious film critic from the recurring sketch, &quot;Actors on Film&quot; (her partner was Jimmy Chance, played by Robert Downey, Jr.)
* Babette, a melodramatic French prostitute
* Pat Stevens, a model turned talk show host
* Denise Venetti, host of &quot;Learning To Feel&quot;
* Dr. Norma Hoeffering, a lesbian psychiatrist who writes male-bashing self-help books
* Liz Sweeney, one of two singing sisters (the other played by Jan Hooks)
* Loose Chang, Ching Chang&#x27;s (Dana Carvey) love interest
* Mrs. Campbell, Wayne Campbell&#x27;s (Mike Myers) mom

===Other work===
Dunn appeared in recurring roles on &quot;Sisters&quot; from 1993–1996 and &quot;The Nanny&quot; from 1998–1999, as well as a guest-starring role in a two-part episode of &quot;The X-Files&quot; in 1998. In the 8th episode of the 9th season of crime procedural drama &quot;Bones&quot;, she played author Tess Brown, a feuding rival of protagonist Temperance Brennan.
In 2015 she appeared in the fourth season of &quot;New Girl&quot;. In 2009, Dunn played the sister-in-law of Frank Reynolds in &quot;It&#x27;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia&quot;.

Her film work includes &quot;Working Girl&quot; (1988), &quot;How I Got into College&quot; (1989), &quot;Miami Blues&quot; (1990), &quot;I Love Trouble&quot; (1994), &quot;Shake, Rattle and Rock!&quot; (1994), &quot;The Last Supper&quot; (1995), &quot;Three Kings&quot; (1999), &quot;What Planet Are You From?&quot; (2000), &quot;What&#x27;s the Worst That Could Happen?&quot; (2001), &quot;Zoolander&quot; (2001), &quot;Max Keeble&#x27;s Big Move&quot; (2001), &quot;Bruce Almighty&quot; (2003), &quot;Runaway Jury&quot; (2003), &quot;The Hebrew Hammer&quot; (2003), &quot;Love for Rent&quot; (2005), &quot;Pineapple Express&quot; (2008), &quot;My Suicide&quot; (2009), &quot;LOL&quot; (2012), &quot;Entourage&quot; (2015) and &quot;The Lost Husband&quot; (2020).

In 2014, Dunn began appearing in a series of commercials for Clorox. She has also been a storytelling contributor to Chicago&#x27;s Under the Gun Theater.

==Personal life==
Dunn is a fan of the Chicago Bears of the National Football League and the Chicago Blackhawks of the National Hockey League.

<doc id="1327717" wikidata="Q843723" url="?curid=1327717" title="Tohoku Broadcasting Company">
<text>is a Japanese TV and radio network affiliated with the Japan News Network (JNN), Japan Radio Network (JRN) and National Radio Network (NRN). Its headquarters are located in Miyagi Prefecture, Tōhoku region.
==History==
Tohoku Shimbun established &quot;Kita Nippon Commercial Broadcasting Co., Ltd.&quot; in December 1947, which was the first attempt to establish a private radio station in northeastern Japan. However, the occupied government of the time didn&#x27;t permit private broadcasters to begin operating, causing the plan to collapse. After the &quot;Three Radio Laws&quot; were passed in 1950, three companies in Miyagi Prefecture, Tohoku Shinpo, Tohoku Broadcasting and Sendai Municipal Broadcasting, applied to establish private radio stations. The latter three companies were integrated into &quot;Radio Sendai Co., Ltd.&quot;, and the company name was changed to Sendai Broadcasting on February 22, 1951, and a preliminary license was obtained on April 21.

On December 10, Sendai Broadcasting officially registered as a company, but still used the name &quot;Sendai Radio&quot; when broadcasting. On April 5 of the following year, Sendai Radio began trial broadcasting. On May 1, Radio Sendai officially launched, becoming the first private radio station in the Tohoku region and the 11th private radio station in Japan. In January 1953, Sendai Broadcasting Tohoku the company name to Tohoku Broadcasting. In the same year, Northeast Broadcasting implemented stock dividends for the first time.

Northeast Broadcasting received its preliminary television license on November 22, 1957. In order to prepare for broadcasting television, Northeast Broadcasting began to build a television headquarters in 1958. On March 14, 1959, TBC began its pilot TV service. On April 1, TBC officially started broadcasting TV programs, becoming the first private TV station in Tohoku. Shortly after the broadcast, Tohoku Broadcasting participated in the broadcast of the wedding of Crown Prince Akihito and Masada Michiko. Tohoku Broadcasting joined JNN in the same year as the TV broadcast and was one of the founding members of JNN. On the occasion of its 10th anniversary, Tohoku Broadcasting adopted a new logo designed by Yusaku Kamekura in 1961. The following year, Tohoku Broadcasting donated a fountain to the Sendai City Hall. Tohoku Broadcasting decided to build a new headquarters, Tohoku Broadcasting Hall, in Yagiyama in 1961. This building has 5 floors and is adjacent to the existing TV headquarters. The total floor area is 11,111 square meters. It was completed on May 6, 1963. Starting from August 1 of the same year, the Northeast Broadcasting Department began to operate in the Tohoku Broadcasting Hall.

TBC began broadcasting color TV on October 1, 1964, and was the first private TV station in Tohoku to start broadcasting color TV. Later, Tohoku Broadcasting realized full-color broadcast of the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. In 1967, on the occasion of the 15th anniversary of the launch of the station, Tohoku Broadcasting went to various parts of the West Coast of the United States to collect footage. It was the first overseas collection of materials since the launch. With the launch of Higashinippon Broadcasting in 1975, Miyagi Prefecture had gained four private television stations. In addition, it coincided with the Japanese economy transitioning from a period of rapid growth to a period of stable growth after the first oil crisis. TBC therefore faces more intense advertising competition. Although Tohoku Broadcasting&#x27;s turnover continued to grow in the 1970s, its profits continued to decrease from 1973 to 1977. In this regard, Tohoku Broadcasting has developed non-advertising revenue by organizing large-scale events and other methods. In 1970, Northeast Broadcasting held the TBC Housing Comprehensive Exhibition, covering the field of housing industry. From 1976 to 1981, Tohoku Broadcasting ranked first among the four private TV stations in Miyagi Prefecture in all-day and prime-time ratings. In 1980, Tohoku Broadcasting began broadcasting stereo TV programs.

Tohoku Broadcasting introduced a new logo in April 1992. In 2002, Tohoku Broadcasting obtained the weather forecast business license operator qualification from the Japan Meteorological Agency and was able to issue its own weather forecast. In 2004, Tohoku Broadcasting expanded its headquarters and opened the &quot;B-site&quot; building for television news. Sendai Broadcasting began broadcasting digital TV on December 1, 2005 at the same time as NHK Sendai Broadcasting Station, Sendai Broadcasting, and Miyagi TV. Affected by the Great East Japan Earthquake, Iwate, Miyagi, and Fukushima prefectures in the Tohoku region shut down analog TV later than in other parts of Japan, on March 31, 2012. TBC shut down its analog signal on that date. In January 2020, the new headquarters of Tohoku Broadcasting were completed. The building has 5 floors above ground and 1 floor underground, with a total floor area of 9,755 square meters. In May of the same year, the TBC Radio division began broadcasting from the new headquarters. The television division began broadcasting from the new headquarters in June. At the same time as moving into the new headquarters, Northeast Broadcasting carried out a new corporate identity and launched a new logo.

<doc id="1327722" wikidata="Q2667279" url="?curid=1327722" title="Birney">
<text>A Birney or Birney Safety Car is a type of streetcar that was manufactured in the United States in the 1910s and 1920s. The design was small and light and was intended to be an economical means of providing frequent service at a lower infrastructure and labor cost than conventional streetcars. Production of Birney cars lasted from 1915 until 1930, and more than 6,000 of the original, single-truck version were built. Several different manufacturers built Birney cars. The design was &quot;the first mass-produced standard streetcar (albeit with minor variations)&quot; in North America.

==Invention==
The Birney car was the joint 1915 invention of Charles Birney and Joseph Bosenbury (who was issued the patents in 1917 and 1919, and assigned half to Birney; see Brill page 140). Birney was an engineer with the firm of Stone &amp; Webster, an operator of a number of trolley systems in the United States in the early part of the 20th century. The design was named the &quot;Safety Car&quot;, and became known as the &quot;Birney Safety Car&quot; and ultimately simply as the &quot;Birney&quot; car.

The vehicle was a return to single-truck (single-bogie) streetcars. Birneys were small and light, about a third the weight of conventional cars of the period; were of rugged, standardized construction; mass-produced and inexpensively built. Twin motors gave them nimble acceleration. Birney cars averaged about in length and typically had seating for about 32 passengers.

The largest producer of Birney Safety Cars was the American Car Company, a subsidiary of the J. G. Brill Company, but several other companies also manufactured Birneys (e.g. Ottawa Car Company).

==Benefits and safety features==

The Birney was designed to operate with only a motorman, saving the cost of the conductor. The advent of World War I made single-person operation additionally attractive as it addressed the wartime labor shortage. When labor was available, Birneys could be operated at more frequent intervals, prompting the slogan &quot;A Car in Sight at all Times&quot;. This latter attraction was one of the street railway industry&#x27;s first attempts to deal directly with automobile competition.

The Birney Car also introduced the use of pneumatically balanced and interlocked doors. If a door was stuck open, or a passenger or other object blocked the door, the motors could not be started.

The controls on the Birney Car also included an early application of the &quot;deadman control&quot;. This device removed power from the car&#x27;s motors and applied the air brakes if the controller handle was released for any reason, causing the car to come to an abrupt stop.

A longer, double-truck version of the Birney car was developed in the 1920s, incorporating its most successful features. The first of these were ordered in 1918 by the Cape Breton Electric Company, which later cancelled the order. The two cars – the only double-truck center-entrance Birney cars to be built – were eventually delivered to the Waterbury and Milldale Tramway in 1921. Double-truck Birney cars were sold to a number of systems, including that of Tampa, Florida, and to the Texas Interurban Railway, which used them exclusively. In addition to 11 double-truck passenger cars, which featured deluxe interior appointments and toilets for interurban service, the Texas Interurban operated three unusual Birney-based double-truck express cars without passenger seats or windows– the only cars of this type ever built.

==Decline==
Thousands of the cars were purchased from their inception to a few years after the end of the war. Production peaked in 1920, with 1,699 cars built in that year alone, but then declined rapidly and ended in 1930.

Birney cars began to fall from favor in part because of the features that had originally made them attractive. Their light weight could be a problem in snow that a heavier car could easily plow through. Their short length made their ride quality comparatively poor, and on poorly maintained track they derailed easily. The public began to deride them as flimsy. Their limited passenger capacity rendered them unsuitable for busy routes and rush hour service, causing them to be relegated to minor lines or to be sold mostly to small-town streetcar systems.

The streetcar companies also found that the safety features of the Birney, such as the use of interlocked doors to prevent the car from starting if a door was open or a passenger was stuck, could be incorporated in larger cars and that the public was not as disturbed by the absence of the conductor as the companies had feared.

==International use==
Its initial rise and fall notwithstanding, the Birney car was useful and durable, and many were shipped to streetcar systems in other countries, especially ones located in smaller cities and towns, where they served for additional decades. For example, the city of Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, bought up Birneys secondhand from other systems (including 22 acquired from the Toronto Transportation Commission (TTC) and five from Bakersfield and Kern Electric Railway) across North America to build an &quot;all-Birney fleet&quot; and keep its streetcar system going in the difficult years of the Great Depression and World War II, finally retiring its last car in 1949. The Toronto Civic Railways operated 25 Birney cars in Toronto from 1920 to 1921 when the TTC took over the TCR and continued operating the cars until 1940 (remaining 14 cars were sold to Halifax excluding 3 sold to Cornwall in 1926 and 8 to Halifax in 1927).

Although the vast majority of the cars built were sold to streetcar operators in North America (including in Mexico and Cuba), a small number went to much more distant places, such as Australia and New Zealand. In the latter, Birney cars were imported for use by the provincial centres of New Plymouth in the North Island and Invercargill in the South Island, reputedly the world&#x27;s most southerly tramway system. 

Cities in South America whose streetcar companies purchased Birney cars included Concordia and Paraná, in Argentina, while Guayaquil in Ecuador obtained Birneys secondhand from Trenton, New Jersey. The Colombian cities of Medellín and Pereira both were served by Birney streetcars, the former&#x27;s fleet being made up entirely of Birney cars – 61 of them – of both single- and double-truck configuration. In 1930, the Curitiba, Brazil, tramway system bought 20 second-hand Birney cars from Boston and these cars were converted to metre gauge.

In Australia the Municipal Tramways Trust, Adelaide purchased four as its Type G tram; the Melbourne &amp; Metropolitan Tramways Board purchased two as its X class; and the Melbourne Electric Supply Company (Geelong) purchased two. The two Birneys in Geelong were unusual, having been built with longitudinal seating. These and the four Adelaide cars were transferred to Bendigo in 1947, where four of them remained in revenue service until 1972. One each of the Geelong and Adelaide cars is operational on the Bendigo Tramways heritage line; the three other Adelaide cars are held by the Tramway Museum, St Kilda, South Australia, with one in regular service.

==Preservation and continued use==

A number of Birney cars remain in use today in North America at trolley museums and heritage streetcar operations. Single examples of original Birney cars are in service on heritage streetcar lines in Tampa, Florida; Fort Collins, Colorado; San Jose, California, and Fort Smith, Arkansas, as well as on the M-Line Trolley line in Dallas, Texas. Three of these cars, Fort Collins car 21, Fort Collins car 22, and Fort Smith car 224, are listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. In Canada, the Nelson Electric Tramway (in Nelson, B.C.) has one fully restored Birney car. Additionally, replica Birney cars built by Gomaco are in service in at least four U.S. cities (see below).

In Australia, seven of the eight Birney cars imported there have survived in operating condition: five are at Bendigo Tramways including the two ex-Geelong cars and three from Adelaide, one G type at the Adelaide Tramway Museum, St Kilda, and one Melbourne X class housed at the Hawthorn tram depot in Melbourne. Thus, Australia has a high proportion of the world&#x27;s surviving, operable Birney cars. In New Zealand, New Plymouth Birney No. 8 is preserved by Wanganui Tramways, and Invercargill Birney car No. 15, restored by the Tramway Historical Society at Ferrymead Heritage Park, Christchurch, operates on the Christchurch tramway. Invercargill No.16 was recently rediscovered and recovered to the Bill Richardson Transport World in Invercargill and is being restored for static display.

===Replica Birney cars===
In the United States, the Gomaco Trolley Company has built at least 18 replica Birney cars, in the style of the less-common double-truck Birney car design, since 1999. Gomaco fitted these with trucks from ex-Milan, Italy Peter Witt streetcars. These have been supplied to Tampa, Florida; Charlotte, North Carolina; Little Rock, Arkansas and Memphis, Tennessee. Gomaco also restored an original single-truck Birney car body in 2002–3 for the Fresno Metropolitan Flood Control District in Fresno, California; this was intended for static display in a local park.

<doc id="1327729" wikidata="Q242586" url="?curid=1327729" title="Diane Neal">
<text>Diane Neal (born November 17, 1976) is an American actress. She is best known for portraying New York Assistant District Attorney Casey Novak in the television series &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; from 2003 to 2012. She is also known for portraying Coast Guard Investigative Service (CGIS) Special Agent Abigail Borin in the &quot;NCIS&quot; franchise.

== Early life ==

Neal was born in Alexandria, Virginia, the youngest of three daughters to Colleen Neal, a math teacher of Jewish descent, and Christopher Neal, a federal attorney. She was raised in Littleton, Arapahoe County, Colorado, and Ohio. After Neal graduated from Littleton&#x27;s Heritage High School, she moved to Hawaii to attend college, but later left school to become a model and travel. Neal started modeling for Shiseido and Pond&#x27;s skin-care ads. After deciding to resume her education, Neal began attending Harvard University&#x27;s Extension School in 2009, and graduated with an associate degree in May 2018.

== Career ==
=== Acting ===
Neal first appeared on &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; as a guest star, playing a rapist in the Season 3 episode &quot;Ridicule&quot;. Neal first appeared as Assistant District Attorney Casey Novak in the show&#x27;s fifth season, replacing Stephanie March, who played Alexandra Cabot.

Neal portrayed Novak through the end of Season 9, when the character exited the series after being censured by the New York State Bar. In 2011, Neal reprised her role as Novak in the Season 12 episode &quot;Reparations&quot;, when Novak returned to SVU as their temporary ADA. After that appearance, she became a recurring character in Season 13. She was last seen in the episode &quot;Valentine&#x27;s Day&quot;. Neal said of her return to the series in Season 13 to &quot;TV Guide&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s back on track to what the original &quot;SVU&quot; was intended to be, which is about sex crimes and crimes against children, it&#x27;s got more of a nitty-gritty feel.&quot; She says that March&#x27;s and her return to the fictional universe of the series provided a familiarity for viewers following original cast member Chris Meloni&#x27;s departure. &quot;I think they should put us in the court room together!&quot; she says about March.

In 2021, Neal starred as Peggy Sue Thomas in the Lifetime movie &quot;Circle of Deception&quot;.

=== Congressional run ===
On February 6, 2018, Neal announced that she would run for the U.S. House of Representatives in New York&#x27;s 19th congressional district as an independent. She described her political views as &quot;a little libertarian, I&#x27;m a lot liberal, mostly progressive, but I have this amazing ability to be able to take really complicated policy and break it down into edible sound bites, which is something most progressive liberals cannot do.&quot; Neal finished with 1% of the vote.

=== Podcast ===

On January 14, 2022, Neal announced that she would be the host of a new comedy and talk podcast named &quot;Hear Say with Diane Neal&quot;. The podcast is intended to &quot;amuse and enlighten&quot;.

== Personal life ==
In 2005, Neal married Irish model Marcus O. Fitzgerald in a ceremony in the Dominican Republic. Neal and Fitzgerald divorced in 2014.

Neal was later involved in a relationship with magician JB Benn. It ended acrimoniously, and in November 2019, Neal became the plaintiff in a lawsuit in which she made allegations against Benn including fraud and identity theft, and she claimed Benn had subjected her to physical and sexual abuse.

In 2013, Neal was involved in a car accident which fractured her spine. In announcing her 2018 Congressional candidacy, Neal indicated that the long recuperation from her injuries had caused her to place her acting career on hold.

In 2023, after experiencing anti-Semitism in the US, Neal moved to Israel and became an Israeli citizen.

<doc id="1327730" wikidata="Q7501304" url="?curid=1327730" title="Shore Line East">
<text>Shore Line East (SLE) is a commuter rail service which operates along the Northeast Corridor through southern Connecticut, United States. The rail service is a fully owned subsidiary of the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) and is operated under the CT Rail brand. SLE provides service seven days a week along the Northeast Corridor between New London and New Haven; limited through service west of New Haven to Bridgeport and Stamford operates during weekday rush hours. Cross-platform transfers to Metro-North Railroad New Haven Line trains are available at New Haven for service to southwestern Connecticut and New York City. Pre-COVID, around 2,200 riders used the service on weekdays.

The service was introduced in 1990 as a temporary measure to reduce congestion during construction work on I-95. However, it proved more popular than expected, and service was continued after construction ended despite criticisms that the line was too expensive to operate. Limited service was extended to New London in 1996 and to Stamford in 2001. A second station in New Haven was added in 2002, and most of the stations were rebuilt for accessibility between 2001 and 2008. Reverse peak service was added in 2007, followed by weekend service in 2008. Second platforms were added to several stations between 2014 and 2022 to support bidirectional service.

Service was temporarily cut during 2018–2019 due to Amtrak track work and a locomotive shortage. It was again cut in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Diesel trains were replaced by Kawasaki M8 electric multiple units in May 2022. Proposals for future expansion include extensions to Westerly, Rhode Island, and Norwich, Connecticut, and an infill station in Niantic.

==Service==

Most weekday SLE trains run local between New London and New Haven, with one peak train in each direction operating through New Haven as far as Stamford. Eastbound morning trains and westbound afternoon trains skip because it only has one platform, and trains operating in the other direction would have to switch tracks to serve the station. All trains that do not operate west of New Haven make a connection with a Metro-North Railroad New Haven Line train at New Haven, for service to and from points in Connecticut, Westchester County, New York, and New York City. These connections are commonly used by extreme commuters who live in suburban Connecticut and work in New York City. New London SLE multi-ride pass holders are also allowed to board selected &quot;Northeast Regional&quot; trains.

Although SLE service is funded by CTDOT, it is operated under contract by Amtrak. Amtrak owns and controls the Northeast Corridor east of New Haven. West of New Haven, the New Haven Line is owned by CTDOT and trains are dispatched by Metro-North.

During the OpSail and SailFest tall ship festivals at New London, extra Friday and weekend service is operated from New Haven to New London. During OpSail 2000, through service operated from New Haven to Mystic – the only time Shore Line East service has run east of New London.
==Service history==
===Previous service===

The section of the Northeast Corridor that Shore Line East operates on was once the New York–Boston mainline of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad. The section from New Haven to New London was built as the New Haven and New London Railroad. It was charted in 1848, began construction in 1850, and opened for service in July 1852. The line was owned by the New York, Providence and Boston Railroad (the &quot;Stonington Road&quot;) from 1858 to 1862, and by the Shore Line Railway from 1864 until it was acquired by the New York, New Haven, and Hartford Railroad (the &quot;New Haven&quot;) in 1870. Crossing the Connecticut River required a ferry transfer until a drawbridge was built in 1870.

The line was referred to by the New Haven Railroad as the &quot;Shore Line&quot;, to distinguish it from the railroad&#x27;s &quot;Main Line&quot; from New Haven to Springfield, Massachusetts. In recognition of the large role played by the New Haven in the history of Connecticut, CTDOT painted SLE&#x27;s diesel-powered locomotives in the New Haven&#x27;s orange and black style. New Haven Railroad colors and emblems were placed at several stations, particularly New Haven Union Station.

The New Haven Railroad operated local service on the Shore Line up until its merger with Penn Central on January 1, 1969, when most commuter service east of New Haven was abandoned. Intercity service continued, but generally only stopped at New Haven, Old Saybrook, and New London. Penn Central continued to operate the &quot;Clamdigger&quot;, a single daily New London-New Haven round trip with local stops, as well as a New London-Boston round trip. Amtrak took over the &quot;Clamdigger&quot; along with most intercity passenger service, in May 1971. In January 1972, Amtrak discontinued the &quot;Clamdigger&quot; and Penn Central cut the New London–Boston trip.

In 1976–77, Amtrak operated the &quot;Clamdigger&quot; as a Providence-New Haven round trip with limited local stops; for three months in 1978, it was revived with additional commuter-based stops. It was replaced in April 1978 by the New Haven–Providence–Boston &quot;Beacon Hill&quot;, which made local stops including Branford, Madison, Old Saybrook, Niantic, New London, and Mystic. The &quot;Beacon Hill&quot; (which served the Providence and Boston commuting markets rather than New Haven) was discontinued in 1981 due to funding cuts, ending commuter rail service in Connecticut east of New Haven.

===Initial service===

In 1981 and 1986, legislation was proposed to restore commuter service between New Haven and New London, as well as between New Haven and Hartford. A 1986 CTDOT study analyzed congestion on Interstate 95, which runs parallel to the line. The study showed that Old Saybrook was a better terminus for initial service, with an expected ridership of 420 riders in each direction daily. An additional study in 1989 indicated higher potential ridership of 700 to 1350 daily riders.

Based on the 1986 study, Governor William O&#x27;Neill ordered CTDOT in October 1986 to initiate rail service on the corridor. It was established as a temporary service to newly reopened local stations between Union Station in New Haven and Old Saybrook, to alleviate traffic congestion that arose from scheduled construction work on I-95. O&#x27;Neill introduced a $50 million transportation program that included $900,000 (later reduced to $500,000) for basic stations and $4 million to refurbish 12 Budd Rail Diesel Cars for rolling stock. The RDCs were found to be insufficient and two diesel trainsets were purchased from the defunct PATrain service in 1989 instead. Testing of the equipment on the Northeast Corridor began on December 2, 1989.

The state bought Amtrak&#x27;s New Haven maintenance facility in May 1989 and signed a service contract with Amtrak in November. Construction of 5 intermediate stations was completed in April 1990. Shore Line East service began on May 29, 1990, with four trains each direction during the morning and evening. The service carried the &quot;Clamdigger&quot; name during planning; &quot;Shore Line East&quot; did not appear until shortly before service began. Shore Line East was threatened to be cut in 1991 by newly elected Governor Lowell Weicker, but it proved more popular than expected, and was effectively made permanent. A 1996 study found that Shore Line East captured eight percent of regional commuter trips and attracted a loyal ridership base.

In 1995 and 1997, then-governor John Rowland proposed to replace Shore Line East and the Waterbury Branch with bus service, citing a high subsidy of $18.70 per rider per trip, in order to decrease the unpopular gas tax. Lawmakers from the region called the proposals political and defended the line&#x27;s ability to reduce congestion and pollution, while opponents of the line called it an example of government waste. The Shore Line East Rider&#x27;s Association and other groups lobbied to save both services each time, and after public hearings a small fare increase was enacted in late 1997 instead.

===Early expansions===

In July 1995, Governor Rowland signed a bill ordering various studies, including one that analyzed extending service to New London as had been originally planned. Before the study was completed, CTDOT unilaterally decided to implement New London service, which the report commended. On February 1, 1996, two round trips per weekday were extended to New London. At that point, ridership was up 18 percent over 1991 numbers.

In December 2001, a single morning rush-hour round trip branded SLExpress was extended to Stamford, with a stop at Bridgeport plus eastbound-only stops at Stratford and Milford. An evening eastbound trip was also extended to Stamford with only the Bridgeport intermediate stop. This trip was intended to allow commuters to reach employment centers in Bridgeport and Stamford without having to make a transfer at New Haven. On June 24, 2002, additional Stamford trains were added, for a total of two westbound and three eastbound trains. South Norwalk station was added as a stop for the single morning eastbound trip. When opened on August 18, 2013, it was added to these trips as well.

In 2003, in order to add four additional Amtrak trips along the corridor, four of the six round trips to New London were cut back to Old Saybrook. An agreement with the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection limits service over the Amtrak Old Saybrook–Old Lyme Bridge in order to avoid inconveniencing recreational boaters. CTDOT&#x27;s agreement with Amtrak allowed commuters with monthly passes to ride certain Amtrak trains instead. After criticism over the service cuts, in April 2008 CTDOT began allowing commuters with multi-ride passes to board the selected Amtrak trains as well.

===Station reconstruction===

Because Shore Line East was intended to be a temporary service, the five intermediate stations built in 1990 were little more than wooden decks. Since the service was started two months before the Americans with Disabilities Act was signed, the platforms were not built to be accessible. In January 2001, because of changes in Amtrak rules related to the introduction of &quot;Acela Express&quot; service, passengers were no longer allowed to cross tracks to access trains. New platforms were opened on the south side of the tracks at Branford and Westbrook at approximately the same locations. Later that year, accessible high-level platforms were added at New London to support &quot;Acela Express&quot; service.

On June 7, 2002, State Street station was opened in New Haven to provide better access to the downtown area than Union Station. It was built as a traffic mitigation measure during the reconstruction of the Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge. The first existing station to be rebuilt specifically for Shore Line East was Old Saybrook. A new high-level island platform and pedestrian bridge opened on November 1, 2002; the final configuration of two platforms serving all three tracks allows Amtrak trains to pass SLE trains at the station.
Beginning on May 24, 2004, construction of new platforms began at Clinton, Guilford, and Branford. The rebuilt Clinton station opened on July 25, 2005, and the rebuilt Branford station opened on August 8, 2005; both consist of a single high-level platform on the south side of the tracks. The new Guilford station, which has platforms on both sides of the tracks (connected by a pedestrian bridge) to allow for greater operational flexibility, opened on November 28, 2005. Construction at Madison started on September 24, 2007, and finished with the opening of the rebuilt station platform on July 28, 2008.

Reconstruction of Westbrook station was delayed due to environmental and cost issues. No site was available until Westbrook and CTDOT traded the new station site on Norris Avenue for a highway garage site off Route 145. The controversial land swap was begun in 2004 but was not finalized until 2006, and town operations were not moved to the Route 145 site until September 2011. Site clearing began in November 2011, and ground was broken for the $14.4 million station in January 2012. A new station with a larger 210-space lot and platforms on both tracks opened on March 25, 2014, with full bidirectional service to the station beginning on May 11.

===Weekend and New London service===

On October 8, 2007, reverse-peak and more midday service were introduced, which officials hailed as the beginning of Shore Line East as a true bidirectional system. Several existing express trains also began to stop at Guilford. A pilot of weekend service was run from November 17, 2007, to December 30, 2007, with six &quot;Shopper&#x27;s Special&quot; round trips from Old Saybrook to New Haven. The trains were scheduled to connect with similar Metro-North specials at New Haven. Year-round weekend service began on July 4, 2008, with 9 daily Old Saybrook – New Haven round trips on weekends. No weekend service was run to New London, but weekday service was increased by the addition of cross-honoring of multiple-ride and monthly tickets on two Amtrak trains.

The major obstacle preventing full New London service was the bridge over the Connecticut River between Old Saybrook and Old Lyme. The drawbridge section is closed for a certain period of time to allow trains to pass, which prevents large boats from passing under. The Marine Trades Association opposes additional service, which would mandate more bridge closings. The 2003 agreement with Amtrak limited weekday traffic over the bridge to 2 SLE and 39 Amtrak trains until 2018, although it was revised in 2010 and 2013. 

Since 2003, New London had been served by cross-honored Amtrak trains plus one or two dedicated SLE round trips. On February 16, 2010, an additional round trip was extended to New London. Three more were extended on May 10, 2010. However, advocates for full service to New London said that then-governor Jodi Rell failed to deliver on promises to New London, with one newspaper columnist writing that &quot;she seems incapable of standing up to the marine trades lobby&quot; regarding the bridge openings.

In July 2012, then-governor Dannel Malloy announced that five weekend round trips would be extended to New London beginning in April 2013. However, the extension was dependent on ongoing negotiations with the marine industry over mandated closings of the Connecticut River bridge. Two weekday midday trips were added in May 2013, while weekend service began on June 1, 2013, after the application for additional bridge closings was approved by the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. By July, New London represented 26 percent of weekend ridership. In December 2013, the state announced that ridership was up 35 percent for the year as a result of the increased service. From 2009 to 2014, monthly New London ridership increased from less than 1,000 monthly passengers to approximately 5,000, accounting for a significant fraction of ridership increases on Shore Line East during that period.

===Second platforms===

In a 2007 report, CTDOT outlined plans to turn SLE into a full-service bidirectional regional rail line, with full-day service and all trains extended to New London. This involved incremental improvements, similar to those that have already been put into place. One of the first priorities was to add a second platform at all stations, which was mandated by the 2003 agreement with Amtrak. By that time, several stations already had multiple platforms (New London, Old Saybrook, Guilford, and the stations from New Haven Union Station west), while State Street had an island platform serving two tracks.

Branford was the first previously rebuilt station to be further renovated with a second platform. A $60 million bond in February 2011 included $16.5 million for a second platform and pedestrian bridge at Branford, $7.3 million for platform extensions at Guilford, and $11 million to electrify several sidings along the line. Construction on the new platform at Branford began in September 2013, while the Guilford work was underway by early 2014. After delays, the enlarged Branford station opened on September 30, 2016, although the north platform was not immediately served by trains. The north platform entered service on November 5, 2016. As with other stations, reverse-peak trains began stopping at Branford with the opening of the second platform.

Construction of a second platform at Clinton station was originally planned to start in early 2012, but was indefinitely delayed by 2014. Construction was again announced in October 2017. After delays due to funding issues, construction began in June 2019. The second platform opened on April 4, 2022, leaving Madison as the only single-platform station. (Bidding on a second platform and three-level parking garage at Madison, planned since 2009, was scheduled to begin in 2013 but did not occur.)

Expansion of the original parking facilities was also necessary to meet demand, since many started with small lots suitable for just a few dozen cars. The rebuilt stations at Branford, Guilford, Madison, Clinton, and Westbrook have larger lots than the 1990 stations, and a second lot with 272 spaces opened at Branford in June 2011. A 585-space, three-level parking garage is eventually planned for Madison station.

===Service cuts===
In 2018, two separate issues caused numerous delays and cancellations with many trains replaced by buses. An Amtrak track maintenance project required single-tracking of sections of the line, and CTDOT lacked sufficient functional locomotives as the aging fleet was sent out for refurbishment. Three weekday round trips were reverted from bus to train in January 2019 when one locomotive returned from refurbishment, though additional issues were expected during a second summer of track work in 2019. Full service was restored on August 5, 2019. By that time, ridership had fallen by 25 percent, averaging 1,340 weekday riders and 767 weekend riders.

On March 16, 2020, weekday service began operating on a reduced schedule due to the coronavirus pandemic. All Stamford through service was suspended. Cross-honoring of tickets on Amtrak trains was suspended that June. Weekday service was expanded from 8 to 11.5 round trips (compared to 18 pre-COVID round trips) on July 26, 2021, with all trains running to New London. Cross-honoring resumed on September 27, 2021. Electrification and track work on Track 6 at New London took place from November 2021 to April 2022. This allowed all-electric service using M8 railcars to begin on May 24, 2022. Shore Line East ridership only reached about 25% of pre-pandemic ridership by mid-2022 – compared to 40% to 72% for other rail lines in the state – which was attributed to previous riders largely being white-collar workers who shifted to remote work.

In April, 2024 a bill to restore service to pre-pandemic levels stalled in the state Senate. However, in May 2024, $5 million in American Rescue Plan Act funds were allocated for the restoration of two additional weekday round trips, as well as the restoration of Stamford through service. This increase took effect on October 7, 2024. One Stamford round trip was restored, with South Norwalk no longer a stop.

== Proposed expansion ==
===Extensions===

The possibility of extending service eastward and/or northward from New London has been considered at several points. In a 2001 report examining commuter rail for Rhode Island, the Rhode Island Department of Transportation (RIDOT) considered an extension of Shore Line East to via (effectively restoring the &quot;Clamdigger&quot; service). Ultimately, MBTA Commuter Rail service, which already ran to Providence as part of the Providence/Stoughton Line, was extended southward instead (although only to ). However, both RIDOT and SLE have long-term plans to extend their services to meet at Westerly. Extending SLE service would require negotiations with the US Coast Guard, the Marine Trades Association, and other stakeholders for increased use of the Thames River Bridge and the Mystic River Bridge. As part of Malloy&#x27;s 2015 30-year transit plan, Shore Line East was to be extended to Westerly at a cost of $200 million. In February 2016, the state public transportation commission issued a report recommending extension of Shore Line East rail service to and Westerly as soon as possible. 

In 2021, state lawmakers allocated $2.3 million for CTDOT to study an eastward extension to Westerly. Released in 2023, the study indicated that extending 12 weekday round trips to Westerly would have a capital cost of at least $245 million and additional annual operating costs of $25 million. With intermediate stops at Groton, Mystic, and Stonington, the service was estimated to attract 159,300 annual riders. The study also analyzed potential service to Norwich via the Palmer Line (New England Central Railroad mainline) with intermediate stations at Connecticut College/U.S. Coast Guard Academy and Mohegan Sun. Capital costs were estimated as at least $636 million and annual operating costs at $6.8 million, with 8-10 weekday round trips attracting 126,400 daily riders. Alternate expansion of Southeast Area Transit bus service serving both corridors was estimated to have capital costs of $9-10 million and annual operating costs of $4.1 million, with an additional 303,000 annual riders.

=== East Lyme infill station===
In April 2012, state officials released a report detailing possible sites for an infill station in East Lyme. Four sites were analyzed – two near downtown Niantic and two at Rocky Neck State Park. (Niantic station had previously been a stop on the &quot;Clamdigger&quot;.) As part of a 2015 bonding proposal made by then-governor Malloy, $750,000 was to be allocated for a new station at Niantic.

==Rolling stock==

SLE service uses four-car trains of state-owned Kawasaki M8 electric multiple units. These cars are part of a larger fleet, jointly owned by the state and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, that operate on the Metro-North Railroad New Haven Line and New Canaan Branch. The M8 cars replaced push-pull diesel-powered trains on May 24, 2022. In 2007, CTDOT proposed to use up to 32 M8 cars in SLE service as far as Old Saybrook; the diesel equipment would then be used on the Hartford Line and for use with low platforms on New London / Mystic / Westerly service. Amtrak crew qualification of M8 electric multiple units on Shore Line East took place in April 2022; testing had previously taken place as early as 2015.

SLE operated diesel service from 1990 to 2022, as Amtrak had not yet electrified the Northeast Corridor between New Haven and Boston at the time service began. Initial service used two F7 locomotives and ten Pullman-Standard coaches purchased from Pittsburgh&#x27;s PATrain for $1.7 million. In 1991, CTDOT purchased 10 Bombardier Shoreliner III coaches, similar to ones already used on the Danbury Branch and Waterbury Branch, and leased three additional diesel locomotives: two EMD GP38s and one EMD GP7. In 1994, Amtrak rebuilt 11 of CTDOT&#x27;s surplus SPV-2000 diesel railcars into coaches, dubbed &quot;Constitution Liners.&quot; 

In 1996, SLE took delivery of six remanufactured GP40-2H diesels to replace the entire motive power fleet. These were supplemented in 2005 with 8 GE P40DC Genesis diesels leased from Amtrak. CTDOT purchased the P40DCs in 2008. To augment capacity CTDOT acquired 33 Mafersa coaches from the Virginia Railway Express in 2004. These began entering service in 2006, displacing the Shoreliners and Constitution Liners.

CTDOT acquired an additional four GE P40DC locomotives from New Jersey Transit in 2015. Originally built for Amtrak in 1993, these locomotives had been used by NJ Transit on the short-lived Atlantic City Express Service. In January 2018, ConnDOT awarded a contract to Amtrak to overhaul all twelve P40DC locomotives at the Beech Grove Shops. The first unit was completed in early 2021. The GP40-2H locomotives were sent to NRE for rebuilding in 2017 and 2018, followed by use on the new Hartford Line service.

<text>Rafi (, an abbreviation of &quot;Reshimat Poalei Yisrael&quot; (), ) was a center-left political party in Israel, founded by former Prime Minister, David Ben-Gurion in 1965. In 1968 it was one of three parties that merged to form the Israeli Labor Party.

==History==
Rafi was founded on 14 July 1965 when David Ben-Gurion led a breakaway of eight MKs from Mapai, the ruling party, taking with him Moshe Dayan, Shimon Peres, Chaim Herzog, and Teddy Kollek, among others. The split had two main causes; the first was the disagreements within Mapai over the Lavon Affair; Ben-Gurion did not agree to declaring Lavon innocent without judicial investigation committee. The second was the formation of the Labor Alignment by an alliance of Mapai and Ahdut HaAvoda. The new party&#x27;s establishment, a merger of two of the largest left-wing parties, was intended to delay planned reforms to the electoral system (i.e. to change from proportional representation to a constituency-based system) that were important to Ben-Gurion.

The party ran for the 1965 elections on a platform of changing the electoral systems. Although Ben-Gurion hoped to displace the Labour Alignment as the leading left-wing party in the Knesset, Rafi won only 10 seats. In early 1967, Rafi and Menachem Begin&#x27;s Gahal party discussed the idea of forming a center-right coalition to challenge Mapai. The party was not included in Levi Eshkol&#x27;s coalition government until the formation of the government of national unity (in which Dayan replaced Eshkol as defense minister), on the day the Six-Day War started; the right wing Gahal alliance also joined the government 5 June.

On 23 January 1968 the party merged with Ahdut HaAvoda and Mapai to form the Israeli Labor Party and ceased to exist as an independent entity. However, Ben-Gurion could not reconcile himself to the merger with his foes, and broke away from the party to sit as an independent MK for the rest of the Knesset session. Prior to the 1969 elections, he founded another new party, the National List. However, after Ben-Gurion retired from politics in 1970 it fell apart, eventually merging with the Free Centre and Gahal to form Likud.

The name Rafi was briefly resurrected during the ninth Knesset and again during the tenth Knesset when breakaways from Likud named themselves Rafi – National List. The party was later renamed Ometz.

<text>Aloysio de Andrade Faria (9 November 1920 – 15 September 2020) was a Brazilian banker and billionaire. At the time of his death he was noted as being one of the world&#x27;s oldest billionaires.

==Early life==
Aloysio de Andrade Faria was born in November 1920 in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil.

==Career==
A pediatrician by training, Faria shared his medical interest with the financial business sponsored by his father. In 1949 he succeeded his father, Clemente de Faria at the direction of the Banco da Lavoura, transforming it into one of the most successful Brazilian banks, Banco Real, which in late 20th century, sold all its local and international assets to the Netherlands-based ABN AMRO Bank, but keeping other companies from the Real Group, such as Seguros Real (insurance) and Real Leasing Co. Faria, who had two daughters married, did not retire from the financial market and re-invested by incorporating a new personal and investment bank in New York, the Alfa Bank, which is one of the ten largest and most successful banks in the country.

Faria also owned one of the largest Guarana plantations in the world, the Transamerica Corporation, including a hotel and media groups. However he preferred to keep a low profile, and drove a 1960s Mercedes-Benz.

&quot;Forbes&quot; estimated his net worth to be US$1.7 billion in March 2020.

==Death==
Faria died on September 15, 2020, at the age of 99.

<text>William Kemper Harreld (January 31, 1885, Muncie, Indiana – 1971) was an American concert violinist. He was also a pianist and organist.

A graduate of Chicago Musical College, Harreld performed until 1911 when he became head of the music department at Atlanta Baptist College (now Morehouse College). He intended to teach music at Morehouse for only one term, but served for 42 years as professor and chair of the music department. Harreld officially established the Morehouse College Glee Club in 1911, and served as the organization&#x27;s first director. He also founded the Spelman College Glee Club in 1925 and served as its first director. For a time, he served simultaneously as the chair of the music department of Spelman College as well as Morehouse. His students included Edmund Jenkins and Wendell P. Whalum. When Harreld retired in 1953, Whalum succeeded him as director of the Morehouse College Glee Club, and Joyce Johnson succeeded him as Spelman College organist.

Harreld died in the beginning of 1971 and his funeral was held on February 27. The glee club that he had established, and which achieved international acclaim, performed at his funeral.

Harreld&#x27;s music was recorded and distributed by the Pace Phonograph Company&#x27;s Black Swan Records label.

== Personal life ==
Kemper Harreld married poet Claudia Turner White, the daughter of William J. White (journalist). Harreld taught his daughter, Josephine Harreld Love, to play violin and piano. Love became a concert pianist, arts administrator, and musicologist.

<doc id="1327757" wikidata="Q966788" url="?curid=1327757" title="Jonathan Agnew">
<text>Jonathan Philip Agnew, (born 4 April 1960) is an English cricket broadcaster and a former cricketer. He was born in Macclesfield, Cheshire, and educated at Uppingham School. He is nicknamed &quot;Aggers&quot; and, less commonly, &quot;Spiro&quot; – the latter, according to &quot;Debrett&#x27;s Cricketers&#x27; Who&#x27;s Who&quot;, after former US Vice-President Spiro Agnew.

Agnew had a first-class career as a fast bowler for Leicestershire from 1979 to 1990, returning briefly in 1992. In first-class cricket he took 666 wickets at an average of 29.25. Agnew won three Test caps for England, as well as playing three One Day Internationals in the mid-1980s, although his entire international career lasted just under a year. In county cricket, Agnew&#x27;s most successful seasons came toward the end of his career when he had learned to swing the ball. He was second- and third-leading wicket-taker in 1987 and 1988 respectively, including the achievement of 100 wickets in a season in 1987. He was named as one of the five Cricketers of the Year by &quot;Wisden Cricketers&#x27; Almanack&quot; in 1988.

While still a player, Agnew began a career in cricket journalism and commentary. Since his retirement as a player, he has become a leading voice of cricket on radio, as the BBC Radio cricket correspondent and as a commentator on &quot;Test Match Special&quot;. He has also contributed as a member of Australian broadcaster Australian Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s &quot;Grandstand&quot; team.

Agnew&#x27;s on-air &quot;leg over&quot; comment on &quot;Test Match Special&quot;, made to fellow commentator Brian Johnston in 1991, provoked giggling fits during a live broadcast and widespread reaction. The incident has been voted &quot;the greatest sporting commentary ever&quot; in a BBC poll.

Agnew has been called &quot;a master broadcaster ... the pick of the sports correspondents at the BBC.&quot;

==Playing career==

===Background and early years===
Agnew was born on 4 April 1960 at West Park Hospital in Macclesfield, Cheshire, to Margaret (&quot;née&quot; McConnell) and Philip Agnew. His parents&#x27; forthcoming marriage was announced in &quot;The Times&quot; in 1957: Philip Agnew was described as &quot;the only son of Mr and Mrs Norris M. Agnew of Dukenfield Hall, Mobberley, Cheshire&quot; and Margaret as &quot;youngest daughter of Mr and Mrs A.F.V. McConnell of Hampton Hall, Worthen, Shropshire&quot;. The Agnews had a second son in June 1962 and were recorded as living at &quot;Bainton near Stamford, Lincs&quot;; in April 1966, a daughter, Felicity, was born and was announced as &quot;a sister for Jonathan and Christopher&quot;. Agnew&#x27;s paternal grandmother, Lady Mona Agnew, died aged 110 years and 170 days in 2010 and was on the list of the 100 longest-lived British people ever.

Jonathan Agnew recalls growing up on the family farm and first becoming aware of cricket aged &quot;eight or nine&quot;; his father would carry a radio around and listen to &quot;Test Match Special&quot;:

&quot;The programme sparked an interest in me, in the same way it has in so many tens of thousands of children down the years, igniting a passion that lasts a lifetime.&quot;

Driven by early enjoyment of the media coverage of cricket, Agnew developed a love for playing the game. At the end of days spent watching cricket on television in a blacked-out room with the commentary provided by the radio, Agnew would go into the garden and practise his bowling for hours, trying to imitate the players he had seen. Agnew&#x27;s father, an amateur cricketer, taught him the rudiments of the sport, including an offspin action, as he wanted his son to develop into a bowler like him. Another family connection to cricket was his first cousin, Mary Duggan, who was a women&#x27;s Test player for England from 1948 to 1963.

From the age of eight, Agnew boarded at Taverham Hall School near Norwich. His first cricket coach was Eileen Ryder and, according to Agnew, after &quot;a couple of years&quot; a professional arrived at the school: Ken Taylor, a former batsman for Yorkshire who had played three Tests for England in the late 1950s and early 1960s.

Agnew attended Uppingham School for his secondary education, and left in 1978 with nine O-levels and two A-levels in German and English. From the age of 16 he developed his skills as a right-arm fast bowler out of school hours at Alf Gover&#x27;s cricket school whilst at Surrey County Cricket Club. That summer, he saw fast bowler Michael Holding take 14 wickets in the 1976 Oval Test match, a performance of pace bowling referred to as &quot;devastating&quot; by cricket writer Norman Preston, which made a lasting impression on Agnew. More than 30 years later he wrote of his bowling during his schooldays:

&quot;For an eighteen-year-old bowler I was unusually fast, and enjoyed terrorising our opponents, be they schoolboys (8 wickets for 2 runs and 7 for 11 stick in the memory) or, better still, the teachers in the annual staff match. This, I gather, used to be a friendly affair until I turned up, and I relished the chance to settle a few scores on behalf of my friends – for whom I was the equivalent of a hired assassin – as well as for myself.&quot;

Having played for Surrey under-19s the previous year, he began playing for Surrey&#x27;s second XI in 1977, but Surrey made no move to sign him as a player. At a home match against Hampshire, the teenage Agnew was the only player to stand up to then Surrey coach and former England player Fred Titmus after the latter racially abused the Guyanese-born Surrey player Lonsdale Skinner, an incident of which Agnew later said: &quot;The consequences hadn’t really dawned on me. But clearly it was a career-ender&quot;. Leicestershire County Cricket Club did, however, take note of Agnew&#x27;s impressive performances in local club cricket and for Uppingham School, for whom he took 37 wickets at a bowling average of 8 in 1977, and signed him while he was still a schoolboy in time for the 1978 season.

===County cricket===
On his first-class debut against Lancashire in August 1978, the 18-year-old Agnew bowled to England international David Lloyd, an opening batsman with nine Test caps. Reported in &quot;Wisden Cricketers&#x27; Almanack&quot;, Lloyd &quot;was halfway through a forward defensive push when his off stump was despatched halfway towards the Leicestershire wicket-keeper.&quot; Agnew took one wicket in each innings of the match, and did not bat; Leicestershire won by an innings.

Agnew won a Whitbread Brewery award at the end of his debut season, an achievement he ascribes to the influence of his county captain, Ray Illingworth: he had taken only six first-class wickets at an average of 35. Illingworth was quoted in &quot;The Times&quot; as saying that Agnew was &quot;the second fastest bowler&quot; in England in 1978, behind only Bob Willis. The award afforded him the opportunity to spend a winter in Australia developing his skills, alongside fellow winners Mike Gatting, Wayne Larkins and Chris Tavaré, and to be coached by former England fast bowler, Frank Tyson. All four went on to play Test cricket. On that Australia tour, Agnew played his only youth Test, but made headlines when invited to bowl at the touring England team in the nets:
&quot;He struck the captain, Mike Brearley, a nasty blow in the face. It was, Agnew recalls, merely a gentle delivery off two paces that flew off a wet patch; but it did not deter the headline writers. Such early publicity did him no favours, but when a bowler arrives who is young, fast and English, a quiet settling-in period to one of the more difficult apprenticeships in sport is often denied him.&quot; – &quot;Wisden&quot;

Agnew&#x27;s 1979 season was disrupted by injury. The Editor&#x27;s Notes of the 1980 &quot;Wisden Cricketers&#x27; Almanack&quot; reported, under the heading &quot;England&#x27;s Promising Youngsters&quot;, that Agnew had strengthened himself over the winter by felling trees. Agnew&#x27;s own account is that 1979–80 was &quot;the worst winter of his life&quot;, although his recollection is that he spent it working as a lorry driver. He did, however, make his List A limited overs debut in 1979, playing just once, against the Sri Lanka touring team – his competitive List A debut followed in 1980, in the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup against Scotland: he bowled just three overs (for five runs) and did not bat.

===Test cricket===

Agnew&#x27;s career did not initially live up to his early promise. In his first six seasons as a first-class cricketer, his largest haul of wickets was 31 in 1980. The 1984 season was his breakthrough year: he played 23 first-class matches, taking 84 wickets at an average of 28.72. Playing in the warm-up game against Cambridge University, he achieved figures of 8–47 (taking 8 wickets while conceding 47 runs) from 20.4 overs and was included in the first team for the County Championship matches that followed.

He carried that success forward into the County Championship, picking up wickets for Leicestershire including a ten wicket match haul against Surrey in June, and five wickets in an innings against Kent in the days leading up to the fifth Test against West Indies. The England selectors took note and, with the West Indies leading the series 4–0, Agnew and Richard Ellison were given debuts, in an ultimately unsuccessful effort to avoid the &quot;blackwash&quot;.

&quot;Wisden&quot; describes how in the first innings, Agnew&#x27;s accuracy was affected by debutant nerves, but an improved display in the second innings resulted in figures of 2–51. Agnew describes how Ian Botham helped him secure both wickets, catching Gordon Greenidge in the slips, and passing on some advice on how to dismiss Viv Richards, Botham&#x27;s great friend: &quot;Botham said: &#x27;Right. Don&#x27;t pitch a single ball up at him. Have two men back for the hook, and bowl short every ball.&#x27; This I did for three overs or so, by which time Viv was looking a little exasperated, but was definitely on the back foot. Finally I pitched one up, the great man missed it and umpire David Constant ruled that Richards was LBW for 15.&quot; &quot;Wisden&quot; called the pair of batsmen Agnew&#x27;s &quot;first illustrious victims in Test cricket&quot;.

England&#x27;s next match was a one-off home Test against Sri Lanka and Agnew retained his place in the England team. At the time, Sri Lanka were regarded as the minnows of world cricket: this was only their 12th Test match and their first at Lord&#x27;s, but they dominated the match, taking a 121-run lead on first innings and declaring twice. It was a disappointment for England and, in a batsman-friendly match in which the Sri Lankans racked up 785 runs for just 14 wickets, Agnew suffered. &quot;Wisden&quot; described England&#x27;s pacemen as ineffective; Agnew&#x27;s match figures were 2–177 off 43 overs. Poor performance and a muscle injury limited him to bowling a single over on the last day; later, Agnew reflected on other negative aspects of this match: &quot;I felt a complete outsider, not part of the set-up. I think the feeling in the dressing room was that the game had been a bit of a cock-up.&quot;

England toured India and Sri Lanka that winter. Agnew replaced the injured Paul Allott after the second Test. However, he failed to be selected for a Test match, with England&#x27;s decision to field two spinners (Pat Pocock and Phil Edmonds) in each Test playing a part in limiting Agnew&#x27;s opportunities. Agnew played just one first-class match on the tour, versus South Zone in Secunderabad, achieving match figures of seven wickets at an average of 29, but he did play in three One Day Internationals (ODIs), two in India and one in Australia. His debut ODI was promising, as he took 3–38 in a losing cause. However, in his remaining two ODIs, he proved very expensive, taking no further wickets and conceding more than seven runs an over in each.

Agnew began the 1985 season vying with the established England fast bowlers to get back into the Test side. Over the winter, the side had been settled, with Norman Cowans and Chris Cowdrey playing all five Tests. Neil Foster and Richard Ellison shared the third spot alongside the spinners, playing two and three Tests respectively. Cowdrey and Ellison had struggled with the ball, both averaging more than 70. However, the side was extensively remodelled for the first Test of that summer&#x27;s Ashes series. Of the bowlers who had played the last Test in India, only Cowans had survived the cull and it set the tone for the series. England won the first Test, yet dropped Cowans and Peter Willey, replacing them with Phil Edmonds and Foster. After losing the second Test, and struggling with the ball in the third Test, when Australia made 539 all out in their only innings, England decided to make further changes.

Agnew had performed consistently in county cricket through June and July, culminating in what was to be, statistically, his finest moment as a bowler. Playing against Kent, he took 9–70 in the first innings. His timing was perfect and he was called up for the Fourth Test at Old Trafford to partner Ian Botham and Paul Allott in an all-Cheshire born seam attack. The match finished as a draw, and Agnew failed to take a wicket. He was relegated from an opening bowler in the first innings, to fifth bowler in the second, in which he only bowled nine overs. He was subsequently dropped again from the side, only for Richard Ellison to cement his place with match-winning performances that helped claim the Ashes for England.

===Later playing career and retirement===
In the 1987 season, Agnew achieved the feat of 100 first-class wickets in an English cricket season when he took 101 wickets for his county. He was the first Leicestershire player to achieve this milestone since Jack Birkenshaw in 1968, which was the season before the county programme was greatly reduced, making the feat much less common. By this stage, he was working on local radio during the winters and he found the reassurance of the additional income and career path a major factor in his improved form. &quot;Wisden&quot; preferred to attribute his success to &quot;bowling off a shorter run and ... a wicked slower ball added to his armoury&quot;. The achievement led to him being selected as one of the five &quot;Wisden&quot; Cricketers of the Year.

Agnew&#x27;s form remained good: he followed his 1987 feat of taking the second-most wickets in the County Championship by taking the third-most in 1988. In 1989, with two years of good form behind him and England losing 4–0 in the 1989 Ashes series, Agnew &quot;came frustratingly close to the recall to the England team that I had set my heart on.&quot;

County captain and friend of Agnew, David Gower was England captain, and a number of fast bowlers from around the country called the telephone in the Leicestershire dressing room, to tell Gower that they were injured and unavailable for the Sixth Test. According to Agnew&#x27;s account, Gower was at a loss as to whom to call into the squad.

Agnew recalls that county colleague Peter Willey made a suggestion:

&quot;&#x27;What about Agnew?&#x27; suggested Peter Willey ... &#x27;He&#x27;s bowling pretty well at the moment.&#x27; David&#x27;s face lit up. &#x27;Of course!&#x27; he said. &#x27;Jonathan, you&#x27;re in. Go home, get your England stuff ready, and I&#x27;ll call first thing tomorrow ...&#x27; Even though I was approximately the seventeenth choice, this was still fantastic news ... After three disappointing Test appearances, this was my second chance, and the opportunity to set the record straight ... [The following day] the telephone finally rang. &#x27;Got some bad news, I&#x27;m afraid,&#x27; David began. &#x27;I couldn&#x27;t persuade Ted Dexter or Mickey Stewart, so you&#x27;re not in any more. They&#x27;ve gone for Alan Igglesden. Know anything about him?&#x27; With that, David must have known his influence as England captain was over – and indeed Graham Gooch succeeded him after that Test. I felt utterly devastated, and knew I would never play for England again, which had been my main motivating force. So when the &quot;Today&quot; newspaper offered me the post of cricket correspondent the following summer, it was an easy decision to make. I might have been only thirty, which was no age to retire from professional cricket, and I could easily have played for another five years. But it was definitely time to move on.&quot;

Agnew formally retired from playing professional cricket at the end of the following season: Leicestershire&#x27;s last match of the 1990 Championship season was his last first-class game. Aged 30, Agnew took 1–42 in Derbyshire&#x27;s only innings and scored 6 in his only turn to bat. In 1992, two years after retirement, Leicestershire experienced an injury crisis before their NatWest Trophy semi-final against Essex. Agnew answered a request to assist and played, finishing the match with figures of 12–2–31–1 (bowling twelve overs, including two maiden overs, and taking one wicket for 31 runs). Leicestershire won the match and progressed to the final, but Agnew chose not to play.

===Playing style and career summary===
Agnew&#x27;s best first-class bowling figures were 9 for 70 and he took six ten-wicket hauls in 218 matches. In the 1988 Cricketer of the Year editorial on Agnew, &quot;Wisden&quot; noted that &quot;his pace comes from a whippy wrist action and co-ordination ... In the field, Agnew has at times appeared to be moving with his bootlaces tied together, but his long run-up was one of the more graceful in the game. However, it was the shortening of that run-up, and a cutting-down of pace, which led to ... achievements [late in his career]&quot;

As a batsman, Agnew had some highs, but it was his weaker suit. His highest first-class batting score was 90, starting initially as nightwatchman in 1987 against Yorkshire, at North Marine Road Ground, Scarborough. &quot;Wisden&quot; commented, &quot;Agnew hit a spectacular, career-best 90 from 68 balls, including six sixes and eight fours, and then took the first five Yorkshire wickets to fall&quot;. &quot;Wisden&quot; commented that Agnew was no all-rounder, but he could &quot;certainly bat ... on his day he can destroy anything pitched up around off stump.&quot; The same piece noted his usual playing style, &quot;playing hard but always with a sense of fun&quot;.

Agnew reflects on his playing career as having had two periods:
&quot;My career could be divided up into two sections: the first being when I was an out-and-out fast bowler and played for England when I probably should not have done; and the second being when I slowed down a bit, learned how to swing the ball and did not play for England when I probably should have done. His final Test was only twelve months after his England debut, and his first and last ODIs were played less than a month apart. Cricket commentator Colin Bateman opined, &quot;his fleeting taste of Test cricket should have been added to in 1987 and 1988 when he was the most consistent fast bowler in the country, taking 194 wickets, but in 1989, when England were desperate for pace bowlers, his omission amounted to wanton neglect by a regime which questioned his desire&quot;. In 1988, when Agnew was selected as a &quot;Cricketer of the Year&quot;, &quot;Wisden&quot; recorded this verdict on the contrariness of Agnew&#x27;s Test career: &quot;Asked about Agnew&#x27;s omission, the chairman of selectors, P. B. H. May, expressed concern about his fitness – rather a baffling statement to make about someone who bowled more overs than any other fast bowler in the Championship.&quot;

== Media and broadcasting career ==

Agnew began gaining experience as a journalist in 1987, while still playing cricket, when at the invitation of John Rawling he took off-season employment with BBC Radio Leicester as a sports producer. It was during this period that he &quot;fell in love with radio&quot;, and following his retirement, he had a short stint as chief cricket writer of &quot;Today&quot; newspaper. While covering the 1990–91 Ashes series for &quot;Today&quot;, he was approached by Peter Baxter about joining &quot;Test Match Special&quot;. Unhappy at certain editorial decisions that had been taken during his time with the newspaper, Agnew agreed to attend an interview after the tour.

Agnew joined Test Match Special in 1991, in time for the first Test match of the summer. He was initially a junior member of the &quot;Test Match Special&quot; team, learning at close quarters from figures such as Brian Johnston, Henry Blofeld and Bill Frindall. The same year, he was also appointed the BBC&#x27;s cricket correspondent, taking over from &quot;Test Match Special&quot; colleague, Christopher Martin-Jenkins. In 2007, when asked which sports journalist he most respected, Martin-Jenkins named Agnew, because he &quot;combines astute journalism with apparently effortless communication skills.&quot; He has also commentated for the Australian ABC Radio network during Ashes series in Australia.

When Channel 4 won the broadcasting rights to television coverage of England&#x27;s home Test matches in 1998, Agnew was approached by the broadcaster and offered a job on the commentary team. Agnew declined the opportunity, opting to remain BBC cricket correspondent, in part because he was a &quot;radio man&quot; and in part out of loyalty. The following year, England hosted the 1999 Cricket World Cup. The BBC had the UK television rights, but with so many specialist TV cricket presenters now at Channel 4 and therefore unavailable to the BBC, Agnew was asked to present the coverage. His recollections of the experience are that it was something of a trial, helped only by the experienced Richie Benaud alongside him:

In addition to his writing and broadcasting work, Agnew&#x27;s commentary has been recorded for several computer games, including the International Cricket Captain and Brian Lara Cricket series. He is a shareholder in TestMatchExtra.com Ltd, a company which runs the website of the same address and acquired &quot;The Wisden Cricketer&quot; magazine from BSkyB in December 2010.

From 2001 to 2005, Agnew provided the voice of Flynn, the oval-shaped screen, on children&#x27;s gameshow &quot;50/50&quot;.

Agnew has won many awards for his broadcasting, including two Sony Awards for Best Reporter (1992 and 1994), and Best Radio Broadcaster of the Year (2010), an award from the Association of Sports Journalists. Agnew was made an Honorary Doctor of Arts by De Montfort University, Leicester in November 2008, and an Honorary Doctor of Letters by Loughborough University in July 2011.

His peers in sports journalism have frequently commented on Agnew&#x27;s skills as a broadcaster and writer. Michael Henderson, in the aftermath of the Stanford cricket controversy, wrote of Agnew as a &quot;master broadcaster ... the pick of the sports correspondents at the BBC ... Agnew&#x27;s is a sane, reasonable voice in a game that is going potty. Fair-minded, even-tempered, he has become one of the finest specialists the BBC has ever had. In his understated way he speaks for the game: not the people who play it.&quot;

In 2016 Agnew was a member of the BBC commentary team at the 2016 Summer Olympics, covering equestrian events. He earns £185,000 – £189,999 as BBC cricket correspondent.

Agnew was appointed as a Deputy Lieutenant of Leicestershire in October 2015, and as a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2017 New Year Honours for services to broadcasting.

On 26 October 2024, following the conclusion of England&#x27;s unsuccessful three-test match tour of Pakistan, Agnew confirmed in an article on the &quot;BBC Sport&quot; website that this England cricket tour would be his last as the BBC&#x27;s chief cricket correspondent, a role he had held for 33 years. Agnew did however clarify he would continue to serve as presenter and commentator on the &quot;Test Match Special&quot; radio programme.

===Notable broadcasting incidents===

In 2001, Agnew was part of the BBC team that was sent to Sri Lanka to cover England&#x27;s Test match series. As a result of confusion and a row over broadcasting rights, the BBC team found itself barred from the Galle International Stadium, where the first Test was to take place. Agnew and Pat Murphy refused to be defeated and &quot;decamped to the fort ramparts overlooking the ground and broadcast their programme from there. With both team and equipment protected from the sun by an umbrella held by Mr Agnew&#x27;s driver, Simmons, it made a colourful scene.&quot; The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) chief executive, Tim Lamb became involved in discussions and the &quot;Test Match Special&quot; team were allowed to return to the ground.

&quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; called Agnew and Murphy&#x27;s effort, &quot;new heights of ingenuity&quot;. Agnew&#x27;s reaction to the event was, &quot;It&#x27;s a sad day for everyone involved in English cricket. Is it really that cricket is getting so greedy that everyone who wants to come and report on the game for the good of the game is going to have to be charged for it?&quot; However, he remained upbeat about the situation: &quot;Actually I get rather more of a panoramic view of it from up here than I did yesterday in my commentary box. There&#x27;s a little road that runs round the back of the ground. All manner of people are trundling up and down – buses, bikes and little three wheeled tuk-tuks – it&#x27;s rather fun.&quot;

In 2004, the Zimbabwe government banned media from following the England cricket team tour of the country. Agnew&#x27;s reaction was combative, appearing on BBC Breakfast and giving his opinion that the ban presented the ECB with a chance to withdraw from the controversial tour and that they should take the opportunity.

In the summer of 2008, then England captain Michael Vaughan reacted testily on-air to questions by Agnew about his batting form. When Vaughan resigned shortly thereafter, Mike Atherton, writing in &quot;The Times&quot;, commented that it had been an out-of-character outburst that was a portent of the resignation. When Atherton had himself been England captain, Agnew had led the calls for Atherton to resign over a controversy known as the &quot;dirt in the pocket&quot; affair. Fellow BBC commentator Jack Bannister felt that Agnew&#x27;s comments were inappropriate, but only to the extent that he had referred to his friendship with Atherton: Bannister advised Agnew that he should continue to be honest and forthright as a reporter.

Agnew was involved in a minor controversy regarding an appearance by Lily Allen on &quot;Test Match Special&quot; in 2009. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that &quot;the cricket-loving Allen struck up an instant rapport with Agnew, and the BBC received largely positive feedback for the 30-minute interview&quot;, but Will Buckley, writing for &quot;The Observer&quot;, described Agnew&#x27;s &quot;amorous ambitions&quot; as &quot;positioned ... firmly on the pervy side of things&quot;. Agnew was furious, noting he &quot;gave ... Will Buckley 24 hrs to apologise for calling me a pervert, and he has declined ... As you can imagine, I have taken being called a pervert quite badly.&quot; Allen herself supported Agnew: &quot;[I] really think this Will Buckley guy should apologise to ... [Agnew], he was nothing but kind and gentlemanly to me during our interview. I don&#x27;t know 1 person that agrees with The Observer on this one.&quot; Buckley eventually apologised.

=== &quot;Leg over&quot; incident ===
Agnew has been known to laugh at or include occasional sexual innuendo while on air. One example took place in August 1991, when Agnew was commentating with Brian Johnston. In a review of the day, Johnston was describing how Ian Botham, while batting, had overbalanced and tried, but failed, to step over his stumps. Botham was consequently given out hit wicket. Agnew&#x27;s comment on this action was: &quot;He just didn&#x27;t quite get his leg over.&quot; Botham had attracted a number of headlines during his career for his sexual exploits and in British English, &quot;&quot; is a euphemism for having sexual intercourse.

The comment led to Johnston becoming incapacitated by laughter. He initially tried to continue his summary, before becoming unable to speak for laughing, at one point saying &quot;Aggers, for goodness&#x27; sake, stop it&quot; as he struggled to regain his composure.

The incident was heard by thousands of commuters driving home from work, many of whom were forced to stop driving because they were laughing so much: a two-mile traffic jam at the entrance to the Dartford Tunnel was reportedly caused by drivers unable to pay the toll due to laughter. Fourteen years later, in 2005, Agnew&#x27;s line, &quot;Just didn&#x27;t quite get his leg over&quot; was voted &quot;the greatest sporting commentary of all time&quot; by listeners to BBC Radio 5 Live. The other eight finalists included Kenneth Wolstenholme&#x27;s &quot;They think it&#x27;s all over – it is now!&quot; and Ian Robertson&#x27;s &quot;This is the one. He drops for World Cup glory ... It&#x27;s up! It&#x27;s over! He&#x27;s done it! Jonny Wilkinson is England&#x27;s hero yet again&quot;. Agnew and Johnston secured 78% of the votes.

==Private life==
Agnew&#x27;s first marriage was to Beverley in 1983; it ended in divorce in 1992, a year after he became BBC cricket correspondent. He has written about the role that cricket played in the collapse of the relationship, comparing his circumstances with those of then England batsman Graham Thorpe. He also found that his job interfered with his relationship with his children: I had two young children, aged seven and five ... it was quickly evident that for me to have custody of my daughters – or even to form a relationship with them – was made impossible by my job. What chance do you have when, be it playing Test cricket or commentating on it, you are away for months at a time each and every winter? ... There was one occasion when I did not recognise my eldest, Jennifer, when I returned from one tour ... my children continue to ask me why I did not resign and take a job that would have kept me in the country and allowed me to see them more often. I find that one especially hard to answer.&quot; Agnew has subsequently remarried: he met Emma Agnew, current editor of BBC East Midlands Today, when they worked together on BBC Radio Leicestershire.

In 2013 Agnew told &quot;BBC Desert Island Discs&quot; he struggled to maintain contact with his daughters after his divorce from their mother saying he wanted to &quot;stand up&quot; for absent fathers in broken families. Agnew&#x27;s first wife and two daughters responded to this claiming Agnew had made little effort to stay in contact with his daughters.

Agnew suffers from Dupuytren&#x27;s contracture, a medical condition that affects the connective tissue in his hands. He has had numerous operations to address the progressive condition, which causes the hands to contract into a claw-like position.

===Personality===
During Agnew&#x27;s playing career, a dispute with team-mate Phillip DeFreitas attracted media attention: when DeFreitas poured salt over Agnew&#x27;s lunch, Agnew responded by throwing DeFreitas&#x27; cricket bag and kit from the dressing room balcony. Former England cricketer Derek Pringle has written about Agnew&#x27;s sense of humour, describing him as &quot;hysterical&quot;. The pair toured Sri Lanka together on England B&#x27;s 1986 tour. Pringle recalls that one hot day when England were in the field, Agnew came in for lunch: &quot;It&#x27;s fucking red hot on the field, and when you come off it&#x27;s fucking red hot in the dressing room,&quot; Agnew screamed. &quot;Then, what do you get for lunch, fucking red hot curry?&quot;

===Assisted suicide allegation===
It was reported in various newspapers in 2013 that Agnew had offered to accompany Brian Dodds, his second wife&#x27;s ex-husband, to the Dignitas assisted suicide clinic in Zürich after Dodds was diagnosed with motor neurone disease. Dodds died in England from the disease in 2005.

=== BBC reprimand ===
In 2019, journalist Jonathan Liew wrote an article in which he expressed concern about some of the language used in the media to describe Jofra Archer’s selection for England. Liew wrote “Who doesn’t love morale and camaraderie, after all? – Until you begin to question why Archer is deemed such a grave threat to it.” Agnew called Liew a &quot;“sad racist troll after clickbait” on Twitter, adding “Fucking disgrace. You have massive chips on your shoulders… you are a racist.” Agnew then went on to describe Liew as &quot;strange&quot; and &quot;a cunt&quot; followed by questioning “who the fuck are you”. Agnew was reprimanded by the BBC; he also deleted his Twitter account. Writing about the incident, journalist Barney Ronay stated, &quot;Agnew has done something similar but far less serious and bullying with me. Those who know him say Agnew is a very nice man, that he can just be thin-skinned. This is probably right.&quot;

In October 2022 a conversation between Agnew and Liew was published by &quot;The Observer&quot; where the two men discussed the incident. Agnew told Liew that &quot;to associate a white middle-aged person with racism is a massive hit. And that’s what really upset me, because I know I’m not.&quot; Agnew claimed that when he was a teenage player in the 1970s he objected when Fred Titmus used racist language against Lonsdale Skinner.

The closely related field of housing economics is narrower in scope, concentrating on residential real estate markets, while the research on real estate trends focuses on the business and structural changes affecting the industry. Both draw on partial equilibrium analysis (supply and demand), urban economics, spatial economics, basic and extensive research, surveys, and finance.

==Overview of real estate markets==
The main participants in real estate markets are:

* Users: These people are both owners and tenants. They purchase houses or commercial property as an investment and also to live in or utilize as a business. Businesses may or may not require buildings to use land. The land can be used in other ways, such as for agriculture, forestry or mining.
* Owners: These people are pure investors. They do not occupy the real estate that they purchase. Typically, they rent out or lease the property to other parties.
* Renters: They are pure consumers.
* Developers: These people are involved in developing land for buildings for sale in the market.
* Renovators: They supply refurbished properties to the market.
* Facilitators: This group includes banks, real estate brokers, lawyers, government regulators, and others that facilitate the purchase and sale of real estate.
The choices of users, owners, and renters form the demand side of the market, while the choices of owners, developers and renovators form the supply side. In order to apply simple supply and demand analysis to real estate markets, a number of modifications need to be made to standard microeconomic assumptions and procedures. In particular, the unique characteristics of the real estate market must be accommodated. These characteristics include:
* Durability. Real estate is durable. A building can last for decades or even centuries, and the land underneath it is practically indestructible. As a result, real estate markets are modelled as a &quot;stock/flow market&quot;. Although the proportion is highly variable over time, the vast majority of the building supply consists of the stock of existing buildings, while a small proportion consists of the flow of new development. The stock of real estate supply in any period is determined by the existing stock in the previous period, the rate of deterioration of the existing stock, the rate of renovation of the existing stock, and the flow of new development in the current period. The effect of real estate market adjustments tend to be mitigated by the relatively large stock of existing buildings.
* Heterogeneity. Every unit of real estate is unique in terms of its location, the building, and its financing. This makes pricing difficult, increases search costs, creates information asymmetry, and greatly restricts substitutability. To get around this problem, economists, beginning with Muth (1960), define supply in terms of service units; that is, any physical unit can be deconstructed into the services that it provides. Olsen (1969) describes these units of housing services as an &quot;unobservable theoretical construct&quot;. Housing stock depreciates, making it qualitatively different from new buildings. The market-equilibrating process operates across multiple quality levels. Further, the real estate market is typically divided into residential, commercial, and industrial segments. It can also be further divided into subcategories like recreational, income-generating, historical or protected, and the like.
* High transaction costs. Buying and/or moving into a home costs much more than most types of transactions. The costs include search costs, real estate fees, moving costs, legal fees, land transfer taxes, and deed registration fees. Transaction costs for the seller typically range between 1.5% and 6% of the purchase price. In some countries in continental Europe, transaction costs for both buyer and seller can range between 15% and 20%.
* Long time delays. The market adjustment process is subject to time delays due to the length of time it takes to finance, design, and construct new supply and also due to the relatively slow rate of change of demand. Because of these lags, there is great potential for disequilibrium in the short run. Adjustment mechanisms tend to be slow relative to more fluid markets.
* Both an investment good and a consumption good. Real estate can be purchased with the expectation of attaining a return (an investment good), with the intention of using it (a consumption good), or both. These functions may be separated (with market participants concentrating on one or the other function) or combined (in the case of the person that lives in a house that they own). This dual nature of the good means that it is not uncommon for people to over-invest in real estate, that is, to invest more money in an asset than it is worth on the open market.
*Immobility. Real estate is locationally immobile (save for mobile homes, but the land underneath them is still immobile). Consumers come to the good rather than the good going to the consumer. Because of this, there can be no physical marketplace. This spatial fixity means that market adjustment must occur by people moving to dwelling units, rather than the movement of the goods. For example, if tastes change and more people demand suburban houses, people must find housing in the suburbs, because it is impossible to bring their existing house and lot to the suburb (even a mobile homeowner, who could move the house, must still find a new lot). Spatial fixity combined with the close proximity of housing units in urban areas suggest the potential for externalities inherent in a given location.

==Housing industry==

The housing industry is the development, construction, and sale of homes. Its interests are represented in the United States by the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB). In Australia the trade association representing the residential housing industry is the Housing Industry Association. It also refers to the housing market which means the supply and demand for houses, usually in a particular country or region. Housing market includes features as supply of housing, demand for housing, house prices, rented sector and government intervention in the Housing market.

==Demand for housing==
The main determinants of the demand for housing are demographic. But other factors, like income, price of housing, cost and availability of credit, consumer preferences, investor preferences, price of substitutes, and price of complements, all play a role.

The core demographic variables are population size and population growth: the more people in the economy, the greater the demand for housing. But this is an oversimplification. It is necessary to consider family size, the age composition of the family, the number of first and second children, net migration (immigration minus emigration), non-family household formation, the number of double-family households, death rates, divorce rates, and marriages. In housing economics, the elemental unit of analysis is not the individual, as it is in standard partial equilibrium models. Rather, it is households, which demand housing services: typically one household per house. The size and demographic composition of households is variable and not entirely exogenous. It is endogenous to the housing market in the sense that as the price of housing services increase, household size will tend also to increase.

Income is also an important determinant. Empirical measures of the income elasticity of demand in North America range from 0.5 to 0.9 (De Leeuw 1971). If permanent income elasticity is measured, the results are slightly higher (Kain and Quigley 1975) because transitory income varies from year to year and across individuals, so positive transitory income will tend to cancel out negative transitory income. Many housing economists use permanent income rather than annual income because of the high cost of purchasing real estate. For many people, real estate will be the costliest item they will ever buy.

The price of housing is also an important factor. The price elasticity of the demand for housing services in North America is estimated as negative 0.7 by Polinsky and Ellwood (1979), and as negative 0.9 by Maisel, Burnham, and Austin (1971).

An individual household&#x27;s housing demand can be modelled with standard utility/choice theory. A utility function, such as formula_1, can be constructed, in which the household&#x27;s utility is a function of various goods and services (formula_2). This will be subject to a budget constraint such as formula_3, where formula_4 is the household&#x27;s available income and the formula_5 are the prices for the various goods and services. The equality indicates that the money spent on all the goods and services must be equal to the available income. Because this is unrealistic, the model must be adjusted to allow for borrowing and saving. A measure of wealth, lifetime income, or permanent income is required. The model must also be adjusted to account for the heterogeneity of real estate. This can be done by deconstructing the utility function. If housing services (formula_6) are separated into its constituent components (formula_7), the utility function can be rewritten as formula_8. By varying the price of housing services (formula_6) and solving for points of optimal utility, the household&#x27;s demand schedule for housing services can be constructed. Market demand is calculated by summing all individual household demands.

==Supply of housing==

Developers produce housing supply using land, labour, and various inputs, such as electricity and building materials. The quantity of new supply is determined by the cost of these inputs, the price of the existing stock of houses, and the technology of production. For a typical single-family dwelling in suburban North America, one can assign approximate cost percentages as follows: acquisition costs, 10%; site improvement costs, 11%; labour costs, 26%; materials costs, 31%; finance costs, 3%; administrative costs, 15%; and marketing costs, 4%. Multi-unit residential dwellings typically break down as follows: acquisition costs, 7%; site improvement costs, 8%; labour costs, 27%; materials costs, 33%; finance costs, 3%; administrative costs, 17%; and marketing costs, 5%. Public-subdivision requirements can increase development costs by up to 3%, depending on the jurisdiction. Differences in building codes account for about a 2% variation in development costs. However, these subdivision and building-code costs typically increase the market value of the buildings by at least the amount of their cost outlays. A production function such as formula_10 can be constructed in which formula_11 is the quantity of houses produced, formula_12 is the amount of labour employed, formula_13 is the amount of land used, and formula_14 is the amount of other materials. This production function must, however, be adjusted to account for the refurbishing and augmentation of existing buildings. To do this, a second production function is constructed that includes the stock of existing housing and their ages as determinants. The two functions are summed, yielding the total production function. Alternatively, a hedonic pricing model can be regressed.
The long-run price elasticity of supply is quite high. George Fallis (1985) estimates it as 8.2, but in the short run, supply tends to be very price-inelastic. Supply-price elasticity depends on the elasticity of substitution and supply restrictions. There is significant substitutability, both between land and materials and between labour and materials. In high-value locations, developers can typically construct multi-story concrete buildings to reduce the amount of expensive land used. As labour costs have increased since the 1950s, new materials and capital-intensive techniques have been employed to reduce the amount of labour used. However, supply restrictions can significantly affect substitutability. In particular, the lack of supply of skilled labour (and labour-union requirements) can constrain the substitution from capital to labour. Land availability can also constrain substitutability if the area of interest is delineated (i.e., the larger the area, the more suppliers of land, and the more substitution that is possible). Land-use controls such as zoning bylaws can also reduce land substitutability.

==Adjustment mechanism==
The basic adjustment mechanism is a stock/flow model to reflect the fact that about 98% the market is existing stock and about 2% is the flow of new buildings.

In the adjacent diagram, the stock of housing supply is presented in the left panel while the new flow is in the right panel. There are four steps in the basic adjustment mechanism. First, the initial equilibrium price (Ro) is determined by the intersection of the supply of existing housing stock (SH) and the demand for housing (D). This rent is then translated into value (Vo) via discounting cash flows. Value is calculated by dividing current period rents by the discount rate, that is, as a perpetuity. Then value is compared to construction costs (CC) in order to determine whether profitable opportunities exist for developers. The intersection of construction costs and the value of housing services determine the maximum level of new housing starts (HSo). Finally the amount of housing starts in the current period is added to the available stock of housing in the next period. In the next period, supply curve SH will shift to the right by amount HSo.

==Adjustment with depreciation==

The diagram to the right shows the effects of depreciation. If the supply of existing housing deteriorates due to wear, then the stock of housing supply depreciates. Because of this, the supply of housing (SHo) will shift to the left (to SH1) resulting in a new equilibrium demand of R1 (since the number of homes decreased, but demand still exists). The increase of demand from Ro to R1 will shift the value function up (from Vo to V1). As a result, more houses can be produced profitably and housing starts will increase (from HSo to HS1). Then the supply of housing will shift back to its initial position (SH1 to SHo).

==Increase in demand==
The diagram on the right shows the effects of an increase in demand in the short run. If there is an increase in the demand for housing, such as the shift from Do to D1 there will be either a price or quantity adjustment, or both. For the price to stay the same, the supply of housing must increase. That is, supply SHo must increase by HS.

==Increase in costs==
The diagram on the right shows the effects of an increase in costs in the short-run. If construction costs increase (say from CCo to CC1), developers will find their business less profitable and will be more selective in their ventures. In addition some developers may leave the industry. The quantity of housing starts will decrease (HSo to HS1). This will eventually reduce the level of supply (from SHo to SH1) as the existing stock of housing depreciates. Prices will tend to rise (from Ro to R1).

Global real estate markets experienced a 15% drop in housing affordability due to central bank rate hikes in 2024.

==Real estate financing==

There are different ways of real estate financing: governmental and commercial sources and institutions. A homebuyer or builder can obtain financial aid from savings and loan associations, commercial banks, savings banks, mortgage bankers and brokers, life insurance companies, credit unions, federal agencies, individual investors, and builders.

Over the last decade, residential prices increased every year on average by double digits in Beijing or Shanghai. However many observers and researchers argue that fundamentals of the housing sector, both sector-specific and macroeconomic, may have been the driving force behind housing price volatility.

=== Savings and loan associations===
The most important purpose of these institutions is to make mortgage loans on residential property. These organizations, which also are known as savings associations, building and loan associations, cooperative banks (in New England), or homestead associations (in Louisiana), are the primary source of financial assistance to a large segment of American homeowners. As home-financing institutions, they give primary attention to single-family residences and are equipped to make loans in this area.

Some of the most important characteristics of a savings and loan association are:

# It is generally a locally owned and privately managed home-financing institution.
# It receives individuals&#x27; savings and uses these funds to make long-term amortized loans to home purchasers.
# It makes loans for the construction, purchase, repair, or refinancing of houses.
# It is state or federally chartered.

===Commercial banks===
Due to changes in banking laws and policies, commercial banks are increasingly active in home financing. In acquiring mortgages on real estate, these institutions follow two main practices:

# Some banks maintain active and well-organized departments whose primary function is to compete actively for real estate loans. In areas lacking specialized real estate financial institutions, these banks become the source for residential and farm mortgage loans.
# Banks acquire mortgages by simply purchasing them from mortgage bankers or dealers.

In addition, dealer service companies, which were originally used to obtain car loans for permanent lenders such as commercial banks, wanted to broaden their activity beyond their local area. In recent years, however, such companies have concentrated on acquiring mobile home loans in volume for both commercial banks and savings and loan associations. Service companies obtain these loans from retail dealers, usually on a non-recourse basis. Almost all bank or service company agreements contain a credit insurance policy that protects the lender if the consumer defaults.

===Savings banks===
These depository financial institutions are federally chartered, primarily accept consumer deposits, and make home mortgage loans.

===Mortgage bankers and brokers===
Mortgage bankers are companies or individuals that originate mortgage loans, sell them to other investors, service the monthly payments, and may act as agents to dispense funds for taxes and insurance.

Mortgage brokers present homebuyers with loans from a variety of loan sources. Their income comes from the lender making the loan, just like with any other bank. Because they can tap a variety of lenders, they can shop on behalf of the borrower and achieve the best available terms. Despite legislation that could favor major banks, mortgage bankers and brokers keep the market competitive so the largest lenders must continue to compete on price and service. According to Don Burnette of Brightgreen Homeloans in Port Orange, Florida, &quot;The mortgage banker and broker conduit is vital to maintain competitive balance in the mortgage industry. Without it, the largest lenders would be able to unduly influence rates and pricing, potentially hurting the consumer. Competition drives every organization in this industry to constantly improve on their performance, and the consumer is the winner in this scenario.&quot;

===Life insurance companies===
Life insurance companies are another source of financial assistance. These companies lend on real estate as one form of investment and adjust their portfolios from time to time to reflect changing economic conditions. Individuals seeking a loan from an insurance company can deal directly with a local branch office or with a local real estate broker who acts as loan correspondent for one or more insurance companies.

===Credit unions===
These cooperative financial institutions are organized by people who share a common bond—for example, employees of a company, labor union, or religious group. Some credit unions offer home loans in addition to other financial services.

===Federally supported agencies===
Under certain conditions and fund limitations, the Veterans Administration (VA) makes direct loans to creditworthy veterans in housing credit shortage areas designated by the VA&#x27;s administrator. Such areas are generally rural and small cities and towns not near the metropolitan or commuting areas of large cities—areas where GI loans from private institutions are not available.

The federally supported agencies referred to here do not include the so-called second-layer lenders who enter the scene after the mortgage is arranged between the lending institution and the individual home buyer.

===Real estate investment trusts===
Real estate investment trusts (REITs), which began when the Real Estate Investment Trust Act became effective on January 1, 1961, are available. REITs, like savings and loan associations, are committed to real estate lending and can and do serve the national real estate market, although some specialization has occurred in their activities.

In the United States, REITs generally pay little or no federal income tax but are subject to a number of special requirements set forth in the Internal Revenue Code, one of which is the requirement to annually distribute at least 90% of their taxable income in the form of dividends to shareholders.

===Other sources===
Individual investors constitute a fairly large but somewhat declining source of money for home mortgage loans. Experienced observers claim that these lenders prefer shorter-term obligations and usually restrict their loans to less than two-thirds of the value of the residential property. Likewise, building contractors sometimes accept second mortgages in partial payment of the construction price of a home if the purchaser is unable to raise the total amount of the down payment above the first mortgage money offered.

In addition, homebuyers or builders can save their money using FSBO in order not to pay extra fees.

== Common misconceptions ==
A 2022 study published by three professors from the University of California found that people in the United States broadly misunderstand the role that supply plays in counteracting the price of housing. Although most renters and homeowners were able to predict the effect of increasing supply on the market for other goods, the researchers found that only 30 to 40 percent of both groups could correctly predict the effect of new supply when applied to the market for homes. A majority of both renters and homeowners were found to prefer lower rent and housing prices for their city, but struggled to connect this preferred policy outcome to the supply-side solutions advocated for by economists. “Supply skepticism,” as the study labelled this phenomenon, was found to predict opposition to constructing new housing as well as opposition to state level policies that reduce local barriers like exclusionary zoning.

== Political Economy of Real Estate ==
Real estate offers perspectives on understanding some of the factors in social mobility and economic decision-making, both at the macro and the micro levels. It has had a profound impact on not only government policies, but also meaningful discussions and choices for individuals looking to become homeowners. In recent years, liberalization of the mortgage markets and complex finance operations using mortgage as collateral &quot;(See Mortgage-backed security)&quot; have led to the expansion of the world economy. &quot;(See Financialization)&quot;

=== Housing and voting patterns ===
==== Housing and left/right cleavage ====

While popular culture tends to link home ownership with right-wing voting, studies conducted across Europe tend to show mixed results. In Sweden, homeowners from left-wing social classes are likelier to report themselves as right-wing. In France, middle-class voters were three times more likely to vote for Nicolas Sarkozy in the 2012 French presidential election, but results showed few variations between homeowners and tenants among lower-class and upper-class voters. In Germany, homeowners were more likely to vote for conservative parties when house prices were rising. In the UK, studies on the Housing Act 1980 and the 1983 United Kingdom general election tend to show that while purchasing council houses was linked to a decreased likelihood of voting for the Labour Party (UK), it is mostly the Alliance (center-left) that gained those defecting voters. 
Studies in the UK and Germany have also highlighted links between home ownership and the redirection of voting patterns towards center-left parties. In line with results from the 1983 general election, a more recent study has argued that as part of a broader process of ‘gentrification’ of Labour electoral interests, UK homeowners tend to divert from the Conservative party (UK) towards a party that reconciles economic interests and left-wing ideals. In Germany, one study has also pointed out a similar ‘embourgeoisement’ effect of the SPD vote.

Regarding preferences for policy proposals, some studies from the UK tend to demonstrate that, as houses are fixed assets, right-wing homeowners who have seen an increase in their property value tend to be less favorable to redistributive policies and social insurance programs. As their property value increases, Conservative voters tend to consider, to a larger degree, houses, a form of self-supplied insurance, which disincentivizes support for such programs. Those policy preferences are likely to be present to a greater extent when it comes to long-term social insurance and redistributive programs such as pensions due to the fixed nature of houses. 
(See below “The trade-off between Social policies and home ownership)

==== Housing and populism ====

Recently, several studies conducted in several European countries sought to determine the influence of housing on right-wing populist electoral results. While political spectrums and housing markets differ according to countries, studies highlight some cross-national trends.

Studies regarding the relationship between variation in house prices and populist electoral results have found that voters living in areas where house prices increased the least were more prone to vote for right-wing populist parties. One explanation may lie in the fact that as the housing map created winners (those owning in dynamic areas) and losers (those holding in less prosperous areas), those who experienced a relative decline in the value of their homes tended to feel left out of a significant component of household wealth formation, and therefore were inclined to favorite populist political parties which challenged a status quo that did not benefit them. In the UK, some have highlighted a correlation between the relative deflation of housing prices and an increased likelihood of voting in favor of Brexit. Research in France shows that those who saw their home prices increase tended to vote for candidates other than Marine Le Pen in the 2017 French presidential election. In Nordic countries, studies tend to come to similar findings, with data showing an inverse relationship between house price increases and support for right-wing populist parties. Those living in ‘left-behind’ areas (where house prices have decreased by 15%) tended to vote 10% higher for the Danish People’s Party than in ‘booming’ areas (where house prices have increased by 100% In Germany, studies show that die AfD scores are higher in areas where house prices have not risen as much as the average rate. 
Recent work by Julia Cagé and Thomas Piketty seems to corroborate the existence of areas’ prosperity determinants in the vote for right-wing populist parties. Describing the Rassemblement National vote as “a vote of little-middle access to home ownership,” they argue that home ownership is twice as frequent in towns and villages as in cities (the formers generally being considered as less prosperous areas), represent to some a sign of upward social mobility towards neither affluent nor disadvantaged class and who do not felt represented by traditional right-wing political parties, which they consider representing a more favorited population, or by left-wing political parties, which they regard representing less deserving class and not supporting their efforts. Such analysis, combined with previous presentations on house price variations, point in the direction that right-wing populist electoral results are, at least partly, driven by geosocial factors, with lower middle-class people living in less populated areas not feeling supported by traditional political parties and afraid of social downgrading.

=== Debates around intergenerational conflicts ===
Around Europe, debates around generational inequalities have been the subject of several news outlets. Regarding ownership inequality in Europe, data points to a positive relationship between age and home ownership. In England, those over 65 owned 35.8% of all houses in 2022, while they only represented 18.6% of the population in 2021. In Germany, 50.4% of 60-69-year-olds owned their homes, while only 18.4% of 20-29-year-olds did. As older people tend to have more time to accumulate wealth, academics highlight that these inequalities are wider than decades ago. Research shows that such inequalities exist due to a significant increase in housing prices to the annual income, also known as the wealth-to-income ratio. (See below Wealth-to-Income Ratio) Data collected from the Bank of England show that, in 1982, a house cost, on average, only 4.16 times an average British person’s annual income, but it has now climbed to 8.68 times the yearly income in 2023.
Several European countries enacted in the 1990s different public policies aimed to promote home ownership. In the UK during the 1980s, the Thatcher premiership passed the ‘right to buy scheme,’ which saw 3 million council houses sold at a price between 30% and 70% below market prices. In France, liberal housing policies gained ground in the 1970s, enabling the rise of residential suburbs. Nonetheless, some have also nuanced the extent to which countries have uniformly incentivized homeownership during that period. Studies on Nordic countries have highlighted the difference in housing models promoted by public policies, arguing that while Norway has been promoting cooperative and private ownership, it has not so much been the case with Denmark, which has, for example, institutionalized nonprofit renting.

Academics have also pointed out that the strain on capital accumulation that resulted from WWII and post-war era interventionist and redistributionist policies have helped workers – i.e., those who earn a large share of their income through work, to earn a larger share of national income, translating into a greater ability to become homeowners. Such theories would tend to favor the idea that intergenerational homeownership inequalities are more a product of class-based inequalities than intergenerational inequalities as such, as young people struggle to a larger extent not because older people have ‘hoarded’ the housing market but because the capital class, which is not constituted via age but rather by intra-familial transfers and wealth accumulation, have exploited the labor class to a greater extent since the end of the 1970s. In line with this argument, some highlight the importance of considering intragenerational housing wealth inequalities; studies regarding the UK have demonstrated that such household housing wealth inequalities are the most important within the baby-boomer generation, suggesting limits to the intergenerational divide theories.

While several news outlets have framed a growing generational conflict around housing ownership, some studies have argued that if, from an objective perspective, millennials recognized that baby boomers were better off, a relational analysis demonstrated that they did not resent the older generation for their situations but rather the government for out-of-touch policies. As for the baby boomers, they tended to resent sympathy for the younger generations, recognizing that they were facing more significant barriers to home ownership. Similarly, research argues that if the probability of housing being a personal issue significantly decreases with age, the tendency to consider it a country-wide problem, i.e., a public policy issue, remains similar across generations, which would tend to affirm the prominence of inter-generational solidarity rather than inter-generational conflict.

=== Paradigms of Social Welfare Policies Regarding Real Estate Economics ===

Many government policies in social welfare states view houses as assets – a way for families to hedge their risks against eventual retirement and have a safe form of savings alternative to other pensions. Since the 1980s, these governments have often focused on making the housing market more liquid by broadening the access to financing of houses. Bohle and Seabrooke argue that there are three paradigms of housing:

# Social Right - All citizens deserve fair housing. It is the obligation of the state to provide society with the ability to own homes by intervening in the market. (ex. Rent controls, tenure legislation, housing allowances, public/cooperative housing provision, management of housing by public or non-profit corporations, etc.) An example that the scholars offer is the post-war Scandinavian housing policies. Sweden believed that all citizens should have fair access to the housing market and that the state must play an active role in shaping the market to this nature.
# Asset - Houses are individual properties, and the markets work in the supply/demand fluctuation to provide opportunities. Essential for “asset-based welfare.” Furthermore, it serves as collateral for debt, which in turn serves as an investment outlet. (&quot;See neoliberal capitalism&quot;) Pensions are often complementary to housing-related financial products. Government programs would include the privatization of home ownership, deregulation of mortgage markets, the establishment of credit scores, fiscal and tax policies geared to home ownership, and assurances from central banks to stabilize mortgage bond markets.
# Patrimony - Family houses are passed on to younger generations: inheritance laws, family-based tax breaks, and subsidies. Family is seen as the stabilizing force of sharing political and economic preferences, and thus, patrimony is often seen under strong conservative connotation.

There are clear examples in which these three paradigms served as the basis for structural changes in which states’ housing policies evolved based upon the economic changes. In Ireland, the 1980s housing market reflected a patrimony-based housing market – but since then, neoliberal policies have led to cutting social housing programs and increasing private home constructions. Housing finance became even stronger with the EU accession, and banks began asset-based lending. By 2016, the Irish households were the fourth most indebted in the EU, a fifth with residential mortgage debts.: After the Great Recession, Ireland suffered from the Troika, resulting in Irish domestic laws undermining the social policies in favor of its financial health. The Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Bill 2013 made it possible for lenders to repossess homes from borrowers - an action aimed at protecting the financial sector rather than having a coherent housing policy. The vacancy rate of housing in Ireland rose to 12.8%, leaving behind ghost towns. Ultimately, wealthier households in Ireland pass their houses to children while lower-income families are excluded from ever owning property – watching the paradigm of Ireland shift from asset to patrimony.

In Denmark, the persistence of tax breaks for mortgage debt led to Danish consumers becoming one of the most indebted people in the world, with an average of 250% of debt per capita relative to personal income. Denmark used a mortgage-based covered bond system as its form of “privatized monetary policy,” in 1986, the housing bubble burst, leading to the coalition government reducing the mortgage interest deductibility from taxes. After the 1989 reform of the mortgage financing system (in line with the EU’s Second Banking Directive) and the 1990 Social Democratic government’s liberalized mortgage product policies, the credit market and available credit for housing boomed. In the 2000s, cracks began to show between the elites and masses - 2007 reforms allowed Danish banks to enter the mortgage market more aggressively while the foreign investment interests in Danish mortgage bond markets increased. (Increased financialization, the continued road to the housing as asset policies). Continued marketization of housing led some apartments in Copenhagen to triple in price within five years.

 In Hungary, foreign capital began flowing in during its accession to the EU era, and banks in Hungary were encouraged to increase their access to lending and lower borrowing costs, creating a risky housing market. When the housing bubble burst in 2008, the socialist Gordon Bajnai administration (2009-2010) focused on reducing public debt and deficit rather than the private side (over-indebted population). Orban’s government took a pivot from these policies - it angled its attacks on the foreign banks and lenders as the predators for why Hungary fell under economic downfall; the government levied special taxes on banks, insurance companies, and financial sectors. It tried to alleviate the burdens of households of foreign currency loans by allowing borrowers to pay in Hungarian forint (currency) at a preferential rate if they could pay their loans in one lump sum. Lenders were compelled to compensate borrowers for discrepancies between the exchange rate they used for loan repayment and the market exchange rate. However, this pushed the lower-income part of the society even further down; the cut down on subsidies to housing for these groups made homelessness even a crime. The ultraconservative policies pushed the cost of the housing onto the banks rather than taxpayers, while Hungary’s housing deprivation problems and issues with dampness, rot, lack of bathroom facilities, and overcrowding are among the worst in Central and Eastern Europe.

=== Governments’ neoliberal policies and rising mortgage debt levels ===

 The popular academic discourse surrounding the financialization of real estate is that liquidity and furthering of credit stimulate economic growth. Deregulation and liberalization are ways financial regulators intended for the markets to grow – through the increasing utilization of real estate as collateral for other financial products. Such decisions have led to the creation of complex financial transactions that eventually led to the government’s continued neoliberal policies of opening the housing markets to financialization.

 The academic debate around the causes for rising levels of mortgage debts concerns their focus on the supply or the demand side of the housing market. Recent scholars focusing on the demand side explain that consumers purchasing and owning houses seek mortgage lending to complete their purchases, ultimately increasing house prices. Schwartz states that the 1980s deregulation of mortgage markets increased potential credit, resulting in higher demand for real estate and rising prices. In addition, Johnston and Regan showed that increased wages led to households having more liquidity to finance real estate properties, leading to higher demand for houses and, therefore, even more mortgage lending. This side of the academic debate presents an argument that seeks to use increased demand for housing over the years as the primary reason for rising levels of mortgage debt worldwide.

On the other hand, Anderson and Kurzer argued that drivers of housing supply led to a rising level of mortgages and household indebtedness – while also interacting with the demand levels for housing. They studied the Netherlands, Denmark, and Sweden – three countries with the highest levels of outstanding mortgage debts compared to their disposable income and the highest levels of mortgage debts as part of their GDP. In summary, the study presented that the three countries rode the waves of political policies that were formed around the right/center-right governments’ desire in the 1990s to stimulate home ownership and reduce social housing expenses and build a society of self-sufficient home-owners. However, when the more left-leaning governments came to power, they did not reverse these policies. Instead, they introduced further deregulation of mortgage markets to allow more working-class consumers to become homeowners.

As a result, the continued neoliberal policies around the mortgage markets in these three countries led to the growth of banking power. Danish banks saw their annual growth rates in lending exceeding 50% between 2003 and 2007, while in the Netherlands, the Dutch market for securitized assets (in this case, mortgage-backed securities) became the second largest in Europe after the UK in 2008. In Sweden, the Swedish-covered bonds (securities, usually backed by mortgages) were at 55% of GDP in 2014 and more than double the Swedish government bonds. In summary, the scholars argue that the Netherlands, Denmark, and Sweden mortgage markets were liberalized to encourage financial innovation and promote homeownership. Still, residential construction remained stagnant, leading to an inelastic housing supply. Government officials and regulators liberalized the mortgage market using credit and financial products such as special mortgage packages and consumer tax incentives to bypass this issue. Because all three countries have very high tax rates, the fiscal relief offered by tax incentives from having mortgages seemed even more lucrative, increasing the demand. At the same time, the supply of housing continued to stay inelastic. Anderson and Kurzer conclude that this led to the collapse of housing markets under the crumbling legs of complex mortgage-backed financial products.

Ultimately, the debate around the rising mortgage debt levels worldwide centers around financialization and the political agenda of homeownership. There are strong connections to government programs that reflect the political ideologies of homeownership and the economic tools to achieve those means. In the case of the Netherlands, Sweden, and Denmark, Anderson and Kurzer showed that the center-right governments began increasing homeownership to cut social housing costs and reduce social policy dependence. The center-left government that subsequently followed also used similar tools of neo-liberal housing policies to enable homeownership for working-class citizens.

=== The trade-off between Social policies and home ownership ===

Academic debates surround the nature of the trade-off between social welfare and house ownership. In the 1980s, Jim Kemeney presented that homeownership and social welfare policies have an inverse relationship. First, Kemeney argued that citizens living in a country with meager retirement pensions and/or lacking government support of public welfare policies would tend to make private contributions in their earlier phases of life towards retirement – often in the form of housing. Homeowners would feel that their home is a valuable asset that would safeguard them from the risks of eventual retirement and aging. Thus, they would feel less inclined to rely on or support the government’s public welfare policies. The government’s social welfare policies would further undermine the value of the houses because the public support of the social housing upkeep will ultimately drive the value of the homes downward. Kemeney showed these findings from his analysis of eight OECD Countries, including Sweden, the Netherlands, the UK, the USA, Canada, Australia, and others. About twenty years later, Frank Castles, a professor of political science at the Australian National University, conducted more in-depth research on Kemeney’s thesis and strongly confirmed his case. Castles would adjust Kemeny’s thesis to show that the “really big trade-off” was between homeownership and pensions instead of the welfare state.

Kemeney’s main argument is presented in his work: “My overall argument was that high rates of home ownership impacted on society through various forms of privatisation, influencing urban form, public transport, life-styles, gender roles, systems of welfare and social security as well as other dimensions of social structure. I argued that an overwhelming emphasis on home ownership created a lifestyle based on detached housing, privatised urban transport and its resulting ‘‘one-household’’ (and increasingly ‘‘one-person’’) car ownership, a traditional gendered division of labour based on female housewifery and the fulltime working male, and strong resistance to public expenditure that necessitated the high taxes needed to fund quality universal welfare provision.” 

In 2020, Gunten and Kohl returned to Kemeny’s thesis. They presented a different side of the academic research, presenting in an updated study that this inverse relationship between social welfare and house ownership converges upwards to what they labeled the “dual ratchet effect.” Huber and Stephens argued that the political costs of stopping social policies could be damaging, and thus, social policies are more resistant to their opposition. Gunten and Kohl reciprocate this argument for homeownership – homeownership is also used to garner political support due to its popularity amongst citizens – and thus, the damaging political costs from withdrawing the benefits of having public policies favoring homeownership (ex. In the form of tax breaks, subsidies, etc.) lead to a resiliency against its opposition. This inelasticity of both social policies and homeownership resulted in the fact that high costs associated with decreasing either of the policies resulted in them being more responsive to upward drivers rather than downward effects. Governments bypassed the issue of unloading the problems of social policies on homeowners by using the credit markets – resorting to inflation in the 70s, public debt in the 80s, and private debt in the 2000s. This was labeled as the buying time hypothesis by Gunten and Kohl and will be further supported by their capital supply hypothesis – where the amount of capital available will increase due to the deregulation of the international financial market since the 1970s and the growth of private pension fund assets leading to an abundance of available capital. In conclusion, Gunten and Kohl present a case where the inverse relationship between homeownership and social policies existed in the 80s but has changed towards the dual ratchet effect of simultaneous, upward convergence. Furthermore, they state that if the trade-off in the long run still holds, the correction costs of homeownership and pensions will eventually correct themselves in the long run when the amount of capital begins to dwindle and the credit market runs dry.

<text>Philip William May (22 April 1864 – 5 August 1903) was an English caricaturist who, with his vigorous economy of line, played an important role in moving away from Victorian styles of illustration towards the creation of the modern humorous cartoon.

==Biography==
Phil May was born at Wortley, near Leeds, the son of an engineer, who died when May was nine years old. His mother was the daughter of Eugene Macarthy, one time manager of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. She was left in very poor circumstances and the family had a great struggle to exist.

May&#x27;s grandfather, a country gentleman, had some talent as a draughtsman and liked drawing caricatures. At the age of twelve, in Leeds, May became friendly with Fred Fox, whose father was the scenic artist at the recently opened Grand Theatre. That gave him a free run of the theatre, where he used to sketch sections of other people&#x27;s designs for costumes, as well as sketching actors&#x27; portraits, for which he received one shilling, later rising to five shillings. Another of his contemporaries was Walter Curtis, who became prominent as a music hall comedian and general entertainer.

May had begun to earn his living in a solicitor&#x27;s office; before he was fifteen he had acted as time-keeper at a foundry, had tried to become a jockey and had been on the stage at Scarborough and Leeds. When only fourteen years old, had drawings accepted for the &quot;Yorkshire Gossip&quot;. When he was about seventeen he went to London with a sovereign in his pocket. He suffered extreme want, sleeping out in the parks and streets, until he obtained employment as designer to a theatrical costumier. He also drew posters and cartoons, and for about two years worked for the &quot;St Stephens Review&quot;, until he was advised to go to Australia for his health.

During the three years (1886–1889) he spent in Australia he was attached to &quot;The Sydney Bulletin&quot;, or &quot;The Bulletin&quot; as it was better known, for which many of his best drawings were made. He produced about 800 drawings for &quot;The Bulletin&quot;. On his return to Europe he went to Paris by way of Rome, where he worked hard for some time, before he appeared in 1892 in London to resume his interrupted connection with the &quot;St Stephens Review&quot;. His studies of the London guttersnipe and the coster-girl rapidly made him famous. His overflowing sense of fun, his genuine sympathy with his subjects, and his kindly wit were on a par with his artistic ability.

While drawing for &quot;The Bulletin&quot; he would produce the illustration “The Mongolian Octopus” (1886), an anti-Chinese cartoon which has been described as “the most scandalous and racist cartoon ever to grace the Australian media”. &quot;The Bulletin&quot;’s motto at this time was “Australia for the White Man”; May himself has been described as “openly racist and anti-Semitic”.

It was often said that the extraordinary economy of line which was a characteristic feature of his drawings had been forced upon him by the deficiencies of the printing equipment of the &quot;Sydney Bulletin&quot;. It was in fact the result of a laborious process which involved a number of preliminary sketches, and a carefully considered system of elimination. His later work included some excellent political portraits. He became a regular member of the staff of &quot;Punch&quot; in 1896, and in his later years his services were retained exclusively for &quot;Punch&quot; and &quot;The Graphic&quot;. In 1898, he was a founder member of the London Sketch Club. He died from tuberculosis in 1903 at his home in St John&#x27;s Wood, London.

==Influence and reputation==
May was a major influence on the style of cartoon drawing in the 20th century. In 1918, Percy Bradshaw wrote in &quot;The Art of the Illustrator&quot; that May &quot;surely gave more magic to a single line than any draftsman who has ever lived, and he was unquestionably the creator of the simplified technique of modern humorous drawing&quot;. May&#x27;s work was a major influence on David Low. Low recalled that his early aspirations were dampened when he saw the &quot;intricate technical quality&quot; of most &quot;Punch&quot; cartoons, which seemed too difficult to emulate: &quot;But then I came on Phil May, who combined quality with apparent facility ... Once having discovered Phil May I never let him go.&quot;

In 1909, initiatives were being made in Leeds to commemorate May and in association with Leeds Art Gallery, a committee, which included Mr. R.N. Middleton and architect Sydney Kitson - the half-brother of Lord Airedale - successfully held an exhibition of May&#x27;s original drawings and placed a memorial tablet at 66 Wallace Street, Leeds where May had lived. May was influenced by Sir Frank Brangwyn whose portrait he drew around 1896, when the two men were on holiday in France. According to Brangwyn, despite good intentions of painting hard all day every day, May and he would often spend days drinking and sketching at a French cafe instead. 

There was an exhibition of May&#x27;s drawings at the Fine Art Society in 1895, and another at the Leicester Galleries in 1903. A selection of his drawings contributed to the periodical press. Examples of his work can be found at the leading Australian galleries, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the British Museum, and around three hundred drawings and watercolours are in the collection of Leeds Art Gallery. From 1892 to 1904 there were thirteen editions of &quot;Phil May&#x27;s Illustrated Winter Annual&quot;, with three supplemental &quot;Summer Annuals&quot;. In addition to his &quot;Summer&quot; and &quot;Winter Annuals&quot;, various collections were published, including &quot;Phil May&#x27;s Sketch Book&quot; (1895), &quot;Phil May&#x27;s Guttersnipes&quot; (1896), &quot;Phil May&#x27;s Graphic Pictures&quot; and &quot;Phil May&#x27;s A. B. C.&quot; (1897), &quot;Phil May&#x27;s Album&quot; (1899), &quot;Phil May, Sketches from Punch&quot; (1903). Posthumous publications include &quot;Phil May in Australia&quot; (1904), &quot;The Phil May Folio&quot; (1904), and &quot;Humorists of the Pencil, Phil May&quot; (1908).

<text>Kandia Kouyaté (also known as Kandja Kouyaté, born in 1959 in Kita, Mali) is a Malian &quot;jelimuso&quot; (a female griot) and kora player; she has earned the prestigious title of &quot;ngara&quot;, and is sometimes called &quot;La dangereuse&quot; and &quot;La Grande vedette malienne&quot;. Kouyaté&#x27;s dense, emotional, hypnotic manner of singing and her lyrical talents have earned huge acclaim in Mali, though she remained relatively little known outside Africa, due to extremely limited availability of her recordings. Her home town of Kita is known for love songs, which form a large part of Kouyaté&#x27;s repertoire. She also sings praise songs.

== Background ==
Kouyaté&#x27;s father, a balafon (West African xylophone) player himself, did not want her to go into music and wanted her to rely on a solid education instead of the unpredictability of a musical career. Secretly, she learned from her mother and other family members how to sing and began performing occasionally at private gatherings. As a young girl, she began singing with her uncle Mady Sylla Kouyaté in his popular dance band, The Apollos, in Bamako.

Kouyaté&#x27;s journey with The Apollos began when she was 16 years old. While still in school, her father fell ill and could no longer work, leaving the family struggling to make ends meet. In an effort to support them, Kouyaté joined the group. The Apollos&#x27; unique sound blended traditional, contemporary, local, and international influences, offering her the opportunity to not only help her family but also showcase her powerful contralto voice. Her unique sound brought an added depth to the group&#x27;s music, helping to elevate their popularity and broaden their appeal.

== Career ==
Kouyaté&#x27;s solo career began in the early 1980s. She used &quot;female choral vocals accompanying her,&quot; in the background of her performances. The practice was later picked up by stars like Mory Kante and Salif Keita, and is now an &quot;integral part of Malian music.&quot; Kouyaté lofted the band&#x27;s popularity, drawing the interests of the most important musicians and patrons of the city. Back in Bamako, she was pursued by wealthy businessman Amary Daou who gave her large amounts of money and cars as gifts. He later produced Kouyaté&#x27;s second album &quot;Balassama / Sarama&quot; (1983). She released another vinyl discs &quot;Kandja Kouyaté et L’Ensemble Instrumental National du Mali&quot; the same year.

As her reputation spread around West Africa, her music attracted many rewards for public and private appearances. Wealthy patrons such as &quot;Foutanga Babani Sissoko&quot; showered her with money, a car, and even a small airplane, indicating her popularity in Mali. Outside of Mali, she was not well known due to refusing to make a CD recording for a long time. It is almost two decades after the start of her career that her voice and talents would be showcased for an international audience.

Preferring to sing only for private and public events, Kouyaté did not make studio recordings. Instead, she released cassette locales. Differing from published music cassettes and other commercial recordings, cassette locales are one-off recordings of a performance that happen in the moment. According to Lucy Durán the cassette locale &quot;is one way in which a jeli [griot] can seek out new patrons or enhance existing relationships with patrons.&quot; Cassette locales are not made for the market, but many copies end up there such as Kouyaté&#x27;s Moyomba which was recorded during an 1980 performance in Abidjan, Côte d&#x27;Ivoire. Kouyaté made four cassette locales which, while popular in Mali, went unheard outside of West Africa. Many record companies were eager to sign her, but she rejected all offers.

One of Kouyaté&#x27;s most passionate fans was record producer Ibrahima Sylla, who urged her to give him the opportunity to make an album with her. She frequently declined, but he persisted. After years, Kouyaté gave in and her debut solo album Kita Kan (Sterns 1999) was released internationally in 1999. Her following album, Biriko (Sterns 2002) was released in 2002; both for Sterns Africa.

Kandia Kouyaté toured Europe in 1999 alongside Guinean singers Sekouba Bambino &amp; Oumou Diabate and with a 12 piece West African ensemble that included kora, djembe, ngoni, balafon, bass, keyboards, backing vocals and percussion. The tour named as &#x27;The Griot Groove Tour&#x27; included concerts in Germany, Austria, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom.

In 2003, Kandia Kouyate toured Ireland, spreading her music, and officially launcing the FeileAfrica Movement in Cork City. The movemenet was a project to foster greater understanding, appreciation and integration of African culture in the Irish society. Kouyate noticed that there was a large African dispora in Ireland and sought to create a festival that was deeply committed to celebrating African heritage and fostering cross-cultural dialogue.

== Personal life ==
Kandia Kouyaté suffered a stroke in late 2004. Her recovery was slow and challenging as she hardly spoke and did not sing at all. Many thought she was never going to sing again. In 2011, producer Ibrahima Sylla, whose health was also declining, visited Kouyaté at her home in Bamako and convinced her to return to the recording studio. Sylla died in December 2013 and did not live to complete the album, but with the help of François Bréant, who had worked with him on big records such as Salif Keita&#x27;s &quot;Soro&quot; (Sterns 1987) and Thione Seck&#x27;s &quot;Orientation&quot; (Sterns 2005), and Sylla&#x27;s daughter Binetou, the project Renascence was completed in 2015. Kandia Kouyaté&#x27;s latest album embodies its title. &quot;Renascence,&quot; her first release since experiencing her stroke in 2004, signifies a revival of both her career and her unique sound, which stands out in West African music.

<doc id="1327787" wikidata="Q6810665" url="?curid=1327787" title="Mel Bush">
<text>Melanie &quot;Mel&quot; Bush is a fictional character played by Bonnie Langford in the long-running British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. Mel is a computer programmer from the 20th century who is a companion of the Sixth and Seventh Doctors, first appearing on-screen when the Sixth Doctor showed an adventure with her to the Time Lords in order to prove that he would become a better person in the future. Following this, she is shown accompanying the Doctor as a companion, with no further explanation given as to how she met the Doctor. 

Despite initial plans for the character&#x27;s meeting with the Sixth Doctor to be depicted on-screen, the departure of Sixth Doctor actor Colin Baker made this unable to happen. Due to changes in script production, Mel&#x27;s character was altered to adapt to whatever script she was in, resulting in a lack of a character arc. Langford departed the role of Mel in 1987&#x27;s &quot;Dragonfire&quot;; following this, Langford reprised the role of Mel in several audio drama productions produced by Big Finish Productions and made a cameo appearance in the 2022 serial &quot;The Power of the Doctor.&quot; Mel went on to appear in a recurring role in following episodes of the series, where the character&#x27;s backstory and personality were fleshed out in these episodes in greater depth than in her prior appearances. 

Mel was unpopular in her original appearances due to appearing as a thinly characterized stereotype to audiences. Aspects of her portrayal have been praised, and further reappearances of the character following her departure from the series have been highlighted for broadening the character&#x27;s depth.

==Character biography==
Mel is an orphaned computer programmer from the 20th century who originates from the village of Pease Pottage in West Sussex, England. She has an eidetic memory, and a cheery, optimistic personality. She is a health enthusiast and a vegetarian, often encouraging the slightly portly Sixth Doctor to exercise more and drink carrot juice. Mel first appears in the serial &quot;Terror of the Vervoids&quot;, part of the 14-part story &quot;The Trial of a Time Lord&quot;. She is called to the Sixth Doctor&#x27;s (Colin Baker) defense during his trial by his people, the Time Lords. She becomes a companion of the Doctor at a point in the future, with the Doctor displaying an adventure with Mel to show the Time Lords that he would become a better person.

Mel is later seen travelling with the Doctor following this episode, and her first meeting with the Doctor is never elaborated upon within the show itself. She appears in six stories following her debut, eventually departing the series in the episode &quot;Dragonfire&quot; (1987) alongside the recurring character Sabalom Glitz (Tony Selby). Following this, Mel appears in the 1993 charity episode &quot;Dimensions in Time&quot;, though the episode&#x27;s canonicity to the series&#x27; events is disputed. The character later appeared in several audio dramas produced by Big Finish Productions.

Mel returns in the 2022 special, &quot;The Power of the Doctor&quot;, alongside several other former companions, who gather together as a support group to talk of their experiences with the Doctor. Mel next appears in the 2023 special, &quot;The Giggle&quot;, where it is revealed that she was recruited by UNIT, having returned to Earth after Glitz&#x27;s death. She helps the Fourteenth (David Tennant) and Fifteenth Doctors (Ncuti Gatwa) in defeating the Toymaker (Neil Patrick Harris), who had taken control of the minds of the human race, with Mel being unaffected by the Toymaker&#x27;s control due to her previous experiences with the Doctor.

Mel reappears in the series fourteen two-part finale &quot;The Legend of Ruby Sunday&quot; and &quot;Empire of Death&quot;, where she infiltrates Triad Technology on behalf of UNIT to investigate Susan Triad (Susan Twist), reuniting her with the Doctor once again. After it is revealed that Triad is in fact a minion for Sutekh (Gabriel Woolf), an old enemy of the Doctor&#x27;s, Mel helps the Doctor escape back to UNIT HQ, where she, the Doctor and Ruby Sunday (Millie Gibson) use a special machine called a &quot;memory TARDIS&quot; to escape as Sutekh destroys the rest of the universe. Sutekh kills and possesses Mel, and animates Mel&#x27;s body to return the Doctor and Ruby to the present day. After the Doctor defeats Sutekh and restores the universe, Mel returns to normal.

Following the episode, Langford released a book starring Mel and Glitz titled &quot;Death in the Stars&quot;, which features the pair attempting to solve a murder in which they are the prime suspects.

==Development==
Series producer John Nathan-Turner wished to depict Mel&#x27;s first meeting with the Doctor on-screen in an episode which would have followed &quot;Trial of a Time Lord&quot;. However, the subsequent departure of lead actor Colin Baker prior to production of the new season made an in-universe introduction between the Sixth Doctor and Mel impossible. A new script editor was hired to the series following Season 24 who wished to take the series in a different direction. As a result, Mel&#x27;s character was written to adapt to the episodes as written, and was given no character arc. Due to a lack of clarification regarding her backstory, many writers, including Gary Russell and Craig Hinton, have attempted to give her more detail in spin-off material for the series. Mel&#x27;s last name &quot;Bush&quot; was never used on-screen, only being used in spin-off audio dramas produced by Big Finish Productions.
Mel is portrayed by Bonnie Langford. Langford at the time was a well-known, veteran actor, which authors at &quot;SFX&quot; considered to be part of John Nathan-Turner&#x27;s plans to get &quot;Doctor Who&quot; talked about in the press. Langford stated that she had not been happy with her performance in the classic series, with Mel&#x27;s role in the original series being considered by Langford to be akin to a &quot;diversion,&quot; which led to Langford feeling as though she couldn&#x27;t &quot;find her footing&quot; in the role of Mel. 

Mel was eventually removed from the series; while it has been stated that poor audience reaction to Mel&#x27;s role in the classic series led to the character&#x27;s hasty removal from the series, co-star Sylvester McCoy has stated that the reason for her departure was because &quot;[Langford] couldn&#x27;t take it anymore,&quot; with Langford electing to leave the show of her own accord. In a later interview, Langford stated she left the series because producers had not asked her to stay on for another season, and Langford wished to guarantee she had another role lined up following her role on &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. The producers were originally content to let Langford leave according to McCoy; Mel had no departure scene in the original script of &quot;Dragonfire.&quot; According to McCoy, he had to argue with producers to get a scene for Mel&#x27;s departure, with the producers using a scene McCoy shot for a screen test for the departure scene.

After Langford had collaborated with &quot;Doctor Who&quot; showrunner Russell T Davies on an audio drama, Langford was directly asked by Davies to return to the revived series of &quot;Doctor Who,&quot; with Langford being sent a script &quot;out of the blue&quot; by Davies with an offer to return. Unlike in the original series, Mel&#x27;s character now utilized her technological background that had been often ignored in classic series episodes. Langford stated that her work with Big Finish had allowed her to continue to hone Mel&#x27;s character, which she stated aided her performance in the revived series of the show. According to Langford, Mel was &quot;a lot calmer. She’s a lot more resilient and resourceful and I think she&#x27;s a lot more independent,&quot; and that &quot;she&#x27;s grown up, she&#x27;s been around, she&#x27;s seen a lot.&quot;

She also stated that she preferred playing Mel in the revived series than in the classic series due to Mel&#x27;s maturation, and also responded positively to the support she had received from fans for her role and for Davies&#x27;s expansion of the character. Langford explained that Mel&#x27;s in-universe reason for returning was because &quot;she had to stop travelling the universe and actually, literally, get back to down to Earth and face the things she&#x27;s been running away from.&quot; Davies originally planned to kill Mel at the end of &quot;Empire of Death&quot; (2024), but decided against it during writing of the episode. During the in-episode commentary for &quot;Empire of Death,&quot; Davies hinted that the mystery of Mel&#x27;s family would play a role in the future of the series.

== Reception ==
Contemporary audiences strongly disliked Mel, primarily due to Mel often acting in a damsel in distress role, leading to plots focused around getting Mel out of trouble. Many audiences viewed her as a &quot;crybaby&quot; that distracted from more important stories. Her role, which was considered an outdated stereotype, was not liked by many audiences, and the character became widely remembered for her high-pitched screaming when faced with dangerous situations. During her time on the show, less than half of viewers enjoyed her character. The BBC&#x27;s internal viewer reaction reports stated that Mel was a highly unpopular character, with a large number of viewers wishing the character had been eaten during the episode &quot;Paradise Towers&quot; (1987). 

Adi Tantimedh, writing for &quot;Bleeding Cool&quot;, additionally stated that Mel was associated with the negative side of the classic series of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; due to her minimal story role and the low quality of the seasons she starred in. However, despite criticisms towards the character, Tantimedh appreciated the optimism of her character despite how little that trait was acknowledged in the classic series. Mel&#x27;s character was also described as adding &quot;sweetness&quot; to the Sixth Doctor&#x27;s usual irritable personality; when she was paired with McCoy&#x27;s Seventh Doctor, the character&#x27;s compassion was emphasized, which was further shown later on with her joining Glitz, a character who she wished to help grow into a better person. Mel&#x27;s role in the series was debated by authors of &quot;SFX&quot;; while her role was considered poorly written and underdeveloped, Langford&#x27;s performance was stated to be enjoyed by children at the time, and Langford was praised for being able to give weight to Mel&#x27;s weaker character.

Mel&#x27;s re-appearance in the series was highlighted for expanding her character, with her reappearances in Big Finish-produced audio dramas and the revived television series being praised by fans due to the further development of her character. Tantimedh additionally praised Mel&#x27;s return to the series for adding depth to Mel&#x27;s character and allowing the character to evolve past sexist tropes that had been present in her prior appearances.

<doc id="1327792" wikidata="Q3808035" url="?curid=1327792" title="Jerry Perenchio">
<text>Andrew Jerrold Perenchio (December 20, 1930 – May 23, 2017) was an American billionaire businessman and philanthropist. He was at one time the chairman and chief executive officer of Univision.

==Early life==
Perenchio was the grandson of Italian immigrants Giovanni Batiste (later John) Perenchio and Madeline D&#x27;Adda, who came to the United States in 1896 from the northern Italian village of Pavone. His grandfather established the Fresno Grape Exchange, built a packinghouse that shipped fresh fruits and vegetables to the Great Lakes region, and later founded the Crestview Winery. Perenchio was raised in Fresno until the age of fifteen, when he was sent to Black Foxe Military Institute in Los Angeles for three-and-a-half years, graduating in 1949.

That fall, he enrolled at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), attending for five years and completing his B.S. in business in 1954. He financed his own way through college, first with a series of odd jobs and then by establishing a small company – Party Management – that booked bands and catered parties at UCLA and the University of Southern California.

During his last two years at UCLA, Perenchio was a member of the Air Force ROTC, which required that he serve a three-year hitch in the Air Force after graduating. In 1955, he entered the Air Force as a 2nd Lieutenant and earned his wings as a single-engine jet fighter pilot. He was promoted to 1st Lieutenant and received an honorable discharge in 1958.

==Career==

===Music Corporation of America (MCA)===
In 1958, Perenchio joined MCA Inc. in the Band and Act Department. He moved up the ranks to become the youngest vice president in the agency&#x27;s history, and was made Head of the Concert Department for the eleven Western states and the Far East. Perenchio has said that he got his &quot;MBA at MCA&quot; and learned basic tenets that later informed his Rules of the Road: &quot;take options, never grant them&quot;; &quot;never sell assets – lease them on a very short string&quot;; &quot;stay in the business you understand&quot;; &quot;make the calls and know the territory.&quot;

He worked at MCA for four years until July 13, 1962, when the United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division shut down MCA&#x27;s talent-representing operations.

===Perenchio Artists/Chartwell Artists===
After the break-up of MCA, Perenchio started Perenchio Artists with partner Fred Dale in 1963. Its roster of clients included Andy Williams, Johnny Mathis, Henry Mancini, José Feliciano, Glen Campbell, Sergio Mendes, the Kingston Trio, and the Righteous Brothers, among others, many of whom followed Perenchio from MCA. He eventually merged with the Hugh French Agency to form Chartwell Artists, which represented actors, directors, writers, musicians, and singers. Perenchio&#x27;s focus remained on live entertainment. 

In 1969, while in London with Henry Mancini, Perenchio was introduced to Elton John, who had just recorded his first album. By the following summer, in August, 1970, Perenchio brought John from London to Los Angeles and rented out the Troubadour club in Hollywood for two weeks to showcase John&#x27;s talent. Word got out after the first performance and John became an overnight sensation, launching his career in the United States.

Chartwell Artists grew to be the fifth-largest talent agency in the world, with such notable clients as Campbell, John, Feliciano, Mancino, Mathis, Mendes, Richard Burton, Elizabeth Taylor, Jane Fonda, Marlon Brando, Donovan, Rod Taylor, and Michael Landon.

Perenchio sold Chartwell in 1971 to Marvin Josephson&#x27;s International Famous Agency when Perenchio decided to leave the agency business.

===Sports promotion===
In March 1971, Perenchio promoted the Fight of the Century at Madison Square Garden that brought together two unbeaten world heavyweight boxing champions, Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier. Each fighter was guaranteed $2.5 million for the fight. The event blended sports with spectacle and glamorized boxing, in part because the sold-out crowd at the Garden included celebrities and politicians. Perenchio enlisted concert promoters to help sell 1.5 million closed-circuit tickets throughout the United States, and sold the rights in over 100 countries. Two years later, in September 1973, he promoted the Battle of the Sexes tennis match between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs that took place at the Houston Astrodome. It was the largest live audience (30,472) for any tennis match ever, and was the highest rated broadcast for that year when it was televised during prime-time on ABC.

===Tandem Productions/Embassy Communications===

Looking to branch out into television and motion pictures, Perenchio joined Norman Lear and Bud Yorkin in 1973 as a partner at Tandem Productions, and was made president and CEO. As part of the deal, Perenchio brought with him Alan F. Horn, a young Harvard Business School graduate whom he had recently hired away from Procter &amp; Gamble in Cincinnati. In recruiting Horn, Perenchio wanted to bring someone new into the business, someone with an outside perspective that he could train. Within a few years, Perenchio made Horn president of Tandem and the two worked together from 1973 to 1985 until the company and its parent company, Embassy Communications were sold to Columbia Pictures. Horn went on to become a prominent figure in the film industry; he co-founded Castle Rock Entertainment, was president and COO of Warner Brothers and then served as chairman of Walt Disney Studios.

Perenchio&#x27;s business acumen combined with the creative talents of Lear and Yorkin transformed Tandem into the top television production and distribution company of its time, with hit shows that included &quot;All in the Family&quot;, &quot;Sanford and Son&quot;, &quot;Maude&quot;, &quot;Good Times&quot; and &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes.&quot; Perenchio and Lear went on to form T.A.T. Communications Company – which launched &quot;The Jeffersons&quot; and &quot;One Day at a Time,&quot; along with a number of other successful half-hour situation comedies &quot;–&quot; and later purchased Embassy Pictures in 1982 (with Horn as CEO). He teamed up with Yorkin, separately, to produce the 1982 dystopian science fiction thriller &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, directed by Ridley Scott and starring Harrison Ford. Perenchio and Lear sold Embassy to The Coca-Cola Company in 1985, for $485 million in Coca-Cola stock.

After the sale of Embassy Communications, Perenchio went on to produce &quot;Driving Miss Daisy&quot; with the Zanuck Company in 1989. The film featured Jessica Tandy and Morgan Freeman, and won four Academy Awards including Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Actress and Best Picture. In 2002, Perenchio produced &quot;Frida&quot; with his wife Margaret Perenchio, which starred Salma Hayek.

===Other business ventures===
Throughout his career, Perenchio brokered some of the most lucrative deals in the entertainment industry: the sale of Caesars Palace to Lums Restaurants in 1969; the sale of A&amp;M Records to PolyGram in 1989; and the sale of the Motown Records – again to PolyGram – in 1993.

He is considered a pioneer of pay television and co-founded National Subscription Television (ON-TV) in 1977, which featured mainstream movies, sports events and concert specials and became the largest &quot;over-the-air&quot; pay television network in the world. From 1985 to 1987 Perenchio owned the Loews Theaters, with locations in New York, New Jersey, Texas, California and five other states. With the relaxation of federal regulations concerning the Paramount Decrees, he sold the chain to Tri-Star Pictures at nearly four times the purchase price. It was the first deal of its kind between a theater chain and a film studio since the antitrust ruling by the Supreme Court in 1948.

===Univision===
Perenchio&#x27;s most ambitious enterprise was partnering with Mexican media titan Emilio Azcárraga Milmo to purchase the Univision television network in 1992 for $550 million. The network was renamed Univision Communications, Inc. and built into a Fortune 500 company. Perenchio served as chairman and chief executive officer, and was the Controlling Shareholder.

Over a period of fifteen years, Univision expanded existing facilities, purchased 35 additional television stations, added Spanish radio stations, acquired Mexican record companies, and grew into one of the most successful multimedia companies in the world.

It became the most popular Spanish-language broadcast network in the United States and the first foreign language television network to occasionally outperform English language networks in the United States ratings. In 1996 the company went public and traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol UVN. Perenchio sold Univision Communications in March 2007 for $13.5 billion to the Saban Capital Group, led by investor Haim Saban.

==Personal life==

Perenchio was married three times and was separated from his third wife, Margaret Perenchio. He had one son and two adopted daughters from his first marriage, along with six grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.

In 1986 Perenchio purchased the 42-room former Arnold Kirkeby estate in Bel Air known as Chartwell, famed as the Clampett family mansion in the 1960s &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; TV series. He remodeled the home to more closely resemble the original design of an authentic 18th-century French chateau. He afterward bought many of the surrounding properties, expanding the compound to nearly 13 acres of land.

Perenchio died on May 23, 2017, of lung cancer in his home at the age of 86.

==Philanthropy==
In late 2014, Perenchio announced that he would leave much of his art collection — at least 47 works valued at more than $500 million — to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. His holdings include paintings by Claude Monet, Édouard Manet, and Pablo Picasso. At the same press conference, former Los Angeles County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky said of Perenchio, &quot;There is no citizen of this community who has been more generous, and has asked for less...&quot;

==Politics==
A lifelong Republican, Perenchio was a supporter of initiatives and advocacy organizations that benefited the GOP. He was co-finance director for Senator John McCain&#x27;s 2008 presidential campaign as well as an early and influential supporter of Carly Fiorina&#x27;s 2016 presidential primary campaign.

==Awards and honors==
From 2000, Perenchio served on the board of trustees for The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation. In 2011 he received an honorary Doctorate of Fine Arts Degree from Cal State University, Fresno at the school&#x27;s Centennial Commencement.

<text>William May (died 1560), also known as William Meye, was Dean of the Order of the British Empire. He was nominated Archbishop of York in 1560, but died before he could take office.

William May was the brother of John May, bishop of Carlisle. He was educated at Cambridge, where he was a fellow of Trinity Hall, and in 1537, president of Queens&#x27; College. May heartily supported the Reformation, signed the Ten Articles in 1536, and helped in the production of &quot;The Institution of a Christian Man&quot;. He had close connection with the diocese of Ely, being successively chancellor, vicar-general and prebendary. In 1545 he was made a prebendary of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, and, in the following year, Dean of the Order of the British Empire.

His favorable report on the Cambridge colleges saved them from dissolution. He was dispossessed during the reign of Queen Mary, but restored to the deanery on Elizabeth&#x27;s accession. He died on the day he was elected Archbishop of York.

<doc id="1327800" wikidata="Q4313424" url="?curid=1327800" title="Demographics of Arunachal Pradesh">
<text>The Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh has a total population of roughly 1.4 million (as of 2011) on an area of 84,000 km2, amounting to a population density of about 17 pop./km2 (far below the Indian average of 370 pop./km2 but significantly higher than similarly mountainous Ladakh). The &quot;indigenous groups&quot; account for about two thirds of population, while immigrants, mostly of Bengali/Hindi belt origin, account for the remaining third.

==List of tribes==

The &quot;Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Lists (Modification) Order&quot; (1956 and as inserted by Act 69 of 1986) lists twelve tribes of Arunachal Pradesh explicitly, but makes explicit that the list is non-exhaustive by noting that &quot;all tribes of the State, including&quot; those listed are to be considered &quot;Scheduled&quot;. There are 26 major tribes and more than 100 sub tribes in Arunachal Pradesh.
The twelve tribes listed are:
Adi (Abor), Aka (Hruso), Apatani, Nyishi, Tagin, Galo, Khampti, Mishmi, Monpa, &quot;any Naga tribes&quot;, Sherdukpen, Singpho.

By ethnolinguistic classification:

***Tibetans (Tibetan languages)
**Khamba
**Tani
***Apatani/Tani, Galo/Abor, Nyishi, Hill Miri, Tagin, Na/Nga, Mising/Mishing
***Adi/Lhoba (Millang, Minyong, Padam 
**Digaro-Mishmi
***Mishmi (Idu Mishmi, Digaro Mishmi/Taraon/Darang Deng), 
**Miju
***Miju Mishmi, Zekhring
**Lolo-Burmese

**Khamti
**Khamyang
* Other Indigenous Assamese people

==Distribution of various ethno-linguistic group in the state==
As one of the Seven Sister States, or eight if including Sikkim in India&#x27;s remote north-east, it is culturally at least as much part of Southeast Asia as it is of South Asia; ethnolinguistically, it is divided between various Tibeto-Burman speaking Tribes. Monpa area bordering Bhutan to the west, the Tani and Mishmi areas in the center, Singpho/Tangsa/Yobin area bordering Myanmar to the east and the Naga area bordering Nagaland in the south. It shares a large part of its border with China and the Indian state of Assam. In between there are transition zones, such as the Bugun/Aka/Hruso/Miji/Sherdukpen area, which form cultural &quot;buffers&quot; between the Tibetic Buddhist tribes and the Tani hill tribes. In addition, there are isolated peoples scattered throughout the state.

Within each of these cultural spheres, one finds populations of related tribes speaking related languages and sharing similar traditions. In the Tibetic area, one finds large numbers of Monpa tribespeople, with several subtribes speaking closely related but mutually incomprehensible languages, and also large numbers of Tibetans. Within the Tani area, major tribes include Nishi, which has recently come to be used by many people to encompass Bangni and even Hills Miri. Apatani also live among the Nishi, but are distinct. In the northern zone the Tagin presides as one of the major tribe extending up to the northeastern side of mechuka . In the centre, one finds predominantly Galo people, with the major sub-groups of Lare, Kargu-kardi and Pugo among others, extending to the Ramo and Pailibo areas (which are close in many ways to Galo). In the east, one finds the Adi, with many subtribes including Padam, Pasi, Minyong, and Bokar, among others. Milang, while also falling within the general &quot;Adi&quot; sphere, are in many ways quite distinct. Moving east, the Idu, Miju and Digaru make up the &quot;Mishmi&quot; cultural-linguistic area, which may or may not form a coherent historical grouping.

Moving southeast, the Tai Khamti are linguistically distinct from their neighbours and culturally distinct from the majority of other Arunachali tribes; they are religiously similar to the Chakmas who have migrated from erstwhile East Pakistan. They follow the same Theraveda sect of Buddhism. The Chakmas consist of the majority of the tribal population in Diyun Circleand are considered as minority ground in the state of mizoram, tripura and Myanmar. Districts of Lohit, Changlang and Papumpare have a considerable number of Chakmas. Assam also have a countable population of Chakmas who reside in the district of Karbi Anglong, and Dima Hasao district. They also exhibit considerable convergence with the Singpho and Tangsa tribes of the same area, all of which are also found in Burma. Finally, the Nocte and Wancho exhibit cultural and possibly also linguistic affinities to the tribes of Nagaland, which they border. There are also Indigenous Assamese people belonging to various indigenous Assamese communities in Arunachal Pradesh.

In addition, there are large numbers of migrants from diverse areas of India and Bangladesh, who, while legally not entitled to settle permanently, in practice stay indefinitely, progressively altering the traditional demographic makeup of the state. Finally, populations of &quot;Nepalis&quot; (in fact, usually Tibeto-Burman tribespeople whose tribes predominate in areas of Nepal, but who do not have tribal status in Arunachal Pradesh.) and Chakmas who are considered legal migrants are distributed in different areas of the state (although reliable figures are hard to come by).

==Literacy==
Literacy has risen in official figures to 66.95% in 2011 from 54.74% in 2001. The literate population is said to number 789,943. Number of literate males are 454,532 (73.69%) and number of literate females are 335,411 (59.57%).
==Religion==



*&quot;Others&quot; refers to indigenous religious traditions, such as Donyi-Polo (in the Tani area) or Rangfrah (further east). Tibetan Buddhism predominates in the districts of Tawang, West Kameng, and isolated regions adjacent to Tibet. Theravada Buddhism is practiced by groups living near the Burmese border like Changlang.

Out of the 101 recognized tribes, 37 have an animist majority (Nyishi, Adi, Galo, Tagin, Adi, Apatani, Bugun, etc.), 23 have a Christian majority (Wancho, Mossang Tangsa, Bori, Yobin, etc.), 15 have a Hindu majority (Mishmi, Mishing/Miri, Indigenous Assamese people, Nepali, Aka, Longchang Tangsa, etc.), and 17 have a Buddhist majority (Monpa, Khampti, Tawang Monpa, Momba, Singpho, Sherdukpen, Chakma, etc.). The remaining 8 tribes do not have a dominant religion (Nocte, Tangsa, Naga, etc.).

<doc id="1327803" wikidata="Q313827" url="?curid=1327803" title="Federal Government of Germany">
<text>The Federal Government ( (BReg) ) is the chief executive body of the Federal Republic of Germany and exercises executive power at the federal level. It consists of the Federal Chancellor and the Federal Ministers. The fundamentals of the government&#x27;s organisation, as well as the method of its election and appointment, along with the procedure for its dismissal, are set down in the sixth section (articles 62 to 69) of the German Basic Law (&quot;Grundgesetz&quot;).

The Chancellor and the other members of the government are allowed to be also members of the &quot;Bundestag&quot; (though they are not required to be).

An extended body is the Federal Cabinet (&quot;Bundeskabinett)&quot;, which includes the Federal Government (consisting of the Federal Chancellor and Federal Ministers), the Head of the Federal Chancellery and its Parliamentary State Secretary, the Head of the Office of the Federal President, the Head of the and the Personal Advisor to the Federal Chancellor. In addition, the word &quot;cabinet&quot; is commonly used to distinguish between previous and current Federal Governments. For example, the fourth federal government under Chancellor Angela Merkel was the Fourth Merkel cabinet ().

== Regulations ==
The Chancellor is elected by the federal parliament (&quot;Bundestag&quot;) on proposal of the President of Germany with a majority of all members of the &quot;Bundestag&quot; (&quot;Chancellor-majority&quot;). However, the &quot;Bundestag&quot; is free to disregard the President&#x27;s proposal (which has, never happened), in which case the parliament may within 14 days hold further ballots and try to elect another individual, which the parties in the &quot;Bundestag&quot; can now propose themselves, to the post with the same so called Chancellor-majority, whom the President is then obliged to appoint. If the &quot;Bundestag&quot; fails to do so, a last ballot will be held on the 15th day (again the parties in the &quot;Bundestag&quot; may field candidates): If an individual is elected with the Chancellor-majority, the President must appoint them as Chancellor. If not, the President is free to either appoint the individual, who received a plurality of votes on this last ballot, as Chancellor or to dissolve the &quot;Bundestag&quot; and call a snap election within 60 days.

Following their election in the &quot;Bundestag&quot;, the Chancellor-elect will visit Bellevue Palace, the residence of the President, to receive a certificate of appointment. This is the moment, the elected individual actually enters office. After this short appointment-ceremony, the Chancellor returns to the &quot;Bundestag&quot;, in order to take the oath of office. Having taken the oath, the Chancellor will once again visit Bellevue Palace, this time joined by the individuals the Chancellor intends to propose as members of the government. The President will officially appoint the new government members, again handing over certificates of appointment. After the ministers are appointed, they return to the &quot;Bundestag&quot; and take their oaths of office, completing the appointment-process.

In contrast to the system under the Weimar Republic, the &quot;Bundestag&quot; may only dismiss the Chancellor with a constructive vote of no confidence (electing a new Chancellor at the same time) and can thereby only choose to dismiss the Chancellor with their entire government and not simply individual ministers. These procedures and mechanisms were put in place to prevent election of a new Adolf Hitler and to ensure that there will not be a political vacuum left by the removal of Chancellor through a vote of confidence and the failure to elect a new one in their place, as had happened during the Weimar period with the &quot;Reichstag&quot; removing Chancellors but failing to agree on the election of a new one.

If the Chancellor loses a simple confidence motion (without the election of a new Chancellor by the &quot;Bundestag&quot;), this does not force them out of office, but allows the Chancellor, if they wish to do so, to ask the President of Germany for the dissolution of the &quot;Bundestag&quot;, triggering a snap election within 60 days (this happened in 1972, 1983, and 2005), or to ask the President to declare a legislative state of emergency, which allows the government to use a simplified legislative procedure, in which bills proposed by the government only need the consent of the &quot;Bundesrat&quot; (as yet, this has never been applied). The President is, however, not bound to follow the Chancellor&#x27;s request in both cases.

==Functioning==
The Chancellor is the chief executive leader. Therefore, the whole government&#x27;s tenure is linked to the Chancellor&#x27;s tenure: The Chancellor&#x27;s (and the government&#x27;s) term automatically ends, if a newly elected &quot;Bundestag&quot; sits for the first time, if they are replaced by a &quot;constructive vote of no confidence&quot;, or if the Chancellor resigns or dies. Nevertheless, apart from the case of a &quot;constructive vote of no confidence&quot;, which by nature instantly invests a new Chancellor (and a new government), the Chancellor and their ministers stay in office as an acting government on the President&#x27;s request, until the &quot;Bundestag&quot; has elected a new Chancellor. An acting government and its members have (theoretically) the same powers as an ordinary government, but the Chancellor may not ask the &quot;Bundestag&quot; for a motion of confidence or ask the President for the appointment of new ministers. If an acting minister leaves the government, another member of government has to take over their department.

The Chancellor is responsible for guiding the government and deciding its political direction (&#x27;). According to the principle of departmentalization (&#x27;), the government ministers are free to carry out their duties independently within the boundaries set by the Chancellor&#x27;s political directives. The Chancellor may at any time ask the President to dismiss a minister or to appoint a new minister; the President&#x27;s appointment is only a formality, he may not refuse a Chancellor&#x27;s request for dismissal or appointment of a minister. The Chancellor also decides the scope of each minister&#x27;s duties and can at his own discretion nominate ministers heading a department and so-called ministers for special affairs without an own department. A Chancellor can also lead a department; this is not usual, but it has occurred on three occasions with Konrad Adenauer and Willy Brandt also serving as Minister of Foreign Affairs, while Helmut Schmidt held the post of Minister of Defence.

The Chancellor&#x27;s freedom to shape his government is only limited by some constitutional provisions: The Chancellor has to appoint a Minister of Defence, a Minister of Economic Affairs and a Minister of Justice and is implicitly forbidden to head one of these departments himself, as the constitution invests these ministers with some special powers. For example, the Minister of Defence is commander-in-chief during peacetime (only in wartime does the Chancellor becomes supreme commander), the Minister of Economic Affairs may veto decisions by the Federal Cartel Office and the Minister of Justice appoints and dismisses the Public Prosecutor General. If two ministers disagree on a particular point, the government resolves the conflict by a majority vote (&quot;&quot; or principle of deference) or the Chancellor decides the case themselves. This often depends on the Chancellor&#x27;s governing style.

The Chancellor has to appoint one of the government ministers as Vice Chancellor, who may deputise for the Chancellor in their absence. In coalition governments the Vice Chancellor is usually the highest ranking minister of the second-biggest coalition party. If the Chancellor dies or is unwilling or unable to act as Chancellor after the end of their term, until a new Chancellor has been elected, the Vice Chancellor becomes Acting Chancellor until the election of a new Chancellor by the &quot;Bundestag&quot;, who then has to form a new government. (To date, this has happened once: On 7 May 1974 Chancellor Willy Brandt resigned and declared his refusal to act as Chancellor until his successor&#x27;s election. Vice Chancellor Walter Scheel was appointed as Acting Chancellor and served until the election of Helmut Schmidt on 16 May.)

The Chancellor is in charge of the government&#x27;s administrative affairs, which are usually delegated to the Head of staff of the Chancellery, who is usually also appointed as minister for special affairs. Details are laid down in the government&#x27;s rules for internal procedures (&quot;). These state, for example, that the government is quorate only if at least half of the ministers including the chair (the Chancellor or in their absence the Vice Chancellor) are present. The government regularly convenes on Wednesday mornings in the Chancellery.

According to article 26 of the Basic Law weapons intended for warfare may only be manufactured, transported and placed on the market with the approval of the Federal Government in order to secure international peace. This and security policy are the tasks of the (&quot;), a government committee chaired by the Chancellor. Pursuant to its (classified) rules of procedure, its sessions are confidential. According to practice, the Federal Government presents an annual report on arms exports, which contains statistical information on export permits issued and gives figures for the types of arms concerned as well as their destination. As a general rule, the Federal Government, if asked, is required to inform the &quot;Bundestag&quot; that the Federal Security Council has approved a given armaments export transaction or not.

<text>RCC Broadcasting Company (株式会社中国放送 &quot;Kabushiki-gaisha Chūgoku Hōsō&quot;; later name: RCC) is a Japanese broadcaster located in Hiroshima, Japan. It is an affiliate of JRN and NRN radio networks and JNN television network.

The station can be found at Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni in eastern Yamaguchi prefecture, near the border of the Hiroshima prefecture, in its free tier, without carrying the prefecture&#x27;s JNN affiliate.

== History ==

=== Early history ===
After the passage of the &quot;Three Radio Laws&quot; in 1950, plans to expand private broadcasting took place across Japan. Two companies, &quot;Hiroshima Heiwa Broadcasting&quot; and &quot;Radio Hiroshima&quot; applied for the establishment of private radio stations. Later on, the two companies merged upon recommendation by the Radio Supervisory Committee. On April 21, 1951, Hiroshima Broadcasting (the newly merged two companies) was granted a license and on February 25 the following year, they held the promoters&#x27; meeting and received funding from newspapers Asahi Shimbun and Mainichi Shimbun.

On August 8, 1952, after a general meeting of shareholders, Hiroshima Broadcasting was renamed to Radio Chugoku. Radio Chugoku started broadcasting on October 1, 1952, at 6:30 am operating for at least 16 hours and 30 minutes every day.

=== Expansion to TV broadcasting and further developments ===
In 1954, Radio Chugoku applied for a TV license, and received a preliminary TV license on October 22, 1957. On March 17, 1959, Radio Chugoku began TV broadcast trials. Radio Chugoku started TV broadcasts on April 1, 1959 Also in the same year, it joined the Japan News Network. 

During its early operations, the broadcaster didn&#x27;t have any professional TV studios which resulted its radio studio being multipurposed for TV broadcasts. It was then decided that a new headquarters will be built in Motomachi (which started on November 5, 1960), adjacent to the Hiroshima Castle. On October 19, 1960, Radio Chugoku started broadcasting on its newly built headquarters.

On March 20, 1966, Chugoku Radio and Television began TV broadcasting in color. On April 1 of the same year, it started uninterrupted TV broadcasts. The company was then renamed to Chugoku Broadcasting on April 1, 1967 to reflect its TV and radio operations.

Since the mid-60s, RCC produced documentaries with foreign productions. These include a documentary about Japanese immigrants in Hawaii in 1965 and about Hiroshima City and Volgograd becoming sister cities in 1968.

On April 15, 1970, NPB Opening Day, RCC aired the first color Hiroshima Toyo Carp local game broadcasts for its broadcast markets. Chugoku Broadcasting became an official broadcaster for airing highlights of the Hiroshima Flower Festival since it started in 1977. 

On October 1, 2006, RCC started digital broadcasting and ended analog broadcasts on July 24, 2011.

<text>[[Ice hockey]] at the [[2006 Winter Olympics]] was held at the Torino Palasport Olimpico and the Torino Esposizioni in Turin, Italy. The men&#x27;s competition, held from 15 to 26 February, was won by Sweden, and the women&#x27;s competition, held from 11 to 20 February, was won by Canada.

==Medal summary==
===Medal table===
===Medalists===
==Men&#x27;s competition==

The format was changed from the version used in the 1998 and 2002 tournaments. This format was used in 1992 and 1994, the number of teams was reduced from 14 to 12 and the preliminary and final group stages were combined to form two six-team groups with the top four from each group advancing to the quarterfinals.

These changes had the following effects:
* They increased the number of group games played by the &quot;Super Six&quot;, who previously automatically qualified for the final group stage, from three to five.
* They ensured that only four teams from each group would advance to the knock-out stage. This would give the games more meaning.

===Qualification===

Twelve places were allotted for the men&#x27;s ice hockey tournament. The first eight were awarded to the top eight teams in the International Ice Hockey Federation ranking following the 2004 Men&#x27;s World Ice Hockey Championships. Those teams were:

===Sweden throwing a game===
Allegations have surfaced of Sweden throwing a game against Slovakia so the Swedes would face Switzerland instead of Canada or the Czech Republic. Shortly before the game, Sweden coach Bengt-Åke Gustafsson was reported to have publicly contemplated tanking in order to avoid those teams, saying about Canada and the Czechs, &quot;One is cholera, the other the plague.&quot; During the game itself, one reportedly suspect sequence came when Sweden had an extended five-on-three powerplay with five NHL stars on the ice—Peter Forsberg, Mats Sundin, Daniel Alfredsson, Nicklas Lidström and Fredrik Modin—and failed to put a shot on net. Sports Illustrated writer Michael Farber would say about this particular powerplay, &quot;If the Swedes had passed the puck any more, their next opponent would have been the Washington Generals.&quot; &quot;[They] were even afraid to shoot!&quot;, Russian coach Vladimir Krikunov said.

As part of a subsequent interview about the championship over five years later, Forsberg was interpreted to insinuate that Sweden lost their preliminary round game against Slovakia on purpose, so as to draw Switzerland as their quarterfinal opponent, rather than Canada or the Czech Republic. Swedish forward Henrik Sedin, who played alongside Forsberg on the 2006 team denied the notion 

==Women&#x27;s competition==
===Qualification===

The top four teams from the International Ice Hockey Federation world rankings following the 2004 Women&#x27;s World Ice Hockey Championships qualified automatically. These teams were Canada, the United States, Finland and Sweden. Italy also gained a place as it was the host nation. Russia, Germany, and Switzerland qualified for the last three places through qualification tournaments.

<text>The Rail Band is a Malian band formed in 1970; it was later known as Super Rail Band, Bamako Rail Band or, most comprehensively and formally, Super Rail Band of the Buffet Hotel de la Gare, Bamako.

==Background==
Rail Band&#x27;s fame was built upon the mid-20th century craze for Latin — especially Cuban — jazz music which came out of Congo in the 1940s. The Rail Band was one of the first West African acts to combine this mature Afro-Latin sound with traditional instruments and styles. In their case, this was built upon the Mande Griot praise singer tradition, along with Bambara and other Malian and Guinean musical traditions. Their distinctive sound came from combining electric guitar and jazz horns with soaring Mandinka and Bamabara lyrical lines, African and western drums, and local instruments such as the kora and the balafon. At their height of fame in the 1970s, the Rail Band played to sold-out venues and even stadia across West Africa, and launched solo careers for many of its members, including Salif Keita.

==History==
The first incarnation of the Rail Band was founded in 1970, sponsored by the Ministry of Information and the railway administration. The Malian government had, since the &#x27;60s, been sponsoring cultural events and groups to promote national traditions, the Rail Band was among those programs. The band performed as the house band at the Buffet Bar of the Station Hotel in Bamako, from which it takes its name. Beginning as a Latin Jazz band in the style of Congolese Soukous, it soon began integrating local Manding musical styles and traditions, with vocals in the Bambara language. From early on the band featured electric guitar, electric organ, saxophone, horns, and a western drum kit alongside Mande music using kora, balafon, ngoni, talking drums, Islamic-style, Mande hunter co-fraternity song, and griot praise-singing vocals.

==Members==
The Rail Band&#x27;s lead singer in the 1970s was Salif Keita, who left the band to join the rival Super Ambassadeurs, and then follow a successful solo career in 1982.

The group soon became a training ground for many of Mali&#x27;s most popular performers, such as singer Mory Kanté and guitarist Kante Manfila. Guitarist Djelimady Tounkara has been a member of the band for most of its history. The band, changing personnel many times, continues to perform around the world.

In May 2020, Kanté died from chronic illness.

==Recognition==
According to the Timbuktu Renaissance initiative, Super Biton is one of &quot;two bands in particular [that] have left an indelible mark on the Malian musical landscape&quot;, the other being Rail Band, both &quot;pioneers of the fusion of the traditional sounds and rhythms of Ségou and modern genres.

<text>Kevin Ceballo (born October 12, 1977) is a salsa music singer of Puerto Rican descent.

==Early life and education==
Ceballo&#x27;s parents moved from Puerto Rico and settled in Manhattan where Ceballo was born. They were Seventh-Day Adventists and as such Ceballo was exposed to and enjoyed the gospel singing at his House of Worship. In his household &quot;salsa&quot; and other types of popular music were considered taboo, this however did not keep young Ceballo from listening to Latin music, which he secretly enjoyed, behind his parents back. During his teen years he came more and more into contact with the music he would grow to love.

Ceballo attended the famed High School of the Performing Arts in New York. There he dreamed of pursuing a career in singing and acting. At times when he was not in school, Ceballo would sing as back-up for any local salsa group that would require his services.

==Singing debut==
In 1997, Ceballo caught the attention of pianist Isidro Infante, while singing at a local night club. Infante was impressed with Kevin and asked him if he would like to join his group as one of the lead singers. He took Infante up on his offer and soon was featured in the CD recording &quot;&quot;Licencia Para Engañar&quot; (License to Deceive), which was released in 1998. The CD included &quot;Cuando Pienso en Tí&quot;&quot; (When I think of You), composed by Ceballo. He traveled all over the world with Infantes band.

La India, a Puerto Rican salsa singer, asked Ceballo to sing back-up for her CD &quot;Sobre el Fuego&quot; (On the Fire), which was nominated for a Grammy Award.

==Solo debut==

The year 2000, was the year that Ceballo made his debut as a solo singer, when he recorded his CD &quot;&#x27;Mi Primer Amor&quot; (My First Love). The CD also featured two other compositions by him, &quot;Que Clase de Hombre&quot; (What kind of Man) and &quot;Quiero Bailar&quot;&quot; (I want to Dance). His CD became a number one hit in the Latin music charts. Ceballo was named &quot;New Artist of the Year&#x27;. Besides singing with La India, Ceballo had also performed with Celia Cruz, Tito Puente and Eddie Palmieri.

On October 20, 2002, Ceballo headlined a free concert at the Verizon Music Festival held in Washington, D.C., with the participation of the late Celia Cruz. On April 11, 2003, Ceballo played with Jimmy Bosch at the Copacabana Nightclub in New York. That year he also recorded &quot;Yo Soy Ese Hombre&quot; (I&#x27;m that Man) which was produced by Infante. The album included &quot;Eternamente Te Amaré&quot;, a salsa interpretation of the Angela Via and Frankie Negrón duet recorded in 2000. On June 26, 2004, Ceballo performed as the headliner in the &quot;Latino Fest&quot; celebrated at Patterson Park in Baltimore, Maryland.

<text>Banda Aceh (; , Jawi: ) is the capital and largest city in the province of Aceh, Indonesia. It is located on the island of Sumatra and has an elevation of 35 metres. The city covers an area of and had a population of 223,446 people at the 2010 Census, rising to 252,899 at the 2020 Census. The official estimate as at mid 2023 was 259,538.

Banda Aceh is located on the northwestern tip of Indonesia at the mouth of the Aceh River. Banda Aceh itself is a semi-enclave within Aceh Besar Regency, as Banda Aceh is surrounded by Aceh Besar to the south, east, and west, while it borders with the Strait of Malacca to the north. Many suburbs of the city have developed in adjacent districts of Acah Besar Regency beyond the city limits, notably to the south in Darul Imarah, Ingin Jaya and Krueng Barona Jaya Districts of the regency, forming part of the built-up area.

The city was originally established as Bandar Aceh Darussalam Kandang and served as a capital and hub for the Sultanate of Aceh upon its foundation in the late 15th century. Later its name was changed to &quot;Bandar Aceh Darussalam&quot;, and then it became popularly known as &quot;Banda Aceh&quot;. The first part of the name comes from the Persian () meaning &quot;port&quot; or &quot;haven&quot;. The city is also dubbed the &quot;port to Mecca,&quot; or the &quot;porch of Mecca&quot; () in reference to the days when hajj pilgrims travelled by sea from Indonesia and would make a stopover in the city before continuing their journey to Mecca.

Banda Aceh was long at the center of protracted conflicts between the Acehnese and foreign powers, including the Portuguese, the Dutch, the Japanese, and the Indonesian government. The city rose to international prominence in the aftermath of the Indian Ocean earthquake on 26 December 2004, which struck off the western coast of Sumatra. Banda Aceh was the closest major city to the earthquake&#x27;s epicenter, which lay off the coast. It suffered great damage in the earthquake and further damage when a tsunami struck shortly afterwards. Around 60,000 people in the city died as a result and many more were injured.

The aftermath of the tsunami has seen a cessation of much of the conflict in the city and province, and domestic and international aid, as a result, has seen a major modernization and reconstruction of the city over the past decade.

== History ==
Banda Aceh, situated at the tip of Sumatra, has long been a strategic, transportation and trading hub in the eastern Indian Ocean. Its first mention in western accounts comes from 1292 when Marco Polo and his expedition visited the city, referred to as &#x27;Lambri&#x27; from Lamuri Kingdom which previously existed there and noted as the logical first port of call for travellers from Arabia and India to Indonesia. Ibn Battuta also reported visiting the city in the mid-14th century when under the control of the trading kingdom of Samudera Pasai, the then-dominant entity in northern Sumatra. However the Pasai began to collapse under pressure from declining economic conditions and the Portuguese, who occupied much of the area after occupying Malacca in the early 16th century. Sultan Ali Mughayat Syah, ruler of the newly founded Sultanate of Aceh, aggressively expanded in the area in the 1520s and established sultanate was built on the remains of the Pasai and other extinct kingdoms in the area, and made Banda Aceh the capital, naming it for himself as &quot;Kutaraja &quot;or &#x27;City of the King&#x27;.

After a long period of rule by the sultanate, Aceh began to come into conflict with the Dutch and the British in the second half of the 18th century. At the end of the 18th century, the territory of Aceh in the Malay Peninsula, namely Kedah and Pulau Pinang, were seized by the British. In 1871, the Dutch began to threaten Aceh, and on 26 March 1873, the Dutch formally declared war on Aceh. The Dutch bombarded the capital in that year and sought to capture the sultan&#x27;s palace in the city to bring about a capitulation of the Acehnese. Significant support from the British in the region led the modernization and fortification of the city, and while coastal areas were lost the Dutch underestimated the city&#x27;s defenses. The Dutch expedition commander General Johan Köhler was killed in a skirmish around the city, leading to the failure of the first expedition. A second expedition was mounted by the Dutch within months and was successful in overwhelming the city. The Dutch moved into the capital in January 1874 believing the Acehnese to have surrendered; however, the conflict moved into the countryside, and the Acehnese continued to actively oppose Dutch rule. 

After it entered the Government of the Republic of Indonesia on 28 December 1962, the name of the city was changed back to Banda Aceh by the Ministry of Public Administration and Regional Autonomy on 9 May 1963. On 26 December 2004, the city was hit by a tsunami caused by a 9.2-magnitude earthquake in the Indian Ocean. The disaster killed 167,000 inhabitants and destroyed more than 60% of the city&#x27;s buildings. Based on the statistical data issued by the City Government of Banda Aceh, Banda Aceh had 248,727 inhabitants in May 2012, while the Indonesian national census of 2020 showed a population of 252,899. The official estimate as of mid-2023 was 259,538.

On 27 December 2023, hundreds of students from various universities in Aceh, such as: Abulyatama University, Bina Bangsa Getsempena University, and University of Muhammadiyah Aceh, stormed a shelter for Rohingya refugees and forced them out of a convention centre in the city of Banda Aceh, demanding they be deported. The students also seen kicking the belongings of the Rohingya men, women, and children who seated on the floor and crying in fear. They burned tyres and chanting “Kick them out” and “Reject Rohingya in Aceh”.

<text>The Hidden Words (, , ) is a book written by Baháʼu&#x27;lláh, the founder of the Baháʼí Faith, around 1858. He composed it while walking along the banks of the Tigris river during his exile in Baghdad. The book is written partly in Arabic and partly in Persian.

&quot;The Hidden Words&quot; is written in the form of a collection of 153 short aphorisms, 71 in Arabic and 82 in Persian, in which Baháʼu&#x27;lláh says he has taken the basic essence of certain spiritual truths and written them in brief form. ʻAbdu&#x27;l-Bahá, Baháʼu&#x27;lláh&#x27;s son and the authorized interpreter of his teachings, advised Baháʼís to read them every day and every night and to implement their latent wisdom into their daily lives. He also said that &quot;The Hidden Words&quot; is &quot;a treasury of divine mysteries&quot; and that when one ponders its contents, &quot;the doors of the mysteries will open&quot;.

== History ==
There is a Shiʻa Muslim tradition called &quot;Mushaf of Fatimah&quot; (), which speaks of Fatimah upon the passing of her father, Muhammad. There are several versions of this tradition, but common to all are that the angel Gabriel appeared to her and consoled her by telling her things that she wrote in a book. According to one tradition they were prophesies. The book, if ever physical, did not survive, and was seen to be something that the Mahdi would reveal in the last days.

Baháʼís believe that &quot;The Hidden Words&quot; was revealed by Baháʼu&#x27;lláh in fulfillment of this tradition. Baháʼu&#x27;lláh originally named the book &quot;The Book of Fatimah&quot; (), though he later referred to it in its modern appellation. This aspect of fulfillment corresponds with the Baháʼí beliefs that end times prophesies of all the world&#x27;s religions are to be interpreted mystically and metaphorically. This puts the Baháʼí understanding of what Gabriel revealed to Fatimah somewhat at odds with the Shiʻa traditions.

According to Jonah Winters, there have been more translations of &quot;The Hidden Words&quot; than of any other Bahá&#x27;í text. It was first translated in 1894, meaning it was one of the first books of Bahá&#x27;í scripture to be translated into English. The current official translation by Shoghi Effendi was the result of a process of drafts beginning in 1923 and ending with a final revision in 1954.

== Text ==
The text of &quot;The Hidden Words&quot; has 153 passages divided into two sections: one in Arabic and the other in Persian. Each consists of a series of short, numbered passages. The Arabic has 71 passages and the Persian has 82.

Each passage begins with an invocation, many of which repeat. Some common invocations include &quot;O Son of Spirit&quot;, &quot;O Son of Man&quot;, and &quot;O Son of Being&quot;. Baháʼí prayers are written in the first person of humanity, so that the reader can feel like they are having a conversation with God. &quot;The Hidden Words&quot; are written in the first person of God, so that the reader feels like God is speaking to them.

=== Introduction ===
From the Arabic, the following is the introduction written by Baháʼu&#x27;lláh:

:&quot;HE IS THE GLORY OF GLORIES 
:This is that which hath descended from the realm of glory, uttered by the tongue of power and might, and revealed unto the Prophets of old. We have taken the inner essence thereof and clothed it in the garment of brevity, as a token of grace unto the righteous, that they may stand faithful unto the Covenant of God, may fulfill in their lives His trust, and in the realm of spirit obtain the gem of Divine virtue.&quot;

=== Samples ===
From the Arabic

:1. &quot;O SON OF SPIRIT!
:My first counsel is this: Possess a pure, kindly and radiant heart, that thine may be a sovereignty ancient, imperishable and everlasting.

:7. &quot;O SON OF MAN!
:If thou lovest Me, turn away from thyself; and if thou seekest My pleasure, regard not thine own; that thou mayest die in Me and I may eternally live in thee.&quot;

:49. &quot;O SON OF MAN!
:The true lover yearneth for tribulation even as doth the rebel for forgiveness and the sinful for mercy.&quot;

From the Persian
:3. &quot;O FRIEND!
:In the garden of thy heart plant naught but the rose of love, and from the nightingale of affection and desire loosen not thy hold. Treasure the companionship of the righteous and eschew all fellowship with the ungodly.&quot;

:12. &quot;O MAN OF TWO VISIONS!
:Close one eye and open the other. Close one to the world and all that is therein, and open the other to the hallowed beauty of the Beloved.&quot;

:27. &quot;O SON OF DUST!
:All that is in heaven and earth I have ordained for thee, except the human heart, which I have made the habitation of My beauty and glory; yet thou didst give My home and dwelling to another than Me; and whenever the manifestation of My holiness sought His own abode, a stranger found He there, and, homeless, hastened unto the sanctuary of the Beloved. Notwithstanding I have concealed thy secret and desired not thy shame.&quot;

=== Ending ===
After the last passage, Baháʼu&#x27;lláh wrote:
:&quot;The mystic and wondrous Bride, hidden ere this beneath the veiling of utterance, hath now, by the grace of God and His divine favor, been made manifest even as the resplendent light shed by the beauty of the Beloved. I bear witness, O friends! that the favor is complete, the argument fulfilled, the proof manifest and the evidence established. Let it now be seen what your endeavors in the path of detachment will reveal. In this wise hath the divine favor been fully vouchsafed unto you and unto them that are in heaven and on earth. All praise to God, the Lord of all Worlds.&quot;

<doc id="1327843" wikidata="Q5591214" url="?curid=1327843" title="Grace Holloway">
<text>Dr. Grace Holloway is a fictional character played by Daphne Ashbrook in the 1996 television film &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, a continuation of the long-running British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. A cardiologist from San Francisco in 1999, she assists the Eighth Doctor in defeating the renegade Time Lord, the Master.

==Character history==

When the Seventh Doctor lands on December 30, 1999 in San Francisco, he is gunned down by a gang on the streets of Chinatown. Unaware of his alien physiology, Grace accidentally kills him when she attempts to operate. He subsequently regenerates into his eighth incarnation, and involves Grace in his fight to prevent the Master from opening the Eye of Harmony and destroying the Earth at the stroke of midnight on New Year&#x27;s Day, 2000. At the end, the Doctor offers to take Grace along with him in the TARDIS, but Grace declines, preferring to stay behind and apply the lessons she has learned from him.

Grace is described by the Doctor as &quot;tired of life but afraid of dying.&quot; She is a warm and compassionate person who was disillusioned early in life when she realized that she could not hold back death. As a result, she puts on a cold, aloof front in an effort to protect herself from her feelings and to mask her own insecurity. She realizes this over the course of her adventure with the Doctor and learns to feel hope again, placing it in the form of the Doctor, an alien who can literally come back to life, as well as regaining confidence in herself as a medical practitioner and as a person. She also rapidly develops a romantic attachment to the Doctor, stating at one point, &quot;I finally meet the right guy and he&#x27;s from another planet.&quot;

==Other appearances==
Grace&#x27;s life after her encounter with the Doctor is not explored on-screen beyond the television movie, although the Doctor does have to deal with the after effects of those events in the spin-off Eighth Doctor Adventures novel &quot;Unnatural History&quot;, by Kate Orman and Jonathan Blum.

Grace appears in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; comic strip story &quot;The Fallen&quot;, published in &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; #273-#276, where she conducts experiments to merge human and Time Lord DNA, the latter obtained from tissue left behind by the Master. However, the Master is not in his Time Lord body, but that of a shape-shifting creature known as a morphant. The resulting hybrid begins to consume people, but is stopped with the Eighth Doctor&#x27;s help. Grace promises the Doctor she will destroy all the remaining morphant DNA samples, and the two part ways once more. She subsequently appears as a dream image in &quot;The Glorious Dead&quot; (&quot;DWM&quot; #287-#296) and makes a one-panel cameo in the last regular Eighth Doctor comic strip adventure, &quot;The Flood&quot; (&quot;DWM&quot; #353). In Prisoners of Time, a series to celebrate the 50th anniversary, the Doctor meets her soon after the events of the TV Movie. She travels with him for a while but is overwhelmed by what she sees. Before the Doctor can return her to Earth, she is kidnapped by Adam Mitchell, who is travelling through time to kidnap the Doctor&#x27;s companions.

Daphne Ashbrook performed in the Big Finish Productions audio play &quot;The Next Life&quot; opposite Paul McGann as the Eighth Doctor, but playing a different character named Perfection.

In the novelization of the &quot;Sarah Jane Adventures&quot; episode &quot;Death of the Doctor&quot;, Sarah Jane lists the current whereabouts of several of the Doctor&#x27;s former companions, including a &quot;Doctor Holloway&quot; who is looking into new breakthroughs in surgery in San Francisco.

==Legal issues==
Originally, Grace Holloway was to appear in the second Eighth Doctor novel, &quot;Vampire Science&quot;, but legal issues with the BBC and Universal prevented this from happening. According to Big Finish, their audioplays cannot use TV-movie characters Grace Holloway or Chang Lee due to Universal&#x27;s ownership of the characters. Grace&#x27;s appearance in the comics appears to have been separately negotiated.

<doc id="1327851" wikidata="Q2979581" url="?curid=1327851" title="Clopas">
<text>Clopas (, &quot;Klōpas&quot;; Hebrew: possibly , &quot;Ḥalfi&quot;; Aramaic: חילפאי, &quot;Ḥilfài&quot;) is a figure of early Christianity. The name appears in the New Testament, specifically in John :

He is often identified with another figure of a similar name, Cleophas (), one of the two disciples who met Christ during the road to Emmaus appearance (). 
There is some variation of the Greek manuscripts of both John 19:25 and Luke 24 as to the spelling , and the John &quot;Clopas&quot; is rendered &quot;Cleophas&quot; in the KJV.

==Parallel passages==
The identity of the other women in the parallel passages in Matthew 27:56 and is given as Mary Magdalene, &quot;Mary the mother of James and Joses,&quot; and &quot;Salome the mother of Zebedee&#x27;s children&quot; (Matthew), &quot;Salome&quot; (Mark). Luke does not mention the women watching near the cross. The parallels continue again with accounts of the burial. Matthew 28:1 has &quot;Mary Magdalene and the other Mary&quot; with no mention of John&#x27;s mother Salome, Mark 16:1 has again Mary Magdalene, &quot;Mary the mother of James&quot; and Salome. Luke says &quot;they,&quot; John mentions only Mary Magdalene.

As a result of these parallels commentators have identified &quot;Mary of Clopas&quot; with Mary mother of James, son of Alphaeus. Alphaeus (Greek ) was also the name of the father of Matthew the Apostle (Mark 2:14). The Aramaic name Hilfai (חילפאי), or Hebrew name Halfi () have been proposed by a variety of sources including Joseph Henry Thayer who argued in his Lexicon that dropping the Hebrew &quot;heth&quot; ( &quot;ḥ&quot;, which has no corresponding letter in Greek) and rendering the Hebrew &quot;heth&quot; as kappa (Κ) in Greek were both possible. Perhaps under the influence of this tradition, Franz Delitzsch&#x27;s modern Hebrew New Testament does in fact use the Hebrew name &quot;Yaakov ben Khalfi&quot; () for James son of Alphaeus. The Aramaic name Halfai is evidenced on Aramaic panels of the period, and the name Hilphai in rabbinic literature.

==Interpretations==
In the Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew, which was probably written in the seventh century, states that Mary of Cleophas was daughter of Cleophas and Anna:

The most common interpretation is that &quot;of Clopas&quot; indicates the husband of this Mary and subsequently the father of her children, but some see &quot;of Clopas&quot; as meaning this Mary&#x27;s father. In medieval tradition Clopas is the second husband of Saint Anne and the &quot;father&quot; of &quot;Mary of Clopas&quot;.

Catholic and Eastern Orthodox traditions believed that Clopas is a brother of Saint Joseph, and that he is the same person with Cleopas.

==Early Christian writings==
Clopas also appears in early Christian writings such as the 2nd century writers Papias and Hegesippus as a brother of Joseph, the husband of Mary, mother of Jesus, and as the father of Simeon, the second bishop of Jerusalem. Eusebius of Caesarea relates in his Church History (Book III, ch. 11), that after the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD, the Christians of Jerusalem

:&quot;all with one consent pronounced Symeon, the son of Clopas, of whom the Gospel also makes mention; to be worthy of the episcopal throne of that parish. He was a cousin, as they say, of the Saviour. For Hegesippus records that Clopas was a brother of Joseph.&quot;

==James Tabor==
A few modern writers identify Mary of Clopas with Jesus&#x27; mother, such as James Tabor who has postulated that Clopas, whom he accepts as a brother of Joseph, became the second husband of Jesus&#x27; mother. Tabor argues that Clopas married Mary according to the Levirate law, which however would only apply in case of a childless widow - though this view is not widely accepted.

<doc id="1327852" wikidata="Q1542853" url="?curid=1327852" title="Alphaeus">
<text>Alphaeus (; ) is a man mentioned in the New Testament seemingly as the father of two of the Twelve Apostles: Matthew the Evangelist and James, son of Alphaeus. However, Mark 2:14 in Codex Bezae uses the name Levi rather than Matthew. It is therefore highly probable that the Alphaeus in &quot;James son of Alphaeus&quot; and &quot;Levi son of Alphaeus&quot; are the same person.

He is implied to be the father of Joseph or Joses, and in Church tradition he is the father of Abercius and Helena.

==Identity==
===Identification with Matthew and James the Less===
Usually, in the Western Catholic tradition, there are believed to be two men named Alphaeus. One of them was the father of the apostle James and the other the father of Matthew (Levi). Though both Matthew and James are described as being the &quot;son of Alphaeus,&quot; there is no Biblical account of the two being called brothers, even in the same context where John and James or Peter and Andrew are described as being brothers. Despite this, Eastern Church tradition typically states that Matthew and James were brothers. The apocryphal Gospel of Peter also refers to Levi as the son of Alphaeus.

===Identification with Clopas===
In the Middle Ages, Alphaeus was said to be the husband of Mary the daughter of Clopas. More recently, Alphaeus has been identified with Clopas, based on the identification from parallel Gospel accounts of Mary, the mother of James the third woman with Mary Magdalene and Salome, wife of Zebedee beside the cross in Matthew with Mary of Clopas, the third woman in John&#x27;s account. Post-medieval scholars and translators often take the name &#x27;Mary of Clopas&#x27; to mean Mary was the wife of Clopas, not his daughter. Mary is called the wife of Cleophas in the King James Version.

According to the surviving fragments of the work &quot;Exposition of the Sayings of the Lord&quot; of the Apostolic Father Papias of Hierapolis, who lived c. 70–163 AD, Cleophas and Alphaeus are the same person: &quot;Mary the wife of Cleophas or Alphaeus, who was the mother of James the bishop and apostle, and of Simon and Thaddeus, and of one Joseph&quot; According to the Anglican theologian J.B. Lightfoot this fragment quoted above is spurious.

The &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; suggests that etymologically, the names &quot;Clopas&quot; and &quot;Alphaeus&quot; are different, but that they could still be the same person. Other sources propose that &quot;Alphaeus&quot;, &quot;Clophas&quot; and &quot;Cleophas&quot; are variant attempts to render the Aramaic &quot;H&quot; in Aramaic Hilfai into Greek as aspirated, or &quot;K&quot;.

<text>Century Rain is a 2004 noir science fiction alternative history mystery novel by Welsh author Alastair Reynolds ().

== Plot summary ==
Wendell Floyd is an expatriate American living in an alternative version of 1950s Paris. In this world, the Nazi invasion of France failed, and Hitler was deposed by the German High Command. Without World War II, technology in this world has stagnated at 1930s levels, and Fascist political parties have gained power in France.
Floyd is a part-time jazz musician whose career has stalled since his ex-girlfriend, Greta, left Paris to pursue a musical career touring with another jazz band. He and his band-mate André Custine earn a supplemental income working as private detectives. When the novel opens, Floyd and Custine are hired by a concerned landlord to investigate the death of one of his tenants. Blanchard, the landlord, is certain that the death of Susan White, which the Parisian police have written off as an accident, is murder. Floyd is not so certain, but he&#x27;s willing to investigate.

In a scene seemingly from another novel, Verity Auger finds herself responsible when her archaeology dig beneath the frozen ruins of some far-flung future Paris results in the death of one of her students. During her trial she is caught up in political infighting, and maneuvered into accepting a high risk assignment, without knowing what it entails.

But when she is summoned on a mission to Mars by the top-secret security agency Contingencies, Auger is more than relieved to be exempt from her tribunal and the years of prison that she would otherwise have to face. However, when she is taken to a secret underground base on the Martian moon Phobos containing an ancient alien relic that opens a portal to a distant part of the galaxy, and told that she is to go through it, she begins to have second thoughts about continuing with her mission. Things get even more bizarre when she finds out that at the other end of the portal is an alternative-history version of Earth in the year 1959 – almost 300 years behind her present-day – and that she is to retrieve a tin of documents that was left behind by Susan White, an earlier agent sent to &quot;Earth Two&quot;, who died under mysterious circumstances.

<text>Edmund Thornton Jenkins (1894–1926) was an American composer who spent much of his life in Europe.

==Biography==
===Charleston===
Jenkins was born in Charleston, South Carolina where his Baptist-minister father, Reverend Daniel Joseph Jenkins, had set up and run the Jenkins Orphanage, which became internationally well-known for its wind band. Edmund Jenkins studied clarinet, piano and violin at the Atlanta Baptist College (now Morehouse College), and played in and directed the Jenkins Orphanage Band.

===London===
In 1914 the orphanage band travelled to England to perform at the Anglo-American Exposition in London. Edmund remained in London where, aged 20, he enrolled at the Royal Academy of Music (RAM) to study clarinet, piano, singing and composition. At the RAM he was awarded an orchestral scholarship (1915–17), prizes for singing, clarinet and piano playing, the Charles Lucas prize for composition (1918), Battison Haynes prize for composition (1918) and the Ross Scholarship (1919–21). On leaving the RAM he was made an Associate of the Royal Academy of Music. While in London Edmund Jenkins worked as an orchestral musician in theatre orchestras and dance bands resulting in his participation in a number of recordings.

===Paris===
In 1924 Edmund Jenkins moved to Paris where he established the Anglo-Continental-American Music Press while also performing and composing. He died in Paris &#x27;from causes unknown&#x27; after being admitted to the city&#x27;s Tenon hospital.

<doc id="1327869" wikidata="Q3080301" url="?curid=1327869" title="Segond fracture">
<text>The Segond fracture is a type of avulsion fracture (soft tissue structures pulling off fragments of their bony attachment) from the lateral tibial plateau of the knee, immediately below the articular surface of the tibia (see photo).

==Clinical significance==

Because of the high rate of associated ligamentous and meniscal injury, the presence of a Segond or reverse Segond fracture requires that these other pathologies must be specifically ruled out. Or more pragmatically, the orthopaedic team assume that the presence of Segond fracture equals ACL rupture, as the correlation is close to 100%. Increasingly, reconstruction of the ACL is combined with reconstruction of the anterolateral ligament when this associated pathology is present. The long-term benefit of an associated Anterolateral Ligament (ALL) reconstruction at the time of ACL surgery is not known. Attention and research is also being paid to a Lateral extra-articular Tenodesis (LET) instead of ALL.

==Diagnosis==
Segond and reverse Segond fractures are characterized by a small avulsion, or &quot;chip&quot;, fragment of characteristic size that is best seen on plain radiography in the anterior-posterior plane. The avulsed fragment of bone may be very difficult to see on the plain x-ray exam, and may be better seen on computed tomography. MRI may be useful for visualization of the associated bone marrow edema of the underlying tibial plateau on fat-saturated T2W and STIR images, as well as the associated findings of ligamentous and/or meniscal injury.

==History==
Originally described by Dr. Paul Segond in 1879 after a series of cadaveric experiments, the Segond fracture occurs in association with tears of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) (75–100%) and injury to the medial meniscus (66–75%), lateral capsular ligament (now known as the Anterolateral ligament, or ALL), as well as injury to the structures behind the knee.

A rare, mirror image of the Segond fracture has also been described. The so-called &quot;reverse Segond fracture&quot; can occur after an avulsion fracture of the tibial component of the medial collateral ligament (MCL) in association with posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) and medial meniscal tears.

Segond fracture is typically the result of abnormal varus, or &quot;bowing&quot;, stress to the knee, combined with internal rotation of the tibia. Reverse Segond fracture, as its name suggests, is caused by abnormal valgus, or &quot;knock-knee&quot;, stress and external rotation.

Originally thought to be a result of avulsion of the medial third of the lateral collateral ligament, the Segond fracture has been shown by more recent research to relate also to the insertion of the iliotibial tract (ITT) and the anterior oblique band (AOB), a ligamentous attachment of the fibular collateral ligament (FCL), to the midportion of the lateral tibia and to be associated with avulsion by the anterolateral ligament (ALL).

<text>The Dance of the Seven Veils is the dance performed by Salome before King Herod Antipas in modern stage, literature, and visual arts. It is an elaboration on the New Testament story of the Feast of Herod and the execution of John the Baptist, which refers to Salome dancing before the king, but does not give the dance a name.

The name &quot;Dance of the Seven Veils&quot; was chiefly popularized in modern culture with the 1894 English translation of Oscar Wilde&#x27;s 1893 French play &quot;Salome&quot; in the stage direction &quot;Salome dances the dance of the seven veils&quot;. The dance was also incorporated into Richard Strauss&#x27;s 1905 opera &quot;Salome&quot;.

==Biblical account==
According to ten verses of Matthew 14, John was imprisoned for criticizing King Herod Antipas&#x27;s marriage to Herodias, the former wife of Antipas&#x27;s half-brother Herod II. Herod offered his unnamed niece a reward of her choice for performing a dance for his guests on his birthday. Herodias persuaded her daughter to ask for John the Baptist&#x27;s head on a platter. Against his better judgment, Herod reluctantly acceded to her request.

A similar account is recorded in Mark 6.

==Josephus==
The Romano-Jewish historian Josephus lists Antipas&#x27;s stepdaughter&#x27;s name as Salome, but makes no mention of a dance nor makes any connection between Salome and John the Baptist.

==Oscar Wilde==

The idea that Salome&#x27;s dance involves &quot;seven veils&quot; originates with Wilde&#x27;s 1891 play &quot;Salomé&quot;. Wilde was influenced by earlier French writers who had transformed the image of Salome into an incarnation of female lust. Rachel Shteir writes that,

Wilde was especially influenced by Gustave Flaubert&#x27;s story &quot;Herodias&quot; in which Salome dances on her hands to please Antipas. The type of dance was common among &quot;gypsy&quot; acrobats in the 19th century. Wilde at first intended to follow Flaubert&#x27;s version, but changed his mind. Shireen Malik says he may have been influenced by the 1870 poem &quot;The Daughter of Herodias&quot; by Arthur O&#x27;Shaughnessy which describes Salome dancing:

&lt;poem&gt;
She freed and floated on the air her arms
Above dim veils that hid her bosom&#x27;s charms...
The veils fell round her like thin coiling mists
Shot through by topaz suns and amethysts.
&lt;/poem&gt;

The poem goes on to describe brief views of her &quot;jewelled body&quot; as the flowing veils swirl and part.

Wilde transforms the dance from a public performance for his guests, as in the Bible, to a personal dance for the king himself. He gives no description of the dance beyond the name, but the idea of a series of veils has been connected to a process of unveiling. As Malik says, &quot;although Wilde does not describe Salome&#x27;s dance or suggest that she remove any veils, her dance is invariably assumed to be one of unveiling, thus revealing herself.&quot; Wilde&#x27;s play has even been proposed as the origin of striptease. Toni Bentley writes &quot;Wilde&#x27;s bracketed brevity allowed for a world of interpretation. Can the invention of striptease be traced to a single innocuous stage direction in a censored play that could barely find a theater or audience? Can Oscar Wilde be considered the unlikely father of modern striptease?&quot;

In one of Aubrey Beardsley&#x27;s illustrations to the play, he depicts what he calls a &quot;stomach dance&quot; (i.e., a belly dance), in which Salome is depicted with exposed breasts and undulating belly, wearing transparent pantaloons. Wilde wrote a note in appreciation of Beardsley&#x27;s design, saying: &quot;For Aubrey: for the only artist who, besides myself, knows what the dance of the seven veils is, and can see that invisible dance.&quot; The concept of &quot;belly dancing&quot; had become widely known in 1893, the year before Beardsley created his designs, when it was featured at the World&#x27;s Fair in Chicago that year.

===Origin of the &quot;veil&quot; dance===

Bentley notes that the Mesopotamian goddess Inanna &quot;performed the first documented striptease&quot; when she descended into the &quot;Kur&quot; (underworld), ruled by her sister Ereshkigal, in search of her faithless lover Dumuzid. Inanna had to divest herself of the mysterious &quot;seven &quot;mé&quot;&quot; (conjecturally, her various jewels and robes) in her descent through seven successive gates leading ever deeper into the underworld until at last she stood naked in the &#x27;land of no return.&#x27; Oscar Wilde assigned this symbolic descent to the underworld of the unconscious, a ceremony that equates stripping naked to being in a state of truth, the ultimate unveiling, to Salome.&quot; Writing from a Jungian perspective, Perera has demonstrated the same for the far older Sumerian myth of the descent of Inanna. Wilde may have learned of the descent of the goddess by his acquaintance with Oxford professor Archibald Sayce, who lectured and published an English translation of this text.

Wilde&#x27;s concept of &quot;seven veils&quot; is believed to be derived from the popularity of what were known as &quot;veil dances&quot; at the time. These were westernised versions of imagined Middle Eastern styles of dance. The dancer Loïe Fuller was especially associated with such dances. In 1886, Fuller appeared at New York&#x27;s Standard Theatre in a show called &quot;The Arabian Nights&quot;. According to Rhonda Garelick, this &quot;featured fourteen different Oriental dance numbers, including the &#x27;Veil of Vapor&#x27; dance, done with clouds of steam instead of fabric veils.&quot;

The Hebrew word makhól (מָחוֹל), meaning to twist or whirl (in a circular or spiral manner), is used in Judges 21:21-23, Judges 11:34, and I Samuel 18:6-7. In these instances it refers to a type of erotic dance done during biblical ceremonies, and performed by women. Most notably, in Canaan before 900 BC, a small piece of cloth worn around the hips (ḥagor), would have been all that was worn.

==Richard Strauss==
Strauss&#x27;s operatic adaptation of the play also features the Dance of the Seven Veils. The dance remains unnamed except in the acting notes, but Salome&#x27;s sexual fascination with John seems to motivate the request—though Herod is portrayed as pleased. The music for the dance comes from near the climax of the opera. The visual content of that scene (about seven minutes long with standard tempi) has varied greatly depending on the aesthetic notions of the stage director, choreographer, and soprano, and on the choreographic skills and body shape of that singer. Strauss himself stipulated that the dance should be &quot;thoroughly decent, as if it were being done on a prayer mat.&quot; Nevertheless, many productions made the dance explicitly erotic. In a 1907 production in New York the dancer &quot;spared the audience nothing in active and suggestive detail&quot;, to such an extent that some ladies in the audience &quot;covered their eyes with their programs.&quot;

Ernst Krause argues that Strauss&#x27;s version of the dance &quot;established the modern musical formula for the portrayal of ecstatic sensual desire and brought it to perfection.&quot; In Derek B. Scott&#x27;s view, &quot;The eroticism of the &#x27;Dance of the Seven Veils&#x27; is encoded in the sensual richness (timbral and textual) of a huge orchestra, the quasi-Oriental embellishment of melody (intimations of &#x27;exotic&#x27; sensuality), and the devices of crescendo and quickening pace (suggestive of growing excitement).&quot;

==Later versions==
The Wilde play and the Strauss opera led to the phenomenon of &quot;Salomania&quot;, in which various performers put on acts inspired by Salome&#x27;s erotic dance. Several of these were criticised for being salacious and close to stripping, leading to &quot;insistent vogue for women doing glamorous and exotic &#x27;oriental&#x27; dances in striptease&quot;. In 1906 Maude Allan&#x27;s production &quot;Vision of Salomé&quot; opened in Vienna. Based loosely on Wilde&#x27;s play, her version of the Dance of the Seven Veils became famous (and to some notorious) and she was billed as &quot;The Salomé Dancer&quot;. Her version was praised for the &quot;eastern spirit&quot; of her dancing without the &quot;vulgarities familiar to the tourists in Cairo or Tangier&quot;. The dance first appeared in film in 1908 in a Vitagraph production entitled &quot;Salome, or the Dance of the Seven Veils&quot;.
In the 1953 film &quot;Salome&quot;, Rita Hayworth performs the dance as a strip dance. She stops the dance before removing her last veil when she sees John&#x27;s head being delivered on a platter, as she did not want him to be killed in this version of the story.

In the 1961 film &quot;King of Kings&quot;, Salomé, portrayed by Brigid Bazlen, performs a similar dance; her voluptuous seduction of a drunken lascivious Herod Antipas remains highly praised and is now widely regarded as Bazlen&#x27;s best performance.

Salome and the dance are recurring thematic and plot elements in Tom Robbins&#x27;s 1990 novel &quot;Skinny Legs and All&quot;.

<text>Ash-Sharqiyyah Region () was the eastern &quot;minṭaqah&quot; (region) of the Sultanate of Oman. The capital of Ash-Sharqiyyah is Sur. On 28 October 2011 Ash Sharqiyah Region was split into Ash Sharqiyah North Governorate and Ash Sharqiyah South Governorate.

Ash Sharqiyah Region consisted of eleven provinces (&quot;Wilāyāt&quot;): Sur, Ibra, Al-Mudhaibi, Al-Kamil Wal-Wafi, Jalan Bani Bu Hassan, Jalan Bani Bu Ali, Wadi Bani Khalid, Dema Wa Thaieen, Bidiya, Al Qabil, and Massirah. The main cities are Sur and Ibra.

== History ==

=== Archaeology ===
In November 2019, 45 well-preserved tombs covering a 50-80 square metre area and a settlement, dating back to beginning of the Iron Age, were discovered in Al-Mudhaibi by archaeologists from Oman and Heidelberg University. Archaeologists believed that the site belonged to the miners who were working in copper mining.

==Ecology==
Of particular touristic interest is the coast, which includes the headlands of Raʾs al-Ḥadd and Raʾs al-Ghaimah (). The stretch of beach () between these two places is the most significant nesting ground in the Indian Ocean for green turtles. An estimated 13,000 turtles lay their individual clutches of 80 to 100 eggs annually. Oman&#x27;s Ministry of Regional Municipalities, Environment and Water administers the site, which is one of the Sultanate&#x27;s most important nature reserves.

In addition, there is Wadi Bani Khalid. Located in the Hajar Mountains, and what is now the northern governorate, it is one of the most well-known wadis in the country.

<doc id="1327887" wikidata="Q5993016" url="?curid=1327887" title="Ignoramus (play)">
<text>Ignoramus is a college farce, a 1615 academic play by George Ruggle. Written in Latin (with passages in English and French), it was arguably the most famous and influential academic play of English Renaissance drama. Ruggle based his play on &quot;La Trappolaria&quot; (1596), an Italian comedy by Giambattista della Porta (which in turn borrows from the &quot;Pseudolus&quot; of Plautus).

In Latin, &quot;&quot;, the first-person plural present active indicative of &quot;&quot; (“I do not know”, “I am unacquainted with”, “I am ignorant of”), literally means “we are ignorant of” or “we do not know”. The term acquired its English meaning of an ignorant person or dunce as a consequence of Ruggle&#x27;s play.

==Performance==
The play was first produced in Clare College, Cambridge, on Wednesday, March 8, 1615, as part of the program of entertainments for a visit by King James I. James enjoyed the play so much that he returned to Cambridge to see it again on Saturday, May 13 of that year. Contemporary John Chamberlain reported that &quot;the play was full of mirth and variety with many excellent actors, but more than half spoiled by its extreme length of six hours.&quot;

==Texts==
&quot;Ignoramus&quot; was entered into the Stationers&#x27; Register on April 18, 1615, and was published later that year by the bookseller Walter Burre. Two subsequent editions were issued in 1630, and other editions followed in 1658, 1659, 1668, 1707, 1731, 1736, 1737, and after. John Sidney Hawkins issued an elaborately edited text in 1787.

Several manuscripts of the play also exist. The MS. in the collection of the Bodleian Library, &quot;Tanner MS. 306&quot;, features a cast list of the amateur actors in the original production.

Fernando Parkhurst translated the original into English in 1660, as &quot;Ignoramus, or the Academical Lawyer;&quot; Robert Codrington&#x27;s translation followed in 1662. The English-language versions were presented onstage during the Restoration.

==Satire==
The play satirizes the college recorder, Francis Brackyn (also spelt Brackin), a &quot;constant adversary of the university&quot; who is represented as the Ignoramus of the title. Brackyn was unpopular among the academics of the town as a &quot;common lawyer&quot; (they used a crude &quot;law Latin&quot; that the academics deplored); he had previously been ridiculed in the third of the Parnassus plays. In &quot;Ignoramus&quot;, Brackyn is given a romance of false loves; he is enamored of Rosabella and pays 600 gold pieces for her hand in marriage, but is tricked into being with the mannish Polla. Like Malvolio, who is supposed to be mad, he is suspected of being possessed and put through an exorcism before being carried off to a monastery to recuperate (and to stay away from the loves of the more worthy wits).

The lawyers who were the subject of the play&#x27;s satire did not enjoy the work; Sir Edward Coke, the Lord Chief Justice, believed that he was a target of some of the barbs. The play provoked a quarrel between academics and lawyers. The lawyers responded with satirical poems and ballads, which inspired responses by the academics to create a passionate controversy. Ruggle&#x27;s play even had an influence on the reform of legal language in England.

==Author==
George Ruggle (1575–1622) graduated from Lavenham Grammar School and matriculated at St. John&#x27;s, Cambridge, in 1589. He transferred to Trinity College, where he received his B.A. in 1593, and his M.A. in 1597. He became a fellow of Trinity the following year and remained at the college until 1620.

Upon Ruggle&#x27;s death, Nicholas Ferrar read a eulogy for the academic at a meeting of the Virginia Company; he referred to Ruggle as a &quot;Brother of the Company&quot; and revealed that Ruggle had worked for the company for the last three years of his life. In his will, Ruggle left £100 for the Christian education of American Indian children in Virginia.

Ruggle is reported to have written other plays, but none are extant.

<doc id="1327891" wikidata="Q7883750" url="?curid=1327891" title="Underoos">
<text>Underoos is a brand of underwear primarily for children, produced by the Fruit of the Loom company. The packages include a matching top and bottom for either boys or girls, featuring a character from popular entertainment media, especially superhero comics, animated programs, and fantasy/science fiction. Typically, the garment mimics the distinctive costume of the character, encouraging the wearer to pretend to be the character. In other designs, it features an image of the character or logo on the undergarments.

==History==
Underoos were developed as a product idea in 1977 by an independent entrepreneur, Larry Weiss, who obtained licenses for the four major comic character groups (DC Comics, Marvel Comics, Hanna-Barbera, Archie Comics), which included Superman, Batman, Shazam, Wonder Woman, Supergirl, Spider-Man, and Captain America. 

The product idea was first offered to Hanes, but was rejected. Scott Paper company pursued development, but ultimately decided to not market the product. Fruit of the Loom had been engaged as supplier of the blank underwear and another vendor engaged to apply transfers. Informed of Scott Paper Company&#x27;s decision to not market this novel product, Fruit of the Loom inquired if they would be permitted to market the product, now fully developed. Weiss agreed, and in 1978 Fruit of the Loom bought Underoos. 

Early advertisements for the brand featured images of boys and girls in wrestler poses with the marketing slogan &quot;When the color lasts, and the fit lasts, and the quality lasts, and the joy lasts, it&#x27;s got to be Underoos...the underwear that&#x27;s fun to wear.&quot; 

The product was tested in three markets including the New York Metropolitan area. Retailer and consumer demand was so strong the product was immediately expanded to national distribution. 

Fruit of the Loom licensed out the Underoos brand name to Bioworld, which made Underoos in adult sizes. By the end of 2020, Underoos was selling out its existing stock. Its homepage changed to a thank-you notice to customers in 2021.

==In pop culture==
===Marvel Cinematic Universe===
In &quot;Captain America: Civil War&quot;, Iron Man shouts out &quot;Underoos&quot; at Spider-Man as a signal for the teenager to join the superhero confrontation and steal Captain America&#x27;s shield. The nickname references Spider-Man&#x27;s youth and suit. The Underoos reference resulted in numerous memes circulating online and being compiled into collections inspired by the movie scene.

Due to the product being sold predominately in America and being unfamiliar internationally, the brand name Underoos was exchanged for relevant regional meanings during the movie&#x27;s translations. Some of the alternative names shouted by Iron Man to Spider-Man include the nicknames c&quot;ollants&quot; (French)&quot;, &quot; (Portuguese)&quot;, pijamalı &quot; (Turkish), &quot;joljori&quot; (Korean), and &quot;rugdalózós&quot; (Hungarian).

<text>Nippon News Network (NNN) is a Japanese commercial television network owned by Nippon Television (NTV), which itself is controlled by The Yomiuri Shimbun Holdings. The network&#x27;s responsibility includes the syndication of national television news bulletins to its regional affiliates, and news exchange between the stations.

NNN also operates NTV News24, a 24-hour news channel available on subscription television platforms and also aired on select NNN affiliates during overnights.

Distribution of non-news television programmes is handled by Nippon Television Network System (NNS), another network set up by NTV.

==Overview==
In the early days of the development of commercial terrestrial broadcasting in Japan, the allocation of broadcast frequencies had a major impact on the selection of core bureaus by broadcasters outside the Kanto Region. Therefore, all commercial broadcasters in the Shikoku Region chose to be part of the Nippon TV network while those in Kyushu Region chose to be part of the Japan News Network. After the launch of Nippon TV in 1953, the broadcaster then aired its first proper news bulletins which includes NNN Today&#x27;s Events (first aired in 1954), NNN News Flash (first aired in 1956), and Nippon TeleNews (first aired 1958).

On April 1, 1960, Japan News Network (where Tokyo Broadcasting System is part of) was established, being the first proper commercial group of networks in the country.

NNN was formed on April 1, 1966, centering on Nippon Television (NTV) and Yomiuri Television (ytv).

Osaka Television Broadcasting (OTV, current Asahi Broadcasting Television/ANN member), an early network station of NTV, Chubu Nippon Broadcasting (CBC, current CBC Television), Hokkaido Broadcasting (HBC), Radio Kyushu (RKB, current RKB) Mainichi Broadcasting Corporation) received &#x27;Tokyo Telenews&#x27; from Radio Tokyo (→ Tokyo Broadcasting, now TBS Television) networked, so there was no network news at NTV until the opening of West Japan Broadcasting (RNC).

When NNN was launched, there were no affiliated stations throughout Kyushu, including Fukuoka Prefecture (At the time NNN was launched, Nippon Television set up a Kyushu branch office in Fukuoka). Also, in the Chukyo area, secondary affiliations continued for a long time (Nagoya TV → Chukyo TV), and it took more time to create a system than JNN and FNN (The first stations in the Sea of Japan area of Tohoku, Toyama, Fukui, Yamanashi, 4 prefectures of Shikoku, Tottori and Yamaguchi are all NNN affiliates).

Kagoshima Yomiuri Television joined in 1994, completing the current system. It consists of 27 full stations and 3 cross-net stations (Fukui Broadcasting as a primary NNN affiliate, NNN secondary, TV Oita as an FNN/NNN station, TV Miyazaki as a triple FNN/NNN/ANN station) for a total of 30 stations, making it the largest in Japan. There are no NNN (NNS) affiliated stations in Saga Prefecture and Okinawa Prefecture. In addition, there are 11 stations operating radio and television simultaneously.

The core stations are Nippon Television, Sapporo Television, Miyagi Television, Chukyo Television, Yomiuri Television, Hiroshima Television, and Fukuoka Broadcasting.

Of the NNN (NNS) affiliated stations, Sapporo Television, Shizuoka Daiichi Television, Chukyo Television, Yomiuri Television, Hiroshima Television, Fukuoka Broadcasting, Nagasaki International Television, and Kumamoto Kenmin Television are affiliated with NTV&#x27;s broadcasting holding company &quot;Nippon Television Holdings”.
The digital terrestrial LCN is often &quot;4&quot; including Nippon Television, but Aomori Broadcasting (RAB), Kitanihon Broadcasting (KNB), Shikoku Broadcasting (JRT), Nihonkai Television (NKT) use &quot;1&quot;, STV/FBS use &quot;5&quot;, Fukui Broadcasting (FBC) is &quot;7&quot; (as a dual affiliate of NNN and ANN), and ytv is &quot;10&quot;. Of the broadcasting stations that do not use &quot;4&quot; for the remote control key ID, except for FBS (analog master station UHF channel 37) and FBC (analog master station VHF channel 11), the transmission channel number of the analog master station was inherited.

<text>&quot;You Won&#x27;t See Me&quot; is a song by the English rock band the Beatles from their 1965 album &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;. It was written by Paul McCartney and credited to Lennon–McCartney. The lyrics address McCartney&#x27;s troubled relationship with Jane Asher and her desire to pursue her career as a stage and film actress. The Beatles recorded the song during what Mark Lewisohn describes as a &quot;marathon&quot; final recording session for &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;, to ensure the album&#x27;s pre-Christmas release.

==Background and inspiration==

&quot;You Won&#x27;t See Me&quot; is about a crisis in McCartney&#x27;s relationship with girlfriend Jane Asher, who was refusing to comply with McCartney&#x27;s wishes that she stay at home and put his interests first. She had accepted an offer to appear in a stage production at the Bristol Old Vic theatre in 1965, while the Beatles were recording Rubber Soul. McCartney attempted to telephone her in Bristol, but she rejected him by not returning his calls. McCartney later said that it was &quot;shattering to be without her&quot;.

McCartney had lived in the Asher family home at Wimpole Street in central London since 1963. He recalled writing the song in the family music room in the basement of the house. His composition originated from &quot;a two-note progression that I had very high on the first two strings of the guitar: the E and B strings&quot;. He developed this by playing descending semitones on the B string while letting the top string ring out. He described the song as &quot;very Motown-flavoured&quot; with a &quot;James Jamerson feel&quot;. He drew musical inspiration for the composition from the Four Tops&#x27; UK hit single &quot;It&#x27;s the Same Old Song&quot; (1965).

During this period, McCartney also wrote &quot;We Can Work It Out&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Looking Through You&quot; as commentaries on his relationship with Asher. The more biting tone of his lyrics marked a change from his typical love songs, in Howard Sounes&#x27; interpretation, McCartney later said of the band&#x27;s approach to songwriting on &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;: &quot;We&#x27;d had our cute period, and now it was time to expand.&quot;
==Recording==
The Beatles recorded &quot;You Won&#x27;t See Me&quot; during the last day of recording for &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; – an all-night session that started at 6 pm on 11 November 1965. The deadline for completing the album was up, and the band needed to record three songs that night, in addition to finishing work on &quot;I&#x27;m Looking Through You&quot;. As a result, they cut the song in only two takes. At 3:22, it was the longest track the Beatles had recorded up until that point. The fadeout is slightly longer on the mono mix.

McCartney played piano on the basic track and then overdubbed his bass part. The tempo gradually slows down throughout the song, a point that music journalist Robert Fontenot attributes to McCartney leading the performance on piano, rather than Ringo Starr&#x27;s timekeeping abilities on the drums.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fontenot/About&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In author Jonathan Gould&#x27;s description of the song, the tempo appears to &quot;drag&quot; due to McCartney&#x27;s &quot;hyperactive Motown-style bass line&quot;. Mal Evans, one of the Beatles&#x27; roadies, is credited on the album sleeve as having played Hammond organ. His contribution consists solely of an A note held throughout the final verse and the coda. Gould also comments on the effect achieved by John Lennon and George Harrison&#x27;s wordless backing vocals over the verses, saying that their voices represent &quot;a pair of deaf ears&quot; by &quot;embodying the girl&#x27;s indifference&quot; to McCartney&#x27;s complaints. Starr augmented his drum part with a separate hi-hat overdub, adding rhythmic accents throughout the song.

==Release and reception==
&quot;Rubber Soul&quot; was released on 3 December 1965 on EMI&#x27;s Parlophone record label. &quot;You Won&#x27;t See Me&quot; was sequenced as the third track, between Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; and &quot;Nowhere Man&quot;. While the album was an immediate commercial success, some reviewers in the UK were unprepared for the artistic progression the Beatles had made in their musical arrangements and as lyricists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams/MojoSpecial&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In his review for &quot;Record Mirror&quot;, Richard Green wrote: &quot;It is possible to say that Lennon and McCartney are the great songwriting team of the day and that Beatles performances are spot-on, but this LP cannot support that statement.&quot; He included &quot;You Won&#x27;t See Me&quot; among the tracks that were &quot;dull and ordinary&quot; with &quot;none of the old Beatles excitement and compulsiveness about them&quot;. &quot;Melody Maker&quot; said that the band&#x27;s sound had become &quot;a little subdued&quot; and that songs such as &quot;You Won&#x27;t See Me&quot; and &quot;Nowhere Man&quot; &quot;almost get monotonous – an un-Beatle-like feature if ever there was one&quot;. By contrast, Nikki Wine (aka Eden) of &quot;KRLA Beat&quot; found the album &quot;unbelievably sensational&quot; and described &quot;You Won&#x27;t See Me&quot; as &quot;One of the greatest arrangements and blending of melodies by the Beatles ... and it has to be one of the best cuts on the disc.&quot;

Among more recent appraisals, Tim Riley says that the song&#x27;s &quot;antagonism can&#x27;t help being tempered by [McCartney&#x27;s] melodic suavity, so he winds up sounding like an innocent victim rather than a co-conspirator in a love affair&quot;; similarly, the arrangement and the position of McCartney&#x27;s vocal in the mix ensure that &quot;the texture becomes more engaging than the emotion.&quot; Riley nevertheless admires the complementary aspect of McCartney&#x27;s bass and piano contributions, adding of &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; as a whole: &quot;without ever being intrusive, his bass emerges as an irreplaceable part of the overall texture. Because he virtually breathes melody, his bass lines begin to soar with inventive counterpoint to the band ...&quot; Ian MacDonald says the song, like &quot;Nowhere Man&quot;, &quot;needed something to lift it&quot; and rues the group&#x27;s use of the &quot;irritating &#x27;ooh-la-la-la&#x27; backing-vocal formula&quot;. He concludes that, while it is &quot;redeemed&quot; by McCartney&#x27;s fluid bass playing, &quot;&#x27;You Won&#x27;t See Me&#x27; soon founders under the weight of its own self-pity and expires long before struggling to the end of an unusually protracted fade.&quot; In his song review for AllMusic, Richie Unterberger finds the buoyant melody at odds with the dejected lyrics, but he praises the vocal arrangement, particularly &quot;the brilliant interaction of counterpoint melodies&quot; through the addition of Lennon and Harrison&#x27;s harmonies.

==Personnel==
According to Ian MacDonald:

*Paul McCartney – double-tracked lead vocal, bass guitar, piano
*John Lennon – backing vocal, tambourine
*George Harrison – backing vocal, lead guitar
*Ringo Starr – drums, hi-hat
*Mal Evans – Hammond organ

==Anne Murray version==

In 1974, &quot;You Won&#x27;t See Me&quot; became a big hit for Anne Murray, reaching number 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Easy Listening chart. Lennon is said to have told Murray that her version of &quot;You Won&#x27;t See Me&quot; was one of his favourite Beatles covers.

Murray later re-recorded the song as a duet with Shelby Lynne as part of her 2007 &quot;Duets: Friends &amp; Legends&quot; album. A self-professed Beatles fanatic, Murray covered several other songs of theirs as singles, including &quot;Day Tripper&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Happy Just to Dance with You&quot;. The soulful backing vocals were devised by Murray&#x27;s backup singer, Diane Brooks, and the bass line was devised by her bass player, Skip Beckwith.

<doc id="1327902" wikidata="Q7835648" url="?curid=1327902" title="Trapper Keeper">
<text>Trapper Keeper is a brand of loose-leaf binder created by Mead. Popular with students in the United States and parts of Latin America from the 1970s to the 1990s, it featured sliding plastic rings (instead of standard snap-closed metal binder rings), folders, and pockets to keep schoolwork and papers, and a wrap-around flap with a Velcro closure (originally a metal snap closure).

Trapper Keepers usually had a theme, such as a cartoon, television show, or video game. Between 1988 and 1995, &quot;Designer Series&quot; Trapper Keepers featured abstract designs and, later, computer-generated images.

==Design history==
The Trapper Keeper was invented in the late 1970s by Jon Wyant, Director of New Product
Development at Mead, acting upon a request by E. Bryant Crutchfield, a marketing executive at Mead for a &quot;locker item&quot; that would allow folders to be easily removed, for their use in a class, yet protected from falling out accidentally.

No patent was filed by Mead, but the Trapper Keeper relied on earlier 1975 and 1976 patents by Wyant and fellow Mead employee Paul Seaborn. Wyant was also responsible for 
naming and creating the graphic design of the product. In 2013 Crutchfield had given interviews in which he claimed sole inventorship of the product, and these were erroneously cited in his 2022 New York Times obituary. 

The binder got its name because it was sold in combination with pocket folders designed by Mead called &quot;Trappers&quot;, which differed from other pocket folders in that the pockets&#x27; three sides connected with the bottom, outside edge, and top (as opposed to the bottom, outside edge, and spine) of the folders. This design prevented papers from falling out of the Trapper&#x27;s pockets when it was closed. Trappers were three-hole punched so that they could be put in any 3-ring binder, including a Trapper Keeper. 

In preparation for test-marketing, Crutchfield wrote a commercial and flew
from Dayton, Ohio (the headquarters of Mead) to New York City. With a total budget of $5000, he hired three actors and filmed his commercial in just three hours.

Wichita, Kansas was chosen as the initial market for August 1978. Trapper folders came in three colors (red, blue, and green), with a suggested retail price of 29 cents each, while the Trapper Keepers had a suggested retail price of $4.85 but came with a few Trapper folders. 

In the test market, each Trapper Keeper also included a feedback card, which promised a free notebook from Mead if the card was returned. To everyone&#x27;s surprise, the product inventory sold out, and the 1500 feedback cards returned revealed that adults as well as teens were buying Trapper Keepers, for non-school uses.

Three years after the Trapper Keeper was released, the design was tweaked to include a Velcro strap instead of the initial metal snap. This design change allowed for greater ease of use and more efficient manufacturing.

The Designer Series ran from 1988 to 1995, and introduced &quot;fashionable, funky and sometimes psychedelic designs... The company also made a deal with Lisa Frank... and licensed cartoon characters like Garfield and Sonic the Hedgehog.&quot;

From 1996 to 1999, Mead released a collection of notebooks and folders known as &quot;FuturoCity&quot;, featuring futuristic city and landscape designs.

In 2007, a new version of Trapper Keeper featured a magnetic closure in place of the Velcro closure, a customizable front cover, and binder dividers instead of Trapper folders.

In 2014, another new version of the Trapper Keeper was released, featuring a metal button closure, as well as a new feature called &quot;Snapper Trappers&quot;, which are plastic strips that act as dividers and can have regular notebooks attached to them in addition to folders and dividers; the Snapper Trappers can be placed or removed without having to open the rings of the binder.

For the 2015 school year, Trapper Keeper introduced &quot;Star Wars&quot; Trapper Keeper supplies, and &quot;Hello Kitty&quot; Trapper Keeper supplies, and a new patterned line called &quot;Fun in the Sun&quot;.

Mead brought back the original design for the Trapper Keeper with most of its original features in 2021.

<text>The (CAO) is an agency of the Cabinet of Japan. It is responsible for handling the day-to-day affairs of the Cabinet. 

The Cabinet Office is formally headed by the Prime Minister.

==Ministers==

==History==
The Cabinet Office was established on 6 January 2001, following the reorganization of the central government. It was created to assist in the planning and overall coordination of government policies led by the Cabinet (including the Cabinet Secretariat). The Cabinet Office is different from other ministries and agencies, as it is installed in the Cabinet and includes several Ministers of State called Minister of State for Special Missions.

Early on, some argued it was inappropriate to use the name Cabinet Office because &quot;it is an organization that divides and manages administrative affairs and not the cabinet itself&quot;.

The National Administrative Organization Law does not apply, instead, all necessary matters are stipulated in the Cabinet Office Establishment Law. Many important policy issues require cross-ministerial responses and since the establishment of the Cabinet Office they have delt with many different matters. The Cabinet Office&#x27;s presence has increased, such as its jurisdiction over certified children&#x27;s educational institutions. The number of Ministers of State for Special Missions has increased from 6 at the beginning of the Cabinet Office, to 10 as of September 2020.

In the Third Abe Cabinet, as a review of the work, the &quot;Act for Partial Revision of the National Administrative Organization Act, etc. for Strengthening Functions Related to Comprehensive Coordination, etc. of the Important Policy of the Cabinet&quot; was enacted, and future transfer of work to each ministry was established.

==Jurisdiction==
The Cabinet Office&#x27;s function is to help the Cabinet work on important policies and streamline critical issues Japan will face in the future. 

Its responsibilities extend to:

*The Imperial Family, honorary and official systems
*Promotion of the formation of a gender-equal society 
*Civil Activities 
*Promotion and development of Okinawa and the northern territories
*Protection of the public from disasters 
*Promotion of fair and free competition between businesses 
*Ensuring national security 
*Identifying specific individuals in administrative procedures 
*Ensuring the proper handling of numbers, etc.
*Ensuring appropriate functions of finance 
*Promoting measures for the realization of a society where consumers can live in a safe and secure consumer life

As such, the Cabinet Office is responsible for several agencies and internal ministries and administrations through which these responsibilities are spread.

<text>Elizabeth Taylor Greenfield (1817 – March 31, 1876), dubbed &quot;The Black Swan&quot; (a play on Jenny Lind&#x27;s sobriquet, &quot;The Swedish Nightingale&quot; and Catherine Hayes&#x27;s &quot;The Irish Swan&quot;), was an American singer considered the best-known Black concert artist of her time. She was lauded by James M. Trotter for her &quot;remarkably sweet tones and wide vocal compass&quot;. Trotter described her as the first African American concert singer, which has been repeated through many biographies.

==Early life==
Greenfield was born into slavery in Natchez, Mississippi sometime between 1808 and 1826. to Anna Greenfield and a man whose name may have been &quot;Taylor.&quot; According to an 1854 article in &quot;The Tri-Weekly Commercial&quot;, &quot;her mother was of Indian descent, her father an African.&quot; Not much is known about her family, though her will referenced a sister, Mary Parker, and nieces and nephews.

In the early 1820s, Greenfield&#x27;s enslaver, Elizabeth H. Greenfield, a former plantation owner, moved to Philadelphia after divorcing her second husband and manumitted her slaves. E.H. Greenfield worked with the American Emancipation Society to send 18 formerly enslaved residents of the Greenfield plantation, including Anna Greenfield and two of her daughters, to Liberia on August 2, 1831, aboard the brig &quot;Criterion&quot;.

Greenfield remained in Philadelphia, becoming well acquainted with her upper-class white neighbors. She lived with E.H. Greenfield until she was about eight years old, then attending Clarkson School, a private, Quaker school, probably living with relatives. She studied music as a child, encouraged by E.H. Greenfield, although musical education was not generally provided by the Quakers with whom she associated. (While some sources state that E.H. Greenfield was herself a Quaker, others state only that she attended Quaker meetings &quot;occasionally&quot; and supported the Society of Friends financially.) She returned to live with E.H. Greenfield in 1836 to take care of her. This may have been a situation of indentured service, though E.H. Greenfield paid her wages, which was uncommon in these situations. After E.H. Greenfield&#x27;s death in 1845, Greenfield was shut out of her inheritance. She established herself as a music teacher in Philadelphia before moving to Buffalo in 1851, where she had relatives and friends. According to one biographical account, she was discovered when compelled to sing on the boat ride to Buffalo.

== Career ==

=== Early career ===
In about 1851, Greenfield began to sing at private parties, debuting at the Buffalo Musical Association under the patronage of Electa and Herman B. Potter. After her initial success in Buffalo and Rochester, she may have been briefly managed by two African American men from Philadelphia, but in 1851, she took on agent Colonel J. H. Wood, a P. T. Barnum-style promoter and supporter of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, who would not allow Black patrons into her concerts. According to an 1853 exposé by Martin Delany, Wood took advantage of Greenfield professionally, handling her money and keeping her in a state of near slavery and isolation.

Greenfield toured the East Coast and the Midwest from 1851 to 1853. In 1852, she toured in Canada, where she was likely the first Black woman to sing art music professionally. She was held up by abolitionists as an example of the success that former slaves might realize. However, she was also followed by racist and pro-slavery news coverage. Some news outlets accused of her being a minstrel performer in blackface, which led to incidents of laughter and comic portrayal at her serious performances. Minstrel acts went on to use her as inspiration, with minstrel &quot;Black Swan&quot;s being staged through the 1870s. Following the tour, Greenfield lived briefly with Hiram E. Howard&#x27;s family in Buffalo, helping raise their son who was later nicknamed &quot;Greenfield&quot; in her honor (particularly unique for a white child). Howard and Eli Cook helped Greenfield arrange her European tour in April of that year. Allegedly, around this time, Barnum offered to represent Greenfield. 
=== Concert at Metropolitan Hall ===
In On March 31, 1853, Greenfield debuted at Metropolitan Hall in New York City, which held an audience of 4,000. The day before the concert, the New-York Tribune published &quot;Particular Notice – No colored persons can be admitted, as there has been no part of the house appropriated for them,&quot; leading to uproar in the city. Before the concert, there were rumors that there would be white supremacist riots and a threat of arson. Even at the concert, Greenfield experienced prejudice, with the audience laughing as she took the stage and her escort onto the stage keeping his distance.

Following this concert, Greenfield was greatly criticized not realizing her social importance. After the concert, Greenfield apologized to her own people for their exclusion from the performance and gave a concert to benefit the Home of Aged Colored Persons and the Colored Orphan Asylum.

=== London tour ===
In March 1853, a testimonial concert in Buffalo funded a trip to Europe for additional training. However, a London manager defaulted, leaving her stranded. She contacted British abolitionists Lord Shaftesbury and Harriet Beecher Stowe for help, and was introduced to the abolitionist elite. The noted abolitionist Duchess of Sutherland became Greenfield&#x27;s patron. Concert promoter Robert W. Olliver handled the business, and singers Italo Gardoni and Charles Cotton were hired to support her. Greenfield premiered in London at Hanover Square Rooms on May 31, 1853. Accounts disagree regarding her success in England, with Kurt Gänzl noting &quot;Some versions of &#x27;history&#x27; of course, would have it otherwise, and I have read pieces about the lady speaking of her &#x27;popularity&#x27; and her &#x27;success&#x27; in Britain. It simply was not so. The time of the black vocalist – and certainly not a black vocalist as unprepared as this one – had not yet come.&quot;

Sutherland introduced Greenfield to Queen Victoria&#x27;s Chapel Royal organist, George Thomas Smart. She charmed Smart, who took her on as a student and presented her in concert. She gave a command performance for the queen at Buckingham Palace on May 10, 1854; she was the first African American performer to perform before British royalty. Queen Victoria paid her twenty pounds, passage for her to return to the United States. Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote about Greenfield&#x27;s appearance before the &quot;elite&quot; English society in &quot;Sunny Memories of Foreign Lands&quot;

=== Post-London career ===
In the United States, Greenfield reconnected with Wood, though with a strong stance against his discriminatory practices, though circumstances still required her to frequently sing at segregated venues. Following her return from England, she performed many charity concerts, many supporting Black churches and schools, which were widely popular and raised considerable funds. By 1855, she was hailed as an inspirational figure for both free and enslaved Blacks. In the late 1850s, some of her charitable work became controversial, as she raised money for African missions, expeditions, and aid for Liberian settlers, largely colonialist causes.

Greenfield toured the United States again in 1854, 1856, and 1863, sometimes with Thomas Bowers, who became known as &quot;The Colored Mario&quot; and &quot;The American Mario&quot; for the similarity of his voice to Italian opera tenor Giovanni Mario. Her concerts brought her to Maryland, which, as a slave state, was particularly dangerous. These concerts were incredibly successful, though, with newspapers around the North describing them as progress toward abolition. Throughout her tours, southern newspapers denied her success or twisted it into pro-slavery propaganda, describing her in grotesquely racist language.

In her 1863 tour, Greenfield&#x27;s concert featured many political songs. During the American Civil War, she continued performing charity concerts in the North and raised funds to support Black Union soldiers. She also performed for Black soldiers. After 1866, she performed at churches in the South. After 1863, Greenfield occasionally performed, often to benefit African American causes. She was praised as an exceptional Black achiever, with James McCune Smith claiming &quot;The colored man must do impracticable things before he is admitted to a place in society. He must speak like a Douglass, write like a Dumas, and sing like the Black Swan before he could be recognized as a human being.&quot; She was included in each of Philadelphia&#x27;s &quot;Social, Civil and Statistical Association of the Colored People of Pennsylvania&#x27;s&quot; lecture series (likely volunteering her time) as an integral part of the program, and accompanying key speeches. Notably, she performed preceding a lecture by Frederick Douglass

== Later life and death ==
Settling in Philadelphia, Greenfield ran a music studio and promoted Black singers. Among her voice pupils was Thomas Bowers. She was a member of the Philadelphia Shiloh Baptist Church, and directed its choir. In the 1860s she created an opera troupe, the Black Swan Opera Troupe, with Bowers, which she directed. By 1868, she was listed as a &quot;music critic&quot; among professors supporting The Christian Recorder. Greenfield died in Philadelphia of paralysis on March 31, 1876. In the early 1920s, Harry Pace established Black Swan Records, named after Greenfield.

== Repertoire and vocal range ==
Best known for her performances of the music of George Frideric Handel, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Gioachino Rossini, Giacomo Meyerbeer, Vincenzo Bellini, and Gaetano Donizetti, she also performed sentimental American songs such as Henry Bishop&#x27;s 1852 setting of John Howard Payne&#x27;s &quot;Home! Sweet Home!&quot; and Stephen Foster&#x27;s &quot;Old Folks at Home&quot;. Her repertoire also included &quot;I&#x27;m Free,&quot; a piece written for her by Charles William Glover.

Greenfield performed in both masculine and feminine vocal registers as a soprano and a tenor. Her vocal compass gave her entry into both Black and white cultural spaces.

<doc id="1327934" wikidata="Q495049" url="?curid=1327934" title="HUBO">
<text>HUBO (; designated KHR-3) is a walking humanoid robot, head mounted on a life-size walking bipedal frame, developed by the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) and released on January 6, 2005. According to Hubo&#x27;s creator Prof Jun-Ho Oh and his Plenary Session at ICRA 2012 entitled &quot;Development Outline of the Humanoid Robot: HUBO II&quot; the name Hubo is simply a name, not an abbreviation.

Hubo has voice recognition and synthesis faculties, as well as sophisticated vision in which its two eyes move independently of one another.

==Prototypes==
Korea&#x27;s history in robotics engineering is relatively short. KAIST only began research in 2000, led by professor Oh Jun-ho. The first prototype, KHR-0, consisting of two legs without an upper body was built in 2001. KHR-1 was developed without a head or hands released in 2003, followed by a complete humanoid KHR-2 in 2004.

==KHR-3 HUBO==
The KHR-3&#x27;s physical specifications, such as height, weight, and the number of DOFs (degrees of freedom), were similar to Honda&#x27;s ASIMO, which served as the benchmark for the project. In terms of AI and movements, HUBO fell short of the &quot;next-gen ASIMO,&quot; which was unveiled three months later. While HUBO could only walk at 1.25 km/h, the ASIMO could walk at 2.5 km/h and also run at 3 km/h. The ASIMO was also capable of walking up and down stairs, which was a temporary shortcoming for HUBO needing further development. KAIST researchers noted, however, that HUBO could play kai-bai-bo (the Korean version of rock paper scissors), which was impossible for ASIMO since its fingers could not move independently of each other.

==Albert Hubo==
Albert HUBO () is a humanoid robot, based on the HUBO, but with an animatronic head in the likeness of Albert Einstein. In November 2005, KAIST, Korea and Dallas, Texas based Hanson Robotics, Inc (HRI) released the world&#x27;s first android head mounted on a life-size walking bi-pedal frame at the APEC Summit in Seoul, Korea. The walking frame was based on the KHR-3 HUBO, while the head was an exact recreation of the late physicist, Albert Einstein. The android was able to speak and cover a wide range of natural facial expressions, built upon prior HRI development on the Philip K. Dick android, which made its official debut at the &quot;Wired Magazine&quot; NextFest &#x27;05 in Chicago, Illinois. The humanoid prototype was officially dubbed &quot;Albert Einstein Hubo&quot;.

It was developed by Joon-Ho Oh of KAIST in conjunction with Hanson Robotics, who developed the head. Albert HUBO served as the ambassador of &quot;DYNAMIC KOREA&quot;, an initiative by the government of South Korea to rebrand and promote its technology internationally. Albert HUBO is capable of making many facial expressions and interacting with people.

Albert HUBO is 1.37 m tall and weighs 57 kg. Its walking speed is 1.25 km per hour, walking cycle is 0.95 seconds per step, and stride is 32 cm per step. Albert HUBO runs on Windows XP and RTX.

==Jaemi HUBO / HUBO 2==
Jaemi HUBO was developed from 2008 to 2009. The complete humanoid robot was given a slimmer design with an aluminum endoskeleton and a polycarbonate frame, resulting in a slightly taller height but a 20% lighter weight than its predecessors. Its movements were more realistic since the arms made quicker and more natural motions, and the legs could stretch to imitate human walking, which also consumes less energy than the traditional humanoid walking based on the Zero Moment Point trajectory. Its walking speed was improved to 1.5 km/h, and it also acquired the ability to run at 3.0 km/h (which is still much slower than the new ASIMO&#x27;s 9 km/h by comparison).

==Specifications==
==DARPA Robotics Challenge==
A HUBO entered by TEAM KAIST was the winner of the DARPA Robotics Challenge finals on June 6, 2015. The machine, called DRC-Hubo, is an adaptable multifunctional device with the ability to transform from a walking robot to rolling on four wheels by bending and using wheels incorporated into its knees. One of the tasks was to climb stairs, which the DRC-Hubo was able to do by transforming into its walking posture.

* Regional Bureaus (8 Regional Bureaus of Health and Welfare and 47 Prefectural Labour Bureaus)
* External Bureaus (Japan Pension Service, Central Labour Relations Commission)

==Investigations==

===Highway tour bus companies===
After a fatal bus accident on April 29, 2012, where a bus bound for Tokyo Disneyland crashed in Gunma Prefecture killing seven and injuring 39 others, the ministry launched an investigation into highway bus companies. Investigations were carried out at a total of 339 businesses. It was discovered that 95.6% (324 firms) were violating the Labor Standards Law and the Industrial Safety and Health Law. 219 businesses (64.6%) broke the law by having their drivers work behind the wheel more than the legal maximum of eight hours a day and 40 hours a week, or longer than what was agreed upon with their labour union. It also found 37 businesses, (10.9%), did not provide &quot;at least one day off a week,&quot; which the law obliges employers to give their drivers. Also, it found that 260 (76.6%) did not observe standards involving bus driver working hours, which prohibit them from working more than 16 hours a day in combined driving and office time. The ministry said it took &quot;corrective measures&quot; with those who violated the laws.

==Criticism==
Published ministry employee and outspoken critic Moriyo Kimura states that the ministry&#x27;s medical officers (&quot;ikei gikan&quot;) are &quot;corrupt and self-serving.&quot; Kimura states that the officers, who number 250, have little experience and see no patients nor practice medicine after being hired by the ministry. Thus, says Kimura, Japan&#x27;s public health policies lag behind other developed countries, by &quot;decades&quot;.
