<text>William Cunningham (29 December 184910 June 1919) was a Scottish economic historian and Anglican priest. He was a proponent of the historical method in economics and an opponent of free trade.

==Early life and education==
Cunningham was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, the third son of James Cunningham, Writer to the Signet. Educated at the Edinburgh Institution (taught by Robert McNair Ferguson, amongst others), the Edinburgh Academy, the University of Edinburgh, and Trinity College, Cambridge, he graduated BA in 1873, having gained first-class honours in the Moral Science tripos.

==Career==
Cunningham took holy orders in 1873, later serving as chaplain of Trinity College, Cambridge, from 1880 to 1891. He was university lecturer in history from 1884 to 1891, in which year he was appointed Tooke Professor of Economy and Statistics at King&#x27;s College, London, a post which he held until 1897. He was lecturer in economic history at Harvard University (), and Hulsean Lecturer at Cambridge (1885). He became vicar of Great St Mary&#x27;s, Cambridge, in 1887, and was a founding fellow of the British Academy. In 1907 he was appointed Archdeacon of Ely.

Cunningham&#x27;s &quot;Growth of English Industry and Commerce During the Early and Middle Ages&quot; (1890; 4th ed., 1905) and &quot;Growth of English Industry and Commerce in Modern Times&quot; (1882; 3rd ed., 1903) were at the time among the standard works of reference on the industrial history of England.

Cunningham&#x27;s eminence as an economic historian gave special importance to his support of Joseph Chamberlain from 1903 onwards in criticizing the English free-trade policies and advocating tariff reform.

He was a critic of the nascent neoclassical economics, particularly as propounded by his colleague, Alfred Marshall, and the Cambridge school.

Cunningham has been described as &quot;a champion of women&#x27;s education in Cambridge.&quot; He taught the British historian Annie Abram.

Cunningham died in 1919 in Cambridge, England.

<text>May Sarton was the pen name of Eleanore Marie Sarton (May 3, 1912 – July 16, 1995), a Belgian-American novelist, poet, and memoirist. Although her best work is strongly personalised with erotic female imagery, she resisted the label of ‘lesbian writer’, preferring to convey the universality of human love.

==Biography==
Sarton was born in Wondelgem, Belgium (today a part of the city of Ghent), the only child of historian of science George Sarton and his wife, English artist Mabel Eleanor Elwes. When German troops invaded Belgium after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in 1914, her family fled to Ipswich, England, where Sarton&#x27;s maternal grandmother lived.

One year later, they moved to Boston, Massachusetts, where her father started working at Harvard University. Sarton started theatre lessons in her late teens but continued writing poetry throughout her adolescence. She went to school in Cambridge, Massachusetts, graduating from Cambridge Latin High School in 1929.

Sarton won a scholarship to Vassar but felt drawn to the theater after seeing Eva Le Gallienne perform in &quot;The Cradle Song&quot;. She joined Le Gallienne&#x27;s Civic Repertory Theatre in New York City and spent a year working as an apprentice. However, Sarton continued to write poetry. When she was seventeen, she published a series of sonnets in December 1930, some of which were featured in her first published volume, &quot;Encounter in April&quot; (1937).

When she was nineteen, Sarton traveled to Europe, living in Paris for a year. In this time, she met such literary and cultural figures as Virginia Woolf, Elizabeth Bowen, Julian Huxley and Juliette Huxley, Lugné-Pöe, Basil de Sélincourt, and S. S. Koteliansky. Sarton had affairs with both of the Huxleys. It was within this environment and community that she published her first novel, &quot;The Single Hound&quot; (1938).

In 1945 in Santa Fe, New Mexico, she met Judith &quot;Judy&quot; Matlack (September 9, 1898 – December 22, 1982), who became her partner for the next thirteen years. They separated in 1956, when Sarton&#x27;s father died and Sarton moved to Nelson, New Hampshire. &quot;Honey in the Hive&quot; (1988) is about their relationship. In her memoir &quot;At Seventy&quot;, Sarton reflected on Judy&#x27;s importance in her life and her (Sarton&#x27;s) Unitarian Universalist upbringing. She was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1958.

Sarton later moved to York, Maine. In 1990, she was temporarily debilitated by a stroke. Since writing was difficult, she used a tape recorder to record and transcribe her journal &quot;Endgame: A Journal of the Seventy-Ninth Year&quot; (1992). Despite her physical difficulties, she maintained her sense of independence. &quot;Endgame&quot; was followed by the journal &quot;Encore: A Journal of the Eightieth Year&quot; (1993), a celebration of Sarton&#x27;s life. She won the Levinson Prize for Poetry in 1993. Her final book, &quot;Coming Into Eighty&quot; (1995), published after her death, covers the year from July 1993 to August 1994, describing her attitude of gratitude for life as she wrestled with the experience of aging.

She died of breast cancer on July 16, 1995, and is buried in Nelson Cemetery, Nelson, New Hampshire.

==Works and themes==
May Sarton wrote 53 books, including 19 novels, 17 books of poetry, 15 nonfiction works, 2 children&#x27;s books, a play, and additional screenplays. According to &quot;The Poetry Foundation,&quot; Sarton&#x27;s style as defined by critics is &quot;calm, cultured, and urbane.&quot; In much of her writing, Sarton maintains a politically conscious lens, but what is considered May Sarton&#x27;s best and most enduring work lies in her journals and memoirs, particularly &quot;Plant Dreaming Deep&quot; (about her early years at Nelson, ca. 1958–68), &quot;Journal of a Solitude&quot; (1972–1973, often considered her best), &quot;The House by the Sea&quot; (1974–1976), &quot;Recovering&quot; (1978–1979) and &quot;At Seventy&quot; (1982–1983). In these fragile, rambling and honest accounts of her solitary life, she deals with such issues as aging, isolation, solitude, friendship, love and relationships, lesbianism, self-doubt, success and failure, envy, gratitude for life&#x27;s simple pleasures, love of nature (particularly of flowers), the changing seasons, spirituality and, importantly, the constant struggles of a creative life. Sarton&#x27;s later journals are not of the same quality, as she endeavored to keep writing through ill health and by dictation.

Although many of her earlier works, such as &quot;Encounter in April&quot;, contain vivid erotic female imagery, May Sarton often emphasized in her journals that she didn&#x27;t see herself as a &quot;lesbian&quot; writer: &quot;The vision of life in my work is not limited to one segment of humanity...and has little to do with sexual proclivity&quot;. Rather she wanted to touch on what is universally human about love in all its manifestations. When publishing her novel &quot;Mrs. Stevens Hears the Mermaids Singing&quot; in 1965, she feared that writing openly about lesbianism would lead to a diminution of the previously established value of her work. &quot;The fear of homosexuality is so great that it took courage to write &quot;Mrs. Stevens Hears the Mermaids Singing,&quot;&quot; she wrote in &quot;Journal of a Solitude&quot;, &quot;to write a novel about a woman homosexual who is not a sex maniac, a drunkard, a drug-taker, or in any way repulsive, to portray a homosexual who is neither pitiable nor disgusting, without sentimentality ...&quot; After the book&#x27;s release, many of Sarton&#x27;s works began to be studied in university level women&#x27;s studies classes, being embraced by feminists and lesbians alike.

Margot Peters&#x27; controversial authorized biography (1998) revealed May Sarton as a complex individual who often struggled in her relationships. Peters&#x27; book was often scathing (&quot;People who had the misfortune to become her intimates almost universally came to regret it. On the slightest of pretexts, Ms. Peters has it, Sarton subjected them to &#x27;terrible scenes, nights of weeping, rages, blowups.&#x27; She was expert at emotional blackmail, and behaved badly in restaurants. Self-absorbed and insensitive, May Sarton wooed others with extravagant attentions, only to betray and humiliate them later -- &#x27;with scant regard,&#x27; Ms. Peters observes, &#x27;for the chaos left in her wake.&#x27;&quot;), but the biography was considered &quot;thoughtful, even-handed, [and] well-written.&quot; A selected edition of Sarton&#x27;s letters was edited by Susan Sherman in 1997 and many of Sarton&#x27;s papers are held in the New York Public Library.

<doc id="1331732" wikidata="Q715725" url="?curid=1331732" title="Kentaro Miura">
<text>was a Japanese manga artist. He was best known for his dark fantasy series &quot;Berserk&quot;, which began serialization in 1989 and continued until his death. By 2023, &quot;Berserk&quot; had over 60 million copies in circulation, making it one of the best-selling manga series of all time. In 2002, Miura received the Award for Excellence at the sixth Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize.

==Early life and education==
Miura was born on July 11, 1966, in Chiba, Chiba Prefecture, Japan. In 1976, at the age of 10, he created his first manga, entitled &quot;Miuranger&quot;, which was published for his classmates in a school publication; the series ended up spanning 40 volumes. In 1977, Miura created his second manga, , in which he used India ink for the first time. When he was in middle school in 1979, his drawing techniques improved greatly as he started using professional drawing techniques.

While in high school in 1982, Miura enrolled in an artistic curriculum, where he and his classmates started publishing their works in school booklets. There, he befriended his later fellow manga artist . They both co-authored a science fiction which was sent to &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot;, but was shot down in the last round of selections. At age 18, Miura briefly worked as an assistant to George Morikawa, of &quot;Hajime no Ippo&quot; fame. Morikawa quickly acknowledged Miura&#x27;s high artistic level and dismissed him, saying there was nothing he could teach that Miura did not already know. By then, Miura had a dark warrior with a gigantic sword already illustrated in his portfolio.

==Career==
In 1985, Miura applied for entrance to the art college of Nihon University. He submitted a short project, , for examination and was granted admission. The project later earned him the 34th Newcomer Manga Award from &quot;Weekly Shōnen Magazine&quot;. Miura&#x27;s next work, &quot;NOA&quot;, was published in &quot;Fresh Magazine&quot; in the same year, but it was not successful. In 1988, while working for Buronson on a project titled , Miura published a prototype of &quot;Berserk&quot; in Hakusensha&#x27;s &quot;Monthly ComiComi&quot;; the 48-page prototype placed second in &quot;ComiComi&quot;″s seventh Manga School competition. The full serialization of &quot;Berserk&quot;, which would become Miura&#x27;s most famous and successful work, began in Hakusensha&#x27;s &quot;Monthly Animal House&quot; in 1989. In 1990, a sequel to &quot;King of Wolves&quot;, entitled , was published in the same magazine. In 1992, &quot;Monthly Animal House&quot; was renamed &quot;Young Animal&quot;, where &quot;Berserk&quot; continued serialization. In the same year, Miura collaborated with Buronson on the manga &quot;Japan&quot;, which was also published in &quot;Young Animal&quot;.

In 1997, Miura supervised the production of a 25-episode anime adaptation of &quot;Berserk&quot; produced by OLM, Inc., which aired in the same year on NTV. He also supervised the 1999 Dreamcast video game &quot;Sword of the Berserk: Guts&#x27; Rage&quot;. In 2002, Miura received the Award for Excellence at the sixth Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prizes for &quot;Berserk&quot;. Starting in 2006, &quot;Berserk&quot; went on frequent and often extended hiatuses, and alternated between monthly and irregular serialization. By 2023, &quot;Berserk&quot; was collected into 42 volumes in Japan, and by September 2023, it had over 60 million copies in circulation worldwide, including digital versions. The series also spawned a host of merchandise, both official and fan-made, ranging from statues, action figures to key rings, video games, and a trading card game. Various art books and supplemental materials by Miura based on &quot;Berserk&quot; were also released.

In 2013, Miura released the short standalone manga &quot;Giganto Maxia&quot;, published in English-speaking territories by Dark Horse in 2016. &quot;Duranki&quot;, a short manga produced by Miura&#x27;s personal manga studio Studio Gaga, was serialized in &quot;Young Animal Zero&quot; in 2019.

==Influences==
Miura stated that the work that had the biggest impact on his own was Buronson and Tetsuo Hara&#x27;s manga &quot;Fist of the North Star&quot; (1983 debut). Miura also cited influences from Go Nagai&#x27;s &quot;Violence Jack&quot; (1973 debut), the Japanese fantasy novel series &quot;Guin Saga&quot; (1979 debut), Paul Verhoeven films, the &quot;Hellraiser&quot; series (1987 debut), manga, Disney films, and the works of Hieronymous Bosch, M. C. Escher, Gustave Doré, and Pieter Bruegel.

==Death==
On May 6, 2021, Miura died due to acute aortic dissection, at the age of 54. His death was publicly announced on May 20, 2021. A private ceremony was held by his family.

Various manga artists offered condolences, including Kouji Mori, Miura&#x27;s high school friend, and George Morikawa, who shared a story of their friendship. People who worked on the &quot;Berserk&quot; anime adaptations also paid tribute to Miura, including Susumu Hirasawa, composer for the 1997 series; Nobutoshi Canna and Yūko Miyamura, who voiced Guts and Casca, respectively, in the 1997 series; Hiroaki Iwanaga, Guts&#x27; voice actor since the ; and singer Yoshino Nanjō, who voiced Sonia and performed the ending theme for the 2016 series&#x27; second season with Nagi Yanagi.

==Legacy==
Established as one of the best-selling manga of all time, Miura&#x27;s series &quot;Berserk&quot; impacted the manga medium and beyond, with journalist Jade King stating: &quot;[It] is difficult to overstate the tremendous impact his work has had on the world of games, manga, film, anime, and even literature.&quot; The image of Guts and his massive sword is attributed to inspiring characters like Cloud Strife of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; and Dante from the &quot;Devil May Cry&quot; series, with the overall aesthetic of &quot;Berserk&quot; inspiring the monsters and world of the &quot;Dark Souls&quot; series. Video game director Hideaki Itsuno and producer Hiroyuki Kobayashi are fans of &quot;Berserk&quot;, and the role-playing hack and slash game &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Dogma&quot; includes armor based on Guts and Griffith&#x27;s. During a GDC talk in 2019, Itsuno stated that the tone and style of &quot;Devil May Cry 5&quot; was inspired from &quot;Berserk&quot;.

Many authors have cited Miura and &quot;Berserk&quot; as influences, including &quot;Blue Exorcist&quot; author Kazue Kato, &quot;Baccano!&quot; and &quot;Durarara!!&quot; author Ryōgo Narita, &quot;Black Butler&quot; author Yana Toboso, &quot;Black Clover&quot; author Yūki Tabata, and &quot;Attack on Titan&quot; author Hajime Isayama, who called it &quot;tremendous, just magnificent [...] I got the impression that it was very well organized like a movie&quot;. Yoko Taro stated that the protagonist of &quot;Drakengard&quot;, Caim, was inspired by &quot;Berserk&quot;&#x27;s protagonist Guts.

A &quot;memorial&quot; &quot;Young Animal&quot; issue dedicated to Miura was released on September 10, 2021. Besides the inclusion of the posthumous chapter 364 of &quot;Berserk&quot;, the issue featured a special &quot;Messages to Kentarou Miura&quot; booklet and a poster of &quot;famous scenes&quot; from the manga. In the issue, manga artist Kouji Mori, Miura&#x27;s long-time friend, published a one-shot titled &quot;Mori-chan Ken-chan&quot;, which tells the story of Mori&#x27;s friendship with Miura.

On June 7, 2022, Hakusensha and Kouji Mori announced that &quot;Berserk&quot; would continue publication, using plans and thoughts that were relayed to Mori by Miura himself, as well as memoranda and character designs that Miura left behind. As the only person who knows the ending Miura intended, Mori agreed to continue the series and promised: &quot;I will only write the episodes that Miura talked to me about. I will not flesh it out. I will not write episodes that I don&#x27;t remember clearly. I will only write the lines and stories that Miura described to me.&quot; The credits appear as &quot;original work by Kentaro Miura, art by Studio Gaga, supervised by Kouji Mori&quot;.

<doc id="1331741" wikidata="Q1142459" url="?curid=1331741" title="Crème fraîche">
<text>Crème fraîche (English pronunciation: , , lit. &quot;fresh cream&quot;) is a dairy product similar to cream cheese, a soured cream containing 10–45% butterfat, with a pH of approximately 4.5. It is soured with a bacterial culture. European labeling regulations specify the two ingredients must be cream and bacterial culture. It is served over fruit and baked goods, as well as being added to soups and sauces. It is used in a variety of other recipes. Sour cream is a similar foodstuff, except that crème fraîche is less sour and has a higher fat content. Sour cream may contain thickening agents not permitted in crème fraîche in many jurisdictions.

The name is French, but similar soured creams are found in much of northern Europe, and a traditional soured cream ( in Spanish) used in Central America resembles it.

==Terminology==
A literal translation of is &quot;fresh cream.&quot; However, in French-speaking countries, may refer to either: (A) the thick fermented product, or , or (B) a liquid cream, or . In these countries, without qualification, normally refers to liquid cream, with the thick form usually called, (thick cream). In other countries, however, without qualification usually refers to the thick, fermented product.

== Production ==

Crème fraîche is produced by adding a starter culture to heavy cream and allowing it to stand at an appropriate temperature until it thickens. The culture is made up of a mix of bacteria including, &quot;Lactococcus&quot; species &quot;L. cremoris&quot;, &quot;L. lactis&quot;, and &quot;L. lactis&quot; biovar &quot;diacetylactis&quot;. These bacteria give it the taste that distinguishes it from similar dairy products such as sour cream. Recipes for cooks making crème fraîche at home may substitute cultured buttermilk with active cultures for the starter culture.

In some places in Europe, the fat content of crème fraîche is regulated, and it may not contain ingredients other than cream and starter culture.

In North America and the UK, products labeled &quot;low-fat crème fraîche&quot; with approximately 15% butterfat and with added stabilizers such as xanthan gum or starch from maize or corn, are commercialized. This product is less stable than crème fraîche when heated.

== Physico-chemical properties ==
Crème fraîche consists of double cream and a starter culture. In most places in Europe, strict regulation is placed on the production of crème fraîche, prohibiting the addition of any stabilizers, bulking agents, or emulsifiers. Standard crème fraîche contains around 30–45% milkfat while low-fat crème fraîche contains closer to 15% milkfat. During processing, the acidification of the casein micelle begins at around a pH of 6.7; however, the pH of the cream must drop to below 4.6, the isoelectric point of milk, for the casein micelles to fully precipitate out of solution. 

The structure of crème fraîche consists of an acid gel composed of milk protein-covered fat globules that tend to agglomerate. This gives the crème fraîche its stability as a highly viscous thixotropic fluid. This gel is only stable in higher fat cultured creams, around 30%, and therefore is not stable nor ubiquitous in low-fat crème fraîche. This is partly the reason why it is impossible to make a low-fat crème fraîche without the addition of stabilizers and bulking agents to generate the same texture as found in regular crème fraîche. Around 50% of the triglycerides in milk fat are long-chain triglycerides (LCT), which at refrigerator temperatures are solid. These triglycerides will tend to crystallize inside the fat globule adding to the gel&#x27;s stiffness. 

== Regions ==
The crème fraîche from Normandy is famous, and the crème fraîche from a defined area around the town of Isigny-sur-Mer in the Calvados department of Normandy is highly regarded. , it is the only cream to have an appellation d&#x27;origine contrôlée (AOC), which was awarded in 1986. It also is produced in many other parts of France, with large quantities coming from the major dairy regions of Brittany, Poitou-Charentes, Lorraine, and Champagne-Ardenne.

== Uses ==
Crème fraîche is used both hot and cold in French cuisine. It often is used to finish hot savory sauces, and with its fat content greater than 30%, curdling is not a problem. It is also the basis of many desserts and dessert sauces.

== Similar products ==
&quot;Crema Mexicana&quot; is a similar cultured sour cream that may contain several other ingredients. 

&quot;Smetana&quot; from Eastern Europe and Russia is very similar also. In Romania and Moldova, the product is called smântână.

<doc id="1331788" wikidata="Q2940113" url="?curid=1331788" title="Carowinds">
<text>Carowinds is a amusement park primarily located in Charlotte, North Carolina. Owned and operated by Six Flags Entertainment Corporation, the park first opened to the public on March 31, 1973. Carowinds straddles the state line between North and South Carolina, adjacent to Interstate 77, with a portion of the park located in Fort Mill, South Carolina. The park has a sign telling guests where the state line lies. It was constructed at a cost of $70 million following a four-year planning period led by Charlotte businessman Earl Patterson Hall. Carowinds also features Carolina Harbor, a water park that is included with park admission. Annual events include the Halloween-themed SCarowinds and the Christmas-themed WinterFest.

==History==
===Early history, Carowinds Corporation (1969-1974)===
Carowinds was announced on October 10, 1969, and originally planned on being a large resort which would include a theme park, hotels, a shopping center, a golf course, and an NFL stadium. The name &quot;Carowinds&quot; was conceived from the park&#x27;s original theme of the history and culture of the Carolinas, and is a portmanteau of &quot;Carolina&quot; and &quot;winds&quot;, in reference to the winds that blow across the two states. Ground was broken on May 1, 1970, with a planned opening date in April 1972. After numerous construction delays due to weather, the park eventually opened on March 31, 1973, under the ownership of the Carowinds Corporation, a consortium of local investors headed by Hall. The first season brought in over 1.2 million visitors, but attendance at Carowinds was curtailed by the 1973 oil crisis, and plans for the proposed resort were put on hold. Sagging attendance and mounting debt forced Carowinds Corporation to merge with Taft Broadcasting in early 1975.

===Taft Broadcasting and KECO (1975–1992)===
====1970s====
Taft originally ran the park through Family Leisure Centers, a joint venture between Taft and Top Value Enterprises (owned by the Kroger supermarket chain). It was later transferred to a wholly-owned Taft subsidiary, Kings Entertainment Company. Taft Broadcasting brought new life to the park with its Hanna-Barbera characters and several rides aimed to appeal to younger guests. Carowinds added its second roller coaster, and first wooden coaster, with the addition of Scooby-Doo in 1975. The Wagon Wheel and The Waltzer flat rides were also added to the park. A small carousel was added to the Carolina Crossroads area. In 1976, Carowinds opened Thunder Road, a Philadelphia Toboggan Coasters racing wooden coaster designed by Curtis D. Summers. It was the largest and most expensive ride built in Carowinds&#x27; short three years of existence, at a cost of $1.6 million. The trains were relocated from the defunct Jetstream roller coaster at Chicago&#x27;s Riverview Park. White Lightnin&#x27;, a Schwarzkopf launched shuttle roller coaster, opened in 1977. The Witchdoctor was relocated to Pirate Island and renamed Black Widow. The Waltzer is removed after a year of operation and Wagon Wheel is moved into its place. Trams are added to the parking lot. In 1979, a $3 million expansion adds the County Fair area, which contains four new rides. Additionally, a 1923 antique carousel built by the Philadelphia Toboggan Company is added to The Land of Hanna-Barbera.

====1980s====
The Carolina Cyclone was added in 1980 as the first roller coaster in the world to feature four inversions. Thunder Road received new Philadelphia Toboggan Coasters trains. The original themed trains were destroyed after causing damage to the tracks. Rip Roarin&#x27; Rapids, a water rapids ride, opens in 1982. In 1982, Ocean Island opens as a separately ticketed attraction between Thunder Road and the White Lightnin&#x27; roller coasters. The water park was not owned by Carowinds, and included a 700,000-gallon, 25,500 square foot wave pool that featured waves reaching heights of five feet. The complex also featured other standard water park amenities including picnic and sunbathing areas, shower and changing facilities, a snack bar, game room, raft rentals and a gift shop. Oaken Bucket was removed. The Heritage Theater was converted into an arcade. In 1984, Smurf Island opens on a 1.3 acre island surrounded by the Carolina Sternwheeler river boat. The Flying Dutchman is removed and the Paladium is expanded. Blackbeard&#x27;s Revenge, an Arrow-Huss haunted swing ride, is added in 1985.

In 1986, County Fair is renovated and Frenzoid, a 360-degree looping Viking ship, is added to the area. In 1987, Carowinds purchases Ocean Island. Vintage Jalopies is removed and the Panorama Vision theater is converted to an arcade. The following year, White Lightnin&#x27; is removed due to continuous maintenance downtime. The Balloon Race flat ride and WhiteWater Falls, a 45 foot tall water attraction is added. In 1989, Ocean Island is renamed to RipTide Reef and expanded to over 6 acres on the land previously occupied by White Lightnin&#x27;. Black Widow is removed the same year.

====Early 1990s====
In 1990, Gauntlet, a prototype thrill ride, was added to the park. The following year, the Paladium becomes a stand-alone concert facility- separate from the theme park with an expanded seating capacity of 13,000 after a $4 million renovation. In 1992, Kings Entertainment Company was acquired by Paramount Communications and Paramount Parks was formed, with the corporate headquarters a few miles away from the park in Charlotte. The same year, Carowinds introduces the Vortex stand-up roller coaster.

===Paramount era (1993–2006)===
====1990s====

The park&#x27;s name was changed to Paramount&#x27;s Carowinds in 1993. Movies and television shows from various Paramount Pictures were introduced into the park, including Days of Thunder. The Paramount Walk of Fame was constructed on the path from the park&#x27;s main entrance to the park&#x27;s central hub. In 1994, Wayne&#x27;s World, a new three acre themed area that re-creates the Hollywood set popularized in the Paramount motion picture of the same name, is added to the northwestern corner of the park with the Hurler roller coaster as its centerpiece.

In 1995, Animation Station introduces an interactive experience for kids featuring The Power Station, a three-story climbing structure, and Kids&#x27; Studio, an outdoor amphitheater for children&#x27;s shows. On June 30 of the same year, a skycoaster ride called Skycoaster opened in the Wayne&#x27;s World section. Drop Zone: Stunt Tower was also added in 1996 in the same area. The park hosted 1.8 million visitors, making it one of the largest tourist attractions in the Carolinas. In 1997, to celebrate the park&#x27;s 25th anniversary, RipTide Reef is expanded into WaterWorks, doubling its size to include 12 acres at a cost of $7.5 million. In 1998, ZOOM ZONE opens in Animation Station. The expansion adds three new attractions: Taxi Jam, Chopper Chase and Road Rally and increases the size of the area by 3.5 acres. The addition of Top Gun: The Jet Coaster in 1999 became the single-largest investment in the park&#x27;s history at a cost of $10.5 million.

====2000s====
In 2000, The Nickelodeon Flying Super Saturator takes riders along a 1,087-foot suspended track while dodging a gauntlet of gushing geysers and rain curtains and was the first of its kind roller coaster in the world. SCarowinds, the park&#x27;s annual Halloween event, is introduced for the first time in October. In 2001, the park introduced three new attractions including Scooby-Doo&#x27;s Haunted Mansion, an interactive ghost-busting experience through the former Harmony Hall, Pipeline Peak, the world&#x27;s tallest enclosed body slide and increases the size of WaterWorks to 13 acres, and the park&#x27;s first 3-D attraction, 7th Portal. Plantation Square, the park&#x27;s entrance area, is remodeled into Paramount Plaza. The Wayne&#x27;s World theming is removed and the area is converted to Thrill Zone. The following year saw the addition of Carolina Boardwalk, a newly themed area that takes guests on a walk through of the famous beaches of the Carolinas. Included in this area is the parks 11th roller coaster, Ricochet. After the success of Woodstock&#x27;s Air Rail at sister park Kings Island, Paramount decided to build a clone at Carowinds in 2003 as part of the Happy Land of Hanna Barbera&#x27;s transition into Nickelodeon Central. In 2004, Nighthawk (then known as Stealth) was relocated from California&#x27;s Great America and opened as BORG Assimilator in the location previously home to Smurf Island. Nickelodeon Central was expanded in 2005.

===Cedar Fair/Six Flags era (2006–present)===
====Late 2000s====

On January 27, 2006, the &quot;Dayton Daily News&quot; reported that CBS Corporation (successor of the original Viacom) was interested in selling the entire Paramount Parks division, including Carowinds; CBS stated that amusement parks did not fit the company&#x27;s new strategy. On May 14, 2006, Cedar Fair announced it was interested in acquiring the five Paramount theme parks from CBS Corporation. The acquisition was completed on June 30, 2006.

Although Cedar Fair continued to use the Paramount&#x27;s Carowinds name through the remainder of the 2006 season, and had a ten-year option to continue using the Paramount pre-fix, it began to phase out the Paramount name in press releases, the park website, and signage within the park. All references to Paramount-owned movies were removed immediately, with the exception of Nickelodeon Central, as Cedar Fair did not own the rights to use Paramount property. Several rides were renamed and rethemed, including BORG Assimilator (now known as Nighthawk), Drop Zone: Stunt Tower (now known as Drop Tower), and Top Gun: The Jet Coaster (now known as Afterburn). WaterWorks was expanded by four additional acres and the name was changed to Boomerang Bay in 2006. The addition of a heated lagoon and a children&#x27;s water slide were among the changes made to the existing water park.

In January 2007, a new logo was unveiled featuring the trademark Cedar Fair flag on the letter &quot;I&quot; in the Carowinds name, removing Paramount altogether. The Carolina Skytower was repainted to feature the colors of the American flag. In 2008, a second, larger wave pool was added to Boomerang Bay due to increased popularity. Yo-Yo, a flat ride from Carowinds&#x27; former sister park Geauga Lake, was also added to the park. The Nickelodeon Flying Super Saturator is closed and removed. The following year, Carolina Cobra was also relocated from Geauga Lake in the spot formerly home to the Flying Super Saturator and includes new trains. Multiple pathways were repaved and the landscaping around the park was also improved. Nighthawk is repainted from black and green to yellow and blue. It is announced that the Powder Keg Log Flume located near the front of the park would be removed for future development.

====2010s====
In 2010, Intimidator, a 232-foot tall roller coaster, opened in the space formerly occupied by the Powder Keg Log Flume. A portion of the parking lot is re-configured to accommodate the ride&#x27;s layout. Nickelodeon Central was also replaced by Planet Snoopy, introducing the &quot;Peanuts&quot; characters to the park. For 2011, the park saw general cosmetic improvements. Vortex received a new red and white color scheme, new picnic shelters were constructed in the Plaza Pavilion area, Thunder Road and Hurler had portions of their tracks reconstructed, and new seat walls, newly planted shade trees, and additional greenery was planted all around the park. In 2012, WindSeeker, a 301-foot tall swinging flat ride, opened in a filled portion of the main lagoon near Nighthawk. The park also continued to add more shade structures and replaced asphalt pathways with brick pavers throughout the park. On August 26, 2013, Cedar Fair announced a $50 million investment plan to expand Carowinds over three years starting in 2014. The expansion included a $30 million roller coaster, a $2.5 million water slide, a $7 million food complex, and $4 million to improve the park&#x27;s ticket booths and front areas. The same year, the park introduced Dinosaurs Alive!, a 5-acre walkthrough attraction.

In 2015, Fury 325, the fifth-tallest roller coaster in the world, opened as another component of the park&#x27;s previously announced &quot;top-to-bottom&quot; expansion program. A new front entrance replaced the original North Gate entrance of the park, the parking toll booths were replaced and expanded, and the parking lot was re-configured to accommodate the new entry plaza. Thunder Road is closed and demolished to make way for future development. In 2016, Boomerang Bay was re-themed and expanded into Carolina Harbor, removing the Australian theme. The expansion included a new six-slide complex, a new wave pool located on land formerly home to Thunder Road, and several new splash areas for kids. The original wave pool is demolished. For the 2017 season, the expansion of the County Fair area saw the addition of four new rides: Electro-Spin (a Mondial top scan), Zephyr (Zierer Wave Swinger), Rock N Roller (Mack Rides Music Express), and Do-Si-Do (HUSS Troika). Carolina Cobra was re-themed and renamed &quot;The Flying Cobras&quot;, with a new blue and white color scheme. The park also announced that the Wings restaurant would be expanded. WinterFest, a Christmas event in November and December that previously operated in 2005, was also reintroduced.

In 2018, Planet Snoopy was expanded and converted into Camp Snoopy with the addition of six new children&#x27;s attractions. The following year, Copperhead Strike, a double-launched roller coaster manufactured by Mack Rides, was opened in the all-new seven-acre Blue Ridge Junction area of the park and became the park&#x27;s 14th roller coaster.

====2020s====
Carowinds did not open for normal operation during the 2020 season as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. The park hosted a new holiday event, however, called &quot;Taste of the Season&quot; from November 21 – December 20, 2020. The event featured food, live shows, and other holiday activities throughout the park, as well as a select number of amusement rides. The park returned to normal operation in May 2021. In 2021, Boogie Board Racer, the longest mat racing slide in the Southeast, opened in Carolina Harbor. Retirement of the Rip Roarin&#x27; Rapids ride was also announced, along with the closure of the Dinosaurs Alive! attraction, to prepare for future development.

In July 2022, Carowinds announced the closures of Plants vs. Zombies 3Z Arena, Yo-Yo, and Southern Star attractions. As part of the new Aeronautica Landing area of the park, Air Racers, The Airwalker, Gear Spin, Gyro Force, Hover and Dodge, and Wind Star were announced as their replacements for the 2023 season. Carowinds began year-round operation in 2023, including limited park operation on weekends in January and February and Flights &amp; Bites, a seasonal offering in Harmony Hall. The park also celebrated their 50th anniversary with limited time entertainment offerings, unique food and beverage, and vintage merchandise. In accordance with their 50th anniversary milestone, Carowinds announced its new Aeronautica Landing area will open for the first time in April 2023. Aeronautica Landing, the centerpiece of Carowinds&#x27; 50th anniversary celebration, pays tribute to the Carolinas&#x27; spirit of invention and the history of flight. The new area opened on April 7. Year-round operations were discontinued at the end of the season.

On July 1, 2024, a merger of equals between Cedar Fair and Six Flags was completed, creating Six Flags Entertainment Corporation. As part of the merger, a new corporate headquarters was established in Charlotte, North Carolina, relocating Cedar Fair operations from Sandusky, Ohio, and legacy Six Flags operations from Arlington, Texas. Charlotte previously served as the headquarters of Paramount Parks, prior to its acquisition by Cedar Fair.

==Fast Lane== 
Fast Lane is a limited-access line queue system offered for an additional charge at legacy Cedar Fair amusement parks. Visitors can purchase a wristband that allows them to bypass standard lines in favor of shorter ones at many of the parks&#x27; most popular attractions.

==Carowinds Festival of Music==
The annual Carowinds Festival of Music allows music students to perform in public, receiving comments and ratings from nationally recognized adjudicators. Bands, choirs, show choirs, and orchestras can all play for ratings. Plaques and ribbons are awarded for performances that receive ratings of superior and excellent.

<doc id="1331789" wikidata="Q174012" url="?curid=1331789" title="Lepton number">
<text>In particle physics, lepton number (historically also called lepton charge)
is a conserved quantum number representing the difference between the number of leptons and the number of antileptons in an elementary particle reaction.
Lepton number is an additive quantum number, so its sum is preserved in interactions (as opposed to multiplicative quantum numbers such as parity, where the product is preserved instead). The lepton number formula_1 is defined by
formula_2
where
* formula_3 is the number of leptons and
* formula_4 is the number of antileptons.

Lepton number was introduced in 1953 to explain the absence of reactions such as
in the Cowan–Reines neutrino experiment, which instead observed
This process, inverse beta decay, conserves lepton number, as the incoming antineutrino has lepton number −1, while the outgoing positron (antielectron) also has lepton number −1.

== Lepton flavor conservation ==
In addition to lepton number, lepton family numbers are defined as
: formula_5 the electron number, for the electron and the electron neutrino;
: formula_6 the muon number, for the muon and the muon neutrino; and
: formula_7 the tau number, for the tauon and the tau neutrino.
Prominent examples of lepton flavor conservation are the muon decays
and

In these decay reactions, the creation of an electron is accompanied by the creation of an electron antineutrino, and the creation of a positron is accompanied by the creation of an electron neutrino. Likewise, a decaying negative muon results in the creation of a muon neutrino, while a decaying positive muon results in the creation of a muon antineutrino.

Finally, the weak decay of a lepton into a lower-mass lepton always results in the production of a neutrino-antineutrino pair:

One neutrino carries through the lepton number of the decaying heavy lepton, (a tauon in this example, whose faint residue is a tau neutrino) and an antineutrino that cancels the lepton number of the newly created, lighter lepton that replaced the original. (In this example, a muon antineutrino with formula_8 that cancels the muon&#x27;s formula_9.

== Violations of the lepton number conservation laws ==
Lepton flavor is only approximately conserved, and is notably not conserved in neutrino oscillation.
However, both the total lepton number and lepton flavor are still conserved in the Standard Model.

Numerous searches for physics beyond the Standard Model incorporate searches for lepton number or lepton flavor violation, such as the hypothetical decay

Experiments such as MEGA and SINDRUM have searched for lepton number violation in muon decays to electrons; MEG set the current branching limit of order and plans to lower to limit to after 2016.
Some theories beyond the Standard Model, such as supersymmetry, predict branching ratios of order to . The Mu2e experiment, in construction as of 2017, has a planned sensitivity of order .

Because the lepton number conservation law in fact is violated by chiral anomalies, there are problems applying this symmetry universally over all energy scales. However, the quantum number  is commonly conserved in Grand Unified Theory models.

If neutrinos turn out to be Majorana fermions, neither individual lepton numbers, nor the total lepton number
formula_10
nor
: 
would be conserved, e.g. in neutrinoless double beta decay, where two neutrinos colliding head-on might actually annihilate, similar to the (never observed) collision of a neutrino and antineutrino.

== Reversed signs convention ==
Some authors prefer to use lepton numbers that match the signs of the charges of the leptons involved, following the convention in use for the sign of weak isospin and the sign of strangeness quantum number (for quarks), both of which conventionally have the otherwise arbitrary sign of the quantum number match the sign of the particles&#x27; electric charges.

When following the electric-charge-sign convention, the lepton number (shown with an over-bar here, to reduce confusion) of an electron, muon, tauon, and any neutrino counts as formula_11 the lepton number of the positron, antimuon, antitauon, and any antineutrino counts as formula_12 When this reversed-sign convention is observed, the baryon number is left unchanged, but the difference  is replaced with a sum: , whose number value remains unchanged, since

<text>Wrotham ( ) is a village on the Pilgrims&#x27; Way in Kent, England, at the foot of the North Downs. It is north of Borough Green and approximately east of Sevenoaks. It is between the M20 and M26 motorways.

==History==
The name first occurs as &quot;Uurotaham&quot; in the year 788, meaning &#x27;homestead of a man called Wrōta&#x27;.
The offshoot village on Wrotham Heath at the heart of the heath of the same name, once an area of wholly common land, is to the south-east.

Wrotham shows extensive signs of occupation by the Romans and it is posited that the Wrotham Pinot, a disease-resistant variety of the Pinot noir grape found in Wrotham churchyard, is descended from vines brought by the Romans.

The church of St George is Early English and later; nearby is the site of a palace of the Archbishop of Canterbury, maintained until the time of Archbishop Simon Islip (c. 1350).

Wrotham Hill to the north was a main measuring point for the 18th-century trigonometric survey linking the Greenwich Royal Observatory with the Paris Observatory. This Anglo-French Survey (1784–1790) was led by General William Roy.

Close by is the Wrotham transmitting station which was the first transmitter in the UK to broadcast on FM in 1955 and now carries the main national FM radio frequencies for most of London.

===Hundred of Wrotham===
The parish of Wrotham formed a major part of the &quot;Hundred of Wrotham&quot;, forming 58% of its area and 61% of its population (1891)
The area and population of each parish and the totals for the Hundred were as follows: 
The Hundred of Wrotham was one of the hundreds of the Lathe of Aylesford.

==Governance==
Wrotham is a civil parish within the local government district of Tonbridge and Malling. The parish has 8 councillors elected at-large. Wrotham parish comprises the local government ward of Wrotham. which is one of the 53 seats on the Tonbridge &amp; Malling District Borough Council. The seat is held by the Conservative Martin Coffin, having been re-elected in 2011. Tonbridge &amp; Malling District Borough Council is responsible for running local services, such as recreation, refuse collection and council housing; while Kent County Council is responsible for education, social services and trading standards. Both councils are involved in town planning and road maintenance. Wrotham is part of the Electoral Division of Malling West of Kent County Council

A 2008 report showed that Wrotham has experienced one of the greatest deteriorations of basic services, losing the most amenities in the previous four years.

Wrotham is in the parliamentary constituency of Tonbridge and Malling. Since the constituency&#x27;s creation in 1974 it has been represented by two Members of Parliament: Sir John Stanley from 1974 to 2015 and Tom Tugendhat from 2015 onwards, both representing the Conservative Party.

===Administrative history===
Wrotham was an ancient parish, and was formerly significantly larger than it is today, also including Borough Green, Platt, Plaxtol and Stansted. Stansted became a separate civil parish sometime before the nineteenth century. In 1863 the parish of Wrotham was made a local government district, governed by a local board. Such districts were reconstituted as urban districts in 1894.

Although named after Wrotham, the urban district council was always based in Borough Green, which was growing to become the largest settlement in the parish following the opening of Wrotham railway station there in 1874 (renamed Borough Green and Wrotham in 1962). The council met at the Railway Hotel until 1902, then at a converted house it leased at 2 Sevenoaks Road from 1902 until 1924, before building its own headquarters at 16–18 Maidstone Road in 1924. Wrotham Urban District was abolished in 1934, with the area being absorbed into Malling Rural District and divided into the parishes of Borough Green (which also took some territory from Ightham), Platt, Plaxtol and Wrotham. Malling Rural District in turn was abolished in 1974 to become part of Tonbridge and Malling.

==Demography==
At the 2001 UK census, the Wrotham ward had a population of 1,815. The village had 759 households; of which, 42% were married couples, 29% were individuals, 9% were cohabiting couples, and 6% were lone parent families. 20% of households had someone at pensionable age living alone.

The ethnicity of the village was given as 99.2% white, 0.66% mixed race, and 0.16% Black. The place of birth of the town&#x27;s residents was 95.9% United Kingdom (92.0% England), 0.4% Republic of Ireland, 0.8% other Western Europe, 0.4% Eastern Europe, 1.0% Africa, 0.8% Asia, 0.4% North America and 0.3% elsewhere.

Religion was recorded as 74.81% Christian, 0.44% Jewish, 0.22% Buddhist, 0.17% Muslim and 0.17% Sikh. 15.46% were recorded as having no religion, 0.33% had an alternative religion, and 8.42% did not state their religion.

==Economy==

At the 2001 UK census, 39.5% of the village&#x27;s residents aged 16–74 were employed full-time, 12.9% employed part-time, 14.1% self-employed and 1.6% unemployed, while 1.9% were students with jobs, 3.4% students without jobs, 14.3% retired, 8.0% looking after home or family, 2.5% permanently sick or disabled and 1.9% economically inactive for other reasons. Compared to national figures, the village had a low rate of unemployment, and a high proportion of self-employed workers.

Employment by industry was 16% retail; 14% real estate; 13% manufacturing; 10% construction; 8% health and social work; 8% education; 7% transport and communications; 5% finance; 5% hotels and restaurants; 3% public administration; 3% agriculture; 1% energy and water supply; and 6% other. Compared to national figures, Wrotham had a high percentage of workers in agriculture; energy and water supply; hotels and restaurants; and construction. It had a low percentage in health and social work; and public administration.

According to Office for National Statistics estimates, the average gross income of households in Wrotham between April 2001 and March 2002 was £770 per week (£40,000 per year).


== Notable people==
*Peaches Geldof, English journalist, television presenter and model, lived in Wrotham. She died at her home in 2014
*Field Marshal Henry Hardinge, 1st Viscount Hardinge (1785–1856), British Army officer and politician, was born in the village
*Lieutenant Colonel Alfred Wintle (1897–1966), British Army officer and noted eccentric, died in the village

<text>York Chow Yat-ngok (; born 1947, Hong Kong), GBS, SBS, MBE, was the Secretary for Food and Health of Hong Kong and a member of the Executive Council. He was appointed as Secretary for Health, Welfare and Food in 2004. The position has since been renamed to Secretary for Food and Health from reshuffling in 2007.

==History==
Chow is an orthopaedic surgeon by profession. He was appointed Hospital Chief Executive of Queen Mary Hospital in 2001. Chow was appointed a Vice-President of the International Paralympic Committee in 1997.

During his studies in the University of Hong Kong since 1967, he stayed in St. John&#x27;s College and has served as the male sports captain in the academic years 1968–1969.

==Controversies==

===2011 June protest===
On 25 June 2011, a small protest was held by about ten mothers begging on the street for the attention of Chow regarding the mainland Chinese mothers birth tourism issues with hospital capacities. These are families that have a mainland mother and a Hong Kong father. Chow did sympathise with these couples, but nothing was done after the protest. The issue later expanded to the Early 2012 Hong Kong protests which was also triggered by Kong Qingdong&#x27;s comment.

<text>Jean Marie Antoine Louis de Lanessan (13 July 1843 – 7 November 1919) was a French statesman and naturalist.

==Biography==
De Lanessan was born in Saint-André-de-Cubzac in the Gironde department of France and entered the French Navy in 1862, serving on the East African and Cochin-China stations in the medical department until the Franco-Prussian War, when he resigned and volunteered for the army medical service. He then completed his studies, taking his doctorate in 1872.

Elected to the Municipal Council of Paris in 1879, de Lanessan declared in favor of communal autonomy and joined with Henri Rochefort in demanding the erection of a monument to the Communards; but after his election to the Chamber of Deputies for the 5th arrondissement of Paris in 1881 he gradually veered from the extreme Radical party to the Republican Union, and identified himself with the cause of colonial expansion.

A government mission to the French colonies in 1886-1887, in connection with the approaching Paris exhibition, gave him the opportunity of studying colonial questions, on which, after his return, he published three works: &quot;La Tunisie&quot; (Paris, 1887); &quot;L&#x27;Expansion coloniale de la France&quot; (Paris, 1888), &quot;L&#x27;Indo-Chine francaise&quot; (Paris, 1889). In 1891 he was made civil and military governor of French Indochina, where his administration, which led to open rupture with Admiral Fournier, was severely criticized. Nevertheless, he consolidated French influence in Annam and Cambodia, and secured a large accession of territory on the Mekong River from the kingdom of Siam. He was recalled in 1894, and published a justification of his administration (&quot;La Colonisation française en Indo-Chine&quot;) in the following year.

In the Waldeck-Rousseau cabinet of 1899 to 1902 he was Minister of Marine, and in 1901 he secured the passage of a naval programme intended to raise the French navy during the next six years to a level befitting the place of France among the great powers. At the general elections of 1906 and 1914 he was not re-elected, and retired from politics. He was political director of Le Siècle, and president of the French Colonization Society, and he wrote, besides the books already mentioned, various works on political and biological questions. He died at Écouen, then in Seine-et-Oise.

De Lanessan was an advocate of neo-Lamarckian evolution.

<text>William Turton (21 May 1762 – 28 December 1835) was an English physician and naturalist. He is known for his pioneering work in conchology, and for translating Linnaeus&#x27; &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; into English.

== Biography ==

He was born at Olveston, Gloucestershire and was educated at Oriel College, Oxford. He commenced in practice as a physician at Swansea, where he worked for fifteen years. He then moved in turn to Dublin, Teignmouth, and Torquay. He devoted his leisure time to natural history, especially conchology. He published several illustrated shell books, and a translation of Gmelin&#x27;s edition of Linnaeus&#x27; &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; in 1806. His works on conchology have been described as &quot;seminal&quot;.

In 1817, while he was a physician at Teignmouth, he treated Tom Keats, youngest brother of the Romantic poet John Keats, for consumption.

He moved to Bideford, Devon, in 1831, and died there. His shell collection is now located at the Smithsonian Institution.

The bivalve genus &quot;Turtonia&quot; (J. Alder, 1848) and the species &quot;Galeomma turtoni&quot; are named for him.

<doc id="1331806" wikidata="Q3889635" url="?curid=1331806" title="Toy problem">
<text>In scientific disciplines, a toy problem or a puzzlelike problem is a problem that is not of immediate scientific interest, yet is used as an expository device to illustrate a trait that may be shared by other, more complicated, instances of the problem, or as a way to explain a particular, more general, problem solving technique. A toy problem is useful to test and demonstrate methodologies. Researchers can use toy problems to compare the performance of different algorithms. They are also good for game designing.

For instance, while engineering a large system, the large problem is often broken down into many smaller toy problems which have been well understood in detail. Often these problems distill a few important aspects of complicated problems so that they can be studied in isolation. Toy problems are thus often very useful in providing intuition about specific phenomena in more complicated problems.

As an example, in the field of artificial intelligence, classical puzzles, games and problems are often used as toy problems. These include sliding-block puzzles, N-Queens problem, missionaries and cannibals problem, tic-tac-toe, chess, Tower of Hanoi and others.

<text>William Morris Hunt (March 31, 1824September 8, 1879) was an American painter.

Born into the political Hunt family of Vermont, he trained in Paris with the realist Jean-François Millet and studied under him at the Barbizon artists’ colony, before founding a similar group on his return to America. He became Boston&#x27;s leading portrait and landscape painter, also working as a lithographer and sculptor. In 1871 he was elected to the National Academy of Design as an Associate Academician. Many of his works were destroyed in the Great Boston Fire of 1872. Another disaster was the deterioration of the stone panels in the State Capitol at Albany, New York, on which a number of his murals had been painted. This is believed to have led to his depression and presumed suicide.

==Life and career==
William Morris Hunt was born into prominence. The family of Hunt&#x27;s father Jonathan Hunt, were among Vermont&#x27;s founders and largest landowners; his mother&#x27;s a family of wealth and prominence in Connecticut. Hunt attended Harvard College but withdrew in his junior year. Having been denied the opportunity to paint and draw by an overbearing father, Jane Leavitt Hunt resolved that her children would be given the chance to study the arts in the best academies—even if it meant moving to Europe to attend them.

Following the death of his congressman father from cholera in 1832 at the age of 44, Hunt&#x27;s mother Jane took him and his brothers to Switzerland, the South of France and to Rome, where Hunt studied with Thomas Couture in Paris, coming under the influence of Jean-François Millet after being greatly inspired by Millet&#x27;s The Sower at the 1851 Paris Salon. The Hunt family remained in Europe for a dozen years. During part of that time, William Morris Hunt and his brother Richard Morris Hunt shared an apartment at 1 rue Jacob, close by the École des Beaux-Arts, where William studied painting under Couture. &quot;From the training and inspiration each of the brothers was to experience in the next several years in France would come great strides for each in his work,&quot; writes historian David McCullough. &quot;&#x27;Mr. William Hunt is our most promising artist here,&#x27; reported Thomas Appleton to his father.&quot; Hunt then spent the next two years under the tutelage of Millet in Barbizon before his return to the states.

The companionship of Millet had a lasting influence on Hunt&#x27;s character and style, and his work grew in strength, in beauty and in seriousness. He was among the biggest proponents of the Barbizon school in America, and he more than any other turned the rising generation of American painters towards Paris. About his influence, S. G. W. Benjamin wrote in a posthumous assessment of Hunt:

After leaving Paris, Hunt painted and used his family connections to establish art schools in Newport, Rhode Island, Brattleboro, Vermont, the Faial Island in the Azores, and finally in Boston, where he became a popular portrait painter.

Before his lauded return to America in 1855, Hunt was married in Paris to Louise Dumaresq Perkins, daughter of Thomas Handasyd Perkins Jr. (son of Thomas Handasyd Perkins), a Boston merchant, philanthropist and patron of the arts. Hunt was married to Perkins again upon his return to Boston in 1855, perhaps for legal reasons. Hunt was married for the second time in the influential King&#x27;s Chapel in Boston by academic and clergyman Ephraim Peabody, shortly before Peabody&#x27;s death in 1856.

On his return, Hunt painted some of his most handsome canvases, all reminiscent of his life in France and of Millet&#x27;s influence. Such works include &quot;The Belated Kid&quot;, &quot;Girl at the Fountain&quot;, &quot;Hurdy-Gurdy Boy&quot;, and others – but the public called for portraits, and it became the fashion to sit for Hunt; among his best paintings of this genre are those of William M. Evarts, Mrs. Charles Francis Adams, the Rev. James Freeman Clarke, Senator Charles Sumner, William H. Gardner, Chief Justice Shaw and Judge Horace Gray.

Many of Hunt&#x27;s paintings and sketches, together with five large Millets and other art treasures collected by him in Europe, were destroyed in the Great Boston Fire of 1872. Hunt owned many canvases by Millet, including Millet&#x27;s &quot;The Sower&quot;, for which Millet somewhat unwillingly accepted a payment of $60 from Hunt.

Among his later works, American landscapes predominated. In the summer of 1878, the year before his death, Hunt painted a series of sweeping views of Niagara Falls. His later works also include the &quot;Bathers: Twice Painted&quot; and &quot;The Allegories&quot; for the Assembly Chamber of the State Capitol at Albany, New York, now lost due to disintegration of the stone panels on which they were painted (some scholars trace Hunt&#x27;s deepening depression that led to his suicide to his despair over the loss of the Albany murals). His book, &quot;Talks about Art&quot; (London, 1878), was especially well received.

Nor did Hunt confine himself to oil painting. He was prolific, working as a lithographer and sculptor as well. From 1850 to 1877, the Vermont native was Boston&#x27;s leading portrait and landscape painter; there was a backlog of Brahmins clamoring to be painted by him. Hunt is widely credited for having influenced the styles of Winslow Homer, Childe Hassam and John Joseph Enneking. Hunt&#x27;s signature lively brushwork, partly derived from study of contemporary European painting, marked a new phase in &#x27;oil sketching&#x27; that was carried on by Homer and others. Other friends and associates included artist Frank Hill Smith.

&quot;The greatest of Boston painters&quot;, writes art historian G. W. Sheldon in his &quot;American Painters&quot;, &quot;and one of the few really great American painters, Mr. William Morris Hunt, was born in Brattleboro, Vermont.&quot; While a friend and student of Millet, &quot;Hunt is an entirely original artist, and every picture of his is a spontaneous and independent product.&quot; In a bit of art history revisionism, some scholars are now re-examining Hunt&#x27;s powerful pull on other early New England artists, many better-known. Hunt was an important figure in New England arts and society. Besides collecting himself, Hunt encouraged other Boston collectors to buy works by European artists such as Millet, Monet and others.

After one early exhibition of French artists at the Boston Athenaeum, including works by Millet and Rousseau, for instance, an art professor at Harvard had written a condemnation in a Boston newspaper. Outraged, painter Hunt fired back a response in &quot;The Boston Daily Advertiser&quot;. &quot;It is not our fault we inherit ignorance in art,&quot; Hunt wrote, &quot;but we are not obliged to advertise it.&quot;

In 1867, for instance, Hunt and his wife sailed to Paris to attend the opening of the Exposition Universelle. In his lectures and art classes, Hunt attracted large numbers of students, many of them from prominent Brahmin families. The Boston philosopher and author William James studied with Hunt for a time, before turning away from painting to concentrate on his writing. In 1871 Hunt was elected to the National Academy of Design as an Associate Academician.

Hunt&#x27;s career owed a debt to Boston&#x27;s intellectual ferment. A luncheon at his club on February 27, 1870, for instance, found these members of Hunt&#x27;s circle dining together: Ralph Waldo Emerson; James Russell Lowell; Henry Wadsworth Longfellow; Edward Clarke Cabot; Martin Brimmer; Thomas Gold Appleton; William James; Francis Blackwell Forbes; and James T. Fields. Joining the group as guest was Erastus Brigham Bigelow, a founder of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

William Morris Hunt died at the Isles of Shoals, New Hampshire, in 1879, apparently a suicide. Hunt had gone to the New Hampshire shore to recover from a crippling depression. But he continued to work, executing his last sketch three days before his death. His body was discovered by his friend, New Hampshire poet Celia Thaxter.

His brother Richard Morris Hunt was a celebrated architect. Another brother, Leavitt Hunt, was a well-known photographer and attorney. A fourth brother, Jonathan, was a Paris physician who also committed suicide.

The William Morris Hunt Library of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts is named in honor of this painter. (Hunt was a founding member of the Museum of Fine Arts&#x27; museum school). Following Hunt&#x27;s death, his Harvard classmates and other Bostonians contributed to a fund to purchase many of his paintings and donate them to the Museum of Fine Arts.

Aside from the Museum of Fine Arts, the Boston Athenaeum has a number of the artist&#x27;s works in its collection, a gift of William Morris Hunt II. Also owning works by Hunt are New York City&#x27;s Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Louvre Museum in Paris, the Musée d&#x27;Orsay in Paris, the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., the Addison Gallery of American Art at Hunt&#x27;s alma mater Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., the Bennington Museum, Vermont, the Bowdoin College Museum of Art, the Brooklyn Museum of Art, the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh, the Currier Museum of Art in New Hampshire, the Harvard University Art Museums, Salem&#x27;s Peabody Essex Museum, the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and many others.

In accordance with a long expressed desire, William Morris Hunt was buried at Prospect Hill cemetery in Brattleboro, Vermont, beside other family members. Two decades after Hunt&#x27;s death, his former pupil Helen Mary Knowlton published her biography of the Boston painter entitled &quot;The Art-Life of William Morris Hunt&quot;.

Morris sat for a full-length portrait by the artist Emanuel Leutze in Düsseldorf in 1864. Formerly part of the collection of Col. Leavitt Hunt at &quot;Elmshome&quot; in Vermont, the location of that portrait is now unknown.

==Personal life==
William Morris Hunt and his wife, the former Louisa Dumaresq Perkins, had five children. His daughter Eleanor &quot;Ellen&quot; (1858–1941) married German officer of the Prussian Army Ernst Curt Sigismond Diederich (1851–1887). One of their children was the artist Wilhelm Hunt Diederich.

<text>Illinois Route 113 (IL 113) is a two-lane state route that runs east from IL 47 north of Mazon and east of Seneca to IL 17 in western Kankakee, just across the Kankakee River from U.S. Route 45 (US 45) and US 52.

== Route description ==
Route 113 begins at a junction with Route 47 in Grundy County north of Mazon. From here, the route heads east through a rural area before passing through Coal City and Diamond. At the eastern edge of Diamond, Route 113 meets Interstate 55. Past this junction, the route turns southward, entering Braidwood along Division Street. The highway turns east onto Main Street and intersects Illinois Route 129 and Illinois Route 53 at separate junctions. After leaving Braidwood to the east, Route 113 follows the southern bank of the Kankakee River; Illinois Route 102 parallels this stretch of the route on the northern bank of the river. At Custer Park, the route crosses the Wauponsee Glacial Trail. Past Custer Park, the route runs past Kankakee River State Park. It then meets County Route 20, which crosses the river and connects Route 113 to Route 102. Past this junction, Route 113 enters Kankakee County. The road continues to follow the river into Kankakee, where it terminates at Route 17.

== History ==
SBI Route 113 was the name of both roads on the north and south sides of the Kankakee River from Diamond (between Coal City and Braidwood on Interstate 55) to Kankakee. In 1940, the route became &quot;Illinois Route 113N&quot; and &quot;Illinois Route 113S&quot;, with 113N as the northern route and 113S as the southern, with 113S used as the western end to &quot;U.S. Route 66&quot; (now Interstate 55). In 1961, Illinois 113S became Illinois Route 113, and 113N was redesignated Illinois Route 102.

<text>James Freeman Clarke (April 4, 1810 – June 8, 1888) was an American minister, theologian and author.

==Biography==
Born in Hanover, New Hampshire, on April 4, 1810, James Freeman Clarke was the son of Samuel Clarke and Rebecca Parker Hull, though he was raised by his grandfather James Freeman, minister at King&#x27;s Chapel in Boston, Massachusetts. He attended the Boston Latin School, and later graduated from Harvard College in 1829, and Harvard Divinity School in 1833.

Ordained into the Unitarian church he first became an active minister at Louisville, Kentucky, then a slave state, and soon threw himself into the national movement for the abolition of slavery. His theology was unusual for the conservative town and, reportedly, several women walked out of his first sermon. As he wrote to his friend Margaret Fuller, &quot;I am a broken-winged hawk, seeking to fly at the sun, but fluttering in the dust.&quot;

In 1840, he returned to Boston where he and his friends established (1841) the Church of the Disciples which brought together a body of people to apply the Christian religion to social problems of the day. One of the features that distinguished his church was Clarke&#x27;s belief that ordination could make no distinction between him and them. They also were called to be ministers of the highest religious life. Of this church he was the minister from 1841 until 1850 and again from 1854 until his death. He was also secretary of the Unitarian Association and, in 1867-1871, professor of natural religion and Christian doctrine at Harvard.

Clarke contributed essays to &quot;The Christian Examiner&quot;, &quot;The Christian Inquirer&quot;, &quot;The Christian Register&quot;, &quot;The Dial&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;The Index&quot;, and &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot;. In addition to sermons, speeches, hymnals, and liturgies, he published 28 books and over 120 pamphlets during his lifetime.

Clarke edited the &quot;Western Messenger&quot;, a magazine intended to carry to readers in the Mississippi Valley simple statements of liberal religion and what were then the most radical appeals to national duty and the abolition of slavery. Copies of this magazine are now valued by collectors for containing the earliest printed poems of Ralph Waldo Emerson, a personal friend and a distant cousin. Clarke became a member of the Transcendental Club alongside Emerson and several others.

For the &quot;Western Messenger&quot;, Clarke requested written contributions from Margaret Fuller. Clarke published Fuller&#x27;s first literary review—criticisms of recent biographies on George Crabbe and Hannah More.

She later became the first full-time book reviewer in journalism working for Horace Greeley&#x27;s &quot;New York Tribune&quot;. After Fuller&#x27;s death in 1850, Clarke worked with William Henry Channing and Emerson as editors of &quot;The Memoirs of Margaret Fuller Ossoli&quot;, published in February 1852. The trio censored or reworded many of Fuller&#x27;s letters; they believed the public interest in Fuller would be temporary and that she would not survive as a historical figure. Nevertheless, for a time, the book was the best-selling biography of the decade and went through thirteen editions before the end of the century.

In 1855, Clarke purchased the former site of Brook Farm, intending to start a new Utopian community there. This never came to pass, instead the land was offered to President Abraham Lincoln during the American Civil War; the Second Massachusetts Regiment used it for training and named it &quot;Camp Andrew&quot;.

In November 1861, Clarke was in Washington, D.C., with Samuel Gridley Howe and Julia Ward Howe. After hearing the song &quot;John Brown&#x27;s Body&quot;, he suggested that Mrs. Howe write new lyrics; the result was &quot;Battle Hymn of the Republic&quot;.

The people of Boston held a public celebration honoring Italian unification on February 23, 1871, featuring Edwin Percy Whipple as a speaker and a poem by Clarke titled &quot;A Hymn for the Celebration of Italian Unity&quot; based on the &quot;Battle Hymn of the Republic&quot;. In 1874, he was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society.

A portrait of Clarke painted by Edwin Tryon Billings hangs in the Boston Public Library.

==Beliefs==
Clarke was an advocate of human rights. Being a Boston Latin School alumnus, he served on a committee of the Massachusetts Society for the University Education of Women which was greatly instrumental in establishing Girls&#x27; Latin School in 1878. Tempered and moderate in his views of life, he was a reformer and a conciliator and never carried a pistol as fellow preacher Theodore Parker did.

Clarke believed in recognizing women&#x27;s right to vote. In a statement published posthumously, Clarke had written, &quot;one of the most important of the reforms proposed at the present time is that which shall give suffrage to women. It is not merely a political question, but a social question, a moral question, and a religious question&quot;.

He published few verses, but is regarded by some as a poet at heart. A diligent scholar, among the books by which he became well known is one called &quot;Ten Great Religions&quot; (2 vols, 1871–1883). Many of Clarke&#x27;s earlier published writings addressed the immediate need of establishing a larger theory of religion than that espoused by people who were still under the influence of Calvinism. He was also one of the first Americans to explore and write about Eastern religions.

<text>Vassilis Papazachos (; 30 September 1929 – 10 November 2022) was a Greek seismologist and author of &quot;Earthquakes of Greece&quot;.

Born on 30 September 1929 in the village of &quot;Smokovo&quot; in Karditsa regional unit, Vassilis Papazachos studied physics in the University of Athens, Greece. He received a M.Sc. in geophysics from Saint Louis University (1963) and a doctorate in Seismology from the University of Athens (1961). He first became involved in geophysics as an assistant of professor Angelos Galanopoulos (1955–1956) and then moved to the Geodynamic Institute of the National Observatory of Athens (1956–1977). Later in his career he became Professor of Seismology in the Aristotle University (1977–1998), where he was still active as an emeritus professor.

Papazachos always attracted publicity in his country Greece, which is highly seismogenic and has been tormented by many earthquakes both in historic and prehistoric times. He was an ardent opposer of Panayotis Varotsos and the VAN method for earthquake prediction, which he called &quot;the greatest science joke of the century&quot;.

Vassilis Papazachos was also involved in Greek politics for long time. A supporter of the left, he was asked by the Communist Party of Greece to lead their ticket and run for mayor of Thessaloniki, but he refused, saying that such active involvement would distract him from his scientific work. However, he eventually ran for mayor in his birthplace with the support of the Synaspismos party of the radical left. He was also a candidate state MP in the 2000 Greek legislative election, again for Synaspismos.

<text>Francophone literature is literature written in the French language. The existence of a plurality of literatures in the French language has been recognised, although the autonomy of these literatures is less defined than the plurality of literatures written in the English language. Writings in the French language from Belgium, Canada and Switzerland were recognised as belonging to distinct traditions long before writings from colonial territories of France. Writing in French by Africans was formerly classified as &quot;colonial literature&quot; and discussed as part of colonial studies for its ethnographical interest, rather than studied for its literary merit. Any texts in French from the colonies and territories that were considered to have merit were subsumed under the classification of French literature. The nature and importance of Francophone literature in various territories of the former French Empire depends on the concentration of French settlers, the length of time spent in colonial status, and how developed indigenous languages were as literary languages. It was only following the Second World War that a distinction started to be made in literary studies and anthologies between French literature and other writing in French. In 1960 Maurice Bémol published &quot;Essai sur l&#x27;orientation des littératures de langue française au XXe siècle&quot;; the plural in the title emphasised the study&#x27;s new approach of examining the level of autonomy of the languages.

Paris remains the most powerful centre of Francophone publishing, although important publishers have developed elsewhere, notably in Quebec where influential publishing houses have long attracted Francophone writers from across the world.

The term has historically been used to refer only to literature from Francophone countries outside France, but modern usage includes any literature written in French. Francophone literature therefore applies to the whole French-speaking world in the broadest sense of the term.

==Early life and education==
Born on 15 September 1972 in Singapore, Chan is the third daughter in a family of four sisters.

Chan studied in Fairfield Methodist School, Raffles Girls&#x27; School, Raffles Junior College and Lasalle-SIA College of the Arts. During Chan&#x27;s six-year hiatus from the music scene from 2004 to 2010, she returned to LaSalle as a mature student. She wrote a thesis on the psychology of performance and graduated with first-class honors.

==Career==
Since her debut in 1993, Chan has worked in singing, theatre, television drama, poetry, song-writing, entrepreneurship and creative direction. In 1994, Chan released the album &quot;Heartache&quot; (心痛) into the Taiwanese market. She subsequently released more albums regionally including &quot;Liking You&quot; (喜欢你), &quot;Dazzling&quot; (炫耀), and &quot;Worried&quot; (担心), performing in parts of Asia, the United States, Korea, and New Zealand, as well as collaborating with symphonies and orchestras in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore.

Chan performed a song, &quot;Home&quot;, during the 1998 Singapore National Day Parade which became very popular in Singapore. It was subsequently performed in various editions of the National Day Parades.

Chan took a hiatus in 2004 from her performing career to further her studies and joined international PR consultancy Hill &amp; Knowlton as a campaign specialist in 2007. She worked on the Ministry of Defence&#x27;s 2009 Total Defence campaign, &#x27;What Will You Defend?&#x27;. She left the company after 19 months.

Chan has also worked linguistically and theatrically, with her Cantopop, and English albums. She has held lead roles in the Hong Kong musical &quot;Snow.Wolf.Lake&quot; with Jacky Cheung – both the Cantonese version in 1997 and the Mandarin production in 2005 – followed by &quot;The Legend&quot; (where she played the late Teresa Teng), and &quot;Forbidden City: Portrait of An Empress&quot; (where she played the young Empress Dowager Cixi)– first performed in 2002 as part of the Esplanade&#x27;s opening programme, and again in 2003. Chan has also played the lead in the Dutch-Hong Kong production of &quot;East Meets West&quot;, and the Taiwanese musical &quot;What&#x27;s Love Got to Do with It?&quot;.

In September 2006, she reprised her role again in &quot;Forbidden City: Portrait of an Empress&quot;, as part of a plan to make this musical internationally recognized, in the hope of going on a world tour. Chan later fronted the first Singapore Day in New York City in 2007. After her corporate sojourn, Chan performed the commissioned theme song &quot;One World&quot; at the APEC 2009 Gala Night and returned the theatre as leading lady (Li Qing) in the Mandarin musical &quot;December Rains&quot; (雨季) at Esplanade Theatre in 2010. In the same year, she sang &quot;Home&quot; for the third time at the National Day Parade. Chan was also a member of the cast of the television drama &quot;Healing Hands II&quot;, the sequel to TVB&#x27;s medical drama &quot;Healing Hands&quot; in 2000. She was the female lead in SPH MediaWorks Channel U&#x27;s drama serial &quot;Cash is King&quot;. Chan also acted in the 2010 film &quot;Lover&#x27;s Discourse&quot;.

In 2011, Chan released her first studio album &quot;Re-interpreting Kit Chan&quot; (重譯 陳潔儀) since 2004 and staged two solo concerts in collaboration with the Singapore Chinese Orchestra at Esplanade Concert Hall, as the anchor performance of the Huayi Chinese Festival of Arts 2011. In the same year, she held her three-night solo concert &quot;The Music Room&quot; at the Marina Bay Sands Grand Theater. Also in 2011, Chan worked with Nexus, Ministry of Defence as Creative Director for the Total Defence &quot;Home – Keeping It Together&quot; Campaign 2011. She was also executive producer for the remake of the &quot;Home&quot; MV, which featured 39 local artistes spanning different genres, eras and races, including Max Surin, Dick Lee, Taufik Batisah, JJ Lin, and Stefanie Sun. She wrote the theme song 倔强 for the MediaCorp Channel 8 anniversary drama &quot;Devotion&quot;, which won Best Drama Theme Song award at the 2012 Star Awards. Concerts themed &quot;An Enchanted Evening with Chiu Tsang Hei&quot; (傾城) were also held in Hong Kong.

In 2014, Chan performed in her first leading film role in Jason Lai&#x27;s &quot;Miss J Contemplates Her Choice&quot; as the titular Miss J, who offers advice to callers on a radio talk show. The film premiered at the Singapore International Film Festival in December. In 2014, Chan reportedly underwent a surgical procedure that left her barely able to speak, however she completed her &#x27;Spellbound&#x27; concert eventually in 2015 at Star Theatre. She also participated in China reality singing contest &quot;I Am A Singer&quot; where Chinese critic Deng Ke remarked that Kit Chan can&#x27;t sing. She announced her retirement from performing at the National Day Parades in 2015 after making her last NDP performance. In 2015, she sang the theme song for Channel 8 Blockbuster The Dream Makers II.

In July 2016, she released her first album of original material in 12 years, titled &quot;The Edge of Paradise&quot; (天堂边缘). In September, Chan ended her Spellbound concert tour with a finale at Singapore Indoor Stadium to a 7,000-strong audience.

In 2018, Chan marked her 25th anniversary as a singer with an acoustic live sessions album in which she also penned the lyrics for the title track “A Time for Everything”. She also staged “25 Years On: A Time For Everything” concerts in Singapore and Taipei.

Chan has published a collection of her English poems, &quot;Cork out of my Head&quot;, in 2000 in Taiwan, &quot;I Write a Page&quot; in 2000 in Singapore, and a fiction book (together with her friend, Siew Fern Yong) titled &quot;Cathy and Jodie: The Princess and the Flea&quot;.

In 2022, Chan performed in &quot;The LKY Musical&quot;, where she performed as the late Madam Kwa Geok Choo, the wife of Singapore’s founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew.

==Community involvement==
In 1998, Chan was appointed as the first National Youth Ambassador for Singapore&#x27;s National Youth Council. She served for two years. From 2001 to 2005, she served as a council member with the National Youth Council. In 2002 the Commonwealth Youth Programme Asia Centre awarded her an Award for Excellence in Youth Work.

In 2007, Chan was appointed to the board of the National Heritage Board over a two-year period, reaching out to the Singapore audience and linking with the creative industries.

She is also the ambassador to the Christian relief organization &quot;World Vision&quot;.

==Business ventures==
Chan has invested in two boutiques in Singapore, Flowers in the Attic and Roses in the Loft.

In 2010, Chan set up her own record label, named after her singing group Banshee Empire from when she was in secondary school.

It was reported that Chan married her long-time boyfriend in 2012 and divorced in 2017. 

However, during an interview on “The Assembly”, aired on news network CNA in January 2025, Chan clarified that although she held a “wedding dinner” she was never legally married and hence, was never divorced.

<doc id="1331845" wikidata="Q2471023" url="?curid=1331845" title="Nick Carter (character)">
<text>Nick Carter is a fictional character who began as a dime novel private detective in 1886 and has appeared in a variety of formats over more than a century. The character was first conceived by Ormond G. Smith and created by John R. Coryell. Carter headlined his own magazine for years, and was then part of a long-running series of novels from 1964 to 1990. Films were created based on Carter in France, Czechoslovakia and Hollywood. Nick Carter has also appeared in many comic books and in radio programs.

==Literary history==

Nick Carter first appeared in the story paper &quot;New York Weekly&quot; (Vol. 41 No. 46, September 18, 1886) in a 13-week serial, &quot;The Old Detective&#x27;s Pupil; or, The Mysterious Crime of Madison Square&quot;; the character was conceived by Ormond G. Smith, the son of one of the founders of Street &amp; Smith, and realized by John R. Coryell. Coryell retired from writing Nick Carter novels and the series was taken over by Frederick Van Rensselaer Dey, who wrote 1,076 novels and stories from 1890 until his suicide in 1922. The character proved popular enough to headline its own magazine, &quot;Nick Carter Weekly&quot;. The serialized stories in &quot;Nick Carter Weekly&quot; were also reprinted as stand-alone titles under the New Magnet Library imprint. By 1915, &quot;Nick Carter Weekly&quot; had ceased publication and Street &amp; Smith had replaced it with &quot;Detective Story Magazine&quot;, which focused on a more varied cast of characters. There was a brief attempt at reviving Carter in 1924–27 in &quot;Detective Story Magazine&quot;, but it was not successful.

In the 1930s, due to the success of &quot;The Shadow&quot; and &quot;Doc Savage&quot;, Street &amp; Smith revived Nick Carter in a pulp magazine (called &quot;Nick Carter Detective Magazine&quot;) that ran from 1933 to 1936. Since the Doc Savage character had basically been given Nick&#x27;s background, Nick Carter was now recast as more of a hard-boiled detective. Novels featuring Carter continued to appear through the 1950s, by which time there was also a popular radio show, &quot;Nick Carter, Master Detective&quot;, which aired on the Mutual Broadcasting System network from 1943 to 1955.

===Killmaster revival===
Following the success of the James Bond series in the 1960s, the character was updated for a long-running series of novels featuring the adventures of secret agent Nick Carter, aka the Killmaster. The first book, &quot;Run Spy Run&quot;, appeared in 1964 and more than 260 Nick Carter-Killmaster adventures were published up until 1990.

Two additional books have been erroneously listed as Killmaster novels by some sources: &quot;Meteor Eject!&quot;, a memoir by an RAF pilot named Nick Carter, published in 2000, and a 2005 release entitled &quot;Brotherhood&quot;, which is actually an autobiography of singer Nick Carter of the Backstreet Boys.

The 100th Killmaster novel—&quot;Nick Carter 100&quot;—was accompanied by an essay on the 1890s version, and a short story featuring the character; that marked one of the few times the Killmaster series acknowledged its historical roots.

None of the Nick Carter series of books carried author credits, although it is known that several of the earliest volumes were written by Michael Avallone, and that Valerie Moolman and &quot;NYT&quot; bestselling author Gayle Lynds wrote others, making this the first series of its kind to be written in significant part by women. Bill Crider is another author identified with Nick Carter.

The Nick Carter name was treated as if it were a pseudonym, and many of the volumes were written in the first person.

==Authors==
The works were published under the house pseudonyms &quot;Nicholas Carter&quot; and &quot;Sergeant Ryan&quot;.
Authors known to have contributed include the following:
* John R. Coryell (1848–1924)
* Frederick W. Davis (1858–1933), who wrote eight Nick Carter stories for &quot;The New Nick Carter Weekly&quot; in 1910 and 1912, as well as writing extensively under the pen name &quot;Scott Campbell&quot;
* Frederick Van Rensselaer Dey (1861–1922), who took his own life
* Thomas C. Harbaugh (1849–1924), who died penniless in the Miami County Home in Ohio
* George C. Jenks (1850-1929)
* Eugene T. Sawyer (1847–1924)
* Charles Westerbrook
* Richard Edward Wormser (1908–1977), who claimed to have written 17 Carter magazine stories published in 1932–33

Stories are also credited to Harrison Keith, the joint pseudonym of John A. L. Chambliss and Philip Clark, who both wrote for the franchise.

==Books==
===New Magnet Library===
==Films==
The character has had a long and varied film history, with three countries producing films based on it.

===France===

====Éclair====
In 1908, the French film company Éclair engaged Victorin-Hippolyte Jasset to make a serial film based on the Nick Carter novels which were then being published in France by the German publisher Eichler. &quot;Nick Carter, le roi des détectives&quot;, with Pierre Bressol in the title role, was released in six episodes in late 1908, and enjoyed considerable success. Further adaptations followed with &quot;Nouvelles aventures de Nick Carter&quot; in 1909, and the character was revived for a confrontation with a master criminal in &quot;Zigomar contre Nick Carter&quot; in 1912.

====1960s====
American actor Eddie Constantine played the title roles in the French-made spy films &quot;Nick Carter va tout casser&quot; (1964) and &quot;Nick Carter et le trèfle rouge&quot; (1965). In one curiously circular and self-referential scene, Constantine (as Carter) enters a house where he finds a large collection of &quot;Nick Carter&quot; pulp magazines and other &quot;Nick Carter&quot; memorabilia. Both films are unconnected to the Killmaster book series.

===Germany===
&quot;The Hotel in Chicago&quot; (1920), &quot;The Passenger in the Straitjacket&quot; (1922), &quot;Women Who Commit Adultery&quot; (1922), and &quot;Only One Night&quot; (1922) are among the silent films made in Germany featuring Nick Carter.

===United States===

====MGM====
Walter Pidgeon portrays Nick Carter in a trilogy of films released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer: &quot;Nick Carter, Master Detective&quot; (1939); &quot;Phantom Raiders&quot; (1940) and &quot;Sky Murder&quot; (1940). Though MGM owned the rights to a large number of Nick Carter stories, the films used original screenplays.

In the 1944 MGM movie &quot;The Thin Man Goes Home&quot;, detective Nick Charles (William Powell) is seen reading a &quot;Nick Carter Detective&quot; magazine while relaxing in a hammock.

====Columbia====

<text>Matthäus Lang von Wellenburg (1469 – 30 March 1540) was a statesman of the Holy Roman Empire, a Cardinal and Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg from 1519 to 1540.

==Life==
Matthäus Lang was the son of a burgher of Augsburg and later received the noble title of &quot;Wellenburg&quot; after a castle near his hometown that came into his possession in 1507. After studying at Ingolstadt, Vienna and Tübingen he entered the service of Emperor Frederick III of Habsburg and quickly made his way to the front. He was also one of the most trusted advisers of Frederick&#x27;s son and successor Maximilian I, and his services were rewarded in 1500 with the provostship of the cathedral at Augsburg and five years later with the position of the Bishop of Gurk. He also received the Bishopric of Cartagena in Murcia in 1510 and was appointed cardinal by Pope Julius II one year later. In 1514 he became coadjutor to Leonhard von Keutschach, the Salzburg Prince-Archbishop, whom he succeeded in 1519. He received the title of a Cardinal Bishop of the Suburbicarian diocese of Albano in 1535.

In the course of the Protestant Reformation Lang&#x27;s adherence to the older faith, together with his pride and arrogance, made him very unpopular in his Salzburg diocese. As early as in 1523 he was involved in a serious struggle with his subjects in the City of Salzburg, and in 1525, during the German Peasants&#x27; War, he had again to fight hard to hold his own. Insurgents occupied the town of Hallein, devastated the archbishop&#x27;s Burg Hohenwerfen and even laid siege to his residence at Hohensalzburg, until they were finally defeated with the aid of troops provided by the Swabian League. 

Cardinal Lang was one of the chief ministers of Charles V; he played an important part in the tangled international negotiations of his time; and he was always loyal to his imperial masters. Not without reason has he been compared with Cardinal Wolsey. The writer and courtier Maximilianus Transylvanus, a secretary to Charles V, is often said to be a son of Lang&#x27;s (see Maximilianus Transylvanus for this discussion).

<doc id="1331861" wikidata="Q1344495" url="?curid=1331861" title="Sid Fleischman">
<text>Albert Sidney Fleischman (born Avron Zalmon Fleischman; March 16, 1920 – March 17, 2010) was an American author of children&#x27;s books, screenplays, novels for adults, and nonfiction books about stage magic. His works for children are known for their humor, imagery, zesty plotting, and exploration of the byways of American history. He won the Newbery Medal in 1987 for &quot;The Whipping Boy&quot; and the Boston Globe–Horn Book Award in 1979 for &quot;Humbug Mountain&quot;. For his career contribution as a children&#x27;s writer he was U.S. nominee for the biennial, international Hans Christian Andersen Award in 1994. In 2003, the Society of Children&#x27;s Book Writers and Illustrators inaugurated the Sid Fleischman Humor Award in his honor, and made him the first recipient. The Award annually recognizes a writer of humorous fiction for children or young adults. He told his own tale in &quot;The Abracadabra Kid: A Writer&#x27;s Life&quot; (1996).

==Early years==

Fleischman was born Avron Zalmon Fleischman in Brooklyn, New York in 1920. His parents were Ukrainian Jews and moved the family to San Diego, California when Fleischman was two years old. As a youngster, he beheld his first stage magic performance, launching a lifelong fascination that would find a place in many of his books. He learned magic from library books and the local fraternity of magicians, inventing new tricks along the way. He began performing professionally while still in high school, touring California with his friend Buddy Ryan, performing in nightclubs, and traveling the country with the Francisco Spook Show during the last days of vaudeville.

In 1941 Fleischman joined the U.S. Navy Reserve. He served as a Yeoman aboard the destroyer escort USS Albert T. Harris with service near the Philippines, Borneo, and China. until 1946. He graduated from San Diego State University with a Bachelor of Arts in 1949.

==Career==

===Works for adults and the screen===

At 19, Fleischman published his first book, &quot;Between Cocktails&quot;, a collection of magic tricks using paper matches. His college career at San Diego State College was interrupted by World War II, during which he served on a destroyer escort in the Pacific. After graduating with a degree in English, he worked as a reporter for the short-lived &quot;San Diego Daily Journal&quot;, covering everything from crime scenes to the political beat. After the newspaper folded, he turned to fiction. Drawing on his reporting experiences, his knowledge of magic, and his tour of the Pacific, he produced a series of novels of intrigue and adventure over the next 15 years, many set in the Far East. Nearly all have been recently reprinted in two-books-in-one format by Stark House Press.

When one of them—&quot;Blood Alley&quot;—caught the eye of director William Wellman, he hired Fleischman to adapt it to the screen. This both led to a move to Santa Monica, California, where Fleischman lived the rest of his life, and began a decades-long involvement with Hollywood. After &quot;Blood Alley&quot; was filmed, starring John Wayne and Lauren Bacall, Wellman used Fleischman on several other projects, including &quot;Lafayette Escadrille&quot;, based on Wellman&#x27;s own experiences as a World War I pilot. Fleischman adapted his own novel &quot;Yellowleg&quot; for the screen, released as &quot;The Deadly Companions&quot;, the director Sam Peckinpah&#x27;s first feature. Fleischman later worked on several projects with Kirk Douglas, including &quot;Scalawag&quot;. For children, he wrote teleplays for &quot;The Bloodhound Gang&quot; segments of the educational &quot;3–2–1 Contact&quot; series, as well as the screenplay of &quot;The Whipping Boy&quot; (released as &quot;Prince Brat and the Whipping Boy&quot;).

===Books for children===

Using his three children as an audience for the first time, Fleischman wrote &quot;Mr. Mysterious &amp; Company&quot; (1962), the adventures of a traveling magician&#x27;s family in the old West. It was the first of many children&#x27;s books that would draw on his background in magic and his interest in history. &quot;By the Great Horn Spoon!&quot; mined the California Gold Rush and was turned into the movie &quot;The Adventures of Bullwhip Griffin&quot;. &quot;The Ghost in the Noonday Sun&quot;, &quot;Chancy and the Grand Rascal&quot;, &quot;Jingo Django&quot;, and &quot;Humbug Mountain&quot; (1965 to 1978) spun fiction from the facts of East Coast pirates, Ohio River rafting, American Gypsies, and traveling printers. His series of books about Josh McBroom and his family&#x27;s amazing one-acre farm made use of American tall tales. Later works looked farther afield, from England (&quot;The Whipping Boy&quot;) to Asia (&quot;The White Elephant&quot;) to Mexico (&quot;The Dream Stealer&quot;). Finding nonfiction to his liking after completing his autobiography, &quot;The Abracadabra Kid: A Writer&#x27;s Life&quot; (1996), Fleischman went on to produce biographies of Harry Houdini, Mark Twain, and Charlie Chaplin.

==Personal life==

Fleischman and his wife Betty, who died in 1993, had three children. His son Paul Fleischman followed him into the world of children&#x27;s books. They are the only parent and child who&#x27;ve both won the Newbery Medal, the venerable American Library Association award that annually recognizes the &quot;most distinguished contribution to American literature for children&quot;.

Fleischman maintained an interest in magic all his life, hosting monthly meetings of Los Angeles magicians at his home, publishing occasional articles in magic journals, and summing up what he had learned in &quot;The Charlatan&#x27;s Handbook&quot; (1993). For young magicians, he wrote &quot;Mr. Mysterious&#x27;s Secrets of Magic&quot; (1975).

Fleischman&#x27;s other interests included gardening, astronomy, hand-printing, radio, and classical guitar.

Fleischman died on March 17, 2010, one day after his 90th birthday.

<doc id="1331862" wikidata="Q201101" url="?curid=1331862" title="Rize">
<text>Rize (; ; ; ; ; ) is a coastal city in the eastern part of the Black Sea Region of Turkey. It is the seat of Rize Province and Rize District. Its population is 119,828 (2021). Rize is a typical Turkish provincial capital with little in the way of nightlife or entertainment. Since the border with Georgia was opened in the early 1990s, the Black Sea coast road has been widened and the town is much wealthier than it used to be. Current Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan&#x27;s family has its roots in Rize and the local university is named after him. The city is linked by road with Trabzon (41 miles [66 km] west), Hopa (55 miles [88 km] east on the Georgian border, and Erzurum (south). The Rize–Artvin Airport started operating in 2022.

==Name==
The name comes from Greek (riza) or Ριζαίον (Rizaion), meaning &quot;mountain slopes&quot; ( in Greek means root). In modern times, its Greek name was usually Ριζούντα (Rizunda). Its Latin forms are Rhizus and Rhizaeum, the latter of which is used in the Catholic Church&#x27;s list of titular sees as the name of bishopric of the town, which was once part of the late Roman province of Pontus Polemoniacus). 

Other names (17th – 19th c.): Rizeh, Riseh, Rhizium, Irizeh, Irissa; used in trade or by merchants. 

==History==
Arrian was the first writer to mention Rize. In his Periplus of the Euxine Sea, he described it as a city founded at the mouth of the river of the same name, the ancient and Byzantine ῾Ρίζιος ποταμός. Dated to 130–131AD and written as a letter to Roman Emperor Hadrian, the work records how its author, the governor of Cappadocia, made a tour of the Eastern Black Sea territories that formed part of his jurisdiction, first visiting the Roman Empire&#x27;s Eastern Anatolian frontier garrisons before pushing on to the Black Sea coast in the Trabzon (Trebizond) region.
The city of Rize formed part of the historic Georgian province of Chaneti ().

From 1547, Chaneti province was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire and became a part of the &quot;sancak&quot; of Lazistan. The city was claimed by the short-lived Democratic Republic of Georgia between 1918 and 1920. On the basis of the 1921 Treaty of Kars, Soviet Russia granted Rize to Turkey along with the other territories of Artvin, Ardahan, and Hopa ().
==Geography==
The city is built around a small bay on the Black Sea coast, on a narrow strip of flat land between the sea and the mountains behind. The coastal strip is being expanded with landfill and the city is expanding up the steep hillsides away from the coast. 

Rize is probably best known for its black tea which was introduced to the region in the 1940s and 1950s, changing the destiny of a region which was until then desperately poor. The local tea research institute was founded in 1958 and other tea gardens can be seen all around the town. Tea is even planted in local gardens. Rize is a centre for processing and shipping locally grown Rize Tea. More recently kiwifruit plants have also been grown in Rize. Fishing remains another important local source of income.

Tourism to destinations in and around Rize is growing in importance.

==Climate==

Rize has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfa&quot;, Trewartha: &quot;Cf&quot;). However, as any mountainous region of Turkey, it is rich in climatic variety. The climate turns oceanic (&quot;Cfb&quot;) on the hillsides, continental (&quot;Dfb/Dc&quot;) and subarctic (&quot;Dfc/Eo&quot;) on the mountain slopes and in the yaylas, the highlands and highland plateaus. When the Köppen climate classification was being created, the city centre had a borderline oceanic-humid subtropical climate, falling just under the threshold for the hottest month of the year, yet climate change and global warming have contributed to the city being classified as humid subtropical in recent decades.

The city&#x27;s climate is defined by mild temperate conditions, with warm summers, cool winters and heavy rainfall year-round with a maximum in late autumn (October to December). The city has relatively few sunshine hours, lower than many stereotypically cloudy locations in Western Europe. Snowfall is occasional, but can be very heavy once it starts. The water temperature, typical for the Black Sea coast, is never too warm or cold, fluctuating between throughout the year.

== Economy and produce ==
Historically, Rize grew oranges. However, weather destroyed the crops in the early 20th century, and the industry declined. The area also produced small amounts of manganese.

Rize&#x27;s economic structure is primarily based on its geographic location since it is in a very mountainous location, making industrial development impractical. Given the lack of rail transit, most goods have to travel by truck or ship, which makes exporting and importing difficult. Rize&#x27;s primary trading partner is Trabzon, the most developed city of the northeast Black Sea region. Rize&#x27;s main exports are agriculturally based; tea and kiwifruit are among its most popular commodities. In particular the state-owned tea company Çaykur is based in Rize.

==Education==
Rize University was founded in 2006. Its name was changed to Recep Tayyip Erdoğan University in 2011.

==Culture==
Rize Castle is a partly ruined medieval castle to the southwest of the city centre.

==Sports==
Rize&#x27;s sports venues include Rize Atatürk Stadium, Yeni Rize Şehir Stadı and Rize Sports Complex consisting of Rize Sports Hall and Rize Indoor Swimming Pool.

The football team of Çaykur Rizespor play in the Süper Lig. Pazarspor football team compete in the TFF Third League.

<text>Micro venture capital is money invested to seed early-stage emerging companies with amounts of finance that is typically less than that of traditional venture capital. In contrast to traditional venture capital which is money used to invest in companies looking to fund growth (also referred to as a Series A round of funding), micro venture capital consists of smaller seed investments, typically between $25K to $500K, in companies that have yet to gain traction. In the United States, the number of micro venture capital firms have continued to rise rapidly over the last 5 years, and have become an important source of finance for startup companies.

==Principles==
Micro venture capital generally share certain characteristics:
*Initial investment at the seed stage
*Investment on behalf of 3rd party Limited Partners
*Most commonly have fund sizes that are less than $50MM

Most micro venture capital firms pursue startups that are at their seed stage because of their lower initial cost basis. Though there is a high probability that the majority of these startups will not survive long enough to reach a Series A round of funding, micro venture capital firms are willing to make the investment because startups generally do not require large sums of capital to bring a product to market, and because they believe that it requires only a few successful companies for them to see profitable returns.

==Examples==
In the United States, there are over 236 micro venture capital firms, with more than half located in Silicon Valley. Notable examples include SV Angel, which had invested in Dropbox (a file hosting service valued at $10 billion as of January 2014), and Lowercase Capital which had invested in Uber.

<doc id="1331881" wikidata="Q65074" url="?curid=1331881" title="Georg Hermes">
<text>Georg Hermes (22 April 1775, Dreierwalde – 26 May 1831, Bonn) was a German Roman Catholic theologian who advocated a rational approach to theology. During his lifetime, his theology was greatly in vogue in Germany, but declined after the posthumous papal condemnation of &quot;Hermesianism&quot; by Pope Gregory XVI.

==Life==
Born at Dreierwalde, in Westphalia, Hermes was educated at the gymnasium (high school) in Rheine and the University of Münster.

In 1797 Hermes became professor at the Münster gymnasium; in 1799 he was ordained a priest. The first work he wrote, &quot;Untersuchung über die innere Wahrheit des Christentums&quot; (Münster, 1805), in which he sought to demonstrate the harmony between reason and revelation, was received with so much favour that in 1807 its author, warmly commended by the Protestant theologian August Hermann Niemeyer, at Halle, was appointed to a chair of theology at the University of Münster.

Hermes lectured on dogmatic theology, and, with especial zeal, on the introduction to theology. He earned the respect and appreciation of his colleagues by his devotion to the interests of the university; up to 1819 they elected him dean three times.

In 1820, he was appointed professor of theology at Bonn. Hermes was highly esteemed by his students and had a devoted group of adherents, of whom the most notable was Peter Josef Elvenich (1796–1886), who became professor at Breslau in 1829. Hermes died in Bonn 26 May 1831.

==Works==
His works were &quot;Untersuchungen über die innere Wahrheit des Christenthums&quot; (Münster, 1805), and &quot;Einleitung in die christkatholische Theologie&quot;, of which the first part, a philosophical introduction, was published in 1810, the second part, on positive theology, in 1829. The &quot;Einleitung&quot; was never completed. His &quot;Christkatholische Dogmatik&quot; was published, from his lectures, after his death, by two of his students, Johann Heinrich Achterfeldt and Joseph Braun (5 vols, 1831–1834).

===&quot;Einleitung&quot;===
The &quot;Einleitung&quot; had a major and controversial effect upon Catholic theology in Germany. Hermes himself was very largely influenced by the Immanuel Kant and Johann Gottlieb Fichte, and although in the philosophical portion of his &quot;Einleitung&quot; he strongly criticizes both these thinkers, rejecting their doctrine of the moral law as the sole guarantee for the existence of God, and condemning their restricted view of the possibility and nature of revelation, enough remained of purely speculative material to render his system controversial. Having closely studied Kant&#x27;s philosophy, he occupied himself in refuting the doctrines of that philosopher so far as they were inconsistent with the Roman Catholic faith, while insisting that the truth of Christian revelation and of the Catholic church should first be tested by reason, and that revelation should then be followed. He argued that faith is a response to irresistible evidence, and therefore, not free.

After his death, the contests between his followers and their opponents grew so bitter that the dispute was referred to the Papal See. The judgment was negative; on 25 September 1835 a papal bull condemned both parts of the &quot;Einleitung&quot; and the first volume of the &quot;Dogmatik&quot;. Two months later, the remaining volumes of the &quot;Dogmatik&quot; were likewise condemned. The controversy did not cease. In 1845, a systematic attempt was made anonymously by FX Werner to examine and refute the Hermesian doctrines, as contrasted with the orthodox Catholic faith (&quot;Der Hermesianismus&quot;, 1845). In 1847, the condemnation of 1835 was confirmed by Pius IX.

<doc id="1331882" wikidata="Q623727" url="?curid=1331882" title="Chrysopidae">
<text>Green lacewings are insects in the large family Chrysopidae of the order Neuroptera. There are about 85 genera and (differing between sources) 1,300–2,000 species in this widespread group. Members of the genera &quot;Chrysopa&quot; and &quot;Chrysoperla&quot; are very common in North America and Europe; they are very similar and many of their species have been moved from one genus to the other time and again, and in the nonscientific literature assignment to &quot;Chrysopa&quot; and &quot;Chrysoperla&quot; can rarely be relied upon. Since they are the most familiar neuropterans to many people, they are often simply called &quot;[[lacewings]]&quot;. Since most of the diversity of Neuroptera are properly referred to as some sort of &quot;lacewing&quot;, common lacewings is preferable.

==Description and ecology==
Green lacewings are delicate insects with a wingspan of 6 to over 65 mm, though the largest forms are tropical. They are characterized by a wide costal field in their wing venation, which includes the cross-veins. The bodies are usually bright green to greenish-brown, and the compound eyes are conspicuously golden in many species. The wings are usually translucent with a slight iridescence; some have green wing veins or a cloudy brownish wing pattern. The vernacular name &quot;stinkflies&quot;, used chiefly for &quot;Chrysopa&quot; species but also for others (e.g. &quot;Cunctochrysa&quot;) refers to their ability to release a vile smell from paired prothoracic glands when handled.

Adults have tympanal organs at the forewings&#x27; base, enabling them to hear well. Some &quot;Chrysopa&quot; show evasive behavior when they hear a bat&#x27;s ultrasound calls: when in flight, they close their wings (making their echolocational signature smaller) and drop down to the ground. Green lacewings also use substrate or body vibrations as a form of communication between themselves, especially during courtship. Species which are nearly identical morphologically may sometimes be separated more easily based on their mating signals. For example, the southern European &quot;Chrysoperla mediterranea&quot; looks almost identical to its northern relative &quot;C. carnea&quot;, but their courtship &quot;songs&quot; are very different; individuals of one species will not react to the other&#x27;s vibrations.
Adults are crepuscular or nocturnal. They feed on pollen, nectar and honeydew supplemented with mites, aphids and other small arthropods, and some, namely &quot;Chrysopa&quot;, are mainly predatory. Others feed almost exclusively on nectar and similar substances, and have symbiotic yeasts in their digestive tract to help break down the food into nutrients.

Larvae have either a more slender &quot;humpbacked&quot; shape with a prominent bulge on the thorax, or are plumper, with long bristles jutting out from the sides. These bristles will collect debris and food remains – the empty integuments of aphids, most notably – that provide camouflage from birds.

Eggs are deposited at night, singly or in small groups; one female produces some 100–200 eggs. Eggs are placed on plants, usually where aphids are present nearby in numbers. Each egg is hung on a slender stalk about 1 cm long, usually on the underside of a leaf. Immediately after hatching, the larvae moult, then crawl up the egg stalk to feed. They are voracious predators, attacking most insects of suitable size, especially soft-bodied ones (aphids, caterpillars and other insect larvae, insect eggs, and at high population densities also each other). The larvae may also occasionally bite humans, possibly out of either aggression or hunger. Therefore, the larvae are colloquially known as &quot;aphid lions&quot; (also spelled &quot;aphidlions&quot;) or &quot;aphid wolves&quot;, similar to the related antlions. Their senses are weakly developed, except that they are very sensitive to touch. Walking around in a haphazard fashion, the larvae sway their heads from one side to the other, and when they strike a potential prey object, the larva grasps it. Their maxillae are hollow, allowing a digestive secretion to be injected in the prey; the organs of an aphid can for example be dissolved by this in 90 seconds. Depending on environmental conditions, pupation which takes place in a cocoon takes about 1–3 weeks; species from temperate regions usually overwinter as a prepupa, though &quot;C. carnea&quot; overwinters as newly hatched adults.

===Use in biological pest control===
While depending on species and environmental conditions, some green lacewings will eat only about 150 prey items in their entire lives, in other cases 100 aphids will be eaten in a single week. Thus, in several countries, millions of such voracious Chrysopidae are reared for sale as biological control agents of insect and mite pests in agriculture and gardens. They are distributed as eggs, since as noted above they are highly aggressive and cannibalistic in confined quarters; the eggs hatch in the field. Their performance is variable; thus, there is interest in further research to improve the use of green lacewings as biological pest control. Species that have hitherto attracted wider study and are more or less readily available as captive-bred eggs to deposit out for hatching in pest-infested plant cultures are several members of &quot;Chrysoperla&quot; as well as &quot;Mallada signatus&quot;. They are a natural predator of the European corn borer, a moth that costs the US agriculture industry more than $1 billion annually in crop losses and population control.

Gardeners can attract these lacewings – and therefore ensure a steady supply of larvae – by using certain companion plants and tolerating beneficial weeds. Chrysopidae are attracted mainly by Asteraceae – e.g. calliopsis (&quot;Coreopsis&quot;), cosmos (&quot;Cosmos&quot;), sunflowers (&quot;Helianthus&quot;) and dandelion (&quot;Taraxacum&quot;) – and Apiaceae such as dill (&quot;Anethum&quot;) or angelica (&quot;Angelica&quot;).

==Systematics and taxonomy==

For a long time, green lacewings were considered close relatives of the pleasing lacewings (Dilaridae) and brown lacewings (Hemerobiidae) and placed in the superfamily Hemerobioidea. But this grouping does not appear to be natural and misled most significantly by the supposed hemerobioideans&#x27; plesiomorphic larvae. Today, the Hemerobioidea are usually considered monotypic, containing only the brown lacewings; the green lacewings seem to be very closely related to the osmylids (Osmylidae), which have much more advanced larvae superficially resembling those of the spongillaflies (Sisyridae) with which the spongillaflies were thus formerly allied. Thus the superfamily Osmyloidea – also monotypic following the spongillaflies&#x27; removal from there – is the closest living relative of green lacewings; some Mesozoic taxa have been placed in families even closer to Chrysopidae (Ascalochrysidae and Mesochrysopidae) and united with these to superfamily Chrysopoidea.

==Subfamilies and genera==

The living genera of Chrysopidae are divided into one very large and two smaller subfamilies; a few genera are not robustly assigned to either of these yet. Compared to other Neuroptera, which have an extensive, sometimes extremely abundant, fossil record, green lacewings are not known from that many fossils, and these are not generally well-studied. Their prehistoric relatives mentioned above, however, indicate that at least the basal radiation of the Chrysopoidea must have happened in the Jurassic already, if not earlier.

<text>Tjalling Charles Koopmans (August 28, 1910 – February 26, 1985) was a Dutch-American mathematician and economist. He was the joint winner with Leonid Kantorovich of the 1975 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for his work on the theory of the optimum allocation of resources. Koopmans showed that on the basis of certain efficiency criteria, it is possible to make important deductions concerning optimum price systems.

== Biography ==

Koopmans was born in &#x27;s-Graveland, Netherlands. He began his university education at the Utrecht University at seventeen, specializing in mathematics. Three years later, in 1930, he switched to theoretical physics. In 1933, he met Jan Tinbergen, the winner of the 1969 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics and moved to Amsterdam to study mathematical economics under him. In addition to mathematical economics, Koopmans extended his explorations to econometrics and statistics. In 1936, he graduated from Leiden University with a PhD, under the direction of Hendrik Kramers. The title of the thesis was &quot;Linear regression analysis of economic time series&quot;. He also worked for the Economic and Financial Organization of the League of Nations. 

Koopmans moved to the United States in 1940. There, he worked for a while for a government body in Washington, D.C., where he published on the economics of transportation focusing on optimal routing, then moved to Chicago where he joined a research body, the Cowles Commission for Research in Economics, affiliated with the University of Chicago. In 1946, he became a naturalized citizen of the United States, and in 1948, director of the Cowles Commission. Also in 1948, he was elected as a Fellow of the American Statistical Association. In 1950, he became a corresponding member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. Rising hostile opposition to the Cowles Commission by the department of economics at University of Chicago during the 1950s led Koopmans to convince the Cowles family to move it to Yale University in 1955 (where it was renamed the Cowles Foundation). He continued to publish, on the economics of optimal growth and activity analysis.

Koopmans&#x27;s early works on the Hartree–Fock theory are associated with the Koopmans&#x27; theorem, which is very well known in quantum chemistry. Koopmans was awarded his Nobel memorial prize (jointly with Leonid Kantorovich) for his contributions to the field of resource allocation, specifically the theory of optimal use of resources. The work for which the prize was awarded focused on activity analysis, the study of interactions between the inputs and outputs of production, and their relationship to economic efficiency and prices. Finally, the importance of the article by Koopmans (1942) deriving the distribution of the serial correlation coefficient was recognized by John von Neumann, and it later influenced the optimal tests for a unit root by John Denis Sargan and Alok Bhargava (Sargan and Bhargava, 1983).

===Family and name===
Tjalling Charles Koopmans was a son of Sjoerd Koopmans and Wytske van der Zee; his middle name Charles was probably derived from his patronymic &quot;Sjoerds&quot;.

One of Sjoerd Koopmans&#x27;s sisters, Gatske Koopmans, and her husband Symon van der Meer were the paternal grandparents of Nobel Prize winner Simon van der Meer. Tjalling Koopmans and Simon van der Meer were therefore first cousins once removed.

Tjalling had two brothers, one of whom was theologian Rev. Dr Jan Koopmans, who in 1940, early during the German occupation of the Netherlands, wrote the widely distributed pamphlet &quot;&quot;Bijna te laat&quot; (&quot;Almost too late&quot;&quot;, 30,000 copies), warning about the future of the Jews under the Nazi regime. In 1945, towards the end of the war, he witnessed an execution of hostages in Amsterdam from behind a window and was mortally wounded by a stray bullet.

Koopmans married Truus Wanningen in October 1936. The couple had three children - a son, Henry, and two daughters, Anne and Helen.

<text>Yingkou () is a coastal prefecture-level city of central southern Liaoning province, People&#x27;s Republic of China, on the northeastern shore of Liaodong Bay. It is the third-smallest city in Liaoning with a total area of , and the ninth most populous with a population of 2,328,582 as of the 2020 census, of whom 1,228,198 lived in the built-up (or metro) area made of three urban districts (Zhanqian, Xishi and Laobian) and one county-level city (Dashiqiao). It borders the sub-provincial city of Dalian to the south, the prefectural cities of Anshan to the north and east and Panjin to the northwest, and also shares maritime boundaries with Jinzhou and Huludao across the Liaodong Bay to its west.

Located on the east bank of the Daliao River mouth, Yingkou is an important port city, with the Port of Yingkou being the second-largest container port in the Bohai Sea (after the Port of Tianjin) and Northeast China (after the Port of Dalian), the tenth-largest nationwide, and the 25th-busiest worldwide. Yingkou is classified as a Medium-Port Metropolis.

==Name==
Yingkou was historically known as Newchwang (; Manchu: Ishangga gašan hoton) in postal romanization; it was one of the Treaty Ports opened under the Treaties of Tianjin of 1858. In fact, the actual town of Newchwang was about thirty miles upstream of Liao He, within today&#x27;s county-level city of Haicheng. After the treaty had been signed, the British found that the river near Newchwang was too shallow for their ships. Instead, the treaty port was moved to the area nearer to the river mouth where today&#x27;s Yingkou is located.

To avoid confusion between the two locations, careful English writers of the early 20th century would sometimes use &quot;Newchwang&quot; for Yingkou (explaining that &quot;Ying-kow, ... outside Manchuria, ... is known only as Newchwang&quot;) and &quot;Niu-chuang&quot; (the proper Wade–Giles transcription of &quot;) for the actual inland Niuzhuang Town. Meanwhile, &quot;Newchwangcheng&quot; (; postal: &quot;Newchwang Town&quot;) was adopted by the government as the inland town&#x27;s name to distinguish it from the coastal city.

==Administrative divisions==

Yingkou prefecture is subdivided into 4 districts and 2 cities:

==Geography==

Yingkou is mostly located in the northwestern part of the Liaodong Peninsula, and on the left bank of the mouth of Daliao River, which was historically the main distributary of the lower Liao River and the principal exit of fluvial transports from inland Liaoning into the Bohai Sea.

The city&#x27;s metro area is located south from the provincial capital Shenyang, north from Dalian, southwest from Anshan, and southeast from Panjin. The city is located at latitude 39° 55&#x27;−40° 56&#x27; N and longitude 121° 56&#x27;−123° 02&#x27; E. At its greatest width, the city spans from north to south and from east to west. The total area of the city is , occupying a mere 4.9% of the provincial area. The city has a total coastline of .

===Climate===
Yingkou has a four-season humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dwa&quot;) with strong monsoonal influences. Though the climate is somewhat tempered by the city&#x27;s location on the Bohai Gulf, winters are long, windy, cold but dry, and summers are hot and humid. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from in January to in July, while the annual mean is . Precipitation is somewhat enhanced by the coastal location, with a majority of the annual rainfall occurring in July and August alone. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 51% in July to 68% in three months, the city receives 2,774 hours of bright sunshine annually.

==Industrial zones==
*China Minmetals (Yingkou) industrial park
* Yingkou Economic &amp; Technological Development Zone. So far, five key industries have been formed, which are steel, chemical industry, mineral processing, logistics, textile and garment industry.

==Transportation==
Yingkou is served by the Yingkou Lanqi Airport.

==Sport==
The city is home to the basketball club Liaoning Flying Leopards of the Chinese Basketball Association. The club brought forth several players of China&#x27;s national basketball team. It plays its home games at the Benxi Gymnasium.

== Notable residents ==

==Partnership town and ports==
* Jacksonville, Florida, United States — twinned since 1990.
* Tver, Russia — twinned since 1994.
* Yingkou Port signed a Sister Port agreement with the Hamilton Port Authority of Hamilton, Ontario, Canada in November 2005.

<text>Shacharit ( &quot;šaḥăriṯ&quot;), or Shacharis in Ashkenazi Hebrew, is the morning &quot;tefillah&quot; (prayer) of Judaism, one of the three daily prayers.

Different traditions identify different primary components of &quot;Shacharit&quot;. Essentially all agree that &quot;pesukei dezimra&quot;, the Shema Yisrael and its blessings, and the &quot;Amidah&quot; are major sections. Some identify the preliminary blessings and readings, as a first, distinct section. Others say that Tachanun is a separate section, as well as the concluding blessings. On certain days, there are additional prayers and services added to shacharit, including Mussaf and a Torah reading.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Shacharit&quot; comes from the Hebrew root (&quot;shaħar&quot;), meaning dawn.

==Origin==
According to tradition, &quot;Shacharit&quot; was identified as a time of prayer by Abraham, as states, &quot;Abraham arose early in the morning,&quot; which traditionally is the first &quot;Shacharit&quot;. However, Abraham&#x27;s prayer did not become a standardized prayer.

&quot;Shacharit&quot; was also instituted in part as a replacement of the daily morning Temple service after the destruction of the Temple. The sages of the Great Assembly may have formulated blessings and prayers that later became part of &quot;Shacharit&quot;, however the siddur, or prayerbook as we know it, was not fully formed until around the 7th century CE. The prayers said still vary among congregations and Jewish communities.

==Service==

===Weekdays===
During or before &quot;Shacharit&quot;, those Jews who wear tallit or tefillin put them on, in each case accompanied by blessings. Some do not eat until they have prayed.

The main components of &quot;Shacharit&quot; are:
* Birkot hashachar, a series of blessings originally recited upon arising, now incorporated into the prayer service
* Korbanot, a series of recitations related to the Temple sacrifices
* &quot;Pesukei dezimra&quot;, a series of psalms, hymns, and prayers. &quot;Pesukei dezimra&quot; is said so that an individual will have praised God before making requests, which might be considered rude.
* The &quot;Shema Yisrael&quot; and its related blessings. One should &quot;concentrate on fulfilling the positive commandment of reciting the &quot;Shema&quot;&quot; before reciting it. One should be sure to say it clearly and not to slur words together.
* Amidah (Shemoneh Esreh), a series of 19 blessings. The blessings cover a variety of topics such as Jerusalem, crops, and prayer.
* Tachanun, a supplication consisting of a collection of passages from the Hebrew bible (Tanakh). On Mondays and Thursdays, a longer version is recited. Tachanun is omitted on holidays and certain other &quot;happy&quot; days.
* On certain holidays, Hallel is recited.
* Torah reading (on certain days)
* Ashrei and Uva letzion
* Aleinu and Shir shel yom

Kaddish is recited in between most of the above sections.

===Shabbat and holidays===
Various changes to the Shacharit service take place on Shabbat and holidays:

* In &quot;pesukei dezimra&quot;, most communities omit Psalm 100 (&quot;Mizmor LeTodah&quot;, the psalm for the Thanksgiving offering), because the &quot;todah&quot; or Thanksgiving offering could not be offered on Shabbat in the days of the Temple in Jerusalem. Its place is taken in the Ashkenazi tradition by Psalms , , , , , , , , . Sephardic Jews maintain a different order, add several psalms and two religious poems.
* The &quot;Nishmat&quot; prayer is recited at the end of the &quot;Pesukei D&#x27;Zimrah&quot;, as an expansion of the weekday &quot;Yishtabah&quot; blessing.
* The blessings before &quot;Shema&quot; are expanded, and include the hymn &quot;El Adon&quot;, which is often sung communally.
* The intermediate 13 blessings of the Amidah are replaced by a single blessing on the topic of Shabbat or the holiday. In Nusach Ashkenaz (and Nusach Sefard) the Kedushah (recited during the Hazzan&#x27;s repetition of the third Amidah blessing) is significantly expanded; in the Sephardic rite, it is recited in the same form as on weekdays.
* After the repetition is concluded, some recite the Shir shel yom (others recite it at the end of the Mussaf service)
* A Torah reading always takes place on Shabbat and holidays. In the Eastern Ashkenazic rite, the prayers surrounding the reading are much longer than on weekdays, but in the Western Ashkenazic rite, they are almost identical. The weekly portion is read, divided into at least seven Aliyot (plus a &quot;maftir&quot; Aliyah), followed by the &quot;haftarah&quot;.
* In Nusach Ashkenaz (and Nusach Sefard), prayers for the community are recited after the Torah reading: &quot;Yekum Purkan&quot;, as well as the subsequent &quot;Mi sheberakh&quot;, a blessing for the leaders and patrons of the synagogue. In the Western Ashkenazic rite, the &quot;Mi sheberakh&quot; is omitted on the Shabbat before Rosh Chodesh.
* In some communities, prayers are then recited for the government of the country, for peace, and/or for the State of Israel. On the Shabbat before Rosh Chodesh (&quot;Shabbat mevorchim&quot;) a special prayer blessing the new month is recited.
* After these prayers, Ashrei is repeated and the Torah scroll is returned to the Ark in a procession through the Synagogue. Many congregations allow children to come to the front in order to kiss the scroll as it passes.

This is followed by the Mussaf service, which generally is recited immediately after Shacharit.

==Timing==

According to Jewish law, the earliest time to recite the morning service is when there is enough natural light &quot;one can see a familiar acquaintance six feet away.&quot; It is a subjective standard. The usual time for this prayer service is between sunrise and a third of the day. If one missed a third of the day, it may be recited until astronomical noon, referred to as &quot;chatzot.&quot; After that (technically, half an hour after &quot;chatzot&quot;), the afternoon service (mincha) can be recited.

<text>The Dionysiaca (, &quot;Dionysiaká&quot;) is an ancient Greek epic poem and the principal work of Nonnus. It is an epic in 48 books, the longest surviving poem from Greco-Roman antiquity at 20,426 lines, composed in Homeric dialect and dactylic hexameters, the main subject of which is the life of Dionysus, his expedition to India, and his triumphant return to the west.

==Composition==
The poem is thought to have been written in the 5th century AD. The suggestion that it is incomplete misses the significance of the birth of Dionysus&#x27; one son (Iacchus) in the final Book 48, quite apart from the fact that 48 is a key number as the number of books in the &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot; combined. The older view that Nonnus wrote this poem before conversion to Christianity and the writing of his other long poem, a verse paraphrase of St John&#x27;s Gospel, is now discredited, since a host of indications point to the latter being the earlier work and because it misses the eclecticism of late antique culture. Editors have pointed out various inconsistencies and the difficulties of Book 39 which appears to be a disjointed series of descriptions, as evidence of lack of revision.

==Poetic models==
The primary models for Nonnus are Homer and the Cyclic poets; Homeric language, metrics, episodes, and descriptive canons are central to the &quot;Dionysiaca&quot;. The influence of Euripides&#x27; &quot;Bacchae&quot; is also significant, as is probably the influence of the other tragedians whose Dionysiac plays do not survive. His debt to poets whose work survives only in disjointed fragments is far harder to gauge, but it is likely that he alludes to earlier poets&#x27; treatments of the life of Dionysus, such as the lost poems by Euphorion, Peisander of Laranda&#x27;s elaborate encyclopedic mythological poem, Dionysius, and Soteirichus. Reflections of Hesiod&#x27;s poetry, especially the &quot;Catalogue of Women&quot;, of Pindar, and Callimachus can all be seen in the work of Nonnus. Theocritus&#x27; influence can be detected in Nonnus&#x27; focus on pastoral themes. Finally, Virgil and especially Ovid seem to have influenced Nonnus&#x27; organization of the poem.

==Influence==

Nonnus seems to have been an important influence for the poets of Late Antiquity, especially Musaeus, Colluthus, Christodorus, and Dracontius. He remained continuously important in the Byzantine world, and his influence can be found in Genesius and Planudes. In the Renaissance, Poliziano popularized him to the West, and Goethe admired him in the 18th century. He was also admired by Thomas Love Peacock in 19th-century England.

==Metrics and style==
The metrics of Nonnus have been widely admired by scholars for the poet&#x27;s careful handling of dactylic hexameter and innovation. While Homer has 32 varieties of hexameter lines, Nonnus only employs 9 variations, avoids elision, employs mostly weak caesurae, and follows a variety of euphonic and syllabic rules regarding word placement. It is especially remarkable that Nonnus was so exacting with meter because the quantitative meter of classical poetry was giving way in Nonnus&#x27; time to stressed meter. These metrical restraints encouraged the creation of new compounds, adjectives, and coined words, and Nonnus&#x27; work has some of the greatest variety of coinages in any Greek poem.

The poem is notably varied in its organization. Nonnus does not seem to arrange his poem in a linear chronology; rather, episodes are arranged by a loose chronological order and by topic, much as Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;. The poem states as its guiding principle &quot;poikilia&quot;, diversity in narrative, form, and organization. The appearance of Proteus, a shapeshifting god, in the proem (preamble) serves as a metaphor for Nonnus&#x27; varied style. Nonnus employs the style of the epyllion for many of his narrative sections, such as his treatment of Ampelus in 10–11, Nicaea in 15–16, and Beroe in 41–43. These epyllia are inserted into the general narrative framework and are some of the highlights of the poem. Nonnus also employs &quot;synkrisis&quot;, comparison, throughout his poem, most notably in the comparison of Dionysus and other heroes in Book 25. The complexity of organization and the richness of the language have caused the style of the poem to be termed Nonnian &quot;Baroque.&quot;

==Critical responses to the &quot;Dionysiaca&quot;==
The size of Nonnus&#x27; poem and its late date between Imperial and Byzantine literature have caused the &quot;Dionysiaca&quot; to receive relatively little attention from scholars. The contributor to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; (8th edition, 1888), noting the poem&#x27;s &quot;vast and formless luxuriance, its beautiful but artificial versification, its delineation of action and passion to the entire neglect of character,&quot; remarked, &quot;His chief merit consists in the systematic perfection to which he brought the Homeric hexameter. But the very correctness of the versification renders it monotonous. His influence on the vocabulary of his successors was likewise very considerable,&quot; expressing the 19th-century attitude to this poem as a pretty, artificial, and disorganized collection of stories. As with many other late classical poets, newer scholarship has avoided the value-laden judgments of 19th-century scholars and attempted to reassess and rehabilitate Nonnus&#x27; works. There are two main focuses of Nonnian scholarship today: mythology and structure.

Nonnus&#x27; compendious accounts of Dionysiac legend and his use of variant traditions and lost sources have encouraged scholars to use him as a channel to recover lost Hellenistic poetry and mythic traditions. The edition of Nonnus in the Loeb Classical Library includes a &quot;mythological introduction&quot; which charts the &quot;decline&quot; of Dionysiac mythology in the poem and implies that the work&#x27;s only value is as a repository of lost mythology. Nonnus remains an important source of mythology and information to those researching classical religion, Hellenistic poetry, and Late Antiquity. Recently, however, scholars have focused more positively on Nonnus&#x27; use of mythology within the poem as a way of talking about contemporary events, as a way of playing with generic conventions, and as a way of engaging with predecessors intertextually, leading to an encouraging reassessment of his poetic and narrative style.

The unconventional structure of the &quot;Dionysiaca&quot; encouraged harsh criticism of the poem in scholarship. Robert Shorrock and Francois Vian have been at the forefront of reexamining the structure of the poem. Earlier scholars have looked to elaborate ring composition, a prophetic astrological program in the tablets of Harmonia, rhetorical encomium, or epyllion as structural concepts behind the poem to make sense of the unconventional narrative. Others have felt that the style of the poem relies on dissonant juxtaposition for effect, using the so-called &quot;jeweled style&quot; of detailed narrative cameoes within a loose structure akin to Late Antique mosaics. Vian has proposed looking at the poem&#x27;s encyclopedic content as paralleling the full range of the Homeric cycle poetry. Shorrock&#x27;s contention is that the &quot;Dionysiaca&quot; employs a variety of narrative organizational principles and viewpoints, attempts to narrate all of classical mythology through the myths of Dionysus, and uses allegory and allusion to challenge his readers to draw meaning from his unconventional epic.

==Contents==

Book 1 
– The poem opens with the poet&#x27;s invocation of the muses, his address to Proteus, and his commitment to sing the various episodes of Dionysus&#x27; life in a varied style (stylistic concept of ποικιλία, poikilia). The narrative starts with the origins of Dionysus: Zeus kidnaps Europa and her father orders Cadmus (Dionysus&#x27; maternal grandfather) to search for her. While Zeus is distracted making love to the maiden Pluto, the monster Typhon, following orders of his mother, the Earth, steals Zeus&#x27; weapons (the thunderbolts) and tries to dominate the world causing chaos and destruction wherever he goes. Zeus is now making love to Europa, but when he realises the dire situation calls Pan, Eros and Cadmus for help: Pan provides Cadmus with a pastoral disguise and he is supposed to charm Typhon with a pastoral song and Eros&#x27; help, while Zeus recovers his weapons. Typhon is so charmed by Cadmus&#x27; song that he promises him whatever he wants in exchange for it, not understanding that Cadmus is actually singing how he is defeated by Zeus.
Book 2 
– Zeus steals the lightning from Typhon and takes Cadmus to a safe place. When Typhon notices the disappearance of Cadmus and of Zeus&#x27; weapons, he attacks the cosmos with all his poisons and the help of his animals. Chaos and destruction follow. During the night Zeus is encouraged to fight by Victory itself (Nike). The following morning Typhon challenges Zeus into combat and is defeated and killed by him after a long battle that affects the whole cosmos. While the earth repairs itself, Zeus promises to Cadmus the hand of Harmonia, daughter of Ares and Aphrodite, and bids him to found Thebes.

Book 3 
– Cadmus&#x27; ship wanders the sea and stops at Samothrace, where Harmonia lives with her step-mother Electra and her step-brother Emathion. Joining them at their beautiful palace, he tells Electra of his lineage. Hermes bids Electra give her daughter Harmonia to be Cadmus&#x27; bride without a dowry.

Book 4 
– Harmonia refuses to marry Cadmus because of his poverty, but Aphrodite takes the shape of Peisinoe, a girl of the neighbourhood, and produces a full encomium of Cadmus&#x27; beauty to convince her. Harmonia willingly leaves Samothrace with Cadmus who sails with her to Greece. Cadmus consults the oracle at Delphi and is told to follow a cow until she collapses and found there Thebes. There he slays Ares&#x27; dragon (thus attracting the god&#x27;s anger onto himself), sows its teeth, and reaps the crop of sown-men.

Book 5 
– Cadmus then founds Thebes, dedicating its seven doors to seven gods and planets. The gods attend to his wedding with Harmonia and enrich them with their gifts, of which the necklace given to her by Aphrodite receives particular attention. They have four daughters (Autonoe, Agaue, Ino and Semele) and a son (Polydorus). Cadmus gives Autonoe&#x27;s hand to Aristaeus, well known as an inventor. They have a son, Actaeon, who becomes a passionate hunter. One day he sees Artemis bathing naked in a spring and is punished for it with his transformation into a stag which is then devoured by his dogs. Autonoe and Aristaeus search for his body but can only find it when the ghost of Actaeon appears to his father and tells him to find the bones of a stag and bury them. Agaue marries Echion and bears Pentheus to him. Ino marries Athamas, but Semele is reserved for Zeus, who is resenting the death of the first Dionysus (Zagreus), whom he had engendered with Persephone. Beginning of the story of Persephone: all the gods of the Olympus are madly in love with her.

Book 6 
– Demeter, upset by Zeus&#x27;s attention, goes to Astraeus, god of prophecy, who casts Persephone&#x27;s horoscope, telling of her imminent rape by Zeus. Demeter conceals Persephone in a cave, but Zeus sleeps with her in the form of a snake, and she bears Zagreus. At Hera&#x27;s bidding, the Titans kill Zagreus and chop him up. In anger, Zeus floods the world, causing havoc to the pastoral deities and the rivers.


Book 7 
– Life on earth is miserable. Aion, god of time, begs Zeus to ease mortal life. Zeus predicts that the birth of Dionysus will change everything. Eros makes Zeus fall in love with Semele. The girl wakes up after a horrible nightmare predicting her death, consumed by the thunderbolt, and is told to sacrifice to Zeus to avert the omen. Spattered by the victim&#x27;s blood she bathes naked in a river nearby, where Zeus spots her beauty and falls madly in love with her. That night Zeus joins Semele in her bed and metamorphoses into different animals during the courtship.

Book 8 –
Semele becomes pregnant with Dionysus. Envy tells Hera of the deed and she disguises herself as an old woman the young girl trusts and tricks her into asking to see Zeus armed in full power with the lightning. She does and Zeus cannot say no to her. The fires of thunder burn Semele alive and Zeus immortalizes her.

Book 9 –
Zeus rescues Dionysus from the fire and sews him into his thigh until he is ready to be born. Hermes receives baby Dionysus after birth and carries him to the daughters of Lamos, river nymphs, until Hera drives them mad. Hermes then gives the boy to Ino and she places him under the care of her attendant Mystis, who teaches him the rites of the mysteries. Hera finds out the whereabouts of Dionysus, but Hermes reaches him before she does and transfers him to the care of Rhea. Dionysus grows up in the mountains of Lydia where he learns to hunt and to dominate beasts. His early pursuits make his mother Semele proud. In the meantime a mad Ino wanders in the hills until Apollo takes pity on her and restores her sanity. Ino&#x27;s household mourns for her disappearance, while his husband Athamas marries Themisto.

Book 10 –
Themisto goes mad and kills her son. Athamas goes mad too and slaughters his son Learchos. Ino arrives when he is about to kill their son Melicertes whom she saves by jumping into the sea, becoming divinized. Meanwhile, Dionysus has become a teenager and lives in Lydia with a court of Satyrs. He falls in love for the first time with one of them, Ampelus (Vine). His passion for the boy is only spoiled by the knowledge that he will soon die, just as all the young lovers of the gods do. Dionysus and Ampelos indulge in a series of sports contests, the god allowing the boy to win.

Book 11 –
Dionysus organizes a swimming contest and allows Ampelus to win. Ampelus is elated by his success and dresses up as a Bacchante as a form of celebration. Dionysus warns the boy to stay close to him, just in case a deity is jealous of their happiness and tries to kill him. A portent tells Dionysus that Ampelus will die and become a vine. Ate (Delusion) makes Ampelus jealous reminding him that Dionysus and the gods usually give their friends a special present, a special mount, and suggests that he should make a bull his own. Deluded, Ampelus rides a bull and provokes Selene by saying that he is a better bull-rider than her. Selene sends a gadfly to sting the bull. The animal starts kicking and Ampelus falls on his head on the ground. A satyr brings Dionysus the ill news. Dionysus prepares the body for the funeral and makes a long lament. Eros tries to console and distract him with the story of Calamos and Carpos, two handsome youngsters who were in love with each other. During a swimming contest Carpos drowns and Calamos, incapable of living without him, commits suicide. Calamos becomes the reeds of the river and Carpos the fruit of the earth. Dionysus is comforted with the story but mourning does not leave him. In the meantime the Seasons visit the house of Helios, the Sun.

Book 12 –
Autumn enquires when the vine will appear on earth and become her personal attribute. Description of the tablets of Phanes, on which all the oracles of the future are engraved. Prediction of the metamorphosis of Ampelus into a vine. In the meantime, Dionysus mourns for Ampelus. Ampelus is transformed into the vine and Dionysus makes wine for the first time, reflecting on how Ampelus has escaped death. Dionysus adopts the vine as his personal attribute and claims to be superior to the other gods, because no other plant is so beautiful and provides so much merriment to humankind. Insertion of a second legend on the origins of the vine: it was growing wild and unknown of until Dionysus saw a snake suckling the juice from the grapes; Dionysus and his satyrs build the first wine press, make wine for the first time and have the first feast of the harvest, completely inebriated.

Book 13 –
Zeus sends Iris to the halls of Rhea, ordering Dionysus to make a war against the impious Indians if he wants to join the gods on Olympus. Rhea gathers the troops for Dionysus. Catalogue of heroic troops including seven contingents from Greece and seven peripheral contingents.

Book 14 –
Catalogue of semi-divine troops, also gathered by Rhea for Dionysus. Dionysus sets his army in motion until they encounter the first Indian contingent, led by Astraeis. Hera deludes Astraeis to go to battle against the Bacchic troops. Maenads and satyrs massacre the Indian troops until Dionysus takes pity on them and turns the waters of the neighbouring lake Astacid. The Indians try wine for the first time.

Book 15 –
The Indians become drunk, fall asleep and are bound by the Dionysiac troops. Story of the virgin nymph Nicaea, who lives near the lake Astacid, enjoys hunting and refuses to behave like a woman. The shepherd Hymnus (a personification of the pastoral song) falls in love with her and courts her. Nicaea refuses even to listen to him and the boy becomes so desperate that he even asks her to kill him (a frequent line in the speeches of unrequited lovers). Nicaea takes the line literally and shoots him dead. The nature and its gods lament the dead shepherd and call for revenge.

Book 16 –
Eros inspires in Dionysus a mad desire for Nicaea. Dionysus woos her and offers her a number of gifts, which she despises. After a day hunting, Nicaea drinks from a river whose waters are turned into wine, following Dionysus&#x27; earlier intervention in the first battle against the Indians. Inebriated, Nicaea falls asleep and is raped by the god as a punishment for killing Hymnus. Dionysus abandons her and when she wakes up she realises that she has been raped. She tries to find her rapist but soon she realises that she is pregnant and gives birth to Telete (&#x27;Initiation&#x27;). Dionysus founds the city of Nicaea, as a double commemoration of the namesake nymph and of his first battle against the Indians.

Book 17 –
Dionysus travels through the east and is entertained by a shepherd, Brongus, in a country fashion. In thanks for his hospitality, Dionysus gives him some wine and teaches him how to grow and harvest the vine. Astraeis informs Orontes, son-in-law of the Indian king Deriades, of the defeat of the Indian army and the ruse of the waters turned into wine. Orontes is furious and harangues his troops not to fear the effeminate Dionysus and his army of women. The Indians charge in and at first seem to win, but Dionysus screams like nine thousand men and detains them. Orontes and Dionysus engage in single combat: a tap of a vine cluster on Orontes&#x27; chest is enough to split his armour. Orontes plunges his sword into his own belly and throws himself into the river nearby, giving it his name (Orontes river). The Bacchic troops massacre the Indians. Astraeis flees.

Book 18 –
Dionysus arrives in Assyria, where the king Staphylus (&quot;Cluster of grapes&quot;), his wife Methe (&quot;Drunkenness) and his son Botrys (&quot;Grapes&quot;) entertain him in their marvelous palace in a drunken celebration. During his night with them he dreams that the wild king Lycurgus attacks him like a lion attacks a deer. The next morning Staphylus gives Dionysus splendid presents and encourages him to fight. While Dionysus is busy filling Assyria with his vine, Staphylus suddenly dies and his palace is filled with mourning voices. Dionysus returns to the palace only to find his friend dead.

Book 19 –
Dionysus consoles Methe and Botrys giving them wine and hosts the funeral games for Staphylus, with contests of singing and pantomime.

Book 20 –
The end of the games brings the mourning to an end. In a dream, Eris drives Dionysus to war. Methe, Botrys and their servant Pithos (&quot;Wine-jar&quot;) join the Bacchic forces. They arrive in Arabia, where king Lycurgus has been stirred to fight by Hera. At the same time Hera deludes Dionysus with a false dream, in which Hermes counsels Dionysus to approach Lycurgus peaceably and without weapons. Lycurgus attacks Dionysus and the Bacchantes with a massive pole-axe. Dionysus jumps into the sea where he is entertained and consoled by Nereus. In his warlike paroxysm Lycurgus even attacks the sea and provokes the gods.

Book 21 –
Lycurgus attacks the Bacchantes a second time, in particular Ambrosia who is metamorphosed into a vine and suffocates Lycurgus with its shoots, while the Bacchantes throng to kill him. Poseidon causes an earthquake, but Hera saves him temporarily until Zeus punishes him turning him into a blind wanderer. While Dionysus is entertained in the halls of Nereus, the Bacchic army is dispirited. The satyr Pherespondos arrives at the court of the Indian king Deriades and gives him Dionysus&#x27; message: he should accept the cult of the vine or face him in battle. Deriades, a son of the river (Jhelum River) dismisses Dionysus&#x27; offer of peace. Dionysus leaves the bottom of the sea, joins his troops and prepares for battle.

Book 22 –
The Bacchic troops arrive at the river Hydaspes, where the trees and animals receive Dionysus with joy. The Indians see the miracles performed by Dionysus and are tempted to surrender, but Hera deceives their leader Thureus. The Indians try to ambush the Bacchic troops but a nymph warns Dionysus of the impending peril. In the battle Oeagrus, Aeacus, and Erectheus all distinguish themselves.

Book 23 –
Dionysus and Aeacus fight the Indians in the river, where most of them drown. Hera encourages the Hydaspes to drown the Bacchic troops as they cross the river. The Bacchic army starts to cross the Hydaspes using strange means of navigation. The Hydaspes is upset because his waters are fouled with blood and dead bodies and because of how easily the Bacchic troops cross it. He tries to drown them in a flood. Dionysus responds angrily to the threat and sets the river banks on fire. The survival of the vegetation, fish and river nymphs is under threat. Hydaspes asks Tethys to help him.

Book 24 –
Zeus and Hera stay the anger of the contenders. Hydaspes surrenders and Dionysus draws back his torch. The Bacchic army finishes crossing the river only to find that Deriades has placed his troops on the other bank of the river. The gods come down from the Olympus to save their protégés and the army settles in the hills nearby. Thureus tells the Indian king Deriades of what has happened. The news of the defeat reaches the Indian people and their morale deteriorates. In the forest, the Bacchic troops celebrate their victory. Leucus sings the story of Aphrodite&#x27;s weaving contest with Athena and her defeat.

Book 25 –
The poet invokes the Muse in his second proem, saying that in emulation of Homer he will skip over the first six years of the war. Comparison of Dionysus&#x27; deeds with those of Perseus, Minos, and Heracles, concluding that Dionysus is better than the heroes. Return to the main narrative: the Ganges, Deriades and the Indian people are scared by a number of Bacchic miracles. Dionysus is angry because Hera is delaying his victory. Rhea sends Attis to visit Dionysus and give him a shield that will protect him in battle and promises that he will conquer the city of the Indians in the seventh year of the war. Description of the shield, covered with constellations and adorned with a number of scenes: foundation of Thebes, Ganymede and Zeus and the Lydian myth of Tylos.

Book 26 –
Athena drives Deriades to gather his allies. Catalogue of Indian troops: fourteen contingents from the Indus valley and the eastern areas of the Median empire. Descriptions rich in ethnographic material.

Book 27 –
Deriades exhorts his troops to attack Dionysus near the mouth of the Indus. Dionysus places his battalions carefully and harangues his troops. In the meantime, in the Olympus, Zeus encourages Apollo and Athena to join their brother Dionysus and also addresses the gods who back the Indian side (Hera and Hephaestus).

Book 28 – 
The battle rages. Exploits and deaths of Phaleneus, Dexiochus and Clytios. Exploits of Corymbasos. Strange deaths in battle. Exploits of the Cyclopes and Korybantes.

Book 29 –
Exploits of Dionysus&#x27; lover, Hymenaeus, who is wounded by an Indian arrow and healed by Dionysus. Exploits of the Dionysiac troops, especially Aristeus, the Kabeiri and the Korybantes. Offensive of the Bacchantes, wounded by the Indians and healed by Dionysus. The battle comes to a halt with the arrival of night. Rhea sends Ares a deceitful dream: he should abandon the battle because Hephaestus is about to seduce Aphrodite. Ares leaves at once.

Book 30 –
Exploits of Morrheus, Deriades&#x27; son-in-law. Tectaphus is slain by Eurymedon (one of the Cabiri, children of Hephaestus and Cabiro). Hera encourages Deriades to fight and Dionysus is about to flee, but Athena stops him. Dionysus goes back to battle and massacres the Indian troops.

Book 31 –
Hera goes to Persephone and tricks her into lending her the services of a Fury, Megaira, whom she instructs to madden Dionysus. Hera also instructs Iris to persuade Hypnus to cause Zeus to sleep, claiming that as god of nocturnal revels, Dionysus is his natural enemy, and that he should not risk angering Hera, the mother of his beloved Pasithea. Hera borrows Aphrodite&#x27;s girdle, the cestus, in order to seduce Zeus.

Book 32 –
Hera charms Zeus with the girdle, they make love, and while Zeus sleeps Megaira drives Dionysus mad. In the absence of Dionysus, Deriades and Morrheus rout the Bacchantes. The Bacchic army panics.

Book 33 –
A Grace tells Aphrodite about Dionysus&#x27; madness and of how Morrheus is pursuing the Bacchante Chalcomede. Aphrodite sends Aglaia to fetch Eros, who is playing kottabos with Hymenaeus. In exchange for a chaplet made by Hephaestus, Eros agrees to cause Morrheus to fall in love with Chalcomede. Shaken by lovesickness Morrheus loses interest in battle and pursues Chalcomede, who makes him think that she reciprocates his feelings. Morrheus&#x27; lovesickness becomes more acute during the night. Chalcomede fears for her virginity but is comforted by Thetis, who asks her to delude Morrheus and promises that a serpent will protect her virginity.

Book 34 –
Morrheus wanders on his own during the night and his servant Hyssacos recognises the signs of love and comforts him. Beginning of a new day: Morrheus nourishes his hope of love, while the Bacchic troops are completely dispirited in the absence of Dionysus. Morrheus attacks the Bacchantes and takes some captives as a gift for Deriades, who sends them to be tortured and killed in various ways. Chalcomede lures Morrheus out of the battle. Deriades drives the Bacchantes inside the city walls.

Book 35 –
The Indians slay the Bacchantes in the city. Chalcomede lures Morrheus away from the battle making him believe that she is in love with him. When he is about to rape her the serpent that protects her virginity attacks him. In the meantime Hermes lets the Bacchantes out of the city. Zeus awakens and forces Hera to cure Dionysus&#x27; madness by breastfeeding him (a sign of adoption) and anointing him with ambrosia. Dionysus rejoins his army.

Book 36 –
Confrontation of pro-Dionysiac and pro-Indian divinities in the Olympus: Athena defeats Ares, Hera defeats Artemis, Apollo confronts Poseidon, but Hermes pacifies them. On earth, Deriades harangues his troops and charges with his elephants. After a series of combats and descriptions of carnage, Deriades fights one-on-one with Dionysus: Dionysus eludes him adopting different shapes, imprisons him with the tendrils of a vine and finally releases him. Dionysus orders the Rhadamanes to build a fleet for him. Deriades presides the Indian assembly, in which he harangues his troops for the sea-battle. The two armies sign a truce to bury the dead.

Book 37 –
Dionysus builds the pyre for Opheltes and celebrates funeral games, including a chariot race, pugilism, wrestling, foot race, discus, archery and javelin throw.

Book 38 –
Two omens foretell Dionysus&#x27; victory, first a solar eclipse and then an eagle (i.e. Dionysus) throwing a serpent (i.e. Deriades) to the river. The first of them is interpreted by the seer Idmon, the second by Hermes, who tells at length the story of Phaethon from his genealogy to his death and catasterism.

Book 39 –
The sea-battle begins on the arrival of Dionysus&#x27; brand-new fleet. Deriades and Dionysus harangue their troops, and Aeacus and Erechtheus ask the gods for help. The narrative of the battle is dominated by descriptions of carnage until the Indians are routed by a burning ship sent into their line. Deriades flees.

Book 40 –
Deriades returns to battle and is confronted by Dionysus who grazes him with his thyrsus and forces him to jump into the river Hydaspes, calling the war to an end. Deriades&#x27; wife (Orsiboe) and daughters (Cheirobie and Protonoe) mourn him. Dionysus buries the dead, celebrates his victory and distributes spoils. Modaeus is appointed as governor of India. Dionysus travels to Tyre, admires the city, and hears the story of its founding from Heracles.

Book 41 –
This book describes the mythical history of the city of Beroe (Beirut). The poet tells the story of the nymph Beroe, daughter of Aphrodite. He describes her birth and her maturation. Aphrodite goes to Harmonia to find out the destiny of Beirut, and she prophesies its future prosperity in the Roman Empire under Augustus.

Book 42 –
Dionysus and Poseidon both fall in love with Beroe. Dionysus pursues her through the forests in love, meeting with Pan, and wooing the nymph with demonstrations of his abilities. Dionysus and Poseidon decide to fight over the girl.

Book 43 –
The army of Poseidon&#x27;s sea gods and the army of Dionysus battle each other. Zeus gives Beroe&#x27;s hand to Poseidon who consoles Dionysus.

Book 44 –
Dionysus arrives at Thebes and Pentheus refuses his rites and arrests Dionysus. The Furies attack Pentheus&#x27; palace and Agave and her sisters are driven mad.

Book 45 –
Teiresias and Cadmus try to propitiate Dionysus but Pentheus attacks the god who tells him the story of the Tyrsenian pirates. Pentheus imprisons Dionysus, but the god destroys the palace and escapes.

Book 46 –
Dionysus tricks Pentheus into spying on his mother and her sisters in their frenzy and is killed by them.

Book 47 –
The thiasus arrives at Athens and the city rejoices. Dionysus teaches Icarius viticulture, and the farmer gives his neighbors wine. When they are drunk they kill Icarius. His daughter Erigone, informed by a dream, finds her dead father and hangs herself, but is then made into a constellation by Zeus. Ariadne bewails her abandonment by Theseus and Dionysus weds her. Dionysus drives the women of Argos to kill their children for refusing his rites. Perseus is incited by Hera to attack the Bacchantes and turns Ariadne into stone after which the Argives accept the rites of Dionysus on Hermes&#x27; demand.

Book 48 –
Hera prays to Gaia, who stirs her sons the Giants to fight Dionysus and they are slain. Dionysus wrestles with Pallene, the daughter of King Sithon, to win her hand and then slays the king when he wins. Dionysus goes to Asia Minor where he meets the nymph Aura. Aura vies with Artemis in a beauty contest, and Artemis, in spite, has Nemesis make Dionysus fall in love with Aura and pursue her. Ariadne appears to Dionysus in a dream and complains that he has forgotten her. Dionysus rapes Aura as she sleeps; when she awakes she goes mad and slaughters shepherds and destroys a shrine of Aphrodite. Artemis mocks the pregnant Aura as Nicaea helps her give birth to the twins after whom Mt. Dindymon is named. Aura tries to get a lion to eat the children, but they are saved and she is transformed into a spring. One of the children, Iacchus is given to Athena, Ariadne&#x27;s crown is made a constellation, and Dionysus is enthroned on Olympus.

The name &quot;Mincha&quot;, meaning &quot;gift&quot; or &quot;offering&quot;, is derived from the meal offering that accompanied each sacrifice offered in the Temple (Beit HaMikdash).

==Origin==
The Hebrew noun &quot;minḥah&quot; () is used 211 times in the Masoretic Text of the Hebrew Bible, with the first uses referring to vegetable and animal offerings brought by Cain and Abel to God. Most other uses refer to a gift offering, made of grain, which could be offered at any time in the day. However, occasionally the Bible uses &quot;mincha&quot; to specifically refer to the afternoon Temple sacrifice.

Rabbis in the Talmud debate whether the daily prayers have their origin in the behavior of the biblical Patriarchs, or in the Temple sacrifices. According to the first opinion, the Mincha prayer was originated by Isaac, who &quot;went out to converse in the field&quot;, with God. According to the second opinion, the Mincha prayer is based on the afternoon &quot;tamid&quot; (daily) offering which was offered in the Temple each afternoon.

==Time frame for recitation==
Mincha is different from Shacharit and Maariv in that it is recited in the middle of the secular day. Unlike Shacharit, which is recited upon arising, and Maariv, which can be recited before going to sleep, Mincha is the afternoon prayer, and as a result of this, many Mincha groups have formed in workplaces and other places where many Jews are present during the day.

Mincha may be recited beginning half an hour (either regular or relative hours) after &quot;halachic&quot; noontime. This earliest time is referred to as &quot;mincha gedola&quot; (&quot;large mincha&quot;). According to the Shulchan Aruch, it is preferably recited after &quot;mincha ketana&quot; (&quot;small mincha&quot;, 2.5 &quot;halachic&quot; hours before sunset or nightfall), but common practice is to recite it anytime after &quot;mincha gedola&quot; and not to be careful to recite it specifically after &quot;mincha ketana&quot;.

The name &quot;large mincha&quot; may come from the fact that more of the day remains than in &quot;small mincha&quot;.

Ideally, one should complete Mincha before sunset (&quot;shkiah&quot;), although many authorities permit reciting Mincha until nightfall. The Mishnah Berurah states that is preferable to recite mincha without a minyan before &quot;shkiah&quot; than to recite it with a &quot;minyan&quot; after &quot;shkia&quot;.

==Prayers==

Mincha on a weekday exclusive includes prayers found at Shacharit.

Prayers of Mincha include the following:
*Ashrei
*Uva Letzion (on Shabbat and Yom Tov only, in Italian Nusach also on fast days)
*Torah reading (on Shabbat and public fast days only)
*Amidah (in some communities, it includes slight variations from Shacharis) Like in Shacharit, it is generally recited silently and then repeated by the Chazzan.
*Avinu Malkeinu (on Ten Days of Repentance only, and in some communities also on public fast days; omitted on occasions when Tachanun is omitted)
*Tachanun (omitted on Shabbat, Yom Tov, and certain other festive days)
*Tzidkatcha (on Shabbat only; omitted on days when Tachanun would be omitted if it were a weekday)
* In the Sephardic rite (and in some Chasidic communities), a Psalm is recited here: generally, Psalm 67 on weekdays, Psalm 93 on Friday and Psalm 112 on the sabbath.
*Aleinu - In some Ashkenazic communities, this is omitted if followed immediately by Maariv. In the Italian Nusach and Baladi rite, this is never recited at Mincha; in the modern Italian Nusach (although this is a relatively late addition), Psalm of the day or Psalm 67 is recited instead.

Most Sephardim and Italian Jews start the Mincha prayers with Psalm 84 and &quot;Korbanot&quot; (), and usually continue with the &quot;Pittum hakketoret&quot;. The opening section is concluded with . Most non-Chasidic Ashkenizim begin with Ashrei, although many individuals recite the Korban HaTamid beforehand (a very few Nusach Ashkenaz communities have adopted the practice to recite Korban HaTamid () publicly).

On Yom Kippur, Ashkenazim postpone Ashrei and Uva Letzion until the Ne&#x27;ila service.

<doc id="1331897" wikidata="Q3135646" url="?curid=1331897" title="Hill Top, Cumbria">
<text>Hill Top is a 17th-century house in Near Sawrey near Hawkshead, in the English county of Cumbria. It is an example of Lakeland vernacular architecture with random stone walls and slate roof. The house was once the home of children&#x27;s author and illustrator Beatrix Potter who left it to the National Trust. It is a Grade II* listed building. It is open to the public as a writer&#x27;s house museum, shown as Beatrix Potter herself would have known it.

The Hill Top garden is of interest, being maintained in a style in keeping with Potter&#x27;s illustrations.

== Background ==

Hill Top once belonged to Beatrix Potter, the children&#x27;s author and illustrator known for a series of small format books, especially the character Peter Rabbit. Potter bought the house and its working farm in 1905 as her home away from London and her artistic retreat. She left the house to the National Trust upon her death in 1943. The house, farm and nearby villages feature in Potter&#x27;s books, &quot;The Tale of the Pie and the Patty-Pan&quot;, &quot;The Tale of Tom Kitten&quot;, &quot;The Tale of Jemima Puddle-Duck&quot; and &quot;The Tale of Samuel Whiskers or The Roly-Poly Pudding&quot;.

The farm was managed by John Cannon. The wing on the left was built by Potter for Cannon and his family in 1906. &quot;The Tale of Jemima Puddle-Duck&quot; was dedicated to his children, Ralph and Betsy, who appear in the illustrations, as does their mother.

== Points of interest ==
=== Entrance hall===
The entrance hall or kitchen, retains its original stone-flagged floor. The range seen in many of her illustrations was removed but replaced with an identical one in 1983. The wallpaper was reproduced in 1987 from that hung by Potter in 1906 and covers the walls and ceiling. The longcase clock dated ca. 1785, the Chippendale-style chairs, the Georgian-style dresser, a 17th-century oak press cupboard and other furnishings are depicted in some of Potter&#x27;s illustrations. The remains of the historic spiral staircase can be seen in the cupboard to the right of the fireplace.

=== Parlour ===
The parlour is distinguished by an Adam style chimneypiece installed by Potter. Furniture of the early 19th century dominates the room and 18th century English and Chinese porcelains are displayed in a hanging wall cupboard. Potter&#x27;s 1902 coronation teapot displayed in the cupboard was Ribby&#x27;s in &quot;The Tale of the Pie and the Patty-Pan&quot;.

=== Staircase and landing ===
The staircase and landing are familiar to the readers of Potter&#x27;s books. The rail and banisters are probably 18th century. The walnut longcase clock was made by Schofield&#x27;s of Rochdale. Other works of art decorate the area. The carpets were woven to match those in &quot;The Tale of Samuel Whiskers&quot;.

=== The new room ===
Called the new room as it was an extension added by Beatrix at the same time as she built the adjoining house. Beatrix referred to it as the library. It contains five large paintings by her brother Walter Bertram Potter. The single window looks out over the village of Near Sawrey, a scene Beatrix drew for &quot;The Tale of Samuel Whiskers&quot;.

=== The sitting room ===
Originally a farmhouse bedroom, Beatrix used this upstairs space to entertain. The room includes a box piano by Muzio Clementi and Co.

=== The treasure room ===
The smallest room in the house shows off the original oak floors. One floorboard has been cut shorter than the others, which possibly inspired the events in &quot;The Tale of Samuel Whiskers&quot;. Notable items in the room include the dolls house which contains the ham depicted in &quot;The Tale of Two Bad Mice&quot; and a display cabinet featuring miniature bronzes of Beatrix&#x27;s characters.

=== Bedroom ===
The only bedroom in the house contains an ornate four-poster bed dating from the mid-1600s. Beatrix&#x27;s husband William Heelis carved their initials in the fireplace surround.

=== Layout of the house ===
The house contains three rooms downstairs, the entrance hall, parlour and scullery. There are four rooms upstairs; the sitting room, treasure room, bedroom and new room. All of these rooms can be entered by visitors. There are additional rooms not on the visitor route, including a cellar, a landing cupboard and a washroom, which did not contain plumbing, but was simply a space to wash using a bowl of water.

== Garden ==

&quot;The Tale of Tom Kitten&quot; features the Hill Top garden.

There is a vegetable garden, but Mr McGregor&#x27;s vegetables in &quot;The Tale of Peter Rabbit&quot; were painted at a garden called Lingholm as Potter had not yet acquired Hill Top.

== Replicas ==
Hill Top is a frequent destination of Japanese visitors to the UK.
In 2007 a replica of Hill Top was built in a children&#x27;s zoo near the grounds of Daito Bunka University in Tokyo, Japan.

== Related properties ==
The National Trust also displays material related to Beatrix Potter at the Beatrix Potter Gallery at Hawkshead.

<text>Constance Spry (née Fletcher, previously Marr; 5 December 1886 – 3 January 1960) was a British educator, florist and author in the mid-20th century.

== Life ==
Constance Fletcher was born in Derby in 1886, eldest child and only daughter of George and Henrietta Maria (née Dutton) Fletcher. After studying hygiene, physiology and district nursing in Ireland, she lectured on first aid and home care for the newly established Irish Women&#x27;s National Health Association. She married James Heppell Marr in 1910 and moved to Coolbawn, near Castlecomer. In 1912, their son Anthony Heppel Marr was born.

World War I had a profound impact on Constance Marr, and the Fletcher family. After the beginning of the war in 1914, Constance Marr was appointed secretary of the Dublin Red Cross. In 1916, she left both Ireland and her husband, escaping a violent marriage, and moved to Barrow-in-Furness with her son Anthony to work as a welfare supervisor. In 1917, she joined the civil service as the head of women&#x27;s staff (welfare and medical treatment) at the Ministry of Aircraft Production. The same year, two of her brothers – Lieutenant Arnold Lockhart Fletcher and Second Lieutenant Donald Lockhart Fletcher – were killed in action, on 30 and 28 April 1917 respectively. After these losses, her mother did not speak for two years.

In 1921, she was appointed headmistress of the Homerton and South Hackney Day Continuation School in Homerton, east London, where she instructed teenage factory workers in cookery and dressmaking, and later flower arranging. In 1926, she married her second husband, Henry Ernest Spry.

Spry gave up teaching in 1928, to open her first shop, &quot;Flower Decoration&quot;, in 1929. After securing a regular order from Granada Cinemas, she caused a sensation in fashionable society by creating an exquisite arrangement of hedgerow flowers in the windows of Atkinsons, an Old Bond Street perfumery in the West End of London, as part of the decoration undertaken by the theatrical designer Norman Wilkinson. Spry ransacked attics for unusual objects to use as containers and drew inspiration from the Dutch 17th- and 18th-century flower painters, while she popularized unusual plant materials to offset flowers, like pussy willow, weeds and grasses and ornamental kale. The biographer Diana Souhami revealed the painter Gluck had a romantic relationship with Spry, whose work informed the artist&#x27;s admired floral paintings. 

When she opened a larger shop in South Audley Street in Mayfair in 1934, Spry was already employing seventy people. In the same year, she published her first book, &quot;Flower Decoration&quot;, and established the &quot;Constance Spry Flower School&quot; at her new premises. During this period she hired the Australian Patricia Easterbrook Roberts, who later opened the Roberts School of Dramatic Floriculture in Detroit, Michigan. In 2012 English Heritage marked Spry&#x27;s tenure at 64 South Audley Street with a blue plaque.

Her company created the flower arrangements for two royal weddings: the November 1935 nuptials of the Duke of Gloucester to Lady Alice Christabel Montagu-Douglas-Scott, held in the private chapel of Buckingham Palace, and the more private wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor in June 1937. Public interest from these commissions led to two tours of the US. Later, she arranged the flowers for the wedding of Princess Elizabeth and for that of Princess Margaret.

When World War II began in 1939, Spry resumed her teaching career and lectured to women all over Britain. In 1942, she published &quot;Come into The Garden, Cook&quot;, based around French cuisine, hoping to help the war effort by encouraging the British to grow and eat their own food. Her company continued to provide floral decorations at weddings.

In 1946, she opened a domestic science school with her friend, the accomplished Le Cordon Bleu cook Rosemary Hume, at Winkfield Place, at Cranbourne in Winkfield, Berkshire. Constance lived at Orchard Lea, across the road, and then over the stable block at the Place. In 1953, Spry was commissioned to arrange the flowers at Westminster Abbey and along the processional route from Buckingham Palace for the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. The flowers were supplied as gifts by Commonwealth nations. The Le Cordon Bleu students at Winkfield were asked to cater a lunch for foreign delegates, for whom Hume and Spry invented a new dish – coronation chicken. 

She was appointed an OBE in the 1953 Coronation Honours.

At Winkfield Place, Spry devoted years to the cultivation of particular varieties of antique roses, which she was instrumental in bringing back into fashion; David Austin&#x27;s first rose introduction, in 1961, was named after her and is considered to be the foundation of his &quot;English rose&quot; series.

In 1956, she and Hume published the best-selling &quot;Constance Spry Cookery Book&quot;, thereby extending the Spry style from flowers to food. On 3 January 1960, she slipped on the stairs at Winkfield Place and died an hour later. Her last words were supposedly, &quot;Someone else can arrange this&quot;.

==Legacy==

Spry&#x27;s books remained in print for many years after her death and her floristry business thrived until the early 2000s. Her influence in floristry remains strong; for example, luxury florist Nikki Pierce has cited her as an inspiration. 

&quot;Constance Spry: A Millionaire for a Few Pence&quot; was an exhibition at the Design Museum in the autumn of 2004. The curator Libby Sellers called Spry &quot;one of the lost heroes in the history of modernism&quot; but the exhibition led to the resignation of the chair of trustees, James Dyson.

Shane Connolly, who designs flower arrangements for royal occasions as Spry had done, curated an exhibition in 2021 at the Garden Museum, London; this celebration of Spry&#x27;s achievements and life made use of the extensive collection of her personal papers and records in the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Lindley Library.

<text>Karl Heinrich Ritter von Lang (7 June 176426 March 1835) was a German historian and statesman.

==Life==
He was born at Balgheim, near Nördlingen. From the first he was greatly attracted towards historical studies, and this was shown when he began to attend the gymnasium of Oettingen, and in 1782, when he went to the university of Altdorf, near Nuremberg. At the same time he studied jurisprudence, and in 1782 became a government clerk at Oettingen. About the same period he began his activities as a journalist and publicist.

But Lang did not long remain an official. He was of a restless, changeable character, which constantly involved him in personal quarrels, though he was equally quick to retire from them. In 1788 he obtained a position as private tutor in Hungary in family of Johann Calisius from Calish and Johanna Prónay in Bitsitz (today Bytčica, Slovakia), and in 1789 became private secretary to Baron von Buhler, the envoy of Württemberg at Vienna. This led to further travels and to his entering the service of the House of Oettingen-Wallerstein. In 1792 Lang again betook himself to a university, this time to Göttingen. Here he came under the influence of the historian, Ludwig Timotheus Spittler, from whom, as also from Johannes von Muller and Friedrich Schlegel, his historical studies received a fresh impulse.

At intervals from 1793 to 1801 Lang was closely connected with the Prussian statesman Hardenberg, who employed him as his private secretary and archivist, and in 1797 he was present with Hardenberg at the Second Congress of Rastatt as secretary to the legation. He was occupied chiefly with affairs of the principalities of Ansbach and Bayreuth, newly acquired by Prussia, and especially in the settlement of disputes with Bavaria as to their boundaries.

When in 1805 the principalities became part of Bavaria, Lang entered the Bavarian service (1806), was presented with the Merit Order of the Bavarian Crown in 1808, and from 1810 to 1817 held the office of archivist in Munich. He again devoted himself with great enthusiasm to historical studies, which naturally dealt chiefly with Bavarian history. He evolved the theory, among other things, that the boundaries of the old counties or pagi (Gaue) were identical with those of the dioceses. This theory was combated in later days, and caused great confusion in the province of historical geography. For the rest, Lang did great service to the study of the history of Bavaria, especially by bringing fresh material from the archives to bear upon it. He also kept up his activity as a publicist, in 1814 defending in a detailed and somewhat biassed pamphlet the policy of the minister Montgelas, and he undertook critical studies in the history of the Jesuits. In 1817 Lang retired from active life, and until his death in 1835, lived chiefly in Ansbach.

Lang is best known through his &quot;Memoiren&quot;, which were published in Brunswick in two parts in 1842, and were republished in 1881 in a second edition. They contain much of interest for the history of the period, but have to be used with the greatest caution on account of their pronounced tendency to satire. Lang&#x27;s character, as can be gathered especially from a consideration of his behaviour at Munich, is darkened by many shadows. He did not scruple, for instance, to strike out of the lists of witnesses to medieval charters, before publishing them, the names of families which he disliked.

==Selected works==
Of his numerous literary productions the following may be mentioned: 
*&quot;Beiträge zur Kenntnis der natürlichen und politischen Verfassung des oettingischen Vaterlandes&quot; (1786)

<doc id="1331926" wikidata="Q233947" url="?curid=1331926" title="Theodore Schultz">
<text>Theodore William Schultz ( ; 30 April 1902 – 26 February 1998) was an American agricultural economist and chairman of the University of Chicago Department of Economics. Schultz rose to national prominence after winning the 1979 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences.

==Early life and education==
Theodore William Schultz was born on April 30, 1902, in a small town ten miles northwest of Badger, South Dakota, on a 560-acre farm. When Schultz was in the eighth grade, his father Henry decided to pull him out of attending Kingsbury County Schoolhouse. His father&#x27;s view was that if his eldest son continued to get an education he would be less inclined to continue working on the farm. Schultz subsequently did not have any formal post-secondary education.

He eventually enrolled in the Agriculture College at South Dakota State, in a three-year program that met for four months a year during the winter. After being recognized for possessing great potential as a student, Schultz moved on to a bachelor&#x27;s program, earning his degree in 1927 in agriculture and economics. He also received an honorary doctorate of science degree from the college in 1959. He graduated in 1927, then entered the University of Wisconsin–Madison earning his doctorate in Agricultural Economics in 1930 under Benjamin H. Hibbard with a thesis, titled &quot;The Tariff in Relation to the Coarse-Feed Grains and a Development of Some of the Theoretical Aspects of Tariff Price Research.&quot;

==Academic career==
Schultz taught at Iowa State College from 1930 to 1943.
He left Iowa State in the wake of the &quot;oleomargarine controversy&quot;, and he served as the chair of economics at the University of Chicago from 1946 to 1961. He became a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1958, the American Philosophical Society in 1962, and the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1974. He became president of the American Economic Association in 1960. He retired in 1970 though he remained active at the University of Chicago into his 90s until a fractured hip left him bedridden.

Shortly after his move to Chicago, Schultz recruited his former student, D. Gale Johnson to the department. Their research in farm and agricultural economics was widely influential and attracted funding from the Rockefeller Foundation to the agricultural economics program at the university. Among the graduate students and faculty affiliated with the pair in the 1940s and 1950s were Clifford Hardin, Zvi Griliches, Marc Nerlove, and George S. Tolley. In 1979, Schultz was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics for his work in human capital theory and economic development.

==Contribution to economic theory==
===Human capital theory===

While he was chair of economics at Chicago he led research into why post-World War II Germany and Japan recovered, at almost miraculous speeds, from the widespread devastation. Contrast this with the United Kingdom which was still rationing food long after the war. His conclusion was that the speed of recovery was due to a healthy and highly educated population; education makes people productive and good health care keeps the education investment around and able to produce. One of his main contributions was later called Human Capital Theory, which he formulated with the help of Gary Becker and Jacob Mincer. Schultz coined this theory in his book titled Investment in Human Capital; however, he experienced negative feedback from other economists. He states that knowledge and skill are a form of capital, and investments in human capital leads to an increase in both economic output and workers&#x27; earnings. Schultz said the value of labor was determined by the productivity of the labor, which was not a new economic discovery. The point of differentiation was that the labor productivity was based on one&#x27;s investments into their personal &quot;rate of return&quot;. The more skills and education on a resume, the more return one will see on these investments in the form of a larger income. This theory is still in use today, and at face value seems like a positive contribution in studying complex inner workings of differentiating pay scales. However, this has been critiqued as leading towards a lot of biases regarding the observed investments that are realistically achievable for a lower-income worker. In order for many people to make a comfortable, livable wage, it could be argued today that a college degree is the best, most guaranteed step in such a direction. Those who are first generation college students arguably have to invest far more time, money, and effort into higher education in order to receive even a somewhat similar payoff to those with nepotism connections and social qualities perceived as more high-quality. Many economists refused to support his theory of considering humans as a form of capital due to slavery, which at the time was an understandable critique given the civil rights movements at this time. Schultz argues that his theory does not dismiss humanity but instead encourages individuals to invest in themselves. He advocates for humans to invest in their health, internal migration, and on-the-job training; however, he focuses on encouraging individuals to better their education in order to increase their level of productivity. He states that if people were to do these things, they would have many more opportunities available for them to better their economic situations.

He also inspired much work in international development in the 1980s, motivating investments in vocational and technical education by Bretton Woods system International Financial Institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. During his research Schultz got down to details and went out among the poor farming nations of Europe, talking to farmers and political leaders in small towns. He was &quot;not afraid to get his shoes a little muddy.&quot; He noticed that the aid the United States sent in the form of food or money was not only of little help but actually harmful to such nations, as the farmers and agricultural producers within those nations were not able to compete with the free prices of the &quot;aid&quot; sent and therefore they were not able to sustain themselves or invest the money they made from crops back into the economy. He theorized that if the U.S. instead used its resources to help educate these rural producers and provide them with technology and innovations they would be more stable, productive and self sustaining in the long run. This was another key part of his work &quot;Investment in Human Capital&quot;.

===Agricultural Development Theory===
One of Theodore Schultz’s major contributions to economic theory is his theory outlined in his book Transforming Traditional Agriculture which was published in 1964. This theory combats a popular thought at the time held among development economists that the unwillingness of farmers of poor underdeveloped countries to innovate and expand their agricultural sectors was an irrational decision. Schultz argued that the farmers in these poor underdeveloped countries are making the most rational decision to not innovate or expand the agricultural sector because of high taxes and artificially low agriculture prices set by their governments. Schultz stated that in these poor underdeveloped countries resources were already being perfectly allocated and agriculture was already efficient. Despite these two things farmers in these countries were still poor, so the only solution to this problem was the transformation of their traditional agriculture system. Schultz argued that the best change to make for these poor underdeveloped countries to make was to replace all old inputs with new more profitable inputs. He stated the best way to do this was with a market approach where farmers were left free to decide which changes in the factors of production would be made. With this approach they would be free to try out any new innovations in technology and change in crops they decide to grow in pursuit of profits with very limited government intervention.

Schultz was awarded the Nobel Prize jointly with Sir William Arthur Lewis in 1979 for his work in development economics, focusing on the economics of agriculture. He analyzed the role of agriculture within the economy, and his work has had far reaching implications for industrialization policy, both in developing and developed nations. Schultz also promulgated the idea of educational capital, an offshoot of the concept of human capital, relating specifically to the investments made in education.

==Family and personal life==
Schultz married Esther Florence Werth (1905–1991) in 1930. She was born and raised on a farm near Frankfort, South Dakota, of German parents, who encouraged her to pursue schooling. Werth was the first in her family to attend college, receiving a bachelor&#x27;s degree in commercial science from South Dakota State College in Brookings in 1927, and subsequently worked as a school teacher in Waubay, South Dakota, from 1927 to 1929 and then in Gregory, South Dakota, from 1929 to 1930. Werth shared Schultz&#x27;s background in agriculture and commitment to ideals of education and economic development, and throughout his career worked as a primary editor of his published works. In his Nobel Prize Lecture, he acknowledged her contributions thus: &quot;I am also indebted to my wife, Esther Schultz, for her insistence that what I thought was stated clearly was not clear enough.&quot; The couple was survived by two daughters and one son.

==Legacy==
Schultz received eight honorary degrees in his career. He had the distinction of being the first South Dakota State University graduate and the second South Dakotan to win a Nobel Prize after Ernest Lawrence winner of the 1939 Nobel Prize for Physics. Between 2012 and 2013, South Dakota State University built the Theodore W. Schultz Hall, a residence hall for students pursuing degrees in agriculture. 
Schultz also was awarded the Francis A. Walker Medal in 1972, which is the highest award given out by the American Economic Association.

Schultz died in Evanston, Illinois, on February 26, 1998, at the age of 95. He is interred at Badger Cemetery in Badger, South Dakota.

==Quotes==


Farmers the world over, in dealing with costs, returns and risks, are calculating economic agents. Within their small, individual, allocative domain, they are fine-tuning entrepreneurs, tuning so subtly that many experts fail to recognize how efficient they are. – Theodore W. Schultz 1980

<text>Zarafshon (, ) is a city in the center of Uzbekistan&#x27;s Navoiy Region. Administratively, it is a district-level city, that includes the urban-type settlement Muruntau. It has an area of and 85,100 inhabitants (2021). Located in the Kyzylkum Desert, it receives water from the Amudarya by a 220-km pipeline.

Zarafshon is called &quot;the gold capital of Uzbekistan&quot;. It is home of the Navoi Mining &amp; Metallurgy Combinat&#x27;s Central Mining Administration, charged with mining and processing gold from the nearby Muruntau open-pit mine. Between 1995 and 2006, the Muruntau gold mining and processing operation was run by the Zarafshan-Newmont Joint Venture, a foreign direct investment by Newmont Mining Corporation of Denver, Colorado (at the time the largest U.S. investor in Uzbekistan - it was also the first major Western investment in the region since the breakup of the Soviet Union). Uzbekistan expropriated the company&#x27;s assets in 2006 and by 2007 had taken full ownership of the mine.

Zarafshan Airport is served by Uzbekistan Airlines with direct daily flights to and from Tashkent.

Zarafshon is the sister city of Clinton, Mississippi USA

Construction of the city began in the early 1960s and continued until the collapse of the USSR, 1965 is considered the official year of the city&#x27;s foundation. On January 16, 1967, Zarafshon received the status of an urban-type settlement. At the time of the collapse of the USSR, the city had 12 microdistricts with typical Soviet (3-, 4-, 5-, 7- and 9-story) buildings. There were 8 comprehensive schools and 21 kindergartens in the city.

Initially, the city was created as the residence of workers servicing industrial facilities for gold mining located at Muruntau Mine and «Bessopan» industrial site and being a part of Navoi Mining and Metallurgy Combinat. Gold production from the Muruntau Mine deposit accounted for approximately 30% of total gold production in the USSR.

During the Soviet period, the gold mine was being developed non-stop. Workers were recruited from all over the Soviet Union, and only a few left to return.

Zarafshon became the third industrial city in Navoiy region, after Uchquduq and Navoiy, built due to the establishment of city-forming enterprises (Navoi Mining and Metallurgical Combinat and Navoiyazot) in the region in the late 50s and early 60s.

The largest division of Navoi Mining and Metallurgical Combinat is located in the city of Zarafshon, it is the Central Mining Department, which currently includes 29 main and auxiliary divisions.

<text>&quot;Three Gays of the Condo&quot; is the seventeenth episode of the fourteenth season of the American animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 13, 2003. The episode was written by Matt Warburton and directed by Mark Kirkland.

In this episode, Homer learns that Marge was planning on leaving him but got pregnant with Bart, so he thinks that is the reason she stayed with him. Upset, Homer moves in with two gay men, Grady and Julio. Musician &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic appeared as himself.

The episode received mixed reviews. However, the episode won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program, and writer Matt Warburton won the Annie Award for Outstanding Achievement for Writing in an Animated Television/Broadcast Production for this episode.

==Plot==
The Simpson family is working on a jigsaw puzzle. When they learn the final piece is missing, the family looks for it. Homer looks through Marge&#x27;s memory box and finds a poster of Moe&#x27;s Tavern&#x27;s grand opening (advertised as Meaux&#x27;s Tavern). On the back, Marge wrote that Homer made the opening the worst night of her life by making her sit there while he got drunk and played an arcade game. Later, as she took him to the hospital for alcohol poisoning, she wrote that she was leaving him. Wondering why Marge stayed with him, Homer finds a hospital appointment card dated two days later, confirming she was pregnant with Bart. When Homer confronts Marge, she says she was upset that night but admits that Homer still does things that annoy her. Homer realizes Marge has been secretly resenting him.

The next day, they argue again, and Homer leaves the house. He finds a newspaper with an apartment listing asking for a third roommate. Learning that the apartment is in Springfield&#x27;s gay district, Homer moves in with a gay couple, Grady and Julio. Julio is unsure about Homer, but Grady likes him. At home, Lisa misses Homer and wants Marge to apologize. At a gay club, Homer tells Grady and Julio that his relationship with Marge is in trouble.

Marge and the kids visit Homer and bring &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic, who sings a parody of John Mellencamp&#x27;s &quot;Jack &amp; Diane&quot;, to tell Homer that Marge loves him. Marge asks Homer out on a date. As he prepares, Homer gets nervous and drinks margaritas. When he arrives, she is upset that he is late and drunk, and she leaves him. Later, Grady comforts Homer and kisses him. Homer realizes that Grady has feelings for him, and he jumps out of a window, saddening Grady. At Moe&#x27;s, Homer is about to realize that all his problems are caused by alcohol when Moe forces beer down Homer&#x27;s throat, giving him alcohol poisoning, and takes him to the hospital. After Homer awakens, Dr. Hibbert tells him that this was not as bad as the first time he treated him for alcohol poisoning. Homer says it was the night that destroyed his marriage. Hibbert disagrees and plays a tape from the first incident where Marge says that she loves him, proving she married him because she loved him. Marge arrives and says she still does, and they reconcile.

==Production==

Harvey Fierstein was asked to reprise his role as Karl from the second season episode &quot;Simpson and Delilah&quot; in a cameo appearance. In the script, Homer was thrown out of the house by Marge, and encountered Karl. The purpose of the appearance was to introduce a gay couple that Homer would live with. Fierstein however felt that &quot;the script was a lot of very clever gay jokes, and there just wasn&#x27;t that &quot;Simpsons&quot; twist&quot; and turned the role down.

The jigsaw puzzle that the family builds is titled &quot;Concert in Golden Gate Park&quot;. Writer Michael Price pitched a joke where Homer drools &quot;mmm, Ferlinghetti...&quot; in reference to Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Poet Laureate of San Francisco.

In December 2018, as part of the 30th anniversary of the series, this episode was selected by executive producer Al Jean to represent the fourteenth season during a &quot;Simpsons&quot; marathon on FXX.

==Reception==
===Viewing figures===
The episode was watched by 12.02 million viewers, which was the 19th most watched show that week.

===Critical response===
The episode was part of a DVD boxed set release called &quot;The Simpsons Kiss and Tell: The Story of Their Love&quot;, and in his review of the release, Andy Dougan of the &quot;Evening Times&quot; characterized the episode along with &quot;Natural Born Kissers&quot;, &quot;Large Marge&quot;, and &quot;The Way We Weren&#x27;t&quot;, as &quot;four of the funniest episodes of recent series&quot;.

Comparing the episode with eighth season episode &quot;Homer&#x27;s Phobia&quot;, which also dealt with the topic of homosexuality, Jackson Cresswell of &quot;Collider&quot; said the previous episode was better. He thought this episode, which was another one that dealt with a separation of Homer and Marge, &quot;had been done many times before and was a weak device to get to the observational and situational comedy.&quot;

On &quot;Four Finger Discount&quot;, Guy Davis and Brendan Dando called the content regarding homosexuality to be &quot;more sensitive and insightful and fun and inclusive&quot; than the rest of the episode although it would be insensitive in 2021. They also questioned why Marge needed to be the one to apologize to Homer.

===Awards and nominations===
At the 55th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards, the episode won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (Programming Less Than One Hour). At the 31st Annie Awards, writer Matt Warburton won the Annie Award for Outstanding Achievement for Writing in an Animated Television/Broadcast Production for his script to this episode.

<doc id="1331939" wikidata="Q2410596" url="?curid=1331939" title="Hegemon of Thasos">
<text>Hegemon of [[Thasos]] () was a Greek writer of the Old Comedy. Hardly anything is known of him, except that he flourished during the Peloponnesian War. According to Aristotle (&quot;Poetics&quot;, ii. 5) he was the inventor of a kind of parody; by slightly altering the wording in well-known poems he transformed the sublime into the ridiculous. When the news of the disastrous defeat of the Sicilian Expedition reached Athens, his parody of the &quot;Gigantomachia&quot; was being performed: it is said that the audience were so amused by it that, instead of leaving to show their grief, they remained in their seats.

He was also the author of a comedy called &quot;Philinne&quot; (Philine), written in the manner of Eupolis and Cratinus, in which he attacked a well-known courtesan. Athenaeus (p. 698), who preserves some parodic hexameters of his, relates other anecdotes concerning him (pp. 5, 108, 407).

==Criticisms==
In Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Poetics&quot;, Aristotle states &quot;Homer, for example, makes men better than they are; Cleophon as they are; Hegemon the Thasian, the inventor of parodies, and Nicochares, the author of the Diliad, worse than they are.&quot;

<doc id="1331958" wikidata="Q4974441" url="?curid=1331958" title="Murder of Brooke Hart and the lynching of Thomas Harold Thurmond and John M. Holmes">
<text>Brooke Leopold Hart (June 11, 1911 – November 9, 1933) was the eldest son of Alexander Hart, the owner of the L. Hart &amp; Son department store in downtown San Jose, California, United States. His kidnapping and murder were heavily publicized, and the subsequent lynching of his alleged murderers, Thomas Harold Thurmond and John M. Holmes, sparked widespread political debate.

The lynchings were carried out by a mob of San Jose citizens in St. James Park across from the Santa Clara County Jail, and were broadcast as a &quot;live&quot; event by a Los Angeles radio station. The killings were tacitly endorsed by Governor James Rolph Jr., who said he would pardon anyone convicted of the lynching. Scores of reporters, photographers, and newsreel camera operators, along with an estimated 3,000 to 10,000 men, women, and children, were witness to it. When newspapers published photos, identifiable faces were deliberately smudged so that they would remain anonymous; the following Monday, local newspapers published 1.2 million copies, twice the normal daily production.

This incident is sometimes referred to as &quot;the last lynching in California&quot;, although Clyde Johnson was lynched near Yreka in August 1935, and the last true California lynching is said to have occurred on January 6, 1947, in Callahan, but the name of the victim has never been released and the event cannot be confirmed in any printed news publications.

==Background==

In 1933, 22-year-old Brooke Hart was the heir to one of San Jose, California&#x27;s best-known businesses, the L. Hart &amp; Son department store, located at the southeast corner of Market and Santa Clara streets. Brooke&#x27;s grandfather and the store&#x27;s namesake, Leopold Hart, was an Alsatian immigrant who bought a mercantile shop known as the Cash Corner store in 1866. After Leopold&#x27;s son, Alex J. Hart Sr. (known as A.J.) took over the business, it expanded to the landmark status it held in San Jose for four decades – becoming as much a part of the fabric of the city as Macy&#x27;s was in New York City or Neiman Marcus was in Dallas.

The Hart store was famous for its attentive customer service, and benefited from the deep loyalty of customers and employees alike. When the country found itself in the grip of the Great Depression, Hart&#x27;s held on to its central place in the lives of San Jose&#x27;s citizens, and continued to buy advertising in local publications. The Hart family was one of the city&#x27;s most prominent, and their influence was the source of many colorful stories: one such tale recounts that the artist who repainted the ceiling of the Cathedral Basilica of St. Joseph in the 1920s modeled the cherubs in his work on the family&#x27;s children.

Brooke Hart had worked in his family&#x27;s department store during much of his youth and was well-known and liked by the local community. After he graduated from Santa Clara University, his father, A.J., made him a junior vice president and began grooming him to take over when he retired.

==Disappearance==

Just before 6:00 p.m. on Thursday, November 9, 1933, Brooke Hart retrieved his 1933 Studebaker President roadster, a graduation present from his parents, from a downtown San Jose parking lot behind the department store. He had agreed to chauffeur his father, A.J., who did not drive, to a meeting of the Chamber of Commerce at the San Jose Country Club.

When Brooke did not turn up to collect his father, A.J. became concerned. As hours passed and there remained no sign of Brooke, the Hart family&#x27;s anxiety grew; Brooke was responsible and punctual, and his absence was entirely out of character. A.J. confessed his worry to Perry Belshaw, the manager of the San Jose Country Club, during dinner; after Brooke&#x27;s friend phoned to say the younger Hart had missed an appointment at 8:00 p.m., A.J. called the police to determine if his son had been involved in an accident.

According to the parking lot attendant, Brooke had left the lot heading east on Santa Clara Avenue at 6:05 p.m.; he was later spotted around 6:30 p.m. by a Hart store employee at Santa Clara and Fourteenth. Finally, a rancher in Milpitas, seven miles north of San Jose, saw a man matching Hart&#x27;s description standing alone next to an automobile on Evans Lane at approximately 7 p.m.; when the rancher returned, he saw the car still parked there at approximately 8:30 p.m. with no one else present.

===Ransom demands===
At 9:30 that night, Aleese Hart, the older of Brooke&#x27;s two younger sisters, answered the telephone at the family home and was informed by a &quot;soft-spoken man&quot; that Hart had been kidnapped and that instructions for his return would be provided later. At 10:30, what sounded like the same man called and informed the other sister, Miriam, that her brother would be returned upon payment of $40,000 (equivalent to $916,960 in 2022). Delivery instructions would be provided the next day. According to phone company records, the kidnappers had tried to reach the Hart home three times but the line was busy before they were finally connected. Belshaw lived near the site where the Studebaker had been parked and reported the abandoned car in Milpitas to the police at 11 p.m.; it was positively identified as Brooke&#x27;s.

The San Jose Police Department, the Santa Clara County Sheriff&#x27;s Office, and the U.S. Division of Investigation (the forerunner of the FBI) were quickly brought into the case. The phone calls were traced to locations in San Francisco; the call that connected was traced to the Whitcomb Hotel. However, the search initially focused on the hilly region surrounding Calaveras Dam and the city of Oakland; the call&#x27;s origin was thought to be a decoy action.

Hart&#x27;s wallet was discovered in San Francisco on the guard rail of the tanker &quot;Midway&quot;, which had been refueling the Matson Lines passenger liner when both ships were docked at Pier 32 from midnight to 5 a.m. It was assumed the wallet had been tossed from a porthole on the liner. &quot;Lurline&quot; was stopped and searched in Los Angeles when it arrived there on its way to Honolulu on November 11, but nothing was found. Police then advanced an alternative theory: since Pier 32, from which &quot;Lurline&quot; had departed, was close to the sewer outfall, the heavily laden tanker might have dipped below the surface and picked up the wallet from where it had been discharged from the sewer, lifting it from the bay once a sufficient amount of fuel had been offloaded. One of the passengers detained during the three-hour search was Babe Ruth, who was traveling to Los Angeles to watch a football game between Southern California and Stanford.

At the time, the &quot;Oakland Tribune&quot; named Charles &quot;Pretty Boy&quot; Floyd a suspect in the kidnapping, as he was reportedly present in California. Floyd was later spotted in Almaden, near abandoned quicksilver mine shafts. While searching for Floyd or Hart at the mine, a man claiming to be Floyd boarded a bus in Modesto and robbed passengers using a gun.

The Hart family chartered an airplane to look for cabins in the hills near Milpitas starting on November 12, following up a theory that Brooke had been first lured to the area where his car was abandoned, and the kidnappers then took him from there. Because the car&#x27;s lights were left on, and there were signs of a scuffle, authorities believed Brooke had been overpowered in Milpitas. In addition, witnesses who had seen Brooke driving the Studebaker said that he was alone, although in some cases visibility was poor.

A &quot;compromise ransom&quot; telegram from Sacramento arrived on November 12, suggesting that would be sufficient. However, the family was not contacted again until Monday, November 13, when a letter, postmarked in Sacramento, arrived in the mail at the department store. It instructed A.J. to have a radio installed in the Studebaker (which already had a radio), because the ransom instructions would be broadcast over NBC radio station KPO. The kidnapper also instructed A.J. to be ready to drive the Studebaker to deliver the ransom, but A.J. had never learned to drive. On November 13, A.J. posted a $5,000 reward for his son&#x27;s safe return, with a promise to drop any further investigation upon his return. To emphasize the validity of the reward offer, police announced they would not be tracing calls to the Hart residence. However, this was a ruse to entrap the kidnappers; in fact, the telephone line continued to be tapped.

On Tuesday, November 14, a second ransom note arrived, this time postmarked in San Francisco. It instructed A.J. to place the ransom in a black satchel and drive to Los Angeles. That night, A.J. took a call from a man claiming to be his son&#x27;s kidnapper, who instructed him to take the night train to Los Angeles. The authorities staked out the train station and mistakenly arrested a bank teller out for an evening stroll. The next day, a sign was placed in a window of the Hart store stating that A.J. did not drive. A call was received that night again demanding that Hart drive to deliver the ransom. Hart demanded proof that his son was with the caller. The caller stated that Brooke was being held at a safe location. Because a phone tap had been placed on the Hart telephone, the call was traced to a garage in downtown San Jose, but the caller was gone by the time the authorities arrived.

===Arrests and confessions===

Another demand arrived the following day, November 16, again ordering A.J. to drive with the ransom. That night, another call was received and the demand that A.J. drive was repeated. The call was traced to a payphone in a parking garage at Market near San Antonio, and Police Chief J.N. Black and Sheriff William Emig hurried to the scene just from the San Jose Police station, where they arrested Thomas Harold Thurmond as he was hanging up, at about 8:00 p.m.

At 3:00 a.m., Thurmond, after hours of questioning, signed a confession in which he claimed to have bound Brooke&#x27;s hands with wire and tossed him off the San Mateo Bridge into San Francisco Bay sometime between 7:00 and 7:30 on the night of the kidnapping. He also identified an accomplice: John Holmes, a recently unemployed salesman who was separated from his wife and two children. Holmes was arrested in his SRO room at the California Hotel near the San Jose Police station at 3:30 a.m. According to Thurmond&#x27;s confession, Holmes approached him with the scheme six weeks prior, after he had separated from his family.

At 1:00 p.m. on November 17, Holmes signed a confession admitting that he and Thurmond had kidnapped Brooke and thrown him into San Francisco Bay. Later, the Santa Clara County District Attorney advised the press that, unless corroborated by independent evidence, confessions by Thurmond and Holmes in which each blamed the other for the crime were not admissible in a court of law. In his confession, Holmes stated that Thurmond had come up with the plan: &quot;A couple of days before the kidnapping, [Thurmond and I] went to a show. On the way out he grabbed my arm and said, &#x27;There goes Brookie Hart. If we pick him up we can get a nice piece of change.&quot; In Thurmond&#x27;s earlier confession, he stated Holmes made the decision to murder Brooke: &quot;Thursday afternoon, November 9, I went to Merritt&#x27;s plumbing shop and bought three bricks for 10 cents each and 55 cents&#x27; worth of wire to make preparations to kidnap Brooke Hart. I don&#x27;t know whether Holmes planned to murder the boy at that time but at any rate we wanted to be prepared.&quot;

According to the men&#x27;s confessions, when Brooke stopped his car near the exit of the parking lot in the evening of November 9, Thurmond slipped into the passenger seat and, holding a gun on him, forced Brooke to drive to Milpitas. There they abandoned the Studebaker for another waiting car, which had been driven to the rendezvous point by Holmes, and the group of three drove to the San Mateo Bridge.

A mother and daughter on a farm immediately south of Milpitas had seen a dark, long-hooded sedan with three men stopped near their barn. A few minutes after it stopped, a convertible (presumably the Studebaker roadster) with three men two on the running boards and one driving stopped near the sedan. Their description of the man driving the convertible, slender with light colored hair, matched the description of Brooke, as did the convertible as his car. Brooke was driven away in the larger car. According to the farmers, one of the group followed in the Studebaker. The mother did not report the events until the following Monday (November 13), when she was visiting relatives and learned about the kidnapping. The investigators did not agree on the veracity of the story, because the number of kidnappers did not agree with the recorded confessions.

On the bridge, the men ordered Brooke out of the car, and one of the kidnappers struck him twice on the head from behind with a concrete block until he was unconscious. They then bound his arms with baling wire and tied two concrete blocks to his feet before dumping him off the bridge into the bay. The tide was out and there were only a few feet of water at the base of the bridge; the kidnappers then shot Brooke, killing him. According to Thurmond&#x27;s confession, Brooke struggled in the water for a few minutes and may have been able to free himself from his bonds; after they had tossed him over the north side of the bridge, he moved south under the bridge, against the prevailing current. Thurmond also stated Holmes was the first to shoot at Brooke, but Thurmond shot at him after he had drifted under the bridge. After leaving Brooke in the bay, they stopped approximately from the eastern end, where they discarded an extra concrete block and a roll of wire, which were recovered after the confessions. A few hours later, they placed the first telephone call to the Hart family demanding $40,000 for Hart&#x27;s return.

Two men scavenging for wood in the bay, Cal Coley and Vinton Ridley, heard screams for help at approximately 7:25 p.m. on the night of November 9, when Brooke was kidnapped, and tried to rescue him, but were hampered by muddy conditions. The two said the cries for help came from the bridge near the shore of Alameda, but added they did not hear any shots that night.

Local newspapers reported that Holmes and Thurmond had met with psychiatrists and would attempt to plead not guilty by reason of insanity. Thurmond claimed he had been &quot;crazy&quot; for more than a year, since his sweetheart married another man, and Holmes planned to repudiate his confession, which his attorney claimed had been &quot;forced from him by third-degree methods&quot;, including threats to &quot;turn him over to the mob for lynching if he did not confess&quot;. Upon learning of rumors of a possible insanity plea on the part of Thurmond, law enforcement authorities directed two psychiatrists from Agnews State Mental Hospital in Santa Clara to examine the two men to preclude such a defense. Following cursory examinations in their cells at the Santa Clara County Jail, with a mob outside in the jail courtyard, both men were declared sane.

===Search for the body===
Police officers from Santa Clara, San Mateo, and Alameda Counties began searching the bay around the bridge, hoping to find Brooke&#x27;s body. Trace evidence, including stains on the bridge, &quot;blonde hair on a brick&quot; and other markings convinced authorities the confessors had truthfully described the sequence of events, including dumping Brooke.

The first physical clues were unearthed on November 18. Two bricks and apparent bloodstains were found at the bridge. The pillowcase used to mask Brooke during the drive to the bridge was discovered, along with his hat, by November 20. The discovery of the hat ended the last hope of the family that Brooke would be found alive. A hook-studded apparatus was used to drag the bay, with no success. A weighted dummy was planned to be dropped from the bridge on November 21 in an attempt to see where it would float. Workers constructing a pier of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge reported seeing a body floating in the water during the night of November 22, prompting a search by Oakland and San Francisco police boats, including the shores of nearby Goat Island. Alex Hart announced a reward on November 24, hoping to &quot;enlist the aid of the public in the search&quot;. By that time, the search involved a blimp from Sunnyvale, police boats from Oakland and San Francisco, United States Marines and a hydraulic pump to dredge the mud from underneath the San Mateo Bridge.

The official search for Brooke&#x27;s body ended on November 25. The next day, two duck hunters from Redwood City discovered a badly decayed and crab-eaten body approximately south of the bridge. Brooke&#x27;s body was identified by the coroner and his friends and employees later that day, with several personal effects with the body matched to Brooke&#x27;s known possessions. According to the autopsy, Brooke had died from drowning, and there were no bullet wounds found.

==Lynching of Thurmond and Holmes==
===Warning signs===

Because of lynch threats, Sheriff Emig moved Thurmond and Holmes to the Potrero Hill police station in San Francisco for safekeeping soon after their arrest. A San Jose newspaper ran a front-page editorial branding Holmes and Thurmond &quot;human devils&quot; and called for &quot;mob violence&quot;. Upon their return to the San Francisco jail from questioning, cries of &quot;lynch them&quot; were heard from the crowd surrounding that jail. On November 21, Holmes and Thurmond remained in the jail, and fear of vigilantism led authorities to announce they would be held &quot;indefinitely&quot;. Reportedly, &quot;20 influential friends of the socially prominent Hart family&quot; had formed a committee to &quot;insist on immediate and drastic punishment for the prisoners&quot;. Prosecutors declined to seek grand jury hearings in the fear that an indictment would incite vigilantes.
Despite these fears, the pair were indicted on charges of extortion, using the mails for extortion, and conspiracy, and were returned to the San Jose jail the night of November 22. On November 23, California Governor James Rolph announced to shocked reporters that he would refuse to dispatch the National Guard to protect Thurmond and Holmes.

Upon payment of cashan astonishing sum in 1933by the father of Jack Holmes, San Francisco attorney Vincent Hallinan agreed to represent his son. Thurmond was defended by J. Oscar Goldstein of Chico. With a volatile mob growing day and night outside the jail on November 24, Hallinan called Rolph and asked that he call out the National Guard should an effort be made to lynch his client. Rolph retorted that he would &quot;pardon the lynchers&quot;.

===Overnight lynching November 26–27===
Authorities &quot;expected trouble if and when the missing body was found&quot;. After the discovery of Brooke&#x27;s body on Sunday, November 26, word went out immediately throughout northern California. All day Sunday and into the evening, radio stations issued inflammatory announcements that a lynching would occur that night in St. James Park in San Jose. Crowds began to gather outside the jail at around 11 a.m., shortly after local newspapers had run extra editions announcing that Brooke&#x27;s body had been found. Sheriff Emig pre-emptively ordered the erection of an improvised barricade of parked automobiles and trucks to protect the jail. By 9:00 p.m., a mob estimated by the press to range anywhere from 5,000 to 15,000 men, women, and children were jammed into the park, with an estimated 3,000 vehicles left on streets nearby.

Governor Rolph was in regular telephonic communication with Raymond Cato, whom he had appointed to head the California Highway Patrol. Cato was ensconced in the home of a Rolph political ally and neighbor in the mountains west of San Jose with an open phone line to the jail. Although the crowd was characterized as &quot;good natured&quot; earlier in the day, periodically there was an ominous chanting of &quot;Eleven o&#x27;clock!&quot;
At approximately 9:00 p.m., Rolph canceled a planned trip to the Western Governors&#x27; Conference in Boise, Idaho, to prevent his chief political rival, Lieutenant Governor Frank Merriam, from calling out the National Guard to stop the lynchings. At approximately the same time, the crowd began demanding the jail surrender Holmes and Thurmond; they responded to the refusal by moving the improvised siege barriers aside. Sheriff Emig contacted Rolph at 10:30 p.m., asking that the National Guard be deployed to protect the prisoners. Rolph refused. The assault on the jail commenced at approximately 11 p.m.

By midnight, thousands had gathered outside the jail; the sheriff&#x27;s deputies fired tear gas into the crowd in an attempt to disperse them. However, the crowd became angrier and larger. After the first round of tear gas was launched into the crowd, the nearby construction site at the post office was raided for materials that were first thrown at the jail; later, a battering ram was improvised from a heavy pipe. Emig ordered his officers to abandon the bottom two floors of the jail, where Thurmond and Holmes were being held. It was later noted that both cells had been occupied by other notorious murderers. Emig also had ordered that no police officer would be allowed to use their guns or clubs to defend the jail; Emig, his nine deputies, and eight state patrolmen were all beaten, choked, and/or trampled during the course of the riot.

The mob, by this time estimated at 6,000–10,000 (other reports say 3,000–5,000), stormed the jail, took Holmes and Thurmond across the street to St. James Park, and hanged them. Afterward, deputy sheriff John Moore stated, &quot;I never knew human beings could go so wildthey were not human; they were animals.&quot; Deputy Moore was choked twice during the lynching: once when he refused to surrender the keys to the jail cells, and another time when he refused to positively identify Holmes for the mob. Some women in the mob were alleged to have encouraged the violence, seemingly forgetting their prior advice to let the law &quot;take its course&quot;. 

Thurmond was the first to be lynched. As he was dragged from the jail headfirst, the mob beat him and knotted the rope around his neck; one man who attempted to stop the lynching was &quot;picked up bodily and hurled almost over the heads of the crowd&quot;. After Thurmond was hanged, the mob tore his trousers off and souvenir hunters fought over the scraps. Holmes cried, &quot;You&#x27;re making a big mistake! I&#x27;m not the man you want!&quot; as he was lynched. Harold Fitzgerald described the scene in an &quot;Oakland Tribune&quot; article: &quot;A concerted pulland the white, blood-streaked body of the second of Brooke Hart&#x27;s murderers swayed in a grisly rhythm in the light of a rising half-moon. A roar, mingled with women&#x27;s screams, rolled across the park ... [Afterward,] The crowd began pouring out of the park. Some did serpentine dances in the streets. ... Snatches of song came from here and there in the multitude.&quot;

===Immediate aftermath===

The bodies of Thurmond and Holmes were left hanging for approximately 45 minutes, until they were cut down by police officials. Thurmond was buried in an unmarked plot in Oak Hill Memorial Park on November 29, the same cemetery where Brooke had been buried on November 27. Holmes was cremated at Oak Hill on November 29.

According to the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, on December 2, after a special meeting of the city council heard testimony in support of leaving the cork elm tree as a monument and warning to evildoers, the council approved the cutting down of the tree by city workers. Police were required to keep off a crowd of souvenir hunters seeking a twig or branch of the infamous &quot;gallows tree&quot;, the bark and lower branches having been hacked and stripped for mementos.

==Impact of the case==
The lynching was unique in American political and criminal justice history because of the involvement of a state governor, and the eagerness by civic and business leaders and law enforcement, to allow the extrajudicial killings of two men who had not been indicted, arraigned, tried, or sentenced for the crime in a court of law. Many modern historians conclude that the two men were indeed guilty.
Royce Brier, a staff writer for the &quot;Chronicle&quot;, would later go on to win the 1934 Pulitzer Prize for Reporting for . According to the prize citation, Brier worked for sixteen hours along with several assistants mingling with the mob and telephoning running updates from a garage across the street from the jail before composing the story in three hours starting at 12:30 a.m. on the morning of November 27. In addition, the Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning went to Edmund Duffy of &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; for his cartoon, &quot;California Points With Pride&quot;, which lampooned Governor Rolph&#x27;s response to the lynching.

===Prosecution of lynch mob===
Governor Rolph praised the action, stating that California had sent a message to future kidnappers, and promised to pardon anyone involved in the lynching. However, Rolph died on June 2, 1934, before any charges had been filed in the case.

Alameda County District Attorney Earl Warren was the strongest supporter of prosecution for the lynching. Santa Clara County Assistant District Attorney Herbert Bridges was quoted as saying he was &quot;not sorry [the lynching] happened in San Jose&quot;. Santa Clara County District Attorney Fred Thomas doubted anyone could be found to bear witness against the ringleaders of the lynching, characterizing the stories being told by local youths as &quot;boastful&quot; but uncorroborated. The American Civil Liberties Union stated they had found eyewitnesses ready to identify members of the mob by December 1933, but San Jose citizens were outspoken in their opposition to &quot;outsider&quot; interference. Eventually seven people were arrested for the lynchings, but none was convicted. California did not specifically define lynching as a crime, although crimes committed during the lynching such as rioting, assault, and murder could potentially be prosecuted.

One young man was charged for participating in the lynching after he publicly claimed credit for leading the mob, but the charges were dropped. The Santa Clara County grand jury met the following year, but despite literally thousands of witnesses, scores of reporters, and hundreds of photographs, they found that no witnesses could identify anyone from the lynching, so no charges were filed.

===Public criticism===
In the aftermath of the lynching, Governor Rolph was publicly condemned for advocating &quot;lynch law&quot; by former President Herbert Hoover, then at Stanford University in Palo Alto. Rolph replied, &quot;If troops had been called out, hundreds of innocent citizens might have been mowed down.&quot; Rolph accused Hoover of calling out the United States Army against the &quot;Bonus Marchers&quot; in 1932. The exchange continued. President Franklin D. Roosevelt also condemned the lynching as &quot;collective murder&quot; in a nationwide radio address.

===Civil suits===
Holmes&#x27; parents sued Governor Rolph for his role in the lynching of their son, along with radio station KQW and several other persons, but the suit was dropped when the governor died of a heart attack in 1934. Holmes&#x27;s widow sued Sheriff Emig and several deputies, citing their carelessness and negligence in failing to protect him. Thurmond&#x27;s family took no action on his behalf and reportedly never again spoke about the matter amongst themselves.

==Family==
Brooke Hart had three sisters Jeanette, Miriam, and Aleese and a brother, Alexander Joseph Jr.
Alex J. Hart sold the chain of stores in 1976.

==Modern coverage==
In 1983, Harry Farrell, a columnist for the &quot;San Jose Mercury News&quot;, wrote about the lynching in a two-part series. After he retired, he followed up with a book on the same subject, &quot;Swift Justice&quot;, published in 1992. &quot;Swift Justice&quot; was praised by Walter Cronkite and won an Edgar Award in 1993.

In his 2007 book &quot;Jury Rigging in the Court of Public Opinion&quot;, the author John D. Murphy criticized Farrell&#x27;s approach, noting that by accepting the confessions as the baseline truth and hewing to the &quot;conventional&quot; history that led to mob justice, Farrell had invented conversations and created motivations that were impossible to corroborate and glossed over inconsistencies. Murphy pointed out the later phone calls placed to make ransom demands came from payphones physically close together, culminating in the arrest of Thurmond at a payphone only from the San Jose Police station. Murphy went on to write and produce a movie, &quot;Valley of the Heart&#x27;s Delight&quot;, regarding the 1933 case.

==In popular media==
At least four films have been made loosely based on this story:
* &quot;Fury&quot; (1936)
* &quot;The Sound of Fury&quot; (1950) aka &quot;Try and Get Me!&quot;
* &quot;Night Without Justice&quot; (2004)
* &quot;Valley of the Heart&#x27;s Delight&quot; (2006)

The 1933 lynching also inspired a short story by John Steinbeck, &quot;The Lonesome Vigilante&quot; (1936). It was subsequently published as &quot;The Vigilante&quot;, collected in &quot;The Long Valley&quot; (1938).

Former San Jose mayor Tom McEnery wrote a play based on Farrell&#x27;s 1992 book. The play, produced in early 2016 by the San Jose-based Tabard Theatre Company, shares the book&#x27;s name, &quot;Swift Justice&quot;.

<doc id="1331963" wikidata="Q548289" url="?curid=1331963" title="Taku Forts">
<text>The Taku Forts or Dagu Forts, also called the Peiho Forts are forts located by the Hai River (Peiho River) estuary in the Binhai New Area, Tianjin, in northeastern China. They are located southeast of the Tianjin urban center.

==History==
The first fort was built during the reign of the Ming Jiajing Emperor between 1522 and 1527. Its purpose was to protect Tianjin from attack by wokou sea raiders.

Later, in 1816, the Qing government built the first two forts on both sides of the Haihe estuary in response to increased concerns about seaborne threats from the West. By 1841, in response to the First Opium War, the defensive system in Dagukou was reinforced into a system of five big forts, 13 earthen batteries, and 13 earthworks. In 1851, Imperial Commissioner Sengge Rinchen carried out a comprehensive renovation of the forts, building 6 large forts: two on the south of the estuary, called &quot;Wēi&quot; (威-Might) and &quot;Zhèn&quot;(震-Thunder, Tremor, Quake), three to the north, &quot;Hǎi&quot;(海-sea), &quot;Mén&quot;(门-gate) &quot;Gāo&quot; (高-high), and the sixth, the &quot;Shitoufeng&quot; (石头缝-Stone Seam) Fort, was built on a small ridge on the northern shore. Each fort had three large guns and 20 small caliber guns. Forts were constructed of wood and brick with an external curtain of two feet of concrete, the layering designed to avoid spalling and minimize penetration by artillery rounds. The forts were around high, which located as they were in an exceedingly flat landscape, provided a critical vantage point.

===Second Opium War===

In 1856, Chinese soldiers boarded &quot;The Arrow&quot;, a Chinese-owned ship registered in Hong Kong flying the British flag and suspected of piracy, smuggling and of being engaged in the opium trade. They captured 12 men and imprisoned them. Though the certificate allowing the ship to fly a British flag had expired, there was still an armed response. The British and French sent gunboats under the command of Admiral Sir Michael Seymour to capture the Taku Forts in May 1858. In June 1858, at the end of the first part of the Second Opium War, the Treaties of Tianjin were signed, which opened Tianjin to foreign trade.

In 1859, after China refused to allow the setting up of foreign legations in Beijing, a naval force under the command of British Admiral Sir James Hope attacked the forts guarding the mouth of the Hai River. During the action, US Navy Commodore Josiah Tattnall III, who later served in the Confederate Navy during the American Civil War, came to the assistance of the British gunboat , offering to take off their wounded. &quot;Plover&quot;″s commander, Rear Admiral James Hope, accepted the offer and a launch was sent to take off the wounded. Later, Tattnall discovered that some of his men were black from powder flashes. When asked, the men replied that the British had been short handed with the bow gun. His famous report sent to Washington claimed &quot;Blood is thicker than water&quot;. This was the first time the British troops needed American assistance after suffering major casualties from the Taku cannon barrage, and the first time that British and independent American troops fought side by side.

In 1860, an Anglo-French force gathered at Hong Kong and then carried out a landing at Pei Tang on August 1, and a successful assault on the Taku Forts on August 21 after which Hospital Apprentice Andrew Fitzgibbon of the Indian Medical Establishment became the youngest recipient of the Victoria Cross at the age of 15 years and 3 months. The forts were severely mauled and General Sengge Rinchen&#x27;s troops were forced to withdraw. On September 26, the force arrived at Beijing and had captured the city by October 13.

===Boxer Rebellion===

After the Battle of Taku Forts (1900), most of the forts were dismantled when the Eight-Nation Alliance Forces invaded China during the Boxer Rebellion (1899–1901). Two forts remain today, one on the southern bank (the former &quot;Wei&quot; fort) and the other on the northern bank of the Hai River (the former &quot;Hai&quot; fort). Dagu Fort (on the southern bank) was repaired in 1988 and opened to the public in June 1997. Land reclamation has left it some considerable distance from the modern shoreline. Its restoration has not returned it to anything like the appearance it would have had when it was an active gun battery (see photo of the aftermath of the 1860 attack), but a number of cannons have been placed in the reconstructed gun embrasures to hint at its former use. An exhibition in Chinese recounts the history of the Opium Wars and the forts&#x27; role in them. Unrestored forts are visible to its north from Haifang Road.

<doc id="1331964" wikidata="Q246703" url="?curid=1331964" title="Ciabatta">
<text>Ciabatta (, ; ) is an Italian white bread created in 1982 by a baker in Adria, Veneto, in response to the popularity of French baguettes. Ciabatta is somewhat elongated, broad, and flat, and is baked in many variations, although unique for its alveolar holes. Ciabatta is made with a strong flour and uses a very high hydration dough.

==Etymology==
The name was given to the bread because of its flat, oval shape. in Italian means &#x27;carpet slipper&#x27;.

==Italy==
Ciabatta bread was first produced in 1982, by Arnaldo Cavallari, who called the bread after Polesine, the area he lived in. The recipe was subsequently licensed by Cavallari&#x27;s company, Molini Adriesi, to bakers in 11 countries by 1999. Cavallari and other bakers in Italy were concerned by the popularity of sandwiches made from baguettes imported from France, which were endangering their businesses, and so set about trying to create an Italian alternative with which to make sandwiches. The recipe for ciabatta came about after several weeks of trying variations of traditional bread recipes and consists of a soft, wet dough made with high gluten flour.

Many regions have their own variations on the original recipe or a bread that closely resembles ciabatta and has become accepted as a variety of ciabatta; the ciabatta from the area encompassing Lake Como has a crisp crust, a somewhat soft, porous texture, and is light to the touch. The ciabatta found in Tuscany, Umbria, and Marche regions varies from bread that has a firm crust and dense crumb to bread that has a crisper crust and more open texture. In Rome, it is often seasoned with marjoram.

New variations of the recipe continue to be developed. Whole-wheat ciabatta is known as , and when milk is added to the dough, it becomes .

==Other countries==
Ciabatta bread was introduced to the United Kingdom in 1985 by Marks &amp; Spencer, then to the United States in 1987 by Orlando Bakery, a Cleveland firm.

<doc id="1331969" wikidata="Q2445841" url="?curid=1331969" title="Culture of Kievan Rus'">
<text>The culture of Kievan Rus&#x27; spans the cultural developments in Kievan Rus&#x27; from the 9th to 13th century of the Middle Ages. The Kievan monarchy came under the sphere of influence of the Byzantine Empire, one of the most advanced cultures of the time, and adopted Christianity during the Christianization of Kievan Rus&#x27;. After the gradual fragmentation of the dynasty into many Rus&#x27; principalities in the 13th century, Kievan Rus&#x27; culture faded with the Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus&#x27; in the 13th century, and Batu Khan&#x27;s establishment of the Golden Horde as the regional hegemon of Eastern Europe.

== Architecture ==
Architecture of Kievan Rus&#x27; was exemplified by Byzantine masters building their first cathedrals in the realm, and decorating their interiors with mosaics and murals. Samples of pictorial art, such as icons and miniatures of illuminated manuscripts, came to Kiev and other cities from Constantinople. The most important cathedral of Kievan Rus’ became Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev, named after the principal cathedral of the Byzantine capital, the Hagia Sophia.

== Religion ==

The study of the pagan culture of the Early East Slavs is based on excavations. One of the finds was the Zbruch Idol, a stone figure of a deity with four faces. &quot;Dobrynya i zmiy&quot; (Dobrynya and the Dragon) was one of the monuments of the epic literature of Rus’.

This new cultural era dates back to the Christianization of Kievan Rus&#x27; in 989, when the principalities of Kievan Rus’ came under the sphere of influence of the Byzantine Empire, one of the most advanced cultures of the time. Vladimir the Great&#x27;s political choice determined the subsequent development of the Rus&#x27; culture.

The metropolitan Hilarion of Kiev wrote his work &quot;Sermon on Law and Grace&quot; (&quot;Slovo o zakone i blagodati&quot;) in the mid-11th century, confirming the basics of Kievan Rus&#x27; new Christian world outlook. Nevertheless, the text mentions the non-Christian, pagan, shamanistic Turkic title of &quot;kagan&quot; () throughout the text, a total of five times, and applies it to both Volodimir I (Vladimir/Volodymyr &quot;the Great&quot;), ), and his son Georgij, baptismal name of Yaroslav the Wise (). Scholar Charles J. Halperin (1987) agreed with Peter B. Golden (1982) that this reflected Khazar influence on Kievan Rus&#x27;, and argued that the use of a &quot;steppe title&quot; in Kiev &#x27;may be the only case of the title&#x27;s use by a non-nomadic people&#x27;. Halperin also found it &quot;highly anomalous&quot; that a Christian prelate like Hilarion would &#x27;laud his ruler with a shamanist title&#x27;, adding in 2022: &quot;The Christian ethos of the sermon is marred by Ilarion&#x27;s attribution to Vladimir of the Khazar title &quot;kagan&quot;, which was definitely not Christian.&quot;

The metropolitan of Kiev was subordinated to the Patriarch of Constantinople. The Rus&#x27; principalities adopted the Byzantine culture during a time when the apogee of the Eastern Roman Empire had already been overcome, but its decline was still far ahead. Byzantium remained the only direct successor of the Hellenistic world, which had applied the artistic achievements of antiquity to the spiritual experience of Christianity. Byzantine culture differed from the rest of the world by its refined taste and sophistication. Byzantine art differed in the depth of religious substance and virtuosity of formal methods. The principal achievement of Byzantine theology was the ecclesiastic writings of the holy fathers. The high cultural level of Greek teachers posed difficult tasks for Kievan Rus’.

Nevertheless, art of the Rus’ principalities of the tenth century differed from Byzantine prototypes of the same period. The peculiarities of the first Rus&#x27; works of art, created by the &quot;visiting&quot; Greeks, included a magnitude and representativeness which demonstrated the ambitions of the young Rus&#x27; state and its princely authority. Byzantine influence, however, couldn&#x27;t spread quickly over the enormous territory of Rus’ lands, and their Christianization would take several centuries. For example, there were numerous pagan uprisings in the principalities of Suzdal and Rostov until the twelfth century, led by the &quot;volkhvy&quot; (волхвы, or pagan priests).

There are different concepts on the correlation of Christianity and pagan beliefs among the East Slavs. Among them is the concept of a &quot;double faith&quot;, the coexistence and mutual penetration of two religions—the &quot;popular&quot; and the &quot;official&quot;. Popular culture has long been defined by pagan beliefs, especially in the remote regions of Kievan Rus’. Subsequently, it was defined by a simplified interpretation of Christianity and by superstitions, similar to what had happened in Western European culture. However, Russian historians’ idea of the popular culture after Christianization is primarily based on indirect data and suppositions. At the same time, the culture of the ecclesiastical and secular elite is known for its monuments, which do not allow historians to make confident conclusions on pagan penetration of religious beliefs of Medieval Rus’. Historians prefer to speak of a parallel development of popular and &quot;elitist&quot; cultures. They certainly give credit to the earlier traditions of the Early East Slavs and Finnic peoples without, however, overestimating their significance in forming elements of the culture.

== Ornament ==
== Literature ==

Though the Rus&#x27; had significant contact with the Byzantine Empire and chose to have various parts of the Bible translated from the Greek into Church Slavonic, they did not seem to be interested in other cultural resources that contact with Constantinople would have provided them. That is, although the Rus would have had access to the vast libraries of Greek philosophy, mathematics, and science housed there; there is no evidence that they translated any of these into Slavonic. Since access to these same documents is what is most often cited as giving rise to the Renaissance in Western Europe, this indifference on the part of the Rus&#x27; seems to fly in the face of the argument that it was the Mongol invasions which caused Russia to &quot;miss&quot; the Renaissance. D. S. Likhachev notes that &quot;the &#x27;intelligentsia&#x27; of Kievan possessed very great mobility, and constantly traveled from principality to principality. Bands of builders, fresco-painters, and churchmen were continually moving from one principality to another, even in the years immediately following the Tatar-Mongol invasion&quot;.

With the adoption of Christianity, the principalities of the Rus’ became part of a book culture. Although written language had been in use in the Rus&#x27; lands for quite some time, it was only after the baptism of the Rus’ that written language spread throughout the principalities. The development of the local literary language was associated with Christianity, and strongly influenced by Old Church Slavonic. An abundance of translated literature laid the foundation for the development of Russia&#x27;s own writing traditions. At its early stages, the most typical genres were sermons, lives of the saints (for example, &quot;Life of Boris and Gleb&quot;), descriptions of military campaigns (the famous &quot;Tale of Igor&#x27;s Campaign&quot;), and compositions of chronicles (&quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;).

<text>Illinois Route 59 is a north–south state highway in northeastern Illinois. It runs south from Illinois Route 173 in Antioch to I-55 in Shorewood, spanning the north–south width of Chicago&#x27;s western suburbs. This is a distance of .

== Route description ==
IL 59 is a major four-lane arterial for most of its length, running parallel to and about east of the Fox River in Illinois, and west of Chicago&#x27;s State Street. It is especially congested in the suburbs of Aurora and Naperville, where traffic counts average 40,000-55,000 vehicles per day. To accommodate the congestion, the 7.5-mile stretch between Ferry Road and 95th Street has been widened to six lanes. Most portions along IL 59 are zoned for commercial uses, however there are extensive stretches of residential areas along the road in West Chicago, Barrington, and Fox Lake Hills. IL 59 is the only numbered highway with a Metra station named after it: the Route 59 station on the BNSF Line, which differentiates the station from the Naperville and Aurora stations.

IL 59 is called Lake Street in Antioch, Fox Lake Road in Fox Lake Hills, Grand Avenue in portions of Ingleside and eastern Fox Lake, Sutton Road from South Barrington to Bartlett, Neltnor Boulevard in West Chicago, Hough Street in Barrington, and Brook Forest Avenue and Cottage Street in Shorewood.

IL 59 overlaps U.S. Route 12 (Rand Road) between Wauconda and Fox Lake.

In almost every town or village spanning IL 59, retail development and residential sprawl can be found. The IL 59 corridor includes regional shopping areas in the Naperville/Aurora area, the Hoffman Estates/South Barrington/Streamwood area, the Plainfield area, and the Joliet/Shorewood area. The IL 59 corridor also includes large community retail areas in Volo/Fox Lake, Wauconda, Bartlett, West Chicago, and Warrenville. IL 59 also travels through the Barrington Historic District and is proximate to significant office complexes and job centers at its junctions with Interstate 90 and Interstate 88; these intersecting corridors of commerce are known as the Golden Corridor and the Illinois Technology and Research Corridor respectively. The regional shopping malls Westfield Fox Valley in Aurora and The Arboretum of South Barrington can also be found along the IL 59 corridor.

== History ==
SBI Route 59 ran from Joliet to Antioch on the current IL 59. IL 59 was replaced by &quot;U.S. Route 66&quot; as U.S. 66 made its way onto a new highway in 1940; by 1957, IL 59 had been returned to its original state.

The Illinois Department of Transportation opened a diverging diamond interchange at IL 59 and Interstate 88 in September 2015.

<text>Smokey and the Bandit II is a 1980 American action comedy film directed by Hal Needham, and starring Burt Reynolds, Jackie Gleason, Jerry Reed, Dom DeLuise, Sally Field, Mike Henry, Paul Williams and Pat McCormick. The film is the second installment of the &quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot; trilogy in the &quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot; franchise and a sequel to &quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot; (1977).

The film was originally released in the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia and several other, mainly Commonwealth, countries as Smokey and the Bandit Ride Again.

The plot centers on Bo &quot;Bandit&quot; Darville (Burt Reynolds) and Cledus &quot;Snowman&quot; Snow (Jerry Reed), transporting an elephant to the GOP National Convention, with Sheriff Buford T. Justice (Jackie Gleason) once again in hot pursuit.

&quot;Smokey and the Bandit II&quot; was a box office success, grossing $66.1 million against a $17 million budget, becoming the eighth-highest-grossing domestic film of 1980 in the United States.

== Plot ==
Big Enos Burdette is in a mudslinging campaign against John Conn for Governor of Texas. After failing to get the outgoing governor&#x27;s endorsement, Big Enos overhears him on the phone ordering a crate in Miami to be delivered in nine days to the Republican National Convention in Dallas. Burdette schemes to earn the governor&#x27;s endorsement and have the crate delivered to the convention in his name and tracks down Cledus &quot;Snowman&quot; Snow and offers him and Bo &quot;Bandit&quot; Darville $200,000 to do the run. Cledus takes the Burdettes to Bandit to make the offer in person, but Bandit has become a heavy drinker since breaking up with Carrie (&quot;Frog&quot;) and is drunk when the Burdettes arrive and double the payoff to $400,000. Cledus accepts on Bandit&#x27;s behalf, but adds that Big Enos should give them half in advance, to which they agree. Cledus is ecstatic, but Bandit begins to miss Carrie.

Cledus calls Carrie, who is back in Texarkana and again about to marry Junior when Cledus calls offering her $50,000 to help out. She agrees and again becomes a runaway bride. Though she still has feelings for Bandit, when Carrie arrives, she initially intones she is only in it for the money, and she and Cledus work on getting Bandit off the booze and back into shape. She then trades in Junior&#x27;s car for a new Trans Am (Son of Trigger). The group arrive at the pier in Miami only to find out that the manifest is quarantined for three weeks. They return later that night to steal it, only to find that the &quot;package&quot; is a live elephant (the G.O.P. mascot) which Cledus names &quot;Charlotte&quot; after his aunt. When Bandit removes a splinter from Charlotte&#x27;s foot, she takes a liking to him.

Soon after the trio start off for Dallas, they are accosted for the first of several times by Sheriff Justice, but Bandit outwits him and they escape. En route, they stop at a remote fuel station and notice something wrong with Charlotte. Moments later, an ambulance pulls in with an Italian gynecologist in the back. &quot;Doc&quot; is initially reluctant to help, but when his driver speeds off and unknowingly leaves him stranded, he asks to hitch a ride with them, agreeing to watch Charlotte.

Doc later finds that Charlotte is pregnant and due to give birth any time, but Bandit is determined to stay on schedule. Cledus and Carrie, on the other hand, would much rather help Charlotte prepare for her eventual birthing, but Bandit did not care, he stubbornly wanted to get Charlotte to Dallas on time with no exceptions. Entering Louisiana, Doc says that Charlotte is almost in labor and needs to be off her feet, but Bandit wants to get Charlotte to Dallas and get the job done with. Doc refuses and Cledus tries to explain that Charlotte cannot bounce around the truck while she&#x27;s going to have a baby, but Bandit scolds him and reminds him that this is the last chance to get $400,000. Cledus decides that they all need a break and they go to a nearby nightclub where Don Williams is headlining. When Carrie sees Bandit scribbling on a napkin a picture of Charlotte cradled by suspended netting to keep her off her feet, she angrily leaves, but not before telling Bandit that she will come back only when he likes himself again. Carrie knew that Bandit was just being selfish towards her, Charlotte, Doc and Cledus, and had no interest in others, except receiving the $400,000 and taking Charlotte to Dallas. Later that night, a drunken Bandit makes his drawing a reality, and Doc agrees that his idea will work.

Buford intends to call for help from his brothers Reggie, a Mountie Sergeant in Quebec, and Gaylord, an effeminate Texas State Patrolman. Later, as Bandit and Cledus enter Texas, Buford lures Bandit into a trap, a mass of forty Texas Patrol and Mountie cruisers pursuing him across the desert basin. Bandit orders Cledus to get to Dallas, but he enlists a large convoy of his trucker pals and comes to Bandit&#x27;s rescue instead, wrecking nearly all of the cruisers in a giant demolition derby while Doc and Charlotte watch from the sidelines. The two escape by crossing a makeshift trailer bridge with Buford and his brothers in pursuit. Two of the trucks pull away, resulting in Gaylord and Reggie&#x27;s cruisers crashing in the ensuing gap before they can cross, but Buford is still in pursuit, though his cruiser is barely functioning.

Cledus begs Bandit to stop at a safari reserve, Bandit agrees to it, where Charlotte finally gives birth to her baby. Bandit is ready to load them both back up in the truck and get them both to Dallas to the Governor of Texas, but Cledus and Doc refuse to, causing Cledus to knock him down when he insults him and because he was irritated with Bandit&#x27;s selfishness towards him, Doc and Charlotte and her new born baby. Bandit was frustrated because he thinks that Carrie, Cledus and Doc were treating Charlotte like she is a human, but when he sees her in tears, Bandit finally comes to his senses and apologizes, realizing that taking care of Charlotte and caring for others is more important than getting $400,000.

Bandit later finds Carrie and starts acting more positive to her and tells her that he likes himself now, and that he does not want to be without her. He then tells her that he has not yet taken Charlotte to Dallas, and blew the money, but they can still make it. Carrie has forgiven Bandit and kisses him, and is overjoyed when she sees Charlotte&#x27;s baby. Bandit asks Charlotte&#x27;s permission for him and Carrie to get hitched, to which Charlotte trumpets her approval. Carrie is happy that Bandit is back to his old self again and was acting positive and selfless now. Doc, now riding in the cab with Cledus and Fred, also voices his approval, and they forgive Bandit as well and they all drive away with Charlotte and her baby in tow in circus carts on their way to Dallas, with Buford still in pursuit, now driving a Greyhound bus determined to catch him.

== Cast ==
== Production ==
&quot;Smokey and the Bandit II&quot; was filmed simultaneously with &quot;The Cannonball Run&quot;, in which Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise also starred. Football players Joe Klecko and Terry Bradshaw also appear in both films.

It is the first film to feature director Hal Needham&#x27;s &quot;Blooper Reel Credit Crawl&quot; at the end, in that a collection of bloopers and outtakes from the film showed on one side of the screen while the closing credits slowly scrolled up the other side. &quot;The Cannonball Run&quot;, also directed by Needham, used this same technique.

Buford&#x27;s brothers were both portrayed by Gleason; &quot;Reggie&quot; was a Canadian version of &quot;Reginald Van Gleason III&quot;, a popular character from Gleason&#x27;s television show.

The film was written and produced before it was announced that the 1980 Republican National Convention would be held in Detroit rather than Dallas.

Many of the movie&#x27;s scenes take place in northern Palm Beach County, especially at Burt Reynolds&#x27;s ranch in Jupiter, Florida.

Although the Bandit again sticks to a Pontiac Trans Am, this time a 1980 Turbo model with five color decals unlike 1981&#x27;s single color decals, the Snowman switches to a 1980 GMC General, silver with blue trim with the same mural on the trailer as in the original film. This &quot;new rig&quot; suggests that the pair were successful in the &quot;double or nothing&quot; wager offered by the Burdettes at the end of the first film, where they were persuaded to drive from Atlanta to Boston and back in 18 hours to buy clam chowder and bring it to the Burdettes.

A world-record automobile jump was captured on film during the &quot;roundup sequence&quot;, when stuntman Gary Davis jumped a 1974 Dodge Monaco over 150 feet. Davis suffered compressed vertebrae as a result of a hard landing.

The roundup sequence in the desert shows many new Pontiac LeMans sedans decorated as police cars being destroyed. The cars were originally ordered by a car rental agency which refused to accept the delivery as they were not equipped with air conditioning. Pontiac took the cars back and eventually gave them to the producers to be used in the film.

==Soundtrack==

Smokey and the Bandit 2: Original Soundtrack was released on vinyl, cassette tape and 8-track tape by MCA Records in 1980.

===Track listing===
== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
&quot;Smokey and the Bandit II&quot; grossed $10,883,835 in its opening weekend, the second highest ever at the time, behind &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot;. It also set a record for an opening week, with a gross of $18,108,031. It was the eighth-most-popular 1980 film at the United States and Canada box office earning $66,132,626. This box office income inspired a third film.

=== Critical response ===
The film received almost completely negative reviews from critics who felt that it suffered badly in comparison to the original. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has an approval rating of 29% based on reviews from seven critics. Roger Ebert gave it a one out of four stars and stated that there was &quot;[in 1980] no need for this movie. That&#x27;s true of most sequels, but it&#x27;s especially true of &quot;Smokey and the Bandit II&quot;, which is basically just the original movie done again, not as well ... how can I say it&#x27;s lazy when it has 50 trucks doing stunts in it? Because it takes a lot less thought to fill up a movie with stunts than to create a comedy that&#x27;s genuinely funny&quot;.

Burt Reynolds later said that he did not enjoy working on the film at all, feeling that it was an unnecessary sequel put together by Universal purely for money-making reasons rather than to try making a good picture.

==Sequel==
The film was followed by another sequel three years later, &quot;Smokey and the Bandit Part 3&quot; (1983), in which Reynolds only made a brief cameo appearance, and Sally Field did not appear.

In 2004, he began his managerial career with Lillestrøm in Norway, and later led Viking and Molde FK in Tippeligaen. He also managed Brentford, Wigan Athletic, Leeds United and Fleetwood Town in the English Football League, as well as Malmö FF in Allsvenskan, Fortuna Düsseldorf in the Bundesliga, and most recently AGF in the Danish Superliga.

==Club career==
===Germany===
Born in Altenburg, Rösler started his career in the former GDR, joining Lokomotive Leipzig in 1987, where he spent one season, before moving on to BSG Chemie Leipzig in 1988. Following this he transferred to 1. FC Magdeburg in 1989, where he spent a year before signing for Dynamo Dresden in the winter 1990–91. After two years with Dresden, he also spent two years with 1. FC Nürnberg, where he failed to score once in 28 games, resulting in him being loaned back to Dresden for the second year. Having grown up in the East, where players were nominally regarded as amateurs, Rösler found it difficult to adapt when he moved to the West after reunification: &quot;I suddenly saw more individualistic thinking, cliques, a powerful press and personal politics around team selection. The Wall was still there in some people&#x27;s heads and in many ways I was naive.&quot;
===Manchester City===
In March 1994, Rösler joined Manchester City on trial. Given an opportunity in a reserve match against Burnley, he scored two goals, which resulted in a three-month loan. He made his first team debut the following Saturday, against Queens Park Rangers. A return of five goals in twelve games saw the move made permanent in the close season, reports of the transfer fee varying between £375,000 and £500,000.

After an ignominious start to the 1994–95 campaign, when he was sent off in a 3–0 opening day defeat at Arsenal, Rösler formed a productive partnership with Paul Walsh, and scored 22 league and cup goals despite missing several games through injury. In an FA cup match against Notts County he scored four goals, becoming the first Manchester City player to score four in an FA Cup tie since Johnny Hart in 1953. His performances that season meant he was the club&#x27;s leading goalscorer, and he won the club&#x27;s Player of the Year award.

At the start of the 1995–96 season, Alan Ball became manager and immediately changed the nature of the side. Despite City&#x27;s obvious strengths down the flanks, the team was adapted to play through the middle of the park. With no supply line from the wings (City&#x27;s other winger Nicky Summerbee often playing at right-back), and with the loss through injury of Beagrie and the shocking sale of Walsh, Rösler struggled in this season. Many felt that he and fellow striker Niall Quinn were too similar to play in a system that didn&#x27;t feed strikers effectively and Rösler clearly became unhappy. Much publicised disagreements with the manager culminated in Rösler being dropped from the side, only to be brought on as a sub in the Manchester derby and immediately score a phenomenal goal. Rösler&#x27;s goal celebrations saw him running to the bench, shouting at Ball and pointing to his name and squad number on the back of his shirt. City were relegated to Division One at the end of the campaign, but Rösler opted to stay with the Blues. Despite another difficult campaign, Rösler again finished top scorer and clearly benefited from the return to a 4–4–1–1 formation. After another spell out with injury, Rösler would eventually leave the Blues in May 1998 on a free transfer following relegation to Division Two.

In his four years at City he played 176 games, scoring 64 goals. He was admitted to City&#x27;s &quot;Hall of Fame&quot; in December 2009.

===Return to Germany===
In the summer of 1998, Rösler returned to Germany joining Kaiserslautern, then reigning German champions, for one season. His most remarkable game there was on 9 December 1998 when he came on as a substitute against HJK and scored a second half hat-trick as Kaiserslautern won 5–2, helping them to win their group in the 1998–99 UEFA Champions League, before going out in the quarter-finals to Bayern Munich. He then moved on to Tennis Borussia Berlin for the 1999–2000 season.

===Southampton===
When Tennis Borussia went bankrupt in the summer of 2000, Glenn Hoddle snapped Rösler up on a free transfer, but he was unable to become a regular in Saints&#x27; first team as James Beattie started to find his form (scoring 10 goals in 10 games in November and December). Rösler also suffered a groin injury which required surgery, keeping him out for several weeks. Although he was a whole-hearted and committed player, he only managed to score once for the Saints, in a League Cup game at Mansfield Town.

Rösler scored the last goal at The Dell on 26 May 2001 in a friendly against Brighton &amp; Hove Albion – who were selected as Southampton&#x27;s opponents as they had been the stadium&#x27;s first visitors when it opened in 1898 – as Saints won 1–0. However, the distinction of the last competitive goal at The Dell went to Rösler&#x27;s teammate Matt Le Tissier, who had scored a late winner in the 3–2 Premier League win over Arsenal seven days earlier.

In the following season, he only made a handful of appearances before being loaned out to West Bromwich Albion on 30 October 2001, as cover for the injured Scott Dobie. He made his debut away at Crystal Palace on 31 October 2001, and his only goal for Albion came in a 1–0 home win over Nottingham Forest four days later. Rösler played just five games for West Bromwich Albion, as he joined German side SpVgg Unterhaching on a free transfer in January 2002, who went on to win promotion as Division One runners-up at the end of the 2001–02 season.

===Lillestrøm===
In July 2002, Rösler signed for Norwegian club Lillestrøm. He played 11 matches and scored 10 goals for the Canaries in the latter part of the 2002 season.

After the first match of the season in 2003, in which he scored the match winner in a 1–0 defeat of Bodø/Glimt, Rösler was diagnosed with cancer, when x-rays discovered a tumour in his chest, and had to put an end to his playing career. After chemotherapy, he made a full recovery. While in remission, Rösler obtained his coaching badges, enabling him to continue working in football.

==International career==
Rösler made his debut for East Germany on 26 January 1990 in a 2–1 win over Kuwait. He appeared in the team&#x27;s final match against Belgium on 12 September 1990, 21 days before the German reunification. Overall, Rösler was capped five times, scoring no goals. He also represented East Germany U21s at international level.

==Management career==
===Lillestrøm===

After making a full recovery from lung cancer, he returned to Lillestrøm, and took the manager&#x27;s seat in 2005. He led the team to two successive fourth-place finishes in the league, and also took them to the final of the Norwegian Cup in 2005 and the Royal League final in 2006, subsequently losing both. These results failed to satisfy the Lillestrøm board, and on 13 November 2006 he was sacked from his position along with assistant coach Gunnar Halle.

===Viking===
Rösler was appointed manager of Viking, another Norwegian team, on 22 November 2006, replacing Tom Nordlie, who took over Rösler&#x27;s old job at Lillestrøm. In the 2007 season he led Viking to a third place in the Tippeligaen. On 18 November 2009 it was announced that Rösler was leaving Viking.

===Molde===
On 31 August 2010, he was hired by Molde on a short-term contract. During Molde&#x27;s last eight games of the season, he doubled the team&#x27;s total number of points, avoided a single defeat, and saved them from relegation. He was replaced by Ole Gunnar Solskjær in November 2010 ready for the start of the 2011 season.

===Brentford===
In November 2010, Rösler expressed his desire to return to the Premier League as a manager. In June 2011, he was appointed manager of League One side Brentford on an initial two-year contract.

Rösler&#x27;s first game in charge was a practice match against Strømmen, which ended 0–0, while his first game open to fans was a 10–0 victory over Tonbridge Angels and his first competitive match in charge ended in a 2–0 win over Yeovil Town. Rösler had a successful first season managing at Brentford, finishing in ninth place with a total of 67 points, Brentford&#x27;s highest league finish in six years.

In Rösler&#x27;s second season in charge of Brentford they came within minutes of securing promotion from League One to the Championship. For their final game of the season, on 27 April 2013, they faced second placed Doncaster Rovers at Griffin Park, with Brentford in third place only a win would see his side promoted. In the dramatic final minute of added time and with the game poised at 0–0, Brentford won a penalty. On-loan striker Marcello Trotta insisted on taking the penalty rather than captain, Kevin O&#x27;Connor, hitting the crossbar. Doncaster counter-attacked from the rebound and James Coppinger scored the goal which guaranteed Doncaster&#x27;s promotion as well as the league title. Brentford entered the play-offs, where they were drawn in the semi-final against Swindon Town.

Despite beating Swindon in an almost equally dramatic manner, eventually succeeding via a penalty shoot-out after a 4–4 aggregate scoreline. However promotion was never to come for Rösler&#x27;s Brentford as they were beaten 2–1 in the play-off final by Yeovil Town at Wembley Stadium, after a poor first-half performance.

Following the drama and disappointment of the 2012–13 season, Rösler embarked upon a heavy overhaul of his squad in order to finally gain promotion to the Championship. In the summer transfer window, 13 players were either signed or loaned from other clubs whilst only three of last-season&#x27;s first-team squad were sold. Rösler left the position of Brentford manager on 7 December 2013, having led a revival in the team&#x27;s fortunes, winning seven of his final eight games. Under the stewardship of former sporting director Mark Warburton, the Bees achieved automatic promotion to the Championship on 18 April 2014. Long-serving player Kevin O&#x27;Connor paid tribute to Rösler at the end of the season, saying &quot;Uwe got the ball rolling. We were a bang average League One side, but Uwe changed the mentality. Everything he did was all Premier League standard. He did amazing, so we’ll be saying thank you to him&quot;.

===Wigan Athletic===
On 7 December 2013, Rösler was appointed as the new manager of Championship side Wigan Athletic, taking over the position from Owen Coyle. His first game in charge came on 12 December 2013, a 2–1 loss against NK Maribor in the UEFA Europa League.

In March 2014, Rösler returned to Manchester City and led holders Wigan to a shock 2–1 victory over his old club at the Etihad Stadium in the quarter-final of the FA Cup. However, his team lost in the semi-finals to Arsenal at Wembley Stadium, 4–2 on penalties after a 1–1 draw. After finishing fifth in the Championship, Wigan qualified for the play-offs, but lost in the semi-final to eventual winners Queens Park Rangers after goals from Charlie Austin.

With Wigan being amongst the early favourites for promotion during the 2014–15 season, on 13 November 2014, Rösler was sacked by Wigan Athletic after the club fell into the relegation zone. The then Wigan chairman Dave Whelan proclaimed that despite sacking Rösler &quot;I still rate him as a very, very good manager and I think he&#x27;ll get another job very quickly and I wish him good luck&quot; and Whelan revealed that it was a &quot;harsh decision&quot; to sack him after guiding Wigan to the Championship play-off semi-finals and FA Cup semi-finals months earlier. He was replaced as Wigan Athletic manager by Malky Mackay and then Gary Caldwell as the season ended with relegation.

===Leeds United===
On 20 May 2015, he was appointed as the head coach of Championship side Leeds United on a two-year deal. He had rejected a job offer from 1860 Munich in February 2015 in hopes of landing another job in England. As part of his backroom staff, he was joined at Leeds by assistant head coach Rob Kelly, goalkeeper coach Richard Hartis and first team coach Julian Darby. On 8 August, on the opening day of the Football League Championship season, Rösler&#x27;s first game in charge ended in a 1–1 draw against Burnley after a goal from Mirco Antenucci. On 19 October, he was sacked after just two wins from 12 games in charge, following a 2–1 home defeat to Brighton &amp; Hove Albion which left Leeds in 18th place in the Championship. On the same day, he was replaced as Leeds&#x27; head coach by former Rotherham manager Steve Evans.

===Fleetwood Town===
On 30 July 2016, four days before the start of the League One season, Rösler was appointed manager of League One side Fleetwood Town.

In Rösler&#x27;s inaugural season at Fleetwood Town, he guided them to their highest ever points tally and finish in the club&#x27;s history, finishing fourth with 82 points and reaching the League One play-offs where they were narrowly defeated by Bradford City (1–0 over two legs). From November 2016 to March 2017 the club went 18 games unbeaten, climbing from 13th to 2nd.

He was sacked on 17 February 2018 after seven straight defeats in all competitions.

===Malmö FF===
On 12 June 2018, Rösler was announced as the new head coach of Swedish title holders Malmö FF on a 2.5-year deal.

On 1 January 2020, Rösler resigned from Malmö after a two–year spell. After taking over midway through the 2018 campaign, he led the team from 11th to 3rd place. In his first full season, Malmö FF finished second in Allsvenskan (2019), losing the title by one point to Djurgården. Additionally, in his two seasons, he led the team into back-to-back Europa League knock-out stages, a first in the club&#x27;s history.

===Fortuna Düsseldorf===
On 29 January 2020, Rösler was appointed as the new head coach of German Bundesliga side Fortuna Düsseldorf. This was the first German club of his managerial career. The team ended the season with relegation after a 3–0 defeat at 1. FC Union Berlin on the final day. His contract was not extended after the 2020–21 season.

===AGF===
On 14 June 2022, Rösler was appointed as the new head coach for the Danish Superliga team AGF on a three-year contract.

==Managerial style==
Rösler is renowned for his teams playing a high, pressing style of football, and is also a fan of squad rotation among players, with 4–3–3 or 3–5–2 his favoured formations. Rösler compared his style and brand of football similar to the philosophies of German compatriot Jürgen Klopp, with Rösler describing the style of football as &#x27;heavy metal&#x27; attacking football, with powerful quick football with quick transitions from attack to defence.

==Personal life==
Born and brought up in East Germany as the communist regime was collapsing, during his time at Lokomotive Leipzig, Rösler was interviewed by the Stasi secret police organisation, who attempted to force him to inform on colleagues seeking to defect to the West in exchange for the Stasi allowing him to continue his fledgling football career unimpeded – only the furious intervention of his manager saved him from their attentions.

Having been a fan of English football from his childhood, Rösler said that he found his &quot;home&quot; in England during his time with Manchester City, and described the formation of his bond with the City fans as the &quot;biggest achievement in my career&quot;. Diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma in 2003, he credited his recovery to the support of the fans of the club, and said that hearing them sing his name at a game while he lay in hospital made his bond with the club &quot;unbreakable&quot;. Rösler has stated on several occasions that his ambition for his managerial career is to eventually become manager of the Manchester club.

Rösler has a Norwegian wife, with whom he has had two sons. His younger son is named Colin after Colin Bell, and is a professional footballer for Malmö FF, while his eldest son is named Tony after Tony Book – both Bell and Book are former Manchester City players and are considered club legends.

In 2013, Rösler&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Knocking Down Walls&quot; was released.

<text>Source Code Control System (SCCS) is a version control system designed to track changes in source code and other text files during the development of a piece of software. This allows the user to retrieve any of the previous versions of the original source code and the changes which are stored. It was originally developed at Bell Labs beginning in late 1972 by Marc Rochkind for an IBM System/370 computer running OS/360.

A characteristic feature of SCCS is the &quot;sccsid&quot; string that is embedded into source code, and automatically updated by SCCS for each revision. This example illustrates its use in the C programming language:

 static char sccsid[] = &quot;@(#)ls.c 8.1 (Berkeley) 6/11/93&quot;;

This string contains the file name, date, and can also contain a comment. After compilation, the string can be found in binary and object files by looking for the pattern codice_1 and can be used to determine which source code files were used during compilation. The codice_2 command is available to automate this search for version strings.

==History==
In 1972, Marc Rochkind developed SCCS in SNOBOL4 at Bell Labs for an IBM System/370 computer running OS/360 MVT. He rewrote SCCS in the C programming language for use under UNIX, then running on a PDP-11, in 1973.

The first publicly released version was SCCS version 4 from February 18, 1977. It was available with the Programmer&#x27;s Workbench (PWB) edition of the operating system. Release 4 of SCCS was the first version that used a text-based history file format, earlier versions did use binary history file formats. Release 4 was no longer written or maintained by Marc Rochkind. Subsequently, SCCS was included in AT&amp;T&#x27;s commercial System III and System V distributions. It was not licensed with 32V, the ancestor to BSD. The SCCS command set is now part of the Single UNIX Specification.

SCCS was the dominant version control system for Unix until later version control systems, notably the RCS and later CVS, gained more widespread adoption. Today, these early version control systems are generally considered obsolete, particularly in the open-source community, which has largely embraced distributed version control systems. However, the SCCS file format is still used internally by a few newer version control programs, including &quot;BitKeeper&quot; and &quot;TeamWare&quot;. The latter is a frontend to SCCS. Sablime has been developed from a modified version of SCCS but uses a history file format that is incompatible with SCCS. The SCCS file format uses a storage technique called interleaved deltas (or the weave). This storage technique is now considered by many version control system developers as foundational to advanced merging and versioning techniques, such as the &quot;Precise Codeville&quot; (&quot;pcdv&quot;) merge.

Apart from correcting Year 2000 problems in 1999, no active development has taken place on the various UNIX vendor-specific SCCS versions.
In 2006, Sun Microsystems (today part of Oracle) released their Solaris version of SCCS as open-source under the CDDL license as part of their efforts to open-source Solaris.

==Background==

The Source Code Control System (SCCS) is a system for controlling file and history changes. Software is typically upgraded to a new version by fixing bugs, optimizing algorithms and adding extra functions. Changing software causes problems that require version control to solve.
* Source code takes up too much space because it is repeated in every version.
* It is hard to acquire information about when and where changes occurred.
* Finding the exact version which the client has problems with is difficult.
SCCS was built to solve these problems. SCCS from AT&amp;T had five major versions for the IBM OS and five major versions for UNIX
Two specific implementations using SCCS are: PDP 11 under Unix and IBM 370 under the OS.

== Composition ==
SCCS consists of two parts: SCCS commands and SCCS files. All basic operations (e.g., create, delete, edit) can be realized by SCCS commands. SCCS files have a unique format prefix codice_3, which is controlled by SCCS commands.

== SCCS files ==
An SCCS file consists of three parts: 
* Delta table
* Access and tracking flags
* Body of the text

=== Delta table ===
In SCCS, a delta is a single revision in an SCCS file. Deltas are stored in a delta table, so each SCCS file has its own record of changes.

=== Control and tracking flags in SCCS files ===
Every operation of each SCCS file is tracked by flags. Their functions are as below:
* Setting permissions for editing of every SCCS file.
* Control each release of every SCCS file.
* Permitting collaborative editing of every SCCS file.
* Mutual-referencing changes of every SCCS file.

=== Body ===
SCCS uses three types of control records for keeping track of insertions and deletions applied in different deltas. They are the insertion control record, the deletion control record, and the end control record. Whenever a user changes some part of the text, a control record is inserted surrounding the change. The control records are stored in the body along with the original text records.

==SCCS basic commands==
SCCS provides a set of commands in the form of macro invocations that perform or initiate source code management functions with a simple syntax, such as create, get, edit, prt. It also provides access to the revision history of files under management. These commands are implemented as argument verbs to the driver program &quot;sccs&quot;.

=== Create ===
The sccs command &quot;create&quot; uses the text of a source file to create a new history file. For example:

$ sccs create program.c
program.c:
1.1
87 lines

The outputs are name, version and lines.

The command is a macro that expands to &quot;admin&quot; to create the new history file followed by &quot;get&quot; to retrieve the file.

=== Edit ===

$ sccs edit program.c
1.1
new delta 1.2
87 lines

Edit a specific file.

The command is a macro that expands to &quot;get -e&quot;.

=== Delget ===

$ sccs delget program.c
comments? main function enhanced
1.2
10 inserted
0 deleted
87 unchanged
1.2
97 lines

Check in new version and get the new version from sccs.

The command is a macro that expands to &quot;delta&quot; to check in the new version file followed by &quot;get&quot; to retrieve the file.

=== Get ===

$ sccs get program.c
1.1
87 lines

The outputs are version and lines you want to get from specific file.

=== Prt ===

$ sccs prt program.c

This command produces a report of source code changes.

==Implementations==

=== UNIX SCCS versions ===
Most UNIX versions include a version of SCCS, which, however, is often no longer actively developed.

=== Jörg Schilling&#x27;s fork ===
The late (who requested the release of SCCS in the early days of the OpenSolaris project) maintained a fork of SCCS that is based on the OpenSolaris source code. It has received major feature enhancements but remains compatible with the original SCCS versions unless using the &quot;new project&quot; mode.

=== Heirloom Project ===
The Heirloom Project includes a version of SCCS derived from the OpenSolaris source code and maintained between December 2006 and April 2007.

=== GNU conversion utility ===
GNU offers the SCCS compatible program GNU CSSC (&quot;Compatibly Stupid Source Control&quot;), which is occasionally used to convert SCCS archives to newer systems like CVS or Subversion; it is not a complete SCCS implementation and not recommended for use in new projects, but mostly meant for converting to a modern version control system.

=== Other version control systems ===
Since the 1990s, many new version control systems have been developed and become popular that are designed for managing projects with a large number of files and that offer advanced functionality such as multi-user operation, access control, automatic building, network support, release management and distributed version control. Bitkeeper and TeamWare use the SCCS file format internally and can be considered successors to SCCS.

On BSD systems, the SCCSID is replaced by a RCSID starting and ending with ; the corresponding tool is . This system is originally used by RCS and added automatically on checkout. The resulting source code revision control identifiers are documented in the NetBSD and FreeBSD style guides for their own code bases. NetBSD defines the custom keyword while FreeBSD defines and a macro renamed .

The SRC version control system can also use the SCCS file format internally (or RCS&#x27;s) and aims to provide a better user interface for SCCS while still managing only single-file projects.

<doc id="1332031" wikidata="Q1930949" url="?curid=1332031" title="Spot the Pigeon">
<text>Spot the Pigeon is the first EP by English progressive rock band Genesis, released on 20 May 1977. Its three songs were originally written for the group&#x27;s eighth studio album &quot;Wind &amp; Wuthering&quot; (1976), but were not included in the final track selection. It was the final studio release to feature guitarist Steve Hackett prior to his departure from Genesis.

&quot;Spot the Pigeon&quot; was not released in the United States as the market for EPs never took off there, but a Canadian release was issued by Atlantic Records (the band&#x27;s overseas distributor) and was imported into the US and easily available at shops that sold imports. &quot;Spot the Pigeon&quot; reached No. 14 in the UK Singles Chart. It was released on CD in 1988 but has not been reissued since; &quot;Pigeons&quot; and &quot;Inside and Out&quot; were included in the &quot;Genesis Archive 2: 1976-1992&quot; (2000) and &quot;Turn It On Again: The Hits – The Tour Edition&quot; (2007) sets, and &quot;Match of the Day&quot; on &quot;Genesis 1976–1982&quot; (2007) and on the label sampler &quot;Refugees: A Charisma Records Anthology 1969-1978&quot; (2009).

==Background==
The title is a variation on the football-themed spot the ball (the cover resembles a spot the ball competition photo), replacing the word &quot;ball&quot; with &quot;pigeon&quot; so that the title links the themes of the first two songs.

Drummer-singer Phil Collins expressed his disdain for &quot;Match of the Day&quot; in 2004, saying, &quot;It was also not our finest hour looking back at it now. I wrote the embarrassing lyrics and the track featured an attempt to bring some of the hipper grooves of the day into Genesis, with very suspect results.&quot;

The lightweight &quot;Pigeons&quot; is driven by a one-note banjolele line that parodies English musician George Formby. Steve Hackett commented in 2009 that &quot;the thing about ‘Pigeons’ was that it was possible for the band to play a whole note for a whole thing: ding-ding-ding-ding. And that was unvarying whilst the keyboard changed and [Banks] tried to do as many different chords as possible.&quot;

Per bassist-rhythm guitarist Mike Rutherford, the band felt that the omission of both songs from &quot;Wind &amp; Wuthering&quot; was detrimental, which led to attempts at making songs with shorter lengths on their next album, &quot;...And Then There Were Three...&quot;.

&quot;Inside and Out&quot; combines images of folk and progressive pop for what would be the last time in the band&#x27;s career with Hackett as an active member. Since its 1977 release, Hackett remained adamant that the song exemplified the band’s multi-layered sound and should have been included on the &quot;Wind &amp; Wuthering&quot; LP released in December 1976. “I think it is one of the stronger tracks that didn’t make it onto the album,” he told &quot;Vintage Rock&quot; in 2017. “I think it should have been because it has a very beautiful sound to it. Right from the word ‘go,’ it’s got that Genesis multi-jangle thing where it sounds like one guitar, but it’s a whole bunch of guitars all playing the same thing.” In the same year, he celebrated the fortieth anniversary of &quot;Wind &amp; Wuthering&quot; by playing a selection of its songs on tour, including &quot;Inside and Out&quot; (documented on his live album &quot;Wuthering Nights: Live in Birmingham&quot;). Genesis had performed the song several times on the Wind &amp; Wuthering tour in 1977. The first section, &quot;Inside&quot;, concerns a man who is wrongfully imprisoned for rape. The second section &quot;Out&quot;, is an instrumental passage that represents the man&#x27;s freedom.

==Critical reception==
AllMusic&#x27;s retrospective review praised the songwriting on the EP for returning to the sound of early Genesis album &quot;Trespass&quot;, but concluded their review with: &quot;&quot;Spot the Pigeon&quot; has never been a popular or even very accessible release in the U.S. Of course, there&#x27;s a reason for this: It simply isn&#x27;t very exciting.&quot; 

== Reissues ==
The EP was reissued on vinyl for Record Store Day 2012 by Audio Fidelity again on blue vinyl playing at 33 1/3 rpm on Side A and 45 rpm on Side B.

<text>Khun Poom Jensen (; ; ; 16 August 1983 – 26 December 2004), born Bhumi Jensen (also spelled Poomi Jensen, ; ; ), was a grandson of King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand, after whom he was named. He was also a nephew of Vajiralongkorn, the current King of Thailand. He was the only son of the King&#x27;s eldest daughter, Princess Ubolratana Rajakanya, and her American (former) husband Peter Ladd Jensen.

== Early life and education ==
Poom, as he was commonly known, had autism and his status helped heighten awareness of the condition in Thailand. He attended Kasetsart University Laboratory School in Bangkok. An American teacher, Julie Claeys, from Greeley Colorado helped to coordinate his program and trained Thai teachers to support him. He spent his childhood in San Diego County, California, where he graduated from Torrey Pines High School. Poom moved with his mother to Thailand in July 2001, after his graduation. After return to Thailand he studied in Sports Science at Faculty of Education, Kasetsart University.

==Death and legacy==
Jensen drowned after being struck by the Indian Ocean tsunami on 26 December 2004, while he and his family were on holiday at the La Flora Resort hotel in Khao Lak. His body was discovered on the beach the following day. His uncle, then-Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn, identified his body and flew the rest of the family to Bangkok. On 30 April 2005, he received a royal funeral attended by his grandfather the King and virtually every member of the Royal Family.

His mother, Princess Ubolratana, established the Khun Poom Foundation in his memory, to aid children with autism and other learning disabilities. She also founded &quot;To Be Number One Project&quot; to campaign against drug usage among teenagers.

<text>The second USS &quot;Trippe&quot; (DD-33) was a in commission in the United States Navy from 1911 to 1919. She was named for Lieutenant John Trippe. She saw service during World War I.

After &quot;Trippe&quot;′s U.S. Navy service ended, she served in the United States Coast Guard as USCGC &quot;Trippe&quot; (CG-20) from 1924 to 1931.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Trippe&quot; was laid down on 12 April 1910 at Bath, Maine, by the Bath Iron Works. She was launched on 20 December 1910, sponsored by Mrs. John S. Hyde, and commissioned at the Boston Navy Yard in Boston, Massachusetts, on 23 March 1911, Lieutenant Frank D. Berrien in command.

==Service history==
===United States Navy===
====1911–1917====
&quot;Trippe&quot; completed sea trials in 1911, and upon commissioning joined the destroyers and submarines assigned to the Atlantic Torpedo Fleet and began routine operations along the United States East Coast. In 1911, she participated in exercises off Newport, Rhode Island; Boston; and the Virginia Capes. She made her first cruise to southern waters in 1912, departing Newport on 3 January 1912 and dropping anchor at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, on 14 January. Following three months of training at Guantanamo Bay and in the Gulf of Mexico, she returned north in April 1912 and entered Boston Harbor on 21 April. After repairs, she resumed training operations off the coast of the Northeastern United States. On 2 January 1913, she headed south once more for three months of tactical exercises and gunnery drills from Guantanamo Bay and in the Gulf of Guacanayabo. She returned to Boston on 14 April 1913 and spent the remainder of 1913 in operations off the U.S. coast between Boston and Norfolk, Virginia.

In January 1914, &quot;Trippe&quot; headed south and conducted battle practice in the Caribbean through the end of March 1914. In April 1914, the Tampico Affair brought her to Mexico when U.S. Navy sailors and United States Marines went ashore at Veracruz and seized the customs house on 21 April 1914. &quot;Trippe&quot; arrived off Tampico, Mexico, on 22 April 1914 and patrolled the area for a week to prevent Mexico from landing arms there. On 1 May 1914, she steamed south to Veracruz, where she conducted more patrols and supported the battleships and cruisers operating in the vicinity. Near the end of May, she departed Mexican waters, and on 31 May 1914 she entered Boston Harbor.

After the completion of an extensive overhaul, &quot;Trippe&quot; conducted sea trials and drills in the Boston area from mid-August to late September 1914. On 30 September 1914, she arrived at Newport for a week of operations before heading south. She shifted to Hampton Roads, Virginia, in mid-October 1914 and participated in exercises there and at Lynnhaven Bay on the coast of Virginia at the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay for a month before returning to Boston.

&quot;Trippe&quot; spent December 1914 and the first three weeks of January 1915 in the Boston area. On 26 January 1915, she arrived in Guantanamo Bay to resume her schedule of winter drills in the Caribbean. Late in March 1915, she headed northward and reached Boston on 6 April 1915. After her normal round of maneuvers off the coast of the northeastern United States, she returned to Boston on 23 October 1915.

On 13 December 1915, &quot;Trippe&quot; became a unit of the newly organized 2nd Reserve Flotilla. On 5 January 1916, she was designated a &quot;destroyer operating with reduced complement,&quot; and on 27 January 1916, she was placed in ordinary at the Boston Navy Yard.

World War I had been raging in Europe since the summer of 1914 and, with the threat of the United States entering the war increasing, &quot;Trippe&quot; was placed in full commission once again at Boston on 25 July 1916. She trained along the U.S. coast for the next eight months.

====World War I====
The United States declared war on the German Empire on 6 April 1917. &quot;Trippe&quot; continued to operate off the U.S. coast until early May 1917, when she entered port at Boston and commenced preparations for duty overseas.

On 21 May 1917, &quot;Trippe&quot; got underway from Boston for the United Kingdom. After a port call at St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland, Canada, she arrived at Queenstown on the southern coast of Ireland, the location of a major wartime American destroyer base. She paused only long enough to refuel and make voyage repairs before clearing the harbor on 5 June 1917 for her first patrol. From Queenstown, she escorted Allied convoys on the last leg of their voyage from North America to England and France. Her area of operations, situated as it was in the war zone which Germany had established around the British Isles on 5 February 1915, was the prime hunting ground of German U-boats. When not engaged in escorting convoys, she patrolled the waters around Queenstown in an effort to detect and destroy as many German submarines as possible.

&quot;Trippe&quot; had only one verified engagement with a German U-boat. On 18 September 1917, she and the destroyer were steaming in company in the Atlantic Ocean some west of Brest, France, when, shortly after 02:00, she sighted the distinctive wake of the periscope of a submarine running on a parallel course, but in the opposite direction. &quot;Trippe&quot; dropped depth charges, but without visible results, and continued on to rendezvous with an eastbound convoy. That night, she encountered a raging storm, and waves carried her starboard waist gun platform overboard. &quot;Trippe&quot; nonetheless successfully shepherded her convoy into Quiberon Bay on the coast of France, made repairs quickly, and resumed her routine.

On 24 February 1918, &quot;Trippe&quot; was proceeding in a scouting line with the destroyers and in the Atlantic Ocean off the south coast of Ireland bound for Queenstown when &quot;Paulding&quot; sighted the British Royal Navy submarine ′s periscope. Mistaking &quot;L2&quot; for a German U-boat, &quot;Paulding&quot; headed for the periscope at flank speed and opened gunfire. &quot;L2&quot; had sighted the destroyers and, assuming that the destroyers had not seen her periscope, submerged to , but upon hearing &quot;Paulding&quot; open fire, she dove to . &quot;Paulding&quot; dropped two depth charges, the first of which shook &quot;L2&quot; severely and jammed her diving planes in a hard-upward position. This caused &quot;L2&quot; to take on a tremendous inclination, and her stern struck the seabed at a depth of . Four more depth charges exploded, again shaking the submarine. &quot;L2&quot;′s commanding officer gave the order to blow the number 5 and 6 ballast tanks, and &quot;L2&quot; surfaced bow-first. &quot;Davis&quot; dropped a depth charge near her, and then all three destroyers opened gunfire on her from a range of about . One round struck &quot;L2&quot;′s pressure hull just abaft her conning tower. Some of &quot;L2&quot;&#x27;s crew emerged from her conning tower, waved their hands and a White Ensign, and fired a smoke grenade. The destroyers ceased fire immediately. &quot;L-2&quot; did not sustain serious damage, and &quot;Davis&quot; escorted her to Berehaven, Ireland. The force commander of British submarines, Captain Martin Dunbar-Nasmith, commended &quot;L2&quot; and the destroyers for the action in his report on the friendly fire incident. Admiral Lewis Bayly, the Royal Navy′s Commander-in-Chief, Coast of Ireland, in his endorsement of Nasmith′s report, wrote, &quot;Had &quot;L-2&quot; not been very skillfully and coolly handled, she would have been lost. The U. S. destroyers deserve great credit for their smartness in attack, and for their quickness in recognizing the submarine as British.&quot;

On 11 November 1918, the day of the signing of the armistice with Germany that brought World War I to an end, &quot;Trippe&quot; was in port at Queenstown.

====December 1918–July 1919====
In mid-December 1918, &quot;Trippe&quot; departed Queenstown. She refueled in the Azores and at Bermuda and returned to Boston on 3 January 1919. After six months of operations along the U.S. East Coast, she entered the Philadelphia Navy Yard on League Island in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on 23 July 1919 for pre-inactivation overhaul. On 6 November 1919, she was decommissioned and placed in reserve there.

===United States Coast Guard===
By 1924, Prohibition had spawned a thriving illegal traffic in the smuggling of alcoholic beverages into the United States. The United States Coast Guard&#x27;s small fleet, charged with stopping the illegal importation of alcoholic beverages, was unequal to the task. Consequently, President Calvin Coolidge proposed increasing the Coast Guard&#x27;s fleet by transferring 20 of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s inactive destroyers, and the United States Congress authorized the necessary funds on 2 April 1924. U.S. Coast Guardsmen and U.S. Navy shipyard workers overhauled &quot;Trippe&quot;″s hull, stripped her of depth-charge gear and torpedo tubes, and removed one of her four guns. On 7 June 1924, the U.S. Navy transferred &quot;Trippe&quot; to the United States Department of the Treasury and, after five years of inactivity, &quot;Trippe&quot; was placed in commission in the U.S. Coast Guard as USCGC &quot;Trippe&quot; (CG-20) with Lieutenant Commander John H. Cornell, USCG, in command. For the next four years, &quot;Trippe&quot; operated from New London, Connecticut, along the northeastern coast of the United States as a cutter on the Coast Guard&#x27;s &quot;Rum Patrol.&quot;

&quot;Trippe&quot; was placed in reduced commission at New London on 5 January 1929. In October 1929 she was moved to Stapleton, New York. From January to March 1930, she underwent an overhaul at the New York Navy Yard in Brooklyn, New York. After a month of gunnery exercises off St. Petersburg, Florida, she returned to Stapleton on 23 April 1930 to resume operations along the U.S. coast.

On 18 December 1930, &quot;Trippe&quot; departed Stapleton for the Philadelphia Navy Yard. The Coast Guard decommissioned &quot;Trippe&quot; at Philadelphia on 15 April 1931 and returned her to the Navy on 2 May 1931.

==Final disposition==
&quot;Trippe&quot; remained in reserve at Philadelphia until 1934. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 5 July 1934. She was sold to Michael Flynn, Inc of Brooklyn, New York, on 22 August 1934 and subsequently scrapped.

<text>The Transportation 9-11 Ribbon is a civil and military decoration of the U.S. Department of Transportation that was issued to both civilians and military personnel who, through service with the United States Department of Transportation, contributed to the recovery from the September 11 attacks in 2001 against the United States of America.

==History==
The ribbon was issued primarily to the United States Coast Guard, but was also authorized for any Department of Transportation personnel, Merchant Marines, or civilians who were assigned to the Department of Transportation for relief efforts against the terrorist attacks.

The three main criteria for the award of the 9-11 Ribbon are as follows:

*Assignment to Coast Guard units that shifted Operational Control to Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Noble Eagle, or Operation Protecting Liberty between September 11, 2001 and September 11, 2002.
*All personnel involved in patrolling harbors, critical infrastructure facilities, escorting high interest vessels, and conducting boardings of vessels entering U.S. waters during the period of September 11, 2001 to September 11, 2002. Participation in these operations must have been for no less than fourteen days.
*All personnel, to include active, reserve, auxiliary, and civilian personnel who manned or augmented for no less than fourteen days, Coast Guard, Department of Transportation, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and Department of Defense command centers between September 11, 2001 and September 11, 2002.

The 9-11 Ribbon was awarded as a one time decoration and there were no devices authorized to the decoration. The 9-11 Ribbon was discontinued in October 2002, but permitted for continued wear on Coast Guard uniforms and by civilian personnel.

For individual acts of bravery and heroism, above and beyond the criteria for the 9-11 Ribbon, the Department of Transportation also issued the 9-11 Medal.

Gregory Harrison, Doug Savant, and Diamond Dallas Page also star, with Monica Keena playing the title character. It aired on TBS Superstation on August 15, 1999.

The film was followed by two sequels, &quot;First Target&quot; (2000) and &quot;First Shot&quot; (2002).

==Plot==
A domestic terrorist group make an unsuccessful attempt on the life of US President Jonathan Hayes and the group&#x27;s leader, Michael Smith, is subsequently captured. Some members of the group manage to evade capture and continue with terrorist activities. Eight weeks later, believing the threat is past, the President organizes an outdoors activity trip for his teenage daughter, Jess, who has grown tired of the public life and constant Secret Service supervision. Jess, excited about the trip, is disappointed to learn a Secret Service agent she dislikes, Alex McGregor, will be accompanying her, despising her over a misunderstanding embrace between her father and Alex. Jess goes so far as to spread rumors about Alex during the trip, leaving an air of animosity between the two of them.

Unbeknownst to the hikers, during their trip they are seen by members of the domestic terrorist group who have been hiding out in the same woods to evade capture. The terrorists initially believe they are witnessing a normal group of hikers, but soon notice bodyguards with guns. Eventually, one of the group recognizes Jess, and identifies her as the daughter of President Hayes. They quickly form a plan to kidnap Jess in order to negotiate the release of Smith. They ambush the hikers, kill one of the bodyguards, and kidnap Jess.

With the help of one of the river guides, Grant Coleman, Alex searches for Jess and attempts a daring rescue.

<doc id="1332053" wikidata="Q7425852" url="?curid=1332053" title="Sata (food)">
<text>Sata or satar is a traditional dish from the Malaysian state of Terengganu, consisting of spiced fish meat wrapped in banana leaves and is grilled over charcoal fire. It is a type of Malaysian fish cake. The main ingredients of sata are grated coconut, sardines, ginger, onions and chili peppers. 

Sata is not to be confused with satay, another dish popular in Malaysia. A sata takes on the shape of a small pyramid, and is sold in batches, joined together in a skewer. It is then sold as an affordable street food. Beside locals, the food has been a favorite among visitors to Terengganu, with the districts of Marang and Kemaman being a popular hotspot for the snack. It is also enjoyed by other states on the East Coast, namely Pahang and Kelantan. With its rising popularity, sata is also available in the Klang Valley, albeit sometimes at higher prices. Sata recipes differ as each family has their own, passed down from one generation to the next. Sata vendors also vary, from fixed stalls to temporary stands at bazaars held during Ramadan. The sticks used to pierce sata can be either made from bamboo, metal, or nibong palm.

The snack is believed to originate from fishermen hoping to store excess catch without them going to waste; sardines used to be the main ingredient because they tend to end up as bycatch, and now different types of fish, such as the yellowstripe scad, crimson jobfish, and Spanish mackerel, are also used. Grilling over charcoal fire reduces the microbial count of the fish to safe levels, while adding ginger and chili, both known to have antibacterial effect, further reduces the amount of bacteria. Wrapping it in banana leaves also protects it from external source of contamination. Besides having antibacterial benefits, these steps also adds fragrance and flavor to the food.

<text>Alifeira () is a mountain village and a former municipality in Elis, West Greece, Greece. Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality Andritsaina-Krestena, of which it is a municipal unit. The municipal unit has an area of 96.678 km2. The seat of the municipality was in the village of Kallithea.

==Subdivisions==
The municipal unit Alifeira is subdivided into the following communities (constituent villages in brackets):
*Alifeira (Alifeira, Pefki)
*Amygdalies (Amygdalies, Kato Amygdalies, Keramidi, Krana)
*Kallithea (Kallithea, Barakitika)
*Livadaki (Livadaki, Ptelea, Raptis)
*Myronia (Myronia, Sylimna, Agios Vlasis, Klima, Rama)
*Vresto (Vresto, Longo)

==Geography==

Alifeira is situated in a mountainous and forested area, with many deep river valleys. The river Alfeios forms the northern border of the municipal unit. It is about 10 km northwest of Andritsaina, 20 km southeast of Krestena, 40 km southeast of Pyrgos and 50 km west of Tripoli. The Greek National Road 76 (Krestena - Karytaina - Megalopoli) runs through the municipal unit.

==History==

The ancient Arcadian town Aliphera was located in the Parrhasia country, 40 stadia (about 8 km) from ancient Heraea. It took part in the colonization of Megalopolis in 371 BC and was member of the Arcadian League. The name originates from &quot;Alipheros&quot;, son of Lycaon. In the city there were sanctuaries of Athena and Asclepius. In 224 BC Lydiades, tyrant of Megalopolis, gave the town to the Eleans. It was taken by Philip V of Macedon in 219 BC after a long siege, and later it joined the Achaean League and minted its own currency. Later, the city was subject to the Romans.

The first excavations were done by Anastasios Orlandos in 1932. In the ancient city the temples of Athena and Asclepius, the acropolis, the cemetery wall and some buildings have been found.

<text>The Brücke von Andau ( or &quot;Andaui híd&quot;) is a small bridge over the / Hanság-főcsatorna, a small artificial river which forms part of the border between Austria and Hungary. It is located near to the village of Andau (Burgenland, Austria).

== History ==
With political turmoil in the People&#x27;s Republic of Hungary during the summer and fall of 1956, more and more Hungarians fled to the west over the border to Austria. Even though it was just a small, wooden bridge over a small river, the bridge at Andau was the escape route for about 70,000 Hungarians during the Hungarian Revolution.

After crossing the border, fugitives had to walk a nine km (5.6 mi) long road, the &quot;Road To Freedom&quot; (&quot;Fluchtstraße&quot;), to the village of Andau, where they were received with great hospitality by the inhabitants of Andau and the surrounding villages.

On November 21, 1956, the bridge was blasted by Soviet troops.

== Today ==
In 1996, with the 40th anniversary of the Hungarian Revolution, the bridge was rebuilt as a symbol of tolerance and helpfulness. Organised as a joint operation by the Austrian and Hungarian armies, it replaced a stub bridge, which had been built by peasants for transportation reasons. At the same time, the Road Of Freedom was used as an open-air exhibition with the title &quot;Road Of Woes&quot;, showing about ninety sculptures and other art works by Hungarian and Austrian artists.

== Literature and film ==
As a symbol of freedom, the bridge not only achieved fame with the book &quot;The Bridge at Andau&quot; by James Michener (1957), but also became a world-known memorial. The Bridge of Andau is also the topic of , a 2000 Austrian movie dealing with the Hungarian Revolution in a slightly humorous manner, the third part of .

<text>The National Gallery of Ireland () houses the national collection of Irish and European art. It is located in the centre of Dublin with one entrance on Merrion Square, beside Leinster House, and another on Clare Street. It was founded in 1854 and opened its doors ten years later. The gallery has an extensive, representative collection of Irish paintings and is also notable for its Italian Baroque and Dutch masters painting. The current director is Caroline Campbell.

== History ==
In 1853 an exhibition, the Great Industrial Exhibition, was held on the lawns of Leinster House in Dublin. Among the most popular exhibits was a substantial display of works of art organised and underwritten by the railway magnate William Dargan. The enthusiasm of the visiting crowds demonstrated a public appreciation for art, and it was decided to establish a permanent public art collection as a lasting monument of gratitude to Dargan. The moving spirit behind the proposal was the barrister John Edward Pigot (1822–1871), son of David Richard Pigot, Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer, and he became one of the first governors of the gallery. The façade of the National Gallery copies the Natural History building of the National Museum of Ireland which was already planned for the facing flank of Leinster House. The building itself was designed by Francis Fowke, based on early plans by Charles Lanyon, and was completed and opened in 1864.

The gallery was not founded around an existing collection, and when the gallery opened it had just 112 paintings. In 1866 an annual purchase grant was established and by 1891 space was already limited. In 1897, the Dowager Countess of Milltown indicated her intention of donating the contents of Russborough House to the gallery. This gift included about 223 paintings, 48 pieces of sculpture, 33 engravings, much silver, furniture and a library, and prompted construction from 1899 to 1903 of what is now called the Milltown Wing, designed by Thomas Newenham Deane.

At around this time Henry Vaughan left 31 watercolours by J. M. W. Turner with the requirement that they could only be exhibited in January, this to protect them from the ill-effects of sunlight. Though modern lighting technology has made this stipulation unnecessary, the gallery continues to restrict viewing of the Vaughan bequest to January and the exhibition is treated as something of an occasion.

Another substantial bequest came with the untimely death in the sinking of the of Hugh Lane (1875–1915), since 1914 director of the gallery; not only did he leave a large collection of pictures, he also left part of his residual estate and the Lane Fund has continued to contribute to the purchase of artworks to this day. In addition to his involvement in the gallery, Hugh Lane had also hoped to found a gallery of modern art, something only realised after his death in the Hugh Lane Gallery. George Bernard Shaw also made a substantial bequest, leaving the gallery a third of royalties of his estate in gratitude for the time he spent there as a youth.

The gallery was again extended in 1962 with a new wing designed by Frank DuBerry of the Office of Public Works. This opened in 1968 and is now named the Beit Wing. In 1978 the gallery received from the government the paintings given to the nation by Chester Beatty and in 1987 the Sweeney bequest brought fourteen works of art including paintings by Picasso and Jack B. Yeats. The same year the gallery was once again given some of the contents of Russborough House when Alfred Beit donated 17 masterpieces, including paintings by Velázquez, Murillo, Steen, Vermeer and Raeburn.

In the 1990s a lost Caravaggio, &quot;The Taking of Christ&quot;, known through replicas, was discovered hanging in a Jesuit house of studies in Leeson Street in Dublin by Sergio Benedetti, senior conservator of the gallery. The Jesuits have allowed this painting to be exhibited in the gallery and the discovery was the cause of national excitement. The painting was on loan to an Italian gallery from February until July 2010 as part of Caravaggio&#x27;s 400th anniversary. In 1997 Anne Yeats donated sketchbooks by her uncle Jack Yeats and the gallery now includes a Yeats Museum. Denis Mahon, a well-known art critic, promised the gallery part of his rich collection and eight painting from his promised bequest are on permanent display, including &quot;Jacob Blessing the Sons of Joseph&quot; by Guercino.

== Millennium Wing ==

A new wing, called the Millennium Wing, was opened in 2002. Unlike the previous two extensions, this new wing has street frontage and the English architects Benson &amp; Forsyth gave it an imposing Bowers Whitbed, Portland stone façade and grand atrium. The design originally involved demolishing an adjoining Georgian terrace house and its ballroom mews; however, the Irish planning appeals authority, An Bord Pleanála, required that they be retained.

== Master development plan ==

In March 2011, the Office of Public Works (OPW), in association with the gallery, commenced work on the historic complex at Merrion Square to address a critical need for the repair and renovation of the fabric of the Dargan (1864) and Milltown (1903) wings, together with the provision of much needed additional accommodation. The first phase of the works programme involved the removal and replacement of the Dargan Wing roof. The next two phases of the project involved the replacement of the Milltown Wing roof, followed by an extensive upgrade of the fabric and services of the two buildings whilst reclaiming their original period elegance. Refurbishment of the two wings was completed in June 2017.

== Location, access and facilities ==
The National Gallery of Ireland is located in the heart of Georgian Dublin. There are two entrances, one at Merrion Square and the other at Clare Street. Admission to the gallery is free and many talks, tours and events, as well as the audioguide, are also free of charge. The gallery launched a free smartphone app in 2013.

Dublin Bus routes 4, 7 and 7a all pass by the gallery. The Pearse Street DART station is 5 minutes on foot as is the Dawson stop on the green line of the Luas. The Abbey Street stop of the red line of the Luas is a 20-minute walk away. There are two dublinbikes stations just outside the gallery, one at Clare Street and the other at Merrion Square West.

All galleries and entrances are wheelchair and buggy accessible and there are disabled parking spaces outside the Merrion Square entrance. Tours for the visually and hearing impaired are regularly organised. Visitors with guide dogs are welcome in the gallery. The lecture theatre, AV room and gallery shop are all fitted with a loop system for the hearing impaired.

== Highlights ==
The collection has about 14,000 artworks, including about 2,500 oil paintings, 5,000 drawings, 5,000 prints, and some sculpture, furniture and other works of art.

== Library and archives collections ==
The library and archives collections at the National Gallery of Ireland encompass unique and historically significant collections for the study of art history. The origins of the collections can be traced back to the foundation of the institution over one hundred and sixty years ago. Covering the visual arts from the classical to the contemporary these collections continue to be a vital research element of the National Collection. The development of the library and archive has been supported principally through public funding and the private donations of generous benefactors.

Open to the public, it has particularly rich holdings relating to the history of western European art from the Middle Ages on, and the collections relating to Irish and Italian art are extensive. The collection amounts to over 100,000 published volumes, in addition to significant archival holdings.

<text>Anne Françoise Elisabeth Lange (17 September 177225 May 1816, Florence) was a French actress of the Comédie-Française and a &quot;Merveilleuse&quot; of the French Directory. Her stage name was Mademoiselle Lange.

==Life==
She was born in Genoa, the daughter of Charles-Antoine Lange (or L&#x27;Ange) and Marie-Rose Pitrot, itinerant musicians and actors putting on shows right across Europe. She thus made her stage debut very young in child roles in her parents&#x27; companies. In 1776, the family was taken on at the theatre at Liège, and in 1784, they found themselves taken on at the theatre in Ghent. In 1787, Mlle Lange was taken on at the theatre at Tours in Marguerite Brunet&#x27;s company.

On 2 October 1788, she made her official debut at the Comédie-Française in the role of Lindane in &quot;L&#x27;Écossaise&quot; by Voltaire. She next played Lucinde in &quot;L&#x27;Oracle&quot; by Saint-Foix.

In 1791, the production of the anti-religious and anti-monarchical play &quot;Charles IX&quot; by Marie-Joseph Chénier divided the company of the Théâtre-Français, with Mlle Lange joining the &quot;patriots&quot; group under Talma, which set itself up at rue de Richelieu (the present home of the Comédie-Française).

However, thinking her talents were not being fully recognized there, she quickly moved to the &quot;aristocrats&quot; faction that had set itself up at the Théâtre du Faubourg Saint-Germain (renamed the Théâtre de la Nation, now known as the Théâtre de l&#x27;Odéon).

On 24 February 1793, she played Laure in &quot;Le Vieux Célibataire&quot; by Jean-François Collin d&#x27;Harleville, becoming a sociétaire later that year. She had a triumph in the eponymous role in &quot;Paméla ou la Vertu récompensée&quot; (&quot;Pamela or Virtue Rewarded&quot;) by Nicolas-Louis François de Neufchâteau, setting a fashion for straw hats known as &quot;à la Paméla&quot;, but the play&#x27;s royalist overtones led to this theatre being shut down and the author and actors arrested by the Committee of Public Safety.
Mlle Lange was at first imprisoned in the prison de Sainte-Pélagie until, after a few months in captivity, she managed to arrange her transfer to the pension Belhomme (along with her cook, her valet and her lady&#x27;s maid). There she was able to maintain a large household thanks to funds from the banker Montz, filling the street outside with those coming to visit her. She also bought a hôtel particulier on rue Saint-Georges.

In the wake of a denunciation, Fouquier-Tinville opened an enquiry which led to the arrest of Jacques Belhomme and the closure of the pension Belhomme. Mlle Lange returned to prison, but her friends in high places helped her to evade the guillotine. She was freed after 9th Thermidor and rejoined her fellow actors at the Théâtre Feydeau.

She continued to live the high life under the Directory, having a liaison with the rascally &quot;arriviste&quot; N. Lieuthraud, the self-proclaimed &quot;marquis de Beauregard&quot;, who had made a fortune as supplier to the armies of the republic, but eventually disappeared, pursued by creditors. He housed her at the Hôtel de Salm, one of the houses he had acquired, and maintained her there on an allowance said to be 10,000 livres a day.

She was also the mistress of a rich banker from Hamburg, Hoppé, bearing him a daughter, Anne-Élisabeth Palmyre, who was recognized by her father in 1795. It is improbable, however, that she had an affair with Paul Barras as is claimed in the libretto of the famous operetta by Charles Lecocq, &quot;La Fille de madame Angot&quot;, in which Mlle Lange appears in a secondary role.
Her final lover was Michel-Jean Simons, a Belgian supplier to the French army, with whom she had a son in December 1797. In 1798, Simons&#x27; father married her friend Julie Candeille. Simons recognized their son and married Mlle Lange, making her Madame Simons and putting an end to her theatrical career; she reappeared only for a few performances in 1807. Ruined, Simons died in 1810 in his château de Bossey in Switzerland.
Widowed, she assumed a solitary life in obscurity and far from her admirers until her death.

== Portraits ==
Mlle. Lange sat for a number of artists, including two French artists of the Paris Salon. &quot;Sylvie&quot; by Jean-François Gilles Colson was featured at the Salon of 1793. A contemporary of the artist, Girodet-Trioson created &quot;Le Sommeil d&#x27;Endymion&quot; for the same event.

A few years later, Girodet would depict &quot;Mademoiselle Lange as Venus&quot; at the Salon of 1799. The sitter expressed her disapproval of the work in a written letter. The artist would then replace the &quot;Venus&quot; with &quot;Portrait of Mlle. Lange as Danae&quot; in what became a major scandal in art.

Robert Lefèvre did a portrait of her as &quot;Mme Simons, née Lange&quot;, as well as a portrait of her husband, Michel-Jean Simons.

<doc id="1332074" wikidata="Q4272827" url="?curid=1332074" title="USS Walke (DD-34)">
<text>The first USS &quot;Walke&quot; (DD-34) was a in the United States Navy during World War I. She was named for Rear Admiral Henry A. Walke.

&quot;Walke&quot; was laid down on 5 March 1910 at Quincy, Massachusetts, by the Fore River Shipbuilding Company; launched on 3 November 1910; sponsored by Miss Mildred Walke Walter, granddaughter of Rear Admiral Walke; and commissioned on 22 July 1911 at the Boston Navy Yard.

==Pre-World War I==
Upon commissioning, &quot;Walke&quot; was assigned to the 9th Division, Atlantic Torpedo Fleet. After fitting out at Boston, Massachusetts, she moved to the Torpedo Station at Newport, Rhode Island, where she loaded torpedoes for training with the Atlantic Torpedo Fleet. During the fall and winter, the destroyer conducted battle practice and torpedo-firing exercises with the destroyers and submarines of the torpedo fleet. In addition, she operated with the larger units of the Atlantic Fleet itself during training in more comprehensive combat drills. Those exercises covered the entire Atlantic coast from Cape Cod in the north to Cuba in the south.

Such operations occupied the destroyer until 1 November 1913, when she was placed in reserve at the New York Navy Yard. Though in reserve for the next 17 months, &quot;Walke&quot; never went out of commission; during her semi-retirement, the ship retained a commanding officer and at least a partial crew. Though not active with the Fleet, she did get underway periodically to keep her machinery in good working order while always remaining close to New York. During October and November 1914 &quot;Walke&quot; was employed in experimental deep sea diving trials which culminated in Navy diver Stephen J. Drelishak&#x27;s dive to a then-record depth of in Long Island Sound.

In July 1915, the destroyer returned to fully active service, first to participate in the Independence Day celebration at Perth Amboy, New Jersey, and then to visit Washington, D.C., for the Grand Army of the Republic celebration in late September. By 5 October, she found herself off Newport, with the Fleet conducting maneuvers. On 1 November, &quot;Walke&quot; entered the Charleston Navy Yard for a major overhaul. Those repairs were completed at the end of February 1916; and, in March, the ship moved south to Key West to prepare for gunnery practice.

However, in May, revolutionary disorders broke out in the Dominican Republic; and &quot;Walke&quot; was dispatched to support the troops and marines landed there to restore order. From 6 May-19 June, she cruised along the coast of Hispaniola, leaving the area periodically for fuel or provisions at Ponce, Puerto Rico, or at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. After a brief visit to Haiti, the republic occupying the western end of Hispaniola, &quot;Walke&quot; returned to Key West on 19 June. On 21 July, she arrived at the Norfolk Navy Yard to begin an eight-month overhaul.

==World War I==
The warship completed her overhaul in March 1917 and got underway on the 25th, bound for New York. She arrived at Staten Island the following day. By coincidence, &quot;Walke&quot; entered the New York Navy Yard on 6 April 1917; the day the United States declared war on Germany. Two weeks and four days later, she emerged from the yard ready to go into action. After patrols off New York, the destroyer voyaged to Charleston, South Carolina, where she arrived on 3 May. Following a 16-day visit to Charleston, she headed north and arrived back in New York on the 20th. Three days later, she put to sea bound for European waters. Because of her limited fuel capacity, the destroyer made the first three days of the voyage under tow by the collier, . Steaming under her own power after 26 May, she arrived in Gironde, France on 5 June. Following brief service there and at Brest, &quot;Walke&quot; moved to Queenstown on the southeastern coast of Ireland. From that port, she patrolled the western approaches to England and France, hunting for U-boats and escorting convoys into British and French ports until mid-November.

On 17 November, the warship headed back to the United States. Again after making the first leg of the transatlantic voyage under tow because of her limited range, &quot;Walke&quot; arrived in New York on 30 November. From there, she headed south to Charleston, where she entered the yard in mid-December 1917. She completed repairs in March 1918 and returned to New York on the 16th. For the remainder of World War I, &quot;Walke&quot; patrolled the coastal waters of the United States from New York north to Cape Cod and escorted incoming and departing convoys into and out of New York harbor.

==Inter-war period==
Following the end of the war, &quot;Walke&quot; settled down to a routine of east coast operations and Atlantic Fleet exercises. Early in December 1918, she visited Baltimore, Maryland, and returned to New York on the 20th. In mid-January 1919, she moved south via Charleston to join in winter maneuvers held in the Cuba-Haiti area. Returning north by way of Key West and Miami, Florida, the destroyer reentered New York on 14 April. Between mid-April and mid-July, the warship cruised almost the entire Atlantic coast of the United States—from New York to Key West — conducting torpedo practice and various other exercises.

On 18 July, &quot;Walke&quot; arrived in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to begin preparations for inactivation. The ship was decommissioned on 12 December.

&quot;Walke&quot; remained at the Philadelphia Navy Yard until the mid-1930s. She received the alphanumeric hull designation DD-34 on 17 July 1920 but lost her name 13 years later on 1 July 1933 when it was reassigned to DD-416. Known simply as &quot;DD-34&quot;, she was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 20 March 1935 and was scrapped at the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 23 April 1935 under the terms of the London Naval Treaty.

<doc id="1332077" wikidata="Q5564619" url="?curid=1332077" title="Girls Can Tell">
<text>Girls Can Tell is the third studio album by American indie rock band Spoon. Intended as a stylistic departure from the band&#x27;s previous work, &quot;Girls Can Tell&quot; features classic rock and new wave influences absent on their major label albums.

The album was released on Merge Records on February 20, 2001. Spoon frontman Britt Daniel described the album as &quot;a turning point stylistically, and it was a turning point in terms of us being able to put out a record and not feeling like as soon as it came out the wheels fell off the cart.&quot;

&quot;Girls Can Tell&quot;, up to December 2009, has sold slightly fewer than 100,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan.

==Background==
After the band was dropped from their major record deal with Elektra in August 1998, Spoon finished the first version of &quot;Girls Can Tell&quot; in May 1999 with ten songs. Spoon frontman Britt Daniel moved to New York for a change of pace from Austin and to work temp jobs while drummer Jim Eno, stayed in Austin, designing semiconductor chips. Despite Daniel thinking the album was the band&#x27;s best, the band&#x27;s lawyer and manager reported no interest in the record week after week, a personal low point for Daniel. He later described the record as the band&#x27;s hardest to record, given the emotional toll of his indigence, lack of external interest in the record, and the length of time it took to create. Daniel thought this emotional vulnerability came across in the record. The only interest came from Mike McCarthy, who would come to produce the record&#x27;s second incarnation, and Matador Records&#x27;s Gerard Cosloy. The second version reworked &quot;Anything You Want&quot; and &quot;Take a Walk&quot;, removed the band&#x27;s spurned songs about their Elektra A&amp;R rep, and added &quot;Everything Hits at Once&quot;, &quot;Believing Is Art&quot;, and &quot;10:20 AM&quot;.

After writing more songs, Daniel and producer Mike McCarthy returned to Austin and began working on a new album in Eno&#x27;s garage studio. The band eventually signed with Merge to release the new album, entitled &quot;Girls Can Tell&quot;.

According to Daniel, &quot;Girls Can Tell&quot; was intended to be a departure from the band&#x27;s established style: &quot;The big idea behind &quot;Girls Can Tell&quot; was to take stock of the band&#x27;s MO from inception until that point, to carefully consider all the things we&#x27;d been trying to do and the way we&#x27;d been doing them, and then set out to specifically avoid all of that.&quot; He cited the Kinks, the Supremes, and Elvis Costello as inspirations for the album; specifically, Costello&#x27;s &quot;Get Happy!!&quot; album, which he had borrowed from his then-girlfriend Eleanor Friedberger.

Daniel saw the album as a last-ditch attempt to find success. He explained:
The track &quot;Me and the Bean&quot; is a cover of a mid-1990s Austin, Texas band called The Sidehackers. The songwriter of The Sidehackers, John Clayton, played bass on Spoon&#x27;s subsequent album, &quot;Kill the Moonlight&quot;.

==Reception==

&quot;Girls Can Tell&quot; saw significant critical acclaim and was heralded for its change in style from the band&#x27;s previous work. &quot;Pitchfork&#x27;s&quot; Nick Mirov said of the album &quot;It&#x27;s a great thing, hearing a band grow up without losing sight of what made them so vital in the first place; and seeing as how &quot;Girls Can Tell&quot; might not have ever seen the light of day, it makes it even better. It&#x27;s worth cherishing.&quot;

&quot;The A.V. Club&quot; commented, &quot;Few outside the band would deny the irony of releasing such a strong album after such an unceremonious major-label dumping.&quot; &quot;Stereogum&quot;″s Tom Breihan, on the album&#x27;s twentieth anniversary, noted, &quot;The album hasn&#x27;t lost any of that simple but hard-to-describe coolness.&quot;

&quot;Pitchfork&quot; placed &quot;Girls Can Tell&quot; at number 96 on its list of top 200 albums of the 2000s (decade).

<text>The Medical Library Association (MLA) is a nonprofit educational organization with more than 3,400 health-sciences information professional members.

== History ==

Founded on May 2, 1898, the Association of Medical Librarians, as it was known until 1907, was founded &quot;to encourage the improvement and increase of public medical libraries.&quot; Its charter members included four librarians: Marcia C. Noyes, Margaret R. Charlton, Elizabeth Thies-Meyer, and Charles Perry Fisher, and four physicians: George M. Gould, John L. Rothrock, E. H. Brigham, and William Browning. MLA is the second oldest special library association in the United States.

The MLA Exchange was one of the founders&#x27; earliest and most important projects, helping build medical libraries in the United States and many other countries by exchanging duplicate publications. The organization has subsequently developed a variety of programs to serve the needs of health information specialists.

The National Library of Medicine holds a collection of the organization&#x27;s archival material that ranges from 1898 to 2002.

== Membership ==
MLA&#x27;s members comprise more than 400 institutions and 3,000 individuals in the health-sciences information field worldwide, though—as many other countries now have their own national health library organizations—it now primarily represents health sciences libraries and librarians in the United States.

Membership is structured to accommodate varying needs and professional status of a diverse field of practitioners. Categories include Regular Membership, Institutional Membership, International Membership, Affiliate Membership, and Student Membership.

=== Academy of Health Information Professionals ===
The Academy of Health Information Professionals (AHIP) is MLA&#x27;s peer-reviewed professional development and career recognition program.

Members of the academy are credentialed as health information professionals by demonstrating their academic preparation, professional experience and professional accomplishments. Credentialing differs from certification in that certification focuses on the attainment of minimum standards and measurable competencies, whereas credentialing recognizes the time and effort that is required for professional development. It also differs from licensure because licensure is a legal requirement for professionals in certain professions, such as medicine.

==== History of the Academy ====
MLA established its credentialing program in 1949 and the Academy of Health Information Professionals was established January 1, 1978. The program has been revised subsequently. The most recent action by MLA occurred in April 1995, when the MLA Board of Directors appointed members to the Task Force to Review the Academy of Health Information Professionals. In May 1996, the task force completed its report and recommendations to the MLA Board of Directors, who reviewed the academy in its current form and made recommendations for future goals.

==== AHIP membership Levels ====
There are five levels of membership in AHIP – Provisional, Member, Senior Member, Distinguished Member, and Emeritus Member. Each level is based on earning points for professional activities and a series of professional competencies, which can be found online.

== Governance and structure ==
MLA is governed by a board of directors. The president, president-elect, immediate past president, seven directors elected by the membership at large, and chairs of the Chapter and Caucus councils serve as voting members of the board of directors. The president serves as chair of the board of directors and does not vote except to make or to break a tie. The executive director serves as a nonvoting member of the board of directors.

=== Chapters ===
Fourteen geographic groups within the United States are currently affiliated with MLA. These chapters provide a vital link to the programs and services of the association; they are open to both MLA members and non-members.

=== Caucuses ===
Over 40 MLA caucuses represent the varied subfields and areas of specialization of the association&#x27;s membership. Caucuses share information during the year through email list communication, informal networking, and newsletters. Caucuses sponsor contributed and invited paper sessions at the Annual Meeting. Examples of MLA caucuses include: Cancer Libraries, Consumer and Public Health Information, Hospital Libraries, Medical Informatics, Nursing and Allied Health Resources, Public Health/Health Administration, Research, and Veterinary Medical Libraries.

=== Committees, juries, panels and task forces ===
MLA depends on members with a wide range of skills and expertise to serve on its committees. Committees have varied roles in the association. The word committee includes committees required by the bylaws, committees of the Board of Directors, standing committees, subcommittees, ad hoc committees, juries, panels, and task forces. A description of these various committees is provided below:
* Standing committees are continuing committees with ongoing responsibility for furthering the Medical Library Association&#x27;s interests, programs, and projects.
* The Executive and Nominating Committees are mandated by the bylaws.
* Juries are constituted for the purpose of recommending recipients of awards, prizes, grants, and scholarships.
* Panels are appointed to serve as peer-review and evaluation boards for MLA&#x27;s publication and credentialing programs.
* Ad hoc committees are appointed for a special purpose and are discharged when their tasks are completed.
* From time to time, special task forces are appointed for a specific study.

== Activities ==

=== Advocacy ===
Advocacy efforts for librarians and the library profession take many forms within MLA: Resources are provided to help hospital librarians communicate with other leaders in their institutions about the true value of librarians and library services, including &quot;Advocacy Toolbox: A Practical Guide to Communicating Your Value&quot;. The MLA Governmental Relations Committee is charged with developing consistency in the Association&#x27;s position on information policy issues, and on governmental actions affecting medical libraries. Legislative updates on topics such as funding for library programs and services; health care reform, and copyright issues are provided. The MLA Vital Pathways Task Force reviews existing data and trends in the status of hospital librarians, collects data on the links between libraries and quality and financial outcomes, and develops action plans to influence hospital decision-makers and key leaders in the health care field.

=== Career development ===
MLA offers career services for health sciences information professionals, students attending library school programs, and those interested in learning more about a career as a medical librarian. MLA offers programs to improve the knowledge and skills of its members and provide continuing education and credentialing to its members.

=== Cunningham fellowship ===
The Cunningham Fellowship is an award for health sciences librarians from countries outside the United States and Canada. The award provides for attendance at the MLA annual meeting and observation and supervised work in one or more medical libraries in the United States or Canada.

=== Publications and website ===
* &quot;Journal of the Medical Library Association&quot; MLA&#x27;s quarterly, peer-reviewed scholarly journal. Vols. 90–; 2002– Akers, Katherine G., Jill Barr-Walker, and Kathleen Amos. 2020.
* Bulletin of the Medical Library Association Vols. 1–89; 1911–2001
* &quot;Biomedical Digital Libraries&quot; (2003–2007)
* &quot;MLA-FOCUS&quot; A bimonthly electronic newsletter for MLA members.
* &quot;MLA News&quot; A monthly newsletter for members and subscribers that includes news about the profession; articles that impart practical, on-the-job wisdom; and information about MLA products and services.
* &quot;Books&quot; Books written by medical librarians on subjects of interest to medical librarians and other health information professionals.
* &quot;BibKits&quot; Selective, annotated bibliographies of discrete subject areas in the health sciences literature.
* &quot;DocKits&quot; Collections of representative, unedited library documents from a variety of institutions that illustrate the range of approaches to library management.
* The association&#x27;s website includes information for patients as well as librarians. The Washington Post recommended this site to patients, stating that it can help patients understand medical terminology and find the best sources of information on the Internet, but that the association&#x27;s website is difficult to navigate.

=== Conferences and meetings ===
Attendees at MLA&#x27;s annual meeting present and discuss scholarly papers, applied research, and issues in health sciences information management. Professionals with specific interests in related fields such as medical informatics come together to address topics of timely importance. Educational sessions are complemented by an exhibit featuring more than 100 vendors of appropriate products and services. The first MLA annual meeting was in 1898, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The most recent meeting was held in Detroit, Michigan May 16–19, 2023. Since 2020, MLA annual meetings have offered virtual or hybrid participation options for members unable to attend in person.

Future Meetings
* 2024 Portland, OR May 18–21

<text>Mark Valentino Ingram Sr. (born August 23, 1965) is an American former professional football player who was a wide receiver in the National Football League (NFL) for the New York Giants (1987–1992), the Miami Dolphins (1993 to 1994), the Green Bay Packers (1995), and the Philadelphia Eagles (1996). He played college football for the Michigan State Spartans. He is the father of Mark Ingram II, who won the Heisman Trophy in 2009 and is the New Orleans Saints&#x27; second all-time leader in rushing yards.

==Early life==
Ingram played high school football at Flint Northwestern High School in Flint, Michigan. In high school, Ingram played at the quarterback position with Andre Rison at halfback. He then played college football at Michigan State University in East Lansing, Michigan. At Michigan State, Ingram was moved to the position of wide receiver, where he remained throughout his collegiate and professional career.

==Professional career==
Ingram was drafted by the Giants in the first round (28th overall) in the 1987 NFL draft. He is probably best known for a third down play in Super Bowl XXV in which he eluded at least five Buffalo Bills defenders to achieve a critical first down for the Giants to sustain a long touchdown drive. He finished the game as the Giants top receiver with five catches for 77 yards. As a Miami Dolphin, in a game against the New York Jets, Ingram caught four touchdown passes from Dan Marino. The most notable was the game-winning touchdown, which was the result of Marino faking out the Jets defense by indicating he was going to spike the ball to stop the clock. Instead, he lobbed a short pass to Ingram, who was open in the end zone.

Ingram retired after the 1996 season.

==Legal problems==
On September 16, 2008, Ingram was sentenced to seven years in prison and up to five years of probation for money laundering and fraud. He was also ordered in a Long Island federal court to pay $252,000 in restitution. Ingram failed to show up to a federal prison in Ashland, Kentucky to turn himself in on December 5, 2008, and an arrest warrant was issued. On January 2, 2009, Ingram was arrested in a Flint, Michigan hotel room, where he was preparing to watch his son play in the 2009 Sugar Bowl. Alabama lost the game to the Utah Utes by a score of 31–17. On March 22, 2010, in a courtroom in Central Islip, New York, Ingram was sentenced to an additional two years in prison for jumping bail. He was housed at Yazoo City Federal Correctional Complex (FCC) as inmate 22749-050, and was then in the custody of the Residential Reentry Management Detroit. Ingram was released from prison in early 2015.

==Personal life==
Ingram&#x27;s son, Mark Ingram II, played for the Alabama Crimson Tide and won the Heisman Trophy in 2009 and was drafted in the first round of the 2011 NFL draft by the New Orleans Saints, where he is their second all-time leader in rushing yardage.

<doc id="1332105" wikidata="Q167541" url="?curid=1332105" title="Eredivisie">
<text>The Eredivisie (; &quot;Honour Division&quot; or &quot;Premier Division&quot;) is the highest level of professional football in the Netherlands. The league was founded in 1956, two years after the start of professional football in the Netherlands. As of the 2024–25 season, it is ranked the sixth-best league in Europe by UEFA.

The Eredivisie consists of 18 clubs. Each club meets every other club twice during the season, once at home and once away. At the end of each season, the two clubs at the bottom are relegated to the second level of the Dutch league system, the (First Division), while the champion and runner-up of the are automatically promoted to the Eredivisie. The club finishing third from the bottom of the Eredivisie goes to separate promotion/relegation play-offs with six high-placed clubs from the .

The winner of the Eredivisie claims the Dutch national championship. Ajax have won the most titles with 36. PSV Eindhoven are next with 25, and Feyenoord follow with 16. Since 1965, these three clubs have won all but three Eredivisie titles (the 1981 and 2009 titles went to AZ and Twente won in 2010). Ajax, PSV, and Feyenoord are known as the &quot;Big Three&quot; or &quot;Traditional Top Three&quot; of Dutch football. They are the only clubs in their current form to have never been relegated out of the Eredivisie. A fourth club, Utrecht, is the product of a 1970 merger between three of that city&#x27;s clubs, one of which, VV DOS, had also never been relegated out of the Eredivisie.

From 1990 to 1999, the official name of the league was PTT Telecompetitie (after the sponsor, PTT Telecom), which was changed to KPN Telecompetitie (because PTT Telecom changed its name to KPN Telecom) in 1999 and to KPN Eredivisie in 2000. From 2002 to 2005, the league was called the Holland Casino Eredivisie. Since the 2005–06 season, the league has been sponsored by the &quot;Vriendenloterij&quot; (lottery), but for legal reasons its name could not be attached to the league (the Dutch government was against the name, because the Eredivisie would, after Holland Casino&#x27;s sponsorship, yet again be sponsored by a company providing games of chance).

In August 2012, it was made public that tycoon Rupert Murdoch had secured the rights to the Eredivisie for 12 years at the expense of one billion euros, beginning in the 2013–14 season. Within this deal, the five largest Eredivisie clubs were to receive five million euros per year. In 2020, the Eredivisie was abandoned due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==History==

From the foundation of the Dutch national football championship in 1898 until 1954, the title was decided through play-offs by a handful of clubs who had previously won their regional league. The competition was purely an amateur one; the Royal Dutch Football Association (KNVB) rejected any form of payment and suspended players who were caught receiving salary or transfer fees. The call for professional football grew in the early fifties after many national team members left to play abroad in search for financial benefits. The KNVB would usually suspend these players, preventing them from appearing for the Dutch national team. After the North Sea flood of 1953, the Dutch players abroad (mainly playing in the French league) organised a charity match against the France national team in Paris. The match was boycotted by the KNVB, but after the assembled Dutch players defeated the French (2–1), the Dutch public witnessed the heights that could be achieved through professional football. To serve the growing interest, a dissident professional football association (the NBVB) and league were founded for the 1954–55 season. On 3 July 1954, the KNVB met with a group of concerned amateur club chairmen, who feared the best players would join the professional teams. The meeting, dubbed the &quot;slaapkamerconferentie&quot; (&#x27;bedroom conference&#x27;), led to the Association reluctantly accepting semi-professionalism.

Meanwhile, both the KNVB and the NBVB started their separate competition. The first professional football match was contested between Alkmaar and Venlo. The leagues went on for eleven rounds, before a merger was negotiated between the two federations in November. Both leagues were cancelled and a new, combined competition emerged immediately. De Graafschap, Amsterdam, Alkmaar and Fortuna &#x27;54 from the NBVB were accepted to the new league. Other clubs merged, which led to new names like Rapid J.C., Holland Sport and Roda Sport. The first (semi-)professional league was won by Willem II. For the 1956–57 season, the KNVB abandoned the regional league system. The Eredivisie was founded, in which the eighteen best clubs nationwide directly played for the league title without play-offs. The inaugural members of the Eredivisie in 1956 were Ajax, BVC, BVV, DOS, EVV, Elinkwijk, SC Enschede, Feijenoord, Fortuna &#x27;54, GVAV, MVV, NAC, NOAD, PSV, Rapid J.C., Sparta, VVV &#x27;03 and Willem II. Ajax was the first team to claim the title that season. Below is a complete record of how many teams played in each season throughout the league&#x27;s history;
* 18 clubs: 1956–1962
* 16 clubs: 1962–1966
* 18 clubs: 1966–present

==Attendance==

Since the beginning of the league, there have been three clubs with an attendance much higher than the others: Ajax, PSV and Feyenoord. Clubs like Heerenveen, Utrecht and Groningen also have fairly large fanbases. The regular season average league attendance was just over 7,000 in 1990, but this figure has risen sharply over the years thanks to the opening of new stadiums and the expansion of existing ones nationwide. Average attendance for the 2018–19 season was 18,010, with Ajax having the largest (52,987) and Excelsior having the smallest (4,223). Ajax&#x27;s figures however differ from those provided by the Johan Cruyff Arena, since the club counts all tickets sold instead of the number of people going through the turnstiles.

<text>Nadia () is a district in the state of West Bengal, India. It borders Bangladesh to the east, North 24 Parganas and Hooghly districts to the south, Purba Bardhaman to the west, and Murshidabad to the north.

Nadia district is highly influential in the cultural history of Bengal. The standard version of Bengali, developed in the 19th century, is based on the dialect spoken around Shantipur region of Nadia. Known as the &quot;Oxford of Bengal&quot;, Nabadwip made many contributions to Indian philosophy, such as the Navya-Nyaya system of logic, and is the birthplace of the Vaishnava saint Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. The district is still largely agricultural.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Nadia&quot; is a shortened name for a historic city in the district. Nabadwip, literally &quot;new island&quot;, was formerly an island created by alluvial deposits of the Ganga.

== Geography ==
Nadia district is located in southern West Bengal, in the west-central Bengal region. The district is largely an alluvial plain, formed by the constant shifting of the various rivers of the Ganges Delta. To the west of the district is the Bhagirathi (or Hooghly) river, which was once the main distributary of the Ganga towards the Bay of Bengal, and is still considered to be the continuation of the Ganga for Hindus. As the main flow of the Ganga ran east into the Padma, the Bhagirathi largely dried up. Most of the rivers flowing through Nadia now have little water in them. Nearly all the district has been converted into farmland.

=== Rivers ===
Nadia district is home to many rivers. The Padma, now the main distributary of the Ganga, touches the district on its northeastern end.

The Jalangi, which flows from Murshidabad district, forms much of the northwestern border of the district with Murshidabad, before flowing south into Nadia district. Around Krishnanagar, it turns west and flows into the Bhagirathi near Nabadwip.

The Mathabhanga originates in the far northeast of the district and forms part of the border with Bangladesh. It then flows into Bangladesh until it, again forming part of the border, reenters the district at Gede. At Maijdia, it splits into the Churni and Ichamati. The Churni flows southwest and merges with the Bhagirathi at Shibpur near Ranaghat. The Ichamati flows into Bangladesh near Mubarakpur and reenters India near Duttaphulia. It then flows south into North 24 Parganas district.

==History==
Nabadwip, an ancient town within Nadia district, is often referred to as the “Oxford of Bengal&quot;. One of the Indian schools of logic (Tarka sastra) called Navya Nyaya system was developed in Nabadwip, which produced great logicians in the 15th century. Nabadwip was an important seat of political power and the capital of Bengal under Ballal Sen and later Lakshman Sen, kings of the Sena Empire, who ruled from 1159 to 1206. In 1202, Nabadwip was captured by Bakhtiyar Khilji. This victory paved the way for Muslim rule in Bengal. The British defeated Siraj ud-Daulah, Nawab of Bengal, at Palashi in this district. The 1859 revolt against European Indigo planters started from the village of Chaugacha in Krishnanagar, Nadia. Nadia is thought to have had trade relations with Tibet, Nepal and Bhutan.

On 15 August 1947 the Indian Independence Act 1947 came into force, and for the next two days Nadia, along with Murshidabad, Malda, and West Dinajpur (present-day North Dinajpur and South Dinajpur) due to Muslim majority, were part of the Dominion of Pakistan (specifically East Bengal or East Pakistan, which seceded as Bangladesh in 1971). On 17 August 1947 the final boundary adjustment of the Radcliffe Commission transferred these districts to the Dominion of India (specifically West Bengal) , to ensure the Hooghly River was entirely within India and to maintain connectivity between Kolkata and Guwahati through Darjeeling district. But, later Nadia and West Dinajpur became Hindu majority districts due to the arrival of large number of Bengali Hindu refugees from East Bengal of Pakistan during 1947 and Bangladesh (East Bengal) liberation war in 1971.

Pre-independence Nadia had five subdivisions: Krishnagar sadar, Ranaghat, Kushtia, Meherpur and Chuadanga. Due to some cartographic error in 1947, large part of Nadia except Nabadwip initially were included into East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) due to it being a Muslim majority district in the 1941 census of British India. Due to protests rectification was made and on the night of August 17, 1947, Ranaghat, Krishnanagar, Shikarpur in Karimpur and Plassey were placed in India. Since then some parts of this district have been celebrating Independence day on August 17 and August 18.

Nadia district is also historically significant as the birthplace of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, a revered figure in Hinduism. He was born in Nabadwip, a town in the Nadia district, on the full moon night of 18 February 1486. Known as Gauranga for his molten gold-like complexion, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is considered an avatar of Lord Krishna by his followers. He founded Gaudiya Vaishnavism and popularized the chanting of the Hare Krishna Maha-mantra. His birthplace, known as Yogpeeth in Mayapur, is a major pilgrimage site for devotees.

<text>David Wannstedt (born May 21, 1952) is an American former college and professional football coach. He has been the head coach of the Chicago Bears and Miami Dolphins of the National Football League (NFL). He was also the head coach of the University of Pittsburgh football team from 2005 to 2010. He also was a long-time assistant to Jimmy Johnson with the Dallas Cowboys, Miami Hurricanes, and Oklahoma State Cowboys as well as an associate of Johnson when both were assistants at the University of Pittsburgh.

== Early life ==
Wannstedt was born in Baldwin, Pennsylvania and attended Baldwin High School. He earned an athletic scholarship to the University of Pittsburgh playing offensive tackle and blocking for future Heisman Trophy winner Tony Dorsett. After a successful career with the Panthers, he was chosen in the fifteenth round of the 1974 NFL draft by the Green Bay Packers, but spent his only NFL season on the injured reserve list with a neck injury.

== Coaching career ==

=== Assistant coach in college ===
In 1975, Pitt coach Johnny Majors hired him as a graduate assistant coach. The following year, while at Pitt, he earned his master&#x27;s degree. He was on the staff when the Panthers won the 1976 NCAA Division I-A national football championship with a victory over the Georgia Bulldogs in the 1977 Sugar Bowl. In 1977, Jimmy Johnson joined the staff of the Pitt Panthers and the two would forge a long lasting personal and professional bond. When Johnson left to become the head coach of the Oklahoma State Cowboys in 1979, he invited Wannstedt to join his staff.

Wannstedt served as defensive line coach for the Oklahoma State Cowboys for the 1979 and 1980 seasons and was promoted to defensive coordinator in 1981, a spot he held for two seasons. He moved on to the University of Southern California in 1983 to coach the Trojans and served as the defensive line coach for three years. In 1986, Wannstedt became defensive coordinator for the Miami Hurricanes under friend and mentor Jimmy Johnson, where they won a national championship in 1987.

=== Dallas Cowboys ===
When Johnson was hired as head coach of the Dallas Cowboys in 1989, Wannstedt joined Dallas&#x27; staff as defensive coordinator. The Cowboys defense was considered one of the best in the NFL under Wannstedt&#x27;s leadership and he became a prime candidate to become an NFL head coach. When Chuck Noll retired as head coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers, in 1992, Wannstedt was one of the finalists for the job, but was ultimately edged out by fellow Pittsburgh-area native Bill Cowher.

=== Chicago Bears ===
On January 19, 1993, he was hired as the head coach of the Chicago Bears replacing legendary coach Mike Ditka, another former Pitt Panther. Wannstedt&#x27;s tenure at Chicago was tumultuous. He led the Bears to only one postseason appearance in his 6 years at Chicago and compiled a 41–57 record. After Wannstedt posted back-to-back 4–12 seasons and a 1–11 overall record against long-time rival, the Green Bay Packers, Bears owner Michael McCaskey fired Wannstedt on December 28, 1998, a day when five NFL head coaches – one sixth of the league – lost their jobs. Four of those coaches—Wannstedt, Ted Marchibroda, Ray Rhodes, and Dom Capers—were fired within one hour, while Dennis Erickson was fired later that day.

=== Miami Dolphins ===
In 1999, Wannstedt again joined coach Jimmy Johnson&#x27;s staff—this time, as defensive coordinator and assistant head coach of the Miami Dolphins. When the then-56-year-old Johnson suddenly announced his retirement on January 16, 2000, Wannstedt was immediately named Johnson&#x27;s successor. Under Wannstedt, the Dolphins&#x27; regular season record was 42–31, with playoff appearances in his first two seasons. Wannstedt earned a great deal of praise for guiding the Dolphins through the first few seasons after the retirement of Dan Marino, but his in-game coaching became increasingly unpopular with Dolphins fans, not least in 2002 when the team stopped giving the ball to Ricky Williams and inexplicably gave the New England Patriots several chances to come back and tie the game and then win it in overtime, starting a six-season playoff drought. Fans were further enraged when Wannstedt, whose contract as head coach also gave him the right to overrule then-Dolphins general manager Rick Spielman on draft decisions, nixed Spielman&#x27;s plan to take Anquan Boldin in the second round and instead chose a linebacker named Eddie Moore.[needs citation]Boldin was an immediate star, winning NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year in 2003, was a three-time Pro Bowler, and was a stand-out receiver in his 13-year career. Moore was unable to help Miami on either defense or special teams and was gone from the team (and then the NFL) in just a few years. Along with another late-season collapse in 2003 and no playoff appearance that year, Wannstedt became the face of a rapidly declining franchise who most fans and many players no longer believed in.

Wannstedt resigned as head coach midway through the 2004 season, with the Dolphins&#x27; record standing at 1–8. Less than two months later, he agreed to return home to fill the head coach vacancy at his alma mater, the University of Pittsburgh. Wannstedt finished his tenure in Miami with a 42–31 record and to date, is the team&#x27;s last head coach with prior NFL head coaching experience. Wannstedt has served longer than any other coach in Dolphins history except Don Shula.

=== Pittsburgh ===
When University of Pittsburgh head coach Walt Harris elected to take the position at Stanford prior to the 2005 Fiesta Bowl, Wannstedt, with NFL experience and a proven college recruiting record, immediately became a candidate to replace him. As a Pittsburgh area native and former player (offensive tackle from 1971 to 1973) and previous graduate assistant coach at the university under Johnny Majors and Jackie Sherrill (having earned a B.S. in 1974 and M.Ed. in 1976 while coaching from 1975 to 1978), Wannstedt had strong ties to both the university and the city. Wannstedt was initially interested in the job but pulled back over salary issues and concerns about his ability to keep a quality staff. After working out several issues with the athletic department including pay raises for assistant coaches, Wannstedt agreed to the offer and was named head coach on December 23, 2004.

Wannstedt said that recruiting would be a top priority under his leadership. Harris had been roundly criticized during his tenure for not recruiting top high school talent, especially in the crucial and talent-laden Western Pennsylvania area. Wannstedt retained some of Harris&#x27; staff including Paul Rhoads, the defensive coordinator, but made several key changes including bringing in former Baltimore Ravens offensive coordinator Matt Cavanaugh to run his offense. Cavanaugh was the starting quarterback in 1976 and 1977 when Wannstedt was a graduate assistant coach.

====2005====
In his first season, Wannstedt inherited a Pittsburgh team that won a share of the Big East Championship and played in the Fiesta Bowl the previous year under Harris and was ranked 21st in the first AP Poll of 2005. However, defeats by Notre Dame and Ohio and a last second loss (by a score of 7–6) to Nebraska kicked off a disappointing 5–6 season that also saw Pittsburgh get humiliated 45–13 by archrival West Virginia. This campaign was the program&#x27;s first losing record since 1999.

====2006====
Wannstedt&#x27;s recruiting prowess led analysts to rate the Panthers&#x27; class of 2006 as among their best class in decades. Pittsburgh won six of their first seven games (with just a loss to Michigan State). The win over UCF in October proved to be their last, as a 20–10 loss to #15-ranked Rutgers started a five-game slide (with three of their losses being to ranked opponents), which included a double-overtime loss to Connecticut. Ultimately, the Panthers did not make a bowl game with their 6–6 record.

====2007====
Wannstedt followed his touted 2006 class by bringing in the #28 recruiting class in 2007. The class included blue-chip players such as RB LeSean McCoy, QB Pat Bostick, and OG Chris Jacobson. On December 1, 2007, just days before an upset win at West Virginia, Wannstedt was given a contract extension through 2012; he had previously been signed through 2009. The 13–9 upset win in the annual Backyard Brawl denied the Mountaineers a chance to play in the BCS National Championship Game and was the start of a turnaround that subsequently lifted Coach Wannstedt and the Panthers to a 9–4 season in 2008.

====2008====
The Panthers started the 2008 season ranked in the top 25 for the first time under Wannstedt&#x27;s leadership (although the Panthers were ranked #25 in the pre-season before Wannstedt&#x27;s first game in 2005). Starting 0–1, Pitt soon defeated Buffalo and then beat Iowa with a 21–20 victory. On Thursday, October 2, 2008, the Panthers scored an upset win over the then-ranked and undefeated #10 South Florida in a game nationally televised by ESPN. Then on Saturday, October 18, 2008, the Panthers easily defeated Navy. Upset by Rutgers, however, Pitt rebounded with a 36–33 overtime victory the following week at Notre Dame. The game, which lasted four overtime periods, was the longest game ever for both Notre Dame and Pittsburgh. After a 41–7 rout of visiting Louisville, the Panthers improved to 7–2 and were bowl-bound for the first time under Wannstedt.
A loss to eventual Big East champion Cincinnati eliminated the Panthers from BCS contention. However, Coach Wannstedt stayed upbeat, and worked with defensive coordinator Phil Bennett to devise a gameplan to defeat West Virginia for the 2nd time in four years in the annual Backyard Brawl. Pitt defeated West Virginia 19–15 on the day after Thanksgiving in a national telecast on ABC. The following week the Panthers won at UConn to improve to 9–3 on the season and clinch a bid to the Sun Bowl.

On December 31, 2008, Pittsburgh was defeated in the Sun Bowl by Oregon State 3–0 in a defensive struggle.

====2009====
In 2009, Wannstedt led Pittsburgh to a 3–0 start before losing on the road to N.C. State in the fourth quarter. Wannstedt&#x27;s Panthers then won their next 6 games, raising Pitt&#x27;s record to 9–1 and the team cracked the Top 10 in the rankings, their best mark since the Dan Marino led team in 1982. The Panthers faltered in their final two games, however, losing to both West Virginia 19–16 and 2009 Cincinnati 45–44 in the Big East Championship game to fall to 9–3. After the regular season, Pitt went on to defeat the North Carolina Tar Heels in the 2009 Meineke Car Care Bowl to finish the season with 10 wins for the first time since 1981.

On March 30, 2010, Wannstedt received a two-year contract extension through the 2014 season.

On December 7, 2010, Wannstedt resigned as head coach, reportedly under pressure following a disappointing 7–5 regular season and having failed to advance to a BCS bowl during his tenure. With his resignation, Wannstedt was offered a position as special assistant to the athletic director at the university. He did not coach the 2011 BBVA Compass Bowl.

=== Buffalo Bills ===
On January 21, 2011, it was announced that Wannstedt was joining the Bills staff as assistant head coach/linebackers coach under Chan Gailey, who served as Wannstedt&#x27;s offensive coordinator in Miami in 2000 and 2001. He was promoted to defensive coordinator on January 2, 2012. He was dismissed, along with the entire Bills coaching staff, on December 31, 2012, after the Bills finished the season with a 6–10 record.

=== Tampa Bay Buccaneers ===
Wannstedt was hired as the Tampa Bay Buccaneers&#x27; special teams coach on February 1, 2013. He joined the staff of Greg Schiano, who was an assistant under Wannstedt with the Chicago Bears during the mid-to-late 1990s. He was let go by the Buccaneers at the end of the 2013 season.

== Television career ==
Wannstedt has been a FOX Sports football studio analyst since 2014, appears on FOX NFL Kickoff Sunday mornings during the NFL season, and was an analyst for the Chicago Bears preseason game broadcast on August 29, 2019. As of 2023, he is currently a host of Pro Football Weekly on NBC Sports Chicago.

<text>The Gemeindeordnung () is the municipal code in German law.

==Germany==
Historically, the Gemeindeordnung was state law. During the Weimar Republic, it became federal law named Deutsche Gemeindeordnung. The Nazi regime made several revisions to comply with their political and legal philosophy. 

The German constitution Grundgesetz written in 1949 strongly emphasised the state&#x27;s authority, and as a result the enactment of the municipal code was transferred back to the states. 

Each German state has its own municipal code. There may be further laws like a Kommunalwahlgesetz, containing legal norms for local elections, which are also enacted by the states.

The Gemeindeordnung substitutes a city statute, as it contains a constitution with basic and special rules for every form of community from the smallest village to big cities like Munich, Frankfurt and Cologne. Berlin, Hamburg, and Bremen are themselves city-states and not part of a state.

<text>Lineage II is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) for Windows and the second game in the &quot;Lineage&quot; series. It is a prequel to &quot;Lineage&quot; and is set 150 years before the first game. It has become popular since its October 1, 2003 launch in South Korea, reporting 40,027,918 unique users during the month of March 2007. To date, the game has been played by more than 94 million users from all over the world.

&quot;Lineage II&quot; adopted a free-to-play model in Lineage II: Goddess of Destruction, with all game content being free except for &quot;purchasable in-game store items and packs&quot; in November 2011. A prequel, &quot;Lineage 2: Revolution&quot;, was released as a mobile game in 2016.

&quot;Lineage 2M&quot; was launched for the first time in South Korea in November 2019.

== Gameplay ==
In &quot;Lineage II&quot;, players create a character, choose the race and personalise the face and hair in style, colour, expression and gender.

Every player begins the game in a temple in their character&#x27;s race&#x27;s zone (for example: Humans start in &quot;Talking Island&quot; and the Dark Elves in &quot;The Shilen Temple&quot;). Most commonly, the player can choose between a mage and a fighter in each race except Dwarves and Kamael, which can be only fighters.

=== Battles ===
A major part of &quot;Lineage II&quot; gameplay is the combat. Monsters can be found outside of Towns on the hunting fields or deep inside underground dungeons. When the player defeats a monster, their character gets XP and SP to help them level up and learn new skills.

Players can also fight other players through a PvP system.

=== Death ===
If a player&#x27;s character dies in battle, they are given the option to resurrect in the nearest town or village. They can also wait for another player to resurrect them with a Resurrection scroll or spell. Resurrecting in the nearest town costs a fraction of the XP gained, which grows exponentially with level. Resurrection spells and elite scrolls generally restore some of the lost experience.

== Plot ==
The game follows a fictional history through sets of plots called &quot;Sagas&quot;. There are currently four sagas: &quot;The Chaotic Chronicle&quot;, &quot;The Chaotic Throne&quot;, &quot;Goddess of Destruction&quot;, and &quot;Epic Tale of Aden&quot;. Large-scale updates/expansions are known as &quot;Chronicles&quot; (also known as &quot;The Throne&quot; in &quot;The Chaotic Throne&quot;, &quot;Chapter&quot; in &quot;Goddess of Destruction&quot;, and &quot;Episode&quot; in &quot;Epic Tale of Aden&quot;), which introduce new story elements as well as new features and add-ons. They are released every six months. Each expansion features new skills, quests, areas, and items. Some expansions also increased the level cap.

== Characters ==
Players elect up to seven characters per account. There are currently seven races in the world of &quot;Lineage II&quot;: the Humans, who are similar to modern-day humans and who have all-around balanced characteristics; the Elves, who have superior dexterity, movement, and casting speed, but weaker offense; Dark Elves, who have higher magic and melee attack capabilities; Orcs, who have higher HP and MP but slower movement; Dwarves, who are powerful melee attackers and master craftsmen; Kamael, who are humanoids with single wings and gender-specific job classes; and Ertheia, female warriors with two completely unique classes, and different quest lines.

== Development ==
Hyeong-Jin Kim, the production team head for &quot;Lineage II&quot;, came up with the basic concept for the game in early 2000. Development happened in October–November of the same year. Kim and producer James Bae have stated that their reasons for developing a prequel for &quot;Lineage&quot; rather than a sequel is that &quot;&quot;Lineage&quot; will continue to be updated as a game&quot;, and that they did not want to risk a conflict with the direction of updates that &quot;Lineage&quot; will take in the future.

According to Kim and Bae, the game&#x27;s initial subtitle, &quot;The Chaotic Chronicle&quot;, was developed with the intention to express the large-scale war, strategies, conflicts, and collaborations that they hoped to encourage among players.

Lead game designer Raoul Kim said that the reason for rendering &quot;Lineage II&quot; in 3D was &quot;simply because most games today are [also] using 3D graphics&quot;, and because they deemed it &quot;more appropriate than 2D for the things that [they] were going to create&quot;. Developers chose to use the Unreal Engine 2 game engine because of its ability to render outdoor scenes and its powerful editing features.

According to Game Design team head, Cheol-Woong Hwang, there were different concepts for each of the race&#x27;s home villages. He described the concept for the human village in Talking Island as &quot;ordinary&quot;, while the Elven Village was designed &quot;so as not to lose the natural and royal high-class feeling&quot;. They designed the Dark Elven village based on a &quot;grotesque and serious feeling in order to express the rough history of these who had been expelled from the Elves&quot;. There are three versions of &quot;Lineage II&quot; currently available - Classic/Legacy, Aden/Essence and Live/Main.

== Reception ==
The overall reception for &quot;Lineage II&quot; is mixed; the game received average review scores from various video game rating websites. Andrew Park of GameSpot said that the game &quot;offers either a repetitive grind or a stiff challenge&quot;, and is not suitable for casual gamers who can only play an hour or less per day. Allen &quot;Delsyn&quot; Rausch called the Kamael &quot;an interesting race in that, unlike other &quot;Lineage II&quot; races, they focus specifically on the warrior path with high-level class paths segregated by gender&quot;.

The &quot;Chronicle 5: Oath of Blood&quot; expansion won the Expansion of the Year award at Stratics Central Editor&#x27;s Choice Awards 2006, and &quot;Lineage II&quot; earned an Honorable Mention for the Game of the Year award. During the 9th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, &quot;Lineage II&quot; received a nomination for &quot;Massively Multiplayer Game of the Year&quot;.

== Sequels ==
&quot;Lineage II&quot; is one of the MMOs that were subject to ethnographic study in Constance Steinkuehler and Dmitri Williams&#x27;s article, &quot;Where Everybody Knows Your (Screen) Name: Online Games as &#x27;Third Places&#x27;&quot;.

=== &quot;Lineage 2 M&quot; ===
&quot;Lineage 2 M&quot; is a mobile game that aims to replicate the gameplay of &quot;Lineage II&quot; but for mobile devices. It was released on November 27, 2019.

=== Prequel ===

A prequel, &quot;Lineage 2: Revolution&quot;, was released as a mobile game in 2016.

=== Sequel ===

NCsoft officially announced &quot;Lineage Eternal&quot; as the sequel to the first &quot;Lineage&quot; in November 2011. The first gameplay videos debuted at the G-Star 2011 gaming convention in South Korea on November 10. NCSoft renamed the game &quot;Project TL&quot; in 2017 and &quot;Throne and Liberty&quot; in 2022. It was released in 2023.

<doc id="1332128" wikidata="Q1976976" url="?curid=1332128" title="Nelson Doubleday">
<text>Nelson Doubleday (June 16, 1889 – January 11, 1949) was an American book publisher and president of Doubleday Company from 1922–1946. His father Frank Nelson Doubleday had founded the business. His son Nelson Doubleday Jr. followed him into it, taking part in expansion and serving as president from 1978–1986.

==Early life and education==
Nelson Doubleday was born in Brooklyn, New York to Frank Nelson Doubleday (the first Doubleday ancestor came to Boston in the early 1600s from England) (the name Doubleday is English – possibly of Norman origin originally, &quot;DuBaldy&quot; ) and Neltje Blanchan. His older brother Felix Doty was adopted, and he had a younger sister Dorothy. In the city, the children attended a private Friends School run by Quakers. The family moved out to a large estate in Locust Valley on Long Island, called &quot;Effendi&quot; after their father&#x27;s nickname given to him by his friend, the British author Rudyard Kipling. The author wrote his &quot;Just So Stories&quot; after the boy Nelson asked him to publish a book of animal stories.

Nelson grew up in the world of book publishing, as his father had founded the Doubleday company. His mother wrote several books about gardening and birds, which were considered notable for their combination of scientific content and lyrical expression.

Nelson later studied at Dr. Holbrook&#x27;s Military School in Ossining, New York. He attended two years of New York University before joining his father in business, which he found more interesting. Even as a youth, he had creative solutions to business issues, for instance, suggesting selling dated magazines at a discount and thereby gaining some revenue from them.

==Career==
Doubleday established his own business in 1910 and used the profits to publish books under his own imprint. After serving in World War I, he joined his father&#x27;s firm, Doubleday, Page and Company, as a junior partner. After the firm merged with Doran Company, and upon his father&#x27;s death in 1934, Nelson Doubleday became chairman of the board of Doubleday, Doran Company, Incorporated. He remained chairman of the firm (later Doubleday and Company) until his death in 1949. With some expansion, he still maintained Doubleday as a family publishing business, with one associated book club.

==Marriage and family==
He married Ellen McCarter (1899–1978). Her father was an attorney who organized the Public Service Corporation in New Jersey, serving as president for its first 36 years.

They had a son Nelson Doubleday Jr. (1933–2015) and a daughter Neltje (1934–2021), named for Nelson&#x27;s mother. At age 18, Neltje married John Turner Sargent, Sr., who was already working at Doubleday, and they had two children. Nelson senior died, aged 59, in Oyster Bay, Long Island.
Both Sargent and Nelson Doubleday, Jr., worked for Doubleday. Beginning with Sargent in 1963, each served as president. Nelson Jr. served as president from 1978 to 1986 when, following wide changes in the publishing business, he sold the company to the German conglomerate, Bertelsmann.

After the Sargents divorced in 1965, Neltje moved to Wyoming with her two children. She remarried, bought a ranch and restored and operated the historic Sheridan Inn, and became an abstract artist. In the 1980s, she created the &quot;Neltje Blanchan Literary Prize&quot; in honor of her paternal grandmother. In 2001, Neltje founded Jentel, an artist-in-residence program supported by her private family foundation. In 2005, Neltje received the Governor&#x27;s Art Award as one of Wyoming&#x27;s &quot;preeminent artists.&quot; In 2010, she made an estate gift of her ranch, studio, art collection and financial holdings to the University of Wyoming, the largest in its history.

==Legacy and honors==
Ellen Doubleday left her collection of Doubleday business and personal documents to Princeton University. The &quot;Ellen McCarter Doubleday Papers, circa 1930s–1978&quot; contain business and social correspondence, documents by and from Doubleday authors, personal and family letters, and issues related to Doubleday estates.

<doc id="1332129" wikidata="Q350517" url="?curid=1332129" title="Cratinus">
<text>Cratinus (; 519 BC – 422 BC) was an Athenian comic poet of the Old Comedy.

==Life==
Cratinus was victorious 27 known times, eight times at the City Dionysia, first probably in the mid-to-late 450s BCE (IG II2 2325. 50), and three times at the Lenaia, first probably in the early 430s (IG II2 2325. 121; just before Pherecrates and Hermippus). He was still competing in 423 BC, when his &quot;Pytine&quot; took the prize at the City Dionysia; he died shortly thereafter, at a very advanced age, about 97 years (test. 3).

Little is known of his personal history. His father&#x27;s name was Callimedes, and he himself was a taxiarch. The &quot;Suda&quot; has brought several accusations against Cratinus. First, it accuses Cratinus of excessive cowardice. Secondly, a charge against the moral character. Thirdly, a charge of habitual intemperance. Having examined all these charges, it may be safe to say that all of these charges are unlikely to be true, and that there is no evidence that Cratinus really committed such things. Moreover, other writers, including Aristophanes, were silent on these charges, except the third charge, which is sustained by many passages of Aristophanes and other writers. They also refer the &quot;Confession of Cratinus&quot;, which Cratinus himself seems to have treated the subject in a very amusing way, especially in his &quot;Pytine&quot;.

That he was related to the 4th-century comic poet Cratinus Junior is a reasonable hypothesis but cannot be proven.

==Works==
Cratinus was regarded as one of the three great masters of Athenian Old Comedy (the others being Aristophanes and Eupolis). Although his poetry is several times described as relatively graceless, harsh, and crudely abusive (test. 17; 19), his plays continued to be read and studied in the Hellenistic and Roman periods. He wrote 21 comedies. They were chiefly distinguished by their direct and vigorous political satire. 514 fragments (including ten dubia) of his comedies survive, along with 29 titles. His most famous play is the &quot;Pytine&quot;.

===&quot;Pytine&quot;===
The &quot;Pytine&quot; (The Wineflask) was Cratinus&#x27; most famous play. A grammarian describes the background of the play as follows: In 424 BC, Aristophanes produced &quot;The Knights&quot;, in which he described Cratinus &quot;as a drivelling old man, wandering about with his crown withered, and so utterly neglected by his former admirers that he could not even procure to quench the thirst of which he was perishing&quot; Soon after that play, Cratinus responded by producing a play called &quot;Pytine&quot; (The Wineflask) in 423 BC, which defeated the &quot;Connus&quot; of Ameipsias and &quot;The Clouds&quot; of Aristophanes, which was produced in the same year.

===Other plays===
In Grenfell and Hunt&#x27;s &quot;Oxyrhynchus Papyri&quot;, iv. (1904), containing a further instalment of their edition of the &quot;Behnesa papyri&quot; discovered by them in 1896–1897, one of the greatest curiosities is a scrap of paper bearing the argument of a play by Cratinus, the &quot;Dionysalexandros&quot; (i.e. Dionysus in the part of Paris), aimed against Pericles; and the epitome reveals something of its wit and point. Other plays of Cratinus include
*&quot;Archilochoi&quot; (&quot;The Archilochuses&quot;) (c. 448 BC)
*&quot;Boukoloi&quot; (&quot;The Cow-Herds&quot;)
*&quot;Bousiris&quot; (&quot;Busiris&quot;)
*&quot;Deliades&quot; (&quot;Women From Delos&quot;)
*&quot;Didaskaliai&quot; (&quot;The Rehearsals&quot;)
*&quot;Drapetides&quot; (&quot;Female Runaways&quot;)
*&quot;Empipramenoi&quot; (&quot;Men On Fire&quot;) or &quot;Idaioi&quot; (&quot;The Idaeans&quot;)
*&quot;Euneidai&quot; (&quot;Children of Euneus&quot;)
*&quot;Thrattai&quot; (&quot;Women From Thrace&quot;)
*&quot;Kleoboulinai&quot; (&quot;The Cleobulines&quot;)
*&quot;Lakones&quot; (&quot;The Laconians&quot;)
*&quot;Malthakoi&quot; (&quot;The Soft Ones&quot;)
*&quot;Nemesis&quot; (&quot;Nemesis&quot;)
*&quot;Nomoi&quot; (&quot;The Laws&quot;)
*&quot;Odysseis&quot; (&quot;The Odysseuses&quot;)
*&quot;Panoptai&quot; (&quot;The All-Seers&quot;)
*&quot;Ploutoi&quot; (&quot;The Gods of Wealth&quot;)
*&quot;Pylaia&quot; (&quot;The Meeting At Pylae&quot;)
*&quot;Satyroi&quot; (&quot;Satyrs&quot;), won 2nd prize at the Lenaea of 424 BC
*&quot;Seriphioi&quot; (&quot;Men From Seriphus&quot;)
*&quot;Trophonios&quot; (&quot;Trophonius&quot;)
*&quot;Cheimazomenoi&quot; (&quot;Storm-Tossed Men&quot;), won 2nd prize at Lenaea of 425 BC
*&quot;Cheirones&quot; (&quot;The Chirons&quot;)
*&quot;Horai&quot; (&quot;The Hours&quot;)
462 fragments of Cratinus survive.

==Style==
The style of Cratinus has been likened to that of Aeschylus. He appears to have been fond of lofty diction and bold figures, and was most successful in the lyrical parts of his dramas, his choruses being the popular festal songs of his day. According to the statement of a doubtful authority, not borne out by Aristotle, Cratinus increased the number of actors in comedy to three.

==Standard edition==

The standard edition of the fragments and testimonia is in Rudolf Kassel and Colin François Lloyd Austin&#x27;s &quot;Poetae Comici Graeci&quot; Vol. IV. The eight-volume &quot;Poetae Comici Graeci&quot; produced from 1983 to 2001 replaces the outdated collections &quot;Fragmenta Comicorum Graecorum&quot; by August Meineke (1839-1857), &quot;Comicorum Atticorum Fragmenta&quot; by Theodor Kock (1880-1888) and &quot;Comicorum Graecorum Fragmenta&quot; by Georg Kaibel (1899).

<text>USS &quot;Susquehanna&quot; (AOG-5) was a in service with United States Navy from 1943 to 1946 and with the Military Sea Transportation Service from 1950 to 1959. She was scrapped in 1973.

==History==
USS &quot;Susquehanna&quot; was named for a river which rises in Lake Otsego in central New York and flows across Pennsylvania and the northeast corner of Maryland to empty into the Chesapeake Bay. Her keel was laid down on 9 September 1942 by the Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding Corporation of Seattle, Washington. She was launched on 23 November 1942; sponsored by Mrs. William Lindstrom and commissioned on 7 June 1943.

===World War II===
&quot;Susquehanna&quot; sailed for San Diego, California, on 25 June to begin her shakedown cruise which ended one month later. She moved up the coast to San Pedro, California, to load and, on 27 July, got underway for Australia. The tanker arrived at Townsville, Queensland, on 18 August and was attached to the Service Force, Seventh Fleet. On 4 September, she was underway for the Milne Bay area of New Guinea to service fleet units there. She returned to Australia to load cargo and aviation gas, from 23 November to 29 November, and delivered it to Milne Bay. &quot;Susquehanna&quot; operated between Australian and New Guinea ports until December 1944. She made two trips to the Netherlands East Indies and, in addition to supplying gas for large fleet units, serviced PT boats at Buna and other bases.

&quot;Susquehanna&quot; departed New Guinea on 20 December 1944 with a load of cargo and fuel for Leyte, and arrived there on 26 December. She departed the Dulag transport area on 2 January 1945 for Mindoro with gasoline for the United States Army air strips. The convoy that &quot;Susquehanna&quot; was attached to, composed mostly of minesweepers, was under enemy air attack on 2 January, 3 January, and 4 January. Of four planes that attacked the convoy on 3 January, one was splashed by gunfire from &quot;Susquehanna&quot;.

She sailed from the Philippines on 16 February, returned to the New Guinea operating area, and remained there until returning to Manila on 13 December 1945. She operated in the Philippine Islands until mid-August 1946. &quot;Susquehanna&quot; was transferred to the United States Army on 15 August 1946 and struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 23 April 1947.

===Korean War===
The tanker was reacquired and reinstated on the Naval Vessel Register on 1 July 1950. She was assigned to the Military Sea Transportation Service (MSTS) at that time with hull classification symbol T-AOG-5.

For the next nine years, &quot;Susquehanna&quot; shuttled between ports in Japan and Korea. The tanker finally departed Yokosuka for the United States on 17 February 1959 and arrived at San Francisco, California, on 6 March. &quot;Susquehanna&quot; moved to the Suisun Bay Reserve Fleet on 26 March 1959 and was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on that date. &quot;Susquehanna&quot; was sold on 10 August 1973 to the Levin Metals Corp, San Jose, California, for $43,655. &quot;Susquehanna&quot; was removed from Suisun Bay on 30 September 1973 and scrapped shortly after.

<text>Wesley Carl Hopkins (September 26, 1961 – September 28, 2018) was an American professional football player who played as a safety for the Philadelphia Eagles during his entire 11-year National Football League career from 1983 through 1993. A walk-on for the Southern Methodist football team, he was first noticed by coaches and teammates during a team practice after he made a ferocious tackle on his college teammate and future Pro Football Hall of Fame running back Eric Dickerson. Hopkins was named to the All-Conference selection in each of his last two seasons at SMU.

==NFL career==

Hopkins was drafted by the Eagles in the second round (35th pick overall) of the 1983 NFL draft and started 14 games at free safety as a rookie. In 1985, he had a career-high 6 interceptions (including one for a touchdown) was voted Most Valuable Player on the Eagles defense and was selected to the Pro Bowl. In 1988, he was voted the Eagles Ed Block Courage Award winner. As part of the Eagles vaunted &quot;Gang Green&quot; defense, the safety tandem of Hopkins and strong safety Andre Waters lasted from 1986 to 1993. With Buddy Ryan as head coach from 1986 to 1990, the tandem were considered one of the hardest hitting and most feared safety duos in the NFL. Hopkins retired after the 1993 season and finished his career with 30 interceptions, 12 sacks and 1 touchdown.

==Death==

Hopkins died on September 28, 2018, at age 57. He reportedly had been in failing health for a couple of months. Former teammate Harvey Armstrong said he is fairly certain that Hopkins was suffering from chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a degenerative brain disease that has been found in more than 100 former NFL players whose families donated their brains for research.
&quot;He just went into a shell, much like Andre (Waters) did,&quot; Armstrong said. &quot;You could see some of the things he was dealing with. The depression and the anxiety and the other things that CTE causes.&quot;

<doc id="1332143" wikidata="Q4563471" url="?curid=1332143" title="1934 World Series">
<text>The 1934 World Series was the championship series in Major League Baseball for the 1934 season. The 31st edition of the World Series, it matched the St. Louis Cardinals against the Detroit Tigers. The Cardinals&#x27; &quot;Gashouse Gang&quot; won in seven games for their third championship in nine years.

The Cardinals and Tigers split the first two games in Detroit, and Detroit took two of the next three in St. Louis. But St. Louis won the next two in Detroit, including an 11–0 embarrassment in Game 7 to win the Series. The stars for the Cardinals were Joe (&quot;Ducky&quot;) Medwick, who hit .379 and one of St. Louis&#x27; two home runs, Jack Rothrock, who hit a series-high 6 RBI’s, and the meteoric (&quot;Me &#x27;n&#x27; Paul&quot;) Dean brothers, Dizzy and Paul (or &quot;Daffy&quot;) Dean, who won two games each with a combined 28 strikeouts and a minuscule 1.43 earned run average. The 1934 World Series was also the last in which both teams were led by player-managers, in this case the Cardinals&#x27; Frankie Frisch and the Tigers&#x27; Mickey Cochrane.

==Background==
The Cardinals, led by the Dean brothers, used only six other pitchers in amassing a team earned-run average of 2.34 for their 1934 Series victory,

Pete Fox played for the losing team, yet became the only player in Series history, , to hit six doubles in a World Series.

For his top-of-the-sixth triple in Game 7, Joe Medwick slid hard into Tiger third baseman Marv Owen. They tangled briefly, and when Medwick went back to his position in left field for the bottom of the inning enraged Tiger fans, knowing the game was all but lost (the score was 9–0 by then), vented their frustrations on him, pelting him with fruit, vegetables, bottles and cushions among other things. It was a feat for him to make the catch of a fly ball instead of the orange thrown close to it. Commissioner Landis ordered Medwick out of the game, ending the ruckus. Newsreel footage shows Medwick slamming his glove against the dugout bench in disgust. It was the only time a Commissioner has ejected a player from any major league game.(Audio)

Dizzy Dean nearly took himself out of the Series on a play in Game 4. In the fourth inning, he pinch-ran and broke up a double play the hard way; i.e., by taking the errant relay throw to first flush on the noggin. The great Dean lay unconscious on the field. (He was later to protest, &quot;Hell, it was only a glancing blow.&quot;) He was rushed to a hospital for observation, where he was given a clean bill of health. Legend has it that at least one newspaper the next day featured the headline, &quot;X-ray of Dean&#x27;s head shows nothing.&quot; Be that as it may, ol&#x27; Diz recovered rapidly enough to start Game 5 (a 3–1 loss to Tiger curveballer Tommy Bridges) the very next day.

According to Charles Einstein&#x27;s &quot;The Fireside Book of Baseball&quot;, in the midst of the Cardinals&#x27; Game 7 rout, player-manager Frankie Frisch, the &quot;Fordham Flash&quot;, called time and walked out to the mound from second base to warn Diz, &quot;If you don&#x27;t stop clowning around, I&#x27;ll take you out of the game.&quot; Dizzy said, &quot;No you won&#x27;t.&quot; Frisch thought about this a moment, then retreated to second.

==Summary==
==Matchups==

===Game 1===
The series opener in Detroit pitted the Cardinals&#x27; 30-game winner, Dizzy Dean, against the Tigers&#x27; &quot;General&quot; Crowder. The subpar Tiger defense behind the General let him down with five errors and three unearned runs.

In the top of the second, the Gashouse Gang loaded the bases with a single and two errors; a single by Jack Rothrock then brought home both Ernie Orsatti and Dean to make it 2–0. In the third inning, St. Louis tacked on another run due to more shoddy Detroit fielding. Medwick singled and was forced out at second by Ripper Collins, but a throwing error by Tiger shortstop Billy Rogell allowed Collins to move to second and then score on another error by Detroit&#x27;s star first baseman, Hank Greenberg. In the bottom of the third, Charlie Gehringer got the Tigers on the board with a single that drove in Jo-Jo White, but in the St. Louis fifth Medwick tattooed a home run off Crowder for a 4–1 Cardinal lead.

The Gang then exploded for a four-run sixth off Firpo Marberry (who had relieved Crowder) and Elon Hogsett, as Pepper Martin and Medwick each cracked RBI singles and Bill DeLancey lashed a two-run double to left. Though Detroit put up single runs in the sixth and eighth (via a Goose Goslin single that scored Greenberg and a home run by Greenberg), they could get no closer, as Dean struck out Gee Walker to give St. Louis an 8–3 win and a 1–0 lead in the series.

===Game 2===
The second game of the Series was much closer than the first, pitting the Cardinals&#x27; Bill Hallahan against the Tigers&#x27; Schoolboy Rowe.

In the top of the second, St. Louis drew first blood on DeLancey&#x27;s single and Orsatti&#x27;s triple. They added another run in the third as a Medwick single brought in Martin, but the Tigers came back and edged them 3–2 in 12 innings.

===Game 3===
The Tigers left 13 men on base as Pepper Martin&#x27;s double, triple and two runs scored enabled the Cardinals to win, 4-1.

===Game 4===
The Tigers evened the series, winning 10-4, with five runs in the eighth. Hank Greenberg had four hits and three RBI and Billy Rogell had four RBI.

This game was the first time that the song, &quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game&quot;, was played during the World Series, after being played at a high school game earlier that year in Los Angeles.

===Game 5===
Tommy Bridges won after just one day of rest. Charlie Gehringer&#x27;s home run in the sixth was the game-winning hit.

===Game 6===
Paul Dean won his second game of the series and helped his own cause with a game-winning single in the seventh inning.

===Game 7===
The Cardinals easily won Game 7, 11–0, behind Dizzy Dean. Ducky Medwick was taken out of the game for his own safety after sliding hard into third baseman Marv Owen and being pelted by the crowd with bottles and fruit when he took the field in the sixth inning.

<doc id="1332144" wikidata="Q738727" url="?curid=1332144" title="Mark of Ephesus">
<text>Mark of Ephesus (Greek: Μάρκος ὁ Ἐφέσιος, born Manuel Eugenikos) was a hesychast theologian of the late Palaiologan period of the Byzantine Empire who became famous for his rejection of the Council of Ferrara–Florence (1438–1439). As a monk in Constantinople, Mark was a prolific hymnographer and a follower of Gregory Palamas&#x27; theological views. As a theologian and a scholar, he was instrumental in the preparations for the Council of Ferrara–Florence, and as Metropolitan of Ephesus and delegate for the Patriarch of Alexandria, he was one of the most important voices at the synod. After renouncing the council as a lost cause, Mark became the leader of the Orthodox opposition to the Union of Florence, thus sealing his reputation as a defender of Eastern Orthodoxy and pillar of the Eastern Orthodox Church.

==Early life==
Mark was born Manuel in 1392 in Constantinople to George, &quot;sakellarios&quot; of Hagia Sophia, an Orthodox deacon, and Maria, the daughter of a devout doctor named Luke. Mark learned how to read and write from his father, who died while Mark and his younger brother John Eugenikos were still children. Maria had Mark continue his education under John Chortasmenos, who later became Metropolitan Ignatius of Selymbria, and a mathematician and philosopher by the name of Gemistus Pletho.

==Activity at the Council of Florence and aftermath==

St Mark of Ephesus was one of the Eastern bishops who refused to sign the agreement with the Roman Church concerning the addition of the Filioque clause during the Council of Ferrara–Florence, however, was cordial in dialogues with the Catholics. He held that the Latin Church continued in both heresy and schism. Due to this, he has been referred to as one of the Pillars of Orthodoxy — alongside St Photios &amp; St Gregorios Palamas. He also rejected the doctrine of Purgatory, in that he objected to the existence of a purgatorial fire that purified the souls of the faithful of their imperfections before reception of the Beatific Vision.

==Death==
He died peacefully at the age of 52 on June 23, 1444, after an excruciating two-week battle with intestinal illness. On his death bed, Mark implored Georgios Scholarios, his former pupil, who later became Patriarch Gennadius of Constantinople, to be careful of involvement with Western Christendom and to defend Orthodoxy. According to his brother John, his last words were &quot;Jesus Christ, Son of the Living God, into Thy hands I commit my spirit.&quot; Mark was buried in the Mangana Monastery in Constantinople.

==Posthumous miracle and canonization==
The Eugenikos family celebrated each anniversary of Mark&#x27;s death with a eulogy consisting of a service (akolouthia) and synaxarion of a short life of Mark. Thanks in large part to Patriarch Gennadius Scholarius, veneration of Mark spread among the church. In 1734 Patriarch Seraphim of Constantinople presided over the Holy Synod of the Church of Constantinople and solemnly glorified (canonized) Mark and added six services to the two older ones.

There is an account of a posthumous miracle performed by Mark of Ephesus. Doctors gave up on trying to save the life of the terminally ill sister of Demetrios Zourbaios, after their efforts had worsened her condition. After losing consciousness for three days she suddenly woke up, to the delight of her brother, who asked her why she woke up drenched in water. She related that a bishop escorted her to a fountain and washed her and told her, &quot;Return now; you no longer have any illness.&quot; She asked him who he was and he informed her, &quot;I am the Metropolitan of Ephesus, Mark Eugenikos.&quot; After being miraculously healed, she made an icon of Saint Mark and lived devoutly for another 15 years.

==Legacy==

The Orthodox Church considers Mark of Ephesus a saint, calling him, together with Photius the Great and Gregory Palamas, a Pillar of Orthodoxy. Nikodimos of the Holy Mountain, in his service to the saint, called him &quot;the Atlas of Orthodoxy.&quot; His feast day is January 19, the day his relics were moved to the monastery of Lazarus in Galata.

==Theology ==
Mark&#x27;s theological output was extensive and covered a wide range of genres and topics typical of monastic writers.

===Hymnography===
Mark composed a wealth of poetic texts honoring God and the saints, many of which were intended for use in a liturgical setting. In addition to canons and services to Jesus Christ, the Mother of God, and the angels, Mark honored his favorite Fathers of the Church: Gregory Palamas, John Damascene, Symeon Metaphrastes, along with a wealth of more ancient saints. Additionally, Mark composed verses celebrating the lives and achievements of his heroes, such as Joseph Bryennios.

===Hesychasm===
Mark was a devoted disciple of Gregory Palamas. Throughout his life he composed several treatises in defense of the essence–energies distinction, and he defended the unique contributions of Hesychast theology in the face of charges of innovation.

===Dogmatic/polemical theology===
One of Mark&#x27;s most important theological contributions was his opposition to the Roman Catholic Filioque. At the Council of Florence, the examination of this controversy had both text-critical and exegetical dimensions, as the participants debated the authenticity of sources, the precision of grammatical constructions, and the canon of authoritative patristic texts. Mark had played an early role in the gathering of manuscripts, and his contested readings at the synod have since been vindicated for their precision and accuracy.

During The council of florence Mark made strong arguments against the latin use of the word Filloque.
Echoing centuries of polemic, going back to Photius, the debates surrounding the Filioque admitted resonances of more recent discussions, such as those of John Bekkos and Gregory of Cyprus. In the end, Mark could not concede that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Son as well as the Father, even by using the Orthodox phrase of &quot;through the Son,&quot; since Mark considered this to be an equivocation in light of the obvious theological disagreements between East and West. For Eugenikos, the Holy Spirit proceeds only from the Father, and the phrase &quot;through the Son&quot; did not express anything like the theology of the Filioque.

===Anthropology===
Mark&#x27;s criticism of the doctrine of Purgatory, the other major topic at Florence, involved him in questions relating to the nature of the human composite. Basing himself on Palamite conceptions of man, Mark articulated a theory of the human person rooted in Christology and Orthodox doctrines of Creation. Mark&#x27;s discourses at Florence are, in this regard, supplemented by writings which he produced in response to the Platonism of Gemisthus Plethon, who preached a radical identification of the human person with the soul, to the detriment of embodied life.

===Latin influences===
The Palaiologan period in which Mark lived witnessed the translation of the works of Thomas Aquinas into Greek, an event whose repercussions have yet to be fully documented and expounded. In spite of remaining ambiguities, though, it has become increasingly clear that the Hesychasts were not unaware of Latin theology.

Some scholars have hypothesized that Mark adopts Thomas Aquinas&#x27; hylomorphism in his defense of the Resurrection, and that he experiments with arguments from Thomas Aquinas&#x27; Summa contra Gentiles in order to argue for the concomitance of mercy in God&#x27;s condemnation of unrepentant sinners to hell. &quot;Further, Eugenicus’ treatise Peri anastaseôs (ed. A. SCHMEMANN, “Une œuvre inédite de St Marc d’Éphèse: Peri anastaseôs”, in: Theología 22 (1951): 51–64; text on pp. 53–60) is merely a defence of the rational possibility of the doctrine of resurrection and a rational refutation of some philosophical objections against it based almost entirely on Thomas Aquinas’ description of the natural unity of the human soul with the body in explicitly hylomorphic and anti-Platonic terms (see Summa contra Gentiles IV,79-81; cf. Vat. gr. 616, ff. 289r-294v).&quot; Also, eminent Eastern Orthodox scholars have already suggested that, during Mark&#x27;s courteous and apologetic period of preparation for the Council of Florence, the Ephesine explicitly omitted condemnations of Aquinas by name, even if his two &quot;Antirrhetics against Manuel Kalekas&quot; contained condemnation of Thomistic Trinitarian theology, especially Thomas&#x27; implicit rejection of the essence–energies distinction and the Thomas&#x27; assertion that Aristotelean &quot;habits&quot; were very similar to the charisms or the Holy Spirit (e.g., Faith, Hope, &amp; Charity). What is more, Mark had a great love for Augustine of Hippo, spending money at Florence to buy manuscripts of the same. In fact, at Florence he copiously cites Augustinian and Ps.-Augustinian works approvingly as an authority in favor of the Eastern Orthodox position. Finally, Mark was savvy enough to understand Bernard of Clairvaux&#x27;s writings from an unknown translation (likely through his former pupil Scholarius). He used Bernard to argue for the Palamite position on the beatific vision. In effect, Mark of Ephesus&#x27; liberal use of Latin authorities paved the way for the fuller synthesis of his pupil Gennadius Scholarius after his master&#x27;s death.

Even if Mark was initially zealous for the &quot;divine work of union&quot; (τὸ θεῖον ἔργον τῆς εἰρήνης καὶ ἑνώσεως τῶν ἐκκλησιῶν) in his opening speech to Pope Eugene IV, Mark was disgusted at the Latin efforts and plots to prevent him from reading the acts of the Ecumenical Councils aloud, wherein the canons prohibited additions to the Nicene Creed. The Latins and Greeks had different opinions over what was more important to address first. That is, the addition to the creed and the orthodoxy of the filioque clause itself. Mark Eugenikos and the Greeks leaning to the former (although Bessarion of Nicaea had reservations about this and preferred to debate the dogma itself so as to avoid the Greek party becoming dispirited in the event the Latins emerge victorious in a debate over the addition to the creed) and Latins preferring a debate over the orthodoxy of the clause itself deeming that should the orthodoxy of the filioque be demonstrated, the Greeks would have no credible reason to oppose its inclusion in the creed.
At the beginning of the council, in the same opening speech, Mark noted that two issues alone were necessary to overcome the historical divisions between the Latin and Greek Churches; namely, (1.) The issue of the Filioque or Latins&#x27; assertion that the Father and the Son are conjointly a cause of the Holy Spirit, and (2.) the issue of unleavened bread, whereby the Latins were judged to have historically abandoned the orthodox (vs. Armenian) practice of using leavened bread for the sake of azymes. Because Mark found reasons to reject uniquely Latin authorities, councils, and texts unavailable in Greek or unapproved by jointly canonical synods, he became increasingly exasperated at Latin attempts to introduce a host of new authorities into the debates that turned out to be spurious. A charge he had because of the Latins frequent (although innocent) use of such documents. In the end, Mark refused to sign the council documents following a debate with John of Montenero, who claimed that there was a difference in the dignity of persons in the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. This had the effect of convincing Mark that the Thomists were subordinationists since Montenero was willing to defend a distinction in the persons according to &quot;dignity&quot; (dignitas or axiôma).

Unsurprisingly, Mark concentrated on anti-Latin propaganda by recourse to differences that were most obvious to the simple Greek populace. For example, he noted that the Latins had no throne reserved for their hierarch in the sanctuary, the Latin priests shaved their faces &quot;like women celebrating Mass,&quot; and various other minutiae. In this, Mark did not ignore various abstractions of metaphysics, yet he was more realistic and practical in his apologetics and an excellent propagandist. Therefore, one must read Mark&#x27;s post-Florentine and anti-Latin propaganda through the optic of Mark&#x27;s ends. Even if Mark dissented from Florence for traditional, theological motives he was quick to cite practical differences that emphasized the gulf between Latins and Greeks.

==Hymns==

Apolytikion (Tone 4)
:By your profession of faith, O all-praised Mark
:The Church has found you to be a zealot for truth.
:You fought for the teaching of the Fathers;
:You cast down the darkness of boastful pride.
:Intercede with Christ God to grant forgiveness to those who honor you!

Kontakion (Tone 3)
:Clothed with invincible armor, O blessed one,
:You cast down rebellious pride,
:You served as the instrument of the Comforter,
:And shone forth as the champion of Orthodoxy.
:Therefore we cry to you: &quot;Rejoice, Mark, the boast of the Orthodox!&quot;

==Quotes==

*&quot;It is impossible to recall peace without dissolving the cause of the schism— the primacy of the Pope exalting himself equal to God.&quot;
*&quot;The Latins are not only schismatics but heretics... we did not separate from them for any other reason other than the fact that they are heretics. This is precisely why we must not unite with them unless they dismiss the addition from the Creed &quot;filioque&quot; and confess the Creed as we do.&quot;
*&quot;Our Head, Christ our God... does not tolerate that the bond of love be taken from us entirely.&quot;
*&quot;We seek and we pray for our return to that time when, being united, we spoke the same things and there was no schism between us.&quot;

<text>Hans Herzog (28 October 18192 February 1894) was a Swiss army officer, and was elected Switzerland&#x27;s General during the Franco-Prussian War.

Born in Aarau, he became an artillery lieutenant in 1840, and then spent six years in travelling (visiting England among other countries), before he became a partner in his father&#x27;s business in 1846. In 1847 he saw his first active service (as artillery captain) in the short Swiss Sonderbund war.

In 1860 he abandoned mercantile pursuits for a purely military career, becoming colonel and inspector-general of the Swiss artillery. In 1870 he was commander-in-chief of the Swiss army, which guarded the Swiss border, in the Jura, during the Franco-German War, and in February 1871, as such, concluded the Convention of Verrières with General Clinchant for the disarming and the interning of the remains of Bourbaki&#x27;s army, when it took refuge in Switzerland.

In 1875, he became the commander-in-chief of the Swiss artillery, which he did much to reorganize, helping also in the reorganization of the other branches of the Swiss army. He died in 1894 in his native town of Aarau.

<text>Shmuel ha-Katan (literally &quot;Samuel the Small&quot;, or &quot;Samuel the Lesser&quot;) was a Babylonian Jew considered a great early religious scholar. He was one of the second generation of Tannaim, who served under the patriarch Gamliel II of Yavneh, during the last two decades of the 1st century CE.

He is supposed to have established some of the standard prayers of the Jewish liturgy, the Siddur. Particularly, he wrote the Birkat HaMinim benediction, the 19th blessing in the silent prayer said three times daily, the Amidah. This prayer condemns heretics, most likely the Jewish Christians.

He is said to have said &quot;do not rejoice when your enemy falls&quot;.

<text>Embassy Records was a UK budget record label that produced cover versions of current hit songs, which were sold exclusively in Woolworths shops at a lower price than the original recordings. The original label was active between 1954 and 1965, after which it disappeared when its parent company, Oriole, was taken over by CBS Records.

Later, between 1973 and 1980, CBS Records revived the Embassy imprint to release budget versions of albums in the UK and Europe by artists who were signed to its parent company, Columbia Records.

==History 1954–1965==
Embassy Records was the result of a contractual arrangement between Oriole Records and Woolworths, with Embassy&#x27;s product being sold exclusively through the latter&#x27;s stores. Between November 1954 and January 1965, Embassy released around 1,200 songs recorded by about 150 different artists and these releases were sold for half the price of a major label release of the era. The label&#x27;s releases mostly consisted of double A-side singles that were cover versions of then-current or predicted UK Top 20 hits, and it was not unusual for different artists or contrasting pop styles to appear on either side of a record. Embassy can therefore be seen as a UK equivalent of U.S. labels such as Hit and (in its early days) Bell Records.

The label&#x27;s product was recorded at the Embassy Recording Studios in New Bond Street, Mayfair, and manufactured by Oriole, who also licensed the material to many foreign outlets. The tight Embassy recording schedule required four different songs to be recorded in one three-hour session. Included in this standard three-hour session was the initial studio set-up time, before any actual songs were recorded, and a mandatory musicians&#x27; coffee break. This meant that on average there was a little over 30 minutes allowed for the recording of an individual song, which, in turn, meant that the artists who did the actual singing had to be first-rate professional singers who could enter a studio and record a song in very few takes. As a result, Embassy artists tended to be very experienced big band or session singers, who would also regularly broadcast live on BBC radio. Sometimes these musicians used their professional name when recording for Embassy, but very often they used pseudonyms. The recording sessions usually took place on a Thursday, so that the cover version discs could be rushed out into the stores by the following Monday to compete with the real thing.

As well as releasing covers of current hit singles, Embassy Records also produced EPs of trad jazz, children&#x27;s songs, light classical music, and songs from musicals.

In late 1964, Embassy&#x27;s parent label, Oriole, was taken over by CBS Records (Columbia Records in America). Following this purchase, the label was discontinued, with the final Embassy release of the 1960s being &quot;Keep Searchin&#x27; (We&#x27;ll Follow the Sun)&quot; by Paul Rich and the Beatmen (b/w &quot;The Special Years&quot; by Burt Shane) in January 1965. By this time, the concept of budget cover version releases of current hit songs had been imitated by other labels such as Cannon, Crossbow, Top Six, and Top Pops. CBS subsidiary Hallmark/Pickwick launched the &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; series of albums a few years after the demise of Embassy, but unlike Embassy&#x27;s releases, no artists were ever identified on the records.

===The artists===
The artist whose name appears on the greatest number of Embassy recordings is Paul Rich, a singer with the Lou Preager Orchestra, who recorded for Embassy between 1957 and 1965. However, the artist who actually recorded the most songs for Embassy was Ray Pilgrim. Between 1960 and 1965 he recorded almost 150 songs for the Embassy label using the pseudonyms Bobby Stevens, the Typhoons, the Jaybirds, and the Starlings.

Mike Redway, who had been a singer with the Oscar Rabin Band, recorded for Embassy under the pseudonym Redd Wayne, in addition to appearing on many of the Typhoons, Jaybirds and Starlings recordings for the label between 1962 and 1965. Redway later sang the vocal version of the &quot;Casino Royale Theme&quot; over the closing credits of the 1967 &quot;Casino Royale&quot; film. Ken Barrie, who later became the voice of Postman Pat, recorded for Embassy under the name of Les Carle.

The female singers who made the most recordings for the label were Jean Campbell, Joan Baxter, Maureen Evans and Barbara Kay, with all but the latter recording for Embassy under their own names. Maureen Evans went on to have a hit for Oriole with &quot;Like I Do&quot; and Barbara Kay was one of the members of the Carefrees, who released the novelty record &quot;We Love You Beatles&quot; in 1964. Barbara Kay, who was yet another singer who had previously been with the Oscar Rabin Band, was usually credited as Kay Barry on Embassy releases.

Instrumental recordings would feature whatever session musicians were booked for that day, so the names used for the label, such as Bud Ashton, the Beatmen and the Happy Knights, did not imply any particular participants. Similarly, the group names such as the Typhoons, the Jaybirds, and the Starlings did not imply any consistent membership and were generally made up of any musicians who were available on that particular day. Additionally, backing vocals on many Embassy releases were provided by the Mike Sammes Singers but usually went uncredited.

==History 1973–1980==
CBS Records revived the Embassy imprint in 1973, with the slogan &quot;All the Best from Embassy&quot;, to release budget albums of out of print, unissued, or foreign material in the UK and Europe, which had originally been released by Columbia Records (or its subsidiaries). Initially, 39 albums were released by the label in October, 1973, including titles by Barbra Streisand, Aretha Franklin, Tony Bennett, Sly &amp; the Family Stone, Fleetwood Mac, and Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears, among others. Many other Columbia artists had albums reissued on Embassy during the 1970s, including Johnny Mathis, the Byrds, Andy Williams, Johnny Cash, Tammy Wynette, and Spirit. CBS Records once again discontinued the Embassy imprint and ceased issuing albums in the UK and Europe in 1980. However, there are known to be some Mexican Embassy releases from much later on in the 1980s.

<text>Agualva is a civil parish in the municipality of Praia da Vitória on the island of Terceira in the Azores. The population in 2011 was 1,432, in an area of 38.75 km². The parish lies at a mean of 186 metres above sea level. It contains the localities Ladeira de Nossa Senhora, Portela, Outeiro Filipe, Outeiros, Cabouco de Trás and São Joões.
==Geography==
Agualva is the largest civil parish on the island. The church of this village, Igreja Paroquial, is dedicated to the Our Lady of Guadalupe. The feast dedicated to her is celebrated beginning on the 15th of August each year. There are some mills that have been well preserved, which give Agualva beauty and charm. In this village, there are many orchards and groves as well as an abundance of water. To the west of the village of Agualva, on the border with Quatro Ribeiras, are the twin volcanic peaks of &quot;Pico Alto&quot;, at 807 meters, and &quot;Pico Agudo&quot;, at 798 meters, some of the highest mountains on the island.

Along Agualva’s rivers, the Agualva River (&quot;Ribeira de Agualva&quot;) and its tributary the Filipe River (&quot;Ribiera de Filipe&quot;), there are 48 mills that formerly ground flour for the island&#x27;s inhabitants. Agualva is the main civil parish that supplies the municipality of Praía da Vitória with water.

Agualva’s well-irrigated and fertile land allows for large production of produce from its orchards of various fruits. Currently, the main economic activity is agro-livestock, followed by the sawing of wood thanks to the village&#x27;s large forest, metal mechanics and arboriculture.

About 200 years ago, Agualva was little more than a large orchard, with just a few houses. Back then, the produce cultivated in its orchards included chestnuts, walnuts, pears, apples, and oranges. Later on, this agricultural focus has changed, with the fields essentially being used only as pastures for dairy cows, including the cattle of Ramo Grande, which is a breed native to the Azores.

In the past, cattle goats existed in Agualva in large numbers and would destroy and harm the natural vegetation. Because of this, Captain-General Francisco António de Araújo e Azevedo forced a reduction of the goat population to a minimum.

Agualva, also known as the land of Ramo Grande cattle, possesses some of the best and flattest lands on the island. In 1643, these lands yielded between 500 and 600 “moios” of wheat as a feudal payment to the king of Portugal.

==History==
The exact date when the first inhabitants of Agualva settled in the village is unknown. It is known, however, that the settlement began sometime before the year 1588. On the 29th of February in 1588, the village of Agualva along with its parish was formally established with a documented charter. Agualva parish had previously been part of the parish of Vila Nova.

On February 3 of 1594, João Homem Guadalupe established a hermitage, which would eventually become the Church of Our Lady of Guadalupe, its name honouring the parish&#x27;s founder as well as Our Lady of Guadalupe.

A letter from Pêro Anes do Canto to the King of Portugal, dated the 16th of August 1552, refers to Agualva: &quot;Sire – I have some properties in Terceira, in places known as Aguaalva and Lajes...” It is notable that in this letter the spelling is &quot;Aguaalva,&quot; which combines the Portuguese words &quot;água&quot; (water) and a&quot;lva&quot; (clear). The original document is preserved in the Torre do Tombo, the Portuguese National Archive in Lisbon.

The village was fully operational by the end of the 16th century. This is attested by the recording of a baptism that occurred on 18 December 1607. The document shows that the parents of the girl being baptised came from the parish of Our Lady of Guadalupe.

<doc id="1332160" wikidata="Q7331495" url="?curid=1332160" title="Squantz Pond State Park">
<text>Squantz Pond State Park is a public recreation area located north of Danbury in the town of New Fairfield, Connecticut. The state park encompasses on the southwestern shore of Squantz Pond, offering opportunities for boating, swimming, fishing, and hiking. The park is bordered on the west by Pootatuck State Forest and is managed by the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection.

==History==
The state park was established through the purchase of a 138-acre farm in 1926. The pond and state park are named for Chief Squantz, a leader of the Schaghticoke tribe.

==Activities and amenities==
The park offers swimming, fishing, and scuba diving as well as a launch for motorized boating. The park also has canoe and kayak rentals, picnicking facilities, and a nature center. The park&#x27;s hiking trails grant access to the adjacent Pootatuck State Forest. 
;Trails

From the west side, the main trail starts from the north end of the picnic area; it follows the edges of the lake’s western shoreline for 2 miles to a peninsula that juts out into the lake and has an unobstructed view of the entire lake.

A green trail travels north to Worden Brook and then head southwest, passing the northern end of the yellow trail, and turns to heads eastward to the southern part of the yellow trail which continues east, back to the outgoing green trail. A shortcut can be had to shorten the green trail circular walk by taking the yellow trail south when it first appears.

An unmarked trail goes along the west shoreline of Squantz Pond; old reddish-brown markers can still be seen. The trail parallels the shoreline. It is mostly a hemlock laden area with rapidly flowing streams splashing down to the lake and interesting rock formations. A little less than half-way there, an open area and rock on which to stand offer a look back at the beach at Squantz Pond State Park. Also along the way, a red-blazed trail comes down the steep grade from Pootatuck Mountain. The trail ends near Worden Brook where a bushwhack south leads to the main trail.

==Safety issues==
From 1996, when the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection began keeping records on drownings at Connecticut state parks, through 2011, fifteen people drowned at Squantz Pond State Park.

In July 2007, DEP officials made &quot;the Rocks&quot; off limits to beachgoers. In response to the drownings and pressure from local officials, the state announced plans to reduce the parking capacity of the park from about 500 cars to about 250, and to post signs on nearby Interstate 84 announcing if the park has reached capacity. Officials said the reduced capacity would help DEP prevent swimming outside of authorized areas.

On Labor Day 2007, an 18-year-old teenager from Queens, New York City, New York, became the third drowning victim of 2007 at about 1 p.m. at East Beach, an area that was not protected by lifeguards because the state DEP believed the drowning danger to be lower than other sections of the park.

In June 2008, DEP unveiled several improvements to the park designed to improve the safety of swimmers. The designated beach swimming area was enlarged and clearly marked to make it more attractive to swimmers, trees were removed to improve the sight lines of on-duty lifeguards, and a dock was installed for a patrol boat.

The other Squantz Pond victims drowned in the areas known as &quot;the Rocks&quot; and the unroped section of &quot;Squantz Cove&quot; that are outside the designated swimming area. These areas also were not protected by lifeguards.

<text>Gavin Christopher (May 1, 1949 – March 3, 2016) was an American R&amp;B singer, songwriter, musician, and producer.

==Early life and career==
Born in Chicago, Illinois, he started out playing music at a very early age. Having been schooled by the likes of Oscar Brown Jr., Donny Hathaway, Baby Huey and later on Curtis Mayfield, he honed his writing and singing skills and began his career, first in a band called Lyfe (which also included Chaka Khan). Khan then left and joined Rufus (scoring several pop and R&amp;B hits with them). Christopher later joined another band called High Voltage with future Rufus members Bobby Watson (bassist) and Tony Maiden, as well as Lalomie Washburn, who later wrote several Rufus songs. Christopher himself would also become associated with Rufus, as he penned the song &quot;Once You Get Started&quot;, which was later recorded by the band and hit #10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1975. He also wrote three songs on Rufus&#x27; next album, &quot;Rufus featuring Chaka Khan&quot;: &quot;Dance Wit Me&quot; (another big hit), &quot;Fool&#x27;s Paradise,&quot; and &quot;Have A Good Time.&quot;

Christopher relocated to O&#x27; block, Chicago, where he was signed to his first recording contract with Island Records. He later moved back to Los Angeles, California to record and work with Curtis Mayfield on the Curtom/RSO record label. He worked with Herbie Hancock, writing and singing on several of his albums. Christopher also penned the Hancock song, &quot;Stars in Your Eyes&quot;.

Following a move to New York City, Christopher signed with EMI Manhattan Records and scored his biggest single, &quot;One Step Closer to You&quot; (his only Hot 100 hit as an artist, #22 in 1986) and another major R&amp;B hit two years later with &quot;You Are Who You Love.&quot; He also produced music for artists such as Grandmaster Flash, Afrika Bambaataa and The Ritchie Family, as well as mentored and worked with a young Mariah Carey prior to her getting her big break. He was heavily involved in the early hip-hop scene, writing such hits as &quot;Girls Love the Way He Spins&quot;, &quot;Sign of the Time&quot;, &quot;We Gonna Rock America&quot; and &quot;All Night All Right&quot;.

Gavin&#x27;s sister is dance music vocalist Shawn Christopher.

Gavin Christopher died on March 3, 2016, in Chicago of Esaughagus failure at the age of 66. He is survived by his daughter Chloe Zae Jackson.

<text>Seth Joyner (born November 18, 1964), is an American former football linebacker who played in the National Football League (NFL) for the Philadelphia Eagles, Arizona Cardinals, Green Bay Packers and Denver Broncos. Joyner graduated from Spring Valley High School and played college football for the UTEP Miners.

==Professional career==
Joyner was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in the eighth round (208th overall) of the 1986 NFL draft. He was actually cut in training camp, but the Eagles re-signed him later in the season. Joyner played in the NFL for the Philadelphia Eagles (1986–1993), Arizona Cardinals (1994–1996), Green Bay Packers (1997), and the Denver Broncos (1998). Joyner&#x27;s unique combination of strength and quickness allowed him to excel in all defensive statistical categories and propelled him to three Pro Bowl accolades; being selected in 1991, 1993, and 1994. In one &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; game in 1991 against the Houston Oilers, Joyner, playing with a 102-degree fever, recorded 8 solo tackles, 2 forced fumbles, 2 fumble recoveries and 2 sacks. He was named NFL Player of the Year by Paul Zimmerman of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; that year and received runner-up honors for Associated Press NFL Defensive Player of the Year, while a member of the Philadelphia Eagles. As a Green Bay Packer, he appeared in Super Bowl XXXII, and the next year, he won Super Bowl XXXIII as a member of the Broncos in 1998, which turned out to be his last game.

He is one of many members in the 20/20 Club for interceptions and sacks in NFL history. He is second in sacks behind Ted Hendricks (60.5) with 52.

Joyner is currently a football analyst on FS1 and on Eagles Pregame and Postgame Live on NBC Sports Philadelphia.

<doc id="1332168" wikidata="Q4295890" url="?curid=1332168" title="1966 World Series">
<text>The 1966 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball&#x27;s (MLB) 1966 season. The 63rd edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff between the American League (AL) champion Baltimore Orioles and National League (NL) champion (and defending World Series champion) Los Angeles Dodgers. The Orioles swept the series in four games to capture their first championship in franchise history. It was the last World Series played before MLB introduced the Commissioner&#x27;s Trophy the following year. The Dodgers suffered record low scoring, accumulating just two runs over the course of the series (both of which were in the first game), the lowest number of runs ever scored by any team in a World Series.

This World Series marked the end of the Dodgers&#x27; dynasty of frequent postseason appearances stretching back to 1947. Conversely, it marked the beginning of the Orioles&#x27; dynasty of frequent postseason appearances that continued until 1983.

==Background==
Despite the general consensus that the Orioles were short of pitching compared to the Dodgers and their star hurlers Don Drysdale and Sandy Koufax, Baltimore pitching allowed only two runs in the entire series and ended up with a 0.50 team earned run average (ERA), the second-lowest in World Series history. The Orioles scored more runs in the first inning of the first game than the Dodgers would score in the whole series.

The Orioles got a substantial assist from long-time scout Jim Russo, who spent the first two weeks of September following the Dodgers as they won 12 of 14 games. One of the observations in his 16-page scouting report was that Dodger batters had trouble with the fastball against Gaylord Perry and Larry Dierker. Other points included Maury Wills being the lone bunt threat; left-handed pitchers forcing switch hitters to bat right-handed and Ron Fairly out of the lineup, both to the detriment of the Dodgers; and that Orioles batters should avoid swinging at Koufax&#x27;s rising fastball above the strike zone. Frank Robinson also added suggestions based on his experiences in the National League when the team went over the scouting report a day prior to the start of the Series.

Boog Powell from the Orioles and Jim Barbieri from the Dodgers were the first players to play in the Little League World Series and the World Series. Each played against each other in Game 1 of the 1954 Little League World Series. Barbieri pinch-hit for Dodger relief pitcher Joe Moeller in Game 1 of the series. Barbieri struck out in what would be the final appearance of his brief career.

==Route to the World Series==

===Orioles===
After the 1965 season that saw the Orioles finish in third place, they acquired Hall of Famer Frank Robinson from the Cincinnati Reds in exchange for starting pitcher Milt Pappas. Robinson won the Triple Crown and A.L. MVP honors in leading the Orioles to the A.L. pennant by nine games over the Minnesota Twins.

===Dodgers===
The Dodgers were in a tight pennant race for the fourth time in five years. Going into a season ending double header in Philadelphia, the Dodgers led the San Francisco Giants by two games. The Giants were in Pittsburgh for a single game, and if they won that game and the Dodgers lost twice, the Giants would have headed to Cincinnati to play a make up game of an earlier rain-out; a win there would force a tie for first place.

In the first game of the double header, the Dodgers made two errors in the bottom of the eighth inning to turn a 3–2 win into a 4–3 loss. Meanwhile, in Pittsburgh, the Giants kept their slim hopes alive by getting a run in the ninth to tie, and four in the 11th to win, 7–3. The Dodgers needed to win the second game of the doubleheader. Sandy Koufax pitched the Dodgers to a 6–3 win to clinch the pennant (this appearance, which turned out to be Koufax&#x27; last in a regular season game, caused him not to be available for Game 1 of the World Series).

==Summary==
==Matchups==

===Game 1===

In the top of the first inning, after Russ Snyder drew a one-out walk, Frank Robinson and Brooks Robinson hit back-to-back home runs off of Don Drysdale to give the Orioles an early 3–0 lead. In the bottom half of the frame, Dave McNally walked Dodger leadoff man Maury Wills, who subsequently stole second. However, the Dodgers failed to score. In the second inning, Andy Etchebarren drew a leadoff walk, advanced to second on a sacrifice bunt by McNally, and scored on a single by Snyder to widen the lead to 4–0.

However, McNally soon began to struggle with his command. In the bottom of the second inning, second baseman Jim Lefebvre hit a long home run to make it 4-1. First baseman Wes Parker then hit a fair ball down the right-field foul line, but a fan reached over the wall and picked the ball out of the dirt, turning a possible triple into a fan interference double. After McNally walked Jim Gilliam, John Roseboro hit a fly ball to right center, but Snyder saved at least a run with a lunging catch, and Baltimore escaped the inning without further damage.

McNally wouldn&#x27;t last much longer, though, as he was taken out with one out in the bottom of the third inning after loading the bases on walks. Moe Drabowsky entered the game and struck out Parker, but then walked Gilliam, forcing in a run and making it 4-2. Drabowsky, however, got out of the jam when Roseboro popped out to Etchebarren in foul territory. This third-inning run would be the Dodgers&#x27; last run of 1966. 

From there, the Orioles controlled the rest of the game. They added an insurance run in the fourth inning against Joe Moeller (who replaced Drysdale in the third inning), when Davey Johnson scored from second on a fielder&#x27;s choice by Luis Aparicio. Meanwhile, Drabowsky struck out six consecutive batters in the next two innings, tying Hod Eller&#x27;s record from Game 5 of the scandal-tainted 1919 World Series. Drabowsky&#x27;s total of 11 strikeouts in innings of relief are a record for a relief pitcher in a World Series game. The Orioles won 5–2, and the Dodgers would not get another runner across the plate in the series.

===Game 2===

Game 2 was a matchup between two future Hall of Famers, one whose career was just beginning and the other making his final appearance. The Dodgers started left-handed ace Sandy Koufax, who was pitching in his last season but had won his third Cy Young Award in four years with 27 wins, 317 strikeouts, 5 shutouts, and his career best 1.73 ERA. The Orioles countered with 20-year-old Jim Palmer, who won 15 games with a 3.46 ERA in his first season in the starting rotation.

Despite the difference in experience, Palmer and Koufax traded zeroes on the scoreboard for four innings. Palmer got into trouble in the second inning when a double by Lou Johnson put runners on second and third with one out, but he got out of the jam by getting Roseboro to pop out to shortstop Aparicio, and then intentionally walking Parker to face Koufax, who popped out to second base. Surprisingly, Baltimore drew first blood against Koufax, although they were assisted by disastrous defense by Los Angeles center fielder Willie Davis.

Boog Powell led off with a single to left. Paul Blair then hit a routine fly ball to center, but Davis lost the ball in the sun and dropped it for an error, putting two runners on with one out. Etchebarren then hit another fly to center, but Davis, again battling the sun, bobbled the ball and then dropped it for another error. Powell scored on the misplay, while Blair attempted to advance to third base; Davis subsequently released a high, rushed throw over the head of third baseman Gilliam. The throwing error - Davis&#x27; third of the inning, a World Series record that still stands - allowed Blair to score and Etchebarren to advance to third. Aparicio then cracked a stand-up double to drive in Etchebarren. Davis was charged with three errors in this inning alone, a World Series record, and all three runs were unearned.

The O&#x27;s then earned one from Koufax in the sixth as Frank Robinson hit a triple on a fly ball that could have been caught but fell in between Davis and Ron Fairly. Powell drove him in with a single to right-center. Johnson followed with a single to right, and the runners advanced on an error by Fairly. Koufax escaped the inning after walking Blair intentionally to load the bases and getting Etchebarren to ground into a double play. Etchebarren would be the final batter that Koufax ever faced in his career.

Koufax was replaced in the seventh by Ron Perranoski, who set the Orioles down in order. They would get two from him in the eighth, however, on a walk to Frank Robinson, a single by Brooks Robinson, a sacrifice bunt from Powell and a Johnson single off of Perranoski&#x27;s glove. Perranoski threw the ball away in an attempt for an out at first, and Brooks scored on the error. 

Meanwhile, Palmer was brilliant after escaping the second inning, allowing only one runner to reach second base in the final seven frames. He completed the shutout when Roseboro popped out to Aparicio, the Orioles&#x27; shortstop; Palmer, just nine days shy of his 21st birthday, became the youngest pitcher in World Series and MLB postseason history to throw a shutout, a record that still stands. Baltimore won 6–0 to take a 2–0 Series lead.

The Dodgers became the third team to make six errors in one game. The Chicago White Sox, both in Game 5 of the 1906 World Series and in Game 5 of the 1917 World Series were the others, although oddly, the White Sox &quot;won&quot; both of these games.

===Game 3===

With the Orioles ahead in the series 2-0, the scene shifted to Baltimore&#x27;s Memorial Stadium for Game 3, the first postseason game the city has hosted in the modern era of baseball. Wally Bunker of the Orioles faced Claude Osteen of the Dodgers.

Bunker, plagued with injuries in the regular season, pitched the game of his life, scattering six hits in a complete game gem. Although Osteen allowed only three hits in seven strong innings, but one of those hits was a solo home run from Paul Blair in the fifth, which turned out to be the game&#x27;s only run. The Dodgers&#x27; defense woke up after Game 2&#x27;s six-error embarrassment, and they turned several excellent plays, most notably first baseman Wes Parker&#x27;s spectacular jump to snare Curt Blefary&#x27;s sixth inning line drive and rob him of a base hit. Nonetheless, Bunker, without a shutout in the regular season, completed the Orioles&#x27; second consecutive shutout in this World Series by retiring Lou Johnson on a grounder to Aparicio. The 1–0 win gave the Orioles a commanding 3–0 series lead, and on the cusp of their first title.

===Game 4===

On the brink of a sweep, Game 4 was a rematch of Game 1, pitting the young pitcher Dave McNally against the veteran Don Drysdale, both of whom had struggled in their previous match-up. However, in this outing, both pitchers excelled as Drysdale and McNally each allowed only four hits. Again, the only run scored was on a home run, this one by Frank Robinson. Willie Davis redeemed himself from his miserable Game 2 defensive blunders by robbing Boog Powell of a home run in the fourth, but to no avail as Paul Blair did the same to Jim Lefebvre in the eighth, and the Dodgers were shut out for the third consecutive time and for 33 consecutive innings, a World Series record. With the 1–0 Game 4 victory, the Orioles swept the series and won their first World Series championship in franchise history.

The Orioles became the first American League team other than the Yankees to win the World Series since the 1948 Cleveland Indians. The Orioles also became the last of the original eight American League teams to win a World Series at all. The Orioles had played in the Fall Classic as the St. Louis Browns in the 1944 World Series, in which they were the last original AL team, and the last of the 16 teams that made up the major leagues from 1903 to 1960, to &quot;participate&quot; in a World Series. They were also the second-to-last &quot;Original 16&quot; MLB team to win a World Series; the 1980 Philadelphia Phillies became the last team to do so 14 years later.

Ironically, despite the historic dominance of Baltimore&#x27;s starting rotation throughout the series, outfielder Frank Robinson was named World Series MVP. He became the first position player from a winning World Series team to win World Series MVP honors. (Bobby Richardson was the first position player to win the award, doing so in the 1960 World Series, but his New York Yankees lost to the Pittsburgh Pirates.)

The Orioles became the second team in World Series history (the 1937 New York Yankees were the first), not to commit an error in a series of any length, handling 141 total chances (108 putouts, 33 assists).

As of 2024, this is the only time that the Dodgers have ever been swept in a World Series.

==Composite box==
1966 World Series (4–0): Baltimore Orioles (A.L.) over Los Angeles Dodgers (N.L.)
==Broadcasting==
NBC broadcast the series on both television and radio. In prior years, the local announcers for both the home and away teams had split calling the play-by-play for the telecast of each World Series game; however, beginning this year and continuing through , only the home-team announcer would do TV for each game, splitting play-by-play and color commentary with a neutral NBC announcer, while the visiting-team announcer would help call the radio broadcast. Thus, in 1966 NBC&#x27;s Curt Gowdy (completing his first season as the network&#x27;s lead baseball voice) worked the telecasts with the Dodgers&#x27; Vin Scully for the games in Los Angeles and with the Orioles&#x27; Chuck Thompson for the games in Baltimore. Bob Prince, in turn, worked the radio broadcasts with Thompson (in Los Angeles) and Scully (in Baltimore).
The Nielsen ratings were as follows: Game 1 (23.3), Game 2 (22.8), Game 3 (23.1), and Game 4 (33.4)

==Aftermath==
This was the last hurrah for the Dodgers of this era. In an eight-year span from 1959 to 1966, they played in four World Series, winning three of them. In addition, they finished second twice (once losing in a playoff) and fourth once. Sandy Koufax, though arguably at the peak of his career, announced his retirement following the World Series because of the chronic arthritis and bursitis in his pitching elbow. In addition, shortstop and 1962 Most Valuable Player Maury Wills was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates in December. Tommy Davis, the 1962 and 1963 NL batting champion, still not fully recovered from a severely broken ankle suffered in 1965, was traded to the New York Mets after the 1966 season. Finally, third baseman/utility man Jim Gilliam announced his retirement.

The Dodgers still had decent pitching, but their offense was among the worst in the majors. They finished in eighth place in 1967 and in seventh in 1968, before a new group of young players led the team back into contention in 1969. For the 20-year period from 1969 to 1988, the Dodgers won two World Series (1981 and 1988), five National League pennants (1974, 1977, 1978, 1981, 1988), and seven National League Western Division titles (1974, 1977, 1978, 1981, 1983, 1985, 1988).

Meanwhile, Baltimore became the dominant American League team in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Injuries slowed the team down in 1967, and they finished second to the 103-win Detroit Tigers in 1968. They won three straight A.L. pennants from 1969–71 (winning over 100 games each season), as well as the 1970 World Series. The Orioles won the American League Eastern Division again in 1973 and 1974, but they fell to the Oakland Athletics dynasty, which went to (and won) the World Series three straight years. The Orioles returned to the World Series in 1979, but they lost to the Pirates in 7 games. The Orioles won at least 90 games in all but three seasons from 1968 through 1983, culminating in their 1983 World Series victory over the Phillies. In total, the Orioles won six pennants (1966, 1969, 1970, 1971, 1979, 1983) in that span to go with seven American League Eastern Division titles (1969-1971, 1973, 1974, 1979, 1983) and three World Series championships.

==Record-low scoring==

The 1966 series featured exceptionally low numbers of runs for all concerned, separately and jointly, and also set multiple records for other metrics related to low scoring.

* The series-losing Dodgers scored just 2 runs the entire series, the lowest number of runs ever scored by one team in a World Series, a record unique to 1966. The Orioles were far from productive themselves; scoring only 13 runs, they joined with the Dodgers to log the lowest combined number of runs, 15, ever scored by both teams in a World Series, another record unique to 1966.
* As for series-winning teams, just four other teams have managed to win a World Series while scoring fewer runs than the 1966 Orioles: The 1915 Boston Red Sox and 1963 Los Angeles Dodgers (12 runs each), the 1950 New York Yankees (11 runs), and the unique record holder for fewest runs scored in a World Series by the series winner, the 1918 Boston Red Sox (9 runs).
* Contributing to the series&#x27; low run count, Games 3 and 4 were both 1–0 games. The only other World Series to contain multiple 1–0 games was .
* The Orioles shut the Dodgers out for a World Series record 33 consecutive innings – from the fourth inning of Game 1 to the end of the series (Game 4).
* Baltimore&#x27;s pitching staff only allowed two earned runs and finished with a team ERA of 0.50, allowing a 4-game series low 17 hits and limiting the Dodgers to a team batting average of .142, the lowest team average in a series of any length. This topped the World Series team ERA mark of 1.00 set by the 1963 Dodgers in their 4-game sweep of the Yankees, and is second only to the unbreakable record team ERA of 0.00 set in 1905 by the New York Giants.
* The Orioles produced only 10 earned runs, including only 2 over the final 2 games. Their team batting average for the series was .200. Both teams combined to hit only .171, lowest in World Series history, and both teams combined for only 41 hits, lowest ever for a 4-game series.
* The Orioles scored more runs (3) in the first inning of Game 1 than the Dodgers did the whole series (2).

<text>The 1941 World Series, the last before the entry of the United States into the Second World War, matched the New York Yankees against the Brooklyn Dodgers, with the Yankees winning in five games to capture their fifth title in six years, and their ninth overall.

The name &quot;Subway Series&quot; arose for a World Series played between two New York City teams. The series was punctuated by the Dodgers&#x27; Mickey Owen&#x27;s dropped third strike of a sharply breaking curveball (a suspected spitball) pitched by Hugh Casey in the ninth inning of Game 4. The play led to a Yankees rally and brought them one win away from another championship.

The Yankees were back after a one-year hiatus, having won 13 of their last 14 Series games and 28 of their last 31.

This was the first Subway Series between the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Yankees (though the Yankees had already faced the crosstown New York Giants five times). These two teams would meet a total of seven times from 1941 to 1956 — the Dodgers&#x27; only victory coming in 1955 — with an additional five matchups after the Dodgers left for Los Angeles, most recently in 2024.

==Summary==

: postponed from October 3 due to rain

==Matchups==

===Game 1===

Joe Gordon&#x27;s home run in the second inning off Curt Davis put the Yankees up 1–0. In the fourth inning, Charlie Keller walked with two outs and scored on Bill Dickey&#x27;s double to extend the lead to 2–0. The Dodgers cut it to 2–1 in the fifth inning when Pee Wee Reese singled with two outs off Red Ruffing and scored on Mickey Owen&#x27;s triple. In the sixth inning, after a one-out walk and single, Gordon&#x27;s RBI single made it 3–1 Yankees. After a single and error, pinch-hitter Lew Riggs&#x27; single scored Cookie Lavagetto in the seventh inning as the Dodgers pulled to within 3–2. Then they threatened in the ninth inning with hits by Joe Medwick and Pee Wee Reese, before Ruffing was able to get Herman Franks to ground into a game-ending 4-6-3 double play.

===Game 2===

The Yankees struck first in Game 2 on Spud Chandler&#x27;s RBI single in the second with runners on second and third, but Joe Gordon was thrown out at home trying to score to end the inning. Next inning, Charlie Keller&#x27;s RBI single with two on made it 2–0 Yankees. In the fifth, the Dodgers loaded the bases off Chandler with no outs on a double and two walks when Pee Wee Reese&#x27;s sacrifice fly and Mickey Owen&#x27;s RBI single tied the game. Next inning, an error and single put two on with no outs off Chandler, then Dolph Camilli&#x27;s single off relief pitcher Johnny Murphy in the sixth put the Dodgers up 3–2. Wyatt gave up a pinch single to George Selkirk leading off the ninth, but nailed down a complete-game victory.

===Game 3===

With the veteran Freddie Fitzsimmons dueling young southpaw Marius Russo, there was no score into the top of the seventh. With two outs, Russo lined a drive off Fitzsimmons&#x27; knee that broke his kneecap. The ball caromed into Pee Wee Reese&#x27;s glove for the third out, but Fitzsimmons was forced from the game. Hugh Casey, who came out to pitch in the eighth for Brooklyn, promptly gave up four straight one-out singles, the last two of which to Joe DiMaggio and Charlie Keller scoring a run each. The Dodgers made it a one-run game in the bottom half when Dixie Walker hit a leadoff double and scored on Pee Wee Reese&#x27;s single, but Russo pitched a perfect ninth for a complete game as the Yankees won 2–1.

===Game 4===

In Game 4, the Yankees struck first in the top of the first on Charlie Keller&#x27;s RBI single with two on off Kirby Higbe. In the fourth, they loaded the bases with no outs on a double, walk and single and two outs later, Johnny Sturm&#x27;s two-run single made it 3–0 Yankees and knock Higbe out of the game. In the bottom half, Atley Donald walked two with two outs before both runners scored on Jimmy Wasdell&#x27;s double. Next inning, Pete Reiser&#x27;s two-run home run put the Dodgers up 4–3, but with two out, two strikes and no runners on base in the ninth, the Yankees rallied off Hugh Casey. First, Tommy Henrich swung and missed at a 3-2 pitch which should have ended the game, but Dodger catcher Mickey Owen failed to catch the ball. Heinrich reached first base after the ball sailed to the backstop. Owen recollected the incident:
Joe DiMaggio followed with a single and Charlie Keller hit a double to drive in Henrich and DiMaggio and take the lead. Bill Dickey would follow up with a walk and, along with Keller, score on a Joe Gordon double to make the final score 7–4. Johnny Murphy pitched two shutout innings to close the game as the Yankees were one win away from the championship.

Meyer Berger of &quot;The New York Times&quot; covered the events in &quot;Casey in the Box&quot;, a poem derived from the 1888 classic &quot;Casey at the Bat&quot;.

===Game 5===

In the fifth inning, Whit Wyatt and Joe DiMaggio almost came to blows on the mound as DiMaggio returned to the dugout after flying out. Tiny Bonham pitched a complete game four-hitter, allowing only one hit and one walk after the third inning. In the second, with runners on first and third, a wild pitch by Wyatt and RBI single by Joe Gordon made it 2–0 Yankees. Pete Reiser&#x27;s sacrifice fly in the third with two on cut it to 2–1, but the Yankees got that run back in the fifth on Tommy Henrich&#x27;s home run. The Dodgers hit only .182 as a team, contributing to their five-game loss.

1941 World Series (4–1): New York Yankees (A.L.) over Brooklyn Dodgers (N.L.)
==Aftermath==
In 1947 the Yankees and Dodgers would meet in the World Series for the second time and again play a dramatic Game 4 which was decided on a lead change with two outs in the ninth inning. That time the Dodgers would be on the winning side to tie the series but would once again end up losing it. Ironically, in the 1947 game the Dodgers’ winning pitcher was none other than Hugh Casey – the Game 4 loser in 1941 – even though he pitched to only one batter.
