<text>North Sentinel Island is one of the Andaman Islands, an Indian archipelago in the Bay of Bengal which also includes South Sentinel Island. The island is a protected area of India. It is home to the Sentinelese, an indigenous tribe in voluntary isolation who have defended, often by force, their protected isolation from the outside world. The island is about long and wide, and its area is approximately .

The Andaman and Nicobar Islands Protection of Aboriginal Tribes Regulation 1956 prohibits travel to the island and any approach closer than , in order to protect the remaining tribal community from &quot;mainland&quot; infectious diseases against which they likely have no acquired immunity. The area is patrolled by the Indian Navy. 
Nominally, the island belongs to the South Andaman administrative district, part of the Indian union territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands. In practice, Indian authorities recognise the islanders&#x27; desire to be left alone, restricting outsiders to remote monitoring (by boat and sometimes air) from a reasonably safe distance; the Government of India will not prosecute the Sentinelese for killing people in the event that an outsider ventures ashore. In 2018, the Government of India excluded 29 islands—including North Sentinel—from the Restricted Area Permit (RAP) regime, in a major effort to boost tourism. In November 2018, the government&#x27;s home ministry stated that the relaxation of the prohibition on visitations was intended to allow researchers and anthropologists (with pre-approved clearance) to finally visit the Sentinel islands.

The Sentinelese have repeatedly attacked approaching vessels, whether the boats were intentionally visiting the island or simply ran aground on the surrounding coral reef. The islanders have been observed shooting arrows at boats, as well as at low-flying helicopters. Such attacks have resulted in injury and death. In 2006, islanders killed two fishermen whose boat had drifted ashore, and in 2018 an American Christian missionary, 26-year-old John Chau, was killed after he illegally attempted to make contact with the islanders three separate times and paid local fishermen to transport him to the island.

==History==
The Onge, one of the other indigenous peoples of the Andamans, were aware of North Sentinel Island&#x27;s existence; their traditional name for the island is &quot;Chia daaKwokweyeh&quot;. They also have strong cultural similarities with what little has been remotely observed amongst the Sentinelese. However, Onges brought to North Sentinel Island by the British during the 19th century could not understand the language spoken by the North Sentinelese; as such, a significant period of separation is likely.

===British visits===
British surveyor John Ritchie observed &quot;a multitude of lights&quot; from an East India Company hydrographic survey vessel, the &quot;Diligent&quot;, as it passed by the island in 1771. Homfray, an administrator, travelled to the island in March 1867.

Towards the end of the same year&#x27;s summer monsoon season, &quot;Nineveh&quot;, an Indian merchant ship, was wrecked on a reef near the island. The 106 surviving passengers and crewmen landed on the beach in the ship&#x27;s boat and fended off attacks by the Sentinelese. They were eventually found by a Royal Navy rescue party.

==== Portman&#x27;s expeditions ====
An expedition led by Maurice Vidal Portman, a government administrator who hoped to research the natives and their customs, landed on North Sentinel Island in January 1880. The group found a network of pathways and several small, abandoned villages. After several days, six Sentinelese, an elderly couple and four children, were taken to Port Blair. The colonial officer in charge of the operation wrote that the entire group &quot;sickened rapidly, and the old man and his wife died, so the four children were sent back to their home with quantities of presents&quot;. A second landing was made by Portman on 27 August 1883 after the eruption of Krakatoa was mistaken for gunfire and interpreted as the distress signal of a ship. A search party landed on the island and left gifts before returning to Port Blair. Portman visited the island several more times between January 1885 and January 1887.

===After Indian independence===
==== Early landings ====

Indian exploratory parties under orders to establish friendly relations with the Sentinelese made brief landings on the island every few years beginning in 1967. In 1975, Leopold III of Belgium, on a tour of the Andamans, was taken by local dignitaries for an overnight cruise to the waters off North Sentinel Island.

==== Shipwrecks ====

The cargo ship MV &quot;Rusley&quot; ran aground on coastal reefs in mid-1977, and the MV &quot;Primrose&quot; did so on 2 August 1981. After the &quot;Primrose&quot; grounded on the North Sentinel Island reef, crewmen several days later noticed that some men carrying spears and arrows were building boats on the beach. The captain of &quot;Primrose&quot; radioed for an urgent drop of firearms so his crew could defend themselves. They did not receive any because a large storm stopped other ships from reaching them, but the heavy seas also prevented the islanders from approaching the ship. A week later, the crewmen were rescued by a helicopter under contract to the Indian Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC).

The Sentinelese are known to have scavenged both shipwrecks for iron. Settlers from Port Blair also visited the sites to recover the cargo. In 1991, salvage operators were authorised to dismantle the ships.

==== First peaceful contact ====

The first peaceful contact with the Sentinelese was made by Triloknath Pandit, a director of the Anthropological Survey of India (AnSI), and his colleagues on 4 January 1991. Although Pandit and his colleagues were able to make repeated friendly contact, dropping coconuts and other gifts to the Sentinelese, no progress was made in understanding the Sentinelese language, and the Sentinelese repeatedly warned them off if they stayed too long. Indian visits to the island ceased in 1997.

==== Indian Ocean earthquake and later hostile contact ====

The Sentinelese survived the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and its after-effects, including the tsunami and the uplifting of the island. Three days after the earthquake, an Indian government helicopter observed several islanders, who shot arrows and threw spears and stones at the helicopter. Although the tsunami disturbed the tribal fishing grounds, the Sentinelese appear to have adapted.

In January 2006, two Indian fishermen, Sunder Raj and Pandit Tiwari, were fishing illegally in prohibited waters and were killed by the Sentinelese when their boat drifted too close to the island. There were no prosecutions.

In November 2018, a 26-year old American Christian missionary named John Allen Chau, who was trained and sent by Missouri-based All Nations, was killed during an illegal trip to the restricted island where he planned to preach Christianity to the Sentinelese. The 2023 documentary film &quot;The Mission&quot; discusses the incident. Seven individuals were taken into custody by Indian police on suspicion of abetting Chau&#x27;s illegal access to the island. Entering a radius of around the island is illegal under Indian law. The fishermen who illegally ferried Chau to North Sentinel said they saw tribesmen drag his body along a beach and bury it. Despite efforts by Indian authorities, which involved a tense encounter with the tribe, Chau&#x27;s body was not recovered. Indian officials made several attempts to recover the body but eventually abandoned those efforts. An anthropologist involved in the case told &quot;The Guardian&quot; that the risk of a dangerous clash between investigators and the islanders was too great to justify any further attempts.

==Geography==
North Sentinel lies west of the village of Wandoor in South Andaman Island, west of Port Blair, and north of its counterpart South Sentinel Island. It has an area of about and a roughly square outline.

North Sentinel is surrounded by coral reefs, and lacks natural harbours. The entire island, other than the shore, is forested. There is a narrow, white-sand beach encircling the island, behind which the ground rises , and then gradually to between near the centre. Reefs extend around the island to between from the shore. A forested islet, Constance Island, also &quot;Constance Islet&quot;, is located about off the southeast coastline, at the edge of the reef.

The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake tilted the tectonic plate under the island, lifting it by . Large tracts of the surrounding coral reefs were exposed and became permanently dry land or shallow lagoons, extending all the island&#x27;s boundaries – by as much as on the west and south sides – and uniting Constance Islet with the main island.

== Flora and fauna ==
The island is largely covered in tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forest. Due to the lack of surveys, the exact composition of the terrestrial flora and fauna remains unknown. In his 1880 expedition to the island, Maurice Vidal Portman reported an open, &quot;park-like&quot; jungle with numerous groves of bulletwood (&quot;Manilkara littoralis&quot;) trees, as well as huge, buttressed specimens of Malabar silk-cotton tree (&quot;Bombax ceiba&quot;)&quot;.&quot; Indian boar (&quot;Sus scrofa cristatus&quot;) are apparently found on the island. The boar are a major food source for the Sentinelese, with reports by Portman referring to a &quot;huge heap&quot; of pig skulls near a Sentinelese village. The IUCN Red List lists North Sentinel as being an important habitat for coconut crabs (&quot;Birgus latro&quot;), which have been otherwise extirpated from most of the other Andaman Islands except from South Sentinel and Little Andaman. North Sentinel Island, along with South Sentinel, is also considered a globally Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International, as despite the lack of surveys, the pristine habitat likely supports a diversity of birdlife.

The marine life surrounding the island has also not been well surveyed. A large coral reef is known to circle the island, and mangroves are also known to fringe its banks. A report from divers near the island indicated that the reefs around the island were bleached in the 1998 El Niño, but had since seen new growth of coral. Sharks have allegedly also been seen in the waters off the island. Sea turtles likely also occur near the island, as Portman referred to them also being a major food source for the Sentinelese and one was sighted on a 1999 survey of the surrounding waters. Dolphins were also sighted on the same survey.

==Demographics==
North Sentinel Island is inhabited by the Sentinelese, indigenous people who defend their voluntary isolation by force. Their population was estimated to be between 50 and 400 people in a 2012 report. India&#x27;s 2011 census indicates 15 residents in 10 households, but that too was merely an estimate, described as a &quot;wild guess&quot; by &quot;The Times of India&quot;.

Like the Jarawas whose numbers have been decreasing, the Sentinelese population would face the potential threats of infectious diseases to which they have no immunity, as well as violence from intruders. The Indian government has declared the entire island and its surrounding waters extending from the island to be an exclusion zone to protect them from outside interference.

==Political status==

The Andaman and Nicobar (Protection of Aboriginal Tribes) Regulation, 1956 provides protection to the Sentinelese and other native tribes in the region. The Andaman and Nicobar Administration stated in 2005 that they have no intention to interfere with the lifestyle or habitat of the Sentinelese and are not interested in pursuing any further contact with them or governing the island. Although North Sentinel Island is not legally an autonomous administrative division of India, scholars have referred to it and its people as effectively autonomous, or de-facto sovereign.

<doc id="1333519" wikidata="Q658197" url="?curid=1333519" title="Greater Poland Uprising (1846)">
<text>The Greater Poland Uprising () was a planned military insurrection by Poles in the land of Greater Poland against the Prussian forces, designed to be part of a general Polish uprising in all three partitions of Poland, against the Russians, Austrians and Prussians.

== Plans ==
Plans to start an uprising across all parts of the partitioned Poland simultaneously on 21 February 1846 were made by several Polish organisations. In the Prussian Grand Duchy of Posen, Ludwik Mierosławski, who had recently arrived in Poznań out of French exile, was supposed to lead the military operations.
While the Kraków Uprising in the Austrian partition was started but failed, the insurgents in Poznań were betrayed by a conspirator and the leaders of the organization were arrested by Prussian authorities two weeks before actions were supposed to start.

No serious hostilities occurred that year.

== Aftermath ==
254 insurgents were charged with high treason at the Berlin Kammergericht. The trial was the first one after a new criminal trial law was invented in Prussia. The hearing was now publicly accessible and caused a large interest among the populace of Berlin and Prussia in sympathy with the defendants.
The trial ended on 2 December 1847, when 134 of the defendants were acquitted and returned to the Grand Duchy of Posen. 8 defendants, including Mierosławski, who had written his book &quot;Débat en la révolution et la contrerévolution en Pologne&quot; throughout his custody, were sentenced to death, the rest to prison in the Berlin-Moabit prison. The death sentences were not enforced and all convicts were amnestied by King Frederick William IV of Prussia on the demand of the revolutionary populace of Berlin in the Spring of Nations in March 1848. They immediately joined the Greater Poland Uprising of 1848.

== Famous insurgents ==
* Karol Libelt (1807–1875)
* Ludwik Mierosławski (1814–1878)
* Władysław Niegolewski (1819–1885) was a Polish liberal politician and member of parliament, an insurgent in the 1846 Wielkopolska Uprising, the 1848 Wielkopolska Uprising and the 1863 Uprising, and a cofounder (1861) of the Central Economic Society (&quot;TCL&quot;) and (1880) of the People&#x27;s Libraries Society (&quot;CTG&quot;).
* Edmund Taczanowski (1822–1879) was a Prussian-Polish general, noble and Lord of Choryn who led a revolt in 1843 and participated in the 1846 Wielkopolska Uprising. He later served with Giuseppe Garibaldi in the Italian Risorgimento.
* Włodzimierz Krzyżanowski (1824–1887) was an important brigade commander during the American Civil War.

<doc id="1333526" wikidata="Q2915406" url="?curid=1333526" title="Broadway Boogie Woogie">
<text>Broadway Boogie Woogie is a painting by Piet Mondrian completed in 1943, after he had moved to New York in 1940. Compared to his earlier work, the canvas is divided into many more squares. Although he spent most of his career creating abstract work, this painting is inspired by clear real-world examples: the city grid of Manhattan, and boogie-woogie, an African-American Blues music Mondrian loved. The painting was bought by the Brazilian sculptor Maria Martins for $800 at the Valentine Gallery in New York City, after Martins and Mondrian both exhibited there in 1943. Martins later donated the painting to the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.

== Analysis ==
When Piet Mondrian arrived in New York he became fond of the neat, rigid architecture. He integrated the mood and tone of jazz into this work. Mondrian called it the “destruction of natural appearance; and construction through continuous opposition of pure means - dynamic rhythm.”

<text>Gytha of Wessex (born c. 1053/1061 – died 1098 or 1107; ) was one of several daughters of Harold Godwinson, the last Anglo-Saxon king of England, and his consort, Edith the Fair. Through marriage to Vladimir II Monomakh, Gytha became the princess of Smolensk (1073—1078), the princess of Chernigov (1078—1094), the princess of Pereyaslavl (1094—1098 or 1107).

==Life==
Her paternal grandparents were Godwin, Earl of Wessex and Gytha Thorkelsdóttir.

According to the 13th-century chronicler Saxo Grammaticus, after the death of their father King Harold at the Battle of Hastings in 1066, Gytha and two of her brothers (probably Magnus and either Godwin or Edmund) escaped to the court of their first cousin once-removed, King Sweyn Estridsson of Denmark. The two brothers were treated by Sweyn with hospitality, Magnus entering into high-level service with Bolesław II the Generous while Gytha was married to Vladimir II Monomakh, the grand prince of Kiev. This took place in 1069/1070 when Bolesław restored Iziaslav I of Kiev as grand prince, and Gertruda (Bolesław&#x27;s aunt) to power after they had been deposed. Gytha&#x27;s role in Vladimir&#x27;s rule is not documented. Vladimir explained in a book of &#x27;Instructions&#x27; (&quot;Pouchenie&quot;) for his sons, written in the twelfth-century: “Love your wives, but grant them no power over you.” In his book, Vladimir also mentioned the recent death of Yuri&#x27;s mother.

Gytha was the mother of Mstislav the Great, the last ruler of the united Kievan Rus&#x27;. In the Norse sagas, Mstislav is called Harald, after his grandfather.
During her lifetime Gytha, as Vladimir&#x27;s spouse, was princess of Smolensk; however, she died before her husband became grand prince of Kiev in 1113, so she never was grand princess of Kiev.

==Children==
With Vladimir, Gytha had several children, including:
#Mstislav the Great (1076–1132)
#Izyaslav Vladimirovich, Prince of Kursk († 6 September 1096)
#Svyatoslav Vladimirovich, Prince of Smolensk and Pereyaslav († 16 March 1114)
#Yaropolk II of Kiev († 18 February 1139)
#Viacheslav I of Kiev († 2 February 1154)

==Death date==
There is a problem with establishing Gytha&#x27;s date of death. It is placed between 1098 and 1107.
The patericon of St Pantaleon Cloister in Cologne says that &quot;Gytha the Queen&quot; (&quot;Gida regina&quot;) died as a nun on 10 March. The year is presumed to be 1098.

According to the &quot;Testament of Vladimir Monomakh&quot; Yuri Dolgorukiy&#x27;s mother died on 7 May 1107. If Gytha died in 1098 then Yuri could have been a son of his father&#x27;s second wife Yefimia (whom Vladimir Monomakh in this case supposedly married c.1099). However, it means there are no mentions in Vladimir Monomakh&#x27;s works of Gytha&#x27;s death, despite her being his first wife. Yuri&#x27;s birth then falls to c. 1099/1100. However, the Primary Chronicle records the first marriage of Yuri - on 12 January 1108. It means that Yuri was born before c.1099/1100 (as he could not have been 6–9 years old at the time of marriage). Then it means that Gytha could have been Yuri&#x27;s mother and died in 1107.

==Legacy==
According to Russian politician and historian Vladimir Medinsky, Gytha was a significant influence on Monomakh&#x27;s public relations: &quot;Knyaz&#x27;s English wife wasn&#x27;t wasted&quot;. As a source, Medinsky quotes M. P. Akekseev&#x27;s comparative analysis between Monomakh writings&#x27; and Alfred the Great&#x27;s, and other anonymous then contemporary Anglo-Saxon texts.

Through her son Mstislav the Great she was an ancestor of both Philippa of Hainault and King Edward III of England, hence of all subsequent English and United Kingdom monarchs. Through Mstislav, she was also an ancestor of Alexander Nevsky and subsequently ancestor of the first Tsar of Russia, Ivan IV the Terrible.

<text>Eric Axel Hermelin, Baron Hermelin (June 22, 1860 – November 8, 1944) was a Swedish author and prolific translator of Persian works of literature.

==Biography==
Hermelin was born into an aristocratic family in Svanshals, Ödeshög Municipality, Östergötland County and had a traditional education, at the end of which he spent a couple of years at the Philosophical Faculty of the University of Uppsala, which he left without taking a degree. Already at this stage he seems to have developed a taste for alcohol, which later became an addiction, with drastic lifelong consequences. After an unsuccessful attempt at farming on a family estate, he began a wandering life abroad. In 1883 he went to the United States and eked out a living as a teacher, a carpenter, and a soldier, before returning to Europe in 1885. In 1886, he traveled to England and joined the British army as a soldier in the Middlesex Regiment (under the name of Thomas Edward Hallan). He went with his regiment to India in the following year. However, his army career in India proved a failure. He was much troubled by disease, and by then his drinking had developed into full-blown alcoholism, possibly in combination with the use of narcotic drugs. Nevertheless, he spent time on language studies, obviously in preparation for one of the language examinations that formed part of the British administrative system in India. He states that he learnt Hindustani (i.e., Urdu) and also started to learn Persian. There is, however, no record showing that he had passed any examination in these subjects. In later years he occasionally referred to his Indian &quot;Monshi,&quot; and it is also likely that he had his first encounters with Sufism at that time. In April 1893 he was finally discharged from the army &quot;with ignominy,&quot; i.e., for disciplinary reasons. After that he became an even more intrepid traveler, going to England and America (including Jamaica) and then back to Sweden, where he again tried his hand at farming. His aristocratic family found his alcoholism and disorderly life unacceptable and had him declared officially unfit to manage his life, and in 1897 he was placed under the care of a guardian. Regardless of this injunction, he went abroad again and lived in Australia and, possibly, America, earning a living through sundry occupations. He turned up in London in the autumn of 1907 and returned to Sweden in early 1908. In the autumn of the same year he was taken into a lunatic asylum in Stockholm, and in February 1909 he was moved to the asylum of St. Lars in Lund, where he spent the rest of his life. He never married.

==Writing works==
There is no concrete evidence of any literary production from his years of travel, but he turned to reading and writing when he was confined to the asylum in Lund. He began as a conservative and patriotic writer of verses, commentaries, and translations in local daily newspapers; but through his reading of, among others, the English socialist Robert Blatchford, he gradually adopted a more liberal and even radical attitude. Soon he was attracted by mysticism, first of all by Emanuel Swedenborg, whose works he started to translate. Then he turned to the Christian quietism and mysticism of Jakob Böhme, who remained one of his main inspirations. In this context he resumed his Persian studies and also started to learn Hebrew. Against all odds, with repeated lapses into alcoholism and deep depressions, he began a new career as an author and translator. His first publication (Uppsala, 1913) was a Swedish translation of an English work by Alexander Whyte on Jakob Böhme. In 1918 two volumes of translations from works by Böhme appeared in print, and the same year saw his first publication of a Swedish translation from Persian, the &quot;Bustan&quot; of Sa&#x27;di, possibly first encountered by him when he was preparing for his Persian examination in India some thirty years earlier. It was the first in a long series of Persian translations of classical Persian literature by his hand.

In the period 1918-43 he published no less than 23 volumes, altogether more than 8000 pages, of such translations. After the &quot;Golestan&quot; came an anthology of robaiyyat and mathnawiyyat, then Shabestari&#x27;s &quot;Golshan-e raz&quot;, the &quot;Robaiyyyat&quot; of Khayyam, an abridged version of Sana&#x27;i&#x27;s &quot;Hadiqat al Haqiqa&quot; and the &quot;Anwar-e sohayli&quot; of Wa&#x27;ez Kashefi. However, the greatest achievement of Hermelin was his translation of works by Farid al-din &#x27;Attar and Jalal-al-Din Rumi. Both Farid al-din &#x27;Attar&#x27;s &quot;Pand-nama&quot; and his &quot;Manteq al-tayr&quot; appeared in print in 1929, his &quot;Tazkerat al-awlia&quot; in four volumes in 1931-43, and the &quot;Masnawi&quot; of Jalal al-Din Rumi in six volumes in 1933-39. In between he also published translations of excerpts from the &quot;Shah-nama&quot; and the full texts of the &quot;Kalila o Demna&quot; and Nizami&#x27;s &quot;Eskandar-nama&quot;.

Thanks to Hermelin&#x27;s prodigious output, there were already in the 1940s more translations of classical Persian literature available in Swedish than in most other European languages. The impact of these translations was, however, fairly limited. As a patient in a lunatic asylum, he remained a marginal figure, and most of his translations were printed privately, paid for by the family. Furthermore, he had an old-fashioned, and at times even odd and idiosyncratic, style in Swedish. He made liberal use of capitals for emphasis and excelled in some quasi-etymological erroneous conjectures (such as substituting &#x27;Omr (&quot;life&quot;) for &#x27;Omar Khayyam). On the whole however, his translations are reliable and exact, only occasionally misinterpreting phraseology not easily found in the standard works of reference available to him (Salemann-Zhukovski&#x27;s &quot;Grammar&quot; and Francis Joseph Steingass&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary&quot;, etc.). At times his style acquires a strong and original, even prophetic, ring that made it especially attractive to poets and writers, such as Vilhelm Ekelund, Hjalmar Gullberg and Gunnar Ekelöf. Similarly, the very personal kind of mysticism that he developed through the years has had more impact as a literary model than as an exegesis of Sufism. His work strikes a grandiose but solitary chord in Swedish writing and Persian scholarship of the 20th century.

In 1943 Eric Hermelin received the Imperial Order of the Lion and the Sun from Masud Ansari, the representative of the Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, in Stockholm.
==Film about Eric Hermelin==
In 2018 Swedish Television program &quot;K Special&quot; broadcast a one hour film on Eric Hermelin by the Swedish-Iranian film director Ali Boriri. The film entitled &quot;Sufismen och Eric Hermelin&quot; explores Hermelin&#x27;s biography, translations of Persian literature as well as his views on literature, religion and politics, and contains interviews with Carl-Göran Ekerwald, Ashk Dahlén, Johan Hermelin och Marika Lagercrantz.

<doc id="1333566" wikidata="Q82838" url="?curid=1333566" title="Freudenstadt">
<text>Freudenstadt (, Swabian: &quot;Fraidestadt&quot;) is a town in Baden-Württemberg in southern Germany. It is the capital of the district Freudenstadt. The closest population centres are Offenburg to the west (approx. 36 km away) and Tübingen to the east (approx. 47 km away).

The city lies on a high plateau at the east edge of the north Black Forest, and is well known for its fresh air. Its city centre is famous as the largest market place in Germany. After Horb, it is the second largest city of the Freudenstadt district. The city has an administration partnership with the communities Bad Rippoldsau-Schapbach and Seewald.

Freudenstadt is a climatic health resort of international renown. In the 19th and 20th centuries, visitors of note included George V of the United Kingdom, the Queen of Sweden, John D. Rockefeller, and the American writer Mark Twain. With its many hotels and guest houses, and its high-class cuisine, Freudenstadt remains a popular vacation spot for Germans from every part of the country. Among the many Germans of note who considered Freudenstadt a second home was the justice inspector Friedrich Kellner whose WWII diary is the subject of a Canadian documentary.

== History ==

Since 1535 a monastery church existed in Kniebis. 
The building of Freudenstadt was ordered by Frederick of Württemberg in 1599 with the initial population largely being made up of many of the 11,000 Protestants who left the Inner Austrian provinces by force or through self-exile beginning in 1598. The designer was architect Heinrich Schickhardt.
In 1799 the monastery in Kniebis was burned down by the French. Because of the Württemberg foundation, Freudenstadt was almost entirely Protestant for a long time. The young church belonged to the dean&#x27;s office as well as the church district Herrenberg within the Evangelical-Lutheran Church in Württemberg.

===Third Reich and World War II===

In World War II, on the nearly 1,000 meter high Kniebis, not far from the Alexanderschanze, a Command Center of the Armed Forces was built to defend the Western Front: the Führer&#x27;s headquarters Tannenberg. Heavy anti-aircraft warfare positions with the associated supply and accommodation buildings were built in the area as part of the LVZ West (Western Air Defense Zone), especially on the Schliffkopf and the Hornisgrinde. In the Freudenstadt hospital many wounded were treated. Hitler&#x27;s one-week visit to Tannenberg and Freudenstadt in 1940 (after the French campaign) at the inauguration of the headquarters was for propaganda, which was reported in newsreels. Thus, Freudenstadt including the nearby region in France, became a symbol of the Nazi regime and the French defeat, which in 1945 was to play an important role.

On 16 April 1945, three weeks before the war ended, the city was unexpectedly attacked by the troops of the 1st French army under General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny. There was large-scale destruction caused by bombing and shelling. Freudenstadt fell, with interruptions, for about 16 hours under artillery fire. No residents dared to go to meet the French troops to surrender the city, conversely the French troops expected considerable military resistance.

Since the water main line had been destroyed by US air strikes and the fire engines had been destroyed by shelling, fire spread easily.
A handover took place only when French troops reached the town hall. There were several dozen civilian casualties; about 600 buildings, 95 percent of the town, were destroyed directly or indirectly during the night from 16 to 17 April and 1,400 families were made homeless. Over the next three days, during the occupation by French troops, there were many violent attacks by soldiers of the Moroccan units. According to a doctor, Renate Lutz, she alone treated over 600 raped women. According to witnesses, when the townsfolk complained, they were told it was war and that Freudenstadt had to burn for three days.

Many of the remaining buildings were then occupied by French troops. Many families lived in makeshift-roofed cellars. Overall, the average living space per inhabitant was reduced to less than eight square metres. The need was great, and the cleanup of the debris was initially slow.

== Municipal subdivisions ==
The borough of Freudenstadt is divided into the town of Freudenstadt with Christophstal and Zwieselberg (together 16,159 inhabitants) and the outlying districts of Dietersweiler and Lauterbad (2,256), Grüntal and Frutenhof (1,027), Igelsberg (254), Kniebis (947), Musbach (761) and Wittlensweiler (2,186). These are further divided into villages, hamlets, farms and individual houses.

==Climate==
==Main sights==
The market place, flanked by arcaded houses, is the largest market place in Germany. The Rathaus (Town Hall), at the market place, houses the museum of local history.

On the south side of the market place is the Evangelical Lutheran Church, with its green tower roofs. It was built between 1601 and 1608, and is considered the most significant building of Freudenstadt. It was built in the Gothic/Renaissance style.

The Friedrichsturm (Frederick&#x27;s Tower) is a 25m high tower which is built 799m above sea level on the Kienberg. It was built of red sandstone from the northern Black Forest in 1899 for the 300 year anniversary of Freudenstadt. On days with a clear sky it offers a view over the whole Murg valley, a view over Dornstetten and Schopfloch.

==Cultural and social life==
The following social institutions are present: The children&#x27;s and youth workshop EIGEN-SINN aims to promote personal, social and academic skills of children and adolescents in social group work. The Erlacher Höhe is committed to ensure that people will have respect and value in social need and to reduce social exclusion. The Diakonisches Werk works for the poor, marginalized and disadvantaged. In children&#x27;s center Freudenstadt (KiJuz) open child and youth work is offered for primary school children and adolescents. The Catholic young community (KJG) Freudenstadt is involved in child and youth work.
Regional daily newspapers are the Schwarzwälder Bote and the Neckar Chronik of the Südwest Presse.

==Economics==
The value added comes in 2006 from the service sector (54,2%), the manufacturing industry (45,0%) and from agriculture (0,8%). 2007 were in the urban area 2,832 guest beds available. The number of overnight stays was 339,292.

The manufacturing sector is located mainly in the industrial areas. Particularly significant are the Gebrüder Schmid (photovoltaic, printed circuit boards, flat panel displays), the Robert Bürkle (equipment for surface finishing), the company Georg Oest mineral (mineral oil, gas stations, mechanical engineering).

==Roads==
Due to the central location in the Black Forest, four federal roads lead through Freudenstadt. At the market place the B 28 (Kehl-Ulm) meets the B 462 (Rastatt-Rottweil). Here ends also the B 500 (Baden-Baden-Freudenstadt).
Since 1985, the B 294 from Bretten to Gundelfingen bypasses Freudenstadt in a north–south direction.

==Bus and train==
Freudenstadt is the starting point of three railway lines.
In 1879 construction of the Eutingen im Gäu–Freudenstadt railway connected the city to the railway network. It runs from Stuttgart over Herrenberg and Eutingen im Gäu to Freudenstadt. Because continuation into the Kinzig valley was already planned (and as part of the Kinzig Valley Railway was carried out in 1886), the main station was built southeast of the city, relatively far from the center. In 1901 the Württemberg part of the Murg Valley Railway to Klosterreichenbach was built. The 60-meter higher Stadtbahnhof north of the center is a Standardized railway station. In 1928, a direct connection to Rastatt (Baden) was established.

Eutingen and Stuttgart are connected with the Gäubahn. There is a rail service every hour with consolidations in school transport. Since 2006, coming from Karlsruhe, S41 goes every two hours about Freudenstadt up to Eutingen where is connection to the Regional Express (RE) Stuttgart-Singen.

The connection to Offenburg is via the Kinzig Valley Railway. The trains of the Ortenau-S-Bahn (OSB), connect Freudenstadt hourly over Alpirsbach, Schiltach and Hausach to Offenburg. The central bus station (ZOB) with more than 40 bus lines is a main transport hub in the Black Forest. City buses run to destinations in the urban core. Public transport to towns in neighboring districts, such as to Oberndorf, Wolfach, Altensteig or Dornhahn. On the nights of Saturdays, Sundays and holidays an overnight bus service completes the night rail service.

==Administration==
Freudenstadt is home of the Amtsgericht, which belongs to the court Rottweil and the superior court Stuttgart. It is the seat of the district office of the homonymous district and home to the majority of its administrative authorities. There is also a notary and a tax office.
It is the seat of the church district Freudenstadt of the Evangelical-Lutheran Church in Württemberg.

==Education==
The schools sponsored by the city are on the one hand the Kepler-Gymnasium and the Kepler secondary school. Southeast towards the central station is the Falken-Realschule, not far away from the Hartranft Elementary School. The Theodor-Gerhard-primary school with integrated Werkrealschule as a second primary school of the main town is located opposite to the Kepler schools. 
Among the schools sponsored by the district are the Eduard-Spranger-School, a business school with an economic high school, the Heinrich-Schickhardt school as industrial and technical school with a technical high school and Luise Büchner School as domestic school with a nutritional scientific school. The Christopher&#x27;s School, a special school, is found north the building yard.

<text>Ambikapur is a city and headquarters of Surguja district in the Indian state of Chhattisgarh. It is one of the oldest cities in the state, in east-central India. Ambikapur is also the divisional headquarters of Surguja Division which consists of the six districts of Surguja, Korea, Manendragarh, Balrampur, Surajpur and Jashpur.

Ambikapur was the capital of the Princely state of Surguja before Indian Independence. The name of the city is derived from the Hindu goddess Ambika (Mahamaya) Devi, who is the central figure of worship for the Hindus in the area. The area under Ambikapur Municipal Corporation is 35.360 km2.

A further 11.44% of the land could be brought under cultivation by improvements in farming techniques and reclamation of marginal areas . A further 1.27% is barren and uncultivated while 33.09% is forest cover and 6.83% is covered by buildings, roads and other infrastructure.

<text>Heidenheim an der Brenz, or just Heidenheim (; Swabian: &quot;Hoidna&quot; or &quot;Hoirna&quot;), is a town in Baden-Württemberg in southern Germany. It is located near the border with Bavaria, approximately 17 km south of Aalen and 33 km north of Ulm. Heidenheim is the largest town and the seat of the district of Heidenheim, and ranks third behind Aalen and Schwäbisch Gmünd in size among the towns in the region of East Württemberg. Heidenheim is the economic center for all the communities in Heidenheim district and is the headquarters of the Voith industrial company. The town&#x27;s population in 2021 was just below the 50,000 mark. Heidenheim collaborates with the town of Nattheim in administrative matters.

The residents of Heidenheim and its surrounding area speak the distinct German dialect of Swabian.

==Geography==
Heidenheim is situated between Albuch and the Härtsfeld region in the northeast corner of the Swabian Alb where the valley of the Brenz meets the Stubental at the foot of Hellenstein Mountain. The source of the Brenz is located in Königsbronn and enters Heidenheim from the northwest. It runs through the boroughs of Aufhausen and Schnaitheim before it gets to Heidenheim (proper). From there it continues on to the south through the borough of Mergelstetten, before it leaves the city limits to head for Herbrechtingen.

===Neighbouring municipalities===
Heidenheim shares borders with the following cities and towns, listed clockwise starting from the North: Aalen and Neresheim (both in Ostalb County), Nattheim (Heidenheim County), Syrgenstein (Dillingen County, Bavaria), as well as Herbrechtingen, Steinheim am Albuch and Königsbronn (all in Heidenheim County).

===Subdivisions===
Heidenheim an der Brenz consists of Heidenheim (proper) and the subdivisions (boroughs) of Schnaitheim, Mergelstetten, Oggenhausen and Großkuchen (annexed between 1910 and 1974).

Each of the four boroughs includes their own neighbourhoods that either have a long history of their own or were created as new developments. But while these neighbourhoods received their names during construction, their boundaries have not been officially defined.

Oggenhausen and Großkuchen became part of Heidenheim during the last district reform in the 1970s and are also municipalities under state administrative law. This designation entitles them to a borough council, elected by registered voters in municipal elections. The Municipal Council is headed by a president.

====Schnaitheim====
Schnaitheim, to the north, was at one time a politically independent small town but is now Heidenheim&#x27;s largest borough, officially known as Heidenheim-Schnaitheim. Expansion of both towns has now eradicated any geographical separation between the two. Although largely residential, Schnaitheim is home to a number of Heidenheim&#x27;s &quot;Big Box&quot;-style retailers, and its commercial districts are an important part of the city&#x27;s infrastructure. It has about 10,900 residents.

Within Schnaitheim, neighbourhoods include Wehrenfeld on the east side, which consists largely of wealthier homes as well as a large recreational area featuring the town&#x27;s largest sports club, TSG Schnaitheim. Other neighbourhoods include Hagen on the west side, located on the slope of a hill and Aufhausen, once a separate farming village to the north but now amalgamated.

====Mergelstetten====
Mergelstetten is located to the south of Heidenheim center, as it heads towards Herbrechtingen. With about 7900 residents, Mergelstetten is home to a number of factories, but retains a rural feel. Within Mergelstetten, the residential area of Reutenen sits elevated on a hill.

====Oggenhausen====
About 5 kilometers to the east of Heidenheim, separated by the major road European route E43, the village of Oggenhausen is home to about 1550 residents. The town voted to merge into Heidenheim by popular vote in 1970.

====Großkuchen====
About 8 kilometres north-east of Heidenheim, the geographically separate Großkuchen is a popular recreational area with hiking trails and cross-country skiing. It is also home to a small-scale local charcoal industry. The town has about 1550 residents and merged politically with Heidenheim in 1974.

===Climate===
==History==
There is evidence that human life existed within the city limits of Heidenheim as far back as 8,000 years ago. However, a permanent settlement was not established until approximately 1300 BC. Extensive ruins remain of settlements dating, predominantly, to the period from 1200 to 800 BC.

At the time of the Roman Empire from about 85 AD onwards, Heidenheim was the location of Castle &quot;Aquileia&quot; with attached cavalry of more than 1,000 mounted soldiers. The unit, called &quot;ala II flavia milliaria&quot; was later, around 159 AD, moved further North to Aalen. At first, the castle marked the Eastern end of the Alb Limes. But it did not take long until a civilian settlement was founded at this strategically important spot, marked by the intersection of five Roman roads. This settlement was the largest Roman city in what is today Baden-Württemberg and archeological finds suggest that it covered an area of approximately 37 - (15 - 20 hectares). More recently, excavations have found the remains of a representative Roman administrative building. Its exact function was not fully understood as of May 2005, but given &quot;Aquileia&quot;″s size, location and other indicators, it is believed that it was probably the capital of a Roman administrative district (see also Civitas). From 233 on, the Alamanni repeatedly attacked the Roman limes fortifications. The Roman surrender of the limes in 260 spelled the end of the Roman city of Heidenheim. It is not clear to what extent Romans stayed on under the new Alammanic rule but it is very likely that some remained.

Nothing is known about Aquileia/Heidenheim during the period of the Great Migration. However, in the 8th century Heidenheim was mentioned (again) for the first time in official documents. The creation of the city in the Middle Ages went hand in hand with the construction of Hellenstein Castle. The city wall was built in segments in 1190 and 1420 and Emperor Charles IV granted or confirmed the city&#x27;s status as a market town in 1356. Through the rule of the von Helfenstein family, the city became part of the Duchy of Teck, ruled by Württemberg, in 1448. It temporarily belonged to the dukes of Bavaria between 1462 and 1504. Later still, albeit for only a short period, the city belonged to Ulm. During Württemberg times, it was always the seat of an administrative unit. This unit was an exclave of the dukes of Württemberg until 1803 when Württemberg&#x27;s territorial gains connected the city with the main part of the duchy&#x27;s territory. In 1807 Heidenheim was promoted to district status and then again to County status in 1938. The district reform of the 1970s did not change the county limits by much.

The economic development of the village and city is founded mainly on the area&#x27;s ore deposits that were already being exploited in Roman times. However, the importance of this branch of the city&#x27;s economy diminished near the turn of the 19th century due to great competition, first from Wasseralfingen and later from the Rhineland.

Heidenheim also played an important part in the textile industry. Flax grown in the Eastern Swabian Alps was used to manufacture linen. The business grew into an industry at the dawn of the 19th century with the help of cotton imports but declined after World War II due to international competition. During the war, a subcamp of the Dachau concentration camp was located here. It provided slave labour to local industry.

After World War II ended in 1945, a displaced persons camp was established in the city to help relocate Jewish displaced persons. The camp, housing at times up to 2,300 individuals, was dissolved in August 1949.

Mergelstetten was first mentioned in an official document by Bishop Walter von Augsburg in 1143 in which he confirmed that the nearby Cloister of Anhausen owned a mill, a fish pond and a farm. However, it is estimated that the first settlement was founded in the 7th or 8th century by the Alamanni. Other important dates for the local economy are 1828 when Jakob Zoeppritz from Darmstadt founded a woolen blanket factory and 1901 when Carl Schwenk of Ulm built the concrete factory.

==Religion==

Heidenheim&#x27;s residents originally belonged to the Prince-Bishopric of Augsburg from where they were assigned to the Heidenheim Chapter. However, in 1524 the Reformation burst into the city via Ulm.

At the time Heidenheim was part of Württemberg and Duke Ulrich championed the Reformation from 1535 on. Residents of city have adhered over the centuries primarily to the Protestant faith.

In those days, Heidenheim became the seat of a Deacony, its church being located on the site where Paul&#x27;s Protestant Church (built in 1897) currently stands. But Heidenheim&#x27;s first parish church was Peter&#x27;s Church at the top of the Totenberg. Originally a Roman church, it was remodeled several times and now serves as the chapel for the cemetery. During the 16th century, Michael&#x27;s Church became the seat of the Heidenheim parish. This church was built ca. 1200, completely rebuilt in 1578, and expanded in 1621. The tower was erected in 1687, and the extension was added to again in 1767. With the construction of Paul&#x27;s Church the seat of the deaconry moved there; however, Michael&#x27;s Church remains a church of Paul&#x27;s Parish to this day.

In the meantime, Heidenheim&#x27;s population continued to grow. During the 20th century, several additional parishes were founded: Christ Parish was founded in 1958 (its church built in 1956), John&#x27;s Parish with church and community center in 1963, Forestchurch Parish in 1972 (its church was built in 1975 but the community had had the use of a wooden chapel built in 1926), as well as Reconciliation Parish and Zinzendorf Parish.

These six parishes located in Heidenheim (proper) form the Protestant United Parish of Heidenheim. As they too belonged to Württemberg, the boroughs of Mergelstetten and Schnaitheim also converted to Protestantism early on. As a result, independent Protestant parishes and churches exist in both boroughs.

Mergelstetten was at first a branch of Bolheim, but became its own parish in 1700. Today&#x27;s church was built in 1843 to replace one that had burnt to the ground two years earlier.

The church of Schnaitheim was constructed in the 17th century, although the town already had a church (first mentioned in 1344).

Oggenhausen at first belonged to the parish of Zöschingen and remained Catholic. But during the 17th century here too Protestantism won out. Later the town became part of the parish of Nattheim until it became a parish in its own right in 1834. The village church was built in 1702 to replace an earlier chapel. Großkuchen remained Catholic because ecumenically it belonged to Öttingen and because the Benedictine Abbey at Neresheim owned the right to use the village church. The few Protestants who by now have moved in are attached to the parish in Schnaitheim. All Protestant parishes within city limits belong to the Deanony of Heidenheim within the Evangelical-Lutheran Church in Württemberg. Finally, pietist parishes are also represented in Heidenheim.

Catholics only reemerged in Heidenheim during the 19th century. In 1882 they got their own church when the Church of St. Mary was built. The corresponding parish was founded in 1886.

A second church, Trinity Church, was built in 1961 and became a parish in 1962. Mergelstetten got Christ the King Church in 1957, which was later elevated to a parish in 1961. These three parishes form what is today Ministry 3 of the Deacony Heidenheim within the Diocese of Rottenburg-Stuttgart.

In Schnaitheim, St. Boniface Church was built in 1951 (parish in 1961). The Church of Saint Peter and Paul in Großkuchen had been built back in 1736 on the foundation of an older church. Part of the parish is also Kleinkuchen but it has its own church of Saint Ulrich (built in 1517 and then rebuilt in 1746). Both parishes (St Boniface and St. Peter and Paul) together with the neighbouring parish of Mary&#x27;s Ascension in Königsbronn form the Ministry 2.

Catholics from Oggenhausen belong to the Holy Heart of Jesus parish in Nattheim (Ministry 1), also part of the Deacony of Heidenheim.

In addition to the two larger denominations, residents have the choice of independent churches and parishes such as the Methodist Church, The Evangelical Immanuel Parish, the Evangelical Chrischona-Community and others. The New Apostolic Church and The Christian Community are also represented in Heidenheim.

==Government==
In connection with the district reform in the 1970s, municipal laws of Baden-Württemberg were amended to introduce borough councils for certain boroughs. Residents of such boroughs elect their borough council at each municipal election and the council must be consulted on all matters of significance to the borough. The president also presides over the city council.

===City council===
Since the last municipal elections in 2019, the city council of Heidenheim has consisted of 33 (previously 34) members, each serving a term of five years. They belong to the following political parties:

===Mayor===
In the age when Heidenheim an der Brenz belonged to Württemberg a noble advocate presided over the court and the city. Somewhat later, a head advocate and then an Executor of the Duke led the court. From 1802 on, there were two mayors and 12 councilmen. In 1819 the City Executor stood at the helm of the city, assisted by a city council starting in 1822. Since 1907 the city&#x27;s leaders have been known by the title of Mayor. Today&#x27;s mayors are elected to office by direct vote for a term of 8 years. The mayor serves also as City Council President and their permanent Deputy is the First Councilperson.

===Coat of arms===
The coat of arms of the city of Heidenheim an der Brenz features a bearded &quot;heathen&quot; wearing a red cap with a blue rim and a red shirt with a blue collar on golden background. The city colors are red and blue.

Already in the 15th century the earliest known seal of the city displayed the canting heathen (= Heide in German). The colored version has been documented since the 16th century.

==Music==

Heidenheim is the home of the Neuer Kammerchor Heidenheim, one of the most accomplished youth choirs in Germany, founded in 2005 by Thomas Kammel and under his direction since then. The Neuer Kammerchor tours overseas extensively and has won widespread critical acclaim for its performances. In January 2017 the choir was given the Bürger-Prize of the City of Heidenheim for his accomplishments as a cultural ambassador.

==People, culture, and architecture==
Schnaitheim is home to the Sasse Theater company.

The State Museum of Württemberg (&quot;Württembergisches Landesmuseum&quot;) operates a branch location in Hellenstein Castle where it has its Carriage and Chaise Museum. The Museum in the Roman Baths exhibits finds dating back to the Roman era. The Art Museum, located in a former Jugendstil bath, organizes traveling exhibits. It also displays a permanent exhibit of the world&#x27;s largest and most complete collection of Picasso posters.

Located on top of Hellenstein Mountain and overlooking the city, Hellenstein Castle is the most important building and landmark in Heidenheim.

Notable structures in the inner city are the Protestant Michaels&#x27; Church (the former parish seat of the city), the &quot;Elmar-Doch-House&quot;, the Crown Inn and Pub, the Lower Gate, Villa Waldemaier, the burgher tower &quot;Türmle&quot;, the Castle Pharmacy, the weavers&#x27; settlement, the Heathland smithy, the Old mint and the old Peters&#x27; Church (today cemetery chapel).

The construction facility for the manufacture of large turbines built for the local Voith company in 1924 is a significant industrial historic landmark.

The little castle in Schnaitheim is situated at the Brenz river&#x27;s edge and offers a sight to see for visitors and residents alike. The Schnaitheim Mill is located just a few hundred yards away with its large wheel, though operation of the mill was halted several years ago.

In Mergelstetten the old church was torn down in 1841 and replaced with a new Protestant church built in neo-gothic style. The building was commissioned by Carl Alexander Heideloff, who also commissioned Lichtenstein Castle. Lumber was used to build parts of the church because the parish was poor at the time. For the same reason, the church tower was not built as tall as originally planned. Nonetheless, this church is popular and picturesque and frequently used on postcards.

===Events===

Every other year the Shepherd Run takes place in Heidenheim, first held in 1723 by Duke Eberhard Ludwig. It attracts all the shepherds in the area. Part of the Shepherd Run festivities is the crowning of a new shepherd king and queen. The Run was held until 1828. Thereafter followed a long break until 1922, when it was held again (five times until 1952). Since its return in 1972, it has once again been an integral part of Heidenheim&#x27;s regular cultural program.

In 2006 Heidenheim hosted the bi-annual Baden-Württemberg State Botanical Show.

Heidenheim hosts an annual World Cup fencing tournament in épée. Because of the size and depth of the field, the Heidenheim event is considered the strongest épée event in the world, stronger even than the World Championships or the Olympic Games.

===Opera Festival===

Every year, Heidenheim puts on the Opera Festival &quot;Opernfestspiele Heidenheim&quot; in Hellenstein Castle. The festival developed out of the former serenades held there. In recent years it has received international recognition and critical acclaim under the artistic direction of conductor Marco-Maria Canonica. In the summer of 2009 the Festival staged Marschner&#x27;s opera &quot;Der Vampyr&quot;, which was the second part of a cycle of three operas under the motto &quot;Romantik im Rittersaal&quot;. The first part was von Weber&#x27;s &quot;Der Freischütz&quot;, performed in 2008, and the third and final installment was Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Der fliegende Holländer&quot; in 2010. During the summer of 2010 all three operas were performed in full cycles. The Opernfestspiele Heidenheim draws visitors from around Europe and overseas, and has significantly boosted the city&#x27;s reputation as an important cultural site. Residents also enjoy the annual theater festival in the outdoor Nature Theater.

==Sport==
The city&#x27;s main sport club is Heidenheimer Sportbund (SB), which offers a number of different sports. Its football division is led by FC Heidenheim 1846, which plays at the Voith-Arena. The team has experienced success in recent years, rising two tiers in the German football league system after winning the Regionalliga Süd in 2009. From the 2023–24 season, it will compete in the Bundesliga.

Heidenheimer SB&#x27;s baseball division, Heidenheim Heideköpfe, plays in the first division of the Baseball Bundesliga. The club has made the playoffs in almost every year since it reached the first division in 2001, and won the championship in 2009.

==Economy and industry==

===Industry===
In economic terms, Heidenheim&#x27;s main claim to fame is being the headquarters of Voith, an industrial company specializing in turbines and machinery for the paper-making industry. Voith is Heidenheim&#x27;s largest employer and employs 7,500 people in and around the town.

In May 2006, the world&#x27;s first Paper Technology Centre was opened in Heidenheim at the cost of 75 million euros. Voith bills the centre as &quot;the most important center for paper research in the world&quot;.

===Transport===
Heidenheim is a stop along the Brenz Railway that runs from Aalen via Heidenheim to Ulm. The regional train line is also part of Heidenheim&#x27;s local public transport system. The town has a second train station on this line at the suburb of Schnaitheim.

Several bus lines also serve residents and visitors inside city limits.

Heidenheim is located near the Autobahn A 7 just off the Exit Heidenheim and is also easily accessible by car and truck via the federal highways B 19 and B 466 that traverse the city.

===Media===
&quot;Heidenheimer Zeitung&quot; and &quot;Heidenheimer Neue Presse&quot; are daily newspapers published in the city. In addition, the &quot;Neue Woche&quot; is published weekly (Thursday), as is the &quot;Sunday Newspaper&quot; (Sunday).

The Südwestrundfunk (SWR) operates a relay station for four of its FM stations and the television channel Das Erste. The Schmittenberg radio tower emits programs for two more radio stations.

<text>The Greater Poland uprising of 1848 or Poznań Uprising () was an unsuccessful military insurrection of Poles against forces of the Kingdom of Prussia, during the Revolutions of 1848. The main fighting in the Prussian Partition of Poland was concentrated in the Greater Poland region but some fighting also occurred in Pomerelia. In addition, protests were also held in Polish inhabited regions of Silesia.

==Background==
===1772–1806===
While the Kingdom of Prussia already possessed a large Polish population in Upper Silesia, it gained additional Polish citizens during the partitions of Poland. From the beginnings of Prussian rule, Poles were subject to a series of measures aimed against them and their culture; the Polish language was replaced by German as the official language, and most administration was made German as well; the Prussian ruler Frederick the Great despised Poles and hoped to replace them with Germans. Poles were portrayed as &#x27;backward Slavs&#x27; by Prussian officials who wanted to spread German language and culture. The land of Polish nobility was confiscated and given to German nobles.
Frederick the Great settled around 300,000 colonists in the newly acquired provinces of Prussia and aimed at a removal of the Polish nobility by increasing the German population and trying to reduce Polish owned land.
===1806-1815===
The Poles were freed from the Prussians with the victory of Napoleon in the War of the Fourth Coalition, and started a successful uprising against the Prussian forces in 1806. The Prussian hold on Polish areas was somewhat weakened after 1807 where parts of its partition were given to the Duchy of Warsaw.

===1815–1830===
The power status of Prussia was dependent on hindering any form of Polish statehood, due to crucial position of Greater Poland and Pomerelia, areas inhabited by a Polish majority; it didn&#x27;t support Polish attempts at restoration of Poland during the Congress of Vienna, where Prussia tried to gain the Duchy of Warsaw, but received only its western provinces. In 1815 the Prussian king made several guarantees in his speech to Poles in the newly formed Grand Duchy of Posen (created out of territories of Duchy of Warsaw) in regards to rights of Polish language and cultural institutions. In order to ensure loyalty of the newly re-conquered territories the Prussians engaged in several propaganda gestures hoping they would be enough to gain land-owners and aristocratic support. At the same time, the Lauenburg and Bütow Land and the former Starostwo of Draheim became the first territories of partitioned Poland to be quietly absorbed into the new German Confederation.

The base support of Prussian rule was from an influx of German colonists, officials and tradesmen, whose immigration started in 1772 due to Partitions of Poland and while it was halted in 1806, it soon was reinstated after 1815 as planned systemic action of Prussian government. After the Duchy of Warsaw was abolished in 1815, Prussia engaged in German colonization of Polish territories it acquired at the Congress of Vienna, continuing previous efforts started with the Partitions The Prussians knew exactly that the Polish aspiration was independence, however they were considering at the time two different methods to subdue Polish resistance. One advocated ruthless Germanization of the Polish provinces, the other pursued by Minister President Karl August von Hardenberg wanted to gain support of the Polish aristocracy, while turning them away from the (partially) pro-Polish Alexander I of Russia. Initially Hardenberg&#x27;s position prevailed. At the same time the Prussians and Russians through secret police worked together against Polish movements that would seek independence either from Russia or Prussia, and the Prussian representative in Warsaw helped to create political climate that would abolish constitutional freedoms in Congress Poland. The situation in Polish areas of Prussia was calmed down after series of proclamations and assuring the Polish right to their education, religion and traditions. In the end, the Polish rights were defined very narrowly, and Prussia started to abolish the Polish language in administration, schooling, and courts. In 1819 the gradual elimination of Polish language in schools began, with German being introduced in its place. This procedure was briefly stopped in 1822 but restarted in 1824.

In 1825 August Jacob, a politician hostile to Poles, gained power over newly created Provincial Educational Collegium in Poznan. Across the Polish territories Polish teachers were being removed from work, German educational programs were being introduced, and primary schooling was being replaced by German one that aimed at creation of loyal Prussian citizens. Already in 1816 the Polish gymnasium in Bydgoszcz was turned into a German school and Polish language removed from classes.

In 1825 the Teacher&#x27;s Seminary in Bydgoszcz was Germanized as well
While in 1824 a Provincial Parliament was invoked in the Grand Duchy of Posen, the representation was based on wealth census, meaning that the result gave most of the power to German minority in the area. Even when Poles managed to issue calls asking for enforcing of the guarantees formulated in treaties of Congress of Vienna and proclamations of Prussian King in 1815 they were rejected by Prussia. Thus neither the attempt to create Polish University in Poznań or Polish Society of Friends of Agriculture, Industry and Education were accepted by authorities. Nevertheless, Poles continued to ask for Polish representation in administration of the area, representing the separate character of the Duchy, keeping the Polish character of schools.

From 1825 the increase of anti-Polish policies became more visible and intense. Prussian political circles demanded end to tolerance of Polishness. Among the Poles two groups emerged, one still hoping for respect of separate status of the Duchy and insisting on working with Prussian authorities hoping that in time they would grant some freedoms. The other faction still hoped for independence of Poland. As consequence many Polish activists were imprisoned.
A joint operation of Russian and Prussian secret police managed to discover Polish organizations working in Breslau and Berlin, whose members were arrested and detained in Prussian jails.

===1830–1848===
Intensification of anti-Polish policies began in 1830. As the November Uprising in Russian-held Congress Poland began, the Prussians closely worked with Russia in regards to stopping any Polish independence drive. A state of emergency was introduced in the Duchy; police surveillance started on a large scale; 80,000 soldiers were moved into the area. The Prussian Foreign Minister openly declared that Prussia would oppose the independence of Poland as it would mean territories taken in the Partitions of Poland could be claimed by it. Russians soldiers fighting Poles received food supplies, equipment, and intelligence from Prussia. Prussian generals wanted to march into Congress Poland, but the threat of French intervention stopped those plans.

In 1830 Eduard Heinrich von Flotwell, a self-declared enemy of Poles, who openly called for Germanization and superiority of German culture over Polish people, became the administrator of the region. Supported by Karl von Grolman, a Prussian general, a program was presented that envisioned removing Poles from all offices, courts, judiciary system, and local administration, controlling the clergy, and making peasants loyal through enforced military service. Schools were to be Germanized as well. Those plans were supported by such prominent public figures such as Carl von Clausewitz, August Neidhardt von Gneisenau, Theodor von Schön, and Wilhelm von Humboldt. By 1830 the right to use Polish in courts and institutions was no longer respected. While the Poles constituted the majority of population in the area, they held only 4 out of 21 official posts of higher level.
From 1832 they could no longer hold higher posts at the local administrative level(Landrat). At the same time the Prussian government and Prussian king pursued Germanization of administration and judicial system, local officials enforced Germanization of educational system and tried to eradicate the economic position of Polish nobility. In Bydgoszcz the mayors were all Germans. In Poznań, out of 700 officials, only 30 were Poles.

Another colonization attempt aimed at Germanization was pursued by Prussia after 1831, and while Poles constituted 73% of population in 1815, they were reduced to 60% in 1848. In the same time period, the German presence grew from 25% to 30%. Flotwell initiated programs of German colonization and tried to reduce Polish landownership in favor of Germans. As &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; writes &quot;At the end of 1830, however, a new policy was inaugurated with the presidency of E. H. von Flottwell: the experiment of settling subsidized German colonists on Polish soil (started by Frederick the Great after the first partition of Poland) was resumed&quot;. Settlement of German colonists were supported especially under the rule of Eduard Flottwell in the years 1831–1840 In the period 1832-1842 the number of Polish holdings was reduced from 1020 to 950 and the German ones increased from 280 to 400. The Jewish minority in the province was exploited by Prussians to gain support for its policies. By granting Jews rights and abolishing old limitations, the Prussians hoped they could integrate the Jewish population into German society, and gain a counterweight to the Polish presence. As a result, many Jews saw in Prussia a free, liberal state, and were opposed to Polish independence movement.

When Frederick William IV&#x27;s ascended to the throne in 1840, certain concessions were again granted. The German colonization was halted; some schools were able to teach the Polish language again; promises were made to create departments of Polish language in universities in Breslau and Berlin. There were also vague promises about creation of a university in Poznań. This was all that Poles were granted. In reality only the methods changed, while the overall goal of Germanization remained the same, only this time with lighter methods, and by concessions Prussians hoped to assure identification of Poles with the Prussian state and an eventual change of their identity. The concession also were connected to freezing of relations between Prussia and the Russian Empire, with Prussian politicians hoping that Poles could be used to fight Russia on Prussia&#x27;s behalf.

At this time, the majority of Poles were not yet engaged in political activity. Mostly the landowners, the intelligentsia, and the upper urban classes possessed a developed national consciousness. The peasantry and the working class had yet to experience their own &quot;Polish national awakening.&quot; Through military service and school education, and in the case of &quot;regulated&quot; peasants in the wake of the benefits wrought by the final emancipation decree introduced in 1823, some segments of these social groups had begun to identify with the Prussian state. However, as German colonization grew in strength and policies against Polish religion and traditions were introduced the local population begun to feel hostility towards Prussia and the German presence. Economic factors also began to influence Polish-German relations. Colonization policies in particular created a fear of German competition among Poles. The greatest difference remained the religious segregation. The local Germans displayed rather politically apathy and refrained from creating an organized form of social life. Prior to 1848, the provincial Diet remained the only forum of German political activity. In general, relations of the local Germans with the Polish population were good.

In the end of the 1840s about 60 percent of the population of the Duchy were Polish, 34 percent German and 6 percent Jewish. Out of the administrative districts, Poles had a majority in 18, while Germans had a majority in 6, out which 4 were in the western part and 2 in the northern part.

A first attempt to change the situation in the Duchy was made in the Greater Poland Uprising of 1846 after which 254 Polish activists were imprisoned upon charges of conspiracy. The trial ended on 2 December 1847, when 134 of the defendants were acquitted and returned to the Duchy. Eight defendants, including Ludwik Mierosławski, were sentenced to death, the rest to prison in the Berlin-Moabit prison. The death sentences were not carried out as Revolution in Prussia started and the Prussian king granted amnesty to political prisoners as part of concessions to the revolutionaries

==Timeline of the uprising==
===Prelude===

On 19 March 1848, after the Revolution in Berlin succeeded throughout the Spring of Nations, King Frederick William IV of Prussia granted amnesty to the Polish prisoners, who joined the Berlin Home Guard in the evening of 20 March 1848 by founding a &quot;Polish Legion&quot; in the courtyard of the Berlin Palace, and were armed with weapons from the Royal Prussian Arsenal. Ludwik Mierosławski waved the Black-Red-Gold flag of the German Revolution and the prisoners were celebrated by the public. Speeches during the demonstration were made about a joint fight against the Russian Empire for a free and united Germany and an independent Poland. Karol Libelt noted from Berlin that he was under the impression that the whole people wanted a free and independent Poland to serve as a German shield against Russia and that the Polish question would soon be resolved. Volunteers from Berlin tried to join this legion and support the Polish struggle for liberty, with the expectation that the Legion would fight against the Russian rule in Congress Poland, but these volunteers were rejected. Polish emigrants to France, like Adam Czartoryski, who returned to join that legion were allowed to use Prussian railways for free and often received with cheers, e.g. by the revolutionary committees in Cologne French politicians granted money for those trips hoping to remove Polish influence from France, for fear of revolutionary actions. Additionally the French incited Poles to start uprising, as they wanted to secure a diversionary element in case the Holy Alliance would turn its forces against France.

===Initial phase=== 
The uprising in Poznań had started on 20 March 1848, and inspired by the events in Berlin, a demonstration in Poznań was organized. As the authorities agreed to creation of a delegation that would bring proposals from the Polish side to Berlin and to the Prussian king, the Polish National Committee was created in Poznań. The Polish historian Jerzy Zdrada wrote that the delegates postulated independence of Polish territories but arriving in Berlin decided to remove that demand, and replaced it with &quot;national reorganization,&quot; removal of Prussian military, and turning over the administration to Poles. Zdrada notes that those demands were to the liking of the Berlin Revolutionary Committee which wanted Poles as a force to fight Russia. According to the English historian Norman Davies, the political demands of the committee were for effective autonomy, not for independence. The organized militia was intended for use not against Prussia but against the threat of Russian intervention. The Committee represented various political orientations and social classes, in order to achieve a coalition character. Its overall character was liberal-democratic, and among land-owners and intellectualists it included a Polish peasant Jan Palacz. The Polish Committee restricted its membership to Poles and demands from Germans and Jews to be represented in the Polish Committee were not accepted

On 21 March a joint demonstration of Germans and Poles took place. Germans often wore both the Black-Red-Gold cockade and the Polish Red-White as a revolutionary symbol. On March 21, the National Committee released a proclamation calling for a common struggle seeking understanding with the Germans, and a day later recognized the rights of Jews
. According to Zdrada on the same day the Prussian general Friedrich August Peter von Colomb ordered Prussian soldiers to take the Bazar, a hotel which was the center of Polish activities. This was avoided as it would result in Polish-Prussian confrontation-something that the liberals in Berlin didn&#x27;t yet desire. On 22 March the German-controlled Poznań city council voted to support the postulates of the National Committee in Berlin. While Poles avoided possible confrontation in the event of raising the question of independence and demanded national reorganization instead, the Germans called for separation of the Duchy from Prussia. Meanwhile, the Polish Legion arrived on 28 March 1848 from Berlin to Poznań, where Mierosławski took over military command, and Jedrzej Moraczewski, a member of the Polish Committee, ordered on 28 March: &quot;&quot;One should make every effort not to alarm the Germans in order to avoid a strong reaction from their side. On the other hand it is necessary to maintain supremacy over them&quot;.

The reason for initial support of Poles by Prussians and Germans was the fear of Russian intervention which would stop creation of strong unified Germany. Germans saw in Poles an opportunity to create a diversion stopping Russians from intervention in Germany itself. The hostility to Russia manifested by Poles was the base of German sympathy towards Polish aspiration during the initial phase of the Uprising. Karl Wilhelm von Willisen encouraged Mierosławski to fight a war against Russia. The Prussian foreign minister von Arnim used the Polish issue as weapon against Russia. Leading German politicians and thinkers supported using Poles as protection against Russia, such as Karl August Varnhagen, Robert Blum, Heinrich von Gagern, Georg Gervinius, Johann Wirth and Constantin Frantz.

===From cooperation to confrontation===
As the threat of war with Russia grew distant, the German elites and society became hostile to Polish aspirations. Polish successes created distrust in local Germans, and they felt threatened. The news of national reorganization of the province was the turning-point. The assumption of power by a Polish administration and the creation of a military corps out of local Polish population created a fear among Germans for their position in a Polish-ruled Duchy. Within a few days, the Polish movement embraced the whole Greater Poland region. Polish peasants and urban citizens turned against Prussian officials. Polish nobility and peasantry took up arms, preparing for confrontation with Prussian Army; Prussian symbols were torn down; in a couple of places fighting erupted with German colonists. In Pomerelia, constituting the bulk of the former Province of West Prussia, the Polish population took inspiration from events in Greater Poland and openly turned against Prussian officials, led by Natalis Sulerzyski and Seweryn Elżanowski. In Chełmno a Temporary National Committee of Polish Prussia was formed. By the end of March, though, local Germans turned harshly against Poles, and together with Prussian military pacified the area, while Polish leaders were imprisoned.

Overnight, Poles turned Germans from an ally against Russia into the enemy that would threaten German control over Greater Poland and Pomerania. The atmosphere among the Germans and a portion of the Jewish population began to change diametrically. A German National Committee was founded on 23 March, and a second one on 27 March, largely influenced by German public officials loyal to the Prussian king. Nationalist and even chauvinist voices could be heard in Germany demanding incorporation of the whole Greater Poland into the German Confederation. Encroachments against Jews caused a further support of the German Committee by the Jewish population and the breakdown of Prussian authority allowed long-simmering resentments to explode, as the German Committee urged in a complaint addressed to the Polish Committee: &quot;There have been many cases in which armed groups of your people have threatened and violated the property and personal security of your German-speaking neighbors. Keep in mind that through such acts of infamous violence you stain the honor of your nation and you undermine the sympathy for your cause among the nations of Germany and Europe.&quot; The new German Committee that emerged in Poznań subsequently engaged in consistent opposition to Polish movement. Separate German National Committees were established, and petitions demanding the division of the Duchy and the incorporation of cities and counties into German Confederation were addressed to Berlin. With the army protecting them, Germans started to paralyze development of Polish self-rule. German officials, colonists, and tradesmen seized the opportunity and begun counteraction, demanding incorporation of the Polish territories into a unified German state, and accusing Poles of repression. Their claims were methodically used by German propaganda to win support of European countries such as Great Britain and France. Additionally, German liberals turned against Poles, demanding &quot;protection of German area.&quot; Soon, German craftsmen, traders, and colonists in communities began to form committees and paramilitary units to defend their interests and to prevent local Poles from organizing, often joined by local Jews. They started to besiege the Prussian King with petitions to exclude their areas from the planned political reorganization. By late April, about 8,000 German civilians of the Noteć(Netze) district north of Poznań were organized in paramilitary units and another 6,000 around the towns of Międzyrzecz (Meseritz) and Nowy Tomyśl (Neutomischel).

===Attempts to reach compromise===
On 23 March the Prussian king granted an audience to Polish delegation and verbally declared his agreement to their proposals for autonomy; at the same time in confidential conversation with Prussian military commanders he ordered them to prepare an invasion of Polish territories to crush the Polish movement. On 24 March the Prussian king issued a declaration that promised the short-dated reorganization of the province and the creation of a commission of both nationalities, whose aim would be the consideration of interests of both nations. The Poles understood those measures as restoration of autonomy. Local Polish committees were formed, Prussian state treasuries requisitioned, and symbols of Prussian state dismantled. In many places the local landrats were removed from power. As John Fane, 11th Earl of Westmorland, a British diplomat in Berlin, reported on 6 April 1848, &quot;great excesses had been committed by armed bands of Poles, headed by some of the Nobles and Refugees, who have pillaged and set fire to country seats and farm houses and rendered themselves guilty of other depredations which the Government will endeavour to repress by moveable columns of Troops&quot;. Berlin authorities tried to delay the course of events by proposing the division of the province into two parts. Additionally they tried to convince Poles that creation of Polish military formations would hinder the talks about autonomy. Meanwhile the Poles, began to create armed units on 22 March based on decision of the Polish National Committee, which in the meantime changed its name to Polish Central Committee. On 28 March Ludwik Mierosławski took command of military supply and organization, in which he was supported by Polish émigré officers. Fearing intervention by the Russian Empire in a Prussia wracked by liberal revolt, Poles were preparing for a joint defense with Prussian forces against possible Russian attack. Prince Adam Czartoryski came to Berlin for political talks, and general Ignacy Prądzyński prepared plans for possible war with Russia.

In the beginning of April the local Poznań Parliament voted 26 to 17 votes against joining the German Confederation on 3 April 1848. The German minority in Greater Poland through German National Committee declared that it rejected any notion of Polish-German brotherhood and Germans would not abandon control, even if the Polish state was re-established. On 4 April Prussian military declared a stage of siege in Poznań.
On 5 April the new &quot;Royal Civil Commissioner for the Province Posen&quot;, Karl Wilhelm von Willisen, a figure claiming to be sympathetic to the Polish cause, arrived at Poznań and his early actions disappointed the Germans greatly. Willisen soon came into conflict with the military commander of Poznań, general Friedrich August Peter von Colomb, who opposed any kind of Polish independence efforts. Willisen declared that Poles would be granted autonomy but they have to reduce their forces, which on beginning of April counted 7,000 people. A compromise was reached on 11 April in Jarosławiec, when Willisen permitted the Poles to have four military camps counting 720 people each (In the end the number of people in the camps was around 4,000).

===Breakdown of negotiations===
On 14 April the Prussian king declared that ten northern and western counties out of the 24 counties of the province would not take part in the planned political reorganization; on 26 April this was extended to parts of further six counties, including the City of Poznań itself, leaving to Poles only nine counties. To all involved parties it was obviously a temporary solution and unacceptable to Poles as out of the administrative districts Poles had majority in eighteen while Germans in six, of which four were in the western part and two in the northern part. Willisen himself left Poznań on 20 April, blamed for treason and having &quot;betrayed the German cause&quot; and as a contemporary eyewitness wrote &quot;Willisen was exposed to personal insults or even danger from the infuriated German and Jewish mobs of Posen&quot;
. Not long after he was relieved of his duties and replaced by Ernst von Pfuel, who arrived in Poznań early May.

The Polish National Committee had decided to disarm its forces, but this determination was ignored by Mierosławski who expected a Russian intervention in which they would assist Prussian forces in defense as an ally. As such they were unprepared to fight the Prussians.

===Outbreak of military hostilities===
The demobilized Polish militia was harassed by German forces and several Poles were either murdered or wounded. Demobilized Poles returning to their homes were being harassed as were Catholic priests, while Germans pacified villages. This provoked an outrage in Polish peasants who rose up against Prussian forces in rural uprising and guerrilla warfare, and joined the regular Polish forces under Mierosławski. Mierosławski believed that to save morale and honor of Poles it was necessary to resist militarily, while the Committee members were opposed to fighting, and as such the Committee disbanded itself on 30 April, in its last proclamation stressing the Prussian treachery and violence. As the Prussian troops lashed unrestricted terror against the Polish population, the Prussian attack started on 29 April as camps in Książ, Pleszew, Września and Miłosław were assaulted. In Książ, Prussian troops destroyed the town after murdering 600 prisoners and wounded Among the victims of the massacre was Florian Dąbrowski Additionally the population of Grodzisk led by Jewish doctor Marcus Mosse defended the town against encroaching 600 Prussian troops. Polish committees in Wielkopolska were being attacked as well. According to Jerzy Kozłowski a particular role in the conflict was played by German colonists who formed their own militia, engaging in acts of terror against Polish population. Witold Matwiejczyk claims these colonists came from previous settlement efforts by Prussian government which intensified efforts to settle Germans into Poznań region after 1815, and were hostile towards the Polish movement, but initially fearing Russian intervention kept a low profile During the conflict the colonists formed military formations called Schutzvereine and Schutzwache and not only accompanied Prussian military in pacifying Polish villages but also engaged in acts on their own initiative German colonists were particularly active in Szczytno region and in Czarnkowski region formed their own militia unit where a local German military commander known for his anti-Polish attitude managed to organize several hundred colonists into paramilitary units and took over Czarnkow from Polish forces

===Battle of Miłosław===
On 30 April Ludwik Mierosławski successfully defeated Prussian forces at the Battle of Miłosław; after winning at Książ, Prussian general Blumen commanding 2500 soldiers and four cannons, encroached on Miłosław where Ludwik Mierosławski was located along with 1200 soldiers and four cannons. The Prussian forces divided themselves into two columns—one moving from Środa, the other from Września.

Initially Mierosławski engaged in talks with Blumen, but when he received news that Poles from Nowe Miasto under the command of Józef Garczyński were coming to help him with 1000 soldiers and that additional reinforcements of 1200 soldiers were moving from Pleszew under the command of Feliks Białoskórski, he broke off the negotiations. As a consequence the battle started.

In the first phase of the battle, Polish forces were driven out of Miłosław and took positions along two sides of the main road. In pursuit of retreating Poles, Blumen ordered a cavalry assault. The Prussian pursuit was stopped however by the arrival of Garczyński, and when Białoskórki&#x27;s soldiers arrived the Poles counterattacked.

The second phase was dominated by a Polish counterattack along the line of the main road and attack by cavalry units before the Prussians were able to attack Polish positions. Afterwards the Poles re-entered the town and the Prussians were forced to retreat. However, the Poles were exhausted and were not able to pursue the retreating Prussians, causing the victory to not be exploited to its full potential. Polish losses counted 200 soldiers while the Prussians 225.

===Further fighting and end of the Uprising===
The uprising was focused in Greater Poland but it also reached out to Pomerelia where Natalis Sulerzeski organized Polish armed forces and together with Ignacy Łyskowski arranged a meeting in Wębrzyn of Polish delegates was organized who created the Provisional Committee of Polish Prussia. It was to start talks on reorganization of the Western Prussia provinces on 5 April in Chełmno, but it never came to that, as Prussians arrested most of its members and put them in prison in Grudziądz. Seweryn Elżanowski in response organized a military formation counting several hundred people which took part in combat near Tuchola Forest after which it moved into Greater Poland. On 2 May the Polish kosynierzy defeated a Prussian column near Września at the village of , but the victory resulted in heavy losses. Prussians managed to defeat Polish forces in Mosina, Rogalin, Stęszew, Kórnik, Buk, Oborniki. Mierosławski tendered his resignation as the commander of the Polish forces on 6 May and the new Supreme commander, Augustyn Brzezanski, capitulated on 9 May. The act of capitulation was signed in Bardo near Września.

==Aftermath and legacy==

The events of the failed Uprising inspired Polish movement. A crucial point was that, unlike in the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria or in Congress Poland, the peasantry took active and decisive part on behalf of Polish resistance. The Polish peasants had seen in German colonization a primary threat to their national and social interests.

The uprising also showed to Poles that there was no possibility to negotiate with Germans regarding Polish statehood. The so-called &quot;Polen-Debatte&quot; in the Frankfurt Parliament in July 1848 concerned the issue of Poland and showed the attitude of German politicians regarding this. They opposed Poland and any concessions to Poles in Poznań. Those who in the past have claimed to be friendly towards Poles, rejected all of their former declarations and called them mistakes and the idea of restored Poland &quot;insanity&quot;. At the same time the demands of German representatives were not only directed against Poland, they also wanted a war with Denmark, opposed autonomy for Italians in South Tyrol, called Alsace-Lorraine German, and talked about German interests in the Baltic provinces of Russia.

===Repressions===
1,500 Poles were imprisoned in Poznań Citadel, mostly peasants who took part in the fighting, their heads shaved bald and branded by Prussian authorities by chemical substance which scarred them with permanent wounds on hands, ears and faces. Overall the prisoners were abused with repeated beatings and degrading treatment taking place Stefan Kieniewicz, a Polish historian, in his scholarly work analysing the Uprising published in 1935 and republished in 1960, writes that blame for this was shifted between Colomb and his lower-ranking officers, the incident was widely publicised by Polish press . Mierosławski himself, whose mother was French and who lived in Paris prior to 1846, was released after a French diplomatic protest and commanded German insurgent units in the Baden Revolution and the Palatine Uprising in 1849 during the Revolutions of 1848 in the German states.

The Grand Duchy of Posen was subsequently replaced with the Province of Posen and the Prussian government rejected any ideas of autonomy. As a Prussian Province it was set to be completely incorporated into the German Confederation, however when the Frankfurt Parliament finalized the German Constitution on 28 March 1849 neither the Province of Posen nor West Prussia were mentioned. Formal integration of Polish lands into Germany was thus avoided for another 17 years until the North German Confederation was established in 1866.

===Polish resistance===
The post-uprising repressions spawned defensive reactions within the Polish society. Some favored an armed struggle for independence and formed the &quot;Poznan Committee&quot; (Kormitet Poznanski), which represented the democratically oriented landowners and intellectuals, or the socialist &quot;Society of Plebeians&quot; (Zwiazek Plebejuszy). Both organizations worked for an uprising that would encompass all three parts of the partitioned Poland. Other Polish activists, mostly members of the landed gentry and the intelligentsia, abandoned armed insurrection and began to propagate a doctrine of organic work by strengthening the economic potential and educational level, calling &quot;Now we will go against Prussians not with scythes but with votes&quot; and decided to focus their energy on increasing their economic and political position before deciding for military confrontation.

In the elections to the Prussian Landtag in May 1849 Polish delegates achieved 16 out of the 30 seats of the Province of Posen. Three Polish representatives were also elected from Pomerelia, they were led by Ignacy Łyskowski, a landlord and journalist, who printed a Polish newspaper &quot;Szkółka Narodowa&quot; in Chełmno. Gustaw Gizewiusz was elected from Masuria in East Prussia but he died soon after. In Silesia, a Polish pastor Józef Szafranek was also elected to the Prussian parliament. The attempted elections in the Polish lands to the German Constitutional Parliament were in turn largely boycotted by Polish parties in protest against the incorporation efforts.

For 70 years Poles in Greater Poland would work on developing their organization, increasing wealth and development of Polish lands. The first organization to do so was Polish League created in Summer 1848. Made by liberal politicians it was led by Count August Cieszkowski-writer and philosopher. Its aims were the increasing of national self-awareness among Polish population, rising its life standards and defense of Catholic faith and Polish-owned land. By Autumn 1848 it counted already 40,000 members. Its main directorate was led by Count Gustaw Potworowski. The organization supported agricultural reforms by Polish rural dwellers, and spread information connected to improving agriculture as well as strengthening civic unity. While it was completely legal and didn&#x27;t violate any laws, the Prussian government disbanded it in 1850. In practice its members continued to work and soon numerous successor organizations were founded leading way to Polish resistance in the Prussian Partition of Poland based on economic and legal opposition. In Silesia the movement from Greater Poland reached out to Józef Lompa and Emanuel Smołka who organized the Polish national movement in Upper and Lower Silesia. The 1848 was also a turning point for Polish national movement in Pomerelia, which gained support of city inhabitants and Polish peasants, and especially strong support among Polish clergy, who were subjected to hostile policies by the German bishopric in Pelplin. The Polish national movement in Pomerelia decided after those events to pursue its goals by legal means, and remained in this position until World War I The Polish activists from Pomerelia soon came in contact with Masurs and Gustaw Gizewiusz, who encouraged Masurs to defend their local traditions and language.

<text>Latin Americans (; ) are the citizens of Latin American countries (or people with cultural, ancestral or national origins in Latin America).

Latin American countries and their diasporas are multi-ethnic and multi-racial. Latin Americans are a pan-ethnicity consisting of people of different ethnic and national backgrounds. As a result, many Latin Americans do not take their nationality as an ethnicity, but identify themselves with a combination of their nationality, ethnicity and their ancestral origins. In addition to the indigenous population, Latin Americans include people with Old World ancestors who arrived since 1492. Latin America has the largest diasporas of Spaniards, Portuguese, Africans, Italians, Lebanese and Japanese in the world. The region also has large German (second largest after the United States), French, Palestinian (largest outside the Arab states), Chinese and Jewish diasporas.

The specific ethnic and/or racial composition varies from country to country and diaspora community to diaspora community: many have a predominance of mixed indigenous and European descent or mestizo, population; in others, Indigenous Amerindians are a majority; some are mostly inhabited by people of European ancestry; others are primarily mulatto. The largest single group are white Latin Americans. Together with the people of part European ancestry, they combine for almost the totality of the population.

Latin Americans and their descendants can be found almost everywhere in the world, particularly in densely populated urban areas. The most important migratory destinations for Latin Americans are found in the United States, Spain, France, Canada, Italy and Japan.

==Definition==
Latin America ( or &quot;Latinoamérica&quot;; ) is the region of the Americas where Romance languages (i.e., those derived from Latin)—particularly Spanish and Portuguese—are primarily spoken.

It includes 20 countries or territories: Mexico in North America; Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama in Central America; Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, Chile, Argentina and Uruguay in South America; and Cuba, the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico in the Caribbean—in summary, Hispanic America plus Brazil. Canada and the United States, despite having sizeable Romance-speaking communities, are almost never included in the definition, primarily for being predominantly English-speaking Anglosphere countries. The ABC islands (Leeward Antilles), where the primary language is Papiamento, a Portuguese Creole, may or may not be considered part of Latin America. 

Latin America, therefore, can be defined as all those parts of the Americas that were once part of the Spanish or Portuguese colonial empires, namely Spanish America and Colonial Brazil.

==Demographics==

===Ethnic and racial groups===



The population of Latin America comprises a variety of ancestries, ethnic groups and races, making the region one of the most diverse in the world. The specific composition varies from country to country: many have a predominance of mixed European and Amerindian, or mestizo, population; in others, Amerindians are a majority; some are dominated by inhabitants of European ancestry; and some countries&#x27; populations are primarily mulatto. White Latin Americans are the largest single group, accounting for more than one-third of the population. Black, Asian, and zambo (mixed black and Amerindian) minorities are also identified regularly.
* Mestizos: Intermixing between Europeans and Amerindians began early in the colonial period and was extensive. The resulting people, known as mestizos, make up the majority of the population in half of the countries of Latin America. Additionally, mestizos comprise large minorities in nearly all the other mainland countries.
* Whites: Beginning in the late 15th century, large numbers of Iberian colonists settled in what became Latin America (Portuguese in Brazil and Spaniards elsewhere in the region), and at present most white Latin Americans are of Spanish, Portuguese and Italian ancestry. Iberians brought the Spanish and Portuguese languages, the Catholic faith, and many Iberian traditions. Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Colombia and Venezuela contain the largest numbers of Europeans in Latin America in pure numbers. They make up the majority of the population of Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica, Cuba and Uruguay and roughly half of Brazil&#x27;s and Venezuela&#x27;s population. Of the millions of immigrants since most of Latin America gained independence in the 1810s–1820s, Italians formed the largest group, and next were Spaniards and Portuguese. Many others arrived, such as French, Germans, Greeks, Poles, Ukrainians, Russians, Croats, Serbs, Latvians, Lithuanians, English, Jews, Irish and Welsh. Most Latin Americans have some degree of European ancestry, when talking into account those of either mixed or full European descent.
* Amerindians: The indigenous population of Latin America arrived during the Lithic stage. In post-Columbian times, they experienced tremendous population decline, particularly in the early decades of colonization. They have since recovered in numbers, surpassing sixty million (by some estimates), though, with the growth of the other groups, they now comprise a majority only in Bolivia. In Guatemala, Amerindians are a large minority that comprises 41% of the population. Mexico&#x27;s 21% (9.8% in the official 2005 census) is the next largest ratio, and one of the largest indigenous population in the Americas in absolute numbers. Most of the remaining countries have Amerindians minorities, in every case making up less than one-tenth of the respective country&#x27;s population. In many countries, people of mixed indigenous and European ancestry, known as mestizos, make up the majority of the population.
* Asians: People of Asian descent number several million in Latin America. The majority of Asian descendants in the country are either of West Asian (such as Lebanese or Syrian) or East Asian (like Chinese or Japanese) descent. The first Asians to settle in the region were Filipino, as a result of Spain&#x27;s trade involving Asia and the Americas. The Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics states that the country&#x27;s largest Asian communities are from West Asia and East Asia. It is estimated that 7 to 10 million Brazilians are of Lebanese descent. Around 2 million Brazilians self-identify as being &quot;Yellow&quot; (amarela or of East Asian descent) according to the 2010 census. The country is home to the largest ethnic Japanese community outside Japan itself, estimated as high as 1.5 million, and circa 200,000 ethnic Chinese and 100,000 ethnic Koreans. Ethnic Koreans also number tens of thousands of individuals in Argentina and Mexico. The 2017 census stated that under 40,000 Peruvians self-identified as having Chinese or Japanese ancestry. Though other estimates claim as much as 1.47 million people of East Asian descent reside in the country. Lebanese and Syrian descendants have also formed notable communities in countries like Mexico and Argentina. The Martiniquais population includes a mixed African, European and Amerindian descent, and an East Indian (Asian Indian) population is also present in Martinique. In Guadeloupe, an estimated 14% of the population is of East Asian descent.
* Mulattoes: Mulattoes are people of mixed European and African ancestry, mostly descended from Spanish, Portuguese, or French settlers on one side and African slaves on the other, during the colonial period. Brazil is home to Latin America&#x27;s largest mulatto population. Mulattoes form a majority in the Dominican Republic and are also numerous in Cuba, Puerto Rico, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, Colombia, and Ecuador. Smaller populations of mulattoes are found in other Latin American countries.
* Blacks: Millions of African slaves were brought to Latin America from the 16th century onward, most of whom were sent to the Caribbean region and Brazil. Today, people identified as &quot;black&quot; are most numerous in Brazil (more than 20 million). Significant populations are also found in Cuba, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Panama and Colombia. Latin Americans of mixed black and white ancestry, called mulattoes, are far more numerous than blacks.
* Zambos: Intermixing between blacks and Amerindians was especially prevalent in Colombia and Brazil, often due to slaves running away (becoming &quot;cimarrones&quot;: maroons) and being taken in by indigenous villagers. In Spanish-speaking nations, people of this mixed ancestry are known as zambos, and they are also known as cafuzos in Brazil.
* Multi-ethnic/Multi-racials: In addition to the foregoing groups, Latin America also has millions of peoples who belong to multiracial backgrounds.


===Racial groups according to self-identification===
The Latinobarómetro surveys have asked respondents in 18 Latin American countries what race they considered themselves to belong to. The figures shown below are averages for 2007 through 2011.

===Language===
Spanish and Portuguese are the predominant languages of Latin America. Spanish is the official language of most of the countries on the Latin American mainland, as well as in Puerto Rico (where it is co-official with English), Cuba and the Dominican Republic. Portuguese is spoken only in Brazil, the biggest and most populous country in the region. French is spoken in Haiti, as well as in the French overseas departments of French Guiana in South America and Guadeloupe and Martinique in the Caribbean. Dutch is the official language of some Caribbean islands and in Suriname on the continent; however, as Dutch is a Germanic language, these territories are not considered part of Latin America.

Indigenous languages are widely spoken in Peru, Guatemala, Bolivia and Paraguay, and, to a lesser degree, in Mexico, Chile and Ecuador. In Latin American countries not named above, the population of speakers of indigenous languages is small or non-existent.

In Peru, Quechua is an official language, alongside Spanish and any other indigenous language in the areas where they predominate. In Ecuador, while holding no official status, the closely related Quichua is a recognized language of the indigenous people under the country&#x27;s constitution; however, it is only spoken by a few groups in the country&#x27;s highlands. In Bolivia, Aymara, Quechua and Guaraní hold official status alongside Spanish. Guarani is, along with Spanish, an official language of Paraguay, and is spoken by a majority of the population (who are, for the most part, bilingual), and it is co-official with Spanish in the Argentine province of Corrientes. In Nicaragua, Spanish is the official language, but, on the country&#x27;s Caribbean coast English and indigenous languages such as Miskito, Sumo, and Rama also hold official status. Colombia recognizes all indigenous languages spoken within its territory as official, though fewer than 1% of its population are native speakers of these. Nahuatl is one of the 62 native languages spoken by indigenous people in Mexico that are officially recognized by the government as &quot;national languages&quot; along with Spanish.

Other European languages spoken in Latin America include: English, by some groups in Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Panama and Puerto Rico, as well as in nearby countries that may or may not be considered Latin American, such as Belize and Guyana; English is also used as a major foreign language in Latin American commerce and education. Other languages spoken in parts of Latin America include German in southern Brazil, southern Chile, Argentina, portions of northern Venezuela and Paraguay; Italian in Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Venezuela; Polish, Ukrainian and Russian in southern Brazil; and Welsh in southern Argentina. Hebrew and Yiddish are used by Jewish diasporas in Argentina and Brazil.

In several nations, especially in the Caribbean region, creole languages are spoken. The most widely spoken creole language in the Caribbean in general is Haitian Creole, the predominant language of Haiti; it is derived primarily from French and certain West African tongues with indigenous, English, Portuguese and Spanish influences as well. The other most spoken Creole is Antillean Creole French that is primarily spoken in the Lesser Antilles. It is a French-based creole, that is the local language spoken among the natives of the Caribbean islands of Saint Lucia and Dominica and also in Martinique and Guadeloupe. Creole languages of mainland Latin America, similarly, are derived from European languages and various African tongues.

===Religion===
The vast majority of Latin Americans are Christians (90%), mostly Roman Catholics. About 71% of the Latin American population consider themselves Catholic. Membership in Protestant denominations is increasing, particularly in Brazil, Guatemala and Puerto Rico. Argentina hosts the largest communities of both Jews and Muslims in Latin America. Indigenous religions and rituals are practiced in countries with large indigenous populations, especially Bolivia, Guatemala, Mexico and Peru, and Afro-Latin American religions such as Santería, Candomblé, Umbanda, and Macumba are practiced in countries with large Afro-Latin American populations, especially Cuba, Brazil, and Dominican Republic. Latin America constitutes, in absolute terms, the world&#x27;s second largest Christian population, after Europe.

===Migration===

According to the 2005 Colombian census or DANE, about 3,331,107 Colombians currently live abroad. The number of Brazilians living overseas is estimated at 2 million people. An estimated 1.5 to two million Salvadorians reside in the United States. At least 1.5 million Ecuadorians have gone abroad, mainly to the United States and Spain. Approximately 1.5 million Dominicans live abroad, mostly in the United States. More than 1.3 million Cubans live abroad, most of them in the United States. It is estimated that over 800,000 Chileans live abroad, mainly in Argentina, Canada, United States and Spain. Other Chilean nationals may be located in countries like Costa Rica, Mexico and Sweden. An estimated 700,000 Bolivians were living in Argentina as of 2006 and another 33,000 in the United States. Central Americans living abroad in 2005 were 3,314,300, of which 1,128,701 were Salvadorans, 685,713 were Guatemalans, 683,520 were Nicaraguans, 414,955 were Hondurans, 215,240 were Panamanians and 127,061 were Costa Rica.

As of 2006, Costa Rica and Chile were the only two countries with global positive migration rates.

<text>Raymond Macherot (30 March 1924 – 26 September 2008) was a Belgian comics artist, most famous for his satirical funny animal series &quot;Chlorophylle&quot; and &quot;Sibylline&quot;. Although not nearly as famous as fellow Belgian cartoonists such as Hergé or André Franquin, Macherot&#x27;s work, both as artist and writer, remains highly regarded among critics and collectors.

==Biography==

===The &quot;Tintin&quot; years===
Raymond Macherot was born in Verviers, Belgium in 1924. He wanted to become a journalist or a painter but, for financial reasons, he became an illustrator and comics artist. Following the end of World War II, Macherot began his career producing a few cartoons in the style of Virgil Partch for the satirical weekly &quot;Pan&quot;, under the pseudonym &quot;Zara&quot;. In 1953, he joined the Franco-Belgian comics magazine &quot;Tintin&quot;, where he wrote a scenario for Fred Funcken&#x27;s &quot;Le chevalier blanc&quot; and made numerous illustrations and magazine covers.

In 1954, Macherot created the series &quot;Chlorophylle&quot;, featuring anthropomorphic animals. Macherot sets his first adventures in the countryside, where Chlorophylle, a dormouse, and his best friend Minimum, try to defeat animal villains often much bigger than themselves, typically led by the megalomaniac rat, Anthracite.

With &quot;Les croquillards&quot; (1957), Macherot placed his characters on the island of Croquefredouille, a fictitious country populated entirely with &quot;civilized&quot; animals, complete with technology, police, government, and so on. The action surrounds the introduction (by Anthracite, of course) of carnivorous animals to the island (the &#x27;croquillards&#x27; of the title). The story is darkly comic, with many characters ending up as gourmet meals for the predators. Strangely, Macherot&#x27;s publisher, Le Lombard, refused to release the &quot;Croquefredouille&quot; stories in book form until 1980.

Alternatively, in 1959, Macherot created &quot;Colonel Clifton&quot;, a series about a retired MI5 detective. He did three books worth of material, all the while continuing &quot;Chlorophylle&quot;, before calling it quits and moving to &quot;Spirou&quot; magazine, run by competitor-publisher Dupuis.

Le Lombard retained the rights to Macherot&#x27;s abandoned series. &quot;Chlorophylle&quot; was taken up with mild success by successive teams of authors, notably Dupa &amp; Greg, as well as Walli and Bob de Groot. As for &quot;Clifton&quot;, Turk &amp; De Groot turned the series into a relative hit.

===The &quot;Spirou&quot; years===
Macherot began his stint at &quot;Spirou&quot; with a new series, &quot;Chaminou&quot;, featuring a cat secret agent to the King, living in the country Zoolande. However, Chaminou&#x27;s first story, &quot;Chaminou et le Khrompire&quot; (1964), was unpopular and Macherot abandoned &quot;Chaminou&quot;. Closer to &quot;Chlorophylle&quot;, &quot;Sibylline&quot;, featured a female mouse and her fiancé Taboum. Many books have been published in this series, which enjoyed some success. From 1972 to 1976, Paul Deliège wrote the scenarios for &quot;Sibylline&quot;. Macherot ended the series upon his retirement in 1990.

Other series created by Macherot for &quot;Spirou&quot; include &quot;Pantoufle&quot; (with René Goscinny), &quot;Mirliton&quot; (with Raoul Cauvin), and as scenarist on &quot;Mulligan&quot; with Yvan Delporte and &quot;Isabelle&quot;, with Delporte and André Franquin. In the 1990s, &quot;Chaminou&quot; was revived, first by the team of Yann Lepennetier and Denis Bodart, and later by Olivier Saive, who completely redrew and augmented &quot;Chaminou et le Khrompire&quot; under Macherot&#x27;s supervision, splitting it in two volumes. As for &quot;Sibylline&quot;, the series was revived in 2006 by André Taymans for new adventures, also under Macherot&#x27;s supervision.

Raymond Macherot died on the night of 25 and 26 September 2008 in his sleep.

==Themes==
Although superficially gentle and innocent looking, many of Macherot&#x27;s strips are darker, and certainly more violent and ambiguous than they may seem. The main theme in his work is the struggle for . In Macherot&#x27;s world, animals live in a society of their own, and species must learn to coexist together peacefully. Macherot&#x27;s typical way to achieve this is to make vegetarianism mandatory for all. As a result, his villains are often natural predators who choose to ignore the law of the land. Additionally, Macherot&#x27;s intrigues often veer into the political, particularly during the so-called &quot;Croquefredouille cycle&quot; as well as in &quot;Chaminou et le Khrompire&quot;, and the subject of war is alluded to in many of his stories.

==Bibliography==
Not all of Macherot&#x27;s stories have been published in book form. When they were, they were not necessarily published in chronological order. This is particularly true with &quot;Chlorophylle&quot;. This list shows the original magazine publication order. The years indicate the initial publication date for each book.

<text>Mittweida () is a town in Saxony, Germany, in the Mittelsachsen district.

==Geography==
Mittweida is situated on the river Zschopau, 18 km north of Chemnitz, and 54 km west of Dresden. Embedded within the steep hills and valleys of the river and two smaller creeks, the town is green and picturesque.

Mittweida has a station on the Riesa–Chemnitz railway. A branch line, closed in 1997, served the industries in nearby Dreiwerden and Ringethal. Major roads are the state roads S200, S201, and S247, connecting the town with various federal roads and the motorway A4 which passes south-east of Mittweida.

==History==
The town was first mentioned in 1209. In 1286 it was known as &quot;civitas&quot; and &quot;oppidum&quot;. Weaving of wool and linen were major occupations of the inhabitants in the Middle Ages, and after a spinning mill was founded in 1816, the town grew into one of the major textile-producing centers in Saxony of the 20th century. Mittweida was already a sizeable town in the mid-16th century, and despite having more inhabitants than Rochlitz, it had remained part of Amt and Amtshauptmannschaft Rochlitz for many years. In 1924 it became a separate urban district. During World War II, a subcamp of Flossenbürg concentration camp was located in Mittweida. In 1946 the town was reintegrated into Landkreis Rochlitz and was transferred to Kreis Hainichen in 1952. Landkreis Mittweida was formed from the districts Rochlitz and Hainichen in 1994, it was integrated into Landkreis Mittelsachsen in 2008.

==Buildings and culture==
Of interest are the Gothic church from the 15/16th century, the old town, the historic and technical museums and the nearby Kriebstein castle.

Mittweida is home to a University of Applied Sciences with about 5000 students. Founded in the late 19th century, it is known far beyond the Saxon borders. Among its students were August Horch, Walter Bruch, Jørgen Skafte Rasmussen, and Gerhard Neumann.

<text>Mühldorf am Inn (Central Bavarian: &quot;Muihdorf am Inn&quot;) is a town in Bavaria, Germany, and the capital of the district Mühldorf on the river Inn. It is located at , and had a population of about 17,808 in 2005.

==History==
During the Middle Ages, the town and castle were an alod of the Luchen family. On 28 October 1287, Rapoto Luchen announced that he had entered an agreement with Archbishop Rudolph of Salzburg to hand over the alod, become the archbishop&#x27;s ministerialis, and thereafter run the lands as a fief of the Prince-Archbishops of Salzburg.

On 28 September 1322, the decisive Battle of Mühldorf was fought here between Bavaria and Salzburg. Before the battle, the Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg knighted several of the burghers of the town.

In 1802, Mühldorf became part of Bavaria.

During World War II, it was the site of the Mühldorf concentration camp complex. Several Allied air raids directed at the area were designed to target the rail links into Munich and disrupt the transportation of materiel from the &quot;Innwerk&quot; industrial park in Töging am Inn. Around 44 U.S. Air personnel are thought to have perished during the return flight following one of these raids. Civilian casualties are believed to be much higher due to many aircraft crews being unable to identify their primary objectives.

<text>Tripartite motif-containing protein 5 also known as RING finger protein 88 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the TRIM5 gene. The alpha isoform of this protein, TRIM5α, is a retrovirus restriction factor, which mediates a species-specific early block to retrovirus infection.

TRIM5α is composed of 493 amino acids which is found in the cells of most primates. TRIM5α is an intrinsic immune factor important in the innate immune defense against retroviruses, along with the APOBEC family of proteins, tetherin and TRIM22.

== Structure ==

TRIM5α belongs to the TRIM protein family (TRIM stands for TRIpartite Motif); this family was first identified by Reddy in 1992 as a set of proteins which contain a RING type zinc finger domain, a B-box zinc binding domain, followed by a coiled-coil region. TRIM5α bears the C-terminal PRY-SPRY or B30.2 domain in addition to the other domains.

==Function and means of action==

When a retrovirus enters the host cell cytosol, the retroviral capsid was previously believed to undergo uncoating, though this (the complete uncoating theory) is now doubted; rather the true picture is thought to be that capsid uncoating does indeed take place in the cytosol but that it is a process which takes place progressively as the capsid gets closer and closer to the nucleus, though the uncoating process usually, but not always, completes in the nucleus. Further, the viral genome in the capsid is reverse transcribed inside the viral capsid to enable the production of daughter virions.

TRIM5α is present in the cytosol. It recognizes motifs within viral capsid proteins, which causes the TRIM5α to smother the (not yet uncoated) viral capsid in a tessilatory manner so as to form a repeating regular hexagonal net, two sides of each hexagon being made up of two spokes of a three-way hub and spoke trimer and consequently by means of that smothering to interfere with any viral capsid uncoating process, thereby (1) preventing transport of the viral genome into the host cell nucleus and (2) also preventing successful reverse transcription of viral RNA into a length of DNA to be spliced into the host genome to enable expression of viral proteins via a transcrption process. The exact mechanism of action has not been shown conclusively, but capsid protein from restricted viruses (that is viruses which are the subject of TRIM5α intervention) is removed by proteasome-dependent degradation. The TRIM5α, once formed into its highly regular reticulatory net recruits ubiquitin for this purpose, which, in turn engages the proteasome.

The involvement of other cellular proteins in the inhibition mediated by TRIM5α is suspected but as yet not demonstrated. However, Cyclophilin A is important for the inhibition of HIV-1 by TRIM5α in Old World monkey species.

The &quot;specificity&quot; of restriction, that is, whether a given retrovirus can be targeted by TRIM5α, is entirely determined by the amino acid sequence of the C-terminal domain of the protein, called the B30.2/PRY-SPRY domain. Amino acid 332, which occurs within this domain, seems to play a critical role in determining the specificity of retrovirus restriction.

TRIM5α may have played a critical role in the human immune defense system about 4 million years ago, when the retrovirus PtERV1 was infecting the ancestors of modern chimpanzees. While no trace of PtERV1 has yet been found in the human genome, about 130 traces of PtERV1 DNA have been found in the genome of modern chimpanzees. After recreating part of the PtERV1 retrovirus, it was reported that TRIM5α prevents the virus from entering human cells &quot;in vitro&quot;. While this cellular defense mechanism may have been very useful 4 million years ago when facing a PtERV1 epidemic, it has the side effect of leaving cells more susceptible to attack by the HIV-1 retrovirus. Recently, doubt has been cast over these conclusions. By using a PtERV1 capsid, which produces higher titer virus-like particles, Perez-Caballero &quot;et al.&quot; reported that PtERV1 is not restricted by either human or chimpanzee TRIM5α.

== Clinical significance ==
Rhesus macaques, a species of Old World monkeys, appeared to be almost completely resistant to HIV-1, the virus that causes AIDS in humans. The Rhesus macaques version of TRIM5α was very quick and had a high enough affinity to the incoming HIV capsule that it could bind and degrade it quickly so that the virus was neutralized.

Humans also have a TRIM5α, but it is not well enough tuned to mediate a sufficient response. However, the human version of TRIM5α can inhibit strains of the murine leukemia virus (MLV) as well as equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV).

Prior to the discovery of TRIM5α as an antiviral protein, the inhibition phenotype had been described and coined Ref1 (in human cells) and Lv1 (in monkey cells). This terminology is now largely abandoned.

A related protein, named TRIMCyp (or TRIM5-CypA), was isolated in the owl monkey, a species of New World monkey, and shown to potently inhibit infection by HIV-1. A similar protein has arisen independently in Old World monkeys and has been identified in several species of macaque.

It was recently described that interferon-α-mediated stimulation of the immunoproteasome enables human TRIM5α for effective capsid-dependent inhibition of HIV-1 DNA synthesis and infection.

<text>Teton Pass is a high mountain pass in the western United States, located at the southern end of the Teton Range in western Wyoming, between Wilson and Victor, Idaho. At an elevation of above sea level, the pass provides access from the Jackson Hole valley in Wyoming to the Teton Valley of eastern Idaho, including the access route to Grand Targhee Resort through Driggs, Idaho. To the south of the pass lies the Snake River Range.

The Teton Pass highway in Wyoming is designated as State Highway 22 and the pass is approximately out of Jackson. The maximum grade on the road is 10%, and several avalanche slide paths traverse the road along its length, including Glory Bowl slide area. During the winter months, the road is often closed in the early mornings for avalanche control by the Wyoming Department of Transportation. The area is popular for backcountry skiing, snowboarding, and mountain biking.

The pass is a few miles south of Grand Teton National Park; parts of the route to the pass are located in the Caribou-Targhee National Forest and in the Bridger-Teton National Forest. The small town of Wilson sits at the base of the east side of the pass, while Teton Village and the Jackson Hole Mountain Resort ski area are northeast of the pass.

At the state line at approximately , it becomes Idaho State Highway 33 and continues northwest to Victor, then north to Driggs.

== 2024 collapse ==
On the morning of June 6, 2024, large cracks formed in the road near milepost 12.8 of the Teton Pass highway. The road was temporarily closed with the hope that the road could be patched. However, two days later on June 8, the cracked section of the Teton Pass highway collapsed.

Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon declared an emergency in the region, citing the significant impact the collapse had on commuters and the local residents and economy. The impact on commuters was significant, as the alternate route between Jackson and Victor, Idaho requires a &gt;60 mile (97 km) detour.
On June 28, the highway reopened with a slight detour while work continues.

<text>Nienburg (, official name: &quot;Nienburg/Weser&quot;; , or ) is a town and capital of the district Nienburg, in Lower Saxony, Germany.

==Geography==
Situated on the scenic German Timber-Frame Road, Nienburg lies on the river Weser, approximately southeast of Bremen, and northwest of Hanover. Nienburg is the largest town in the Middle Weser Region.

==Demography==


===Structure===
Nienburg, including quarters
* Erichshagen
* Holtorf
* Langendamm
* Schäferhof/Kattriede
* Nordertor
* Leintor
* Lehmwandlung
* Alpheide

==History==
The major reason for the emergence and development of Nienburg into the largest city in the Middle Weser region was its location at a convenient ford in the Weser River, leading to multiple trade routes radiating from the location. As early as 1025 the location was referred to as &quot;Negenborg&quot;, i.e. New Castle. In 1215 it began to be referred to as a city, a &quot;civitas&quot;, when Count Henry I of Hoya began the residence of his ruling line. From 1582 until 1866 the Guelph (&quot;Welf&quot;) Dukes of Brunswick-Lüneburg controlled the county, except for Napoleonic French rule from 1803 to 1813. In 1871, it became part of the German Empire.

During World War II, it was the location of German prisoner-of-war camps Oflag X-B and Stalag X-C, in which French, Polish, Belgian, Romanian, Serbian, Italian and Soviet POWs were held.

In the wake of the war, a large number of livestock was killed in the region by an unknown predator, called &quot;Lichtenmoor Strangler&quot;.

The former County of Wölpe was the seat of the Grafen (counts) von Wölpe with its associated castle. The castle (Burg Wölpe) was destroyed in the Hildesheim Diocesan Feud in 1522. 

==Politics==
===Mayor===
Since the 2021 elections, the mayor is Jan Wendorf (independent). The previous mayor was Henning Onkes (independent). He was reelected in 2014 against three competitors.

===Local council (Stadtrat)===
The 38 members of the &quot;Stadtrat&quot; are divided among:

<text>Osterode am Harz, often simply called Osterode (; Eastphalian: &quot;Ostroe&quot;), is a town in south-eastern Lower Saxony in central Germany on the south-western edge of the Harz mountains. It was the seat of government of the district of Osterode. Osterode is located on the German Timber-Frame Road.

==Geography==

===Water===
The Söse River flows through the town from the reservoir for the Söse Dam about 5 km upstream. The dam was built in 1931 and has a capacity of 25.5 million m³. The Harzwasserwerke water company pipes drinking water as far away as Bremen.

===Districts===
The following districts (mainly surrounding villages) are part of the borough of Osterode am Harz, with populations in brackets (as of 1 July 2012):
* Dorste (1,650)
* Düna (140)
* Förste (2,000)

==History==

Osterode was granted town rights in the early 13th century. Defensive walls were built in the 13th century, and then expanded by 1330. In 1510, it was the site of riots and the townspeople murdered the town&#x27;s mayor. In response, Duke Philip I held a court session, after which the leaders of the riots were sentenced, town property was confiscated and municipal privileges were revoked. In 1545, the town suffered a fire. Frequent marches of troops and marauders, looting, high war taxes, epidemics etc. devastated the town during the Thirty Years&#x27; War of 1618–1648. Since 1665, Osterode belonged to the domain of the House of Hanover, which also ruled Great Britain.

In 1807 the town became part of the Napoleonic Kingdom of Westphalia, in 1813 it passed to the Kingdom of Hanover (in union with Britain), in 1866 it was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia, and from 1871 it formed part of the German Empire. In 1905, the town had a population of 7,467.

The Great Depression caused a collapse of numerous local business, which led to mass unemployment and radicalisation of the people, and in 1933 the Nazi Party gained a majority in Osterode. During World War II, from 1939 to 1941, Osterode was the location of the Oflag XI-A prisoner-of-war camp for Polish officers, which was eventually relocated to Włodzimierz in German-occupied Poland, and, from 1944 to 1945, there was also a subcamp of the Buchenwald concentration camp for men of various nationalities. In April 1945, Osterode was captured by American troops. Following the war, it formed part of West Germany.
==Political==

===Local council===
The Gemeinderat or council of Osterode has 34 members:
*SPD: 16
*CDU: 12
*Grüne: 3
*FDP: 3


and one Bürgermeister (mayor).
(local election on 11 September 2016)

===Mayor===
Jens Augat (SPD) has been &quot;Bürgermeister&quot; (mayor) of Osterode since 1 November 2019.

==Culture and attractions==

===Museums===
The &quot;Museum im Ritterhaus&quot; displays documents from Osterode&#x27;s history from the Middle Ages to the recent past, as well as occasional temporary exhibitions.

The Lichtenstein Cave is an archaeological site near Dorste, in the western part of the municipality. Two inhabitants of the village Nienstedt am Harz, 2 km north of the cave, have the same rare DNA pattern as that found in the skeletal material of a man whose bones were found in the Lichtenstein Cave dating to about 1000 BC.

===Architecture===


In the environs of Osterode there are several castle ruins, and
Lichtenstein Castle between Dorste and Förste.

The town granary built between 1719 and 1722 is one of the most imposing buildings, built to supply the mining villages in the Upper Harz with grain. Today after a comprehensive renovation it has become the town hall. It is decorated with a bas-relief featuring the 18th-century coat of arms of Great Britain.

===Recreation===
Osterode is the starting point of the 100 km long Harzer Hexenstieg, a hiking trail to Thale.

==Transport==
The B 243 federal route, built as a divided highway, is the main western link between the northern and southern Harz area. B 241 and B 498 link Solling to the eastern Harz.

Osterode lies on the Herzberg–Seesen railway, with services to Brunswick. In November 2004 the town gained two new stations at a cost of about 1 million Euro, replacing two previous halts and providing a more central access to public transport.

<doc id="1333695" wikidata="Q3506608" url="?curid=1333695" title="Requiem for Methuselah">
<text>&quot;Requiem for Methuselah&quot; is the nineteenth episode of the third season of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Written by Jerome Bixby and directed by Murray Golden, it was first broadcast on February 14, 1969.

In the episode, the crew of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; encounters an immortal human.

Its repeat broadcast, on September 2, 1969, was the last official telecast of the series to air on NBC. &quot;Star Trek&quot; immediately appeared in syndication on the following Monday, September 8, a full three years after its debut.

==Plot==
The crew of the Federation starship &quot;Enterprise&quot; is struck with deadly Rigellian fever, for which the only treatment is the mineral ryetalyn. Captain Kirk, first officer Spock and medical officer Dr. McCoy beam down to the planet Holberg 917-G in search of the substance and are attacked by an airborne robot, which is called off by its master, Flint. Flint demands they leave immediately, but Kirk orders the &quot;Enterprise&quot; to fire phasers on their coordinates if they are attacked. Acknowledging a stalemate, Flint agrees to let them remain long enough to obtain the ryetalyn.

Flint offers the help of his sentry robot M4 to gather the mineral and escorts them to his home, which has an impressive art collection. Spock notices that the brushwork of the paintings is identical to Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s, but his tricorder indicates that they are made with modern materials.

The party is introduced to Flint&#x27;s young ward, Rayna Kapec, whose late parents, according to Flint, were employees of his. On Flint&#x27;s suggestion, Kirk plays billiards with Rayna, and they dance to a waltz played on the piano by Spock. The music, apparently in the hand of Johannes Brahms, is written with modern ink. M4 returns with a container of ryetalyn, but it is contaminated with irilium, and therefore useless. Flint apologizes and accompanies M4 on a search for more ryetalyn.

When Kirk kisses Rayna, M4 reacts as if he were attacking her. Spock destroys it with his phaser. The &quot;Enterprise&quot; reports that no information can be found on Flint or Rayna. A tricorder scan reveals that Flint is over 6,000 years old.

Rayna comes to say goodbye to Kirk, who has fallen in love with her and begs her to accompany him. McCoy tells them that after being processed in Flint&#x27;s laboratory, the ryetalyn vanished. Spock follows tricorder readings to a laboratory chamber containing not only the ryetalyn, but a number of android bodies, all labeled &quot;Rayna&quot; and with a different number indicating earlier versions of her.

Flint reveals the truth. He was born in 3834 BC, and after falling in battle discovered he could not die. Flint has lived &quot;lifetimes&quot; as Methuselah, Alexander the Great, Solomon, Lazarus of Bethany, Leonardo da Vinci, Brahms, and many others. He built Rayna to be his immortal mate and manipulated Kirk into teaching her how to love. Paranoid about the possibility that the &quot;Enterprise&quot; crew would reveal him and his location, Flint causes the &quot;Enterprise&quot; to disappear from orbit and reappear as a tabletop miniature in his laboratory, with the crewmembers in suspended animation. He proposes to keep them that way for up to 2,000 years. Rayna happens into the room and vehemently objects, so he restores the starship to its previous state. When Kirk professes his love for Rayna and pleads with her to leave with him, a fight breaks out between him and Flint for the possession of Rayna. Rayna stops them, claiming her right to choose her own future, and then, overwhelmed by indecision for fear of hurting either Kirk or Flint, dies.

Back on the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, McCoy reports that readings from the earlier tricorder scan show that Flint has been aging normally since he left Earth&#x27;s environment, and will soon die. Kirk falls asleep on his desk after commenting ruefully on Rayna&#x27;s fate, and Spock places a suggestion to &quot;forget&quot; into his mind.

==Production and reception==
Rayna&#x27;s last name, &quot;Kapec&quot;, is an anagram of Capek, after Karel Čapek, whose play &quot;R.U.R.&quot; (&quot;Rossum&#x27;s Universal Robots&quot;, 1920) introduced the term &quot;robot&quot;.

===Reception===
In a 2010 review, Zack Handlen of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; criticized the Rigellian fever scenario as contrived and wrote that Flint being numerous famous men from history was both completely irrelevant and contradictory to his claim that he had kept a low profile to avoid his immortality being discovered. He said that though the final scene is a highlight, it is undermined by Kirk&#x27;s obsessive love for Rayna being so out-of-character as to be unbelievable. He gave the episode a C, summing it up as &quot;forgettable&quot;. In 2017, Den of Geek ranked &quot;Requiem for Methuselah&quot; as the 15th &quot;best worst&quot; &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot; episode, echoing Handlen&#x27;s criticism that Kirk falling so intensely in love with Rayna over the course of just four hours was highly out-of-character.

===Analysis===
According to fantasy and science fiction scholar Ace G. Pilkington, &quot;Requiem for Methuselah&quot; is a &quot;Star Trek&quot; adaptation of the film &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; (1956). Actress Anne Francis reported that Gene Roddenberry, the creator of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, had talked to her about lifting some ideas from &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot;. Actor Leslie Nielsen noted the similarities between &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; and &quot;Star Trek&quot;, suggesting that the film served as a pilot for the television series.

Ruth Morse, a Shakespearean scholar, has written on the influence of &quot;The Tempest&quot; on &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; and &quot;Requiem for Methuselah&quot;. Flint, the powerful recluse, seems to be based on Prospero and Methuselah. Rayna appears to be Flint&#x27;s daughter and is based on Miranda, Prospero&#x27;s daughter. The twist here is that &quot;Rayna-Miranda&quot; (as Morse calls her) is an android, not Flint&#x27;s daughter. Flint hopes that the female android will fall in love with him. Flint offers knowledge and intellectual stimulation but Rayna falls for the &quot;irresistible&quot; Kirk. The female android faces new and (to her) unfamiliar emotions, having to choose between two men. The pressure causes her to short-circuit into self-destruction, her version of death.

==40th anniversary remastering==
This episode was remastered in 2006 and aired June 21, 2008 as part of the remastered &quot;Original Series&quot;. It was preceded a week earlier by the remastered &quot;The Way to Eden&quot; and followed a week later by the remastered &quot;The Savage Curtain&quot;. Changes made specific to this episode include:
* Flint&#x27;s home is now a large palatial home, complete with observation tower. Originally, Flint&#x27;s home was represented by a reuse of the matte painting of Rigel VII from &quot;The Cage&quot;.
* Planet Holberg 917-G is now more realistic, with two moons orbiting behind it.
* The effect of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; being miniaturized from space is remastered.

==In other media==
In several non-canonical &quot;Star Trek&quot; novels, the crew meet up again with the character Flint. &quot;The Cry of the Onlies&quot; by Judy Klass is a follow-on from both &quot;Requiem for Methuselah&quot; and &quot;Miri&quot;. He is also encountered in Greg Cox&#x27;s &quot;The Eugenics Wars: The Rise and Fall of Khan Noonien Singh&quot; as Dr. Evergreen, a 1980s scientist who discovers a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, in &quot;Immortal Coil&quot; by Jeffrey Lang, and in &quot;Federation&quot; by Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens as Zefram Cochrane&#x27;s benefactor Micah Brack.

The author of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; screenplay, Jerome Bixby, would write a film script at the end of his life which has many plot elements of this previous story, including an ageless man who is 14,000 years old, and has been a student of the Buddha, while he himself was the basis for the story of Jesus. This film, &quot;The Man from Earth&quot;, was released in 2007.

In the crossover comic &quot;Star Trek/Legion of Super-Heroes&quot;, the crew of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; joins forces with the Legion of Super-Heroes to investigate an alternative timeline where Earth has become a galaxy-conquering empire, learning that the villain is immortal Vandal Savage, who turns out to be an alternative version of Flint, Flint being a Vandal Savage who turned his back on violence and conquest.

The character of Rayna appears briefly twice without speaking as a hallucination in Episode 4 of &quot;Star Trek Continues&quot;, &quot;The White Iris&quot;, this time played by Gabriela Fresquez, Spock&#x27;s removal of Kirk&#x27;s memory having been loosened by a brain injury and an experimental drug. Since &quot;Star Trek Continues&quot; follows directly from the end of the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series, presumably &quot;The White Iris&quot; occurs only a few weeks after the events of &quot;Requiem for Methuselah&quot;.

== Home video releases ==
This episode was released in Japan on December 21, 1993 as part of the complete season 3 LaserDisc set, &quot;Star Trek: Original Series log.3&quot;. A trailer for this and the other episodes was also included, and the episode had English and Japanese audio tracks. The cover script was スター・トレック TVサードシーズン

This episode was included in &quot;TOS&quot; Season 3 remastered DVD box set, with the remastered version of this episode.

<doc id="1333704" wikidata="Q5025154" url="?curid=1333704" title="Cambodian Freedom Fighters">
<text>The Cambodian Freedom Fighters (CFF; ) is an anti-communist political and paramilitary organization that was established on 21 October 1998, by its founder, Chhun Yasith, at Poipet near the Cambodian-Thai border. Their headquarters are in Long Beach, California, United States. It was incorporated and registered at the Californian Secretary of State&#x27;s office as a political organization in June 1999, and aims &quot;to fight against communists to protect the interests of Cambodian people.&quot; The CFF claim to have 500 members in the United States and up to 20,000 supporters in the Kingdom of Cambodia. The group orchestrated a 2000 Cambodian coup d&#x27;état attempt.

==History and attacks==
The military branch of the CFF emerged in November 1998, in the wake of political violence that saw many influential Cambodian leaders flee and the Cambodian People&#x27;s Party assume power. 
With the objective of overthrowing the government, the group is led by a Cambodian-American, a former member of the opposition Sam Rainsy Party, includes Cambodian-Americans based in Thailand and the United States and former soldiers from the separatist Khmer Rouge, Royal Cambodian Armed Forces, and various conservative political factions. In the wake of the violence, more than 200 people, including Richard Kiri Kim, were arrested by the Cambodian police.

On 19 September 2000, a grenade was thrown by two men on a motorcycle at a phone booth. Four people were killed and nine injured in the attack. Although they did not claim the incident, the government saw the CFF as suspects.

In 24 November 2000, two attacks were registered eight people were killed and at least fourteen wounded when as many as seventy anti-government rebels stormed state offices and battled security forces in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. The rebels threw grenades and used AK-47&#x27;s in an exchange of fire with soldiers and police outside the Ministry of Defense and Cabinet buildings, and ten men launched an assault on a military barracks approximately 15 kilometers (nine miles) west of the capital. There were no reports of casualties or damage. Police believed that the attacks were perpetrated by the anti-government group, the Cambodian Freedom Fighters.

After the attacks Cambodian courts have jailed several dozen people for their roles in the attacks in trials that have been widely criticized as unfair. During the arrests of CFF suspects after the November 2000 raids, Cambodian human rights groups and opposition political parties accused the Government of arbitrarily arresting and jailing several legitimate party figures on charges of being CFF members. In December 2000, Human Rights Watch reported that, within two weeks after the November attacks, over 200 people had been arrested all over Cambodia, most without a warrant (6 December 2000). &quot;Many of those arrested or detained are affiliated with the royalist Funcinpec Party of the opposition Sam Rainsy Party (SRP)&quot;, Human Rights Watch reported (6 December 2000). In its 2002 annual report on human rights practices in Cambodia, Human Rights Watch stated that another 50 CFF suspects had been arrested in September 2001 in the provinces and Phnom Penh, and that &quot;human rights groups expressed concern that the government&#x27;s response to the CFF&#x27;s November 2000 attack in Phnom Penh could be used as a pretext to intimidate opposition party members, particularly as the commune election campaign began to get underway&quot;.On 22 June 2001, the Cambodian Criminal Court handed down their verdict on the Cambodian Freedom Fighters’ attack of 24 November 2000. An Mao, Nou Saron, and three Cambodian-Americans (Richard Kiri Kim, Thong Samien, and Chhun Yasith) were sentenced to life in prison on charges of conspiring to commit terrorism. Chhun Yasith and Thong Samien were tried &quot;in absentia&quot;.

A year later the 1 November 2001, a series of bombings that included four improvised explosive devices which detonated near the governor&#x27;s office, other near a deputy governor&#x27;s home and other more near in the provincial prison in Pursat, Pursat province, Cambodia. No one was injured and there was only minor damage as a result of the explosion. Authorities suspect the involvement of CFF.

Twenty-four other men and one woman were found guilty of various charges and given prison terms ranging from three to 20 years. Among them were two prominent former Khmer Rouge commanders, Seng Narin and Tumlap Mil, who each received 15 years in prison.

==Politics==
The Cambodian Freedom Fighters have chosen not to participate in the election process in Cambodia because they state Prime Minister Hun Sen belonged to the ultra-left Khmer Rouge and he has rigged the election process in Cambodia. They have chosen to remove Hun Sen&#x27;s government militarily because they believe he and his regime are guilty of corruption in the election process in collaboration with the Communist Vietnamese that placed Hun Sen in power in 1989.

In 2008, Chhun Yasith, founder of the Cambodian Freedom Fighters, was tried and convicted in the U.S., in relation to masterminding the 2000 coup attempt. CFF&#x27;s exact strength is unknown, but totals probably never has exceeded 500 armed fighters. CFF operates in Northeastern Cambodia near the Thai border. Its U.S. based leadership collects funds from the Cambodian-American community.

==Finances==
The Cambodian Freedom Fighters collect operating funds through active solicitation of donations from the Cambodian-American community in the United States and Cambodian refugees in Europe.

<doc id="1333705" wikidata="Q7570223" url="?curid=1333705" title="Southern Ontario Gothic">
<text>Southern Ontario Gothic is a subgenre of the Gothic novel genre and a feature of Canadian literature that comes from Southern Ontario. This region includes Toronto, Southern Ontario&#x27;s major industrial cities (Windsor, London, Hamilton, Kitchener, St. Thomas, Oshawa, St. Catharines), and the surrounding countryside. While the genre may also feature other areas of Ontario, Canada, and the world as narrative locales, this region provides the core settings.

==Overview==
The term was first used in Graeme Gibson&#x27;s &quot;Eleven Canadian Novelists&quot; (1972) to recognize an existing tendency to apply aspects of the Gothic novel to writing based in and around Southern Ontario. In an interview with Timothy Findley, Gibson commented that Findley&#x27;s novel &quot;The Last of the Crazy People&quot; shared similarities with the American Southern Gothic genre, to which Findley replied, &quot;...sure, it&#x27;s Southern Gothic: Southern &quot;Ontario&quot; Gothic.&quot;

Notable writers of this subgenre include Alice Munro, Margaret Atwood, Robertson Davies, Jane Urquhart, Marian Engel, James Reaney, and Barbara Gowdy.

== Characteristics ==
Like the Southern Gothic of American writers such as William Faulkner, Flannery O&#x27;Connor and Eudora Welty, Southern Ontario Gothic analyzes and critiques social conditions such as race, gender, religion and politics, but within the context of Southern Ontario. Southern Ontario Gothic is generally characterized by a stern realism set against the dour small-town Protestant morality stereotypical of the region, and often has underlying themes of moral hypocrisy. Actions and people that act against humanity, logic, and morality all are portrayed unfavourably, and one or more characters may be suffering from some form of mental illness. In a review of Alice Munro&#x27;s &quot;Dear Life&quot; for &quot;Quill &amp; Quire&quot;, literary critic James Grainger writes that &quot;Violence, illness, and reputations ruined by a single indiscretion are accepted in Munro’s secretive, repressed communities as a kind of levelling mechanism, rough justice for those who dare to strive for something finer.&quot; The Gothic novel has traditionally examined the role of evil in the human soul, and has incorporated dark or horrific imagery to create the desired setting. Some (but not all) writers of Southern Ontario Gothic use supernatural or magic realist elements; a few deviate from realism entirely, in the manner of the fantastical gothic novel. Virtually all dwell to a certain extent upon the grotesque.

Often, these elements are combined to highlight themes present in the wider canon of Canadian literature. An overarching sense of displacement either socially, physically or psychologically often sets the stage for supernatural elements, transgressive behavior or inner turmoil. Accompanying displacement is a nightmarish feeling of spiritual imprisonment in a Southern Ontario setting that is characterized by an eroding societal value system and an atmosphere that stifles and fears individual means of expression. Many sources of terror and horror are created when a character tries to break free of the strictures of established norms within these communities. This lends itself to a motif of &#x27;Canadian&#x27; survival that is applied to scenarios dependent on enduring abstract horrors which originate from within a character who is often living in a small village, town or city of the region. In a review of Cynthia Sugars&#x27; book &quot;Canadian Gothic: Literature, History and the Spectre of Self-Invention&quot;, Amy Ransom claims that Southern Ontario Gothic seeks to tell the stories of generations of settlers in a way that uses elements of the taboo, the surreal and the fantastical to form a new common identity in a postcolonial world. For example, the family of prolific Southern Ontario Gothic author, Alice Munro, originally settled on Huron lands which were a basis of many of her shorter works. Writer David Ingham, in contrast, critiques Southern Ontario Gothic as having &quot;little or nothing to distinguish it from everyday, garden-variety type realism.&quot; Likewise, critics like Gerry Turcotte, Greg Loannou, and Lynne Missen, have questioned the presence of truly gothic supernatural elements in Canadian literature.

==Postcolonial perspective==
A key feature of Southern Ontario Gothic is its reckoning with the region’s history of colonization. Often gothic elements like the uncanny, supernatural, and hauntings are used to reinvigorate memories of past traumas that have been covered up with revisionist history. Regional gothic literature, such as Southern Ontario Gothic, makes allusions to specific places through landmarks, architecture, vernacular, etc. This is distinct from other forms of Gothic that are set in arbitrarily chosen places. Because colonization is a necessarily geographic endeavor, this aspect is particularly important to Southern Ontario Gothic which tends to indicate a specific location that has been colonized and is now haunted by the remnants of its past. The conflict between colonial settlers and the Canadian wild is also an important aspect of Southern Ontario Gothic. In the early stories of Canadian Gothic, the decaying abandoned castles of traditional Gothic literature were substituted with the uninhabited Canadian wild. In this setting, white settlers are haunted by the land they have stolen and are in a constant battle to preserve their sense of “civilization” in the wild.

== Notable works ==
Notable works of the genre include Davies&#x27; &quot;Deptford Trilogy&quot;, Findley&#x27;s &quot;Headhunter&quot;, Atwood&#x27;s &quot;Alias Grace&quot; and &quot;The Blind Assassin&quot;, and Munro&#x27;s &quot;Selected Stories&quot;.

<doc id="1333724" wikidata="Q723621" url="?curid=1333724" title="Paul Nizan">
<text>Paul-Yves Nizan (; 7 February 1905 – 23 May 1940) was a French philosopher and writer.

He was born in Tours, Indre-et-Loire and studied in Paris where he befriended fellow student Jean-Paul Sartre at the Lycée Henri IV. He became a member of the French Communist Party, and much of his writing reflects his political beliefs, although he resigned from the party soon after the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact in 1939. He died in the Battle of Dunkirk, fighting against the German army in World War II.

His works include the novels &quot;Antoine Bloye&quot; (1933), &quot;Le Cheval de Troie&quot; [&quot;The Trojan Horse&quot;] and &quot;La Conspiration&quot; [&quot;The Conspiracy&quot;] (1938), as well as the essays &quot;Les Chiens de garde&quot; [&quot;The Watchdogs&quot;] (1932) and &quot;Aden Arabie&quot; (1931), which introduced him to a new audience when it was republished in 1960 with a foreword by Sartre. In particular, the opening sentence &quot;I was twenty, I won&#x27;t let anyone say those are the best years of your life&quot; (&quot;J’avais vingt ans. Je ne laisserai personne dire que c’est le plus bel âge de la vie.&quot;) became one of the most influential slogans of student protest during May &#x27;68.

==Life==
Nizan was born to a middle-class family, his father having worked in rail prior to the First World War. Nizan&#x27;s father&#x27;s course through the bureaucracy of French industry would later form the basis of &quot;Antoine Bloye&quot;, and serve as a significant point of development for Nizan&#x27;s understanding of social alienation.

He interrupted his studies at the École Normale Supérieure of the University of Paris in 1926 to leave for Aden where he worked as tutor to the son of French-born businessman-millionaire Antonin Besse. He drew upon his six-month experience in Aden to write his first novella, &quot;Aden Arabie&quot;, published in 1931. Nizan then entered into a number of miscellaneous jobs around the French Communist Party (PCF), writing for its journal prominently and even, at one point, running a party bookshop in Paris. Nizan later took up a professorship teaching literature, during which time he took on a reputation among students as an affable and relaxed professor, sometimes even offering his students cigarettes during class. As a teacher, he was reticent about his own perspective on Marxist theory, instead encouraging his students to arrive independently at their own conclusions. Through this period, up to the onset of World War II, Nizan penned all of his major works, including &quot;The Watchdogs&quot;, an exposé on materialist philosophy, and the novels &quot;Antoine Bloye&quot; and &quot;The Conspiracy&quot;.

In August 1939, he broke with the French Communist Party following the signing of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. His motive was not a moral judgment against the USSR; on the contrary, he criticized the French Communist Party for having lacked cynicism:
Given his active participation in the anti-fascist movement, as well as his commitment to the republican cause of the Spanish Civil War, Nizan could not accept the party&#x27;s rapid shift against the Popular Front. Soon thereafter, Nizan enlisted to fight in the French army with the onset of World War II, and was killed in action on 23 May 1940 at the Château de Cocove in Recques-sur-Hem, during the German offensive against Dunkirk.

==Politics==

Nizan&#x27;s politics took a number of sporadic turns throughout the course of his life, with Sartre noting that Nizan in his youth had vacillated between fascist and communist sympathies, attracted to both extremes of the political spectrum. Nizan also approached the priesthood as a young man but soon turned away from that decision. Eventually, Nizan settled on membership in the French Communist Party, under whose auspices Nizan&#x27;s public life as an author began. Within the party, Nizan wrote extensively for official communist publications and had his works sold in party bookstores, although his most celebrated work today is his fiction. In his various novels, Nizan explores modern alienation, as well as the situation of the radical petit-bourgeois milieu caught between contending class forces. While Nizan was a loyal adherent to the policies of the Communist Party, his writings anticipate elements of postwar radical existentialism, leaving the contemporary reader with an ambiguous image of Nizan&#x27;s political standing.

<doc id="1333727" wikidata="Q1189456" url="?curid=1333727" title="Emergent evolution">
<text>Emergent evolution is the hypothesis that, in the course of evolution, some entirely new properties, such as mind and consciousness, appear at certain critical points, usually because of an unpredictable rearrangement of the already existing entities. The term was originated by the psychologist C. Lloyd Morgan in 1922 in his Gifford Lectures at St. Andrews, which would later be published as the 1923 book &quot;Emergent Evolution&quot;.

The hypothesis has been widely criticized for providing no mechanism to how entirely new properties emerge, and for its historical roots in teleology. Historically, emergent evolution has been described as an alternative to materialism and vitalism. Interest in emergent evolution was revived by biologist Robert G. B. Reid in 1985.

Emergent evolution is distinct from the hypothesis of Emergent Evolutionary Potential (EEP) which was introduced in 2019 by Gene Levinson. In EEP, the scientific mechanism of Darwinian natural selection tends to preserve new, more complex entities that arise from interactions between previously existing entities, when those interactions prove useful, by trial-and error, in the struggle for existence. Biological organization arising via EEP is complementary to organization arising via gradual accumulation of incremental variation.

==Historical context==
The term &quot;emergent&quot; was first used to describe the concept by George Lewes in volume two of his 1875 book &quot;Problems of Life and Mind&quot; (p. 412). Henri Bergson covered similar themes in his popular 1907 book &quot;Creative Evolution&quot; on the Élan vital. Emergence was further developed by Samuel Alexander in his Gifford Lectures at Glasgow during 1916–18 and published as &quot;Space, Time, and Deity&quot; (1920). The related term &quot;emergent evolution&quot; was coined by C. Lloyd Morgan in his own Gifford lectures of 1921–22 at St. Andrews and published as &quot;Emergent Evolution&quot; (1923). In an appendix to a lecture in his book, Morgan acknowledged the contributions of Roy Wood Sellars&#x27;s &quot;Evolutionary Naturalism&quot; (1922).

== Origins ==

=== Response to Darwin&#x27;s &quot;Origin of Species&quot; ===

Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace&#x27;s presentation of natural selection, coupled to the idea of evolution in Western thought, had gained acceptance due to the wealth of observational data provided and the seeming replacement of divine law with natural law in the affairs of men. However, the mechanism of natural selection described at the time only explained how organisms adapted to variation. The cause of genetic variation was unknown at the time.

St. George Jackson Mivart&#x27;s &quot;On the Genesis of Species&quot; (1872) and Edward Cope&#x27;s &quot;Origin of the Fittest&quot; (1887) raised the need to address the origin of variation between members of a species. William Bateson in 1884 distinguished between the origin of novel variations and the action of natural selection (&quot;Materials for the Study of Variation Treated with Especial Regard to Discontinuity in the Origin of Species&quot;).

=== Wallace&#x27;s further thoughts ===

Wallace throughout his life continued to support and extend the scope of Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution via the mechanism of natural selection. One of his works, &quot;Darwinism&quot;, was often cited in support of Darwin&#x27;s theory. He also worked to elaborate and extend Darwin and his ideas on natural selection. However, Wallace also realized that, as Darwin himself had admitted, the scope and claim of the theory was limited:

In examining this aspect, excluded &quot;ab initio&quot; by Darwin, Wallace came to the conclusion that Life in its essence cannot be understood except through &quot;an organising and directive Life-Principle.&quot; These necessarily involve a &quot;Creative Power&quot; possessed of a &quot;directive Mind&quot; working toward &quot;an ultimate Purpose&quot; (the development of Man). It supports the view of John Hunter that &quot;life is the cause, not the consequence&quot; of the organisation of matter. Thus, life precedes matter and infuses it to form living matter (protoplasm).

Wallace then refers to the operation of another power called &quot;mind&quot; that utilizes the power of life and is connected with a higher realm than life or matter:

Proceeding from Hunter&#x27;s view that Life is the directive power above and behind living matter, Wallace argues that logically, Mind is the cause of consciousness, which exists in different degrees and kinds in living matter.

== Emergent evolution ==

=== Early roots ===
The issue of how order emerged from primordial chaos, by chance or necessity, can be found in classical Greek thought. Aristotle asserted that a whole can be greater than the sum of its parts because of emergent properties. The second-century anatomist and physiologist Galen also distinguished between the resultant and emergent qualities of wholes. (Reid, p. 72)

Hegel spoke of the revolutionary progression of life from non-living to conscious and then to the spiritual and Kant perceived that simple parts of an organism interact to produce a progressively complex series of emergences of functional forms, a distinction that carried over to John Stuart Mill (1843), who stated that even chemical compounds have novel features that cannot be predicted from their elements. [Reid, p. 72]

The idea of an entirely novel emergent quality was further taken up by George Henry Lewes (1874–1875), who reiterated Galen&#x27;s distinction between evolutionary &quot;emergent&quot; qualities and adaptive, additive &quot;resultants.&quot; Henry Drummond in &quot;The Descent of Man&quot; (1894) stated that emergence can be seen in the fact that the laws of nature are different for the organic or vital compared to inert inorganic matter.

As Reid points out, Drummond also realized that greater complexity brought greater adaptability. (Reid. p. 73)

Samuel Alexander took up the idea that emergences had properties that overruled the demands of the lower levels of organization. And more recently, this theme is taken up by John Holland (1998):

=== C. Lloyd Morgan and emergent evolution ===
Another major scientist to question natural selection as the motive force of evolution was C. Lloyd Morgan, a zoologist and student of T.H. Huxley, who had a strong influence on Samuel Alexander. His &quot;Emergent Evolution&quot; (1923) established the central idea that an emergence might have the appearance of saltation but was best regarded as &quot;a qualitative change of direction or critical turning point.&quot;(quoted in Reid, p. 73-74) Morgan, due to his work in animal psychology, had earlier (1894) questioned the continuity view of mental evolution, and held that there were various discontinuities in cross-species mental abilities. To offset any attempt to read anthropomorphism into his view, he created the famous, but often misunderstood methodological canon:

However, Morgan realizing that this was being misused to advocate reductionism (rather than as a general methodological caution), introduced a qualification into the second edition of his &quot;An Introduction to Comparative Psychology&quot; (1903):

As Reid observes,

Morgan also fought against the behaviorist school and clarified even more his emergent views on evolution:

His &quot;Animal Conduct&quot; (1930) explicitly distinguishes between three &quot;grades&quot; or &quot;levels of mentality&quot; which he labeled: &#x27;percipient, perceptive, and reflective.&#x27; (p. 42)

=== Alexander and the emergence of mind ===

Morgan&#x27;s idea of a polaric relationship between lower and higher, was taken up by Samuel Alexander, who argued that the mental process is not reducible to the neural processes on which it depends at the physical-material level. Instead, they are two poles of a unity of function. Further, the neural process that expressed mental process itself possesses a quality (mind) that the other neural processes don’t. At the same time, the mental process, because it is functionally identical to this particular neural process, is also a vital one.

And mental process is also &quot;something new, &quot;a fresh creation&quot;, which precludes a psycho-physiological parallelism. Reductionism is also contrary to empirical fact. At the same time Alexander stated that his view was not one of animism or vitalism, where the mind is an independent entity action on the brain, or conversely, acted upon by the brain. Mental activity is an emergent, new &quot;thing&quot; not reducible to its initial neural parts.

For Alexander, the world unfolds in space-time, which has the inherent quality of motion. This motion through space-time results in new “complexities of motion” in the form of a new quality or emergent. The emergent retains the qualities of the prior “complexities of motion” but also has something new that was not there before. This something new comes with its own laws of behavior. Time is the quality that creates motion through Space, and matter is simply motion expressed in forms in Space, or as Alexander says a little later, “complexes of motion.” Matter arises out of the basic ground of Space-Time continuity and has an element of “body” (lower order) and an element of “mind” (higher order), or “the conception that a secondary quality is the mind of its primary substrate.”

Mind is an emergent from life and life itself is an emergent from matter. Each level contains and is interconnected with the level and qualities below it, and to the extent that it contains lower levels, these aspects are subject to the laws of that level. All mental functions are living, but not all living functions are mental; all living functions are physico-chemical, but not all physico-chemical processes are living - just as we could say that all people living in Ohio are Americans, but not all Americans live in Ohio. Thus, there are levels of existence, or natural jurisdictions, within a given higher level such that the higher level contains elements of each of the previous levels of existence. The physical level contains the pure dimensionality of Space-Time in addition to the emergent of physico-chemical processes; the next emergent level, life, also contains Space-Time as well as the physico-chemical in addition to the quality of life; the level of mind contains all of the previous three levels, plus consciousness. As a result of this nesting and inter-action of emergents, like fluid Russian dolls, higher emergents cannot be reduced to lower ones, and different laws and methods of inquiry are required for each level.

For Alexander, the &quot;directing agency&quot; or entelechy is found &quot;in the principle or plan&quot;.

While an emergent is a higher complexity, it also results in a new simplicity as it brings a higher order into what was previously less ordered (a new simplex out of a complex). This new simplicity does not carry any of the qualities or aspects of that emergent level prior to it, but as noted, does still carry within it such lower levels so can be understood to that extent through the science of such levels, yet not itself be understood except by a science that is able to reveal the new laws and principles applicable to it.


The concept or idea of mind, the highest emergent known to us, being at our level, extends all the way down to pure dimensionality or Space-Time. In other words, time is the “mind” of motion, materialising is the “mind” of matter, living the “mind” of life. Motion through pure time (or life astronomical, mind ideational) emerges as matter “materialising” (geological time, life geological, mind existential), and this emerges as life “living” (biological time, life biological, mind experiential), which in turn give us mind “minding” (historical time, life historical, mind cognitional). But there is also an extension possible upwards of mind to what we call Deity.

Alexander goes back to the Greek idea of knowledge being “out there” in the object being contemplated. In that sense, there is not mental object (concept) “distinct” (that is, different in state of being) from the physical object, but only an apparent split between the two, which can then be brought together by proper compresence or participation of the consciousness in the object itself.

Because of the interconnectedness of the universe by virtue of Space-Time, and because the mind apprehends space, time and motion through a unity of sense and mind experience, there is a form of knowing that is intuitive (participative) - sense and reason are outgrowths from it.


In a sense, the universe is a participative one and open to participation by mind as well so that mind can intuitively know an object, contrary to what Kant asserted. Participation (togetherness) is something that is “enjoyed” (experienced) not contemplated, though in the higher level of consciousness, it would be contemplated.

===Robert G. B. Reid===

Emergent evolution was revived by Robert G. B. Reid (March 20, 1939 - May 28, 2016), a biology professor at the University of Victoria (in British Columbia, Canada). In his book &quot;Evolutionary Theory: The Unfinished Synthesis&quot; (1985), he stated that the modern evolutionary synthesis with its emphasis on natural selection is an incomplete picture of evolution, and emergent evolution can explain the origin of genetic variation. Biologist Ernst Mayr heavily criticized the book claiming it was a misinformed attack on natural selection. Mayr commented that Reid was working from an &quot;obsolete conceptual framework&quot;, provided no solid evidence and that he was arguing for a teleological process of evolution. In 2004, biologist Samuel Scheiner stated that Reid&#x27;s &quot;presentation is both a caricature of evolutionary theory and severely out of date.&quot;

Reid later published the book &quot;Biological Emergences&quot; (2007) with a theory on how emergent novelties are generated in evolution. According to Massimo Pigliucci &quot;Biological Emergences by Robert Reid is an interesting contribution to the ongoing debate on the status of evolutionary theory, but it is hard to separate the good stuff from the more dubious claims.&quot; Pigliucci noted a dubious claim in the book is that natural selection has no role in evolution. It was positively reviewed by biologist Alexander Badyaev who commented that &quot;the book succeeds in drawing attention to an under appreciated aspect of the evolutionary process&quot;. Others have criticized Reid&#x27;s unorthodox views on emergence and evolution.

<doc id="1333732" wikidata="Q4958339" url="?curid=1333732" title="Brave (1994 film)">
<text>Brave is a 1994 musical film directed by Richard Stanley and based on the 1994 concept album &quot;Brave&quot; by English progressive rock band Marillion.

==History and production==
In 1994, Marillion released their seventh studio album &quot;Brave&quot;. A concept album inspired by a news story singer/lyricist Steve Hogarth had heard about an amnesiac girl found wandering the Severn Bridge, the album follows a fictional account of the girl&#x27;s life and the events that led her there. After the release of the album, Marillion expressed a desire to create a video out of the album&#x27;s concept in a manner comparable to Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;The Wall&quot;.

Cult film director Richard Stanley, intrigued by the concept, agreed to sign on as the project&#x27;s director. He disassociates himself from the film. Mark Kelly said in an interview 2013: &quot;&quot;It took me to a website that had an interview with Richard Stanley, who was the director of our Brave movie. I didn&#x27;t know this, but apparently he basically said, &quot;I disown that piece of work because they took what was a short piece of film and turned it into something much longer.&quot; I suppose there is some truth in that, in the sense that he was working with a very small budget – I say &quot;small budget&quot;, it was about £100k – to try to make a movie that covered 70 minutes, which is the Brave album. It was more than the budget could cope with, if you know what I mean. But anyway, I think working with Richard Stanley is probably the closest we&#x27;ve ever come to devil&#x27;s music, he&#x27;s definitely got a bit of the devil in him, cos he&#x27;s made some really dark films.&quot;&quot;

Kelly said to Dave Everley in Classic Rock Magazine: &quot;It wasn&#x27;t a good film to be honest. I&#x27;m not blaming Stanley, because the budget he had to work with was minuscule. It could have worked really well with him making that movie. It just didn&#x27;t.&quot;

The music videos for &quot;Brave&quot;″s three singles - &quot;The Great Escape&quot;, &quot;Hollow Man&quot; and &quot;Alone Again in the Lap of Luxury&quot; - were taken from this film. The run time of the film is 57 minutes; both the original VHS release and the 2004 re-issue on DVD additionally include a 30 minutes &quot;making-of&quot; documentary.

==Plot==
The film tells the story in pictures accompanied by the entire &quot;Brave&quot; record minus &quot;Paper Lies&quot; and the final song &quot;Made Again&quot;. On the recording, it is left ambiguous as to whether the main character, played by Josie Ayers, commits suicide in the end. In the film, she does. Thus, &quot;Made Again&quot;, which concludes the story on the record as a happy ending of sorts, is not included.

On the back of the cover of the videocassette, the description reads as follows:

:&quot;Brave.. The Movie is a fifty-minute concept film directed by cult movie director Richard Stanley. It is Stanley&#x27;s stark vision of a young life in the 90&#x27;s inspired by Marillion&#x27;s album of the same name, which centres around a teenage girl who is found wandering in a state of amnesia on the Severn Bridge, and her consequent search for her past. Although this story bears similarities to actual recorded incidents in the history of the Severn Bridge we wish to stress that this is a work of fiction.&quot;

On the bottom of the cover, the final lines are:

&quot;Watch it loud with the lights off.&quot;

<text>Richard FitzRoy (c. 1190 – June 1246) (&quot;alias&quot; Richard de Chilham and Richard de Dover) was the illegitimate son of King John of England and was feudal baron of Chilham, in Kent. His mother was Adela de Warenne, his father&#x27;s first cousin and a daughter of Hamelin de Warenne by his wife Isabel de Warenne, 4th Countess of Surrey.

Richard served in his father&#x27;s army as a captain during the baronial revolt. In 1216 he was made constable of Wallingford Castle. The following year he took a prominent part in a naval battle off the Kent coast.

Richard had scutage for Poitou in 1214. By right of his wife he became Lord of Chingford, Little Wyham and Great Wenden, all in Essex, and Lesnes, Kent, and Lutton, Northamptonshire. However, in 1229 their manor of Chingford Earls was temporarily in the hands of a creditor, Robert de Winchester. In 1242 they leased the advowson of Chingford to William of York, Provost of Beverley.

Before 11 May 1214, Richard married Rohese de Dover, daughter and heiress of Fulbert de Dover by his spouse Isabel, daughter of William Briwere. Their children were:

# Richard de Dover, feudal baron of Chilham, married Matilda, 6th Countess of Angus
# Isabella, married 1247 Sir Maurice de Berkeley of Berkeley, Gloucestershire. 
# Lorette (d. bef. 1265), married 1248 Sir William Marmion, 2nd Baron Marmion of Winteringham and of Tanfield, Yorkshire.

Richard&#x27;s widow remarried, between 1250 and 1253, William de Wilton (killed at the Battle of Lewes), a prominent justice. She died shortly before 11 February 1261, when there was a grant of her lands and heirs to the Queen, Eleanor of Provence. Rohese&#x27;s heart was buried at Lesnes Abbey.

<text>James Ravilious (22 August 1939 – 29 September 1999), was a British photographer, who specialised in recording the rural life of north Devon.

==Early life==
James Ravilious was born in Eastbourne, the second son of the artists Eric Ravilious and Tirzah Garwood, and educated at Bedford School. Following the death of his father in the Second World War, in March 1944 Garwood moved her young children to Boydells Farm, near Wethersfield, Essex, then following her remarriage to Henry Swanzy to Adelaide Road, Hampstead before her death from cancer on 27 March 1951. He was then raised by John Swanzy, his stepfather&#x27;s brother.

Having studied as an accountant, Ravilious made a career change and entered St Martin&#x27;s School of Art in London, under the assumed name of Souryer in 1959. He subsequently worked as a teacher at Hammersmith College for seven years.

==Photography==
Inspired by an exhibition of the work of French photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson, Ravilious took up photography shortly after moving with his wife to Devon in the 1970s. He was asked to contribute work to the Beaford Archive, a means of documenting images to show the lifestyle associated with a small area of North Devon. What began as a short-term project turned into a 17-year quest. Ravilious made some 80,000 black and white images for Beaford Arts, and preserved some 5,000 old photographs of the area. The archive is an internationally important collection. An exhibition of his work &quot;The English Countryside&quot; was shown at Royal Photographic Society&#x27;s Octagon exhibition space in 1981.

==Personal life==
In 1970 Ravilious married Caroline (known as Robin) Whistler, daughter of glass-engraver and poet Laurence Whistler. They had two children and collaborated on books together.

James Ravilious died age 60 on 29 September 1999.

<doc id="1333748" wikidata="Q131160309" url="?curid=1333748" title="Natal Day">
<text>Natal Day is a non-statutory holiday in Nova Scotia, Canada, celebrated on the first Monday in August. It coincides with other Civic Holidays across Canada.

== History ==
Natal Day was originally celebrated on June 21, to commemorate the establishment of Halifax.

The tradition may have been created by the Nova Scotia Philanthropic Society who inaugurated an annual picnic in 1839 to celebrate the founding of Halifax.

Historical celebrations included; pig, sheep, and ox roasts, horse races, regattas, track and field event (hurdles, high jump, foot races etc.), greasy pig contests, and greasy pole contests among others. Public drunkenness was a frequent issue with reports on Natal Day of 1894 of civilians sneaking beer from the military canteen which ultimately led to a drunken brawl between civilians and soldiers. In 1876 reports from McNab&#x27;s Island picnic reported &quot;there was not much enjoyment there... for drunkenness and fighting prevailed generally, and there were many bruised faces and black eyes&quot; and a new word &#x27;jubilated&#x27; was coined to refer to the drunk and disorderly - with those completely unable to celebrate due to drunkenness being referred to as jubilous.

The first official Natal Day celebrations were held in August 1895 to mark the arrival of the new branch railroad line connecting to Dartmouth. While the rail construction was delayed, Dartmouth moved forward with a regatta and fireworks display.

In 1897, Natal Day celebrations corresponded with Queen Victoria&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee. During the week long celebration which fell over June 21, the &#x27;Jubilee&#x27; or &#x27;Nymph&#x27; Fountain was unveiled in the Halifax Public Gardens by Ishbel, Marchioness of Aberdeen and Temair, the wife of John Campbell Gordon, 7th Earl of Aberdeen and Governor-General of Canada (1893-98).

The name Natal Day gained popularity in 1899 with the publication of Centenary Ode, by Halifax poet laureate John A. Bell on the 150th anniversary of the founding of Halifax.

By 1906, Halifax declared a half-holiday on the same day as Dartmouth’s Natal Day, solidifying the tradition of an August celebration.
== Celebrations ==
Natal Day weekend is marked by events across Nova Scotia including parades, picnics, concerts, local markets, street performers, fireworks, and a local road race.

The National historic site Fort Anne in Annapolis Royal hosts encampment reenactments of 18th century British military camps over Natal Day weekend as well as a historic parade.

Since 1907, Dartmouth has hosted the Dartmouth Natal Day Road Race making it one of the oldest road running races in North America. The event was added to celebrate Dartmouthian Chris Wolfe running the Boston Marathon.

== Controversy ==
Natal Day&#x27;s status as a non-statutory holiday or retail closing day is the source of some controversy. While the Civic Holiday is recognized as a statutory holiday by government offices, many unionized employers and several other provinces (including British Columbia, New Brunswick, Northwest Territories, Nunavut and Saskatchewan) - it is not a mandated or paid holiday in Nova Scotia. City services are often reduced and employers may opt to close without paying employees, in addition, employees who are scheduled to work do not have the right to refuse. Nova Scotia ties P.E.I. and Newfoundland &amp; Labrador for the lowest number of public holidays in Canada with six.

In 1931 a statue of Edward Cornwallis was unveiled in downtown Halifax over Natal Day weekend to commemorate the 182nd anniversary of the founding of Halifax. In July 2017, protests surrounding the removal of the statue - due to Cornwallis&#x27; treatment of indigenous people, the 1749 scalp proclamation, and it&#x27;s general homage to colonial history - demanded the city remove the statue by Natal Day. While city officials, including mayor Mike Savage, initially disagreed, the statue was subsequently removed and place in temporary storage in January 2018 in consultation with local First Nations after threats were made to tear the statue down during an upcoming planned protest.

<text>The first USS &quot;Patterson&quot; (DD-36) was a modified in the United States Navy during World War I and later in the United States Coast Guard, designated as CG-16. She was named for Daniel Patterson.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Patterson&quot; was laid down on 29 March 1910 by William Cramp &amp; Sons at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She was launched on 29 April 1911, sponsored by Miss Georgeanne Pollock Patterson, and commissioned on 11 October 1911.

==Pre-World War I==
&quot;Patterson&quot; departed Philadelphia on 23 October 1911, calling at Newport, Rhode Island, and New York City, before arriving at Boston on 2 November, her homeport for operations off the New England Coast, the Virginia Capes, and south to Charleston, South Carolina; Pensacola, Florida; and Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. She arrived off Vera Cruz from Pensacola on 20 May 1914 and headed home four days later.

==World War I==
As America entered World War I, &quot;Patterson&quot; patrolled along the New England Coast in the approaches to Newport and Boston to safeguard inbound trans-Atlantic convoys. One patrol mission took her as far north as St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland.

The first United States help to the hard-pressed allies was the assignment of US destroyers to the British Fleet to help combat enemy submarines that threatened to cut the sea lifelines to the British Isles. &quot;Patterson&quot; was the flagship of the second division of destroyers to cross the Atlantic on this mission. But the destroyers could not make it across the North Atlantic without refueling. Newly commissioned fleet oiler , whose executive officer and chief engineer was Lieutenant Chester W. Nimitz, stationed herself in mid-Atlantic, between Boston and Queenstown, Ireland.

&quot;Patterson&quot; led Division 5 out of Boston Harbor on 21 May 1917 and made rendezvous with &quot;Maumee&quot; the morning of 28 May. She was the first destroyer to maneuver alongside &quot;Maumee&quot; to receive fuel oil enabling her to complete the Atlantic crossing. The division arrived Queenstown, Ireland, on 1 June 1917. There &quot;Patterson&quot; and her sister destroyers received British signal books and depth charges.

&quot;Patterson&quot; began patrol and escort in the approaches to Queenstown on 5 June. On 12 June, she dropped depth charges to help drive away a German U-boat attacking SS &quot;Indian&quot;. A collision with His Majesty&#x27;s tug &quot;Dreadful&quot; at the entrance to Berehaven Harbour, Ireland, the night of 1 January 1918, damaged &quot;Patterson&#x27;s&quot; bow but she resumed regular escort and patrol on 5 February. Two days later she rescued 12 survivors of steamship &quot;Mexico City&quot;, torpedoed by a German submarine. &quot;Patterson&quot;, patrolling in the Irish Sea on 17 May, dropped depth charges that drove away German . She continued patrol out of Queenstown until 4 June, then departed for the United States.

On 16 June, one day out of Bermuda, &quot;Patterson&quot; rescued survivors of the Norwegian bark &quot;Kringsjaa&quot;, sunk by the German submarine . She landed the survivors at the Cape May Naval Station and continued on to the Philadelphia Navy Yard at Philadelphia, arriving on 18 June for overhaul. She departed Norfolk, Virginia, on 17 August 1918 for Tompkinsville, New York. There she joined the escort of the battleship bound for Norfolk. On 22 August 1918, she got underway from Norfolk as flagship of the “&quot;Patterson&quot; Group”, a special hunting squadron that included 11 submarine chasers. The &quot;Patterson&quot; Group hunted German U-boats north from the Virginia Capes to New York.

During the predawn hours of 27 August 1918, the American armed cargo ship SS &quot;Felix Taussig&quot; mistook the Patterson Group submarine chaser for a German submarine in the Atlantic Ocean south of Long Island, New York, and opened gunfire on &quot;SC-209&quot;, hitting her with two shells. &quot;SC-209&quot; caught fire and sank in only three minutes at with the loss of two officers and 16 men. The submarine chaser rescued &quot;SC–209&quot;′s five survivors, four of whom were wounded. &quot;Patterson&quot; and two other submarine chasers searched the area but found no more survivors. &quot;Felix Taussig&quot; stood by to render assistance until &quot;Patterson&quot; directed her to continue her voyage to New York City. It was the U.S. Navy&#x27;s largest loss of life in a single friendly fire incident during World War I. &quot;Patterson&quot; carried the wounded survivors into New York Harbor for transfer to the U.S. Navy hospital ship .

&quot;Patterson&quot; dropped depth charges to drive away a German U-boat on 3 September 1918, continuing antisubmarine warfare patrols along the United States East Coast until the special hunting group disbanded on 23 November 1918, twelve days after the armistice with Germany brought World War I to an end.

==Inter-war period==
&quot;Patterson&quot; entered the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 1 January 1919, remaining there until she was transferred to the United States Coast Guard on 28 April 1924. She was stationed at Stapleton, New York, and served as USCGC &quot;Patterson&quot; on the Rum Patrol during Prohibition in the United States.

Returned to the Navy on 18 October 1930, &quot;Patterson&quot; remained inactive until her name was cancelled on 1 July 1933 to permit its assignment to . Her hulk was sold for scrapping on 2 May 1934 in accordance with the London Naval Treaty. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 28 June.

<text>Joseph Franz Hedwig Loeckx (4 May 1937 – 7 February 2023) was a Belgian comic book artist. He worked under the pseudonym of Jo-El Azara. Important series he worked on include &quot;Clifton&quot; and &quot;Taka Takata&quot;.

==Biography==
Loeckx was born in Drogenbos, Flemish Brabant, near Brussels, Belgium, on 4 May 1937.

Loeckx is sometimes referred to as Joseph-R. Loeckx in error. During his working life, first he used the penname of Jo-El, subsequently Ernest, and thereafter worked as Jo-El Azara, under which name he has drawn most of his comics.

A long career of working with the great names in Belgian and French comics, including Hergé, Macherot, and Uderzo, he was active in publishing his own &quot;Taka Takata&quot; albums under his Azéko label.

Loeckx lived in the south of France, close to the Pyrenees. His lifelong partner, Josette Baujot, died on 13 August 2009. He died on 7 February 2023, at the age of 85.

<doc id="1333770" wikidata="Q470109" url="?curid=1333770" title="Cortaderia selloana">
<text>Cortaderia selloana is a species of flowering plant in the family Poaceae. It is referred to by the common name pampas grass, and is native to southern South America, including the Pampas region after which it is named. It is widely distributed throughout the world as a cultivated ornamental and invasive species.

==Etymology==
&quot;Cortaderia&quot; is derived from the Argentine Spanish name &#x27;cortadera&#x27;, meaning &#x27;cutter&#x27;, in reference to its razor sharp leaf margins.

&quot;Selloana&quot; is named for Friedrich Sellow (1789–1831), a German botanist and naturalist from Potsdam who worked as a plant collector in Brazil. He studied the flora of South America, especially that of Brazil. The specific epithet &quot;selloana&quot; was given by Josef August and Julius Hermann Schultes in 1827.
== Ecology ==
The native range of &quot;C. selloana&quot; includes Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay. This region is dominated by tropical forests and grasslands, but C. selloana is typically restricted to moist soil within riparian areas. It is found at lower elevations and at moister sites than the closely related C. jubata. It requires areas with plentiful light and soil moisture. It is a common invasive species in temperate regions around the world, where it can be found growing in moist, disturbed soil. 

=== Control ===
Pampas grass can be controlled through herbicide treatment. To accomplish this, the grass is cut down near the base. Next, a 2% glyphosate chemical solution is combined with a silicone-based surfactant and applied to enhance the penetration potential. This method works best in the fall because there is overall better control compared to other seasons. Another control method is to cut and bag inflorescences to prevent seeds from spreading or pulling seedlings.

==Cultivation==
Several cultivars are available, of which the following have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit:
*Aureolineata 
*Evita 
*Monstrosa 
*Patagonia 
*Pumila 
*Silver Feather Notcort 
*Sunningdale Silver—grows to a height of and has particularly dense flowering plumes

==Population biology==
Okada &quot;et al.&quot;, 2007 find &quot;C. selloana&quot; populations are best distinguished by a Bayesian analysis of genetic features such as microsatellites. Algorithms such as STRUCTURE are suitable for this.

==In culture==
Author Li Hengrui (), whose work &quot;Kite Capriccio&quot; () describes life as a child in 1950s Fengtai County, Anhui mentions the use of the long stem of the &quot;Puwei&quot; (, Chinese for &quot;Cortaderia selloana&quot;) in the construction of kites.

Several media outlets reported in the 2010s that it was planted by some couples who practise swinging in the United Kingdom as a way to indicate to other swingers that they enjoy that lifestyle. The reports caused a plunge in already declining sales, but the odd association has been dismissed by enthusiasts of the plant and gardening experts as &quot;silly&quot;.

==Diseases==
O&#x27;Donnell &quot;et al.&quot;, 2004 first isolated &quot;&quot; from this species. &quot;F. cortaderiae&quot; is the cause of Fusarium head blight (FHB) of &quot;C. selloana&quot;.

<text>Scott Matthew Parker (born 13 October 1980) is an English professional football manager and former player who is head coach of EFL Championship club Burnley.

Parker began his career at Charlton Athletic, and was loaned to Norwich City, before joining Chelsea for a £10 million fee in January 2004. He did not play regularly at Chelsea, and moved to Newcastle United the following year, where he was made captain. Parker joined West Ham United in 2007, and was the FWA Footballer of the Year for the 2010–11 season despite the club being relegated. He was then signed by Tottenham Hotspur and joined Fulham in 2013. He would play 119 league matches for Fulham in both the Premier League and the Championship, before retiring at the end of the 2016–17 season.

Parker has represented England at every level from under-16 to senior, making his full debut in 2003. Uniquely, he won his first four England caps while playing for four different clubs. Parker was a member of the England team which reached the quarter-finals at UEFA Euro 2012.

Parker was appointed caretaker manager of Fulham in February 2019, and hired on a permanent basis that summer. In his first season in charge, he guided them to promotion to the Premier League after winning the Championship play-offs, but they were relegated back the following season. He then left to join AFC Bournemouth in 2021, and again won promotion from the Championship in his first season. After a 9–0 loss to Liverpool in the club&#x27;s fourth league game of the season, he was dismissed, and then hired by Club Brugge, from which he was sacked after 12 games in March 2023. In July 2024 he was appointed as head coach of Burnley.

==Early life==
Scott Matthew Parker was born on 13 October 1980 in Lambeth, Greater London, and attended Haberdashers&#x27; Aske&#x27;s Hatcham College in New Cross. As a 13-year-old, he appeared in a well-known English advert for McDonald&#x27;s, in which he played keepie uppie, during the 1994 FIFA World Cup campaign. Parker is a graduate of The Football Association&#x27;s now-defunct national School of Excellence at Lilleshall.

==Club career==
===Charlton Athletic===
After graduating from Lilleshall, Parker signed for Charlton Athletic as a trainee and made his first-team debut as a substitute against Bury in the First Division on 23 August 1997, a match which ended 0–0. He signed his first professional contract with the club two months later. Over the next couple of years he made only a few sporadic substitute appearances for Charlton, although he was one of the brightest prospects in English football. In October 2000, Charlton, then in the Premier League, loaned Parker to First Division club Norwich City for two months to give the England under-21 international some first-team experience. At Norwich he scored once against Sheffield Wednesday. On his return to The Valley, Parker was immediately called into the first team to replace injured captain Mark Kinsella. Parker played so well for Charlton that, upon his return from injury, Kinsella could not regain his place in the starting line-up. Parker soon became the linchpin of Charlton&#x27;s midfield, combining tenacious tackling with an ability to carry the ball quickly from defence to attack and play telling passes, creating many chances for his teammates.

===Chelsea===
Parker, who had been consistently linked with moves away from Charlton for several years, finally left the Valley on 30 January 2004 to join Chelsea on a four-and-a-half-year contract for a £10 million fee. Alan Curbishley, the Charlton manager, criticised his attitude following news of Chelsea&#x27;s interest, accusing him of bad behaviour and saying that &quot;...his conduct in training has not been what it should have been.&quot; Parker was initially signed as cover for Claude Makélélé and Frank Lampard, but did not get too many chances to play in his preferred position. He scored his only goal for Chelsea in a 2–0 win against Portsmouth at Fratton Park on 11 February. At the end of the 2003–04 season, Parker was named as the PFA Young Player of the Year.

Following the summer signings of Arjen Robben and Tiago Mendes, Parker&#x27;s first-team opportunities were limited during 2004–05. Although he found first-team opportunities hard to come by at Chelsea, he was a regular starter in Chelsea&#x27;s League Cup matches, a competition where he played in three consecutive victories against West Ham, Newcastle and Fulham. His problems were compounded when he broke a metatarsal bone in a match against his former club, Norwich City. Due to this injury, Parker missed both legs of the League Cup semi-final against Manchester United and the final against Liverpool, although he took part in the celebrations.

===Newcastle United===
Parker was sold the following summer, moving to Newcastle United in July 2005 for a £6.5 million fee. He became a regular in the Newcastle first team and was one of the few players at the club to show any consistency during an often difficult season in which Newcastle finished in seventh place, despite having a very poor start under Graeme Souness. His first Newcastle goal came against his former club Charlton in a 3–1 defeat on 25 March 2006. Later that month he was diagnosed with glandular fever, putting an end to his season. The timing was especially unfortunate for Parker, who had been playing well for Newcastle, as it ended any hopes he may have had of forcing his way into the 2006 FIFA World Cup.

In July 2006, he was named Newcastle United&#x27;s new captain by manager Glenn Roeder, succeeding the retired Alan Shearer. His first goal as captain came against Wigan Athletic on 19 August 2006, in a 2–1 win on the first day of the season. Parker scored his second goal of the season against Fulham in September 2006, but after he was substituted Newcastle conceded 2 goals and subsequently lost the match. Despite Newcastle&#x27;s poor form, his performances earned him a recall to the England squad in September after an absence of more than two years. In November, Parker scored a goal in the 116th minute against Watford in the League Cup and then scored in the penalty shoot-out to allow Newcastle to progress in the competition. He scored his fourth goal of 2006–07 against Tottenham Hotspur in December 2006.

Scott Parker was found to be the second best player in the country for December 2006 by Sky Sports and Opta Index. He led Newcastle on their way to UEFA Intertoto Cup victory and was presented with the Intertoto Cup plaque in March 2007 before the UEFA Cup first-leg tie with AZ.

===West Ham United===
In June 2007, West Ham United signed Scott Parker for a £7 million fee. Due to injury, he did not make his first-team debut until 26 September 2007 in the 1–0 League Cup victory against Plymouth Argyle. His full Premier League debut came on 29 September 2007 in the 1–0 home defeat to Arsenal, a match which saw Parker sustaining another injury and being substituted for Hayden Mullins at half-time. Parker scored his first goal for West Ham, a last-minute winner in the 2–1 win at Middlesbrough on 22 December 2007.

In 2008–09, Parker played a major part of West Ham&#x27;s season and on 24 May 2009 was voted Hammer of the Year, by the club&#x27;s supporters. and became the first player since Julian Dicks in 1997 to retain the award after winning again on 4 May 2010.

He was again one of West Ham&#x27;s key players in 2009–10, scoring the winning goal in a vital 3–2 win against Wigan Athletic, which ensured another season of Premier League football for West Ham.

In July 2010, West Ham chairman David Sullivan stated that Parker was not for sale to another club at any price. This came after a bid from Tottenham Hotspur and also public interest from Aston Villa. In September 2010 Parker signed a new, five-year, contract with West Ham which also made him the highest paid player in the club&#x27;s history.

Parker scored three goals in his first six appearances in 2010–11. His goals came in matches against Oxford United, Chelsea, and Stoke City. He is widely regarded as one of the most consistent English midfielders over the last few years. There were calls from England supporters and Avram Grant for the midfielder to be included in England&#x27;s squad and feature on a regular basis.

On 12 February Carlton Cole praised Scott Parker&#x27;s &quot;inspirational&quot; pep talk at half time after, being 3–0 down, West Ham earned a 3–3 draw against West Bromwich Albion. Cole was quoted as saying of the talk &quot;If you were there you would have had a tear in your eye&quot;. Parker was named Premier League Player of the Month for February 2011 following his performances in West Ham&#x27;s 3–1 wins over Blackpool and Liverpool. Following his performances for West Ham despite their relegation, and his England recall, Parker was placed on the six-strong shortlist for the prestigious PFA Players&#x27; Player of the Year Award. He missed out on the PFA award but was named the FWA Footballer of the Year.

Parker started the first four matches of 2011–12 for West Ham United in the Championship and scored his first goal of the season, and tenth league goal for the club against Watford on 16 August 2011.

Amid speculation that Tottenham Hotspur would sign the player, Parker handed West Ham co-owner David Gold a hand written transfer request, saying &quot;I have had a fantastic four years at West Ham United and will never forget all the support I have had from the fans and everyone associated with the club.&quot;
&quot;The manager and board have tried hard to convince me to stay but at this stage in my career, I need to be playing in the Premier League, especially now that I am involved with England.&quot;
&quot;I hope the fans will understand and respect my decision and I wish the club every success in their fight for promotion this season.&quot;

===Tottenham Hotspur===
On 31 August 2011, Tottenham and West Ham both announced the transfer of Parker to Spurs, with the fee believed to be £5.5 million. Tottenham said &quot;We are delighted to announce that we have reached agreement with West Ham United for the permanent transfer of Scott Parker.&quot; With Scott Parker playing for Tottenham Hotspur, it meant that he was the only player to represent clubs in North, East, South and West London in the Premier League. On 10 September 2011 Parker made his Spurs&#x27; debut, providing an assist for fellow debutant Emmanuel Adebayor. He made his home debut the following week in a 4–0 win over Liverpool. Parker finished his first four matches for Tottenham on the winning team. He captained them in a 2–1 away win over Blackburn on 23 October. Parker finished his first season at Tottenham being named as their Player of the Year for the 2011–12 season. Parker was injured on international duty before the start of 2012–13 and did not make his first appearance of the season until 16 December as a 90th-minute substitute.

American journalist William Saletan had high praise for Parker&#x27;s defensive skills after seeing the QPR match in person at White Hart Lane. &quot;Parker doesn&#x27;t score or get credited with assists. He leaves that to the guys up front,&quot; he wrote.
===Fulham===
On 19 August 2013, Parker signed a three-year contract with Fulham, for an undisclosed fee. On 23 November 2013, Parker was made captain for the match against Swansea City in the absence of Brede Hangeland, and scored his first goal for them in the 2–1 loss at Craven Cottage. Fulham were relegated at the end of the season. Parker retired from playing in June 2017.

==International career==
Parker represented England at every level from under-16 to the senior team. He earned nine caps for the England under-21 team.

Parker&#x27;s international debut for the senior England team came on 16 November 2003 when he came on in the 66th minute as a substitute replacing Wayne Rooney in a 3–2 defeat against Denmark.

His form earned him a place in the starting line-up for England&#x27;s European Championships qualifier away to Croatia on 11 October 2006. In a 3–5–2 formation Parker was restricted to tracking back and covering due to the attacking players in the team like Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard. England boss Steve McClaren specifically told Parker to chase the wingers and assist the two wing backs, Gary Neville and Ashley Cole. England lost 2–0 and Parker would not feature again for England for four and a half years.

On 11 May 2010, Parker was revealed to be among manager Fabio Capello&#x27;s 30-man preliminary squad list for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. However, he was not included in the final 23-man squad.

Parker came on as a second-half substitute for Frank Lampard in a friendly against Denmark on 9 February 2011 to become the first player to receive his first four full caps whilst playing for four teams. On 26 March that year, he played in the Millennium Stadium against Wales in the qualifiers for UEFA Euro 2012 and was recognised as one of England&#x27;s top players in the victory, acting as a holding midfielder in Capello&#x27;s newly adopted 4–3–3 formation.

On 12 November 2011, Parker was named man of the match in a friendly against UEFA Euro 2008 and 2010 FIFA World Cup winners Spain in the 1–0 win. Parker captained England on 29 February 2012 in their 2–3 defeat by the Netherlands at Wembley.

Following Roy Hodgson&#x27;s appointment as England manager, Parker was selected as part of England&#x27;s UEFA Euro 2012 preliminary squad and was kept in for the final 23-man squad. He started all four of England&#x27;s matches, helping the team top their group with wins against Sweden and Ukraine and a draw with France before they were knocked out in the quarter finals by Italy.

His final cap came in March 2013, in a 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification match against San Marino, coming on as a substitute for Frank Lampard.

==Style of play==
Parker was known as a tough tackling central midfielder.

On the international stage, Parker had been among the notable England players to have been criticised and panned for their hard-working but less technical style of play. Overlooked for major tournaments such as UEFA Euro 2004 and the 2010 FIFA World Cup, in 2012 Parker was a regular presence in the line-up, being partnered with Steven Gerrard. Although England had a relatively disappointing Euro 2012 campaign, some viewed the partnership of Parker and Gerrard as one of the positives.

==Managerial career==
===Fulham===
Shortly after his retirement from playing, Parker returned to Tottenham Hotspur, coaching their under-18 squad, as well as being announced as a club ambassador. In July 2018, Parker left Tottenham to return to Fulham, who had just gained promotion back to the Premier League, serving as first-team coach, linking up with former manager Slaviša Jokanović. He was retained in his coaching position after Claudio Ranieri was brought in to replace a dismissed Jokanović that November.

Ranieri was dismissed on 28 February 2019, having overseen no improvement to the team&#x27;s results, leaving the club in a relegation battle. Parker was then appointed as caretaker manager that same day, the club now sat nineteenth in the Premier League table. He took charge of the team for the first time three days later, where they lost 2–1 to visitors Chelsea. Fulham were relegated to the Championship after a disappointing returning league campaign, their relegation confirmed after a 4–1 thrashing by Watford, with five games remaining.

After speculation arose over who would replace Ranieri on a permanent basis following relegation, chairman Shahid Khan appointed Parker as manager permanently on a two-year contract. Parker was able to retain the majority of his players, despite relegation, with star striker Aleksandar Mitrović signing a new contract during the summer. During his first season in charge, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in all English sport being suspended from March until June 2020; Fulham ultimately finished the season in fourth place, missing out on automatic promotion by two points, thus qualifying to the promotion play-offs. After defeating Cardiff City over two legs in the semi-finals, they beat Brentford in the play-off final to achieve promotion back to the Premier League at the first time of asking.

Fulham&#x27;s return to the Premier League however did not begin smoothly: they lost their first four games and failed to win until November, when they beat relegation rivals West Bromwich Albion 2–0 at Craven Cottage. Towards the end of the 2020–21 season, Parker reportedly became a surprise contender for the Tottenham Hotspur managerial vacancy, after José Mourinho was dismissed, but he remained at the club. Parker&#x27;s side were relegated to the Championship once again in May 2021 after suffering defeat to Burnley, who were above them in the Premier League table. Following relegation, Parker said that Fulham must try to break the cycle of relegation and promotion and establish themselves in the top flight. On 28 June, the club announced that Parker had left by mutual consent.

===AFC Bournemouth===
The same day his departure from Fulham was finalised, Parker was appointed as head coach of AFC Bournemouth, replacing Jonathan Woodgate on a three-year contract. After guiding the club to 13 points from a possible 15, Parker was awarded the league&#x27;s Manager of the Month award for September 2021. Parker won the award again in October after leading Bournemouth to five wins in five matches, conceding just one goal in the process. Parker guided Bournemouth to promotion back to the Premier League after two years away in his first season as manager. The side finished as runners-up to Fulham sealing second place on 3 May, with one game remaining in the season, with a 1–0 win against fourth-placed Nottingham Forest.

Bournemouth won their first game back in the top flight, defeating Aston Villa 2–0 at home on 6 August. After that win, the team lost its next three games by an aggregate score of 16–0, losing 4–0 to Manchester City, 3–0 to Arsenal, before a 9–0 loss away at Liverpool on 27 August, a joint-record for the largest score margin in Premier League history. Following the Liverpool match, Parker expressed his frustrations with the club&#x27;s transfer policy, stating they were currently &quot;unequipped&quot; for the Premier League. Three days after the Liverpool match, Bournemouth announced they had parted company with Parker.

===Club Brugge===

On 31 December 2022, Parker was appointed manager of Belgian champions Club Brugge, succeeding Carl Hoefkens at a team in fourth place and 12 points off the lead. His first game on 8 January was a 3–1 loss at leaders Genk in the Pro League. Parker inherited a team that had reached the last 16 of the UEFA Champions League, where his team lost 7–1 on aggregate to Benfica. On 8 March, the day after the 5–1 second leg defeat at the Estádio da Luz, and having won twice in 12 overall games to fall to 21 points off the lead, he was dismissed.

===Burnley===
On 5 July 2024, Burnley confirmed the appointment of Parker as head coach on a three-year contract.

==Personal life==
Parker is the brother-in-law of footballer Harry Arter, whom he managed at Fulham. Parker married Arter&#x27;s sister, Carly, when he was 20. The couple have four sons.

<doc id="1333798" wikidata="Q383604" url="?curid=1333798" title="Afraid of Sunlight">
<text>Afraid of Sunlight is Marillion&#x27;s eighth studio album, released in 1995. It was their last for EMI (who would, however, continue to release back-catalogue material on compilations and re-issues, as well as distribute some later recordings).

&quot;Afraid of Sunlight&quot; was the first Marillion studio album to fail to reach the Top 10 in the UK Albums Chart, peaking at number 16 and falling out of the Top 75 after two weeks. Despite this, &quot;Afraid of Sunlight&quot; became one of the band&#x27;s most critically acclaimed albums and was included in &quot;&quot;Q&quot; magazine&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Recordings of the Year&quot; for 1995. It was retrospectively described by Jeri Montesano of Allmusic as &quot;the peak of Marillion&#x27;s growing, impressive body of work&quot; and by colleague Jason Ankeny as &quot;the most consistent Marillion release to date&quot;. The album is ranked at #90 on &quot;Prog Magazine&quot;&#x27;s list of the 100 Greatest Prog Albums of All Time.

==Concept==
Although not a concept album as such, &quot;Afraid of Sunlight&quot; repeatedly examines the destructive side of celebrity. In particular, &quot;Gazpacho&quot; lampoons the Hollywood lifestyle and seems to refer to O. J. Simpson. &quot;Cannibal Surf Babe&quot; is a Beach Boys pastiche inspired by late-night horror movies. &quot;Out of This World&quot; is dedicated to world land and water speed record holder Donald Campbell, killed in 1967. The song later inspired diver Bill Smith to look for the actual wreckage, and the main wreckage of Campbell&#x27;s &quot;Bluebird K7&quot; hydroplane was recovered from Coniston Water on 8 March 2001. Both Steve Hogarth and Steve Rothery were present at the raising. The title track refers to self-destructive thrill-seekers such as James Dean, while &quot;King&quot; is about Elvis Presley, Kurt Cobain and Michael Jackson. &quot;Beyond You&quot; is reminiscent of Phil Spector&#x27;s Wall of Sound productions and, in homage, was mixed in mono.

One reviewer noted the 1980 Martin Scorsese film &quot;Raging Bull&quot;, about a boxer&#x27;s inability to deal with fame, as a strong influence on the album. He also cited O. J. Simpson, on trial for murder at the time &quot;Afraid of Sunlight&quot; was recorded, as another influence on its concept; the wind-down of &quot;Gazpacho&quot; ends with a sample from a news report on Simpson&#x27;s infamous flight from the police.

==Release==
&quot;Afraid of Sunlight&quot; was released in Europe on 24 June 1995 by EMI Records on CD, LP and cassette, and in the U.S. on 4 July 1995 by El Dorado, a subsidiary label of I.R.S. Records. It climbed to number 16 in the UK and spent only three weeks in the charts, the shortest chart residency of any Marillion studio album by then. The only single from the album, &quot;Beautiful&quot;, peaked at number 29 in the UK Singles Chart. &quot;Afraid of Sunlight&quot; reached number 8 in the Netherlands, the country where the band has one of their largest fanbases.

As part of a series of Marillion&#x27;s first eight studio albums, EMI Records re-released &quot;Afraid of Sunlight&quot; on 22 March 1999 with 24-bit digital remastered sound and a second disc containing bonus tracks. A new 180g heavy weight vinyl pressing identical to the original 1995 edition was released in 2013.

===Critical reception===

AllMusic critic Alex S. Garcia has retrospectively given &quot;Afraid of Sunlight&quot; a four-out-of-five star rating. He noted that the album has &quot;some very beautiful melodic moments and perhaps a better mix between calm and melodies than on previous albums made with Steve Hogarth&quot;. Jeri Montesano called it &quot;the peak of Marillion&#x27;s growing, impressive body of work&quot; while reviewing &quot;Seasons End&quot; (1989). His colleague Dale Jensen has named the album &quot;the most consistent Marillion release to date&quot;. In a review from &quot;Q&quot; magazine, &quot;Afraid of Sunlight&quot; has been described as &quot;a 40-minute journey that touches on the legacy of Brian Wilson, Todd Rundgren and The Beatles, while hinting at the experimental trivialities of Jellyfish or Split Enz&quot;.

<text>Benjamin Maurice Silverstone (born 9 April 1979) is an English barrister and former actor. Silverstone appeared in the 1998 Paramount Classics feature film, &quot;Get Real&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Silverstone was born in Camden, London, the son of Beverly and Anthony Silverstone. He has one sister and one brother. He studied English at Trinity College, Cambridge, and law (LLM) at the London School of Economics.

== Acting career ==
Prior to &quot;Get Real&quot;, Silverstone appeared in Adrian Lyne&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;Lolita&quot; in 1997 and Mike Figgis&#x27; &quot;The Browning Version&quot; in 1994.
&quot;Get Real&quot; was based on Patrick Wilde&#x27;s stage play &quot;What&#x27;s Wrong with Angry?&quot;, and is a love story between two British schoolboys. Silverstone made the front cover of &quot;Gay Times&quot; in May 1999 to mark the release of the film.

The film achieved cult status with many fans, and even gave rise to two fan-organised gatherings in the filming locations around Basingstoke. The events in themselves attracted the attention of the television media, as fans of the film travelled several thousand miles to the event.

Immediately after the release of &quot;Get Real&quot;, Silverstone went to Cambridge University. While there, he acted in student productions of &quot;King Lear&quot;, &quot;The Whiteheaded Boy&quot;, &quot;The Duchess of Malfi&quot;, &quot;The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui&quot;, &quot;Near Miss&quot; and &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;. In his first term at Cambridge, Silverstone was initially cast as Lieutenant Yolland in the ADC Theatre production of the Brian Friel play &quot;Translations&quot;: however, he turned the part down, and was replaced with another Cambridge freshman, Tom Hiddleston. His involvement in student theatre at Cambridge also overlapped with Oscar winner Eddie Redmayne.

Since 2001, Silverstone has appeared in numerous stage productions such as &quot;The Tempest&quot; and &quot;My Boy Jack&quot; and was nominated for both a &quot;The Times&quot; Theatre Award and an &quot;Evening Standard&quot; Theatre Award for his portrayal of Basil Anthony in the West End production of &quot;Man and Boy&quot;

His most recent film project is &quot;Jump!&quot; (2007), in which he starred as a young Jewish photographer charged with the murder of his father, based on the real-life story of Philippe Halsman, opposite Patrick Swayze and Martine McCutcheon.

==Law career==
Silverstone left Cambridge in 2001 with a first class degree. He was called to the bar in 2009. As of December 2023, Silverstone works at Matrix Chambers. That firm lists him as a specialist in media and information, data protection and public law.

<doc id="1333814" wikidata="Q2625006" url="?curid=1333814" title="Tire tread">
<text>The tread of a tire or track refers to the rubber on its circumference that makes contact with the road or the ground. As tires are used, the tread is worn off, limiting its effectiveness in providing traction. A worn tire can often be retreaded.

The word tread is often used casually to refer to the pattern of grooves molded into the rubber, but those grooves are correctly called the tread pattern, or simply the pattern. The grooves are not the tread, they are in the tread. This distinction is especially significant in the case of racing slicks, which have much tread but no grooves.

== Tires ==


=== Street tires ===
The grooves in the rubber are designed to allow water to be expelled from beneath the tire and prevent hydroplaning. The proportion of rubber to air space on the road surface directly affects its traction. Design of tire tread has an effect upon noise generated, especially at freeway speeds. Generally there is a tradeoff of tread friction capability; deeper patterns often enhance safety, but simpler designs are less costly to produce and actually may afford some roadway noise mitigation. Tires intended for dry weather use will be designed with minimal pattern to increase the contact patch. Tires with a smooth tread (i.e., having no tread pattern) are known as slicks and are generally used for racing only, since they are quite dangerous if the road surface is wet.

Street tires will also include wear limit indicators in the form of small raised bridges within the grooves. When the tread is worn down enough that the limit indicators make contact with the road, the tire is deemed to be at the end of its service life. Brake pads use similar indicators in the form of notches on their surface that disappear when they are used.

=== Snow tires ===

Snow tires or Winter tires are tires designed for use in colder weather, snow and ice. To improve traction, they are made of different rubber and have a different tread pattern from regular street tires.

=== Off-road tires ===

Off-road tires used in mud or dirt feature individual knob patterns to allow the tire to bite into the surface and lever the sides of the tread to get a better grip. Given the smaller contact patch, these tires tend to wear quickly when used on asphalt (depending on type of rubber).

=== Mountain bike and motorcycle tires ===
Mountain bike and some motorcycle tires feature tread similar to off-road tires used on cars and trucks but may sometimes include an unbroken tread that runs along its center. This feature provides better traction and lower noise on asphalt at high speed and on high tire pressure, but retains the ability to provide grip on a soft or loose surface- lower tire pressure or soft ground will cause the side lugs to come into contact with the surface. Road bike tires may have shallow grooves for aesthetic purposes, but such grooves are unnecessary in narrow applications.

== Continuous tracks ==

Continuous tracks such as those used on military tanks or construction machines (i.e. caterpillar tracks) have metal track segments which may be rubber-coated. They usually do not feature tread patterns, because these would offer little additional grip given the weight of the tracked vehicle. Traction is usually provided by grousers instead.

<text>The boliviano (; sign: Bs ISO 4217 code: BOB) is the currency of Bolivia. It is divided into 100 cents or centavos in Spanish. Boliviano was also the name of the currency of Bolivia between 1864 and 1963. From April 2018, the manager of the Central Bank of Bolivia, Pablo Ramos, announced the introduction of the new family of banknotes of the Plurinational State of Bolivia, started with the 10 Bs note, and then gradually arrived to introduce the 200 Bs note, presented in April 2019. The new family of banknotes of the Plurinational State received several awards such as &quot;the best banknotes in Latin America&quot;, was highlighted by its security measures, its aesthetics and its inclusion of prominent figures in Bolivian history, being among those who awarded the &quot;Latin American High Security Printing Press Conference&quot;.

==History==
Currencies in use before the current second boliviano include:
* The &quot;Spanish real&quot; from the 16th to 19th centuries, with 8 reales equal to 1 peso and 16 reales equal to 1 escudo.
* The &quot;Bolivian sol&quot; from 1827 to 1864, replacing the Spanish real at par. 16 soles were equal to 1 &quot;Bolivian escudo&quot;, and 8 soles were equal to 1 boliviano.
* The &quot;first boliviano&quot; from 1864 to 1963, worth eight &quot;soles&quot; and divided into 100 &quot;centécimos&quot; (later &quot;centavos&quot;). The name bolivar was used for an amount of ten bolivianos.
* The &quot;peso boliviano&quot; (code ), from 1963 to 1986, worth 1,000 first bolivianos.

The second boliviano was introduced in 1987 at a rate of 1 boliviano = 1,000,000 &quot;pesos bolivianos&quot;.

==Second boliviano==
Following many years of rampant inflation, the bolivian peso was replaced in 1987 by a new boliviano at a rate of one million to one (when 1 US dollar was worth 1.8/1.9 million pesos). At that time, 1 new boliviano was roughly equivalent to U.S. dollar.

===Coins===
In 1988, stainless-steel 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 centavos and 1 boliviano (dated 1987) coins were introduced, followed by stainless-steel 2 bolivianos in 1991. Copper-plated steel 10 centavos were introduced in 1997 and bi-metallic 5 bolivianos in 2001. The 2 and 5 centavo coins are no longer in circulation. The 2 boliviano coin has been minted in two sizes, both of which remain legal tender. The smaller 2 boliviano coin is almost the same as the 1 boliviano coin, leading to potential confusion, although the 2 boliviano coins are undecagonal whilst the 1 boliviano coins are round.
All the coins in Bolivia have the value with the inscription &quot;La union es la Fuerza&quot; (&quot;Union is strength&quot; in Spanish) on the obverse. Older coins feature and the coat of arms of Bolivia with the inscription &quot;Republica de Bolivia&quot; (Republic of Bolivia) on the reverse, while newer ones feature the coat of arms with the inscription &quot;Estado Plurinacional de Bolivia&quot; (Plurinational state of Bolivia).


===Banknotes===

In 1987, last peso boliviano banknotes and cheques de gerência were overprinted with denominations in centavos and bolivianos to produce provisional issues of 1, 5, 10 and 50 centavos, and 1, 5 and 10 bolivianos. Regular issues followed the same year in denominations of 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 and 200 bolivianos. The 2 boliviano note was replaced by a coin in 1991, with the same happening to the 5 boliviano in 2001, although the Bolivian central bank still lists the 5 boliviano note as &quot;in circulation&quot;
-The 10 Bolivianos bill has in the obverse to the painter Cecilio Guzman and reverse an image of city of Cochabamba. -The 20 Boliviano bill has in the obverse to the lawyer Pantaleon Dalence and in the reverse an image of The Golden Colonial House of Tarija. The 50 Boliviano bill has in the obverse to the painter Melchor Perez and in the reverse you can see the Tower of Church of the Society of Jesus in the city of Potosi- The 100 Boliviano bill has in the obverse of the great historian Gabriel Rene Moreno and the reverse one image of the Mayor Real and Papal University of Saint Francisco Xavier of Chuquisaca in the capital, the city of Sucre, the 200 Boliviano bill has to the obverse to the writer and former president of Bolivia, Franz Tamayo and in the reverse an image of ruins of the Pre-Inca empire of Tihuanaco in the shores of Lake Titicaca in the state or department of La Paz.

In 2013, the 2 and 5 Bolivianos bills were officially out of circulation.

In 2018, the Central Bank of Bolivia (Banco Central de Bolivia) unveiled a new family of banknotes, and will be issued by order of denomination. The notes are the first to bear the formal name of Bolivia &quot;Estado Plurinacional de Bolivia&quot; (&quot;Plurinational State of Bolivia&quot;), to reflect the multiculturalism of the country and all of its citizens.

==Exchange rates==
In a fixed exchange rate regime system, the Central Bank of Bolivia undertakes to buy and sell foreign currency at the price it previously set of Bs 6.86 for the purchase and Bs 6.96 for the sale for 1 $US respectively. from November 2011 to the present, which is more than eleven continuous years. The consequences of this system are crucial, although in practice they are not understood in their real dimension of its effects in the short and long term on the country&#x27;s economy. Since 2023 in Bolivia there has been a shortage of United States dollar, so the &quot;parallel&quot; dollar began to settle in streets and some exchange houses, reaching an exchange rate of Bs 8.90 for sale for 1 $US. although the Central Bank of Bolivia enabled the option of carry out the sale of dollars in their offices at the official price.

==Manufacture and production==
As of 2013 boliviano coins and banknotes are still being produced abroad, in countries such as the United Kingdom, France, and Chile, even though Bolivia has been politically independent since 1825.

Though Bolivia was one of the main mints of the colonial era (casa de la moneda, Potosí) the coining and printing of currency stopped due to lack of political interest and on the idea that foreign made coins and banknotes could be acquired at a lower price than the Bolivian-made coins and banknotes.

==US dollar-related currency (MVDOL) ==
MVDOL (ISO 4217 code ) is a unit of currency (account). It has a value, inflation-adjusted between the Bolivian boliviano and the US dollar. It is used in financial instruments due to its stable value.

The name :wikt:MVDOL is derived from ([Bolivian] national currency with value maintained to the US dollar).

<doc id="1333830" wikidata="Q17149572" url="?curid=1333830" title="Today's Children">
<text>Today&#x27;s Children was a name shared by two thematically related American radio soap operas created and written by Irna Phillips, the earliest of which was her first nationally networked series.

==1933–1938 series==
The original series, which debuted on September 11, 1933, revolved around the large Moran clan, headed by widow Mary &quot;Mother&quot; Moran, who was voiced by Phillips herself. Mother Moran had three adult children—Terry, Frances, and Eileen—whose troubles she dealt with using what promotional materials called &quot;warm-hearted understanding and a common-sense philosophy.&quot;

The creation of the series was a direct result of Phillips&#x27; resignation from her pioneering WGN series &quot;Painted Dreams&quot; when the station refused to allow her to take the program to a network. As a result of the station&#x27;s decision, she created &quot;Children&quot; for NBC-owned WMAQ as a thinly disguised version of the earlier series. Mother Moran was based on Mother Moynahan. the mother-in-law of WGN station manager Harry Gilman, and Lucy Gilman&#x27;s grandmother.
The series ended on December 31, 1937, replaced in the new year by another Phillips creation, &quot;Woman in White&quot;.

In 1937 a novel was published in book form by Pillsbury Flour Mills Company based on the radio program and given the same name (&quot;Today&#x27;s Children&quot;). The copyright was held by the National Broadcasting Company. No author was cited in the book. The book was illustrated with line drawings depicting the action, as well as photographs of the leading characters in the show, identified by their character names only.

===Characters===
A 1935 Pillsbury advertising premium describes the characters as follows.

*Mary &quot;Mother&quot; Moran: &quot;The widowed mother of Terry, Frances and Eileen—a typical American family of today. So big is her heart that its loving kindness has taken in all the others—the people she calls her &quot;family of Today&#x27;s Children.&quot; Her quiet old-fashioned philosophy has brought peace and understanding to all the members of her family in times of trouble, for hers is a philosophy as sound and as enduring as the eternal hills—love of family, love of home, and love of fellow man.&quot;
*Frances Moran: &quot;The elder daughter, Frances, is twenty-five, tall and very blond. An ambitious, talented and successful commercial artist, she is typical of the modern business girl. Ordinarily practical and level-headed, she has occasionally let the dictates of her heart lead her into difficulties, but has a way of regaining her balance.&quot;
*Eileen Moran: &quot;The youngest of Mother Moran&#x27;s children, she is perhaps her mother&#x27;s secret favorite. Petite, dark and unsophisticated Eileen, at twenty has secured a foothold on the ladder of artistic success through her beautiful singing voice. Yet today she is not quite so sure that her first ambition—to have a career—is more worthwhile than love, family and a home.&quot;
*Terry Moran: &quot;Mother Moran&#x27;s &#x27;first born,&#x27; Terry is thirty-three, tall, and like his sister Eileen, dark. He has had his ups and downs, but is now well established as an executive of an advertising agency. A devoted father and husband, his deep affection for little Lucy and Bobbie, and for his wife, Dorothy, is generally concealed by his undemonstrative manner.&quot;
*Dot: &quot;In Dorothy, we find the typical young mother of today, meeting the new and yet old problems of wifehood and motherhood with present-day intelligence and spirit. She has been obliged to live in close contact with her husband&#x27;s family because of economic necessity, but has met the situation with rare sympathy and understanding.&quot;
*Lucy: &quot;&#x27;Do you know what?&#x27; characterizes little Lucy, the self-appointed bearer of news between the various households of &#x27;Today&#x27;s Children.&#x27; This pert but intelligent youngster, who recently celebrated her tenth birthday, has been a constant source of joy, and amusement, and affection, to the entire family.&quot;
*Dick Crane: &quot;Richard Crane, Bob&#x27;s brother, is twenty-two, dark and impulsive. He is typical of the farm boy who has tasted both college and the city and so feels that he can never reconcile himself to future on the farm, even though business connections have help him there until very recently. He is eager and ambitious to rise in the world.&quot;
*Bob Crane: &quot;The idealism that characterizes Robert Crane may have come from his childhood spent on a farm. His fine family background, together with his early contact with Mother Nature, have given him high ideals and a broad understanding and tolerance. At thirty, he is a successful young attorney, becoming more and more involved in reform politics.&quot;
*Kay: &quot;A dark, striking brunette of twenty-eight, Mrs. Robert Crane (Katherine Norton) is at times wholeheartedly generous toward others, and again utterly selfish in her desire for happiness. She was a successful young business woman before her marriage, but felt she had realized her fondest dream when she became a wife and home-maker.&quot;

==1943–1950 series==
Six years following the end of the original series, Phillips created a new serial bearing the &quot;Today&#x27;s Children&quot; title which began on December 13, 1943 on NBC radio, related to the original series only by its general dramatic themes and the setting of Chicago&#x27;s Hester Street. The new serial followed the family of Mama and Papa Schultz, played by Virginia Payne and Murray Forbes.

Originally, the series was one of three Phillips-created serials which made up the &quot;General Mills Hour&quot;, with characters and plots crossing over between &quot;Children&quot;, &quot;The Guiding Light&quot;, and &quot;Woman In White&quot;. Although Phillips was integral in plotting the revived series, the dialogue was written by Virginia Cooke. The second version of &quot;Today&#x27;s Children&quot; ended on June 2, 1950.

<doc id="1333837" wikidata="Q1351572" url="?curid=1333837" title="Eric Ravilious">
<text>Eric William Ravilious (22 July 1903 – 2 September 1942) was a British painter, designer, book illustrator and wood-engraver. He grew up in Sussex, and is particularly known for his watercolours of the South Downs, Castle Hedingham and other English landscapes, which examine English landscape and vernacular art with an off-kilter, modernist sensibility and clarity. He served as a war artist, and was the first British war artist to die on active service in World War II when the aircraft he was in was lost off Iceland.

==Early life and education==

Eric William Ravilious was born on 22 July 1903 in Churchfield Road, Acton, London, the son of Emma (&quot;née&quot; Ford) and Frank Ravilious. When he was young the family moved to Eastbourne in Sussex, where his parents ran an antiques shop. 

Ravilious was educated at Eastbourne Municipal Secondary School for Boys, from September 1914 to December 1919. It was later renamed as Eastbourne Grammar School. In 1919 he won a scholarship to Eastbourne School of Art and in 1922 another to study at the Design School at the Royal College of Art. There, he became a close friend of Edward Bawden (his 1930 painting of Bawden at work is in the collection of the college) and, from 1924, studied under Paul Nash. Nash, an enthusiast for wood-engraving, encouraged him in the technique, and was impressed enough by his work to propose him for membership of the Society of Wood Engravers in 1925, and helped him to get commissions.

In 1925 Ravilious received a travelling scholarship to Italy and visited Florence, Siena, and the hill towns of Tuscany.

== Career and marriage ==
Following this he began teaching part-time at the Eastbourne School of Art, and from 1930 taught (also part-time) at the Royal College of Art. In the same year he married Eileen Lucy &quot;Tirzah&quot; Garwood, also an artist and engraver, whom he met whilst her tutor at Eastbourne College of Art. They had three children: John Ravilious (1935–2014); the photographer James Ravilious (1939–1999); and Anne Ullmann, née Ravilious (b. 1941), editor of books on her parents and their work.

In 1928 Ravilious, Bawden and Charles Mahoney painted a series of murals at Morley College in south London on which they worked for a whole year. Their work was described by J. M. Richards as &quot;sharp in detail, clean in colour, with an odd humour in their marionette-like figures&quot; and &quot;a striking departure from the conventions of mural painting at that time&quot;, but was destroyed by bombing in 1941.

Between 1930 and 1932 Ravilious and Garwood lived in Hammersmith, west London, where there is a blue plaque on the wall of their house at the corner of Upper Mall and Weltje Road. The building looks out onto The Boat Race course, and the couple held bathing and boat-race parties. When Ravilious and Bawden graduated from the RCA they began exploring the Essex countryside in search of rural subjects to paint. Bawden rented Brick House in Great Bardfield as a base and when he married Charlotte Epton, a fellow RCA art student, his father bought it for him as a wedding present. Ravilious and Garwood lodged in Brick House with the Bawdens until 1934 when they purchased Bank House at Castle Hedingham, which is now also marked by a blue plaque. There were eventually several other Great Bardfield Artists.

In 1933 Ravilious and Garwood painted murals at the Midland Hotel in Morecambe. In November 1933, Ravilious held his first solo exhibition at the Zwemmer Gallery in London, titled &quot;An Exhibition of Water-Colour Drawings&quot;. Twenty of the 37 works displayed were sold. During 1939, Ravilious painted a series of watercolours of chalk hill figures in the English landscape. The Leicester Galleries sold three of these paintings to British public collections, the Tate, the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum and Aberdeen Art Gallery.
==Printmaking and illustration==

Ravilious engraved more than 400 illustrations and drew over 40 lithographic designs for books and publications during his lifetime. His first commission, in 1926, was to illustrate a novel for Jonathan Cape. He went on to produce work both for large companies such as the Lanston Monotype Corporation and smaller, less commercial publishers, such as the Golden Cockerel Press (for whom he illustrated an edition of &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;), the Curwen Press and the Cresset Press. His woodcut of two Victorian gentlemen playing cricket has appeared on the front cover of every edition of &quot;Wisden Cricketers&#x27; Almanack&quot; since 1938. His style of wood-engraving was greatly influenced by that of Thomas Bewick, whom both he and Bawden admired. Ravilious in turn influenced other wood engravers, such as Gwenda Morgan who also depicted scenes in the South Downs and was commissioned by the Golden Cockerel Press.

In the mid-1930s Ravilious took up lithography, making a print of &quot;Newhaven Harbour&quot; for the &quot;Contemporary Lithographs&quot; scheme, and a set of full-page lithographs, mostly of shop interiors, for a book called &quot;High Street&quot;, with text by J. M. Richards. Following a trip in a submarine in the war he produced a series of lithographs on &quot;Submarines&quot;, a set of 12, one of which was entitled &quot;Submarine Dream.&quot;

==Design==

In February 1936, Ravilious held his second exhibition at the Zwemmer Gallery and again it was a success, with 28 out of the 36 paintings shown being sold. This exhibition also led to a commission from Wedgwood for ceramic designs. His work for them included a commemorative mug to mark the planned coronation of Edward VIII; the design was revised for the Coronation of George VI and Elizabeth.

Other popular Ravilious designs included the &quot;Alphabet&quot; mug of 1937, and the china sets, &quot;Afternoon Tea&quot; (1938), &quot;Travel&quot; (1938), and &quot;Garden Implements&quot; (1939), plus the &quot;Boat Race Day&quot; cup in 1938. Production of Ravilious&#x27; designs continued into the 1950s, with the coronation mug design being posthumously reworked for the coronation of Elizabeth II in 1953.

He also undertook glass designs for Stuart Crystal in 1934, graphic advertisements for London Transport and furniture work for Dunbar Hay in 1936. Ravilious and Bawden were both active in the campaign by the Artists&#x27; International Association to support the Republican cause in the Spanish Civil War. Throughout 1938 and 1939, Ravilious spent time working in Wales, the south of France and at Aldeburgh to prepare works for his third one-man show, which was held at the Arthur Tooth &amp; Sons Gallery in 1939.

==Watercolour==
Apart from a brief experimentation with oils in 1930 – inspired by the works of Johan Zoffany – Ravilious painted almost entirely in watercolour. He was especially inspired by the landscape of the South Downs around Beddingham. He frequently returned to Furlongs, the cottage of Peggy Angus. He said that his time there &quot;altered my whole outlook and way of painting, I think because the colour of the landscape was so lovely and the design so beautifully obvious ... that I simply had to abandon my tinted drawings&quot;. Some of his works, such as &quot;Tea at Furlongs&quot;, were painted there.

== Murals ==
Ravilious was commissioned to paint murals on the walls of the tea room on Victoria Pier at Colwyn Bay in 1934. After the pier&#x27;s partial collapse, these were thought unrecoverable, but, as of March 2018, one had been recovered in pieces and it was hoped that a second could also be saved, along with parts of another by Mary Adshead, from the pier&#x27;s auditorium.

Conwy Council&#x27;s conservation officer, Huw Davies, said:

==War artist==
Prior to the outbreak of WWII Ravilious aligned himself with anti-fascist causes, including lending his work to the 1937 exhibition &quot;Artists Against Fascism&quot;. He considered joining the military as a rifleman but was deterred by friends; he joined a Royal Observer Corps post in Hedingham at the outbreak of war. He was then accepted as a full-time salaried artist by the War Artists&#x27; Advisory Committee in December 1939. He was given the rank of Honorary Captain in the Royal Marines and assigned to the Admiralty.

In February 1940, he reported to the Royal Naval barracks at Chatham Dockyard. While based there he painted ships at the dockside, barrage balloons at Sheerness and other coastal defences. &quot;Dangerous Work at Low Tide, 1940&quot; depicts bomb disposal experts approaching a German magnetic mine on Whitstable Sands. Two members of the team Ravilious painted were later awarded the Distinguished Service Cross.

On 24 May 1940 Ravilious sailed to Norway aboard HMS &quot;Highlander&quot; which was escorting HMS &quot;Glorious&quot; and the force being sent to recapture Narvik. &quot;Highlander&quot; returned to Scapa Flow before departing for Norway a second time on 31 May 1940. From the deck of &quot;Highlander&quot;, Ravilious painted scenes of both HMS &quot;Ark Royal&quot; and HMS &quot;Glorious&quot; in action. &quot;HMS Glorious in the Arctic&quot; depicts Hawker Hurricanes and Gloster Gladiators landing on the deck of &quot;Glorious&quot; as part of the evacuation of forces from Norway on 7/8 June. The following evening &quot;Glorious&quot; was sunk, with great loss of life.

On returning from Norway, Ravilious was posted to Portsmouth from where he painted submarine interiors at Gosport and coastal defences at Newhaven. After Ravilious&#x27;s third child was born in April 1941, the family moved out of Bank House to Ironbridge Farm near Shalford, Essex. The rent on this property was paid partly in cash and partly in paintings, which are among the few private works Ravilious completed during the war. In October 1941 Ravilious transferred to Scotland, having spent six months based at Dover. In Scotland, Ravilious first stayed with John Nash and his wife at their cottage on the Firth of Forth and painted convoy subjects from the signal station on the Isle of May. At the Royal Naval Air Station in Dundee, Ravilious drew, and sometimes flew in, the Supermarine Walrus seaplanes based there.

In early 1942, Ravilious was posted to York but shortly afterwards was allowed to return home to Shalford when his wife was diagnosed with breast cancer. There he worked on his York paintings and requested a posting to a nearby RAF base while Garwood recovered from a mastectomy. He spent a short time at RAF Debden before moving to RAF Sawbridgeworth in Hertfordshire. At Sawbridgeworth he began flying regularly in the de Havilland Tiger Moths based at the flying school there and would sketch other planes in flight from the rear cockpit of the plane.

==Death==
On 28 August 1942 Ravilious flew to Reykjavík in Iceland and then travelled on to RAF Kaldadarnes. The day he arrived there, 1 September, a Lockheed Hudson aircraft had failed to return from a patrol. The next morning three aircraft were despatched at dawn to search for the missing plane and Ravilious opted to join one of the crews. The aircraft he was on also failed to return and after four days of further searching, the RAF declared Ravilious and the four-man crew lost in action. His body was never recovered and he is commemorated on the Chatham Naval Memorial. The log book belonging to the pilot of the fatal flight, in the possession of the pilot&#x27;s daughter, with a hand-written note &quot;failed to return&quot;, and an RAF official stamp &quot;death presumed&quot;, was shown on the BBC Television programme &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot; in March 2020.

In 1946, Ravilious&#x27;s widow, Tirzah, married Anglo-Irish radio producer Henry Swanzy, having been introduced by Peggy Angus.

==Collections and exhibitions==
Ravilious only held three solo exhibitions during his life from which the majority of works were bought by private collectors. Other than the large number of war-time pictures held by the Imperial War Museum, significant numbers of works by Ravilious only began to be acquired by public museums and galleries in the 1970s when the collection held by Edward Bawden started to come on the art market. The largest collection is held at the Towner Gallery in Eastbourne, while the Fry Art Gallery in Saffron Walden also has a major collection. 

Works by Ravilious are also held by the Bristol Museum and Art Gallery, The Faringdon Collection at Buscot Park, The Ingram Collection of Modern British and Contemporary Art, The Priseman Seabrook Collection, the Wiltshire Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum. In 2019 the British Museum displayed one Ravilious painting, an uncharacteristic painting of a house, unlike his usual style.

A touring exhibition organised by the Victor Batte-Lay Trust named &quot;Eric Ravilious 1903 – 1942&quot; was held at The Minories, Colchester in 1972. The Minories held an exhibition on graphic art and book illustration in 2009, named &quot;Graphic art and the art of illustration&quot; which featured Ravilious.

In April to August 2015 the Dulwich Picture Gallery in London held what it called &quot;the first major exhibition to survey&quot; his watercolours, with more than 80 on display.

In 2017, The Towner Gallery marked the 75th anniversary of Ravilious&#x27; death with &quot;Ravilious &amp; Co: The Pattern of Friendship&quot;, an exhibition that explored the relationships and working collaborations between Ravilious and a group of his friends and affiliates, including Paul Nash, John Nash, Enid Marx, Barnett Freedman, Tirzah Garwood, Edward Bawden, Thomas Hennell, Douglas Percy Bliss, Peggy Angus, Diana Low and Helen Binyon.

In 2021, &quot;Mackerel Sky&quot;, a painting by Ravilious that had been &#x27;missing&#x27; for 82 years, was found and the new owner has lent it to the Hastings Contemporary art gallery for its Seaside Modern Exhibition.

From September 2021 to January 2022, the Wiltshire Museum in Devizes held an exhibition titled &quot;Eric Ravilious: Downland Man&quot; which featured loans from a number of National Museums including the V&amp;A, the British Museum and the Imperial War Museum as well as paintings held in private collections.

To mark its reopening as The Arc in February 2022 the former Winchester Discovery Centre staged &quot;Extraordinary Everyday: The Art &amp; Design of Eric Ravilious&quot;. The exhibition was curated for the Hampshire Cultural Trust and featured wood engravings, watercolours, books, ceramics and lithographs.

In 2022 he was the subject of a film &quot;Eric Ravilious: Drawn to War&quot; written and directed by Margy Kinmonth.

<text>Woodside Omega Transmitter near Woodside, Victoria, Australia, was a transmission tower that was completed in 1982 and demolished in 2015. Until its demolition, it was the tallest object in the Southern Hemisphere.
==History==
In 1977, The United States and Australian governments agreed to establish an OMEGA navigation system in south-eastern Australia. The agreement was extended in 1995, to 30 September 1997.

Station G was an Omega transmitter that used an umbrella antenna carried by a tall grounded lattice steel guyed mast. Unlike many of the other Omega Transmitters, Woodside was not a &quot;hot tower,&quot; that is, one which is insulated from a ground connection by large ceramic insulators that support the entire weight of the structure. Rather, the tower was electrically insulated from the topmost guys which served as the radiators, similar to the metal radials of an umbrella without cloth covering. The mast simply supported the downward sloping guy wires which are the active elements. The guy wires were also used to hold the tower itself in place. This mast was the tallest structure in the southern hemisphere. Construction of this station was originally planned to be built in New Zealand but after protests from anti-war protestors it was built in Australia, although not without controversy. The tower was officially opened in October 1982, but had been operating for 3 months prior to that, with the first broadcast at 10am on the 16th of August, having taken 3.5 years to construct, however the tower itself having taken only 30 days to be constructed.

After the shutdown of the OMEGA navigation system on 30 September 1997, the station was used as a transmitter for uni-directional communications to submarines on 13 kHz under the callsign VL3DEF until 2004. Until December 2008, it had been transmitting a 100 baud MSK modulated signal on 18.6 kHz.

==Current status==
The station was decommissioned in November 2008. Aircraft warning lights continued to operate on each of the 10 43m platforms, although some of the lights had stopped working.

On 25 January 2014, a BASE jumper was killed during an attempt to parachute from the tower. It was demolished by explosives on 22 April 2015.

Transmission equipment from the Omega navigation system is now on display at the Port Albert Maritime Museum.

<text>The Left Book Club is a publishing group that exerted a strong left-wing influence in Great Britain, during its initial run, from 1936 to 1948. It was relaunched in 2015 by Jan Woolf and Neil Faulkner, in collaboration with Pluto Press. 

Pioneered by Victor Gollancz, it offered a monthly book choice, for sale to members only, as well as a newsletter that acquired the status of a major political magazine. It also held an annual rally. Membership peaked at 57,000, but after the Soviet-Nazi non-aggression pact of 1939, it disowned its large Communist element, and subsequent years of paper-rationing, during and after the war, led to further decline. It ceased publishing in 1948.

The concept and series was revived in 2015, following at least one earlier effort to relaunch the series in the early 2000s.

==Early success and organisation==

The Left Book Club, founded in May 1936, was a key left-wing institution of the late 1930s and the 1940s in the United Kingdom. It was set up by Stafford Cripps, Victor Gollancz and John Strachey to revitalise and educate the British Left. The club&#x27;s aim was to &quot;help in the struggle for world peace and against fascism&quot;. Aiming to break even with 2,500 members, it had 40,000 within the first year and by 1939 it was up to 57,000. The LBC was one of the first book clubs in the UK and, as such, played an important role in the evolution of the country&#x27;s book trade.

Historian Michael Newman says:

Between 1936 and 1939, the LBC provided hope for thousands of people who were seeking a solution to the burning moral issues of the era. Despite its pro-Communist line, the Club&#x27;s socialist propaganda and education probably ultimately strengthened the Labour Party and contributed to its victory in the postwar election.

The club supplied a book chosen every month by Gollancz and his panel (Harold Laski and John Strachey) to its members, many of whom took part in one of the 1,500 Left Discussion Groups scattered around the country. The books and pamphlets with their distinctive covers—orange for paperback (1936–1938) and red for hardback (1938–1948) editions—bore the legend &quot;NOT FOR SALE TO THE PUBLIC&quot; and sold for 2s 6d to members. Many titles were available for sale only in the LBC edition, with monthly &#x27;choices&#x27; received by all members; there were also reprints of current socialist and &#x27;progressive&#x27; classics for members to buy. The volumes covered history, science, reporting and fiction and a range of other subjects, but always from a left-leaning perspective.

In response, Christina Foyle founded the Right Book Club, to counter what she regarded as the pernicious influence of the Left Book Club. It offered a variety of titles with Conservative and classical Liberal themes. The Right Book Club was launched in 1937 by Edgar Samuel, who worked for the bookselling firm Foyle&#x27;s. Other political book clubs included the Liberal Book Club and the pacifist Peace Book Club.

==1936–1939: Popular Front==
Until the Molotov–Ribbentrop pact of 1939, the club&#x27;s output included many authors who were members of the Communist Party of Great Britain or close to it, and many of its books offered a positive portrayal of the Soviet Union and its international policies.

&quot;World Revolution: 1917–1936&quot; by C. L. R. James was a Trotskyist critique of the LBC&#x27;s coverage of the Soviet Union during this period. At the same time, Gollancz, as a member of the Labour Party, was concerned to keep the club at a formal distance from campaigns of which the Labour Party disapproved.

Gollancz was a notoriously interventionist editor. He published Orwell&#x27;s &quot;The Road to Wigan Pier&quot; but insisted on prefacing its account of working-class life in the north of England with an introduction disowning the book&#x27;s criticisms of middle-class socialists who, Orwell said, had little understanding of working class life. Later Gollancz republished the book leaving out the second part of which he disapproved.

==1940–1948: War and its aftermath==
By early 1940, however, Gollancz had broken with the CP, a process documented in the articles collected in &quot;Betrayal of the Left&quot; in early 1941. Thereafter the club&#x27;s selection of authors and titles reveals an eclectic mix.

Despite its large membership and popular success the Book Club was always a huge financial drain on the publisher, and the advent of paper rationing at the onset of the war meant that the club was restricted to just one monthly title. To replace the book club&#x27;s additional choices and augment the LBC selections, Gollancz launched the &quot;Victory Books&quot; series, a series of shorter monographs available to the general public. These included two of the biggest selling publications of the entire War period: &quot;Guilty Men&quot; (July 1940) by &quot;Cato&quot; (Michael Foot, Frank Owen and Peter Howard) and &quot;Your M.P.&quot; (1944) by &quot;Gracchus&quot; (Tom Wintringham).

In addition to books, the LBC also produced a monthly newsletter. This began as a simple club newssheet &quot;Left Book News&quot;, but gradually developed (as &quot;Left News&quot;) into a key periodical about international, political and social affairs, with lengthy editorials from Gollancz.

The LBC held its first annual LBC rally in February 1937, and the tradition continued until the late 1940s.

==Influence==
Alongside the Fabian Society and Transport House, the LBC&#x27;s popularising of socialist ideas was a major influence behind the Labour victory in the general election of 1945.

Many members of the club acted as missionaries for the ideas espoused by the club, such as full employment, socialised medicine, town planning and social equality. No less than eight Gollancz authors were part of the new Labour government (Lord Addison, Attlee, Bevan, Cripps, Philip Noel-Baker, Shinwell, Strachey and Wilkinson), and a further six were MPs (Maurice Edelman, Michael Foot, Elwyn Jones, J. P. W. Mallalieu, Stephen Swingler and Konni Zilliacus). This led Victor Gollancz&#x27;s biographer to write, &quot;for an individual without official position, Victor&#x27;s [Gollancz&#x27;s] colossal influence on a vital election remains unmatched in twentieth-century political history.&quot; However, Gollancz was not rewarded with a position in the House of Lords by Clement Attlee who was worried he would become a thorn in his side there.

The Left Book Club was accused of being under Soviet influence both financially and ideologically. One expression of this was its failure to publish Trotskyist writings critical of the USSR. Another example was Gollancz&#x27;s refusal to publish George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Homage to Catalonia&quot;: he would not even read the manuscript.

The success of the Left Book Club led to imitation by other parts of the UK&#x27;s political spectrum.

Historian A. J. P. Taylor points out the membership consisted largely of schoolteachers. Labour Party leaders were annoyed that the club was diverting high-minded middle-class Britons into reading communist tracts instead of joining the Labour Party. Taylor notes the crankiness in the choices of books made by Strachey, Laski, and Gollancz. For example, one of the first two choices was by a biologist envisioning a future in which artificial insemination would enable Lenin (or Stalin) to father every child in the Soviet Union. Taylor denies it was a subversive organisation, saying that &quot;members of the Left Book Club worked off their rebelliousness by plodding through yet another orange-covered volume.&quot;

The leftist Nagani Book Club established in British Burma in 1937 was modelled after the Left Book Club.

== Relaunch ==

In 2015 the Left Book Club was relaunched as a non-profit organisation with the aim of encouraging left-wing debate and discussion among its followers. Its first publication was Kevin Ovenden&#x27;s &quot;Syriza: Inside the Labyrinth&quot;. Initially publishing four books a year in conjunction with Pluto Press, in October 2018 it stepped up its publishing programme to publish a book every month, working with a range of different publishers. The club remains not for profit and is funded by subscriptions and voluntary contributions. Books are selected by an editorial panel and are chosen to represent the best critical writing on left politics, economics, society and culture, written for a broad audience. Subscribers can choose from classic or contemporary writing. Each book is published in a unique LBC edition which is paid for through monthly subscriptions, and members organise their own reading groups to discuss the books.

MP for Islington North Jeremy Corbyn offered wholehearted support to the project. &quot;The relaunch of the Left Book Club is a terrific and timely idea, and will give intellectual ballast to the wave of political change sweeping Britain and beyond, encouraging informed and compassionate debate. I have a large collection of Left Book Club publications collected by my late parents and me. The works will open minds and inspire. I support the new LBC wholeheartedly.&quot;

<doc id="1333845" wikidata="Q1606672" url="?curid=1333845" title="Henry Deringer">
<text>Henry Deringer (October 26, 1786 – February 28, 1868) was an American gunsmith. He is best known for inventing and giving his name to the derringer pistol.

==Early life==
Deringer was born in Easton, Pennsylvania, on October 26, 1786, to colonial gunsmith Henry Deringer Sr. (1756–1833) and Catherine McQuety (1759–1829). The family moved to Philadelphia, where his father continued work on the Kentucky rifle, both an ornate sporting model and a basic version for the U.S. Army. He sent his son to Richmond to apprentice with another gunsmith there.

Henry Deringer moved back to Pennsylvania after serving his apprenticeship and set up shop in 1806 in Philadelphia, on Tamarind Street. He married Elizabeth Hollobush at the First Reformed Church in Philadelphia on April 5, 1810.

According to McElroy&#x27;s directory in 1841 Deringer had a house/gun shop at 370 North Front Street, Northern Liberties, Pennsylvania.

==Work==
Deringer&#x27;s early efforts were for military contracts, producing military pistols, muskets and rifles. Among those he produced was the Model 1814 Common Rifle and the Model 1817 Common Rifle. He produced trade rifles, designated for the Native American tribes, to fulfill the U.S. treaty obligations. His specialties became fine sporting rifles and dueling pistols. He stopped pursuing government contracts by the mid-1840s.

In 1825 he designed the first of the large caliber, short barreled pistols that would lead to considerable wealth and fame for himself. Using the basic flintlock action in common usage at the time, the pistols were muzzle loading single shots, or in some cases, double barreled in an over-under manner.

Later models used the percussion cap action, although both actions were manufactured and sold for some time. For arms of his own design, he adopted the newer percussion cap technology, putting his pistol on the modern cutting edge. He was innovative; he perfected the percussion cap about 1820, and Deringer was marketing them by the 1830s, and possibly the mid-1820s.

==Name and trademark==
Deringer never claimed a patent for his pistols and the public bought them as fast as he produced them. Further development and copying of his design resulted in the derringer (note the double-r) pistol that was generically manufactured widely by other companies.

There was widespread copying of his designs, including outright counterfeiting with his proofmarks being copied. One company even hired a tailor called &quot;John&quot; Deringer so that it could put the Deringer name on its firearms. Some of Deringer&#x27;s workmen also left the company to set up their own duplicates, while others copied his pistols as closely as possible with some even putting on its Deringer name and trademark. Deringer fought these infringements for most of his business life. The &quot;Deringer v. Plate&quot; ruling, in which the California Supreme Court ruled in the company&#x27;s favor, became a landmark in trademark law.

==Death==

Deringer died in 1868 at the age of 81 and was buried in Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia.

In 1660, Edward Hopkins, seven-time governor of the Connecticut Colony, bequeathed a portion of his estate to found schools dedicated to &quot;the breeding up of hopeful youths.&quot; With a portion of the bequest, Hopkins Grammar School was founded in a one-room building on the New Haven Green. The school relocated to its current campus in 1926. Hopkins has been coeducational since merging with Day Prospect Hill School in 1972.

==History==

===Founding===
John Davenport, a founder of the New Haven Colony, was an early proponent of education in the colony. Grammar schools of the time generally prepared young men for college, but the Puritan colony was too far from England for its citizens to attend the existing English schools. Parents of the time were generally more concerned with spending their money on essentials such as food, and viewed formal education as an extravagance most could not afford. Davenport enlisted the help of a friend, Edward Hopkins, governor of the Connecticut Colony, to found a traditional grammar school that would teach Latin, Greek, and Hebrew grammar. The school&#x27;s first home was a building on the New Haven Green.
Hopkins died in 1657 and bequeathed money to found a school dedicated to &quot;the breeding up of hopeful youths for the public service of the country in future times.&quot; Colonial officials wanted Hopkins&#x27;s bequest to remain in Connecticut and appointed three men, Davenport and two others, as executors of Hopkins&#x27;s will. They created the Hopkins Fund, from which Hopkins Grammar School was established in 1660.

The exact date of Hopkins School&#x27;s founding is a matter of definition. The historical record of the executors&#x27; report implies the trust was created on May 4, 1660, but since the Julian calendar was in use then, the date corresponds to May 14 on modern calendars. The papers which created the fund were presented and accepted on May 30, and many use this date as the official date of the school&#x27;s founding. Finally, on June 4 (June 14 on modern calendars) Davenport transferred control of the bequest to the colony, on the condition that the colony accept responsibility for the support of the school.

===The Fallow Years===
&quot;The Fallow Years&quot; is a term coined by Thomas B. Davis in his history, &quot;Chronicles of Hopkins Grammar School&quot;, to describe the period from 1696 to 1853. During this time the school had difficulty finding qualified schoolmasters, and the Hopkins Fund often fell short in paying them. This forced the school to take up collections to meet its payroll. Consequently, there was great turnover in schoolmasters, some staying for no more than a year. Also contributing to the problem was the establishment of the Collegiate School in New Haven in 1701, which drew many local academics away from Hopkins, and which later became Yale University.

Public opinion of Hopkins and academia in general weakened the school. During this time parents wanted children who could read and write English and understand basic arithmetic, but Hopkins continued to focus on subjects that parents deemed irrelevant, such as Latin. Parents were also displeased with schoolmasters who paid little attention to struggling students, instead focusing only on the scholars. On January 12, 1713, the committee which managed the Hopkins Fund began releasing £12–£15 annually to run elementary English schools in East Haven and West Haven. New Haven stopped donating money to the Fund in 1719, which made hiring schoolmasters nearly impossible. Though the trustees of the Hopkins Fund constituted an independent body, the town was known to control them with financial pressures. Richard Mansfield served as schoolmaster from 1742 to 1747, and was the last headmaster until 1839 to serve for more than three years.

Although Hopkins School was still somewhat unpopular with the locals, the school moved to a new larger brick building on the Green, due to the growth of New Haven. Hopkins School was somewhat rare among American schools in that it remained open during the American Revolutionary War. Former schoolmaster John Hotchkiss was killed by the British in July 1779 during their invasion of New Haven, and former schoolmaster Noah Williston was captured. Although the school remained open, records seem to indicate that it was frequently closed between September 1780 and October 1781, &quot;for vacation&quot;. Shortly after the Revolution, Hopkins hired Jared Mansfield for two terms (1786–1790 and 1790–1795) to the unique position &quot;Master of the Grammar School&quot; to try to stabilize the school for the future. Between Mansfield&#x27;s two terms, Abraham Bishop held a six-month term as headmaster during which he proposed radical reform, including making Hopkins coeducational, most of which never came to fruition. After the end of Mansfield&#x27;s second term, the school returned to the pattern of short tenures for schoolmasters.

Hopkins moved buildings again in 1803 to an even larger facility near the Green that took up nearly an entire block. Teachers were offered two-year contracts to teach at Hopkins, but rarely kept them. Hopkins boys grew &quot;unruly and malicious&quot;, some roaming New Haven streets at night. In 1838 the school moved once again, as the trustees believed that moving the school away from the town center would allow its students to focus more on their studies. Throughout August and September that year, they rushed through the necessary transactions to buy the new plot of land, currently the site of the Yale Law School. Following this move the trustees released an announcement to New Haven&#x27;s three newspapers summarizing their hope that this new location would provide sufficient space for the boys to learn and be separate enough that they could do so in peace.
Hawley Olmstead became headmaster in 1839 and ended the line of short-termed schoolmasters as he held the position for ten years. Although Olmstead thought much like Hopkins&#x27; early masters, namely that the school existed to prepare boys for college, he also modernized the curriculum in several ways. Most notably, English was finally added to the curriculum, and he began keeping accurate school rolls which solidified his final legacy, increasing the size of Hopkins&#x27; student body. By the time Olmstead resigned due to poor health on July 28, 1849, school attendance had risen to 63 students.

As soon as Olmstead left, the school began to deteriorate once again, with attendance dropping to 45 students in 1850 and to 20 by 1853. The recently founded debate society disbanded, with seven young members forming the secret society known as &quot;The Club&quot;. Though this club grew no larger and tried to remain quiet, parents grew so annoyed with this supposedly &quot;rough-housing&quot; club that it was forced to disband in 1851. After the debate society and &quot;The Club&quot; were gone, many students sought out new ways to express their literary interests, including founding the school newspaper, &quot;The Critic&quot;. Olmstead was seen by the trustees as a major failure and a cause of the school&#x27;s rapid decline, and was quickly replaced by James Morris Whiton, who had just recently graduated from Yale. He further revised the curriculum by adding more English classes, and school attendance saw a rapid increase once again. Whiton taught for ten years and under his leadership, enrollment climbed to more than 100 students, thus marking the end of &quot;the fallow years.&quot;

===Modern day===
Headmaster George Lovell convinced the Board of Trustees to buy land on the western edge of New Haven for a new campus atop a hill in 1925. Graduate Henry Murphy laid out plans for the new campus in 1922, and designed the original Baldwin Hall building in 1925. The school opened at the new premises, the present campus, in 1926. Baldwin Hall was initially the only building, but the campus expanded greatly over the next century.

Hopkins had begun to refer to itself without &quot;Grammar School&quot; in the casual name by 1935, but &quot;Grammar School&quot; was not officially dropped until several years after Hopkins&#x27; merger with Day Prospect Hill School in 1972. Day Prospect Hill School was itself the product of a merger between two local women&#x27;s schools — the Day School (founded in 1907) and the Prospect Hill School (founded in 1930). The combined institution became the Day Prospect Hill School (DPH), a united women&#x27;s education school. 

Trustee president Vince Calarco and headmaster Tim Rodd led Hopkins to buy a further of land at its current location to establish playing fields in 1992.

In recent years alumnus John C. Malone, a wealthy telecommunications entrepreneur, has donated more than $25 million for new construction, the financial aid program, and forming the endowment.

On March 24, 2020, it was announced that Hopkins School and the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Hartford agreed to settle a sexual abuse lawsuit involving a Catholic school teacher who was regularly allowed access to the Hopkins School and who was accused of sexually abusing boys while coaching at the school between at least 1990 and 1991. Both Hopkins and the Archdiocese of Hartford were accused of covering up the sex abuse and shielding the teacher from potential prosecution. The terms of the settlement were not disclosed. The accused teacher, Glenn Goncalo, committed suicide in 1991 as arrangements were being made for him to turn himself over to the police in connection to a different accusation. It was also reported that reports of sexual abuse at Hopkins dated as far back as 1970.

==Facilities==

Baldwin Hall is the original building of the present campus. It has four floors, including the basement. It houses a computer lab, the language lab, and the Calarco Library. The library is a two floor, space with group study rooms, an art gallery, and a faculty reading room.

Hopkins House houses the Admission Office, Business Office, College Counselling Office, and the Technology Department. This building was named for Edward Hopkins, Hopkins&#x27; first benefactor. It was finished in 1927 with the original intention of having it become a dormitory for boarding students. The program was abandoned in the 1930s due to insufficient enrollment.

The Kneisel Squash Center was originally built as an all-purpose gym in 1935 and named the Reigeluth Gym in honor of a trustee. It was designed by the architect Douglas Orr. In 2010, it was converted into a squash center, housing six squash courts.

Lovell Hall held the Townshend Auditorium, drama and video production classrooms, two multipurpose classrooms, the &quot;Razor&quot; &#x27;s office, and teachers&#x27; offices. The building was named after longtime headmaster George Lovell, who led the school in the first half of the 20th century. It was constructed in 1960 with funds raised during the school&#x27;s tercentenary. It is currently going under renovation, and will be replaced with a new Performing Arts Center in 2024.

Malone Science Center is at the center of campus and houses the science classrooms and labs. Donated by John C. Malone, it is named for Malone&#x27;s father, Daniel Malone. It was opened for students in 1999 and has three floors of classrooms and labs.

Heath Commons is a two-story building that houses the school dining hall and a student lounge. Heath Commons was designed by the S/L/A/M collaborative. It was completed in 2003 and won a Connecticut Design Award in 2005.

Thompson Hall was opened on 30 November 2009 on the former site of one of the upper playing fields. It is named for Mary Brewster Thompson, a long-time head of the Prospect Hill School. The three-story building has two floors of classrooms, as well as large studio art studios, pottery, photography, wood shop, and choral and orchestral spaces. This building houses the advisories for the seventh and eighth grades.

==Academics==

Applicants to Hopkins undergo a series of standardized tests, and upon matriculation, testing is done to place students at the appropriate level of instruction in mathematics and languages. Hopkins&#x27; academics are broken into departments including English, mathematics, science, history, arts, modern language, classics, and computer science. Each of the three class levels — Lower, Middle, and Upper — has a different level of choice in classes.

===Humanities===
The English Department is the only department in which Hopkins requires a student have at least one class in every semester. Upper-class students have two required semester classes: a college-prep writing course and a Shakespeare-centered course. The History Department core is the Atlantic Communities series that focuses on Europe, the Americas, and West Africa between 1450 and modern times. In addition, elective courses go into detail on subjects such as political science, regional studies, philosophy and religion. Advanced Placement courses are offered in United States History, European History, and Human Geography. The Language Department is divided into two subdepartments: the Classics, which covers Ancient Greek and Latin; and Modern Languages, which teaches four other languages (French, Spanish, Chinese, and Italian are currently offered).

===Math and Science===
The Mathematics Department offers study from pre-algebra to Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, Differential Equations and Chaos Theory. The Science Department has three main tracks — Biology, Chemistry, and Physics — along which students can take entry-level courses and then more advanced AP and Honors courses. There are numerous one-off courses in subjects such as Introduction to Psychology, Human Reproduction, or Environmental Studies. The computer science department offers basic computing courses in HTML and Java.

==Athletics==

Hopkins&#x27; athletics function under a trimester system, with students taking an athletic for each of the fall, winter, and spring seasons. Students may choose to participate in a team sport if they make the team, an intramural sport, or an independent sport where the student participates in a school-approved athletic activity such as martial arts lessons. Seniors may also take one season off and not take any athletic for that season. Sports offered at Hopkins vary depending on the season and include cross country, soccer, water polo, downhill skiing, crew, football, field hockey, volleyball, basketball, fencing, track (both outdoor and indoor), swimming/diving, wrestling, squash, golf, lacrosse, tennis, baseball, and softball. Hopkins is a member of the New England Preparatory School Athletic Council and the Fairchester Athletic Association. Hopkins competes with many other private and boarding schools throughout New England and the northeast.

<text>The Battle of Badung Strait was a naval battle of the Pacific campaign of World War II, fought on the night of 19/20 February 1942 in Badung Strait (not to be confused with the West Java city of Bandung) between the American-British-Dutch-Australian Command (ABDA) and the Imperial Japanese Navy. In the engagement, the four Japanese destroyers defeated an Allied force that outnumbered and outgunned them, sinking the Dutch destroyer and escorting two transports to safety. The battle demonstrated the Japanese Navy&#x27;s considerable superiority over the Allies in night fighting which lasted until the Battle of Cape St. George.

==Background==
A battalion of the 48th Infantry Division of the Imperial Japanese Army landed in Bali on 18 February 1942. Dutch Admiral Karel Doorman&#x27;s naval forces were scattered around Indonesia, but the invasion of Bali could not be ignored – it would give the Japanese an airbase within range of the ABDA naval base at Surabaya – so he sent in all available ships. The short notice gave no time to concentrate his ships; accordingly, several Allied forces were to attack the Japanese.

==Battle==
The first Allied vessels to engage were the submarines and . Both attacked the Japanese convoy on 18 February but did no damage and were driven off by depth charges from Japanese destroyers. Later that day, 20 planes of the United States Army Air Forces attacked the convoy but succeeded only in damaging the transport &quot;Sagami Maru&quot;.

The Japanese were aware that their invasion convoy was likely to be attacked again, so they retreated north as soon as possible. The cruiser and the destroyers , and were well away and took no part in the action. The last ships to leave were the transports, each escorted by two destroyers. &quot;Sasago Maru&quot; was escorted by and ; the heavily damaged &quot;Sagami Maru&quot; was escorted by and .

The first Allied group—consisting of the cruisers and and the destroyers , , and —sighted the Japanese in Badung Strait at about 22:00 and opened fire at 22:25 on 19 February. No damage was done in this exchange of fire, and the two Dutch cruisers continued through the strait to the northeast, to give the destroyers a free hand to engage with torpedoes. Then &quot;Piet Hein&quot;, &quot;Pope,&quot; and &quot;John D. Ford&quot; came into range. At 22:40, a Long Lance torpedo from &quot;Asashio&quot; hit &quot;Piet Hein&quot;, sinking the Dutch destroyer immediately. &quot;Asashio&quot; and &quot;Oshio&quot; then exchanged gunfire with &quot;Pope&quot; and &quot;John D. Ford&quot;, forcing the two American destroyers to retire to the southeast instead of following the cruisers to the northeast.

In the darkness, &quot;Asashio&quot; and &quot;Oshio&quot; mistook each other for enemy ships and fired on each other for several minutes, without any damage.

About three hours later, the second group of ABDA ships—the cruiser and the destroyers , , , and —reached Badung Strait. At 01:36, &quot;Stewart&quot;, &quot;Pillsbury,&quot; and &quot;Parrott&quot; launched torpedoes but did no damage. Then &quot;Oshio&quot; and &quot;Asashio&quot; sortied again and there was another exchange of gunfire. &quot;Tromp&quot; was hit by eleven shells from &quot;Asashio&quot;, severely damaging her and hitting both Japanese destroyers, killing four men on &quot;Asashio&quot; and seven on &quot;Oshio&quot;. &quot;Tromp&quot; later had to return to Australia for repairs.

&quot;Arashio&quot; and &quot;Michishio&quot; had been ordered by Admiral Kubo to turn back, and at about 02:20 they joined the battle. &quot;Michishio&quot; was hit by shells from &quot;Pillsbury&quot;, &quot;John D. Edwards,&quot; and &quot;Tromp&quot;, killing 13 of her crew and wounding 83. She lost speed and had to be towed after the battle. During these exchanges, &quot;Stewart&quot; was also damaged topside and one shell hit opened seams below the waterline aft and flooded the steering engine room. Both groups of ships turned away, and the engagement was over.

==Aftermath==

The third ABDA group—seven torpedo boats—arrived in Badung Strait at about 06:00 but did not encounter any Japanese ships. The battle was a significant victory for the Japanese. Lieutenant Commander Gorō Yoshii of &quot;Asashio&quot; and Commander Kiyoshi Kikkawa of &quot;Oshio&quot; had shown great bravery and skill. They had driven off a much larger Allied force, sinking the destroyer &quot;Piet Hein&quot;, damaging the destroyer &quot;Stewart,&quot; and severely damaging the cruiser &quot;Tromp&quot;. Meanwhile, the Japanese had sustained little damage themselves and had protected their transport ships.

Bali&#x27;s garrison of 600 Indonesian militia offered no resistance to the Japanese, and its airfield was captured intact. The Japanese continued their conquest of the Dutch East Indies with the capture of Timor from 20 to 23 February. The ABDA forces engaged at Badung Strait were decisively defeated in the Battle of the Java Sea on 27 February 1942, in which the Dutch cruisers &quot;Java&quot; and &quot;De Ruyter&quot; were sunk and Admiral Doorman was killed. &quot;Tromp&quot; evaded this fate, for she was withdrawn to Australia to repair damage suffered at Badung Strait. The US destroyer &quot;Stewart&quot; was sufficiently damaged that she had to be placed in dry-dock for repairs in Soerabaia, where she was scuttled to avoid capture by the rapidly advancing Japanese. She was raised, repaired, and put into Japanese service a year later as the patrol vessel &quot;P-102&quot;.

<doc id="1333861" wikidata="Q3565843" url="?curid=1333861" title="Walter O'Malley">
<text>Walter Francis O&#x27;Malley (October 9, 1903 – August 9, 1979) was an American sports executive who owned the Brooklyn / Los Angeles Dodgers team in Major League Baseball from 1950 to 1979. In 1958, as owner of the Dodgers, he brought major league baseball to the West Coast, moving the Dodgers from Brooklyn to Los Angeles despite the Dodgers being the second most profitable team in baseball from 1946 to 1956, and coordinating the move of the New York Giants to San Francisco at a time when there were no teams west of Kansas City, Missouri. In 2008, O&#x27;Malley was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame for his contributions to and influence on the game of baseball.

O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s father, Edwin Joseph O&#x27;Malley, was politically connected. Walter, a University of Pennsylvania salutatorian, went on to obtain a Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.), and he used the combination of his family connections, his personal contacts, and both his educational and vocational skills to rise to prominence. First, he became an entrepreneur involved in public works contracting, and then he became an executive with the Dodgers. He progressed from being a team lawyer to being both the Dodgers&#x27; owner and president, and he eventually made the business decision to relocate the Dodgers franchise. Although he moved the franchise, O&#x27;Malley is known as a businessman whose major philosophy was stability through loyalty to and from his employees.

In 1970, O&#x27;Malley ceded the team presidency to his son, Peter. He would become the first chairman of the Dodgers, a title established for him, and remain so until his death in 1979. During the 1975 season, the Dodgers&#x27; inability to negotiate a contract with Andy Messersmith led to the Seitz decision, which limited the baseball reserve clause and paved the way for modern free agency. He bequeathed the team to his children Peter O&#x27;Malley and Terry O&#x27;Malley Seidler upon his death in 1979.

== Early years ==

Walter O&#x27;Malley was born on October 9, 1903, in The Bronx, New York City. He was the only child of Edwin Joseph O&#x27;Malley (1881–1953), who worked as a cotton goods salesman in the Bronx in 1903. Edwin O&#x27;Malley later became the Commissioner of Public Markets for New York City. Walter&#x27;s mother was Alma Feltner (1882–1940). Walter was a third-generation Irish-American. His grandfather was born in County Mayo, Ireland. O&#x27;Malley grew up as a Bronx-born New York Giants fan. He frequently attended Giants games at the Polo Grounds with his uncle Clarence. O&#x27;Malley was a Boy Scout who rose to the rank of Star Scout.

O&#x27;Malley attended Jamaica High School in Queens from 1918 to 1920 and then the Culver Academy (the eventual high school alma mater of future New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner) in Indiana. He managed both the baseball and tennis teams, served on the executive staff of the student newspaper, was a member of the Hospital Visitation Committee as well as the debate team, Bible Discipline Committee and the YMCA. At Culver, his baseball career was ended with a baseball that hit him on the nose.

Later, he attended the University of Pennsylvania and graduated in 1926 as the senior class Salutatorian. At Penn, he was initiated into Theta Delta Chi, and he also served as president of the Phi Deuteron Charge. Upon his graduation from the University of Pennsylvania School of Engineering and Applied Science his father gave him a cabin cruiser that slept eight. He was also Junior and Senior class president. O&#x27;Malley originally enrolled at Columbia University in New York City for law school, but after his family lost their money in the Wall Street Crash of 1929, he switched from Columbia Law School to night school at Fordham University. Edwin O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s dry goods business was failing and Walter had to help run the business.

==Pre-baseball career==
After he completed his law degree in 1930 at Fordham Law, he worked as an assistant engineer for the New York City Subway. After earning his law degree he needed to obtain a clerkship, but it was during the depression and no one could afford to hire him. He allowed a struggling lawyer to use space in his office and paid for his own clerkship. After working for the Subway, he worked for Thomas F. Riley, who owned the Riley Drilling Company, and they formed the partnership of Riley and O&#x27;Malley. With the help of Edwin O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s political connections, Walter&#x27;s company received contracts from the New York Telephone Company and the New York City Board of Education to perform geological surveys. Subsequently, Walter started the Walter F. O&#x27;Malley Engineering Company and published the &quot;Subcontractors Register&quot; with his uncle, Joseph O&#x27;Malley (1893–1985).

Walter eventually concentrated on the field of law, starting with work on wills and deeds. By 1933, he was senior partner in a 20-man Midtown Manhattan law firm. He developed the business habits of smoking cigars and of answering questions only after taking two puffs. During the Great Depression, O&#x27;Malley represented bankrupt companies and enriched himself, while building his thriving law practice. He invested wisely in firms such as the Long Island Rail Road, Brooklyn Borough Gas Company, the New York Subways Advertising Company, a building materials firm, a beer firm and some hotels. His success begot both influence and attention. The Brooklyn Democratic Machine powers such as judge Henry Ughetta and Brooklyn Trust Company president George Vincent McLaughlin were among those who noticed the rising O&#x27;Malley.

==Dodgers==

McLaughlin had been New York City Police Commissioner in 1926, knew O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s father, and had attended Philadelphia Athletics games with O&#x27;Malley when O&#x27;Malley was still at the University of Pennsylvania. McLaughlin hired O&#x27;Malley to administer mortgage foreclosures against failing businesses for the Trust Company. O&#x27;Malley earned McLaughlin&#x27;s confidence by acting in numerous capacities including bodyguard, valet, chauffeur, adopted son, confidant and right-hand man. The trust company owned the estate of Charles Ebbets, who had died in 1925 and owned half of the Brooklyn Dodgers. It was 1933 when Walter again met George V. McLaughlin, president of the Brooklyn Trust Company. O&#x27;Malley was chosen to protect the company&#x27;s financial interests in the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1933. O&#x27;Malley also served as designated driver for the hard drinking McLaughlin. It was through McLaughlin that Walter was brought into the financial arrangements for Ebbets Field in 1940. In 1942, when Larry MacPhail resigned as general manager to serve in the United States Army as a lieutenant colonel, O&#x27;Malley was appointed the attorney for the Dodgers, and he obtained a minority ownership interest on November 1, 1944. He purchased 25% as did Branch Rickey and John L. Smith (president of Pfizer Chemical), while the heirs of Stephen McKeever retained the final quarter. In 1943, he replaced Wendell Willkie as chief legal counsel. Branch Rickey, who had built the St. Louis Cardinals into champions, replaced MacPhail, and O&#x27;Malley began to accumulate stock in the Dodgers.

Rickey was a teetotaler, while O&#x27;Malley enjoyed alcoholic beverages and tobacco. As O&#x27;Malley became more involved in affairs, he became critical of Rickey, the highest-paid individual in baseball, counting salary, attendance bonuses, and player contract sales commissions. O&#x27;Malley and Rickey had very different backgrounds and philosophies. It was O&#x27;Malley who put pressure on Rickey to fire manager Leo Durocher, who O&#x27;Malley felt was a drain on attendance. In board of directors meetings, O&#x27;Malley also opposed Rickey&#x27;s extravagances. When he was with his political friends, he made fun of Rickey at every chance. &quot;Daily News&quot; columnist Jimmy Powers would deride Rickey for selling off players and for general miserliness. When Rickey asked O&#x27;Malley, the team lawyer, if he should sue, O&#x27;Malley said no. Powers&#x27; campaign became so public that after the 1946 season Rickey gave each player a new Studebaker, which gave O&#x27;Malley, a Dodgers shareholder, reason to speak ill of Rickey in the press. It got to the point where everything Rickey did was something O&#x27;Malley derided: O&#x27;Malley thought Rickey&#x27;s construction of the state of the art Vero Beach spring training facility, known as Dodgertown, was extravagant; he thought Rickey&#x27;s investment in the Brooklyn Dodgers of the All-America Football Conference was questionable; he fought Rickey on the team&#x27;s beer sponsor; and he demanded that players return their 1947 World Series rings before receiving the new ones Rickey ordered. As team lawyer, O&#x27;Malley had a role in breaking the racial barrier as well. In particular, he had a significant role in Rickey&#x27;s top-secret search for suitable ballplayers to break the color barrier and then later he had a role in assessing the ongoing legal risks to the franchise. Other accounts, however, suggest that he played a lesser role in Robinson&#x27;s signing.

===Control===
When co-owner Smith died in July 1950, O&#x27;Malley convinced his widow to turn over control of the shares to the Brooklyn Trust Company, which O&#x27;Malley controlled as chief legal counsel. Rickey&#x27;s contract as general manager was set to expire on October 28, 1950. Rickey&#x27;s Dodgers stock was held on margin and he had fully leveraged his life insurance policy. O&#x27;Malley lowballed Rickey with an offer of $346,000 (the purchase price). Rickey demanded $1 million ($ today). O&#x27;Malley eventually pursued a complicated buyout of Rickey, who had received an outside offer from William Zeckendorf of $1 million for his interests. There were varying accounts about the sincerity of the offer because Zeckendorf and Pittsburgh Pirates owner John Galbreath were fraternity brothers, but there is a lot of evidence that he had a sincere interest in acquiring the team. The outside offer triggered a clause in the partnership agreement whereby the asking price of a had to be matched if a current owner wanted to retain control and the third party would be compensated $50,000. The canceled $50,000 check would later include Rickey&#x27;s signature showing that Zeckendorf turned over the $50,000 to Rickey.

O&#x27;Malley replaced Rickey with Buzzie Bavasi. O&#x27;Malley became the president and chief stockholder (owner) on October 26, 1950. O&#x27;Malley assumed the title of president from Rickey, who was a trailblazer in baseball both for instituting the farm system and for breaking the racial barrier with Jackie Robinson. According to pitcher Clem Labine and noted author Roger Kahn, the first thing O&#x27;Malley did when he took over was assign Bavasi to enamor himself to Dick Young of the &quot;Daily News&quot; so that O&#x27;Malley would not have to worry about ever getting bad press from the &quot;Daily News&quot;.

After the ownership transfer, O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s rivalry with Rickey became very public. O&#x27;Malley forbade the speaking of Rickey&#x27;s name in Dodgers offices with transgressors being subjected to a fine. He abolished Rickey&#x27;s title of general manager so that no front office person could perpetuate Rickey&#x27;s role. In addition, when Rickey assumed the title with the Pittsburgh Pirates, O&#x27;Malley arranged for the Dodgers to omit the Pirates from their spring training schedule. Nonetheless, after the transfer, the Dodgers remained successful under O&#x27;Malley: they won the National League pennants in 1952, 1953, 1955—the year of their first World Series championship—and 1956. Under O&#x27;Malley, the Dodgers were the most overtly political post World War II franchise. In 1951, Brooklyn native and United States Congressman Emanuel Celler&#x27;s Judiciary Committee investigated whether the reserve clause was in violation of federal anti-trust laws. Celler represented half of Brooklyn in Congress and O&#x27;Malley used the local press such as the &quot;Brooklyn Eagle&quot; to pressure Celler into backing off of the issue. During the 1951 season, the Dodgers engaged former West Point varsity baseball player and U.S. Army General Douglas MacArthur to lure war veterans. O&#x27;Malley attempted to entice him to take the post of Commissioner of Baseball. After the 1956 season, O&#x27;Malley sold Ebbets Field to Marvin Kratter and agreed to lease the stadium for three years.

Jackie Robinson had been a Rickey protege, and O&#x27;Malley did not have the same respect for Robinson that Rickey did. O&#x27;Malley referred to him as &quot;Rickey&#x27;s prima donna&quot;. Robinson did not like O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s choice for manager, Walter Alston. Robinson liked to argue with umpires, and Alston rarely did so. Robinson derided Alston in the press. In 1955, Alston played Don Hoak at third base during the exhibition season. Robinson voiced his complaints to the press. Robinson did not get along with Bavasi either, and the three seasons under Alston were uncomfortable for Robinson. Robinson announced his retirement in &quot;Look&quot; magazine after the 1956 season.
The signing of Robinson brought the team international fame, making O&#x27;Malley an international baseball ambassador to celebrities such as Iraq&#x27;s King Faisal II. In 1954, Dodgers scout Al Campanis signed Sandy Koufax in large part for two reasons, according to a memo to O&#x27;Malley that said &quot;No. 1, he&#x27;s a Brooklyn boy. No. 2, he&#x27;s Jewish.&quot; Bavasi noted that &quot;there were many people of the Jewish faith in Brooklyn.&quot; During the 1955 season, Dodgers catcher Roy Campanella had a medical billing controversy regarding neurosurgery services by Manhattan doctor Dr. Samuel Shenkman. Shenkman billed $9,500, an amount which Campanella forwarded to the Dodgers and the Dodgers refused to pay. O&#x27;Malley felt the doctor was overcharging: &quot;It appears that [Dr. Shenkman] thought he was operating on Roy&#x27;s bankroll...&quot; The Dodgers had convinced Campanella to have the surgery after enduring a slump in 1954 following MVP seasons in 1951 and 1953. The surgery was intended to restore complete use of his hand.

Despite having won the National League pennants in 1947, 1949, 1952 and 1953, they lost to the New York Yankees in the World Series each time, which frustrated O&#x27;Malley and all Dodgers fans. In 1955, the team won the World Series for the first time in their history. However, attendance declined from a peak of 1.7 million in 1946 and 1947 to just over one million per year in the mid-1950s. With the advent of the affordable automobile and post-war prosperity, Brooklyn&#x27;s formerly heterogeneous, middle-class fan base for the Dodgers began to splinter. A large white flight took place, and Ebbets Field&#x27;s shabby condition and lack of parking spaces led to the loss of fans who relocated to Long Island.

 O&#x27;Malley tried to raise money and get the political backing to build a new ballpark elsewhere in Brooklyn. The one person whose backing he needed was Robert Moses, a powerful figure who influenced development in New York through the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority. O&#x27;Malley envisioned a domed stadium near the Long Island Rail Road station on Brooklyn&#x27;s west end, and even invited R. Buckminster Fuller to design the structure; Fuller, in conjunction with graduate students from Princeton University, constructed a model of the &quot;Dodgers&#x27; Dome&quot;. Moses did not like O&#x27;Malley and derided O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s pro-Brooklyn and pro-Irish sentiments in the press. O&#x27;Malley wanted to build a new Brooklyn Dodgers stadium at Flatbush and Atlantic Avenue, but Moses wanted the Dodgers to move to Queens and play in Flushing Meadows Park (the location where the New York Mets play today). Although O&#x27;Malley lined up bipartisan political support including New York Governor W. Averell Harriman, Moses blocked the sale of the land necessary for the planned new Brooklyn stadium. O&#x27;Malley bought the Chicago Cubs minor league baseball team, the Los Angeles Angels, as well as their stadium, Wrigley Field, from Philip Wrigley in 1956 at the winter baseball meetings, and during spring training, Los Angeles Mayor Norris Poulson traveled to the Dodgers&#x27; training camp at Vero Beach, Florida in an attempt to lure the franchise. O&#x27;Malley met with Moses at Moses&#x27; home after purchasing the Angels to discuss final offers from New York to no avail. O&#x27;Malley noticed the great success of the Milwaukee Braves after their move from Boston in 1953. They had a 43,000-seat stadium, parking for 10,000 cars and an arrangement for no city or real estate taxes. He also felt the limitations of the small landlocked Ebbets Field, which held less than 32,111 fans and accommodated only 700 parking spaces. Attendance between 1950 and 1957 was between 1,020,000 in 1954 and 1,280,000 in 1951. O&#x27;Malley had sold the ballpark to Marvin Kratter for about $2,000,000 on October 31, 1956. The deal included a five-year lease that allowed the Dodgers to move out as soon as the proposed domed stadium in Downtown Brooklyn was ready for business.

Ultimately, O&#x27;Malley decided to leave Brooklyn for Los Angeles in 1957. Robert Moses authority Robert Caro and other contemporaneous sports historians felt that Moses was more to blame for the Dodgers&#x27; leaving. The 1956 season had marked the end of the Jackie Robinson era in which the Dodgers won six pennants, lost two pennant series and finished as low as third only once in ten years, and the new era would begin in a new home. During the 1957 season, he negotiated a deal for the Dodgers to be viewed on an early pay TV network by the Skiatron Corporation subject to the approval of other teams and owners. The rest of baseball was not ready for the risks of such a venture and it did not pan out at the time.

===Move to Los Angeles===

O&#x27;Malley is considered by baseball experts to be &quot;perhaps the most influential owner of baseball&#x27;s early expansion era.&quot; Following the 1957 Major League Baseball season, he moved the Dodgers to Los Angeles, and New York&#x27;s Dodgers fans felt betrayed. O&#x27;Malley was also influential in getting the rival New York Giants to move west to become the San Francisco Giants, thus preserving the two teams&#x27; longstanding rivalry. He needed another team to go with him, for had he moved out west alone, the St. Louis Cardinals— away— would have been the closest National League team. The joint move made West Coast road trips more economical for visiting teams. O&#x27;Malley invited San Francisco Mayor George Christopher to New York to meet with Giants owner Horace Stoneham. Stoneham was considering moving the Giants to Minnesota, but he was convinced to join O&#x27;Malley on the West Coast at the end of the 1957 campaign. Since the meetings occurred during the 1957 season and against the wishes of Commissioner of Baseball Ford Frick, there was media gamesmanship.

On April 15, 1958, the Dodgers and Giants ushered in West Coast baseball at Seals Stadium. When O&#x27;Malley moved the Dodgers from Brooklyn the story transcended the world of sport and he found himself on the cover of &quot;Time&quot;. The cover art for the issue was created by sports cartoonist Willard Mullin, long noted for his caricature of the &quot;Brooklyn Bum&quot; that personified the team. The dual moves broke the hearts of New York&#x27;s National League fans but ultimately were successful for both franchises – and for Major League Baseball as a whole. In fact, the move was an immediate success as well since the Dodgers set a major league single-game attendance record in their first home appearance with 78,672 fans. During the first year after the move, the Dodgers made $500,000 more profit than any other Major League Baseball team and paid off all of their debts. This did not assuage many Dodgers fans in New York; many years later, newspaper writers Pete Hamill and Jack Newfield each challenged the other to choose the three worst people of the 20th century. Independently, they produced identical lists: &quot;Hitler, Stalin, O&#x27;Malley.&quot;

In the years following the move of the New York clubs, Major League Baseball added two completely new teams in California, as well as two in Texas, two in Canada, two in Florida, one each in the Twin Cities, Denver, and Phoenix, and two teams at separate times in Seattle. In addition, the Athletics, who had already moved to Kansas City, moved to Oakland; Kansas City would get a new team the year after the A&#x27;s moved to Oakland. The National League returned to New York with the introduction of the New York Mets four years after the Dodgers and Giants had departed for California.

When he made the decision to relocate in October 1957 to Los Angeles, O&#x27;Malley did not have an established location for where the Dodgers would play in 1958. O&#x27;Malley worked out a deal with Los Angeles County and the state of California to rent the Los Angeles Coliseum for $200,000 per year for 1958 and 1959, plus 10% of the ticket revenue, and all concession profits for the first nine games of each season following an opening series with the San Francisco Giants. The Dodgers temporarily took up residence while they awaited the completion of 56,000-seat capacity Dodger Stadium, built for $23 million. The Dodgers were soon drawing more than two million fans a year. They remained successful on the field as well, winning the World Series in 1959, 1963, and 1965. The Los Angeles Angels also played in Dodger Stadium from 1962 to 1965.

====Controversy regarding land deal with city of Los Angeles====
The dealings with the city of Los Angeles after the Vero Beach meeting raised questions. The initial offer of and tax exemptions was determined to be illegal and improper. The minor league San Diego Padres owners led an opposition effort to stop the transfer of in Chavez Ravine via a referendum. O&#x27;Malley engaged in an extensive marketing and media campaign that helped the referendum pass, but there were extensive subsequent taxpayer lawsuits. The plaintiffs initially prevailed in some of these suits. Finally, during the middle of the 1959 season, the Los Angeles City Council was able to approve the final parcel for the stadium.

One legendary negotiation with the city over concession revenue is that in O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s move to the Coliseum he agreed to accept concession revenues from only half the team&#x27;s games—the home half. The land was eventually transferred by the Los Angeles city government to O&#x27;Malley by an agreement which required O&#x27;Malley and the Dodgers to design, build, privately finance and maintain a 50,000-seat stadium; develop a youth recreation center on the land. O&#x27;Malley was to pay $500,000 initially, plus annual payments of $60,000 for 20 years; and pay $345,000 in property taxes starting in 1962, putting the land on the tax rolls. Also, the Dodgers would transfer team-owned Wrigley Field, then appraised at $2.2 million, to the city. The city exchanged &quot;300 acres, more or less, in the Chavez Ravine area&quot;, while L.A. County Supervisors unanimously agreed to provide $2.74 million for access roads. In addition, the Dodgers also had to pay $450,000 for territorial rights to the Pacific Coast League, whose Los Angeles Angels and Hollywood Stars suspended play.

===Management philosophy===
His son, Peter O&#x27;Malley, described his management style as follows: &quot;As president, the way he ran the business, he believed in stability and very little turnover. It was the strength of the organization. The management team worked as well as the team on the field.&quot; This is evidenced in many ways, including the long tenure of both Walter Alston and Tommy Lasorda as Dodgers managers and Vin Scully, the broadcast voice of the Dodgers. Alston was repeatedly rehired to consecutive one-year contracts from 1954 to 1976 until he retired. Then Lasorda, who had been a long-time employee in as a coach and minor league baseball manager, took over as manager for another 20 years. Scully was the voice of the Dodgers for 67 seasons until his retirement in 2016, the infield of first baseman Steve Garvey, second baseman Davey Lopes, shortstop Bill Russell and third baseman Ron Cey was the longest-running intact infield in major league history. Furthermore, O&#x27;Malley is said to have kept Bowie Kuhn in office as the Commissioner of Baseball until O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s death. O&#x27;Malley rewarded loyal employee Bavasi by allowing the San Diego Padres franchise to establish an expansion team with Bavasi as president in Southern California. Alston said O&#x27;Malley convinced him that when he signed his first one-year contract it could be a lifetime job by pointing out that &quot;signing one-year contracts can mean a lifetime job, if you keep signing enough of them.&quot; Although O&#x27;Malley had good stories of loyalty with some employees, there were several stories of O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s frugality.

Although O&#x27;Malley was loyal to his employees, he did not take kindly to demands from employees such as manager Charlie Dressen&#x27;s request for a three-year contract. When Dressen requested a multi-year contract after losing a second consecutive World Series to the Yankees, he was released. Then when he hired Walter Alston as a replacement, he made it clear to the press that Alston would only receive one-year contracts and would not attempt to show up the management in the national media. There were rumors that Alston even signed blank contracts in the fall and showed up in the spring to find out his salary. O&#x27;Malley also did not support those who remained friends with Rickey, which was a large factor in Red Barber quitting as Dodgers announcer.

O&#x27;Malley also engaged in several high-profile salary disputes with his players. In 1960, he refused to pay right fielder Carl Furillo for the 1960 season after he was released early due to injury, which led Furillo to sue the team. Because of this, O&#x27;Malley allegedly blacklisted Furillo from any job in baseball. In 1966, Sandy Koufax and Don Drysdale engaged in a joint contract holdout. They had earned $70,000 and $75,000 respectively during the 1965 season, during which the Dodgers won the World Series. Both wanted a raise, however, and held out jointly to get a fairer contract negotiation. They demanded three-year $167,000 per year contracts and hired an agent, an entertainment lawyer named J. William Hayes, to negotiate on their behalf; at the time, both multi-year contracts and sports agents were highly unusual. The pair held out until less than two weeks before Opening Day; they received one-year $125,000 and $110,000 contracts respectively.

O&#x27;Malley liked clubhouse turmoil only slightly less than free agent disloyalty. When he traded Maury Wills to the Pittsburgh Pirates following consecutive National League pennants, it was attributed to Wills having quit during the middle of the Dodgers&#x27; post-season tour of Japan, even though the shortstop only did so because his ailing knees needed rest.

===Retirement from presidency===
On March 17, 1970, Walter turned over the presidency of the team to his son Peter, remaining as chairman until his death in 1979. Peter O&#x27;Malley held the position until 1998 when the team was sold to Rupert Murdoch. The team remained successful on the field under Peter and won the World Series in both 1981 and 1988. They remained successful at the box office as well: by the end of the 1980s, they had not only became the first franchise to draw three million fans, but also they had done it more times than all other franchises combined.

During the 1970s, O&#x27;Malley was credited for stagemanaging Lasorda&#x27;s career. Lasorda become known for his die-hard Dodgers clichés, such as describing the color of his blood by saying &quot;Cut me, I bleed Dodger blue.&quot; It was even said that the reciprocal loyalty and respect between Lasorda and O&#x27;Malley was so high that O&#x27;Malley gave Lasorda a tombstone as a gift that had an inscription that read &quot;TOMMY LASORDA, A DODGER&quot;.

The McKeevers held their 25% interest in the Dodgers until 1975 when Dearie McKeever died. They sold out to O&#x27;Malley making him the sole owner of the Dodgers. Also during 1975, the Dodgers franchise was embroiled in the Andy Messersmith controversy that led to the Seitz decision, which struck down baseball&#x27;s reserve clause and opened up the sport to modern free agency. Messersmith and the Dodgers were unable to come to contract terms in part because of a then unheard of no-trade clause demand, and Messersmith pitched the entire season without a contract under the reserve clause, which stated that team has the right to extend the prior years contract one year if a player does not agree to terms. Teams had previously had the right to continue such re-signings year after year. This gave owners the right to issue &quot;take it or leave it&quot; offers to the players. Although the Dodgers and Messersmith nearly hammered out a deal monetarily, they could not come to terms on the no-trade clause. Supposedly Major League Baseball instructed the Dodgers not to surrender such a clause for the good of the game. The Seitz decision limited the re-signings to one year, and since Messersmith performed quite well in 1975, winning a Gold Glove Award and leading the National League in complete games and shutouts, while finishing second in earned run average, he was a valuable talent. He earned offers from six different teams. Messersmith became the first free agent, except for Catfish Hunter who had been declared a 1974 free agent by breach of contract. O&#x27;Malley felt the price wars would be the downfall of baseball because the fans only have so much money. The scenario led to an eighteen-day lockout during spring training in 1976 over the prospect of dozens of players playing becoming free agents and the inability to redesign the reserve clause.

==Personal life==
On September 5, 1931, he married Katherine Elizabeth &quot;Kay&quot; Hanson (1907–79), whom he had dated since high school, at Saint Malachy&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church in Manhattan. Kay had been diagnosed with laryngeal cancer in 1927 before the engagement and had to have her larynx removed. She was unable to speak above a whisper the rest of her life. Edwin O&#x27;Malley encouraged Walter to break off his engagement, and after Walter refused his parents did not attend the wedding. The couple had two children: Therese &quot;Terry&quot; O&#x27;Malley Seidler (born 1933) and Peter O&#x27;Malley (born 1937).

In 1944, he remodelled his parents&#x27; summer house in Amityville, New York and relocated his family there from Brooklyn. The house was next door to the house Kay had grown up and where her parents lived.

O&#x27;Malley was a smoker who golfed occasionally, but more commonly gardened for recreation. As a family man, he attended church regularly, attended Peter&#x27;s football games at LaSalle Academy, and chaperoned his daughter&#x27;s dances. On summer weekends, he took the family sailing on his boat, which was named &quot;Dodger&quot;.

Later in life, the O&#x27;Malleys split their time between their homes in Hancock Park, Los Angeles and in Lake Arrowhead, California.

==Death and legacy==
O&#x27;Malley was diagnosed with cancer, and he sought treatment at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. He died of congestive heart failure on August 9, 1979, at the Methodist Hospital in Rochester. O&#x27;Malley had never returned to Brooklyn before his death. He was buried at Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California. His wife Kay had died a few weeks earlier.

Although O&#x27;Malley had later retired and had relinquished control of the Dodgers before his death, he remains hated in Brooklyn for moving the Dodgers to the West Coast. At one time, Brooklyn Dodgers fans hated O&#x27;Malley so much that he was routinely mentioned along with Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin as the most villainous 20th-century men; one version of a joke went, &quot;If a Brooklyn man finds himself in a room with Hitler, Stalin, and O&#x27;Malley, but has only two bullets, what does he do? Shoot O&#x27;Malley twice.&quot; Some still consider him among the worst three men of the 20th century. Much of the animosity was not just for moving the team, but robbing Brooklyn of the sense of a cohesive cultural and social identity that a major sports franchise provides. Despite the long-standing animosity of Brooklyn fans and their supporters in baseball, O&#x27;Malley was posthumously inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2008 after having been elected by the Veterans Committee with the minimum number of votes necessary for induction.

His legacy is that of changing the mindset of a league that had the St. Louis Cardinals as the National League&#x27;s southernmost and westernmost team (the Philadelphia Athletics of the American League had moved further west to Kansas City just three years prior). Tommy Lasorda said upon hearing of his election to the Hall, &quot;He&#x27;s a pioneer. He made a tremendous change in the game, opening up the West Coast to Major League Baseball.&quot; When asked how he wanted to be remembered, O&#x27;Malley said, &quot;for planting a tree.&quot; The tree provided the branches to open up the West Coast to baseball, but O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s son remembers his father&#x27;s 28 years on Major League Baseball&#x27;s executive council as service that &quot;was instrumental in the early stages of the game&#x27;s international growth.&quot; His contributions to baseball were widely recognized even before his Hall of Fame election: he was ranked 8th and 11th respectively by ABC Sports and &quot;The Sporting News&quot; in their lists of the most influential sports figures of the 20th century.

On July 7, 2009, Walter O&#x27;Malley was inducted into the Irish American Baseball Hall of Fame along with two other Dodger icons: slugger Steve Garvey and announcer Vin Scully. &quot;Over the years, we have learned more of his decade-long quest to build a new stadium in Brooklyn and about how those efforts were thwarted by city officials. Perhaps this induction will inspire fans who themselves started new lives outside the borough to reconsider their thoughts about Walter O&#x27;Malley&quot;, said John Mooney, curator of the Irish American Baseball Hall of Fame. &quot;He privately built one of baseball&#x27;s more beautiful ballparks, Dodger Stadium, and set attendance records annually. While New York is the home of the Irish American Baseball Hall of Fame, it seeks to honor inductees whose impact was and is national.&quot;

On August 10, 2024, O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s name was added to the Dodgers&#x27; Ring of Honor, alongside the franchise&#x27;s retired numbers and microphones.

==Popular culture==
O&#x27;Malley was mentioned several times in Danny Kaye&#x27;s 1962 song tribute &quot;D-O-D-G-E-R-S (Oh, Really? No, O&#x27;Malley!)&quot;, which spins a tale of a fantasy game between the Dodgers and the Giants. At one point, the umpire&#x27;s call goes against the home team:

:&quot;Down in the dugout, Alston glowers&quot;
:&quot;Up in the booth, Vin Scully frowns;&quot;
:&quot;Out in the stands, O&#x27;Malley grins...&quot;
:&quot;Attendance 50,000!&quot;
:&quot;So ...what does O&#x27;Malley do? CHARGE!!&quot;

O&#x27;Malley was featured prominently in the HBO documentary film &quot;Brooklyn Dodgers: Ghosts of Flatbush&quot;, which chronicled his executive management of the Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers. The documentary focuses on the post World War II glory years of the franchise and presents a compelling case that O&#x27;Malley truly wanted to keep the Dodgers in Brooklyn in a stadium near the Long Island Rail Road&#x27;s Atlantic Terminal, but he was unable to get the proper support from urban planner Robert Moses.

<text>&quot;Alberta&quot; is the regional anthem of the province of Alberta, Canada. It was adopted as the official provincial song in preparation for the province&#x27;s centennial celebrations in 2005.

The song was selected following a competition mandated by the &quot;Alberta Official Song Act&quot;, introduced in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta by Calgary Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) Wayne Cao in May 2001 and passed by the legislature in November of that year. The chosen song, selected by the 13-member Alberta Official Song Committee, was written by Mary Kieftenbeld. The song has been recorded in country and pop versions.

==Lyrics==
:Flatlands, rollin&#x27; plains
:Clear blue skies, prairie rains;
:A tapestry of colours in the fall.
:Snow covered mountain tops,
:Wheat fields, canola crops;
:Alberta has it all.

:Alberta is calling me.
:Home sweet home, it&#x27;s where I&#x27;m proud to be.
:Alberta is calling me.
:Livin&#x27; right I&#x27;m feelin&#x27; free.

:First Nations built the land
:Fur trade, way back then.
:We&#x27;ve come a long way since that.
:Agriculture, lumberjacks,
:Oil derricks, natural gas;
:There is no turnin&#x27; back.

:Alberta is calling me.
:Home sweet home, it&#x27;s where I&#x27;m proud to be.
:Alberta is calling me.
:Livin&#x27; right I&#x27;m feelin&#x27; free.

:Bridge:
:Culture diverse as it can be.
:This is the land of opportunity.
:Welcoming friends, night and day.
:That&#x27;s the way I pray Alberta stays.

<text>The Schweizer Aircraft Corporation was an American manufacturer of sailplanes, agricultural aircraft and helicopters located in Horseheads, New York. It was incorporated in 1939 by three Schweizer brothers (Paul, William, and Ernest), who built their first glider, the SGP 1-1, in 1930. Previously the oldest privately owned aircraft company in the United States, Schweizer was acquired by Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation of Stratford, Connecticut in 2004, and became a diversified aerospace company. Schweizer Aircraft ceased operations in 2012. It was sold to Schweizer RSG in 2018 and production lines were opened in Fort Worth, Texas. The company was producing two helicopter models in 2021. The 300C and 300CBI

==History==
The company grew out of the Mercury Glider Club which produced the first two Schweizer gliders in the Schweizers&#x27; barn. The company was originally called the Schweizer Metal Aircraft Company. Attorney Bob McDowell indicated to the Schweizers that they should move their manufacturing operation out of their father&#x27;s barn and relocate to the Elmira, New York area. The Schweizers received the suggestion positively as they needed more space to produce gliders, but they had no money with which to make the move.

McDowell convinced Elmira Industries Inc, the local business development corporation, to provide space for the Schweizers on the second floor of the Elmira Knitting Mill Building in return for stock in the company. This resulted in the Schweizer Metal Aircraft Company becoming the Schweizer Aircraft Corporation, with a sale of shares to Elmira Industries, local businessmen and soaring pilots.

===Helicopters===
Schweizer primarily produced light, piston-engined helicopters for use in utility and flight-training roles. The Schweizer 300CBi, originally designed and manufactured by Hughes aircraft as the Hughes 269 for the United States Army, is one of the most widely used training helicopters in the world. In 1986, Schweizer acquired all rights to the helicopter from McDonnell Douglas, who had purchased Hughes Helicopters in 1984. After Schweizer acquired the FAA Type Certificate, the helicopter was known for a short time as the Schweizer-Hughes 300C and then simply, the Schweizer 300C.

The basic design remained unchanged over the years. Between Hughes and Schweizer, nearly 3,000 copies of the Model 269/300 have been built and flown over the last 50 years. Schweizer continued to develop the Model 300 by adding a turbine and redesigning the body to create the Schweizer 330, and then further developments led to the development of the Schweizer 333.

An improved version in the series, the Sikorsky S-434, was released in 2008.

Helicopter products offered by the company in February 2009 included the 300C, 300CBi, and 333.

In 2011 and 2012 Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation laid off all the workers and closed the plant. After the sale of the company, helicopter production was restarted in Fort Worth, Texas in 2018.

===Sailplanes===
Schweizer is known for its popular line of gliders (sailplanes), the earliest of which (the model SGP 1-1) was produced in 1930. Although very few of the early gliders were built, later models gained popularity, such as the SGS 2-8 and 2-12, which were adopted by the U.S. Army Air Corps for training as the TG-2 and TG-3, respectively.
The Schweizer SGS 1-23 was a world class competition and record setting glider between its first flight in 1948 and the end of its production in 1967.

In the 1950s and 1960s the Schweizer Aircraft Corporation designed and manufactured the very popular SGS 1-26 and SGS 2-33 gliders. In the 1970s the single place SGS 1-34 (and 1-34R retractable gear version) was introduced. They are easy to fly, with simple construction, and are quite rugged and forgiving. Later in the 1970s and 1980s the higher performance t-tail SGS 1-35 and SGS 1-36 Sprite were introduced. A powered light aircraft, the Schweizer SA 1-30 was tested, but did not go into production.

The 2-33 was adopted by the United States Air Force Academy as the TG-4, for use in introductory airmanship training. The Academy used over a dozen such gliders until 2002 when they were replaced by more modern sailplanes. The Royal Canadian Air Cadets continue to operate a fleet of over seventy 2-33As.

The popular Schweizer gliders the single-seat SGS 1-26, the two-seat 2-33, and the two or three-seat SGS 2-32 can still be found at many gliding clubs across the U.S.

===Ag Cat===
Schweizer produced the Grumman G-164 Ag Cat, a single-engine biplane agricultural aircraft originally developed by Grumman in the 1950s. Under the contract with Grumman the airplane was built almost continuously between 1957 and 1981. During this period of time Schweizer built 2,455 of the airplanes.

In 1981 Schweizer bought the rights to the design and continued production under the name Schweizer Ag Cat. In 1995 Schweizer sold the rights to the Ag Cat to Ag-Cat Corp. of Malden, Texas. In February 2001 the design was sold to Allied Ag-Cat Productions Inc. of Walnut Ridge, Arkansas. Allied Ag-Cat is not producing new aircraft although a related company operates a large fleet of Ag-Cats.

The basic airframe incorporates many safety innovations, including a pressurized cockpit to keep pesticides out, air conditioning and a fuselage structure that is designed to progressively collapse in the event of a collision.

===Teal amphibian===
In 1972 Schweizer hired David Thurston and production of his Thurston Teal was part of the agreement to work at Schweizer. The company produced three Schweizer TSC-1A1 Teals and nine TSC-1A2 Teal IIs before production was moved to Teal Aircraft in 1976.

===Reconnaissance aircraft===
The development of the Schweizer SGM 2-37 two-place motor glider for the United States Air Force Academy in 1982 led to a new area of expertise for the company. In the mid-1960s Lockheed had used the Schweizer SGS 2-32 sailplane as the basis for its YO-3 quiet reconnaissance aircraft. Schweizer decided to develop the SGM 2-37 into a similar concept aircraft as the YO-3. The result was the SA 2-37A and B, known as the RG-8A in military use.

The RG-8A was later developed by the company into the twin piston-engined and twin-boom SA 2-38 Condor with the US military designation of RU-38A Twin Condor. This design was further refined into the turboprop-powered RU-38B Twin Condor. The RU-38 was still in production in 2008.

It is believed the US Drug Enforcement Administration purchased aircraft designated Shadowhawk from Schweizer. The aircraft had a poor operational history. They may be designated SA 38B.

===Other projects===
In partnership with Northrop Grumman (formerly Ryan Aeronautical), Schweizer developed the MQ-8 Fire Scout helicopter UAV.

Schweizer participated in development of Sikorsky&#x27;s X-2 Demonstrator, a prototype aircraft using co-axial rotor blades with a pusher propeller for extra forward thrust.

===Sale to Schweizer RSG===
United Technology Corporation (UTC), then parent company of Sikorsky, shut down Schweizer in December 2012. It was sold to a new company, Schweizer RSG, in 2018 and the production lines were restarted in Fort Worth, Texas. The company was producing three models in 2021, the 300C, 300CBi, and 333.

<text>Woodside is a town Victoria, Australia. At the , Woodside and the surrounding area had a population of 364.

Until its demolition in 2015, the tallest construction of the southern hemisphere — the aerial mast of the VLF Transmitter Woodside — was located near the village. There is also a nearby beach of the same name.

A railway connected Woodside with the railhead of Port Albert from 22 June 1923 until 25 May 1953.

An Australian oil and gas company, Woodside Petroleum, is named after this area.

The Woodside Beach Hotel was recently reopened in 2022, after many years shut down. It was funded by an 11-person ownership group, headed by local AFL player Josh Dunkley.

<text>The SIMON is an Israeli bullet-trap rifle grenade designed to breach through doors, developed by Rafael Advanced Defense Systems. It is intended for use with 5.56 mm rifles such as the M4 carbine.

==Overview==
The system consists of a bullet-trap tail section which slides over the muzzle of the rifle, an explosive midsection and a front standoff rod. The grenade is propelled by a normal ball or tracer round to a maximum range of and is detonated by the impact of the standoff rod against the door to be breached, the standoff distance allowing the blast wave to affect as much of the door surface as possible, negating any need to aim for hinges or locks.

A version which is manually attached to the door is also available, known as &quot;static SIMON&quot;.

* - A variant of the SIMON 120 is in service with the U.S. Army as the M100 Grenade Rifle Entry Munition (GREM). Changes from the original specification involved fuzing and reliability issues. An inert round, the M101 GREM-Target Practice (GREM-TP) allows training for accuracy without the explosive hazard. The system was given a U.S. Army award as one of the top ten best inventions of 2005.
* - Used by the Belgian Federal Police Special Units supported by the French GIGN during an anti-terrorism raid in Verviers (Belgium) in 2015.

<text>Rocka Rolla is the debut studio album by English heavy metal band Judas Priest, released on 6 September 1974 by Gull Records. It was produced by Rodger Bain, who had made a name for himself as the producer of Black Sabbath&#x27;s first three albums and Budgie&#x27;s first two albums. It is the only album to feature drummer John Hinch.

==Background==
According to the band, the entire album was played live in the studio rather than having individual musicians record alone.

According to the band there were technical problems in the studio, resulting in poor sound quality and a hiss through the album. Guitarist Glenn Tipton had just joined when recording of &quot;Rocka Rolla&quot; began; his only songwriting contributions accepted by producer Rodger Bain were on the title track and &quot;Run of the Mill&quot;. He did come up with the songs &quot;Tyrant&quot;, &quot;Epitaph&quot;, and &quot;Ripper&quot;, but Bain considered them not commercial enough and rejected them. Bain also rejected the concert staple &quot;Whiskey Woman&quot; which later, with contributions from Tipton, morphed into &quot;Victim of Changes&quot;. These songs were eventually all included on their next album, &quot;Sad Wings of Destiny&quot;. In addition, &quot;Winter&quot;, &quot;Deep Freeze&quot; and &quot;Winter Retreat&quot; form a suite, but are listed as separate tracks and divided as such on some versions of the CD release.

Several of the songs on the album feature contributions from the band&#x27;s previous frontman Al Atkins and had been regular parts of their live performances in Manchester, where the band had achieved a cult following during the previous few years. The track &quot;Caviar and Meths&quot; was originally a 14-minute effort penned by Atkins, Downing, and Hill but due to time constraints, only the intro was recorded for the album. A longer 7-minute version of the song appears on Atkins&#x27;s 1998 album &quot;Victim of Changes&quot;. That album also contains covers of &quot;Winter&quot; and &quot;Never Satisfied&quot;.

At this time, the band had not yet developed their signature look of leather and studs. They had appeared on British television show &quot;The Old Grey Whistle Test&quot; in 1975, performing &quot;Rocka Rolla&quot; and &quot;Dreamer Deceiver&quot;, and their wardrobe was very &quot;hippified&quot; as journalist Malcolm Dome put it. This footage was included on the &quot;Electric Eye&quot; DVD. In addition, the album is more blues/hard rock-oriented than their later releases, and also has some slight progressive rock influences that would continue through to &quot;Stained Class&quot;, but to a lesser extent, and would be abandoned in later releases. This makes the album&#x27;s style virtually unrecognizable when compared with later Priest albums, although &quot;Rocka Rolla&quot; does feature dual guitars, and &quot;Run of the Mill&quot; is the first song that was explicitly designed for Halford&#x27;s, rather than Atkins&#x27;, vocal range.

Drummer John Hinch was dismissed in 1975 before the next record was recorded. Tipton would later refer to him as being &quot;musically inadequate&quot; for the band&#x27;s future plans.

The album was reissued several times over the years, and in 1984 it was issued with a different sleeve design. The original &quot;bottle cap&quot; album cover art was initially intended by designer John Pasche for use with an unspecified Rolling Stones album. The band had filed a lawsuit with the Coca-Cola company. The re-issue cover art (by artist Melvyn Grant, and originally used as the cover for the novel &quot;The Steel Tsar&quot;) was also used for the US cover of &quot;Ballistix&quot; for the TurboGrafx-16 and Amiga.

Most of the songs from &quot;Rocka Rolla&quot; have not been performed by Judas Priest live since the mid-late 1970s, although Halford&#x27;s solo band performed &quot;Never Satisfied&quot; during live shows in 2003, and the same song was part of the setlist of the Epitaph World Tour. &quot;Rocka Rolla&quot; was performed for the first time since 1976 at Bloodstock Open Air in 2021.

The tour for &quot;Rocka Rolla&quot; was Judas Priest&#x27;s first international tour with dates in Germany, Holland, Norway and Denmark including one show at Hotel Klubben in Tønsberg, one hour from Oslo, Norway which scored them a somewhat negative review in the local press.

==Reception==
The album was released to very little reception selling &quot;only a few thousand copies&quot;. Because it flopped, the band found themselves in dire financial straits. In particular, they talked of nights in which they were starving and didn&#x27;t know when they were going to get their next meal. They tried to enter into an agreement with Gull Records to pay them £50 a week, but Gull, which was also suffering economic woes, refused. In a retrospective review, AllMusic gave &quot;Rocka Rolla&quot; a rating of 2.5 out of five stars, and said that while it was a &quot;sketchy and underfocused debut&quot;, the album &quot;definitely hints at Judas Priest&#x27;s potential and originality&quot;.

== Track listing ==

=== Track notes ===
The original UK LP has a longer version of &quot;Rocka Rolla&quot; than the version used for the US LP release, and most CD releases. It has an extra verse and chorus at the beginning of the song.

The very rare first printing of the UK LP has the words &quot;Thanks for the words Al!&quot; printed last in the credits in the blue circle on the back cover. This, presumably a reference to original singer Al Atkins, has been removed on other versions of the Gull vinyl.

On some versions of the CD release, &quot;Rocka Rolla&quot; is timed at 4:00 and &quot;Winter&quot; at 0:45, becoming a medley but remaining on separate tracks. Some releases, e.g. &quot;Hero, Hero&quot; also combine &quot;Winter&quot;, &quot;Deep Freeze&quot; and &quot;Winter Retreat&quot; into one track. The iTunes version combines those three plus &quot;Cheater&quot; into one track.

The version of &quot;Diamonds &amp; Rust&quot; that appears on the re-release is actually from the &quot;Sad Wings of Destiny&quot; sessions and not the version that appears on &quot;Sin After Sin&quot;. It was probably included to provide interest in &quot;Rocka Rolla&quot;, an album that would have been unknown to many of the band&#x27;s fans due to the band not playing songs from it live after the 1970s.

&quot;Rocka Rolla&quot; features Judas Priest&#x27;s longest track, &quot;Run of the Mill&quot; (8:34), prior to &quot;Cathedral Spires&quot; (9:17) from &quot;Jugulator&quot; in 1997. It is also the longest track co-written by Halford, Downing and Tipton prior to &quot;Lochness&quot; (13:28) from &quot;Angel of Retribution&quot; in 2005.

&quot;Rocka Rolla&quot; was covered by Swedish black metal band Vondur in the EP &quot;The Galactic Rock n&#x27; Roll Empire&quot;

==Release==
The album, along with &quot;Sad Wings of Destiny&quot;, owned by Gull at that time, was reissued as part of the band&#x27;s limited edition &quot;50 Heavy Metal Years of Music&quot; box-set, released on October 2021, through Sony Music Entertainment and Legacy Recordings.

In 2023, the band regained control of the recordings of &quot;Rocka Rolla&quot; and also their second album via the company Reach Music and are planning a 50th anniversary release of the album for 2024.

Hill confirmed in a 2024 interview with Detroit radio station WRIF that the album had been &quot;re-engineered&quot; by Priest collaborator Tom Allom in preparation for a release that was &quot;a few weeks away.&quot;

<text>The applied arts are all the arts that apply design and decoration to everyday and essentially practical objects in order to make them aesthetically pleasing. The term is used in distinction to the fine arts, which are those that produce objects with no practical use, whose only purpose is to be beautiful or stimulate the intellect in some way. In practice, the two often overlap. Applied arts largely overlap with decorative arts, and the modern making of applied art is usually called design.

Examples of applied arts are:
* Industrial design – mass-produced objects.
* Sculpture – also counted as a fine art.
* Architecture – also counted as a fine art.
* Crafts – also counted as a fine art.
* Ceramic art
* Automotive design
* Fashion design
* Calligraphy
* Interior design
* Graphic design
* Cartographic (map) design

==Movements==
Art movements that mostly operated in the applied arts include the following. In addition, major artistic styles such as Neoclassicism, Gothic and others cover both the fine and applied or decorative arts. 
* Art Nouveau 
* Art Deco
* Arts and Crafts Movement
* Bauhaus
* Productivism

<text>Made Again is a 1996 double live album by Marillion, their first live recording with singer Steve Hogarth. The first disc contains material recorded in London on the &quot;Holidays in Eden&quot; tour (1991) and in Rotterdam on the &quot;Afraid of Sunlight&quot; tour (1995); the second disc consists of a full live version of the album &quot;Brave&quot; recorded in Paris in 1994. Outside of the UK, distribution would be handled by the then independent record label Castle Communications, who would also release the band&#x27;s next three studio albums.

== Background ==
&quot;Made Again&quot;&#x27;s format echoes that of the previous live album &quot;The Thieving Magpie&quot; (1988), which also documented a four studio-album period, contained a complete concept album on one disc (in that case, &quot;Misplaced Childhood&quot;), and marked the end of an era (Fish&#x27;s departure). &quot;Made Again&quot;, in turn, was the final album Marillion released under their then-current contract with EMI Records.

== Reissues ==
The album has been reissued by Castle Communications in 2001 and by Sanctuary Records in 2006. In addition, all the full concerts from London, Paris, and Rotterdam have been remixed by Mike Hunter and included on the book-set reissues of &quot;Holidays in Eden&quot;, &quot;Brave&quot; and &quot;Afraid of Sunlight&quot;.

<doc id="1333915" wikidata="Q5209500" url="?curid=1333915" title="Dainin Katagiri">
<text>Jikai , was a Sōtō Zen priest and teacher, and the founding abbot of Minnesota Zen Meditation Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where he served from 1972 until his death from cancer in 1990. He is also the founder of Hokyoji Zen Practice Community in Eitzen, Minnesota. Before becoming first abbot of the Minnesota Zen Meditation Center, Katagiri had worked at the Zenshuji Soto Zen Mission in Los Angeles and had also been of great service to Shunryu Suzuki at the San Francisco Zen Center, particularly from 1969 until Suzuki&#x27;s death in 1971. Katagiri was important in helping bring Zen Buddhism from Japan to the United States during its formative years. He is also the credited author of several books compiled from his talks.

==Biography==
===Zen studies===
Dainin Katagiri was born in Osaka, Japan on January 19, 1928. He was ordained a monk by and named a Dharma heir of Daicho Hayashi at Taizo-in in Fukui, and went on to study under Eko Hashimoto at Eiheiji for three years. After Eiheiji Katagiri enrolled at Komazawa University—the renowned Sōtō institution in Tokyo, Japan—majoring in Buddhist studies. In 1963 Katagiri was sent by the Soto Headquarters Office in Japan to Los Angeles, California to serve as a priest at the Zenshuji Soto Zen Mission. In 1965 he was sent to the Sokoji Soto Zen Mission in San Francisco, California to assist Shunryu Suzuki and later helped out the San Francisco Zen Center (SFZC), which had shared the same building as Sokoji until 1969; Katagiri was of great help to Shunryu Suzuki, especially from 1969 onward. During his years in San Francisco, Katagiri sometimes toyed with the idea of opening up his own Zen community nearby. So, not long before Suzuki&#x27;s death, he did open a zendo in his home in Monterey, California.

===United States===
In 1972 Katagiri relocated to Minneapolis, MN. There he became abbot of a small group without a leader, which became known as the Minnesota Zen Meditation Center (&quot;Ganshoji&quot;). There he also founded Hokyoji Zen Practice Community (Catching the Moon Zen Mountain Center), a country retreat temple in southeast Minnesota. A factor in deciding to go to Minnesota had been the fact that few, if any, Buddhist teachers were located there. Katagiri understood that the majority of teachers at this time were either in New York or California, with much of the country in-between in need of teachers. During the 1970s and 1980s Katagiri sent over many of his Western students to train at Zuio-ji in Japan, where Narasaki Ikko roshi was abbot. In 1984, in the wake of the Zentatsu Richard Baker controversy resulting in Baker&#x27;s resignation as abbot of San Francisco Zen Center, Katagiri came at the request of SFZC and served as abbot there on an interim basis until 1985 (returning to Minnesota afterward). He remained there for the remainder of his life, succumbing finally to cancer on March 1, 1990; he left behind thirteen Dharma heirs.

===Personal life===
Katagiri was married to Tomoe Katagiri in 1960, and they had two sons together (Yasuhiko and Ejyo). During his marriage, &quot;he had engaged in sexual relationships with at least two women who were his students, and made unwelcome advances to some others.&quot;

==Acclaim==
Soto priest and former student of Katagiri-Roshi, Zuiko Redding, has stated, &quot;My basic memory of Katagiri is of how he paid total attention to what was in front of him. He took care of each thing as if it were the most important thing in the world, whether it was throwing away some trash or talking to another person. He really listened and tried to give the best answer he knew how to give. He also encouraged each of us to stand up in our own space, following our own wisdom rather than depending on him for answers or affirmation. I would sometimes tell him exactly what I thought about some idea he had, only to turn and see him smiling broadly at me, glad that I wasn’t buying into his agenda.&quot;

<doc id="1333921" wikidata="Q1980296" url="?curid=1333921" title="Joseph Kobzon">
<text>Joseph Davydovich Kobzon (11 September 1937 – 30 August 2018) was a Soviet-born Russian singer, known for his crooner style.

==Early life==
Kobzon was born to Jewish Ukrainian parents in the mining town of Chasiv Yar, in the Donbas region of Ukraine.

As a boy he demonstrated a talent for singing, winning numerous regional singing contests. He reached the national finals on two separate occasions, appearing in concerts dedicated to Joseph Stalin – a significant honour at the time.

Despite his talent for singing, Kobzon went on to technical school to study geology and mining in Dnipropetrovsk, as this was considered a lucrative vocation in the Soviet Union following the Second World War. However, in 1959, following his 1956–1959 contact with professional music instructors in the Soviet Army where he was a member of the armies song and dance ensemble, he decided that music would be his preferred vocation.

==Stage career==
In 1958, Kobzon officially started his singing career in Moscow, and enrolled to study at the Gnessin Institute. In the next few years he made valuable contacts in Moscow&#x27;s entertainment world, and was eventually given a chance by composer Arkady Ostrovsky to perform some of his music. Initially, he performed in a duet with the tenor Viktor Kokhno, but was eventually offered a solo repertoire by many of the outstanding composers of the time such as Mark Fradkin, and Yan Frenkel.

In 1962, he recorded his first LP which included songs written by Aleksandra Pakhmutova.

In 1964, he triumphed at the International Song Contest in Sopot, Poland, and in the following year he took part in the &quot;Friendship&quot; contest held across six nations, winning first prize in Warsaw, Berlin and Budapest.

His popularity rose quickly, and demand for his singing saw him frequently performing two to three concerts a day. His most popular hit song at the time was titled &quot;A u nas vo dvore&quot;.

During Leonid Brezhnev&#x27;s time in office (1964–1982), there was hardly an official concert where Kobzon did not take part, and in 1980 he was awarded the honour of People&#x27;s Artist of the USSR.

His best-known song is &quot;Instants&quot; from the legendary Soviet TV series &quot;Seventeen Moments of Spring&quot; (1973). Kobzon sang many songs for the &quot;Seventeen Moments of Spring&quot;, but, because of his Jewish nationality, he was not listed on the credits.

In 1983, Kobzon was expelled from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and reprimanded for &quot;political short sightedness,&quot; after he performed Jewish songs during an international friendship concert, which resulted in the Arab delegations leaving in protest. However, the following year (1984), his reputation was restored, as he was honored with the USSR State Prize.

Joseph Kobzon has performed in solo concerts in most cities of the former USSR. He was also bestowed the rare honour of performing international concerts tours as a representative of USSR in United States, Panama, Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, Uruguay, Costa Rica, Argentina, Israel, Republic of the Congo, Zaire, Angola, Nigeria, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, (Germany), Greece, and Finland. Throughout his career, he has shared the stage with many Western superstars, including the likes of Liza Minnelli and Julio Iglesias.

Since May 1995, Kobzon and his entire family was banned from entering the United States due to his allegedly close associations with drug trafficking, illicit arms trading, and Russian mafia in Moscow especially Viktor Nikiforov (Kalina) (), Otari Kvantrishvili (Otarik, Krivonos), Alexander Zakharov (Zakhar), Alimzhan Tokhtakhunov (Taiwanchik) and Vyacheslav Ivankov (Yaponchik).

Although he officially ended his international touring career in 1997, he continued to appear in regular concerts before audiences around the world and was frequently seen on Russian television.

==Public life==
On many occasions, Kobzon performed in disaster areas and military hot-spots such as Afghanistan during the Soviet-Afghan War, and Chechnya during the Chechen War.

In 1986, Kobzon was the first celebrity to visit and perform in the town of Chernobyl to cheer the nuclear reactor rescuers. Two years later, Kobzon was the first celebrity to visit and perform for victims of the 1988 Armenian earthquake.

Kobzon has been active in Russian politics since 1989. He was an experienced Russian MP and enjoyed landslide election victories.

His first major political achievement (1989–1991) transpired when his promotion of Jewish culture in the USSR aided the establishment of diplomatic ties between USSR and Israel.

For many years, Kobzon has presided over numerous charitable organisations. Beginning in 1989, he was the Chairman of The Movement for Honour and Dignity of Russian Citizens. He was also the president of the Humanitarian Initiatives Fund, and the president of a charitable fund known as ‘Shield and Lira&quot; which is devoted to helping families of those killed and injured in action while on law enforcement duties.

He was Chairman of the Public Council of Moscow&#x27;s Police Department, and leader of his political party &quot;The Russian Party for Peace&quot;.

From the early 1990s, Kobzon had personally funded numerous orphanages around the country.

In 2002, he risked his life as key negotiator in the Moscow theater hostage crisis. His involvement resulted in the release of a mother with three children and a British citizen.

Kobzon&#x27;s innumerable contributions to culture, music, humanitarian and political life across the Commonwealth of Independent States saw a monument depicting Kobzon erected near his birthplace, in Donetsk, Ukraine in 2003.

Between 2005 and 2007, he was the head of the State Duma&#x27;s culture committee.

In 2007, his name was entered into the Guinness Book of Records (Russian Edition) as the most decorated artist in the country&#x27;s history.

In 2009, Kobzon became the 24th individual to be named Honorary Citizen of Moscow.

He had suffered from prostate cancer since 2005. He died on 30 August 2018.

==&quot;Russia&#x27;s Frank Sinatra&quot;==
Considering Kobzon&#x27;s career, personality, spirit and singing style, many say that he was Russia&#x27;s answer to the U.S. crooner Frank Sinatra. Besides their singing careers, both Sinatra and Kobzon used their popularity towards an active involvement in politics. The parallels between the two became the focus of media articles, books and novels claiming to have detailed knowledge of Russia&#x27;s gangster world based on inside information obtained from the CIA. As a result, Kobzon was barred entry to the United States from 1995 when his visa was revoked on allegations of mafia ties. In response, Kobzon successfully sued numerous publications for propagating unsubstantiated rumours, asserting his impeccable reputation and great honour among millions of Russian-speakers worldwide.

==Stance on Ukraine==
In March 2014, Kobzon was among 500 Russian artists who signed an open letter in support of Russia&#x27;s annexation of Crimea. As a result, in July 2014, Kobzon was included in a selected group of Russian artists banned from entering Latvia.

Following the Revolution of Dignity, pro-Russian unrest broke out in Ukraine. In late October 2014, Kobzon visited Donbas on a humanitarian mission, providing medications to hospitals in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions and giving a free concert in support of the people of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People&#x27;s Republic. As a result of the visit, Alexander Zakharchenko (then Prime Minister of the Donetsk People&#x27;s Republic) bestowed on Kobzon the title of Russia&#x27;s &quot;honorary consul&quot; to DPR. However, the title had questionable meaning as there are no reports of Russia formally sending Kobzon as an honorary consul to DPR nor ratifying this appointment.

On 3 September 2014 deputies of the Dnipropetrovsk City Council deprived Kobzon of the title of &quot;Honorary citizen of Dnipropetrovsk&quot;, on 25 November 2014 Poltava City Council removed his title of &quot;Honorary citizen of Poltava&quot;, and on 28 January 2015 Kramatorsk City Council removed his title of &quot;Honorary citizen of Kramatorsk.&quot; In autumn 2014, Ukraine&#x27;s national security service banned him from entering the country. Kobzon responded by saying that &quot;he shouldn&#x27;t need a visa to visit his own homeland and birthplace.&quot; He stated that he welcomed any decision by Ukraine&#x27;s authorities to strip him of honours, as he didn&#x27;t want to be &quot;an honorary citizen of a country that is run by a fascist regime.&quot; He requested that Ukraine also strip him of his People&#x27;s Artist of Ukraine award. In February 2015, Kobzon was awarded Honorary Citizenship of Yenakiieve in Donetsk Oblast (controlled by the Donetsk People&#x27;s Republic), and was later awarded the honour of &#x27;People&#x27;s Artist&#x27; by self-proclaimed Luhansk People&#x27;s Republic.

In February 2015, the European Union added Kobzon to its list of individuals sanctioned with asset freezes and travel bans because he had &quot;visited the so-called Donetsk People&#x27;s Republic and during his visit made statements supporting separatists&quot;; Kobzon responded that he was &quot;very pleased and grateful.&quot; Canada also applied economic sanctions and a travel ban. He was &quot;proud to be included in a list of people who are not indifferent to the fate of internally displaced Russian-speakers in Donbas and the fate of Russia&quot;. Russian MPs spoke out in response to the EU sanctions, while Kobzon&#x27;s fans launched a Twitter campaign in his support. Russia&#x27;s Foreign Ministry said that the new sanctions defy common sense, referring to the fact that Kobzon was on a humanitarian mission to help innocent people caught in a war zone and that the sanctions were imposed just one day after the Minsk II agreement came into force. The agreement was reached between EU representatives (Germany and France), Ukraine and Russia, and was aimed at resolving the war in Donbas. Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov condemned Kobzon&#x27;s inclusion on the sanctions list as &quot;vile&quot; and &quot;cynical&quot;, questioning the purpose of sanctioning &quot;a highly respected national artist&quot; whose mission in Donbas was &quot;fundamentally humanitarian.&quot; A ruling party MP, Vyacheslav Nikonov, spoke in parliament to support Kobzon, stating &quot;We are with you. If they&#x27;re all Charlie, then we are all Kobzon&quot;, playing on the &quot;Je Suis Charlie&quot; slogan used in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo shooting. In response to calls for retaliatory sanctions, Russia&#x27;s culture minister Vladimir Medinsky said that Moscow could not impose equal sanctions on the EU, because &quot;Europe simply lacks a star of the same standing as Kobzon.&quot; Kobzon returned to Donbas one week following the EU&#x27;s decision. This was his second humanitarian mission to the region delivering medications to hospitals in Luhansk, and giving another free concert &quot;to support local residents&quot;.

==&quot;Going to a Kobzon concert&quot;==
The &quot;Kobzon Concert&quot; meme arose after the assassination of Alexander Zakharchenko, the former leader of the self-proclaimed DPR, which took place on August 31, 2018. At that time, jokes were spread in Ukrainian social networks that Zakharchenko went to the &quot;Kobzon concert&quot;, who died the day before - on August 30.

After the 24 February 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the phrase in Ukrainian &quot;sent to a Kobzon concert&quot; () grew in popularity to denote that a pro Russia combatant who was &quot;going to a Kobzon concert&quot; had met a quick death.

==Personal life==
Kobzon was married three times. In 1965, he married the singer, ; then in 1969 Kobzon married Lyudmila Gurchenko, one of the best known comic actresses of the Soviet cinema. In 1971, he married Ninel Drizina with whom he had two children.

<text>The AK-103 is an assault rifle designed by Russian small arms designer Mikhail Kalashnikov.

== History ==
The AK-103 was officially offered for export on March 13, 1993.

==Design details==

It is an AK-100 derivative of the AK-74M that is chambered for the 7.62x39mm M43 cartridge, similar to the AKM. The AK-103 can be fitted with a variety of sights, including night vision and telescopic sights, plus a knife-bayonet or a grenade launcher like the GP-34. Newer versions can fit Picatinny rails, allowing more accessories to be mounted. It uses plastic components where possible instead of wood or metal, with such components being the pistol grip, handguards, folding stock and depending on the type, the magazine.

Protective coatings for corrosion resistance of metal parts. Forearm, magazine, butt stock and pistol grip are made of high strength shatterproof plastic.

The AK-104 is a compact version of the AK-103 chambered for 7.62×39mm ammunition. It has a muzzle brake derived from the older AKS-74U combined with a shorter barrel.

==Magazines==

The current issue steel-reinforced matte true black nonreflective surface finished 7.62×39mm 30-round magazines, fabricated from ABS plastic weigh empty. Early steel AK-47 magazines are long, and the later ribbed steel AKM and newer plastic 7.62×39mm magazines are about shorter.

The transition from steel to mainly plastic magazines yielded a significant weight reduction and allow a soldier to carry more rounds for the same weight.

<doc id="1333935" wikidata="Q3082479" url="?curid=1333935" title="Xenia Onatopp">
<text>Xenia Zaragevna Onatopp () is a fictional character and Bond girl in the James Bond film &quot;GoldenEye&quot;, played by actress Famke Janssen. She is a fighter pilot and assassin who crushes her enemies with her thighs to get sexual satisfaction, working for the renegade MI6 agent Alec Trevelyan (Sean Bean).

Onatopp has appeared in a number of James Bond video games as a playable multiplayer character.

==In the film==
Onatopp, born in the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic, is a former officer and fighter pilot in the Soviet Air Force. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, she joins the crime syndicate Janus, led by traitorous MI6 agent Alec Trevelyan. Early in the movie, Bond (Pierce Brosnan) gets into a car chase with her, meets her at a casino, and places her under surveillance.

She lures a Canadian admiral, Chuck Farrell (Billy J. Mitchell), onto a yacht moored off Monte Carlo and kills him during sex (honey trapping) by crushing his ribs with her thighs, achieving orgasm in the process. Meanwhile, Trevelyan&#x27;s henchman General Arkady Grigorovich Ourumov (Gottfried John) steals the dead admiral&#x27;s NATO ID, granting him and Onatopp access to a prototype EMP-hardened Eurocopter Tiger aboard a French warship anchored off Monte Carlo.

Onatopp then hijacks the helicopter by killing the two pilots. Later, she and Ourumov use the hijacked Tiger in an attack on the Severnaya satellite control center in central Siberia, where they steal the controller for the GoldenEye satellite weapon. During the attack, she kills all the military personnel and civilian technicians present and is visibly aroused by the killing. She then appears as Bond&#x27;s link to the Janus group. In a meeting arranged by Bond&#x27;s dealings with Valentin Zukovsky (Robbie Coltrane), a Russian arms dealer and former KGB agent, Onatopp arrives to meet Bond as he swims in a Turkish Bath. The two indulge in aggressive foreplay where Onatopp attempts to crush Bond between her thighs, he finally draws his Walther PPK on her and demands to be taken to Janus.

In her final encounter with Bond in Cuba, she ambushes him and Severnaya programmer Natalya Simonova (Izabella Scorupco) by rappeling from a helicopter and again attempts to crush him between her legs. Bond uses her assault rifle to damage the helicopter, entangling her rope, which pulls her off him, crushing her to death against a tree trunk.

==In video games==
Her first appearance in a video game was in the 1997 video game adaptation of &quot;GoldenEye&quot;, &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; for the Nintendo 64. She is with Trevelyan on the train stage of the game. If the player quickly shoots her after eliminating Ourumov, she will yell to Trevelyan that she is wounded and to wait up for her; this buys the player more time to escape from the train. She later reappears in the jungle stage. Similar to the film, she is killed in the jungles of Cuba in a firefight with Bond. Killing Onatopp is the only way for the player to dual-wield two different guns in the game without a complex series of button presses; she uses an RC-P90 and a grenade launcher at the same time.

In the James Bond game &quot;Nightfire&quot;, Onatopp also appears as a multiplayer character. She can be unlocked by a cheat on the cheats menu as Janus, the organization she works for in the movie.

She appeared in the spinoff Bond game &quot;&quot; where she works for Dr. Julius No and is Agent GoldenEye&#x27;s alluring opponent. She is commander of No&#x27;s army, which has taken over the Hoover Dam. She is killed after being thrown off of the Hoover Dam while fighting Goldeneye. In the game, her likeness was based on Famke Janssen but was voiced by actress Jenya Lano.

She appears in the &quot;GoldenEye&quot; remake as a former Russian general who served under Ouromov during the Russian invasion of Georgia. Her plot arc is significantly changed for the remake. She appears in the Nightclub level (where Bond first meets her) disguised as a waitress, and assassinates Valentin Zukovsky after he gives vital information about Janus to Bond - the man is framed for the murder of Zukovsky. She betrays and assassinates Ouromov in the train level in which she appears. During her final confrontation with Bond, she is lowered down to him from a helicopter and proceeds to engage in hand-to-hand combat with him. She is defeated when Bond launches a missile at her helicopter while she is strangling him, the helicopter crashing into a nearby gorge and dragging her down with it. She is voiced by and modeled after Kate Magowan.

==Analysis==
Anna Katherine Amacker and Donna Ashley Moore suggest that Onatopp is a &quot;direct throwback to the earlier style of Bond girl, complete with an innuendo-laden name and a blatant sexuality.&quot; Robert A. Saunders suggests that she &quot;personifies the hypersexualized archetype of the post-Soviet Russian woman.&quot;

Helena Bassil-Morosow suggests that Onatopp is &quot;visually coded as a stereotypical dominatrix: dark hair, bright red lipstick, smoky eyeshadow and sharply defined eyebrows,&quot; while Monica Germanà suggests that &quot;Xenia&#x27;s glamour encapsulates the sadistic quality of her excessive appetite&quot;.

Bassil-Morosow goes on to note that Onatopp &quot;also sees violence as a broadly defined sexual act in which she gets to dominate and ultimately decide people&#x27;s fates,&quot; and argues that she &quot;poses a threat to Bond&#x27;s status as a dominant male as she consistently outdoes him in all his favourite activities: driving, killing, risk-taking and having sex with multiple partners.&quot; In this way, she &quot;has to be eventually killed by him because not only is she ruthless and unstoppable but also metaphorically as a punishment for refusing to admire him.&quot; Bassil-Morosow concludes that &quot;Onatopp&#x27;s character, masculinised, independent, domineering and sexually liberated, can be read as a bitter parody of feminism.&quot;

==Reception==
Xenia Onatopp has appeared in several lists of the top 10 Bond girls, including by &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;. Yahoo! Movies had her name included in the list of the best Bond girl names, even while calling it a &quot;slightly-too-obvious pun.&quot; In 2015, &quot;The Telegraph&quot; suggested that &quot;in the stolid Brosnan years, former Soviet fighter pilot Onatopp was a breath of fresh air.&quot; Paul Simpson argues that with Onatopp, the femme fatale made a &quot;welcome reappearance&quot; after the role had previously fallen out of fashion.

<text>South Norwood is a district of South London, England, within the London Borough of Croydon, Greater London and formerly in the historic county of Surrey. It is located 7.8 miles (12.5 km) south-east of Charing Cross, north of Woodside and Addiscombe, east of Selhurst and Thornton Heath, south of Crystal Palace/Upper Norwood and Anerley, and south-west of Penge.

Together with Norwood New Town, it forms the electoral ward of South Norwood in the local authority of Croydon. The ward as a whole had a resident population in 2001 of just over 14,000.

The south-eastern side of the district is dominated by the country park which opened in 1989. At the northern end of the town is South Norwood Lake, which was created after the reservoir for the unsuccessful Croydon Canal went out of use. It is used by the Croydon Sailing Club and local anglers who fish for carp, bream and perch.

There are two secondary schools in the area along with a public leisure centre. South Norwood has a high street which forms part of Selhurst Road. It is a commuter district, with many residents travelling to either the financial and insurance districts of Croydon or the City of London for employment via Norwood Junction railway station. South Norwood and surrounding areas are covered by the London SE25 postcode. It is also the southernmost location of the London post town.

==History==
The area was originally covered by the Great North Wood, which was a natural oak forest that covered four miles (6 km) of south London. Apart from South Norwood, the wood covered Upper Norwood, West Norwood (known as Lower Norwood until 1885) and the Woodside and Gipsy Hill areas.

References to rents being paid for a coppice called Cholmerden in the area date to the 1400s. By the 1670s the site had been developed into the grounds of Goat House. Handley&#x27;s Brickworks&#x27; seven chimneys once dominated the landscape of the area. It has been demolished and the site changed into grassland and a lake, called Brickfields Meadow.

The Croydon Canal was constructed in the early 19th century, running from New Cross to the site of West Croydon station. As it passed through South Norwood, pubs sprang up near its course. The Jolly Sailor still stands at the intersection of South Norwood Hill and High Street. The Ship, a few yards to the east, was beside the loading point for bricks from a nearby brick field across what is now the High Street. The passageway through which bricks passed to the canal is still there. The Goat House pub (which has since been demolished) was said to have been named after an island in the canal on which goats were kept.

Jolly-sailor station opened in 1839 by the London and Croydon Railway. It was listed as &quot;Jolly-sailor near Beulah Spa&quot; on fare lists and timetables and renamed &#x27;Norwood&#x27; in 1846. The station was immediately adjacent to a level crossing over Portland Road, making it slightly further north than the site currently occupied by Norwood Junction station. As part of the construction works for the atmospheric-propulsion system, the world&#x27;s first railway flyover was constructed south of Tennison Road, to carry the new atmospheric-propulsion line over the conventional steam line below. In 1847, the atmospheric propulsion experiment was abandoned.

In 1848 South Norwood remained a small hamlet, however the following 10–20 years rapid development occurred with the construction of roads and the Selhurst Park estate. The area gained its own parish church, Holy Innocents, in 1895. Much of the growth of the area was the result of William Ford Stanley, who constructed a precision instrument factory in the area in 1867 and established a technical school here in 1902 (now the Stanley Halls).

Further development occurred throughout the 20th century with the building of terraced houses and public housing developments. Large numbers of immigrants from the Caribbean settled here and the area retains a large black population.

In 1966, a dog called Pickles discovered, under a bush in Beulah Hill, the FIFA World Cup Jules Rimet Trophy, which had been stolen from an exhibition of rare stamps at Westminster Central Hall.

The area is centred on the junction where the High Street meets South Norwood Hill/Portland Road; the bulk of the shops and amenities are located along the High Street and Selhurst Road/Penge Road, with further shops, restaurants etc. lining Portland Road for some distance. South Norwood is now unofficially divided into the less deprived area in the north west side of the railway, which was the location of a private estate, and the generally more deprived area in the north east. In the south east of the borough, where workers for a former brick factory lived, the entrance to the estate was between a pair of pillars, though they have long since been demolished. However the capitals were preserved and now sit on the two brick pillars at the Selhurst Road entrance to South Norwood Recreation Ground. In 2006, South Norwood Lakes in the north of the ward was the scene of a fatal stabbing.

==Governance==
South Norwood was within the County Borough of Croydon until 1965 when, following the enactment of the London Government Act 1963, it became part the local government of Greater London. The town is now part of the wards of South Norwood and Woodside in the local authority of Croydon, which has the responsibility for providing services such as education, refuse collection, and tourism.

South Norwood Ward is part of the ethnically diverse Croydon North parliamentary constituency, which had one of the largest electorates in England at the 2010 general election, whereas Woodside Ward falls within the boundaries of the Croydon Central constituency. The sitting Member of Parliament (MP) for Croydon North is Steve Reed, a member of the Labour Party, following the death of Malcolm Wicks. The sitting Member of Parliament for Croydon Central is Sarah Jones, also a member of the Labour Party.

Policing services are provided by the Metropolitan Police via the Croydon Police Station branch in Park Lane, Croydon. The London Fire Brigade provide services for the area and Greater London as a whole; the nearest fire station is at Woodside which has only one pumping appliance.

==Geography==
South Norwood is bordered by Anerley to the north, Selhurst to the south, Woodside due east and Thornton Heath to the west. The northernmost point of South Norwood is at Beaulieu Heights (alternatively spelt Beulah Heights, Beaulah Heights and Beulieu Heights) which contains Beulah Heights Park, overlapping with Upper Norwood and New Town. The northern part of the district is situated on the lower parts of the hill that forms Upper Norwood.

South Norwood lies on the southern slopes of the Norwood Ridge which forms the southern edge of the London Basin. This line of hills runs from north-east to south-west for about three miles (5 km) and rises to approximately above sea level at its highest point. It is formed by a ridge of grey silty deposits known as London Clay, capped in places with the gravel of the Claygate Beds. Because of this gravel working was an important local industry and at one time the road along Beulah Hill was called Gravel Pit Road. South Norwood Hill is the most southerly spur of this ridge and the London Clay extends at its foot to the southern edge of the South Norwood Country Park. Here a brook marks the junction with the sands and gravels of the Blackheath Beds that rise to Shirley, Addington Hills and Croham Hurst. Streams join Chaffinch Brook and the Beck to form the River Pool, which eventually flows into the River Ravensbourne.

==Education==

=== Primary Schools ===
There are many primary schools in the South Norwood area including Priory Special School, Heavers Farm Primary School, South Norwood Primary School, Cypress Junior School and Cypress Infant School, St. Chad&#x27;s Roman Catholic Primary School, St. Mark&#x27;s Primary School and Oasis Academy Ryelands.

=== Secondary Schools ===
The former Stanley Technical High School (the legacy of local inventor and engineer William Stanley) has been replaced and turned into an academy as part of the Harris Federation. After deliberations with local residents it was originally going to be called Harris at Stanley, but the federation changed it to Harris Academy South Norwood, an act which created some controversy. Many local residents are upset that the name Stanley was removed from the school, as Stanley, who had the original school built in 1907, is a famous and well regarded figure in South Norwood. Harris City Academy Crystal Palace is a city academy in the north west of South Norwood, but to avoid confusion with the other school it uses the Crystal Palace name. Other secondary schools in the area include Oasis Academy Arena.

=== Higher Education ===

South Norwood is home of Spurgeon&#x27;s College, a world-famous Baptist theological college, since 1923; Spurgeon&#x27;s is located on South Norwood Hill and currently has some 1,000 students. It is one of only four further education establishments in the borough.

=== South Norwood Library ===

South Norwood Library, nicknamed &#x27;The Brutalist Library&#x27; is located on the corner of Selhurst Road and Lawrence Road. A public library part of the Croydon Libraries library system, the building was constructed in 1968 by Croydon borough architect Hugh Lea and is arranged over five levels split across the front and rear of the building in order to maximise the internal space. The front part of the building has the ground floor entrance level, which houses the reception, and the second floor which houses the children&#x27;s library. The rear of the building has the basement, first and third floors. The levels are offset so that the floors in the front and rear of the building appear like mezzanine levels to each other.

==Sports and leisure==
=== Leisure Centre ===
South Norwood contains a leisure centre which is owned and maintained by Better on behalf of Sport Croydon. South Norwood Leisure Centre is situated on Portland Road and reopened in late 2007 after refurbishment. It had been closed in early 2006 and was due for demolition, so that it could be redesigned from scratch like the leisure centre in Thornton Heath, at a cost of around £10 million. In May 2006 the Conservatives gained control of Croydon and decided that doing this would cost too much money, so they decided to refurbish the centre instead, although this decision came with controversy. It now includes a 25m swimming pool and a gym.

=== South Norwood Country Park ===

South Norwood is also home to South Norwood Country Park, 116 acres of nature reserve. After previously being home to a sewage works (closed in 1966) and fireworks factory; the habitat has been cultivated over time to nurture an abundance of species and wildlife. Other parks in the local area are South Norwood Recreation Ground, Heavers Meadow, Brickfields Meadow, Beaulieu Heights, South Norwood Lake and Grounds, Woodside Green and Ashburton Park.

=== South Norwood Community Festival ===
The South Norwood Community Festival is an annual event at South Norwood Recreational Ground which first began in 2011 as an inclusive event which would benefit the local community. In 2022 over 8,000 people gathered to enjoy live bands, refreshments, arts and crafts and children&#x27;s entertainment. The event is run entirely by volunteers and profits are donated to local charities and invested back into the future festival plans. The last festival took place on Sunday, 2 July 2023.

=== Croydon Sports Arena ===
Croydon Sports Arena was first opened in 1953 and is a multiple-use sports arena in South Norwood. The arena is located on the edge of South Norwood Country Park. Facilities include an eight-lane 400m running track, with a centre field and training area for throwing events. The stadium is floodlit. During the winter the inner field becomes a football pitch, home to Croydon F.C. In the summer the stadium is mostly used for athletic events. It is used by athletics clubs Striders of Croydon and Croydon Harriers. The stands in the sports arena can hold up to 388 people. From 2018, the arena is being managed by Greenwich Leisure Limited.

=== Football ===
South Norwood F.C. were an amateur football club who were active in the 1870s and played their home matches at Portland Road.

Premier League club Crystal Palace are based in the nearby Selhurst Park and on match days the pubs on the high street are usually busy with fans and ticket-holders.

==South Norwood Tourist Board==
South Norwood Tourist Board an anarchist collective have organised &quot;PicklesFest&quot; with Dave Corbett, owner of Pickles; challenging the Lake District for their title; and more recently proclaimed the People&#x27;s Republic of South Norwood and renamed the lake in South Norwood Country Park as Lake Conan after Conan Doyle who lived in South Norwood.

In 2013 South Norwood Tourist Board, in partnership with Crystal Palace Transition Town and the local community created a garden out of some wasteland on A213 near Harris Academy South Norwood. The area is known as Sensible Garden, named after Captain Sensible who attended Stanley Boys School, on the site that is now the Harris Academy. On 26 July 2014, Captain Sensible unveiled &#x27;The Sensible Seat&#x27;.

== Culture, music and arts ==
=== Stanley Arts ===

Named after the local inventor and engineer who founded and designed the buildings William Stanley, Stanley Arts is one of the larger arts and performance venues in the surrounding area, with a focus on community arts. The organisation&#x27;s vision focuses on under-represented voices, providing artists of colour and LGBTQ+ creatives with a platform in South London and beyond. The venue is home to a 250-seat and 60-seat theatre space, resident office space for theatre makers, productions from local theatre clubs, a coffee shop, and other community focused activities. Since first opening in 1903, both professional and amateur performers trod its boards; including Samuel Coleridge-Taylor and W.Y. Hurlstone. In the 1960s Shirley Bassey, Matt Munro and Johnny Dankworth were among the professional musicians who rehearsed here for performances at nearby Fairfield Halls in Croydon.

==== History of Stanley Arts ====
Originally named &#x27;Stanley Halls&#x27; the venue is a grade II listed building first built in 1903. On its completion, William Stanley invited all the workmen to a supper at the Halls followed by an entertainment to which the wives and relatives of the men were invited. Stanley said that if &quot;the building was not the most beautiful in the world, it was, at least, one of the most substantially built.&quot; He hoped that the Halls would become a pleasant home of entertainment for all of them.

The buildings were completed in stages, with Stanley Public Hall (the main hall and art gallery) opening in 1903, the clock tower and Upper Stanley Hall added in 1904 and the Technical Trade School in 1907. The Assembly room and Society Rooms, alongside offices and the venue secretary’s accommodation, were added in 1909 to complete the complex. An inventor rather than a trained architect, Stanley wasn’t interested in following any one architectural style in his designs for the building, resulting in a unique and idiosyncratic combination of styles and materials described by the architecture historian Nikolaus Pevsner as ‘one of the most eccentric efforts anywhere at a do-it-yourself freestyle.’

Standing next to Stanley’s new technical trade school, which was inspired by the German &quot;Gewerbeschulen&quot; trade schools and was the first of its kind in Britain, it made perfect sense that the Stanley Halls complex should be used for purposes both educational and cultural. Initially the Halls hosted a wide array of educational classes, exhibitions and political debates. On 2 March 1912, for example, it was reported that &quot;a spirited debate on Votes for Women&quot; took place at Stanley Upper Hall where Alice Abadam (president of the National Women’s Suffrage Society and resident of Upper Norwood) spoke in favour of women’s right to vote. Other speakers in later years, who have followed in Alice Abadam’s footsteps on the stage of Stanley Hall, include Harold Wilson and John Smith.

==== Stanley Arts - community and social events ====
During the War Years, first aid courses are thought to have taken place here and the building may have been used as temporary shelter for residents bombed out of their homes. It was also a centre for community celebrations and festivals such as the 1951 Festival of Britain and the coronation of Elizabeth II in 1953. Records from the 1950s show that social events in the Halls ranged from birthday celebrations, antique fairs, ‘Meet a Mum’ jumble sales, weddings, aerobics, to a Psychic Festival. The fact that the Halls offered a multi-purpose community venue played a significant role in the promotion of local citizenship and civic pride in the post-war period.

==== Stanley Arts from 1970s onwards ====
As the decades progressed, without a separate cultural identity and no physical separation, the upper and main halls, the gallery and the assembly rooms,  all increasingly became part of the expanding Technical school; known locally simply as Stanley Tech. Though the buildings were used to some extent outside of school hours, the record of separate cultural activity in this period is limited, and to all intents and purposes Stanley Halls and Stanley Tech were the same place. By the turn of the 21st century, the Technical School, which had by then seen better days, was being absorbed into the Harris Academy chain; and a new school complex was being built on an L-shaped site around the back of Stanley Halls. In 2007 the newly-opened Harris Academy South Norwood comprised the old Technical School building, the Upper Stanley Hall &amp; Clocktower, and a modern new-build school site stretching around behind Stanley Halls. The rest of the historic Stanley Halls complex, including the main Stanley Hall and gallery, and the assembly &amp; society rooms, were separated from the Upper Hall with a new internal wall that divided the Stanley Halls complex in two.

Over the next five years the future of the larger, lower half, the ‘unneeded’ part of the Stanley Halls complex as it was seen by the developers of the new school academy, was in question. With these remaining buildings under threat, and competing visions for their future, the local community came together to apply to take them on from Croydon Council as a community asset transfer. 

In 2015 the buildings were finally signed over to the newly-formed Stanley People’s Initiative, a charity established to save this part the historic Stanley Halls complex, and hopefully to find a new use for this extraordinary set of buildings. Over the first few years of operation this new, reduced, Stanley Halls slowly found its feet; and with it, a renewed sense of purpose. Paradoxically, the pandemic of 2020 helped to re-establish the buildings in the hearts and minds of local people as an essential home for art, performance and community.

This new purpose represents a return to the original intention of William Stanley. In 1901 he had conceived the idea of building a local home for entertainment, art and culture, and nearly 120 years later his vision was to be renewed. The start of 2021 saw the trustees launch a new identity for this part of the historic Stanley Halls complex, rebranding as Stanley Arts – a name that honours the past, whilst looking forward to a brighter future. Stanley Arts seeks to forge a new identity for this part of Stanley Halls, separate from its most recent history as part of Stanley Tech, and one that clearly defines the future of this building as a South London home for community, arts, and culture for the next 120 years at least.

==Transport==

===Roads===
Two A roads, the A215 and the A213 are in the South Norwood area. The A213 is High Street, Penge Road and Selhurst Road. The A215 is Portland Road and South Norwood Hill.

===Rail===
Norwood Junction railway station is situated in the centre of South Norwood just off High Street. It has 7 platforms but only 6 are in use at the present time. Southern and London Overground trains run to London Bridge and Dalston Junction. Fast trains generally take 10 minutes to reach central London and slow trains 20 minutes. Also London Victoria station trains take 20 minutes. East Croydon and West Croydon stations and urban and rural stations thereafter including regular train service to Clapham Junction, Wandsworth Common, Balham and Streaham. Selhurst station is nearby, from which one can catch direct trains to Kensington Olympia and Shepherd&#x27;s Bush via a train service to Milton Keynes.

The Thameslink Programme (formerly known as Thameslink 2000), is a £3.5 billion major project to expand the Thameslink network from 51 to 172 stations spreading northwards to Bedford, Peterborough, Cambridge and King&#x27;s Lynn and southwards to Guildford, Eastbourne, Horsham, Hove to Littlehampton, East Grinstead, Ashford and Dartford. The project includes the lengthening of platforms, station remodelling, new railway infrastructure (e.g. viaduct) and additional rolling stock. The new Thameslink timetable for Norwood Junction started 20 May 2018: &quot;Norwood Junction gain[ed] an all-day-long Thameslink service to Bedford via Blackfriars and St Pancras, with two trains per hour to Epsom via Sutton&quot; and timetables will continue being expanded and adjusted into 2019.

Transport for London began work on the southern extension of the East London line in 2005 as part of the London Overground. On completion in May 2010, services run between West Croydon and Dalston Junction via London Docklands.

Trains make an unpublicised stop at Selhurst from Victoria through the night to enable engineers at Selhurst to get to Gatwick and vice versa. This means that it is possible to board the train during the night all through the early hours of morning to South Norwood. However, the trains state East Croydon on the board. Trains run out of Victoria after 1.00 am on the hour until the train service starts up again officially.

===Trams===
Trams do not run through the town centre of South Norwood, with the nearest stops on the Tramlink network being Harrington Road, Arena and Woodside. In the mid-2000s there were proposals for an extension to Crystal Palace, which would have resulted in the construction of an additional stop on Penge Road.

==Notable people==

* Samuel Coleridge-Taylor (15 August 1875 – 1 September 1912) was an English composer and conductor. Of mixed race birth (&quot;his father was a doctor from Sierra Leone)&quot;, Coleridge-Taylor achieved such success that he was referred to by white New York musicians as the &quot;African Mahler&quot; when he had three tours of the United States in the early 1900s. There are two blue plaques in his memory, one in Dagnall Park, South Norwood, and the other in St Leonards Road, Croydon, at the house where he died.
* Hannah Arterton - actress, lives in South Norwood.
* Lionel Atwill (1885–1946) - actor, was born, and spent the early part of his childhood, at 2 Upton Villas, Albert Road.
* Alex Beckett (1982–2018) - actor, lived and died in South Norwood.
* Mary Bell - child murderer. The murders of two young boys was committed in Newcastle when she was 10 and 11. For a time, Bell lived in a girls&#x27; remand home at Cumberlow Lodge in South Norwood, off of Chalfont Road behind Stanley Halls.
* Captain Sensible - musician, attended school here.
* Margaret Chute (1886–1948) - stage actor, suffragist, freelance Hollywood journalist and photographer born in South Norwood.
* Arthur Conan Doyle (1859–1930) - author, lived at 12 Tennison Road in South Norwood, from 1891 to 1894 (commemorated with a blue plaque). Contrary to popular belief, he did not use the area as the setting for the Sherlock Holmes short story &quot;The Adventure of the Norwood Builder&quot; (1903). This story, for the most part, takes place in Lower Norwood (today known as West Norwood). The only connection between this story and South Norwood is that South Norwood&#x27;s railway station Norwood Junction is used by the character Jonas Oldacre. The NatWest Bank on South Norwood High Street was, in Victorian times until the mid-1980s, the local police station and is the most likely candidate for the police station mentioned in the second Sherlock Holmes novel, &quot;The Sign of the Four&quot; (1890). Conan Doyle&#x27;s house was put up for auction on 28 February 2013 but the house failed to reach its reserve price.
* Peter Grant (1935–1995) - music manager, most notably for Led Zeppelin, born and grew up in South Norwood.
* William Stanley (1829–1909) - inventor and architect, set up a technical institute and factory in the area.
* Stormzy - rapper, grew up in South Norwood.
* William Walker (1869–1918) - diver, most notable for shoring up Winchester Cathedral and thereby saving it from collapse. Lived at 118 Portland Road (commemorated with a plaque).
* Ellen E Ciss Wright - athlete, All England 440 yards champion, lived at 6 Clifford Road; a plaque on the Portland Road leisure centre commemorates her.
*Edward Vernon Arnold, Indologist and Classical scholar, born 1857 in South Norwood, where his father was Vicar of St. Mark&#x27;s Church.

<text>Disney Experiences, commonly known as Disney Parks, is one of the three major divisions of the Walt Disney Company. It was founded on April 1, 1971, exactly six months before the opening of the Walt Disney World Resort.
Led by Josh D&#x27;Amaro, the company&#x27;s theme parks hosted over 157.3 million guests, making Disney Parks the world&#x27;s most visited theme park company worldwide,&lt;ref name=&quot;TEA/AECOM&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; with United Kingdom-based Merlin Entertainments coming in second at 67 million guests. It is Disney&#x27;s largest business segment by employee headcount, with approximately 130,000 of the company&#x27;s 180,000 employees as of 2015. In March 2018, Disney Consumer Products and Interactive Media was merged into Parks and Resorts and renamed Disney Parks, Experiences and Products. In September 2020, Disney Parks, Experiences and Products laid off 28,000 employees in wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

== Background ==
Originally, entry into the theme park and travel business was a side project of Walt Disney himself. As the Disneylandia project started to become a reality, Walt Disney Productions at Walt&#x27;s request set up Disneyland, Inc. (DLI) in 1951 and agreed to a design deal in March 1953 with WED Enterprises (WED), Walt&#x27;s personal corporation, which then included what would now be called Walt Disney Imagineering. With the WED concept designs and prospectus for Disneylandia, Roy Disney in September 1953 met with TV networks in a deal for Disney-produced TV show and Disneyland investment. American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres (AB-PT) agreed to the Disneyland, Inc. investment. Joining AB-PT as Disneyland investors were Walt Disney Productions (WDP), Western Publishing and Walt Disney. Walt Disney Productions had the option to repurchase the Walt Disney, WED and Western Publishing shares (31%) by May 1, 1959, for $562,500.

With a need for the Disneyland Hotel nearby and no funding available for Disney to build it, Walt Disney approached Jack Wrather to build the hotel who agreed.

Disneyland, changed from Disneylandia, was announced in by Walt to be opened in . On , the Disneyland park opened with five themed &quot;lands&quot; containing eighteen attractions with double the expected guests. WED owned Santa Fe &amp; Disneyland Railroad opened, too.

On June 29, 1957, Disney Production exercised its options to purchase all but AB-PT&#x27;s common stock outstanding. This allowed WDP to consolidate DLI into its 1957 annual accounting statements adding four months&#x27; worth of net profits, $511K. In June 1960, Walt Disney Productions completed the purchase of AB-PT&#x27;s share of the company for nearly $7.5 million and its TV contract, and the theme park became a fully owned subsidiary of Walt Disney Productions.

== History ==
Beginning in 1958 with the contracting of Economics Research Associates (ERA) to find a location for another Disney resort, Disney Productions moved beyond a single park. ERA recommended Florida; another study in 1961 named Ocala or Orlando in Florida as possible locations. In , Walt Disney made a trip to Florida for final site selection.:333, 334 In 1962, Disney Productions purchased Celebrity Sports Center (opened on September 17, 1960, in Denver, Colorado) from its owners, including Walt Disney, Art Linkletter, and John Payne, to use as a staff training center for its second resort. In 1963, Roy made plans to buy from , which was carried out in 1964, amassing by . Plans for the Florida project that would eventually become Walt Disney World were announced to the public in November 1965. Legislation forming the Reedy Creek Improvement District, the Reedy Creek Improvement Act, was signed into law by Florida Governor Claude R. Kirk, Jr. on May 12, 1967, allowing Disney to build the infrastructure for the second park. Ground breaking followed for the future Reedy Creek park on May 30. In Roy O. Disney&#x27;s last act as CEO in 1968, he officially named the second park Walt Disney World.:357

Disneyland International was incorporated on November 20, 1961. The next year, The Oriental Land Company contacted Disney about building a theme park.

In 1959, the WED-owned Disneyland-Alweg Monorail System began operations at Disneyland.

The first Audio-Animatronic attraction, Walt Disney&#x27;s Enchanted Tiki Room, opened at Disneyland in 1963. Disneyland&#x27;s first new themed land, New Orleans Square, opened in . Tomorrowland was revamped in 1967 with seven new attractions. The design and architectural group and the WED Enterprise name was purchased from Walt&#x27;s corporation, renamed as Retlaw Enterprise.

Disney expanded into attractions at the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair with It&#x27;s a Small World and costumed character appearances. When the characters proved a hit at the 1964 World&#x27;s Fair, Walt wanted another outlet for &quot;live&quot; characters; thus, Disneyland put on &quot;Disney on Parade&quot;, a self-produced live arena show starting in 1969. Small World and its famous song lasted two years at the fair; it was then moved to Disneyland as an expanded major attraction in 1966 and later duplicated in the other Disney theme parks.

In 1965, Walt Disney won a bid with the US Forest Service to develop Mineral King as a ski resort. The Sierra Club sued in to stop the development, which was granted by the federal district judge. The Forest Service appealed and won at the appeal and the Supreme Court. This ruling opened the possibility of refiling to the club. In the next round of lawsuits, the same district judge blocked the redevelopment. The injunction and the passage of the National Environmental Policy Act led to Disney backing out.

$40 million worth of Walt Disney Productions Convertible Debentures were sold in to fund Disney World (WDW). The next year in February, an agreement was made with multiple labor unions, in which the unions exchanged the right to strike for regular pay increases during the first building phase. By 1971, chairman of the Park Operations Committee and vice president of park operations Dick Nunis was appointed executive vice president of Disneyland and Walt Disney World.

Walt Disney World began operation on , with the Magic Kingdom park at a cost of $400 million. The Magic Kingdom had six themed lands: Main Street, Adventureland, Fantasyland, Frontierland, Liberty Square, and Tomorrowland. Additionally, Disney&#x27;s Fort Wilderness Resort campground and two hotels, Disney&#x27;s Contemporary Resort and Disney&#x27;s Polynesian Village Resort, also opened.

Disneyland expanded in 1972 with a seventh themed land, Bear Country, replacing the Indian Village of Frontierland, and later renamed Critter Country. In 1979, the Disneyland crafts and maintenance union workers went on strike for 15 days, at first, rejecting and then accepting the park&#x27;s contract. Space Mountain opens at Disneyland in 1977.

Two more hotels opened in 1973 at Walt Disney World: the Golf Resort and the Gold Resort; Disney opened the Buena Vista Club golf club in Lake Buena Vista on .:71 Lake Buena Vista Village, the shopping area, opened on and was renamed Walt Disney World Village in 1977.:280 Celebrity Sports Center, Disney World&#x27;s training center, was sold on March 29, 1979.

At Walt Disney World, the Treasure Island nature preserve pens opened on April 8, 1974,:569 renamed Discovery Island in 1977.:126 On , the WEDway PeopleMover opened in the Magic Kingdom&#x27;s Tomorrowland. The first water park, River Country, opened on at Disney World.:22 EPCOT Center&#x27;s groundbreaking occurred at Walt Disney World in May 1979.

In 1979, Oriental Land and Disney agreed to build a Japanese theme park. Tokyo Disneyland opened on on in Urayasu, Chiba, Japan.

=== Walt Disney Outdoor Recreation Division ===
With the retirement of Donn Tatum as Walt Disney Productions&#x27; Chairman and CEO on June 3, 1980, three divisions were formed, including the Walt Disney Outdoor Recreation Division, of which Disney Legend, Dick Nunis was named division president. Disneyland started using Disney Dollars on May 5, 1987, while Walt Disney World parks started with Epcot on October 2. A renegotiated Disneyland Japan royalty agreement in April 1988 by Chief Financial Officer Gary L. Wilson netted Disney US$723 million in cash in exchange for lower royalty payments.

The steam railroad and monorail at Disneyland were purchased from Retlaw Enterprises, formerly WED Enterprises, in 1982. Bear Country was renamed Critter Country on November 23, 1988.

Tishman Company&#x27;s plans for two Walt Disney World hotels were rejected by the new CEO Michael Eisner on September 30, 1984, marking a change in Disney architecture. New plans for the Dolphin and Swan hotels were submitted by Michael Graves in July 1986; ground breaking took place on January 28, 1988. The first non-Disney owned hotel, Pickett Suite Resort, opened in Disney World Village on March 15, 1987.

On June 1, 1982, the Walt Disney World monorail line was extended to EPCOT Center from the Transportation and Ticket Center.:338 The EPCOT Center theme park opened on October 1, 1982, at a building cost of US$1.2 billion, with two areas, Future World and World Showcase.:272

Plans for a Hollywood-style theme park were announced in April 1985 for the Walt Disney World resort at a project cost of US$300 million. In April 1985, Disney signed a licensing agreement with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), giving Disney the right to use the MGM name, logo and movie library for this third park. Construction of the Disney-MGM Studios theme park began in 1986. Disney-MGM Studios opened on May 1, 1989, along with a Pleasure Island entertainment area; its second water park, Disney&#x27;s Typhoon Lagoon, opened on June 1. In 1983, Walt Disney World Village&#x27;s name was changed to the Disney Village Marketplace. A new themed area, Mickey&#x27;s Birthdayland, opened in the Magic Kingdom near Fantasyland on June 18, 1988.

In 1987, Disney and Ron Brierley&#x27;s Industrial Equity (Pacific) Ltd., already a 28% owner of the Wrather Corporation, agreed to purchase the remaining Wrather Corporation stock with a 50% share each. Wrather Corporation owned the Disneyland Hotel and operated the Queen Mary and Spruce Goose tourist attractions. In March 1988, Disney purchased Industrial Equity&#x27;s half of Wrather Corporation.

In 1985, Premier Cruise Line became the licensed partner cruise line with Disney. This allowed Disney characters on their ships and combined cruise, hotel, and theme park packages.

=== Walt Disney Attractions ===

The first Disney Vacation Club Resorts, Vacation Club Resort, opened on October 1, 1991, and was renamed Disney&#x27;s Old Key West Resort in January 1996. These vacation club hotels were operated by Disney Vacation Developments, Inc. as vacation timeshares. The first off-resort vacation club hotel was Vacation Club Resort, which opened on October 1, 1995, in Vero Beach, Florida.

In 1993, Premier Cruises discontinued its partnership with Disney for one with Warner Bros. After failing to reach agreements with Carnival or Royal Caribbean, Disney announced in 1994 the formation of its cruise line. The Disney Cruise Line launched with the Disney Magic ship in 1998 along with its exclusive resort island port of Castaway Cay.

Disney reportedly had plans to build a park named Disney&#x27;s America. The park was to have been located in Haymarket, Virginia; of property were purchased from Exxon in 1993. The history-themed park was announced on November 11, 1993. The plans for the called for a amusement park, a campground, a golf course, of office/commercial space, and 2500 homes. With projections indicating that the park would operate at a loss and with opposition in the press, Disney canceled the project on September 15, 1994.

Walt Disney Imagineering created Disney Fair, a U.S. traveling attraction, which premiered in September 1996. The fair was poorly attended and was pulled after a few stops. Disney Entertainment Projects (Asia Pacific) Inc., a new Disney Asian Pacific subsidiary, selected a renamed fair called DisneyFest as its first project, taking it to Singapore to open there on October 30, 1997.

In November 1995, Disney announced the building of Tokyo DisneySea, to be owned by Oriental along with Tokyo Disneyland. Oriental and Disney signed the DisneySea licensing agreement in November 1997; the theme park was scheduled to open in 2001 at a cost of $2.6 billion.

In December 1998, Walt Disney Attractions added Disneyland Paris, Disney Regional Entertainment and Walt Disney Imagineering to its portfolio, which already held Disney World, Disney Cruise Line, Disneyland, and Tokyo Disneyland. Chairman Dick Nunis retired at the same time. On October 31, 1999, Walt Disney Attractions, Inc. was merged into Walt Disney Attractions, LLC.

=== Walt Disney Parks and Resorts Worldwide ===
Walt Disney Parks and Resorts Worldwide, Inc. was incorporated on September 29, 2008, and took over the parks and resorts business segment. Disney Parks and Resorts reorganized in early 2009 which included layoffs in all units due to recession-induced falling attendance. 600 U.S. managers in January were buyout packages.

As an extension of the &quot;One Disney&quot; initiative and the resignation of Weiss, Disney Vacation Club was added to New Vacation Operations. While Holz and Meg Crofton joined Disney Parks and Resorts executive committee in July 2011. At that time, Crofton was transferred from Disney World president to president of operations in the U.S. and France, a new positions.

The &quot;Disney Dream&quot; ship began service in January 2011 and Disney Cruise Line (DCL) announced the maiden voyage of the &quot;Disney Fantasy&quot; to be March 31, 2012. The Dream deployment allowed Disney Wonder to be stationed at Port of Los Angeles for Mexican Riviera cruises, but initial served in the short Alaska cruise season.

On February 5, 2015, it was announced that Tom Staggs had been promoted to Disney Company Chief operating officer but would continue as chairman of Parks and Resorts until his successor was named. On February 23, 2015, Robert Chapek was named chairman of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts effective that day.

On April 29, 2015, the Walt Disney Company, through the subsidiary, Carousel Holdings Eat LLC, has purchased Carousel Inn &amp; Suites hotel in Anaheim, from Good Hope International for $32 million. The purchase was considered a strategic purchase; the hotel would not be considered a part of the Disneyland hotel portfolio and would operate independently. Disney indicated in August 2016, that the company would be closing the Carousel Inn in October 2016 in preparation for razing it as part of plans to construct a new parking structure, transit plaza and pedestrian bridge over Harbor Boulevard.

On February 10, 2017, Disney revealed a deal to purchase Kingdom Holding Co.&#x27;s shares of Euro Disney S.C.A. as the first step in purchasing the remaining shares held by others. Disney has offered about $2.12 a share, a 67% premium over the Euronext Paris Stock Exchange value as of February 9. The company expects the buyout and delisting to be finished by June. Plans are for the company to invest another $1.4 billion into Disneyland Paris after the buyout to counteract the recent Paris terrorist attack, which hurt a previous 2014 park hotel investment. If this buyout is successful, it would make the resort the only resort 100% owned and operated by Disney outside of the United States of America. On June 13, 2017, the Walt Disney Company reached the 95% threshold required for a mandatory takeover according to French law, owning 97.08% of Euro Disney S.C.A., paving the way for the Walt Disney Company to become the sole owner and operator of Disneyland Paris.

=== Disney Parks, Experiences and Products ===
As part of the Walt Disney Company&#x27;s March 2018 strategic reorganization, Disney Consumer Products, and Interactive Media was merged into the Walt Disney Parks and Resorts segment and renamed Walt Disney Parks, Experiences and Consumer Products. Parks and Resorts Chairman Bob Chapek was named chairman of this new segment, who also previously served as head of Disney Consumer Products. At the time, the Consumer Products chairman position was vacant, as its former holder, James Pitaro, had been recently appointed as the new head of ESPN and co-chair of Disney Media Networks.

In March 2018, a Disney Parks West regional division was formed with Disneyland Resort in California, Walt Disney World in Florida, and Disneyland Paris under Catherine Powell, outgoing Disneyland Paris president. This mirrors the Disney Parks East regional division consisting of Shanghai Disney Resort, Hong Kong Disneyland and Walt Disney Attractions Japan and headed by Michael Colglazier. Imagineering was expected to take on the development of merchandise, games, publishing, and apps. Paul Gainer moved up from Disney Retail head to head up the new Global Product Management and Distribution unit, which includes Disney Retail, Global Licensing, and digital guest experience.

New Vacation Operations and Disney Cruise Line division was renamed Disney Signature Experiences along with a new president, Jeff Vahle, for the division in April 2018. On January 1, 2019, Walt Disney Parks, Experiences and Consumer Products changed its name to Disney Parks, Experiences and Products. Disney Cruise Line purchased in early March 2019 another Bahamas destination, the Lighthouse Point property on the island of Eleuthera. In July 2019, Disney denied reports of plans to launch its own airline with the purchase of small regional airlines in the United States.

With the acquisition of 21st Century Fox by August 2019, National Geographic Partners&#x27; non-TV operations were transferred into its Disney counterpart with NG Media and National Geographic Expeditions moving to the segment&#x27;s units, Disney Publishing Worldwide and Disney Signature Experiences, respectively.

Powell supervised the two Star Wars-themed land, Star Wars: Galaxy&#x27;s Edge, openings in May at Disneyland and August 2019 in Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios. However, initial numbers showed an attendance dropped instead of the boost such an opening should have generated. In late September, Powell left the company with the Parks West regional division being dissolved, thus having those resorts&#x27; executives directly report to chairman Chapek. He denied that Powell was let go because of the low attendance issue from Galaxy&#x27;s Edge, but instead, Powell&#x27;s position was a temporary one to allow Chapek to focus on the acquisition of 21st Century Fox.

Powell&#x27;s departure from Disney was soon followed by a domino of executive appointments, as announced on September 26, 2019. George Kalogridis, then-president of the Walt Disney World Resort, was promoted as the president of segment development and enrichment. Kalogridis is replaced by Josh D&#x27;Amaro, then-president of the Disneyland Resort, as president of the Walt Disney World Resort. In turn, D&#x27;Amaro was replaced by Rebecca Campbell as president of the Disneyland Resort. Campbell transferred from the Walt Disney Direct-to-Consumer &amp; International segment where she served as the president of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. Both D&#x27;Amaro and Campbell assumed these roles in November 2019. In addition, Michael Colglazier is also promoted as the president and managing director of Disney Parks International and will oversee Disneyland Paris as well as those under the Parks East regional division. In February 2020, Chapek was promoted from chairman of this segment to chief executive officer of the Walt Disney Company under executive chairman Bob Iger.

With the closure of all Disney parks in 2020 during the coronavirus pandemic, Disney donated 150,000 rain ponchos usually sold at the parks to MedShare, to be distributed in hospitals.

In May 2020, CEO Chapek named new appointees under the Disney Parks, Experiences, and Products segment. Succeeding Chapek as chairman of this segment is Josh D&#x27;Amaro, then-president of the Walt Disney World Resort. Jeff Vahle, then-president of Disney Signature Experiences, replaced D&#x27;Amaro as president of the Walt Disney World Resort. Thomas Mazloum, senior vice president for transportation and resort operations at the Walt Disney World Resort, succeeded Vahle as president of Disney Signature Experiences. In addition, Kareem Daniel, former president of operations/product creation/publishing/games at Walt Disney Imagineering, was named president of consumer products, games and publishing. Ken Potrock replaced Rebecca Campbell as president of the Disneyland Resort; Campbell returned to the Director-to-Consumer &amp; International segment as its chairman, replacing Kevin Mayer.

On July 15, 2020, it was announced that Jill Estorino, then-executive vice president, global marketing and sales, replaced Michael Colglazier as president and managing director of Disney Parks International, supervising Tokyo Disney Resort, Disneyland Paris, Hong Kong Disneyland, and Shanghai Disney Resort.

On September 28, 2020, D&#x27;Amaro announced the difficult decision to lay off over 28,000 employees in the parks division, many of them being part-time workers. D&#x27;Amaro cited the uncertainty of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic as well as California&#x27;s continued reluctance to reopen Disneyland as factors. Nearly 6,700 Central Florida employees, including almost 6,500 Disney World workers, were also among those laid off. On October 13, 2020, Disney CEO and former Disney Park, Experiences and Products head Bob Chapek agreed to keep Disney World at only 25% capacity until the Center For Disease Control (CDC) issued new guidance and also stated that with regards to reopening Disneyland, &quot;It&#x27;s not much of a negotiation. It&#x27;s pretty much a mandate that we stay closed.&quot; Disneyland Resort was finally allowed to reopen on April 30, 2021, after a 412-day closure.

Historically, Imagineering and certain other Disney units merged into DPEP were physically headquartered in the Los Angeles metropolitan area (near the Walt Disney Company&#x27;s film and television divisions)—even as the rapid growth of Walt Disney World meant that by the start of the 21st century, most Disney U.S. domestic theme park jobs were based in Florida, not California. In July 2021, it was reported that approximately 2,000 DPEP positions would be transferred over the next couple of years to a new 60-acre corporate campus in the Lake Nona area of Orlando, Florida, and it was later reported that fall that as many as 90% of the transferred positions would be Imagineering positions. The relocation was reportedly motivated in part by $570 million in tax breaks from the state of Florida, as well as Florida&#x27;s business-friendly climate, lower cost of living, and lack of a state income tax. The planned relocation was cancelled in May 2023 amidst a feud with Florida governor Ron DeSantis.

=== Disney Experiences ===
On November 16, 2023, the division was renamed Disney Experiences.

On August 10, 2024, D&#x27;Amaro hosted a Disney Experiences Showcase at the Honda Center as part of D23: The Ultimate Fan Event (formerly D23 Expo), in which he revealed how Disney Experiences planned to invest $60 billion over the next decade in adding new and improved attractions to its parks. He brought out All-4-One to sing &quot;I Swear&quot; to celebrate Disney&#x27;s promise to build four more cruise ships on top of four already under construction, bringing its fleet to a total of 13 by 2031.

However, Disney executives were notably reluctant at D23 to address superfans&#x27; increasing frustration with the skyrocketing ticket prices at Disney parks over the preceding decade. The pricing changes had rendered Disney theme parks largely inaccessible to most middle class consumers because the cost of one day and one night at a Disney theme park was now higher than what many people spend on vacation in an entire year. On August 16, D&#x27;Amaro responded to such criticism by stressing the broad range of Disney&#x27;s ticket pricing and options and explaining that the company would &quot;provide as much access and flexibility as we possibly can, so as many of our fans can experience these things as possible&quot;.

=== Disney resorts ===


==== Disneyland Resort ====

The Disneyland Resort was founded as a single park, Disneyland, and opened on July 17, 1955, in Anaheim, California. Disneyland Hotel opened to the public on October 5, 1955.

Disneyland Paris opened on April 12, 1992 as Euro Disney Resort. Located in Marne-la-Vallée in the suburbs of Paris, France, it features two theme parks, Disneyland Park and Walt Disney Studios Park (soon to be renamed Disney Adventure World), a golf course, the Disney Village entertainment complex, and seven Disney resort hotels, over . It is the only resort outside the United States fully owned and operated by the Walt Disney Company.

The resort consists of Hong Kong Disneyland theme park, Inspiration Lake Recreation Centre, and three hotels, with land reserved for future expansion.

=== Training ===
Each new employee (&quot;cast member&quot;) at a Disney theme park is trained at a Disney University, founded by Walt Disney in 1955. Before training specific to the work they will perform, each employee attends the &quot;Disney Traditions&quot; course where they learn about the philosophies and history of Disney&#x27;s guest services.

=== Abandoned and misreported concepts ===

Disney had plans to build Walt Disney&#x27;s Riverfront Square in St. Louis, but canceled the project in July 1965.

In the 1960s, Disney initiated a plan for a ski resort at Mineral King in California. Opposition from environmental groups led by the Sierra Club led to a temporary court injunction in 1969 and legal battles through the 1970s. The project&#x27;s planning and scale changed multiple times, and in 1978, Mineral King was annexed into Sequoia National Park, ending any possibility of developing a resort there.

Disney had plans to build a park named Disney&#x27;s America in Haymarket, Virginia, but abandoned the idea in 1994. On September 28, 1994, Michael Eisner announced Disney was canceling its plans after a bruising national media fight with Protect Historic America, and aggressive local opposition in Virginia from Protect Prince William and other citizen groups.

Disney had plans to build a smaller Disneyland-style theme park in Sydney, Australia, between 2007 and 2008, with the proposed name &quot;Disney Wharf at Sydney Harbour&quot;, but the concept was abandoned due to mixed responses in the New South Wales Government.

In early January 2011, conflicting reports emerged regarding Disney&#x27;s involvement in a proposed entertainment complex in Haifa, Israel, whose plans include a small (30,000 square meter) amusement park scheduled to open in 2013. The project was set to be partially funded by Shamrock Holdings, a Disney-affiliated investment firm. In the wake of reports from Israeli business newspaper, &quot;Globes&quot; and industry newswire &quot;Amusement Management&quot; that Disney itself would be involved in the project&#x27;s development, a spokesperson for Walt Disney Parks and Resorts clarified to &quot;Fast Company&quot; that Disney did not have any plans to be involved in the building of the park.

=== Disney intellectual properties outside Disney parks ===
Due to its acquisitions of Marvel Entertainment in 2009, Lucasfilm in 2012 and 21st Century Fox in 2019, some Disney-owned franchises are represented in its competitors&#x27; parks.

==== Marvel Entertainment ====
Marvel Super Hero Island, a themed land featuring characters and settings from Marvel Comics, has operated at Universal Orlando Resort&#x27;s Universal Islands of Adventure park since 1999, as well as the Islands of Adventure, cloned ride &quot;The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man&quot; at Universal Studios Japan from 2004 to 2024. Under Marvel&#x27;s 1994 agreement with Universal Destinations &amp; Experiences in regional terms, none of the Marvel characters and other persons related to such characters (e.g., side characters, team members, and the villains associated with the Avengers, Fantastic Four, X-Men, Spider-Man, etc.) connected with Islands of Adventure and Universal Studios Japan can be used at Walt Disney World and Tokyo Disney Resort. The Disneyland Resort, Walt Disney World Resort, and Tokyo Disney Resort also cannot use the Marvel brand name as part of an attraction or marketing and the Marvel-themed simulator ride. This clause has allowed Walt Disney World to have meet-and-greets with Marvel characters not associated with the ones present at Islands of Adventure, such as Star-Lord and Gamora from &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy,&quot; and Doctor Strange. Hong Kong Disneyland, Shanghai Disneyland, and Disneyland Paris either have or planned to incorporate meet and greets as well as attractions relating to the Marvel characters, as well as using the Marvel name and the Marvel simulator ride.

IMG Worlds of Adventure in Dubai has a Marvel-themed section.

==== &quot;Star Wars&quot; ====
A &quot;Star Wars&quot;-themed section of Legoland California&#x27;s Miniland USA opened in 2011, with a similar version opening at Legoland Florida in November 2012, just weeks before Disney&#x27;s acquisition of Lucasfilm and the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise. However, the &quot;Star Wars&quot;-themed sections at Miniland USA, Legoland Florida, and other Legoland areas closed at the start of 2020 before the 2020 theme park season due to the expiration of their contract with Lucasfilm.

==== 20th Century Studios ====
Following Disney&#x27;s acquisition of 21st Century Fox, which included properties from 20th Century Studios and 20th Television, in March 2019, &quot;The Simpsons&quot; became the intellectual property of Disney. Like Marvel before it, &quot;The Simpsons&quot; is represented in Universal parks, with &quot;The Simpsons&quot; Ride having operated at Universal Studios Hollywood and Universal Studios Florida since 2008, with accompanying themed areas based on the show&#x27;s setting of Springfield.

The Fox acquisition also made Disney responsible for the future of Malaysia&#x27;s under-construction 20th Century Fox World theme park. The park&#x27;s owner, Genting Group, filed a $1.75 billion lawsuit against the Walt Disney Company and 21st Century Fox in November 2018, accusing Fox of trying to back out of the deal for licensing the theme park. In the suit, Genting Malaysia alleges that Fox has taken steps to cancel the contract. The suit also names Disney as a defendant, contending that Disney executives, following the company&#x27;s then-pending acquisition of Fox, were &quot;calling the shots&quot; on the project and that they were opposed to the park because they would have &quot;no control&quot; over its operations and that it would be adjacent to a casino, which would go against Disney&#x27;s &quot;family-friendly&quot; image. Fox, in turn, referred to the suit as &quot;without merit&quot;, stating that their reasons for withdrawing from the deal were due to Genting consistently not meeting &quot;agreed-upon deadlines for several years&quot; and that Genting&#x27;s attempts to blame Disney for Fox&#x27;s default were &quot;made up&quot;. In July 2019, it was announced that Fox and Genting had settled their respective lawsuits. As part of the deal, Genting would be given &quot;a license to use certain Fox intellectual properties&quot; and that non-Fox intellectual property would make up the rest of the attractions in the park. The outdoor park would also no longer be referred to as 20th Century Fox World, but instead would be named Genting SkyWorlds.

=== Adaptations ===

While Disney Parks generally adapt movies into rides, some Disney theme park attractions have been adapted into or have served inspiration for films, books, comic books, television series, television specials and television pilots. Disney entered the television field with a network TV show named after Disneyland (which was then its only park, and was being built at the time), in order to fund the park. In this series, some episodes featured the park or a park attraction. The Walt Disney Company pioneered and is the only film company and theme park company to have converted theme park attractions to film productions. However, lackluster results were achieved for most of these films except for the &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; series. Walt Disney Pictures produced two &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; sequels in 2006 and 2011 that made approximately a billion dollars each at the box office.

At first, Disney had merely dabbled with this type of film. Disney Telefilms made the first movie-based-on-ride, &quot;Tower of Terror&quot;, for the Wonderful World of Disney anthology television series in 1997. In 2000, Touchstone Pictures made &quot;Mission to Mars&quot; based on the closed ride of the same name.

Walt Disney Pictures took the Country Bear Jamboree attraction and made it into &quot;The Country Bears&quot; in 2002. In 2003, Walt Disney Pictures issued two ride-based films in &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot; and &quot;The Haunted Mansion&quot;. &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; launched a film series and a franchise. After four Pirates sequels, the franchise took in more than $5.4 billion worldwide.

Disney Publishing Worldwide started mining Disney Parks with its The Kingdom Keepers series. The first novel of the series, &quot;Disney After Dark&quot;, was released in 2005. A five-book series was laid out by Pearson, but was extended to seven with the first book&#x27;s success. On March 31, 2015, the first novel in The Kingdom Keepers sequel trilogy series was released.

Other Disney Publishing projects based on the Disney Parks include the &quot;Tales from Adventureland&quot; trilogy by Jason Lethcoe in 2017-2018, based around Adventureland attractions such as the Enchanted Tiki Room and Jungle Cruise, the &quot;Tales from the Haunted Mansion&quot; anthology series by John Esposito writing under the pen name of the Mansion&#x27;s ghostly librarian Amicus Arcane, and the Shinji Takahashi books by Julie Kagawa, which explores the Society of Explorers and Adventurers organization seen in various parks within the modern day.

With the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise as Disney Pictures&#x27; top franchise, the company had been looking for additional projects in this category for a decade. Disney Pictures took another push at additional adaptations in the 2010s. By November 2010, Jon Favreau had been tapped to develop the Magic Kingdom park into a &quot;Night at the Museum&quot; like film, with Strike Entertainment signed on to produce it after a script by Ronald D. Moore was turned down. Another Haunted Mansion film was in the works with Guillermo del Toro as of August 2012. Mr. Toad&#x27;s Wild Ride ride film was in the works at Disney by January 2013. Tomorrowland, first to be loosely based on a theme park area, was announced in January 2013 for a December 2014 release. Also in 2013, American Broadcasting Company had ordered a pilot based on Big Thunder Mountain Railroad. It&#x27;s A Small World was added to the list of known two projects in November 26, 2013 and April 22, 2014. Tower of Terror was given a theatrical treatment by John August under producer Jim Whitaker in October 2015, while the long-in-production Jungle Cruise gained an actor.

Marvel Worldwide with Disney announced in October 2013 that in January 2014 it would release its first comic book title under their joint Disney Kingdoms imprint. Running for six miniseries, Disney Kingdoms would feature adaptations of the unbuilt Museum of the Weird, two serials about Figment and Dreamfinder from Epcot&#x27;s Journey into Imagination, Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, the Haunted Mansion, and Walt Disney&#x27;s Enchanted Tiki Room. Disney Publishing Worldwide&#x27;s revived Disney Comics imprint first publication was the &quot;Space Mountain&quot; graphic novel released on May 7, 2014 and based on the same name park attraction.

In May 2017, Freeform cable channel aired a special documentary, &quot;Disney&#x27;s Fairy Tale Weddings&quot;, based on the services provided by Disney Parks and Resorts unit, Disney&#x27;s Fairy Tale Weddings &amp; Honeymoons. With success of the May special, the show was picked up as a series with seven episodes in October 2017. However, another special, Holiday Magic, was aired on December 11, 2017 with the now six episode regular series starting on June 11, 2018.

== Disney Signature Experiences ==
The Disney Signature Experiences division, which was formerly known as the Disney Cruise Line &amp; New Vacation Operations, holds newer non-theme park travel units under president Thomas Mazloum.

In February 2009, Tom McAlpin left the Disney Cruise Line presidency and was replaced by Karl Holz as president of both Disney Cruise Line and New Vacation Operations. New Vacation Operations included the Adventures by Disney. The cruise line ordered three ships of a new class of ship, Triton, in 2016 and 2017. In April 2017, it was announced that Karl Holz would retire as president of Disney Cruise Line on February 15, 2018 and Anthony Connelly would assumed the role of president on October 1, 2017.

Soon after a March 2018 conglomerate wide reorganization that formed Disney Parks, Experiences and Products segment division, Disney Cruise Line and New Vacation Operations was renamed Disney Signature Experiences along with a new president, Jeff Vahle. Ken Potrock was promoted from Senior Vice President and General Manager of Disney Vacation Club to President of Consumer Products in May 2018. Disney Cruise Line purchased in early March 2019 another Bahamas destination, Lighthouse Point property on the island of Eleuthera from the Bahamas Government.

=== Disney Cruise Line ===

Formed in 1995, its fleet currently comprises six ships: Disney Magic (launched 1998), Disney Wonder (1999), Disney Dream (2011), Disney Fantasy (2012), Disney Wish (2022), and Disney Treasure (2024). Two more ships, the Disney Destiny and Disney Adventure, will be launching in late 2025. Five additional ships are planned through 2031, which will bring the total fleet count to 13.

Disney Cruise Line also operates two private destinations in the Bahamas: Castaway Cay and Lookout Cay at Lighthouse Point.

=== Disney Vacation Club ===

A timeshare program that includes 12 themed resorts within Walt Disney World Resort, 3 within Disneyland Resort, and 3 stand-alone locations: Disney&#x27;s Aulani Resort, Disney&#x27;s Hilton Head Island Resort, and Disney&#x27;s Vero Beach Resort.

There are an estimated 220,000 club members.

=== Adventures by Disney ===

Launched in 2005, Adventures by Disney is a program of all-inclusive, guided vacation tour packages offered at predominantly non-Disney sites around the world.

=== National Geographic Expeditions ===

National Geographic Expeditions leads travelers to people and places on every continent, with access to scientists, storytellers, explorers, museums and more. National Geographic Experts and local guides share their knowledge so travelers are inspired by immersive expeditions that deepen their understanding of the world.

With the acquisition of 21st Century Fox by August 2019, National Geographic Partners&#x27; National Geographic Expeditions moved into Disney Signature Experiences.

=== Golden Oak at Walt Disney World Resort ===

A residential neighborhood located within the Walt Disney World Resort, consisting of 299 homes, the private Golden Oak Club, and the Four Seasons Resort Orlando resort hotel.

=== Storyliving by Disney ===

Master-planned communities that utilize Disney Imagineering and are staffed by Disney cast members. Cotino, in Rancho Mirage, California, is the first community under development, while Asteria, in Pittsboro, North Carolina, is the second community under development, with other locations being explored.
== Other ventures ==
=== Disney Sports Enterprises ===
Disney Sports Enterprises, formerly called Disney Sports Attractions, is the unit of Disney Parks, Experiences and Products for Disney&#x27;s sports functions and is made up of the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex and the runDisney program.

==== DSE background ====
Disney Golf facilities date back to the opening of Disney World with two golf courses, the Palm and Magnolia courses. At the time, those courses started hosting the Walt Disney World Open Invitational, an annual PGA Tour event.

In 1994, Disney held the Walt Disney World Marathon, its first road race added additional races later. Disneyland Marathon and 5K were run in 1995 three weeks after the LA Marathon on March 26, 1995.

In 1995, Disney World had IMS Events, Inc. build the Walt Disney World Speedway. Disney&#x27;s Wide World of Sports opened in 1997 under executive Reggie Williams.

==== DSE history ====
By 1998, Williams was named vice president of Disney Sports Attractions, overseeing a newly created sports &amp; recreation division. The first 10K Disney Classic race on October 3, 1999, kicked off Disney World&#x27;s 15-month Millennium Celebration. On March 30, 2003, Sports Attractions held the first Disney Inline Marathon.

On November 21, 2007, Reggie Williams retired as vice president of Disney Sports Attractions. His replacement was named on January 3, 2008, when Ken Potrock was promoted to Senior Vice President, Disney Sports Enterprises. On February 25, 2010, Disney&#x27;s Wide World of Sports was renamed ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex with some upgrades and new facilities.

On September 25, 2011, Disney started the lease of its five Disney World golf courses (Palm, Magnolia, Lake Buena Vista, Osprey Ridge, and Oak Trail) to Arnold Palmer Golf Management to operate for 20 years while splitting the revenue. As part of the deal, Arnold Palmer would redesign the Palm course. The Orlando market for golf had a glut of course from the building boom then bust making profitability a challenge for any golf course. Disney hoped that Palmer&#x27;s involvement and &quot;Palmer Advantage&quot; membership club would draw more attention to Disney&#x27;s course. With the Osprey Ridge course sold to Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts to build a hotel, which was delayed until 2014, the golf management company would run the course until hotel construction begins. While another golf course, the Eagle Pines, was closed several years ago to make way for a residential housing subdivision development called Golden Oak being built in 2011.

In January 2013, Ken Petrock was promoted to Disney Vacation Club and Adventures by Disney senior vice president &amp; general manager while Tom Wolber, Disney Cruise Line senior vice president of operations, was promoted to replace Petrock at Disney Sports. In late June 2015, the Walt Disney World Speedway was shut down.

Sports marketing director Faron Kelley was promoted to vice president of sports in January 2016 and has responsibility for the water parks too. Senior vice president of Disney Springs and the ESPN Wide World of Sports Maribeth Bisienere was promoted to Senior Vice President of Parks in early March 2018. Rosalyn Durant moved over from ESPN to be appointed in February 2020 as senior vice president of operations for Disney Springs, ESPN Wide World of Sports and Waterparks.

==== runDisney ====

runDisney is the road race division of Disney Sports Enterprises. The division is designed to get runners to plan a &quot;runcation&quot;, a vacation planned to coincide with the race they signed up for.

Race weekends are currently held at Walt Disney World Resort and Disneyland Resort. Additional Virtual race events take place throughout the year. Runners who complete a 10-mile or longer race at both resorts in a calendar year can complete the unDisney Coast to Coast Race Challenge.

<text>Doomsday Book is a 1992 science fiction novel by American author Connie Willis. The novel won both the Hugo and Nebula Awards, and was shortlisted for other awards. The title of the book refers to the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; of 1086. Kivrin Engle, the main character, says that her recording is &quot;a record of life in the Middle Ages, which is what William the Conqueror&#x27;s survey turned out to be.&quot;

The novel is the first in a series about Oxford time-traveling historians, which includes &quot;To Say Nothing of the Dog&quot; (1998) and &quot;Blackout/All Clear&quot; (2010).

== Plot introduction ==
Willis&#x27;s mythos is a near future, first introduced in her story &quot;Fire Watch&quot; (1982), in which historians conduct field work by traveling into the past as observers. The research is conducted at the University of Oxford in mid-21st-century England.

In the book&#x27;s fictional universe, history resists time travel that would alter the past by preventing visits to certain places or times. Typically the machine used for time travel will refuse to function, rendering the trip impossible. In other cases, &quot;slippage&quot;, a shift in the exact time of arrival, occurs. The time-traveler arrives at the nearest place-and-time suitable for preventing a paradox; variance can be anything from 5 minutes to 5 years. Some periods theoretically accessible can also be deemed too dangerous for the historians by the authorities controlling time travel.

== Plot summary ==

Kivrin Engle, a young historian specializing in medieval history, asks her reluctant instructor, Professor James Dunworthy, and the authorities running the project to send her to Oxford in 1320 near Christmas. This period had previously been thought too dangerous, because it stretched the time travel net 300 years earlier than it had ever been used before. 

Shortly after sending Kivrin to the 14th century, Badri Chaudhuri, the technician who set the time travel coordinates for the trip, collapses, an early victim of a deadly new influenza epidemic that disrupts the university and leads to the city being quarantined. Kivrin also falls ill as soon as she arrives in the past. She awakens after several days of fever and delirium at a nearby manor whose residents have nursed her. She loses track of the &quot;drop point&quot;, the location where she arrived and must return at a prearranged time in order to get home.

The narrative switches between Kivrin in the 14th century and 21st-century Oxford during the influenza epidemic. Kivrin discovers many inconsistencies in what she knows about the time: the Middle English she learned is different from the local dialect, her maps are useless, her clothing is too fine, and she is far too clean. Kivrin fakes amnesia as she tries to find the drop point. She becomes semi-integrated into society, bonding with the children Agnes and Rosemund.

In 2054, Dunworthy tries to determine if Kivrin is safe as Oxford collapses into a panic. Dunworthy befriends Colin, the grand-nephew of his friend Mary Ahrens, a doctor. Fears grow that the virus causing the epidemic has been transmitted from the past via the time travel net. This causes the acting head of Balliol College Professor Gilchrist to order the net closed, effectively stranding Kivrin in the past.

Kivrin and Dunworthy realize that she has arrived in England in 1348, more than 20 years later than intended and during the Black Death pandemic. Though there was no slippage (the time shift between a traveler&#x27;s intended and actual date of arrival, ensuring they cannot change history), it is discovered that Badri, delirious with illness, input the incorrect coordinates. Ahrens and Dunworthy discover Badri contracted the influenza virus from human remains at the archaeological dig, starting the epidemic at future Oxford.

In the 14th century, two weeks after Kivrin&#x27;s arrival, a monk infected with the Black Death comes to the village. Within days, many residents of the village fall ill, and Kivrin, who is vaccinated and immune, attempts to help Father Roche treat them. Kivrin’s arranged retrieval date passes with neither side able to make it. Despite every effort, Kivrin watches all the people she has come to know die from the plague with the exception of a servant named Maisry who flees. The last one is Father Roche, who dies believing that Kivrin is a saint sent by God.

Influenza overwhelms the medical staff of the 21st century. Dunworthy is stricken by the disease but survives, awaking after the new year when the worst of the epidemic has passed. Of those able to help Dunworthy, many have died, including Ahrens, who succumbed while treating the infected. 

At last, Dunworthy recovers and arranges for Badri to send him back in time to rescue Kivrin. Dunworthy and Colin find her, the last person left alive in the town. The three return to 21st-century England shortly after New Year&#x27;s Day. Colin is excited by the concept of time travel, saying he will go to the Crusades when he is old enough.

<text>The first USS &quot;Fanning&quot; (DD-37) was a modified in the United States Navy during World War I and later in the United States Coast Guard, designated as CG-11. Her namesake was Nathaniel Fanning.

&quot;Fanning&quot; was launched on 11 January 1912 by Newport News Shipbuilding Company, Newport News, Virginia; sponsored by Mrs. Kenneth McAlpine; and commissioned on 21 June 1912. She was classified DD-37 on 17 July 1920.

==Pre-World War I==
In the years that preceded World War I, &quot;Fanning&quot; took part in the training schedule of the Atlantic Fleet, sailing to the Caribbean for winter maneuvers, and exercising off the coast of New England in the summers. Based at Norfolk, Virginia during the major portion of each year, she joined in gunnery practice in this area.

As war raged in Europe, &quot;Fanning&quot; intensified her preparations for any eventuality. When two German auxiliary cruisers visited Norfolk in September 1916, &quot;Fanning&quot; acted as part of their escort while they sailed in United States territorial waters. On 8 October, &quot;Fanning&quot; put out of Newport, Rhode Island, to search for the crews of ships sunk not far from Nantucket Light Ship by the German submarine . The destroyer recovered six survivors and landed them at Newport, Rhode Island the next day. The presence of &quot;U-58&quot; led to the speculation that a secret German submarine base might exist in the Long Island Sound—Block Island Sound area; &quot;Fanning&quot; searched from 12 to 14 October for evidence of such a base but found nothing, and returned to her regular operating schedule.

During the latter half of October 1916, &quot;Fanning&quot; and the fuel ship conducted experiments to develop methods of oiling at sea, a technique which has since given the United States Navy unbounded mobility and sea-keeping qualities. Torpedo and gunnery practices, and fleet maneuvers during the next eight months sharpened &quot;Fanning&quot;″s war-readiness, so that she was able to sail for distant service when called on in June 1917.

==World War I==

Based on Queenstown, Ireland, &quot;Fanning&quot; and her sister destroyers patrolled the eastern Atlantic, escorting convoys and rescuing survivors of sunken merchantmen. At 1615 on 17 November 1917, Coxswain Daniel David Loomis sighted the periscope of &quot;U-58&quot;, and the Officer of the Deck Lieutenant Walter Owen Henry ordered the destroyer to attack. &quot;Fanning&quot;″s first depth charge pattern scored, and as destroyer joined the action, the submarine broke surface, her crew pouring out on deck, hands raised in surrender. The depth charge had hit near the submarines diving planes, forcing the submarine to surface, and also knocked out the main generator aboard &quot;Fanning&quot;. &quot;Fanning&quot; maneuvered to pick up the prisoners as the damaged submarine sank, the first of two U-boats to fall victim to US Navy destroyers in World War I. Coxswain Daniel David Loomis and Lieutenant Walter Owen Henry both received the Navy Cross for this action.

&quot;Fanning&quot; continued escort and patrol duty for the duration of the war. Though she made numerous submarine contacts, all of her attacks were inconclusive. On many occasions, she went to the aid of torpedoed ships, rescuing survivors and carrying them into port. On 8 October 1918, she picked up a total of 103 survivors, 25 from a merchantman and 78 from the .

&quot;Fanning&quot; passed in review before President Woodrow Wilson on board the transport in Brest Harbor on 13 December, then remained at Brest until March of the following year. After a quick voyage to Plymouth, England, &quot;Fanning&quot; departed Brest for the States, by way of Lisbon, Portugal, and Ponta Delgada, Azores, in company with several other destroyers, and escorting a large group of submarine chasers. &quot;Fanning&quot; was placed out of commission at Philadelphia on 24 November 1919.

==Inter-war period==
On 7 June 1924, &quot;Fanning&quot; was transferred to the Coast Guard with whom she served until 24 November 1930. She was sold for scrap on 2 May 1934.

==Notable crew==
Robert Carney served aboard &quot;Fanning&quot; as gunnery and torpedo officer, and contributed to the sinking of German submarine &quot;U-58&quot;. On 29 July 1943, he was promoted to Rear Admiral and became Chief of Staff to Admiral William Halsey, Jr., commander, South Pacific Force, which included all ground, sea, and air forces in the South Pacific area. Carney later wrote that &quot;Admiral Halsey unfailingly gave credit to his subordinates for successes achieved, and took all blame for failures on his own shoulders.&quot;

During World War I, &quot;Fanning&quot; was commanded by Lieutenant Arthur S. Carpender, later Vice Admiral in charge of the entire Atlantic Destroyer fleet during World War II.

From 1925 to 1926, &quot;Fanning&quot; was commanded by Lieutenant Commander James Pine, later Vice Admiral and Superintendent of the United States Coast Guard Academy.

<text>Edward M. Layton (October 10, 1925 – December 26, 2004) was an American stadium organist who played at old Yankee Stadium for nearly 40 years, earning him membership in the New York Sports Hall of Fame.

==Early life and education==
Layton was born in Philadelphia. He graduated from West Chester State Teachers College, now West Chester University, where he majored in meteorology with a minor in music. He began playing the organ when he was 12 years old. 

While serving in the United States Navy during World War II, he learned to play the Hammond organ. After World War II, he began a career as a professional organist writing scores for soap operas on CBS,&quot;The Secret Storm,&quot; &quot;Love is a Many Splendored Thing,&quot; &quot;Love of Life,&quot; and &quot;Where the Heart Is.&quot; He recorded 27 albums of organ music, and travelled the world as a spokesperson and artist for Hammond Organ company.

==Career==
===Professional sports organist===
Layton joined the New York Yankees franchise in 1967 when CBS purchased the Yankees from Dan Topping. Because of pressure from the success of the New York Mets, their new Shea Stadium facility and the popularity of their organist, Jane Jarvis, Topping had installed an organ in Yankee Stadium at the beginning of the 1965 season. Lowrey organ demonstrator Toby Wright was the first Yankee organist and did the 1965 and 1966 seasons. Team president E. Michael Burke brought Layton in to play organ music at the stadium in 1967. 

At the time, he had never been to the stadium and knew nothing about baseball. He went on to play the organ for the Yankees for over three decades, taking a break from 1971 to 1977 to pursue other musical commitments. (Wright had returned as organist during that time.) When he retired on September 28, 2003, he played a final performance of &quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game&quot;, while fans chanted &quot;Eddie! Eddie!&quot;.
Current New York Yankees organists Ed Alstrom and Paul Cartier were recruited by Layton to take his place at Yankee Stadium.

In addition to playing for the Yankees, Layton was the organist for the New York Knicks and the New York Rangers from 1967 to 1985. He also played for several seasons of New York Islanders games in the 1990s and served one stint as organist for the indoor New York Cosmos soccer team at Madison Square Garden.

===Concerts and albums===
Layton also performed concerts in more than 200 cities for the Hammond Organ Company and released 27 albums. In addition, Layton played the organ at Radio City Music Hall for thirty years of Pace University commencements held there. The student union at Pace University&#x27;s New York City campus was named in his honor.

===Hobbies===
Layton loved sailing and owned his own tugboat. He also owned a huge collection of model trains he maintained at his Forest Hills, New York home. He loved demonstrating organs to the public, and giving organ lessons. In 2009, Soapluvva established a YouTube tribute channel to both Layton and Charles Paul, who were colleagues of each other at the CBS Broadcast Center in Manhattan.

==Death==
On December 26, 2004, Layton died of natural causes at his home in Forest Hills, New York, at age 79, following a brief illness. He was buried at Mount Hebron Cemetery in Queens, New York City, with his feet pointed away from Shea Stadium.

==Controversy==
Layton claimed credit as the first to come up with the idea of playing charge calls at a baseball game in 1971. However, Michael Silverbush claims to have made the innovation eight years prior.

In Ken Burns&#x27; 1994 documentary &quot;Baseball&quot;, in a sequence on New York Mets fans in the film&#x27;s eighth installment, Silverbush can be seen briefly playing a trumpet at Shea Stadium in 1969.

<doc id="1333992" wikidata="Q1598200" url="?curid=1333992" title="Metabolic acidosis">
<text>Metabolic acidosis is a serious electrolyte disorder characterized by an imbalance in the body&#x27;s acid-base balance. Metabolic acidosis has three main root causes: increased acid production, loss of bicarbonate, and a reduced ability of the kidneys to excrete excess acids. Metabolic acidosis can lead to acidemia, which is defined as arterial blood pH that is lower than 7.35. Acidemia and acidosis are not mutually exclusive – pH and hydrogen ion concentrations also depend on the coexistence of other acid-base disorders; therefore, pH levels in people with metabolic acidosis can range from low to high.

Acute metabolic acidosis, lasting from minutes to several days, often occurs during serious illnesses or hospitalizations, and is generally caused when the body produces an excess amount of organic acids (ketoacids in ketoacidosis, or lactic acid in lactic acidosis). A state of chronic metabolic acidosis, lasting several weeks to years, can be the result of impaired kidney function (chronic kidney disease) and/or bicarbonate wasting. The adverse effects of acute versus chronic metabolic acidosis also differ, with acute metabolic acidosis impacting the cardiovascular system in hospital settings, and chronic metabolic acidosis affecting muscles, bones, kidney and cardiovascular health.

==Signs and symptoms==

=== Acute metabolic acidosis ===
Symptoms are not specific, and diagnosis can be difficult unless patients present with clear indications for blood gas sampling. Symptoms may include palpitations, headache, altered mental status such as severe anxiety due to hypoxia, decreased visual acuity, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, altered appetite and weight gain, muscle weakness, bone pain, and joint pain. People with acute metabolic acidosis may exhibit deep, rapid breathing called Kussmaul respirations which is classically associated with diabetic ketoacidosis. Rapid deep breaths increase the amount of carbon dioxide exhaled, thus lowering the serum carbon dioxide levels, resulting in some degree of compensation. Overcompensation via respiratory alkalosis to form an alkalemia does not occur.

Extreme acidemia can also lead to neurological and cardiac complications:
* Neurological: lethargy, stupor, coma, seizures
* Cardiac: Abnormal heart rhythms (e.g., ventricular tachycardia) and decreased response to epinephrine, both leading to low blood pressure

Physical examination can occasionally reveal signs of the disease, but is often otherwise normal. Cranial nerve abnormalities are reported in ethylene glycol poisoning, and retinal edema can be a sign of methanol intoxication.

=== Chronic metabolic acidosis ===
Chronic metabolic acidosis has non-specific clinical symptoms but can be readily diagnosed by testing serum bicarbonate levels in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) as part of a comprehensive metabolic panel. Patients with CKD Stages G3–G5 should be routinely screened for metabolic acidosis.

==Diagnostic approach and causes==
Metabolic acidosis results in a reduced serum pH that is due to metabolic and not respiratory dysfunction. Typically the serum bicarbonate concentration will be &lt;22 mEq/L, below the normal range of 22 to 29 mEq/L, the standard base will be more negative than -2 (base deficit) and the pCO2 will be reduced as a result of hyperventilation in an attempt to restore the pH closer to normal. Occasionally in a mixed acid-base disorder where metabolic acidosis is not the primary disorder present, the pH may be normal or high. In the absence of chronic respiratory alkalosis, metabolic acidosis can be clinically diagnosed by analysis of the calculated serum bicarbonate level.

=== Causes ===
Generally, metabolic acidosis occurs when the body produces too much acid (e.g., lactic acidosis, see below section), there is a loss of bicarbonate from the blood, or when the kidneys are not removing enough acid from the body.

Chronic metabolic acidosis is most often caused by a decreased capacity of the kidneys to excrete excess acids through renal ammoniagenesis. The typical Western diet generates 75–100 mEq of acid daily, and individuals with normal kidney function increase the production of ammonia to get rid of this dietary acid. As kidney function declines, the tubules lose the ability to excrete excess acid, and this results in buffering of acid using serum bicarbonate, as well as bone and muscle stores.

There are many causes of acute metabolic acidosis, and thus it is helpful to group them by the presence or absence of a normal anion gap.

Increased anion gap
Causes of increased anion gap include:
* Lactic acidosis
* Ketoacidosis (e.g., Diabetic, alcoholic, or starvation)
* Chronic kidney failure
* 5-oxoprolinemia due to long-term ingestion of high-doses of acetaminophen with glutathione depletion (often seen with sepsis, liver failure, kidney failure, or malnutrition)
* Intoxication:
** Salicylates, methanol, ethylene glycol
** Organic acids, paraldehyde, ethanol, formaldehyde
** Carbon monoxide, cyanide, ibuprofen, metformin
* Propylene glycol (metabolized to L and D-lactate and is often found in infusions for certain intravenous medications used in the intensive care unit)
* Massive rhabdomyolysis
* Isoniazid, iron, phenelzine, tranylcypromine, valproic acid, verapamil
* Topiramate
* Sulfates

Normal anion gap
Causes of normal anion gap include:
* Inorganic acid addition
** Infusion/ingestion of HCl, 
* Gastrointestinal base loss
** Diarrhea
** Small bowel fistula/drainage
** Surgical diversion of urine into gut loops
* Renal base loss/acid retention:
** Proximal renal tubular acidosis
** Distal renal tubular acidosis
* Hyperalimentation
* Addison disease
* Acetazolamide
* Spironolactone
* Saline infusion

To distinguish between the main types of metabolic acidosis, a clinical tool called the anion gap is very useful. The anion gap is calculated by subtracting the sum of the serum concentrations of major anions, chloride and bicarbonate, from the serum concentration of the major cation, sodium. (The serum potassium concentration may be added to the calculation, but this merely changes the normal reference range for what is considered a normal anion gap)
Because the concentration of serum sodium is greater than the combined concentrations of chloride and bicarbonate an &#x27;anion gap&#x27; is noted. In reality serum is electoneutral because of the presence of other minor cations (potassium, calcium and magnesium) and anions (albumin, sulphate and phosphate) that are not measured in the equation that calculates the anion gap.

The normal value for the anion gap is 8–16 mmol/L (12±4). An elevated anion gap (i.e. &gt; 16 mmol/L) indicates the presence of excess &#x27;unmeasured&#x27; anions, such as lactic acid in anaerobic metabolism resulting from tissue hypoxia, glycolic and formic acid produced by the metabolism of toxic alcohols, ketoacids produced when acetyl-CoA undergoes ketogenesis rather than entering the tricarboxylic (Krebs) cycle, and failure of renal excretion of products of metabolism such as sulphates and phosphates.

Adjunctive tests are useful in determining the aetiology of a raised anion gap metabolic acidosis including detection of an osmolar gap indicative of the presence of a toxic alcohol, measurement of serum ketones indicative of ketoacidosis and renal function tests and urinanalysis to detect renal dysfunction.

Elevated protein (albumin, globulins) may theoretically increase the anion gap but high levels are not usually encountered clinically. Hypoalbuminaemia, which is frequently encountered clinically, will &quot;mask&quot; an anion gap. As a rule of thumb, a decrease in serum albumin by 1 G/L will decrease the anion gap by 0.25 mmol/L

==Pathophysiology==

===Compensatory mechanisms===
Metabolic acidosis is characterized by a low concentration of bicarbonate (), which can happen with increased generation of acids (such as ketoacids or lactic acid), excess loss of by the kidneys or gastrointestinal tract, or an inability to generate sufficient . Thus demonstrating the importance of maintaining balance between acids and bases in the body for maintaining optimal functioning of organs, tissues and cells.

The body regulates the acidity of the blood by four buffering mechanisms.
* Bicarbonate buffering system
* Intracellular buffering by absorption of hydrogen atoms by various molecules, including proteins, phosphates and carbonate in bone.
* Respiratory compensation. Hyperventilation will cause more carbon dioxide to be removed from the body and thereby increases pH.
* Kidney compensation

===Buffer===
The decreased bicarbonate that distinguishes metabolic acidosis is therefore due to two separate processes: the buffer (from water and carbon dioxide) and additional renal generation. The buffer reactions are: &lt;chem display=block&gt;H+ + HCO3- &lt;=&gt; H2CO3 &lt;=&gt; CO2 + H2O&lt;/chem&gt;

The Henderson–Hasselbalch equation mathematically describes the relationship between blood pH and the components of the bicarbonate buffering system: formula_1 where . In clinical practice, the concentration is usually determined via Henry&#x27;s law from , the partial pressure in arterial blood: formula_2 

For example, blood gas machines usually determine bicarbonate concentrations from measured &quot;p&quot;H and values. Mathematically, the algorithm substitutes the Henry&#x27;s law formula into the Henderson-Hasselbach equation and then rearranges: formula_3 At sea level, normal numbers might be and ; these then imply formula_4

== Consequences ==

=== Acute metabolic acidosis ===
Acute metabolic acidosis most often occurs during hospitalizations, and acute critical illnesses. It is often associated with poor prognosis, with a mortality rate as high as 57% if the pH remains untreated at 7.20. At lower pH levels, acute metabolic acidosis can lead to impaired circulation and end organ function.

=== Chronic metabolic acidosis ===
Chronic metabolic acidosis commonly occurs in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) with an eGFR of less than 45 ml/min/1.73m2, most often with mild to moderate severity; however, metabolic acidosis can manifest earlier on in the course of CKD. Multiple animal and human studies have shown that metabolic acidosis in CKD, given its chronic nature, has a profound adverse impact on cellular function, overall contributing to high morbidities in patients.

The most adverse consequences of chronic metabolic acidosis in people with CKD, and in particular, for those who have end-stage renal disease (ESRD), are detrimental changes to the bones and muscles. Acid buffering leads to loss of bone density, resulting in an increased risk of bone fractures, renal osteodystrophy, and bone disease; as well, increased protein catabolism leads to muscle wasting. Furthermore, metabolic acidosis in CKD is also associated with a reduction in eGFR; it is both a complication of CKD, as well as an underlying cause of CKD progression.

==Treatment==
Treatment of metabolic acidosis depends on the underlying cause, and should target reversing the main process. When considering course of treatment, it is important to distinguish between acute versus chronic forms.

=== Acute metabolic acidosis ===
Bicarbonate therapy is generally administered In patients with severe acute acidemia (pH &lt; 7.11), or with less severe acidemia (pH 7.1–7.2) who have severe acute kidney injury. Bicarbonate therapy is not recommended for people with less severe acidosis (pH ≥ 7.1), unless severe acute kidney injury is present. In the BICAR-ICU trial, bicarbonate therapy for maintaining a pH &gt;7.3 had no overall effect on the composite outcome of all-cause mortality and the presence of at least one organ failure at day 7. However, amongst the sub-group of patients with severe acute kidney injury, bicarbonate therapy significantly decreased the primary composite outcome, and 28-day mortality, along with the need for dialysis.

=== Chronic metabolic acidosis ===
For people with chronic kidney disease (CKD), treating metabolic acidosis slows the progression of CKD. Dietary interventions for treatment of chronic metabolic acidosis include base-inducing fruits and vegetables that assist with reducing the urine net acid excretion, and increase TCO2. Recent research has also suggested that dietary protein restriction, through ketoanalogue-supplemented vegetarian very low protein diets are also a nutritionally safe option for correction of metabolic acidosis in people with CKD.

Currently, the most commonly used treatment for chronic metabolic acidosis is oral bicarbonate. The NKF/KDOQI guidelines recommend starting treatment when serum bicarbonate levels are &lt;22 mEq/L, in order to maintain levels ≥ 22 mEq/L. Studies investigating the effects of oral alkali therapy demonstrated improvements in serum bicarbonate levels, resulting in a slower decline in kidney function, and reduction in proteinuria – leading to a reduction in the risk of progressing to kidney failure. However, side effects of oral alkali therapy include gastrointestinal intolerance, worsening edema, and worsening hypertension. Furthermore, large doses of oral alkali are required to treat chronic metabolic acidosis, and the pill burden can limit adherence.

Veverimer (TRC 101) is a promising investigational drug designed to treat metabolic acidosis by binding with the acid in the gastrointestinal tract and removing it from the body through excretion in the feces, in turn decreasing the amount of acid in the body, and increasing the level of bicarbonate in the blood. Results from a Phase 3, double-blind placebo-controlled 12-week clinical trial in people with CKD and metabolic acidosis demonstrated that Veverimer effectively and safely corrected metabolic acidosis in the short-term, and a blinded, placebo-controlled, 40-week extension of the trial assessing long-term safety, demonstrated sustained improvements in physical function and a combined endpoint of death, dialysis, or 50% decline in eGFR.

<text>The Best of Both Worlds is a two-disc compilation album by British neo-prog band Marillion released in 1997 by EMI Records, who the band had been signed to from their debut in 1982 until being dropped in 1995. The title refers to Marillion&#x27;s two distinct &quot;eras&quot; with lead singers Fish (1980–1988) and Steve Hogarth (since 1989). By the time this compilation was released, both line-ups had recorded four studio albums each.

==Content==
The second Marillion best-of since the 14-track one-disc compilation &quot;A Singles Collection&quot; (known as &quot;Six of One, Half a Dozen of the Other &quot;in the US) from 1992, this one additionally contains material from &quot;Brave &quot;(1994) and &quot;Afraid of Sunlight&quot; (1996). Two different covers were created for the compilation, one by Mark Wilkinson, who had worked for the band during the Fish years, and one by Bill Smith Studio, who took over after Fish&#x27;s and Wilkinson&#x27;s departure. The booklet was printed so that either of the covers could be displayed in the jewel case according to personal preference. The track list, comprising 29 songs, was put together by Lucy Jordache, then the manager responsible for the band in EMI, in close collaboration with the band&#x27;s fans&#x27; mailing list, &quot;Freaks&quot; (named after the eponymous song). Jordache also motivated singers Fish and Hogarth to contribute liner notes—at a time when both camps were not yet on friendly terms again—by telling each of them the other had already agreed to do so.

Although the compilation did not contain any previously unreleased material, it was attractive to existing fans as it included various edited versions that were not easily accessible at the time, resulting in &quot;better than expected&quot; sales.

<doc id="1334006" wikidata="Q325368" url="?curid=1334006" title="Wenlock Edge">
<text>Wenlock Edge is a limestone escarpment near Much Wenlock, Shropshire, England and a site of special scientific interest because of its geology. It is over long, running southwest to northeast between Craven Arms and Much Wenlock, and is roughly 1,083 feet above sea level. The deciduous woodland which runs along it covers much of the steep slopes of the escarpment and in parts it is very well preserved.

It was featured on the 2005 TV programme &quot;Seven Natural Wonders&quot; as one of the wonders of the Midlands.

Wenlock Edge contains many interesting features such as Flounders&#x27; Folly, Wilderhope Manor and Shipton Hall and waymarked walks such as the Shropshire Way and bridleways such as the Jack Mytton Way. It is a popular area for hillwalking, cycling, mountain biking and horseriding and is also frequented by tourists and sightseers.

Robert Hart created a model forest garden from a small orchard on his farm called Highwood Hill in Wenlock Edge.

==Geology==

The &quot;world famous Wenlock Limestone outcrops&quot; are amongst &quot;Britain’s most important geological sites&quot;. The limestone quarries in the North &quot;demonstrate the best examples of reef development during the Silurian Period in Britain.&quot; Many species of brachiopods, trilobites and ostracod (microscopic crustaceans) were first found at Wenlock and most of the known Wenlock group Silurian fauna comes from here.
Richard Corfield also gave Wenlock Edge as an example of the most spectacular reef building the world has ever known.
The reef was formed in shallow subtropical seas about 425 million years ago when the area was south of the equator at about the same latitude as the Seychelles is today.
A walk by a BBC journalist in 2008 found abundant fossilised crinoids (sea lilies) and brachiopods. The Wenlock Epoch of the Silurian Period is named for the rocks of Wenlock Edge.

== Legends==

Ippikin

Local legend tells of a local robber and bandit named Ippikin, who buried his ill-gotten gains in the vicinity of the edge. Tales tell that should anyone stand on the escarpment and say &quot;Ippikin, Ippikin, keep away with your long chin&quot; that they will be pushed over the edge by the ghost of the erstwhile villain.

Major&#x27;s Leap

In the English Civil War a Major Thomas Smallman of nearby Wilderhope Manor was a Royalist officer who was forced to flee from Cromwell&#x27;s approaching troops after escaping from his manor. As he was carrying important dispatches, he was cornered on the Wenlock Edge. Rather than surrender, he galloped his horse off the edge falling some 200 feet. His horse was killed but the Major was saved by falling into an apple tree. He made his way on foot to Shrewsbury where he delivered the despatches. The area where he made the jump is known as Major&#x27;s Leap and is said to be haunted by the Major and his horse.

==Transport==
===Rail===
Served by Transport for Wales on the Welsh Marches Line and Heart of Wales Line at Church Stretton and Craven Arms.

===Bus===
2012 saw the introduction of a Shropshire Hills Shuttle service that operates at weekends and on bank holidays during the spring and summer. The route, called the &quot;Wenlock Wanderer&quot;, connects the towns of Much Wenlock and Church Stretton, and operates mostly along the B4371 which runs atop the Wenlock Edge. It also calls at Ticklerton, Acton Scott and Marshbrook to the south of Church Stretton. The Shrewsbury road down Wenlock Hill is one of the steepest main roads in the United Kingdom, with a gradient of 1 in 6.

==Cultural references==
It is the setting for A. E. Housman&#x27;s poem &quot;On Wenlock Edge the Wood&#x27;s in Trouble&quot;, poem XXXI in his 1896 collection &quot;A Shropshire Lad&quot;. In 1909, Ralph Vaughan Williams composed a song cycle called &quot;On Wenlock Edge&quot;, which comprises settings of that and five other Housman poems. It is also the subject of several works by the famous artist L. S. Lowry, with his piece &quot;A Bit of Wenlock Edge&quot;, which is a fine pencil drawing of the escarpment, detailing the woodland. Housman&#x27;s poem, in turn, is at the centre of a discussion in Alice Munro&#x27;s short story &quot;Wenlock Edge&quot;.

In his alternate history novel &quot;SS-GB&quot;, set in a German-occupied Great Britain during World War II, Len Deighton places a Gestapo concentration camp in Wenlock Edge.

<text>The Toyota U engine is a series of flat engines produced by Toyota. The original version of this engine was produced in the 1960s and 1970s in flat-twin configuration. The engine series was extended in 2012 for the engine derived from the Subaru flat-four for the Toyota 86.

==U==

The 697 cc U was produced from 1961 through 1966. The power was increased from from engine number U-184170 onwards. It was exclusively installed in the Toyota Publica family of vehicles.

==2U==

The 790 cc, 2U was produced from 1965 through 1969, while the similar 2U-B was produced from 1966 through 1976. Output for the 2U-B when fitted to the Publica is at 5,400 rpm. When installed in the Toyota MiniAce (UP100) minitruck and bus series, the engine only produces at 4,600 rpm. This version has an 8.2:1 compression ratio. The 2U-C used in some models of the Publica 20 series produced at 5,000 rpm. It was also installed in the Publica-derived sports car, called the Toyota Sports 800.

==4U==


Appearing in the Toyota 86 (also known as the Toyota GT 86 in Europe, Scion FR-S in the US and Subaru BRZ), the 4U-GSE is a boxer type engine with four cylinders and a bore and stroke of . The engine is a Subaru designed-and-built flat-four engine called the FA20D, with a Toyota engine code. The engine is built at Subaru&#x27;s Oizumi Plant in Ota, Gunma. It features Toyota&#x27;s D4-S direct and port injection systems, with a maximum power rating of at 7000 rpm and a maximum torque rating of at 6600 rpm. The compression ratio is 12.5:1. In 2016, for the 2017 model year, power was increased to when equipped with a manual transmission.

The 4U-GSE was discontinued in 2021, following the introduction of the second-generation Toyota 86 (also known as the Toyota GR86) and Subaru BRZ, which uses a 2.4-liter FA24D. Unlike the FA20, it does not use a Toyota engine code.

<text>This Strange Engine is the ninth studio album by the British neo-prog band Marillion, released in April 1997 by the Castle Communications imprint Raw Power. It was the first of the three recordings that Marillion made under contract with Castle, after being dropped by EMI Records in 1995 and before eventually going independent in 2000. The album was recorded at The Racket Club in Buckinghamshire, England, between August and November 1996 and was produced by the band themselves.

==Background==

Without promotional efforts of a major record label, &quot;This Strange Engine&quot; continued the decline in mainstream success for Marillion, reaching only number 27 in the UK Albums Chart and staying there for three weeks. It sold significantly better in the Netherlands, home of one of the band&#x27;s most loyal audiences, peaking at number 10 on the charts. Two singles from the album were released: &quot;Man of a Thousand Faces&quot; and &quot;Eighty Days&quot;. For the first time in the band&#x27;s history, no song cracked the UK Top 40; the first single reached number 98 and the second one failed to chart at all.

The fourth track, &quot;Estonia&quot;, was written after singer Steve Hogarth met Paul Barney, the only British survivor of the sinking of the cruise ferry &quot;Estonia&quot; in the Baltic Sea on 28 September 1994, which killed 852 people. This is the only song of Marillion to feature a balalaika.

The title track is a tribute by Steve Hogarth to his father, a marine engineer and an officer. The senior Hogarth sacrificed his life at sea for a job in a coal mine so that he could be close to his family.

On European editions, following the last track, at approximately 29:35, there is a hidden track of Hogarth giggling uncontrollably, recorded on his return to the studio after a night on the town.

A remix of the album, &quot;Tales from the Engine Room&quot;, conducted by the electronic music project Positive Light, was first released as a limited edition January 1998 on Racket Records, and in June 1998 it was released worldwide by Eagle Records.

<doc id="1334036" wikidata="Q2145935" url="?curid=1334036" title="Respiratory acidosis">
<text>Respiratory acidosis is a state in which decreased ventilation (hypoventilation) increases the concentration of carbon dioxide in the blood and decreases the blood&#x27;s pH (a condition generally called acidosis).

Carbon dioxide is produced continuously as the body&#x27;s cells respire, and this will accumulate rapidly if the lungs do not adequately expel it through alveolar ventilation. Alveolar hypoventilation thus leads to an increased (a condition called hypercapnia). The increase in in turn decreases the ratio and decreases pH.

== Types ==
Respiratory acidosis can be acute or chronic.
* In &quot;acute respiratory acidosis&quot;, the &quot;Pa&quot;CO2 is elevated above the upper limit of the reference range (over 6.3 kPa or 45 mm Hg) with an accompanying acidemia (pH &lt;7.35).
* In &quot;chronic respiratory acidosis&quot;, the &quot;Pa&quot;CO2 is elevated above the upper limit of the reference range, with a normal blood pH (7.35 to 7.45) or near-normal pH secondary to renal compensation and an elevated serum bicarbonate (HCO3− &gt;30 mEq/L).

== Causes ==

===Acute===
Acute respiratory acidosis occurs when an abrupt failure of ventilation occurs. This failure in ventilation may be caused by depression of the central respiratory center by cerebral disease or drugs, inability to ventilate adequately due to neuromuscular disease (e.g., myasthenia gravis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Guillain–Barré syndrome, muscular dystrophy), or airway obstruction related to asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation.

===Chronic===
Chronic respiratory acidosis may be secondary to many disorders, including COPD. Hypoventilation in COPD involves multiple mechanisms, including decreased responsiveness to hypoxia and hypercapnia, increased ventilation-perfusion mismatch leading to increased dead space ventilation, and decreased diaphragm function secondary to fatigue and hyperinflation.

Chronic respiratory acidosis also may be secondary to obesity hypoventilation syndrome (i.e., Pickwickian syndrome), neuromuscular disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and severe restrictive ventilatory defects as observed in interstitial lung disease and thoracic deformities.

Lung diseases that primarily cause abnormality in alveolar gas exchange usually do not cause hypoventilation but tend to cause stimulation of ventilation and hypocapnia secondary to hypoxia. Hypercapnia only occurs if severe disease or respiratory muscle fatigue occurs.

== Physiological response ==

===Mechanism===
Metabolism rapidly generates a large quantity of volatile acid (H2CO3) and nonvolatile acid. The metabolism of fats and carbohydrates leads to the formation of a large amount of CO2. The CO2 combines with H2O to form carbonic acid (H2CO3). The lungs normally excrete the volatile fraction through ventilation, and acid accumulation does not occur. A significant alteration in ventilation that affects elimination of CO2 can cause a respiratory acid-base disorder. The &quot;Pa&quot;CO2 is maintained within a range of 35–45 mm Hg in normal states.

Alveolar ventilation is under the control of the respiratory center, which is located in the pons and the medulla. Ventilation is influenced and regulated by chemoreceptors for &quot;Pa&quot;CO2, PaO2, and pH located in the brainstem, and in the aortic and carotid bodies as well as by neural impulses from lung stretch receptors and impulses from the cerebral cortex. Failure of ventilation quickly increases the &quot;Pa&quot;CO2.

In acute respiratory acidosis, compensation occurs in 2 steps.
* The initial response is cellular buffering (plasma protein buffers) that occurs over minutes to hours. Cellular buffering elevates plasma bicarbonate (HCO3−) only slightly, approximately 1 mEq/L for each 10-mm Hg increase in &quot;Pa&quot;CO2.
* The second step is renal compensation that occurs over 3–5 days. With renal compensation, renal excretion of carbonic acid is increased and bicarbonate reabsorption is increased. For instance, PEPCK is upregulated in renal proximal tubule brush border cells, in order to secrete more NH3 and thus to produce more HCO3−.

===Estimated changes===
In renal compensation, plasma bicarbonate rises 3.5 mEq/L for each increase of 10 mm Hg in &quot;Pa&quot;CO2. The expected change in serum bicarbonate concentration in respiratory acidosis can be estimated as follows:
* Acute respiratory acidosis: HCO3− increases 1 mEq/L for each 10 mm Hg rise in &quot;Pa&quot;CO2.
* Chronic respiratory acidosis: HCO3− rises 3.5 mEq/L for each 10 mm Hg rise in &quot;Pa&quot;CO2.

The expected change in pH with respiratory acidosis can be estimated with the following equations:
* Acute respiratory acidosis: Change in pH = 0.08 X ((40 − &quot;Pa&quot;CO2)/10)
* Chronic respiratory acidosis: Change in pH = 0.03 X ((40 − &quot;Pa&quot;CO2)/10)

Respiratory acidosis does not have a great effect on electrolyte levels. Some small effects occur on calcium and potassium levels. Acidosis decreases binding of calcium to albumin and tends to increase serum ionized calcium levels. In addition, acidemia causes an extracellular shift of potassium, but respiratory acidosis rarely causes clinically significant hyperkalemia.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnoses can be done by doing an ABG (Arterial Blood Gas) laboratory study, with a pH &lt;7.35 and a PaCO2 &gt;45 mmHg in an acute setting. Patients with COPD and other Chronic respiratory diseases will sometimes display higher level of PaCO2 with HCO3- &gt;30 and normal pH.

==Terminology==
* Acidosis refers to disorders that lower cell/tissue pH to &lt; 7.35.
* Acidemia refers to an arterial pH &lt; 7.36.

<text>Candlewood Lake is a manmade lake located in Fairfield and Litchfield counties of Western Connecticut, in the northeastern United States. At , it is the largest lake in Connecticut and the largest lake in the New York Metropolitan Area. The lake is bordered by the city of Danbury, and the towns of Brookfield, New Fairfield, New Milford, and Sherman. Some of the most expensive real estate in the Greater Danbury area is located along the shores of the lake.

==Creation==

===Concept===

On July 15, 1926, Connecticut Light and Power Company&#x27;s board of directors approved a plan to create the first large-scale operation of pumped storage facilities in the US. By creating the lake and pumping it full of water from the Housatonic River, then letting the water pour down the penstock and into a turbine, the utility could produce electricity.

Candlewood Lake was formed behind a hydroelectric dam south of the Rocky River&#x27;s junction with the Housatonic River in New Milford. Similar to a giant battery, its main purpose is to store water during periods of low electrical demand for power generation when demand is high. Excess electricity from the valley&#x27;s hydro-system is used to pump water up a hillside into the lake from the nearby Housatonic River during spring, and overnight hours in summer. The water is then allowed to flow back down into the river when extra electricity is needed in the grid, often during the region&#x27;s mid-to-late summer heat waves. Power is generated by turbines that are spun by the water flowing into the river while pumping is done by reversing the impellers.

===Construction===

Within a few weeks of the decision to move ahead, 50 surveyors began to scout the valley, and lawyers were hired to process the deeds transferring land held by some families since before the American Revolution into the hands of CL&amp;P. The utility had the power of eminent domain and so some of the farmers sold their land - $2,356 for , $3,000 for , $100 for . Some of the families refused to sell so their land was taken and flooded. Inhabitants were relocated, but many of the buildings were left standing and some farming equipment was left behind. The roads were not torn up before the valley was flooded. A small cemetery in the area where the lake was built was relocated.

Starting in late July 1926, nearly 1,400 men labored to create Connecticut&#x27;s largest body of water. About 500 men from Maine and Canada hand-felled of woodland, burning the lumber in massive bonfires. Several dams were built. The largest, at the north end of the valley, measured wide and high upon completion.

On February 25, 1928, the first pumping operation began pouring water into the valley from the Housatonic. Engineers had planned on the Rocky River and its tributaries filling the valley one-fourth of the way, with the generating plant pumping the remaining three-fourths of the water out of the Housatonic. The valley filled quickly; on September 29, 1928, the water reached an elevation of above sea level, and Candlewood Lake was considered completed.

CL&amp;P owned and operated the lake and hydroelectric power facilities until it was sold for $9 million in June 2006 due to deregulation of the electric power industry by the State in the late 1990s. The lake and generation plant are currently owned by FirstLight Power Resources.

==Recreation==
Candlewood Lake is a popular tourist destination, and the area is home to many second homes of New York City residents. The lake is used for recreation year-round, although tourists primarily come during the summer months for swimming, fishing, boating, and golfing. Along its approximately shoreline are tourist resorts and recreational facilities, including golf courses, beaches, and marinas.

There is a daytime speed limit for boats and a nighttime speed limit from 1/2 hour after sunset to 1/2 hour before sunrise. A speed limit is in effect within of shore, dock, moored vessels, and other places that the power company has marked as hazardous. Seaplanes are also permitted to land on the lake.

The lake is around deep in most places, with some deeper areas that are . Scuba divers can investigate buildings from the era before the lake was created, follow underwater roads, and discover artifacts. Some of the notable underwater finds are Model Ts, plane wreckage from small craft that have hit the lake since then, and covered bridges.

Candlewood Lake is home to Chicken Rock, a large rock from which people jump into the water. There is also a rope swing that allows people to swing out over the water. The rock is high. It projects into the lake from the shore on the Sherman side of the New Fairfield-Sherman border; it is the site of frequent injuries.

Candlewood Lake is home to many private beaches, such as Lynn Deming Park, Millstone Ridge, Candlewood Lake Club, and Sail Harbour Club.
==Environmental preservation==
The lake has an ongoing problem with the growth of eelgrass and Eurasian milfoil in shallower areas. Because of the silt kicked up by boats and the problem with water weeds and algae, the visibility in the lake is from .

The level of the lake usually is lowered by over the winter in an attempt to freeze weeds. Attempts have been made to trim them with mechanical cutters on barges; this has had limited success. Various chemical and biological methods have been considered, tested and/or employed to fight the weeds. In December 2006, the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection, working with members of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency treated Candlewood Lake for its eelgrass and algae issues with an organic phosphate. Grass-eating weevils were tested in 2008 and 2010, and grass-eating carp were introduced in 2015.

In October 2016, zebra mussels were found on the Rocky River power station for the first time, reinforcing fears that the harmful invasive species will eventually make its way into the lake itself.

== History ==

A small village, Jerusalem, was submerged in the rising waters.

Even before the lake&#x27;s filling was completed, it became apparent it would draw summer vacationers from as far away as New York City. Land prices on what would become the shoreline had already jumped to $1,000 an acre; summer developments appeared almost immediately.

Although it was almost called Lake Danbury, the new body of water ultimately got its name from New Milford&#x27;s Candlewood Mountain, which was named after the Candlewood tree (&quot;Pinus rigida&quot;), whose sapling branches were sometimes used as candles by early settlers.

=== Islands ===
There are 12 islands on Candlewood Lake:
*Green Island
*Deer Island
*Cedar Island
*Oak Island
*Rock Island
*Pine Island
*Sand Island
*Shipwreck Island
*Skeleton Island
*Thistle Island
*Banger Islands
*City Island
