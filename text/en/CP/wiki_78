<text>T in the Park festival was a major Scottish music festival that was held annually from 1994 to 2016. It was named after its main sponsor, Tennents. The event was held at Strathclyde Park, Lanarkshire, until 1996. It then moved to the disused Balado airfield, Perth and Kinross, from 1997 to 2014. In 2015 the festival moved to Strathallan Castle. It was originally held over two days, and extended to three days from 2007. In 2016 the daily capacity was 70,000.

The 2017 T in the Park was cancelled due to problems at the 2016 event. It was officially replaced with the TRNSMT festival which takes place on the same weekend at Glasgow Green. The 2017 festival was a success and further editions of TRNSMT followed in 2018 and 2019. In July 2019, the festival organiser, Geoff Ellis, confirmed that T in the Park would not be returning.

==History==
The festival was founded in 1994 by Stuart Clumpas and Geoff Ellis, as part of a joint venture between DF Concerts and Tennent&#x27;s Lager with some help from Irish promotions company MCD Productions. Stuart Clumpas left as an organiser in 2001, selling his commercial interests in the concert.

Festival director Geoff Ellis was involved from the start until the end. Ellis came to Scotland in 1992 to manage King Tut&#x27;s Wah Wah Hut in Glasgow. He organised the first T in the Park festival in 1994 with a smattering of bands playing to 17,000 people at its original site at Strathclyde Park, Lanarkshire. The festival was held there for three years until 1997, where it was held at the disused Balado airfield, Perth and Kinross. After moving to Balado the festival grew larger and by 2003, the festival was attracting up to 255,000 people; 110,000 over the weekend.

The festival was originally a two-day event until 2007, when the Friday became a mainstay event for live music. However, the 2007 festival was criticised by many festival-goers who missed acts on the Friday due to huge traffic jams of 10 miles on the A91 and A977 leading to Kinross. To prevent a repeat of the traffic chaos, in 2008 organisers allowed a limited number of campers to pitch up on the Thursday in order to cut the number of cars on the roads on the Friday. By extending the festival over a full three days, it began to grow rapidly, becoming the second-largest greenfield festival in the United Kingdom, and the fifth-largest in the world in terms of attendance, with over 85,000 people on site every day.
In 2013 it attracted up to 255,000 people over three days, drawing fans from across Britain and Europe. According to DF Concerts, 20% of the crowd was made up of visitors from outside Scotland, with about 2% attending from overseas. In later years the festival shared much of its line-up with Oxegen, a festival that takes place on the same weekend in County Kildare, Ireland. Acts usually played T in the Park one day and Oxegen the next, or vice versa. In an attempt to boost ticket sales, the 2014 festival saw an extension of the acts&#x27; duration on stage. On the Friday, the acts were scheduled to start around lunchtime as opposed to 5 pm; and the Saturday headliners to finish at 1 am.

===Move from Balado to Strathallan===
The 2014 festival was the last to take place at the Balado site. Despite having run on the same site since 1997, safety concerns were expressed about the Forties Pipeline, which runs directly underneath the former Balado airfield.

In 2015 the festival moved 20.54 miles to the Strathallan Castle Estate. The 2016 event was marred by the deaths of three festival-goers and reports of anti-social behaviour problems at the campsite. This led festival bosses to cancel the 2017 event and, ultimately, all future T in the Park festivals.

===Brewing===
Tennents Lager for the T in the Park weekend was specially brewed 36 hours before the festival at the Wellpark Brewery in Glasgow, 44 miles from Balado. More than 3 million pints of lager were consumed at the festival during its existence.

A container recycling scheme was introduced in 2006, refunding a 10p deposit on every pint container brought back to a designated recycling point.

==1994 festival==
The first T in the Park was held on Saturday 30 July – Sunday 31 July 1994 at Strathclyde Country Park. The site had a capacity for 17,000 people on each of the two days, with just 2000 choosing to camp.

This was also the year that Keanu Reeves arrived on a shuttle bus to play the festival with his band Dogstar, and Joe Strummer busked in the campsite

==2014 festival==

Sheffield rockers, Arctic Monkeys were announced first as headline act and closed the festival on Sunday, with Scotland&#x27;s Biffy Clyro and Calvin Harris headlining Friday and Saturday. Other acts on the bill include Pixies, Ed Sheeran, Paolo Nutini, Paul Weller, The Human League, Pharrell Williams, Ellie Goulding, Tinie Tempah, Franz Ferdinand, Elbow, James and Charlotte OC.

The first headline act to be announced were The Libertines and shortly after other headliners Kasabian and Noel Gallagher&#x27;s High Flying Birds, along with other acts including Jessie J, Avicii, Hozier, Sam Smith, The Vaccines, and Twin Atlantic. There has been a lot of negative feedback and media attention regarding the new site, with travel delays being a major issue due to the lack of trackway in grass car parks and drop off areas.

The post garnered thousands of reposts and hundreds of likes overnight. On 8 January, a spokesperson for DF Concerts, organisers of the event, told the BBC that &quot;the profile is fake and is in no way associated with T in the Park&quot;. The company&#x27;s CEO, Geoff Ellis, previously commented that the festival would never return, and that it &quot;ran its course&quot;.

Fields, Mort Sahl, Lenny Bruce, and Woody Allen; his latest, &quot;Kurt Vonnegut: Unstuck in Time&quot; (2021), explores the life and works of Kurt Vonnegut.

Weide has received an Academy Award nomination and Primetime Emmy Award win for &quot;Lenny Bruce: Swear to Tell the Truth&quot; (1999). He also received Emmy Awards for &quot;W. C. Fields: Head Up&quot; (1986), and &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;.

== Early work and education ==
Weide began working with film at an early job inspecting 16 mm educational films at the Fullerton Public Library in Orange County, California.

In 1978, while taking film production courses at Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa, California, Weide decided to produce a documentary film on the Marx Brothers, inspired by his love of their work. Undeterred by repeated rejections of his applications to the USC School of Cinema-Television, he worked on the project on his own time and with help from Charles H. Joffe got the rights to clips necessary to make the film. &quot;The Marx Brothers in a Nutshell&quot; was broadcast in 1982 on PBS and became &quot;one of the highest-rated programs in PBS history&quot;.

== Career ==
===&quot;W. C. Fields: Straight Up&quot; (1986)===

Weide co-wrote &quot;W. C. Fields: Straight Up&quot; (1986) with Joseph Adamson and Ronald J. Fields. Adamson directed it, and Dudley Moore narrated. In an interview with &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot;, Weide said: &quot;The film is 94 minutes long. We had access to all of his feature films, and clips from 1915 on. We have newsreel footage, outtakes, and material never seen before. We also have interviews with people who knew and/or worked with Fields, or have special knowledge of him, including Joseph L. Mankiewicz, Will Fowler, Madge Kennedy, who played in the 1923 stage production of ‘Poppy’ and co-starred in the movie, Leonard Maltin, Ronald J. Fields, propman Harry Caplan and an audio interview with the grown-up Baby Leroy.&quot;

===&quot;Mort Sahl: The Loyal Opposition&quot; (1989)===

Weide&#x27;s next project concerned the career of Mort Sahl. The project was part of the American Masters documentary series, which originally ran on PBS in 1989.

===&quot;Lenny Bruce: Swear to Tell the Truth&quot; (1998)===

In 1998, Weide directed the documentary &quot;Swear to Tell the Truth&quot;, which received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Documentary. Robert De Niro narrated it, and it featured interviews with Bruce&#x27;s ex-wife Honey, mother Sally Marr and former TV host Steve Allen, who had Bruce on his show a few times. The film debuted on HBO.

===&quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;===

From 2000 to 2005, Weide served as principal director and an executive producer of Larry David&#x27;s HBO comedy series &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;. He became involved in the series after receiving a script by David titled &quot;Prognosis Negative&quot;. In 1998 David told Weide that HBO was interested in doing a comedy special about David&#x27;s return to stand-up—&quot;ostensibly a documentary with some behind-the-scenes footage. And he told me he wanted me to direct it.&quot; The special turned out to be the beginning of the series. Since then David and Weide have often collaborated, with Weide serving as a director and executive producer. Weide returned with the show in 2007, directing &quot;The Anonymous Donor&quot;, and has continued to guest direct since.

Weide received several Primetime Emmy Award nominations for his work on the show, and won an Emmy in 2003 for his work as director during its third season. His ending credit on the show has become part of an internet meme.

===&quot;How to Lose Friends &amp; Alienate People&quot;===

Weide&#x27;s first feature film as director, &quot;How to Lose Friends &amp; Alienate People&quot;, was released in October 2008, to generally unfavorable reviews, though it topped the United Kingdom&#x27;s box office during its opening weekend.

===&quot;Woody Allen: A Documentary&quot; (2011)===

Weide&#x27;s next documentary, &quot;Woody Allen: A Documentary&quot;, explored the career of filmmaker and comedian Woody Allen as part of PBS&#x27;s American Masters series. The film takes a look at Allen&#x27;s nearly seven-decade career as a director and comedian. It features interviews with Allen, Diane Keaton, Scarlett Johansson, Martin Scorsese, Chris Rock, Owen Wilson, Larry David, Penelope Cruz, and Leonard Maltin. It received favorable reviews, earning a 90% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 21 reviews. The website&#x27;s critical consensus states: &quot;Driving aside the most polemical aspects of the director&#x27;s biography, &quot;Woody Allen: A Documentary&quot; draws an interesting picture of the filmmaker&#x27;s opus while allowing some glimpses of his intense personal life.&quot; &quot;The New Yorker&quot; critic Richard Brody wrote: &quot;It&#x27;s a close look at how Allen&#x27;s career was shaped, from his Brooklyn youth to his precocious launch as a comedy writer, his rise to local fame as a standup comedian and to national celebrity on television, his move from screenwriter to director of the &#x27;early, funny&#x27; films to internationally lionized auteur to pariah and, gradually, back again.&quot;

Weide was the director and main writer for &quot;Mr. Sloane&quot;, a 2014 British comedy series.

==Work with Kurt Vonnegut==

Weide wrote and produced the 1996 film adaptation of Kurt Vonnegut&#x27;s &quot;Mother Night&quot;. With Vonnegut&#x27;s support, Weide chronicled him on film starting in 1988 and has obtained footage of him from 16 mm home movies dating back to 1925. Weide was also working on a film adaptation of &quot;The Sirens of Titan&quot; until the film rights were sold to another producer.

Writing under the pseudonym &quot;Wyaduck&quot; (a Marx Brothers reference), Weide was a frequent poster to Usenet group alt.books.kurt-vonnegut, where he reported on the progress of the &quot;Mother Night&quot; project. He was mentioned in Vonnegut&#x27;s &quot;Timequake&quot;.

In 2001, Weide directed a revival of Vonnegut&#x27;s play &quot;Happy Birthday, Wanda June&quot; starring his wife, Linda Bates, as Penelope.

<doc id="1345813" wikidata="Q921706" url="?curid=1345813" title="Bhakri">
<text>Bhakri () is a round flatbread often eaten in the cuisines of the states of Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan, and Karnataka in India. Bhakri is prepared using jowar or bajra, which is coarser than a regular wheat chapati.
Bhakri can be either soft or hard in texture, unlike khakhra in respect to hardness.

==Grains and variants==
Different types of millets (jowar, bajra, ragi) are the common grains used for making bhakris. These millet bhakris are popular in the Deccan plateau regions of India (Maharashtra and Northern Karnataka) as well as the semi-arid regions of Rajasthan. In the coastal Konkan and Goa regions of western India rice flour is used for making bhakri.
# Jowar bhakri – Jowar bhakris are the most common type of bhakri. The dough is prepared by mixing jowar flour with hot water and then flattened by hand.
# Bajra bhakri – Bajra bhakris are mainly prepared in winter, especially near the festival of Sankranti. The preparation is similar to jowar bhakris. 
# Makai bhakri – Cornmeal bhakris are commonly prepared during winters. Also known by the name &quot;&quot;Makai No Rotlo&quot; in Gujarati and &quot;Makyachi Bhakri&quot;&quot; in Marathi. 
# Ragi bhakri – Ragi bhakhris, or ragi rottis, are made of red finger millets. They are prepared similarly to other bhakris.
# Rice bhakri – Rice bhakhris are made of rice flour, prepared similarly to other bhakris. They are common in the Konkan region.
# Wheat Bhakri – Wheat bhakris are like wheat rotis, but bigger in size and depth, with proportionally more oil.
# Pulse Bhakri – Prepared from urad dal or mixed flour of urad and jowar, also known as Kalna bhakri. They are very popular in Khandesh region.

== Preparation ==
The dough for bhakri is prepared by mixing the flour with a small amount of salt in a bowl and kneading into a smooth stiff dough, using hot water.
The dough is split into little balls. The ball is then flattened using one&#x27;s palms. There are two ways to make the bhakri. It is either flattened on a surface by pressing with one&#x27;s palm or it is made thin by holding the ball in both palms which requires a lot of skill. The tava (pan) is heated and the bhakri is cooked by applying a little water to the upper surface and spreading it all over with the help of the cook&#x27;s fingers. The other side is also cooked on the tava. Once it is prepared, it is roasted in the direct flame on both the sides.
A bhakri can be either soft or hard. The hard bhakri basically has a hard outer layer to add a crunch.

==Serving==
Bhakri is typically served with yogurt, garlic chutney, pithla, baingan bharta, &quot;thecha&quot; (chutney made of green chillies and peanuts), preparations of green leafy vegetables and raw onion. In northern parts of Karnataka, it is served with stuffed brinjal curry. In Vidarbha, it is eaten with &quot;jhunka&quot; – a coarse and thick variant of &quot;pithla.&quot; It has traditionally been the rural staple which would be carried to the farm at the crack of dawn and make up for both breakfast and lunch. In the fields, bhakri even used to serve as a plate, on which chutney, &quot;kharda&quot; or thecha was served and eaten together. In Khandesh region, bhakri and shev bhaji (thick savory curry prepared from sev) is a very popular dish. In the coastal regions like Konkan and Goa, the rice flour bhakris are mainly served with fish curry.

In modern days, bhakhris have increasingly been replaced by wheat rotis and phulkas but they still retain popularity in many regions and as specialty dishes.

<text>The Liberals (, &quot;Oi Fileleftheroi&quot;) was a liberal political party in Greece founded by Stefanos Manos in April 1999. The president suspended operations of the party in October 2001, citing economic problems and limited appeal amongst the voting public.

==History==
The party participated independently in popular elections only once, in the 1999 European Parliament elections, gaining 1.72% of the popular vote. In the 2000 national elections, Stefanos Manos and the Liberals entered the Parliament cooperating with New Democracy. In 2004, Stefanos Manos accepted an invitation by George Papandreou, president of the Panhellenic Socialist Party and was elected, like Andreas Adrianopoulos, in the 2004 national elections riding PASOK&#x27;s ticket.

<doc id="1345821" wikidata="Q4859065" url="?curid=1345821" title="Unsecured debt">
<text>In finance, unsecured debt refers to any type of debt or general obligation that is not protected by a guarantor, or collateralized by a lien on specific assets of the borrower in the case of a bankruptcy or liquidation or failure to meet the terms for repayment. Unsecured debts are sometimes called signature debt or personal loans. These differ from secured debt such as a mortgage, which is backed by a piece of real estate.

In the event of the bankruptcy of the borrower, the unsecured creditors have a general claim on the assets of the borrower after the specific pledged assets have been assigned to the secured creditors. The unsecured creditors usually realize a smaller proportion of their claims than the secured creditors.

In some legal systems, unsecured creditors who are &quot;also&quot; indebted to the insolvent debtor are able (and, in some jurisdictions, required) to set off the debts, so actually putting the unsecured creditor with a matured liability to the debtor in a pre-preferential position.

Under risk-based pricing, creditors tend to demand extremely high interest rates as a condition of extending unsecured debt. The maximum loss on a properly collateralized loan is the difference between the fair market value of the collateral and the outstanding debt. Thus, in the context of secured lending, the use of collateral reduces the size of the &quot;bet&quot; taken by the creditor on the debtor&#x27;s creditworthiness. Without collateral, the creditor stands to lose the &quot;entire sum&quot; outstanding at the point of default and must boost the interest rate to price in that risk. Hence, although sufficiently high interest rates are considered usurious, unsecured loans would not be made at all without them.

Unsecured loans are often sought out if additional capital is required although existing (but not necessarily all) assets have been pledged to secure prior debt. Secured lenders more often than not include language in the loan agreement that prevents debtor from assuming additional secured loans or pledging any assets to a creditor.

== Examples of unsecured debt ==

=== Types of unsecured debt ===

# Corporate unsecured debt – Since this type of debt assumes a greater amount of risk, corporations that have lower bond ratings (such as BBB) are classified as unsecured debt due to their higher default risk.
# Personal loan – A personal loan is a loan which can be taken to meet unspecified financial needs, such as a wedding, travel, or medical emergencies. The interest paid on a personal loan is in most cases higher than that payable on secured loans.
# Consumer durable loan – In the retail sector or e-commerce, a growing number of merchants have embraced point-of-sale financing. It is commonly called consumer finance. On the spot no-cost EMI option is given. Even though, as per the rules and regulations of specific countries, there can never be no cost EMI option. Any lending institute is bound to take interest in some form or the other from you.
# Student loans – This common type of debt is considered unsecured in many countries, because the loan is usually taken by a student (usually at graduate or undergraduate level) or the student&#x27;s parent or legal guardian to pay tuition fees. The borrower is usually expected to pay back the loan after completing the course and securing a job, and because this is uncertain, lenders have very strict criteria for this product. The loan is only given after the lender assesses the student&#x27;s academic record, the type of course the student is wishing to pursue and the quality of the university / institute where the student has secured admission for the aforementioned course, in addition to other standard criteria such as the guarantor&#x27;s credit history, bank account statements, assets and holdings, etc. However, in rare cases, the borrower (usually a parent / legal guardian) of the student can pledge assets against the loan, thereby making it a secured loan. In recent times, many salaried professionals also take loans to complete part-time courses or certifications. In such cases however, the loan is not considered to be a student loan – it is simply categorized as a general personal loan.

==National differences==

=== United States ===
Failure to make a payment on an unsecured debt may ultimately result in reporting the delinquent debt to a credit reporting agency or legal action. However, a nongovernmental unsecured creditor cannot seize any of your assets without a court judgment in the U.S.

A creditor must file a complaint in state or federal court before a judgment can be made for or against the borrower.

===UK===
Unsecured loans in the UK are a form of credit that doesn&#x27;t require collateral, such as property or other assets, to back the loan. This makes them a popular choice for borrowers who may not have assets to secure against a loan or prefer not to risk their assets. Unsecured loans are primarily based on the borrower&#x27;s creditworthiness, with lenders evaluating credit history, income, and financial stability to determine eligibility. Interest rates for these loans can vary widely depending on the lender and the borrower&#x27;s credit score. While unsecured loans offer the convenience of borrowing without collateral, they typically come with higher interest rates compared to secured loans, reflecting the increased risk for the lender. They are commonly used for various purposes, including debt consolidation, home improvements, or covering unexpected expenses. It&#x27;s important for borrowers to carefully consider their ability to repay an unsecured loan, as failure to do so can significantly impact their credit score and financial health.

===Malaysia===
In Malaysia, there are personal loans for the private sector and for the government sector. The personal loan interest rate for the private sector is always higher than the government sector because it is of lower risk for the bank to lend to the government sector. The government will pay the salary of the civil servants through a payroll system known as the Biro Angkasa and the bank will deduct the monthly installment of the loan from the civil servant&#x27;s salary through this system, before the salary is even released. An example of these loans are cooperative loans.

Interest rates for personal loans in Malaysia are influenced by either one of these factors: loan amount, loan tenure and income of the applicant. In some cases, the bank will take 2 or even 3 of these factors to decide on the appropriate interest rate to be applied to the personal loan. In 2013, the Malaysian Central Bank introduces a new maximum loan tenure of 10 years for personal loan (previous maximum loan tenure was 25 years).

===Singapore===
In Singapore, unsecured credit, including credit card debt and personal loans, can carry high interest rates due to the lack of collateral. To safeguard borrowers from excessive debt accumulation, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has implemented measures effective since January 1, 2018. These rules cap additional unsecured credit for borrowers whose outstanding debts exceed six times their monthly income, with a total credit limit not exceeding 12 times their monthly income.

The borrowing limit, set industry-wide, aims to prevent long-term reliance on unsecured credit and reduce debt accumulation. Banks must conduct credit bureau checks before granting new credit facilities or credit limit increases, ensuring loans align with borrowers&#x27; ability to repay. To manage debt effectively, borrowers can explore debt repayment plans and debt consolidation options. Understanding the rules and regulations can help borrowers maintain financial stability and make informed borrowing decisions in Singapore.

<doc id="1345840" wikidata="Q7919385" url="?curid=1345840" title="Velvet Chain">
<text>Velvet Chain is a bi-coastal alternative rock band whose sound features a mixture of trip hop, rock, and pop, with a jazz/funk flavor. (The band has sometimes been known to refer to their work as &quot;space-jazz&quot; or &quot;moody groove music&quot; - which is also the title of one of their albums.)

&quot;Velvet Chain&quot; was formed in 1993 by Jeff Stacy (legal name “Jeffrey Calamusa”) (formerly of “Heat Your Shack” and “Tunnelmental”) and Erika Amato, the creative core of the band.

They found mainstream attention after they appeared on an episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, (&quot;Never Kill A Boy On The First Date&quot;) and later had a song included in the show&#x27;s soundtrack.

Their music has also been used on other TV shows, including HBO&#x27;s Sex and the City, MTV&#x27;s Road Rules, CBS&#x27;s Beverly Hills, 90210 and ABC&#x27;s Big Shots.

The band last played live in 2007. Core founding members Jeff Stacy (Jeffrey Calamusa) and Erika Amato were working on a new album before Jeff&#x27;s untimely death in August 2020. Erika is continuing to work on the album and plans to release it at a later date.

<text>Carl Cox (born 29 July 1962) is a British house and techno club DJ, radio DJ and record producer. He is based in Frankston, Victoria, Australia. 

Cox has won and been nominated for numerous awards. He has performed at numerous clubs and electronic music or dance events worldwide. He has hosted a residency known as &quot;Music is Revolution&quot; every summer season at the Space Ibiza nightclub, from 2001 to 2016. He has featured his own &quot;Carl Cox &amp; Friends&quot; stage at many festivals, such as Ultra Music Festival, The BPM Festival and Tomorrowland. Cox has also served as a monthly DJ for BBC Radio 1&#x27;s &quot;Essential Mix&quot;.

He runs the record label, Intec Digital, which was founded around 1998 as Intec Records. Cox also had his own radio show and podcast, entitled &quot;Global&quot;, which he ran until February 2017. In 2018, he founded Awesome Soundwave, a record label focused on live electronic music artists, with live artist and producer Christopher Coe.

==Early and personal life==
Cox spent his early life in Carshalton, south London and moved to Brighton in his late teens.

, he is living in Hove but also spends time in Melbourne, where he owns a house in Frankston. At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Cox opted to return to his home in Frankston rather than Hove.

== Music career ==
===1977–1990s===
At age 15, Cox began working as a mobile DJ, finding a passion for disco music. He began his music career around the same time that Chicago house music found its forefront in the world of dance music. 

In the 1980s, Cox became a mainstage DJ in the electronica industry. He eventually became known as one of the founders of that sound and was part of the emerging British rave scene, and became renowned for the uncommon practice of three-deck mixing. He played at the first night of Danny Rampling&#x27;s Shoom night after his return from Ibiza in the summer of 1987, a Balearic / Acid House night in London.

In the early 1990s he released his debut single for Paul Oakenfold&#x27;s Perfecto label, &quot;I Want You (Forever)&quot;. Cox continued to create music, eventually embracing techno music that would soon become popular.

He ran Ultimate Base at the now defunct Velvet Underground club on Charing Cross Road, London in the mid-to late 1990s. Cox also played the Millennium on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1999, by performing in Sydney, Australia, and again in Hawaii after flying back over the International Date Line. He was also global resident DJ for BBC Radio 1&#x27;s &quot;Essential Mix&quot; in 1998–99. In 1997, &quot;DJ Magazine&quot; chose Cox as the first #1 DJ for its first top 100 poll.

===21st century===
He broadcast over a decade&#x27;s worth of Ibiza live mixes from Space, specifically from 2001 to 2016.

In 2001, Cox began a yearly residency at Space Ibiza, a nightclub in Ibiza, Spain. He began playing on the terrace for Space&#x27;s &quot;We Love... Space on the Terrace&quot;. Following that, he played on Thursdays inside the club. For fifteen years, Cox built his residency entitled &quot;Music is Revolution&quot;. The final season of Cox&#x27;s residency was entitled &quot;The Final Chapter&quot; and took place every Tuesday during the summer of 2016. Cox finished the residency on 20 September 2016 by playing a vinyl and CDJ, ten-hour set. Artists who joined Cox on his final night included tINI, Popof, Nic Fanciulli and DJ Sneak. Cox also played at the closing night of the club itself on 2 October 2016.

In 2004, Cox debuted the Carl Cox &amp; Friends arena at Ultra Music Festival, which has since taken place for twelve years. In the film &quot;Can U Feel It?&quot;, a documentary about Ultra Music Festival, Cox explains that the concept of Carl Cox &amp; Friends came about as a result of not only wanting to play longer sets at festivals, but also to give festival goers an experience within the festival, as Carl has far more creative control over his own stage. The stage is popular with festival goers, and has featured artists like Laurent Garnier, Nic Fanciulli, Loco Dice, Marco Carola, Maceo Plex and many more. Since he created the Carl Cox &amp; Friends concept in 2004, this curated stage has taken place at other festivals and events including Awakenings, EDC Las Vegas, The BPM Festival, Ultra Europe, Tomorrowland, Amsterdam Dance Event and many others.

Cox has performed at clubs such as the Eclipse, Shelley&#x27;s Laserdome, Sterns Nightclub, Heaven, Sir Henry&#x27;s, Angels and The Haçienda, as well as raves for Fantazia, Dreamscape, NASA and Amnesia House.

After his residency at Space Ibiza, in 2017 Cox played three showcases at The BPM Festival, his stage at Ultra Music Festival, and at the Social Festival in Mexico and Colombia. Also in 2017, Cox was named the global ambassador of Ultra Music Festival&#x27;s techno and house music concept, Resistance. He curated Pure Festival in Sydney and Melbourne, Australia, in April 2017.

After sixteen years of Cox&#x27;s &quot;Global&quot; radio podcast, he announced via Facebook that he would no longer be working on the show and that it would end in February 2017.
In 2019 Cox travelled to Australia and worked with Gavin Campbell, producing a remix of Yothu Yindi&#x27;s song &quot;Treaty&quot;, performing live outdoors with Yothu Yindi &amp; The Treaty Project at the Babylon Festival, Carapooee, Victoria, in February 2019.
For 2020, he announced via the Goodwood website that he would be playing a summer festival DJ set at the first of the Three Friday nights at Goodwood Racecourse with a special dedication to the Lloyds before their departure.

==Intec==
Cox formed his own record label, Intec Records in 1998–9. Intec Records released music from 1999 to 2006. However, in 2006 he decided to put the label on a brief hiatus and relaunched it in 2010 as Intec Digital.

== Awesome Soundwave ==
In 2018, Cox teamed up with live artist Christopher Coe to form a new record label solely focused on live electronic artists. Awesome Soundwave is Cox&#x27;s second label, after techno label Intec. The label debut featured Christopher Coe&#x27;s &#x27;MNTNs of SLNC&#x27; album. In 2019, the label made its debut at Amsterdam Dance Event with Awakenings Festival, and returned in 2022 for a daytime event at Ziggo Dome, Amsterdam. The label held a residency at DC-10 Ibiza in July- August 2022. In 2023, the label has an extensive roster of live and improvised artists, such as Marc Romboy, Hannes Bieger, Robert Babicz, An On Bast, Saytek and Australia&#x27;s Honeysmack. 

==In film==
In 1999, Cox starred in the British film &quot;Human Traffic&quot; as Pablo Hassan, the manager of the Asylum club.

Cox starred in a 2017 EDM-themed documentary titled &quot;What We Started&quot; with Martin Garrix showing thirty years of EDM history by focusing mainly on his and Martin Garrix&#x27;s diverging careers. The documentary is co-written, produced and directed by Bert Marcus alongside executive producer and music supervisor Pete Tong.

== Carl Cox Motorsport ==
Cox set up Carl Cox Motorsport in New Zealand in 2013.

=== Extreme E ===
In January 2023, Carl Cox Motorsport has been confirmed as a new entrant in the electric off-road racing series Extreme E for the 2023 season with Christine GZ and Timo Scheider signed as drivers for the team. The team won its first podium by finishing third in Round 3. In Round 4, the team withdrew from the race after the car was damaged during qualifying. In July, Lia Block, the daughter of the late Ken Block, replaced Christine GZ at Round 5 for the rest of the season. The team finished in ninth place in the Teams&#x27; Championship in their debut season.

Prior to the 2024 season, Carl Cox Motorsport announced they will take a sabbatical to concentrate on entering Extreme H, a series similar to Extreme E but uses hydrogen-powered cars instead, in 2025.

<doc id="1345843" wikidata="Q2516277" url="?curid=1345843" title="Wasdale">
<text>Wasdale (; traditionally ) is a valley and civil parish in the western part of the Lake District National Park in Cumbria, England. The River Irt flows through the valley to its estuary at Ravenglass. A large part of the main valley floor is occupied by Wastwater, the deepest lake in England ().

==Geographical features==

On the south-eastern side of the lake are very steep screes below the summits of Whin Rigg and Illgill Head which are more accessible on the far side. The head of the valley is dominated by the Great Gable and Scafell Pike, the highest peak in England, which, along with Scafell, Kirk Fell and Yewbarrow, surround the small community of Wasdale Head. Wasdale is famous amongst rock climbers as the home of British rock climbing. A classic route is Nape&#x27;s Needle on Great Gable.

==Settlements==
At the hamlet of Wasdale Head is St Olaf&#x27;s Church, one of the smallest churches in England.

Further down the valley are the villages of Strands and Gosforth.

==Fells==
Clockwise from the north-west:-

*Seatallan
**Buckbarrow
*Middle Fell
*Yewbarrow
*Red Pike
*Scoat Fell
*Pillar
*Kirk Fell
*Great Gable
&quot;Sty Head Pass&quot;
*Great End
*Scafell Pike
**Lingmell
*Scafell
*Illgill Head
*Whin Rigg
**Irton Pike

==Etymology==
The name came from Old Norse &quot;Vatnsdalr&quot; = &quot;valley of the water&quot;.
The alternative spelling &quot;Wastdale&quot; existed through much of the nineteenth century.

==Civil parish==
The civil parish of Wasdale was historically a chapelry called Nether Wasdale within the larger ancient parish of St Bees. Nether Wasdale became a separate civil parish under the Poor Law Amendment Act 1866. The name of the civil parish remained Nether Wasdale until 2000, when it was changed to Wasdale.

Due to the low resident population of the parish there is no parish council, with the area instead having a parish meeting. The low population also means that since the 2011 Census separate population statistics for the parish have not been published.

<text>Like Cola was a cola soft drink, introduced by the 7 Up company (then under the ownership of Philip Morris), that appeared in the American market in 1982. Its slogan was &quot;Made From The Cola Nut.&quot; Like Cola was one of the first attempts at a low-caffeine cola, containing 1% caffeine. It was packaged in a red and blue can. A diet version was also available, with the color scheme reversed. Like Cola was also packaged in 1 pint (16 ounce) clear bottles embossed with shooting stars.
Like Cola was the major sponsor of one of the races in the 1983 NASCAR Winston Cup Series that occurred on July 24 of that year – the Like Cola 500 at Pocono Raceway in Long Pond, Pennsylvania. Tim Richmond won that race. Commercials for the product featured comedian Tim Conway and actor Kevin Dobson as spokespersons.

Because several 7 Up bottlers also distributed colas such as Coca-Cola, Pepsi-Cola or eventual 7 Up sister drink RC Cola (which introduced another caffeine-free cola, RC 100, in 1980) they refused to distribute Like Cola – limiting its availability.

The Like name was first used from 1963 to 1969 for 7 Up&#x27;s diet lemon-lime soda which was renamed Diet 7 Up.

<doc id="1345846" wikidata="Q4821971" url="?curid=1345846" title="Aunt Jenny">
<text>Aunt Jenny was an advertising character created for Spry Vegetable Shortening. Primarily portrayed by Edith Spencer, Aunt Jenny was best known as host and narrator of the long-lived radio show, &quot;Aunt Jenny’s Real Life Stories&quot; (January 18, 1937 – November 16, 1956), but she was also seen promoting the product in drawings, photographs and cookbooks.

==Origins==
In 1936, Lever Brothers, part of the large corporation Unilever, introduced Spry Vegetable Shortening as a competitor to the long-successful shortening Crisco, produced by Procter &amp; Gamble. Aunt Jenny was intended to give a pleasant face to what might otherwise be seen as a boring or at least uninspiring product, therefore presenting a challenge to writers of advertisement copy. Sometimes even Jenny’s enthusiastic writers seemed to be reaching for things to say—on the final page of the Aunt Jenny’s Favorite Recipes cookbook appears a blurb boasting that doughnuts made with Spry are “so light and digestible a child can eat ‘em.” For the most part, however, Aunt Jenny was successful, and within mere months Spry had consumed nearly half of Crisco’s considerable market share.

In appearance, Aunt Jenny was a slightly plump, grandmotherly woman with bright white hair, thin spectacles, and an ever-present baking apron. Her demeanor was sweet, kind, helpful and enthusiastic, especially regarding her home cooking and Spry Vegetable Shortening in particular. She spoke in a plain and homey manner, often dropping the ending &quot;g&quot; of words like &quot;cooking&quot;.

==Radio==
Aunt Jenny’s best-remembered aspect was the long-running radio show, &quot;Aunt Jenny’s Real Life Stories&quot;, which made its debut on CBS on January 18, 1937. The show took the format of a dramatic serial or soap opera, presenting a different story weekly, and running for 15 minutes from 10:45am to 11:00am each weekday morning. The stories featured typical soap opera plots involving the people of a small American town called Littleton. Aunt Jenny herself was not the focus of these stories but served as host and narrator. She also offered cooking instruction, generally in the form of easy recipes which included Spry Vegetable Shortening as an ingredient.

Aunt Jenny was played by Edith Spencer, who served not only as the voice of Jenny but also provided her visual appearance in promotional materials. The announcer of the show was actor Dan Seymour. Animal imitator Henry Boyd provided the warbling of Aunt Jenny’s canary. Like most soap operas, the show had a large revolving cast over the years, serving as a springboard into professional acting for future stars, such as Richard Widmark. Eventually, Edith Spencer left the show and was replaced by Agnes Young, who sounded reasonably similar to Spencer but did not look like her. Finally, on September 28, 1956, the show’s long run came to an end.

The Major Broadcasting Network produced an Australian version of Aunt Jenny featuring Ethel Lang in the lead role.

==Cookbooks and print advertisements==
Aunt Jenny also appeared in numerous print ads found in women&#x27;s magazines, as well as several promotional cookbooks. These were generally illustrated with photographs of Edith Spencer as Jenny, but after Spencer’s departure from the radio show, they displayed artwork based on her likeness. The character of Aunt Jenny was phased out after the radio show left the air, and Unilever eventually discontinued Spry Vegetable Shortening.

Cookbooks featuring the Aunt Jenny character:
*&quot;Aunt Jenny’s Favorite Recipes&quot; (48 pages with b/w illustrations, plus index)
*&quot;Aunt Jenny&#x27;s Old Fashioned Christmas Cookies Cookbook&quot; (21 pages, 1952)

<doc id="1345847" wikidata="Q376633" url="?curid=1345847" title="Adrien-François Servais">
<text>Adrien-François Servais (6 June 180726 November 1866) was one of the most influential cellists of the nineteenth century. He was born and died in what is now Halle, Belgium. He is one of the founders of the of Paris and Madrid, which began through collaboration with his friend Auguste Franchomme and his disciple Víctor Mirecki Larramat. His compositions are still studied, performed and recorded all over the world. Two of his sons also had musical careers and performed his music.

==Biography==
Servais was originally trained as a violinist before switching to cello. Known by his contemporaries for his virtuosity and excessive vibrato, he was given the gift of a Stradivarius cello from 1701, which today bears his name. He is also known as the first cellist to adopt the bassists&#x27; use of an endpin because of the large size of his Stradivarius. 

(The use of the endpin was, however, not generally adopted by most cellists until the early 20th century. For instance, Carlo Alfredo Piatti never used an endpin, though Lisa Cristiani&#x27;s use of it in the 1840s and 1850s popularized the practice for female cellists.) 

Servais composed numerous works for his instrument, including four concerti and nearly twenty duos for two cellos or for cello and violin. Hector Berlioz referred to Servais as &quot;the Niccolò Paganini of the cello&quot;.

In addition, Servais worked with French cellist and friend Auguste Franchomme and Spanish cellist Víctor Mirecki Larramat to found the of Paris and Madrid. They influenced the development of future noted cellists, such as Pablo Casals and others from Spain.

===Family and legacy===
Servais and his wife, who had Russian ancestry, had several children, including two sons who also pursued musical careers. 

Their daughter Zofia Servais married Cyprian Godebski, a Polish sculptor in the Russian Empire, who became a professor at the Imperial Institute of Arts in St. Petersburg. Zofia died in a nearby town shortly after the birth in March 1872 of daughter Maria Zofia Olga Zenajda Godebska, known as &quot;Misia&quot;. Godebski sent his daughter to Belgium to be cared for by her Servais family for several years. She was given early musical tranining and had precocious gifts. She became a pianist. 

Later Godebski remarried and reclaimed his daughter; he enrolled her in a convent boarding school in Paris for eight years. Known best as Misia Sert, she was an important patron of Paris&#x27;s early 20th century artistic community, which she encouraged through hosting numerous artists, writers and musicians at her salons. 

Some years after his death in 1866, Servais was honored by his home town of Halle. His sculptor son-in-law, Professor Cyprian Godebski, created and installed a statue of him in front of the town hall on its central market square.

The South-West Brabant Museum in Halle has a collection on his life and work. It also holds material about his granddaughter Misia Sert and her father Cyprian Godebski.

<doc id="1345848" wikidata="Q4451478" url="?curid=1345848" title="In Praise of Pip">
<text>&quot;In Praise of Pip&quot; is an episode of the American television anthology series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. In this episode, after learning that his soldier son has suffered a mortal wound in an early phase of the Vietnam War, a crooked bookie encounters a childhood version of his son.

This was the first episode of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; to be 25 minutes long since &quot;The Changing of the Guard&quot;.

==Opening narration==
==Plot==
In Vietnam, medics are examining Pip Phillips, a wounded soldier. The medical officer says Pip&#x27;s case is hopeless and it is only a matter of time before he will die. In the United States, Pip&#x27;s father Max, a bookie, suckers a young man named George Reynold into placing $300 on a bad bet. Reynold comes to him for help, saying that he made the bet on loaned money and will go to jail if he doesn&#x27;t get it back. Max returns the $300, but his boss Mr. Moran notices the discrepancy in the books and summons both Max and Reynold to his office. As the young man is strong-armed into returning his bet, Max receives a telegram about Pip&#x27;s condition. Max vocally rues the time he spent working as a bookie instead of being a father to his son, and returns the money to Reynold. He tells him to run and threatens Moran and his underling with a knife. The underling shoots Max but Max is still enraged by his son&#x27;s fate and uses his knife to kill both men.

Wounded, he stumbles outside towards a closed amusement park and is surprised to see Pip at age 10. The two have some fun and redress Max&#x27;s near-constant absence from his son&#x27;s life, with Max teaching Pip how to shoot at a shooting gallery. Pip runs off into the house of mirrors, and Max follows. When Max finds him, Pip explains that he is dying and vanishes. Max prays to God and offers to trade his own life in exchange for Pip&#x27;s. He collapses and dies on the midway.

Some months later, the adult Pip is seen at the park, now walking with the aid of a cane. Max&#x27;s former landlady Mrs. Feeny is also there with her granddaughter and recalls Max&#x27;s love for his son. Pip visits the shooting gallery, remembering the wonderful times he had as a child with his father and his father&#x27;s advice to work the gun and not the jaw. He proclaims that his father was &quot;[his] best buddy&quot; as he begins to play the shooting game.

Ross Elliott did receive billing in the earlier Jack Klugman episode &quot;Death Ship&quot; although, same as in this episode, he had no scenes with Klugman. Russell Horton was also credited in third season&#x27;s &quot;The Changing of the Guard&quot; (June 1962), playing one of the students. S. John Launer was in three season one episodes, receiving credit in &quot;The Purple Testament&quot; (February 1960), but remaining uncredited in &quot;Third from the Sun&quot; (January 1960), in which only his voice was heard. His earliest episode, in which he likewise received no credit, was &quot;And When the Sky Was Opened&quot; (December 1959).

==Episode notes==
The script is essentially a reworked version of the A-plot of “Next of Kin”, a one-hour script Serling wrote for &quot;Kraft Television Theatre&quot; and which aired on 8 April 1953. &quot;In Praise of Pip&quot; removes two other intertwined stories that were part of &quot;Next of Kin&quot;, but the first two acts are otherwise almost identical down to the character names, the only change being that Max&#x27;s son is named Tommy in &quot;Next Of Kin&quot;, not Pip. (And the war, of course, is in Korea, not Vietnam.) Act III, with Max encountering young Pip in the amusement park, is unique to this telling of the story.

&quot;In Praise of Pip&quot; opens in Vietnam, with a wounded Pip being brought into a front-line mobile hospital. Rod Serling originally wanted the episode&#x27;s opening to take place in Laos; it was CBS who asked for the change to Vietnam. As a result of the prominent use of Vietnam in the episode, &quot;In Praise of Pip&quot; is often incorrectly cited as the first American television drama to mention the growing Vietnam War, or the first to show a Vietnam veteran—both assertions, however, are false. Starting in March 1963, actor Glenn Corbett had become a regular on the CBS series &quot;Route 66&quot;, playing returned Vietnam soldier Lincoln Case. The Vietnam War and its effects on Linc were crucial plot points in several &quot;Route 66&quot; episodes, including his debut, which was broadcast six months before this episode.

The episode was filmed on location at the Pacific Ocean Park in Santa Monica, California.

This was the first episode sponsored by American Tobacco (on alternate weeks), on behalf of Pall Mall cigarettes, who suggested that Serling and some of the guest stars and supporting players &quot;light up&quot; during the episodes. Unlike previous sponsor Liggett &amp; Myers, American Tobacco did not have Serling plug their products at the end of the program.

<text>Bangor Football Club is a semi-professional Irish League football club playing in the NIFL Championship. The club, founded in 1918, hails from Bangor and plays its home matches at Clandeboye Park. Club colours are gold and royal blue.

==History==
===Early history===
The first Bangor FC was founded, according to local legend, in 1914 in a rowing boat on Bangor Bay. When The Great War was declared in the August of that year, football was abandoned in Bangor as many young men rushed to join up and the then leading junior teams in the town, Bangor Rangers and Clifton Amateurs, folded. Soon, however, two enthusiasts, Bob Lindsay and Jimmy Savage, found they could not face the prospect of a winter without football and so the idea of a &quot;Bangor FC&quot; was born as they discussed the situation when out for a row in the bay.

Back on dry land, a committee was formed and the new Bangor FC played at the Recreation Ground off the Brunswick Road, as a successful member of the Irish Football Alliance. However, in August 1918, Bangor FC wound up its affairs as there was a feeling amongst some members that it was wrong to be playing sport while young men were being slaughtered in the carnage of Flanders.
Others were convinced that life should continue as normally as possible and within a matter of days a &quot;new&quot; Bangor FC was born, taking over the fixtures and many of the players of the &quot;old&quot; Bangor FC.

Encouraged by early success, Bangor joined the then Intermediate league where they played until gaining admission into the Irish League in 1927. Their first senior match was a local derby against Ards at Castlereagh Park on 20 August 1927.

The late twenties and thirties were times of economic depression, money was scarce, gates disappointing and the club had to be run on a shoe-string. Against this background, Bangor were able to field a team which was able to keep its head above water, though often to be found in the lower half of the league.

At that time Bangor FC played at the Ballyholme Showgrounds where they had moved from their second home in Castle Street in 1923. The Showgrounds were situated just behind the Ballyholme Esplanade and, being sand based, had one of the best and robust surfaces in the Irish League. In 1934, the club was given notice to quit as the ground was required for building houses ; Sandringham Drive now occupies the site.

After a season when all games had to be played away from home and which almost saw the demise of the club, Bangor moved in 1935 to their present home at Clandeboye Park, which was provided by Bangor Borough Council.

===Recent history===
Bangor enjoyed the most successful period in its history during the 1990s when the club qualified for Europe for the first time in its history after finishing second in the Irish League. This success was followed by winning the Irish Cup in 1993 after two replays against bitter rivals, Ards. Paul Byrne, who scored the winning goal with the last kick of the game, moved on to Celtic.

In October 2007, the club announced that a deal had been struck with property developers to sell land at the rear of the ground and use this to clear all debts. On 13 May 2008, it was announced that Bangor had secured a place in the new 12-team IFA Premiership for the 2008/09, season despite only having finished third in the IFA Intermediate League First Division in 2007/08.

Their stay in the Premiership only lasted a season as midway through the campaign the Club decided not to re-apply for the Domestic Licence that was required to compete at this level. On 1 February 2009, the club announced that it would not be renewing its domestic licence for 2009–10 and would therefore resign from the IFA Premiership at the end of the season due to financial reasons and low attendances at matches. Connected with this announcement, manager Marty Quinn resigned and was appointed as manager of Glenavon. As a result, Bangor FC were relegated at the end of the season and in season 2009/10 they competed in the Championship 1 league. The first season back in Intermediate football proved quite difficult with a hastily arranged, young squad. A draw in the penultimate match of the season against Ballymoney United ensured that they avoided the ignominy of relegation to Championship 2 by a single point.

Marty Quinn was replaced by Colin McCurdy who guided Bangor through their first season back in Intermediate Football. Colin McCurdy resigned from his position on 18 September 2010 and former player Frankie Wilson was appointed.

A trio of Bangor players were selected for the Northern Ireland Junior International Squad for a Regions Cup qualifying mini-tournament in Macedonia. Defender Brian Hylands, striker Barry Bloomer and goalkeeper Graeme McKibbin played an active part in Harry McConkey&#x27;s Regions Cup squad.

Frankie Wilson was announced as Colin McCurdy&#x27;s replacement on 30 September 2010. A talented midfielder, Frankie began his Irish League playing career at Ballyclare Comrades in November 1991. He later had spells at Carrick Rangers and Omagh Town before joining Bangor in December 2001. Frankie made 35 starting appearances and scored seven goals for Bangor before returning to Omagh Town in the summer of 2003.

In his first full season in charge, Frankie Wilson guided the side to its first trophy since 2005 when they won the Steel &amp; Sons Cup. This was secured on Christmas Eve, 24 December 2011 when they defeated Larne 2–1 in front of a large crowd at Seaview in Belfast. Gareth McLaughlin and Man of the Match, Garth Scates were the scorers.

After a poor run of results which saw Bangor plunge to the bottom of Championship 1 at the end of 2012, Frankie Wilson stood down as manager and was replaced by Garth Scates. During the 2014–15 season Garth Scates stepped down as manager due to not holding the appropriate coaching badges for the club to obtain a Championship Licence, Jeff Montgomery took over as manager and Garth Scates remains as 1st Team Coach. Spike Hill was named as first team coach in October 2016 after Garth Scates and Jeff Montgomery resigned during a league game away to Limavady United. Kyle Spiers joined Spike Hill as Director of Football at the club at the same time as Spike&#x27;s arrival.

The club were involved in a pulsating promotion race in the 2014–2015 season with Carrick Rangers and Ards with Carrick eventually scooping the title and promotion to the NIFL Premiership with the Seasiders entering a play off with Premiership Warrenpoint Town to whom they lost on penalties in the second leg to keep The Point in the premiership for another season.

===Dropping Out of NIFL and Financial Difficulty 2016-19===

In February 2016, the club, suffering a degree of financial difficulty was issued a winding up order from their contractors who installed their 3G Pitch which was successfully settled. The club would be demoted to the NIFL Premier Intermediate League after failing to apply for a NIFL Championship licence in the appropriate time, dropping to the third tier of Northern Irish football for the first time in their history.

The Seasiders would suffer back to back relegations when they were relegated to the Ballymena &amp; Provincial Intermediate League at the end of the 16/17 Season after finishing bottom of the NIFL Premier Intermediate League, being relegated from senior football for the first time, with the Seasiders sharp decline in the space of only a few years causing great surprise in Irish League football.

Linfield captain and Bangor native Jamie Mulgrew would lament the situation at the club, describing them as a &quot;Laughing Stock&quot;, in light of off the field issues, and their decline from reaching the County Antrim Shield final and being denied promotion to the NIFL Premiership on penalties two years previous to dropping out of senior football for the first time ever. 

Following the club&#x27;s relegation from League football, both Hill and Spiers tendered their resignations and former Albert Foundry manager Hugh Sinclair was appointed.

Bangor won the BPIL league, winning 27 of 28 league games (1 draw) in the 18/19 Season, to comfortably win the league title and secure promotion back to league football for the 19/20 season.

===Championship Return 2023-===
In April 2023, following a win over Queens University, the club secured promotion to the NIFL Championship for the first time since 2016. In their first season back in the Championship, they finished third and narrowly missing out on a play-off place for promotion.

==Colours==
The official club colours are gold and blue, although in recent years the gold has been replaced by yellow as this is the shade more commonly used by kit manufacturers. The original colours were blue shirts and white shorts but the club changed these to gold and blue before the Second World War as a mark of thanks to Bangor Borough Council who donated them the land on the Clandeboye Road where Clandeboye Park now stands.

Gold and blue are traditional Bangor colours with the gold representing sand and the blue representing the sea.

For the 2008/09 Premier league season, Bangor introduced an all yellow kit, which they retained for a few seasons before reverting to yellow shirts and blue shorts in season 2010/11.

For season 2011/12, Bangor introduced a yellow and blue striped shirt for their home kit and a new white away shirt with yellow and blue trim. The kit was supplied by ONE.

Season 2012/13 saw Bangor revert to the popular yellow shirts with blue shorts, supplied by Nike. The main logo on the front of the shirt is for the RVH (Royal Victoria Hospital) Liver Support Group charity.

==Stadium==
After much negotiation during 2012 and the early part of 2013, Bangor FC&#x27;s application to Sport NI for grant aid was successful. With a matching loan from UCIT (Ulster Community Investment Trust) Bangor were able to proceed with their plan to lay a new 3G pitch at Clandeboye Park. Greg Seeley Consulting were appointed as Designers &amp; Project Managers, while TAL Civil Engineering Limited were selected as the main contractors.

Aligned to the laying of the pitch, Bangor FC entered into an agreement with Shared Access Ltd which led to New Floodlights being put into place to complement the development of the ground. Work started on 24 June 2013 and the new ground was opened without much fanfare on 12 October 2013 when Bangor beat Knockbreda 2–0 in a Northern Ireland Football League Championship 1 match.

The new FIFA Approved 3G surface is 99 metres x 63 metres with a run off area of 2.5 metres. The playing surface is surrounded by a steel fence (replacing the old concrete wall) and a tarmac walkway. The development allows spectators to access all sides of the ground for the first time in many years. The 3G facility is available for hire by the public and members of the local community.
Early in 2014, Bangor FC became the first club in the Irish League to sell the naming rights of their ground, with Clandeboye Park becoming officially known as The Bangor Fuels Arena. This received a mixed response from the club&#x27;s fans but an announcement from the club confirmed that the sponsorship deal with local business firm Bangor Fuels would be in place for the next five years. The deal includes shirt sponsorship, advertising around the ground as well as the naming rights.

Bangor FC has restored their stadium name to Clandeboye Park on Thursday 16 September 2021 after 8 years of affiliation with Bangor Fuels.

<doc id="1345861" wikidata="Q798639" url="?curid=1345861" title="Bad Boy Bill">
<text>Bad Boy Bill (born William Renkosik) is a disc jockey (DJ) from Chicago, Illinois, U.S. who plays an assortment of house music.

While only in his teens, Bad Boy Bill began his DJ career in 1985 during the Chicago house music movement of the mid to late 1980s.

He worked with Mike &quot;Hitman&quot; Wilson and Julian &quot;Jumpin&quot; Perez of the WBMX DJ mixing team, known then as the Hot Mix 5. Bill&#x27;s popularity grew out of DJing parties throughout the Chicago metropolitan area, as well as opening for the Hot Mix 5. Bad Boy Bill was a regular DJ on the popular house mixes on WBMX 102.7 FM in Chicago, WGCI 107.5 FM and then on the B96 96.3 FM a top pop station.

As a remixer, he landed his first Top Five Billboard Dance Chart hit at the age of 19 – Dada Nada&#x27;s &quot;Deep Love&quot; which also featured remixes by House music legends Frankie Knuckles &amp; David Morales, Robert Ozn and Steve Wight.

Currently, Bad Boy Bill plays music ranging from House to Electro, and is known for playing six separate turntables at once. In 1988 and 1989, he was placed within the top three at the Disco Mix Club championships.

Bad Boy Bill also made an uncredited appearance as the club DJ in the opening scene of the 1998 film &quot;Blade&quot;. 

== History ==

===Street DJ Promotions era (1987–1995)===
Between 1987 and 1995, Bill produced a series of promotional mixtapes under the name &quot;Street DJ Promotions.&quot; These tapes were distributed out of Bill&#x27;s car to local Chicago area record shops, flea markets, and DJ gigs. These mixes included: &quot;Hot Mix&quot; #1–17, &quot;Non-Stop Hip-Hop&quot;, &quot;Flashbacks&quot; Vol. 1 &amp; 2, &quot;Classics&quot; Vol. 1–3, &quot;Street Style&quot; 1 &amp; 2, and &quot;Gettin&#x27; Wicked&quot;.

Bill has been credited with the idea of mass-producing mix tapes unlike before, and was apparently inspired by Andre Lopez, owner of the Hot Jams record store. This caught the attention of the Recording Industry Association of America and music publishing houses who were not paid any royalties from the use of copyrighted music on the vast number of mixtapes being produced and sold throughout Chicago by these many DJs. Bill then became a part of the licensed-mix movement and started Mix Connection Multimedia (MCM). He has been generally credited with being the first Chicago DJ to produce legally licensed mixes.

===Mix Connection Multimedia era (1995–2001)===
Bill created MCM in 1995 to produce legally licensed mixes, and as an umbrella company for several side projects and record labels such as International House Records (IHR), Moody Recordings, Contaminated Muzik, Canvas Recordings, and Motus Music. MCM has most notably produced &quot;Bangin&#x27; The Box&quot; Vol. 1–5, &quot;The House Connection&quot; (w/ Richard &quot;Humpty&quot; Vission) Vol. 1–3, and &quot;The B-96 Mixmaster Throwdown&quot; Vol. 1–5.

=== House Connection (1997–1998)===
Bad Boy Bill teamed up with Richard Vission to form a house DJ supergroup called The House Connection. They have released three mix albums, the last in 2013. In May 2006, Bill reunited with Vission in Dallas and Detroit for a two-day reunion show.

=== Behind The Decks (2003–2006)===
In 2003, Bill released a CD/DVD mixtape titled &quot;Behind the Decks&quot;.

In May 2006, to support the &quot;Behind the Decks&quot; mixtape, Bill embarked on a three-day tour called &quot;BTD Live&quot;. Bill performed in clubs like The Church in Denver and The Avalon in Los Angeles. Audio and video were recorded at all three shows and released as the &quot;BTD Live&quot; concert film in October 2006.

On August 5, 2013, The Official Bad Boy Bill YouTube page released &quot;House Connection 3&quot;, a free mixtape available to download on Richard Vission&#x27;s SoundCloud page.

<text>Gammon Construction Limited is a Hong Kong construction and engineering contractor headquartered in Kwun Tong, Hong Kong. In addition to local construction projects, it is also involved in the construction and engineering of various projects in China and Southeast Asia.

==History==
The company originated from a construction business founded in India by John C. Gammon in 1919. In 1955, a branch was engaged to build a new runway at Kai Tak Airport in Hong Kong. In 1958, Gammon Construction Limited (&quot;Gammon&quot;) was formed to establish a permanent presence in Hong Kong.

Once incorporated in Hong Kong, it grew rapidly, obtaining construction work of a diverse nature. By the late 1970s, it was established as the leading contractor in Hong Kong, participating in many of the major infrastructure projects of that time. The company began to expand business outside Hong Kong, establishing offices in Singapore and Vietnam.

==Ownership==
Jardine Matheson took a minority interest in Gammon in 1969 and it became a public company in 1970. Then in 1975, Jardines acquired the remaining shareholding and thus Gammon became a wholly owned subsidiary of Jardines. In late 1983, Jardine Matheson sold 50 percent of Gammon to Trafalgar House, a UK-based company involved in construction, shipping and property.

Gammon then became the preferred constructor throughout the Asia-Pacific region for both Jardines and Trafalgar House. In 1996, Kvaerner took over Trafalgar House, thereby acquiring its 50% interest in Gammon. Skanska acquired all of Kvaerner&#x27;s construction businesses, including Gammon, in late 2000. Balfour Beatty, the international engineering, construction and services group, subsequently purchased Skanska&#x27;s 50% in Gammon in 2004.

==Corporate affairs==
It has its head office in Kwun Tong. It occupies of space there. It moved there circa 2019.

Previously its head office was in TaiKoo Place in Quarry Bay.

<doc id="1345874" wikidata="Q4669052" url="?curid=1345874" title="Abraham Lincoln and slavery">
<text>Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s position on slavery in the United States is one of the most discussed aspects of his life. Lincoln frequently expressed his moral opposition to slavery in public and private. &quot;I am naturally anti-slavery. If slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong,&quot; he stated. &quot;I can not remember when I did not so think, and feel.&quot; However, the question of what to do about it and how to end it, given that it was so firmly embedded in the nation&#x27;s constitutional framework and in the economy of much of the country, even though concentrated in only the Southern United States, was complex and politically challenging. In addition, there was the unanswered question, which Lincoln had to deal with, of what would become of the four million slaves if liberated: how they would earn a living in a society that had almost always rejected them or looked down on their very presence.

==Evolution of Lincoln&#x27;s policies==
As early as the 1850s, Lincoln was widely perceived as an abolitionist. But in 1860, he was attacked as not abolitionist enough: Wendell Phillips charged that, if elected, Lincoln would waste four years trying to decide whether to end slavery in the District of Columbia. Many abolitionists emphasized the sinfulness of slave owners, but Lincoln did not. Lincoln tended not to be judgmental. In his 1854 Peoria, Illinois, speech, he said, &quot;I have no prejudice against the Southern people. They are just what we would be in their situation. If slavery did not now exist amongst them, they would not introduce it. If it did now exist amongst us, we should not instantly give it up.&quot; In 1865, in his second inaugural address, he said, &quot;It may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just God&#x27;s assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other men&#x27;s faces; but let us judge not that we be not judged,&quot; and he urged &quot;malice toward none&quot; and &quot;charity for all.&quot; Nonetheless, Lincoln suggested, God had judged the nation — &quot;both North and South&quot; — for the &quot;offence&quot; of slavery.

Lincoln focused on what he saw as a more politically practical goal: preventing the expansion of slavery into the new Western territories, which, if it occurred, could lead to new slave states, and if it were prevented would eventually lead to slavery&#x27;s demise. He supported excluding slavery from territories with the failed Wilmot Proviso in the 1840s. His 1850s activism was in reaction to the 1854 Kansas–Nebraska Act, designed by his great rival, Illinois Senator Stephen A. Douglas. The Act was a radical departure from the previous law of the Missouri Compromise of 1820, which had banned slavery from all new states north of the 36°30′ parallel (except for Missouri). Lincoln suggested that if slavery were allowed to spread it would block free labor from settling in the new states and, as a result, the entire nation would soon become ever more dominated by slave owners.

After Lincoln was elected, the departure of the Southern members of Congress made it finally possible to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia. The District of Columbia Compensated Emancipation Act of 1862 provided partial compensation to slave owners, paid out of federal funds. Lincoln hoped to persuade the border states of Maryland, Delaware, Kentucky, and Missouri to do likewise, because that would eliminate their incentive to secede from the Union to join the Confederacy. Their secession might result both in the North losing the Civil War and in the continued existence of slavery.

On September 22, 1862, having waited until the North won a significant victory in the battle at Antietam, Lincoln used the power granted to the president under Article II, section 2, of the U.S. Constitution as &quot;Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy&quot; to issue the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation. It provided that, on January 1, 1863, in the states still in rebellion, the enslaved people would be freed. On January 1, 1863, as promised, he issued the final Emancipation Proclamation, which declared &quot;that all persons held as slaves&quot; in &quot;States and parts of States ... in rebellion against the United States&quot; on that day &quot;are, and henceforward shall be free.&quot; The proclamation immediately freed on paper millions of the enslaved, but it had little practical effect until the Union Army was present. Week by week, as the army advanced, more slaves were liberated. The last were freed in Texas on &quot;Juneteenth&quot; (June 19, 1865), which became a federal holiday on June 17, 2021.

Although Lincoln stated in the Emancipation Proclamation that he &quot;sincerely believed [it] to be an act of justice,&quot; he issued it as a &quot;military necessity,&quot; because he believed that the U.S. Constitution would not permit it on any other basis. The Emancipation Proclamation was a war tactic, because by freeing enslaved people it deprived the South of labor, and it allowed African American people to &quot;be received into the armed service of the United States.&quot; Lincoln worried about the consequences of his action, fearing an endemic racial divide in the nation. Nonetheless, during his second presidential campaign, he ran on a platform to forever abolish slavery by constitutional amendment.

According to Michael Lind, Lincoln was for most of his life a moderate Northern mainstream white supremacist and proponent of black colonization abroad in Panama, Haiti, and Liberia. An ardent follower of Henry Clay, he envisioned an all-white United States without slavery. Leading Lincoln scholars, however, do not see Lincoln as a white supremacist and view his support for voluntary colonization as intended in part to make emancipation more palatable to racist white people. Eric Foner, however, writes, &quot;One problem with this explanation is that Lincoln&#x27;s advocacy of colonization predated not only his presidency but his emergence as an antislavery politician&quot;. Foner also writes, &quot;For many white Americans, including Lincoln, colonization represented a middle ground between the radicalism of the abolitionists and the prospect of the United States existing permanently half-slave and half-free&quot;. 

Until late in his life, Lincoln wanted human rights — the rights listed in the Declaration of Independence (life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness) and the natural right to eat the bread they earn with their own hands — for black people, but civil rights, such as the vote, &quot;only on their own soil&quot;, that is in their own lands abroad, to which they would move pursuant to voluntary colonization. In the last years of his life, however, Lincoln&#x27;s views changed. In March 1864, writing to the governor of Louisiana, and in April 1865, in his last public speech, which led directly to his assassination, Lincoln supported voting rights in the United States for African Americans. He was the first U.S. President to do so.

==Early years==
Lincoln was born in a slave state on February 12, 1809, in Hardin County, Kentucky. His family attended a Separate Baptists church, which had strict moral standards and opposed alcohol, dancing, and slavery. The family moved north across the Ohio River to Indiana, where slavery was not allowed, and made a new start in then Perry, now Spencer County, Indiana. Lincoln later noted that this move was &quot;partly on account of slavery&quot; but mainly due to his father&#x27;s problems with the unclear land title system in Kentucky.

As a young man, he moved west to the free state of Illinois. On January 27, 1838, he delivered his Lyceum address to the Young Men&#x27;s Lyceum of Springfield, Illinois, and in the address he spoke about slavery. Seven weeks earlier, a mob in Alton, Illinois, across the river from St. Louis, Missouri, had killed Elijah Lovejoy, a Presbyterian minister and editor of a newspaper with strong anti-slavery views. &quot;The mood of Illinois when an angry mob killed Lovejoy was pro-slavery, but not only in Illinois. The state legislatures of Connecticut and New York in the mid-1830s passed resolutions stating that slavery was accepted in the U.S. Constitution and that no state had a right to interfere&quot;. Lincoln himself had been one of only six in the Illinois House of Representatives to vote against a resolution saying &quot;That we highly disapprove of the formation of abolition societies ... That the right of property in slaves, is sacred ... That the General Government cannot abolish slavery in the District of Columbia, against the consent of the citizens of said District...&quot; &quot;Six weeks later, he and Representative Dan Stone filed a protest to the passage of the resolution—a rarely used device to register strong disagreement&quot;.

In 1842, Lincoln married Mary Todd in Springfield, Illinois. She was the daughter of a slaveholder in Kentucky, but she never owned slaves herself and came to oppose slavery as an adult.

==1840s–1850s==

===Legal and political===

Lincoln, the leader most associated with the end of slavery in the United States, came to national prominence in the 1850s, following the advent of the Republican Party, whose official position was that freedom was &quot;national,&quot; the natural condition of all areas under the direct sovereignty of the Constitution, whereas slavery was &quot;exceptional&quot; and local. Earlier, as a member of the Whig Party in the Illinois General Assembly, Lincoln issued a written protest of the Assembly&#x27;s passage of a resolution stating that slavery should not be abolished in the District of Columbia. In 1841, he won a court case (&quot;Bailey v. Cromwell&quot;), representing a black woman, Nance Legins-Costley, and her children who claimed she had already been freed and could not be sold as a slave.

One of the earliest examples of Lincoln&#x27;s written views on slavery comes from an 1845 letter Lincoln wrote to his friend Williamson Durley, concerning the annexation of Texas. In it, Lincoln said he took no position on annexation, but he added, &quot;It is possibly true, to some extent, that with annexation, some slaves may be sent to Texas and continued in slavery, that otherwise might have been liberated. To whatever extent this may be true, I think annexation an evil.&quot; He then explained, &quot;I hold it to be a paramount duty of us in the free states, due to the Union of the states, and perhaps to liberty itself (paradox though it may seem) to let the slavery of the other states alone; while, on the other hand, I hold it to be equally clear, that we should never knowingly lend ourselves directly or indirectly, to prevent that slavery from dying a natural death—to find new places for it to live in, when it can no longer exist in the old.&quot; 

In 1845, he successfully defended Marvin Pond (&quot;People v. Pond&quot;) for harboring the fugitive slave John Hauley. In 1847, he lost a case (&quot;Matson v. Ashmore et al. for the use of Bryant&quot;) representing a slave owner (Robert Matson) seeking to recover fugitive slaves. Michael Burlingame writes, &quot;Lincoln&#x27;s agreement to represent Matson has been called ... the &#x27;most profound mystery ever to confound Lincoln specialists&#x27;...&quot; Burlingame speculates that, &quot;despite his antislavery convictions, Lincoln accepted the Matson case in keeping with what became known in England as the &#x27;cab-rank&#x27; rule—stipulating that lawyers must accept the first client who hails them—and with the prevailing Whig view that lawyers should try to settle disputes in an orderly fashion through the courts, trusting in the law and the judges to assure that justice was done.&quot;

While a congressman from Illinois in 1846 to 1848, Lincoln supported the Wilmot Proviso, which, if it had been adopted, would have banned slavery in any U.S. territory won from Mexico. Lincoln, in collaboration with abolitionist Congressman Joshua R. Giddings, wrote a bill to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia with compensation for the owners, enforcement to capture fugitive slaves, and a popular vote on the matter. (Slavery in the District of Columbia was not ended until 1862, during Lincoln&#x27;s presidency, when there were no Southern senators.)

After leaving Congress in 1849 Lincoln largely ignored politics to concentrate on his law practice. He was drawn back by the firestorm over the Kansas–Nebraska Act of 1854, which reversed the longstanding Missouri Compromise and allowed territories to decide for themselves whether they would allow slavery. Lincoln was morally opposed to slavery and politically opposed to any expansion of it. At issue was its extension into the western territories. On October 16, 1854, in his Peoria speech, Lincoln declared his opposition to slavery, which he repeated as he sought the presidency. Speaking in his Kentucky accent, with a very powerful voice, he said that the Kansas-Nebraska Act&#x27;s &quot;&quot;declared&quot; indifference, but as I must think, covert &quot;real&quot; zeal for the spread of slavery, I can not but hate. I hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself. I hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world.&quot;

The United States Supreme Court&#x27;s 1857 decision in &quot;Dred Scott v. Sandford&quot; appalled Lincoln. In the decision, Chief Justice Roger B. Taney held that Black people were not citizens and derived no rights from the Constitution. In addition, Taney struck down the Missouri Compromise, which prohibited slavery in territories north of the 36°30′ parallel, as a limitation on slave owners&#x27; property rights that exceeded the U.S. Congress&#x27;s powers under the Constitution. Although Taney hoped that &quot;Dred Scott&quot; would end all disputes over slavery in the favor of Southern slaveholders, the decision sparked further outrage in the North. Lincoln denounced it as the product of a conspiracy to support the Slave Power and believed that &quot;Dred Scott&quot;, together with the Kansas–Nebraska Act, could enable slavery to spread into the free states. He argued the decision was at variance with the Declaration of Independence; he said that while the founding fathers did not believe all men equal in every respect, they believed all men were equal &quot;in certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.&quot; Lincoln first responded to Taney in a speech soon after the decision was handed down, arguing that Taney&#x27;s decision falsified history and corrupted the nation&#x27;s founding documents, particularly given Taney&#x27;s unsupportable effort to read black people entirely out of the founding of the nation.

Impressed by the strength of anti-black racism, especially in his home states of Indiana, Illinois, and Kentucky, Lincoln concluded that, because whites would never allow blacks to live in America as equals, they would be better off migrating voluntarily to a country outside the United States, ideally in Central America or the Caribbean. He had little faith in the program of the American Colonization Society, whose goal was to colonize American blacks in Liberia, on the West African coast. In a speech at Peoria, Illinois (transcribed after the fact by Lincoln himself),
Lincoln pointed out the immense difficulties of such a task as an obstacle to finding an easy way to quickly end slavery.
 In a debate in August 1858, he said:

According to historian Paul Escott, Lincoln favored a system of gradual emancipation that would allow for controlled management of free Negroes. Nonetheless, Lincoln was instrumental in forging antislavery voters into a potent political movement.

===Letter to Joshua Speed===
In 1854, Lincoln wrote to Joshua Speed, a personal friend and slave owner in Kentucky:

===Lincoln–Douglas debates===

Many of Lincoln&#x27;s &quot;public&quot; anti-slavery sentiments were presented in the seven Lincoln–Douglas debates against his opponent, Stephen Douglas, during Lincoln&#x27;s unsuccessful campaign for a seat in the U.S. Senate (which was decided by the Illinois legislature). Douglas advocated &quot;popular sovereignty&quot; and self-government, which would give the citizens of a territory the right to decide if slavery would be legal there. Douglas criticized Lincoln as being inconsistent, saying he altered his message and position on slavery and on the political rights of freed blacks in order to appeal to the audience before him, as northern Illinois was more hostile to slavery than southern Illinois.

Lincoln stated that Negroes had the rights to &quot;life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness&quot; in the first of the Lincoln–Douglas debates, saying: Publicly, Lincoln said he was not advocating Negro suffrage in speeches both in Columbus, Ohio, on September 16, 1859, and in Charleston, Illinois, on September 18, 1858, stating on the latter date:

This might have been a strategy speech used to gain voters, as Douglas had accused Lincoln of favoring negroes too much as well.

A fragment from Lincoln dated October 1, 1858, refuting theological arguments by Frederick Augustus Ross in favor of slavery, reads in part, &quot;As a good thing, slavery is strikingly perculiar [sic], in this, that it is the only good thing which no man ever seeks the good of, for himself. Nonsense! Wolves devouring lambs, not because it is good for their own greedy maws, but because it is good for the lambs!!!&quot;

==Constitutional arguments==

Two diametrically opposed anti-slavery positions emerged regarding the United States Constitution. The Garrisonians emphasized that the document permitted and protected slavery and was therefore &quot;an agreement with hell&quot; that should be rejected in favor of immediate emancipation. Lincoln deeply supported the Constitution and rejected this position. Instead, he adopted and promoted the mainstream anti-slavery position of the new Republican party. It argued that the Constitution could and should be used to eventually end slavery, but that the Constitution gave the national government no authority to abolish slavery in the states directly. However, multiple tactics were available to support the long-term strategy of using the Constitution as a battering ram against the peculiar institution. First, Congress could block the admission of any new slave states. That would steadily move the balance of power in Congress and the Electoral College in favor of freedom. Congress could abolish slavery in the District of Columbia and the territories. Congress could use the Commerce Clause to end the interstate slave trade, thereby crippling the steady movement of slavery from the economically stagnant southeast to the growing southwest. Congress could recognize free blacks as full citizens and insist on due process rights to protect fugitive slaves from being captured and returned to bondage. Finally, the government could use patronage powers to promote the anti-slavery cause across the country, especially in the border states. Pro-slavery elements considered the Republican strategy to be much more dangerous to their cause than radical abolitionism, and Lincoln&#x27;s election was met by secession. Indeed, the Republican strategy mapped the &quot;crooked path to abolition&quot; that prevailed during the Civil War.

==1860 Republican presidential nomination==

The Republican Party was committed to restricting the growth of slavery, and its victory in the election of 1860 was the trigger for secession by Southern states. The debate before 1860 was mainly focused on the Western territories, especially Kansas and the popular sovereignty controversy.

Lincoln was nominated as the Republican candidate for president in the election of 1860. Lincoln was opposed to the expansion of slavery into the territories, but agreed with nearly all Americans, including most radical abolitionists, that the federal government was prevented by the Constitution from abolishing slavery in states where it already existed. His plan was to halt the spread of slavery and to offer monetary compensation to slave owners in states that agreed to gradually end slavery (see Compensated emancipation). He was considered a moderate within the Republican party in taking the position that slavery should be put on a course of &quot;ultimate extinction&quot; with the help of the federal government.

==As President-elect in 1860 and 1861==
In a letter to Senator Lyman Trumbull on December 10, 1860, Lincoln wrote, &quot;Let there be no compromise on the question of extending slavery.&quot; In a letter to John A. Gilmer of North Carolina of December 15, 1860, which was soon published in newspapers, Lincoln wrote that the &quot;only substantial difference&quot; between North and South was that &quot;You think slavery is right and ought to be extended; we think it is wrong and ought to be restricted.&quot; Lincoln repeated this statement in a letter to Alexander H. Stephens of Georgia on December 22, 1860.

On December 15, 1860, Kentucky Senator John J. Crittenden proposed the Crittenden Compromise, a series of constitutional amendments intended to coax the Confederate states into returning to the Union. President-elect Lincoln rejected the Crittenden Compromise out of hand because it would have permitted the expansion of slavery, stating &quot;I will suffer death before I will consent or will advise my friends to consent to any concession or compromise which looks like buying the privilege of taking possession of this government to which we have a constitutional right.&quot;

On February 22, 1861, at a speech in Independence Hall, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Lincoln reconfirmed that his convictions sprang from the sentiment expressed in the Declaration of Independence, which was also the basis of the continued existence of the United States since that time, namely, the &quot;principle or idea&quot; &quot;in that Declaration giving liberty, not alone to the people of this country, but hope to the world for all future time. (Great applause.) It was that which gave promise that in due time the weights should be lifted from the shoulders of all men, and that all should have an equal chance. (Cheers.)&quot;

==Presidency (1861–1865)==

===Corwin amendment===
The proposed Corwin amendment was passed by Congress before Lincoln became President and was ratified by three states but was abandoned once the Civil War began. It would have reaffirmed what historians call the Federal Consensus—the nearly universal belief that under the Constitution the federal government had no power to abolish slavery in a state where it already existed. In his First Inaugural Address, March 4, 1861, Lincoln explained that while he had not seen the amendment and took no position on amendments in general, &quot;holding such a provision to now be implied constitutional law, I have no objection to its being made express and irrevocable.&quot; The Corwin amendment was a late attempt at reconciliation but it was doomed to fail because southerners knew that it would not stop the federal government from adopting a host of antislavery policies that did not violate the Federal Consensus. Most significantly, the Corwin amendment would not have interfered with Lincoln&#x27;s plan to ban the expansion of slavery into the federal territories, which was one of the main points of contention between pro- and anti-slavery factions.

===Building a demand for emancipation===
The American Civil War began in April 1861, and by the end of May the Lincoln administration approved a policy of not returning fugitive slaves who came within Union lines from disloyal states. Such slaves were deemed &quot;contraband of war,&quot; or &quot;contrabands.&quot; On August 6, 1861, Congress declared the forfeiture of contrabands to be permanent by passing the first of the Confiscation Acts, and two days later Lincoln&#x27;s War Department issued instructions emancipating all the slaves who came within Union lines from disloyal states or owners. By the end of the year thousands of slaves were being emancipated.

So as not to alienate the border states, Lincoln was careful to ensure that his generals followed the letter of the law. He encouraged General James K. Lane in western Missouri to emancipate thousands of slaves of disloyal masters who came voluntarily within his lines. But in eastern Missouri, when General John C. Frémont issued a decree emancipating the slaves of disloyal owners in areas the Union did not control, Lincoln ordered the general to revise his decree to conform with the law. Lincoln promoted Lane to brigadier general but would later fire Frémont for corruption and military incompetence. In western Missouri, Lincoln replaced Frémont with an abolitionist general, David Hunter. The care Lincoln took to distinguish legal from extralegal emancipation was reaffirmed in May 1862, after Hunter issued two emancipation proclamations covering the areas his troops recently occupied &quot;along the Carolina, Georgia, and Florida coast.&quot; The first proclamation, which was legal, freed &quot;all persons of color lately held to involuntary servitude by enemies of the United States.&quot; The second proclamation declared all the slaves in Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina &quot;to be &#x27;forever free,&#x27; not just those belonging to disloyal masters.&quot; That second proclamation, like Frémont&#x27;s, went beyond the law, and Lincoln reversed it, as he had Frémont&#x27;s.

After revoking Hunter&#x27;s attempt at emancipation, Lincoln issued a statement explaining that Hunter had issued his proclamation without Lincoln&#x27;s knowledge or approval, and the authority to free slaves in the rebel states was held only by the President, not his generals. He concluded by referring to a congressional resolution passed in March that stated the federal government&#x27;s intent to provide compensation to assist states that were willing to voluntarily abolish slavery and encouraged all slave states to come up with a plan to carry it out.

By the end of 1861 tens of thousands of slaves were emancipated as they crossed into Union lines at Fort Monroe, Virginia, the Sea Islands off South Carolina, and in western Missouri. In December the Lincoln administration announced its emancipation policy in a series of annual reports by the president and by several of his cabinet secretaries. By January Lincoln himself declared that no federal authority, civil or military, could legally return fugitive slaves to their owners. By then the sentiment for a more radical approach to emancipation had been building, and in July Congress authorized the president to issue a more general emancipation proclamation, freeing all the slaves in all areas in rebellion. A few days after Lincoln signed the law—known as the Second Confiscation Act—he drafted the first version of what would become his Emancipation Proclamation.

Because the Constitution could sanction emancipation only under the president&#x27;s war powers, freeing slaves could be justified only as a means of suppressing the Southern rebellion and winning the war. As a result, until the very end of the war, Lincoln claimed that the purpose of the war was the restoration of the Union. Southern leaders denounced Lincoln as a bloodthirsty revolutionary whose emancipation policies proved that the secessionists were right all along about those they labeled &quot;Black Republicans.&quot; Northern Democrats, meanwhile, denied that emancipation was a &quot;military necessity,&quot; as Lincoln and the Republicans claimed it was. But Lincoln never deviated from his official position, that because the Constitution recognized slavery in the states, the only constitutional justification for freeing slaves was military necessity.

All throughout 1862, the Lincoln administration took several direct actions against slavery. On April 16, Lincoln signed the District of Columbia Compensated Emancipation Act, which abolished slavery in Washington, D.C. Two months later, on June 19, Congress banned slavery in all federal territories, fulfilling Lincoln&#x27;s 1860 campaign promise to ban the expansion of slavery. On July 17, Congress passed the second of the Confiscation Acts. While the initial act did not make any determination on the final status of escaped slaves who fled to Union lines, the Second Confiscation act did, stating that escaped or liberated slaves belonging to anyone who participated in or supported the rebellion &quot;shall be deemed captives of war, and shall be forever free of their servitude, and not again held as slaves.&quot; The act also prohibited anyone in the military from returning escaped slaves to their masters, even if the slaves had escaped from a Union slave state.

===Letter to Greeley ===
On August 22, 1862, Lincoln published a letter in response to an editorial titled &quot;The Prayer of Twenty Millions&quot; by Horace Greeley of the &quot;New-York Tribune&quot;, in which the editor asked why Lincoln had not yet issued an emancipation proclamation, as he was authorized to do by the Second Confiscation Act. In his reply Lincoln differentiated between &quot;my view of official duty&quot;—that is, what he can do in his official capacity as President—and his personal views. Officially he must save the Union above all else; personally he wanted to free all the slaves:
At the time that Lincoln published this letter, he seemingly had already chosen the third of the three options he named: He was waiting for a Union victory to issue the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation, which would announce that he would free some but not all the slaves on January 1, 1863. Nevertheless, &quot;From mid-October to mid-November 1862, he sent personal envoys to Louisiana, Tennessee, and Arkansas. His envoys bore tidings&quot; that citizens desired &#x27;to avoid the unsatisfactory&#x27; terms of the Final Emancipation Proclamation &#x27;and to have peace again on the old terms&#x27; (i.e., with slavery intact), they should rally ... to vote in an &#x27;election of members of the members of the Congress of the United States&#x27;...&quot; Thus, Lincoln may not have ruled out the first option he expressed to Greeley: saving the Union without freeing any slave.

===Emancipation Proclamation===

On September 22, 1862, exactly one month after writing this letter, Lincoln issued his preliminary Emancipation Proclamation, which announced that, on January 1, 1863, he would, under his war powers, free all slaves in states still in rebellion. Lincoln scholar Harold Holzer wrote: &quot;Unknown to Greeley, Lincoln composed this [the letter to Greeley] after he had already drafted a preliminary Emancipation Proclamation, which he had determined to issue after the next Union military victory. Therefore, this letter was, in truth, an attempt to position the impending announcement in terms of saving the Union, not freeing slaves as a humanitarian gesture. It was one of Lincoln&#x27;s most skillful public relations efforts, even if it has cast longstanding doubt on his sincerity as a liberator.&quot; Historian Richard Striner argues that &quot;for years&quot; Lincoln&#x27;s letter has been misread as &quot;Lincoln only wanted to save the Union.&quot; However, within the context of Lincoln&#x27;s entire career and pronouncements on slavery this interpretation is wrong, according to Striner. Rather, Lincoln was softening the strong Northern white supremacist opposition to his imminent emancipation by tying it to the cause of the Union. This opposition would fight for the Union but not to end slavery, so Lincoln gave them the means and motivation to do both at the same time. In his 2014 book, &quot;Lincoln&#x27;s Gamble&quot;, journalist and historian Todd Brewster asserted that Lincoln&#x27;s desire to reassert the saving of the Union as his sole war goal was in fact crucial to his claim of legal authority for emancipation. Since slavery was protected by the Constitution, the only way that he could free the slaves was as a tactic of war—not for its own sake. But that carried the risk that when the war ended, so would the justification for freeing the slaves. Late in 1862, Lincoln asked his Attorney General, Edward Bates, for an opinion as to whether slaves freed through a war-related proclamation of emancipation could be re-enslaved once the war was over. Bates had to work through the language of the &quot;Dred Scott&quot; decision to arrive at an answer, but he finally concluded that they could indeed remain free. Still, a complete end to slavery would require a constitutional amendment.

But a constitutional amendment has to be ratified by three-fourths of the states. There were too many slave states and not enough free states for a constitutional amendment to be ratified, so even as he was preparing to issue his Emancipation Proclamation he proposed a series of constitutional amendments that would make it easier for the federal government to pressure states to abolish slavery on their own, including compensation, a gradual timetable for abolition, and subsidies for blacks willing to colonize themselves outside the United States. None of those constitutional amendments came close to passage. But by 1863 Lincoln had other ways of pressuring the state to abolish slavery: By refusing to return slaves who escaped from loyal masters in loyal states, and by enlisting slaves from loyal states into the Union Army with the promise of emancipation, the Lincoln administration systematically undermined slavery in many of the Southern states.

Lincoln had begun pressuring the border states to abolish slavery in November 1861, with no success. In 1862 he began to warn the states that if they did not abolish slavery on their own, the institution would succumb to the &quot;incidents of war&quot; and would be undermined by &quot;mere friction and abrasion&quot;. But the abrasion was no mere incident; it was the policy of emancipation. Beginning in mid-1863 Lincoln intensified the pressure on all the slave states, and in early 1864 the policy began to pay off. Between January 1864 and January 1865, three slave states abolished slavery, all under intense pressure from the federal government. By the time the House of Representatives sent the Thirteenth Amendment to the states for ratification, the ratio of free to slave states was 27:9, or the needed three-quarters.

===West Virginia===
Early in the war, several counties of Virginia that were loyal to the Union formed the Restored Government of Virginia and applied for statehood for part of western Virginia into the Union as a new state. Lincoln required West Virginia to have a constitutional plan for gradual emancipation as a condition of statehood. In response, West Virginia passed the Willey Amendment, which declared &quot;The children of slaves born within the limits of this State after the fourth day of July, eighteen hundred and sixty-three, shall be free; and all slaves within this state who shall, at the time aforesaid, be under the age of ten years, shall be free when they arrive at the age of twenty-one years; and all slaves over ten and under twenty-one years shall be free when they arrive at the age of twenty-five years; and no slave shall be permitted to come into the State for permanent residence therein.&quot; Lincoln considered this satisfactory, writing, &quot;the admission of the new state, turns that much slave soil to free; and thus, is a certain, and irrevocable encroachment upon the cause of the rebellion.&quot; West Virginia was granted statehood on June 20, 1863, and went on to fully abolish slavery on February 3, 1865, roughly three months before the end of the war.

===Conkling letter===
Lincoln came to appreciate the role that black troops played in this process. In the end some 180,000 blacks served in the Union Army, a disproportionate number of them from the states that ended up abolishing slavery. He made his feeling clear in an eloquent letter a year later to James C. Conkling on August 26, 1863.

The Conkling letter was dated August 26, 1863, the month after two great Union victories at Gettysburg and Vicksburg, but also at a time when Americans were reading the first reports of black troops fighting courageously in battles at Milliken&#x27;s Bend and Battery Wagner. It was also in the summer of 1863 that Lincoln initiated his intensified effort to get various slave states to abolish slavery on their own.

Lincoln addresses the changes to his positions and actions regarding emancipation in an 1864 letter to Albert G. Hodges. In that letter, Lincoln states his moral opposition to slavery, writing, &quot;I am naturally anti-slavery. If slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong. I can not remember when I did not so think, and feel. And yet I have never understood that the Presidency conferred upon me an unrestricted right to act officially upon this judgment and feeling.&quot; Lincoln further explained that he had eventually determined that military emancipation and the enlistment of black soldiers were necessary for the preservation of the Union, which was his responsibility as president.

Having won re-election to the presidency in November 1864 on a platform of abolishing slavery, Lincoln and several members of his cabinet embarked on a sustained lobbying effort to get the abolition amendment through the House of Representatives. The amendment abolishing slavery everywhere in the United States was ratified by every state that had abolished slavery during the war, and it became part of the Constitution on December 6, 1865.

===Reconstruction===
On December 8, 1863, Lincoln used his war powers to issue a &quot;Proclamation for Amnesty and Reconstruction&quot;, which offered Southern states a chance to peacefully rejoin the Union if they abolished slavery and collected loyalty oaths from 10 percent of their voting population. Before the end of the war, Louisiana. Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri,
Tennessee, and West Virginia, abolished slavery. In addition, the Union loyalist, Restored government of Virginia, abolished slavery before the end of the war.

On June 28, 1864, President Lincoln signed into law Congress&#x27;s repeal of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850.

As Lincoln began to be concerned about the 1864 presidential election and the potential for a new administration that would end the war without emancipation, he turned to Frederick Douglass. He said, according to Douglass, &quot;I want you to set about devising some means of making them [slaves] acquainted with it [the Emancipation Proclamation], and for bringing them into our lines,&quot; thereby making emancipation an accomplished fact before a potential next administration could take office.

===Thirteenth Amendment===
When Lincoln accepted the nomination for the Union party for president in June 1864, he called for the first time for the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, to immediately abolish slavery and involuntary servitude, except as punishment for a crime. He wrote in his letter of acceptance that &quot;it would make a fitting and necessary conclusion&quot; to the war and would permanently join the causes of &quot;Liberty and Union.&quot; He won re-election on this platform in November, and in December, 1864, Lincoln worked to have the House approve the amendment.

When the House passed the 13th amendment on January 31, 1865, Lincoln signed the amendment, although this was not a legal requirement, and said in a speech the next day, &quot;He thought all would bear him witness that he had never shrunk from doing all that he could to eradicate slavery by issuing an emancipation proclamation.&quot; He pointed out that the emancipation proclamation did not complete the task of eradicating slavery; &quot;But this amendment is a King&#x27;s cure for all the evils [of slavery].&quot;

===Second inaugural address===
Lincoln, having gotten the constitutional amendment to abolish slavery through Congress, began his second term. He discussed slavery throughout his second inaugural address, describing it as not only the cause of the Civil War, but claiming that, as an offense to God, it drew God&#x27;s righteous judgment against the entire nation.

===Compensated emancipation: buy out the slave owners===
The Thirteenth Amendment, which abolished slavery, provided no compensation to slave owners, but previously, President Lincoln had made numerous proposals to the loyal border states to agree to &quot;compensated emancipation.&quot; None did. The only area of the country that would ever receive compensated emancipation would be Washington, D.C. Because Washington, D.C., was under federal jurisdiction, Congress was able pass the District of Columbia Compensated Emancipation Act.

President Lincoln advocated that slave owners be compensated for emancipated slaves. On March 6, 1862, President Lincoln, in a message to the U.S. Congress, proposed that Congress adopt a Joint Resolution stating that &quot;any state which may adopt gradual abolishment of slavery&quot; should be given &quot;pecuniary aid ... to compensate for the inconveniences public and private, produced by such a change of system&quot;. Congress adopted the resolution. On July 12, 1862, President Lincoln, in a conference with congressmen from the four border states of Kentucky, Maryland, Delaware, and Missouri, urged that their respective states adopt emancipation legislation that compensated slave owners. On July 14, 1862, President Lincoln sent a bill to Congress that would have allowed the Treasury to issue bonds at 6% interest to states for slave emancipation compensation to slave owners. The bill never came to a vote.

In the Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation, issued on September 22, 1862, Lincoln stated, &quot;That it is my purpose, upon the next meeting of Congress to again recommend ... tendering pecuniary aid to the free acceptance of all slave-states, so called, the people whereof may not then be in rebellion against the United States, and which states, may then have voluntarily adopted, or thereafter may voluntarily adopt, immediate, or gradual abolishment of slavery...&quot;

In his December 1, 1862, Annual Message to Congress, Lincoln proposed a constitutional amendment that would provide federal compensation, in the form of interest-bearing U.S. bonds, to any state that voluntarily abolished slavery before the year 1900. It also provided, &quot;Any State having received bonds ... and afterwards reintroducing or tolerating slavery therein, shall refund to the United States the bonds so received, or the value thereof, and all interest paid thereon.&quot; Giving the states the option to reintroduce slavery meant that Lincoln was offering to end the war without slavery ever permanently ending.

As late as the Hampton Roads Conference in 1865, Lincoln met with Confederate leaders and proposed a &quot;fair indemnity,&quot; possibly $500,000,000, in compensation for emancipated slaves.

===Colonization===
Like many self-styled moderates, Abraham Lincoln supported the voluntary colonization (resettlement) of African Americans outside the United States, notably in Liberia. Historians have disputed his motivation, with scholars such as James McPherson, David Reynolds, and Allen Guelzo arguing that Lincoln advocated colonization of the freedpeople in order to assuage racist concerns about the Emancipation Proclamation. Other historians, such as Phillip W. Magness, Richard Blackett, Phillip Paludan, and Mark E. Neely, Jr., have challenged that contention by highlighting the quiet, even secretive basis of most of Lincoln&#x27;s colonization activity; the lack of falsifiability to any unsubstantiated claim that historical actors did not mean what they said; and the inadequacy, for a deportationist target audience, of Lincoln&#x27;s adherence to African American consent. The author of the one book-length study of black colonization during the Civil War era, Sebastian N. Page, argues that Lincoln believed in colonization to his death, but that the policy failed due to the corruption, controversy, and the inadequate African American interest that it generated.

==== Antebellum Activity (to 1861) ====
Probably present at the 1845 founding of a short-lived Illinois auxiliary to the American Colonization Society (ACS), Lincoln had helped transfer a donation to the latter during his residency in Washington, D.C., as a member of the Thirtieth Congress. In 1852, he made his first recorded remarks on African American resettlement in a eulogy for the president of the ACS (and national statesman), Henry Clay. The next year, he helped an Indiana colonizationist, James Mitchell, who had come to Springfield, Illinois, to rekindle that state&#x27;s colonization movement. In 1854, in his Peoria speech, Lincoln articulated two motifs of his support for colonization: first, the unwillingness of &quot;the great mass of white people&quot; to accept black equality, and second, on a note of qualification, Liberia&#x27;s liability to be overwhelmed by any sizable influx of immigrants. Accordingly, he supported the colonization program of Francis Preston Blair and his sons Frank and Montgomery (until 1860, better-known Republicans than Lincoln), who rejected Liberia in favor of closer destinations in the American tropics.

==== Wartime Provisions (1861-62) ====
In his first annual message to Congress (now known as the State of the Union Address), of December 3, 1861, Lincoln advised Congress to provide for the colonization of free African American people, even if it required the United States to acquire further territory. He encouraged the Thirty-Seventh Congress&#x27;s insertion of voluntary colonization clauses into its District Emancipation and Second Confiscation Acts, intimating that he would not sign those bills unless they contained such a provision. Once Congress had passed this legislation, which it reinforced with a $600,000 fund for colonization, Lincoln appointed his old collaborator, James Mitchell, to an ad hoc position within the Department of the Interior. Together, they arranged his famous meeting of August 14, 1862, with a deputation of black Washingtonians, whom he told, &quot;without the institution of Slavery and the colored race as a basis, the war could not have an existence. It is better for us both, therefore, to be separated.&quot; Civil War historian Jonathan W. White wrote of this meeting, &quot;Few moments in Lincoln’s presidency appear as regrettable as this one... Lincoln’s words were terribly condescending.&quot; Lincoln biographer Michael Burlingame took a more favorable view of Lincoln&#x27;s remarks to his visitors, finding one statement &quot;remarkably empathetic.&quot;

During a series of three cabinet meetings of late September 1862, Lincoln rebuffed Attorney General Edward Bates&#x27;s suggestion of compulsory colonization, but decided to ask Congress, in his second annual message of December 1, 1862, to pass an amendment to the U.S. Constitution to promote black resettlement by treaty with putative host states. Legislators&#x27; lack of response drove Lincoln thereafter to his own public silence on colonization, though he quietly continued to pursue colonization schemes, and in two waves.

==== First-wave schemes: &quot;contract colonies&quot; in Latin America (1861-1864) ====
The president&#x27;s two best-known colonization projects, Linconia (in Chiriquí Province, today in Panama) and the Île-à-Vache (Haiti), would both fail, albeit at different stages of their development, because of Lincoln&#x27;s initial proclivity for pursuing colonization through U.S.- based concessionaires rather than the sovereign states that had granted them their leases.

For over a year from October 1861, Lincoln hoped to found a black colony in the Chiriquí district of what is now Panama, then an outlying part of Colombia. The settlers would mine coal to supply the U.S. Navy, and might even secure isthmian transit from the Atlantic to the Pacific. The president appointed the U.S. senator for Kansas, Samuel Pomeroy, to lead the expedition and choose pioneers from the 13,700 African Americans who applied to join him. Lincoln also signed a contract with Ambrose W. Thompson, the leaseholder of the tract in question, which allowed for tens of thousands of African Americans to immigrate. The secretary of the interior, Caleb B. Smith, also issued Pomeroy $25,000 from the colonization fund, to pay for transportation and equipment.

Lincoln suspended the project in early October 1862, before a single ship had sailed, ostensibly because of diplomatic protests by the governments of Central America, but really because of the uncertainty caused by the Colombian Civil War. The president hoped to overcome these complications by having Congress provide for a treaty with Colombia for African American emigration, much as he outlined in his second annual message, but he shelved the Chiriquí project over the New Year of 1863 when he learned that its stakeholders included not only a personal friend, Richard W. Thompson, but also the new secretary of the interior, John P. Usher.

By way of substitute, on New Year&#x27;s Eve, 1862, Lincoln arranged with a New Orleans businessman, Bernard Kock, to establish a colony on the Île-à-Vache, an island off Haiti. Although the White House subsequently remade the agreement with more trustworthy partners than Kock, the new contractors retained Kock as the supervisor of the settlement, for which more than 400 freed slaves sailed from Fort Monroe, Virginia. Lack of shelter on the island, an outbreak of smallpox, and an ever-growing mistrust between the administration and its contractors doomed the colony. In February 1864, at Lincoln&#x27;s behest, Secretary of War Edwin Stanton dispatched a vessel to rescue the survivors.

====Second-Wave Schemes: Emigration to the European West Indies (1862-1864)====
A critic of the &quot;contract colonies,&quot; the commissioner of emigration, James Mitchell, encouraged Abraham Lincoln to promote African American emigration to British Honduras (Belize) and the British West Indies at large. Separately, the U.S. minister to the Netherlands, James Shepherd Pike, negotiated a treaty for black resettlement in the Dutch West Indies (Suriname). Lincoln believed that by dealing with the comparatively stable European empires, he could avoid some of the problems that had plagued his earlier contracts with private interests.

Lincoln signed an agreement on June 13, 1863, with John Hodge of British Honduras, which authorized colonial agents to recruit ex-slaves and transport them to Belize from the approved ports of Philadelphia, New York City, and Boston. Later that year the Department of the Interior sent John Willis Menard, a free African American clerk who supported colonization, to investigate the site for the government. The scheme petered out when John Usher refused to release funds to the would-be pioneers of Henry Highland Garnet&#x27;s African Civilization Society and when the British Colonial Office banned the recruitment of &quot;contraband&quot; freedpeople for fear that the Confederacy would deem this a hostile act.

==== Final disposition of colonization (1864-65) ====
The question of when Lincoln abandoned colonization, if ever, has aroused debate among historians. The government funded no more colonies after the rescue of the Ile à Vache survivors in early 1864, and Congress repealed most of the colonization funding that July.

Lincoln left no surviving statements in his own hand on the subject during the last two years of his presidency. An entry in the diary of presidential secretary John Hay, dated July 1, 1864, claims that Lincoln had &quot;sloughed off&quot; colonization, though attributes that change to the president&#x27;s frustration with corrupt contractors rather than to any philosophical departure. In the fall of 1864, Lincoln wrote Attorney General Edward Bates to inquire whether the legislation of 1862 allowed him to continue pursuing colonization and to retain Mitchell&#x27;s services irrespective of the loss of funding. General Benjamin F. Butler claimed that Lincoln approached him in 1865, a few days before his assassination, to talk about reviving colonization in Panama. Since the mid-twentieth century, historians have debated the validity of Butler&#x27;s account, as Butler wrote it years after the fact and was prone to exaggerating his prowess as a general. Recently discovered documents prove that Butler and Lincoln did indeed meet on April 11, 1865, though whether and to what extent they talked about colonization is not recorded except in Butler&#x27;s account.

A postwar article by Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles suggested that Lincoln intended to revive colonization in his second term.

===Citizenship and limited suffrage===
In his second term as president, on April 11, 1865, Lincoln gave his last public speech. In it, for the first time publicly, he promoted voting rights for some blacks, stating &quot;It is also unsatisfactory to some that the elective franchise is not given to the colored man. I would myself prefer that it were now conferred on the very intelligent, and on those who serve our cause as soldiers.&quot; John Wilkes Booth, a Southerner and outspoken Confederate sympathizer, attended the speech and became determined to kill Lincoln for supporting citizenship for blacks. Booth assassinated Lincoln three days later.

In analyzing Lincoln&#x27;s position historian Eugene H. Berwanger notes:

==Views on African Americans==
Known as the Great Emancipator, Lincoln was a complicated figure who wrestled with his own views on race. Through changing times, successive generations have interpreted Lincoln&#x27;s views on African Americans differently. According to Henry Louis Gates Jr.: &quot;To apply 20th century beliefs and standards to an America of 1858 and declare Abraham Lincoln a &#x27;racist&#x27; is a faulty formula that unfairly distorts Lincoln&#x27;s true role in advancing civil and human rights. By the standards of his time, Lincoln&#x27;s views on race and equality were progressive and truly changed minds, policy and most importantly, hearts for years to come.&quot;

Lincoln&#x27;s primary audience was white (male) voters. Lincoln&#x27;s views on slavery, race equality, and African-American colonization are often intermixed. During the 1858 debates with Stephen Douglas, Lincoln stated that the &quot;physical difference between the white and black races ... will forever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality&quot;. He added that &quot;there must be the position of superior and inferior, and I, as much as any other man, am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race.&quot; On August 22, 1862, he said to a delegation of five black men whom he&#x27;d invited to the White House:

While president, as the Civil War progressed, Lincoln advocated or implemented anti-slavery policies, including the Emancipation Proclamation and limited suffrage for African Americans, which he had earlier opposed. Former slave and leading abolitionist Frederick Douglass unequivocally regarded Lincoln as sharing &quot;the prejudices of his white fellow-countrymen against the Negro&quot;, but also observed of Lincoln that &quot;in his company, I was never reminded of my humble origin, or of my unpopular color.&quot; According to Douglass, Lincoln &quot;was preeminently the white man&#x27;s President&quot; and also, &quot;emphatically the black man’s President: the first to show any respect to their rights as men&quot;.

Douglass attested to Lincoln&#x27;s genuine respect for him and other blacks, and to the wisdom of Lincoln&#x27;s course of action in obtaining both the preservation of the Union (his sworn duty as president) and the freeing of the slaves. In an 1876 speech at the unveiling of the Freedmen&#x27;s Monument in Memory of Abraham Lincoln (later renamed the Emancipation Memorial), he defended Lincoln&#x27;s actions:

In his past, Lincoln lived in a middle-class, racially mixed neighborhood of Springfield, Illinois; one of his long-time neighbors, Jameson Jenkins (who may have been born a slave), had come from North Carolina and was publicly implicated in the 1850s as a Springfield conductor on the Underground Railroad, sheltering fugitive slaves. In 1861, President-elect Lincoln called on Jenkins to give him a ride to the train depot, where Lincoln delivered his farewell address before leaving Springfield for the last time. Accompanying Lincoln to Washington was a free African American, William Johnson, who acted during the trip as valet, messenger, and bodyguard. Johnson was afterward employed by the White House and then as messenger in the Treasury Department. The two men called on each other for favors. When Johnson contracted fever, probably from Lincoln, and died in 1864, Lincoln satisfied Johnson&#x27;s family debts and paid for his burial and tombstone in Arlington.

When Lincoln arrived at the White House, for the first time in his life he lived within a large community of free African Americans employed there. Many had previously been enslaved or were descendants of slaves, and their success as free people may have influenced Lincoln&#x27;s own thinking. Lincoln is said to have showed these employees &quot;a peculiar care and solicitude,&quot; and it was noted, perhaps surprisingly, that Lincoln treated them &quot;like people&quot;. &quot;He &#x27;sympathized with us colored folks,&#x27; one former servant said, &#x27;and we loved him.&#x27;&quot; White House usher William Slade, who became an &quot;intimate friend,&quot; was often the first person Lincoln asked to review parts of his writings and speeches, likely including drafts of the Emancipation Proclamation.

<text>The Savage Innocents is a 1960 adventure film directed and co-written by Nicholas Ray. Anthony Quinn and Yoko Tani star, with Lee Montague, Marco Guglielmi, Carlo Giustini, Anthony Chinn, and Michael Chow in supporting roles, alongside Peter O&#x27; Toole in an early film role. It was adapted from the novel &quot;Top of the World&quot; by Swiss writer Hans Rüesch.

The film was an international co-production, with British, Italian and French interests involved; in the United States it was released by Paramount Pictures. The film was shot on-location in the Canadian Arctic, Kayak scenes were shot in Ilulissat, Greenland, with interiors shot in Britain&#x27;s Pinewood Studios and in Rome&#x27;s Cinecittà studios. It was entered in the 1960 Cannes Film Festival. The film&#x27;s themes include Inuit survival in the extreme arctic wilderness, as well as their raw existence and struggle to maintain their lifestyle against encroaching civilization.

==Plot==
An Inuk hunter kills a Christian missionary who rejects his traditional offer of food and his wife&#x27;s company. Pursued by white policemen, the Inuk saves the life of one of them, resulting in a final confrontation in which the surviving cop must decide between his commitment to law enforcement and his gratitude to the Inuk.

==Reception==
===Critical===
Eugene Archer gave the film a mixed review in &quot;The New York Times&quot; upon its 1961 release: &quot;Most of the qualities that have made Nicholas Ray one of America&#x27;s most highly praised directors abroad while leaving him relatively unpopular and unknown at home are clearly apparent in &#x27;The Savage Innocents.&#x27;&quot; Describing the movie as &quot;badly cut&quot; and &quot;a bitter drama,&quot; Archer nonetheless found that &quot;Mr. Ray&#x27;s highly individualistic preoccupation with moral tensions expresses itself in a series of unusually provocative scenes&quot; and concluded that this &quot;strange, disturbing drama will leave most of its viewers dissatisfied and some outraged, but few will remain indifferent.&quot;
===Box office===
&quot;Kine Weekly&quot; called it a &quot;money maker&quot; at the British box office in 1960.

==The Mighty Quinn==
Bob Dylan is widely believed to have written the song &quot;Quinn the Eskimo (The Mighty Quinn)&quot; in tribute to Quinn&#x27;s performance.

<text>Harter Fell is a fell in the western part of the English Lake District, located between the Eskdale and Duddon valleys. Its height is There are several walking routes to the summit.

==Topography==
The headwaters of the Esk and Duddon are separated by a ridge falling south west from the summit of Crinkle Crags. This line of high ground continues over many twists and turns for 15 miles, finally meeting the sea on the slopes of Black Combe. From Crinkle Crags the first fells on this ridge are Hard Knott and Harter Fell, separated by Hardknott Pass. From Harter Fell the ridge continues over Green Crag, Great Worm Crag, Yoadcastle, Whitfell, Buck Barrow and Black Combe. Alfred Wainwright considered the latter hills unworthy of inclusion in his influential &quot;Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells&quot;, stating that &quot;south and west from Green Crag the scenery quickly deteriorates. This summit has therefore been taken as the boundary of fellwalking country.&quot; Later guidebook writers have disagreed, adding and the remainder of the range to their main volumes. Wainwright himself later relented and included these lesser hills in a supplementary volume, &quot;The Outlying Fells of Lakeland&quot;.

From the top of the pass a complex series of grassy knolls firms up into a ridge bearing south westward. This steps upward, first over Horsehow Crags and then the impressive gable-end of Demming Crag, before reaching the summit area. Further outcropping rock occurs on all sides, although little of it is of interest to climbers. Notable features are Maiden Castle, Brandy Crag and Mart Crag to the south east and Kepple Crag to the south. To the southwest is a broad and marshy saddle leading onto Green Crag and the moorlands of Birker Fell, the ongoing watershed. The southern and eastern flanks are heavily forested with conifers, legions of Forestry Commission trees sweeping down into the Duddon valley.

Harter Fell appears in most views as a conical hill, unsurprising given its broadly circular contours. Wainwright paid it perhaps the ultimate accolade, stating that &quot;Not many fells can be described as &quot;beautiful&quot;, but the word fits Harter Fell, especially so when viewed from Eskdale.&quot;.

==Summit==
The summit area bears three rocky tors, the middle one of which is the highest. An Ordnance Survey triangulation column stands on the western outcrop. From its summit each of the ring of fells known as the &quot;Eskdale Horseshoe&quot; can be clearly seen: Sca Fell, Scafell Pike, Broad Crag, Great End, Esk Pike, Bow Fell and Crinkle Crags. To the south are the sands of the Duddon estuary and Morecambe Bay, and to the west the Irish Sea and Isle of Man.

==Geology==
Harter Fell offers excellent insights into the structure and composition of the Birker Fell formation of the Ordovician Borrowdale Volcanic Group. The fell is dominantly composed of composite andesite lava flows, with autobrecciated upper surfaces developed in some locations. These are often seen in the field as flat surfaces above steep crags, the crags themselves being formed due to the more crystalline, lower portions of each flow. The dip slope on these flows (~24° WSW) suggests that the formation is in nearly the same orientation now as when it formed. The summit of the fell is composed of one such lava flow, but only a few metres down slope the underlying lava flow is a portion of the Great Whinscale Dacite. This local marker unit conformably overlies an andesitic lapilli tuff and the Little Stand Tuff, a nodular rhyolitic ignimbrite. Below these distinctive rock units the andesite lava flows are seen again. On the northern side of the fell, at approximately 520 – 540 m elevation, a volcaniclastic sandstone unit is intercalated between the flows. Also on the northern slopes of the fell, and lower still at between 450 – 500 m, the lava flows switch to dacitic composition, with distinctive euhedral plagioclase feldspar phenocrysts (1 – 4 mm). The southern slopes of the fell again display the Great Whinscale dacite-tuff sequence, owing to extensive faulting. The very lowest slopes of the fell again revert to andesitic lava flows. In the north-western corner, near the Spothow Gill, a small vein of copper mineralisation has been worked out, and some of the evidence of this Victorian-era mining activity can still be seen.

==Ascents==
From Eskdale Harter Fell can be climbed from Jubilee Bridge in the west or from the summit of Hardknott Pass in the east. From the Duddon, walkers can make use of the car parking at Birks Bridge. This provides a reasonably direct line from the west. An alternative is to start from Fickle Steps and circuit clockwise around the fell to join the path from Jubilee Bridge. Harter Fell forms the final challenge in the Woolpack walk when tackled in its usual direction.

<text>Carrick Rangers Football Club is a semi-professional Northern Irish football club playing in NIFL Premiership. The club, founded in 1939, hails from Carrickfergus, County Antrim and plays its home matches at
Taylors Avenue which is known as the Loughview Leisure Arena due to sponsorship reasons, which is owned by Mid and East Antrim Borough Council. Carrick Rangers main rivals are Larne, with matches between the sides being known as, &quot;The East Antrim Derby.&quot; Ballyclare Comrades are also local rivals.

==History==
The club was formed in 1939, when two teams from the Carrickfergus &amp; District Summer League – Barn Mills and Bubbles decided to merge. In 1940, the new club joined the Belfast Minor League and took up residence at Taylors Avenue, then known as the Barn Field They won the County Antrim Junior Shield in 1941–42 and in 1943 gained admission to the Northern Amateur League, of which they were the champions in 1948–49 and 1951–52. 1952 saw the club&#x27;s elevation to the Intermediate League, necessary ground improvements being made at the Barn Field, now known as Taylors Avenue, and then, following the demise of that competition, to the Irish Alliance in 1954 and eventually the Irish League B Division in 1957. As members of the Alliance, Carrick won the McKelvey Cup, a knock-out cup for league members, in 1956–57.

From 1983 until 2003, the club enjoyed senior status, but reverted to intermediate status when the Irish Premier League was established and the number of senior clubs was reduced from 20 to 16. The club&#x27;s greatest achievement was winning the Irish Cup in 1976, when, as a B Division team they beat Linfield in the final in one of the greatest cup shocks.

On 2 May 2011, the club secured a return to top flight football for the first time since the 1994–95 season, after being crowned champions of Championship 1. However, they were unable to adapt to the step up in quality and lasted only one season in the top flight, finishing the 2011–12 IFA Premiership in last place which resulted in relegation back down to Championship 1 for the 2012–13 season.

On 25 April 2015, Carrick sealed promotion back to the Premiership as champions following a 1–0 win over Dundela.

In the 2015–16 season they performed reasonably well in their first season back in the Premiership for three years winning significantly against the likes of Dungannon Swifts back to back and also on the first day of the season, an incredible 4–3 home victory over champions Crusaders and got draws with Glenavon, Portadown and Linfield. They secured their survival in the NIFL Premiership on the last day of the season after two late goals from Mark Surgeoner and Miguel Chines against Ballinamallard; Miguel&#x27;s goal coming in the 90+3-minute after an incredible acrobatic effort to keep the &#x27;Gers up.

The following season manager Gary Haveron left the club and the Gers appointed former Portadown long time assistant to Ronnie McFall Kieran Harding. Hardings reign was an unsuccessful one with the Amber Army&#x27;s only win coming at a 1–0 win over a struggling Glentoran with the &#x27;Gers losing comfortably most weeks and struggling for any sort of form, most notably losing 4–1 to Ballymena United, losing 4–0 to fellow strugglers Portadown team and 3–0 at home to Dungannon Swifts with Hardings resignation following. The club appointed former Crusaders and Bohemians manager Aaron Callaghan as Hardings replacement. A small upturn in form begun with Callaghan getting more favourable results and improving steadily. The Gers reached to League Cup Final in 2017 after beating Glenavon 1–0 at Mourneview Park but lost 2–0 to David Jeffrey&#x27;s Ballymena United at Seaview on 18 February 2017. Following the cup final, positive results were rare, with the club falling further behind their rivals and starting to come dangerously close to basement team Portadown. Carrick eventually finished 11th and faced a relegation/promotion playoff against championship runners up Institute, which they convincingly won 5–2 on aggregate over the two legs. Following the resignation of Aaron Callaghan after the final game of the regular season, former Larne manager and Cliftonville player David McAlinden was appointed.

Another poor season led the team to 11th in the table; this was followed up by a 6-3 aggregate loss to Newry City in the play offs, which of course meant relegation to the championship. Former Loughgall, Ards and Portadown manager Niall Currie then took over for the 2018–19 season.

Currie&#x27;s side finished second in the Championship in the 2018–19 season behind runaway leaders Larne. This earned them a place in the Promotion play-off, first against third-place finishers Portadown, with the winner earning the right to face Ards, who finished 11th in the Premiership. After beating Portadown in the first round, Currie&#x27;s side went on to beat former side Ards 3-1 on aggregate over two legs to earn promotion back to the top tier.

In December 2019, defender Jerry Thompson committed suicide, aged 24. Tributes flooded in from all areas of the Northern Irish football community and prompted mourning for all in the local game. Following the tragedy, Carrick announced that the number 21 shirt would be retired in his memory.

Currie left the club in May 2021, not specifying a reason behind his resignation, with there being a belief from some of a form of disagreement with the clubs board.

The club appointed former Linfield winger Stuart King as his replacement, who had a successful spell managing NIFL Premier Intermediate League side Banbridge Town. King oversaw Carrick avoiding relegation from the NIFL Premiership in the 2021-22 season, his first in charge. The 2022-23 season saw Carrick secure a commendable place of eighth. King guided Carrick to a seventh-place finish in 2023-24, displaying consistent growth and development. In the relegation group of the split, Carrick won four out of their five games.

==New ownership==
In 2023, the club was acquired by American businessman Michael Smith. Smith, originally from Portland, Oregon, is the Chief Information Officer of Estée Lauder Companies. Smith was quoted as saying, &quot;I am thrilled to join the Carrick Rangers organization and be a part of the Club&#x27;s continued ascension.&quot;

==European record==

Having qualified for the 1976–77 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, the club very creditably defeated Aris Bonnevoie of Luxembourg 4–3 on aggregate in the first round, before going out 9–3 on aggregate to English club Southampton in the second round.

<text>Alvin Derald Etler (February 19, 1913 – June 13, 1973) was an American composer and oboist.

== Career ==
A student of Paul Hindemith, Etler is noted for his highly rhythmic, harmonically and texturally complex compositional style, taking inspiration from the works of Bartók and Copland as well as the dissonant and accented styles of jazz.

Though he played with the Indianapolis Symphony in 1938, he abandoned his orchestral life shortly thereafter to focus on his increasingly successful compositional career (which earned him two Guggenheim Fellowships during this period). In 1942 he joined the faculty at Yale University as conductor of the university band and instructor of wind instruments, where he began his studies with Hindemith. He also taught at Cornell University and University of Illinois before accepting a position at Smith College, which he held until his death.

Notable works include his two woodwind quintets (from 1955 and 1957), a bassoon sonata, the 1963 &quot;Quintet for Brass Instruments&quot;, and &quot;Fragments&quot; for woodwind quartet.

Etler is also the author of &quot;Making Music: An Introduction to Theory&quot;, an introductory-level theory text published posthumously in 1974.

<text>Petru (Peter) I may have been a Voivode (prince) of Moldavia from the end of 1367 to after July 1368. Several historians, including Constantin Rezachevici and Ioan Aurel Pop, believe him to have been the son of prince Ştefan, oldest son of voivode Bogdan I of Moldavia, while others, including historian Juliusz Demel, considered him to be the son of Costea of Moldavia with a daughter of Bogdan I. In the second hypothesis, there was no such voivode of Moldavia in 1367-1368, the first using the regnal name &quot;Petru&quot; being Petru II of Moldavia.

<text>Great Andaman is the main archipelago of the Andaman Islands of India. It comprises seven major islands. From north to south, these are North Andaman, Interview Island, Middle Andaman, Long Island, Baratang Island, South Andaman, and Rutland Island.

==Geography==
South, Middle and North islands are the largest of the entire island group. The islands&#x27; capital, Port Blair, is located on South Andaman.

Great Andaman group is often considered the counterpart to Little Andaman Group, another group of islands in the Andaman&#x27;s.

The Andaman islands consist of four groups:
* Great Andaman 
* Little Andaman
* Ritchie&#x27;s Archipelago
* East Volcano Islands

Narrow creeks split Great Andaman into North Andaman, Middle Andaman, South Andaman and the other major islands. All of these islands are in the form of peaks of a submerged mountain chain. Each island has a central highland surrounded by bordering flat lands sloping in all directions and finally merged into coastal tracts.

== Demographics ==
According to the 2011 census of India, the archipelago had 315,530 inhabitants.

<text>Lumi masking (derived from luminance), also known as psychovisual enhancements or adaptive quantization, is a technique used by video compression software, which reduces quality in very bright or very dark areas of the picture, as quality loss in these areas is less likely to be visible. The reduction in quality (and therefore bit rate) in certain areas of the picture caused by using lumi masking allows more bits to be allocated to the rest of the video, thus improving overall quality. Lumi masking is not perfect, however, and in some cases the degradation in quality it causes is visible.

<text>Giovanna &quot;Vannozza&quot; (dei) Cattanei (13 July 1442 – 24 November 1518) was an Italian woman who was the chief mistress of Cardinal Rodrigo de Borgia, later to become Pope Alexander VI.

==Early life==
Born in 1442, most likely in Mantua, Vannozza moved to Rome where she was landlady of several inns (&quot;Osterie&quot;), at first in the Borgo, then in Campo de&#x27; Fiori. 

==Relations with Rodrigo de Borgia==
Vannozza&#x27;s relationship with Cardinal Rodrigo de Borgia began sometime between 1466 and 1472. She is believed to have married Domenico d&#x27;Arignano, an officer of the Church, perhaps in 1473, possibly at the arrangement of Borgia.

She bore four children whom Borgia openly acknowledged as his:
* Cesare (1475–1507)
* Giovanni (1476–1497), 2nd Duke of Gandia 
* Lucrezia (1480–1519)
* Goffredo (1481–1517)

Domenico died before Giovanni was born. In 1480 Borgia arranged Vannozza&#x27;s marriage to Giorgio di Croce, for whom he had procured a position as apostolic secretary. During the marriage to Giorgio, Vannozza had a son, Ottavio or Ottaviano, who did not live long. In 1486 Giorgio died and Vannozza married Carlo Canale.

American author G. J. Meyer claims that the birth dates of the four in comparison with Alexander&#x27;s known whereabouts actually preclude him having fathered any of them.

==Later life==
After his elevation to the papacy, Borgia&#x27;s passion for Vannozza somewhat diminished, and she subsequently led a very retired life. However, Borgia&#x27;s love for his children by Vannozza remained as strong as ever; it proved, indeed, the determining factor of his whole career. He lavished vast sums on them and lauded them with every honour. She, too, remained the matriarch of the Borgia family and influential during the papacy of Rodrigo Borgia.

Vannozza died in 1518 and was buried in the Basilica of Santa Maria del Popolo in Rome.

Arnold Mathew wrote: 

==In fiction==
In the 2006 Canadian/German film &quot;The Conclave&quot;, she is played by Nora Tschirner. In Showtime&#x27;s 2011 series &quot;The Borgias&quot;, she is played by Joanne Whalley. In &quot;Borgia&quot;, the Canal+ production of the same year created by Tom Fontana, she is played by Assumpta Serna.

<text>Kenneth H. Cooper (born March 4, 1931) is an American doctor of medicine and former Air Force lieutenant colonel from Oklahoma, who pioneered the benefits of doing aerobic exercise for maintaining and improving health. In 1966 he coined the term, and his book &quot;Aerobics&quot; was published in 1968, which emphasized a point system for improving the cardiovascular system. The popular mass market version was &quot;The New Aerobics&quot; (), published ten years later.

A further book - with a more comprehensive approach including for example nutrition as well as exercise, &quot;The Aerobics Program For Total Well-Being&quot; (Bantam Books) - was published in 1982.

==Career==
Born in Oklahoma City, Cooper completed a 13-year military career in both the army and air force. During his Air Force career, he devised the simple Cooper test, which could conveniently and quickly establish the fitness level of large numbers of people. Originally the distance run in 12 minutes, it correlated well with the existing concept of VO2 max. Cooper left the Air Force in 1970, when he and his wife, Millie, moved to Dallas to start his companies.

Cooper is the founder of the non-profit research and education organization, The Cooper Institute®, which was opened in 1970. Cooper is also the founder of and Chairman at the Cooper Aerobics Center in Dallas, which comprises eight health and wellness entities.

Cooper received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 1986.

Cooper developed the Smart Snack Ribbon guidelines in 2003 for the Frito-Lay division of PepsiCo.

Cooper has published 19 books that have sold 30 million copies and been translated into 41 languages. Cooper encouraged millions to become active and helped to launch modern fitness culture. He is known as the &quot;father of aerobics&quot;.

He and his wife are parents of a son, Tyler, and daughter, Berkley. Cooper has written about the importance of Christian religious faith in his life.

He graduated from the University of Oklahoma (BS, MD) and the Harvard School of Public Health (MPH).

==Ideas on exercise and training effect==
Cooper studied the effect of exercise in the late 1960s and popularized the term &quot;training effect&quot; although that term had been used before. The measured effects were that muscles of respiration were strengthened, the heart was strengthened, blood pressure was sometimes lowered and the total amount of blood and number of red blood cells increased, making the blood a more efficient carrier of oxygen. VO2 Max was increased. He published his ideas in a book, &quot;Aerobics&quot; in 1968.

The exercise necessary can be accomplished by any aerobic exercise in a wide variety of schedules - Cooper found it best to award &quot;points&quot; for each amount of exercise and require 30 points a week to maintain the Training Effect.

Cooper instead recommended a &quot;12-minute test&quot; (the Cooper test) followed by adherence to the appropriate starting-up schedule in his book. As always, he recommends that a physical exam should precede any exercise program.

The physiological effects of training have received much further study since Cooper&#x27;s original work. It is now generally considered that effects of exercise on general metabolic rate (post-exercise) are comparatively small and the greatest effect occurs for only a few hours. However it is also generally considered that Aerobic exercise contributes to overall quality of life, particularly in later years. Several studies support an increase in longevity as well. Though endurance training does increase the VO2 max of many people, there is considerable variation in the degree to which it increases VO2 max between individuals.

<text>The Widal test, developed in 1896 and named after its inventor, Georges-Fernand Widal, is an indirect agglutination test for enteric fever or undulant fever whereby bacteria causing typhoid fever are mixed with a serum containing specific antibodies obtained from an infected individual. In cases of &quot;Salmonella&quot; infection, the test assesses for host antibodies to the O soma antigen and the H flagellar antigen of the bacteria. False positive and false negative results may occur. Test results need to be interpreted carefully to account for any history of enteric fever, typhoid vaccination, and the general level of antibodies in the populations in endemic areas of the world. As with all serological tests, the rise in antibody levels needed to perform the diagnosis takes 7–14 days, which limits its applicability in early diagnosis. Other means of diagnosing &quot;Salmonella typhi&quot; (and &quot;paratyphi&quot;) include cultures of blood, urine and faeces. These organisms produce H2S from thiosulfate and can be identified easily on differential media such as bismuth sulfite agar. Typhidot is the other test used to ascertain the diagnosis of typhoid fever. A new serological test called the Tubex test is neither superior nor better performing than the Widal test. Therefore, Tubex test is not recommended for diagnosis of typhoid fever.

2-mercaptoethanol is often added to the Widal test. This agent more easily denatures the IgM class of antibodies, so if a decrease in the titer is seen after using this agent, it means that the contribution of IgM has been removed leaving the IgG component. This differentiation of antibody classes is important as it allows for the distinction of a recent (IgM) from an old infection (IgG).

The Widal test is positive if TO antigen titer is more than 1:160 in an active infection, or if TH antigen titer is more than 1:160 in past infection or in immunized persons. A single Widal test is of little clinical relevance especially in endemic areas such as Indian subcontinent, Africa and South-east Asia. This is due to recurrent exposure to the typhoid causing bacteria, immunization and high chances of cross-reaction from infections, such as malaria and non typhoidal salmonella. 

If no other tests (either bacteriologic culture or more specific serology) are available, a fourfold increase in the titer (e.g., from 1:40 to 1:640) in the course of the infection, or a conversion from an IgM reaction to an IgG reaction of at least the same titer, would be consistent with a typhoid infection. The normal widal ranges are 1:20 and 1:80, these are in the normal range anything more is a concern and you should seek medical consulation.

<text>Coagh United Football Club is an intermediate, Northern Irish football club playing in the NIFL Premier Intermediate League. The club, founded in 1970, hails from Coagh, near Cookstown, County Tyrone. They play their home games at Hagan Park.

==A Brief History==

Coagh United clinched the third-tier championship of Northern Irish football, which is now known as the NIFL Premier Intermediate League, in the 2003–04 season. 
They were crowned champions of the third-tier for a second time in the 2011–12 season after an intense title race with Dundela and Knockbreda F.C..

In 2016 the club was relegated from the Northern Ireland Football League.
The club would make their return for the 2023/24 season following a play-off win against Mid-Ulster Football League champions Oxford Sunnyside. A last minute goal would spark jubilant celebrations amongst players and supporters.

The club is noted for being the first club of Leeds United and Northern Ireland player Stuart Dallas, he played for the club between 2007 and 2010, when he left to join Premiership side Crusaders.

In the 2022–23 season, Coagh United emerged as the champions of the Ballymena &amp; Provincial Football League. This entered them into a play-off for promotion to the Premier Intermediate with Oxford Sunnyside and Rathfriland Rangers, who had won the Mid-Ulster League and NAFL Premier Division respectively. In the end, Rathfriland and Coagh earned promotion to the NIFL Premier Intermediate League. Upon their return to the third tier of Northern Irish football, Coagh would end the season in 7th place in what was a difficult season.

<text>Denemo is a scorewriter and music sequencer. Denemo has been under development since 1999.

Denemo helps prepare notation for publishing and lets a user rapidly enter notation, simultaneously typesetting via the LilyPond music engraver. Music can be typed in using a PC keyboard, taken from MIDI input, or played into a microphone plugged into a soundcard. The program plays back via an internal sampler and can act as a JACK/MIDI client. Denemo includes scripts to run music tests and practice exercises for educational purposes.

== Features ==
Denemo can output entire scores (including Table of Contents and Critical Commentary automatically generated from comments placed in the music) as well as excerpts in a number of formats, including:
* LilyPond files (.ly)
* MusicXML files (.musicxml)
* PDF files
* MIDI files
* WAV, OGG audio files
* PNG graphic files

The program allows the user to place links in the music to original source manuscripts/prints (in PDF files) allowing cross-checking of transcriptions. It also allows audio recordings to be linked to a notated score with synchronization via automatically detected note-onsets; the notated score and audio are played back simultaneously and can be slowed down in real time to listen for discrepancies.

Denemo has all the music notation functions accessible via keyboard shortcuts. However, everything can be accessed by mouse, and both one- and two- key keyboard shortcuts can be created easily by the user for the task at hand. WYSIWYG manipulations can be performed in the typeset view, e.g. interactively re-shaping slurs. A Scheme scripting interface is also available, and commands written in Scheme can be placed in the menu system or dockable palettes.

<doc id="1345914" wikidata="Q1377799" url="?curid=1345914" title="Mushi Production">
<text>or Mushi Pro for short, is a Japanese animation studio headquartered in Fujimidai, Nerima, Tokyo, Japan. It previously had a headquarters elsewhere in Nerima.

The studio was headed by manga artist Osamu Tezuka. Tezuka started it as a rivalry with Toei Animation, his former employer, after Tezuka&#x27;s contract with Toei expired in 1961. The studio pioneered TV animation in Japan, and was responsible for many successful anime television series, such as &quot;Astro Boy&quot;, &quot;Gokū no Daibōken&quot;, &quot;Princess Knight&quot;, &quot;Kimba the White Lion&quot;, &quot;Dororo&quot; and &quot;Ashita no Joe&quot;, as well as more adult-oriented feature films such as &quot;A Thousand and One Nights&quot;, &quot;Cleopatra&quot; (the first Japanese X-rated animated film) and &quot;Belladonna of Sadness&quot;.

In addition to doing their anime productions, Mushi was best known for its overseas work on five traditionally animated TV projects from Arthur Rankin, Jr. and Jules Bass&#x27; Videocraft International (now Rankin/Bass Productions) in New York, New York, including the Christmas special &quot;Frosty the Snowman&quot;, with the production artwork being done by Paul Coker, Jr., along with the animation supervision by Yusaku &quot;Steve&quot; Nakagawa.

Morisawa argues that Tezuka &quot;proposed an unrealistically suppressed production budget... in an attempt to outbid his competitors&quot;, a budget that contributed to the Studio&#x27;s (and industry at the time) low profitability. Mushi, plagued by financial difficulties, declared bankruptcy in 1973 and its assets were divided. Tezuka had already left the company by then, having stepped down as acting director in 1968 and formed a new animation studio, Tezuka Productions (which made such works as &quot;Marvelous Melmo&quot; and &quot;Unico&quot;). The company was later reestablished on November 26, 1977, and has continued to operate as &quot;legacy company&quot;.

<text>Keith Andrew Palmer (born 21 March 1967), better known by his stage name Maxim (previously Maxim Reality), is a British musician, known for being a vocalist of electronic music band The Prodigy.

==Pre-Prodigy history==
Keith Andrew Palmer was born in Peterborough to Jamaican parents. He enjoyed writing poetry and verse and began MCing around the age of 14. He gained inspiration from his ten-years-older MC brother, Hitman, who introduced him into the Peterborough Reggae Soundsystem Scene. At the age of seventeen he had his first gig in Basingstoke. Ian Sherman, a fellow musician from Nottingham teamed up with Maxim and they formed &#x27;Maxim and Sheik YanGroove&#x27;. After recording some tracks together without attracting much attention, Maxim left and went on a three-month travel throughout Europe and North Africa. Upon returning to England he moved to London to get involved in the music and reggae scene. His prior stage name, &quot;Maxim Reality&quot;, was a reference to his interest in lyrics based on real issues.

==MC of the Prodigy==
Maxim lived near Keith Flint, a fan of Liam Howlett. After convincing Howlett to start a band, Flint recommended Maxim as a manager on the strength of Maxim&#x27;s experience in the reggae scene and the music contacts he developed. Maxim did not show up at a scheduled meeting but joined them unexpectedly at their next gig, improvising lyrics. After MCing, Maxim contributed lyrics to studio albums after &quot;Experience&quot; from 1992 (although his vocal contributions were heard in the live track &quot;Death of the Prodigy Dancers&quot; on &quot;Experience&quot;). Maxim provided lyrics in the single &quot;Poison&quot; from &quot;Music for the Jilted Generation&quot; (1994), &quot;Breathe&quot; and the canned single release &quot;Mindfields&quot;, both from &quot;The Fat of the Land&quot; (1997). However, Maxim was absent from the Prodigy album &quot;Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned&quot; from 2004; Howlett said he believed the band needed to reinvent itself, without vocals from Flint or Maxim. Despite rumours to the contrary, the band did not break up, though Maxim explored a solo career. On &quot;Invaders Must Die&quot;, Maxim returned as a vocalist, as the band reverted to its prior way of working.

==Solo projects==
After the Prodigy&#x27;s intense touring to support &quot;The Fat of the Land&quot;, Maxim worked on his solo projects, and in 1998 he released &quot;Dog Day&quot; on the XL Recordings compilation CD &quot;Against the Grain&quot;, which also featured Howlett&#x27;s &quot;Dirtchamber Remix&quot; of &quot;Diesel Power&quot; (from &quot;The Fat of the Land&quot;). Also in 1998, Maxim&#x27;s cover version of the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Factory Girl&quot; was released on the Beggars Banquet compilation CD, &quot;21 Beggars Banquet&quot;. On 9 August 1999, Maxim released the EP &quot;My Web&quot;, which contained five tracks. In 2000, Maxim collaborated with Skin from Skunk Anansie on the song &quot;Carmen Queasy&quot;, which remains his biggest solo success, peaking at number 33 on the UK singles chart in June that year. Maxim released a second single, &quot;Scheming&quot;, on 11 September 2000, which reached number 53 on the UK singles chart, and released his debut album, &quot;Hell&#x27;s Kitchen&quot;, on 2 October 2000. Maxim&#x27;s second solo album, &quot;Fallen Angel&quot;, was released in 2005 and spawned one single, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Care&quot;, which failed to chart. The album was released on multiple formats, including a limited-edition CD.

Maxim has performed as a DJ and in 2013 had his first United States DJ tour. He&#x27;s quoted as saying, &quot;DJing for me is a completely fresh challenge—it gives me the opportunity to play music I’m into. I love the spontaneity, its freestyle form.&quot; Maxim&#x27;s DJing was inspired by trap, and in 2014 he collaborated with Cianna Blaze and producer Blaze Billions to create and release original tracks that he could DJ, released under the name &#x27;We Are Noize&#x27;. In an interview, Maxim said that the collaboration was a &#x27;collective&#x27;, not a new band. 

In September 2019, Maxim signed an exclusive global publishing deal with Peermusic that includes their partnership on Maxim&#x27;s &quot;Red Room Arts&quot; publishing company. In December 2019, Maxim&#x27;s third solo album &quot;Love More&quot; was released on the Red Room Arts record label. 

==Art==
Using the pseudonym MM (Double M) for his mixed media artworks made with materials that include items like pills, blades, needles and bullets, Maxim&#x27;s first exhibition was named &quot;Lepidop Terror&quot; and held in September 2011 at INC Space in London&#x27;s Covent Garden. Some of his artwork is displayed online at Taylor Barnes Gallery. Maxim has donated pieces of his artwork to fundraising causes including in 2020 the &quot;heART &amp; Soul Auction&quot; for &quot;Arms Around the Child&quot; and the online anti-racism exhibition &quot;United for Change&quot; hosted by Artnet to raise funds for the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust in the UK and &quot;Underground Museum&quot; and &quot;For Freedoms&quot; in the US.

<text>A sour is a traditional family of mixed drinks. &quot;Sours&quot; belong to one of the old families of original cocktails and are described by Jerry Thomas in his 1862 book &quot;How to Mix Drinks&quot;. 

Sours are mixed drinks containing a base liquor, lemon or lime juice, and a sweetener (simple syrup or orgeat syrup). Egg whites are also included in some sours.

==Types of sours==

===Gin sour===
The gin sour is a traditional mixed cocktail that predates Prohibition in the United States. It is a simple combination of gin, lemon juice, and sugar. Adding carbonated water to this turns it into a gin fizz.

It was popular during the 1940s, and Kevin Starr includes it in &quot;an array of drinks (the gin sour, the whiskey sour, the gin Rickey, the Tom Collins, the pink lady, the old fashioned) that now seem period pieces, evocative of another era&quot;.

===Pisco sour===

The classic pisco sour recipe contains pisco brandy (usually an un-aged grape brandy from Perú), fresh lime juice, fresh lemon juice, simple syrup, egg white, and bitters. It is shaken, strained, and served straight in a cocktail glass then garnished with the bitters (cinnamon can be used). The addition of egg white creates a foamy head when shaken before serving. While pisco sour is flavoured with key lime by default, pisco is combined with other fruit to create mango sour, maracuya (passion fruit) sour, lucuma sour and so forth. Peru has a National Pisco Sour Day (which lasts a weekend) in mid-February, and Chile has Pisco Day in mid-May.

===Rum sour===

The basic Daiquiri, sometimes called a Daiquiri sour, is made with rum, lime juice and simple syrup. One account of the drink&#x27;s origin is that the general manager of the Spanish-American Iron Core Company, which operated the &quot;Daiquiri&quot; mine, ran out of gin one night when making gin sour for his guests, and switched to rum. This rum sour became known as the Daiquiri. However, earlier printed recipes for rum sour exist such as one from Jerry Thomas from 1887.

===Whiskey sour===

The whiskey sour is a mixed drink containing bourbon whiskey or rye whiskey, lemon juice, sugar, and optionally a dash of egg white to make it a Boston Sour. It is shaken and served either straight or over ice. The traditional garnish is half an orange slice and a maraschino cherry. If floated with claret red wine it&#x27;s called a New York sour.

A notable variant of the whiskey sour is the Ward 8, which often is based with either bourbon or rye whiskey, both lemon and orange juices, and grenadine syrup as the sweetener. The egg white sometimes employed in other whiskey sours is generally not included in this variation.

===Other sours===
* Amaretto sour: Amaretto liqueur, lemon juice and sometimes egg white, bitters or sugar syrup.
* Brandy sour or brandy daisy (Jerry Thomas, 1887): brandy, clear or orange curaçao, sugar, lemon juice, shaken and strained into a wine glass.
* Caipirinha: Cachaça, sugar, lime, ice in an old fashioned glass.
* Cypriot brandy sour: Cyprus brandy, lemon cordial and bitters, stirred in a tall glass, and topped with soda or lemonade.
* Midori sour: Honeydew melon liquor, grenadine, lemon juice. Poured properly, it resembles a green tequila sunrise with visible layers.
* Santa Cruz sour (Jerry Thomas, 1887): Santa Cruz rum, sugar, lemon juice, shaken and strained into a wine glass.
* Tequila sour: Tequila, lemon juice, lime juice, agave nectar, Bittercube Corazon bitters, egg white.

<text>Istanbul Park (), also known as the Istanbul Racing Circuit or initially as the Istanbul Otodrom, is a motor sports race track in the Tuzla district of Istanbul, Turkey. Designed by Hermann Tilke, it opened on 19–21 August 2005. It has been called &quot;the best race track in the world&quot; by former Formula One Chief Executive Bernie Ecclestone, who held the managing rights of the circuit between 2007 and 2011. The circuit was then managed by the Turkish company Intercity since October 2012 to March 2024. The operating rights were given to Can Bilim Eğitim Kurumları A.Ş. in April 2024 for 30 years.

==Description==

The venue of the Turkish Grand Prix is located in the crossing of boundaries of Pendik and Tuzla districts on the Asian side of Istanbul, close to the junction of Kurtköy on the north side of the O–4 motorway, linking Istanbul to Ankara; and close to the junction of Istanbul Park on the south side of the O–7 motorway. It is near Sabiha Gökçen International Airport and is surrounded by forests and fields.
The Istanbul Park racing circuit was one of only seven circuits running anticlockwise in the 2021 Formula One season, the others being the Imola Circuit (used for the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix), the Baku City Circuit (used for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix), Circuit of the Americas (used for the United States Grand Prix), the Interlagos Circuit (used for the Brazilian Grand Prix), the Jeddah Corniche Circuit (used for the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix), and the Yas Marina Circuit (used for the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix). This unusual anti-clockwise layout leads to increased strain on the other side of the driver&#x27;s neck than they would experience at most other circuits, especially through the long high-speed left-hander at turn 8.
The circuit is long, with an average width of ranging from , and covers over . With a total of 14 corners, the sharpest with a radius of merely , the circuit runs over four different ground levels with a start/finish straight over in length.
The track can hold about 125,000 spectators. The main grandstand has a seating capacity of 25,000 spectators, with natural ground stands and temporary stands allowing for around 100,000 more. The paddock buildings are two-level structures; the ground floor reserved for racing teams, the upper floor serving as hospitality areas with 5,000 seats. At each end of the paddock, there are two 7-story VIP towers.

Turn 8 (nicknamed &quot;Diabolica&quot; by some in reference to Monza&#x27;s &quot;Curva Parabolica&quot;) particularly caught the imagination. The corner is a fast, sweeping corner with four apexes, similar to one of the multi-apex sections of the old Nürburgring. Spectators and drivers alike raved about Turn 8, comparing it to legendary corners such as Eau Rouge and 130R. The corner eventually became the basis of some of Tilke&#x27;s newer track turns, such as turns 17 and 18 at the Circuit of the Americas, turn 3 at the Sochi Autodrom, and Buddh International Circuit&#x27;s turns 10 to 11. The high loads exerted through this corner contribute to the circuit&#x27;s reputation for rapid tyre wear.

Another notable corner is Turn 1, a sharp downhill left-hander immediately after the front straight. This corner has been nicknamed by some as the &quot;Turkish Corkscrew&quot; in reference to the famous &quot;Corkscrew&quot; at WeatherTech Raceway Laguna Seca. Both the 2006 F1 and MotoGP races at the circuit featured multiple incidents at this corner. A third noteworthy area is the uphill kink in the middle of the back straight; due to its similarity to Eau Rouge, it has been jokingly referred to as &quot;Faux Rouge&quot;.

The circuit is not, however, without its critics. After qualifying, Jenson Button claimed that the track was getting bumpier as the weekend went on, particularly at Turn 8, which was what caused so many drivers to spin off. This harks back to another circuit designed by Hermann Tilke, Shanghai International Circuit, which is said to be sinking in places because it was built on the site of a former swamp. Jarno Trulli was notable for his lukewarm feeling towards the circuit, saying that he felt the circuit was easy to learn, and that good performance was down more to the car than the driver.

==Major motorsport events==

===Formula One===

The first Grand Prix of Turkey took place in 2005. Due to financial disagreement, the last Turkish Grand Prix took place in 2011, despite earlier reports that the event would take place until at least 2021. The top speed measured of an F1 car by the speed trap was in 2005. F1 cars equipped with the smaller 2.4-litre V8 engines (instead of the 3.0-litre V10s of previous years) reached in 2006. Felipe Massa has an affinity with this circuit, with the Brazilian winning three of the nine Grands Prix held at Istanbul Park with Lewis Hamilton winning two and Sebastian Vettel, Jenson Button, Kimi Räikkönen and Valtteri Bottas having won one race each.

Istanbul Park returned for the 2020 Formula One World Championship, after a nine-year absence.

Istanbul Park was due to replace the cancelled Canadian Grand Prix for the 2021 Formula One World Championship. Then it was postponed indefinitely due to Covid-19 travel restrictions imposed on the country by the UK government and was replaced by the Styrian Grand Prix. It was later re-added to the 2021 calendar in place of the cancelled Singapore Grand Prix.

===GP2===
In 2006, the winner of the GP2 race was Nelson Piquet Jr., however the real battle was with Lewis Hamilton who, at the beginning of the race, spun off and dropped right down the field from 2nd to 16th. However he raced his way back through the pack with some spectacular overtaking moves to finish in second.

Fifteen racers completed the race in 2009 while eleven drivers were not classified. The winner was Russian Vitaly Petrov of Barwa Addax, who moved up to second place in the championship table with 29 points ahead of Jérôme d&#x27;Ambrosio having 18 points. Petrov&#x27;s teammate Romain Grosjean, who retired from the race, was leading the championship with 31 points. The Italians Luca Filippi of Super Nova Racing and Davide Valsecchi of Durango finished second and third in the race.

===MotoGP===

MotoGP raced at Istanbul Park for three years between 2005 and 2007. Marco Melandri won the races in 2005 and 2006 with the 2007 race being won by Casey Stoner. After the venue was taken over by now ex-Formula One chief executive Bernie Ecclestone in 2007, the venue was dropped from the 2008 calendar.

===Other motorsport events===
The first leg of the 2012 FIA European Truck Racing Championship was held on 13 May 2012 at Istanbul Park. The Superbike World Championship raced at the track in 2013. The FIA World Rallycross Championship has organized the World RX of Turkey at Istanbul Park in 2014–2015 and 2024, using an area to the outside of turns 12, 13, 14.

Donegal Celtic was formed in 1970 when a group of young men who had a huge interest in football decided to form a team in the Lenadoon district of west Belfast.

With no facilities, kits, pitch or equipment, the first few years were spent playing friendlies and entering local summer competitions, which helped to enhance and promote their reputation and name. They registered their chosen name with the Irish Football League, taking the name from the area in which they were based; Lenadoon, Gweedore, Glenveagh are all local areas named after towns in County Donegal, with the Celtic part being taken on due to the massive local following for Scotland&#x27;s Celtic and, until 1949, Belfast Celtic.

The club has a youth setup, covering boys&#x27; age groups U10 – U18, and a girl&#x27;s set-up at U14. Donegal Celtic Ladies senior side won the &#x27;Belfast Cup&#x27; in 2004.

The club&#x27;s senior men&#x27;s team has a chequered and colourful history. After continually applying for Irish League entry they were denied on several occasions and forced to play amateur football, along with County Armagh team Lurgan Celtic. A 1990 cup tie at Linfield involved ground unrest. With accusations of a sectarian selection process and with the threat of court action looming , both clubs finally gained entry into the Irish League 2nd Division for the 2002–03 season.

The club managed to finish in 6th place in their first year in the Irish League proper, which due to a league shake-up was enough to earn promotion to the First Division. The club&#x27;s second season in Irish League football was marred by poor home form and an inability to cope with the change in standard, finishing in 8th place.

Donegal Celtic finished the 2004–05 season in 3rd place losing out on a promotion play-off place to Lurgan club Glenavon and also lost the IFA Intermediate Cup final on penalties to the same team at Stangmore Park, Dungannon. The club&#x27;s fortunes improved following the establishment of a management structure of Paddy Kelly, Marty McKiernan and Gerard Loughran. In the 2005–06 season, the club finished as runners-up to Crusaders in the league, earning the right to play over two legs for a place in the Premier League, which they achieved on 10 May 2006 with a 3–1 aggregate victory against Institute. The team also managed to capture the Intermediate Cup, defeating Coagh United 2–0 in the final.

The next few seasons would see the club going through managerial turmoil, changing managers seven times in four years. Paddy Kelly resigned as manager before the 2009–10 season started, with former Cliftonville and Coleraine player Pat McAllister replacing him. In June 2010, a few weeks after guiding the club&#x27;s return into the top flight for the 2010–11 IFA Premiership season with a 1–0 aggregate win over Institute in the promotion play-off, McAllister agreed a new deal to stay as manager for the 2010–11 season. However, less than a month later he shocked the club by resigning, citing personal reasons for his decision.

Marty Tabb, a former Cliftonville captain and manager, took over for the start of the 2010–11 season. However, in September 2010, he was sacked after only 74 days in charge. Paddy Kelly then returned to the club for a second spell as manager. He resigned for the second time in January 2012, along with a number of coaches and the entire club committee, due to an internal club dispute.

Former Carrick Rangers boss Stephen Small was appointed Kelly&#x27;s successor a few days later. However, Small&#x27;s tenure would not be a successful one. The club suffered a run of 15 league games without a win, which included 12 defeats and 3 draws. They were also knocked out of the 2012–13 Irish League Cup at home, by IFA Championship 1 outfit Harland &amp; Wolff Welders. Small resigned in September 2012, citing poor results and personal pressures as the reasons for his departure. Reserve team manager Declan McGreevy, a former Ards and Ballymena United player, was appointed as the club&#x27;s next manager on 11 October 2012. Ten days later however, McGreevy was forced to stand down from the post as he did not possess the required UEFA &#x27;A&#x27; licence to manage an IFA Premiership club. Former manager Pat McAllister was immediately announced as McGreevy&#x27;s replacement, returning to the club for a second spell as manager. The club was also involved in some controversy that season, when they were deducted 3 points and fined £500 for fielding a suspended player in a 2–1 win over Lisburn Distillery – the result was changed to a 3–0 loss. The club maintained that the IFA had given them verbal clearance for the player to take part in the match, but did not appeal the decision.

The club ended the season in the relegation play-off place (11th), and faced the runners-up of Championship 1, Warrenpoint Town, for a place in next season&#x27;s Premiership. The tie ended 2–2 on aggregate with Warrenpoint Town winning on the away goals rule. This relegated Donegal Celtic to the second tier. In August 2013, five days prior to the start of the 2013–14 NIFL Championship season – the club&#x27;s first season return in the second tier, manager Pat McAllister along with his entire backroom staff and several first team players all quit the club following a club meeting. McAllister stated that he could no longer work under the conditions and restrictions that were imposed during the meeting as a result of the club&#x27;s difficult financial situation. Former Donegal Celtic player Paul McAreavey was announced as the club&#x27;s new manager a few days later. McAreavey left after one season, in which the club finished 11th, to be replaced by Nicky Maye, a member of the coaching staff.

Under Maye the team continued to struggle, finishing one point above relegation for the 2014–15 season. Maye continued as manager for the following season, but after a poor start and with the club bottom of the table without a single league win, Maye&#x27;s departure was announced in October 2015. Gerry Bradley, a member of the coaching staff and former player for the club, was confirmed as his successor soon afterwards. However Bradley resigned soon after his appointment. Former Chimney Corner F.C. manager Stephen Hatfield was appointed his successor in late December 2015. However, the team continued to struggle in the second tier, with Celtic&#x27;s relegation to the third tier confirmed in March 2016 after only 19 games of the 2015–16 season played. At the time their relegation was confirmed, the team had amassed a meagre 3 points and had failed to win a single league game all season, leaving them 23 points away from safety with only 7 games and 21 points left to play for.

For the 2016–17 season, the club competed in the third tier, for the first time since the 2002–03 season, finishing third.

Subsequent relegation in 2018 found the club in the fourth tier, where it continues to play.

<doc id="1345951" wikidata="Q2542326" url="?curid=1345951" title="Ringstead, Northamptonshire">
<text>Ringstead is a village and civil parish in Northamptonshire, England, forming part of North Northamptonshire. It is located approximately north-east of Northampton. At the time of the 2011 census, the parish&#x27;s population was 1,461 people. The local primary school is situated next to St Mary&#x27;s Church, which is host to the Ringstead Flower Festival.

==History==
The village&#x27;s name means &#x27;Ring place&#x27;. The meaning of the name here is obscure.

Ringstead was the birthplace of:
*William Tuttle, who settled in Charlestown, Massachusetts in 1636. His descendants number in the tens of thousands today. Notable among them are: Ernest Hemingway, Bob Newhart, Sinclair Lewis, Humphrey Bogart, Winston Churchill, Gerald Ford, Lester B. Pearson, Jonathan Edwards, O. Henry, Margaret Warner, Drew Gilpin Faust, Norman Rockwell &amp; Annette Bening
*Alfred Roberts, the father of Margaret Thatcher.

According to tradition, the entrance to St Mary&#x27;s churchyard has been haunted by the ghost of a village girl, Lydia Atley, who disappeared in 1850. What were thought to be her skeletal remains were unearthed in 1864 in a local orchard; the village butcher, Weekly Ball, was tried for Lydia&#x27;s murder but acquitted because it proved impossible to conclusively identify the skeleton as that of the missing girl.

During the 1980s, major sand and gravel excavations took place all around Ringstead leaving many man-made lakes and islands.

In 2007, Ringstead, Hargrave, Raunds and Stanwick were legally united as &quot;The 4 Spires Benefice&quot;, with each village retaining its own church.

== Heritage assets ==

The following buildings and structures are listed by Historic England as of special architectural or historic interest.

*Church of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary (Grade I) 12th century 
*Slade Farmhouse (Grade II) 17th century 
*Manor House (Grade II) 18th century 
*5, 7 and 9 Denford Road (Grade II) 18th century 
*War memorial (Grade II) 20th century 

==Demography==

*In 1801 there were 454 persons
*In 1831 there were 620 persons
*In 1841 there were 640 persons
*In 2011 there were 1,461 persons

==Sport==

===Football===

The village has a relatively successful sporting tradition in football. They have had a team representing the village for over 100 years since it was established in 1896. Ringstead Rangers includes a men&#x27;s team, a men&#x27;s reserve team, an under 17s, under 14s and an under 9s team. All the teams play their home matches at Ringstead Recreational Ground and their traditional strip colours consist of red and black. The teams have been known to sport various other strip colours, especially in their away strips, including orange, blue and pink.

===Social club===

Activities at the Village Social Club include pool; the team currently plays in Division 3 of the East Northamptonshire League. It also has a skittles team and facilities for darts, bingo and dominoes.

===Water-related activities===

The River Nene runs past the village in a series of locks. A National Lottery funded cycle, bridle and footpath track runs between Stanwick Lakes and Islip, the Nene Way running through the area all offering easy walking. Ringstead has a very large boating community and features over 250 river craft moored at Willy Watt Marina and Blackthorn Lake Marina.

<text>The Des Moines Art Center is an art museum with an extensive collection of paintings, sculpture, modern art and mixed media. It was established in 1948 in Des Moines, Iowa.

==History==
The Art Center traces its roots to 1916, when the Des Moines Association of Fine Arts established gallery space at the Public Library of Des Moines on the banks of the Des Moines River downtown. Several exhibitions were shown each year, and works of art were periodically purchased for the association&#x27;s permanent collection. In 1938, the DMAF moved their collection to a building on Walnut Street. Planning for a permanent building began in 1943 after a sizeable donation from the trust of James D. Edmundson. In 1945, DMAF evolved into the Des Moines Art Center. A site along Grand Avenue in the city&#x27;s Greenwood Park was designated as the preferred location. Construction began in 1945; the museum itself opened in 1948, with additional wings constructed in 1968 and 1985.

In 2009, the Art Center expanded its mission to operate the Pappajohn Sculpture Park, located in Western Gateway Park downtown.

==Collection==
Artists included in the permanent collection are Edward Hopper, Jasper Johns, Andy Warhol, Henri Matisse, Claude Monet, Francis Bacon, Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe, Gerhard Richter, Claes Oldenburg, Mary Cassatt, Auguste Rodin, Grant Wood, Deborah Butterfield, Paul Gauguin, Eva Hesse, Ronnie Landfield, Roy Lichtenstein, George Segal, Mark Rothko, John Singer Sargent, Joseph Cornell and Takashi Murakami.

Some paintings from the collection are well known examples of the artist and/or movement they represent. These include Edward Hopper&#x27;s &quot;Automat&quot; from 1927, which was reproduced on a postage stamp as well as used for a cover of &quot;Time&quot;, Stanton MacDonald Wright&#x27;s &quot;Synchromy&quot; which has been reproduced in numerous texts about the artist/movement, Francis Bacon&#x27;s &quot;Portrait of Pope Innocent&quot; from 1953 which likewise is considered a signature work by the artist and appeared in Robert Hughes&#x27; BBC series &quot;The Shock of the New&quot; in the early 1980s.

==Facilities==

A large main gallery rotates through several exhibitions throughout the year, most of which are featured from one to three months at a time. These shows include solo shows by internationally recognized artists, travelling shows from other institutions, and group shows organized around a theme. The rest of the museum space highlights the permanent collections in various ways, including small spaces for short-term print and photography shows, a video gallery, and long-term installations organized both chronologically and thematically. Included on the grounds are outdoor sculptures and a rose garden. An external reflecting pool is surrounded on all sides by the museum.

The architecture of the original museum wing was designed in a combination of Art Nouveau and Art Deco styles by Eliel Saarinen in 1945 and completed in 1948.

The second addition, originally intended for large-scale sculpture, was designed in a Modernist style by I.M. Pei in 1966 and completed in 1968. Legend says that Pei designed the south windows, which look out onto the rose garden, to resemble &quot;PEI&quot;, but he has denied this.

The third wing was designed by Richard Meier and completed in 1985. This wing was designed to allow as much natural ambient light in as possible. 

The Art Center also includes a restaurant and a gift shop. Workshops, film festivals and lectures are conducted on a regular basis through the museums large studio program, with classes available for students of all ages.

<text>Louis Siminovitch (May 1, 1920 – April 6, 2021) was a Canadian molecular biologist. He was a pioneer in human genetics, researcher into the genetic basis of muscular dystrophy and cystic fibrosis, and helped establish Ontario programs exploring genetic roots of cancer.

==Life and career==
Siminovitch was born in Montreal, Quebec, the son of Goldie and Nathan Siminovitch, who were Jewish emigrants from Eastern Europe. He won a scholarship in chemistry to McGill University, earning a doctorate in 1944. He then studied at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. In 1953 he joined Toronto&#x27;s Connaught Medical Research Laboratories. Later he joined the University of Toronto and worked there from 1956 to 1985. One of his doctoral students was Joyce Taylor-Papadimitriou.

He helped establish the Department of Genetics at the Hospital for Sick Children as geneticist in chief, where he worked from 1970 to 1985. From 1983 to 1994 he was the founding director of research at the Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute of Mount Sinai Hospital (Toronto). He was the founder and the first Chair of the Department of Molecular Genetics at the University of Toronto, then called Department of Medical Cell Biology.

He was the author or coauthor, at last count, of over 147 scientific papers, reviews, and articles in journals and books.

He married Elinore, a playwright who died in 1995. They had three daughters. The annual Elinore &amp; Lou Siminovitch Prize in Theatre is named in his and his wife&#x27;s honour.

Siminovitch died in April 2021 in Ontario at the age of 100.

<doc id="1345963" wikidata="Q191129" url="?curid=1345963" title="Sumatran tiger">
<text>The Sumatran tiger is a population of &quot;Panthera tigris sondaica&quot; on the Indonesian island of Sumatra. It is the only surviving tiger population in the Sunda Islands, where the Bali and Javan tigers are extinct.

Sequences from complete mitochondrial genes of 34 tigers support the hypothesis that Sumatran tigers are diagnostically distinct from mainland subspecies. In 2017, the Cat Classification Task Force of the Cat Specialist Group revised felid taxonomy and recognizes the living and extinct tiger populations in Indonesia as &quot;P. t. sondaica&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Felis tigris sondaicus&quot; was the scientific name proposed by Coenraad Jacob Temminck in 1844 for a tiger specimen from Java.

&quot;Panthera tigris sumatrae&quot; was proposed by Reginald Innes Pocock in 1929, who described a skin and a skull of a tiger zoological specimen from Sumatra.
The skull and pelage pattern of tiger specimens from Java and Sumatra do not differ significantly.
&quot;P. t. sondaica&quot; is therefore considered the valid name for the living and extinct tiger populations in Indonesia.

== Evolution ==
Analysis of DNA is consistent with the hypothesis that Sumatran tigers became isolated from other tiger populations after a rise in sea level that occurred at the Pleistocene to Holocene transition about 12,000–6,000 years ago. In agreement with this evolutionary history, the Sumatran tiger is genetically isolated from all living mainland tigers, which form a distinct group closely related to each other. The isolation of the Sumatran tiger from mainland tiger populations is supported by multiple unique characters, including two diagnostic mitochondrial DNA nucleotide sites, ten mitochondrial DNA haplotypes and 11 out of 108 unique microsatellite alleles. The relatively high genetic variability and the phylogenetic distinctiveness of the Sumatran tiger indicates that the gene flow between island and mainland populations was highly restricted.

== Characteristics ==
The Sumatran tiger was described based on two zoological specimens that differed in skull size and striping pattern from Bengal and Javan tiger specimens. It is darker in fur colour and has broader stripes than the Javan tiger. Stripes tend to dissolve into spots near their ends, and on the back, flanks and hind legs are lines of small, dark spots between the regular stripes. The frequency of stripes is higher than in other subspecies.
Males have a prominent ruff, which is especially marked in the Sumatran tiger.

The Sumatran tiger is one of the smallest tigers. Males measure between the pegs in head-to-body length, with the greatest skull length of and weigh . Females weigh and measure in length between the pegs with a greatest length of skull of .

== Distribution and habitat ==
The Sumatran tiger persists in small and fragmented populations across Sumatra, from sea level in the coastal lowland forest of Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park on the southeastern tip of Lampung Province to in mountain forests of Gunung Leuser National Park in Aceh Province. It is present in 27 habitat patches larger than , which cover . About a third of these patches are inside protected areas.

Sumatran tigers prefer lowland and hill forests, where up to three tigers live in an area of ; they use non-forest habitats and human-dominated landscapes at the fringes of protected areas to a lesser degree.

In 1978, the Sumatran tiger population was estimated at 1,000 individuals, based on responses to a questionnaire survey. In 1985, a total of 26 protected areas across Sumatra containing about 800 tigers were identified. In 1992, an estimated 400–500 tigers lived in five Sumatran national parks and two protected areas. At that time, the largest population unit comprised 110–180 individuals in Gunung Leuser National Park.
As of 2011, the tiger population in Kerinci Seblat National Park in central Sumatra comprised 165–190 individuals, which is more than anywhere else on the island. The park has the highest tiger occupancy rate of Sumatra&#x27;s protected areas, with 83% of the park showing signs of tigers.

Sumatra&#x27;s total tiger population was estimated at 618 ± 290 individuals in 2017.

== Ecology and behaviour ==

Sumatran tigers strongly prefer uncultivated forests and make little use of plantations of acacia and oil palm even if these are available. Within natural forest areas, they tend to use areas with higher elevation, lower annual rainfall, farther from the forest edge, and closer to forest centres. They prefer forest with dense understory cover and steep slope, and they strongly avoid forest areas with high human influence in the forms of encroachment and settlement. In acacia plantations, they tend to use areas closer to water and prefer areas with older plants, more leaf litter, and thicker subcanopy cover. Tiger records in oil palm plantations and rubber plantations are scarce. The availability of adequate vegetation cover at the ground level serves as an environmental condition fundamentally needed by tigers regardless of the location. Without adequate understory cover, tigers are even more vulnerable to persecution by humans. Human disturbance-related variables negatively affect tiger occupancy and habitat use. Variables with strong impacts include settlement and encroachment within forest areas, logging, and the intensity of maintenance in acacia plantations.
Camera trapping surveys conducted in southern Riau revealed an extremely low abundance of potential prey and a low tiger density in peat swamp forest areas. Repeated sampling in the newly established Tesso Nilo National Park documented a trend of increasing tiger density from 0.90 individuals per in 2005 to 1.70 individuals per in 2008.

In the Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park, nine prey species larger than of body weight were identified including great argus, pig-tailed macaque, Malayan porcupine, Malayan tapir, banded pig, greater and lesser mouse-deer, Indian muntjac, and Sambar deer.

== Threats ==

Major threats include habitat loss due to expansion of palm oil plantations and planting of acacia plantations, prey-base depletion, and illegal trade primarily for the domestic market.
Conflicts with humans are another major threat to the Sumatran tiger. Poachers target tigers with wire snares, and they are also inadvertently caught in traps set by deer hunters and farmers attempting to control crop raids from wild boar.

Tigers need large contiguous forest blocks to thrive. Between 1985 and 1999, forest loss within Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park averaged 2% per year. A total of of forest disappeared inside the park, and were lost in a 10-km buffer, eliminating forest outside the park. Lowland forest disappeared faster than montane forest, and forests on gentle slopes disappeared faster than forests on steep slopes. Most forest conversions resulted from agricultural development, leading to predictions that by 2010, 70% of the park will be in agriculture. Camera-trap data indicated avoidance of forest boundaries by tigers. Classification of forest into core and peripheral forest based on mammal distribution suggests that by 2010, core forest area for tigers will be fragmented and reduced to 20% of the remaining forest.

Sumatra&#x27;s largest tiger population in Kerinci Seblat National Park is threatened by a high rate of deforestation in its outer regions. Drivers are an unsustainable demand for natural resources created by a human population with the highest rate of growth in Indonesia, and a government initiative to increase tree-crop plantations and high-intensity commercial logging, which ultimately leads to forest fires. The majority of the tigers found in the park were relocated to its center where conservation efforts are focused, but issues in the lowland hill forests of the outskirts remain. While being a highly suitable tiger habitat, these areas are also heavily targeted by logging efforts, which substantially contributes to declines in local tiger numbers.

The expansion of plantations is increasing greenhouse gas emissions, playing a part in anthropogenic climate change, thus further adding to environmental pressures on endangered species. Climate-based movement of tigers northwards may lead to increased conflict with people. From 1987 to 1997, Sumatran tigers reportedly killed 146 people and at least 870 livestock. In West Sumatra, Riau, and Aceh, a total of 128 incidents were reported; 265 tigers were killed and 97 captured in response, and 35 more tigers were killed from 1998 to 2002. From 2007 to 2010, the tigers caused the death of 9 humans and 25 further tigers were killed.

In 1997, an estimated 53 tigers were killed by poachers and their parts sold throughout most of northern Sumatra. Numbers for all of Sumatra are likely to be higher. Farmers killed many of the tigers to prevent livestock losses. They sold them to gold and souvenir shops, and pharmacies. In 2006, wildlife markets were surveyed in 28 cities and nine seaports in seven Sumatran provinces; 33 of 326 retail outlets offered tiger parts like skins, canines, bones, and whiskers. Tiger bones fetched the highest average price of US$116 per kg, followed by canines. There is evidence that tiger parts are smuggled out of Indonesia. In July 2005, over of tiger bones and 24 skulls were confiscated in Taiwan in a shipment from Jakarta.

In 2013–2014, Kerinci Seblat National Park experienced an upsurge in poaching, with the highest annual number of snare traps being removed for a patrol effort similar to previous years. Evidence is scarce and misunderstood on whether the strategies implemented to diminish poaching are succeeding despite the investment of millions of dollars annually into conservation strategies.
In provincially-managed forests in Aceh province, Sumatran tigers are threatened by poaching due to insufficient or nonexistent ranger patrols.

== Conservation ==
&quot;Panthera tigris&quot; is listed on CITES Appendix I. Hunting is prohibited in Indonesia.

In 1994, the Indonesian Sumatran Tiger Conservation Strategy addressed the potential crisis that tigers faced in Sumatra. The Sumatran Tiger Project (STP) was initiated in June 1995 in and around the Way Kambas National Park to ensure the long-term viability of wild Sumatran tigers and to accumulate data on tiger life-history characteristics vital for the management of wild populations. By August 1999, the teams of the STP had evaluated 52 sites of potential tiger habitat in Lampung Province, of which only 15 were intact enough to contain tigers. In the framework of the STP, a community-based conservation programme was initiated to document the tiger-human dimension in the park to enable conservation authorities to resolve tiger-human conflicts based on a comprehensive database rather than anecdotes and opinions.

In 2007, the Indonesian Forestry Ministry and Safari Park established cooperation with the Australia Zoo for the conservation of Sumatran tigers and other endangered species. The program includes conserving Sumatran tigers and other endangered species in the wild, efforts to reduce conflicts between tigers and humans, and rehabilitating Sumatran tigers and reintroducing them to their natural habitat.
Indonesia&#x27;s struggle with conservation has caused an upsurge in political momentum to protect and conserve wildlife and biodiversity. In 2009, Indonesia&#x27;s president committed to substantially reduce deforestation, and policies across the nation requiring spatial plans that would be environmentally sustainable at national, provincial, and district levels.

Between 2005 and 2015, about US$210 million have been invested into tiger law-enforcement activities that support forest ranger patrols, as well as the implementations of front-line law-enforcement activities by the Global Tiger Recovery Plan, which aims to double the number of wild tigers by 2020.
In November 2016, Batu Nanggar Sanctuary was opened in North Padang Lawas Regency, North Sumatra
for conservation of Sumatran wildlife.

An interview survey among 600 consumers revealed that most were willing to pay consistently more for a &quot;tiger-friendly&quot; produced good if this product would be conducive to Sumatran tiger conservation.

=== In captivity ===
As of 2013, about 375 captive Sumatran tigers were listed in the global studbook and management plan, with 50 of them housed in 14 zoos in Australia and New Zealand. All of them were offspring of 15 founders. Fourteen cubs showed congenital vestibular system dysfunctions such as ataxia, strabismus, nystagmus, head tilting and falling that resolved when they were two years old. The cause for this disorder is most likely their close genetic relation and inbreeding.

<text>King Khalid Military City (KKMC) (; transliterated: &quot;Medinat Al-Malek Khaled Al-Askariyah&quot;) is a cantonment in northeastern Saudi Arabia, approximately 60 km (37 mi.) south of Hafar al-Batin city. Constructed during the 1970s and 1980s, the city was designed and built by the Middle East Division, a unit of the United States Army Corps of Engineers. Consulting firms involved in its construction include Brown, Daltas, and Associates, as well as LeMessurier in Cambridge, Massachusetts. KKMC was established to accommodate several brigades of Saudi troops and a population of 65,000 individuals. It is named after the former Saudi King Khalid bin Abdul Aziz (r. 1975–1982).

==Construction==
The Corps of Engineers&#x27; program for KKMC was as extensive as Saudi Arabia&#x27;s massive private programs. Saudi Arabia sought and received the assistance of the U.S. Corps in part because it was impressed with the Dhahran civil air terminal and other early projects the Corps built with US funds. The Kingdom also lacked the expertise to manage such a huge program at that time. However, equally important was the U.S. Corps&#x27; reputation as an effective and honest public servant. The Saudis preferred entrusting their defense construction to a government agency. 

In 1964, the Saudi Minister of Defense and Aviation, Prince Sultan, expressed anticipation for three cantonments. King Faisal Military Cantonment in Khamis Mushait was planned in the southwest, near the border with Yemen. King Abdul Aziz Military Cantonment (later renamed &quot;King Abdulaziz Military City&quot;) was planned in Tabuk Province, in the northwest, near the border with Jordan. In 1973, the Ministry approved changing the site of the third cantonment from Qaysumah to Hafar al-Batin in the north, near the border with Iraq.

The Engineer Assistance Agreement, effective May 24, 1965, and extended several times, provides the basic framework for many Corps activities in Saudi Arabia. The Agreement was entered into pursuant to section 507(a) of the U.S. Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, and is currently authorized by section 22 of the Arms Export Act with the Ministry of Defense and Aviation (MODA) further committing the (Mediterranean Division, later the Middle East Division) US Army Corps of Engineers, initially to design and construct three brigade-size military cantonments to house elements of the Saudi Arabian Army. In the spring of 1973, MODA approved changing the location of the third cantonment from Qaysumah to Hafar al Batin and expanding the cantonment to a &quot;Military City&quot;. In March 1974, a $1.5 million contract was awarded to a joint venture with Sippican Architectural Engineering and Brown Daltas &amp; Associates Rome, Italy office. Over the next 13 months, the joint venture surveyed the location. Without estimates of the City&#x27;s population, the venture identified the architectural theme, required utilities, buildings, and facilities to MODA in May 1975 with a one brigade troop strength. Prince Sultan, head of MODA, approved the outline and concept and added two more brigade troop strength of 5000 men each. The growing demand for construction created a need to import vast quantities of construction materials and labor.

The region had limited capabilities for dealing with the inflow of goods and workers. When construction began at Khamis Mushayt in 1966, strained Saudi port facilities had barely coped. Nothing had improved by the mid-1970s. U.S. Corps personnel became increasingly concerned about Saudi Arabia’s ports&#x27; limited ability to handle the shipping volume needed to sustain the large construction projects under design. As serious discussions began concerning the construction of the cantonment at Hafar al-Batin, the military academy, and the medical research and treatment center at Al Kharj, the division’s engineers again voiced their concern about port capacity. In late 1974, the division commissioned a study of the port conditions and the transportation facilities needed to support the planned programs. In mid-November 1975, U.S. Corps personnel presented to Prince Sultan the idea of constructing a port on the Saudi east coast at Ra&#x27;s al Mish&#x27;ab near the border with Kuwait. The port would handle only materials imported for the al Batin. In June 1975, tentative approval of a $9 million contract for further design of procurement packages for the City. In the first week of January 1976, MODA named the new city King Khalid Military City in honor of Saudi King Khalid.

Planning for the city began in 1974, and construction commenced after the establishment of a new Persian Gulf port in Ra&#x27;s al-Mish&#x27;ab to handle all the materials being transported. Built in collaboration with local national engineers and project managers, various project phases were completed throughout the 1980s. The project scope was extensive, involving the drilling of 21 new wells to provide water, the establishment of a new port for supplies, the construction of 3,387 double-story family housing units with utility tunnels, and the erection of five multi-domed mosques and associated facilities. Additionally, the world&#x27;s largest pre-cast concrete plant, built on-site, was utilized and constructed by the Samwhan Corporation. The city was finally completed in 1987.

==Gulf War==
During the Gulf War, KKMC served as a housing facility for thousands of American and coalition soldiers. Its airport, the King Khaled Military City Airport, was among the most utilized during combat operations, alongside bases in Dhahran and Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

Throughout the conflict, KKMC was shielded from ballistic missiles by the U.S.&#x27;s Patriot missile system. On February 21, 1991, Iraq launched three Scud missiles at King Khalid Military City, which were reportedly neutralized by Patriot interceptors. 

==Present use==
At its peak, hundreds of US Army Corps engineers and personnel called KKMC home, and within the Saudi military city, a small American community emerged. Today, the US presence at KKMC is minimal, with only a handful of US government personnel still working and residing there, alongside a small number of foreigners from various countries who also work there. Many expatriates reside in the city, with some even born there.

<text>Othello is a 1965 film based on the National Theatre Company&#x27;s staging of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Othello&quot; (1964-1966) staged by John Dexter. Directed by Stuart Burge, the film stars Laurence Olivier, Maggie Smith, Joyce Redman, and Frank Finlay, who all received Oscar nominations, and provided film debuts for both Derek Jacobi and Michael Gambon.

==Cast==
*Laurence Olivier as Othello
*Maggie Smith as Desdemona
*Joyce Redman as Emilia
*Frank Finlay as Iago
*Derek Jacobi as Cassio
*Robert Lang as Roderigo
*Kenneth Mackintosh as Lodovico
*Anthony Nicholls as Brabantio
*Sheila Reid as Bianca
*Edward Hardwicke as Montano
*Michael Gambon as Senator/Soldier/Cypriot

==Background==
The film retains most of Shakespeare&#x27;s original play, and does not change the order of scenes, as do Olivier&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; and &quot;Richard III&quot;. The only major omission is the Fool&#x27;s scene, although other minor lines are cut here and there, though the stage version contained more of the play than the film. Derek Jacobi (Cassio) and Michael Gambon made their film debuts in &quot;Othello&quot;, while Edward Hardwicke (Montano) would go on to work with the National for seven years.

The film of &quot;Othello&quot; used enlarged duplicates of the original stage settings, rather than having elaborate new sets built. Olivier&#x27;s former backers for his Shakespeare films were all deceased by 1965, and he was unable to raise the money to do a film version on location or on elaborate sets. Nearly a decade earlier, Olivier had been attempting to find financial backing for his own film version of &quot;Macbeth&quot; after he performed the role in 1955 at Stratford, but ultimately without success. The National Theatre Company had already produced a staged film of Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; (1963) and would later produce Strindberg&#x27;s &quot;The Dance of Death&quot; (1969). The Olivier &quot;Othello&quot; is the first English-language filmed version of the play made in colour (there had been a Russian version in colour in 1955) and widescreen. It was the second major film adaption of the work after a production in 1952 by Orson Welles. In the U.S., it did not play the usual several-week run given to most films; instead, it played for only two days. The film was exhibited as a roadshow presentation.

Of all Olivier&#x27;s Shakespeare films, &quot;Othello&quot; is the one with the least music. Iago and the soldiers sing a drinking song in one scene, and in another, musicians are seen playing briefly on exotic instruments, but, otherwise, the film has no music.

==Reception==
Olivier played Othello in blackface, adopting an accent and walk of his own invention. Columnist Inez Robb disparagingly compared Olivier&#x27;s performance to Al Jolson in &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot;. She described Olivier&#x27;s performance as &quot;high camp&quot;, and said &quot;I was certainly in tune with the gentleman sitting next to me who kept asking &#x27;When does he sing &quot;Mammy&quot;?&quot; Film critic Pauline Kael gave the production and Olivier&#x27;s portrayal one of her most glowing reviews, shaming the major movie studios for giving Olivier so little money to make the film that he and the public had to be content with what was almost literally a filmed stage production, while other films received multimillion dollar budgets. John Simon, while disagreeing with the approach the production&#x27;s interpretation took, declared that, &quot;Olivier plays this misconceived Othello spectacularly, in a manner that is always a perverse joy to behold&quot;.

One particular thing which has caused distinctive amounts of offense, and a device which primarily works in film rather than on-stage, was Olivier&#x27;s rolling of his eyes: a mannerism often shown in early depictions of black people in blackface films. This device specifically links to Al Jolson and is unconnected to any Shakespearean-era stage direction.

It remains the only Shakespeare film in which all the principals were nominated for Oscars. Finlay (Iago) was nominated for Best Supporting Actor despite having the role with the most lines in the play: 1117 to Olivier&#x27;s 856. Olivier does, however, appear on screen three minutes longer than Finlay.

In 2021, music professor Bright Sheng resigned from teaching an undergraduate musical composition class at the University of Michigan because he had shown the movie to students, allegedly without giving a warning that it contained blackface. Sheng said he had intended to show how Giuseppe Verdi adapted Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Othello&quot; into his opera &quot;Otello&quot;.

<text>Volcana (Marsha Rosenberg) is a fictional character (a supervillainess turned superheroine) appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character first appeared in &quot;Secret Wars&quot; #3 (July 1984) and was created by Jim Shooter and Mike Zeck.

==Fictional character biography==
Marsha Rosenberg is a day care employee from Denver who, along with her friend Skeeter, is transported to Battleworld during &quot;Secret Wars&quot;. Seeking power and respect, she and Skeeter agreed to serve Doctor Doom in exchange for superpowers, with Marsha gaining the ability to transform into a molten lava-like form. During the series, Volcana develops a relationship with the supervillain Owen Reece / Molecule Man. She bargains with the Enchantress, and then battles her with the intent to renege on her bargain.

In &quot;Secret Wars II&quot;, Volcana assists Earth&#x27;s heroes in battling the Beyonder. Some time later, she accompanies Molecule Man and the Fantastic Four to the Beyonder&#x27;s universe, but is separated from the former when he is fused with a Cosmic Cube.

After Molecule Man is resurrected, he gives Volcana part of his power, enabling her to assume new volcanic rock forms. The two ultimately break up, though Molecule Man vows to prove his love to her and carves her face into Mount Rushmore.

Nightwatch later hires Volcana and Titania to fight She-Hulk to keep her from obtaining documents that would incriminate him. However, She-Hulk defeats the two with help from her secretary Angie Huang, her supernatural monkey Hei Hei, and Hellcat.

==Powers and abilities==
Marsha Rosenberg gained superhuman powers through cellular augmentation performed by Doctor Doom. She can transform into living plasma as well as a basalt-like form with immense strength and durability and a malleable pumice-like form.

==In other media==

<doc id="1346008" wikidata="Q333476" url="?curid=1346008" title="Ségou">
<text>Ségou (; , ) is a town and an urban commune in south-central Mali that lies northeast of Bamako on the right bank of the River Niger. The town is the capital of the Ségou Cercle and the Ségou Region. With 130,690 inhabitants in 2009, it is the fifth-largest town in Mali. 

In the middle of the 19th century there were four villages with the name of Ségou spread out over a distance of around along the right bank of the river. They were, starting from the most upstream, Ségou-Koro (Old Ségou), Ségou-Bougou, Ségou-Koura (New Ségou) and Ségou-Sikoro. The present town is on the site of Ségou-Sikoro.

==History==
===Origin===
Ségou has contested origins. Some claim that the word Ségou come from &quot;Sikoro&quot;, meaning to the foot of a shea butter tree. Others argue that it was named after Cheikou, a marabout who founded the city, while still other theories support the claim that Ségou was founded by the Bozo fishermen coming from the north in the 4th century, who established their villages along the Niger River. The 11th century CE saw an influx of the Soninke people, who were trying to escape from the collapse of the Ghana Empire, with Mandinka populations following.

===Bambara Empire===
Around 1650 Kaladian Coulibaly overthrew the ruling Koita dynasty and established a powerful if short-lived kingdom with Ségou-Koro as capital.

One of Koulibaly&#x27;s great-grandsons, Mamary Coulibaly, also known as Bitòn, became the chief of his &quot;tòn&quot;, an association of men, sometime after 1700. By 1712, Bitòn had used his military strength to displace local elders and expand the Bambara Empire. In the subsequent decades, he expanded its territory to encompass regional commerce centers such as Macina and Djenné. The city of Timbuktu would become a tributary state to Bitòn&#x27;s Bambara Empire. At this time Segou was capital of the Bambara Empire, and a distinct urban architecture began to emerge at Ségou Koro, including mosques.

After Bitòn&#x27;s death in 1755 a period of instability followed, during which the capital of the Empire moved repeatedly. In 1766 Ngolo Diarra, a former slave and warrior, took control the Bambara Empire and inaugurated a period of prosperity. The Diarra dynasty ruled Ségou until the mid-19th century. He moved the kingdom&#x27;s capital from Segou-Koro to Ségou-Sikoro, close to the site of the current city.

Mungo Park, passing through Segou in 1797 recorded a testament to the Empire&#x27;s prosperity:

=== Toucouleur Empire ===
On March 10, 1861, the Muslim Toucouleur leader, El Hadj Oumar Tall, conquered the town. Under his rule, the prominent military architect Samba Ndiaye rebuilt some of the town&#x27;s defenses. On his death in 1864, he was succeeded by his son Ahmadu Tall, who dealt repeatedly with rebellions and challenges from his brothers. After years of tensions and conflict, Segou was conquered by the French when forces led by Colonel Louis Archinard entered the town on April 6, 1890.

=== French colonial rule ===
France attempted indirectly ruling Ségou until March 13, 1893, when they incorporated the town as the capital of a local &quot;cercle&quot;. Ségou continued to serve as a regional commercial center throughout French rule.
==Geography==

=== Location ===
Ségou is situated from Bamako, on the right bank of the Niger River. The urban commune is bordered to the east by the commune of Pelengana, to the west by the commune of Sébougou and to the south by the commune of Sakoïba.

The commune is subdivided into 15 &quot;quartiers&quot;: Alamissani, Angoulême, Bagadadji, Bougoufié, Comatex, Dar Salam, Hamdallaye, Médine, Mission Catholique, Missira, Ségou Coura, Sido Soninkoura, Somono, Sokalakono, Bananissabakoro.

===Climate===
Ségou has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen &quot;BSh&quot;). The city is irrigated by two important waterways: the Niger and the Bani River. Ségou has two seasons: a rainy season and a dry season. The rainy season starts in June and lasts about four months until September. Ségou&#x27;s dry season includes a relatively mild period followed by a period of sweltering heat. The average yearly rainfall is about . The harmattan is the dominant wind in the dry season and it blows from north to south. The monsoon blowing from south to north-west is frequent during rainy season (&quot;hivernage&quot;).

==Demography==
As of the 2009 Mali Census, Ségou has a population of 130,690, up from 105,305 in 1998. A 2007 estimate put the city&#x27;s population at 118,814.

The population of the Ségou Region is largely rural, and nomadic semi-sedentary or sedentary. The population consists of many ethnic groups, such as Bambara, Bozo, Fulani, Soninke, Malinke and Toucouleur.

The town of Ségou itself is home to a variety of ethnic groups, including the Malinke, the Soninke, the Fulani, and the Toucouleur, due to its complex history and status as a regional commercial center.

Bambaras are mostly farmers and are the most numerous ethnic group. Their language is Bambara or Djoula. The Bozos are the second most populous ethnic group. They typically live near the shore of the Niger river, in small towns of small houses. The Bozo economy is based on fishing. Bozo people have a monopoly on the transport system because of their knowledge of the Niger, its shallows and seasonal lakes, and are regarded as the masters of water. The Somono, a group known to specialize in fishing and boating, are largely concentrated in Ségou and its surroundings. The Malinké/Mandinka/Maninka are closely related to Bambaras: They share costumes, religious beliefs, and practices with the Bambaras. The Marka, Saracollé or Soninke are merchants and warriors. The Soninke people are great travelers and Muslims, and have largely conserved their traditions.

==Art and culture==
The Bambaras used to transmit their knowledge by oral tradition, hence much of their art and culture is unknown. Ségou&#x27;s cultural heritage includes traditional musical instruments, wonderful griots, folkloric groups and the traditional masks and marionettes. The history of the Bambara state&#x27;s traditional religious practices are ambiguous. They practice animism and fetishism as cultural practices, and also totemic and monism (cult of ancestors). The most famous Ségou handcrafts are based on pottery, weaving (blankets, wrappers and carpets), manufacturing of &quot;Bogolan&quot; (a distinctive variation of Mud cloth), painting and sculpture. Ségou is also regarded as the capital of Malian pottery with a large pottery district in Kalabougou situated on the left bank. Women make the pottery by hand with the clay coming from the Niger River and bring the finished works to the local Monday market.

===Festivals===

The most well-known festival in Ségou is the annual Festival sur le Niger (Festival on the Niger). This festival celebrates music and the arts and culture of the Bambara people, and includes the Caravane culturelle de la paix since 2013. The 16th edition of the festival took place in 2019, when for the first time it combined with Ségou&#x27; Art, a contemporary art fair. The two festivals continue to be combined for the 2023 event, which takes place over six days in early February.

== Education ==
The University of Ségou was founded in 2009. As of 2008, Ségou has 13 kindergartens, 33 primary schools, 17 secondary schools, and 40 madrasas.

== Places of worship ==
Among the places of worship, they are predominantly Muslim mosques. There are also Christian churches and temples : Roman Catholic Diocese of Ségou (Catholic Church), Église Chrétienne Évangélique du Mali (Alliance World Fellowship), Assemblies of God.

==Architecture==

Ségou has two architectural styles: French Colonial and traditional Sudanese and neo-Sudanese. The Sudanese style influenced public building and important residences. Monuments and great mosques are also built according to this style. Many of Sudano-Sahelian&#x27;s kings built imposing palaces in the cities over which they ruled and most of these buildings are in red clay. The materials used for building are generally quite poor and many of the buildings need to be restored to maintain their state.
==Economy==
Today, Ségou is known for its pottery, its market and its fishing industry. Attractions in the old town of &quot;Ségou-Koro&quot; included a mosque, Coulibaly&#x27;s tomb and an ancient tree. In the city center, the main landmark is the water tower.

The most important economic activities are fishing, cattle herding and small scale farming. Millet is the main crop in Ségou, with other major cereals including sorghum, and cowpea. The main type of millet crop is rice pearl millet. Black-eyed peas are also grown. Crop yields in Ségou are generally low. Common types of livestock in Ségou includes sheep, poultry, cattle, goats, and donkeys. Both artisanal and commercial fishing are practiced in Ségou. Men often do the fishing, while women usually market the fish.

While most consumer goods are imported into Ségou, the city produces, and exports, handicraft and agricultural products.

As of 2008, the town is served by two telecom operators: Ikatel and Sotelma.

There are two factories processing cotton: Compagnie Malienne des Textiles (COMATEX) and Compagnie malienne pour le développement du textile (CMDT). Commerce consists mostly of the small scale exchange and sale of products from the primary sector, sold weekly at the large Sudano-Sahelian market, drawing customers from far outside of the city. The main products sold are vegetables, pottery, cotton, leather, fruit, ovens, cattle and cereals.

The headquarters of the Office du Niger is based in the town. The Office du Niger is a semi-autonomous government agency that administers a large irrigation scheme in the Ségou Region to the north of the Niger River.

Ségou used to be served by Ségou Airport (IATA: SZU, ICAO: GASG). The airport lay south-west of the city center and is visible on old maps as well as satellite imagery.

==Notable residents==
Notable people from Ségou include Adame Ba Konare, Fanta Damba, Garan Fabou Kouyate, Mountaga Tall, and Bassekou Kouyate.

Maryse Condé&#x27;s historical novel &quot;Segu&quot; tells the city&#x27;s history from 1797 to its 1860 defeat by El Hajj Oumar Tall&#x27;s army.

<text>MythAdventures or Myth Adventures is a fantasy series created by Robert Lynn Asprin. After twelve novels by Asprin, published 1978 to 2002, he and Jody Lynn Nye continued the series with seven more books that they wrote together. After his death in May 2008, Nye has continued the series on her own.

The &quot;Myth Adventures&quot; are noted for and popular for their whimsical nature, myriad characters, and liberal use of puns. After the first book, every title turns on the similarity between the word &quot;myth&quot; and the prefix &quot;mis-&quot; or the word &quot;miss&quot;. The inaugural title, &quot;Another Fine Myth&quot;, puns on the phrase &quot;another fine mess&quot;. Chapters are usually headed by made-up quotes by famous or semi-famous persons.

The first book was advertised under that title, &quot;Another Fine Mess&quot;, from Oliver Hardy&#x27;s often-used catchphrase directed towards his film comedy partner Stan Laurel, supposedly &quot;This is another fine mess you&#x27;ve gotten me into.&quot; (The actual catchphrase referred to &quot;another &quot;nice&quot; mess&quot;.) After it was too late to change the catalog, Asprin decided that using &quot;Myth&quot; would be much better if the book would become a series. They changed the title and claimed a typo in the catalog.

According to Asprin, the original inspiration for the &quot;Myth Adventures&quot; was the &quot;Road to ...&quot; comedy movie series, which stars Bing Crosby and Bob Hope as wandering con-artists/adventurers.

==Characters==
The stories mostly revolve around the adventures of a few central characters:
* Skeeve, a youngish journeyman magician from the backwater dimension of Klah.
* Aahz, a green, scaly &quot;demon&quot; (short for &quot;dimension traveler&quot;) from the dimension of Perv, a world known for its foul-tempered reptilian humanoid inhabitants. Aahz (short for Aahzmandius) takes Skeeve on as his apprentice, despite having lost his powers through a prank pulled by Skeeve&#x27;s now-deceased mentor, Garkin, at the beginning of the first novel. Later on, he and Skeeve dissolve their mentor/apprentice relationship and become partners in a magician-for-hire enterprise called M.Y.T.H. Inc.
* Gleep, Skeeve&#x27;s excitable pet, a baby dragon with a one-word eponymous vocabulary (&quot;Gleep!&quot;) that belies his incredible intellect. However, in the twelfth book Gleep speaks simple, short phrases.
* Massha, a woman of truly monumental girth with bright orange hair and a gaudy fashion sense; she begins the series as &quot;only&quot; an expert user of magical weapons and tools, but eventually apprentices herself to Skeeve.
* Guido and Nunzio, a pair of hulking and highly capable bodyguards attached to Skeeve as a favor from the interdimensional Mafia&#x27;s Fairy Godfather, Don Bruce. Nunzio seldom talks, while Guido speaks in a Runyonesque dialect, which is explained as being an aftereffect of having been in a production of &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;. Both are much more intelligent than their stereotype suggests.
* Chumley, an enormous but quite gentle and erudite Troll whose professional persona is a monosyllabic muscle-for-hire called Big Crunch.
* Tananda, a.k.a. Tanda, a professional assassin and Chumley&#x27;s nymphish Trollop sister.
* Bunny, Don Bruce&#x27;s beautiful niece and Skeeve&#x27;s assigned moll; she is an accomplished and intelligent accountant and is in love with Skeeve (though he does not know it).
* Markie, a small doll-like girl who is actually a character assassin in disguise. Cupys (small, doll-like people) are from the Cupid dimension.

The Phil Foglio comics based on the books also involve The Winslow: A small fuzzy alligator which happens to be utterly indestructible and presumably immortal, and figures prominently one way or another into fully three-fourths of the galaxy&#x27;s known religions.

==Known dimensions==
Many of the names, like so much else in this series, are puns; see the parenthetical comments.
*Klah: Backwater dimension from which Skeeve hails. General populace (Klahds) are afraid of demons and magik. Kingdom of Possiltum and Twixt are the only places worth mentioning. (&quot;&quot;, slang for &quot;stupid person&quot;.)
*Deva: Merchant capital of the dimensions. Inhabited by the Deveels, traders supreme. As Aahz puts it, &quot;if you think you&#x27;ve gotten a good deal from a Deveel, first count your fingers, then your limbs, then your relatives&quot;. The Bazaar at Deva is the only place of interest, a dimension-wide round-the-clock flea market which sells every conceivable magikal device and artifact. (&quot;Devil&quot;)
*Perv: High-tech dimension where Magik and technology are equal. Pervish cooking is one of the worst smells in all the dimensions (besides Gleep&#x27;s breath). Pervects are short-tempered and disquieting rumors circulate about them, which Pervects encourage so that people do not visit. Do not ever call them &quot;Perverts&quot;.
*Limbo: Dark dimension filled with vampires and were-things, such as werewolves, werebears, weresnakes, and weretigers. Chief city is Blut, notable people are Vilhelm the Dispatcher, and Drahcir and Idnew: the Woof Writers, a husband and wife team of werewolves (homages to Wendy and Richard Pini). The low amount of force-lines limit magik here, and offworlders are viewed as terrifying monsters by the older vampires. Skeeve&#x27;s house in the Bazaar has a back door which opens into Limbo. (&lt;ins&gt;Blood, &lt;/ins&gt;Limbo)
*Jahk: Humanoid dimension where the average inhabitants are either short and obese or extremely thin. Every year, the Big Game is played to determine whether Veygus or Ta-Hoe is the capital of the dimension. Players are practically another species, extremely muscled and large. The winner of the Big Game used to claim the Trophy, but the hideous thing is now in the possession of Aahz, after the Skeeve-founded team &quot;The Demons&quot; won it in a three-way brawl. Following their victory and subsequent confiscation of the Trophy (and with it Jahk&#x27;s method of selecting their capital) a Common Council was put together to rule the dimension. (&quot;&quot;, &quot;Vegas&quot;, &quot;Tahoe&quot;)
*Avis: Dimension full of sentient birds. No areas of interest. Do not visit Avis unless you can fly and you like foods of the crawly variety. (Latin for &quot;bird&quot;. Tanda also makes references to Rentals, which mystifies Skeeve, this comes from the Avis Rent a Car System.)
*Gastropo: A dimension full of snail-like inhabitants. The preferred mode of transport is walking, although that takes hours just to move a block. Unadvisable to visit. As Tananda would put it, they have no cargo but plenty of es-cargo(t). (In biological categorization, snails are gastropods. &quot;Escargot&quot; is French for &quot;snail&quot;; the &quot;t&quot; is silent, so it rhymes with &quot;cargo&quot;.)
*Arcadia: A pleasant dimension &quot;controlled&quot; by a hard-working &quot;philanthropist&quot; named Hoos. Apparently populated by people that he&#x27;s bailed out of tight situations, it&#x27;s implied that behind the scenes Hoos was largely responsible for putting them in the situations they were so grateful for having been rescued from. (Arcadia, a poetic byword for an idyllic vision of unspoiled wilderness.)
*Kow-Tow: An extremely remote dimension that superficially resembles the American &quot;Wild West&quot;, but is actually a breeding ground for humans so that the vampire cows can suck their blood. Contains a huge nexus of magic force-lines.
*Scamaroni: A dimension with a smell-oriented race that has a reputation for being made up of suckers. (&quot;&quot; = con game.)
*Kobol: A dimension of technology enthusiasts. (&quot;COBOL&quot;, and possibly also &quot;kobold&quot;.)
*Ronko: A dimension filled with televisions and advertising. (&quot;Ronco&quot;)
*Wuh: Rural dimension that is home to cowardly, sheep-like shopaholics called Wuhses. (&quot;&quot;.)

Dimensions that have been mentioned but not explicitly depicted:
*Imper: Not much is known about Imper except that it is close to Deva and the Imps were wiped out financially by the Deveels.

*Mantico: Home of the formidable Manticore race.
*Djinger: Home and base of operations for the Djinns. The Djinns, like the Imps, were hit hard by the cut-throat tactics of the Deveels, so they started providing emigrant magickal labor in bottles and lamps. Males are Djinns, females are Djeanies. (&quot;Djinn&quot;, &quot;genie&quot;, &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot;, probably also &quot;ginger&quot;)

==Books==
The &quot;first&quot; Myth Adventures series was written by Asprin alone for the now-defunct publishing house The Donning Company under their Starblaze Graphics imprint (with the last two published by Meisha Merlin, who picked up the contract from Donning). All twelve are collected in &quot;Robert Asprin&#x27;s Myth Adventures Volume 1&quot; and &quot;Volume 2&quot; (Meisha Merlin, 2006/2007).

* &quot;Another Fine Myth&quot; (1978) 
* &quot;Myth Conceptions&quot; (1980) 
* &quot;Myth Directions&quot; (1982) 
* &quot;Myth-Ion Improbable&quot; (2001; takes place sequentially as Book 3.5)
* &quot;Hit or Myth&quot; (1983) 
* &quot;Myth-ing Persons&quot; (1984) 
* &quot;Little Myth Marker&quot; (1985) 
* &quot;M.Y.T.H. Inc. Link&quot; (1986) 
* &quot;Myth-Nomers and Im-Pervections&quot; (1987) 
* &quot;M.Y.T.H. Inc. in Action&quot; (1990) 
* &quot;Sweet Myth-Tery of Life&quot; (1993) 
* &quot;Something M.Y.T.H. Inc.&quot; (2002)

The &quot;new&quot; Myth Adventures series was co-authored with Jody Lynn Nye.

* &quot;Myth-Told Tales&quot; (2003)
* &quot;Myth Alliances&quot; (2003)
* &quot;Myth-Taken Identity&quot; (2004)
* &quot;Class Dis-Mythed&quot; (2005)
* &quot;Myth-Gotten Gains&quot; (2006)
* &quot;Myth-Chief&quot; (2008)
* &quot;Myth-Fortunes&quot; (2008)

Nye has continued the series after Asprin&#x27;s death in 2008.

* &quot;Myth-Quoted&quot; (2013; advertised as &quot;Robert Asprin&#x27;s Myth-Quoted&quot;, but authored by Nye alone.)
* &quot;Myth-Fits&quot; (2016; advertised as &quot;Robert Asprin&#x27;s Myth-Fits&quot;, but authored by Nye alone.)

After &quot;Myth-Gotten Gains&quot;, Meisha Merlin went out of business and publication of hardcover/trade editions changed hands again, this time to Wildside Press. Robert Asprin died in May 2008, but Nye intended that year to write the books which she and Asprin had planned (&quot;We had big plans&quot;). According to the series website, the publisher of mass market editions Ace Books has commissioned two.

===Short stories===
In 2010, Baen Books published a collection of Asprin&#x27;s short myth-stories under the title &quot;Myth-Interpretations&quot; (). This collection contains short stories and short novels taking place in many worlds that Robert Asprin created. It is advertised as containing all of the Myth short fiction.

==Illustrated novels==
The first novel was adapted into an eight-part WaRP Graphics comic book series in the mid-1980s. Illustrated and heavily rewritten by Phil Foglio, the series was later collected into two full-color graphic novels published by Starblaze Graphics, and in 2007 Airship Entertainment (the Foglios&#x27; publishing concern) reprinted the material in a single volume. Four more issues followed, featuring an original story by Asprin and artist Jim Valentino which attempts to bridge the action between the first and second novels in the series. (Apple Comics took over the second series halfway through.) In 2010, Airship Entertainment began re-releasing the story as a web comic. Though this has been offline since sometime in February 2016, along with webcomic republications of &quot;Buck Godot&quot; and &quot;What&#x27;s New with Phil &amp; Dixie&quot;, when Airship Entertainment&#x27;s old website broke down.

The second novel was later adapted into another eight-part comic series by Ken and Beth Mitchroney and published by Apple from 1987 through 1989. Neither of these two later series enjoyed a graphic novel collection.

Foglio has also done the cover art and accompanying illustrations for the first editions of most of the novels. Before he started the cover illustrations, Kelly Freas did the covers of the first editions of the earliest books of the series.

==Film and theater==
Short-lived rumors circulated in the 1980s that Wendy and Richard Pini, owners of WaRP Graphics, were considering turning their adaptation of &quot;Another Fine Myth&quot; into a feature-length movie after doing so with their own property, &quot;Elfquest&quot;, though the latter has yet to even make it past concept to this day.

==The board game==
A board game called &quot;Myth Fortunes&quot; was developed by Mayfair Games and sold in 1990.

<text>BBC World Service Television, often abbreviated to WSTV (World Service Television), was the name of two BBC international satellite television channels between 1991 and 1995. It was the BBC&#x27;s first foray into worldwide television broadcasting. In Europe, it was the successor to BBC TV Europe, which it replaced on 11 March 1991. The service was also launched in Asia as a 24-hour news and information service with minor differences, a precursor to BBC World News, launched on 14 October 1991.

Unlike the BBC World Service at the time, it was not funded by the British government through a grant-in-aid. Instead, it was funded either by subscription or by commercial advertising, with advertisements inserted locally by individual cable or satellite providers. News headlines, trailers and other updates, known as &quot;break fillers&quot;, were inserted to fill gaps in cases where no commercials were broadcast by the local provider.

==Availability==

===Europe===
In Europe, BBC WSTV replaced BBC TV Europe on 11 March 1991 as the BBC&#x27;s subscription-funded entertainment service. Like BBC TV Europe, it was a mix of BBC1 and BBC2. However, in place of BBC TV Europe&#x27;s near-continuous direct rebroadcast of BBC1 and schedule pattern timed to UK time (GMT/BST), it had a schedule pattern more synchronised to Central European Time and many of its first-run programmes were timeshifted to more suitable times for viewing in CET, as well as showing specially commissioned &quot;World Service News&quot; bulletins from Television Centre. The BBC World Service News studio looked like the BBC&#x27;s domestic news, though with different graphics and an on-screen logo. The station also broadcast its own Children&#x27;s BBC junctions from Presentation Studio A.

===Outside Europe===
Outside Europe, BBC World Service Television was the name of the 24-hour news, information and current affairs service, launched in Asia on 14 October 1991 as carried by Star TV, and also available from Turkey to South Korea on AsiaSat. Competing against CNN International, it showed current affairs and documentary programming from BBC One and BBC Two in addition to &quot;BBC World Service News&quot; with entertainment programs aired on Star Plus. Explaining why the company choose to carry BBC WSTV instead of CNN, Richard Li, who was head of Star TV at the time, cited American bias projected in CNN&#x27;s coverage of the Gulf War, in an interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

News Corporation, of Rupert Murdoch, began acquiring Star TV in 1993. In March 1994, the BBC and Star TV reached a deal after an out of court settlement, that would gradually drop BBC World Service Television from the satellite broadcaster&#x27;s offerings. BBC WSTV would be dropped from the channel line-up for the Northeast Asia by mid-April that year, but would be available in the rest of Asia until 31 March 1996.

BBC World Service Television programming was also carried in Africa on M-Net, launched on 15 April 1992, for 11 hours a day. In Canada, its bulletins were carried on CBC Newsworld several times a day.

BBC World Service Television news broadcasts were aired on Malaysia&#x27;s TV1 until May 1994, with the BBC demanding that it would stop supply their content to Malaysia and should air their content without cuts, which TV1&#x27;s operator RTM think is unfair. It also said that the BBC ignored priorities and cultural values of Asians.

==Presentation==

The channel from 1991 until c.1994 used the presentation device of a rotating world: the Computer Originated World, which had previously been used on BBC One between 1985 and 1991. The world symbol remained the same, but the legend at the bottom was altered to a BBC logo with an italic &quot;World Service&quot; beneath. Promotional style and static programme captions mirrored that of BBC1 and 2 at the time and featured the globe symbol above a small BBC logo in the top left corner of promotions and on captions. The sidebar of captions featured a vague wispy line style, similar to that used by WSTV bulletins. The channel also used a break bumper featuring the globe, and a promo bumper featuring the COW globe split into lines to the side and bottom.

Around the time of the relaunch, BBC WSTV adopted a variation of the flag look later to be used by BBC World, which only featured a BBC logo.

The channel had a permanent DOG of the BBC logo in the top right corner of the screen.

==Rebranding and reorganisation==
On Thursday, 26 January 1995 at 19:00 GMT, BBC World Service Television was split into two new channels at BBC Television Centre in White City:
*BBC World (since renamed BBC World News): 24-hour English free-to-air terrestrial international news channel, officially launched on Monday 16 January 1995 at 19:00 GMT.
* BBC Prime (since replaced by BBC Entertainment): 24-hour English cable lifestyle, variety, and entertainment channel, officially launched on Monday 30 January 1995 at 19:00 GMT.

<text>Glenavon Football Club is a Northern Irish semi-professional football club that competes in the NIFL Premiership. Founded in 1889, the club hails from Lurgan and plays its home matches at Mourneview Park. Club colours are blue and white. Glenavon&#x27;s bitter rivals are Portadown, with their matches known as the &quot;Mid-Ulster Derby&quot;. 

==History==
Glenavon was the first provincial club to win the Irish League title (1951–52) and also the first provincial club to do the league and cup double (1956–57). The latter triumph also made them the first Northern Irish team to enter the European Cup. Glenavon has had a number of talented and famous players, none more so than Wilbur Cush and Jimmy Jones, who were to the fore in &quot;the glory years&quot; of the Fifties. The success of the 1950s is still the benchmark at the club – the closest the club have come to achieving a league success since came in the 1993–94 season, when but for two late goals in the final match Glenavon would have been crowned champions.

Glenavon enjoyed a good run throughout the 1990s, consistently achieving good placings in the league and winning several cup competitions, including Irish Cup wins in 1991–92 and 1996–97, and were runners-up against Glentoran in the 1995–96 and 1997–98 editions of the cup. The club then suffered a relatively poor spell during the early 2000s, which culminated in relegation to the second tier in the 2003–04 Irish League season. Although they were promoted the following season, Glenavon continued to struggle towards the bottom of the league throughout the remainder of the decade, going through several managers such as Terry Cochrane, Stephen McBride &amp; Marty Quinn. McBride was a Northern Ireland international and a popular Glenavon player in the 1980s &amp; 1990s, but his reign lasted just seven months before he was relieved of his managerial duties with Glenavon at the bottom of the IFA Premiership.

Former Portadown &amp; Glentoran forward Gary Hamilton was appointed player-manager in December 2011, managing to steer the club from relegation in the remainder of the 2011–12 Irish League season. This was followed up by a 9th-place finish in the 2012–13 season. The 2013–14 season was welcomed by many as a successful season, the Lurgan club securing a top-six league finish and a return to winning major silverware with the 2013–14 Irish Cup, in which Glenavon triumphed 2–1 over Ballymena United in the final.

Following on from this cup triumph was a successful 2014–15 season. Though Glenavon did not fare as well in the Irish Cup, exiting at the 6th round to Championship 1 side Harland &amp; Wolff Welders, an excellent late run of 7 consecutive wins saw the Lurgan Blues pip their Mid-Ulster rivals Portadown to a third-placed league finish, therefore sealing European football for the 2015–16 season.

The 2015–16 season would be another good season for the Lurgan Blues, once again securing Europe on the penultimate matchday by finishing third, on a points total of 69. Even more success was to follow, as the club claimed a second Irish Cup win in three years, defeating David Healy&#x27;s Linfield 2–0 in the final.

Glenavon did not enjoy similar success in the 2016–17 season. Despite having signed former Celtic and Northern Ireland winger Paddy McCourt, the club struggled for form and could only achieve a disappointing 6th-placed finish in the league. Although the club reached the semi-finals of the Mid-Ulster Cup, League Cup and Irish Cup, they were defeated in all by Warrenpoint Town, Carrick Rangers and Coleraine respectively. Glenavon also suffered agonising defeat to Ballymena United in the Europa League playoff final, therefore missing out on a fourth successive year of European qualification.

Despite failure to qualify for Europe and a large exodus of players at the start of the 2017–18 season, the signing of players such as Sammy Clingan and Andrew Mitchell, aligned with the emergence of Bobby Burns, meant that Glenavon had a resurgence in form, finishing third once again, and qualifying for Europe. However, the only piece of silverware attained was the Mid-Ulster Cup, having exited the League Cup and Irish Cup via shock defeats at the hands of Ards and Loughgall.

While the 2018–19 season yielded a club-record points total of 70, the club had a disappointing record in the major cups, falling to defeat against Dergview and Dungannon Swifts in the League Cup and Irish Cup respectively. However, the Lurgan Blues did retain the Mid-Ulster Cup with a 4–3 victory over Warrenpoint Town. Despite attaining another third-place finish, Glenavon fell to a 2–4 defeat against Glentoran in the Europa League playoff semi-final and failed to attain European qualification for the following season.

The club endured a difficult 2019–20 campaign, falling to several heavy defeats in the league and exiting the Irish Cup at the 5th round with a 2–0 defeat against Coleraine. Inconsistent form meant that the club finished outside of the league&#x27;s top-six for the first time since the 2012–13 season.

The Lurgan Blues&#x27; form improved significantly in the 2020–21 season, but the club narrowly missed out on a top-six finish; their final points total of 62 was the highest points tally recorded for a team in the bottom-six. Their seventh-place finish secured the Lurgan Blues a spot in the Europa Conference League playoffs. They faced Larne in the semi-final, losing narrowly to a Martin Donnelly goal in injury time, leaving Glenavon without European qualification.

The 2021–22 season saw the unexpected departure of the previous season&#x27;s top scorer, Danny Purkis, but Glenavon would once again claim a seventh-place finish and qualification for the Europa Conference League playoffs. They were defeated at the semi-final stage, losing 2–0 against third-placed Glentoran at The Oval. The same opposition had eliminated Glenavon in the Irish League Cup earlier in the season. The Lurgan Blues exited the Irish Cup in controversial fashion, having had two goals disallowed against Crusaders.

On 13 September 2023, it was announced that Gary Hamilton had vacated the post of manager, following a number of poor results at the beginning of the 2023–24 season. U20s manager Gary McAlister took over as caretaker for matches against Carrick Rangers and Crusaders, and on 25 September, former Warrenpoint Town manager Stephen McDonnell was appointed in the role on a permanent basis. McDonnell steadied the ship at Glenavon and they ultimately avoided relegation from the NIFL Premiership that season.

==Stadium==

Since 1895, Glenavon&#x27;s home stadium has been Mourneview Park, located in the south of Lurgan.

From 1992 to 2011, significant alterations were made to Mourneview Park in order to bring the ground up to a modern standard. Along the side of the pitch runs the Geddis Stand (holds roughly 1700), and on the other side the Glenfield Road Stand (holds roughly 2000), which houses away supporters. Behind one of the goals, the ground has the Crescent End (standing terrace), and at the other end the Hospital End contains a training pitch.

In addition to Glenavon&#x27;s home matches, the stadium is also a regular host for Northern Ireland under-21 matches, and was the venue for several group stage games in the UEFA Women&#x27;s Under-19 Euro 2017 finals. Due to the ongoing renovation of Windsor Park, Mourneview Park was chosen as the venue for Linfield&#x27;s home ties in the 2014–15 UEFA Europa League. The stadium has occasionally been used as a neutral ground for Irish Cup semi-finals, most recently in the 2018–19, 2020–21, and 2021–22 editions of the competition.

In September 2020, Glenavon FC unveiled a new 5m x 2m Digital LED Screen at Mourneview Park, which was supplied by FSL Scoreboards. It is the first of its kind anywhere in Ireland.

On 12 April 2021, it was announced that Mourneview Park would be the host venue for the 2020–21 Irish Cup Final; the first time the final has been staged outside of Belfast since 1975.

Mourneview Park hosted the second leg of the first round tie in the inaugural edition of the Europa Conference League between FK Velež Mostar and Coleraine F.C. on 15 July 2021, due to pitch redevelopments at The Showgrounds.

Prior to the 2023–24 season commencing, the seated area of the Crescent End was returned to a standing terrace, with the installation of crash barriers manufactured by local company, Dawson Manufacturing &amp; Engineering.

==European record==

Glenavon was the first Northern Irish team to enter the European Cup. In their first tie they drew AGF of Denmark, drawing 0–0 at home and losing 0–3 away.

Glenavon achieved some more notable results in Europe in the 1990s. In the 1992–93 season, they drew both legs of their Cup Winners Cup tie with Royal Antwerp and lost on penalties. In 1995–96 they reached the first round proper of the UEFA Cup (the last Irish League club to do so), and were beaten by Werder Bremen.

The academy was formed in 2007 as a result of the Irish league licensing requirements and then first team manager Colin Malone appointed Gordon Wylie as Academy co-ordinator. Gordon&#x27;s first task was to bring ex Glenavon legend Stephen McBride back to the club as the academy head coach.

The Glenavon Academy is now headed by Chris Chambers after previously being led by Alex Denver, Thomas McStravick and Ryan Prentice. The academy currently has a number of UEFA A Licence and UEFA B Licence coaches.

In recent times the club has introduced various coaching programmes and training camps aimed at increasing the numbers within the academy. These have included the Glenavon Academy Club Affiliation Programme, Schools Programme, Aces, Girls Football and annual Football Camps at Easter, Summer and Halloween.

<text>Leotychidas II (; Doric: ; c. 545 – c. 469 BC) was king of Sparta between 491–476 BC, alongside Cleomenes I and later Leonidas I and Pleistarchus. He led Spartan forces during the Persian Wars from 490 BC to 478 BC.

Born in Sparta around 545 BC, Leotychidas was a descendant of the Royal House of the Eurypontids (through Menamus, Agesilaus, Hippocratides, Leotychides, Anaxilaus, Archidamos, Anaxandridas I and Theopompus) and came to power in 491 BC with the help of the Agiad King Cleomenes I by challenging the legitimacy of the birth of Demaratus for the Eurypontid throne of Sparta. Later that year, he joined Cleomenes&#x27; second expedition to Aegina, where ten hostages were seized and given to Athens. However, after Cleomenes&#x27; death in 488 BC, Leotychidas was almost surrendered to Aegina.

In the spring of 479 BC, following the death of his co-ruler Leonidas at the Battle of Thermopylae, Leotychidas commanded a Greek fleet consisting of 110 ships at Aegina and later at Delos, supporting the Greek revolts at Chios and Samos against Persia. Leotychidas defeated Persian military and naval forces at the Battle of Mycale on the coast of Asia Minor in the summer of 479 BC (possibly around mid-August). In 476 BC, Leotychidas led an expedition to Thessaly against the Aleuadae family for collaboration with the Persians but withdrew after being bribed by the family. Upon returning to Sparta he was tried for bribery, and fled to the temple of Athena Alea in Tegea. He was sentenced to exile and his house burned. He was succeeded by his grandson, Archidamus II, son of his son Zeuxidamus, called Cyniscus, who had died in his father&#x27;s lifetime. Leotychidas died some years later, around 469 BC.

<text>Sikasso (Bambara: ߛߌߞߊߛߏ tr. Sikaso) is a city in the south of Mali and the capital of the Sikasso Cercle and the Sikasso Region. It is Mali&#x27;s second largest city with 225,753 residents in the 2009 census.

==History==

Sikasso was a small village until 1870, when Tieba Traoré, whose mother came from Sikasso, became &quot;Faama&quot; of the Kénédougou Kingdom and moved the capital there. He established his palace on the sacred Mamelon hill (now home to a water tower) and constructed a massive tata to defend against the attacks of both the Malinke conqueror Samori Ture and the French colonial army. This made Sikasso the largest fortified city ever built in west Africa. 

Sikasso withstood a 15-month siege by Ture from 1887 to 1888 before the French, allies of Kenedougou against Ture, relieved the city. Despite this, the French contrived a diplomatic crisis to attack in 1898. They began a major artillery barrage against the tata on April 15th 1898, and the city fell on May 1st amid furious house-to-house fighting. Babemba Traore, Tieba&#x27;s brother who had succeeded him as &quot;faama&quot;, ordered his bodyguards to kill him rather than let him fall into French hands. He is still remembered for honoring the Bamanankan saying &quot;Saya ka fisa ni maloya ye&quot; (literally: death is preferable to shame). 4000 captives were taken from the sack and parcelled out as slaves among the French and their African auxiliaries. They were marched back west to the Niger, with many too weak or starved to continue dying or being killed along the way.

In modern-day Sikasso, attractions include the large market, Mamelon hill, the remains of Tieba Traoré&#x27;s &quot;tata&quot;, and the nearby Missirikoro Grotto. The festival takes place every June, celebrating the traditional Malian instrument.
==Geography==
Located southeast of Bamako, north of Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, and west of Burkina Faso, Sikasso acts as a crossroads between the coastal countries (Togo, Bénin, Ghana, Côte d&#x27;Ivoire) and the landlocked Mali and Burkina Faso. Sikasso&#x27;s ethnic groups include the Senufo Bamana,(mainly the Supyire), the Bobo (or Bobo Fing, lit. &#x27;black Bobo&#x27;), and the Minianka (Mamara Senufo).

Sikasso has abundant agriculture. Sikasso&#x27;s fruit and vegetable production guarantees the city&#x27;s self-sufficiency, sparing it from reliance on international food aid.

==Climate==
Sikasso features a tropical wet and dry climate under the Köppen climate classification. The city receives just under of rain each year, most of which falls between May and October. August is the wettest month, with an average rainfall of . The highest temperatures are reached at the end of the dry season in March and April when the average daily maximum temperatures are just above .
== Places of worship == 
Among the places of worship, they are predominantly Muslim mosques. There are also Christian churches and temples : Roman Catholic Diocese of Sikasso (Catholic Church), Église Chrétienne Évangélique du Mali (Alliance World Fellowship), Assemblies of God.

==Sister Cities==
Sikasso&#x27;s sister city is Brive-la-Gaillarde, in France.

<text>Mode choice analysis is the third step in the conventional four-step transportation forecasting model of transportation planning, following trip distribution and preceding route assignment. From origin-destination table inputs provided by trip distribution, mode choice analysis allows the modeler to determine probabilities that travelers will use a certain mode of transport. These probabilities are called the modal share, and can be used to produce an estimate of the amount of trips taken using each feasible mode.

==History==

The early transportation planning model developed by the Chicago Area Transportation Study (CATS) focused on transit. It wanted to know how much travel would continue by transit. The CATS divided transit trips into two classes: trips to the Central Business District, or CBD (mainly by subway/elevated transit, express buses, and commuter trains) and other (mainly on the local bus system). For the latter, increases in auto ownership and use were a trade-off against bus use; trend data were used. CBD travel was analyzed using historic mode choice data together with projections of CBD land uses. Somewhat similar techniques were used in many studies. Two decades after CATS, for example, the London study followed essentially the same procedure, but in this case, researchers first divided trips into those made in the inner part of the city and those in the outer part. This procedure was followed because it was thought that income (resulting in the purchase and use of automobiles) drove mode choice.

==Diversion curve techniques==
The CATS had diversion curve techniques available and used them for some tasks. At first, the CATS studied the diversion of auto traffic from streets and arterial roads to proposed expressways. Diversion curves were also used for bypasses built around cities to find out what percent of traffic would use the bypass. The mode choice version of diversion curve analysis proceeds this way: one forms a ratio, say:

:formula_1

where:
:&quot;cm&quot; = travel time by mode &quot;m&quot; and
:&quot;R&quot; is empirical data in the form:
Given the &quot;R&quot; that we have calculated, the graph tells us the percent of users in the market that will choose transit. A variation on the technique is to use costs rather than time in the diversion ratio. The decision to use a time or cost ratio turns on the problem at hand. Transit agencies developed diversion curves for different kinds of situations, so variables like income and population density entered implicitly.

Diversion curves are based on empirical observations, and their improvement has resulted from better (more and more pointed) data. Curves are available for many markets. It is not difficult to obtain data and array results. Expansion of transit has motivated data development by operators and planners. Yacov Zahavi’s UMOT studies, discussed earlier, contain many examples of diversion curves.

In a sense, diversion curve analysis is expert system analysis. Planners could &quot;eyeball&quot; neighborhoods and estimate transit ridership by routes and time of day. Instead, diversion is observed empirically and charts drawn.

==Disaggregate travel demand models==
Travel demand theory was introduced in the appendix on traffic generation. The core of the field is the set of models developed following work by Stan Warner in 1962 (Strategic Choice of Mode in Urban Travel: A Study of Binary Choice). Using data from the CATS, Warner investigated classification techniques using models from biology and psychology. Building from Warner and other early investigators, disaggregate demand models emerged. Analysis is disaggregate in that individuals are the basic units of observation, yet aggregate because models yield a single set of parameters describing the choice behavior of the population. Behavior enters because the theory made use of consumer behavior concepts from economics and parts of choice behavior concepts from psychology. Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley (especially Daniel McFadden, who won a Nobel Prize in Economics for his efforts) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Moshe Ben-Akiva) (and in MIT associated consulting firms, especially Cambridge Systematics) developed what has become known as choice models, direct demand models (DDM), Random Utility Models (RUM) or, in its most used form, the multinomial logit model (MNL).

Choice models have attracted a lot of attention and work; the Proceedings of the International Association for Travel Behavior Research chronicles the evolution of the models. The models are treated in modern transportation planning and transportation engineering textbooks.

One reason for rapid model development was a felt need. Systems were being proposed (especially transit systems) where no empirical experience of the type used in diversion curves was available. Choice models permit comparison of more than two alternatives and the importance of attributes of alternatives. There was the general desire for an analysis technique that depended less on aggregate analysis and with a greater behavioral content. And there was attraction, too, because choice models have logical and behavioral roots extended back to the 1920s as well as roots in Kelvin Lancaster’s consumer behavior theory, in utility theory, and in modern statistical methods.

==Psychological roots==
Early psychology work involved the typical experiment: Here are two objects with weights, &quot;w1&quot; and &quot;w2&quot;, which is heavier? The finding from such an experiment would be that the greater the difference in weight, the greater the probability of choosing correctly. Graphs similar to the one on the right result.

Louis Leon Thurstone proposed (in the 1920s) that perceived weight,

:&quot;w&quot; = &quot;v&quot; + &quot;e&quot;,

where &quot;v&quot; is the true weight and &quot;e&quot; is random with
:&quot;E&quot;(&quot;e&quot;) = 0.

The assumption that &quot;e&quot; is normally and identically distributed (NID) yields the binary probit model.

==Econometric formulation==
Economists deal with utility rather than physical weights, and say that

:observed utility = mean utility + random term.

The characteristics of the object, x, must be considered, so we have

:&quot;u&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;v&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) + &quot;e&quot;(&quot;x&quot;).

If we follow Thurston&#x27;s assumption, we again have a probit model.

An alternative is to assume that the error terms are independently and identically distributed with a Weibull, Gumbel Type I, or double exponential distribution. (They are much the same, and differ slightly in their tails (thicker) from the normal distribution). This yields the multinomial logit model (MNL). Daniel McFadden argued that the Weibull had desirable properties compared to other distributions that might be used. Among other things, the error terms are normally and identically distributed. The logit model is simply a log ratio of the probability of choosing a mode to the probability of not choosing a mode.

:formula_2

Observe the mathematical similarity between the logit model and the S-curves we estimated earlier, although here share increases with utility rather than time. With a choice model we are explaining the share of travelers using a mode (or the probability that an individual traveler uses a mode multiplied by the number of travelers).

The comparison with S-curves is suggestive that modes (or technologies) get adopted as their utility increases, which happens over time for several reasons. First, because the utility itself is a function of network effects, the more users, the more valuable the service, higher the utility associated with joining the network. Second because utility increases as user costs drop, which happens when fixed costs can be spread over more users (another network effect). Third technological advances, which occur over time and as the number of users increases, drive down relative cost.

An illustration of a utility expression is given:

:formula_3

where
:&quot;Pi&quot; = Probability of choosing mode i.
:&quot;PA&quot; = Probability of taking auto
:&quot;cA,cT&quot; = cost of auto, transit
:&quot;tA,tT&quot; = travel time of auto, transit
:&quot;I&quot; = income
:&quot;N&quot; = Number of travelers

With algebra, the model can be translated to its most widely used form:
:formula_4
:formula_5
:formula_6
:formula_7

It is fair to make two conflicting statements about the estimation and use of this model:

#it&#x27;s a &quot;house of cards&quot;, and
#used by a technically competent and thoughtful analyst, it&#x27;s useful.

The &quot;house of cards&quot; problem largely arises from the utility theory basis of the model specification. Broadly, utility theory assumes that (1) users and suppliers have perfect information about the market; (2) they have deterministic functions (faced with the same options, they will always make the same choices); and (3) switching between alternatives is costless. These assumptions don’t fit very well with what is known about behavior. Furthermore, the aggregation of utility across the population is impossible since there is no universal utility scale.

Suppose an option has a net utility &quot;ujk&quot; (option &quot;k&quot;, person &quot;j&quot;). We can imagine that having a systematic part &quot;vjk&quot; that is a function of the characteristics of an object and person &quot;j&quot;, plus a random part &quot;ejk&quot;, which represents tastes, observational errors and a bunch of other things (it gets murky here). (An object such as a vehicle does not have utility, it is characteristics of a vehicle that have utility.) The introduction of &quot;e&quot; lets us do some aggregation. As noted above, we think of observable utility as being a function:

:formula_8

where each variable represents a characteristic of the auto trip. The value &quot;β0&quot; is termed an alternative specific constant. Most modelers say it represents characteristics left out of the equation (e.g., the political correctness of a mode, if I take transit I feel morally righteous, so &quot;β&quot;0 may be negative for the automobile), but it includes whatever is needed to make error terms NID.

==Econometric estimation==
Turning now to some technical matters, how do we estimate &quot;v(x)&quot;? Utility (&quot;v(x)&quot;) isn’t observable. All we can observe are choices (say, measured as 0 or 1), and we want to talk about probabilities of choices that range from 0 to 1. (If we do a regression on 0s and 1s we might measure for &quot;j&quot; a probability of 1.4 or −0.2 of taking an auto.) Further, the distribution of the error terms wouldn’t have appropriate statistical characteristics.

The MNL approach is to make a maximum likelihood estimate of this functional form. The likelihood function is:

:formula_9

we solve for the estimated parameters
:formula_10

that max &quot;L&quot;*. This happens when:

:formula_11

The log-likelihood is easier to work with, as the products turn to sums:

:formula_12

Consider an example adopted from John Bitzan’s Transportation Economics Notes. Let &quot;X&quot; be a binary variable that is equal to 1 with probability &quot;γ&quot;, and equal to 0 with probability (1 − &quot;gamma&quot;). Then f(0) = (1 − &quot;γ&quot;) and f(1) = &quot;γ&quot;. Suppose that we have 5 observations of &quot;X&quot;, giving the sample {1,1,1,0,1}. To find the maximum likelihood estimator of &quot;γ&quot; examine various values of &quot;γ&quot;, and for these values determine the probability of drawing the sample {1,1,1,0,1}
If &quot;γ&quot; takes the value 0, the probability of drawing our sample is 0. If &quot;γ&quot; is 0.1, then the probability of getting our sample is: f(1,1,1,0,1) = f(1)f(1)f(1)f(0)f(1) = 0.1×0.1×0.1×0.9×0.1 = 0.00009 We can compute the probability of obtaining our sample over a range of &quot;γ&quot; – this is our likelihood function. The likelihood function for n independent observations in a logit model is

:formula_13

where: &quot;Yi&quot; = 1 or 0 (choosing e.g. auto or not-auto) and Pi = the probability of observing &quot;Y&quot;&quot;i&quot; = 1

The log likelihood is thus:

:formula_14

In the binomial (two alternative) logit model,

:formula_15, so
:formula_16

The log-likelihood function is maximized setting the partial derivatives to zero:

:formula_17

The above gives the essence of modern MNL choice modeling.

==Additional topics==
Topics not touched on include the “red bus, blue bus” problem; the use of nested models (e.g., estimate choice between auto and transit, and then estimate choice between rail and bus transit); how consumers’ surplus measurements may be obtained; and model estimation, goodness of fit, etc. For these topics see a textbook such as Ortuzar and Willumsen (2001).

==Returning to roots==
The discussion above is based on the economist’s utility formulation. At the time MNL modeling was developed there was some attention to psychologist&#x27;s choice work (e.g., Luce’s choice axioms discussed in his Individual Choice Behavior, 1959). It has an analytic side in computational process modeling. Emphasis is on how people think when they make choices or solve problems (see Newell and Simon 1972). Put another way, in contrast to utility theory, it stresses not the choice but the way the choice was made. It provides a conceptual framework for travel choices and agendas of activities involving considerations of long and short term memory, effectors, and other aspects of thought and decision processes. It takes the form of rules dealing with the way information is searched and acted on. Although there is a lot of attention to behavioral analysis in transportation work, the best of modern psychological ideas are only beginning to enter the field. (e.g. Golledge, Kwan and Garling 1984; Garling, Kwan, and Golledge 1994).

As of a press release in October 2011 from the UN-backed annual International Awards for Liveable Communities (LivCom), Pfaffenhofen an der Ilm was saluted by judges for the quality of its environmental best practice. The Bavarian town of 23,000 people was also named the most liveable city with a population between 20,000-75,000. The elite group of cities fulfilled the awards’ range of key criteria involving environmental best practice, healthy lifestyle of citizens, community involvement as well as arts and cultural heritage.

== History ==
Evidence of Bronze Age settlements have been found in Pfaffenhofen, with burial mounds found in forest areas north of the town.

Historians believe that monks from Ilmmünster Abbey built the Pfaffenhöfe near Altenstadt in the north of the city, in the 8th century.

The oldest seal of Pfaffenhofen dates back to 1333. In 1388, Pfaffenhofen, together with its church and castle, was destroyed during the War of the Cities.

In 1745 it was the site of the Battle of Pfaffenhofen during the War of the Austrian Succession 

In 2017, the horticultural show &#x27;Nature in Pfaffenhofen&#x27; consisted of 89 days of events, which attracted 330,000 visitors.

<doc id="1346073" wikidata="Q644895" url="?curid=1346073" title="Triple Nine Society">
<text>The Triple Nine Society (TNS) is an international high-IQ society for adults whose score on a standardized test demonstrates an IQ at or above the 99.9th percentile of the human population. The society recognizes scores from over 20 intelligence and academic aptitude tests. TNS was founded in 1978, and, , reports a member base of over 1,900 people in 53 US jurisdictions and 39 countries. Since 2010, the organization has been a non-profit 501(c)(7) organization incorporated in Virginia, USA.

==Organization==

The society was founded by Richard Canty, Ronald Hoeflin, Kevin Langdon, Ronald Penner, and Edgar Van Vleck. All five were members of a similarly selective high-IQ society, with whose governance structure they were dissatisfied. 

TNS is a deliberately non-hierarchical society in which the membership is both the main source of authority and the main driver of activity. It is served by an Executive Committee of nine officers; six are elected for two-year terms, and three are appointed.

In 2015, TNS established a 501(c)(3) subsidiary charitable organization, the Triple Nine Society Foundation, to provide scholarships to intellectually gifted students pursuing higher-education goals and for other charitable work.

==Communication==

TNS publishes a bimonthly journal, &quot;Vidya&quot;, which contains articles, poetry, puzzles, and other creative content contributed by members conversant with a variety of subjects, as well as officer reports and other official business of the Society.

TNS members mostly communicate online on the official TNS Discourse forum, official TNS Facebook group, and a variety of unofficial venues ranging from Discord to Telegram and special groups like TNS Youth and TNS LGBTQ+.

Every autumn, the society organizes an annual meeting in the United States called &quot;ggg999&quot;, with &quot;ggg&quot; referring to &quot;Global General Gathering&quot;. A privately organized European gathering, &quot;egg&quot;, usually takes place in late spring.

==Qualifying test scores==

To qualify for membership, an applicant must submit a qualifying score earned on any of the standardized tests recognized by the society; these include IQ tests as well as various college admission exams and military classification tests.

For IQ tests, a qualifying score corresponds to an IQ of at least 146 for tests with standard deviation of 15 (e.g., WAIS, Stanford–Binet 5), at least 149 for tests with a standard deviation of 16 (e.g., Stanford–Binet IV and CTMM), or at least 173 for tests with a standard deviation of 24 (e.g., Cattell III-B). 

TNS also accepts standardized test scores that have a well-established psychometric correlation with IQ, including SAT, GRE, LSAT, ACT, and the Miller Analogies Test. Required score will differ depending on the year those tests were taken.

TNS also accepts a GMAT score of 750 (for tests taken between 2000 and 2023) or a GMAT Focus Edition score of 705 (available since 2023), both of which correspond only to a percentile score of 98.2%.

==Notable members==
* Robert Forster (1941–2019) — actor
* Ronald K. Hoeflin (born 1944) — American librarian, philosopher and amateur psychometrician, co-founder of the society
* Mike Keefe (born 1946) — American editorial cartoonist
* Andrew Koenig (programmer) (born 1952) — computer programmer
* Henry &quot;Hammerin&#x27; Hank&quot; Milligan (born 1958) — American retired professional boxer
* Jack Schaeffer (born 1946) — American musician, recording artist, record producer and arranger
* Andrew York (born 1958) — American classical guitarist and composer

<doc id="1346090" wikidata="Q7833331" url="?curid=1346090" title="Trần Văn Chương">
<text>Trần Văn Chương (; 2 June 1898 – 24 July 1986) was South Vietnam&#x27;s ambassador to the United States from 1954 to 1963 and the father of the country&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; first lady, Madame Nhu (1924–2011). He was also the foreign minister of the Empire of Vietnam, a Japanese puppet state that existed in 1945.

==Family life==
He married Thân Thị Nam Trân (died 24 July 1986), who was a member of the extended Vietnamese royal family. Her father was Thân Trọng Huề, who became Vietnam&#x27;s minister for national education, and her mother was a daughter of Emperor Đồng Khánh. They had a son and two daughters, including Lệ Xuân, who became the wife of Ngô Đình Nhu, the brother of South Vietnam&#x27;s first President, Ngô Đình Diệm.

Chương&#x27;s family alliances enabled him to rise from being a member of a small law practice in the Cochin-Chinese (South Vietnamese) town of Bạc Liêu in the 1920s to become Vietnam&#x27;s first Foreign Secretary under his wife&#x27;s cousin Emperor Bảo Đại, while Japan occupied Vietnam during World War II. His wife Madame Chuong was accused by the French secret police (French Sûreté) of sleeping with Japanese diplomats so her husband was hired by them. He eventually became South Vietnam&#x27;s ambassador to the United States, but resigned in protest and denounced his government&#x27;s anti-Buddhist policies after the Xá Lợi Pagoda raids. He proclaimed there was “not one chance in a hundred for victory” over the Communists with his daughter and her husband and brother-in-law in power.

==1963 South Vietnamese coup d&#x27;état==
On 1 November 1963, Chuong&#x27;s son-in-law Ngô Đình Nhu and Nhu&#x27;s brother, President Ngô Đình Diệm were assassinated in a coup d&#x27;état led by General Dương Văn Minh. Chuong&#x27;s daughter, Ngô Đình Nhu&#x27;s wife, Madame Nhu (1924–2011), was in Beverly Hills, California, at the time of the coup. 

==Death==
Chương and his wife remained in the United States in Washington, D.C. On 24 July 1986, their strangled bodies were found at their home. Their son, Trần Văn Khiêm, was accused but found incompetent to stand trial. The remains of Chương and his wife were interred at Rock Creek Cemetery in Washington, D.C.

<text>John Kerwin Stewart (November 30, 1870 – June 1, 1916) was an entrepreneur and inventor. He founded the Stewart-Warner Corporation. In his lifetime he founded or purchased several companies and held 82 patents.

==Biography==
He was born in 1870 in Hillsborough, New Hampshire. He married Julia Pearl Butler in 1896, the couple had three daughters.

In what became training for their futures in manufacturing, Stewart and Thomas J. Clark worked at a factory in New Hampshire that produced horse clipping machinery. The lifelong friends later moved to Providence, Rhode Island, and worked for the Brown &amp; Sharpe Manufacturing Company. Then, in approximately 1890, the two traveled to Chicago, Illinois, where they entered into partnership and manufactured horse clippers, sheep clippers, bicycle handle bars and flexible shafts among other products.

He died on June 1, 1916, in New York City.

==Companies founded==

===Chicago Flexible Shaft Company===
In 1893 Stewart &amp; Clark founded the Chicago Flexible Shaft Company (incorporated 1897) to manufacture flexible driveshafts and mechanical sheep shears. Stewart and Charles Timson of Wm. Cooper &amp; Nephews partnered in founding the Cooper-Stewart Sheep Shearing Machinery Co in 1896 and sold the sheep shearing products through this new company.

In 1903, Wm. Cooper &amp; Nephews purchased 50% ownership of the Chicago Flexible Shaft Company. In 1908, Wm. Cooper &amp; Nephews purchased the remaining 50% of Chicago Flexible Shaft Company for $400,000. Julia Stewarts nephew remained the president of Chicago Flexible Shaft Company after the sale.

In 1910, the Chicago Flexible Shaft Company introduced its first home appliance, an electric iron, under the brand name Sunbeam. The Sunbeam Mixmaster was introduced in 1930. By 1946, Sunbeam appliances had become so successful and widely sold that the company name would change formally to Sunbeam Corporation.

===Sterk Manufacturing Company===
Around 1896 Stewart and Clark founded the Sterk Manufacturing Company which produced speedometers and automobile horns. The flexible shafts from the Chicago Flexible Shaft Company were used in the production of cables needed for the speedometers.

===Stewart &amp; Clark Manufacturing Company===
In 1905 Stewart &amp; Clark Manufacturing Company was founded and acquired all assets of the Sterk Manufacturing Company.

The partners erected a small manufacturing plant on Diversey Parkway in Chicago. This plant would eventually grow to a one million square foot (93,000 m2) manufacturing and headquarters facility for Stewart-Warner until the company left Chicago in 1988.

Due to his patents, Stewart collected $311,000 in royalties, which were calculated at $5 per speedometer sold in 1909.

Unfortunately, Clark was killed while demonstrating the Stewart speedometer in a Packard during the 1907 Glidden Tour #. Stewart acquired Clarks&#x27; share of the company.

===J.K. Stewart Manufacturing Company===
Due to the need for the blades of clippers &amp; shears to last longer and remain sharp, Stewart worked with Edward Larson to build a heat treatment furnace for tempering steel. In 1906 the two formed the E.A. Larson &amp; Brothers Company to take advantage of the processes they developed to provide die casting for speedometer production as well as other companies in the area. In 1908, E.A. Larson was reorganized as the J.K. Stewart Manufacturing Company.

===Stewart-Warner Speedometer Corporation===
Stewart and rival instrument manufacturer, Warner Instrument Company, were in heated legal battles over patent infringements by both parties. All lawsuits ceased when Stewart bought the Warner Instrument Company in 1912. Stewart-Warner Speedometer Corporation was formed the same year by consolidating the Warner Company with the Stewart &amp; Clark Manufacturing Company. Once again the name changed in 1929 to Stewart-Warner Corporation.

===Stewart Phonograph Company===
A lover of music, Stewart ventured into the phonograph market in 1915. Eventually becoming a division of Stewart-Warner, the phonograph company expanded to include radios, televisions, and the required accessories such as speakers.

==Miscellaneous==
* John K Stewart dictated, onto 18 business phonograph cylinders, instructions for the construction of a oceangoing personal yacht. This yacht was built and named The Sialia.
* Wm. Cooper &amp; Nephews declined the opportunity to purchase a portion of Stewarts&#x27; speedometer company, believing the product was too speculative. - Starting in 1908 Stewart Speedometers were installed in Fords Model-Ts.
* In 1916, Leander H. La Chance, Mrs. Stewart&#x27;s half-nephew, was president of Chicago Flexible Shaft and in 1910 the company produces its first household appliance the Princess Electric Iron under the brand name of Sunbeam, a brand that still provides appliances today.

<doc id="1346096" wikidata="Q3354606" url="?curid=1346096" title="Transfer operator">
<text>In mathematics, the transfer operator encodes information about an iterated map and is frequently used to study the behavior of dynamical systems, statistical mechanics, quantum chaos and fractals. In all usual cases, the largest eigenvalue is 1, and the corresponding eigenvector is the invariant measure of the system.

The transfer operator is sometimes called the Ruelle operator, after David Ruelle, or the Perron–Frobenius operator or Ruelle–Perron–Frobenius operator, in reference to the applicability of the Perron–Frobenius theorem to the determination of the eigenvalues of the operator.

==Definition==
The iterated function to be studied is a map formula_1 for an arbitrary set formula_2. 

The transfer operator is defined as an operator formula_3 acting on the space of functions formula_4 as

:formula_5

where formula_6 is an auxiliary valuation function. When formula_7 has a Jacobian determinant formula_8, then formula_9 is usually taken to be formula_10.

The above definition of the transfer operator can be shown to be the point-set limit of the measure-theoretic pushforward of &quot;g&quot;: in essence, the transfer operator is the direct image functor in the category of measurable spaces. The left-adjoint of the Perron–Frobenius operator is the Koopman operator or composition operator. The general setting is provided by the Borel functional calculus.

As a general rule, the transfer operator can usually be interpreted as a (left-)shift operator acting on a shift space. The most commonly studied shifts are the subshifts of finite type. The adjoint to the transfer operator can likewise usually be interpreted as a right-shift. Particularly well studied right-shifts include the Jacobi operator and the Hessenberg matrix, both of which generate systems of orthogonal polynomials via a right-shift.

==Applications==
Whereas the iteration of a function formula_7 naturally leads to a study of the orbits of points of X under iteration (the study of point dynamics), the transfer operator defines how (smooth) maps evolve under iteration. Thus, transfer operators typically appear in physics problems, such as quantum chaos and statistical mechanics, where attention is focused on the time evolution of smooth functions. In turn, this has medical applications to rational drug design, through the field of molecular dynamics.

It is often the case that the transfer operator is positive, has discrete positive real-valued eigenvalues, with the largest eigenvalue being equal to one. For this reason, the transfer operator is sometimes called the Frobenius–Perron operator.

The eigenfunctions of the transfer operator are usually fractals. When the logarithm of the transfer operator corresponds to a quantum Hamiltonian, the eigenvalues will typically be very closely spaced, and thus even a very narrow and carefully selected ensemble of quantum states will encompass a large number of very different fractal eigenstates with non-zero support over the entire volume. This can be used to explain many results from classical statistical mechanics, including the irreversibility of time and the increase of entropy.

The transfer operator of the Bernoulli map formula_12 is exactly solvable and is a classic example of deterministic chaos; the discrete eigenvalues correspond to the Bernoulli polynomials. This operator also has a continuous spectrum consisting of the Hurwitz zeta function.

The transfer operator of the Gauss map formula_13 is called the Gauss–Kuzmin–Wirsing (GKW) operator. The theory of the GKW dates back to a hypothesis by Gauss on continued fractions and is closely related to the Riemann zeta function.

<doc id="1346098" wikidata="Q1137207" url="?curid=1346098" title="Zhenbao Island">
<text>Zhenbao Island () or Damansky Island () is an island in Hulin, Jixi, Heilongjiang Province, China, with an area of only . It is on the Ussuri River on the border between Primorsky Krai, Russia, and Heilongjiang Province, China.

Prior to the 1991 Sino-Soviet Border Agreement, the island was disputed between China and the Soviet Union. It got its Russian name from the railway engineer Stanislav Damansky, who died there in an incident in 1888 while he was charting the future route for the Trans-Siberian railway.

== Conflict between Soviet Union and China ==
The island was the subject of a territorial dispute between the Soviet Union and China. China (PRC) held that &quot;in the absence of an explicit treaty provision, the central line of the main channel—the Thalweg principle—provided a legal basis for delimiting the boundary in the two rivers. On this basis, Beijing claimed that 600 of the rivers’ 700 islands—including Zhenbao Island on the Ussuri River, just 180 miles southwest of an important Soviet city, Khabarovsk—belonged to the P.R.C.&quot; Battles were fought with a considerable loss of life during the Sino-Soviet border conflict in mid-1969. The dispute over Zhenbao raised concerns that it could ignite World War III until an initial resolution of the conflict in November 1969.

In his memoir, US President Richard Nixon recounted a story that Premier Zhou Enlai (Chou En-lai) had told him about the border dispute: &quot;Later on, when he had loosened up considerably, he told an amusing story that he said took place during a Sino-Soviet border flare-up in 1969. &quot;We had a hot line between the Soviet Union and ourselves then,&quot; he said, &quot;but it had already become cold because the Kremlin never used it. At the time of the Chen Pao [&quot;Zhenbao Island&quot;] border incident, however, Kosygin picked it up and called us. When our operator answered, he said, &#x27;This is Premier Kosygin. I would like to speak to Chairman Mao.&#x27; The operator, completely on his own, said, &#x27;You are a revisionist, and therefore I will not connect you.&#x27; So Kosygin said, &#x27;Well, if you will not try to reach the Chairman, will you please connect me with Prime Minister Chou.&#x27; But the operator gave the same unauthorized reply and broke the connection.&quot;&quot;

On 19 May 1991, both sides came to an agreement that the island was part of the territory of China, and the Soviet troops withdrew.

A 2004 Russian documentary film, &quot;Damansky Island Year 1969.&quot; (&quot;Остров Даманский. 1969 год&quot;), was made about the 1969 Zhenbao incident.

<text>Harland &amp; Wolff Welders Football Club is a semi-professional, Northern Irish football club playing in the NIFL Championship.

==History==
The club, founded in 1965, hails from Belfast and played its home matches at Tillysburn Park in the East of the city. In October 2021 the H&amp;W Welders moved from Tillysburn park into a redevelopment of Blanchflower Park Stadium costing over £5m with 3G pitches and new stands. A new stadium and facilities in the Danny Blanchflower Playing Fields was under construction by 2020, suitable for Premiership football.

The club was formed by the welders of the nearby Harland &amp; Wolff shipyard. The club&#x27;s colours are amber and black to display the link with Harland &amp; Wolff shipyard and its cranes. Harland &amp; Wolff Welders share a long running rivalry with fellow East Belfast Championship side Dundela. In April 2014 they formed a partnership with Harland Youth, a young club composed of six teams of all ages and they will now be called H&amp;W Welders Youth. The club would also have quite a close relationship with Glentoran, with many former Glens players turning out for the club.

<doc id="1346104" wikidata="Q7933266" url="?curid=1346104" title="Violet Milner, Viscountess Milner">
<text>Violet Georgina Milner, Viscountess Milner (&quot;née&quot; Maxse; 1 February 1872 – 10 October 1958) was an English socialite of the Victorian and Edwardian eras and, later, editor of the political monthly &quot;National Review&quot;. Her father was close friends with Georges Clemenceau, she married a son of Prime Minister Salisbury, Lord Edward Cecil, and after his death, Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner.

==Life==
Violet was born at 38 Rutland Gate, Knightsbridge, the youngest of four children born to Admiral Frederick Maxse and Cecilia Steel. Her siblings were Gen. Sir Ivor Maxse (1862–1958), a British Army officer of the First World War; Leopold Maxse (1864–1932), editor of the &quot;National Review&quot;, and Olive Hermione Maxse (1867–1955), a model for Edward Burne-Jones. Admiral Maxse delivered despatches during the Crimean War, and he was one of only two outspoken supporters of the French position regarding Alsace-Lorraine after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870. This drew the attention of Georges Clemenceau, and the two became friends. As a teenager, Violet lived two years in Paris, studying music and art, often attending opera and theatre shows with Clemenceau.

One of the highlights of 1897 for Violet was Queen Victoria&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee Celebration, on 22 June, when she joined the Cecil family on a stand at Whitehall to watch the parade.

With the breakdown of peace negotiations in South Africa between English and Dutch settlers, leading the Boer War in 1899, the British increased their military presence there by dispatching 2,000 soldiers. Among them was Major Edward Cecil and his wife. Arriving in Cape Town on 26 July, Violet wrote often to her cousin, future Prime Minister Arthur Balfour, in support of England and the policies of its High Commissioner for South Africa, Sir Alfred Milner. With the Cecils and Milner residing at Government House, the three were good friends and lived under the same roof until 14 August, when the Cecils were ordered to move north. When Major Cecil became trapped in the Siege of Mafeking (from 13 October 1899 to 17 May 1900), Violet stayed at Groote Schuur, the estate of mining magnate and politician Cecil Rhodes. She wrote of her experiences during this time in her autobiography, &quot;My Picture Gallery&quot;, published in 1951.

She exchanged letters with Alfred, and alongside Violet Markham and Edith Lyttelton she established the Victoria League in 1901 to promote Milner&#x27;s imperial vision of the British Empire. She met up with Lord Milner again at a Christmas party held at Lord Goschen&#x27;s country estate Seacox, Hawkhurst in December 1905.

Lady Milner took over as editor of the family owned, conservative journal &quot;The National Review&quot; after the death of her brother Leopold Maxse in 1932, having supported the publication since he fell ill in 1929. The magazine was known for its opposition to imperial Germany prior to the First World War, and to appeasement in the interwar years. Its editor staunchly defended Conservative leader Bonar Law.

In January 1917, French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau, speaking to President Raymond Poincaré, famously said of Lord Milner:

&quot;He is an old friend of mine. We admired and loved the same woman. That&#x27;s an indissoluble bond.&quot;

Viscountess Milner was present in France on 11 November 1933, the 15th anniversary of the Armistice, where she dedicated a marble bust of her late husband, Alfred, in a conference room on the first floor of the Hôtel de Ville (town hall) in Doullens. It was here at Lord Milner&#x27;s urging, in a conference attended by Clemenceau, Poincare, and French and English Generals on 26 March 1918, that the Western Front was united under a single command in World War I. Today, the town hall bears the inscription:

&quot;In this town hall, on the 26th of March 1918, the &quot;Allies&quot; entrusted General Foch with the supreme command on the Western Front. This decision saved France and the liberty of the world.&quot;

According to Leopold Amery the decision to appoint General Foch was made a day earlier in a meeting between Lord Milner and Prime Minister Clemenceau. As General Foch was not on the list of Clemenceau&#x27;s promotable generals (he was out of favour), Lord Milner&#x27;s influence with Clemenceau made the decision easy. On 20 April 1918, in his first public statement after being appointed Secretary of State for War, Lord Milner said in the French newspaper &quot;Le Temps&quot;:

&quot;Our fighters are worthy of the test they face. Attacked by divisions far more numerous than ours, they supplement the number by courage, and they decimate the assailant. We are happy to see our French allies doing them justice.&quot; &quot;I have not waited until now, neither to understand the usefulness of a single command, nor to recognize the value of General Foch. I was personally associated with the measures which created the current organization of the command, and I congratulate myself on the cordial confidence which has constantly reigned between Mr. Clemenceau and myself.&quot; &quot;It is not in vain that we will have shared the same anxieties fraternally, then the same joys. The days in which we are living create imperishable bonds.&quot;

Violet discussed her family&#x27;s long time friendship with Georges Clemenceau in &quot;The National Review&quot;, and in her book, &quot;Clemenceau Intime&quot;.

She died on 10 October 1958, aged 86, at her home near Hawkhurst.

==Family==
She married, firstly, Lord Edward Cecil, the youngest son of Prime Minister Salisbury on &quot;18 June 1894&quot; at St Saviour&#x27;s Church, Chelsea. The officiant was his brother Rev William Cecil. A wide range of society guests appeared at the wedding, H. H. Asquith, John Morley, 1st Viscount Morley and Joseph Chamberlain, as well as his cousin Arthur Balfour and father Salisbury, and liberal poets Wilfred Scawen Blunt and Oscar Wilde. His mother, Lady Salisbury remarked: &quot;It will be good for Nigs to have a clever wife and one accustomed to taking care of expenses and I hope will convert her. I don&#x27;t believe in pious pagans - and my only real objection to the Souls, is their heathenry.&quot; His father warned him about her character; and settled a further £1,000 pa having settled his debts again. Lord Edward earned £200 pa in Army pay, but his wife&#x27;s contribution was double that, making their life comfortable. Salisbury urged them to work on their relationship, but the marriage was unhappy.

She and Lord Edward Cecil had two children: 
*One son, George Edward Gascoyne-Cecil born on 9 September 1895. He was a Lieutenant in the Grenadier Guards, and was killed in action in the First World War on 1 September 1914 on the Western Front. Rudyard Kipling, Georges Clemenceau, and former President Theodore Roosevelt helped her track down his fate.
*One daughter, Helen Mary Gascoyne-Cecil, who was born on 11 May 1901. She was an author. She married Alexander Hardinge, 2nd Baron Hardinge of Penshurst, and died in 1979.

Violet was appointed Grand Dame of the Order of St John, and Chevalier of the &quot;Légion d&#x27;honneur&quot;.

Lord Edward died on &quot;13 December 1918&quot; of the Spanish influenza, and she married Lord Milner at St James&#x27;s Church, Paddington on 26 February 1921. Violet and Lord Milner were married 12 days after Lord Milner&#x27;s retirement from Prime Minister Lloyd George&#x27;s government on &quot;14 February 1921&quot;. They had a great marriage. On &quot;22 May 1928&quot; she turned over important information relating to the First World War and Lord Milner&#x27;s role at the Doullens Conference in France to the Public Records Office.

Upon Lord Milner&#x27;s death in May 1925, Violet inherited nearly £46,000 (£2.8 million in 2020). In 1929 she donated Sturry Court, Milner&#x27;s residence in Canterbury, to The King&#x27;s School, Canterbury. The site now houses the Junior Kings School. She continued to maintain Great Wigsell, her manor home in Salehurst, and 14 Manchester Square, their joint house in London.

<doc id="1346106" wikidata="Q1429468" url="?curid=1346106" title="Neville Wran">
<text>Neville Kenneth Wran, (11 October 1926 – 20 April 2014) was an Australian politician who was the Premier of New South Wales from 1976 to 1986. He was the national president of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) from 1980 to 1986 and chairman of both the Lionel Murphy Foundation and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) from 1986 to 1991.

==Early years==
Wran was born in the Sydney suburb of Paddington, the eighth and last child of Joseph Wran and his wife Lillian ( Langley). He was educated at Nicholson Street Public School, Balmain, Fort Street Boys High and the University of Sydney, where he was a member of the Liberal Club, and from which he gained a Bachelor of Laws in 1948. He was admitted as a solicitor in 1951, called to the Bar in 1957, and became a Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1968.

His great-grandfather, the eminent High Victorian architectural sculptor, Thomas Vallance Wran (1832–1891), whose carvings can be seen on the Martin Place front of the General Post Office, came from Chichester. Thomas Wran – the surname is Austrian – settled initially at St Lawrence, Queensland, before he established himself in Caroline Street, Balmain, in 1872.

==Political career==
Wran began his political career in 1970 when he became a member of the upper house of the Parliament of New South Wales, the Legislative Council. Three years afterwards, he moved to the lower house, the Legislative Assembly, in the seat of Bass Hill. Support for this move had been organised by the General Secretary of the FMWU, Ray Gietzelt. He then challenged Pat Hills for the state leadership of the Labor Party (which Hills had held since 1968). In this challenge he had cross-faction support from right-wing powerbroker John Ducker and left-winger Jack Ferguson. There were two rounds to the leadership vote which resulted in a tie between Hills and Wran in the second ballot. However, under Labor Party rules of the time, in the event of a tie in the second ballot, the candidate who won the most votes in the first ballot would be the winner. Since Wran had won one vote more than Hills in the first ballot, Wran was therefore declared the new leader.

In May 1976, six months after Gough Whitlam&#x27;s federal Labor government&#x27;s dismissal, Wran led Labor to victory, narrowly defeating the Liberal Party premier, Sir Eric Willis. Wran&#x27;s win was not assured until it became clear that Gosford and Hurstville had fallen to Labor by only 74 and 44 votes respectively, giving Wran a one-seat majority.

In 1978, Willis resigned, causing a by-election to be held for the seat of Earlwood, which had been held by the Liberal Party for three decades. Labor won the by-election, beating the Liberal candidate Alan Jones. Later that year, campaigning with the slogan &quot;Wran&#x27;s our Man&quot;, his government won a 13-seat swing, popularly known as the &quot;Wranslide&quot;. This came on the back of 57.7 percent of the primary vote, the largest primary vote for any party in a century. The Opposition Leader on that occasion, Peter Coleman, lost his seat.

In 1981, Wran won a second &quot;Wranslide&quot;, picking up a six-seat swing for what is still NSW Labor&#x27;s largest proportion of seats in Parliament (69 out of 99 seats, 69.7 percent of the chamber). The Opposition Leader, Bruce McDonald, failed to be elected to the seat that he contested, marking the second time in a row that an Opposition Leader had failed to be elected to Parliament. Labor also reduced the Liberals to 14 seats, the same as its nominal junior partner, the National Country Party. He won a fourth term in 1984; although he suffered an 11-seat swing, he still won a larger majority than any of the victories won by the Liberals&#x27; Sir Robert Askin in the 1960s and 1970s.

In 1977, Wran supported Al Grassby, former Federal Immigration Minister, in allowing Domenico Barbaro, a Mafia figure in the Griffith region of New South Wales, back into Australia after having been earlier deported because of his criminal record. However, as journalist David Hickie explains, Wran attempted to undermine the influence of organised crime, particularly in the area of illegal casinos.

Wran was also very popular, at one stage rating over 80 per cent approval in opinion polls. He was often talked about as a national political leader and rated highly in national polls as an alternative Labor Leader to Bill Hayden. He featured in Hayden&#x27;s 1980 federal election campaign, along with Bob Hawke.

Wran&#x27;s first half of his tenure as a Labor premier came at a time when most Australian governments were held by conservative coalitions, a trend subsequently reversed in the early 1980s following the elections of Labor governments to both federal and state parliaments. During his 10 years as Premier of New South Wales, the government embarked on a program of reform and change. Priorities were public transport (with the exception of the Warringah Transport Corridor which was cancelled despite a recommendation by Justice Michael Kirby that it be built), the environment, consumer protection and job creation. He also achieved significant electoral institutional reform such as a democratic Legislative Council, four-year terms, public funding and disclosure laws and a pecuniary interests register for members of parliament. He called on Edwin Lusher, firstly while a QC and then as a Judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, to chair commissions of inquiry into police administration and gambling. He also undertook the state&#x27;s largest capital works program and refurbished many iconic places in Sydney. His government also built the modern-day Darling Harbour precinct.

In 1983, Wran faced the Street Royal Commission over claims by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) current affairs show &quot;Four Corners&quot; that he had tried to influence the magistracy over the 1977 committal of Kevin Humphreys, who had been charged with misappropriation of funds. He was completely exonerated, and sued the ABC for defamation. His Corrective Services Minister, Rex Jackson, was jailed in 1987 for accepting bribes for the early release of prisoners.

In 1984, Wran introduced a private members bill to decriminalise adult gay male sex, and the bill passed the NSW Parliament. This was the first time in NSW history a conscience vote was both introduced and passed by the NSW Parliament.
Wran resigned both the premiership and his seat in Parliament on 4 July 1986, after continuously holding office longer than any other premier in the history of New South Wales until that time (10 years and 81 days). Bob Carr has since broken that record. (Henry Parkes served longer than both Wran and Carr in total, serving for 11 years and 278 days over five terms between 1872 and 1891.) The by-election for Wran&#x27;s seat of Bass Hill was narrowly won by Michael Owen for the Liberal Party—a harbinger of his party&#x27;s heavy defeat at the state election two years later.

In March 2021, ABC Television broadcast an investigative documentary series, &quot;The Ghost Train Fire&quot; as a second series of the Exposed program which directly implicated Saffron in an arson plot at Luna Park Sydney in 1979, resulting in the deaths of seven people, six of them children.

It was alleged by the program that the motive was control of the valuable harbourside land next to the Sydney Harbour Bridge and with unobstructed views of the Sydney Opera House. It was the intention of Saffron and associate Jack Rooklyn, a poker-machine promoter, to gain control of and redevelop the Luna Park site. NSW premiers Robert Askin and Neville Wran have been named as corrupt close associates of Saffron, along with the police commissioner Norman &quot;Bill&quot; Allan, the High Court justice Lionel Murphy and lawyer Morgan Ryan, among others.

Wran is remembered by the phrase &quot;Balmain boys don&#x27;t cry&quot; in his speech at the June 1983 ALP Annual Conference. At a press conference after announcing his departure Wran was asked what was his greatest achievement as premier, he answered, &quot;saving the rainforests&quot;.

==Personal life==

Wran&#x27;s first marriage was in 1946 at the age of 20, to Marcia Oliver, a showgirl at the New Tivoli Theatre. Oliver had a young son, whom Wran adopted, and they had one other child together, actress Kim Wran. In 1976, a month after his divorce was finalised and three months after becoming Premier of New South Wales, Wran married Jill Hickson, and they had two children together. Wran and Hickson separated several times, first briefly in 2006, then in August 2011 after Hickson said she had been &quot;frozen out&quot; of her husband&#x27;s personal affairs by his daughter Kim and his friend and business partner Albert Wong. They had reconciled by December 2011.

A severe throat infection in 1980 required injections of teflon to strengthen his damaged vocal cords, resulting in his characteristic croaky voice.

==Death==
In his later years, Wran had dementia and from July 2012 had been under special care at the Lulworth House aged care facility in Elizabeth Bay. He died there on Easter Sunday, 20 April 2014 at the age of 87. He was survived by his wife Jill and four children.

A state funeral was held at the Sydney Town Hall on 1 May 2014.

==Honours==
* In June 1987 he was appointed an Officer in the Order of the Golden Ark (Netherlands) &quot;for his contribution to the environment&quot;.
* In October 1987 he was appointed a Grand Officer (2nd Class) of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic by the President of Italy, Francesco Cossiga.
* He was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia on 26 January 1988 &quot;For service to government and politics and to the New South Wales Parliament&quot;.
* On 6 May 1995 the University of Sydney awarded Wran the degree of Doctor of Laws (honoris causa).
* In the 2010 New Year Honours, Wran was appointed a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to New Zealand–Australia relations.

==Named in Panama Papers==
On 12 May 2016, Wran was named in the Panama Papers (which also named then-Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull), due to his former directorship of the Mossack Fonseca-incorporated company &quot;Star Technology Systems Limited&quot;. Wran resigned from that position in 1995. A report by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation notes that &quot;There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing by either Mr Turnbull or Mr Wran.&quot;

<doc id="1346118" wikidata="Q4450172" url="?curid=1346118" title="1918 United States House of Representatives elections">
<text>The 1918 United States House of Representatives elections were elections for the United States House of Representatives to elect members to serve in the 66th United States Congress. They were held for the most part on November 5, 1918, while Maine held theirs on September 9. They occurred in the middle of President Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s second term.

With the country in World War I (contrary to previous promises by Wilson), and Wilson&#x27;s personal popularity ebbing, the Republicans gained 25 seats and took over control of the House from Wilson&#x27;s Democrats. Internal divide among Democratic leadership over aspects related to payment of the war also decreased the unity of the party, which had been the organization&#x27;s strength during the decade. The Progressive Party also disappeared, with its former members generally becoming Democrats. Minnesota&#x27;s Farmer–Labor Party, a descendant of populism, also gained its very first seat.

Frederick H. Gillett (R-Massachusetts) became Speaker, and previous speaker Champ Clark (D-Missouri) became Minority Leader.

==Background==

Woodrow Wilson was elected to the presidency in the 1912 presidential election and his victory in the 1916 election made him the first Democratic president to win reelection since Andrew Jackson had in the 1832 election.

Wilson&#x27;s wheat policies aided in the Democratic defeat. The Food and Fuel Control Act allowed for the cost of wheat to be set at a price control limit of $2.20 per bushel while other products like cotton were not. Wilson later vetoed an attempt by the Republicans to increase the limit to $2.40 per bushel. Republicans were more likely to gain seats in areas with higher amounts of wheat acreage with the Republicans gaining twenty-two seats in the ten highest wheat producing states while the Democrats only gained two seats.

Wilson was also unable to aid the Democratic candidates before the election due to his preparations for involvement in the Paris Peace Conference.

==Overall results==

1 One vacancy, Victor L. Berger, a member of the Socialist Party of America, whom the House refused to seat.

<doc id="1346121" wikidata="Q594702" url="?curid=1346121" title="Anton Sikharulidze">
<text>Anton Tarielyevich Sikharulidze (Georgian: ანტონ ტარიელის ძე სიხარულიძე; , born 25 October 1976) is a Georgian-Russian former pair skater. With Elena Berezhnaya, he is the 1998 and 1999 World champion, 1998 Olympic silver medalist and 2002 Olympic champion.

His first partner was Maria Petrova, with whom he became the 1994 and 1995 World Junior Champion. He began competing with Berezhnaya in 1996 after helping her recover from an accident with her previous partner. Within two years of the accident, Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze had established themselves as one of the best pair teams in the world. During their competitive career, they were coached by Tamara Moskvina at the Yubileyny Sports Palace in Saint Petersburg, Russia, and the Ice House in Hackensack, New Jersey. Their Olympic gold medals are shared with Canadian pair Jamie Salé and David Pelletier.

In September 2021 Netflix premiered docuseries Bad Sport that includes an episode (&quot;Gold War&quot;) detailing the events of the 2002 Winter Olympics figure skating scandal. Sikharulidze appeared only in archival footage and did not participate in the documentary, though his former partner Berezhnaya did.

== Early life ==
Anton Sikharulidze was born on 25 October 1976 in Leningrad, now known as Saint Petersburg, to a Russian mother and Georgian father. His sister, Marina, is an economist, and his brother, Alexander, is a businessman.

== Early career ==
Sikharulidze asked his parents for skates after seeing a neighbor&#x27;s boy with a pair. At the age of 15, he considered leaving the sport, feeling it was taking up a lot of his time and limiting his personal life, but his father encouraged him to persevere.

Sikharulidze took up pair skating at age 15 when asked by a coach. With Maria Petrova, he became the 1994 and 1995 World Junior Champion and placed as high as sixth at the senior Worlds in 1995. They trained under Ludmila Velikova and Nikolai Velikov at the Yubileyny Sports Palace in Saint Peterburg, Russia, despite the deteriorating and crowded facilities of the 1990s. Their last competition together was the European Championships at the end of January 1996. Sikharulidze and Petrova then parted ways due to a coaching disagreement. He wanted to work with Moskvina while Petrova preferred to remain with their old coaches.

== Partnership with Elena Berezhnaya ==
In late 1995, Elena Berezhnaya and Oleg Shliakhov of Latvia began training at the same rink, under coach Tamara Moskvina. Sikharulidze developed a friendship with Berezhnaya and Shliakhov began to perceive him as his rival. At the end of 1995, Shliakhov demanded that he and Berezhnaya train in Riga, Latvia for three weeks in preparation for the European Championships. Sikharulidze urged her to stay in Saint Petersburg but she believed she could manage a few weeks. Berezhnaya was seriously injured when Shliakhov&#x27;s blade sliced into her skull while the pair were practicing a side-by-side camel spin in Riga on 9 January 1996. Two surgical operations were performed to remove bone fragments from her brain. The accident caused partial paralysis on her right side, and doctors were unsure if she would walk again. She also briefly lost the ability to speak.

During her hospitalization, Sikharulidze heard of the news, and traveled to Latvia to be with her, joining Moskvina. Berezhnaya was surprised and overjoyed to see him, but unable to speak or move. Shliakhov also arrived at the hospital with flowers but Berezhnaya did not wish to see him again. Her mother, Sikharulidze, and Moskvina took her back to Saint Petersburg, Russia where she could begin her rehabilitation. She was grateful for his support, saying she was &quot;skinny, shaved, half-alive, almost a skeleton, and Anton so tenderly cared about me. Perhaps it was his belief in me that helped me recover so quickly.&quot;

Berezhnaya wished to return to the ice and doctors agreed that physical exercise would be therapeutic. On 15 March 1996, only two months after the accident, she began skating carefully with Sikharulidze&#x27;s help and Moskvina observing. Berezhnaya said, &quot;I didn&#x27;t have any false dreams about the future. All I thought about was those first steps.&quot; Moskvina felt the pair looked promising, &quot;They&#x27;re a natural pair. They&#x27;ve got it – something magical.&quot;

With Berezhnaya&#x27;s condition improving, the two began to consider the possibility of a competitive career together. She had made a nearly full recovery, although her speech remained slurred requiring speech therapy. Berezhnaya/Sikharulidze made their competitive debut in November 1996 at the Trophée Lalique, winning bronze. In December, they placed fifth at Cup of Russia, and then captured the silver medal at the Russian Nationals, earning them a berth to the European Championships. In January 1997 in Paris, Berezhnaya/Sikharulidze made the podium at their first Europeans together, obtaining the bronze medal. At the 1997 World Championships in March, their short program placed them provisionally in third, with two judges giving them first-place votes. However, the pair placed 12th in the long program and dropped to 9th overall.

== 1998 Olympic season ==
The next season, Berezhnaya/Sikharulidze won the European Championship, defeating 1992 Olympic champion Artur Dmitriev with his new partner Oksana Kazakova, and the reigning World Champions Mandy Wötzel/Ingo Steuer. At only 20 and 21 years of age respectively, Berezhnaya/Sikharulidze had established themselves as gold-medal favorites going into the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan. They also won the Grand Prix Finals that year. Observers were impressed by their rapid progress. Ekaterina Gordeeva selected the pair as her and Sergei Grinkov&#x27;s skating doubles in a documentary on the legendary team after her husband&#x27;s death.

At the Olympics, the pair had one fall in the short program but their other elements were of high quality. In the long, they put themselves back in contention for the gold medal with a strong performance, until five seconds from the end when they had a surprising fall as Sikharulidze set her down from a closing star lift. Although disappointed by suddenly giving away their chance at the gold so close to the end of the program, Sikharulidze recovered from his shock and joked, &quot;It&#x27;s a new finish. If you don&#x27;t like it, we&#x27;ll change it, no problem.&quot; The quality of the rest of their skating earned them the silver medal ahead of Wötzel/Steuer, while Kazakova/Dmitriev claimed the title. Former Japanese singles skater Yuko Kawaguchi became inspired to switch to pair skating after seeing Elena Berezhnaya at the Nagano Olympics.

== Post-1998 Olympics ==
Following the Olympics, Berezhnaya/Sikharulidze competed at the 1998 World Championships where they won the gold medal. Later in the year, they spent some time training at the Stamford Twin Rinks in Stamford, Connecticut. They won 1998 Skate America and 1998 NHK Trophy. In January 1999, they had to withdraw from the European Championships after the short program due to Berezhnaya having the flu. They won their second world title at the 1999 World Championships in March 1999.

The Yubileyny Sports Palace ice rink then closed for renovations, forcing the pair and Moskvina to relocate to Hackensack, New Jersey&#x27;s Ice House in the summer of 1999. Berezhnaya/Sikharulidze struggled at Skate America in October 1999, placing third, but regained their form to win Skate Canada in November. Moskvina would later admit Sikharulidze had become distracted by life in a new country and was not as focused on training. In February 2000, the pair won gold at the 2000 Europeans but were stripped of their medals after Berezhnaya tested positive for pseudoephedrine, a substance whose ban was lifted temporarily between 2004 and 2010 before being banned again. This resulted in a three-month disqualification from the date of the test, and the medal being stripped. She stated that she had taken cold medication approved by a doctor but had failed to inform the ISU as required. The pair missed the World Championships that year as a result of the disqualification.

Berezhnaya/Sikharulidze developed a rivalry with Canadians Jamie Salé and David Pelletier. The 2001 World Championships were held in Salé/Pelletier&#x27;s home country of Canada. Although Salé fell on the triple toe loop in the short program and then singled her double Axel in the long, Salé/Pelletier were awarded gold ahead of Berezhnaya/Sikharulidze. At the 2001 European Championships, Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze reclaimed their title.

In autumn 2001, Sikharulidze required stitches for a long gash along his arm when his partner&#x27;s blade accidentally cut him in training just before the start of the Grand Prix season. The injury having delayed their preparations, Berezhnaya/Sikharulidze used their Charlie Chaplin program at the start of the season and debuted their new long program to Meditation de Thais at the Grand Prix Final in December. The pair decided to keep their new programs for the Olympics, while their rivals abandoned their new long program, with which they had been struggling, and decided to reuse their old &quot;Love Story&quot; program. &quot;The New York Times&quot; speculated that the judging might be influenced by the crowd response, with the familiar music of Love Story having more potential to draw louder applause in North America and the judges not being immune to human reactions.

== 2002 Olympics ==

At the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, both pairs skated strong short programs, after which Berezhnaya/Sikharulidze were in first and Salé/Pelletier, who had a fall at the end of their program, second. In the long program, Berezhnaya/Sikharulidze skated a good program although Sikharulidze had a stumble on a jump element before quickly regaining unison with his partner. Salé/Pelletier, meanwhile, had no obvious mistakes. Four judges placed the Canadians first, while five had Berezhnaya/Sikharulidze as the winners, with the Canadians receiving higher technical scores and the Russians higher presentation scores. They were awarded the gold and the Canadians the silver. The result sparked a controversy with the media emphasizing Sikharulidze&#x27;s stepout, although there was no media criticism a year earlier when Salé/Pelletier were awarded gold at the 2001 World Championships. The commentators received criticism for failing to mention Berezhnaya/Sikharulidze&#x27;s strengths, with some observers stating that the pair had performed a more challenging program with greater speed, more interweaving moves and transitions, and less distance between the partners.

The International Skating Union&#x27;s Technical Committee decided to look into the matter, first approaching French judge Marie-Reine Le Gougne, the only Western judge in favor of the Russian pair. She allegedly said that she had been intimidated by the head of the French skating organization into voting for the Russian pair in exchange for an advantage for the French couple in the ice dancing competition, which was to follow a few days later. A second gold medal was awarded to the Canadian pair, and the IOC and ISU decided to declare both pairs as Olympic co-champions. Later, Le Gougne rescinded her earlier statement and declared she had voted according to her honest assessment of the performances but had been pressured to say otherwise.

== Later skating career ==
In May 2003, Berezhnaya/Sikharulidze confirmed they had retired from competitive skating. From 2002 to 2006, they toured with Stars on Ice, then returned to Russia.

Sikharulidze makes occasional appearances in Russian ice shows. In 2006, he competed in a Channel One (Russia) show &quot;Stars on Ice (Russian: Звёзды на льду)&quot;, partnered with Natalia Ionova (later replaced by Yulia Barsukova due to injury). In 2007, he skated in the Channel One show &quot;Ice Age&quot;, partnered with Anastasia Volochkova. In 2010, he joined another edition of &quot;Ice Age&quot;, teaming up with Zara.

== Political career ==

In 2006, he became a member of the political party United Russia. In 2007, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Saint Petersburg. On 2 December 2007, he was elected to the State Duma. He is the Chairman of the Russian State Duma Committee for Physical Culture and Sport.

In 2010, he registered as a candidate for the presidency of the Figure Skating Federation of Russia, but withdrew after the constitution was altered, stating that the changes left the president as nothing more than a figurehead.

== Personal life ==
Sikharulidze and Berezhnaya had an on-and-off romantic relationship between 1996 and 2002; they remain close friends. In August 2010, Sikharulidze became the godfather to Berezhnaya&#x27;s son. He was married to Yana Lebedeva from 2011 to 2013.
 With his partner, Viktoria, he has a son, Georgiy, born on 24 March 2014 near Moscow.

<text>The Lord Elgin Hotel is a prominent hotel in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. With 355 guest rooms, it is located at 100 Elgin Street at Laurier Avenue, across from Confederation Park in Downtown Ottawa. The twelve-storey limestone structure was named after James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin, the first Governor General of the united Canadas.

== About ==

The Lord Elgin Hotel has 355 guestrooms and four suites, all of them refurbished since 2001.

==History and architecture==

The hotel was designed by the firm of Ross and MacDonald, which were the successors of Ross and MacFarlane, who designed the Chateau Laurier. It was opened in July 1941 by R.T. Ford &amp; Company to compete with the Château Laurier. Unlike the Château, however, the Lord Elgin was built to primarily serve short-stay guests, particularly those who were in Ottawa on government and military business during the Second World War, especially after the recent loss of the nearby Russell Hotel. As a result, the hotel did not originally contain any ballrooms or elegant restaurants, as would have been expected in a large hotel at that time, and the guest rooms were relatively small.

The building features stone walls which are complete with broken courses and are finished by flattened oriel windows and modernistic chevrons. The building is topped by a steep copper chateauesque roof, which, William Lyon Mackenzie King apparently urged the architects to include to reflect the Parliament buildings copper roof.

In the 1970s and 1980s, the hotel&#x27;s impressive facade hid the decline in its fortunes due to changes in the economy, increased competition from international hotel chains also located in the downtown core, and new demands from an ever-evolving younger traveling business class. Significant renovations in the 1990s and 2000s resulted in the construction of large additions to the north and south of the building, the refurbishment and enlargement of existing rooms, and the addition of 60 new guestrooms, new meeting rooms and a new fitness facility which was finished in 2002.

The interior showcases busts of James Bruce and his wife, Maria Louisa. Contemporary renovations have significantly altered the original streamlined art-deco inspired lobby.

<doc id="1346128" wikidata="Q5691142" url="?curid=1346128" title="Health risks from dead bodies">
<text>The health risks of dead bodies are dangers related to the improper preparation and disposal of cadavers. While normal circumstances allow cadavers to be quickly embalmed, cremated, or buried; natural and man-made disasters can quickly overwhelm and/or interrupt the established protocols for dealing with the dead. Under such circumstances, the decomposition and putrefaction of cadavers goes unchecked, and raises a series of health, logistical, and psychological issues. After disasters with extensive loss of life due to trauma rather than disease—earthquakes, storms, human conflict, etc.—many resources are often expended on burying the dead quickly, and applying disinfectant to bodies for the specific purpose of preventing disease. Specialists say that spraying is a waste of disinfectant and manpower, that &quot;resources that should be going into establishment of water supply, sanitation, shelter, warmth and hygienic food for the survivors are being applied to digging mass graves&quot;, and that &quot;Time and time again, eminent and authoritative experts have pointed out that dead bodies do not constitute a health hazard&quot;.

==False risks==
According to health professionals, the fear of spread of disease by bodies killed by trauma rather than disease is not justified. Among others, Steven Rottman, director of the UCLA Center for Public Health and Disasters, said that no scientific evidence exists that bodies of disaster victims increase the risk of epidemics, adding that cadavers posed less risk of contagion than living people. In disasters involving trauma where there is competition for resources, efforts should be focused on establishment of water supply, sanitation, shelter, warmth and hygienic food for the survivors, not digging mass graves. Spraying is a waste of disinfectant and manpower. Indiscriminate burial of corpses demoralises survivors and the lack of death certificates can cause practical problems to survivors.
Other considerations which are very important, but not directly relevant to the topic of health risks, include religious and cultural practices, the stench, and the effect on morale.

===Roots of incorrect notion===
The incorrect notion that &quot;all&quot; dead bodies inherently cause diseases is consistent with:
#The incorrect historical miasma theory of disease, which held that diseases are spread by foul air—in this case fouled by the stench of decomposing corpses.
#Confusion between normal decay processes and signs of disease; and the incorrect idea that microorganisms responsible for decomposition are dangerous to living people. &quot;Microorganisms involved in the decay process (putrefaction) are not pathogenic&quot;.
#After a major disaster disease among survivors is indeed a problem, but is actually due to living in harsh conditions with poor sanitation. &quot;Survivors present a much more important reservoir for disease [than cadavers]&quot;.
#Noting that corpses of those who died from certain contagious diseases (for example, in epidemics) do, indeed, spread disease, such as is the case with ebola, smallpox, and the 1918 flu, and incorrectly generalising this to all corpses.

According to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) &quot;concern that dead bodies are infectious can be considered a &#x27;natural&#x27; reaction by persons wanting to protect themselves from disease&quot; although &quot;the risk that bodies [of those killed in a natural disaster] pose for the public is extremely small&quot;.

==Real risks==
Contamination of water supplies by unburied bodies, burial sites, or temporary storage sites may result in the spread of gastroenteritis from normal intestinal contents.
According to a PAHO article on the Infectious Disease Risks From Dead Bodies Following Natural Disasters: 

To those in close contact with the dead, such as rescue workers, there is a health risk from chronic infectious diseases which those killed may have been suffering from and which spread by direct contact, including hepatitis B and hepatitis C, HIV, enteric intestinal pathogens, tuberculosis, cholera and others.

The substances cadaverine and putrescine are produced during the decomposition of animal (including human) bodies, and both give off a foul odor. They are toxic if massive doses are ingested (acute oral toxicity of 2 g per kg of body weight of pure putrescine in rats, a larger dose for cadaverine); there are no effects at all for a tenth of that dose. While figures for humans are not available, allometric scaling, which takes into account body surface area, is often used to compare doses in different animals, with useful results. Scaling 2g/kg from rats suggests that a 60 kg (132 lb) person would be significantly affected by of pure putrescine. For comparison the similar substance spermine, found in semen, is over 3 times as toxic.

<text>Moyola Park Association Football Club is an intermediate, Northern Irish football club playing in the NIFL Premier Intermediate League. The club, founded in 1880, hails from Castledawson, near Magherafelt, County Londonderry, and plays its home matches at Fortwilliam Park with the club groundsharing with Tobermore United following the closure of Mill Meadow. Club colours are royal blue and yellow. The club won the inaugural Irish Cup in 1881. The club is managed by Kenny Shiels.

==History==
Moyola Park was formed during season 1879–80 under the patronage of Lord Spencer Chichester, the landlord of the Moyola Park estate. The first recorded game was a friendly at home against Cliftonville, on 14 February 1880, in which the visitors recorded a 3–0 victory. Lord Spencer Chichester was the inaugural president of the Irish Football Association, which was formed in November 1880. On 9 April 1881, Moyola Park became the first winners of the Irish Cup, defeating Cliftonville 1–0 in the final.

After those prestigious early days the club became less prominent and did not become a senior club, playing as a junior club outside the Irish League. In the early years of the twentieth century, the club played in the South Derry District League and it continued to do so until the Second World War, with the exception of the 1929–30 season during which the club participated in the Belfast-based Minor League. After the war, Moyola Park was a founding member of the Ballymena and District Junior League in 1948–49, where it played until season 1977–78 (with the exception of 1950–51, when it participated in the Irish Football Alliance). During this time, the club won the league championship outright on five occasions: 1948–49, 1949–50, 1973–74, 1976–77, 1977–78, and shared the championship in 1959–60 with Ballymoney United. The club also won the Irish Junior Cup in 1972–73 and 1973–74 and was also runner-up the following year. During the 1970s the club was managed by a local ex footballer Billy Lennox with another local ex footballer Johnston Mawhinney Jnr. as his assistant when the aforementioned 3 league titles and 2 Irish Junior Cups were achieved representing notable success in that period of the club&#x27;s history.

In 1978, the club was elevated to intermediate status upon joining the newly established Northern Ireland Intermediate League. In 1991, Moyola Park gained admission to the Irish League B Division. A successful spell under manager Kenny Shiels saw the club win the Smirnoff Cup (1999–2000) and the Craig Memorial Cup (2000–01), and finished as runners-up in the (renamed) Second Division (2000–01) and Irish Intermediate Cup. The club&#x27;s greatest modern success followed in 2001–02 when, under new manager Eric Halliday, Moyola Park won the Second Division title (as well as retaining the Craig Memorial Cup.

Until the 2008–09 season, its home was the eponymous Moyola Park, but at the start of 2009–10 it used Coagh United&#x27;s Hagan Park while its then current ground was under construction. The first match at the new ground was on 16 January 2010 against Lurgan Celtic.
