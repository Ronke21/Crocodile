<text>Valentine Green (3 October 173929 July 1813) was a British mezzotinter and print publisher. Green trained under Robert Hancock, a Worcester engraver, after which he moved to London and began working as a mezzotint engraver. He began to exhibit with the Incorporated Society of Artists from 1766, became a fellow a year later and a director in 1771. He was appointed mezzotint engraver to the King in 1773, and the following year was elected an associate engraver with the Royal Academy. Throughout the 1770s and 1780s, Green&#x27;s engraving practice flourished. In the 1790s, however, several of his international speculations failed and in 1798 he was declared bankrupt. In 1805, he accepted the role of keeper of the British Institution, a post he held until his death.

==Biography==
Born in Salford Priors, he was placed by his father in a solicitor&#x27;s office at Evesham, where he remained for two years; but ultimately he decided, on his own responsibility, to abandon the legal profession and became a pupil of a line engraver at Worcester. In 1765, he migrated to London and began work as a mezzotint engraver, having taught himself the technicalities of this art, and quickly rose to a position in absolutely the front rank of British engravers. On first coming to London he published in collaboration with the Aquatint engraver Francis Jukes.

== Career ==

He became a member of the Incorporated Society of Artists in 1767, an associate-engraver of the Royal Academy in 1775, and for some forty years he followed his profession with the greatest success. The exclusive right of engraving and publishing plates from the pictures in the Düsseldorf gallery was granted him by the duke of Bavaria in 1789, but, after he had issued more than twenty of these plates, the siege of that city by the French put an end to this undertaking and caused him serious financial loss.

From this cause, and through the failure of certain other speculations, he was reduced to poverty; and in consequence he took the post of keeper of the British Institution in 1805, and continued in this office for the remainder of his life. During his career as an engraver he produced some four hundred plates after portraits by Reynolds, Romney, and other British artists, after the compositions of Benjamin West, and after pictures by Van Dyck, Rubens, Murillo, and other old masters.

It is claimed for him that he was one of the first engravers to show how admirably mezzotint could be applied to the translation of pictorial compositions as well as portraits, but at the present time it is to his portraits that most attention is given by collectors. His engravings are distinguished by exceptional richness and subtlety of tone, and by very judicious management of relations of light and shade; and they have, almost without exception, notable freshness and grace of handling.

==The Antiquarian==

A keen Antiquarian, he was a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, in London. He published at least three works. The first was a &quot;Survey of the City of Worcester&quot;, published in 1764, compiled during his residence there. Printed by J. Butler for S.Gamidge, at Prior&#x27;s Head, Worcester. This formed the groundwork for his second book &quot;the History and antiquities of the City and Suburbs of Worcester&quot;, published as two volumes on 3 April 1796. Printed for the author by W.Bulmer and Co. and sold by G.Nicol of London. His third work was &quot;An Account of the Discovery of the Body of King John: In the Cathedral Church of Worcester&quot;, published by V. and R. Green, Percy Street, Bedford Square, London on 17 July 1797. 

== Legacy ==
James Walker (c.1748–c.1808) was one of Green&#x27;s pupils.

<text>Dave Meegan is an Irish record producer, born in Dublin in 1963. Meegan is best known for his work with Marillion.

Meegan&#x27;s association with Marillion began when he worked as an assistant engineer on their second album, &quot;Fugazi&quot; in 1984. He got a job as a tape operator and trained under Trevor Horn in Sarm Studios. Meegan worked for U2 as an engineer during the sessions for &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; and &quot;Rattle and Hum,&quot; and has also worked alongside Peter Collins, Shep Pettibone and Stephen Hague, as an engineer. 

In 1989 Meegan produced most of the tracks on the album The House of Love, and in 1991 he produced &quot;Slinky&quot;, by the Milltown Brothers, and in 1992, &quot;2 Hell with Common Sense&quot;, by Power of Dreams.

Meegan returned to Marillion, and produced their albums &quot;Brave&quot;, a concept album released in 1994, and &quot;Afraid of Sunlight&quot;, which were their final two albums released on EMI in the 1990s. Meegan also mixed their 1997 album &quot;This Strange Engine.&quot; He returned as a producer for their 2001 album &quot;Anoraknophobia&quot;, and their 2004 album,&quot; Marbles&quot;, containing the single &quot;You&#x27;re Gone&quot; which reached number 7 in the UK Singles Chart, the band&#x27;s highest-charting single since Steve Hogarth replaced original singer Fish in 1989. Marillion guitarist Steve Rothery has said he admired Meegan&#x27;s work so much he considered him to be &quot;a sixth member of the band&quot;.

Meegan stopped working as a producer for several years for personal reasons, but more recently, he has worked with Andrew Maxwell Morris.

<text>Eunice Groark (February 1, 1938 – May 8, 2018) was an American politician who was the first woman elected lieutenant governor of Connecticut in 1990. Groark ran on the ticket of A Connecticut Party (ACP) with Lowell Weicker, winning the election with 41% of the vote. After Weicker declined to run for a second term, Groark ran for governor on the A Connecticut Party ticket but lost the election to Republican candidate John G. Rowland.

== Early life and education ==
Groark was born in Sharon, Connecticut, and was raised in Hartford. She was descended from Hartford&#x27;s founder, Thomas Hooker, and her father, Henry Barnard Strong, was a state legislator. When Groark was six, she was trapped in the 1944 Hartford Circus Fire, which killed 168 people. Groark, who narrowly escaped with her life, said that even 60 years later, she still could not be in large crowds.

Groark earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Bryn Mawr College in 1960 and a J.D. from the University of Connecticut School of Law in 1965. After years of private practice, she served as executive director of the Connecticut Bar Foundation from 1977 to 1981 and then served as a Republican member of Hartford&#x27;s City Council from 1981 to 1985. Groark served as Corporation Counsel of the City of Hartford from 1987 to 1990.

== Political career ==
In 1990, former U.S. Senator Lowell Weicker recruited Groark to run as lieutenant governor on his third-party ticket. Groark agreed, switching parties to A Connecticut Party. Weicker and Groark went on to win the election.

In 1991, Governor Weicker introduced a controversial plan to balance the state budget by implementing an earned income tax. When the vote on the plan was tied 18–18 in the state Senate, Groark, as President of the Connecticut State Senate, cast the tie-breaking vote in favor. In 1993, she broke another Senate tie to pass a ban on semiautomatic assault weapons in Connecticut.

In 1994, Weicker retired from public office and endorsed Groark for governor on the ACP line. Groark selected Commissioner of Social Services Audrey Rowe as her running mate. Outspent by her rivals, Groark lost the 1994 Connecticut gubernatorial election, winning 19% of the vote in a four-way race. Former Republican congressman John G. Rowland won the election with 36% of the vote. Democratic State Comptroller Bill Curry came in second with 33%, while conservative talk-radio host and former state senator Tom Scott, who ran as an independent, came in fourth with 11%.

Because Groark failed to gain 20% of the vote to retain major party status for the ACP, its influence ended in Connecticut politics. Some Democrats, Curry among them, blamed Groark for siphoning votes from Curry and throwing the election to Rowland. Conversely, Jonathan Pelto, a former political director of the Connecticut Democratic Party, believed had Scott not been on the ballot, Rowland would have won in a landslide.

== Personal life ==
Groark died in Bloomfield, Connecticut, on May 8, 2018. She was survived by her husband, Thomas Groark, a prominent Hartford-based attorney to whom she had been married for 54 years. Other survivors included their three daughters: Eunice, Marie, and Virginia, and grandchildren: Harry, Louise, Owen, Phoebe, Virginia, Charlie, and Tommy.

<text>NGC 7027, also known as the Jewel Bug Nebula or the Magic Carpet Nebula, is a very young and dense planetary nebula located around from Earth in the constellation Cygnus. Discovered in 1878 by Édouard Stephan using the reflector at Marseille Observatory, it is one of the smallest planetary nebulae and by far the most extensively studied.

==Observation==
NGC 7027 is one of the visually brightest planetary nebulae. In a telescope with a 6&quot; aperture at a magnification of around 50× it appears as a relatively bright bluish star. It is best viewed with the highest magnification possible.

In 1977 at Yerkes Observatory, a small Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope was used to derive an accurate optical position for the planetary nebula NGC 7027 to allow comparison between photographs and radio maps of the object.

It has been photographed multiple times by the Hubble Space Telescope since its launch in 1990. Prior to these observations, NGC 7027 was thought to be a protoplanetary nebula with the central star too cool to ionize any of the gas, but it is now known to be a planetary nebula in the earliest stage of its development.

==Overview==
NGC 7027 is unusually small, measuring only 0.2 by 0.1 light-years, whereas the typical size for a planetary nebula is 1 light-year. It is fairly young, at about 600 years old. It has a very complex shape, consisting of an elliptical region of ionized gas and an equatorial belt within a massive neutral cloud. The inner structure is surrounded by a translucent shroud of gas and dust. The nebula is shaped like a prolate ellipsoidal shell and contains a photodissociation region shaped like a &quot;clover leaf&quot;. The inner shell is also punctured by several shocks and X-ray jets, leading to the &quot;spike&quot;-like structures. NGC 7027 is expanding at . The central regions of NGC 7027 have been found to emit X-rays, indicating very high temperatures. Surrounding the ellipsoidal nebula are a series of faint, blue concentric shells. 

The expanding halo of NGC 7027 has a mass of about three times the mass of the Sun, and is about 100 times more massive than the ionized central region. This mass loss in NGC 7027 provided important evidence that stars a few times more massive than the Sun can avoid being destroyed in supernova explosions.

The nebula is rich in carbon, and is a very interesting object for the study of carbon chemistry in dense molecular material exposed to strong ultraviolet radiation. The spectrum of NGC 7027 contains fewer spectral lines from neutral molecules than is usual for planetary nebulae. This is due to the destruction of neutral molecules by intense UV radiation. The nebula contains ions of extremely high ionization potential. The helium hydride ion, thought to be the earliest molecule to have been formed in the Universe (about 100,000 years after the Big Bang), was detected in 2019 for the first time in space in NGC 7027. There is also evidence for the presence of nanodiamond in NGC 7027.

=== Central star===
NGC 7027 has a rich and highly ionized spectrum caused by its hot central star. The progenitor star of NGC 7027 is believed to have been about 3 to 4 times the mass of the Sun before the nebula was formed. It is possible that the central white dwarf of NGC 7027 has an accretion disk that acts as a source of high temperatures. The white dwarf is believed to have a mass approximately 0.7 times the mass of the Sun and is radiating at 7,700 times the Sun&#x27;s luminosity. NGC 7027 is currently in a short phase of planetary nebula evolution in which molecules in its envelope are being dissociated into their component atoms, and the atoms are being ionized.

The central star is suspected to be a binary system with the secondary being undetected. Although the details of NGC 7027&#x27;s formation are unclear, it is hypothesized that interactions with the secondary star produced the complex structure of the planetary nebula, including the jets and resulting spikes.

<text>Hugh Reginald Haweis (3 April 1838 – 29 January 1901) was an English cleric and writer. He was the husband of author Mary Eliza Haweis and the father of painter Stephen Haweis.

==Biography==
H.R. Haweis was born in Egham, Surrey in 1838, the son of the Rev. John Oliver Willyams Haweis of Brighton, Canon of Chichester. He was educated privately in Sussex and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1860. He travelled in Italy and served under Garibaldi in 1860. On his return to England he was ordained and held various curacies in London, becoming in 1866 incumbent of St James&#x27;s, Marylebone.
His unconventional methods of conducting the service, combined with his dwarfish figure and lively manner, soon attracted crowded congregations. He married Mary E. Joy in 1866, and both he and Mrs Haweis (d. 1898) contributed largely to periodical literature and travelled a good deal abroad. Haweis was Lowell lecturer in Boston, in 1885, and represented the Anglican Church at the Chicago Parliament of Religions in 1893.

He was much interested in music, and wrote books on violins and church bells, besides contributing an article to the 9th edition of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; on &quot;bell&quot;. His best-known book was &quot;Music and Morals&quot; (1871), which went through sixteen editions before the end of the century, and he was for a time from 1868 editor of &quot;Cassell&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. He also wrote the five-volume &quot;Christ and Christianity&quot;, a popular church history (1886–1887), as well as &quot;Travel and Talk&quot; (1896) and similar chatty and entertaining books. His book &quot;My Musical Life&quot; offers a biographical tour through his career and his spiritual leanings in music, tracing his awakening to music, his interest in the Cremonese violin makers and in Paganini, an exposition of &quot;The Ring of the Nibelungen&quot;, &quot;Parsifal&quot;, &quot;Lohengrin&quot; and &quot;Tannhäuser&quot;, and anecdotes of his meetings with Richard Wagner and Franz Liszt.

<text>The One was a video game magazine in the United Kingdom which covered 16-bit home gaming during the late 1980s and early 1990s. It was first published by EMAP in October 1988 and initially covered computer games aimed at the Atari ST, Amiga, and IBM PC compatible markets.

Like many similar magazines, it contained sections of news, game reviews, previews, tips, help guides, columnist writings, readers&#x27; letters, and cover-mounted disks of game demos.

The magazine was sometimes criticised for including &quot;filler&quot; content such as articles on Arnold Schwarzenegger with the justification that an upcoming film had a computer game tie-in.

Readers also initially had trouble buying the magazine due to the name; &quot;The One&quot; lead to confusion among newsagents over exactly which magazine they meant.

==History==
In 1988 the 16-bit computer scene was beginning to emerge. With Commodore&#x27;s Amiga and Atari&#x27;s ST starting to gain more and more coverage in the multi format titles, EMAP decided it was time for a dedicated magazine aimed at the user of these 16-bit computers. &quot;The One for 16-Bit Games&quot; was launched and covered the Atari ST, Amiga, and PC games market. Produced by editor Gary Penn and a small team of contributors, the magazine went on to gain a circulation figures of over 40,000 readers.

The industry voted &quot;The One for 16-Bit Games&quot; &quot;Magazine of the Year&quot; in February 1990.

In June 1990, the magazine was extensively redesigned. Some regular features were dropped, the layout was changed, and the logo changed slightly to more emphasize &quot;ONE&quot;. The magazine was subtitled &quot;For Amiga, Atari ST and PC Games&quot;.

=== Splits and reorganisation ===

The ST and Amiga had reached a larger market by 1991 and there were several single format magazines catering to these users. Because of this EMAP, along with recently appointed editor Ciarán Brennan, made the decision to split the magazine into &quot;The One for Amiga Games&quot; starting May 1991 and &quot;The One for ST Games&quot;. PC games coverage was transferred to the recently launched &quot;PC Leisure&quot;.

Because many features fell into the general computing category, content remained similar between the two magazines. Because both magazines were produced by the same production team, the magazines resembled one another. However a few months later both titles would move in their own directions, catering for platform specific games.
In 1992 EMAP was reorganizing their games magazines. &quot;Mean Machines&quot; was split into two, &quot;The One for ST Games&quot; was incorporated into Europress&#x27;s &quot;ST Action&quot;, and &quot;ACE&quot; magazine closed. &quot;ACE&quot; magazine closing meant that there was a well-respected team available. To give &quot;The One&quot; a new direction and look, the original staff were moved on (speculation suggests they were moved to assist with the launch of &quot;ST Review&quot; magazine) and the &quot;ACE&quot; writers took their place. The change of &quot;The One&quot; was evident with magazines&#x27; relaunch. The new editor Jim Douglas and his team produced the new magazine from May 1992, with its shortened logo &quot;THE ONE&quot;, with the subtitle &quot;Incorporating all the best of ACE&quot;. As the subtitle suggested, the magazine layout and content was essentially &quot;The One&quot; with some of the content of &quot;ACE&quot;, together producing an entirely new magazine.

Just months after the redesign, most of the staff moved on and David Upchurch took over editorship. Again, the magazine put the word &quot;Amiga&quot; in its title starting October 1992. Now called &quot;The One Amiga&quot;, this would allow potential readers to recognise the magazine as an Amiga title. The staples were also replaced in favour of a spine bound magazine. 
There were many significant changes to the Amiga market in 1993. More coverage was given to games that were A1200 specific and there was the launch of the 32-bit Amiga CD32. All formats were accommodated within the magazine by way of the details box which indicated what specification the game was designed for.

In March 1994, David Upchurch announced his departure in that issue. Deputy Editor, Simon Byron, stepped up to replace him. Just eight issues later and the cycle repeated itself, Simon Byron left, and Deputy Editor, Andy Nuttall replaced him. Despite the new editorship and optimism the magazine page count decreased to 84 - partially as a result of Commodore going into liquidation, making the Amiga market uncertain of what would happen next.

In July 1995 it was announced that EMAP was closing the magazine down. &quot;The One&quot; content was incorporated into EMAP&#x27;s other Amiga title, &quot;CU Amiga&quot;, beginning in the August 1995 edition of the latter.

This was not the end of the original &quot;The One&quot; magazine however, as Maverick Magazines bought the title and launched their first edition in August 1995. This version, dubbed &quot;The One Amiga: Maverick Edition&quot;, had a different content. It looked like &quot;The One&quot; but it lacked the former writing style and spirit of the EMAP team. Beginning in early 1996, the magazine quickly decreased to a pamphlet style magazine of just 16 pages - mostly dedicated to the full game included on the coverdisk - before ending with the final issue of August 1996. Unlike previously, this time around no mention was made of the fact that the magazine was ceasing publication.

<doc id="1337449" wikidata="Q6377737" url="?curid=1337449" title="Kato Kaelin">
<text>Brian Gerard &quot;Kato&quot; Kaelin (born March 9, 1959) is an American actor and radio and television personality. A friend of Nicole Brown Simpson, Kaelin is best known for serving as a witness in the O. J. Simpson murder trial in 1995, receiving considerable media attention during the trial.

==Early life and education==
Brian Gerard Kaelin was born on March 9, 1959, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Kaelin was nicknamed &quot;Kato&quot; as a child after the Japanese character played by Bruce Lee on the television series &quot;The Green Hornet&quot;. He graduated from Nicolet High School in Glendale, Wisconsin, in 1977. He attended, but never graduated from the University of Wisconsin–Eau Claire. He pledged the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity in the fall of 1980 and was accepted at the end of the term at California State University, Fullerton. During his time at Eau Claire he created his own talk show, &quot;Kato and Friends&quot;, and hosted &quot;The Gameshow&quot; on the campus television station, TV10. He eventually moved to Hollywood.

== Friendship with Nicole Brown Simpson ==
Kaelin met and became friends with Nicole Brown Simpson, the ex-wife of former NFL player and actor O. J. Simpson, on a skiing trip in Aspen, Colorado, in December 1992. He later moved into the guest house on Brown&#x27;s property on Gretna Green Way and lived there for a year. He paid rent and helped take care of Sydney and Justin as part of the living arrangement. Kaelin ate takeout food from McDonald&#x27;s with Simpson on June 12, 1994, the night Brown and her friend Ronald Goldman were stabbed to death outside Brown&#x27;s condominium.

== O. J. Simpson murder trial ==

Kaelin was a minor witness for the prosecution in the 1995 O. J. Simpson murder trial. In 1994, he was staying in a guest house on Simpson&#x27;s Rockingham estate and was present at the compound on the night of the two murders on June 12. He witnessed some of Simpson&#x27;s movements before and after the time of the murders. His story seemed to contradict Simpson&#x27;s version of the events on some key points, as he testified that he could not account for Simpson&#x27;s whereabouts between 9:36 p.m. and 11:00 p.m. on the evening the murders took place, which the prosecution alleged occurred between 10:00 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. In spite of &quot;valuable evidence&quot; provided by Kaelin in his testimony, prosecutor Marcia Clark took the unusual step of having him declared a hostile witness, &quot;allowing her to attack her own prosecution witness without repeated objections from Simpson&#x27;s defense team.&quot; He received considerable media attention during the trial; one survey found that 74 percent of Americans could identify him.

===Landmark libel case===
After Simpson was acquitted, the cover of an issue of the tabloid newspaper &quot;National Examiner&quot; featured a photo of Kaelin without his shirt on, with the headline &quot;Cops think Kato did it!&quot; The article within the issue alleged that police suspected Kaelin of perjury. Kaelin sued the publisher, Globe Communications, for libel, alleging that the cover headline implied he was suspected of the murders. The federal District Court for Central California dismissed the case, saying the story was not libelous or malicious. This was reversed by the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which ruled:

The decision was a landmark case in libel law, finding that a headline could be considered libel. Kaelin later settled the US$15 million lawsuit with Globe Communications out of court.

==Career==

Before his involvement in the O. J. Simpson trial, Kaelin appeared in the beach comedy movie &quot;Beach Fever&quot; (1987), in which his character created a love potion with his friend and hit on girls at the beach; he also starred in &quot;Night Shadow&quot; (1989), a low budget horror movie.

Kaelin briefly made national headlines when he said he never told the &quot;New York Post&quot; columnist Cindy Adams that Simpson definitely killed his former wife, Nicole Brown Simpson. He said he has expressed his opinion before, that he thinks Simpson did it, but &quot;I have no firsthand knowledge.&quot;

Soon after the trial, Kaelin appeared on the first episode of the Fox sketch comedy &quot;MADtv&quot; (October 1995) and made a cameo appearance on the HBO sketch comedy &quot;Mr. Show with Bob and David&quot; during the series&#x27; first season (November 1995); in the latter series&#x27; episode titled &quot;We Regret to Inform You&quot;, he shows up at lobotomized actor Borden Grote&#x27;s party. He appeared in the feature film &quot;The Still Life&quot; (2006) and had a minor role in &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Dorm Daze 2&quot; (2006). In February 2009, Kaelin guest-starred in the web series &quot;Star-ving&quot; and the movie &quot;Whacked&quot;. He was a guest on &quot;Politically Incorrect with Bill Maher&quot;, on March 29, 1995.

In 1995, from the popularity of the Howard Stern Show, the Los Angeles radio station 97.1 KLSX which had played Classic Rock after Stern in the morning, switched to an All Talk format, and Kato Kaelin, along with standup comic Bobby Hellman, hosted an afternoon show (following Susan Olsen and Ken Ober). Kato wound up hosting without Bobby, and the gig lasted about a year.

Kaelin has made numerous forays into reality television. In 2002, he participated in the series &quot;Celebrity Boot Camp&quot;. In 2004, he participated in the development of a reality show called &quot;House Guest&quot;, in which he would live in other celebrities&#x27; homes; that show never aired. He was seen on an episode of the E! reality series &quot;Sunset Tan&quot;, asking specifically for a &quot;farmer&#x27;s tan&quot;. He was also a guest player on the sixth episode of the Comedy Central series &quot;Reality Bites Back&quot;. In 2008, he was a contestant in the Fox Reality Channel show &quot;Gimme My Reality Show&quot;, in which minor celebrities competed to receive their own reality show.

Kaelin has also participated in game shows. He appeared on the NBC version of &quot;The Weakest Link&quot; (2002). He was a contestant on the game shows &quot;Russian Roulette&quot; as well as the reality dating show &quot;BZZZ!&quot; hosted by Annie Wood. In 2005, he appeared in the first three &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Strip Poker&quot; pay-per-view programs (Kaelin is an avid poker player); the titles were filmed at Hedonism II, a naturist resort in Negril, Jamaica, which led him to quip, &quot;The first few days there were the hardest!&quot; The Playboy bunnies, WWE Divas, and pin-up models competing in the no-limit Texas hold &#x27;em games, and upon losing all their chips and clothes, had to dive into the &quot;Pool of Shame&quot; and visit &quot;Kato&#x27;s Guesthouse&quot;, where he would interview the nude defeated players. He also appeared in numerous comedic skits.

Kaelin also has worked as a radio and television host. For a short time in 1995, he worked as a radio talk host on KLSX in Los Angeles, and provided online content for &quot;National Lampoon&quot;. From June 2005 to some time in 2006, Kaelin co-hosted &quot;Eye for an Eye&quot;, a daytime TV court show syndicated in 34 countries. Kaelin was a recurring guest on the video game review show &quot;X-Play&quot;.

Kaelin has also appeared in several parodies. In 2009, he was seen on the series &quot;Tosh.0&quot;, in a parody of the Keyboard Cat video titled &quot;Keyboard Kato&quot;. And in 2010, Kaelin appeared on &quot;Real Time with Bill Maher&quot;, wearing a wig to play his younger self in a taped skit parodying 1990s television appearances by 2010 US senatorial candidate Christine O&#x27;Donnell.

Since 2011, Kaelin has hosted the TV talk show &quot;Tailgating with Kato&quot;.

<text>The Long Black Veil is an album by the traditional Irish folk band The Chieftains. Released in 1995, it is one of the most popular and best-selling albums by the band. It reached number 17 in the album charts. The band teamed up with well-known musicians such as Mick Jagger of the Rolling Stones and Van Morrison. The album went gold in the U.S. and Australia, and Double-Platinum in Ireland. One of the tracks, &quot;Have I Told You Lately That I Love You?&quot;, sung and written by Van Morrison, won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals in 1996.

Credited collaborators include Marianne Faithfull, Mark Knopfler, Mick Jagger, Ry Cooder, Sinéad O&#x27;Connor, Sting, The Rolling Stones, Tom Jones, Van Morrison and Arty McGlynn.

The Tennessee Waltz/Mazurka was recorded at Frank Zappa&#x27;s studio not long before he died. There is video evidence (available as a bootleg called &#x27;Salad Party&#x27;) that additional material was recorded during this session, though The Chieftains have not released this material.

<text>Gerhard Zucker (1908–1985) was a German businessman and rocket engineer.

==Biography==

Born in Hasselfelde, he first came to public notice in 1931, when he began to work on the problem of transporting mail by rocket. In 1933 he performed several experiments in the Harz and at Cuxhaven. In 1934, he emigrated to the UK, where he attempted to interest the British government in his rocket.

After a failed rocket demonstration for officials of the British Royal Mail on 31 July 1934, he was deported to Germany, where he was arrested on suspicion of cooperating with the British. During World War II he served in the Luftwaffe.

After World War II, he moved across the border to West Germany, to the part of the Harz in Lower Saxony, where he became a furniture dealer. He continued his rocket experiments until, at a rocket demonstration on 7 May 1964 on the Hasselkopf Mountain near Braunlage, an accident occurred which killed three people. This accident led to a ban on civilian rocket research in West Germany, ending the rocket experiments of the Hermann-Oberth-Gesellschaft (Hermann Oberth Society) and the Berthold Seliger Forschungs- und Entwicklungsgesellschaft mbH (Berhold Seliger Research and Development Society).

In the 1970s Gerhard Zucker once again began launching mail rockets.

==Zucker in popular culture==

A film based on Zucker&#x27;s attempts with mail rockets at Scarp was released in 2004, called The Rocket Post, starring Ulrich Thomsen as Zucker.

In October 2011, Canadian Wilfred Ashley McIsaac resurrected the Zucker legacy in eastern Ontario, Canada after launching a scale solid fuel ARCAS rocket with Gerhard Zucker &#x27;First Canadian Rocket-Flight&#x27; stamps on board. Zucker himself produced the postal stamps for a May 1936 exhibit in New York City. The stamps were never used until McIsaac launched them 75 years later on41 October 2011.

<doc id="1337468" wikidata="Q726136" url="?curid=1337468" title="Robert Graham (sculptor)">
<text>Robert Graham (August 19, 1938 – December 27, 2008) was a Mexican-born American sculptor based in the state of California in the United States. His monumental bronzes commemorate the human figure, and are featured in public places across America.

==Early life and education==
Graham was born in Mexico City, Mexico on August 19, 1938, to Roberto Pena and Adelina Graham. Roberto Pena died when his son was six years old, and the boy, his mother Adelina, his grandmother Ana, and his aunt Mercedes left Mexico and moved to San Jose, California.

Robert Graham received his formal art training at San José State University and the San Francisco Art Institute. He continued his studies at the San Francisco Art Institute in California, finishing in 1964.

==Career==
By the late 1960s, Graham had one-man exhibitions of his sculpture at important contemporary art galleries in Palo Alto, Los Angeles, New York City, London, Cologne, and Essen, Germany. He, along with family members Joey and Steven, lived in London for a period before settling in Los Angeles in the early 1970s. His first solo exhibition in a museum was at the Dallas Museum of Art in 1972. Since then he has had dozens of one-man shows, including several at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.

Graham used a range of materials and scales in his work. In the 1970s he created very small wax sculptures (circa ) in miniature dioramas, depicting people interacting in various contemporary environments, such as a living room or a beach scene. Some of these interactions included sexual congress. Graham&#x27;s 1986 monument to the boxer Joe Louis is a bronze fist and forearm. He has created hundreds of nude figures and groupings in intermediate scales.

Graham&#x27;s first major monumental commission was the ceremonial gateway for the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, for the occasion of the 1984 Olympics. He also designed the commemorative silver dollar for the event. The gateway featured two bronze torsos, male and female, modeled on contestants in the games. The gateway was a major design element of an Olympiad noted for its lack of new construction. To the surprise of many, the nudity of the torsos became an issue in the media.

After 1984, Graham received many other commissions for monumental works, such as &quot;The Great Bronze Doors&quot; of the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels in Los Angeles (2002).

==Personal life==
Graham married his first wife Joey Graham in 1959. They have one son, Steven, born in 1963.

He married actress Anjelica Huston in 1992, and they resided in an unusual dwelling in Venice, Los Angeles. Huston refused to move to the bohemian area, where he&#x27;d been living for years, unless Graham designed a custom home that balanced security with beauty. The result was a remarkable home behind a long, solid cement wall to separate them from the well-traveled sidewalks: it was nicknamed the fortress.

Graham made a cameo appearance in Huston&#x27;s movie, &quot;The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou&quot;, as the Venezuelan general near the beginning of the film standing on the deck of the ship. Wes Anderson mentions in the movie&#x27;s commentary that Graham has some aspects in common with Steve Zissou.

He was interviewed in &quot;Visiting... with Huell Howser&quot; Episode 411.

==Honors==
In 1983, Graham was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member, and became a full Academician in 1994.

California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and First Lady Maria Shriver announced on May 28, 2008, that Graham would be inducted into the California Hall of Fame, located at The California Museum for History, Women and the Arts. The induction ceremony took place on December 15, 2008, but he was too ill to attend. His son Steven accepted the award on his behalf as he was inducted alongside 11 other legendary Californians.

==Death==
After an illness of about six months, Graham died on December 27, 2008, at Santa Monica – UCLA Medical Center, in Los Angeles. His funeral was held at Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels, which has bronze doors that Graham created for the cathedral. His remains are interred at Woodlawn Cemetery, Mortuary &amp; Mausoleum.

<text>Thurland Chattaway (April 8, 1872 – November 12, 1947) was an American composer of popular music, active from approximately 1898 to 1912. He is best known for writing the words to the popular 1907 hit &quot;Red Wing&quot; with Kerry Mills.

<doc id="1337475" wikidata="Q1986472" url="?curid=1337475" title="The Dismemberment Plan">
<text>The Dismemberment Plan is a Washington, D.C.–based indie rock band formed on January 1, 1993. Also known as D-Plan or the Plan, the name was derived from an industry phrase used by insurance salesman Ned Ryerson in the 1993 comedy film &quot;Groundhog Day&quot;. The band members include Eric Axelson (bass), Jason Caddell (guitar), Joe Easley (drums), and Travis Morrison (vocals and guitar). Axelson, Caddell, Morrison and original drummer Steve Cummings formed the band in college, knowing each other from attending northern Virginia high schools (Axelson, Cummings, and Morrison attended Lake Braddock Secondary School in Burke, Virginia). Cummings left the band after the recording of their debut album &quot;!&quot; and was replaced by Easley, cementing the band&#x27;s lineup.

The Dismemberment Plan released four albums before breaking up in 2003, the best known being 1999&#x27;s critically acclaimed &quot;Emergency &amp; I&quot;. They reunited three times after their initial disbandment for additional tour dates, and to produce their fifth studio album &quot;Uncanney Valley&quot; in 2013.

==Band history==
===1993–2003: Original years===
Aside from a brief interlude in 1998 and 1999 when they were signed by Interscope Records, the band recorded for the Washington, D.C., independent label DeSoto Records. Their breakthrough album, &quot;Emergency &amp; I&quot;, was actually created during their time at Interscope. However, they were dropped from the label shortly after its completion, and thus took it back with them to DeSoto, where it wound up being released. The EP &quot;The Ice of Boston&quot; is the only item of theirs Interscope actually released during their tenure there. The band managed to avoid being in debt to the label, effectively being able to record on a major label budget with no consequence. The band referred to their situation in a later interview as &quot;slipping through the cracks&quot;.Following the massive underground success of &quot;Emergency &amp; I&quot;, the band received an even higher profile after being invited to open for the European leg of Pearl Jam&#x27;s 2000 tour. A co-headlining tour in 2002 with Death Cab for Cutie (called the &quot;Death and Dismemberment Tour&quot;) also worked well to raise both bands&#x27; profiles and cross-pollinate their fanbases, as well as forge creative ties between several members. Later that summer and fall the Dismemberment Plan started to debut songs for their follow-up to 2001&#x27;s &quot;Change&quot;. In 2002 the band put all the music tracks from their last two albums on their website, encouraging fans to remix the songs. The result was 2003&#x27;s &quot;A People&#x27;s History of the Dismemberment Plan&quot;. On January 19, 2003, however, the band announced on their website that they had decided to break up after a few tours that year. A final show was planned for July 28, 2003, in Washington D.C.&#x27;s famous outdoor show space, Fort Reno Park. However come show-time a heavy rain threatened to damage their electronic equipment and drove off all but the most devoted fans, leading the band to add one more final show. On September 1, 2003, they closed out their career with a sold-out show at the renowned 9:30 Club, dubbed the &quot;one last slice&quot; show. By the band&#x27;s breakup, &quot;Emergency &amp; I&quot; and &quot;Change&quot; had sold 22,000 copies each in the US.

===2003–2010: Post-breakup activity===
Morrison took the post-&quot;Change&quot; songs with him for further work, and released many of them on his first album, &quot;Travistan&quot;, released in 2004. Eric Axelson started a band called Maritime with former members of The Promise Ring. They released three albums: &quot;Glass Floor&quot; in 2004, &quot;We, the Vehicles&quot; in 2006, and &quot;Heresy and the Hotel Choir&quot; in 2007.

On March 1, 2007, the band announced they would be playing a one-off reunion show on Saturday, April 28, 2007 at Washington D.C.&#x27;s venerable Black Cat nightclub. The event was a charity concert benefiting Callum Robbins, son of J. Robbins, frontman for DeSoto Records labelmate Jawbox. Fan reaction to the decision was overwhelmingly positive, and tickets to the concert sold out within minutes of being offered online. In response to the high demand for tickets, a second show was announced for April 27. Travis Morrison has stated that the band probably won&#x27;t be getting back together, &quot;except to drink beer&quot;.

===2010–2015: First reunion and &quot;Uncanney Valley&quot;===
On September 13, 2010, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; Click Track reported that the band would reunite for a tour, in support of Barsuk Records&#x27; reissue of 1999&#x27;s &quot;Emergency &amp; I&quot;. &quot;We&#x27;re not planning a new record,&quot; bassist Eric Axelson told Click Track. &quot;But we&#x27;re doing these shows and taking it day to day after that.&quot; The 2011 tour kicked off with a performance on &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot;, followed by three Washington, D.C. shows (two at the 9:30 Club, one at the Black Cat) January 21–23. The band would play 10 more shows in 2011, including high-profile appearances at the Pitchfork Music Festival in Chicago and the annual &quot;Roots Picnic&quot; in Philadelphia.

In August 2012, wanting to play &quot;a couple of small, sweaty summer shows like we used to do&quot;, the Dismemberment Plan played small-venue shows in Baltimore and Fredericksburg, Va where they debuted eight new songs. As of August 13, 2012, according to Travis Morrison, &quot;We have a bunch more [new songs] coming so we&#x27;re going back to the lab to work on brand new ones and tweak these. No plans for recording as of yet, although certainly those conversations are happening now.&quot; Shortly thereafter, the band announced that they would be playing the Virgin FreeFest in October, along with two more accompanying shows.

On July 16, 2013, the band shared &quot;Waiting&quot;, the lead single from their forthcoming fifth album &quot;Uncanney Valley&quot;, which could initially be heard by calling the promotional phone number 252-64-DPLAN. Two more singles, &quot;Invisible&quot; and &quot;Daddy Was a Real Good Dancer&quot;, were released on August 19 and September 11 respectively.

On October 15, 2013, the band released their fifth studio album &quot;Uncanney Valley&quot; on Partisan Records.

In November 2013, the band played the final holiday camp edition of the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties festival in Camber Sands, England. Following a New Year&#x27;s Eve concert in 2014 at the Brighton Music Hall in Boston, Massachusetts, the group went on hiatus, and no announcement was made by the band on its status.

===Since 2023: Second reunion===
On January 31, 2024, without prior announcement, The Dismemberment Plan contributed a cover of the Circus Lupus song &quot;Unrequited&quot; for &quot;Yesterday &amp; Today: DC Does Dischord&quot;, a tribute album to Dischord Records. The song was reportedly recorded in August 2023. Later that year, the band announced they would play six reunion shows starting in September, their first live performances in almost a decade, to celebrate the 25th anniversary of &quot;Emergency &amp; I&quot;, concluding with performances at the Best Friends Forever festival in Las Vegas, and the United Sounds NYC festival in New York City.

==Musical style and influences==

<text>Billy Talent is a Canadian rock band from Mississauga, Ontario. They formed in 1993 with lead vocalist Benjamin Kowalewicz, guitarist Ian D&#x27;Sa, bassist Jonathan Gallant, and drummer Aaron Solowoniuk. There have been no lineup changes, although Solowoniuk has been on hiatus from the band since 2016 due to a relapse of multiple sclerosis. In the three decades since their inception, Billy Talent has sold well over a million physical albums in Canada alone and nearly 3 million albums internationally. During their most successful period, they were ranked as one of the top 10 best-selling native bands in Canada.

The band existed for almost a decade before mainstream success. The members met and played in Our Lady of Mount Carmel Secondary School under the name Pezz and remained underground in Toronto&#x27;s indie music scene until 2001. The band renamed itself Billy Talent after running into legal trouble with the old name. It was then that Kowalewicz&#x27;s connection with an employee of Warner Music Canada&#x27;s A&amp;R department landed the band a record deal and launched them into mainstream success. Since then, Billy Talent has made three multi-platinum records in Canada and continues to expand their success overseas; this included touring for 20 months supporting their second album. They released their third album, &quot;Billy Talent III&quot;, in 2009, and their fourth album, &quot;Dead Silence&quot;, in 2012. &quot;Dead Silence&quot; was followed up by a full UK tour throughout October and November 2012. To commemorate the longevity since the release of their first studio album, the band has released a greatest hits album entitled &quot;Hits&quot; in 2014. In 2015, they began to prepare material for their fifth studio album. Just before entering the studio, drummer Aaron Solowoniuk decided to sit out the recording sessions while he continued his longstanding battle with multiple sclerosis. Fellow Canadian Jordan Hastings was quickly recruited to play as Solowoniuk&#x27;s studio stand-in, and, in early 2016, the group completed work on &quot;Afraid of Heights&quot;, which was released in July of that year. The band&#x27;s most recent album is &quot;Crisis of Faith&quot;, released in January 2022.

== History ==

=== Origins as Pezz (1993–1999)===


The band got together during a high school talent contest. Pezz began writing, performing songs, and gaining attention and credibility at first locally, and soon in Toronto&#x27;s broader indie music scene. Their first recording was a cheap 4-track demo. It was recorded in Ian D&#x27;Sa&#x27;s basement in July 1994 and was named &quot;Demoluca&quot;, after a friend of the band named Jason Deluca had stopped by the house, banging on a basement window while the band was recording. Soon after, in January 1995, they all put in money to record another demo of better quality with engineer/producer Dave Tedesco at the &quot;Signal to Noise&quot; studio which they called &quot;Dudebox&quot;. Originally, two tracks from &quot;Demoluca&quot; and four newly recorded tracks were compiled onto it, but a year later the band recorded four more tunes live in the studio and re-released it. After these releases and their continued performances in the immediate area, Pezz was gaining a following in Mississauga and it continued to spread.

D&#x27;Sa studied classical animation at Sheridan College, and even worked on Angela Anaconda as an animator. Gallant almost finished a business degree. Kowalewicz was in between jobs, one which included working at 102.1 the edge. Solowoniuk worked at Chrysler Canada. But during this, each member found the time and finances to max-out their credit cards, and record their first full-length album in 1999. They laid down twelve tracks at a studio called &quot;Great Big Music&quot;, collaborating with Juno-nominated music producer Brad Nelson. Kowalewicz started singing in melody with D&#x27;Sa. The music began to transform from &quot;raw rap-rock&quot; songs into &quot;catchy and angst-ridden pop-punk anthems&quot;. With that, &quot;Watoosh!&quot; was born and independently released. While popular within Toronto&#x27;s indie scene, it did not reach large mainstream sales levels.

=== &quot;Billy Talent&quot; and success (1999–2004) ===
In 1999, the Canadian Pezz received documentation from an American band named Pezz proving that the latter had held the name internationally since 1989. The Canadian band had no legal claim to their old name and thus changed it to Billy Talent, inspired by the guitarist &quot;Billy Tallent&quot; from Michael Turner&#x27;s novel &quot;Hard Core Logo&quot;. The film adaptation by Bruce McDonald would be the inspirational medium for the band. This, however, still led to fans mistaking Kowalewicz as being named Billy Talent.

Now known as Billy Talent, their sound began to move in a more aggressive, punk rock direction. During this time, Kowalewicz ran into Jen Hirst, at 102.1 the edge, the Toronto radio station he worked at. She had seen the band perform as Pezz, and he asked her to check out the band&#x27;s performance at a club. This would prove to pay off, as Hirst was later hired by Warner Music Canada to work in A&amp;R. This connection would get the band their producer Gavin Brown, and a demo deal with the label. Before the demos were recorded, a local manager called Atlantic Records A&amp;R executives, who were already in Toronto, to see the band perform in its tiny rehearsal space.

In 2002, the band met with record executives, and ended up signing a co-venture agreement with Atlantic Records and Warner Music Canada. In the fall of 2003, the band released their full-length self-titled album, &quot;Billy Talent&quot;. The album found considerable sales success. &quot;Try Honesty&quot; was a successful first single, and was followed by other singles &quot;The Ex&quot;, &quot;River Below&quot;, and &quot;Nothing to Lose&quot; into late 2003 and 2004. The band played sold-out shows in Canada and the United States and had success in Europe. The band received a Juno, (They won two Junos, Best Album of the Year, and Best Band of the Year) and MuchMusic Video Award nominations and awards, and spent late 2004 and most of 2005 touring. &quot;Billy Talent&quot; went on to be certified 3× platinum in Canada.

A track from the album titled &quot;This Is How It Goes&quot; was about Aaron Solowoniuk&#x27;s fight with multiple sclerosis. On March 17, 2006, Aaron Solowoniuk revealed in a personal letter to fans that he was the friend in that song. Solowoniuk was confirmed to have the disease, which causes anything from numbness in the limbs to paralysis or loss of vision, in January 1999. His neurologist prescribed him medication that he would have to self inject three times a week, possibly for the rest of his life. Although it was a struggle for Solowoniuk to come to terms with the reality of the disease, going to numerous doctor appointments and touring with a mini-fridge in their van has become a normal routine.

=== &quot;Billy Talent II&quot; (2005–2007) ===
Billy Talent&#x27;s second album was mostly recorded at The Warehouse Studio in Vancouver, British Columbia, which was produced by Gavin Brown again with Ian D&#x27;Sa co-producing for the first time, and mixed by Chris Lord-Alge.

&quot;Billy Talent II&quot; hit the shelves on June 27, 2006. It fared very well in Canada in its debut week, landing in at number 1 on the Canadian charts. It also enjoyed significant success in Germany, where it also debuted at number 1 in the album charts in its debut week, and was one of the top 10 selling albums in the country. As of June 15, 2007, the album has sold almost 700,000 units worldwide, 215,000 of them in Canada making it certified 2× Platinum, and 200,000 shipped units in Germany achieved it platinum status there. Since then, the record has gone on to be certified 4× platinum in Canada and 2× platinum in Germany, putting the album over 1 million units sold worldwide. However, the success did not duplicate itself in the U.S. The band has expressed that they know they are a new band there, and they are choosing to concentrate their attention on Canada, Europe, and other places overseas instead.

The album contains less anger and profanity than their previous self-titled album. More of the songs dealt with real-life issues, to the praise of fans and critics.

The band ventured off on another UK tour in support of &quot;Billy Talent II&quot;, but this one would include more shows in countries they had not performed in before. During this tour leg, the gigs at London and Manchester, on September 8 and 16, respectively, were recorded live. Limited edition CDs were released as the band&#x27;s only live album to date, &quot;Live from the UK Sept./2006&quot;. Also during the tour, the band had to miss their Southampton show &quot;due to a death in the family&quot;. The whole band returned the following month to play the show.

The band started their first Canadian arena tour with the bands Rise Against, Anti-Flag, and Moneen, performing in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Quebec and ending in Ontario. Following the Canadian tour, the band ventured onto their first US club tour.

The band went on a large overseas tour, beginning on June 1, 2007. They temporarily came back in mid June to play shows at the MuchMusic Video Awards, the Molson Amphitheatre in Toronto with good friends Alexisonfire, Cancer Bats, and Attack in Black. Plus the Quebec City Summer Festival with Alexisonfire in Quebec City. They returned overseas, selling out multiple venues in Australia and performing at the MTV Australia Video Music Awards. They had planned to end their tour on September 3, but the band played shows in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland, Saint John, New Brunswick and Halifax, Nova Scotia on September 5, 7 and 8, respectively. As of September 11, 2007, the band has indicated that their 18-month tour has officially ended, and they are &quot;home for a while to catch [their] breath a little before [they] start writing the next record.&quot; In the meantime, a live DVD album called &quot;666&quot; was released on November 27, 2007, featuring footage and audio from the band&#x27;s performances at London&#x27;s Brixton Academy, Düsseldorf&#x27;s Philipshalle, and Germany&#x27;s Rock am Ring festival (at the Nürburgring).

In 2008 they opened for American group My Chemical Romance in the US with a smaller group Drive By and attended several festivals and held concerts in Canada and Europe later on. Vocalist Benjamin Kowalewicz stated on July 1, on Billy Talent&#x27;s official forum, that they are staying put in Canada until the album is finished, and that their promotional tour for &quot;II&quot; has come to an end.
Their song &quot;Red Flag&quot; was featured in &quot;Burnout Revenge&quot;, &quot;Burnout Legends&quot;, &quot;SSX on Tour&quot;, and &quot;NHL 06&quot;.

=== &quot;Billy Talent III&quot; (2008–2011) ===
The single for &quot;Turn Your Back&quot; (a collaboration with the band Anti-Flag) was released on September 15 in the UK and most of Europe, on September 16 in the U.S. and Canada and September 20 in Australia and was also featured in the video game &quot;NHL 09&quot;.

The band entered the studio in November with Brendan O&#x27;Brien, who has previously worked with Rage Against the Machine, Incubus, Stone Temple Pilots, Soundgarden, Pearl Jam and the Red Hot Chili Peppers.
The band embarked on a supporting tour for the fourth album, starting in Australia in the Soundwave Festival in February. Also, they played two sideways, one in Sydney and one in Melbourne, with Emery and Face to Face opening for them. After Australia, the band headed to North America, where they played the three-day Coachella Festival. Ian revealed that the new album is to be called &quot;Billy Talent III&quot;.

During summer 2009, Billy Talent toured North America with Rise Against and Rancid. On February 26, the band was announced for Download festival in the U.K. They also played in Columbus, Ohio at Rock on the Range in May 2009. During the Melbourne Soundwave show, Kowalewicz announced they would tour Australia again in August. Billy Talent also played at Reading and Leeds Festivals 2009. Following the twin festivals, the band toured the U.K. in late October/early November before moving on to tour the U.S. in support of their new album. In an interview with UpVenue, bassist Jonathan Gallant announced that the Canadian tour would begin in winter 2010 but would be an extensive one.

Their third album, &quot;Billy Talent III&quot; was released on July 10, 2009, in Europe, July 13 in the United Kingdom, and July 14 in Canada. The album was released on September 22 in the United States on the Roadrunner Records label.
Billy Talent kicked off their 2009 European tour on October 19, commenting before the tour that they &quot;can&#x27;t wait to come over to Europe and the U.K.&quot;. They followed the European tour with a Canadian tour in March 2010, with Against Me!, Alexisonfire and Cancer Bats supporting. On February 1, &quot;Saint Veronika&quot; was released as the third single from &quot;Billy Talent III&quot;.

On February 16, 2010, Billy Talent released &quot;iTunes Session&quot;, over iTunes, a 7-track EP with songs from all three of the Billy Talent albums.

In August 2010, Billy Talent played three tour dates in South Africa, one in Cape Town, Durban and at Oppikoppi along with other local bands such as Taxi Violence, Zebra and Giraffe and Jack Parow. The band then played the main stage at the Reading and Leeds Festivals in the summer, along with bands such as Blink-182, Guns N&#x27; Roses, Arcade Fire, Paramore, Weezer, Green Day, Lostprophets &amp; Young Guns. This was the band&#x27;s last performances on the Billy Talent III Tour, and it was announced by Kowalewicz that the band was going to take a break before beginning work on their next album.

=== &quot;Dead Silence&quot; (2012–2014)===
In April 2011, Kowalewicz stated that &quot;At this point there is no time frame for touring, as our main priority is finishing writing and recording this new record&quot;. Kowalewicz also stated &quot;the songs this far is unlike anything we&#x27;ve ever done before yet it still seems to capture the urgency of our first record&quot;. Kowalewicz stated, in an interview, that the first three albums would form a trilogy and that the new album would not be named &quot;Billy Talent IV&quot;.
In August 2011 it was announced in an interview with the band that their new album will be recorded in November. The album was produced by Ian D&#x27;Sa and engineered by Eric Ratz and Kenny Luong who worked on Billy Talent II. The album&#x27;s first single &quot;Viking Death March&quot; was digitally released on May 25, 2012. The music video for the track was recorded at Germany&#x27;s Rock am Ring Festival and at Melkweg Amsterdam.
The album&#x27;s second single &quot;Surprise Surprise&quot; was released on August 7, 2012, on iTunes.
The band released the album &quot;Dead Silence&quot; on September 4, 2012, on their SoundCloud account.

The band embarked on a Canadian tour with Sum 41, Hollerado, Indian Handcrafts, and Monster Truck (replaced Sum 41 when they dropped out of the tour for the last show in Halifax for medical reasons).

On August 22, 2014, the band announced &quot;Hits&quot;, a compilation album of their most successful singles to date, plus two new songs. On September 25, 2014, Billy Talent released one of the two new songs as a single, titled &quot;Kingdom of Zod&quot;. The single did not receive a lot of promotion upon release but did peak at #5 in Canada the following January, making the single a sleeper hit. On November 4, 2014, &quot;Hits&quot; was released. The same day, the other new song, &quot;Chasing The Sun,&quot; was released as a radio single, but did not chart until May 2015.

=== &quot;Afraid of Heights&quot; (2015–2018)===
On May 9, 2015, the band announced at SiriusXM Indies that they have been in the studio for the past few months, writing and demoing an upcoming album. They also announced that the album will be released in 2016. On November 26, 2015, Kowalewicz announced that they will be entering the studio to start recording January 4, 2016, and should release their new album before summer 2016. On January 15, 2016, Aaron announced via the Billy Talent YouTube channel that he would be taking a hiatus from the band due to an MS relapse. Jordan Hastings from Alexisonfire, Cunter, and Say Yes was announced to be filling in and doing the drum work on the new album in his place. Official band photographs in promotion of the new album feature both drummers.

On May 12, 2016, the band announced their album &quot;Afraid of Heights&quot; which was released on July 29, 2016. On the same day, the band aired their first single from the new album, &quot;Afraid of Heights&quot;. On June 3, 2016, the band released a second single from the album, titled &quot;Louder Than The DJ.&quot; On July 16, 2016, the band opened for Guns N&#x27; Roses at the Rogers Centre. The following week, the band released the third and final single from &quot;Afraid of Heights&quot;, titled &quot;Ghost Ship Of Cannibal Rats.&quot; Solowoniuk joined the group at their February 27, 2017, show at Toronto&#x27;s Air Canada Centre to perform &quot;Pins And Needles&quot; and &quot;Surrender&quot;. The band was also joined by Jeremy Widerman from Monster Truck to perform a cover of The Tragically Hip song &quot;Nautical Disaster&quot; in dedication to Gord Downie.

=== &quot;Crisis of Faith&quot; (2019–present) ===
On November 26, 2019, the band released &quot;Forgiveness I + II&quot;, which would later be revealed as the opening track on their upcoming record. The song was a stylistic change for the band, showcasing elements of progressive rock, along with the use of synthesizers and a saxophone solo. This was also the band&#x27;s longest released song to date, clocking in at just under seven minutes. Later, on January 24, 2020, the band released their first radio single since 2016, called &quot;Reckless Paradise&quot;. This single was more typical of band&#x27;s signature post-hardcore sound. The single hit #1 in Canada on February 22, 2020. On April 3, 2020, the band released another new single called &quot;I Beg to Differ (This Will Get Better)&quot;. Not originally intended to be a single, the band released it as a hopeful, yet bittersweet response to the delay and cancellation of many scheduled tour dates due to the pandemic. The band also posted a list of crisis hotlines for fans in need of moral support, using this song as a motif. The song peaked at #1 in Canada on October 3, 2020.

Almost a year later, after being mostly inactive on social media, the band released the single &quot;End of Me&quot;, featuring Weezer vocalist Rivers Cuomo on September 10, 2021, and subsequently announced that their sixth studio album, titled &quot;Crisis of Faith&quot;, would be released on January 21, 2022. In support of the album, the band announced that they will be touring Canada with PUP and Rise Against in February and April 2022. On November 13, 2021, &quot;End of Me&quot; reached number one on the Canadian Rock chart, making every promotional single for &quot;Crisis of Faith&quot; a number-one hit. This made for the band&#x27;s most successful rollout of singles in their career.

The band was joined by Anti-Flag &amp; NOBRO for the first Canadian leg of their &quot;Crisis of Faith&quot; tour. This leg was played entirely with a substitute drummer, as Hastings returned to Alexisonfire in the wake of their reunion.

== Musical style ==
Billy Talent&#x27;s musical style has been described as punk rock, alternative rock, post-hardcore, pop-punk, hard rock, and emo. &quot;Watoosh!&quot; saw the band mixing multiple genres and making diverse songs on the same album, stretching from hip hop to indie and ska punk. However, this evolved into a more collected sound that was a mix of fewer genres on their second album, &quot;Billy Talent&quot;. The result of this has not been described by the band as their defining sound and that it was something that appeared to them after experimenting with different styles. On &quot;Billy Talent II&quot;, the band altered their sound yet again, based on more mid-tempo and emotional compositions; a bit more collected than their previous work. It was also based on far less angst and aggression behind the production, things that were known factors behind their debut. The band also experimented with elements of post-punk and uses of pianos, loops, and half-stepped guitar tunings on &quot;Billy Talent III&quot; and &quot;Dead Silence&quot;. The uses of synth-basses and drum loops made their appearance in &quot;Afraid of Heights&quot; on the songs &quot;Horses &amp; Chariots&quot; and &quot;Afraid of Heights (Reprise)&quot;, almost emulating a space rock influence to that of Muse. In their music there are raw and frequent backup vocals heavily collaborated by main vocals, quick dynamic changes between loud and quiet, and Kowalewicz&#x27;s characteristic vocals which are the key elements that emphasize that assertion.

<text>In geometry, a space diagonal (also interior diagonal or body diagonal) of a polyhedron is a line connecting two vertices that are not on the same face. Space diagonals contrast with &quot;face diagonals&quot;, which connect vertices on the same face (but not on the same edge) as each other.

For example, a pyramid has no space diagonals, while a cube (shown at right) or more generally a parallelepiped has four space diagonals.

== Axial diagonal==
An axial diagonal is a space diagonal that passes through the center of a polyhedron.

For example, in a cube with edge length &quot;a&quot;, all four space diagonals are axial diagonals, of common length formula_1 More generally, a cuboid with edge lengths &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, and &quot;c&quot; has all four space diagonals axial, with common length formula_2

A regular octahedron has 3 axial diagonals, of length formula_3, with edge length &quot;a&quot;. 

A regular icosahedron has 6 axial diagonals of length formula_4, where formula_5 is the golden ratio formula_6.

== Space diagonals of magic cubes==

A magic square is an arrangement of numbers in a square grid so that the sum of the numbers along every row, column, and diagonal is the same. Similarly, one may define a magic cube to be an arrangement of numbers in a cubical grid so that the sum of the numbers on the four space diagonals must be the same as the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each pillar.

<doc id="1337511" wikidata="Q5125352" url="?curid=1337511" title="Claire Weekes">
<text>Doctor Hazel Claire Weekes MBE (11 April 1903 – 2 June 1990) was an Australian general practitioner and health writer; she also had an early career as a research scientist working in the field of comparative reproduction. Doctor Weekes is considered by many as the pioneer of modern anxiety treatment and has written several books on dealing with anxiety disorders. Many of today&#x27;s self-help books on anxiety continue to cite her work.

Weekes found that many of her patients suffered from various anxiety disorders, such as agoraphobia, panic attacks, phobias, generalised anxiety disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. In her books, she chose to avoid the term &quot;nervous breakdown&quot;, as much as possible, as she considered the term vague, unscientific and unnecessarily alarming. Weekes also avoided the term &quot;Anxiety State&quot; as she felt it was too &quot;medical&quot;, so she replaced both terms with &quot;Nervous Illness&quot; instead.

Weekes was concerned with the severe long-term effects anxiety and panic disorders had on the lives of her patients as well as the high failure of typical psychiatric treatments, especially psychoanalysis, which many sufferers had tried. Instead, Weekes developed her own unique treatment program. She noted that patients did not suffer from anxiety problems because they had flawed personalities or traumatic childhoods; rather, the problems were caused by the patient having a habit of fear-avoidance, made worse, or caused, by a very responsive &quot;sensitized&quot; nervous system. She was critical both of Freudian approaches and of attempts by behaviorists to &quot;desensitize&quot; their patients using relaxation and breathing techniques.

Weekes described in her books the three main pitfalls that lead to Nervous Illness. They are sensitization, bewilderment and fear. She explained that so much nervous illness is no more than severe sensitization kept alive by bewilderment and fear. Dr. Weekes analyzed fear as two separate fears; the first fear and the second fear. She explained that first fear is the fear that comes reflexively, almost automatically. The patient usually immediately recoils from it, and as he/she does, he/she adds a second fear to the first. Second fear is the fear the patient adds to the first fear. Examples of second fear are &quot;Oh, my goodness! Here it is again! I can&#x27;t stand it!&quot;. It is the second fear that is keeping the first fear alive, keeping the sufferer sensitized and keeping them nervously ill.

Weekes initially used the program on her own patients and then, as word spread of its success, it was issued on records and cassette tapes. Eventually, she developed a self-help pack consisting of a book and tape, with Weekes guiding patients through the program. She has summarized this program as follows; facing the feared situation, accepting the feeling of panic, floating through it, and letting time pass.

&quot;Self Help For Your Nerves&quot; (1962) (US title: &quot;Hope and Help for Your Nerves&quot;), Weekes&#x27; first book, has sold more than 300,000 copies and has been translated into fourteen languages. It was followed by &quot;Peace from Nervous Suffering&quot; (1972), &quot;Simple Effective Treatment of Agoraphobia&quot; (1976) and &quot;More Help for Your Nerves&quot; (1984). Her fifth and final book &quot;The Latest Help for Your Nerves&quot; (1989) was published one year before her death.

In 1983, Dr. Weekes was interviewed in a series of six talks, called &quot;Peace From Nervous Suffering,&quot; on the British national TV program &quot;Pebble Mill at One&quot;, in which she explained her techniques. A transcription of these talks along with two BBC radio interviews and two interviews at White Plains Hospital in New York, were published in her final book &quot;The Latest Help for Your Nerves.&quot;

In all five of her books, Weekes offers self-help methods and advice. Her work was marked by the personal nature of her approach. Early in her career she had earned both a Doctorate of Science as well as an M.D. Currently, her work is promoted by an organization in Australia set up by her heirs. 

Weekes described her own battle with nervous illness in her final book in which she explained how she began suffering from anxiety. At the age of 26, she was misdiagnosed with Tuberculosis which caused her to become anxious and introverted. Weekes&#x27; anxiety lasted for two years and gave her valuable insight into nervous illness. Dr. Robert L. Dupont describes in his book &quot;The Anxiety Cure&quot; (1998) that in 1983, he asked Weekes if she had ever had panic disorder. She replied &quot;Yes, I have had what you call panic attacks. In fact, I still have them. Sometimes they wake me at night.&quot; Dr. DuPont responded by saying he was sorry to hear that. He described Claire Weekes as looking at him in shock, and she responded &quot;Save your sympathy for someone else. I don&#x27;t need it or want it. What you call a panic attack is merely a few normal chemicals that are temporarily out of place in my brain. It is of no significance whatsoever to me!&quot;

Weekes&#x27; early work on the subject of reproduction and placentation in reptiles is held in high regard and is often cited by researchers in the field.

==Early career in biology==
Claire Weekes began her career as a research scientist, receiving her Doctorate of Science in 1930 from the University of Sydney; she was the first woman to attain that degree from the university. Initially working under Prof. Launcelot Harrison, she conducted research on reproduction and placentation in viviparous (live-bearing) lizards from 1925–1934; part of this period (1929–1931) was spent in England in the lab of J.P. Hill. Weekes&#x27; work led to eight published papers, including a major summary published in 1935 in the Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London. Weekes&#x27; work provided the basis an understanding of reptile placentation that lasted for nearly 50 years. More recent work has continued to build on the empirical and conceptual framework that she established. Weekes&#x27; research on the complex placentae of &quot;Pseudemoia entrecasteauxii&quot; was instrumental in the establishment of the species as a model organism for studying the evolution of pregnancy.

Claire Weekes&#x27; published papers in reproductive biology of reptiles: 
*Weekes, H.C. (1927a). Placentation and other phenomena in the scincid lizard &quot;Lygosoma (Hinulia) quoyi.&quot; Proc. Linn. Soc. N.S.W. 52:499–554.

<doc id="1337513" wikidata="Q1201803" url="?curid=1337513" title="The Adventure of the Reigate Squire">
<text>&quot;The Adventure of the Reigate Squire&quot;, also known as &quot;The Adventure of the Reigate Squires&quot; and &quot;The Adventure of the Reigate Puzzle&quot;, is one of the 56 Sherlock Holmes short stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. The story was first published in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in the United Kingdom and &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; in the United States in June 1893. It is one of 12 stories in the cycle collected as &quot;The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes&quot;.

Doyle ranked &quot;The Adventure of the Reigate Squire&quot; twelfth in his list of his twelve favorite Holmes stories.

==Plot==
Watson takes Holmes to a friend&#x27;s estate near Reigate in Surrey to rest after a rather strenuous case in France. Their host is Colonel Hayter. There has recently been a burglary at the nearby Acton estate in which the thieves stole a motley assortment of things, even a ball of twine, but nothing terribly valuable. Then one morning, the Colonel&#x27;s butler tells news of a murder at another nearby estate, the Cunninghams&#x27;. The victim is William Kirwan, the coachman. Inspector Forrester has taken charge of the investigation, and there is one physical clue: a torn piece of paper found in William&#x27;s hand with a few words written on it, including &quot;quarter to twelve&quot;, which was approximately the time of William&#x27;s murder. Holmes takes an instant interest in the note.

One of the first facts to emerge is that there is a longstanding legal dispute between the Actons and the Cunninghams involving ownership of about half of the estate currently in the Cunninghams&#x27; hands. Holmes interviews the two Cunningham men, young Alec and his ageing father. Alec tells Holmes that he saw the burglar struggling with William when a shot went off and William fell dead, and that the burglar ran off through a hedge to the road. The elder Cunningham claims that he was in his room smoking at the time, and Alec says that he had also still been up.

Holmes knows that it would be useful to get hold of the rest of that note found in William&#x27;s hand. He believes that the murderer snatched it away from William and thrust it into his pocket, never realizing that a scrap of it was still in the murdered coachman&#x27;s hand. Unfortunately, neither the police nor Holmes can get any information from William&#x27;s mother, for she is quite old, deaf, and somewhat simple-minded.

Holmes, apparently still recovering from his previous strenuous case, seems to have a fit just as Forrester is about to mention the torn piece of paper to the Cunninghams. Afterward, Holmes remarks that it is extraordinary that a burglar would break into the Cunninghams&#x27; house when the Cunninghams were both still awake and had lamps lit. Holmes then apparently makes a mistake writing an advertisement that the elder Cunningham corrects.

Holmes insists on searching the Cunninghams&#x27; rooms despite their protests that the burglar could not have gone there. He sees Alec&#x27;s room and then his father&#x27;s, where he deliberately knocks a small table over, sending some oranges and a water carafe to the floor. The others were not looking his way at the time, and Holmes implies that the cause is Watson&#x27;s clumsiness. Watson plays along and starts gathering up scattered oranges.

Everyone then notices that Holmes has left the room. Moments later, there are cries of &quot;murder&quot; and &quot;help&quot;. Watson recognizes his friend&#x27;s voice. He and Forrester rush to Alec&#x27;s room where they find Alec trying to throttle Holmes and his father apparently twisting Holmes&#x27;s wrist. The Cunninghams are quickly restrained, and Holmes tells Forrester to arrest the two for murdering William Kirwan. At first, Forrester thinks Holmes must be mad, but Holmes draws his attention to the looks on their faces – very guilty. After a revolver is knocked out of Alec&#x27;s hand, the two are arrested. The gun is the one that was used to murder William, and it is seized.

Holmes has found the rest of the note, still in Alec&#x27;s dressing gown pocket. It runs thus (the words in boldface are the ones on the original scrap):

:&quot;If you will only come round at quarter to twelve
: to the east gate you will learn what
: will very much surprise you and maybe 
: be of the greatest service to you and also
: to Annie Morrison. But say nothing to anyone
: upon the matter.&quot;

Holmes, an expert at studying handwriting, reveals that he had realized earlier from the torn piece of paper that the note was written by two men, each writing alternate words. He had perceived that one man was young, the other rather older, and that they were related, which led Holmes to conclude that the Cunninghams wrote the letter. Holmes saw that the Cunninghams&#x27; story was false since William&#x27;s body has no powder burns on it, so he was not shot at point-blank range as the Cunninghams claim. The escape route also does not bear their story out: there is a boggy ditch next to the road that the fleeing murderer would have had to cross, yet there are no signs of any footprints in it. Holmes had faked his fit to prevent the Cunninghams from being reminded about and destroying the missing part of the note, and made a mistake in the advertisement on purpose to get the elder Cunningham to write the word &quot;twelve&quot; by hand, to compare it with the note fragment.

The elder Cunningham&#x27;s confidence is broken after his arrest and he tells all. It seems that William followed his two employers the night they broke into the Acton estate (Holmes has already deduced that it was they, in pursuit of documents supporting Mr. Acton&#x27;s legal claim, which they did not find). William then proceeded to blackmail his employers – not realizing that it was dangerous to do such a thing to Alec – and they thought to use the recent burglary scare as a plausible way of getting rid of him. With a bit more attention paid to detail, they might very well have evaded all suspicion.

== Holmes and Watson ==
This is one of the rare stories that show a glimpse of Watson&#x27;s dedication and his life before he met Holmes, as well as Holmes&#x27; trust in Watson. Colonel Hayter is a former patient who Watson treated in Afghanistan and has offered his house to Watson and Holmes. Watson admits in convincing Holmes, &quot;A little diplomacy was needed,&quot; for Holmes resists anything that sounds like coddling or sentimentalism. Watson also glosses over the facts of Holmes&#x27; illness from overwork, implying redundancy because all of Europe was &quot;ringing with his name.&quot;

Holmes&#x27; health has collapsed after straining himself to the limit, and his success in the case means nothing to him in the face of his depression. With his superhuman physical and mental achievement, he has a correspondingly drastic fit of nervous prostration and needs Watson&#x27;s assistance. Holmes clearly has no problem with asking Watson for help when he needs it, for he sends a wire and Watson is at his side twenty-four hours later. At the onset of the mystery, Watson warns Holmes to rest, not to get started on a new problem. However, Watson knows and has revealed in other writings that inactivity is anathema to Holmes, and his caution comes off as weak. Holmes takes it all with humour, but the reader does not doubt his mind is eagerly upon the trail of the crime. At the conclusion, he tells Watson: &quot;I think our quiet rest in the country has been a distinct success, and I shall certainly return much invigorated, to Baker Street to-morrow.&quot;

<text>Mabel is an English female name derived from the Latin &quot;amabilis&quot;, &quot;lovable, dear&quot;.

==History==
Amabilis of Riom (died 475) was a French male saint who logically would have assumed the name Amabilis upon entering the priesthood: his veneration may have resulted in Amabilis being used as both a male and female name, or the name&#x27;s female usage may have been initiated by the female saint Amabilis of Rouen (died 634), the daughter of an Anglo-Saxon king who would have adopted the name Amabilis upon becoming a nun. 

Brought by the Normans—as Amable—to the British Isles, the name was there common as both Amabel and the abbreviated Mabel throughout the Middle Ages, with Mabel subsequently remaining common until , from which point its usage was largely restricted to Ireland, Mabel there being perceived as a variant of the Celtic name Maeve, until the name had a Victorian revival in Britain, facilitated by the 1853 publication of the novel &quot;The Heir of Redclyffe&quot; by Charlotte M. Yonge, which features an Irish character named Mabel Kilcoran; Yonge&#x27;s novel also features a character named Amabel, but her novel only significantly boosted the popularity of the name in the form Mabel, which became immensely popular in both the British Isles and the United States. 

At the start of the 20th century, Mabel&#x27;s popularity began a slow decline which accelerated from the 1930s; the name has seen very light usage since the 1960s. Due to its origin as an abridgement of Amabel it has been surmised that Mabel was originally pronounced with a short A, the name&#x27;s pronunciation with a long A dating only from its mid-19th-century revival.

<text>Zero was a video game magazine in the UK, published monthly by Dennis Publishing Ltd. between November 1989 and October 1992. (Actual publication dates were in the preceding month, as usual for UK magazines.) It won the InDin Magazine of the Year award in both 1990 and 1991, and was also briefly the best-selling multi-format 16-bit computer magazine in the UK.

==History==

The pre-launch editor and publisher was Teresa Maughan (also publisher of Your Sinclair) and initial editor was Gareth Herincx, who left during the compilation of issue 3, at which point Tim Ponting took over. Reviewers for the launch issue were: Jonathan Davies, Sean Kelly, Duncan MacDonald, David McCandless, Marcus &#x27;Binky&#x27; Berkmann, and Matt Bielby (all former writers for &quot;Your Sinclair&quot;). Other journalists of note who worked at &quot;Zero&quot; included David &#x27;Whistlin&#x27; Rick&#x27; Wilson, &#x27;Lord&#x27; Paul Lakin, Amaya Lopez, Jackie Sutton, Rich Pelley and Jane Goldman.

Issue 1 contained a coverdisk containing two free games for the Amiga and Atari ST. A regular coverdisk was later introduced which included full games and playable demos. &quot;Zero&quot; caused controversy when issue 31 included a playable demo of &quot;Cover Girl Poker&quot; on the cover disk. This resulted in the magazine being banned from the leading newsagents. By issue 33 the magazine was re-designed without the spine and had taken on a more youth orientated look. The magazine was cancelled three issues later, with issue 36 being the last one.

==Content==

Like many similar magazines, it contained sections of news, game reviews, previews, tips, help guides, columnists, reader&#x27;s letters, and cover-mounted disks of game demos. Some memorable features include &quot;highest joystick&quot; where readers would send in a picture of their gaming apparatus of choice at a high location, such as Ben Nevis or the cockpit of a jet (next to the altimeter), a feature where readers could send in a picture of themselves with a celebrity (One such picture had a topless Richard Branson with two young brothers), and &quot;Smack In The Marf&quot;, in which readers could send in (obviously faked) pictures of themselves with their injuries.

The magazine was notable for the considerable off-beat adolescent humour and wordplay used throughout the magazine — a continuation of the style first seen in &quot;Your Sinclair&quot;. &quot;Zero&quot; is the precursor to the humorous style of writing used in magazines such as &quot;PC Zone&quot;, and in fact many of the original writers who contributed to &quot;Zero&quot; went on to submit work for &quot;PC Zone&quot;.

<text>Who Do You Think You Are? is a British genealogy documentary series that has aired on the BBC since 2004, in which celebrity participants trace their family history. It is made by the production company Wall to Wall. The programme has regularly attracted an audience of more than 6 million viewers. More than ten international adaptations of the programme have been produced.

==Episodes==

The first two series were broadcast on BBC Two and the first was the channel&#x27;s highest-rating programme of 2004. This led to episodes being shown on BBC One from the third series onwards. The current narrator, as of Series 14 in 2017, is Phil Davis. Mark Strong took over from David Morrissey after the first series, which was nominated for &quot;Best Factual Series or Strand&quot; in the 2005 BAFTAs. Cherie Lunghi was the narrator between Series 10 and 13.

In the first series, the last ten minutes of each episode featured presenter Adrian Chiles and genealogical researcher Nick Barratt giving tips on tracing a family tree. In 2007, a special episode was broadcast in conjunction with the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Family Wanted&quot; campaign featuring Nicky Campbell, who was adopted when he was just a few days old.

The theme tune was composed by Mark Sayer-Wade, who also provided the background music for earlier episodes. The music in later episodes was provided by Julian Hamlin, Edmund Jolliffe, Mark Russell and Mike MacLennan. Theo Elwell is the current composer, as of Series 20 in 2023.

<text>&quot;The Adventure of the Crooked Man&quot;, one of the 56 Sherlock Holmes short stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is one of 12 stories in the cycle collected as &quot;The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. It was first published in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in the United Kingdom in July 1893, and in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; in the United States on 8 July 1893.

Doyle ranked &quot;The Adventure of the Crooked Man&quot; 15th in a list of his 19 favourite Sherlock Holmes stories.
==Plot==
Holmes calls upon Watson at his surgery late one night to request his assistance in an investigation. Holmes explains that, in Aldershot Camp, Colonel James Barclay of The Royal Mallows and his wife Nancy DeVoy Barclay were a seemingly happy couple; however, Barclay has died, and his wife is suspected of his murder. Major Murphy, Holmes&#x27; contact in the regiment, has explained that Barclay, while completely devoted to his wife, had a rather vindictive nature elsewhere. He had also been subject to random fits of depression, and disliked being left alone at night.

 The night of the supposed crime, Nancy Barclay had left for a church meeting in company with her friend, Miss Morrison. When she returned, she had been considerably agitated, and had asked her maid for tea. When the maid returned with the tea, she overheard the Barclays furiously arguing behind the locked morning room door. Nancy, the only one loud enough to be clearly audible, repeatedly said the words &quot;David&quot;, &quot;coward&quot;, and &quot;give me back my life&quot;. Moments later, screams rang out; when the Barclay&#x27;s coachman entered the room through the open french windows, he found Nancy collapsed and the Colonel dead, bleeding from a wound on his head. The key to the room was missing, and the door had to be opened by a locksmith. Nancy, temporarily insane from shock, was removed to a hospital, and Holmes was called in to investigate.

Holmes found signs that a silent third party had been present; the man had left his stick in the room, his footprints in the lawn, and presumably also had taken the key. Holmes also found the pawmarks of a short-legged, long-bodied animal on the floor, as well as signs the creature had attempted to eat the Barclay&#x27;s pet canary. Interrogating Miss Morrison, Holmes learned that, on the way home from the meeting, she and Nancy had encountered a deformed man with a wooden box on his back. Both he and Nancy seemed badly startled; he addressed her by name, and she addressed him as &quot;Henry&quot;. They spoke privately for a moment, then parted, both very upset. After swearing her friend to silence, Nancy had returned home. As the man&#x27;s appearance was distinctive, Holmes was soon able to discover his identity; Henry Wood, a conjurer who entertained the soldiers around Aldershot.

With Watson as a witness, Holmes visits Wood in his lodgings. Wood gladly tells his story to save Nancy from being accused of murder. Thirty years prior, he had been in India, and had been a soldier in the Royal Munsters with then-Sergeant Barclay. Both men loved Nancy DeVoy, but she was devoted to Wood, despite her father&#x27;s disapproval. The couple remained true to each other, nonetheless, but when the Indian Rebellion of 1857 erupted, the Royal Munsters found themselves cut off from supplies. Wood had volunteered to go for help, and Barclay gave him information on how to safely sneak through the enemy lines; however, Barclay, wishing to have Nancy to himself, secretly alerted the insurgents that Wood would be passing. Wood was captured, and learned from his captors of the betrayal. Over the years, he was repeatedly enslaved and tortured, resulting in his deformed back and legs. Finally escaping, he lived for many years in India as a conjurer, preferring Nancy and his fellow soldiers to think he had been killed in action instead of seeing his deformity. In his old age, wanting to see England and be around soldiers again, he saved enough money to travel to Aldershot, not realizing his own old regiment was currently stationed there. Unexpectedly running into Nancy, he had admitted her husband&#x27;s betrayal to her, then secretly followed her to her house. Seeing Barclay arguing with Nancy, Wood had entered the room through the french windows, to defend her; however, Barclay had instantly died of apoplexy at the mere sight of Wood alive, and struck his head on the fender as he fell. Nancy screamed and fainted; in the chaos, Wood&#x27;s pet mongoose Teddy escaped his wooden box, and ran up the curtain after the canary. Reflexively pocketing the door key, Wood recaptured Teddy and fled the scene, afraid he would be accused of murder.

Like Wood, Holmes is hesitant to rake up a 30-year-old military scandal; learning that the medical examiner has confirmed the Colonel died of apoplexy, Holmes keeps Wood&#x27;s story secret for the time being. Questioned by Watson about Nancy&#x27;s use of the name &quot;David&quot;, when no one involved in the case went by that name, Holmes decides that Nancy must have been comparing her husband to the Biblical King David, who arranged the murder of Uriah to steal Bathsheba from him.

==Commentary==
&quot;Elementary, my dear Watson&quot; is an often quoted line from Sherlock Holmes. However, Holmes never says this in any of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s stories. In &quot;The Adventure of the Crooked Man&quot;, though, he comes his closest to it:

:&quot;I have the advantage of knowing your habits, my dear Watson,&quot; said he.
:&quot;Excellent!&quot; I cried.
:&quot;Elementary,&quot; said he.

The Granada Television adaptation of &quot;The Crooked Man&quot; reverses the quote, having Watson deduce that Holmes had looked up a passage in the Bible since they returned home from Aldershot. When Holmes asks Watson how he knew, he points out Holmes&#x27; bookmark and replies &quot;Elementary, my dear Holmes&quot;.

The exact date of this story&#x27;s setting is unknown, but since Nancy had been married for &quot;upward of thirty years&quot; and the Indian Rebellion broke out in 1857, the date would need to be at or past 1887. The first few lines by Watson explain that this story occurred in the &quot;summer&quot; just after his marriage, which, according to &quot;The Sign of the Four&quot;, was sometime in 1889; this suggests the story is set in either 1889 or 1890. 

==Publication history==
&quot;The Adventure of the Crooked Man&quot; was published in the UK in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in July 1893, and in the US in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; on 8 July 1893. It was also published in the US edition of &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in August 1893. The story was published with seven illustrations by Sidney Paget in the &quot;Strand&quot;, and with two illustrations by W. H. Hyde in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot;. It was included in &quot;The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, which was published in December 1893 in the UK and February 1894 in the US.

==Adaptations==

===Film and television===
The story was adapted as a 1923 silent short film as part of the Stoll film series. It starred Eille Norwood as Holmes and Hubert Willis as Watson, and featured Gladys Jennings as Mrs Barclay and Dora De Winton as Miss Morrison.

The Granada TV version with Jeremy Brett is faithful to the original — except that it has the housekeeper, instead of the coachman, tell Holmes of the clue of the missing key. It also hints that the &quot;Mallows&quot; are a &quot;Lancers&quot; regiment and that Barclay owed most of his rapid rise in ranks from Sergeant to Officer due at least in part to his marriage to the daughter of the regimental sergeant major — rather than merit, as Murphy was already a young sub-officer at the time Barclay was a Sgt; at the time of the story Murphy is still only a major in &quot;temporary&quot; command of the regiment. It starred Norman Jones as Henry Wood, Lisa Daniely as Nancy Barclay, Denys Hawthorne as James Barclay, Fiona Shaw as Miss Morrison, Paul Chapman as Major Murphy, Shelagh Stephenson as Jane, Michael Lumsden as young Henry Wood, Catherine Rabett as young Nancy, and James Wilby as young Barclay.

The story was adapted as a 1999 episode of the animated television series &quot;Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century&quot; titled &quot;The Crooked Man&quot;.

Holmes describes this case to his addiction group in the episode &quot;A Giant Gun, Filled with Drugs&quot; (2013) in the CBS TV series &quot;Elementary&quot;.

===Radio===
Edith Meiser adapted the story as an episode of the American radio series &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; which aired on 1 December 1930, with Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson.

Edith Meiser also adapted the story as an episode of the later American radio series &quot;The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson, that was broadcast on 10 November 1940.

Michael Hardwick dramatised the story as a 1966 BBC Light Programme radio adaptation, as part of the 1952–1969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson.

&quot;The Crooked Man&quot; was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 1992 by Bert Coules as part of the 1989–1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson. It featured Brian Blessed as Henry Wood and Terence Edmond as Major Murphy. This adaptation contains a twist to the end of the denouement scene: after Holmes has left the room, Watson advises Wood to wait a while and then return to Nancy Barclay, that his disfigurement will not matter to her. Wood answers ambiguously, and the matter is left (as far as the audience is concerned) unresolved.

The story was adapted as an episode of &quot;The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, a series on the American radio show &quot;Imagination Theatre&quot;, starring John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson. The episode aired in 2015.

<doc id="1337546" wikidata="Q6982690" url="?curid=1337546" title="Navy Times">
<text>Navy Times (ISSN 0028-1697) is an American newspaper published 26 times per year serving active, reserve and retired United States Navy personnel and their families, providing news, information, analysis, community lifestyle features, educational supplements, and resource guides. &quot;Navy Times&quot; also reports on the United States Coast Guard. &quot;Navy Times&quot; is published by Sightline Media Group, a portfolio company of private equity firm Regent.

==History==
&quot;Navy Times&quot; was founded by Mel Ryder, owner of Army Times Publishing Company, in 1951.

Ryder began his newspaper career on the staff of &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot;, selling and delivering papers to the troops on the front lines during World War I. In 1921, he joined Willard Kiplinger in forming the Kiplinger Agency, a newsletter service. He sold his interest in the agency in 1933 and began publishing &quot;Happy Days&quot;, a paper for members of the Civilian Conservation Corps. His first order was for 400 copies and the first advertiser was GEICO. In 1940, Ryder started and incorporated the &quot;Army Times&quot; newspaper.

<doc id="1337548" wikidata="Q1192547" url="?curid=1337548" title="The Adventure of the Resident Patient">
<text>&quot;The Adventure of the Resident Patient&quot;, one of the 56 Sherlock Holmes short stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is one of 12 stories in the cycle collected as &quot;The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. The story was originally published in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in the United Kingdom and &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; in the United States in August 1893.

Doyle ranked &quot;The Adventure of the Resident Patient&quot; eighteenth in a list of his nineteen favourite Sherlock Holmes stories.

==Plot==
Holmes and Watson are consulted by Dr. Percy Trevelyan, a young general practitioner whose specialty is neurological disorders. Two years prior, having been a brilliant student but lacking the money to set up in practice, Trevelyan agreed to a strange business proposition put forward by a Mr. Blessington. Blessington bought a house in Brook Street, furnished it, paid servants, and purchased everything Dr. Trevelyan could need; all Trevelyan had to do was set up a consulting room. Each evening, Blessington would check the day&#x27;s accounts and take three-quarters of the doctor&#x27;s earnings, put it in his strong box, and leave the remainder for the doctor. Another unusual condition is having Blessington to live in the house as a permanent resident patient due to his heart trouble. The investment has made Blessington rich, and Trevelyan has become a well-known, respected doctor.

However, some months ago, Blessington panicked after claiming to have read a newspaper article about a nearby burglary; he insisted upon stronger locks and other stringent security measures, and also refused to leave the house for several weeks, only recently resuming his habit of taking his evening walk. Secondly, the evening before Trevelyan&#x27;s visit to Holmes, an elderly Russian nobleman and his son consulted the doctor, due to the father&#x27;s complaint of catalepsy. The son remained in the waiting room while the father spoke to the doctor – however, the old gentleman suffered a cataleptic attack while in the consulting room. Trevelyan spent several minutes looking for some amyl nitrite, but both father and son were gone when he returned with it. They visited again the next evening, apologizing for mistakenly believing the consultation was over the day before. Trevelyan again consulted the father while the son waited outside. After the pair left, Blessington returned from his walk, found footprints in his room, and entered into a state of panic again, insisting Trevelyan go and fetch Holmes to his aid.

Holmes and Watson return to Brook Street with the doctor, but Blessington refuses to admit to Holmes why he is obviously afraid for his life, or why there are men after him. He instead tries to pretend he is afraid they are unknown burglars, coming after the fortune he keeps in the chest at the foot of his bed (not trusting bankers). Holmes eventually leaves in disgust, advising Blessington that he cannot help him unless he tells the truth. However, Holmes has been able, by studying the footprints, to confirm the doctor&#x27;s story and eliminate him as a suspect. It was the nobleman&#x27;s son who twice entered the room, first while his father (most likely) pretended to have a cataleptic seizure the day before, then a second time while the doctor was kept busy consulting the father, leaving wet footprints since it was rather rainy outside that second day. However, Blessington had been out walking both times, inadvertently frustrating his enemies.

The next morning, Holmes and Watson return to Brook Street at a summons from Trevelyan. Blessington has been found dead, having apparently hanged himself during the night. Holmes and Inspector Lanner of Scotland Yard examine the scene; Holmes is able to find convincing evidence (different brands of cigars/ash, footprints, tools left behind) that three intruders were in the house that night. Two of them are the supposed &quot;Russian nobleman&quot; and his son; the third is unknown. Signs indicate the trio were admitted into the house by a confederate, most likely the newly hired page. They then held a sort of mock-judicial proceeding against Blessington, &quot;condemned&quot; him, hanged him, and retreated, the confederate barring the door behind them.

Taking a photograph of Blessington, Holmes leaves to consult Scotland Yard&#x27;s files, and returns with the news that he has identified Blessington as Sutton, one of the five members of the Worthingdon Bank Gang. The others were Cartwright, Biddle, Hayward, and Moffat. After the gang had committed a massive robbery in 1875, Sutton betrayed his four comrades to the police to escape arrest himself. Cartwright was hanged for murdering the bank&#x27;s caretaker, and the other three got lengthy prison terms of 15 years apiece. Sutton changed his name to Blessington and moved in with Dr. Trevelyan to hide from them; his first panic had been when he read of their unexpectedly early release from prison. As he feared, they eventually hunted him down and murdered him, to avenge Cartwright. Sutton had been unable to tell Holmes the truth of the matter without admitting his own identity, something he was too frightened and ashamed to do.

Lanner arrests the page and instigates a search, but Biddle, Hayward, and Moffat escape the country. The case against the page breaks down for lack of evidence, and the three murderers are suspected to have died in the wreck of the ship &quot;Nora Creina&quot; off the Portuguese coast.

==Publication history==
&quot;The Adventure of the Resident Patient&quot; was published in the UK in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in August 1893, and in the US in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; on 12 August 1893. It was also published in the US edition of &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in September 1893. The story was published with seven illustrations by Sidney Paget in the &quot;Strand&quot;, and with two illustrations by W. H. Hyde in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot;. It was included in &quot;The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, which was published in December 1893 in the UK and February 1894 in the US.

In many editions, the story starts with the Holmes &quot;mind-reading&quot; scene from &quot;The Adventure of the Cardboard Box&quot;, which was added to this story after Doyle decided the latter story should not be included in &quot;The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes&quot;.

<doc id="1337549" wikidata="Q712997" url="?curid=1337549" title="George Burley">
<text>George Elder Burley (born 3 June 1956) is a Scottish former football player and manager. He had a professional career spanning 21 years as a player, making 628 league appearances and earning 11 Scotland caps. His most successful spell came while at Ipswich Town making 394 senior appearances, and being part of the squad that won the FA Cup and UEFA Cup in 1978 and 1981 respectively.

Burley&#x27;s managerial career began in 1990 with Ayr United and has since spent spells at seven different clubs, including an eight-year spell back at Ipswich Town as manager, which included a promotion to the Premier League and guiding the club to a fifth place league finish at that level. On 24 January 2008 he was appointed manager of the Scotland national team. He was sacked on 16 November 2009, following a 3–0 defeat to Wales.

==Playing career==

Burley was born in Cumnock, East Ayrshire. He joined Ipswich Town in 1972 as an apprentice and won the FA Youth Cup in 1973. He made his senior debut against Manchester United at Old Trafford in 1973, being given the job of marking George Best. In 1978, he was a member of the Ipswich side which upset the odds to defeat Arsenal 1–0 in the FA Cup final. However, in 1981 injury forced him out of Ipswich&#x27;s UEFA Cup final triumph over AZ Alkmaar. Town missed out on the First Division title on the last day of the season, finishing runners-up to Aston Villa.

In 1985, he joined Sunderland after making 500 appearances for Ipswich, and was part of the Sunderland team that slipped into the Third Division in 1987, only to win promotion a year later.

He played for Gillingham in the 1988–89 season, but was unable to prevent them from being relegated to the Fourth Division. He moved back to Scotland in 1989 to play for Motherwell.

Burley received eleven Scotland caps.

==Management career==

===Ayr United===
Burley joined Ayr United as a player-manager in 1991, succeeding Ally MacLeod. In his first season, he took United to the B&amp;Q Centenary Cup Final and again reached the final of the competition (by then renamed the B&amp;Q Challenge Cup) the following season. However, he did not succeed in taking Ayr back to the Premier League and was dismissed in 1993 for adverse results with the side&#x27;s place in the First Division in serious jeopardy.

===Motherwell===
Burley moved briefly to Falkirk in 1993 as a player before returning to Motherwell as player-coach.

===Colchester United===
In June 1994 Burley returned to East Anglia as player-manager of Colchester United. He played seven first team games and managed the club for 20 matches, 8 of which they won, before returning to Ipswich Town in December.

===Ipswich Town===
Burley was appointed manager at his former club, with Dale Roberts as his assistant, having had talks with Town without Colchester knowing and so compensation was duly paid. He made his playing return for Ipswich, ten years after his last game for the club in a match against Motherwell in 1995 although didn&#x27;t feature again as a player.

During an eight-year reign he took Ipswich to three play-offs semi finals before finally winning promotion to the Premier League on the fourth attempt via the play-offs at Wembley beating Barnsley 4–2.

The following season, he guided the club to fifth place and qualification for the UEFA Cup. This earned him the 2000–01 Premier League Manager of the Season award. Relegation the following season saw Burley&#x27;s side struggling at the foot of Football League First Division and his contract was terminated by mutual agreement in 2002.

Burley again applied for the job in 2012, losing out to Mick McCarthy. He was later critical of how the club was being run, in 2017, following the club&#x27;s lowest finishing in nearly 60 years, stating that:The tradition of this club, with what Alf Ramsey, Bobby Robson and even myself achieved shouldn&#x27;t be forgotten. Right now, Ipswich should be contesting for the top six in the Championship every year at the very least – that&#x27;s where I think they should be. I was at the club for 21 years as a player and manager and the standard never dropped below that. That&#x27;s the level Ipswich Town should be endeavouring to be at again. That&#x27;s where they should expect to be. It&#x27;s that type of club.When I took over in 1994 the first thing I said was I wanted to take the club back into Europe and we did that.

Burley again showed interest in the Ipswich job following Mick McCarthy&#x27;s exit in 2018, but he again lost out in favour of Paul Hurst.

In November 2002, Burley was on the verge of taking over as Stoke City manager, but he had a late change of heart and declined the offer.

===Derby County===
In 2003, Burley became interim manager of Derby County while permanent manager John Gregory was suspended. Burley managed to halt Derby&#x27;s alarming slide towards the relegation zone of the First Division (just one season after relegation from the Premier League) and kept the club up comfortably. Burley was then appointed manager permanently when Gregory was sacked. The following season (2003–04) was often a struggle, with Derby actually finishing two places lower than the season before, but there were signs of improvement. This showed through in the 2004–05 season when, despite spending no money on new players, Burley transformed Derby from relegation contenders to a fourth-place finish and play-off semi-finalists. However, things were not as happy as they seemed on the surface with Burley&#x27;s relationship with director of football Murdo Mackay and the club&#x27;s board (who sold star player Tom Huddlestone without informing Burley) being very strained. After days of speculation and mudslinging, Burley announced his resignation from Derby in June 2005.

===Heart of Midlothian===
Burley was appointed manager of Heart of Midlothian on 30 June 2005. A stunning start to his tenure as Hearts manager saw them top the Scottish Premier League after the first ten games, winning eight of these, including a 4–0 victory over rivals Hibernian – proving themselves to be genuine title challengers. However, he left the club the day after major shareholder Vladimir Romanov, with whom Burley had a notoriously uneasy relationship, announced a bid to take private control of Hearts. A club statement declared his departure was by mutual consent because of irreconcilable differences.

===Southampton===
Burley was appointed as Head Coach of Southampton on 23 December 2005 following the departure of Harry Redknapp. The club&#x27;s technical director, Sir Clive Woodward, was moved sideways to a newly created post as director of football as part of restructuring following Burley&#x27;s appointment, before eventually leaving the club in August 2006. Following the change in control of the club in July 2006, Burley&#x27;s title was changed to that of &quot;manager&quot;. He guided Southampton to the 2006–07 play-offs but lost on penalties in the second-leg of the semi-final after drawing 4–4 on aggregate against his former club Derby County, who went on to win the final.

===Scotland===
It was announced on 24 January 2008 that Burley had been appointed Scotland manager on a four-year contract. He became the third former Ipswich manager to manage his country, as Alf Ramsey and Bobby Robson had before him. In his first match in charge, Scotland drew 1–1 with Croatia. In the following two friendlies, Scotland failed to register a victory, with a 3–1 loss against the Czech Republic, and a goalless draw with Northern Ireland.

Although winning 2–1 against Iceland in their second game of the 2010 World Cup qualifying campaign, Burley received heavy criticism for the 1–0 defeat to Macedonia in the opening match and a 0–0 home draw against Norway. Questions were raised about his choice of bringing on uncapped Chris Iwelumo (who missed an open goal from 3 yards) instead of proven-goal scorer Kris Boyd. The Rangers striker quickly announced his retirement from international football while Burley was still in charge.

Scotland were defeated 3–0 in Amsterdam by the Netherlands, but then recovered by beating Iceland 2–1 at home. The team lost 4–0 to Norway in their next match, putting Burley&#x27;s bid to take Scotland to the World Cup for the first time since 1998 in jeopardy. Qualification to the play-offs remained in Scotland&#x27;s hands, with the team needing to win the two remaining fixtures to be guaranteed second place. Scottish FA chief Gordon Smith moved to confirm that Burley&#x27;s position was not under threat, but said that much depended on the final two matches.

In the end, a 2–0 home victory over Macedonia at Hampden on 5 September 2009 was followed four days later by a 0–1 defeat at home to the Netherlands, ending Scottish hopes of qualifying for the finals.

Despite failure to qualify for the 2010 World Cup, Burley was given the backing of the SFA at a meeting on 15 September 2009, to lead the country into the Euro 2012 qualifying campaign.

His final game as Scotland manager was a 0–3 loss to Wales on 14 November 2009 in Cardiff. On 15 November 2009, Burley came under fire, with reports suggesting he would lose his job as Scotland manager. and the following day, Burley was sacked as manager of Scotland after winning just three out of fourteen games.

===Crystal Palace===
On 17 June 2010, Burley took charge of Crystal Palace, with fellow Scot Dougie Freedman as his assistant. His first league match as Crystal Palace manager ended in a 3–2 victory over Leicester City. He was sacked after a 3–0 defeat against Millwall on New Year&#x27;s Day, 2011.

===Apollon Limassol===
On 10 May 2012, Burley was appointed as manager of Cypriot side Apollon Limassol. He was sacked in September after just two games in charge, due to an alleged rift with the club&#x27;s sporting director.

==Personal life==
His nephew, Craig, is also a former Scotland international footballer.

In September 2024, Burley revealed he was undergoing treatment for cancer.

<text>The Toyota T series is a family of inline-4 automobile engines manufactured by Toyota beginning in 1970 and ending in 1985. It started as a pushrod overhead valve (OHV) design and later performance oriented twin cam (DOHC) variants were added to the lineup. Toyota had built its solid reputation on the reliability of these engines.

The &quot;4T-GTE&quot; variant of this engine allowed Toyota to compete in the World Rally Championship in the early 1980s, making it the first Japanese manufacturer to do so.

Race engines based on the 2T-G include the 100E and 151E.

*All T engines utilize a timing chain and have a cast iron block with an alloy cylinder head with hardened valve seats and a hemispherical combustion chamber design (HEMI).
*All T engines are carburetted except those with electronic fuel injection, &quot;E&quot; designation.
*All T engines use a 2 valve OHV design except those with a DOHC performance head, &quot;G&quot; designation.
*The 12T/13T has a sub-cylinder directly behind the spark plug that leads into a smaller chamber for emission purposes.

==Features overview==

== T==

The first T engine displaced and was produced from 1970 through 1979. Cylinder bore and stroke is .

Output is at 6,000 rpm and at 3,800 rpm. The more-powerful twin-carburetor T-B was produced for the first six years, as well as the single carb T-D which had a somewhat higher compression ratio for .

From 1977 there was also a T-J, a version with some simple emissions equipment intended for Japanese market commercial vehicles. With an 8.5:1 compression ratio, this produces at 6,000 rpm and at 3,800 rpm.

The T-U also appeared in 1977 with even stricter emission equipment for Japanese market non-commercial vehicles.

Applications:
* 1970–1977 Toyota Carina TA10/15/16V (first generation)
* 1977–1979 Toyota Carina Van TA16V (second generation, T-J)
* Toyota Celica TA20
* Toyota Corolla TE20/25
* Toyota Corolla TE30/35/50
* Toyota Sprinter TE40/50

== 2T==

The larger 2T was produced from 1970 through 1984. Cylinder bore and stroke is .

The 2T engines are usually coupled with either a T40 4 speed/T50 5 speed manual transmission, or an A40 3 speed automatic transmission.

Output for the early 2T-C bigport design is which is also due to different SAE testing methods, while the later version is at 5200 rpm and at 3800 rpm, compression at 9.0:1. The twin-carb 2T-B produces and . The 2T-J, for commercial vehicles with less restrictive emissions standards, produces at 6000 rpm and at 3800 rpm.

Applications:
* Toyota Corolla E20 to E30 series
* Toyota Carina A10 to A60 series
* Toyota Celica A20 to A60 series
* Toyota Corona TT100/106V/110
* Toyota Corona TT130/137V
* Toyota Corona TT140
* Daihatsu Charmant
* Toyota TownAce TR10V (2T-J)
* Daihatsu Delta Wide TB10

This engine was also commonly used in Australian Formula Two race cars during the 1970s and 1980s, where they typically made between 180 and . The 1979 championship was won by a Toyota 2T-powered Cheetah Mk6.

=== 2T-G===

The 2T-G, produced from 1970 through 1983, is a chain driven 8v DOHC version. Output is and . Variants include the air-injected 2T-GR, Japan-spec 2T-GU, and fuel injected 2T-GEU. Twin sidedraft Mikuni-Solex PHH carburetors were used in non EFI versions. All 2T-G cylinder heads were cast by Yamaha, however, some are not marked as such.

The 2T-G was replaced by the 4A-GE in most applications.

Applications:
* Toyota Corolla Levin/Sprinter Trueno E20 through E70 series
* Toyota Celica A20 through A60 series
* Toyota Carina A10 through A60 series

Like the 2.0 L 18R-G, the 2T-G was considered the flagship engine of Toyota&#x27;s 1600 class until it was superseded by the 4A-GE in the 1980s. The 2T-G is still a popular engine for conversions to classic Celicas and Corollas and are often suitable for classic and formula racing series.

When bored out to a maximum of and combined with a 3T crankshaft, the 2T and 2T-G will have a displacement of almost 2.0 L. The 2T and 3T series use the same connecting rod dimensions, with the different pin heights on the pistons. Aftermarket pistons are available from very low (&lt;7.0:1) through to very high (&gt;13.0:1) compression ratios. Racing 2T-G engines (&quot;NOVA&quot;) featured bore and stroke for a displacement. Output is around at 6,000 rpm with a 12.0:1 compression ratio. This engine was used in Formula 3 cars in both Europe and Japan (where it dominated), as well as in Formula Pacific (FP).

== 12T==

The 12T and 12T-U (lean burn) was produced from 1970 through 1983. It produces at 5,600 rpm and at 3,400 rpm. There was also a 12T-J version for commercial vehicles, which didn&#x27;t have to meet as stringent emissions standards in Japan. In response to Honda&#x27;s CVCC emissions, Toyota introduced &quot;TTC-L&quot;, using a lean burn implementation.

Applications:
* Toyota Corolla TE52

== 3T==

The 3T displaces and was produced from 1973 through 1985. Cylinder bore and stroke is . The 3T-U was originally compliant with Japan&#x27;s 1976 emissions standards (TTC-C), from October 1977 it used Toyota&#x27;s lean burn system called TGP (&quot;Turbulence Generating Pot&quot;) in order to pass the 1978 emissions standards.

The 3T OHV engines are mated to either of a T40 4-speed, T50 5-speed manual transmission, or an A40 3-speed, or A40D 4-speed automatic transmission.

Output ranges from and between the California 3T-C and Japan-spec fuel injected 3T-EU.

== 3T-GTE==

The 3T-GTE, first released in September 1982, is the most performance oriented version of the 3T engine. It features a hemi chambered 8v twin-cam head with twin-spark (two spark plugs per cylinder) design and swirl inlet ports for better efficiency. The EFI system saw the introduction of knock control. It is turbocharged by a Toyota CT20 Turbo (the same unit as used in the 2L-T diesel) to generate at 6,000 rpm and at 4,800 rpm. This was the first turbocharged twin-cam engine built in Japan. Units built after May 1983 received a water cooled turbocharger. The engine was considerably over-engineered for durability, for instance featuring doubled cam roller chains, as it was also to form the basis for the 4T-GT competition engines. It either came mated to a W55 5speed manual with a larger clutch and lighter, flywheel or an A43D 4-speed automatic transmission.

Applications:
* Sept 1982–Jul 1985 Toyota Celica TA63
* Sept 1982–Jul 1985 Toyota Carina TA63
* Jan 1982–Aug 1985 Toyota Corona TT142
3T-GTE powered vehicles are badged as GT-T or GT-TR.

== 4T-GTE==

This is the version of the T family which powered Toyota&#x27;s Group B and World Rally Championship cars. The homologation engine, introduced in November 1982, features a increase in bore over the 3T, giving . With a multiplication factor of 1.4 for turbocharged engines, this equalled in the eyes of the FIA, placing the Celica in the class. The smaller 3T engine would have fit snugly under the 2.5-liter limit, but being in the larger class allowed Toyota to stretch the 4T-GT engine to , for a converted displacement of which better suited the comparatively heavy Celica.

In race trim it was a high-performance engine of with either a Toyota or a KKK/K27 turbocharger, electronic fuel injection, and a twin-spark ignition system, producing depending on race trim. The 1984 Group B rally version produced at 8,000 rpm. The road going homologation version (4T-GTEU, 200 built) produces . The total build number, including modified versions, was 228.

Applications:
* Oct 1982–Aug 1983 Toyota Celica (A60) GT-TS TA64
* Toyota Celica Turbo &quot;IMSA GTO&quot;
* Toyota Supra JGTC
* Toyota 83C
* Toyota 84C
* Toyota 85C
* Toyota 86C
* Eagle Mk I

==Race engines==
The &#x27;151E&#x27; engine used 4 valves per cylinder.

The &#x27;100E&#x27; engine used twin spark plugs with 2 valves per cylinder but was used mainly by a Toyota works team.

Italy Nova Corporation produced a 2.0 L engine based on the 2T-G that was used in most of the world F3 cars for a long time.

The production 4T-GTE was stretched to for race use.

<text>The Pyramids of Güímar are six rectangular pyramid-shaped, terraced structures built from lava stone without the use of mortar. They are located in the district of Chacona, part of the town of Güímar on the island of Tenerife in the Canary Islands, Spain. The structures have been dated to the 19th century AD and they may originally have been a byproduct of contemporary agricultural techniques. These pyramids stand as high as 12m.

Other pyramids employing the same methods and materials of construction can be found in various sites on Tenerife. In Güímar itself there were nine pyramids, only six of which survive.

==Research history==

===Thor Heyerdahl&#x27;s hypothesis===
In 1990, adventurer and publisher, Thor Heyerdahl, became aware of the &quot;Canarian Pyramids&quot; by reading an article written by Francisco Padrón in the Tenerife newspaper &quot;Diario de Avisos&quot; detailing &quot;real pyramids on the Canaries&quot;. As Heyerdahl had hypothesized a transatlantic link between Egypt and Central America, he became intrigued by the Güímar pyramids and relocated to Tenerife. There Heyerdahl researched possible parallels between the Canarian terrace structures and pyramid structures in Egypt and Central America in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica as ceremonial areas.

Heyerdahl hypothesised that the Canarian pyramids formed a temporal and geographic stopping point on voyages between ancient Egypt and the Maya civilization, initiating a controversy in which historians, esoterics, archaeologists, astronomers, and those with a general interest in history took part.

===Astronomical research and Freemasonry===
In 1991, research by Juan Antonio Belmonte Avilés, Antonio Aparicio Juan and César Esteban López, researchers of the Canary Institute of Astrophysics, shown that the long sides of some of the terrace structures at Güímar marked the direction of both solstices. The main limiting wall points to the sunset in the Summer solstice and the pyramids have stairs on their western side which face the direction of the rising sun on the Winter solstice. Also, standing on the platform of the largest pyramid on the day of the Summer solstice it is possible to experience a double sunset, as first the sun sets behind a mountain top, then it emerges again from behind the mountain and sets a second time behind a neighbouring peak. However, considering the room for interpretation, it is impossible based solely on these observations to conclude what was the intention of the builders or the building date.

In 2005, a book was published in Spanish by Aparicio and Esteban titled &quot;The Pyramids of Güímar: Myth and Reality&quot;. Aparicio and Esteban suggest that the solstitial orientations of the pyramids were potentially motivated by the Masonic symbolism. These authors argue that solstices are very important in the symbolism of Freemasonry, and that the owner of the land in the epoch in which the pyramids were built was himself a Freemason. This motivation would be only an aesthetic one and would not modify in any rate the fundamental motivation (agriculture) and date of construction.

=== Archaeological excavations ===
Between 1991 and 1998, with the agreement of Thor Heyerdahl, multiple excavations of the site by archaeologists of the University of La Laguna (Departamento de Prehistoria, Antropología e Historia Antigua) took place. In 1996 the results of the 1991 excavation were presented at a colloquium (published in 1998), providing evidence for the dating of the pyramids. According to the preceding geophysical Georadar-Survey eight locations adjacent to the pyramids, each with an area of 25 m², were investigated in layers down to the solid lava-floor. In doing so it was possible to establish three specific sediment layers. Starting from the top these were:

# A layer of thickness averaging 20 cm, consisting of humus-rich earth with many plant remains and roots; tracks from ploughing were clearly identifiable as were a broad spectrum of readily datable finds from the second half of the 20th century.
# A layer of thickness averaging 25 cm, similar in composition to the first layer, however containing less humus and a larger amount of small stones; a large variety of finds which could be dated to the 19th and 20th century were found, of which an official seal from 1848 deserves particular mention.
# A layer of thickness between 25 and 150 cm, composed out of small volcanic rocks, most likely put in place in one movement, which levelled the uneven stone underneath; the stones contained only very few finds, mostly a small number of pottery shards, of which some was local and some imported, both kinds were roughly estimated as belonging to the 19th century; the pyramids stand stratigraphically directly on top of this bottom layer, therefore allowing only for an earliest date of construction of the pyramids within the 19th century.

Furthermore, under the border edge of one of the pyramids, a natural lava cave was discovered. It had been walled up and yielded artefacts from the time of the Guanches. Since the pyramids lie stratigraphically above the cave, the Guanche finds from between 600 and 1000 AD can only support conclusions on the date of human use of the cave. The above survey indicates that the pyramids themselves cannot be older than the 19th century.

==Conclusions==

The archaeologists involved maintain that the creation of the terrace structures followed from the practices of the 19th century rural population, who created these structures while clearing cultivatable land of stones, as they piled the stones into these terrace shapes.

Heyerdahl suggested that the structures were not haphazardly piled-up stones. Heyerdahl maintained a belief in the hypothesis that the pyramids were connected with Guanches until his death. The association of the Guanches and the pyramids continues to be elaborated upon both in &quot;Pyramid park&quot; and on its official website.

Aparicio and Esteban&#x27;s theory connects the facts that the pyramids were built in the 19th century with the acknowledgement that they are not simply piles of stones.

== Ethnographic park ==
Following the completion of the excavations in 1998, the 65,000 m² area surrounding the pyramids was made accessible to the public. Heyerdahl received financial support from his friend the Canarian businessman Fred Olsen, who owns the largest transport company in the Canaries and whose family came to the islands from Norway in the 20th century. An information centre provides visitors with information about Heyerdahl’s research trips and his previous ideas regarding the pyramids. Two pavilions contain exhibits relating to Heyerdahl along with models of his boats; a replica of the Ra II in its original size, amongst others. In spite of the conclusions regarding the age of the pyramids outlined above, Heyerdahl continued to maintain a belief &quot;in a possible relationship between the existence of the pyramids and the pre Hispanic civilisation on Tenerife&quot;. The objects found in the Guanche cave are shown in the &quot;museum&quot; in heavily enlarged photos, whilst the imported ceramics from the 19th century are mentioned only briefly on an information board – without illustration.

<text>PLATO (Package for Linear-combination of ATomic Orbitals) is a suite of programs for electronic structure calculations. It receives its name from the choice of basis set (numeric atomic orbitals) used to expand the electronic wavefunctions.

PLATO is a code, written in C, for the efficient modelling of materials. It is a tight binding code (both orthogonal and non-orthogonal), allowing for multipole charges and electron spin. It also contains Density Functional Theory programs: these were restored to enable clear benchmarking to tight binding simulations, but can be used in their own right. The Density Functional Tight Binding program can be applied to systems with periodic boundary conditions in three dimension (crystals), as well as clusters and molecules.

== How PLATO works ==
How PLATO performs Density Functional Theory is summarized in several papers:
. The way it performs tight binding is summarized in the following papers

== Applications of PLATO ==
Some examples of its use are listed below.

=== Metals ===
* Point defects in transition metals: Density functional theory calculations have been performed to study the systematic trends of point defect behaviours in bee transition metals.

=== Surfaces ===
* Interaction of C60 molecules on Si(100):The interactions between pairs of C60 molecules adsorbed upon the Si(100) surface have been studied via a series of DFT calculations.

=== Molecules ===
* Efficient local-orbitals based method for ultrafast dynamics: The evolution of electrons in molecules under the influence of time-dependent electric fields is simulated.

<text>The National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA, , ) is legislation intended to preserve historic and archaeological sites in the United States of America. The act created the National Register of Historic Places, the list of National Historic Landmarks, and the State Historic Preservation Offices.

Senate Bill 3035, the National Historic Preservation Act, was signed into law on October 15, 1966, and is the most far-reaching preservation legislation ever enacted in the United States. Several amendments have been made since. Among other things, the act requires federal agencies to evaluate the impact of all federally funded or permitted projects on historic properties (buildings, archaeological sites, etc.) through a process known as &quot;Section 106 Review&quot;.

Many of the historic preservation provisions that had been in 16 U.S.C. are present in by , which was signed into law on December 19, 2014.

==Early development==
Prior to the 1960s, &quot;historic preservation was,&quot; according to a 2015 column in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;neither a public policy issue nor part of America&#x27;s architectural, planning and real estate development culture. Historic-preservation laws didn&#x27;t exist.&quot; Although there was no national policy regarding preservation until 1966, efforts in the 19th century initiated the journey towards legislation. One of the earliest efforts of the preservation movement occurred around the 1850s. President George Washington&#x27;s home, Mount Vernon, was in shambles. His nephew attempted to sell it to the federal government for $200,000, but the government did not authorize such a purchase. To prevent further destruction or conversion of the property to a resort, Ann Pamela Cunningham founded the Mount Vernon Ladies&#x27; Association to fight for this house. After establishing the first group promoting preservation efforts, they raised the money to acquire the property and protect it from ruin. Due to their efforts, this house has come to stand to represent the nation and the birth of independence, but it also, &quot;served as a blueprint for later organizations.&quot;

In 1906, an act was passed on the behalf of the nation&#x27;s history and land. President Teddy Roosevelt signed the Antiquities Act that &quot;prohibited the excavation of antiquities from public lands without a permit from the Secretary of Interior.&quot; It also gave the president authority to declare a specific piece of land a national monument, therefore protecting it from scavengers and proclaiming national identity.

In 1916, the Department of the Interior established a new entity known as the National Park Service, the nation&#x27;s first agency to regulate and manage public space, including the national monuments. &quot;Over the past fifty years the NPS has acquired more than of land, including not only the great chain of parks preserved for their natural beauty and value, but an extraordinary variety of historic buildings, monuments, and sites.&quot;

By 1935, Congress passed the Historic Sites Act, which established a national policy for preservation and permitted the Secretary of Interior to create programs on behalf of preservation efforts. During the Great Depression era, the Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS) was established by the Franklin D. Roosevelt Administration. It provided jobs for unemployed architects, engineers, and surveyors. They were charged with surveying, recording, documenting, and interpreting historic properties, creating an invaluable documentation of numerous buildings and other structures. The Historic Sites Act also organized the national parks under the National Park Service, which created the foundation for the future development of the National Register of Historic Places. Although the Antiquities Act and Historic Sites Act were major stepping stones for the preservation movement, these did not create a broad public &quot;national awareness.&quot;

On October 26, 1949, President Harry Truman signed legislation creating the National Trust for Historic Preservation &quot;to facilitate public participation in the preservation of sites, buildings, and objects of national significance or international interest.&quot; In addition, the law &quot;enforced public participation in preserving and protecting the sites, buildings, objects of national significance in American history.&quot; Initially, the National Trust for Historic Preservation did not provide funds for preservation projects. Today, they offer funds for planning and education and provide a plethora of information, techniques, and methods to assist people in carrying out preservation efforts locally.

==Post WWII and urban renewal==
In 1956, President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 into law which established the Interstate Highway System, providing an easy and efficient way for troops to depart if under attack. Due to this new construction, many historic properties were destroyed. In the 1960s, President John F. Kennedy launched the Urban Renewal Program. Hoping the plan would rejuvenate the cities, it in fact increased the destruction in the downtown areas. The increase in population around this time, as well, and the manufacturing of cars called for a rapid change, therefore hindering our nation and its culture. &quot;With the urbanization, tear downs, and rebuilding America ... it is destroying the physical evidence of the past.&quot; During the 1950s and 1960s, people saw the negative changes in their cities and developed a concern for their &quot;quality of life that reflected their identity.&quot;

As a response to the nationwide destruction brought about by federally initiated programs, a report coordinated by Lady Bird Johnson analyzed the country and the effects of urban renewal. &quot;With Heritage So Rich&quot;, an accumulation of essays, wrote &quot;an expansive inventory of properties reflecting the nation&#x27;s heritage, a mechanism to protect those properties from unnecessary harm caused by federal activities, a program of financial incentives, and an independent federal preservation body to coordinate the actions of federal agencies affecting historic preservation.&quot; The book triggered public awareness of the issue and offered a proposition to handle the situation through the National Historic Preservation Act.

==National Historic Preservation Act==

The National Historic Preservation Act was signed into law by Lyndon B. Johnson on October 15, 1966. This act established several institutions: Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, State Historic Preservation Office, National Register of Historic Places, and the Section 106 review process. The Section 106 Process is further explained and defined in .

Meeting four times a year, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation consists of 23 members from both public and private sectors, with the chairman appointed by the president. The council&#x27;s role is to advise the President and Congress on historic preservation issues, to develop policies and guidelines handling any conflicts of federal agencies, and to participate in the Section 106 review process.

The National Register of Historic Places, overseen by the National Park Service, is the nation&#x27;s official list of districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects worthy of preservation, and are officially designated &quot;historic properties&quot; regardless of whether they are archaeological or historic. To be eligible for listing, a property must meet one of four criteria and have sufficient integrity. Being listed on or eligible for listing on the National Register does not automatically prevent damage or destruction but it qualifies these approved properties for grants, loans, and tax incentives.

The State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) and Officer was established by the NHPA to coordinate statewide inventory of historic properties, nominate properties to the National Register, maintain a statewide preservation plan, assist others, and advise and educate locals. There are a total of 59 SHPO officers, one for each state with eight additional ones, which include the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and others.

==Section 106 review process==
Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act mandates federal agencies undergo a review process for all federally funded and permitted projects that will impact sites listed on, or eligible for listing on, the National Register of Historic Places. Specifically it requires the federal agency to &quot;take into account&quot; the effect a project may have on historic properties. It allows interested parties an opportunity to comment on the potential impact projects may have on significant archaeological or historic sites. The main purpose for the establishment of the Section 106 review process is to minimize potential harm and damage to historic properties.

Any federal agency whose project, funding or permit may affect a historic property, both those listed or eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places, must consider the effects on historic properties and &quot;seek ways to avoid, minimize or mitigate&quot; any adverse effects on historic properties. The typical Section 106 Review involves four primary steps: 1 - Initiation of the Section 106 Review; 2 - Identification of Historic Properties; 3 - Assessment of Adverse Effects; and 4 - Resolution of Adverse Effects. Further steps may be required if there is a disagreement among the consulting parties on adverse effects or the resolution of the effects.

The federal agency overseeing the project inventories the project area (or contracts with a qualified consultant) to determine the presence or absence of historic properties. They then submit to the SHPO a Determination of Effect/Finding of Effect (DOE/FOE) outlining to the SHPO the project, the efforts taken identify historic properties, and what effects, if any, the project may have on historic properties. If the project is believed to have no adverse effect on eligible historic resources and the SHPO and other consulting parties agree, then the Section 106 process is effectively closed and the project may proceed. Alternatively, if an adverse effect is expected, the agency is required to work with the local State Historic Preservation Office to ensure that all interested parties are given an opportunity to review the proposed work and provide comments. This step seeks ways for the project to avoid having an adverse effect on historic properties. Ideally, a Memorandum of Agreement is reached between all consulting parties outlining agreed to mitigation or avoidance of historic properties, but this is not always the case. Without this process historical properties would lose a significant protection. This process helps decide different approaches and solutions to the project, but does not prevent any site from demolition or alteration.

==Motives==

Early preservation efforts were driven by patriotism and a desire to protect the new establishment of the nation by wealthy, private individuals. Early efforts focused primarily on individual structures as opposed to areas such as a neighborhood in a city or a rural landscape. The preserved structures were often turned into museums to create a showcase and generate tourism. The focus of preservation eventually shifted from patriotism to the aesthetics of a structure or area and ultimately to their structural relationships with society at large. According to Robin Elizabeth Datel, modern motivations for preservation can be summed up in four points: 
* to retain diverse elements of past
* to perpetuate the distinctive identities of places
* to involve amateurs in landscape care
* to practice a conservation approach to environmental change.
The economic benefits of preservation continue to become more important and better understood and documented. Preservation efforts produce the most jobs in the nation&#x27;s economy and these jobs create new businesses and tourism, increase property values, and enhanced the quality of life in a community.

==Effects==
The National Historic Preservation Act has led to major changes in the employment trends in historic preservation fields. Archaeologists, historians, historic architects, and others have been employed in vast numbers in the field of cultural resource management. Cultural resource management is an umbrella term that encompasses archaeology, historic preservation and other disciplines when employed for the purposes of compliance with NHPA and other federal and state-mandated historic preservation laws.

Prior to the passage and subsequent enforcement (through litigation) of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 and other laws, most archaeologists, (architectural) historians, and other historic preservation specialists were employed primarily in the field of academia, working at universities or other places of higher learning. However, since the passage of the NHPA, ever-increasing numbers of these professionals are employed in support of the cultural resources management industry. Large public works projects often require that teams of archaeologists perform limited excavations in order to properly inventory buried archaeological remains and assess their eligibility for the National Register of Historic Places. This industry has also allowed a larger swath of individuals to participate in archaeology and history as, unlike in the academic arena, a PhD is not required to earn a professional livelihood.

The Secretary of the Interior&#x27;s Professional Qualification Standards for archeologists require a graduate degree plus at least one year of full-time experience, at least four months of fieldwork, and demonstrated ability to carry research to completion. Additionally, the basic field work often required in support of performing inventories of cultural resources is conducted by individuals with or earning bachelor&#x27;s degrees. As a result, many undergraduates and recent graduates in the fields which support the implementation of the National Historic Preservation Act have found gainful employment. In the past, they stood little chance of earning a living in these fields without an advanced degree. However, Cultural Resource Management (CRM) is still one of the lowest paying fields for educated professionals.

<text>Syed Zamir Jafri (Urdu: &quot;سيد ضمير شاه جعفري&quot;; January 1, 1916 – May 12, 1999) was a Pakistani poet, writer, social critic, humourist, comedian, columnist, broadcaster and telecaster. He is best known for his Urdu poetry which gained international recognition.

==Biography==
Zamir Jafri was born in a Syed family. He was the father of former head of Pakistan&#x27;s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) Ehtesham Zamir and professional cricketer Syed Imtanan Zamir. His native village, Chak Abdul Khaliq, is located near Dina, in the Jhelum district.

Jafri has had great influence on Urdu poetry, and has focused on themes of peace and love for mankind. He had published 78 books of poetry and prose, written in Urdu, Punjabi, and English.

Jafri was posted to the Far East where he continued to serve in the Education Corps of Pakistan Army and participated in the Indo-Pakistani wars of 1947–1948 and 1965. He retired from the Army as a Major in 1965 and was appointed the first Director Public Relations of Capital Development Authority - a body formed to look after the development of Pakistan&#x27;s newly announced capital at Islamabad. Jafri remained at this post for over fifteen years and had the honor of naming the roads and residential/commercial sectors of the new capital. Thereafter, he served on contract assignments as Deputy Director-General of Pakistan National Centre in the Ministry of Information, as Advisor to the Chief Commissioner Afghan Refugees and lastly as Chief Editor in the Academy of Letters.

<text>Sir John de Courcy (c. 1150–1219) was an Anglo-Norman knight who arrived in Ireland in 1176. From then until his expulsion in 1204, he conquered a considerable territory, endowed religious establishments, built abbeys for both the Benedictines and the Cistercians and built strongholds at Dundrum Castle in County Down and Carrickfergus Castle in County Antrim.

==Early career in Ireland==
Belonging to a family which took its name from Courcy (Normandy), John de Courcy came to Ireland around the year 1171 as part of the Norman invading forces, brought in as mercenaries working for Diarmaid Mac Murchadha, the ousted King of Leinster, to help him regain his position as king.

De Courcy&#x27;s exact parentage is unknown. The man thought to be his great-grandfather, Richard de Courcy is named in the Domesday Book. De Courcy&#x27;s grandfather, William de Courcy I, married Emma de Falaise. His father, William de Courcy II, married Avice de Rumilly and died before 1130, leaving the family estates in Somerset and elsewhere in England to his son, William de Courcy III, John&#x27;s possible brother.

John was very ambitious and wanted lands for himself. He decided to invade the north of Ireland which was controlled by Irish dynasties. In early January 1177, he assembled a small army of 22 knights and 300 foot-soldiers and marched north, at the rate of thirty miles a day. They skirted the back of the Mourne Mountains and took the town of Dún Dá Leathghlas (now Downpatrick) by surprise. After two fierce battles, in February and June 1177, de Courcy defeated the last King of Ulaid, Ruaidhrí Mac Duinnshléibhe.

He did all this without King Henry II&#x27;s permission.

After conquering eastern Ulster, he established his seat at Carrickfergus, where he built an impressive stone castle. Other monasteries and castles that he built are Inch Abbey and Dundrum. He married Affrica, daughter of Godred II Olafsson, King of Mann. It is likely that the marriage, as in the case of many kings and those aspiring to be kings in those days, was political, to seal an alliance with her father who paid homage to the King of Norway. John and Affreca are not recorded to have had any children. Affreca built a monastery at Greyabbey dedicated to Saint Mary of The Yoke of God. She is buried there and her effigy, in stone, can still be seen.

In 1183, de Courcy provided for the establishment of a priory at the cathedral of Down with generous endowments to the Benedictines from Chester in England (free from all subjugation to Chester Cathedral). This building was destroyed by an earthquake in 1245. He also created a cell for Benedictines at St. Andrews in the Ards (Black Abbey) for the houses of Stoke Courcy in Somerset and Lonlay in France, which was near Inishargy, Kircubbin, in present-day County Down. The early Irish monastery of Nendrum was given to the Benedictine house of St Bees in Cumberland in order that they might also establish a cell. His wife, Affreca, founded the Cistercian monastery of Grey Abbey, County Down, as a daughter house of Holm Cultram (Cumberland) in 1193.

He also made incursions into the west to increase his territory and lordship. In 1188 he invaded Connacht, but was repulsed and the next year he plundered Armagh.

==Later career in Ireland==

After the accession of Richard I in 1189, de Courcy in conjunction with William de Lacy appears in some way to have offended the king by his proceedings in Ireland. De Lacy quickly made his peace with Richard, while de Courcy defied him, and the subsequent history of the latter consisted mainly in the vicissitudes of a lasting feud with the de Lacys. Hugh de Lacy, younger son of Hugh de Lacy Lord of Meath, began to wage war on John de Courcy, capturing him in 1204. An account of his capture appears in the Book of Howth. This passage helps explain why John had a reputation as a strong, God-fearing warrior:
In May 1205, King John made Hugh Earl of Ulster, granting him all the land of the province &quot;as John de Courcy held it on the day when Hugh defeated him&quot;. John de Courcy returned, sailing across the Irish sea from the Isle of Man in July 1205 with Norse soldiers and a hundred boats supplied by his brother-in-law, Ragnold, King of Mann. John and his army landed at Strangford and laid siege to Dundrum Castle in vain because the defences he himself had made were too strong.

== Holy Land and death ==
King John then had John de Courcy imprisoned and he spent the rest of his life in poverty. He was subsequently released when he &quot;crossed himself&quot; to go on a pilgrimage to the Jerusalem. After returning from the Holy Land, De Courcy died in obscurity near present-day Craigavon.
==Literary references==
The story of John de Courcy&#x27;s defeat of the French champion, and his winning the privilege to remain covered in the presence of the King, appears in Chapter 12 of Mark Twain&#x27;s &quot;The Prince and the Pauper&quot;.

In his book &quot;Saint Patrick&#x27;s Town&quot;, Anthony M. Wilson said about John de Courcy:

<doc id="1337587" wikidata="Q2366896" url="?curid=1337587" title="Semisimple Lie algebra">
<text>In mathematics, a Lie algebra is semisimple if it is a direct sum of simple Lie algebras. (A simple Lie algebra is a non-abelian Lie algebra without any non-zero proper ideals.)

Throughout the article, unless otherwise stated, a Lie algebra is a finite-dimensional Lie algebra over a field of characteristic 0. For such a Lie algebra formula_1, if nonzero, the following conditions are equivalent:
*formula_1 is semisimple;
*the Killing form, κ(x,y) = tr(ad(&quot;x&quot;)ad(&quot;y&quot;)), is non-degenerate;
*formula_1 has no non-zero abelian ideals;
*formula_1 has no non-zero solvable ideals;
* the radical (maximal solvable ideal) of formula_1 is zero.

== Significance ==
The significance of semisimplicity comes firstly from the Levi decomposition, which states that every finite dimensional Lie algebra is the semidirect product of a solvable ideal (its radical) and a semisimple algebra. In particular, there is no nonzero Lie algebra that is both solvable and semisimple.

Semisimple Lie algebras have a very elegant classification, in stark contrast to solvable Lie algebras. Semisimple Lie algebras over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero are completely classified by their root system, which are in turn classified by Dynkin diagrams. Semisimple algebras over non-algebraically closed fields can be understood in terms of those over the algebraic closure, though the classification is somewhat more intricate; see real form for the case of real semisimple Lie algebras, which were classified by Élie Cartan.

Further, the representation theory of semisimple Lie algebras is much cleaner than that for general Lie algebras. For example, the Jordan decomposition in a semisimple Lie algebra coincides with the Jordan decomposition in its representation; this is not the case for Lie algebras in general.

If formula_1 is semisimple, then formula_7. In particular, every linear semisimple Lie algebra is a subalgebra of formula_8, the special linear Lie algebra. The study of the structure of formula_8 constitutes an important part of the representation theory for semisimple Lie algebras.

== History ==
The semisimple Lie algebras over the complex numbers were first classified by Wilhelm Killing (1888–90), though his proof lacked rigor. His proof was made rigorous by Élie Cartan (1894) in his Ph.D. thesis, who also classified semisimple real Lie algebras. This was subsequently refined, and the present classification by Dynkin diagrams was given by then 22-year-old Eugene Dynkin in 1947. Some minor modifications have been made (notably by J. P. Serre), but the proof is unchanged in its essentials and can be found in any standard reference, such as .

== Basic properties ==
*Every ideal, quotient and product of semisimple Lie algebras is again semisimple.
*The center of a semisimple Lie algebra formula_1 is trivial (since the center is an abelian ideal). In other words, the adjoint representation formula_11 is injective. Moreover, the image turns out to be formula_12 of derivations on formula_13. Hence, formula_14 is an isomorphism. (This is a special case of Whitehead&#x27;s lemma.)
*As the adjoint representation is injective, a semisimple Lie algebra is a linear Lie algebra under the adjoint representation. This may lead to some ambiguity, as every Lie algebra is already linear with respect to some other vector space (Ado&#x27;s theorem), although not necessarily via the adjoint representation. But in practice, such ambiguity rarely occurs.
*If formula_1 is a semisimple Lie algebra, then formula_7 (because formula_17 is semisimple and abelian).
*A finite-dimensional Lie algebra formula_1 over a field &quot;k&quot; of characteristic zero is semisimple if and only if the base extension formula_19 is semisimple for each field extension formula_20. Thus, for example, a finite-dimensional real Lie algebra is semisimple if and only if its complexification is semisimple.

==Jordan decomposition==
Each endomorphism &quot;x&quot; of a finite-dimensional vector space over a field of characteristic zero can be decomposed uniquely into a semisimple (i.e., diagonalizable over the algebraic closure) and nilpotent part
:formula_21
such that &quot;s&quot; and &quot;n&quot; commute with each other. Moreover, each of &quot;s&quot; and &quot;n&quot; is a polynomial in &quot;x&quot;. This is the Jordan decomposition of &quot;x&quot;.

The above applies to the adjoint representation formula_11 of a semisimple Lie algebra formula_1. An element &quot;x&quot; of formula_1 is said to be semisimple (resp. nilpotent) if formula_25 is a semisimple (resp. nilpotent) operator. If formula_26, then the abstract Jordan decomposition states that &quot;x&quot; can be written uniquely as:
:formula_27
where formula_28 is semisimple, formula_29 is nilpotent and formula_30. Moreover, if formula_31 commutes with &quot;x&quot;, then it commutes with both formula_32 as well.

The abstract Jordan decomposition factors through any representation of formula_1 in the sense that given any representation ρ,
:formula_34
is the Jordan decomposition of ρ(&quot;x&quot;) in the endomorphism algebra of the representation space. (This is proved as a consequence of Weyl&#x27;s complete reducibility theorem; see Weyl&#x27;s theorem on complete reducibility#Application: preservation of Jordan decomposition.)

== Structure ==
Let formula_1 be a (finite-dimensional) semisimple Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. The structure of formula_1 can be described by an adjoint action of a certain distinguished subalgebra on it, a Cartan subalgebra. By definition, a Cartan subalgebra (also called a maximal toral subalgebra) formula_37 of formula_1 is a maximal subalgebra such that, for each formula_39, formula_40 is diagonalizable. As it turns out, formula_37 is abelian and so all the operators in formula_42 are simultaneously diagonalizable. For each linear functional formula_43 of formula_37, let
:formula_45.
(Note that formula_46 is the centralizer of formula_37.) Then
(The most difficult item to show is formula_48. The standard proofs all use some facts in the representation theory of formula_49; e.g., Serre uses the fact that an formula_49-module with a primitive element of negative weight is infinite-dimensional, contradicting formula_51.)

Let formula_52 with the commutation relations formula_53; i.e., the formula_54 correspond to the standard basis of formula_49.

The linear functionals in formula_56 are called the roots of formula_1 relative to formula_37. The roots span formula_59 (since if formula_60, then formula_40 is the zero operator; i.e., formula_62 is in the center, which is zero.) Moreover, from the representation theory of formula_49, one deduces the following symmetry and integral properties of formula_56: for each formula_65,

Note that formula_66 has the properties (1) formula_67 and (2) the fixed-point set is formula_68, which means that formula_66 is the reflection with respect to the hyperplane corresponding to formula_43. The above then says that formula_56 is a root system.

It follows from the general theory of a root system that formula_56 contains a basis formula_73 of formula_74 such that each root is a linear combination of formula_73 with integer coefficients of the same sign; the roots formula_76 are called simple roots. Let formula_77, etc. Then the formula_78 elements formula_79 (called Chevalley generators) generate formula_1 as a Lie algebra. Moreover, they satisfy the relations (called Serre relations): with formula_81,
:formula_82
:formula_83
:formula_84
:formula_85.
The converse of this is also true: i.e., the Lie algebra generated by the generators and the relations like the above is a (finite-dimensional) semisimple Lie algebra that has the root space decomposition as above (provided the formula_86 is a Cartan matrix). This is a theorem of Serre. In particular, two semisimple Lie algebras are isomorphic if they have the same root system.

The implication of the axiomatic nature of a root system and Serre&#x27;s theorem is that one can enumerate all possible root systems; hence, &quot;all possible&quot; semisimple Lie algebras (finite-dimensional over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero).

The Weyl group is the group of linear transformations of formula_87 generated by the formula_88&#x27;s. The Weyl group is an important symmetry of the problem; for example, the weights of any finite-dimensional representation of formula_13 are invariant under the Weyl group.

== Example root space decomposition in sln(C) ==
For formula_90 and the Cartan subalgebra formula_91 of diagonal matrices, define formula_92 by
:formula_93,
where formula_94 denotes the diagonal matrix with formula_95 on the diagonal. Then the decomposition is given by
:formula_96
where
:formula_97
for the vector formula_98 in formula_99 with the standard (matrix) basis, meaning formula_98 represents the basis vector in the formula_101-th row and formula_102-th column. This decomposition of formula_13 has an associated root system:
:formula_104

=== sl2(C) ===
For example, in formula_105 the decomposition is
:formula_106
and the associated root system is
:formula_107

=== sl3(C) ===
In formula_108 the decomposition is
:formula_109
and the associated root system is given by
:formula_110

== Examples ==
As noted in #Structure, semisimple Lie algebras over formula_111 (or more generally an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero) are classified by the root system associated to their Cartan subalgebras, and the root systems, in turn, are classified by their Dynkin diagrams.
Examples of semisimple Lie algebras, the classical Lie algebras, with notation coming from their Dynkin diagrams, are:
* formula_112 formula_113, the special linear Lie algebra.
* formula_114 formula_115, the odd-dimensional special orthogonal Lie algebra.
* formula_116 formula_117, the symplectic Lie algebra.
* formula_118 formula_119, the even-dimensional special orthogonal Lie algebra (formula_120).
The restriction formula_120 in the formula_122 family is needed because formula_123 is one-dimensional and commutative and therefore not semisimple.

These Lie algebras are numbered so that &quot;n&quot; is the rank. Almost all of these semisimple Lie algebras are actually simple and the members of these families are almost all distinct, except for some collisions in small rank. For example formula_124 and formula_125. These four families, together with five exceptions (E6, E7, E8, F4, and G2), are in fact the &quot;only&quot; simple Lie algebras over the complex numbers.

== Classification ==
Every semisimple Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0 is a direct sum of simple Lie algebras (by definition), and the finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras fall in four families – An, Bn, Cn, and Dn – with five exceptions
E6, E7, E8, F4, and G2. Simple Lie algebras are classified by the connected Dynkin diagrams, shown on the right, while semisimple Lie algebras correspond to not necessarily connected Dynkin diagrams, where each component of the diagram corresponds to a summand of the decomposition of the semisimple Lie algebra into simple Lie algebras.

The classification proceeds by considering a Cartan subalgebra (see below) and its adjoint action on the Lie algebra. The root system of the action then both determines the original Lie algebra and must have a very constrained form, which can be classified by the Dynkin diagrams. See the section below describing Cartan subalgebras and root systems for more details.

The classification is widely considered one of the most elegant results in mathematics – a brief list of axioms yields, via a relatively short proof, a complete but non-trivial classification with surprising structure. This should be compared to the classification of finite simple groups, which is significantly more complicated.

The enumeration of the four families is non-redundant and consists only of simple algebras if formula_126 for An, formula_127 for Bn, formula_128 for Cn, and formula_129 for Dn. If one starts numbering lower, the enumeration is redundant, and one has exceptional isomorphisms between simple Lie algebras, which are reflected in isomorphisms of Dynkin diagrams; the En can also be extended down, but below E6 are isomorphic to other, non-exceptional algebras.

Over a non-algebraically closed field, the classification is more complicated – one classifies simple Lie algebras over the algebraic closure, then for each of these, one classifies simple Lie algebras over the original field which have this form (over the closure). For example, to classify simple real Lie algebras, one classifies real Lie algebras with a given complexification, which are known as real forms of the complex Lie algebra; this can be done by Satake diagrams, which are Dynkin diagrams with additional data (&quot;decorations&quot;).

==Representation theory of semisimple Lie algebras ==
Let formula_1 be a (finite-dimensional) semisimple Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. Then, as in #Structure, formula_131 where formula_56 is the root system. Choose the simple roots in formula_56; a root formula_43 of formula_56 is then called positive and is denoted by formula_136 if it is a linear combination of the simple roots with non-negative integer coefficients. Let formula_137, which is a maximal solvable subalgebra of formula_1, the Borel subalgebra.

Let &quot;V&quot; be a (possibly-infinite-dimensional) simple formula_1-module. If &quot;V&quot; happens to admit a formula_140-weight vector formula_141, then it is unique up to scaling and is called the highest weight vector of &quot;V&quot;. It is also an formula_37-weight vector and the formula_37-weight of formula_141, a linear functional of formula_37, is called the highest weight of &quot;V&quot;. The basic yet nontrivial facts then are (1) to each linear functional formula_146, there exists a simple formula_1-module formula_148 having formula_149 as its highest weight and (2) two simple modules having the same highest weight are equivalent. In short, there exists a bijection between formula_59 and the set of the equivalence classes of simple formula_1-modules admitting a Borel-weight vector.

For applications, one is often interested in a finite-dimensional simple formula_1-module (a finite-dimensional irreducible representation). This is especially the case when formula_1 is the Lie algebra of a Lie group (or complexification of such), since, via the Lie correspondence, a Lie algebra representation can be integrated to a Lie group representation when the obstructions are overcome. The next criterion then addresses this need: by the positive Weyl chamber formula_154, we mean the convex cone formula_155 where formula_156 is a unique vector such that formula_157. The criterion then reads:
*formula_158 if and only if, for each positive root formula_136, (1) formula_160 is an integer and (2) formula_149 lies in formula_162.
A linear functional formula_149 satisfying the above equivalent condition is called a dominant integral weight. Hence, in summary, there exists a bijection between the dominant integral weights and the equivalence classes of finite-dimensional simple formula_1-modules, the result known as the theorem of the highest weight. The character of a finite-dimensional simple module in turns is computed by the Weyl character formula.

The theorem due to Weyl says that, over a field of characteristic zero, every finite-dimensional module of a semisimple Lie algebra formula_1 is completely reducible; i.e., it is a direct sum of simple formula_1-modules. Hence, the above results then apply to finite-dimensional representations of a semisimple Lie algebra.

== Real semisimple Lie algebra ==
For a semisimple Lie algebra over a field that has characteristic zero but is not algebraically closed, there is no general structure theory like the one for those over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. But over the field of real numbers, there are still the structure results.

Let formula_1 be a finite-dimensional real semisimple Lie algebra and formula_168 the complexification of it (which is again semisimple). The real Lie algebra formula_1 is called a real form of formula_170. A real form is called a compact form if the Killing form on it is negative-definite; it is necessarily the Lie algebra of a compact Lie group (hence, the name).

=== Compact case ===
Suppose formula_1 is a compact form and formula_172 a maximal abelian subspace. One can show (for example, from the fact formula_1 is the Lie algebra of a compact Lie group) that formula_42 consists of skew-Hermitian matrices, diagonalizable over formula_111 with imaginary eigenvalues. Hence, formula_176 is a Cartan subalgebra of formula_170 and there results in the root space decomposition (cf. #Structure)
:formula_178
where each formula_179 is real-valued on formula_180; thus, can be identified with a real-linear functional on the real vector space formula_180.

For example, let formula_182 and take formula_172 the subspace of all diagonal matrices. Note formula_184. Let formula_185 be the linear functional on formula_186 given by formula_187 for formula_188. Then for each formula_189,
:formula_190
where formula_191 is the matrix that has 1 on the formula_192-th spot and zero elsewhere. Hence, each root formula_43 is of the form formula_194 and the root space decomposition is the decomposition of matrices:
:formula_195

=== Noncompact case ===
Suppose formula_1 is not necessarily a compact form (i.e., the signature of the Killing form is not all negative). Suppose, moreover, it has a Cartan involution formula_197 and let formula_198 be the eigenspace decomposition of formula_197, where formula_200 are the eigenspaces for 1 and -1, respectively. For example, if formula_201 and formula_197 the negative transpose, then formula_203.

Let formula_204 be a maximal abelian subspace. Now, formula_205 consists of symmetric matrices (with respect to a suitable inner product) and thus the operators in formula_206 are simultaneously diagonalizable, with real eigenvalues. By repeating the arguments for the algebraically closed base field, one obtains the decomposition (called the restricted root space decomposition):
:formula_207
where
*the elements in formula_56 are called the restricted roots,
*formula_209 for any linear functional formula_43; in particular, formula_211,
*formula_212.
Moreover, formula_56 is a root system but not necessarily reduced one (i.e., it can happen formula_214 are both roots).

== The case of sl(n,C)==
If formula_215, then formula_91 may be taken to be the diagonal subalgebra of formula_13, consisting of diagonal matrices whose diagonal entries sum to zero. Since formula_91 has dimension formula_219, we see that formula_220 has rank formula_219.

The root vectors formula_222 in this case may be taken to be the matrices formula_223 with formula_224, where formula_223 is the matrix with a 1 in the formula_226 spot and zeros elsewhere. If formula_227 is a diagonal matrix with diagonal entries formula_228, then we have
:formula_229.
Thus, the roots for formula_230 are the linear functionals formula_231 given by
:formula_232.
After identifying formula_91 with its dual, the roots become the vectors formula_234 in the space of formula_29-tuples that sum to zero. This is the root system known as formula_236 in the conventional labeling.

The reflection associated to the root formula_231 acts on formula_91 by transposing the formula_101 and formula_102 diagonal entries. The Weyl group is then just the permutation group on formula_29 elements, acting by permuting the diagonal entries of matrices in formula_91.

== Generalizations ==

Semisimple Lie algebras admit certain generalizations. Firstly, many statements that are true for semisimple Lie algebras are true more generally for reductive Lie algebras. Abstractly, a reductive Lie algebra is one whose adjoint representation is completely reducible, while concretely, a reductive Lie algebra is a direct sum of a semisimple Lie algebra and an abelian Lie algebra; for example, formula_243 is semisimple, and formula_244 is reductive. Many properties of semisimple Lie algebras depend only on reducibility.

Many properties of complex semisimple/reductive Lie algebras are true not only for semisimple/reductive Lie algebras over algebraically closed fields, but more generally for split semisimple/reductive Lie algebras over other fields: semisimple/reductive Lie algebras over algebraically closed fields are always split, but over other fields this is not always the case. Split Lie algebras have essentially the same representation theory as semisimple Lie algebras over algebraically closed fields, for instance, the splitting Cartan subalgebra playing the same role as the Cartan subalgebra plays over algebraically closed fields. This is the approach followed in , for instance, which classifies representations of split semisimple/reductive Lie algebras.

==Semisimple and reductive groups==

A connected Lie group is called semisimple if its Lie algebra is a semisimple Lie algebra, i.e. a direct sum of simple Lie algebras. It is called reductive if its Lie algebra is a direct sum of simple and trivial (one-dimensional) Lie algebras. Reductive groups occur naturally as symmetries of a number of mathematical objects in algebra, geometry, and physics. For example, the group formula_245 of symmetries of an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional real vector space (equivalently, the group of invertible matrices) is reductive.

<doc id="1337596" wikidata="Q930923" url="?curid=1337596" title="The Adventure of the Naval Treaty">
<text>&quot;The Adventure of the Naval Treaty&quot;, one of the 56 Sherlock Holmes short stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is one of 12 stories in the cycle collected as &quot;The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. It was first published in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in the United Kingdom in October and November 1893, and in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; in the United States on 14 and 21 October 1893.

Doyle ranked &quot;The Adventure of the Naval Treaty&quot; 19th in a list of his 19 favourite Sherlock Holmes stories.

==Plot==

Percy Phelps, a young Foreign Office employee from Woking, sends a letter to Dr. Watson, a former schoolfellow of his. Phelps indicates something has caused him a nine-week attack of brain fever; now that he has recovered, he begs Watson to bring Holmes to his aid. Holmes views the letter, and deduces that it was dictated to, and written by, a woman. He accompanies Watson to Briarbrae, Phelps&#x27; house. There, they are greeted by Joseph Harrison, the brother of Phelps&#x27; fiancée Annie (the author of the letter). Joseph shows them in to see Phelps, who is still recovering from his long illness and being nursed by Annie.

Phelps lays the case before Holmes. Two months earlier, his uncle and superior in the Foreign Office, Lord Holdhurst, had ordered him to copy an important naval treaty between England and Italy. The treaty was to be kept secret, for many foreign governments would want to read it. Phelps told no one of this assignment, and waited until the building was empty except for Tangey, the commissionaire, and his wife, who did the charring. Phelps then copied the papers as quickly as he could but it soon became apparent the task would take most of the night.

Phelps rang the bell for some coffee. Mrs. Tangey took the order to her husband; much later, Phelps came downstairs to investigate why he had not received his coffee, and found Tangey had fallen asleep. The bell to Phelps&#x27; office rang; realizing someone was in the room, Phelps dashed back upstairs and found the naval treaty gone. There were no hiding places, and no one could have passed Phelps on the front stair, so the thief must have come and gone by the back stair. Phelps, a constable, and Inspector Forbes of Scotland Yard frantically searched for the thief without success. Phelps had a nervous breakdown, and was escorted back to Briarbrae. As Joseph&#x27;s bedroom was best suited for a sickroom, Joseph had been forced out of it by the doctor. Percy has remained there, nursed by Annie by day and a hired nurse by night.

 Holmes starts the investigation at the Foreign Office, interviewing both Lord Holdhurst and Inspector Forbes. He learns that the Tangeys, and a clerk named Charles Gorot, were suspected and then cleared. Lord Holdhurst informs him that no foreign government has received the treaty yet, which seems odd since nine weeks have passed. Holmes also discovers that Annie and Joseph were never meant to be long-term guests; they had come down for a few days&#x27; visit when the tragedy occurred, but had stayed so Annie could nurse her fiancée.

Returning to Briarbrae the next day, Holmes learns that Phelps dispensed with the hired nurse the evening before. Later that same evening, someone tried to break into Phelps&#x27; sickroom window with a knife. Phelps immediately roused the household, but the burglar got away.

Unbeknownst to Phelps or Joseph, Holmes orders Annie to stay in the sickroom until bedtime, and to lock the door behind her when she leaves. He then arranges that Phelps and Watson should go to London. Watson takes Phelps back to 221B Baker Street, but neither can understand Holmes&#x27; actions. The next morning, Holmes arrives with disheveled clothes and a bandaged hand. At the breakfast table, he pretends to have found nothing, but then arranges for Mrs. Hudson to serve Phelps the treaty on his breakfast plate. Phelps is overjoyed to have it back, nearly fainting with relief.

Holmes had realized Joseph Harrison was responsible; the sickroom was formerly his bedroom, and only someone in the house could have known when no nurse would be on guard. Joseph had come to Percy&#x27;s office to ask if Percy was coming home, rung the bell, then found the treaty. As Joseph had some stock exchange debts to pay, he stole the treaty, intending to sell it, and hid it under the floorboards of his bedroom. However, Percy&#x27;s breakdown and the two nurses had kept Joseph from getting at the treaty for weeks. The first chance he had, Joseph had tried, and failed, to steal the treaty back. Holmes had kept Annie in the room so Joseph could not get at the treaty during the daytime. After she left, Joseph broke in and retrieved the treaty, but Holmes ambushed him, and boxed him for the papers. Winning the fight, Holmes allowed Joseph to flee, though he wired particulars to Inspector Forbes. Percy wonders if Joseph meant to kill him with the knife; Holmes does not know, but says he would not trust such a selfish man to show mercy.

==Commentary==
This is the longest of the short stories published in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; before Sherlock Holmes&#x27;s &quot;death&quot; in &quot;The Final Problem&quot;. As such, it was originally published in two parts.

This story contains the first reference to &quot;The Adventure of the Second Stain&quot;, which would not be published until around 11 years later, however, Watson&#x27;s account of the event in &quot;The Naval Treaty&quot; differs from the actual story.

In 1889, four years before the story was published, Britain enacted its first Official Secrets legislation. This was prompted by the case of Charles Thomas Marvin, a copying clerk at the Foreign Office who had in reality a position very similar to that of Phelps in the story; he was employed to make a copy of a secret treaty with Russia, and promptly disclosed its contents to the press. Marvin was arrested, but was released after it was found that he had committed no offence known to English law; the Official Secrets legislation was aimed at creating such an offence for future cases. The Marvin case got considerable public attention, and Conan Doyle likely knew of it.

==Publication history==
&quot;The Adventure of the Naval Treaty&quot; was published in the UK in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in October and November 1893, and in the US in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; (under the title &quot;The Naval Treaty&quot;) on 14 and 21 October 1893. It was also published in the US edition of the &quot;Strand&quot; one month after its UK publication. The story was published with eight illustrations by Sidney Paget in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in October 1893, and with seven illustrations by Paget in November 1893. In &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot;, &quot;The Naval Treaty&quot; was published with two illustrations by W. H. Hyde in the first part of the story, and with two other illustrations by Hyde in the second part. It was included in the short story collection &quot;The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, which was published in December 1893 in the UK and February 1894 in the US.

==Adaptations==

===Film and television===
One of the short films in the Sherlock Holmes Éclair film series (1912) was based on the story. In the short film, titled &quot;The Stolen Papers&quot;, Georges Tréville played Sherlock Holmes and Mr Moyse played Dr. Watson.

Another short film based on the story was released in 1922 as part of the Sherlock Holmes Stoll film series, with Eille Norwood as Sherlock Holmes and Hubert Willis as Dr. Watson.

The story was adapted for the 1968 BBC series with Peter Cushing. The episode is now lost.
The story was adapted as the 1984 episode &quot;The Naval Treaty&quot; from the first series of the Granada TV series &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, which stars Jeremy Brett.

&quot;The Great Game&quot; (2010), the third episode of the television series &quot;Sherlock&quot;, uses &quot;The Adventure of the Naval Treaty&quot; and &quot;The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans&quot; as inspiration, as both deal with the theft of government papers related to the navy.

&quot;Art in the Blood&quot; (2014), the 23rd episode of &quot;Elementary&quot;, is inspired by the story.

&quot;The Adventure of the One Hundred Tadpoles&quot;, a 2015 episode of the NHK puppetry television series &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;, is based on the story. In the episode, Holmes and Watson try to take back a stolen picture which was entered in an art competition. The theme of the competition is tadpoles because &quot;Tadpole&quot; was the nickname of Sir Percy Phelps, founder of Beeton School.

===Radio===

&quot;The Naval Treaty&quot; was adapted by Edith Meiser as an episode of the American radio series &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; with Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson. The episode aired on 19 January 1931. Another episode adapted from the story aired in August 1936 (with Gordon as Holmes and Harry West as Watson).

Meiser also adapted the story as a 1940 episode of the American radio series &quot;The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson. The story was also adapted as an episode titled &quot;The Case of the Stolen Naval Treaty&quot; that aired in 1947 (with John Stanley as Holmes and Alfred Shirley as Watson).

A radio dramatisation of &quot;The Naval Treaty&quot; aired on the BBC Home Service in 1952, as part of the 1952–1969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson. The production was adapted by Felix Felton. Another dramatisation, which was also adapted by Felton and starred Hobbs and Shelley with a different supporting cast, aired in 1957 on the Home Service. A different radio version of &quot;The Naval Treaty&quot; adapted by Michael Hardwick aired on the BBC Light Programme in 1960, with Hobbs and Shelley again playing Holmes and Watson respectively.

An adaptation of the story aired on BBC radio in 1978, starring Barry Foster as Holmes and David Buck as Watson.

The story was adapted as an episode of &quot;CBS Radio Mystery Theater&quot; titled &quot;The Naval Treaty&quot;. The episode, which featured Gordon Gould as Sherlock Holmes and Bernard Grant as Dr. Watson, first aired in April 1982.

&quot;The Naval Treaty&quot; was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 1992 by David Ashton as part of the 1989–1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson. It featured Patrick Malahide as Percy Phelps, Brett Usher as Lord Holdhurst, Norman Jones as Mr Tangey, and Petra Markham as Miss Tangey.

A 2014 episode of &quot;The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, a series on the American radio show &quot;Imagination Theatre&quot;, was adapted from the story, with John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson.

<text>Nea Kios () is a small town and former municipality in Argolis, Peloponnese, Greece. Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality Argos-Mykines, of which it is a municipal unit. The emblem of the town is Argo. The municipal unit has an area of 5.700 km2. It was founded by refugees from Cius in Bithynia after the expulsion of the Greeks from Asia Minor.
==Geography==

Nea Kios is situated in a plain on the coast of the Argolic Gulf, at the mouth of the rivers Inachos and Erasinos. The rivers&#x27; waters create marsh in the surrounding area. It is 4 km northwest of Myloi, 6 km south of Argos and 6 km northwest of Nafplio. It is considered the seaport of Argos. Near Nea Kios is the site of the ancient town of Temenium.

==History==
Nea Kios is the historical continuation of Cius of Asia Minor, a city of 15,000 residents built at the head of the gulf of Cius in Propontis, seat of the Metropolis of Nicaea and seaport of Bursa. Refugees of Cius, after the Asia Minor disaster of 1922, transferred to Kalamaria where they stayed few years before most of them move out for Argolis when they were given space to settle.

The establishment of Nea Kios started in 1926, following the actions of a special commission following the actions of a special committee set up in 1925, chaired by Christos Delis. The settlement began in 1927 and was recognized as a settlement in 1928.

==Historical population==
Since its establishment, the actual population of Nea Kios according to ELSTAT is:
==Culture==
Since 1982 a museum operates in Nea Kios, named Laskarideio Folklore Museum, which houses costumes and various items from Cius of Asia Minor. The name of the museum is a reference to &quot;Evristhenis Laskaridis&quot;, a doctor who published books on the history of Cius.

==Sports==
Two sport clubs are based at Nea Kios, A.C. Argonaftis Nea Kios (=&quot;&quot;Α.Ο. Αργοναύτης Νέας Κίου&quot;), established in 1933 and Nea Kios Sports Club (=&quot;Αθλητικός Όμιλος Νέας Κίου&quot;&quot;), established in 1979, which operates under Argonaftis.

==Town partnerships==
Nea Kios fosters partnerships with the following places:
* Meddersheim, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany
::The partnership agreement between Nea Kios and Meddersheim was read out by mayors Georgios Maninis (Nea Kios) and Tilo Krauß (Meddersheim) and signed amid much festivity on 15 July 2008 in Meddersheim.

==Early life==
Edith Bernstein was born on July 13, 1951, in Brooklyn, New York. She had a Conservative &quot;holiday Jewish&quot; upbringing.

==Career==
Conn made her debut as an actress in the 1960s. Her notable characters since the 1970s, when she first became prominent, include Laurie Robinson in &quot;You Light Up My Life&quot; (1977; Kasey Cisyk provided the character&#x27;s singing voice), Frenchy in the feature films &quot;Grease&quot; (1978) and &quot;Grease 2&quot; (1982), Helen on &quot;The Practice&quot; (1976–77), Denise Stevens Downey on &quot;Benson&quot; (1981–84), and Stacy Jones on &quot;Shining Time Station&quot; (1989–95). She later reprised her role as Shining Time Station manager in &quot;Thomas and the Magic Railroad&quot; (2000).

Conn provided the voice for Raggedy Ann in the animated feature &quot;Raggedy Ann &amp; Andy: A Musical Adventure&quot; (1977) directed by Richard Williams. She appeared as a celebrity guest on game shows like &quot;Match Game&quot;, &quot;The $20,000, $25,000, $50,000, and $100,000 Pyramids&quot;, &quot;Whew!&quot;, &quot;Chain Reaction&quot;, and &quot;Go&quot;.

As a theatre actress, she was involved with Broadway productions of Lost in Yonkers (1991), The Green Bird (2000), and Say Goodnight, Gracie (2002). In 2014 she performed in The Underpants in Hartford, Connecticut. She also starred in Dan Clancy&#x27;s play &quot;Middletown&quot; from 2019 until 2021.

In January 2016, she had a cameo as Vi in the &quot;&quot; television special on Fox, thus being the only actress to appear in all three screen adaptations of the franchise. In addition, she has appeared in numerous other roles on television.

In 2019, Conn was a contestant on the eleventh series of the British television series &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot;. At 67, she was the oldest person ever to compete on the show.

<doc id="1337608" wikidata="Q92772" url="?curid=1337608" title="Dan Ingalls">
<text>Daniel Henry Holmes Ingalls Jr. (born 1944) is a pioneer of object-oriented computer programming and the principal architect, designer and implementer of five generations of Smalltalk environments. He designed the bytecoded virtual machine that made Smalltalk practical in 1976. He also invented bit blit, the general-purpose graphical operation that underlies most bitmap computer graphics systems today, and pop-up menus. He designed the generalizations of BitBlt to arbitrary color depth, with built-in scaling, rotation, and anti-aliasing. He made major contributions to the Squeak version of Smalltalk, including the original concept of a Smalltalk written in itself and made portable and efficient by a Smalltalk-to-C translator.

==Education==
Ingalls received his Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in physics from Harvard University, and his Master of Science (M.S.) in electrical engineering from Stanford University. While working toward a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) at Stanford, he started a company to sell a software measurement invention that he perfected, and never returned to academia.

==Work==
Ingalls&#x27; first well known research was at Xerox PARC, where he began a lifelong research association with Alan Kay, and did his award-winning work on Smalltalk. As Peter Siebel wrote about Dan in his book Coders at Work, Reflections on the Craft of Programming, &quot;If Alan Kay is Smalltalk&#x27;s father, Dan Ingalls is its mother—Smalltalk may have started as a gleam in Alan Kay&#x27;s eye, but Ingalls is the one who did the hard work of bringing it into the world. Starting with the first implementation of Smalltalk, written in BASIC and based on one page of notes from Kay, Ingalls has been involved in implementing seven generations of Smalltalk from the first prototype to the present-day open source implementation, Squeak.&quot; Dan&#x27;s design principles for Smalltalk included the important concepts of personal mastery, good design in a uniform framework, language for communication, interaction of language, the concept of &quot;objects&quot;, storage management, messages, and other principles outlined in his Byte Magazine article in 1981, &quot;Design Principles of Smalltalk&quot;.

In 2020, Ingalls wrote The Evolution of Smalltalk for the ACM HOPL Conference, ACM Program. Lang., Vol. 4, No. HOPL, Article 85. Publication date: June 2020, which details the design of Smalltalk through Ingalls&#x27;s multiple iterations of the language, including his development of Squeak in 1996. Although some may not be familiar with the language of Smalltalk or the fact that it began object orientation in programming, it is still a useful and well-used language.

Larry Tesler mentioned to Alan Kay and Dan Ingalls that he thought blocks of bits could be easily moved on the screen. Ingalls told Larry that he would learn how to program in the lowest-level microcode to harness all available power. Diana Merry had been working on programming text display, and after talking to her, Ingalls dug into the problem. Months later, he figured out a way to move information that was &quot;bit efficient.&quot;

&quot;The idea had come to him visually. When you are moving information on the display, whether it is scrolling or copying text or copying a graphical image from one place to another, you have a source and a destination within the computer&#x27;s memory. In his mind, he envisioned the concept as a wheel that rotated from the starting point to the end point. It was an idea that seemed obvious after Ingalls had conceived of it, and it has been copied widely by all of the graphical computing systems that have followed. Today it remains at the heart of both the Macintosh and Windows computing worlds. In the early 1970s, however, it was a radically new idea. Called Bit Blit, it enabled graphical menu systems to &quot;pop-up&quot; instantly on an Alto screen in response to a mouse click. As much as any single software innovation, Bit Blit made the modern graphical computer interface possible.&quot;

Ingalls moved to Apple Inc. He left research in 1987, for a time to run the family business, the Homestead Resort, in Hot Springs, Virginia. The Ingalls family owned and operated the Homestead Resort for 100 years.

Ingalls returned to Silicon Valley in 1995, first working at Interval Research Corporation, and then returned to Apple. Starting at Xerox, and then at Apple, he developed Fabrik, a visual programming language and integrated development environment (IDE), consisting of a kit of computing and user interface components that can be &quot;wired&quot; together to build new components and useful application software.

Then he moved to Hewlett-Packard Labs, where he developed a module architecture for Squeak. He also started a small firm, Weather Dimensions, Inc., which displays local weather data on home computers.

Ingalls then worked as a Distinguished Engineer at Sun Microsystems, where he worked in the Sun Microsystems Laboratories (Sun Labs) research wing. His latest project is a JavaScript environment named Lively Kernel, which allows live, interactive Web programming and objects from inside Web browsers.

While best known for his work on Smalltalk, Ingalls is also known for developing an optical character recognition system for Devanagari writing, which he did in collaboration with his father, Daniel H. H. Ingalls, Sr., a professor of Sanskrit.

Ingalls moved to SAP SE Palo Alto Research Center, as a fellow. He was a key member of the chief scientist team guiding the company&#x27;s technology vision, direction, and execution. He moved his research group to YCombinator, to a newly formed YCombinator Research Group, YCR, where he continued his research, living near the beach in Rio del Mar, Aptos, California with his wife Cathleen Galas, where he also contributed to development of the Squeak implementation of Smalltalk, JavaScript research, and the Lively Kernel Project, which now resides at the Hasso Plattner Institute.

Ingalls now consults and lives near the beach in Manhattan Beach, California, with his wife, Cathleen Galas.

==Awards==
In 1984, Ingalls received the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Grace Murray Hopper Award for Outstanding Young Scientist, for his Xerox PARC research, including bit blit.

In 1987, with Alan Kay, and Adele Goldberg, he received the ACM Software System Award, for his work on Smalltalk, the first fully object oriented programming software system.

In 2002, he was co-recipient, with Adele Goldberg, of the Dr. Dobb&#x27;s Excellence in Programming award.

In 2022, Ingalls was made a Fellow of the Computer History Museum for creating, developing and building seven generations of the Smalltalk programming environment, and promoting object-oriented programming.

Also in 2022, Dan Ingalls received the Senior Dahl-Nygaard Prize at ECOOP for his impact on modern computing.

<text>Lívia Járóka (born 6 October 1974, in Tata) is a Hungarian politician. She is a Member of the European Parliament, first elected as part of the Fidesz list in 2004. Járóka is the second Romani (and the first Romani woman) ever elected to the European Parliament (after Juan de Dios Ramírez Heredia from Spain, who served from 1986 to 1999).

Járóka grew up in Sopron, a town near Hungary&#x27;s western border with Austria. Her father is ethnically Roma, her mother Hungarian. After getting an MA in sociology from the Warsaw campus of the Central European University on a scholarship from the Open Society Institute she went on to study anthropology in Britain, focusing on Romani issues and culture. In August 2003 she had a daughter and a son in 2007. In 2012 she finished her PhD in Social Anthropology at the University College London.

Járóka has been criticized as an apologist for the treatment of Hungarian Roma by her party, Fidesz. She has also declined to criticize Fidesz&#x27; campaign against George Soros, and the party&#x27;s attacks on her alma mater, the Central European University.

== Memberships ==
She is a member of the Committee on Women&#x27;s Rights and Gender Equality and the Delegation for Relations with South Africa. She is a substitute member of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, as well the Delegation for Relations with the Korean Peninsula.

In 2014 she retired as an MEP but returned on 15 September 2017 after Ildikó Gáll-Pelcz left the European Parliament. She was elected a Vice-President of the European Parliament on 15 November 2017. She was re-elected in that position on 3 July 2019. She served as Vice-President until 17 January 2022.

==Personal life==
She is married and has two children.

*Roma Education Fund
* High Level Group of Roma Diplomacy Program
*European Roma Information Office
* Prior Board Member of Open Society Institute, Roma Memorial University Scholarship Program

== Research activities ==

<text>Naglee Park is a historic residential neighborhood in San Jose, California, to the east of Downtown San Jose and San Jose State University.

==History==

Much of the Naglee Park neighborhood was developed on the grounds of the estate of Civil War Brigadier General Henry Morris Naglee. The Naglee estate was famous for its gardens and vineyards. In 1902, nearly 20 years after General Naglee&#x27;s death, the estate was subdivided to form the Naglee Park neighborhood. The Naglee Park Subdivision is bounded by E Santa Clara Street, E William Street, South 11th Street, and Coyote Creek. Many of the homes were constructed in the early 1900s, but few date from before 1906 because of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. These houses were built for many early Santa Clara Valley professionals and are historically significant. The Naglee Terrace Subdivision is bounded by East William Street, East Margaret Street, Coyote Creek (William Street Park), and South 11th Street.

In 1958 a group of property owners were successful in changing the neighborhood zoning to allow multifamily development. Attempts had started in the 1940s with residents who were leaving the area and felt they could get better prices with less restrictive zoning. After San Jose State began to allow students to live off campus, in 1968, students moved into the area. About 70% of board and care facilities for mentally disabled people moved into the neighborhood, after changes to state policies, because of low prices in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Banks redlined the area until 1973 when the neighborhood association convinced the city to not deposit money in particular banks until they began lending in the area again. The neighborhood was zoned back into single-family homes in 1978 at the request of neighborhood residents.

In the 1950s through 1970s, the neighborhood was heavily impacted by growth of the University and downtown. Many of the larger homes were converted into apartments or board and care facilities.

The Campus Community Association (CCA) is the active neighborhood association in Naglee Park. The CCA sponsors neighborhood events such as Bark in the Park, the 4th of July parade and block party, and Christmas social.

==Geography==
The general boundaries of the neighborhood are Santa Clara Street, 11th Street, Interstate 280, and Coyote Creek. The local high school is San Jose High School.

<text>ST Review was a computer magazine in the United Kingdom covering the Atari ST during the early to mid 1990s. Published by EMAP and launched in May 1992 and placed at the &quot;serious end&quot; of the market, it catered to ST users who wished to use their ST for a variety of productive uses, such as its MIDI capabilities, programming or word processing, as opposed to casual gaming. The title was sold to Europress after EMAP decided to close it due to lower-than-expected sales and it ran for another two years with freelance Editor Vic Lennard, full-time Deputy Editor Tony Kaye, and a full-time designer. This three-person team, along with freelance contributors, kept the magazine popular for almost two years before it finally succumbed to falling sales and the lack of success of Atari&#x27;s Falcon, the expected replacement of the ST. This was due in part to the increasing PC market.

The magazine was eventually sold to Future Publishing, producers of rival &quot;ST Format&quot;. The last issue was published in January 1995.

Like many similar magazines, it contained sections of news, game reviews, previews, tips, help guides, columnists, reader&#x27;s letters, and cover-mounted disks of software.

<text>The Rhodocyclaceae are a family of gram-negative bacteria. They are given their own order in the beta subgroup of Pseudomonadota, and include many genera previously assigned to the family &quot;Pseudomonadaceae&quot;.

The family was revised in 2017 with the creation of other families within the order &quot;Rhodocyclales&quot;, and the family now contains the genera:
*&quot;Rhodocyclus&quot; (type genus) species can grow photoheterotrophically or photoautotrophically (using molecular hydrogen as their electron donor) under anoxia or heterotrophically on fatty acids under air. Dominant respiratory quinone is . Cells are curved rods or rings.
*&quot;Propionivibrio&quot; species grow anaerobically by fermentation of hydrocarbons, yielding fatty acids, specifically propionate. The dominant respiratory quinone is ubiquinone-8. Cells are curved rods.
*&quot;Azospira&quot; species are heterotrophs that can fix molecular nitrogen (i.e. are diazotrophic) as their source of nitrogen for growth. Cells are spirillae or curved rods. The dominant respiratory quinone is ubiquinone-8.

<doc id="1337680" wikidata="Q2042919" url="?curid=1337680" title="The Adventure of the Dancing Men">
<text>&quot;The Adventure of the Dancing Men&quot; is a Sherlock Holmes story written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle as one of 13 stories in the cycle published as &quot;The Return of Sherlock Holmes&quot; in 1905. It was first published in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in the United Kingdom in December 1903, and in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; in the United States on 5 December 1903.

Conan Doyle ranked &quot;The Adventure of the Dancing Men&quot; third in his list of his twelve favourite Holmes stories. This is one of only two Sherlock Holmes short stories where Holmes&#x27; client dies after seeking his help. Holmes&#x27;s solution to the riddle of the dancing men rests on reasoning that closely resembles that of Legrand in Poe&#x27;s &quot;The Gold Bug.&quot;

The original title was &quot;The Dancing Men,&quot; when it was published as a short story in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in December 1903.

==Plot==
The story begins when Hilton Cubitt of Ridling Thorpe Manor in Norfolk visits Sherlock Holmes and gives him a piece of paper with the following mysterious sequence of stick figures.

Cubitt explains to Holmes and Dr. Watson that he has recently married an American woman named Elsie Patrick. Before the wedding, she had asked her husband-to-be never to ask about her past, as she had had some &quot;very disagreeable associations&quot; in her life, although she said that there was nothing that she was personally ashamed of. Their marriage had been a happy one until the messages began to arrive, first mailed from the United States and then appearing in the garden.

The messages had made Elsie very afraid but she did not explain the reasons for her fear, and Cubitt insisted on honouring his promise not to ask about Elsie&#x27;s life in the United States. Holmes examines all of the occurrences of the dancing figures, and they provide him with an important clue—he realises that they form a substitution cipher and cracks the code by frequency analysis. The last of the messages causes Holmes to fear that the Cubitts are in immediate danger.

Holmes rushes to Riding Thorpe Manor and finds Cubitt dead of a bullet to the heart and his wife gravely wounded from a gunshot to the head. Inspector Martin of the Norfolk Constabulary believes that it is a murder-suicide attempt; Elsie is the prime suspect. But Holmes, after noting some inconsistencies in that theory, proves that there is a third person involved.

Holmes writes a message—in dancing figure characters—and has it delivered to a lodger named Abe Slaney, another American at a nearby farm. While waiting for the result of this message, Holmes explains to Watson and Inspector Martin how he cracked the code of the dancing figures. In his explanation, Holmes discusses what happened after he cracked the third message. He telegrammed a friend in the New York Police named Wilson Hargreave asking about Slaney, whose name was in the first message, and Hargreave replied to tell Holmes that Slaney was a deadly criminal from Chicago.

The last message, which caused Holmes and Watson to rush to Norfolk, read &quot;ELSIE PREPARE TO MEET THY GOD&quot;.

Slaney, unaware that Elsie is gravely wounded, arrives at Ridling Thorpe Manor and is seized as he comes through the door. Holmes had sent for Slaney using the dancing men, knowing that Slaney would believe the message is from Elsie. Slaney reveals that he had been engaged to Elsie, the daughter of the Chicago crime boss whom Slaney works for, and that she had fled to escape her old life. Slaney had come to England to get her back. When Slaney and Elsie were speaking through a window, Cubitt had appeared and shots were exchanged; Cubitt was killed and Slaney had fled. Apparently, Elsie then shot herself. Slaney is arrested and sentenced to hang, but his sentence is reduced to penal servitude because Cubitt had fired the first shot. Elsie recovers from her injuries, and spends her life helping the poor and administering her late husband&#x27;s estate.

==Publication history==
The story was published in the UK in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in December 1903, and in the US in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; on 5 December 1903. It was published with seven illustrations by Sidney Paget in the &quot;Strand&quot;, and with six illustrations by Frederic Dorr Steele in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;. It was included in the short story collection &quot;The Return of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, which was published in the US in February 1905 and in the UK in March 1905.

==Substitution cipher==
The mysterious sequence of stick men is a simple substitution cipher; that is, each stick man represents a given letter of the alphabet.

The above-mentioned fifth and final message that decodes as &quot;ELSIE PREPARE TO MEET THY GOD&quot; looks like this:

Note how the first stick man repeats in the 5th, 8th, and 12th position: it represents the &quot;e&quot; twice present in the words &quot;Elsie&quot; and &quot;prepare&quot;. The first and second time the stick man carries a flag – this denotes the end of a word – both words end with an &quot;e&quot;.

==Adaptations==
===Film and television===
* Eille Norwood starred as Holmes in a 1923 short film adapted from the story as part of the Stoll film series.
* The 1943 film &quot;Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon&quot;, starring Basil Rathbone as Holmes, is credited as an adaptation of &quot;The Dancing Men,&quot; but the only element of Doyle&#x27;s story to be used is the dancing men code. The plot involves Holmes and Professor Moriarty, in a World War II setting, racing to find the pieces of a new bomb sight.
* &quot;The Dancing Men&quot; was adapted for the second episode of the second season of the 1965–68 TV series &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; starring Peter Cushing as Holmes.
* &quot;The Dancing Men&quot; was adapted for the second episode of the 1984 TV series &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; starring Jeremy Brett. In this adaptation, the location of Ridling Thorpe Manor is moved from Norfolk to Derbyshire.
* &quot;The Dancing Men&quot; inspired the eleventh episode of the 1999 animated TV series &quot;Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century&quot;.
* &quot;The Adventure of Henry Baskerville and a Dog&quot;, an episode of the NHK puppetry television series &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; is based on &quot;Hound of the Baskervilles&quot; and &quot;The Dancing Men&quot;. In it, Holmes deciphers the code found in the school in parallel with investigating the real figure of &quot;Monster Dog&quot;.
* In the BBC television series &quot;Sherlock&quot;:
** &quot;The Dancing Men&quot; inspired the second episode of series 1, entitled &quot;The Blind Banker&quot;, where ciphers are a prominent feature.
** &quot;The Dancing Men&quot; case itself is directly portrayed at the end of the third and final episode of series 4, entitled &quot;The Final Problem&quot;, where the identical &quot;AM HERE ABE SLANEY&quot; cipher is shown.
* In the 2018 movie &quot;&quot;, Bruce, while preparing to escape prison, smuggles out a note written in the Dancing Men code. While containing mistakes, it appears to be a legitimate message asking Alfred to prepare his gear and transport.

===Radio===

* A radio adaptation aired as an episode of the American radio series &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. The episode was adapted by Edith Meiser and aired on 20 April 1931, with Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson. A remake of the script aired on 9 May 1936 (with Gordon as Holmes and Harry West as Watson).
* Edith Meiser also adapted the story as an episode of the American radio series &quot;The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson, that aired on 1 December 1940.
* Michael Hardwick adapted the story as a radio adaptation which aired on BBC Radio 2 in June 1969 as part of the 1952–1969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson, with John Bentley as Abe Slaney. 
* &quot;The Dancing Men&quot; was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 1993 by Bert Coules as part of the 1989–1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson. It featured Peter Tuddenham as Inspector Martin and Christopher Good as Hilton Cubitt.
* The story was adapted as a 2007 episode of &quot;The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, a series on the American radio show &quot;Imagination Theatre&quot;, starring John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson, with Stephan Weyte as Hilton Cubitt and Frank Buxton as Inspector Martin.
* &quot;The Dancing Men&quot; was adapted in a 3-part episode of &quot;Sherlock &amp; Co.&quot;, a modern-day podcast retelling of the original Sherlock Holmes stories, starring Paul Waggott as John Hamish Watson, Harry Attwell as Sherlock Holmes, and Marta da Silva as Mariana Ametxazurra. 

===Books===
The Hong Kong children&#x27;s book series &quot;The Great Detective Sherlock Holmes&quot; has a version of this story, titled &quot;The Dancing Code&quot; (解碼緝兇). It is book #45 in the original Chinese language series, and in the English translation, done by Maria Kan, it is book #16. The story is set in Hong Kong, and Elsie, renamed Elsie Lee, is Chinese American in this version.

<text>Trường Đình Trần (January 5, 1932 – May 6, 2012), was a Vietnamese-American businessman and hotelier. Starting in the 1970s, Tran owned several New York City hotels that became noted for their problems with crime, building safety, and cleanliness.

==Life in Vietnam==
Tran was born in Hà Tĩnh province in north-central Vietnam to a Roman Catholic family. He married Ngu Thi in 1950 and had four children with her. Sometime after 1954, Tran and his father were imprisoned by North Vietnamese authorities for two years. After his release, he moved to South Vietnam and had children with four other women.

Tran was the principal owner of the Vishipco Line, the largest shipping company in South Vietnam in the 1970s. As a shipowner, he earned millions of dollars hauling cargo for the United States military. His actions during the last day of the Fall of Saigon have been the subject of debate. Tran stated that he used his company&#x27;s resources, including 24 commercial ships and hundreds of trucks, to aid in the evacuation of thousands of South Vietnamese civilians and military personnel to escape from Vietnam. He let his ships, inclusive the &quot;Truong Xuan&quot; (with Captain Pham Ngoc Luy) carried free more than 3,000 Vietnamese fleeing Saigon after the Communist invasion. He claimed that his ships also helped evacuate thousands of American military personnel and civilians; Richard Armitage, the American official who oversaw the U.S. naval evacuation, disputed this as false because all U.S. military personnel had already evacuated and American civilians did not evacuate on merchant ships.

Tran left Vietnam on April 30, 1975, the day that Saigon fell to the communists. Tran boarded one of his eleven ships and traveled to the United States with two suitcases of gold.

==Hotel business==
He began his hotel business in New York City in 1975, first with the Hotel Opera single-room occupancy on the Upper West Side in Manhattan. He later took over Midtown&#x27;s Hotel Carter in 1977, which went on to develop a reputation as America&#x27;s &quot;dirtiest hotel&quot;. Tran purchased the Hotel Kenmore on 23rd Street in 1985 for $7.9 million. The hotel was seized from Tran by the US Marshals Service in 1994 because of deplorable conditions and rampant drug crime within the building; this was the largest federal seizure of property related to drug charges in U.S. history. In 1988, he purchased the Times Square Hotel; the hotel was seized by the city in January 1990 for its numerous safety code violations. He also owned the Hotel Lafayette in Buffalo, New York.

==Personal life==
After the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States he contributed $2 million of his personal funds to the American Red Cross Disaster Relief Fund and in 2003, the Asian American Federation honored his actions. In 1984 during the famine in Ethiopia, he also purchased two helicopters valued at around 3.2 million dollars for the hunger relief organization in Ethiopia. In August 2005, he donated $100,000 to the victims of Hurricane Katrina.

Tran regularly attended mass at Holy Cross Church. In May 2004, he was awarded a Golden Torch Award, by the Vietnamese American National Gala in Washington, D.C. Mr. Tran was also on the Board of Directors of The United Way of New York City.

In 2007, Tran began to suffer from cardiovascular disease. He died on May 6, 2012.

Tran&#x27;s complex family life led to a protracted legal battle over his $100 million estate.

<text>The Secret History of the Mongols (Mongolian: , Khalkha Mongolian: , ) is the oldest surviving literary work in the Mongolian language. Written for the Mongol royal family some time after the death of Genghis Khan in 1227, it recounts his life and conquests, and partially the reign of his successor Ögedei Khan.

The author is unknown and wrote in the Middle Mongol language using Mongolian script. The date of the text is uncertain, as the colophon to the text describes the book as having been finished in the Year of the Mouse, on the banks of the Kherlen River at Khodoe Aral, corresponding to an earliest possible figure of 1228.

While the &quot;Secret History&quot; was preserved in part as the basis for a number of chronicles such as the &quot;Jami&#x27; al-tawarikh&quot;, &quot;Shengwu qinzheng lu&quot;, and &quot;Altan Tobchi&quot;, the full Mongolian body only survived from a version made around the 1400s at the start of the Ming dynasty, where the pronunciation was transcribed into Chinese characters as a tool to help interpreters under the title &quot;The Secret History of the Yuan Dynasty&quot; (). About two-thirds of the &quot;Secret History&quot; also appear in slightly different versions in the 17th-century Mongolian chronicle &quot;Altan Tobchi&quot; () by Lubsang-Danzin.

The &quot;Secret History&quot; is regarded as the single most significant native Mongolian account of Genghis Khan. Linguistically, it provides the richest source of pre-Classical Mongol and Middle Mongol. The &quot;Secret History&quot; is regarded as a piece of classic literature in both Mongolia and the rest of the world, and has been translated into more than 40 languages.

== Content ==
The work begins with a semi-mythical genealogy of Genghis Khan, born Temüjin. According to legend, a blue-grey wolf and a fallow doe begat the first Mongol, named Batachiqan. Eleven generations after Batachiqan, a widow named Alan Gua was abandoned by her in-laws and left with her two boys Bügünütei and Belgünütei. She then bore three more sons with a supernatural glowing man who came in through the smoke-hole at the top of the ger. The youngest of Alan Gua&#x27;s three divinely-born children was Bodonchar, founder of the Borjigin. The description of Temüjin&#x27;s life begins with the kidnapping of his mother, Hoelun, by his father Yesügei. It then covers Temüjin&#x27;s early life following his birth around 1160; the difficult times after the murder of his father; and the many conflicts against him, wars, and plots before he gains the title of Genghis Khan in 1206. The latter parts of the work deal with the campaigns of conquest of Genghis and his third son Ögedei throughout Eurasia; the text ends with Ögedei&#x27;s reflections on what he did well and what he did wrong.

== Value ==

Scholars of Mongolian history consider the text hugely important for the wealth of information it contains on the ethnography, language, literature and varied aspects of the Mongol culture. In terms of its value to the field of linguistic studies, it is considered unique among the Mongol texts as an example free from the influence of Buddhism prevalent in later texts. It is especially valued for its vivid and realistic depictions of daily tribal life and organization of Mongol civilization in the 12th and 13th centuries, complementing other primary sources available in the Persian and Chinese languages.

Its value as a historically accurate source is more controversial: whereas some experts, such as René Grousset, assess it positively in this regard as well, others, such as Igor de Rachewiltz, believe that the value of the source lies primarily in its &quot;faithful description of Mongol tribal life&quot;, and Arthur Waley considered the &quot;Secret History&#x27;s&quot; &quot;historical value almost nil&quot;.

In 2004 the Government of Mongolia decreed that a copy of &quot;The Secret History of the Mongols&quot; covered with golden plates was to be located to the rear part of the Government Palace in Ulaanbaatar.

== Scholarship ==

The &quot;Secret History&quot; ends with a colophon stating its original date of completion at Khodoe Aral:

The original text corresponding to this date has not survived to the present day. The Year of the Rat in question has been conjectured to be 1228 (Cleaves, Onon), 1229 (Rachewiltz), 1240, 1252 (Atwood), and 1264 (Hung). Proponents of the earlier dates argue that portions of the work whose events post-date the Year of the Rat were added at a later date. This is however disputed by some including Atwood, arguing that thematic elements and chronology posits that the text was always intended to lead up to, and including, the reign of Ögedei Khan. The month of the Roebuck corresponds to the seventh lunar month, i.e. middle of summer.

Some scholars beginning with have argued that this original work was shorter and titled The Origin of Chinggis Khan (&quot;Chinggis Qan-u ujaɣur&quot;) – corresponding to the first words of the text.

The common name of the work as it is referred to today is The Secret History of the Mongols, corresponding to the edited work compiled in the late 1300s with the Chinese title Secret History of the Yuan () and the Mongolian title Mongɣol-un niɣuča tobčiyan, re-transcribed from Chinese (—the is not included in the Chinese-transcribed titles of the copies known today, but that may be the result of a corruption).

This title was altered to Secret History of the Yuan Dynasty () when it was included as part of the Yongle Encyclopedia. While modern definitive versions are all based on these Ming-era copies, various partial copies of the text have been found in Mongolia and Tibet (Tholing Monastery). The most notable of these is the &quot;Altan Tobchi&quot; (), an expanded Mongolian Buddhist-influenced narrative written in 1651 and discovered in 1926 that contains two-thirds of the &quot;Secret History&quot; verbatim.

=== Hanlin Academy text ===

The Ming-era text was compiled at the Hanlin Academy as an aid to help interpreters learn Mongolian, consisting of three parts: a transcription of the Mongolian pronunciation in Chinese characters; an interlinear gloss in Chinese; and a running, often abridged translation into Chinese. Due to this work&#x27;s compilation almost a century after the original, it has been noted that the Mongolian transcriptions would likely reflect the pronunciation of the then-Mongols in Beijing, rather than the original Middle Mongol of Genghis Khan&#x27;s era. This text, divided according to length into 12 parts and 282 sections, was eventually folded into the &quot;Yongle Encyclopedia&quot; as a 15-part work in 1408. The original 12-part work was also published around 1410 in Beijing. After the fall of the Ming and rise of the Qing dynasty these texts began to be copied and disseminated. The oldest dated full copy is of the 12-part version in 1805 by (1766–1835), kept in the National Library of China. A copy of the 15-part version was made by (1728–1814) around the same time, and this copy is kept by Saint Petersburg State University. A version based on the 1805 text was published in 1908 by Ye Dehui, with subsequent scholarship collating this and other partial copies of the &quot;Secret History of the Yuan Dynasty&quot; to high accuracy.

=== Altan Tobchi ===
After the disintegration of the Mongol Empire, the Mongols retreated to form the Northern Yuan, and a cult of worship formed around the image of Genghis Khan as a supernatural being amidst a decline in literacy. This resulted in works such as the &quot;Chinggis Qaan-u Altan Tobchi&quot; () containing an apocryphal image of the Khan that replaced the semi-historical narrative of the &quot;Secret History&quot;. Starting in the late 16th century, Tibetan Buddhism gained a foothold amongst the Mongols, and an increase in literacy resulted in a new &quot;Altan Tobchi&quot; being created by an unknown author in the 1620s. This &quot;Altan Tobchi&quot; included the earlier parts of the Secret History and combines it with the earlier apocryphal legend cycle. In 1651, the monk Lubsang-Danzin expanded this narrative (now usually called the &quot;Lu Altan Tobchi&quot; after the author) and included a full two-thirds of the &quot;Secret History&quot;. This was discovered in 1926 by from Dornod, as part of the academic and cultural revival in the Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic.

== Translations ==
The &quot;Secret History&quot; has been translated into over 40 languages.
In foreign scholarship, Russian monk and sinologist Palladius was the first to offer a translation of the abridged Chinese running translation in 1866 while serving as the head of the Russian Orthodox mission in Beijing. Using Bao Tingbo&#x27;s copy, he also attempted an unpublished transcription of the phonetic Mongolian in 1872–78. Japanese historian Naka Michiyo published a translation in 1907. The first reconstructions of the Mongolian text were done by the German sinologist Erich Haenisch in 1937, with a translation published in 1941 (second edition 1948). Russian scholar Sergei Kozin published a separate reconstruction and translation in 1941, while French scholar Paul Pelliot worked on a full reconstruction and translation into French that was published posthumously in 1949. The latter two scholars had access to the &quot;Lu Altan Tobchi&quot; as a contributing source. B. I. Pankratov published a translation into Russian in 1962.

=== Mongolian ===

 (1875–1932) was the first native Mongolian scholar to attempt a reconstruction of &quot;The Secret History&quot;, in 1915–17, though it was only published posthumously in 1996. Tsengde&#x27;s son Eldengtei and grandson Ardajab continued this work and published a translation in 1980 in Hohhot.

The Inner Mongolian authors Altan-Ochir and Bokekeshig independently published reconstructions of the text in Kailu in 1941 as part of the national revival in Mengjiang. The most influential adaptation of the work into modern Mongolian was completed by Tsendiin Damdinsüren in 1947 using Mongolian script, a subsequent version in Mongolian Cyrillic was published in 1957 and is considered a classic of modern Mongolian literature.

=== English ===
In the English language Arthur Waley was the first to publish a translation of the &quot;Secret History&quot;&#x27;s running Chinese, while the first full translation into English was in 1982 by Francis Woodman Cleaves, titled &quot;The Secret History of the Mongols: For the First Time Done into English out of the Original Tongue and Provided with an Exegetical Commentary&quot;. The archaic language adopted by Cleaves was not satisfying to all and, between 1972 and 1985, Igor de Rachewiltz published a fresh translation in eleven volumes of the series Papers on Far Eastern History accompanied by extensive footnotes commenting not only on the translation but also various aspects of Mongolian culture, which was published as a two-volume set in 2003. In 2015 this was republished as an open access version omitting the extensive footnotes of the original. The Daur Mongol scholar Urgunge Onon published the first translation into English by a native Mongolian in 1990, based on a 1980 Inner Mongolian version by Eldengtei. This was republished as &quot;The Secret History of the Mongols: The Life and Times of Chinggis Khan&quot; in 2001. A further English translation by Christopher P. Atwood appeared in 2023.

<text>The theory of the firm consists of a number of economic theories that explain and predict the nature of the firm, company, or corporation, including its existence, behaviour, structure, and relationship to the market. Firms are key drivers in economics, providing goods and services in return for monetary payments and rewards. Organisational structure, incentives, employee productivity, and information all influence the successful operation of a firm in the economy and within itself. As such major economic theories such as transaction cost theory, managerial economics and behavioural theory of the firm will allow for an in-depth analysis on various firm and management types.

==Overview==
In simplified terms, the theory of the firm aims to answer these questions:
# Existence. Why do firms emerge? Why are not all transactions in the economy mediated over the market?
# Boundaries. Why is the boundary between firms and the market located exactly there in relation to size and output variety? Which transactions are performed internally and which are negotiated on the market?
# Organization. Why are firms structured in such a specific way, for example as to hierarchy or decentralization? What is the interplay of formal and informal relationships?
# Heterogeneity of firm actions/performances. What drives different actions and performances of firms?
# Evidence. What tests are there for the respective theories of the firm?

Firms exist as an alternative system to the market-price mechanism when it is more efficient to produce in a non-market environment. For example, in a labor market, it might be very difficult or costly for firms or organizations to engage in production when they have to hire and fire their workers depending on demand/supply conditions. It might also be costly for employees to shift companies every day looking for better alternatives. Similarly, it may be costly for companies to find new suppliers daily. Thus, firms engage in a long-term contract with their employees or a long-term contract with suppliers to minimize the cost or maximize the value of property rights.

==Background==
The First World War period saw a change of emphasis in economic theory away from industry-level analysis which mainly included analyzing markets to analysis at the level of the firm, as it became increasingly clear that perfect competition was no longer an adequate model of how firms behaved. Economic theory until then had focused on trying to understand markets alone and there had been little study on understanding why firms or organisations exist. Markets are guided by prices and quality as illustrated by vegetable markets where a buyer is free to switch sellers in an exchange. The need for a revised theory of the firm was emphasized by empirical studies by Adolf Berle and Gardiner Means, who made it clear that ownership of a typical American corporation is spread over a wide number of shareholders, leaving control in the hands of managers who own very little equity themselves. R. L. Hall and Charles J. Hitch found that executives made decisions by rule of thumb rather than in the marginalist way.

==Transaction cost theory==

According to Ronald Coase&#x27;s essay &quot;The Nature of the Firm&quot;, people begin to organise their production in firms when the transaction cost of coordinating production through the market exchange, given imperfect information, is greater than within the firm.

Ronald Coase set out his transaction cost theory of the firm in 1937, making it one of the first (neo-classical) attempts to define the firm theoretically in relation to the market. One aspect of its &#x27;neoclassicism&#x27; lies in presenting an explanation of the firm consistent with constant returns to scale, rather than relying on increasing returns to scale. Another is in defining a firm in a manner which is both realistic and compatible with the idea of substitution at the margin, so instruments of conventional economic analysis apply. He notes that a firm&#x27;s interactions with the market may not be under its control (for instance because of sales taxes), but its internal allocation of resources are: “Within a firm, … market transactions are eliminated and in place of the complicated market structure with exchange transactions is substituted the entrepreneur … who directs production.” He asks why alternative methods of production (such as the price mechanism and economic planning), could not either achieve all production, so that either firms use internal prices for all their production, or one big firm runs the entire economy. 

Coase begins from the standpoint that markets could in theory carry out all production and that what needs to be explained is the existence of the firm, with its &quot;distinguishing mark … [of] the supersession of the price mechanism.&quot; Coase identifies some reasons why firms might arise, and dismisses each as unimportant:

# if some people prefer to work under the direction and are prepared to pay for the privilege (but this is unlikely);
# if some people prefer to direct others and are prepared to pay for this (but generally people are paid more to direct others);
# if purchasers prefer goods produced by firms.

Instead, for Coase the main reason to establish a firm is to avoid some of the transaction costs of using the price mechanism. These include discovering relevant prices (which can be reduced but not eliminated by purchasing this information through specialists), as well as the costs of negotiating and writing enforceable contracts for each transaction (which can be large if there is uncertainty). Moreover, contracts in an uncertain world will necessarily be incomplete and have to be frequently re-negotiated. The costs of haggling about the division of surplus, particularly if there is asymmetric information and asset specificity, may be considerable. 

If a firm operated internally under the market system, many contracts would be required (for instance, even for procuring a pen or delivering a presentation). In contrast, a real firm has very few (though much more complex) contracts, such as defining a manager&#x27;s power of direction over employees, in exchange for which the employee is paid. These kinds of contracts are drawn up in situations of uncertainty, in particular for relationships that last over long periods of time. Such a situation runs counter to neo-classical economic theory. The neo-classical market is instantaneous, forbidding the development of extended agent-principal (employee-manager) relationships, planning, and of trust. Coase concludes that “a firm is likely therefore to emerge in those cases where a very short-term contract would be unsatisfactory”, and that “it seems improbable that a firm would emerge without the existence of uncertainty”.

He notes that government measures relating to the market (sales taxes, rationing, price controls) tend to increase the size of firms, since firms internally would not be subject to such transaction costs. Thus, Coase defines the firm as &quot;the system of relationships which comes into existence when the direction of resources is dependent on the entrepreneur.&quot; We can therefore think of a firm as getting larger or smaller based on whether the entrepreneur organises more or fewer transactions.

The question then arises of what determines the size of the firm; why does the entrepreneur organise the transactions he does, why no more or less? Since the reason for the firm&#x27;s being is to have lower costs than the market, the upper limit on the firm&#x27;s size is set by costs rising to the point where internalising an additional transaction equals the cost of making that transaction in the market. (At the lower limit, the firm&#x27;s costs exceed the market&#x27;s costs, and it does not come into existence.) In practice, diminishing returns to management contribute most to raising the costs of organising a large firm, particularly in large firms with many different plants and differing internal transactions (such as a conglomerate), or if the relevant prices change frequently.

Coase concludes by saying that the size of the firm is dependent on the costs of using the price mechanism, and on the costs of organisation of other entrepreneurs. These two factors together determine how many products a firm produces and how much of each.

=== Reconsiderations of transaction cost theory ===
According to Louis Putterman, most economists accept distinction between intra-firm and interfirm transaction but also that the two shade into each other; the extent of a firm is not simply defined by its capital stock. George Barclay Richardson for example, notes that a rigid distinction fails because of the existence of intermediate forms between firm and market such as inter-firm co-operation.

Klein (1983) asserts that “Economists now recognise that such a sharp distinction does not exist and that it is useful to consider also transactions occurring within the firm as representing market (contractual) relationships.” The costs involved in such transactions that are within a firm or even between the firms are the transaction costs.

Ultimately, whether the firm constitutes a domain of bureaucratic direction that is shielded from market forces or simply “a legal fiction”, “a nexus for a set of contracting relationships among individuals” (as Jensen and Meckling put it) is “a function of the completeness of markets and the ability of market forces to penetrate intra-firm relationships”.

==Managerial and behavioural theories==
It was only in the 1960s that the neo-classical theory of the firm was seriously challenged by alternatives such as managerial and behavioral theories. Managerial theories of the firm, as developed by William Baumol (1959 and 1962), Robin Marris (1964) and Oliver E. Williamson (1966), suggest that managers would seek to maximise their own utility and consider the implications of this for firm behavior in contrast to the profit-maximising case. (Baumol suggested that managers’ interests are best served by maximising sales after achieving a minimum level of profit which satisfies shareholders.) More recently this has developed into ‘principal–agent’ analysis (e.g., Spence and Zeckhauser and Ross (1973) on problems of contracting with asymmetric information) which models a widely applicable case where a principal (a shareholder or firm for example) cannot costlessly infer how an agent (a manager or supplier, say) is behaving. This may arise either because the agent has greater expertise or knowledge than the principal, or because the principal cannot directly observe the agent&#x27;s actions; it is asymmetric information that leads to a problem of moral hazard. This means that to an extent managers can pursue their own interests. Traditional managerial models typically assume that managers, instead of maximising profit, maximise a simple objective utility function (this may include salary, perks, security, power, prestige) subject to an arbitrarily given profit constraint (profit satisficing).

===Behavioural approach===

The behavioural approach, as developed in particular by Richard Cyert and James G. March of the Carnegie School places emphasis on explaining how decisions are taken within the firm, and goes well beyond neoclassical economics. Much of this depended on Herbert A. Simon&#x27;s work in the 1950s concerning behaviour in situations of uncertainty, which argued that “people possess limited cognitive ability and so can exercise only ‘bounded rationality’ when making decisions in complex, uncertain situations”. Thus individuals and groups tend to &quot;satisfice&quot;—that is, to attempt to attain realistic goals, rather than maximize a utility or profit function. Cyert and March argued that the firm cannot be regarded as a monolith, because different individuals and groups within it have their own aspirations and conflicting interests, and that firm behaviour is the weighted outcome of these conflicts. Organisational mechanisms (such as &quot;satisficing&quot; and sequential decision-taking) exist to maintain conflict at levels that are not unacceptably detrimental. Compared to ideal state of productive efficiency, there is organisational slack (Leibenstein&#x27;s X-inefficiency).

===Team production===
Armen Alchian and Harold Demsetz&#x27;s analysis of team production extends and clarifies earlier work by Coase. Thus according to them the firm emerges because extra output is provided by team production, but the success of this depends on being able to manage the team so that metering problems (it is costly to measure the marginal outputs of the co-operating inputs for reward purposes) and attendant shirking (the moral hazard problem) can be overcome, by estimating marginal productivity by observing or specifying input behaviour. Such monitoring as is therefore necessary, however, can only be encouraged effectively if the monitor is the recipient of the activity&#x27;s residual income (otherwise the monitor herself would have to be monitored, ad infinitum). For Alchian and Demsetz, the firm, therefore, is an entity that brings together a team that is more productive working together than at arm&#x27;s length through the market, because of informational problems associated with monitoring of effort. In effect, therefore, this is a &quot;principal-agent&quot; theory, since it is asymmetric information within the firm which Alchian and Demsetz emphasise must be overcome. In Barzel (1982)’s theory of the firm, drawing on Jensen and Meckling (1976), the firm emerges as a means of centralising monitoring and thereby avoiding costly redundancy in that function (since in a firm the responsibility for monitoring can be centralised in a way that it cannot if production is organised as a group of workers each acting as a firm).

The weakness in Alchian and Demsetz&#x27;s argument, according to Williamson, is that their concept of team production has quite a narrow range of applications, as it assumes outputs cannot be related to individual inputs. In practice, this may have limited applicability (small work group activities, the largest perhaps a symphony orchestra), since most outputs within a firm (such as manufacturing and secretarial work) are separable so that individual inputs can be rewarded on the basis of outputs. Hence team production cannot offer the explanation of why firms (in particular, large multi-plant and multi-product firms) exist.

==Asset specificity==
For Oliver E. Williamson, the existence of firms derives from ‘asset specificity’ in production, where assets are specific to each other such that their value is much less in a second-best use. This causes problems if the assets are owned by different firms (such as purchaser and supplier), because it will lead to protracted bargaining concerning the gains from trade, because both agents are likely to become locked into a position where they are no longer competing with a (possibly large) number of agents in the entire market, and the incentives are no longer there to represent their positions honestly: large-numbers bargaining is transformed into small-number bargaining.

If the transaction is a recurring or lengthy one, re-negotiation may be necessary as a continual power struggle takes place concerning the gains from trade, further increasing the transaction costs. Moreover, there are likely to be situations where a purchaser may require a particular, firm-specific investment of a supplier which would be profitable for both; but after the investment has been made it becomes a sunk cost and the purchaser can attempt to re-negotiate the contract such that the supplier may make a loss on the investment (this is the hold-up problem, which occurs when either party asymmetrically incurs substantial costs or benefits before being paid for or paying for them). In this kind of situation, the most efficient way to overcome the continual conflict of interest between the two agents (or coalitions of agents) may be the removal of one of them from the equation by takeover or merger. Asset specificity can also apply to some extent to both physical and human capital so that the hold-up problem can also occur with labour (e.g. labour can threaten a strike, because of the lack of good alternative human capital; but equally the firm can threaten to fire).

Probably the best constraint on such opportunism is reputation (rather than the law, because of the difficulty of negotiation, composition, and enforcement of contracts). If a reputation for opportunism significantly damages an agent&#x27;s dealings in the future, this alters the incentives to be opportunistic.

Williamson sees the limit on the size of the firm as being given partly by costs of delegation (as a firm&#x27;s size increases its hierarchical bureaucracy does too), and the large firm&#x27;s increasing inability to replicate the high-powered incentives of the residual income of an owner-entrepreneur. This is partly because it is in the nature of a large firm that its existence is more secure and less dependent on the actions of any one individual (increasing the incentives to shirk), and because intervention rights from the central characteristic of a firm tend to be accompanied by some form of income insurance to compensate for the lesser responsibility, thereby diluting incentives. Milgrom and Roberts (1990) explain the increased cost of management as due to the incentives of employees to provide false information beneficial to themselves, resulting in costs to managers of filtering information, and often the making of decisions without full information. This grows worse with firm size and more layers in the hierarchy. Empirical analyses of transaction costs have attempted to measure and operationalize transaction costs. Research that attempts to measure transaction costs is the most critical limit to efforts to potential falsification and validation of transaction cost economics.

==Boundaries of the firm==
Boundaries of the firm explores the restrictions on size and output variety of firms, and how and why these restrictions affect production and enterprise success. There are two boundaries, horizontal, and vertical. As part of their corporate strategy, firms must choose between being horizontally broad, vertically deep, or both. Firms with horizontal breadth have numerous product lines or types, whereas firms with vertical depth are integrated into various stages of the value chain. Generally, a firm&#x27;s capabilities are specific to a particular scope direction, for example, marketing skills lead to horizontal breadth, and production expertise lead to vertical depth.

A firm is horizontally broad when it utilises excess indivisible resources to expand into various products, and obtain scope economies. Horizontally broad firms leverage capabilities such as marketing skills, product knowledge, customer service, and reputation for their expansions. Scope economies, or economies of scope, describe the aspect of production wherein cost savings result from the scope of an enterprise, as opposed to its scale (see economies of scale). Meaning, there are economies of scope where it is less expensive for firms to combine two or more product lines into one, than it is to produce each product separately. Scope economies, wherein resources are synergistically used, has been found to improve firm performance. However, coordination, adjustment and execution costs related to producing products synergistically are limiting factors.

A firm is vertically deep if it possesses stronger capabilities than external producers, and thus can produce and distribute its goods or services more efficiently internally - either upstream or downstream on the manufacturing chain. Vertically deep firms leverage capabilities such as production and process expertise, including technology selection, asset utilisation, and supply chain management. Vertical depth often improves a firm&#x27;s governance of activities, and contributes to a beneficial exploitation of internal capabilities, but is limited by the costs of hierarchical management, such as monitoring and coordination.

The concept of boundaries can be linked to Coase&#x27;s understanding of The Nature of the Firm, as it recognises that transaction costs are a significant factor in a firm&#x27;s decision to outsource, or internally produce, but also considers other influences specific to firms, such as their relevant capabilities, and governance decisions.

=== Importance of boundaries ===
A study of firms in France illustrated how distortions to the number of employees and size of a firm directly impacts levels of productivity, wage and welfare within the organisation. Firms with at least 50 workers are subject to a number of additional regulations, which leads some firms to stay below the 50-worker threshold. The distortion acts like an additional tax on hiring workers, thereby preventing the reallocation from less productive to more productive firms, and reducing overall welfare.

==Economic theory of outsourcing==

In economic theory, the pros and cons of outsourcing have been discussed since Ronald Coase (1937) asked the famous question: Why is not all production carried on by one big firm? An informal answer has been provided by Oliver Williamson (1979), who has emphasized the importance of different transaction costs within and between firms. The boundaries of the firm (i.e., the distinction between transactions taking place within a firm and transactions between different firms) have been formally studied by Oliver Hart (1995) and his coauthors. According to the property rights approach to the theory of the firm based on incomplete contracting, the ownership structure (i.e., integration or non-integration) determines how the returns to non-contractible investments will be divided in future negotiations. Hence, whether or not outsourcing an activity to a different firm is optimal depends on the relative importance of the investments that the trading partners have to make. For instance, if only one party has to make an important non-contractible investment decision, then this party should be owner. However, the conclusions of the incomplete contracting theory crucially rely on the specification of the negotiations protocol and on whether or not there is asymmetric information.

== Firm as a Sociotechnical System==
The concept of viewing firms as sociotechnical systems finds its roots in the studies conducted by researchers at The Tavistock Institute of Human Relations, particularly the seminal works of Trist and Bamforth and Emery and Trist. These pioneering scholars observed, through extensive field observations employing a systemic perspective, that firms could be comprehended as structured sociotechnical systems. These systems were recognized as being open to the environment, possessing the capacity for self-regulation to achieve their objectives, and adapting by creating alternative pathways when necessary.

===Sociotechnical Approach===
The sociotechnical approach delineates firms not merely as economic entities but as systems that amalgamate social and technical facets. It delves into the interplay between the human and technological elements within organizations, emphasizing the interconnectedness and interdependence between the social structure—comprising people, relationships, and interactions—and the technical system—encompassing tools, processes, and resources.
This approach acknowledges that the effectiveness and functionality of a firm arise not solely from its technical prowess but also from the way its social system interacts and interfaces with the technical framework. The dynamic between these systems, as articulated by Trist, Bamforth, Emery, and Trist, illustrates the need for an integrated understanding of human behavior, organizational culture, and technological systems within the framework of a firm.

==Evolutionary and Complexity Theory-Based Approaches.==
Evolutionary approaches to understanding firms arose as a parallel branch to classical theories, stemming from the pioneering work of Joseph A. Schumpeter. Schumpeter diverged from the abstract concept of the firm, introducing the notion that each firm possesses a distinct structural identity. He unified the creation and management of a firm into a single economic theory, emphasizing the dynamic nature of firms as evolving entities that learn and innovate within their fundamental routines. He also differentiated between firm development and growth, previously considered interlinked concepts.

===Symbiotic Perspective===
This structural description paved the way for Terra and Passador to propose a dynamic perspective on firms that goes beyond profit-centric views. The authors utilize sociotechnical concepts, describing firms where the social system meets the self-regulation and self-preservation requirements proposed by Luhmann, imparting an autoreferential dynamic to this subsystem, while technical structures exhibit a goal-oriented dynamic. These two systems symbiotically form the firm&#x27;s supersystem, also manifesting an autoreferential dynamic, where social systems act as the mind animating the organization&#x27;s physical body.

From this standpoint, firms represent a system traversed by a continuous flow of information and resources, enclosed within themselves, ensuring their unity. Therefore, they lack inputs or outputs in the same sense as in finalistic views of firms. Due to their structural determinism, once the system emerges, its development inherently involves a history of recurrent interactions within the environment that both emerges with it and contains it. Both the system&#x27;s structure and the environment spontaneously change congruently and complementarily as the firm strives to maintain its organization and operational coherence. Its ultimate product refers not to its outputs per se but to its own organization and realization of identity and autonomy.

As an organization is a self-referential entity, enclosed within operational closure, its function focuses on its own constitution. In this context, the exchanges it conducts with its supra-systems merely represent disturbances and residues allowing it to capture from the environment the necessary order for its survival and sustenance of its identity. This contrasts with finalistic conceptions of firms, where the scope is to meet external demands. Under this perspective, the firm&#x27;s purpose is to ensure its own existence.

==== Boundaries ====
Under the perspective of the firm as a symbiotic entity, boundaries are defined through its operational closure. These boundaries encompass not only hierarchical relationships among agents but also various classes of relations linking social agents to a particular technical and social system. This occurs through the values and bonds of trust established by agents, ensuring the self-production of the organization&#x27;s values and their relative stability over time.

==== Viable Contour====
The viability of the firm, as a self-referential entity enclosed within operational closure, is linked to the rate of regeneration of its sociotechnical systems and the flow of resources and information traversing it. If the rate of disintegration exceeds the pace at which the firm can repair itself, the structure of this network of interactions unravels. This makes disintegration a powerful constraint on the maximum size for a viable contour structure. The flow of resources and information also places the firm in a situation of constant threat since such structures rely on relationships with the environment to sustain their dynamics. This underscores the necessity for an adjustment field that compensates for environmental disturbances—a crucial factor in preventing the system from reaching thermodynamic equilibrium, which ultimately signifies the demise of the structure.

====Social Attractors====
Experiments conducted by Terra and Passador underscored the significant role of attraction basins governing firm dynamics. In this context, technical systems emerged as the central element of organizational dynamics, around which social attractors orbit. These social attractors create secondary attraction basins and are surrounded by their own social &quot;satellites&quot; in a structure analogous to a planetary system. Here, the star can be understood as the technical system, the planets as leaders, and other agents as satellites or free bodies not confined to a single social attraction basin but related to the technical system.

Although the experiments highlighted technical systems as primary attractors, the authors&#x27; model also demonstrates a recursion in this system, where agents contribute to what attracts them in the technical system, just as the technical system shapes social structures by attracting agents. Hence, an intimate and symbiotic relationship exists between the social and technical systems, wherein the former shapes the latter. This grants leaders a crucial role in the growth and regeneration of structures since their control capacity directly impacts the organization&#x27;s viable boundary.

The model also reveals that relocating or including an agent or subsystem in an organization can affect its dynamics by altering the attraction basins governing it. This may lead to undesired qualitative leaps or even rupture of the organization&#x27;s self-referential network, potentially resulting in the collapse of one of its subsystems. Simultaneously, such restructuring in relationships and social attraction basins can also promote innovation, akin to DNA mutations, creating new dynamics and altering the variety and redundancy within organizations.

==== Essential conditions for a firm&#x27;s emergence====
Regarding the essential conditions for a firm&#x27;s emergence and sustenance, Terra and Passador identified four crucial elements: (1) the ability to integrate external agents into its formal network of relations; (2) being pervaded by a resource flow sustaining its self-referential network; (3) offering advantages for agents to associate with it; and (4) the capability to regenerate its formal network of relations when an agent is lost, especially at the supervisory level.

While regeneration of the formal network of relations appeared possible without specialized structures, organizations lacking such systems tend to be structurally unstable. Establishing routines specialized in replacing and reconstituting the social network enhances stability and significantly extends the organization&#x27;s lifespan. This suggests that mechanisms specialized in reconstructing the organization&#x27;s social network topology, even in simplified forms, are vital to ensure the longevity of such structures.

====Relationships with the environment and sustainability====
The theory of Symbiotic Dynamics is based on the intimate association between organizations and the systems that surround them, in such a way that the survival of these is correlated. Thus, it is important for the organization&#x27;s survival that the deterioration and transformation of supersystems, such as markets, society, and the environment, occur at a pace that allows them to regenerate to maintain their identity and organization, or that enables the firm itself to adapt to the new realities imposed by qualitative leaps that may occur in the dynamics of supersystems. If this need is neglected, it can lead the environment to deteriorate at a rate greater than the compensatory fields of organizations can support, leading them to disintegrate.

In this context, organizations need to be guided by a hybrid logic, blending proactivity and reactivity, where organizations recognize their impact on the environment as a whole and act in an organized manner to reduce their degeneration, while adapting to the demands that may arise from these interactions. In the context at hand, organizations need to include in their decisions all the other systems with which they are coupled, making it possible to envision the construction of complex socio-economic systems where they integrate in a stable and sustainable manner.

==Other models==
Efficiency wage models like that of Shapiro and Stiglitz (1984) suggest wage rents as an addition to monitoring, since this gives employees an incentive not to shirk, given a certain probability of detection and the consequence of being fired. Williamson, Wachter and Harris (1975) suggest promotion incentives within the firm as an alternative to morale-damaging monitoring, where promotion is based on objectively measurable performance. (The difference between these two approaches may be that the former is applicable to a blue-collar environment, the latter to a white-collar one). Leibenstein (1966) sees a firm&#x27;s norms or conventions, dependent on its history of management initiatives, labour relations and other factors, as determining the firm&#x27;s &quot;culture&quot; of effort, thus affecting the firm&#x27;s productivity and hence size.

George Akerlof (1982) develops a gift exchange model of reciprocity, in which employers offer wages unrelated to variations in output and above the market level, and workers have developed a concern for each other&#x27;s welfare, such that all put in effort above the minimum required, but the more able workers are not rewarded for their extra productivity; again, size here depends not on rationality or efficiency but on social factors. In sum, the limit to the firm&#x27;s size is given where costs rise to the point where the market can undertake some transactions more efficiently than the firm.

Recently, Yochai Benkler further questioned the rigid distinction between firms and markets based on the increasing salience of “commons-based peer production” systems such as open source software (e.g., Linux), Wikipedia, Creative Commons, etc. He put forth this argument in &quot;The Wealth of Networks: How Social Production Transforms Markets and Freedom&quot;, which was released in 2006 under a Creative Commons share-alike license.

== Grossman–Hart–Moore theory ==
In modern contract theory, the “theory of the firm” is often identified with the “property rights approach” that was developed by Sanford J. Grossman, Oliver D. Hart, and John H. Moore. The property rights approach to the theory of the firm is also known as the “Grossman–Hart–Moore theory”. In their seminal work, Grossman and Hart (1986), Hart and Moore (1990) and Hart (1995) developed the incomplete contracting paradigm. They argue that if contracts cannot specify what is to be done given every possible contingency, then property rights (and hence firm boundaries) matter. Specifically, consider a seller of an intermediate good and a buyer. Should the seller own the physical assets that are necessary to produce the good (non-integration) or should the buyer be the owner (integration)? After relationship-specific investments have been made, the seller and the buyer bargain. When they are symmetrically informed, they will always agree to collaborate. Yet, the division of the ex post surplus depends on the parties’ disagreement payoffs (the payoffs they would get if no ex post agreement were reached), which in turn depend on the ownership structure. Thus, the ownership structure has an influence on the incentives to invest. A central insight of the theory is that the party with the more important investment decision should be the owner. Another prominent conclusion is that joint asset ownership is suboptimal if investments are in human capital.

The Grossman–Hart–Moore model has been successfully applied in many contexts, e.g. with regard to privatization. Chiu (1998) and DeMeza and Lockwood (1998) have extended the model by considering different bargaining games that the parties may play ex post (which can explain ownership by the less important investor). Oliver Williamson (2002) has criticized the Grossman–Hart–Moore model because it is focused on ex ante investment incentives, while it neglects ex post inefficiencies. Schmitz (2006) has studied a variant of the Grossman–Hart–Moore model in which a party may have or acquire private information about its disagreement payoff, which can explain ex post inefficiencies and ownership by the less important investor. Several variants of the Grossman–Hart–Moore model such as the one with private information can also explain joint ownership.

<text>Sophie Jane Raworth (; born 15 May 1968) is an English journalist, newsreader and broadcaster working for the BBC. She is a senior newsreader and is one of the main presenters of BBC News (mainly &quot;BBC News at Six&quot; and &quot;BBC News at Ten&quot;). She has been a television presenter for state occasions and has also presented the BBC&#x27;s Election Night coverage, alongside other presenters.
In 2015, she became the new presenter of consumer affairs programme &quot;Watchdog&quot; and in 2016, began presenting &quot;Crimewatch&quot;, both for BBC One.

==Early life and education==
Sophie Jane Raworth was born on 15 May 1968 in Redhill, Surrey to a florist mother and a businessman father. She grew up in Twickenham and was privately educated at Bute House Preparatory School for Girls, Putney High School and St Paul&#x27;s Girls&#x27; School.

After completing a joint honours degree in French and German at the University of Manchester, Raworth spent a year teaching English to teenagers in Toulouse before completing a postgraduate diploma in broadcast journalism at City, University of London.

==Career==
Raworth joined the BBC in 1992 as a news reporter, first for Greater Manchester Radio and then, in April 1994, as BBC Regions correspondent in Brussels. In May 1995, she became the regular joint presenter of BBC&#x27;s &quot;Look North&quot; programme in Leeds.

Raworth moved to national television in 1997, to co-present the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Breakfast News&quot; programme on BBC One, initially with Justin Webb, and in later years, with John Nicolson.

Raworth then joined the BBC&#x27;s early morning news programme &quot;Breakfast&quot; at its launch in 2000, which she presented alongside Jeremy Bowen and in later years, Dermot Murnaghan, on Monday–Thursdays, and sometimes with regular relief presenters such as Bill Turnbull and Michael Peschardt. She then moved to the &quot;BBC Six O&#x27;Clock News&quot; in January 2003 which she presented alongside George Alagiah; she was a presenter on this bulletin until October 2005 when she went on maternity leave, and was replaced by Natasha Kaplinsky.

In March 2006, Raworth was named as the main presenter of the &quot;BBC News at One&quot;, replacing Anna Ford on Monday–Thursdays. She took up the position in June 2006 after returning from maternity leave. She also can occasionally be seen presenting relief shifts on the rolling news channel BBC News Channel.

Raworth has presented several BBC specials, including coverage of the Queen&#x27;s Golden Jubilee and &quot;Our Monarchy – the Next 50 Years&quot;, both alongside David Dimbleby. In addition, she has appeared on &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s World&quot; and, in the early 2000s, entertainment programmes such as &quot;Dream Lives&quot; and the quiz show &quot;Judgemental&quot;.

In 2004, Raworth appeared on the BBC fashion show &quot;What Not to Wear&quot;, in which she was given a makeover by style advisors Trinny Woodall and Susannah Constantine. In 2006 she was part of the television coverage of the Children&#x27;s Party at the Palace, an event to celebrate the Queen&#x27;s 80th birthday. Along with Huw Edwards, she presented some fake news updates for the programme, which led to many complaints from viewers. Raworth had a cameo role in the mid-200s as a newsreader in the last series of the BBC comedy series &quot;My Hero&quot;.

At the end of the &quot;One O&#x27;Clock News&quot; on 31 January 2008, she announced that she would be leaving the programme until the summer, and confirmed Kate Silverton as presenting the bulletin during her absence. Raworth returned on 25 August 2008, after the birth of her third child, with the presentation of the Bank Holiday editions of the &quot;BBC News at One&quot;, &quot;BBC News at Six&quot; and &quot;BBC News at Ten.&quot;

From early 2009, Raworth was the main relief presenter on the &quot;BBC News at Six&quot; and a regular relief presenter on the &quot;BBC News at Ten&quot;, often presenting when regular presenters Huw Edwards and Fiona Bruce were not available. She also appeared in place of Andrew Marr on &quot;The Andrew Marr Show&quot;, and presented on the &quot;BBC News Channel&quot; (formerly known as &quot;BBC News 24&quot;).

In May 2009, she presented &quot;The Trouble with Working Women&quot; with reporter and father-of-three Justin Rowlatt on the BBC. The programme looked at the role of the working woman. In 2009, she presented &quot;Crimewatch Roadshow&quot; on BBC One on weekday mornings.

In 2013, Raworth had a cameo appearance at the start of the film &quot;A Good Day to Die Hard&quot; as herself.

On 16 July 2013, Raworth was given an Award of Doctor of Arts &quot;honoris causa&quot; by City University London. 

Raworth presented &quot;Watchdog Daily&quot; in 2012 and &quot;Watchdog Test House&quot; in 2014 and 2015, before landing the role of main presenter on &quot;Watchdog&quot; in September 2015. She replaced Anne Robinson as presenter of &quot;Watchdog&quot;.

In February 2016, Raworth replaced Kirsty Young as the main anchor of &quot;Crimewatch&quot;. She previously guest presented the programme in 2012.

In 2018, to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Royal Air Force, Raworth presented a documentary called &quot;RAF 100: Into the Blue&quot;, where she talked about her grandfather, Captain Edwin Raworth, who was a pilot in the First World War.

From 9 January 2022 to July 2022, Sophie Raworth was the interim presenter on BBC&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Morning&quot;, temporarily replacing Andrew Marr as host. In September 2022, former BBC News Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg began presenting &quot;Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg&quot; which replaced &quot;Sunday Morning&quot; in the timeslot on BBC One.

==Personal life==
Raworth married estate agent Richard Winter on 13 December 2003, after he proposed to her on holiday on the Amalfi Coast on her 35th birthday. They live in Fulham, London, and have two daughters and one son. Her younger sister, Kate Raworth is an English economist.

===Genealogy===
In March 2017, the genealogy programme, &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot; on BBC television, featured Raworth&#x27;s family story. It revealed that she was descended from non-conformist ancestors who were members of the New Jerusalem Church. They lived in Birmingham at a time when the city suffered religious riots in 1791 with people like her ancestors being the targets. In the aftermath of the riots, Raworth&#x27;s ancestors, William and Martha Mott, took a great risk by uprooting their young family to move to North America. However, within two years of arriving, the parents had died of yellow fever and the children were sent back to England.

Raworth discovered in the programme that she was not descended from noted piano maker Henry Isaac Robert Mott as the family had believed, but from his cousin, Samuel Mott, who was dismissed from the piano company and ended up taking his own life.

===Running===

On 17 April 2011, Raworth completed the London Marathon, despite collapsing two miles from the finish line. By 2017, she had completed all six World Marathon Majors.

In April 2018, Raworth completed the Marathon des Sables, a six-day, ultramarathon in the Sahara Desert.

In October 2022, Raworth completed her 10th London Marathon. In April 2023, Raworth again completed the London Marathon.

At the 2024 London Marathon, Raworth fractured her ankle but the diagnosis did not come till the D-Day 80th anniversary celebrations. Raworth was forced to pull out of the 2024 United Kingdom general election debate. Raworth said &quot;The injury I picked up at the London marathon has now been diagnosed as a fracture in my ankle. I was only told this last week during the D-Day commemorations. I’m now on crutches, in a boot and non-weight-bearing for some time.&quot;

<text>National Treasure () is a national-level designation within the heritage preservation system of South Korea for tangible objects of significant artistic, cultural and historical value. Examples of objects include art, artifacts, sites, or buildings. It is administered by the Korea Heritage Service (KHS). Additions to the list are decided by the Cultural Heritage Committee.

Many of the registered items are popular tourist attractions for South Korea. Examples include Jongmyo, Bulguksa, Seokguram, and the Tripitaka Koreana at Haeinsa. As of May 2020, there are 327 distinct entries on the list, some composed of a large number of sub-entries. The treasures are numbered according to the order in which they were designated, not according to their individual value.

==History==
The first list of Korean cultural treasures was designated by Governor-General of Korea in 1938 during the Japanese occupation with &quot;The Act of Treasures of the Joseon dynasty&quot;.

In 1955, the South Korean government declared as National Treasures the items previously on the Korean Treasures Preservation Order issued during Japan&#x27;s occupation of Korea. The current list dates to December 20, 1962, when the Cultural Protection Act was enacted by the Supreme Council for National Reconstruction. There were 116 items on the &quot;National Treasures&quot; list at that time, with others designated as &quot;Treasures&quot;.

<doc id="1337689" wikidata="Q3208047" url="?curid=1337689" title="The Adventure of the Solitary Cyclist">
<text>&quot;The Adventure of the Solitary Cyclist&quot;, one of the 56 Sherlock Holmes short stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is one of 13 stories in the cycle collected as &quot;The Return of Sherlock Holmes&quot; (1905). It was first published in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; in the United States on 26 December 1903, and in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in the United Kingdom in January 1904.

==Plot==

Holmes is contacted by Miss Violet Smith of Farnham, Surrey about an unusual turn in her and her mother&#x27;s lives. Violet&#x27;s father has recently died and left his wife and daughter rather poor. There was an ad in the news asking about their whereabouts. Answering it, they met Mr. Carruthers and Mr. Woodley, the former a pleasant enough man, but the latter a bullying churl. They had come from South Africa, where they had known Violet&#x27;s uncle Ralph Smith, who had now also died in poverty and apparently wanted to see that his relatives were provided for. This struck Violet as odd, since she and her family had not heard a word from Smith since his departure for South Africa 25 years ago. Carruthers and Woodley explained that before dying, Ralph had heard of his brother&#x27;s death and felt responsible for his survivors&#x27; welfare.

Carruthers began by offering Violet a job as a live-in music teacher for his ten-year-old daughter at £100 a year, about twice the going rate. She accepted after Carruthers said that she could visit her mother on weekends. That went well until Mr. Woodley came to stay for a week. He made the most oafish advances to her, and boasted that if Violet married him she would have a life of luxury. He even grabbed her and demanded a kiss, precipitating expulsion by his host, Carruthers. Violet has not seen Woodley since.

The specific thing that has brought Violet to seek Holmes&#x27;s services, however, is the strange man who follows her on his bicycle as she cycles to and from the railway station for her weekend visits to her mother. The strange man always keeps his distance behind her and disappears without a trace, never letting her near him, and always along the same lonely stretch of road. Violet does not recognise him, but he has a black beard. Holmes asks her about her admirers, and other than Woodley, if he can be styled as such, she can only think of Mr. Carruthers, who, although a perfect gentleman at all times, seems attracted to her.

After Violet leaves, Holmes observes that it is odd that a household would pay £100 a year for a music teacher but be too cheap to pay for a horse and trap. He sends Dr. Watson to Surrey to see what he can find out. This turns out to be virtually nothing, except to establish that the lady&#x27;s story is true, and that the mystery man comes out of and goes back into a local house, Charlington Hall. Holmes upbraids Watson for his lackluster results. They also receive a letter from Violet that evening saying that Carruthers has proposed to her, but she had to refuse since she is already engaged to a man named Cyril Morton, an electrical engineer in Coventry.

Holmes goes to Surrey himself, and gets into a fight in a pub for his troubles; when he returns and tells Watson what happened, he actually considers his experience in Surrey to be hilarious. It seems that Mr. Woodley was in the taproom at the pub and heard his name mentioned in conversation. He came out and demanded to know who Holmes was and what he wanted. The discussion escalated to violence; Holmes emerged with a few bruises, whereas Woodley had to be carried home. The innkeeper merely mentioned that Woodley is a regular weekend guest at Charlington Hall, which is rented by Williamson, who, rumour has it, is a clergyman.

Holmes returns to 221B Baker Street with his face somewhat marred, and another letter arrives from Violet, saying that her situation has become impossible owing to Mr. Carruthers&#x27;s proposals, and Mr. Woodley&#x27;s reappearance. She is quitting. Holmes knows that some intrigue is afoot, and he tells Watson that they must get themselves to Surrey to see that Violet makes it to the station. Carruthers has at last acquired a trap, and she need not ride her bicycle this time.

Failing to realise that Violet might take an earlier train than usual, Holmes discovers that he is too late to meet Violet. The trap comes along the road, but by the time it does, no one is in it: Violet has been abducted. Holmes and Watson board the empty trap in an attempt to go after the kidnappers. They come face-to-face with the mysterious cyclist, who pulls a revolver on them; however, both parties quickly realise that they are on the same side – both have Violet&#x27;s welfare in mind. The cyclist declares that the abductors are Woodley and Williamson. He evidently knows something of the intrigue.
The group first find an unconscious groom, who was driving the trap, in the bushes, and then they find all three persons that they have been seeking on the Charlington Hall grounds, with the apparently defrocked clergyman performing a wedding ceremony between the other two. The bride is somewhat unwilling, judging from the gag over her mouth. Woodley&#x27;s boast of having married Violet leads the mysterious cyclist, unmasking himself as Carruthers, to pull out his revolver and shoot Woodley, wounding him.

The intrigue does indeed involve Uncle Ralph in South Africa. He was dying when Carruthers and Woodley left; far from being penniless at his death, it is revealed that in reality, Uncle Ralph had amassed a large fortune. As he was illiterate, he would surely die intestate, and therefore Violet would inherit his wealth as Ralph&#x27;s next of kin. The two crooks made their way to England in the hopes that one of them would get to marry Violet – Woodley having won the chance in a card game on the ship – and they had to draw Williamson into the plot, promising him a share of the lucre. The plan went awry when first, Woodley proved to be a brute, and next, Carruthers fell in love with Violet, and thereafter wanted nothing to do with his former confederates. He took to disguising himself and following her as she rode her bicycle past Charlington Hall, where he knew Woodley and Williamson might be lying in wait for her.

Heavy penalties await Woodley and Williamson, but Carruthers only gets a few months due to Woodley&#x27;s less-than-savory reputation. Holmes reassures Carruthers the &quot;marriage&quot; performed by Williamson was void; not only was it performed against Violet&#x27;s will, but Williamson had been unfrocked and therefore had no authority to legalise a marriage.

==Publication history==
&quot;The Adventure of the Solitary Cyclist&quot; was published in the US in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; on 26 December 1903, and in the UK in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in January 1904. The story was published with five illustrations by Frederic Dorr Steele in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;, and with seven illustrations by Sidney Paget in the &quot;Strand&quot;. It was included in the short story collection &quot;The Return of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, which was published in the US in February 1905 and in the UK in March 1905.

The first version of the story was refused by the editor of &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; because Holmes was not very involved in the plot.

Conan Doyle was not very pleased with the story and believed that the first three stories of &quot;The Return of Sherlock Holmes&quot; (&quot;The Adventure of the Empty House&quot;, &quot;The Adventure of the Norwood Builder&quot;, and &quot;The Adventure of the Dancing Men&quot;) were better than this story. He also commits a lapse in the narrative when he explicitly mentions Violet Smith&#x27;s visit to Holmes occurring on Saturday, 23 April 1895; 23 April that year fell on a Tuesday.

==Adaptations==

===Film and television===
The story was adapted as a 1921 short silent film in the Stoll film series starring Eille Norwood as Sherlock Holmes.

The story was adapted for the 1968 BBC series with Peter Cushing. The episode is now lost.

The Granada TV version with Jeremy Brett was relatively faithful to the original story; however, it has a comic relief ending when Holmes&#x27;s chemical experiment causes the flat to fill up with smoke, and brings the fire brigade to the scene. (The chemical experiment – without smoke – is from &quot;The Adventure of the Naval Treaty&quot;.)

In 2001, &quot;Murder Rooms: Mysteries of the Real Sherlock Holmes&quot; starring Charles Edwards and Ian Richardson, did an episode entitled &quot;The Patient&#x27;s Eyes&quot; which involves a female cyclist being followed by a mysterious figure and implies the source of the story &quot;The Solitary Cyclist.&quot;

===Radio and audio dramas===
The story was adapted by Edith Meiser as an episode of the American radio series &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. The episode aired on 27 April 1931, with Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson. A remake of the script aired on 20 June 1936 (with Gordon as Holmes and Harry West as Watson).

Meiser also adapted the story for the American radio series &quot;The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson. The episode aired on 26 October 1941.

John Gielgud played Sherlock Holmes and Ralph Richardson played Watson in a radio adaptation of the story that aired on 30 November 1954 on the BBC Light Programme. The production also aired on NBC radio on 27 February 1955.

Michael Hardwick adapted the story for the BBC Light Programme as part of the 1952–1969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson. It aired in 1964.

An adaptation of the story aired on BBC radio in 1978, starring Barry Foster as Holmes and David Buck as Watson. It was adapted by Michael Bakewell.

<doc id="1337691" wikidata="Q767681" url="?curid=1337691" title="Syrian Social Nationalist Party">
<text>The Syrian Social Nationalist Party (SSNP; ) is a Syrian nationalist party operating in Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan. It advocates the establishment of a Greater Syrian nation state spanning the Fertile Crescent, including present-day Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, Kuwait, Palestine, Israel, Cyprus, Sinai, Hatay Province, and Cilicia, based on geographical boundaries and the common history people within the boundaries share. It has also been active in the Syrian and Lebanese diaspora, for example in South America. Until the fall of the Assad regime it was an ally of the ruling Arab Socialist Ba&#x27;ath Party, being the second-ranking party in the National Progressive Front.

Founded in Beirut in 1932 by the Lebanese intellectual Antoun Saadeh as an anticolonial political organization hostile to French colonial rule, the party played a significant role in Lebanese politics. It launched coups d&#x27;état attempts in 1949 and 1961, following which it was repressed in the country. SSNP was active in the fight against the Israeli military during the 1982 Lebanon War and subsequent Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon until 2000, while simultaneously supporting the Syrian occupation of Lebanon due to its beliefs in Syrian irredentism.

In Syria, SSNP operated as an ultranationalist movement until the 1950s; advocating armed uprising to establish a one-party state. It participated in the 1949 Syrian coup d&#x27;état, which overthrew the democratically elected government of Shukri al-Quwatli. SSNP continued to engage in violent activities throughout the country; and was banned in 1955 after its assassination of a Syrian Ba&#x27;athist military officer Adnan al-Malki. Despite its ban, the party remained organized, and by the late 1990s had allied itself with the Palestine Liberation Organisation and the Lebanese Communist Party, despite the ideological differences between them. The SSNP was legalized in Syria in 2005, and joined the Syrian Ba&#x27;ath Party-led National Progressive Front. From 2012 to 6 May 2014, the party was part of the Popular Front for Change and Liberation. The party would take the side of the Ba&#x27;athist government during the Syrian Civil War, where almost 12,000 fighters of its armed branch, the Eagles of the Whirlwind (dismantled in 2019), fought alongside the Syrian Arab Armed Forces against the Syrian opposition and the Islamic State. Following the fall of the Assad regime, it was banned by the Syrian transitional government, though it still operates in other countries.

==Background==
===Early Syrian nationalists===
In the mid-nineteenth century, Butrus al-Bustani was one of the first to assert the existence of a natural Syrian nation that should be accommodated in a reformed Ottoman Empire. He belonged to the Nahda, thinkers influenced by the Arabic Literary Renaissance and the French Revolution and who wished to shape the Tanzimat reforms, which were an attempt to introduce a constitutional monarchy with religious freedom to reverse the Ottoman state&#x27;s creeping economic marginalisation and which would lead to the Young Turks and the Second Constitutional Era.

An influential follower of al-Bustani was the Belgian Jesuit historian, Henri Lammens, ordained as a priest in Beirut in 1893, who claimed that Greater Syria had since ancient times encompassed all the land between the Arab peninsula, Egypt, the Levantine corridor and the Taurus Mountains, including all the peoples within the Fertile Crescent.
This was also accompanied with the rise of a profoundly idealistic patriotism, largely resembling European romantic nationalism, idealizing the coming of a National Revival to the Levant, that would shake off the Ottoman past and propel back what many started to see again as the cradle of civilization into the modern world&#x27;s front stage. In that aspect, the works of Kahlil Gibran who began expressing his belief in Syrian nationalism and patriotism are central. As Gibran said, &quot;I believe in you, and I believe in your destiny. I believe that you are contributors to this new civilization... I believe that it is in you to be good citizens. And what is it to be a good citizen?... It is to stand before the towers of New York and Washington, Chicago and San Francisco saying in your hearts, &quot;I am the descendent of a people the built Damascus and Byblos, and Tyre and Sidon and Antioch, and I am here to build with you, and with a will.&quot;

==History==

===Foundation and early years===

The SSNP was founded by Antun Saadeh, a Lebanese journalist and lecturer from a Greek Orthodox family who had lived in South America from 1919 to 1930 who secretly established the first nucleus of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party in November 1932, which operated underground for the first three years of its existence; in 1933, he started publishing the monthly journal &quot;Al-Majalla&quot;, which was distributed in the American University of Beirut and developed the party&#x27;s ideology. In 1936, the party&#x27;s open hostility to colonialism led to the French authorities banning the party and the imprisoning Saadeh for six months for creating a clandestine party, although an accusation of having been in contact with the German and Italian fascist movements was dropped after the Germans denied any relationship. During his time in prison Saadeh wrote &quot;The Genesis of Nations&quot; to lay out the SSNP&#x27;s ideology. At that time, the Party joined ranks with other nationalist and patriotic forces including the National Bloc, whereas it began militating, in secret, for the overthrow of the Mandate. Nonetheless, the alliance between the SSNP and the National Bloc did not last long: The National Bloc refrained from engaging in actual militant activities against the French, deciding instead to cooperate with the High Commissioner. Many SSNP members also felt that the NB refused to cooperate with them because their founder was Christian.

Saadeh emigrated again to Brazil in 1938 and afterwards to Argentina, only to return to Lebanon in 1947 following the country&#x27;s independence from the French in 1943. On his way to Argentina, he visited Italy and Berlin, which increased the suspicions of the French that the SSNP might have been entertaining relations with the Axis. Coming back shortly to Lebanon in 1939, he was questioned by the French authorities who accused him of plotting with the Germans. The charge was dropped when no evidence of collaboration had been found and after that Saadeh declared that even the French rule to which he was vehemently opposed would be better than German or Italian rule. Having afterwards left for Argentina, Saadeh found out that the Argentinian branch of the SSNP newspaper had been voicing its outright support for Nazi Germany and to the Axis powers, which led Saadeh to issue a lengthy letter to the editor-in-chef, restating that the SSNP is not a National Socialist party and that no stance should be taken vis-à-vis the Allies or the Axis.
While the Kataeb was committed to the notion of Lebanon as a nation state defined as an entity presiding over the borders outlined first by the Sykes–Picot agreement in 1916, and afterwards by the French administrative division of its mandate into six states including the state of Greater Lebanon, and had espoused a strong bond between the nation and the church as well as outright social ultraconservatism, the SSNP rejected these national claim on the basis that the borders outlining the newly created states were fictitious, resulting from colonialism, and do not reflect any historical and social realities. The party claimed that Greater Syria as defined by Saadeh represents the national ideal encompassing the historical people of Mesopotamia and the Fertile Crescent, bound together by a clearly defined geography and a common historical, social and cultural development path away from all sectarianism.When the Arabs lost the war in 1948, Saadeh propelled the Party into a fully confrontational stance: He deemed Arabism as a purely rhetorical gimmick, condemned the incompetence and hypocrisy of the Arab leaders, and asserted that the creation of the State of Israel and the expulsion of the Palestinians was the direct result of this incompetence.

On 4 July 1949, a year after the declaration of the establishment of the state of Israel and the 1948 Palestinian expulsion and flight (the Nakba), and a response to a series of aggressions perpetrated by the Kataeb-backed Lebanese government, the SSNP attempted its first revolution. Following a violent crackdown by government forces, Saadeh traveled to Damascus to meet with Husni al-Za&#x27;im in an attempt to obtain his support. A decision was taken by King Farouk, Riad el Solh and Husni al-Za&#x27;im to eliminate Antoun Saadeh, under the patronage of British Intelligence and the Mossad. As a result, Al-Za&#x27;im handed Saadeh over to Lebanese authorities, who had him executed on 8 July 1949. It was the shortest and most secretive trial given to a political offender.

===SSNP in Lebanon===


=== From confrontation to accommodation ===
After Saadeh was executed and its high-ranking leaders were arrested, the party remained underground until 1958 when it sided with the pro-Western president Camille Chamoun against the Arab nationalist rebels.

==== 1961 coup d&#x27;etat ====
On the last day of 1961, two SSNP members, company commanders in the Lebanese army, led an unsuccessful attempted lightning coup against Fouad Chehab, supported by some 200 civilian SSNP members. In the scholarly literature, the coup has been explained as stemming from the party&#x27;s ideological preference for violence (&quot;bullets over ballots&quot;), its frustration at exclusion from the Lebanese state, and both political and military criticism of the rule of Fouad Chehab.

Advisors of Chehab who allegedly witnessed armed SSNP partisans gathering around the central areas of Beirut rushed to the presidential palace to inform Chehab of the insurrection. This resulted in a renewed proscription and the imprisonment and/or execution of many SSNP leaders. Most of the party&#x27;s known activists remained in prison or exile until a general amnesty in 1969. In 1969, the party re-aligned towards Arab nationalism.

==== Lebanese Civil War ====
With the outbreak of the Lebanese Civil War in 1975, the SSNP formed a military squad that allied with the Lebanese National Movement (LNM), against the Phalangists and their allies of the Lebanese Front. The SSNP saw the Lebanese Civil War as the inevitable result of the divisions of the Syrian nation into small states and away from a liberation war against Israel. In the mid-1970s, there were tensions within the party between &quot;a reformist branch close to the Palestinian factions and another more inclined toward Damascus&quot;; it reunified in 1978.

After the defeat of anti-Israeli forces in the 1982 Lebanon War, the SSNP joined a number of the organizations who regrouped to resist the Israeli occupation, including the killing of two Israeli soldiers in a Wimpy Cafe in west Beirut by party member Khalid Alwan. The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation blames the SSNP for the assassination, in 1982, of Bachir Gemayel, Lebanon&#x27;s newly elected president supported by the Israelis besieging Beirut. An SSNP member, Habib Shartouni, was arrested for the assassination and eventually convicted for it in 2017.

In 1983, the party joined the Lebanese National Salvation Front. In 1985, a member of the party, Sana&#x27;a Mehaidli, detonated a car bomb next to an Israeli military convoy at Jezzin, South Lebanon. She killed two Israeli soldiers and become one of the first known female suicide bombers.

====After the Civil War====
The SSNP in Lebanon was broadly supportive of the Syrian occupation of Lebanon and was allied to pro-Syrian parties (including the March 8 Alliance) in the aftermath of the occupation.

The SSNP participated in a number of general elections in Lebanon, winning six seats in 1992, although seeing a decline in subsequent elections winning two seats in both 2005 and 2009. The SSNP were involved in the 2008 conflict in Lebanon, with gunmen attacking an SSNP office.

Assaad Hardan was party leader for two terms. Hardan was succeeded by Rabih Banat in 2020, but with a growing split in the party between Hardan&#x27;s followers, who are closer to the Syrian government and the March 8 Alliance, and Banat&#x27;s followers, who are closer to the administration of Saad Hariri. As of the 2022 Lebanese elections, the party did not win any seat and currently has no representation in the Lebanese Parliament.

During clashes in the context of the 2023 Israel-Hamas War and border clashes between Israel and Hezbollah, the PSNS-L took part in the conflict and lost one of its members.

===SSNP in Syria===

Saadeh had intended SSNP to be an organization that created an Italian-style Risorgimento which would bring about his project for &quot;Greater Syria&quot;. The party promoted anti-communist conspiratorial rhetoric and believed in the formation of an all-encompassing, totalitarian state. Throughout the 1950s, the party acted as an ultranationalist entity which plotted violent insurrections and committed terrorist attacks, political assassinations, and other criminal acts. The Syrian Communist Party and Ba&#x27;ath Party were its principal rivals, both of which denounced SSNP as a Western-backed Zionist project aimed at undermining Arab unity and aiding Western interests in the region. After the SSNP&#x27;s assassination of a high-ranking Syrian military officer and Arab nationalist, Adnan al-Malki, in 1955, Syrian authorities banned the party and organized a witch hunt against its members under pressure from the Ba&#x27;ath and Communist parties. Throughout the 1950s, SSNP members were captured and put on trial, imprisoned, or killed, ending the party&#x27;s status as a political force in the country. The SSNP remained an outlawed group in Syria for decades, with the party&#x27;s image being tarnished by the Malki affair as well as its alignment with Western interests and anti-Arab stances resented by the Syrian populace.

The SSNP&#x27;s stance during the Lebanese civil war and in Lebanese politics—where it has become a close ally of Hezbollah—was consistent with that of Syria, which facilitated a rapprochement between the party and the Syrian government. During the latter years of Hafez al-Assad&#x27;s presidency, the party was increasingly tolerated. After the succession of his son Bashar al-Assad in 2000, this process continued. In 2001, while still officially banned, the party was permitted to attend meetings of the Ba&#x27;ath-led National Progressive Front coalition of legal parties as an observer. In spring 2005, the party was legalised in Syria, in what has been described as &quot;an attempt to allow a limited form of political activity&quot;.

Over time, the SSNP and the Syrian Ba&#x27;athist regime experienced a dramatic turnaround in their historical relationship, from enemies to allies. The process started as the party reckoned that Hafez al-Assad&#x27;s regional goals, such as consolidating Syria&#x27;s control over Lebanon and the PLO, were consistent with the SSNP&#x27;s goal of establishing Greater Syria, while the SSNP reciprocated by acting as a Syrian proxy in Lebanon. The alliance has strengthened in the face of the Syrian Civil War.

In the 22 April 2007 election for the People&#x27;s Council of Syria, the party gained three out of 250 seats in the parliament. In 2015, journalist Terry Glavin wrote, &quot;But for a brief and friendly interregnum during the Baathist regime&#x27;s phoney national elections of 2012, the SSNP has been a member of Bashar al-Assad&#x27;s ruling coalition since 2005.&quot; Its Syrian leader is Ali Haidar, who has been one of the two non-Ba&#x27;ath party minister&#x27;s in the Damascus government since 2012, as Minister of State for National Reconciliation Affairs.

====Role in the Syrian Civil War====

&quot;L&#x27;Orient-Le Jour&quot; reported in 2021 that the Syrian uprising/civil war &quot;was an opportunity for the SSNP to take on a new dimension&quot;. According to Syrian analyst Samir Akil, SSNP cadres mostly came from the Christian, Alawite, and Shi&#x27;ite communities, posing a direct threat to the Assad regime, which was seeking to monopolise control over minorities by the Arab Socialist Ba&#x27;ath party. During the Syrian revolution protests, the SSNP participated in counter-demonstrations in support of the government. Once the Syrian Civil War broke out, the government reciprocated, providing weaponry and training. In the meantime, SSNP officials had become a target for rebel militants and were kidnapped and assassinated. Bashar al-Yazigi, head of the political SSNP bureau in Syria, stated that the &quot;opposition is seeking to create sharp sectarian rifts and fragment Syrian society&quot;, with the party regarding both the ongoing Syrian Civil War and the Iraq War as attempts to partition those countries—and, eventually, Lebanon—along ethno-sectarian lines.

In 2016, estimates of the number of SSNP fighters in Syria ranged from 6,000 to 8,000. Lebanese fighters were included in their ranks, even though the party claims that &quot;their proportion within the group&#x27;s total fighting force has decreased steadily, as more Syrians sign up&quot;.

By February 2014, SSNP fighters were primarily deployed in the governorates of Homs and Damascus and were said to be the most formidable military force other than the Syrian army in Suwayda. SSNP fighters have participated in the battles of Sadad, of Ma&#x27;loula, and of al-Qaryatayn, among others. In 2016, party officials claimed that its membership had increased &quot;by the thousands&quot; since the start of the war as a result of its alleged &quot;reputation as an effective fighting force in Syria&quot;.

The party was allowed a larger role in the Syrian People&#x27;s Assembly: it fielded thirty candidates for the 2016 parliamentary election, winning seven seats.

However, starting from 2018, these gains began to be reversed, as Bashar al-Assad initiated an intense Ba&#x27;athification programme in regime-held territories, which sought the stronger amalgamation of the Ba&#x27;athist-state nexus and the tightening of the grip of the state. As part of its attempts to strengthen the one-party state, the Ba&#x27;ath party has also cemented its monopoly over military forces, student activism, trade unions, youth organizations, and other social associations. The new campaign also purged those Ba&#x27;ath cadres deemed insufficiently loyal from all levels of party organizations and promoted the re-structuring of Syrian society along the lines of Ba&#x27;athist ideology, characterized by absolute loyalty to the Assad dynasty, which is portrayed as the founding fathers of the Syrian state.

The SSNP was one of the biggest losers in the 2020 Syrian parliamentary elections, with its allotted seats being reduced from seven to three. The elections showcased the absolute dominance of the Arab Socialist Ba&#x27;ath party in the political system by increasing the Ba&#x27;athist share to two-thirds of the total, or 167 seats. This was also part of the Assad regime&#x27;s wider clampdown on SSNP activities to curb its influence in Syria that was gained during the civil war. The Ba&#x27;athist government also dissolved the Eagles of the Whirlwind, the SSNP&#x27;s paramilitary wing in the country.

The anti-SSNP clampdown was also part of Bashar al-Assad&#x27;s feud with his cousin Rami Makhlouf, who headed the SSNP (Amana) faction and was widely reviled as a symbol of corruption in the regime. Bashar al-Assad had banned the SSNP (Amana) faction on 10 October 2019 and ordered the confiscation of his cousin&#x27;s business assets. Makhlouf&#x27;s private militias, which fought alongside the Syrian military, were also disbanded by the government. SSNP leaders criticized their sidelining in the 2020 parliamentary elections as a betrayal, with many party cadres viewing the authoritarian measures of the government with dismay.

In 2023, the SSNP announced their support for Hamas attack on Israel, congratulating Hamas for launching the offensive and asking for the Palestinian National Authority to join the fight. The SSNP further claimed that terrorism is a &quot;tool for the Jewish people&quot; rather than for Hamas.

In the 2024 parliamentary election, the last held in Ba&#x27;athist Syria, they retained their three seats as members of the National Progressive Front.

==== Post-Assad ====
Following the fall of the Assad dictatorship, the SSNP published a statement separating itself from the old regime, accusing it of &quot;contributing to the fragmentation of our party&#x27;s institutions&quot; and calling for unity to maintain national sovereignty, institutions and interests. It also called for confronting the ongoing Israeli invasion of Syria. It also formed a militant organisation known as The Islamic Resistance Front in Syria which joined the Neo-Ba&#x27;athist insurgency in the country and participated in action against the Israeli invasion of the country.

===SSNP in Jordan===
In 1966, King Hussein had his security services sent into action to eradicate the SSNP from Jordan. The party had been active among the Palestinian population.

In 2013 followers of the party established the &quot;Movement of Syrian Social Nationalists in Jordan&quot;.

==Ideology==

Scholars and analysts have debated how the SSNP&#x27;s ideology should be described. For example, &quot;L&#x27;Orient-Le Jour&quot; write that Saadeh&#x27;s &quot;national vision was based on belonging to one&#x27;s geographical milieu, rather than one&#x27;s race. His supporters insist that their leader chose the party&#x27;s emblem long before he learned of Nazism.&quot; Christopher Solomon states that SSNP&#x27;s persistent backing of the Ba&#x27;athist government since its occupation of Lebanon, has positioned the party in the left-wing side of political spectrum. Other sources are less definitive. Political rivals of SSNP have commonly labelled Antoun Saadeh as a fascist ideologue who formed relations with Nazis during the Second World War. Saadeh was aware of accusations of fascism, and he responded to them during his speech of 1 June 1935:

Throughout the Second World War, Saadeh was rumoured to have close contacts with officials of Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. Some scholars have made comparisons of SSNP&#x27;s ideological and organizational resemblances with European fascism, and of its external symbols to those of German Nazism, although these criticisms are not accepted by the party itself. Bellingcat calls it a &quot;rabidly anti-Semitic, fascist organization [with] international ties to the far-right.&quot;

According to historian Stanley G. Payne, interwar Arab nationalism was influenced by European fascism, with the creation of at least seven Arab nationalist shirt movements similar to the brown shirt movement by 1939, with the most influenced ones being the SSNP, the Iraqi Futawa youth movement and the Young Egypt movement. These three movements would share characteristics like being territorially expansionist, with the SSNP wanting the complete control of Syria, belief in the superiority of their own people (with Saadeh theorizing a &quot;distinct and naturally superior&quot; Syrian race), being &quot;nonrationalist, anti-intellectual, and highly emotional&quot; and &quot;[emphasizing] military virtues and power [and stressing] self-sacrifice&quot;. Also according to Payne, all these movements received strong influence from European fascism and praised the Italian and German fascism but &quot;[they never became] fully developed fascist movements, and none reproduced the full characteristics of European fascism&quot;; the influence in Arab nationalism remained long after 1945. Also, Saadeh&#x27;s superior race was not a pure one, but a fusion of all races in Syrian history. The SSNP would be &quot;[an] elite group, with little structure for mobilization&quot;.

According to researcher Wissam Samia, Saadeh defined the policy of the SSNP in a newspaper he founded in 1947 called &#x27;Suriah al-jadida&#x27; (New Syria) in a letter to its board of directors. He defined the party&#x27;s policy as &quot;Syrian nationalist policy that is not mixed with any foreign policy&quot;, and emphasized that the party&#x27;s policy is not fascist, Nazi, or &quot;democratic&quot;, and that the party&#x27;s politics is not communist or Bolshevik.

Prior to the fall of the Assad regime, the party referred to political opponents of the regime as &quot;internal Jews.&quot;

===Nationalism===

==== Greater Syria, natural Syria ====
While in jail from early February to early May 1936, Saadeh completed &quot;The Genesis of Nations&quot; which he had started writing three months before the French authorities in Lebanon discovered the secret organization and arrested its leader and his assistants. In his book, Saadeh formulated his belief in the existence of a Syrian nation in a homeland defined as embracing all historic Syria extended to the Suez Canal in the south, and that includes modern Syria, Palestine, Israel, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, and Kuwait. The boundaries of the historic environment in which the Syrian nation evolved went much beyond the scope usually ascribed to Syria, extending from the Taurus range in the north-east and the Zagros mountains in the north-west to the Suez Canal and the Red Sea in the south and includes the Sinai peninsula and the Gulf of Aqaba, and from the Mediterranean Sea in the west, including the island of Cyprus, to the arch of the Arabian desert and the Persian Gulf in the east. According to Saadeh, this region is also called the Syrian Fertile Crescent, the island Cyprus being its star.
These natural geographical factors hence create the societal framework in which man establishes his existence, beliefs, habits, and value systems. Saadeh&#x27;s critique of ethnic nationalisms led him to hence develop a framework of geographical nationalism, the idea of the &quot;natural homeland&quot;. When he applied this model to the case of the Fertile Crescent, the conclusion he reached was straightforward: the natural geographical factors of the basin lying east of the Mediterranean is what has allowed it to become the cradle of civilizations, what has driven throughout the course of human history movements seeking to unify it, what has allowed it to establish, through ethnic, religious and cultural assimilation and mixing, a high culture and civilization, and what has made it the prize coveted by all imperialist powers. Saadeh advocated for all ethnoreligious groups to consider themselves as descendants of the pre-Christian era empires of Babylon and Assyria, of the Hittites and the kings of Aram, then of the Islamic empires, all the way up until the present. The SSNP claimed that the Greater Syria is the natural home of the Syrian people with clearly defined geographic boundaries, yet that its people are suffering from what Saadeh described as a &quot;woe&quot; (&quot;al-wail&quot;) owing to an identity crisis due to Ottoman occupation, colonialism, and sectarianism. Saadeh claimed that the &quot;renaissance&quot; of the Syrian nation is inevitably linked to the purge of these &quot;decadent&quot; forces through the reinforcing of national solidarity, resistance against colonialism, and adoption of secularism.

In Saadeh&#x27;s vision of &quot;harmony&quot; among the country&#x27;s ethnic and religious communities through a return to a so-called Syrian &quot;racial unity&quot; which was itself in fact a mixture of races, neither Islam nor pan-Arabism was important, and therefore religion wasn&#x27;t either. Saadeh&#x27;s concept of the nation was shaped mainly by historical concrete interactions amongst people over the centuries in a given geography, rather than being based on ethnic origins, race, language or religion. This led him also to conclude that the Arabs could not form one nation, but many nations could be called Arab.

==== Syrian people ====
Unlike other militant nationalist parties in the Arab World, Syrian Social Nationalist Party was unique in its espousal of an exclusive form of nationalism which glorified the pre-Christian era, advocating the union of all Syrian peoples under a &quot;Greater Syria&quot;. The party admitted Christians, Muslims and Druzites into its ranks, but denied the Jews in Syria any membership, even if they were opposed to Zionism.

==== Romantic nationalism ====
The attitude of the party and its founder towards minority separatism and movements calling for ethnically separate homelands was one of outright hostility. Saadeh was also hostile to all religiously motivated political movements, or movements that did not call for the separation between Church (or Mosque) and State. The incoming Jewish migrants to Southern Syria (Palestine) and the Jewish communities were criticized for their &quot;foreign and racial loyalties&quot;, their unwillingness to assimilate, and their active willingness to create an ethnically Jewish state in Palestine, with Saadeh deeming the Jews as the community unable and unwilling to assimilate, and having criticized the notion that Jewishness can be a cornerstone for a nation-state. For the SSNP, the Jews do not constitute a nation as they are a heterogeneous mixture of peoples in a similar sense that Muslims and Christians do not constitute a nation. Similarly, the Kurds were criticized for their communitarianism and their disposition to establish a Kurdish state in the north.

==== Social nationalism ====
While the Renaissance is underlined as a romanticized notion of spiritual, intellectual, and patriotic elevation, the SSNP elaborated a simple yet straightforward doctrine pertaining to how the Syrian People ought to organize itself once the Renaissance has begun, albeit the fact that Saadeh had not developed the idea completely. The social-nationalist model elaborated by Saadeh is reflected in the &quot;Communiqué of the First Social Nationalist Revolution of 1949&quot;.

The first of these principles is the abolition of feudalism and of the rule of the traditional notables and landowners, which the Party deems responsible for the &quot;desolate state of things to which the country had gotten to&quot;, including maintaining educational levels at an all-time low and being instrumental in the loss of Palestine. The second principle is &quot;opposing capitalist tyranny&quot;. Despite its belief in the necessity of private property, the SSNP declared defending workers&#x27; rights and establishing a framework that guarantees these rights as an inalienable right. This is coupled with the need to establish mandatory education, universal healthcare, the nationalization of vital areas of the economy such as the production of raw materials, and a strong centralized state that is able to give economic directions. The third principle stated is combating communism.

==== Liberation war ====

In 1949, it declared the &quot;First Renaissance Revolution&quot; against the Lebanese government, an armed confrontation with the Lebanese and Syrian security forces that ended in a disaster and the execution of Antun Saadeh by the Lebanese authorities on 8 July. Not too long later, party members assassinated the Lebanese Prime Minister Riad al-Solh who was instrumental in Saadeh&#x27;s death penalty. To avoid being caught, the assailants committed suicide. When one of the assailants survived and woke up in the hospital, he completed his suicide attempt by tearing up his wounds and falling from the bed. The assassination of the general prosecutor who judged Saadeh was also conducted by a Party cell, and Party members are believed to have been involved in the assassination of Husni al-Zaim, the Syrian dictator who captured Saadeh and handed him over to the Lebanese authorities.

In 1982, party member Habib al-Shartouni assassinated the Lebanese President Bachir Gemayel, seen as betraying the country in the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982. The party also undertook many operations against Israeli presence in Lebanon, including a military operation in broad daylight against Israeli officers stationed in Beirut, which triggered the beginning of the generalized armed struggle for Lebanese liberation. Party member Sana&#x27;a Mehaidli, known as the first female suicide bomber, detonated herself in her car along with an Israeli convoy in south Lebanon. The party joined arms with the Communists, the PLO, the Arab nationalists, and other groups to fight against the Israeli invasion – see Lebanese National Movement/Lebanese National Resistance Front.

Today, the party&#x27;s military wing fights alongside the Syrian Arab Army against the Free Syrian Army and ISIS in the Syrian Civil War.

===Secularism===
The SSNP&#x27;s ideology was an entirely secular form of nationalism; indeed, it posited the complete separation of religion and politics as one of the two fundamental conditions for real national unity, alongside economic and social reform.

===Party form===
The SSNP was organised with a hierarchical structure and a powerful leader.

===Iconography and symbolism===

====Emblem and flag====
The party&#x27;s emblem is the whirlwind (). It was designed by the SSNP students at the American University of Beirut while the party was still clandestine and before the French authorities had uncovered it in 1936. Saadeh stated the whirlwind was found engraved on ancient Syrian artifacts, and it is known from for example Sumerian art. The SSNP emblem has been said to be a combination of the Islamic crescent and the Christian cross. The party flag features a red hurricane, called the &quot;Zawba&#x27;a&quot;, within a white disc on a black background. Each arm symbolizes one of the four virtues of the party&#x27;s mission: freedom, duty, discipline and power. According to SSNP lore, the black color symbolizes the Dark Ages of Ottoman rule, colonialism, sectarian division, national division, and backwardness. The &quot;Zawba&#x27;a&quot; represents the blood of the SSNP martyrs bound together as Muslims and Christians through freedom, duty, discipline and power as a hurricane to purge the Dark Ages and spark their nation&#x27;s rejuvenation and renaissance. Critics and scholars claim that the symbol was modeled after the Nazi swastika a claim that the party vehemently denies.

==Criticism==

===Ideological criticism===
Arab nationalist thinker Sati&#x27; al-Husri considered that Saadeh &quot;misrepresented&quot; Arab nationalism, incorrectly associating it with a Bedouin image of the Arab and with Muslim sectarianism. Palestinian historian Maher Charif sees Saadeh&#x27;s theory as a response to the religious diversity of Syria, and points to his later extension of his vision of the Syrian nation to include Iraq, a country also noted for its religious diversity, as further evidence for this. The party also accepted that due to &quot;religious and political considerations&quot;, the separate existence of Lebanon was necessary for the time being. From 1945 onward, the party adopted a more nuanced stance regarding Arab nationalism, seeing Syrian unity as a potential first step towards an Arab union led by Syria.

Journalist Christopher Hitchens and his team were assaulted in February 2009 by SSNP paramilitaries in the streets of Beirut before being rescued by a crowd. The attack left Hitchens with body injuries and a limp in his leg. Reporting to &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; in May 2009, Hitchens described SSNP as a &quot;suicide-bomber front&quot; that carries out terrorist operations in Lebanon on behalf of Ba&#x27;athist Syria. He asserted that SSNP was a violent fascist movement; noting its irredentist ambitions of creating &quot;Greater Syria&quot;, a project that sought the annexation or partial conquest of numerous nation-states in the region. Recounting the events of the assault, Hitchens stated: &quot;What shook me is how nearly it could have got fantastically nasty. We could have been hurt or taken away. These militias have their own private dungeons. I wouldn&#x27;t fancy spending time in one of those.&quot;

===Scholarly criticism===
Lebanese historian Kamal Salibi gives a somewhat contrasting interpretation, pointing to the position of the Greek Orthodox community as a large minority in both Syria and Lebanon for whom &quot;the concept of pan-Syrianism was more meaningful than the concept of Arabism&quot; while at the same time they resented Maronite dominance in Lebanon. According to Salibi,

 Saadeh found a ready following among his co-religionists. His idea of secular pan-Syrianism also proved attractive to many Druzes and Shiites; to Christians other than the Greek Orthodox, including some Maronites who were disaffected by both Lebanism and Arabism; and also to many Sunnite Muslims who set a high value on secularism, and who felt that they had far more in common with their fellow Syrians of whatever religion or denomination than with fellow Sunnite or Muslim Arabs elsewhere. Here again, an idea of nationalism had emerged which had sufficient credit to make it valid. In the Lebanese context, however, it became ready cover for something more archaic, which was essentially Greek Orthodox particularism.

Prof. Salibi remarks on the beginnings of Saadeh&#x27;s party in the 1930s: &quot;[A]mong its first members were students and young graduates of the American University of Beirut.&quot; This early party was &quot;mainly Greek Orthodox and Protestants with some Shi&#x27;ites and Druzes... .&quot; In Lebanon as a whole the party was not popular. &quot;Christians were generally opposed to their Syrian unionism, while Muslims were suspicious of their reservations with regard to pan-Arabism. The Lebanese authorities were able to suppress them without difficulty.&quot;

<text>&quot;The Adventure of the Priory School&quot;, one of the 56 Sherlock Holmes short stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is one of 13 stories in the cycle collected as &quot;The Return of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. It was first published in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; in the United States on 30 January 1904, and in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in the United Kingdom in February 1904. Doyle ranked &quot;The Adventure of the Priory School&quot; tenth in his list of his twelve favourite Holmes stories.

==Plot==

Holmes receives a visit from Dr. Thorneycroft Huxtable, the founder and principal of a preparatory school called Priory School in Northern England. He beseeches Holmes to come back to Mackleton with him to look into the disappearance of one of his pupils, the ten-year-old Lord Saltire, whose father is the very rich and famous Duke of Holdernesse. Huxtable explains that not only the boy has disappeared, but also the German master, Heidegger, along with his bicycle.

Once in the North, the Duke says to Holmes that he does not think that his estranged wife has anything to do with his son&#x27;s disappearance, nor has there been a ransom demand. Holmes establishes that the boy and his kidnappers could not have used the nearby road without being seen, suggesting that they went cross-country. As if to confirm this, the police find the boy&#x27;s school cap in some gypsies&#x27; possession. They swear that they simply found it on the moor, but the police lock them up.

Holmes and Dr. Watson go hunting for clues. They find a bicycle track, but it is not Heidegger&#x27;s; it does not match his tyres. Holmes observes that one tyre has a patch on it. Almost everything observable has been obliterated by cow tracks (which are the only marks on the ground anywhere). Eventually, Heidegger&#x27;s bicycle tracks are found, and they end where he lies, dead. After that, Holmes and Watson arrive at the Fighting Cock Inn, and meet the innkeeper, Reuben Hayes, who seems startled indeed to hear that Holmes wants to go to Holdernesse Hall, the Duke&#x27;s nearby house, to tell him news of his son. The two men have lunch there, and Holmes suddenly realises that he and Watson saw many cow tracks out on the moor, but never at any time did they see any cows. Furthermore, the patterns of the hoof prints were quite unusual, suggesting that the cow in question trotted, cantered, and galloped. Holmes and Watson sneak out to Hayes&#x27;s stable and examine the horse&#x27;s hooves. As Holmes has expected, there is evidence of recent shoeing, but with old shoes and new nails. Examining the nearby smithy, Holmes and Watson are rather belligerently asked to leave by Mr. Hayes.

Shortly afterwards, the two men hide as a cyclist comes along the road from the direction of the Duke&#x27;s. It is James Wilder, the Duke&#x27;s personal secretary, and he looks agitated. He arrives at the inn. Soon afterwards, a trap pulls out of the stable yard and goes along the road towards Chesterfield. A while later, someone else – it is getting dark and only a fleeting glimpse of the new visitor is caught – arrives at the inn. Coming closer, Holmes observes Wilder&#x27;s bicycle tyres and notes that they are the same make as the first ones encountered on the moor.

The next morning, they go to Holdernesse Hall, where they find that the Duke is not well. Nevertheless, Holmes demands from him a cheque for £6000 (), saying that he has earned the reward. His son is at the Fighting Cock, and the accused is the Duke himself, but the actual mastermind of this crime is James Wilder, who has a terrible secret: He is the illegitimate son of the Duke. He conceived a plan to kidnap Lord Saltire to force the Duke to change his will, knowing very well that his father would not call the police on him, as he abhorred the very idea of scandal. The plan had begun to unravel when Wilder hired Hayes – who has now fled, but been caught on Holmes&#x27;s information – to do the actual kidnapping. Hayes had killed Heidegger, and when Wilder heard the news, he confessed all to his father. So anxious had been the Duke to avoid scandal, he agreed to let his younger son remain confined at the inn for another three days, and to keep quiet, so that Hayes could flee justice.

All ends well, except for Hayes, who faces the gallows. Lord Saltire is brought home from the inn and the Duke writes to his estranged wife asking her to reconcile with him. This he feels she will be willing to do, for the source of the friction between them is going away: James Wilder is being packed off to Australia to seek his fortune. As for the cow tracks, they were accomplished by shoeing the horses with special shoes shaped like cow&#x27;s hooves. The shoes were from the Duke&#x27;s collection of family memorabilia.

==Publication history==
&quot;The Adventure of the Priory School&quot; was published in the US in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; on 30 January 1904, and in the UK in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in February 1904. The story was published with six illustrations by Frederic Dorr Steele in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;, and with nine illustrations by Sidney Paget in the &quot;Strand&quot;. It was included in the short story collection &quot;The Return of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, which was published in the US in February 1905 and in the UK in March 1905.

==Adaptations==

===Film and television===
A silent short film based on the story was released in 1921 as part of the Sherlock Holmes film series by Stoll Pictures. Eille Norwood played Sherlock Holmes and Hubert Willis played Dr. Watson.

The story was dramatised as part of the Granada TV Holmes series starring Jeremy Brett. Set in 1887, however, the revelation of Wilder&#x27;s parentage and the ending were changed. In the dramatisation, Holmes deduces that Wilder is the illegitimate son of the Duke of Holdernesse after comparing his features with those of each ancestral portrait in the Hall. Also, in this version, Wilder takes Lord Saltire as a hostage in a chase led by Holmes, the Duke and Watson through a cavern under the moor, known as the &quot;Cathedral&quot;. Having climbed to the top of a cliff-like structure with the boy, Wilder slips and falls to his death, while Lord Saltire is rescued. Later, the Duke volunteers a reward of £6,000 early on, but in the end, writes Holmes a cheque for £12,000 ().

===Radio===

&quot;The Priory School&quot; was dramatised by Edith Meiser as an episode of the American radio series &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. The episode aired on 4 May 1931, with Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson. A remake of the script aired in April 1933.

Meiser also adapted the story for the American radio series &quot;The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson. An episode adapted from the story aired in January 1940 and another aired in July 1943.

The story was adapted by Michael Hardwick as a radio production that aired on the BBC Light Programme in 1962, as part of the 1952–1969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson.

An adaptation aired on BBC radio in 1978, starring Barry Foster as Holmes and David Buck as Watson. The production was adapted by Michael Bakewell.

&quot;The Adventure of the Priory School&quot; was adapted as an episode of &quot;CBS Radio Mystery Theater&quot; titled &quot;The Vanishing Herd&quot;. The episode, which featured John Beal as Sherlock Holmes and Court Benson as Dr. Watson, first aired in January 1981.

&quot;The Priory School&quot; was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 1993, again by Michael Bakewell, as part of the 1989–1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson. It featured Norman Bird as Dr Huxtable and Nigel Davenport as the Duke.

A 2013 episode of &quot;The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, a series on the American radio show &quot;Imagination Theatre&quot;, was adapted from the story. John Patrick Lowrie played Holmes with Lawrence Albert as Watson.

<text>The Tallahatchie River is a river in Mississippi which flows from Tippah County, through Tallahatchie County, to Leflore County, where it joins the Yalobusha River to form the Yazoo River, which ultimately meets the Mississippi River at Vicksburg, Mississippi. The river is navigable for about . At Money, Mississippi, the river&#x27;s flow measures approximately per second.

&quot;Tallahatchie&quot; is a Choctaw name meaning &quot;rock of waters&quot;. The sources of the Tallahatchie River have outcrops of iron sandstone.

As part of the Flood Control Act of 1936, the federal government built an earth-filled flood control dam on the Tallahatchie near the town of Sardis, Mississippi, creating Sardis Lake.

==In popular culture==

The river is mentioned in &quot;Tallahatchie River Blues&quot;, recorded by Mattie Delaney in 1930. This blues song laments the devastation caused in the local African-American community by a flood on the normally shallow river. The river is deep with very sharp rocks.

The river has historical significance due to the 1955 murder of Emmett Till, an African-American boy visiting from Chicago, who was brutally murdered by white men in Money, Mississippi, for allegedly whistling at a white woman. In 2017, Till&#x27;s accuser, Carolyn Bryant Donham, spoke to Timothy B. Tyson, a Duke University professor who has written a book, &quot;The Blood of Emmett Till&quot;. In it, he wrote that Donham said of her long-ago allegations that Till grabbed her and was menacing and sexually crude toward her, &quot;that part is not true.&quot; Till was beaten, shot, and sunk in the river with a cotton gin fan tied around his neck by barbed wire. 

This event is mentioned in the song, &quot;Freedom Highway&quot; by the Staple Singers, in the lines, &quot;Found dead people in the forests, Tallahatchie River and lakes... whole world is wondering, what&#x27;s wrong with the United States?&quot; Till’s badly mutilated body was found near the river by two boys who were fishing.

The eponymous wooden bridge over the river was popularized in Bobbie Gentry&#x27;s 1967 hit song &quot;Ode to Billie Joe&quot;, which has the refrain, &quot;Billie Joe McAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie bridge.&quot; A film was titled &quot;Ode to Billy Joe&quot;. The wooden bridge collapsed in 1972 after being set alight by vandals. It crossed the Tallahatchie River at Money, Mississippi, about north of Greenwood, Mississippi. The bridge has since been replaced.

<doc id="1337709" wikidata="Q651872" url="?curid=1337709" title="William Houstoun (lawyer)">
<text>William Houstoun ( ; also spelled Houston; – March 17, 1813) was a Founding Father of the United States, statesman, and lawyer. He served the Province of Georgia as a delegate to the Continental Congress and later the State of Georgia to the United States Constitutional Convention in 1787.

==Early and personal life==
William Houstoun was born in Savannah, Georgia, the son of Sir Patrick Houstoun, 5th Baronet of Houstoun (–1762) and member of the council under the royal government of Georgia. Houstoun received a liberal education, which included legal training at Inner Temple in London.

Houstoun married Mary Bayard (born 1766), the daughter of Nicholas Bayard, a member of the prominent Bayard family of New York City, from which Bayard Street takes its name.

==Role in the Continental Congress==
The American Revolution cut short his training, and Houstoun returned home to Georgia. For many years members of Houstoun&#x27;s family had been high officials in the colony. With the onset of war, many remained loyal to the crown, but William, a zealous advocate of colonists&#x27; rights, was among the first to counsel resistance to British aggression.

Houstoun represented Georgia in the Continental Congress from 1783 through 1786. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives in 1789.

He was chosen as one of Georgia&#x27;s agents to settle a boundary dispute with South Carolina in 1785 and was one of the original trustees of the University of Georgia at Athens.

===Delegate to the Georgia Convention===
When the Constitutional Convention convened in 1787, Houstoun presented his credentials as one of Georgia&#x27;s delegates. He stayed for only a short time, from June 1 until about July 23, but he was present during the debate on the representation question. Houstoun split Georgia&#x27;s vote on equal representation in the Senate, voting &quot;nay&quot; against Abraham Baldwin&#x27;s &quot;aye.&quot; His fellow Georgia delegate William Pierce wrote of him: &quot;As to his legal or political knowledge, he has very little to boast of. Nature seems to have done more for his corporeal than mental powers. His Person is striking, but his mind very little improved with useful or elegant knowledge.&quot;

Houstoun also reportedly threatened to kill a reverend living in Rhode Island for making a critical remark about the South. Biographer Edith Duncan Johnston finds room for flattery despite this, writing: &quot;Loyal to his native state and section, he was quick to avenge any insinuation that reflected against either.&quot;

Pierce was also flexible in his assessment, or simply looking towards posterity, concluding Houstoun had &quot;good and honorable principles&quot; in his notes from the 1850s.

==Death and legacy==
Houstoun died in Savannah on March 17, 1813, and was interred in St. Paul&#x27;s Chapel in New York City.

Houston Street in the New York City borough of Manhattan, originally part of his father-in-law&#x27;s estate, was named for Houstoun, using an alternate spelling. Houston Street in Savannah is also named for him.

<doc id="1337716" wikidata="Q532033" url="?curid=1337716" title="Yusuf al-Khal">
<text>Yusuf al-Khal (; December 25, 1917 – March 9, 1987) was a Lebanese-Syrian poet, journalist, and publisher. He is considered the greatest exponent of avantgardist prose poetry (&quot;qaṣīdat al-natr&quot;) as well one of the pioneers of Arabic surrealist poetry.

With fellow poets Adonis and Ounsi el-Hajj, al-Khal founded the magazine &quot;Shi&#x27;r&quot; (&quot;Poetry&quot;) in Beirut in 1957, initiating a movement to modernize Arabic literature. His poetry has also been recognized in Near East poetry collections. He published many volumes of avant-garde poetry and translated Whitman, Eliot, Frost, and others.

Al-Khal was the son of a Lebanese Protestant minister and was Greek Orthodox. He was raised in Tripoli, Lebanon and made his career largely in Lebanon.

Between 1944 and 1948 al-Khal taught at the American University in Beirut, where he had previously studied under Charles Malik and did his bachelor&#x27;s degree in philosophy and English literature. He established the Dar al-Kitab in Beirut, and this house started its activities by publishing the magazine “Sawt a Woman”, which was edited by al-Khal, in addition to managing the house until 1948.

From 1948 to 1955 al-Khal lived in the US, where he worked for the United Nations as a journalist in the press and publishing department. He returned to Lebanon in 1955.

Al-Khal created the quarterly poetry magazine Shi&#x27;r that was published between 1957 and 1964. Then it resumed in the first of 1967. Its entire collection was reprinted in 11 volumes. In 1967, An-Nahar Publishing House was established, and he joined it as Editor-in-Chief. He established (1957–1959) a remarkable literary salon, the Salon of Poetry Magazine, known as the Salon of Thursday. The members of the salon included the poets Yusuf Al-Khal, Adonis, Shawqi Abi Chakra and Fouad Rebekah.

== Personal life ==
Al-Khal married Lebanese-American painter Helen Khal with whom he had sons Tarek and Jawad. He married for a second time to the Syrian artist Maha Bayrakdar in 1970. Maha was a well-known painter in Damascus and she worked for several years in Lebanese media. They had two children Yusuf and Ward, who later became popular TV stars in Lebanon.

<doc id="1337730" wikidata="Q2718922" url="?curid=1337730" title="The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton">
<text>&quot;The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton&quot; is one of the 56 Sherlock Holmes short stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. It was originally published in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; in the United States on 26 March 1904, and in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in the United Kingdom in April 1904. It is one of 13 stories in the cycle collected as &quot;The Return of Sherlock Holmes&quot; (1905).

== Timeline ==
According to William S. Baring-Gould&#x27;s timeline of the Sherlock Holmes canon, the events of &quot;Milverton&quot; occurred in 1899. Leslie S. Klinger also placed the story in 1899 in his timeline of the canon. This was nine years after the strange death of Charles Augustus Howell, the real-life inspiration for the character of Milverton (see below).

==Plot==

Holmes is hired by the débutante Lady Eva Blackwell to retrieve compromising letters from a blackmailer: Milverton, who causes Holmes more revulsion than any of the 50-odd murderers in his career. Milverton is &quot;the king of blackmailers&quot;. He demands £7,000 () for the letters, which if given to third parties would cause a scandal that would end Lady Eva&#x27;s marriage engagement. Holmes offers £2,000, all Lady Eva can pay, but Milverton insists on £7,000. It is worth £7,000 to him, he explains, to make an example of Lady Eva; it is in his long-term interest to ensure that his future blackmail victims would be more &quot;open to reason&quot; and pay him what he wants, knowing he will destroy them if they do not. Holmes resolves to recover the letters by whatever means necessary, as Milverton has placed himself outside the bounds of morality.

Holmes visits Milverton&#x27;s Hampstead house, disguised as a plumber, in order to learn the plan of the house and Milverton&#x27;s daily routine. He cultivates the acquaintance of Milverton&#x27;s housemaid and even becomes engaged to marry her. This rather shocks Watson, but Holmes assures him that he has a hated rival who will step in when the plumber disappears. Holmes has learned where Milverton keeps his blackmail papers (a safe in his study), and plans to burgle Milverton&#x27;s house that night. Watson comes along.
They break into the study, but just as Holmes opens the safe, Milverton enters the study, even though he should be in bed asleep. Holmes and Watson hide behind a curtain, while Milverton has a midnight meeting with a supposed maidservant offering to sell letters that would compromise her mistress.
The woman is actually one of Milverton&#x27;s former victims, whose broken-hearted husband died when she wouldn&#x27;t pay Milverton and he revealed her secret. Now she avenges her husband by shooting Milverton to death, then stamps on his face.

Watson instinctively begins to rush out and stop the shooting, but Holmes restrains him. Holmes understands, and Watson instantly realises, &quot;that it was no affair of ours; that justice had overtaken a villain...&quot; The woman runs away, and Milverton&#x27;s household is roused by the shots. During his final confrontation, Milverton&#x27;s entire cache of blackmail papers had been in a safe with its door slightly ajar. Holmes now feeds this mass of compromising material into Milverton&#x27;s burning fireplace, despite the risk of being discovered and caught.

Then Holmes and Watson escape through the garden and over the wall. Watson has to kick himself free from a pursuer who has grabbed his leg.

The next morning, Inspector Lestrade calls at Baker Street to ask for Holmes&#x27; help in investigating Milverton&#x27;s murder, which he ascribes to the two burglars seen escaping over the garden wall. He has a description of one of them: &quot;a middle-aged, strongly built man-square jaw, thick neck, moustache...&quot; Holmes calls the description vague, and even jokes that it could describe Watson, which amuses Lestrade. But Holmes refuses Lestrade&#x27;s request, stating that he sympathizes with the criminals rather than the victim.

Later, Holmes recognises the face of the woman who killed Milverton. He shows Watson her photograph displayed in a shop-window among those of other celebrities. Watson recognises the name of her famous husband, but Holmes signals silence with a finger to his lips. Watson assures his readers that the killer in question is beyond the reach of the law [i.e deceased] and that certain details have been disguised to hurt no one.

== Inspiration ==
The character of Charles Augustus Milverton was based on a real blackmailer, Charles Augustus Howell. He was an art dealer who preyed upon an unknown number of people, including the artist Dante Gabriel Rossetti.

Doyle&#x27;s literary inspiration often came from his natural interest in crime, and he had no tolerance for predators. Howell died in 1890 in circumstances as strange as any of Doyle&#x27;s novels: His body was found near a Chelsea public house with his throat posthumously slit, with a coin (variously reported as a sovereign or half-sovereign) in his mouth. The presence of the coin was understood to be a criticism of those guilty of slander.

&quot;The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton&quot; was also inspired by the A. J. Raffles short story &quot;Wilful Murder&quot; by E. W. Hornung, according to Richard Lancelyn Green.

==Publication history==
&quot;The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton&quot; was published in the US in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; on 26 March 1904, and in the UK in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in April 1904. The story was published with six illustrations by Frederic Dorr Steele in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;, and with seven illustrations by Sidney Paget in the &quot;Strand&quot;. It was included in the short story collection &quot;The Return of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, which was published in the US in February 1905 and in the UK in March 1905.

==Adaptations==

===Film and television===

The story was adapted as a short silent film titled &quot;Charles Augustus Milverton&quot; (1922) in the Stoll film series starring Eille Norwood as Sherlock Holmes.

The 1932 film &quot;The Missing Rembrandt&quot;, part of the 1931–1937 film series starring Arthur Wontner as Holmes, was loosely based on the story.

The story was faithfully adapted in the 1965 BBC series &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; with Douglas Wilmer as Holmes, and Barry Jones as Milverton. The only difference from the story is the identity of Milverton&#x27;s killer.

The Soviet television film series &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson&quot; featured the case under the name &quot;The King of Blackmail&quot;. It was the first of the three episodes concerning Professor Moriarty. Apparently, Milverton was a member of the gang, since certain papers were recovered from his office which helped implicate the Professor. The husband of the lady who kills Milverton is stated to be named Lord Christopher Huxley, aged 42, with Holmes reading an article about his death at the beginning of the episode. Holmes approaches the lady later to obtain the aforementioned papers which she took with her. Otherwise, it is faithful to the original.

The story was much extrapolated when adapted by screenwriter Jeremy Paul for Granada Television series &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; starring Jeremy Brett. It became the 1992 feature-length episode &quot;The Master Blackmailer&quot; and featured Robert Hardy as the eponymous reptilian Milverton. Holmes&#x27;s relationship with the maid is expanded upon, allowing Brett to suggest Holmes&#x27; buried tenderness and inability, or unwillingness, to indulge in matters of the heart. Milverton&#x27;s face is not shown until Watson meets him while viewing artwork at a gallery; prior to this, either Milverton is reading something, he is shown at a distance, or simply viewed from behind. The violence of the villain&#x27;s end, including the grisly grinding of the avenger&#x27;s heel into the dead Milverton&#x27;s bespectacled face, is faithfully adapted, but Holmes and Watson do not at the end gaze upon Milverton&#x27;s killer&#x27;s portrait, as the murderess is identified. Deviating from the original story, Holmes holds a very different opinion about the case&#x27;s end. He requests Watson not to chronicle the case, deeming it to have unpleasant circumstances, whereas in the original story Holmes is slightly more cheerful, as shown by his joking to Lestrade, which is omitted from this adaptation.

The &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Switch&quot; episode of the CBS crime drama &quot;Elementary&quot; loosely adapts the story, with Milverton as a professional blackmailer who contacts his &quot;clients&quot; and prevents his own exposure by informing them that he has an accomplice who will distribute the damaging material if Milverton is arrested. Milverton is brought to Holmes&#x27;s attention when he blackmails the family of a rape victim, the family being known to Holmes&#x27;s addiction sponsor. The case is complicated when Holmes witnesses Milverton&#x27;s murder while infiltrating his house to retrieve the incriminating footage. Holmes is compelled to locate Milverton&#x27;s accomplice, who has access to all of Milverton&#x27;s material and instructions to post it on the Internet if Milverton is caught or killed.

The third season of the BBC adaptation &quot;Sherlock&quot; features &#x27;Charles Augustus Magnussen&#x27;, portrayed by Lars Mikkelsen, as a primary antagonist. The episode &quot;His Last Vow&quot; aired 12 January 2014. In it, it is revealed that Charles Magnussen keeps the information with which he blackmails his victims in his own mind palace (inside his head), only occasionally acquiring hard copies when he has to. Despite Mycroft warning Sherlock to leave Magnussen alone as he is occasionally useful to the government, he is shot dead by Sherlock in order to free John from his power and guarantee Mary&#x27;s safety, as Sherlock realises by using his mind palace he has no actual evidence in the event of his death.

The episode &quot;The Adventure of the Portrait of a Teacher&quot; in the NHK puppetry television series &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; is loosely based on the story. In it, a portrait of history teacher Charles Augustus Milverton that Beppo draws in class is taken away by himself. Milverton is said to be the severest with pupils in Beeton School and Beppo requests Holmes to take it back. Holmes and Watson steal into the teacher&#x27;s room where they see a female pupil Agatha, who is tutored by Milverton privately because she is too nervous to attend class with other pupils. She tells them that he is kind and in fact they find Milverton, who goes back to his room for an shocking sight.

The episode &quot;The Phantom of Whitechapel Act 2&quot; of the Japanese animated series, &quot;Yuukoku no Moriarty&quot; (&quot;Moriarty the Patriot&quot;), introduces Charles Augustus Milverton as an antagonist. In the Phantom of Whitechapel story, a group of individuals murder prostitutes and blame the deeds on Jack the Ripper in hopes of starting a violent revolution to overthrow the government by sowing discord between Scotland Yard and a vigilante group of citizens. At the end of the story, the individuals are murdered by Moriarty, but it is revealed that Charles Augustus Milverton had secretly masterminded the plan. Milverton identifies Moriarty leaving the scene of the murders using a telescope and adds Moriarty&#x27;s name to a mysterious list.

===Radio and audio dramas===

A radio adaptation titled &quot;Charles Augustus Milverton&quot; aired as an episode of the American radio series &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. The episode, dramatised by Edith Meiser, aired on 18 May 1931, with Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson.

Meiser also adapted the story for the American radio series &quot;The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson. The episode, titled &quot;The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton&quot;, aired on 4 December 1939.

The story was combined with &quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot; for a radio adaptation titled &quot;Dr Watson Meets Mr Sherlock Holmes&quot;, which aired on the BBC Light Programme on 5 October 1954 as the first of a series of episodes featuring John Gielgud as Holmes and Ralph Richardson as Watson. The episode aired on NBC radio on 2 January 1955.

Another radio adaptation was made as part of a syndicated series, produced by Harry Alan Towers and starring John Gielgud as Holmes and Ralph Richardson as Watson.

Michael Hardwick adapted the story as a 1961 radio drama that aired on the BBC Light Programme, as part of the 1952–1969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson.

An audio drama based on the story was released in 1970 on LP record. Holmes was voiced by Robert Hardy (who later played Milverton in the 1992 television adaptation) and Watson was voiced by Nigel Stock (who also played Watson in the 1965 television adaptation). It was dramatised and produced by Michael Hardwick (who also adapted the 1961 radio adaptation) and Mollie Hardwick.

An adaptation of the story aired on BBC radio in 1978, starring Barry Foster as Holmes and David Buck as Watson.

&quot;Charles Augustus Milverton&quot; was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 1993 by Bert Coules as part of the 1989–1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson. It featured Peter Vaughan as Milverton.

The story was adapted as a 2008 episode of &quot;The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, a series on the American radio show &quot;Imagination Theatre&quot;, starring John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson. Charles Augustus Milverton was played by the creator of &quot;Imagination Theatre&quot;, Jim French.

===Other media===
The story, along with &quot;The Disappearance of Lady Frances Carfax&quot;, &quot;The Adventure of the Empty House&quot;, and &quot;The Red-Headed League&quot;, provided the source material for the play &quot;The Return of Sherlock Holmes&quot;.

In Gerald Lientz&#x27;s 1987 gamebook &quot;Death at Appledore Towers (Sherlock Holmes Solo Mysteries number 3)&quot; Watson&#x27;s cousin, a protégé of Holmes, investigates Milverton&#x27;s murder after Holmes has refused to do so.

In Donald Thomas&#x27;s collection of short stories, &quot;The Secret Cases of Sherlock Holmes&quot; (1997), Watson &quot;admits&quot; that Milverton was, in fact, an alias used for the real Charles Augustus Howell. The story also serves as the basis for Thomas&#x27;s short story in the collection of the same name, &quot;The Execution of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, in which Milverton&#x27;s brother Henry (and several other relatives of Holmes&#x27;s past adversaries) kidnap Holmes and stage a kangaroo court, putting Holmes &quot;on trial&quot; for the murder of Milverton.

One of the antagonists of &quot;The Great Ace Attorney&quot; is Ashley Milverton, alias Graydon, who steals and tries to sell secrets held by the British government.

In Moriarty the Patriot, a manga retelling of the Sherlock Holmes story, Milverton is an enemy of both Holmes and Professor Moriarty. In this adaptation, in addition to being the &quot;King of Blackmail&quot; he also plays a role similar to Moriarty, organising various crimes for unseemly patrons. This includes orchestrating the Jack the Ripper killings and forcing a beloved MP to commit murder. Ultimately, his plan brings Holmes, Moriarty, and himself into a confrontation, believing that he can use Holmes to eliminate Moriarty. Holmes however shoots and kills Milverton, much to his surprise.

<text>Ethel (also &quot;æthel&quot;) is an Old English word meaning &quot;noble&quot;, today often used as a feminine given name.

== Etymology and historic usage ==
The word means &quot;æthel&quot; &quot;noble&quot;.

It is frequently attested as the first element in Anglo-Saxon names, both masculine and feminine, e.g. Æthelhard, Æthelred, Æthelwulf; Æthelburg, Æthelflæd, Æthelthryth (Audrey). It corresponds to the &quot;Adel-&quot; and &quot;Edel-&quot; in continental names, such as Adolf (Æthelwulf), Albert (Adalbert), Adelheid (Adelaide), Edeltraut and Edelgard.

Some of the feminine Anglo-Saxon names in Æthel- survived into the modern period (e.g. Etheldred Benett 1776–1845). &quot;Ethel&quot; was in origin used as a familiar form of such names, but it began to be used as a feminine given name in its own right beginning in the mid-19th century, gaining popularity due to characters so named in novels by W. M. Thackeray (&quot;The Newcomes&quot; – 1855) and Charlotte Mary Yonge (&quot;The Daisy Chain&quot; whose heroine Ethel&#x27;s full name is Etheldred – 1856); the actress Ethel Barrymore – born 1879 – was named after &quot;The Newcomes&quot; character.

&quot;Notes &amp; Queries&quot; published correspondence about the name Ethel in 1872 because it was in fashion.

The feminine name&#x27;s popularity peaked in the 1890s. In the United States, it was the 7th most commonly given name for baby girls in the year 1894. Its use gradually declined during the 20th century, falling below rank 100 by 1940, and below rank 1000 in 1976.

Ethel was also occasionally used as a masculine given name during the 1880s to 1910s, but never with any frequency (never rising above rank 400, or 0.02% in popularity).

<doc id="1337757" wikidata="Q5152676" url="?curid=1337757" title="Commission of array">
<text>A commission of array was a commission given by English sovereigns to officers or gentry in a given territory to muster and array the inhabitants and to see them in a condition for war, or to put soldiers of a country in a condition for military service. The term arrayers is used in some ancient English statutes, for an officer who had a commission of array.

==History==
Commissions of array developed from the ancient obligation of all free men to defend their tribal lands. Commissioners were usually experienced soldiers, appointed by the crown to array able bodied men from each shire. By the time of the Wars of the Roses, conscript levies were less important than troops raised by indenture.

===Medieval examples===
*A Commission of Array was established in October 1403 by King Henry IV by letters patent to raise an army to resist the Welsh rebellion of Owain Glyndŵr, who had recently captured Newport Castle.
*In October 1473 there was a commission to oust the rebels who had entered St Michael&#x27;s Mount in Cornwall.

===Civil War revival===
Although long obsolete by the 17th century, the system was revived by King Charles I in 1642 at the start of the Civil War, in an unconstitutional manner, that is to say without Parliament having been consulted, in order to counteract the equally unconstitutional Militia Ordinance enacted by Parliament in 1642 without the usual Royal Assent. Both decrees tried to gain control of existing militia and to raise further troops. The Commission of Array issued by the king thus sought to muster a Royalist army. Commissioners were appointed for each county, generally from leading members of the local aristocracy and gentry who might be assumed to wield great influence over their feudal tenants and the population in general. The commissioners read out the text of their commission in public gatherings in the main towns. Often the local people suspected such innovative royal decrees, uncertain in precedent and purpose, to be designed for the general suppression of the people, and they were openly hostile. Opponents of the king, whilst playing down the role of the Militia Ordinance in augmenting civil strife, portrayed the Commission of Array as a sign that it was the king and not Parliament who was the real aggressor in the developing conflict.

====Devon====

28 Commissioners of Array were appointed in Devon on 19 July 1642, including:
*Henry Bourchier, 5th Earl of Bath
*Edward Chichester, 1st Viscount Chichester
*George Southcote of Buckland-Tout-Saints, appointed but apparently never acted as he was appointed Sheriff of Devon during the Commonwealth. Father of Thomas Southcote (c. 1622–1664), also of Buckland-Tout-Saints, MP.
*Sir John Acland, 1st Baronet (c. 1591–1647)

<text>Beshankovichy (; ; ) is an urban-type settlement in Vitebsk Region, Belarus. It serves as the administrative center of Beshankovichy District and is a port on the Western Dvina. It is located west-southwest of Vitebsk on the railway line between Orsha and Lyepyel. As of 2024, it has a population of 6,904.

== History ==
In the early 16th century, the small village was part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania ruled by the Drucki-Sokoliński princes. In 1552 it numbered 34 houses.

In 1630, the village was purchased by the Vilnius Voivode Kazimierz Leon Sapieha. It underwent rapid expansion and was granted Magdeburg rights in 1634. At that time, new stone houses were built and trade fairs were held semiannually, frequented by 4 to 5 thousand visitors from Belarus, Russia and abroad.

After the First Partition of Poland in 1772, control of the village was passed to the Russian Empire. By the end of the 18th century, Beshankovichy was a township of the Lepel Uyezd and later became the center of the volost.

According to the 1897 Russian census, the town&#x27;s population was 4,423 people, there were 1,099 buildings, a post office, a telegraph, a school, 3 people&#x27;s schools, 127 shops and a hospital.

At that time, Beshankovichy was a largely Jewish settlement, numbering 3,182 Jewish citizens in 1900. The Jewish Encyclopedia (published between 1901 and 1906), describes the town&#x27;s population as four fifths Jewish of whom 576 are artisans. The town had a synagogue, many houses of prayer, three benevolent societies, and numerous religious schools.

Under Soviet power, Beshankovichy became an urban settlement and was the center of the raion for several years. It later became part of Vitebsk Region.

===World War II===
In 1939, 1,119 Jews lived in the town, making up 26.3% of the total population. During the Second World War, Beshankovichy was under German military occupation from 6 July 1941 until 25 June 1944, and was almost entirely destroyed. 10,276 persons from Beshankovichy and the raion were massacred, including the entire Jewish population. A resident at the time of the German occupation recalled, &quot;One Jewish family that had not been taken to the ghetto was still living on my street. When the Jews were being gathered for the shooting, the Germans came to get this family. A little Jewish boy was hiding in the fireplace. The Germans found him and shot him right there, in the house.&quot;

According to an &quot;Einsatzgruppe&quot; report, 855 Jews were killed in the town on 11 February 1942, while the inscription on the monument erected on the site of the murders says that 1,068 citizens were killed that day. The town was recaptured on 25 June 1944 by the 1st Baltic Front.

<text>&quot;The Adventure of the Three Students&quot;, one of the 56 Sherlock Holmes short stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is one of 13 stories in the cycle collected as &quot;The Return of Sherlock Holmes&quot; (1905). It was first published in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in the United Kingdom in June 1904, and was also published in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; in the United States on 24 September 1904.

==Plot==

Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson find themselves in a university town when a tutor and lecturer of St Luke&#x27;s College, Mr. Hilton Soames, brings him an interesting problem. Soames had been reviewing the galley proofs of an exam he was going to give when he left his office for an hour. When he returned, he found that his servant, Bannister, had entered the room but accidentally left his key in the lock when he left, and someone had disturbed the exam papers on his desk and left traces that show it had been partially copied. Bannister is devastated and collapses on a chair, but swears that he did not touch the papers. Soames found other clues in his office: pencil shavings, a broken pencil lead, a fresh cut in his desk surface, and a small blob of black clay speckled with sawdust.

Soames wants to uncover the cheater and prevent him from taking the exam, since it is for a sizeable scholarship. Three students who will take the exam live above him in the same building. The first, Gilchrist, is athletic, being a hurdler and a long-jumper, and industrious (in contrast to his father who squandered his fortune in horse racing); the second, Daulat Ras, is described as quiet and methodical; the third is Miles McLaren, a gifted man but thoroughly dissolute and given to gambling.

Holmes examines the office. The cheater obviously took the papers over to the window one by one while he copied them so that he could see Soames returning, but as it happens, Soames did not come back the usual way. A nearby door leads to Soames&#x27;s bedroom. Upon examining that, Holmes finds another, similar, sawdust-speckled blob of clay. He stuns Soames by telling him that the cheater, upon hearing his approach, hid in Soames&#x27;s bedroom. He was there, hiding behind a curtain, all the time that Soames was questioning Bannister.

The next morning, Holmes and Watson return to Soames&#x27;s office. Holmes confronts Bannister, accusing him of withholding information. Bannister will not own up to anything, and insists that there was no one in Soames&#x27;s office while he was there. Holmes, however, sends for Gilchrist, and proceeds to lay out his results.
 The cheater was someone who knew the exam proofs were there. This could only be Gilchrist, because the proofs&#x27; whereabouts had been kept secret, and Gilchrist was the only one tall enough to look in through Soames&#x27;s window to see his desk. Holmes has also identified the blobs as the special clay found in the long-jump pit, further implicating Gilchrist. Gilchrist reveals his guilt by reproaching Bannister for his apparent treachery. Bannister was indeed the one who covered for Gilchrist. He felt that he had to, for old times&#x27; sake: Bannister was once Gilchrist&#x27;s father&#x27;s butler.

Holmes then explains the remaining clues. The scratch on the desk was caused by Gilchrist&#x27;s spiked jumping shoes as he grabbed them in his haste, and the clay blobs fell from his shoes. Bannister had collapsed in the chair to hide Gilchrist&#x27;s gloves, which he saw had been left on the chair. For his part, Gilchrist credits Bannister with convincing him not to profit from his misdeed, and presents Soames with a letter stating his wish not to sit the exam, but to instead accept an offer to work for the Rhodesian Police.

==Publication history==

&quot;The Adventure of the Three Students&quot; was published in the UK in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in June 1904, and in the US in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; on 24 September 1904. The story was published with seven illustrations by Sidney Paget in the &quot;Strand&quot;, and with nine illustrations by Frederic Dorr Steele in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;. It was included in the short story collection &quot;The Return of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, which was published in the US in February 1905 and in the UK in March 1905.

==Adaptations==
===Film===
A silent short film adapted from the story was released in 1923 as part of the Stoll film series starring Eille Norwood as Sherlock Holmes and Hubert Willis as Watson, with William Lugg as Hilton Soames and A. Harding Steerman as Bannister.

===Literature===
While the tale is not directly adapted, the novel &quot;The Thinking Engine&quot; by James Lovegrove is set around the time of these events, explaining that Holmes and Watson were in the unnamed university town mentioned here to compete against the titular Thinking Engine, which is essentially an apparent early computer capable of matching or even surpassing Holmes&#x27; deductive abilities (the novel concludes with the discovery that the &quot;Thinking Engine&quot; is actually a hollow construct with the still-living but crippled Professor Moriarty inside it).

===Radio and audio dramas===
A radio adaptation of &quot;The Adventure of the Three Students&quot;, dramatised by Edith Meiser, aired on 2 November 1931 in the American radio series &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, starring Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson.

Meiser also adapted the story as an episode of the American radio series &quot;The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson, that aired on 24 November 1940.

Felix Felton dramatised the story as a radio adaptation for the BBC Home Service as part of the 1952–1969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson, with Felton playing Hilton Soames. The adaptation aired in November 1957.

&quot;The Three Students&quot; was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 1993 by Denys Hawthorne (who also played Hilton Soames) as part of the 1989–1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson, with Desmond Llewelyn as Bannister.

The story was adapted as the second episode of &quot;The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, a series on the American radio show &quot;Imagination Theatre&quot;, starring John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson. The episode aired in 2006.

In 2024, the podcast Sherlock&amp;Co adapted the story in a two-episodes adventure called &quot;The Solitary Cyclist&quot;, starring Paul Waggot as Watson and Harry Attwell as Sherlock.

<doc id="1337779" wikidata="Q5028025" url="?curid=1337779" title="Campbell College">
<text>Campbell College located in Belfast, Northern Ireland and founded in 1894 comprises a preparatory school department (junior age) and a senior Northern Ireland &#x27;Voluntary Grammar&#x27; school, the latter meaning, in terms of provision of education, a government funded, selective school.

The school is one of a number of schools in the state funded grammar sector in Northern Ireland which can offer paid boarding places to some pupils, typically to be funded by the pupil, although the majority of pupils are day pupils.

It is one of the eight schools of Northern Ireland represented on the Headmasters&#x27; and Headmistresses&#x27; Conference and is a member of the Independent Schools Council.

==Legal status==

Campbell College is one of very few voluntary grammar schools in Northern Ireland entitled to be classified as a &#x27;Voluntary B&#x27; grammar school, where most voluntary grammars within this state sector are &#x27;Voluntary A&#x27;. Voluntary grammar schools, though state schools by educational funding, are each managed by independent educational charities on the privately owned grounds and infrastructure of those charities. The College&#x27;s &#x27;Voluntary B&#x27; designation enables this grammar school, which is state funded for education provision, to charge a degree of fees to pupils, separate completely to the education process, officially termed the &quot;capital fee&quot;. 
The capital fees charged to the grammar school pupils are purely for the upkeep of historic buildings and grounds and not for any part of the education. (Voluntary &#x27;B&#x27; grammars receive much less state capital funding for physical upkeep than other voluntary grammars.) At Campbell College the schooling itself in the grammar school does not come under fee-paying terms. In common with all other Northern Ireland grammar schools of all types, the schooling itself is taxpayer funded per pupil through the government authority for those successful in admission within the school&#x27;s own selection process.

==Location==
The school occupies a estate in east Belfast, close to the Parliament Buildings at Stormont. All the school&#x27;s facilities are located on this site, which also contains a small lake and forest named Netherleigh. 

Campbell&#x27;s junior school – formerly located on an adjacent site and called Cabin Hill – is now also located on the site. The school has the oldest Combined Cadet Force in Northern Ireland, with over 400 cadets. The school has an international reputation and attracts boarders from all over the world.

==History==
It was founded in 1894 with a bequest by Henry James Campbell, who made his fortune in the linen trade, and left money to found a school based on the values of a Liberal Protestant education. Initially the school was primarily a boarding school but it has, particularly since the 1970s, become primarily a day school; in 2009 it had 879 pupils, only about 85 (10%) of whom were boarders. As a selective independent school, it admits pupils based on academic selection. Until 2006 pupils began at the school at age 11, but since the closure of the school&#x27;s separate preparatory school, Cabin Hill, the school has accepted pupils from age 4 into the newly built Junior School, and both boys and girls into the school&#x27;s kindergarten located on the school&#x27;s grounds. The Latin motto of the school is &quot;Ne Obliviscaris&quot; (&quot;Do Not Forget&quot;).

In 1935 Jimmy Steele led an attempted Irish Republican Army raid on the school to secure the arms inside the college Officers&#x27; Training Corps. The RUC at Strandtown was tipped off and the raid was unsuccessful. A gun battle took place at the gate lodge on Hawthornden Road in which Constable Ian Hay received five gunshot wounds, but survived. In 1936 Steele and three other IRA members were captured, prosecuted and imprisoned in Crumlin Road Gaol.

Campbell lost 126 former students in World War I. During World War II the school was requisitioned by the War Office as a hospital, with the pupils transferred to Portrush, north Antrim. There are separate memorials to the dead of both World Wars in the Central Hall.

The author C.S. Lewis, who grew up nearby, attended the school for two months, but was withdrawn because of a serious respiratory illness and sent to Malvern (Cherbourg School), famous at the time for treating people with lung problems. The gas lamppost on the school drive is claimed to have been the inspiration for that mentioned in Lewis&#x27; &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;, though some sources state a lamppost in Crawfordsburn Country Park was the inspiration. Still others believe that the gas lamps in the lower area of the woods on the Malvern Hills above the town were his inspiration. Lewis claimed in his autobiography &quot;Surprised by Joy&quot; that Campbell retained the character of an English public school before to the reforms of Arnold.

Several Campbell students have been involved in filmmaking. These include William MacQuitty (&quot;A Night to Remember&quot;), Andrew Eaton (&quot;Resurrection Man&quot;), Nick Hamm (&quot;The Hole&quot;), Dudi Appleton (&quot;The Most Fertile Man in Ireland&quot;), and Mark Huffam (&quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;). A collection of Lepidoptera by Thomas Workman is displayed in the school.

On 27 October 2016, the President of Ireland, Michael D. Higgins visited Linen Hall Library for the first time. A choir combining students from Holy Cross Boys&#x27; Primary School and Campbell College performed at the special event.

==School houses==
Currently there are six houses for day boys and one boarding house and these form the focus for participation across the curriculum. School houses are named after former masters and those of importance in the life of the school and play an integral part in everyday life in the school. The names of the current houses and their respective colours are:

* Alden&#x27;s (dark green)
* Allison&#x27;s (light green, formerly brown)
* Davis&#x27;s (yellow)
* Dobbin&#x27;s (light blue)
* Price&#x27;s (dark blue)
* School House (boarding house) (black)
* Yates&#x27;s (red)

In the past there have been other Houses:
* Armour&#x27;s (grey)
* Bowen&#x27;s (maroon)
* Chase&#x27;s (orange)
* Lytle&#x27;s (dark green)
* Netherleigh (junior house) (light blue)
* Norwood (junior house) (dark green)
* Ormiston (junior house) (dark blue)
* Tweskard (junior house) (red)

Each house is run by a &quot;house master&quot; who is in charge of managing the house and overseeing the &quot;house tutors&quot;, all of whom have allocated year groups which they are responsible for. Each house has a designated student who is &quot;head of house&quot;, and they usually have a deputy. However, this is not always the case. The head of house, along with his deputy are sixth form students who have earned responsibility within the school, and it is common place for them to also be prefects, or so called &quot;peer mentors&quot;. These two students organise house sporting, charity and dramatic events, among various other things.

==Uniform==
School colours are black and white and/or green if one is awarded major honours which enables one to also acquire a green blazer accompanied by an optional green pullover. The school uniform consists of a black badged blazer, House tie (with colour representing house), black trousers, black shoes with an optional V-neck pullover.

==Sport==

The school has a strong record in rugby, having won the Ulster Schools Cup 24 times and shared the cup four times. In 2018 Campbell beat Royal School Armagh at Ravenhill.

The school has extensive sports facilities including rugby and football pitches, two water based hockey pitches, 25-metre indoor shooting range, four tennis courts, squash courts, a fitness suite, and a swimming pool. The 2006 opening of the new synthetic hockey pitches was marked with an exhibition match between the gold-winning 1988 Summer Olympics Great Britain and Northern Ireland hockey team and the school&#x27;s 1st XI, which ended 3–2 to the Olympic champions of old. The Campbellians Hockey Club play at this venue. 

==Colours==
A student can be awarded his &quot;colours&quot; as a tangible recognition of success achieved, dedication demonstrated and good example shown through the medium of any Campbell sport which participates in external/extramural competition, or through the College&#x27;s music and drama programme.

The Colours system is divided into two categories, that is, Major Colours and Club Colours:

* The award of Major Colours permits the successful recipient to wear a green blazer with appropriate badge, a major colours tie and a green V-neck pullover.
* Club Colours are denoted by a different pocket on the black school blazer, the pocket design reflecting the student’s preferred discipline.

As a rule of thumb, Major Colours for sporting activities are gained by those who have successfully represented their senior team or age group team, in their respective sport throughout the season of the award, while demonstrating a high level of performance and an approach which is both dedicated and a fine example to their peers.

The award of Club Colours has two main functions. Firstly, the Colour acts as a reward given to senior boys who have not necessarily represented one of our first teams, been placed highly in individual sports competition or excelled in the areas of music or drama, but whose dedication and loyalty to the schools’s curriculum is unquestionable. Secondly, this Colour may be awarded to younger students as recognition of their success at what might be considered to be the developmental stage of their school career.

Students are nominated for Major and Club Colours by the member of staff in charge of the given activity to the Colours Committee. The Colours Committee comprises teaching staff whose interests within our total curriculum are wide and whose experience is considerable. Following due consideration and deliberation, decisions made by the Colours Committee are taken by its chairman to the Headmaster for his agreement.

==Notable alumni==
Past pupils are known as Old Campbellians or OCs and the school has an extensive past pupil organisation known as The Old Campbellian Society which has several branches across the United Kingdom, USA and Asia as well as regular OC reunions at the school itself. The school colours are black and white, whilst the OC colours are black, white and green.

<text>&quot;The Adventure of the Golden Pince-Nez&quot;, one of the 56 Sherlock Holmes short stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is one of 13 stories in the cycle collected as &quot;The Return of Sherlock Holmes&quot; (1905). It was first published in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in the United Kingdom in July 1904, and was also published in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; in the United States in October 1904.

==Plot==
One wretched November night, Inspector Stanley Hopkins visits Holmes at 221B Baker Street to discuss the violent death of Willoughby Smith, secretary to aged invalid Professor Coram. Coram had dismissed his previous two secretaries. The murder happened at Yoxley Old Place near Chatham, Kent, the fatal weapon being a sealing-wax knife belonging to the professor. Hopkins can identify no motive for the killing, with Smith having no enemies or trouble in his past. Smith was found by Coram&#x27;s maid, who recounts his last words as &quot;The professor; it was she.&quot;

The maid further told Hopkins that before the murder, she heard Smith leave his room and walk down to the study; she had been hanging curtains and did not see him, only recognising his brisk step. The professor was in bed at the time. A minute later, a hoarse scream issued from the study, and the maid, hesitating briefly, entered and found the murder. She later tells Holmes that Smith went out for a walk not long before the murder.

The murderer&#x27;s only likely means of entry was through the back door after walking along the path from the road, and Hopkins found some indistinct footmarks running beside the path, the murderer obviously seeking to leave no trail. Hopkins could not tell whether the track was coming or going, nor whether made by big or small feet.

The professor&#x27;s study contained a bureau; nothing seemed to have been stolen. Its drawers were left open, as was normal, and the cupboard in the middle was locked. The professor kept the key.

A lone piece of evidence was found in Willoughby Smith&#x27;s hand: a pair of golden pince-nez spectacles. Holmes examines these and from them alone deduces the following details of the murderer:
*It is a woman;
*She is of some good breeding;
*She dresses like a lady;
*She is a person of refinement and is well dressed;
*She has a thick nose;
*Her eyes are close together;
*She has a puckered forehead, a peering look, and likely rounded shoulders;
*She has been to an optician at least twice over the last few months.

Holmes, Dr. Watson, and Hopkins head to Yoxley the next morning, and Holmes carefully examines the site. In the study, he notices a recent scratch on the bureau and reasons the murderer intended to access its contents. Smith was killed as his presence interfered with the burglary. No-one saw the murderer leave, nor did anyone hear a door opening. Holmes notes that both the corridors, the one leading from the back door and the one leading to the professor&#x27;s bedroom, are about the same length and lined with coconut matting.

Holmes interviews the professor in his bedroom, smoking many Egyptian cigarettes and dropping the ashes all over the floor. The professor claims utter ignorance regarding the murder and ventures that Smith&#x27;s death may be suicide. Holmes asks about the locked cupboard in the bureau. The professor hands over the key. Holmes inspects the key and returns it immediately, leaving the bureau sealed.

Watson asks Holmes if he has a clue, and Holmes tells him the cigarette ashes might reveal the truth. Holmes meets the housekeeper in the garden and has a seemingly unimportant conversation about the professor&#x27;s eating habits; apparently, he has eaten heavily today. In the afternoon, the three men return to the professor in his room, and Holmes deliberately knocks the cigarettes over as an excuse to get a closer look at the floor. Holmes&#x27; suspicion is confirmed – there are footprints in the ash. At that moment, the murderer, appearing exactly as Holmes deduced, emerges from a hiding place in a bookcase.

The mystery&#x27;s explanation is revealed as: the woman came in secret to the professor&#x27;s house to obtain some documents, using a duplicate key she gained from one of the former secretaries. She was surprised by Smith, whom she attacked with the nearest object to hand, the sealing-wax knife; she had not intended to kill him. She lost her pince-nez in the scramble to escape; unable to see clearly, she turned along the wrong corridor and wound up in the professor&#x27;s room. Although surprised, he hid her. The murderer is, in fact, the professor&#x27;s estranged wife, Anna, and they are both Russian. Years prior, the pair had been involved with nihilists; she and a non-violent nihilist friend were both betrayed by the professor for gain. Having finished her jail sentence in Siberia, Anna came in search of evidence that would exonerate her friend.
Anna had met Smith while he was taking his walk, explaining Smith&#x27;s last words. The professor&#x27;s increased appetite is, of course, explained by his having to feed a second, hidden person. Shortly after the final revelations, Anna dies from poison she took while in hiding. Her last wish is to ask Holmes to deliver the documents to the Russian Embassy, which he duly fulfills.

&quot;The Adventure of the Golden Pince-Nez&quot; was published in the UK in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in July 1904, and in the US in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; on 29 October 1904. The story was published with eight illustrations by Sidney Paget in the &quot;Strand&quot;, and with six illustrations by Frederic Dorr Steele in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;. It was included in the short story collection &quot;The Return of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, which was published in the US in February 1905 and in the UK in March 1905.

==Adaptations==

===Film and television===
A short silent film adapted from the story was released in 1922 as part of the Stoll film series starring Eille Norwood as Sherlock Holmes and Hubert Willis as Watson, with Teddy Arundell as Inspector Hopkins, Norma Whalley as Anna Coram, and Cecil Morton York as Professor Coram. An extensively restored copy was scheduled to be shown during the 2024 BFI London Film Festival.

The television adaptation with Jeremy Brett, in the Granada TV television series &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;, differs slightly. A heavily bearded member of the Russian Brotherhood lurks in the garden, and administers final justice to the villainous Professor. Anna&#x27;s key was her own original. Dr. Watson is replaced by Sherlock Holmes&#x27;s brother, Mycroft Holmes, due to the unavailability of Edward Hardwicke for the episode and, instead of Sherlock Holmes dropping cigarette ash on the floor, Mycroft scatters snuff. During Holmes&#x27; brother&#x27;s investigation at the crime scene with Inspector Hopkins, Sherlock Holmes mumbles about the irony that their father gave his magnifying glass to Mycroft who has always been depicted as lazy and lethargic. Also, Mycroft Holmes remarks that their father always told them, &quot;eliminate the impossible, and whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth&quot;. He then adds, &quot;I forget his exact words, but those are near enough.&quot;

===Radio and audio dramas===
A radio adaptation of the story, dramatised by Edith Meiser, aired on 1 June 1931 in the American radio series &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, starring Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson.

Meiser also adapted the story as an episode of the American radio series &quot;The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson, that aired on 12 February 1940. Another episode in the same series was adapted from the story by Max Ehrlich, and aired in April 1949 (with John Stanley as Holmes and Wendell Holmes as Watson).

John Gielgud played Holmes and Ralph Richardson played Watson in a radio adaptation that aired on NBC radio in April 1955. In the radio adaptation (also known as &quot;The Yoxley [or Yatsley] Case&quot;), Anna kills herself with a pistol rather than by poison.

Michael Hardwick dramatised the story as a radio adaptation for the BBC Light Programme, as part of the 1952–1969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson, with Andreas Malandrinos as Professor Coram. The adaptation aired in August 1962.

&quot;The Golden Pince-Nez&quot; was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 1993 by Peter Ling as part of the 1989–1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson, featuring Maurice Denham as Professor Coram and Maureen O&#x27;Brien as the Lady. At the end, while in custody, Anna jumps in front of a train, and Holmes remarks that this is how Anna Karenina dies.

The story was adapted as a 2010 episode of &quot;The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, a series on the American radio show &quot;Imagination Theatre&quot;, starring John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson.

In 2023, the podcast Sherlock&amp;Co adapted the story in a three-episodes adventure called &quot;The Golden Pince-Nez&quot;, starring Paul Waggot as Watson and Harry Attwell as Sherlock.

<text>The empress of Japan is the title given to the wife of the Emperor of Japan or a female ruler in her own right. The current empress consort is Empress Masako, who ascended the throne with her husband on 1 May 2019.

==Empress regnant==

===Titles===

* &quot;Josei Tennō&quot; (女性天皇, lit. &quot;female heavenly emperor&quot;) or &quot;Jotei&quot; (, lit. &quot;female emperor&quot;) – Because there is no feminine equivalent to king and emperor in East Asian languages, different titles are used for female monarchs and female consorts. &quot;Josei Tennō&quot; refers only to an empress regnant of Japan, and &quot;Jotei&quot; refers to an empress regnant of any countries.
* &quot;Tennō&quot; (天皇, lit. &quot;heavenly emperor&quot;) or &quot;Kōtei&quot; (皇帝, lit. &quot;emperor&quot;) – Unlike European languages, in East Asia, the titles of female monarchs can also be abbreviated as &quot;king&quot; or &quot;emperor&quot;, much like their male counterparts. However, to avoid confusion with male monarchs, they are usually referred to as &quot;female king&quot; or &quot;female emperor&quot;.

===List of empresses regnant===
There were eight female imperial reigns (six empresses regnant including two who reigned twice) in Japan&#x27;s early history between 593 and 770, and two more in the early modern period (Edo period). Although there were eight reigning empresses, with only one exception their successors were selected from amongst the males of the paternal Imperial bloodline. After many centuries, female reigns came to be officially prohibited only when the Imperial Household Law was issued in 1889 alongside the new Meiji Constitution.

The eight historical empresses regnant are:

* Nukatabe, Empress Suiko (推古天皇 Suiko Tennō) was the 33rd empress of Japan from 593 until 628, according to the traditional order of succession, and the first historically attested woman to hold this position. She was the granddaughter of Tashiraga of Yamato, herself sister of the childless Emperor Buretsu, transferring some legitimacy in succession to the throne of Yamato to her husband Emperor Keitai. Tashiraga&#x27;s mother had been Kasuga of Yamato, sister of the childless Emperor Seinei, whose own marriage with the future Emperor Ninken had a similar effect a generation earlier. According to legends, these ladies descended from the legendary Empress Jingū, who had been ruler (since Meiji-era rewrites of history, Regent) of Yamato for decades at some time in the past, probably in the mid-4th century (if she really existed), and who herself descended, according to legends, from Amaterasu omikami, the Sun Goddess of the Japanese pantheon.
* Takara, Empress Kōgyoku (皇極天皇 Kōgyoku Tennō), also Empress Saimei (斉明天皇 Saimei Tennō) was the 35th and 37th empress of Japan, initially from February 18, 642, to July 12, 645, ascending upon the death of her uncle Emperor Jomei (who had also been her second husband). When she abdicated, her own younger brother succeeded her. However, upon the death of the said younger brother, she reascended the throne as Empress Saimei on February 14, 655, and ruled until her death on August 24, 661. She was succeeded by her and Emperor Jomei&#x27;s son, Naka no Ōe, as Emperor Tenji.
* Unonosasara, Empress Jitō (持統天皇 Jitō Tennō) was the 41st imperial ruler of Japan, and ruled from 686 until 697. The previous emperor was her uncle and husband, Emperor Tenmu, and she later abdicated the throne to her grandson Emperor Monmu.
* Ahe, Empress Genmei (also Empress Genmyō; 元明天皇 Genmei Tennō) was the 43rd imperial ruler of Japan ruling 707–715 (died December 7, 721). She was Empress Jitō&#x27;s younger half-sister and the mother of Emperor Monmu, who died in an young age.
* Hitaka, Empress Genshō (元正天皇 Genshō Tennō) was the 44th monarch of Japan (715–724). She succeeded after her mother Empress Genmei and later abdicated to her nephew Emperor Shōmu, son of Emperor Monmu.
* Abe, Empress Kōken (孝謙天皇 Kōken Tennō) also Empress Shōtoku (称徳天皇 Shōtoku Tennō) was the 46th imperial ruler of Japan from 749 to 758, and the 48th from 764 to 770. Her posthumous name for her second reign (764–770) was Empress Shōtoku. She never married and her ex-crown prince was Prince Bunado, her first cousin twice removed, but after her death, another of her cousins ascended the throne as Emperor Kanmu, who was also her brother-in-law.
* Okiko, Empress Meishō (明正天皇 Meishō Tennō) was the 109th empress of Japan, reigning from December 22, 1629, to November 14, 1643. She ascended upon the abdication of her father, being the eldest surviving child of her parents (the empress, Tokugawa Masako, had only four daughters without surviving sons), holding priority over her younger half-brothers.
* Toshiko, Empress Go-Sakuramachi (後桜町天皇 Go-Sakuramachi Tennō) was the 117th empress of Japan, and ruled from September 15, 1762, to January 9, 1771. She abdicated in favor of her young nephew. Surviving over forty years, the retired Empress held all those decades the position of Dajo Tenno, and acted as sort of guardian of subsequent emperors.

Other than the eight historical empresses regnant, two additional empress are traditionally believed to have reigned, but historical evidence for their reigns is scant and they are not counted among the officially numbered Emperors/Empresses regnant:

* Empress Jingū r. 206–269 (Empress Consort of Emperor Chūai)—not counted among the officially numbered Emperors
* Princess Iitoyo: Imperial princess and possibly empress regnant. She was baptized as Empress Tsunuzashi in the list of emperors of Japan.

Under Shinto religious influence, the goddess Amaterasu, who is of the highest rank in the &quot;kami&quot; system, might suggest that Japan&#x27;s first rulers were women. According to the and &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; chronicles in Japanese mythology, the Emperors of Japan are considered to be direct descendants of Amaterasu.

==Empress consort==
===Titles===
* &quot; (皇后) – It is the title of a non-reigning empress consort. The title, still in use, is generally conferred on an emperor&#x27;s wife who had given birth to the heir to the throne. The title was first awarded posthumously in 806 to the late mother of Emperor Heizei. In ancient Japan, most of the empresses consort were princesses, except for Iwa no hime (empress consort of Nintoku). After Empress Kōmyō (empress consort of Shōmu), daughters of the Fujiwara clan or other clans could become empresses consort.
* &quot;Kōtaigō&quot; (皇太后) – Empress Mother/Empress Dowager
* &quot;Tai-Kōtaigō&quot; (太皇太后) – Grand Empress Mother/Grand Empress Dowager
* &quot;&quot; (中宮) – It was a term that evolved during the Heian period; and it came to be understood as the title of the empress. For a time, &quot;Chūgū&quot; replaced &quot;Kōgō&quot;; and then the titles became interchangeable. The numbers of &quot;Kōgō&quot; varied, but there was only one &quot;Chūgū&quot; at a time. Originally, Chūgū (中宮) referred to the palace of the Kōgō (皇后), Kōtaigō (皇太后), or Tai-Kōtaigō (太皇太后). Until the mid-Heian Period, the emperor had only one empress consort, and the empress consort was also called Chūgū. From the time of Emperor Ichijō, when emperors had two empresses consort, one of them came to be called Kōgō and another one was called Chūgū.
* &quot;&quot; (准母立后) – It means individuals elevated to the rank of empress due to their position as honorary mother of the emperor. After maiden Princess Yasuko became empress as the honorary or adoptive mother of Emperor Horikawa, maiden princesses could also become empress.
* &quot;Zōkō&quot; (贈后) – It means individuals that were given the title of empress posthumously.
* &quot; (上皇后) – Empress Emerita
* &quot; (后位) – was an ancient title for empress consort or empress dowager. The definitions were laid down in the &quot;Ritsuryō&quot; code. Use during the Heian period is exemplified for example for the character Kiritsubo Consort (桐壺更衣, &quot;Kiritsubo no Kōi&quot;) in &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot;. The title &quot;Kōi&quot; later gave way for &quot;Kōgō&quot; (皇后) for the empress consort to avoid confusion.

<text>&quot;The Adventure of the Missing Three-Quarter&quot;, one of the 56 Sherlock Holmes short stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is one of 13 stories in the cycle collected as &quot;The Return of Sherlock Holmes&quot; (1905). It was originally published in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in the United Kingdom in August 1904, and was also published in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; in the United States on 26 November 1904.

==Plot==

Mr. Cyril Overton of Trinity College, Cambridge, comes to Sherlock Holmes seeking his help in Godfrey Staunton&#x27;s disappearance. Staunton is the star player on Overton&#x27;s rugby union team (who plays at the three-quarters position, hence the story&#x27;s title) and they will likely lose an important match the following day against Oxford if Staunton cannot be found. Holmes has to admit that amateur sport is outside his field, but he shows the same care he has shown to his other cases.

Staunton had seemed a bit pale and bothered earlier in the day. Later in the evening, according to a hotel porter, a rough-looking, bearded man came to the hotel with a note for Staunton; judging from the young man&#x27;s reaction, the note contained rather devastating news. He immediately left the hotel with the bearded stranger; the two of them were last seen running in the direction of the Strand at about half past ten. No one has seen them since.
Overton has wired to Cambridge, but Staunton has not been seen there. He has also wired Lord Mount-James, Staunton&#x27;s very wealthy uncle and nearest living relative, but has heard no answer. Staunton is the almost-eighty-year-old Lord Mount-James&#x27;s heir, but he must meanwhile live in relative poverty owing to his uncle&#x27;s miserly behaviour. 

Holmes further questions the porter. The bearded man who brought the note was neither a gentleman nor a workman, and he seemed to be bothered by something too, for his hand was trembling as he handed Staunton the note. The only word that the porter overheard of their short conversation was &quot;time&quot;. Earlier in the evening, at six o&#x27;clock, the porter had brought Staunton a telegram, and saw Staunton write a reply. Staunton told the porter that he would send it himself. Holmes looks at the telegraph forms in Staunton&#x27;s room, and then at the blotter, finally finding a clue. The impression on the blotter yields a part of the message that Staunton sent: &quot;Stand by us for God&#x27;s sake&quot;. Obviously at least one other person is involved (&quot;us&quot;), and there is some kind of danger. 

Lord Mount-James briefly visits, but can give Holmes no useful information as to his nephew&#x27;s whereabouts. The old miser seems utterly aghast at the possibility that it might be a kidnapping whose object would be to extort his wealth. Holmes and Watson then go to the telegraph office, where Holmes uses a ruse to get the woman there to show him the counterfoil of the message that Staunton sent. It was addressed to Dr. Leslie Armstrong, a medical academic at Cambridge.
Holmes and Watson go to see Armstrong, who tells them that Staunton is an intimate friend of his. He does not react when told that Staunton has disappeared, and claims not to know where he is, and not to have seen him recently. However, when Holmes produces one of Staunton&#x27;s papers sent by Armstrong, Armstrong furiously refuses to answer any more questions, denies that he had the telegram from Staunton, and has his butler show Holmes and Watson out. Holmes deduces that Armstrong must know where Staunton is, and lodges at an inn just across the street from Armstrong&#x27;s office to keep watch.

Holmes learns that Armstrong, although not in actual medical practice, regularly rides in his brougham out into the country somewhere. The round trip seems to take about three hours. Holmes tries following the brougham on one of its outings, but is thwarted by Dr. Armstrong, who makes it quite clear that he is aware that Holmes is following him. The next day, Holmes&#x27;s inquiries in all the local villages come to naught; no one has seen the doctor&#x27;s brougham passing through.

The mystery is at last unlocked by Pompey, a beagle-foxhound cross. After Holmes covertly sprays aniseed oil onto the wheels of the doctor&#x27;s brougham, Pompey tracks it to a cottage in the countryside. What Holmes finds there is not pleasant. Staunton is there, but is grieving over his young wife, who has just died of consumption. Her existence was kept secret, because Lord Mount-James would not have approved of the marriage and would have disowned his nephew. Armstrong had told the woman&#x27;s father about her condition, and he, the bearded stranger, had unwisely told Staunton, who felt compelled to rush off forthwith.

Holmes tells Armstrong that as long as there is no foul play involved, private affairs are not his business. He and Watson then depart, leaving Staunton to his grief.

<doc id="1337799" wikidata="Q2360365" url="?curid=1337799" title="The Adventure of the Abbey Grange">
<text>&quot;The Adventure of the Abbey Grange&quot;, one of the 56 Sherlock Holmes short stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is one of 13 stories in the cycle collected as &quot;The Return of Sherlock Holmes&quot; (1905). It was first published in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in the United Kingdom in September 1904, and was also published in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; in the United States on 31 December 1904.

==Plot==
Sherlock Holmes wakes up Dr. Watson early one winter morning to rush to a murder scene at the Abbey Grange near Chislehurst, Kent. Sir Eustace Brackenstall has been killed, apparently by burglars. Inspector Stanley Hopkins believes that it was the infamous Randall gang who have committed several other burglaries in the neighbourhood.

At Abbey Grange, Lady Brackenstall tells Holmes that her marriage was not happy; Sir Eustace was a violent, abusive drunkard. She then tells that about 11 o&#x27;clock, in the dining room, she encountered an elderly man coming in the French window, followed by two younger men. The older man struck her in the face, knocking her out. When she came to, she was gagged and tied to an oaken chair with the bellrope, which they had torn down. Sir Eustace came into the room and rushed at the intruders, one of whom struck and killed him with a poker. Lady Brackenstall fainted again for a minute or two. She saw the intruders drinking wine from a bottle taken from the sideboard. Then they left, taking some silver plate.

Sir Eustace&#x27;s corpse is still lying at the murder scene. Hopkins tells Holmes some unsavoury things about Sir Eustace: that he poured petroleum over his wife&#x27;s dog and set it alight, and once threw a decanter at her maid Theresa. Theresa corroborates Lady Brackenstall&#x27;s account of Sir Eustace being an abusive alcoholic.
Examining the bellrope, Holmes notes that if it was tugged hard enough to tear it down, the bell would have rung in the kitchen, and asks why nobody heard it. Hopkins answers that it was late, and the kitchen is at the back of the house, where none of the servants would have heard. This suggests that the burglars must have known this, indicating a link between them and one of the servants. Oddly, the thieves stole only a few items of silver plate from the dining room. The half-empty wine bottle and glasses interest Holmes – the cork had been drawn with the corkscrew of a &quot;multiplex knife&quot;, not the long corkscrew in the drawer, and one of the glasses has beeswing dregs in it, but the others have none.

Annoyed at being called to investigate a case that apparently has a ready-made solution, Holmes decides to catch the train back to London. However, after having mulled things over during the journey, Holmes thinks that Lady Brackenstall&#x27;s story has too many holes in it and that probably she and Theresa have lied deliberately, staging a false crime scene. Upon returning to the Abbey Grange, Holmes, after examining again the supposed crime scene, reaches this conclusion: the killer cut the bellrope with a knife, and frayed the loose end to make it look broken. Holmes confronts Lady Brackenstall and Theresa, telling them he knows they are lying and demanding the truth, but they stand by their story. On the way out, Holmes notices a hole in the ice on the pond, and writes a note for Hopkins.

Holmes searches for the killer: almost certainly a sailor (indicated by the knots and the active physique) who was previously acquainted with Lady Brackenstall, and whom she and Theresa would protect. Lady Brackenstall travelled by the ocean liner &quot;Rock of Gibraltar&quot; of the Adelaide-Southampton Line, which is now halfway to Australia. However, the ship&#x27;s first officer, Jack Crocker, who has been promoted to captain, has remained in England and in two days will take command of the company&#x27;s new ship, &quot;Bass Rock&quot;. Holmes takes a cab to Scotland Yard but does not go in. He tells Watson he is reluctant to name the criminal to the police until he knows more.

That evening, Hopkins calls at 221B Baker Street, with two items of news:

* As suggested in Holmes&#x27; note, the stolen silver was found at the bottom of the pond. Holmes suggests that the theft was a blind—a deliberate false clue. However, Hopkins rationalises that the pond was chosen as a temporary hiding place.
* The Randall gang was arrested in New York that morning, so they couldn&#x27;t have committed a murder in Kent the previous night.
Later that evening, Captain Crocker comes to Baker Street, summoned by a telegram from Holmes. Holmes demands a full account of what happened at the Abbey Grange, warning Crocker that Holmes will summon the police if he lies or conceals anything.

Crocker met a woman named Mary (Lady Brackenstall) on the voyage from Australia. He fell in love with her, but not she with him. Then he happened to meet Theresa, who told him of Sir Eustace&#x27;s abusive behaviour. He met secretly with Mary at the house; the last time on the previous night. They were in the dining room when Sir Eustace burst in, insulted Mary, and struck her with a cudgel. He then attacked Crocker, who killed him with the poker in self-defence. To avoid the scandal that could ensue, Crocker and Theresa concocted the cover story of burglars caught in the act. He cut down the bellrope exactly as Holmes deduced; he opened the wine bottle with his pocket knife&#x27;s corkscrew; he took some silver plate and dropped it in the pond. Crocker adds that he has no regrets whatsoever. 

Holmes tells Crocker that the police don&#x27;t yet know the truth, and that he will wait 24 hours before revealing it, allowing Crocker to get away. Crocker indignantly refuses the offer, insisting that he will only agree to any version of the case that will leave Mary out of it. But Holmes was only testing Crocker, and is impressed by his loyalty to Mary. He has given Hopkins &quot;an excellent hint&quot; and doesn&#x27;t feel he must do more. He designates Watson as the &quot;jury&quot;, and asks him to &quot;render a verdict.&quot; Watson declares Crocker &quot;not guilty.&quot; Holmes tells Crocker he will keep silent unless someone else is charged, and that he may come back to Mary in a year.

<doc id="1337811" wikidata="Q6527355" url="?curid=1337811" title="Leper Chapel, Cambridge">
<text>The Leper Chapel, also known as the Leper Chapel of St Mary Magdalene, is a chapel on the east side of Cambridge, England, off Newmarket Road close to the railway crossing at Barnwell Junction. It dates from about 1125.

The chapel was part of the buildings of a leper hospital that stood a little beyond the outskirts of the city on the road to Bury St Edmunds. Parts of the east wall are original, but most of the rest of the chapel was rebuilt in the 13th century. It still retains many Romanesque features.

In 1199 the chapel was given royal dispensation by King John to hold a three-day fair in order to raise money to support the lepers. Starting in 1211, the fair took place around the Feast of the Holy Cross (14 September) on Stourbridge Common which lies a little way behind the chapel and continues down to the River Cam.

Stourbridge fair grew to become the largest Medieval fair in Europe and raised so much money that the post of priest at the Leper Chapel became one of the most lucrative jobs in the English church. The job was also a sinecure, since the leper hospital had ceased to admit new lepers in 1279, and what few lepers remained were moved to a new colony near Ely. The chapel had no parish, so there was no need to maintain any religious services. Under legislation of 1546, the chapel was closed and its property assumed by the Crown. Town and University battled over the rights to the Fair until Queen Elizabeth I ruled in favour of the town, reserving the University&#x27;s rights to control weights, measures and quality of goods. The chapel was thence used only to store the stalls for the next fair and, in the eighteenth century at least, as a pub during the Fair. After 1751, there were no further religious services held at the chapel. In 1783 it was advertised for sale as a storage shed. The fair was abolished in 1933, though it was later revived in the 21st century and is now held annually at the Leper Chapel.

In 1816, the Chapel was bought and restored by Thomas Kerrich. Kerrich gave the Chapel to the University, which in turn gave it to the Cambridge Preservation Society in 1951.

The chapel is a Grade I listed building and is maintained by Cambridge Past, Present and Future (CPPF). It is again being used for worship and it is now part of the Parish of Christ the Redeemer. The &quot;Friends of the Leper Chapel&quot; was formed in 1999 to promote use of this chapel for education, cultural events and worship. The chapel also plays host to a range of local cultural activities such as dramatic performances, and it is frequently used by the local theatre group In Situ for their performances of Shakespeare.

<text>Odysseas Angelis (; 12 February 1912 – 22 March 1987) was a Greek nationalist military officer of the Artillery [Reg. Number 19386]. He reached the rank of four star General and served as Chief of the Greek Armed Forces and Vice President of the Hellenic Republic. He supported the military regime that was established on April 21, 1967.

General Aggelis was born on 12 February 1912, in a hut next to the chapel of Agia Anna in the village of Halia (now called Drosia) in the prefecture of Euboea. He committed suicide by hanging on March 22, 1987, in Korydallos Prison, cell no 48, where he was serving sentence. His funeral took place at the Agioi Theodoroi cemetery in Ano Steni, Euboea (the village he grew up) and was buried in a modest grave in line with his request. 

He was not married and had no descendants.

==Biography==
===Early career===
Angelis was born in the village of Steni on the island of Euboea in 1912. After completing his studies at the Hellenic Army Academy, he was sworn in as an Artillery Second Lieutenant on 2 August 1934. Promoted to Lieutenant in 1937 and Captain in 1940, he participated in the Greco-Italian War as a mountain artillery battery commander. Following the German invasion and the Axis occupation of Greece, in 1943 Angelis fled the country and joined the Greek Armed Forces in the Middle East, where he commanded an anti-aircraft battery.

After the liberation of Greece he was promoted to Major in 1946, and fought in the Greek Civil War in 1948 and 1949 as an artillery battalion commander. After the end of the civil war, he served in various artillery commands and completed courses at the Superior War School and the National Defence School. He served in the NATO headquarters at İzmir, as aide-de-camp to King Paul, professor at the Superior War School, chief of staff of the 9th Infantry Division, commandant of the Artillery School, Director of the 2nd Staff Bureau at the Hellenic Army General Staff, chief of staff of ASDEN, and deputy commander and commander of the 5th Infantry Division. He was promoted to Lt. Colonel in 1950, Colonel in 1958, Brigadier in 1960, and Major General in 1965.

In 1967 he was promoted to Lt. General and Deputy Chief of the Hellenic National Defence General Staff, a post he held at the time of the coup d&#x27;état of 21 April 1967.

===Under the Papadopoulos Dictatorship===
After the establishment of the military regime, he was appointed Chief of the Army General Staff on 22 April 1967. He was responsible, at least officially, for the Army Decree Nr. 13, which banned the musical works of Mikis Theodorakis. On 21 April 1967 Angelis passed a series of laws limiting protest, including a ban on public gatherings of more than five people, a ban on all private gatherings of a political nature, a ban on propaganda against the generals and a ban on civilians holding guns.

During the failed royal counter-coup of 13 December 1967, Angelis remained loyal to Papadopoulos, and assumed, in addition to his post as head of the army, the position of Chief of the Hellenic National Defence General Staff. On 19 December 1968, he assumed command of the newly formed Armed Forces Headquarters (Αρχηγείο Ενόπλων Δυνάμεων). He was promoted to full General in 1970, and retired from the army on 16 August 1973.

Personally loyal to Georgios Papadopoulos, Angelis was chosen by the latter as his Vice President during the planned transition to democratisation. Greece was declared a Presidential Republic on the first of June 1973 and, following a referendum which took place on 29 July 1973, Papadopoulos got sworn in as President and Angelis as Vice President. Angelis served in this post until 25 November 1973, when Papadopoulos lost power to a hardliner coup.

===Trial and imprisonment===
Following the restoration of democratic rule in 1974, in the 1975 Junta Trials, he was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment for high treason and mutiny. Angelis committed suicide in his cell in the Korydallos Prison on 22 March 1987.

<text>Volokolamsk () is a town and the administrative center of Volokolamsky District in Moscow Oblast, Russia, located on the Gorodenka River, not far from its confluence with the Lama River, northwest of Moscow. Population: 

==History==
It was first mentioned in the Voskresensk Chronicle under the year 1135. It was built by Novgorodian merchants on a portage (/Volok) on a waterway from Novgorod to Moscow and Ryazan, hence the name &quot;Volokolamsk&quot; (i.e., &quot;Volok on the Lama&quot;). In 1178, the town was burned by Vsevolod the Big Nest, who added it to Vladimir-Suzdal lands. His son Yaroslav II restored it to Novgorod in 1231. After the Mongol invasion of Rus&#x27;, the town was divided into two parts: one assigned to Novgorod and another one to the Grand Dukes of Vladimir. The Principality of Tver failed to take it in 1273.

Ivan Kalita presented his part of the town to the boyar Rodion Nestorovich, who presently wrested the other part from Novgorod. In 1345, Simeon the Proud gave Volokolamsk to his father-in-law, one of Smolensk princes. While in possession of Smolensk, the town withstood a siege by Algirdas during the Lithuanian–Muscovite War (1368–72). Vladimir the Bold defeated Tokhtamysh near Volokolamsk in 1383. Soon thereafter, it reverted to Novgorod. The town remained the southernmost enclave of the Novgorod Republic until 1398, when Vasily I definitively incorporated it into the Grand Duchy of Moscow. Ten years later, it was granted for two years to Švitrigaila, who had just defected to Moscow. Having lost its Hanseatic trade and connections with Novgorod, the town declined and was not mentioned by any sources for the next half a century. It was in 1462, when Volokolamsk was given by Ivan III to his younger brother, that the town became the seat of a full-scale appanage principality. Its first prince erected the single-domed limestone Resurrection Cathedral, which still stands. Another prince was Andrey Volotsky; the chief monument from his reign is the three-domed cathedral of the Vyazmischi Cloister (1535).
In 1613, Volokolamsk braved a siege by Sigismund III Vasa, an event which led to the town&#x27;s fortifications being represented on its coat of arms. By that time, Volokolamsk had been associated primarily with the Joseph-Volokolamsk Monastery, situated to the northeast.

The Soviet authority in Volokolamsk was established in late October 1917. During World War II, a number of violent clashes between the German and Soviet troops and partisans took place near Volokolamsk. The town was under German occupation from 27 October to 20 December 1941, when it was liberated by the 331st Rifle Division.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, Volokolamsk serves as the administrative center of Volokolamsky District. As an administrative division, it is, together with seven rural localities, incorporated within Volokolamsky District as the Town of Volokolamsk. As a municipal division, the Town of Volokolamsk is incorporated within Volokolamsky Municipal District as Volokolamsk Urban Settlement.

==International relations==
===Twin towns – sister cities===

Volokolamsk is twinned with:
==In popular culture==
Alexander Bek&#x27;s 1944 novel, Volokolamsk Highway («Волоколамское шоссе»), is a lightly-fictionalized account of the defensive fighting by elements of the 316th Rifle Division along the road from Volokolamsk to Moscow in October 1941.

The online game &quot;War Thunder&quot; (where one controls Armored vehicles such as Tanks) features a ground forces map titled &quot;Volokolamsk&quot;, and a larger version titled &quot;Surroundings of Volokolamsk&quot;. The map is derided from players as being too open and being too big.

==Volokolamsk landfill==
In Volokolamsk, there is a controversial landfill. Many protests have occurred over it as the landfill has given many people respiratory problems. The Russian authorities have not yet done anything about the problem.

<doc id="1337863" wikidata="Q1335321" url="?curid=1337863" title="Critias (dialogue)">
<text>Critias (; ), one of Plato&#x27;s late dialogues, recounts the story of the mighty island kingdom Atlantis and its attempt to conquer Athens, which failed due to the ordered society of the Athenians. &quot;Critias&quot; is the second of a projected trilogy of dialogues, preceded by &quot;Timaeus&quot; and followed by &quot;Hermocrates&quot;. The latter was possibly never written and the ending to &quot;Critias&quot; has been lost. Because of their resemblance (e.g., in terms of persons appearing), modern classicists occasionally combine both &quot;Timaeus&quot; and &quot;Critias&quot; as &quot;Timaeus-Critias&quot;.

==Protagonists==
*Timaeus

Unlike the other speakers of the &quot;Critias&quot;, it is unclear whether Timaeus is a historical figure or not. While some classicists regard him as definitively historical, others guess that &quot;Plato&#x27;s picture of him has probably borrowed traits from various quarters&quot;. Frank assumes Archytas of Tarentum to be the person which Timaeus is partly based on.

On the other hand, F. M. Cornford strongly opposes any idea of a historical Timaeus: &quot;The very fact that a man of such distinction left not the faintest trace in political or philosophic history is against his claim to be a historical person. The probability is that Plato invented him because he required a philosopher of the Western School, eminent both in science and statesmanship, and there was no one to fill the post at the imaginary time of the dialogue&quot;. But while there is no proof for Timaeus to be historical, there is also no proof that he did &quot;not&quot; exist, since little is known of the history of the Italian city of Locri.

*Critias

From the very first comments on &quot;Timaeus&quot; and &quot;Critias&quot; in classical antiquity to the early 20th century, scholars took the identity of &quot;this&quot; Critias and the oligarch Critias for granted. The first to contradict this view was Burnet in 1914. Since then, the identity of Critias has been fiercely disputed among scholars. One group of classicists still claims him to be the famous oligarch Critias, member of the Thirty Tyrants. Another suggests that this Critias is actually the grandfather of the oligarch.

The latter group argues that there is too much distance of time between the oligarch Critias (460–403 BC) and Solon (638–558 BC), the famous lawmaker, who supposedly brought the Atlantis story from Egypt to Greece. According to Plato, Solon told the story to the great-grandfather of the Critias appearing in this dialogue, Dropides, who then told it to his son, who was also named Critias and the grandfather of the Critias in the dialogue. The elder Critias then retold the story to his grandson when he was 90 and the younger Critias was 10.

The latter group alleges that the tyrant&#x27;s grandfather could not have &quot;both&quot; talked to Solon &quot;and&quot; still have been alive at the time the hypothetical discussion pictured in this dialogue was held. Thus they assume that it is the tyrant&#x27;s grandfather who appears in both &quot;Timaeus&quot; and &quot;Critias&quot;, and his own grandfather, who was told the Atlantis story by Solon.

On the other hand, this obviously too long time span between Solon and Critias would not be the only anachronism in Plato&#x27;s work. In fact, Plato produced quite a number of anachronisms in many of his dialogues. And further, there are indications that Solon was dated later than when he actually lived by writers prior to Aristotle.

This leads one to believe that Plato somewhat condensed the happenings of the sixth century. For his purposes, Solon lived just before Anacreon, and Anacreon in turn was active in the early fifth century. The elder Critias is not known to have achieved any personal distinction, and since he died long before Plato published the &quot;Timaeus&quot; and &quot;Critias&quot;, it would have made no sense for Plato to choose a virtually unknown statesman to appear in these dialogues who was uninteresting to his contemporaries.

*Socrates

The speaker Socrates is, of course, identical with the well-known Athenian philosopher.

*Hermocrates

Hermocrates is almost certainly the Syracusan politician and general who is also mentioned by Thucydides among others. He has the smallest share of the conversation in this dialogue. &quot;Since the dialogue that was to bear his name was never written, we can only guess why Plato chose him. It is curious to reflect that, while Critias is to recount how the prehistoric Athens of nine thousand years ago had repelled the invasion from Atlantis and saved the Mediterranean peoples from slavery, Hermocrates would be remembered by the Athenians as the man who had repulsed their own greatest effort at imperialist expansion.&quot;

However, there has been criticism concerning the identification of &quot;Hermocrates&quot; in the dialogues with the historical Hermocrates of Syracuse. German classicist Eberz has argued that it is actually Dion of Syracuse, who explains the polity of Hermocrates in his name.

==Content==

According to Critias, in ancient times, the Earth was divided among the gods by allotment. The gods treated the humans in their districts much as shepherds treat sheep, tending and guiding them like nurselings and possessions. They did this not by force, but by persuasion. In those days, the areas which are now the islands of Greece were high hills covered in good soil.

A number of great deluges came (including the global flood of Deucalion), and because no soil washed down from the mountains to replace the lost soil, the soil in that land was stripped away, causing much of the area to sink out of sight, and the islands that remained to become the &quot;bones of a dead body.&quot;

Athens, in those days, was very different. The land was rich and water was brought in from underground springs (which were later destroyed by earthquake). He describes the civilization of Athens at that time as ideal: pursuing all virtue, living in moderation, and excelling in their work.

He then moves on to describe the origins of Atlantis. He said that Atlantis was allotted to Poseidon. Poseidon fell in love with a mortal girl named Cleito (daughter of Evenor and Leucippe), and they had a number of children, the first of which was named Atlas, who inherited the kingdom and passed it onto his firstborn for many generations. Critias then goes into a great deal of detail in describing the island of Atlantis and the Temple to Poseidon and Cleito on the island, and refers to the legendary metal orichalcum. Critias then reiterates the remarkable virtue of the Atlanteans, saying:
:For many generations, as long as the divine nature lasted in them, they were obedient to the laws, and well-affectioned towards the god, whose seed they were; for they possessed true and in every way great spirits, uniting gentleness with wisdom in the various chances of life, and in their intercourse with one another. They despised everything but virtue, caring little for their present state of life, and thinking lightly of the possession of gold and other property, which seemed only a burden to them; neither were they intoxicated by luxury; nor did wealth deprive them of their self-control; but they were sober, and saw clearly that all these goods are increased by virtue and friendship with one another, whereas by too great regard and respect for them, they are lost and friendship with them.

However, the Atlanteans became corrupt as:
:...when the divine portion began to fade away, and became diluted too often and too much with the mortal admixture, and the human nature got the upper hand, they then, being unable to bear their fortune, behaved unseemly, and to him who had an eye to see grew visibly debased, for they were losing the fairest of their precious gifts; but to those who had no eye to see the true happiness, they appeared glorious and blessed at the very time when they were full of avarice and unrighteous power.

Critias then says that Zeus, the god of gods, seeing the corruption of the Atlanteans, determined to chastise them. Zeus begins to speak; but what he says, and everything that follows in the &quot;Critias&quot;, remains nonextant.

<text>Sadras is a fortress town located on India&#x27;s Coromandel Coast in Chengalpattu district, 70 km south of Chennai in Tamil Nadu state. &quot;Sadras&quot; is the anglicised form of the ancient town of &quot;Sadurangapattinam&quot;.

==History and etymology==
An inscription found in Sadras dated to 1359 mention this place as Rajanarayanan Pattinam after a Sambuvaraya chieftain. There is a temple to Vishnu here, and because of it later the city was known as Sadiravasagan Pattinam. This later changed into Sadurangapattinam, shortly known as Sadirai. Later the Dutch called it Sadras.

==Dutch fort==
Modern Sadras was established as part of Dutch Coromandel in the seventeenth century, which was even before center for weaving superfine muslin cloth for export besides pearl and edible oil. The magnificent Sadras Fort, built for commercial purposes by the Dutch, is a vast compound enclosing a huge granary, stables, and structures used to mount elephants. Unfortunately, only one of these structures survives. The fortress was raided by the British in 1818 and came under the control of the British East India Company. It is now maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India in efforts to contain further dilapidation. In 2003, a major restoration of the damaged fort was carried out leading to many archaeological findings. The first battle between British East India Company and the Dutch started here as Battle of Sadras. The fort includes a cemetery with many beautifully decorated graves that date to between 1620 and 1769.
==Location==
In recent times, Sadras has found mention due to its proximity to the atomic power plant (Madras Atomic Power Station) and the atomic research centre (Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research – IGCAR) both located at nearby Kalpakkam. The village of Sadras is sandwiched between the power plant and its township. There are two bridges connecting Kalpakkam and Sadras.

==Gallery==
The Sadras fort also contains picturesque tombs.

<text>&quot;The Adventure of Wisteria Lodge&quot; is one of the fifty-six Sherlock Holmes short stories written by Arthur Conan Doyle. One of eight stories in the volume &quot;His Last Bow&quot;, it is a lengthy, two-part story consisting of &quot;The Singular Experience of Mr. John Scott Eccles&quot; and &quot;The Tiger of San Pedro&quot;, which on original publication in &quot;The Strand&quot; bore the collective title of &quot;A Reminiscence of Mr. Sherlock Holmes&quot;.

==Plot==
Sherlock Holmes is visited by John Scott Eccles, who wishes to discuss something &quot;grotesque&quot;. No sooner has he arrived at 221B Baker Street than Inspector Gregson also shows up, along with Inspector Baynes of the Surrey Constabulary. They wish a statement from Eccles about the murder of Aloysius Garcia near Esher the previous night.

Eccles explains that he spent the night at Wisteria Lodge, Garcia&#x27;s rented house, but when he woke up in the morning, he found that Garcia and his servants had all disappeared, leaving him alone in the house. Eccles mentions that a note, delivered during dinner the previous evening, had caused great consternation to Garcia and may have had some connection with the household&#x27;s disappearance.
Holmes&#x27; investigation leads him to the Henderson household, whose master has spent time in the tropics, and whose secretary is a dark-skinned foreigner. Holmes believes that the cryptic note came from this household and the writer could only be the house&#x27;s governess, Miss Burnet, who has not been seen since the night of the murder. 

That night, the Hendersons flee by train. Miss Burnet escapes with the help of a former gardener. It is revealed that &quot;Henderson&quot; is in fact Don Juan Murillo, an overthrown dictator from Central America who left a bloody trail behind as he escaped to England. Miss Burnet&#x27;s real name is Mrs. Victor Durando. Her late husband was San Pedro&#x27;s ambassador to Britain and a potential political rival to Murillo. Murillo had him recalled and shot so that he would not pose a threat to Murillo&#x27;s position. Fortunately, Mrs. Durando stayed behind in England and avoided harm herself. She went on to change her name and secure the position as governess to Henderson&#x27;s children in order to get closer to and spy on him.

Murillo and his secretary give the police the slip in London, and resurface in Madrid under new aliases. However, they are both murdered, and their killers are never caught.

== Publication history ==
&quot;The Adventure of Wisteria Lodge&quot; was first published in the US in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; on 15 August 1908, and in the UK in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in September–October 1908. In the &quot;Strand&quot;, the story was published in two parts: &quot;The Singular Experience of Mr. John Scott Eccles&quot; and &quot;The Tiger of San Pedro&quot;. The story was published with six illustrations by Frederic Dorr Steele in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;, and with ten illustrations by Arthur Twidle in the &quot;Strand&quot;. It was included in the short story collection &quot;His Last Bow&quot;, which was published in the UK and the US in October 1917.

== Adaptations ==
=== Film and television ===
*A short silent film titled &quot;The Tiger of San Pedro&quot; (1921) was based on the story. It was one of the short films in the Sherlock Holmes film series by Stoll Pictures, and starred Eille Norwood as Sherlock Holmes and Hubert Willis as Dr. Watson.
*The story was adapted for the 1968 BBC series with Peter Cushing. The episode is now lost.
*The Granada TV adaption with Jeremy Brett followed the original story with a few exceptions. At the end Murillo and his &quot;secretary&quot; are shot and killed on a train by Garcia&#x27;s avengers.
*The NHK puppet show &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; made an episode loosely based on the story.

=== Radio ===
*The story was dramatised by Edith Meiser as a 1931 episode of the American radio series &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, with Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson. Other episodes based on the story aired in January 1935, with Louis Hector as Holmes and Lovell as Watson, and in September 1936, with Gordon as Holmes and Harry West as Watson.
*Meiser also adapted the story for the American radio series &quot;The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson. The episode aired in December 1939. Other episodes based on the story aired in 1943 and in 1947 (with Tom Conway as Holmes and Bruce as Watson).
*&quot;Wisteria Lodge&quot; was adapted for the BBC Light Programme as part of the 1952–1969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson. The production was adapted by Michael Hardwick and aired on 26 December 1966.
*&quot;Wisteria Lodge&quot; was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 1994 by Bert Coules as part of the 1989–1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson.
* In 2008, the story was adapted as an episode of &quot;The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, a series on the American radio show &quot;Imagination Theatre&quot;, with John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson.

<text>The Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) is an American nonprofit organization working to raise awareness and understanding of psychedelic substances. MAPS was founded in 1986 by Rick Doblin and is now based in San Jose, California.

MAPS helps scientists design, fund, and obtain regulatory approval for studies of the safety and effectiveness of a number of controlled substances. MAPS works closely with government regulatory authorities worldwide such as the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to ensure that all of its sponsored research protocols conform to ethical and procedural guidelines for clinical drug research. Included in MAPS&#x27; research efforts are MDMA (methylenedioxymethamphetamine) for the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); LSD and psilocybin for the treatment of anxiety, cluster headaches, and depression associated with end-of-life issues; ibogaine for the treatment of opiate addiction, ayahuasca for the treatment of drug addiction and PTSD; medical cannabis for PTSD; and alternative delivery systems for medical cannabis such as vaporizers and water pipes. MAPS officials say the organization&#x27;s ultimate goal is to establish a network of clinics where these and other treatments can be provided together with other therapies under the guidance of trained, licensed physicians and therapists. In December 2023, MAPS submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) to the FDA for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy. 

In addition to sponsoring scientific research, MAPS organizes continuing medical education (CME) conferences, sponsors and presents lectures and seminars on the state of psychedelic and medical marijuana research, provides psychedelic harm reduction services through the Zendo Project at events such as music festivals and Burning Man, and publishes a triannual magazine-style publication, the MAPS Bulletin, with updates about its ongoing research efforts, legal struggles, and educational initiatives. MAPS also publishes books dealing with the science, history, and culture of psychedelic research and psychedelic therapy.

== History ==

=== Founding MAPS ===

Anticipating that the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) would move to criminalize MDMA in light of the drug&#x27;s increasing popularity in recreational use, Rick Doblin, Alise Agar and Debby Harlow organized a nonprofit group called Earth Metabolic Design Laboratories (EMDL) to advocate for the potential therapeutic use of MDMA. By 1984 the DEA had announced its intention to designate MDMA as a Schedule I substance, a categorization that would greatly restrict and regulate the drug&#x27;s availability, as well as indicate that it held no accepted medical use and a high abuse potential.

EMDL organized supporters to petition the DEA for a scheduling hearing regarding MDMA. George Greer, Lester Grinspoon, Professor James Bakalar, and Professor Thomas Roberts contributed to the argument that MDMA belonged in Schedule III, a category that would more readily enable future research and permit the continuation of its use in psychotherapy. Despite such efforts, the DEA pursued emergency scheduling in 1985, citing an imminent risk to public health.

As MDMA was now deemed illegal, held in the same category as such substances as heroin, the only way for it to be employed in scientific inquiry would be through the lengthy and expensive FDA approval process. Holding the belief that MDMA had the unique potential both to aid psychotherapy and eventually to become a prescription medicine, Rick Doblin sought to gain incorporation for MAPS as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit research and educational organization. The founding of MAPS was a primary step toward the future envisioning of what Doblin has called a &quot;nonprofit psychedelic-pharmaceutical company.&quot; Chartered in 1986, MAPS has since contributed over 12 million dollars towards the scientific study of psychedelics and cannabis in therapeutic applications.

== Projects ==

Since 1986, MAPS has distributed over $20 million to fund psychedelics and medical cannabis research and education. These include:

* Erowid and MAPS have been collaborating on two large reference database projects since 2001. Erowid has been providing expertise and work developing and coordinating construction of an online MDMA Reference library and MAPS begun working on doing a similar project with the Albert Hofmann Foundation&#x27;s LSD and Psilocybin Library.
* Designed a study to examine vaporized or smoked marijuana in the treatment of war related PTSD in veterans, which will evaluate efficacy and safety of multiple strains of herbal cannabis. The study has received FDA approval. MAPS is pursuing the purchase of appropriate strains from the US federal government.
* Sponsored efforts by Lyle Craker, Medicinal Plant Program, UMass Amherst Department of Plant and Soil Sciences, to obtain a license from the Drug Enforcement Administration for a marijuana production facility.
* Sponsored analytical research into the effects of the marijuana vaporizer, leading to the first human study of marijuana vaporizers conducted by Donald Abrams of the University of California, San Francisco.
* Funded the successful efforts of Donald Abrams to obtain approval for the first human study in 15 years into the therapeutic use of marijuana, along with a $1 million grant from the National Institute on Drug Abuse.
* Obtained orphan drug designation from the FDA for smoked marijuana in the treatment of AIDS Wasting Syndrome.
* Supported long-term follow-up studies of pioneering research with LSD and psilocybin originally conducted in the 1950s and 1960s.
* Sponsoring research by Evgeny Krupitsky into ketamine-assisted psychotherapy as a potential treatment for heroin addiction and alcoholism.
* Sponsoring programs and services at festivals, community events, churches, and schools that provide psychedelic harm reduction and education.
* A clinical study evaluating the treatment of cluster headaches using low doses of the tryptamine psilocybin (found in psilocybin mushrooms) is being developed by researchers at Harvard Medical School, McLean Hospital in conjunction with MAPS.
* Performed several small clinical studies described below, and in some cases, published the results in scientific journals.

== Organization ==

=== Board and staff ===

MAPS is governed by a board of directors including John Gilmore, David Bronner, Robert J. Barnhart, and Rick Doblin. Ashawna Hailey served on the board until her death in 2011.

=== Funding ===

MAPS is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) research and educational organization, funded by donations from individuals and foundations. Donations to MAPS can be restricted to fund a specific project, or be unrestricted. MAPS also receives revenue from conferences and events, such as the Psychedelic Science conference, as well as from the sale of books, merchandise, and art. With a policy of transparency in financial matters, MAPS publishes a detailed annual financial report. On August 20, 2020, having raised $30 million in non-profit donations in less than six months, MAPS and the Psychedelic Science Funders Collaborative (PSFC) announced the completion of the Capstone Campaign, a non-profit fundraising effort to fund the final research required to seek U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

== Legal efforts ==

=== Medical cannabis monopoly ===
National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) has a government granted monopoly on the production of cannabis for medical research purposes. In the past, the institute has refused to supply marijuana to researchers who had obtained all other necessary federal permits. Medical marijuana researchers and activists claim that NIDA, which is not supposed to be a regulatory organization, does not have the authority to effectively regulate who does and doesn&#x27;t get to do research with medical marijuana. Jag Davies of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) writes in MAPS Bulletin:

NIDA administers a contract with the University of Mississippi to grow the nation&#x27;s only legal cannabis crop for medical and research purposes, including the Compassionate Investigational New Drug program. United States federal law registers cannabis as a Schedule I drug. Medical marijuana researchers typically prefer to use high-potency marijuana, but NIDA&#x27;s National Advisory Council on Drug Abuse has been reluctant to provide cannabis with high THC levels, citing safety concerns:

Major events in recent proceedings are notable, as in the 2007 ruling by Administrative Law Judge Mary Ellen Bittner, wherein she recommended that Craker receive a license to grow marijuana for research and that NIDA dismantle its monopoly. The DEA in response overturned the recommended ruling in January 2009, and later denied Craker&#x27;s Motion to Reconsider in December 2010. In March 2011, Craker&#x27;s lawyers submitted their final brief in the case. MAPS is pursuing efforts to have the DEA&#x27;s final ruling rescinded. A detailed timeline of MAPS&#x27; attempts to gain access to research-grade marijuana is available on the MAPS website.

In 2016, the Obama administration DEA announced their intent to grant additional licenses to marijuana growers for research, ending the NIDA monopoly on federally legal marijuana. The DEA finalized the proposed rule in early 2020.

== Controversy ==
A clinical participant in MAPS&#x27;s phase 2 trials of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for PTSD, Meaghan Buisson, was inappropriately cuddled and spooned by a husband-and-wife pair of therapists while on MDMA during one of her therapy sessions. A few months later, Buisson began living with the pair, Dr. Donna Dryer and Dr. Richard Yensen, in their home on a remote Canadian island for purposes of undergoing more therapy. Buisson eventually entered a sexual relationship with Yensen, allegedly under the guise of it being exposure therapy. The relationship continued for over a year. In 2018, Buisson filed a civil lawsuit alleging that Yensen had repeatedly sexually assaulted her. The suit was settled out of court.

Upon eventually learning of the ethical violation, MAPS cut ties with the therapists, reported the incident to health authorities, issued a public statement about it, gave Buisson US$15,000 to obtain therapy while her civil case against Yensen was ongoing, and instituted a new code of ethics for the trials that explicitly prohibited sexual contact between participants and therapists. A few years later, the incident was further reported on by Psymposia in their podcast series &quot;Cover Story: Power Trip&quot;, in which they strongly criticize MAPS. In addition, shortly after the podcast, Psymposia and Buisson released video excerpts of Buisson experiencing the inappropriate physical contact that had been recorded during her therapy session. The videos had been voluntarily given to Buisson by MAPS when she had asked for them previously. MAPS has been criticized for missing the video-recorded ethical violation and for not viewing the videos until years after it became aware of the incident.

<text>&quot;The Adventure of the Red Circle&quot; is one of the 56 Sherlock Holmes short stories written by Arthur Conan Doyle. It is included in the anthology &quot;His Last Bow&quot;.

==Plot==
Mrs. Warren, a landlady, comes to 221B Baker Street with some questions about her lodger. A youngish, heavily bearded man, who spoke good but accented English, came to her and offered double her usual rent on the condition that he get the room on his own terms. He went out the first night that he was there, and came back after midnight when the rest of the household had gone to bed. Since then, neither Mrs. Warren, her husband, nor their servant girl has seen him.

After the landlady leaves, Holmes remarks to Dr. Watson that it seems likely that the person in Mrs. Warren&#x27;s house is not the bearded man who made the arrangements. Holmes suspects that messages are being sent to the lodger.

Holmes and Watson go to Mrs. Warren&#x27;s house and spy on the lodger, who they discover to be a young woman with a dark complexion. That evening, Holmes and Watson are on hand to see the lodger&#x27;s confederate send messages by a waving candle.

Holmes and Watson meet Inspector Gregson and a Pinkerton detective from the United States named Leverton. They are lying in wait for Giuseppe Gorgiano, a vicious killer. Going into the room where the signalling came from, they discover Gorgiano lies on the floor in a pool of blood from having been impaled with a large knife. The lodger is revealed as Emilia Lucca, and her confederate is Gennaro, her husband. She confirms that the Luccas were seeking refuge from the dangerous Giuseppe Gorgiano, who was out to kill Gennaro for betraying the Red Circle, a secret Italian criminal organization that they had both been involved in. Gennaro decided to leave the organization in spite of the threatened consequences. He and his wife fled Italy and went to New York to escape the Red Circle, but Gorgiano tracked Gennaro down. Gregson takes Emilia down to the police station.

<text>Biscoitos is a civil parish in the municipality of Praia da Vitória, on the island of Terceira in the Portuguese Azores. The population in 2011 was 1,424, in an area of 27.05 km2. 

Due to its volcanic origin, its terrain is poor, so vines were and still are a very usual crop, so Biscoitos began to be known for its high quality wine, which is made with Verdelho grapes.

The village has a wine museum called the &quot;Museu do Vinho dos Biscoitos&quot; that was established in 1990.
