<text>&quot;The Adventure of the Norwood Builder&quot;, one of the 56 short Sherlock Holmes stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is the second tale from &quot;The Return of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. The story was first published in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; (US) on 31 October 1903 and in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; (UK) in November 1903.

==Plot==
Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson are visited by John Hector McFarlane, a young lawyer from Blackheath who has been accused of murdering one of his clients – builder Jonas Oldacre. McFarlane explains to Holmes that Oldacre had come to his office the day before and asked him to draw up his will in proper legal form. To his surprise, Oldacre was making him the sole beneficiary to a considerable bequest. Later, McFarlane went to Oldacre&#x27;s house in Lower Norwood to deliver the will and go over some additional documents. McFarlane left quite late and stayed at a local inn. On the train the next morning, he read in the newspaper about the apparent murder and that the police were looking for him.

The evidence against McFarlane is quite damning: his bloody stick was found in Oldacre&#x27;s study, and outside is a pile of dry timber burnt to ashes, smelling of burnt flesh. Inspector Lestrade, who comes to arrest McFarlane, gloats in the apparent knowledge that he is on the right track. Holmes begins his own investigation by going to Blackheath instead of Norwood. There he learns that McFarlane&#x27;s mother was once engaged to Oldacre, but broke up with him once she found out his cruel nature. Holmes also notes that Oldacre&#x27;s draft will was written in a very haphazard fashion, as if he didn&#x27;t care about it. Holmes also discovers large payments from Oldacre&#x27;s bank account to a &quot;Mr Cornelius&quot;. Holmes then visits Oldacre&#x27;s house, where he inspects the study. Lestrade produces Oldacre&#x27;s trouser buttons, found in the ashes of the fire. Holmes fears the worst: &quot;All my instincts are in one direction, and all the facts are in another.&quot; Still, Holmes suspects Oldacre&#x27;s housekeeper is deliberately withholding information.


The next morning, a bloody thumbprint is found at Oldacre&#x27;s house that matches McFarlane&#x27;s. This seems to be conclusive, as Lestrade smugly notes. However, Holmes is sure the thumbprint was not there in his previous inspection, and McFarlane has been in gaol.

Holmes tells Lestrade there is another important witness to see, whom he offers to produce. Lestrade is dismissive, but lets Holmes proceed. Holmes starts a small, smoky fire in the upper hall of the house and has the constables shout &quot;Fire!&quot; Oldacre emerges alive from a hidden chamber at the end of the hall. Holmes had deduced its existence by measuring the halls. Oldacre staged his apparent murder to gain revenge against McFarlane&#x27;s mother. He tries to pass off his actions as a practical joke but is taken into custody, along with the housekeeper as an accomplice. &quot;Mr. Cornelius&quot; is an alias to be used by Oldacre to evade his creditors. Holmes remarks to Lestrade that Oldacre&#x27;s plot was nearly perfect, but he went one step too far by planting the thumbprint (from a wax seal that McFarlane had pressed). &quot;He wished to improve what was already perfect&quot;, says Holmes, &quot;and so he ruined everything.&quot;

==Background==
Conan Doyle lived in South Norwood from 1891 to 1894, and so was very familiar with the area. There is however a good deal of ambiguity as to specific settings within the story. The Norwood where Oldacre lives for instance is called &quot;Lower Norwood&quot;, which until around 1885 would have been the term used for what is now West Norwood. The story however was penned some time after this date, and Oldacre is described as living in &quot;Deep Dene House, at the Sydenham end of the road of that name&quot;. South Norwood itself might be a logical candidate for Lower Norwood, however the only discernible connection between the story and South Norwood is that Norwood Junction railway station is used by Oldacre. McFarlane spends the night in The Anerley Arms, a pub that still exists and which has a derelict upper floor (no more overnight guests). It is now one of the Samuel Smith Old Brewery family of pubs and celebrates its connection with Sherlock Holmes.

This is one of the few Holmes stories in which a fingerprint provides a good clue to the nature of the problem. The wax thumbprint reproduction idea was devised by, and bought from, Bertram Fletcher Robinson (1870–1907), who also helped plot &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot; (1901).

At the start of the story, Watson mentions two unrecorded cases that Holmes investigated around the same time as this story:
* &quot;The case of the papers of Ex-President Murillo&quot;, which Doyle later wrote as &quot;The Adventure of Wisteria Lodge&quot;.
* &quot;The shocking affair of the Dutch steamship &quot;Friesland&quot;&quot;, which loosely inspired a 1944 episode of the radio series &quot;The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; and the 1945 film &quot;Pursuit to Algiers&quot;, both starring Basil Rathbone as Holmes.
* A reference to Professor Moriarty prefaces the story. &quot;&#x27;From the point of view of the criminal expert&#x27;, said Mr Sherlock Holmes, &#x27;London has become a singularly uninteresting city since the death of the late lamented Moriarty&#x27;&quot;. Moriarty is mentioned in two other 1903 stories: &quot;The Adventure of the Missing Three-Quarter&quot; and &quot;The Adventure of the Empty House&quot;.

==Publication history==
&quot;The Adventure of the Norwood Builder&quot; was first published in the US in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; on 31 October 1903, and in the UK in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in November 1903. The story was published with seven illustrations by Frederic Dorr Steele in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;, and with seven illustrations by Sidney Paget in the &quot;Strand&quot;. It was included in the short story collection &quot;The Return of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, which was published in the US in February 1905 and in the UK in March 1905.

The original manuscript of the story is now part of the Berg Collection at the New York Public Library.
==Adaptations==

===Film and television===
The story was adapted as a short silent film released in 1922 as part of the Stoll film series starring Eille Norwood as Sherlock Holmes and Hubert Willis as Dr. Watson, with Cyril Raymond as John McFarlane and Teddy Arundell as Inspector Hopkins.

The Granada &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; television series with Jeremy Brett was faithful to the original story with a few exceptions. In the adaptation, Oldacre kills and burns a tramp, but in the book, he refuses to admit what flesh was burned. Mrs. McFarlane is a recent widow instead of her husband being alive but away. Watson instead of Holmes traces payments to Cornelius, and finally, Holmes instead of Lestrade, warns McFarlane that his words may be used against him.

In the first episode of season two of &quot;Elementary,&quot; Holmes mentions the Norwood Builder as a case he and Lestrade worked on in London.

===Radio and audio dramas===
A radio adaptation aired as an episode of the American radio series &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. The episode was adapted by Edith Meiser and aired on 13 April 1931, with Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson.

Meiser also adapted the story as an episode of the American radio series &quot;The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson, that aired on 17 November 1940.

Felix Felton adapted the story for the BBC Home Service as part of the 1952–1969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson, with Felton as Inspector Lestrade and John Turnbull as Jonas Oldacre. The adaptation aired on 7 October 1954.

The story was adapted as an episode titled &quot;The Tale of the Norwood Builder&quot; in a series of radio adaptations starring John Gielgud as Holmes and Ralph Richardson as Watson. The episode aired on the BBC Light Programme on 23 November 1954 and NBC radio on 20 February 1955.

An audio drama based on the story was released in 1971 on one side of an LP record, as one of several recordings starring Robert Hardy as Holmes and Nigel Stock as Watson. It was dramatised and produced by Michael Hardwick and Mollie Hardwick.

&quot;The Norwood Builder&quot; was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 1993 by Bert Coules, as part of the 1989–1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson. It featured Peter Sallis as Jonas Oldacre, Donald Gee as Inspector Lestrade, and David Holt as John McFarlane. In it, because of his change of attitude towards fame (acquired while travelling in Tibet during his &quot;death&quot;), Holmes, at the beginning, informs Watson that &quot;there must be no more stories&quot; but that Watson should continue to keep notes on their cases to stockpile them for possible future publication. Also, after his capture, Oldacre reveals that he also believed Holmes to be dead.

The story was adapted as a 2007 episode of &quot;The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, a series on the American radio show &quot;Imagination Theatre&quot;, starring John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson, with Rick May as Lestrade.

<doc id="1334050" wikidata="Q2736093" url="?curid=1334050" title="Ramsbottom">
<text>Ramsbottom is a market town in the Metropolitan Borough of Bury, Greater Manchester, England. The population at the 2011 census was 17,872.

Historically in Lancashire, it is on the River Irwell in the West Pennine Moors, northwest of Bury, and of Manchester. Its name is believed to derive from Old English and , meaning &#x27;valley of the ram&#x27;. Its Victorian architecture, Pennine landscape and industrial heritage, including the East Lancashire Railway, contribute to heritage tourism in the town.

==History==

===Toponymy===
The name either means &#x27;ram&#x27;s valley&#x27; from the Old English , &#x27;a ram&#x27; and , &#x27;a valley&#x27; but could mean a &#x27;wild garlic valley&#x27;, with the first element representing the Old English meaning &#x27;wild garlic&#x27;. A record from 1324 recording the name as is inconclusive. The town was alternatively recorded as &quot;Ramysbothom&quot; in 1540.

===Early history===
Evidence of prehistoric human activity has been discovered in the hills surrounding the town. Early records show that in Norman times Ramsbottom was part of the Forest of Rossendale. There are a number of Bronze Age burial sites around the town, the most notable of which is Whitelow Cairn, one mile (1.6 km) southeast of the town centre and three miles (4.8 km) north of Bury. The cairn was excavated by Bury Archaeological Group between 1960–62, under the leadership of Norman Tyson. Finds include one main and seven secondary cremations, four in urns, dating to the mid Bronze Age. Artefacts found during the excavation are housed in Bury Museum.

The early Anglo-Saxons who gave Ramsbottom its name progressively felled the woodland during the Middle Ages. Ramsbottom became an area of scattered woods, farmsteads, moorland and swamp with a small community of families until the late 18th century.

===Industrial Revolution===
Ramsbottom developed during the 19th century as a manufacturing and mill town on the road from Bury to Haslingden by the River Irwell, its suburbs stretched south to Hazelhurst and north to Stubbins. Mills were built for spinning, weaving and printing. Square Mill was in its day innovative in combining many such processes under one roof.

With a readily available source of water power, Sir Robert Peel purchased land in Ramsbottom in the late 18th century to commence a major manufacturing career. It is this exchange that effectively founded Ramsbottom as a homogeneous settlement; the factory system, and Industrial Revolution facilitated a process of unplanned urbanisation in the area, contributing to it becoming an important and populous mill town.

The Grant Arms Hotel in Market Place was the home of William and Daniel Grant, 19th century industrialists closely associated with the rise of the town and reputed to be the inspiration for the Cheeryble brothers in &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot; by Charles Dickens. The Grants&#x27; employees were paid in tokens that had to be redeemed at a public house owned by the company. The landlord converted the tokens into cash, but only after deducting threepence per person, which had to be spent on beer, a variation on the truck system. The Grant Arms Hotel closed in 2018 and is currently being developed as offices, this has now been completed to a high standard that compliments the area. 

A network of roads and railways routed through Ramsbottom allowed for a series of diverse industries, including calico-printing, cotton spinning, machine-making, rope-making and iron and brass founding. Imports of foreign goods during the mid-20th century precipitated the decline of these sectors.

==Governance==
From the Middle Ages Ramsbottom was an area in the township of Lower Tottington, in the parish of Bury, and Salford hundred in Lancashire. 
It was part of the Bury Poor Law Union formed in February 1837, overseen by a Board of 25 Guardians including three from Tottington Lower End using the old workhouses at Bury, Radcliffe, Pilkington and Heywood until a new workhouse at Jericho opened in 1857. In 1864 the Ramsbottom Local Board of Health was formed for the Ramsbottom area in Tottington Lower End township. In 1883 parts of Elton, Tottington Higher End and Walmersley with Shuttleworth townships were added to the area of the Local Board. In 1894 the area of the Local Board became Ramsbottom Urban District. Parts of Bury Borough and Walmersley with Shuttleworth civil parish were added to the urban district in 1933. The urban district was dissolved in 1974 and the Central, East, South and West wards were included in Bury Metropolitan Borough and the remainder in the Rossendale District of Lancashire.

Ramsbottom is part of the Bury North constituency which was created in 1983 from parts of the former seats of the former Rossendale and Bury and Radcliffe constituencies. The area was Conservative from 1983 to 1997 when it was gained by Labour who lost in 2010 back to the Conservatives. The seat was regained by Labour in the 2017 general election. In addition, the 2018 local council elections saw Labour gain the Ramsbottom ward. In line with the national swing in 2019, Bury North was lost back to the Conservatives, and it is now the most marginal constituency in England, with a majority of 105 votes.However the Bury North constituency was regained by Labour in the 2024 UK general election by James Frith with 19625 votes, a majority of 6944 votes. 

==Geography==

The Ramsbottom parish formed in 1844 was a mile and a quarter in length and about three-quarters of a mile in width in the Lower Tottington township in the valley of the River Irwell that extends from Bury to Rossendale. It is bounded to the south by Holcombe Brook and Summerseat; to the north by Edenfield, Irwell Vale, Stubbins and the hamlets of Chatterton and Strongstry; to the west by Holcombe and to the east by Shuttleworth and Turn Village.

The area is characterised by its position on the south side of the West Pennine Moors. The high ground rises sharply on either side of the town with Holcombe Moor, Harcles Hill and Bull Hill to the west and Top O&#x27; Th&#x27; Hoof, Harden Moor, Scout Moor and Whittle Hill to the east.
==Transport==

===Rail===

The railway arrived in Ramsbottom in 1846 when the Manchester, Bury and Rossendale Railway Company built the railway from Bury to a junction with the Manchester and Bolton Railway and extended the line northwards to Rawtenstall and opened a railway station in the town centre. The line between Bury and Rawtenstall remained open to passengers until 1972 and for goods until 1980. This line is used by the East Lancashire Railway, a modern heritage railway which opened in 1987.

===Road===
The district straddles the A676, A56 and B6214 roads with its centre north of Bury, south of Rawtenstall and northeast of Bolton. The M66 motorway runs to the east of the town, linking it north to the M65 motorway and south to the M62 motorway and the Manchester Outer Ring Road.

==Landmarks==

The skyline is dominated by the Peel Monument which stands on Holcombe Moor, a memorial to Sir Robert Peel, the 19th-century British Prime Minister and creator of the modern British police force. The tower stands tall on Holcombe Moor. There are views over West Yorkshire, North Lancashire, Greater Manchester, North Wales and the Lancashire Plain. From the top of the tower it is possible to see Blackpool Tower on a clear day.
Ramsbottom is on the path of the Irwell Sculpture Trail. The &quot;Tilted Vase&quot; by Edward Allington, a sculpture both classical in shape to reflect the surrounding buildings but apparently bolted together to reflect the old industries, is located in Market Place. This piece of work, weighing around two tons and locally known as &quot;the Urn&quot; or &quot;Urnie&quot;, was funded with £250,000 of National Lottery money.

Nuttall Park is a large park with facilities for bowls, tennis, football and public events. The park hosts regular fun fairs and family events, and is a popular attraction with locals and tourists alike.

==Education==
In 1841, cotton mill owners, the Ashtons built a day school in Crow Lane which was used as a Sunday school and for church services.

* Edenfield CE Primary, Stubbins Community Primary, St Joseph&#x27;s RC Primary, St Andrew&#x27;s CE Primary, Hazelhurst County Primary, Emmanuel Holcombe CE Primary, Holcombe Brook Community Primary, Summerseat Methodist Primary, Peel Brow Primary.
* Rossendale School founded in 1989 is a specialist residential and day school for children aged eight to 16 with behavioural, emotional and social difficulties.
* Woodhey High School
* Darul Uloom Islamic College

==Religion==
St Andrew&#x27;s Church, the oldest church in Ramsbottom, was built by the Grant family in 1834 as a Scottish Presbyterian Church. In the 1860s a member of the Grant family deprived the congregation of its church and in 1869 offered the building to the Bishop of Manchester as an Anglican church. It became a mission church for St Paul&#x27;s Church, Ramsbottom until 1875 when it was consecrated as the Parish Church of St Andrew. 
In 1993 the church was refurbished and re-ordered and dedicated in 1994. The Ashton brothers donated farm land as site for St Paul&#x27;s Church which cost £3,400. It was consecrated in 1850.
The Anglican Churches in Ramsbottom are part of the Ramsbottom &amp; Edenfield Team Ministry 
comprising Christ Church Baptist Methodist Church, Dundee United Reformed Church, Greenmount United Reformed Church, Ramsbottom Pentecostal Church, Ramsbottom Evangelical Church, St Andrew&#x27;s CE Church, St Joseph&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church, St Paul&#x27;s CE Church and Darul Uloom Islamic College.

==Sports==
Ramsbottom Cricket Club plays in the Lancashire League. The team has included professional players such as Seymour Nurse (West Indies), Chris Harris (New Zealand), Brad Hodge (Australia and Lancashire CCC), Ian Harvey (Australia and currently Derbyshire CCC), Ian Chappell (Australia) and Michael Clarke (Australia Captain). Its ground, close to Ramsbottom railway station, has a reputation as being one of the best and most picturesque in the North West of England.

Ramsbottom United F.C. play in the Northern Premier League Division One North (level 8 in the Football League System). They were crowned champions of the North West Counties League at the end of the 2011–12 season. The club&#x27;s home games are played at its floodlit pitch, the Riverside Ground which has a capacity of 2,000, and is adjacent to the cricket ground.

==Culture and community==
Hundreds of people climb Holcombe Hill on Good Friday. A smaller gathering keeps alive the tradition of egg rolling before the start of the climb. Large gatherings on the hill are visible from miles away, and occasionally attract unorthodox religious preachers. In recent years the celebrations have become more secular, with the public house at the bottom of Holcombe Hill attracting as many as 3,000 visitors leading to complaints from residents and restrictions being imposed by the council.

Ye Olde Gamecock Show, an exhibition of game fowl is held in the town on New Year&#x27;s Day. The show was held at The Old Dun Horse from 1843 until it closed in 2010 and has since been hosted by the Ramsbottom branch of the Royal British Legion. This competitive show replaced the annual cockfight that took place in the town square after the New Year Holcome Hunt.
The exhibition, organised by the Holcombe Old English Game Fowl Club, is said to be the oldest gamecock show in the world.

The Summerseat Players, a registered charity run entirely not-for-profit, puts on five performances in each season, and performances by local schools and dance groups, and the company&#x27;s youth theatre groups. The amateur dramatic group was formed in 1968, and performed at St Winifred&#x27;s Church Hall in Summerseat. In 1990, with donations and loans from members and enthusiasts, the company purchased the Theatre Royal on Smithy Street in Ramsbottom.

Ramsbottom hosts an annual rhythm &amp; blues festival. The now defunct pub the Corner Pin, was where the band Elbow played their first gig. The Ramsbottom Recorded Music Society was formed in 1967 to promote an interest and appreciation of music and meets bi-weekly on Thursday evenings at Christ Church Neighbourhood Centre.

The Black Pudding Throwing World Championships are held annually at the Royal Oak (now the Oaks) pub on Bridge Street. Participants have to toss black puddings in an attempt to dislodge a stack of Yorkshire puddings on plinths on two levels (one for children, the other for adults). The winner is the one who dislodges most Yorkshire puddings in three attempts.

TNT Express is found at the heart of Ramsbottom, with staff from all over Lancashire. Originally the office was based in Stubbins but moved to Railway Street following big cuts in 2017.

<text>Naval Air Station Jacksonville (NAS Jacksonville) is a large naval air station located approximately eight miles (13 km) south of the central business district of Jacksonville, Florida, United States.

==Location==
NAS Jacksonville is located in Duval County, Florida, within the city limits of Jacksonville. The base sits on a piece of land between the St. Johns River and Ortega River historically called Black Point. The airbase is part of the overall Jacksonville Naval Complex, a collection of Navy Bases in the Jacksonville Metropolitan Area that include Naval Station Mayport, the former Naval Air Station Cecil Field (now Cecil Airport), Naval Outlying Landing Field Whitehouse, and the Pinecastle Range Complex. It also neighbors a small ghost town called Yukon.

During World War I, the area now occupied by NAS Jacksonville, often referred to colloquially as &quot;NAS Jax&quot;, was named &quot;Camp Joseph E. Johnston&quot;, and was commissioned on October 15, 1917. The United States Army trained quartermasters and the center included more than 600 buildings; by 1918 Camp Johnston was the largest of all Quartermaster mobilization and training camps. The second largest rifle range in the U.S. was constructed there, but the camp was decommissioned on May 16, 1919. The Florida National Guard began using the site in 1928 and it was renamed &quot;Camp J. Clifford R. Foster&quot;. In 1939 a group of 10 ex service men traveled to Washington at their own expense to talk the Navy, who was looking for a new base, to come and look at the old National Guard base, they did and liked what they saw. Most of their names are lost to history. Only two are known: Charles Bennett and Ira Lane. 

=== Jacksonville Naval Complex Commissioning ===

On October 15, 1940, Naval Air Station Jacksonville was officially commissioned, and became the first part of the Jacksonville Navy complex. On the same date, Captain Charles P. Mason, USN, raised his command pennant as the station&#x27;s first commanding officer. Prior to the commissioning, on September 7, Commander Jimmy Grant became the first pilot to land on the still unfinished runway in his N3N-3 biplane. More than 10,000 pilots and 11,000 airmen followed their lead to earn their &quot;wings of gold&quot; at the air station during World War II.

Increased training and construction characterized NAS Jacksonville&#x27;s response to America&#x27;s entry into World War II. Three runways over long were operating, as were seaplane runways in the St. Johns River and seaplane ramps leading from the water. Overhaul and Repair (O&amp;R) facilities were built to rework the station&#x27;s planes, a facility that in ensuing years would be renamed Naval Air Rework Facility Jacksonville (NARF Jax). More than 700 buildings sprung to life on the base before V-J Day (Victory over Japan), including an hospital and a POW camp which housed more than 1,500 German prisoners of war. Archbishop (later Cardinal) Francis J. Spellman dedicated the Catholic Chapel (St. Edward&#x27;s) at its Birmingham Avenue location on January 17, 1943. The chapel and other buildings constructed during the war years, intended for a life of only 20 years, are still in use.
During the late 1940s, the jet age was dawning and in 1948 the Navy&#x27;s first jet carrier air groups and squadrons came to NAS Jacksonville. By April 1949, NAS Jacksonville was the East Coast&#x27;s aircraft capital, with more naval aircraft stationed here than at any other naval base from Nova Scotia to the Caribbean – 60 percent of the Fleet&#x27;s air striking force in the Atlantic area from pole to pole. Fleet Air Wing Eleven made its move to the base, bringing with it Patrol Squadron THREE (VP-3) from NAS Coco Solo, Panama and Patrol Squadron FIVE (VP-5) from NAS San Juan, Puerto Rico. The now famous U.S. Naval Flight Demonstration Squadron, the Blue Angels, who had called NAS Jacksonville home but later moved to NAS Corpus Christi in the late 1940s, performed a last air show at the station on April 29, 1950, before forming the nucleus of an operational fighter squadron, VF-191 (Satan&#x27;s Kittens), which was assigned to combat in Korea. The &quot;Blues&quot; would not return to the station for more than two years. In the early 1950s, Naval Air Technical Training Center (NATTC) Jacksonville was also reactivated and included nine different schools.
In the mid-1950s, an air traffic control center for joint use by the Navy, Air Force, and Civil Aeronautics Administration was approved and completed at a cost of $325,000. Major changes also occurred as parking ramps were added shore-based aircraft hangars and a -long taxiway was built. With the station&#x27;s continuing growth, the Navy was having a tremendous impact on the economic growth in the Jacksonville and Duval County area. The station had over 11,000 military personnel assigned, along with 5,000 civilians and an annual payroll of more than $35 million.

In March 1959, Marine Attack Squadron ONE FOUR TWO (VMA-142) of the Marine Corps Reserve relocated to NAS Jacksonville from the closing MCAS Miami, along with the associated Marine Air Reserve Training Detachment (MARTD). VMA-142 would remain at NAS Jax until its relocation to nearby NAS Cecil Field in 1978.

On July 1, 1957, The United States Air Force Air Defense Command established a Phase III Mobile Radar station at NAS Jacksonville with the 679th Aircraft Warning and Control Squadron operating AN/FPS-3, AN/FPS-8, and AN/MPS-14 radars as part of the integrated ADC radar network. It was designated as ADC site M-114. In 1962 AN/FPS-66 radar and a pair of AN/FPS-6 heightfinder radars were added. During 1962 M-114 joined the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system, and the squadron was re-designated as the 679th Radar Squadron (SAGE) on 1 October 1962. On 31 July 1963, the site was redesignated as NORAD ID Z-114. In addition to the site at NAS Jacksonville, the 679th operated several &quot;Gap Filler&quot; remote sites to extend its radar coverage at Bunnell, FL and Blythe Island, GA. In 1963 M-114 became a joint-use facility with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). It performed routine general radar surveillance until 30 September 1981 when the site was inactivated.

=== Growth and Consolidation ===
In 1970, a major reorganization of the Naval Reserve resulted in three separate Naval Air Reserve flying squadrons, identical to their active duty Regular Navy counterparts, being activated at NAS Jacksonville. These squadrons consisted of Attack Squadron TWO ZERO THREE (VA-203), Patrol Squadron SIXTY-TWO (VP-62) and Fleet Logistics Support Squadron FIFTY-EIGHT (VR-58). VA-203 would later relocate to NAS Cecil Field in 1977, with the remaining reserve squadrons joined by Helicopter Antisubmarine Squadron SEVENTY-FIVE (HS-75) in 1985 following its relocation from NAS Willow Grove, Pennsylvania.

In 1973, with the assignment of Helicopter Antisubmarine Wing One, the station&#x27;s primary mission became antisubmarine warfare. Accompanying the wing were five helicopter squadrons which are still based here today. With the new wings and squadrons, opportunities grew for both sea duty and shore duty assignment to NAS Jacksonville. The station&#x27;s popularity grew and it became one of the most requested duty station for sailors and officers in Naval Aviation throughout the Navy.

A piece of history and Navy and Marine Corps tradition was lost in 1986 when the last unit of Marines left NAS Jacksonville. Marine Barracks Jacksonville had been one of the first groups to arrive at the base in 1940, but left due to mission realignments and a reduction in Marines authorized for Marine Corps Security Force duties at U.S. Naval installations. Force reductions continued in the 1990s and early 2000s with the elimination of P-3 squadrons (VP-24, VP-49, VP-56) and H-60 squadrons (HS-1, HS-9, HS-75).

With the BRAC-directed closure of NAS Brunswick, Maine by mid-2011, Patrol Squadron EIGHT (VP-8), Patrol Squadron TEN (VP-10), Patrol Squadron TWENTY-SIX (VP-26), Special Projects Patrol Squadron ONE (VPU-1) and Fleet Logistics Support Squadron SIXTY-TWO (VR-62) began relocating to NAS Jacksonville in 2007 with their P-3 and C-130T aircraft, with all of these squadrons in place at NAS Jacksonville by late 2010.

==Current operations==
The installation is one of the central hubs for naval activity in the U.S. South, with over 50,000 civilian employees, contractors and active-duty personnel employed.

NAS Jacksonville is home to Patrol Squadron THIRTY (VP-30), the Navy&#x27;s largest aviation squadron and the only P-3 Orion and P-8 Poseidon Fleet Replacement Squadron that prepares pilots, air crew and maintenance personnel for operational assignments in the P-8A, P-3C, and EP-3E Aries in the U.S. Navy, and P-3B, P-3C and similar variants in various NATO and Allied navies and air forces.

In addition, NAS Jacksonville is home to Naval Hospital Jacksonville, under Navy Medicine, which supports all medical programming across naval installations in Florida, including providing the command structure for five Base Health Clinics (BHCs) from Jacksonville to Key West.

Finally, support facilities at NAS Jacksonville include its being an Aviation Maintenance training facility for several aviation ratings (facilitated by the Center for Naval Aviation Technical Training Unit Jacksonville), an additional outlying field (OLF Whitehouse) for pilot training, a maintenance depot employing more than 150 different trade skills capable of performing maintenance as basic as changing a tire to intricate micro-electronics or total engine disassembly, a Fleet Industrial Supply Center, a Navy Family Service Center, a DeCA commissary, Navy Exchange, and recreational facilities for both single sailors and families of the Active, Reserve and Retired military communities.

NAS Jacksonville houses a facility to train pilots for the Northrop Grumman MQ-4C Triton. In addition to that NAS Jacksonville has trained foreign aircrews including that of Royal Australian Navy&#x27;s New Squadron 725.

=== Fleet Readiness Center Southeast ===
Fleet Readiness Center Southeast is the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) maintenance, repair and operations depot for NAS Jacksonville.

The depot was originally founded as Naval Air Rework Facility (NARF) Jacksonville. With the growth of NAS Jacksonville into a major military aviation hub, the facility underwent a major change to keep up with the growth, thus being renamed to Naval Aviation Depot (NADEP) Jacksonville. Around the 1990s, NAVAIR underwent a major reorganization, converting all of its naval air depots into Fleet Readiness Centers, now directed under the Commander, Fleet Readiness Centers (COMFRC); thus, NADEP Jacksonville was renamed Fleet Readiness Center Southeast, and became the depot for all of the Southeastern United States.

Staffed at over 5,000 DoN Civilian Employees, Contractors, and Military personnel, Fleet Readiness Center Southeast is the largest employer in Northeast Florida/Southern Georgia region.

<doc id="1334066" wikidata="Q12052777" url="?curid=1334066" title="Humayun Ahmed">
<text>Humayun Ahmed ( ; 13 November 1948 – 19 July 2012) was a Bangladeshi novelist, dramatist, screenwriter, filmmaker, songwriter, scholar, and academic. His breakthrough was his debut novel &quot;Nondito Noroke&quot; published in 1972. He wrote over 200 fiction and non-fiction books. He was one of the most popular authors and filmmakers in post-independence Bangladesh. Pakistani English newspaper Dawn referred to him as the cultural legend of Bangladesh.

In the early 1990s, Humayun Ahmed emerged as a filmmaker. He went on to make a total of eight films – each based on his novels. Some of his notable films are: &quot;Daruchini Dip&quot;, &quot;Aguner Poroshmoni&quot;, &quot;Srabon Megher Din, Shonkhonil Karagar, Dui Duari, Shyamol Chhaya&quot; and &quot;Ghetuputra Komola.&quot; He was one of the most influential dramatist in Bangladesh during the 1990s, when he wrote the most popular soap operas. His works, such as &quot;Kothao Keu Nei&quot;, &quot;Aaj Robibar&quot;, and &quot;Bohubrihi&quot;, are still considered masterpieces by fans and critics. Many Bangladeshi filmmakers are still inspired by his works. His films &quot;Shyamol Chhaya&quot; and &quot;Ghetuputra Komola&quot; were submitted for the 78th Academy Awards and 85th Academy Awards respectively in the Best Foreign Language Film category. Later he set up his own production company named Nuhash Chalachitra.

Widely regarded as the greatest novelist in Bangladesh&#x27;s history, he is considered one of the cornerstones in modern Bengali literature, his works are characterized by non-violence, realistic storylines, family drama, and humor styles. In recognition of the works of Humayun, &quot;The Times of India&quot; wrote, &quot;Humayun was a custodian of the Bangladeshi literary culture whose contribution single-handedly shifted the capital of Bengali literature from Kolkata to Dhaka without any war or revolution.&quot; and entitled him &quot;The Shakespeare of Bangladesh&quot;. Sunil Gangopadhyay described him as the most popular writer in the Bengali language for a century, and according to him (Sunil), Humayun Ahmed was even more popular than Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay. Humayun Ahmed&#x27;s books have been the top sellers at the Ekushey Book Fair during every year of the 1990s and 2000s. He won the National Film Awards a record seven times in directing, screenplay and story for the films &quot;Ghetuputra Komola&quot;, &quot;Aguner Poroshmoni&quot;, &quot;Shonkhonil Karagar&quot;, &quot;Daruchini Dwip&quot; and Anil Bagchir Ekdin. He also won the Bangla Academy Literary Award in 1981 and the Ekushey Padak in 1994 for his contribution to the Bengali literature.

==Early life and background==
Ahmed was born on 13 November 1948, in the Moulvi Bari of Kutubpur in Netrokona mahakuma, which was then a part of the Mymensingh district of East Bengal in the Dominion of Pakistan (now Bangladesh). His mother, Ayesha Foyez () (1930–2014), was a housewife. His father, Faizur Rahman Ahmed (1921–1971), was a sub-divisional police officer in Pirojpur District and was killed in 1971 during the Bangladesh Liberation War. His grandfather, Azimuddin Ahmed, was the son of the Sufi pir Jahangir Munshi. Humayun&#x27;s brother, Muhammad Zafar Iqbal, is a writer and academician. Another brother, Ahsan Habib, is a cartoonist. He had three sisters – Sufia Haider, Momtaz Shahid and Rukhsana Ahmed.

During his childhood, Humayun Ahmed lived in Sylhet, Comilla, Chittagong, Bogra, Dinajpur and where his father was on official assignment.

==Education and early career==

=== Television and film ===

Ahmed&#x27;s first television drama was &quot;Prothom Prohor&quot; (1983), directed by Nawazish Ali Khan. His first drama serial was &quot;Ei Shob Din Ratri&quot; (1985). This was followed by the comedy series &quot;Bohubrihi&quot; (1988), the historical drama series &quot;Ayomoy&quot; (1988), the urban drama series &quot;Kothao Keu Nei&quot; (1990), &quot;Nokkhotrer Raat&quot; (1996), and &quot;Aaj Robibar&quot; (1999). In addition, he made single episode dramas, most notably &quot;Nimful&quot; (1997). Recurring characters in dramas directed and screenplayed by him are Tara Tin Jon and Alauddiner Cherager Doitto.

Ahmed directed films based on his own stories. His first film, &quot;Aguner Poroshmoni&quot; (1994), based on the Bangladesh Liberation War, won the 19th Bangladesh National Film Awards in a total of eight categories, including the awards for the Best Film and the Best Director. Another film &quot;Shyamal Chhaya&quot; (2005) was also based on the same war. His last directed film, &quot;Ghetuputra Kamola&quot; (2012), the story of a teenage boy, was set in the British colonial period.

&quot;Shyamol Chhaya&quot; and &quot;Ghetuputra Kamola&quot; were selected as the Bangladeshi entries for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 2006 and 2012 respectively, but were not nominated.

In 2009, Ahmed appeared as one of two judges for the reality television music competition show Khude Gaanraj.

Actor Affan Mitul debuted with his drama &quot;Nuruddin Swarna Padak&quot;. It was produced and directed by Humayun Ahmed himself.

His notable singles include &quot;Ekta Chhilo Shonar Konya&quot;, &quot;Pubali Batashey&quot;, &quot;O Amar Ural Ponkhi Rey&quot;, &quot;Jodi Mon Kadey&quot;, &quot;Ke Porailo Amar Chokh-e Kolonko Kajol&quot;, &quot;Chadni Poshor Raite Ke Anay Shoron Kore&quot;, &quot;Ami Aaj Bhejabo Chokh Somudrer Joley&quot;, &quot;Cholona Brishtitey Bhiji&quot;, &quot;Channi Poshor Raite Jeno Amar Moron Hoy&quot;, &quot;&quot;Hablonger Bajarey Giya&quot;, &quot;Boroshar Prothom Dine&quot;, Thikana Amar Notebook E Ache&quot;, &quot;Baje Bongshi&quot;, &quot;Aaj Jorir Biye&quot;, &quot;Cholo Na Jai&quot;, &quot;Chika Maro&quot; and &quot;Konya Nachilo Rey&quot; etc.&quot; The songs were rendered by Subir Nandi, Selim Chowdhury, S I Tutul, Meher Afroz Shaon, Sabina Yasmin, Agun, Kuddus Boyati and others. In his most films and TV dramas, the music composer was Maksud Jamil Mintu.

=== Critical response ===
Nobel laureate economist Muhammad Yunus assessed Ahmed&#x27;s overall impact saying: &quot;Humayun&#x27;s works are the most profound and most fruitful that literature has experienced since the time of Tagore and Nazrul.&quot; Similarly, according to poet Al Mahmud, &quot;one golden age of Bengali literature ended with Tagore and Nazrul and another began with Ahmed&quot;. Writer Imdadul Haq Milan considered him to be &quot;the almighty lord of Bengali literature, controlling all their actions and thoughts&quot;. &quot;Dawn&quot;, Pakistan&#x27;s oldest and most widely read English-language newspaper, referred to him as the cultural legend of Bangladesh. &quot;Times of India&quot; credited Humayun as &quot;the person who single-handedly shifted the capital of Bengali literature from Kolkata to Dhaka&quot;. Sunil Gangopadhyay described him as the most popular writer in the Bengali language for a century and according to him, Ahmed was even more popular than Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay. However, during his lifetime author Shahriar Kabir dismissed him for &quot;always speaking for the establishment.&quot; Literary critic Azfar Hussain said: &quot;I am not surprised he talks like a pro-establishment writer. I find him ignorant.&quot;

=== Controversy ===
On 11 May 2012, two chapters of Ahmed&#x27;s future novel &quot;Deyal&quot; were published in the daily &quot;Prothom Alo&quot;. 3 days later, Attorney General of Bangladesh Mahbubey Alam drew attention of the High Court on a discrepancy about a detail of the historical event of killing Sheikh Russel in Ahmed&#x27;s writing. The court later issued a suo moto rule and asked the authorities to provide Ahmed copies of relevant documents and judgements of the killing case, so that Ahmed could rectify the writing.

==Personal life==
Ahmed married Gultekin Khan in 1973. Together they had three daughters, Bipasha Ahmed, Shila Ahmed, Nova Ahmed and one son, Nuhash Humayun. Shila went on to become a television and film actress and Nuhash became a writer, film director, and producer. Bipasha also acted in a supporting role in &quot;Nokkhotrer Raat&quot; and starred in &quot;Mayaboti&quot;. On 6 June 2004, Ahmed divorced Gultekin. He then married actress Meher Afroz Shaon in 2004. He had two sons from the second marriage, Nishad Humayun and Ninith Humayun. He later had a daughter, Lilaboti, who suffered a neonatal death. A lake in Nuhash Palli was named after her. 

==Death==

Ahmed had open-heart surgery at Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore. A few years later, during a routine checkup, doctors found a cancerous tumor in his colon. On 14 September 2011, he was flown to Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center in New York City for treatment. During his stay there, he wrote the novel, &quot;Deyal&quot;, based on the life of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and Ziaur Rahman after the period of Bangladesh Liberation War. In January 2011, he was appointed as a senior special adviser of the Bangladesh Mission to the United Nations.

On 12 May 2012, Ahmed returned to Bangladesh for two weeks. He died on 19 July 2012, at 11:20pm BST at Bellevue Hospital in New York City. There was some tension in the family over the selection of his burial site, but eventually his estate, Nuhash Palli was selected.

==&quot;Nuhash Palli&quot;==

In 1987, Ahmed founded an estate, &quot;Nuhash Palli&quot;, named after his son Nuhash, near Pirujali village, 25 km from Gazipur City, in Gazipur District, which grew to cover 40 bigha (approximately 14 acres). He would spend much of his time at the estate when he was in Bangladesh. He formed a collection of statues there by local artist Asaduzzaman Khan and another of plants from around the world, particularly medicinal and fruit-bearing trees.

== &quot;Shomudro Bilash&quot; ==

In 1988, he bought a property in the island of Saint Martin with ৳16000 ($132.03) and made a seaside residence named, &#x27;Shomudro Bilash&#x27;. After his death in 2012, his wife Meher Afroz Shaon got the property handed over to her. She turned the residence into a resort. Now, the resort can be rented by tourists.

==Legacy==
Exim Bank, a commercial bank and Anyadin, an entertainment magazine jointly introduced an award program, &quot;Humayun Ahmed Sahitya Puruskar&quot;, which would be conferred to two writers every year on Ahmed&#x27;s birth anniversary – 12 November.

Several cinematographic adaptations of Ahmed&#x27;s stories are made after his death. &quot;Anil Bagchir Ekdin&quot; (2015), directed by Morshedul Islam, won six Bangladesh National Film Awards. &quot;Krishnopokkho&quot; (2016) was directed by Meher Afroz Shaon. In October 2016, she announced the production of her next film based on &quot;Nokkhotrer Raat&quot;. &quot;Debi&quot; (2018) is produced by a grant from the Government of Bangladesh.

<text>Tales From The Engine Room is a remix album of six of eight songs from Marillion&#x27;s &quot;This Strange Engine.&quot; It was conducted by Marc Mitchell and Mark Daghorn of The Positive Light.

==Background==

The album was produced at Aspect Of I Studios, Jersey, Channel Islands, from December 1996 to November 1997.

Mark Daghorn was a long-time Marillion fan and asked the band for permission to remix some of their songs. The band were delighted at what they heard, and gladly gave him the green light to remix their latest album &quot;This Strange Engine.&quot;

A 12 inch single with &quot;Memory of Water,&quot; was released prior to the release for the club scene. &quot;Tales From The Engine Room&quot; was first only released as a limited edition on Marillions own Racket Records 21 January 1998, and was later mastered at Abbey Road Studios by Peter Mew, who was also working with the Marillion Remasters series. With an additional remix of &quot;80 Days&quot;, the album was eventually released worldwide on 22 June 1998 on Eagle Records.

Mitchell left the project and was replaced by Tony Turell (who played on Raingods with Zippos by Fish in 1999). Daghorn and Turell made the Big Beat Mix of &quot;Memory of Water&quot;, as The Silent Buddhas. This version was released on the &quot;These Chains&quot; CD-single in 1998.

Steve Hogarth&#x27;s liner notes on the CD:

&quot;&quot;Vows.&quot;

&quot;We vowed we&#x27;d never let anyone do this.&quot;

&quot;I&#x27;d heard reconstruction&#x27;s and remixes before and it seemed to me that the purpose of the artform, at best, was to produce some kind of cerebral trip, attained through dance in the tribal sense ... often with a bit of help from `substances´. At worst, though, I thought it was just a way of imposing a dance rhythm to a previously arranged song in order to hit another market and make money.&quot;

&quot;When Mark Daghorn succeeded in breaking down the closed doors and playing &quot;Positive Light&quot; to us, we thought again. PL seemed to have an element in their work that we hadn&#x27;t often heard on the genre before... - depth of emotion, empathy, soul or whatever you want to call something which elevates music above mere entertainment. We packed him off back to Jersey with a lead vocal, and a guitar sample from &quot;Estonia&quot;. A month or so later, he appeared at my door and played to me &quot;Positive Light&quot;s reconstruction... and I love it. We all loved it. And so the experiment was born. If, like me, you&#x27;re intimate with Marillion&#x27;s original, it takes a while to get your head away from that and get into this. There&#x27;s even an argument for hearing this album first! The reconstruction of the title track, &quot;This Strange Engine&quot; reduced me to tears. I would advice you to listen to it on a Walkman whilst walking through the town on a Saturday afternoon. It makes everyone move in slow motion!&quot;

&quot;You might not like all of this album, but you&#x27;re going to LOVE some of it. Which tracks you love and hate will depend on what you&#x27;re into and who you are. If you love ALL of it, Congratulations! - you&#x27;re genuinely devoid of prejudice. Vows are often made in a state of innocence and broken in the light of experience. Of this, I&#x27;m positive.&quot;

&quot;Steve H. Dec &#x27;97&quot;&quot;

<text>Gliese 229 (also written as Gl 229 or GJ 229) is a multiple system composed of a red dwarf and two brown dwarfs, located 18.8 light years away in the constellation Lepus. The primary component has 58% of the mass of the Sun, 55% of the Sun&#x27;s radius, and a very low projected rotation velocity of 1 km/s at the stellar equator.

The star is known to be a low activity flare star, which means it undergoes random increases in luminosity because of magnetic activity at the surface. The spectrum shows emission lines of calcium in the H and K bands. The emission of X-rays has been detected from the corona of this star. These may be caused by magnetic loops interacting with the gas of the star&#x27;s outer atmosphere. No large-scale star spot activity has been detected.

The space velocity components of this star are U = +12, V = –11 and W = –12 km/s. The orbit of this star through the Milky Way galaxy has an eccentricity of 0.07 and an orbital inclination of 0.005.

==Brown dwarfs==
A substellar companion was discovered in 1994 by Caltech astronomers Kulkarni, Tadashi Nakajima, Keith Matthews, and Rebecca Oppenheimer, and Johns Hopkins scientists Sam Durrance and David Golimowski. It was confirmed in 1995 as Gliese 229B, It was one of the first brown dwarfs discovered. Although too small to sustain hydrogen-burning nuclear fusion as in a main sequence star, with a mass of around 40 to 60 times that of Jupiter (0.06 solar masses), it is still too massive to be a planet. As a brown dwarf, its core temperature is high enough to initiate the fusion of deuterium with a proton to form helium-3, but it is thought that it used up all its deuterium fuel long ago. This object has a surface temperature of 950 K.
Gliese 229B is the prototype of the T-dwarfs, due to the detection of methane in its spectrum. It also shows other molecules in its atmosphere, namely water vapor, carbon monoxide and ammonia. Atomic absorption lines of caesium, sodium and potassium are also detected.

Gliese 229 B was later found to be a binary brown dwarf. Since 2021 it was suggested to be an unresolved binary, given the inconsistency between the object&#x27;s measured mass and luminosity. Further evidence that Gliese 229B is an equal-mass binary comes from high-resolution spectroscopy from the Subaru Telescope. Gliese 229 B was resolved in 2024 with VLT/GRAVITY and VLT/CRIRES+. The components are called Gliese 229 Ba () and Gliese 229 Bb (). The pair is a tight binary with an orbital period of 12.1 days and a semi-major axis of 0.042 astronomical units (about 16 Earth-Moon distances). The changes in radial velocity extracted from CRIRES+ helped to resolve the orbit of Gliese 229B. The binary has an inclination of 31.4 ±0.3° and an eccentricity of 0.234 ±0.004. The inclination of the binary is misaligned by ° in respect to the orbit of Gliese 229B around Gliese 229A. Additional radial velocity changes between two epochs were detected in Gliese 229B with Keck NIRSPEC. This team independently discovered the binarity of Gliese 229B.

The brown dwarf pair was observed with JWST MIRI low resolution spectroscopy. Previous works showed a difference in abundances between host star and companion in Gliese 229 from near-infrared spectra. This new study using mid-infrared data showed that the pair has abundances consistent with the host star. The metallicities were measured to be C/O = 0.65 ±0.05 and [M/H]= and are equal for each brown dwarf in the pair. The host star has C/O = 0.68 ± 0.12 and [M/H] = −0.02 ± 0.06.

==Search for planets==
In March 2014, a super-Neptune mass planet candidate was announced in a much closer-in orbit around GJ 229. Given the proximity of the Gliese 229 system to the Sun, the orbit of GJ 229 Ab might be fully characterized by the Gaia space-astrometry mission or via direct imaging. In 2020, a super-Earth mass planet was discovered around GJ 229. GJ 229 Ac orbits the star closer in than GJ 229 Ab, located towards the outer edge but still well inside the star&#x27;s habitable zone and in that sense similar to Mars in our own Solar System. While considering GJ 229 Ab unconfirmed, the study estimated a significantly lower minimum mass for it.

However, a more recent study found that when stellar activity was taken in account, the radial velocity signals corresponding to the planets&#x27; orbital periods disappeared. Therefore, intrinsic activity of the host star or errors in the previous observations are the cause of the radial velocity variations, instead of planets, which mean Gliese 229 Ab and Gliese 229 Ac likely do not exist.

<doc id="1334076" wikidata="Q1117987" url="?curid=1334076" title="Interplate earthquake">
<text>An interplate earthquake occurs at the boundary between two tectonic plates. Earthquakes of this type account for more than 90 percent of the total seismic energy released around the world. If one plate is trying to move past the other, they will be locked until sufficient stress builds up to cause the plates to slip relative to each other. The slipping process creates an earthquake with relative displacement on either side of the fault, resulting in seismic waves which travel through the Earth and along the Earth&#x27;s surface. Relative plate motion can be lateral as along a transform fault boundary, vertical if along a convergent boundary (i.e. subduction or thrust/reverse faulting) or a divergent boundary (i.e. rift zone or normal faulting), and oblique, with horizontal and lateral components at the boundary. Interplate earthquakes associated at a subduction boundary are called megathrust earthquakes, which include most of the Earth&#x27;s largest earthquakes.

Intraplate earthquakes are often confused with interplate earthquakes, but are fundamentally different in origin, occurring within a single plate rather than between two tectonic plates on a plate boundary. The specifics of the mechanics by which they occur, as well as the intensity of the stress drop which occurs after the earthquake also differentiate the two types of events. Intraplate earthquakes have, on average, a higher stress drop than that of an interplate earthquake and generally higher intensity.

== Mechanics ==
Mechanically, interplate earthquakes differ from other seismic events in that they are caused by motion at the boundary between two tectonic plates. An interplate earthquake event occurs when the accumulated stress at a tectonic plate boundary are released via brittle failure and displacement along the fault.

There are three types of plate boundaries to consider in the context of interplate earthquake events:

*Transform fault: Where two boundaries slide laterally relative to each other.
*Divergent boundary: Where two boundaries move apart.
*Convergent boundary: Where one plate moves towards, and potentially subducts beneath, another plate.

=== Precursory tremors ===

Scientists have determined that interplate earthquakes are sometimes preceded by an irregular occurrence of small tremors. Precursory tremors are often associated with slow slip along a plate boundary. These precursory tremors can sometimes be identified within days or weeks of an interplate earthquake event and allow researchers to anticipate interplate earthquakes and introduce strategies to mitigate damage.

== Differences with intraplate earthquakes ==
Beyond the inherent mechanical differences leading to interplate earthquake events and location of interplate earthquakes on plate boundaries, these seismic occurrences can be differentiated by other means.

=== Intensity ===

Interplate earthquakes differ from intraplate earthquakes in that the intensity of intraplate earthquakes exceed those of interplate earthquakes by nearly two points. Using the Modified Mercalli Intensity scale, earthquakes are categorized descriptively on a scale from I (not felt) to XII (total destruction) based on observed effects of the seismic event. While the ground accelerations of these two types of events are similar, the resulting intensity of intraplate earthquakes is significantly greater than that of interplate earthquakes due to the greater energy release (stress drop) across intraplate faults.

==== Stress drop ====

Stress drop is a measure of the stress across a fault before and after an earthquake rupture. While intraplate and interplate earthquakes obey similar length proportional scaling laws, interplate earthquakes exhibit stress drop values that are systematically smaller by a factor of 6. This suggests that the boundaries between plates are significantly weaker than the plates themselves. The reason for the measurable, systemic difference in stress drop between interplate and intraplate earthquakes is not entirely understood. However, intraplate earthquake models show that stress is distributed uniformly across the fault whereas interplate earthquakes have stress concentrated in specific areas along the boundary. Furthermore, interplate earthquakes release stress immediately, as compared to intraplate earthquakes which release stress gradually.

== Effects ==

=== Subduction erosion ===

Basal erosion, the process of removal of materials from the underside of the upper plate by the subducting plate, occurs at numerous, but not all, convergent margins. As the process of subduction erosion is not completely understood, a model has been proposed in which basal erosion is supplemented by cyclical, interplate earthquakes. The model suggests that erosion does not occur gradually in subduction zones, but rather in brief episodes of elevated seismicity along the plate boundary.

==== Tsunamis ====
Earthquakes are a major factor in the creation of tsunami waves. As interplate earthquakes result in an immediate release of stress along a fault, they produce significant seismic energy and can cause seafloor uplift, generating large waves as the energy from the sudden slip along the fault is transferred to the overlying water body. However, the majority of interplate earthquakes are not intense enough to create tidal waves, with most tsunamis being caused by intraplate earthquakes or tsunami earthquakes due to their comparatively slow stress release regimes and proximity to the surface of the Earth.

== Major interplate earthquakes ==

Interplate earthquakes account for over 90% of all seismic energy released worldwide. As such, their effects are widespread and interplate earthquake events are numerous. Earthquakes of magnitudes higher than 5 in populated regions are considered highly dangerous and pose a direct threat to human life and property. Some of the largest, most devastating earthquakes that have occurred in the last century have been identified as interplate events. Some areas of the world that are particularly prone to interplate earthquakes due to the presence of prominent plate boundaries include the west coast of North America (especially California and Alaska), the northeastern Mediterranean region (Greece, Italy, and Turkey in particular), Iran, New Zealand, Indonesia, India, Japan, and parts of China.

<text>Barima-Waini (Region 1) is a region of Guyana and is located in the northwest of the country. Barima-Waini has three sub-regions: Mabaruma, Matakai, and Moruca.

The region is located in the northwest of the country and has a population of 26,941. It covers an area of . It borders the Atlantic Ocean to the north, the region of Pomeroon-Supenaam to the east, the region of Cuyuni-Mazaruni to the south and Venezuela to the west.

==History==
Prior to the 1980 administrative reform in Guyana, the Barima-Waini Region was known as the &#x27;North West district&#x27;.

Mabaruma became the administrative centre when it was decided that the former centre, Morawhanna, was too susceptible to flooding.

==Etymology==
The region is named after two rivers that flow through the region: the Barima River and the Waini River.

==Geography==
Barima-Waini is a heavily forested region. The Atlantic coastal strip of Region One features a number of beaches, including, from west to east, Almond Beach, Luri Beach, Shell Beach, Turtle Beach, Foxes Beach, Iron-punt Beach, Pawpaw Beach and Father&#x27;s Beach. Marine turtles nest on some of these beaches. There are also a number of Amerindian communities in this area, including Santa Rosa Mission.

==Economy==
The main economic activities in the Barima-Waini region are forestry and gold mining. The northern and northeastern sections include thousands of acres of rich alluvial soil, whose main crops include coffee, ground provisions (such as cassava, eddoes and yams), cabbage, beans, corn, peanuts, and citrus fruits. (This is the area which supplies the famous Pomeroon cassareep.)

The Matthews Ridge-Port Kaituma manganese industry was discontinued in 1968 when falling world prices made it uneconomical to continue. Mining was resumed as of 2011.

==Major settlements, services and facilities==
The Mabaruma sub-region includes the region&#x27;s capital of Mabaruma, as well as Barabina, Hosororo, Wauna, Kumaka, White Water and Kamwatta.

Moruca sub-region includes Waramuri, Warapoka, Santa Cruz, Kokerite, Chinese Landing, Kwebena and Santa Rosa, and Haimacabra.

Matakai sub-region includes Sebai, Port Kaituma, Matthew&#x27;s Ridge, Baramita, Arakaka, and Morawhanna.

The region has two secondary schools, North West Secondary School in Mabaruma, established in 1965, and Santa Rosa Secondary School, established in 1992.

==Population==
The Government of Guyana has administered four official censuses since the 1980 administrative reforms, in 1980, 1991, 2002, and 2012. In 2002, the population of Barima-Waini was recorded at 24,275 people. Official census records for the population of Barima-Waini are as follows:

==Territorial claim==
Venezuela has renewed its claim to the Essequibo region which is situated west of the Essequibo river. The status of the border controversy is subject to the Geneva Agreement, which was signed by the United Kingdom, Venezuela and British Guiana on February 17, 1966. As of December 2020, the matter is being addressed by the ICJ.

<text>Washington Square West is a neighborhood in Center City, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. The neighborhood roughly corresponds to the area between 7th and Broad Streets and between Chestnut and South Streets, bordering on the Independence Mall tourist area directly northeast, Market East to the north, Old City and Society Hill to the East, Bella Vista directly south, Hawthorne to the southwest, and mid-town Philadelphia and Rittenhouse Square to the west. The area takes its name from Washington Square, a historic urban park in the northeastern corner of the neighborhood. In addition to being a desirable residential community, it is considered a hip, trendy neighborhood that offers a diverse array of shops, restaurants, and coffee houses. Washington Square West contains many gay-friendly establishments, especially in the gay village area of the neighborhood commonly known as the Gayborhood, which hosts annual events celebrating LGBT culture in Philadelphia, including OutFest.

Philadelphia&#x27;s Antique Row lies in the area, as does the nation&#x27;s oldest hospital, Pennsylvania Hospital, and Philadelphia&#x27;s oldest Jewish burial ground, Mikveh Israel Cemetery. Educational and medical facilities associated with Thomas Jefferson University, a leading regional medical university and health care center, are located within the neighborhood. The one-time headquarters of the former Curtis Publishing Company and the University of the Arts lie at the edges of the neighborhood.

Washington Square West&#x27;s real estate is mixed commercial, residential and service industries, characterized by two, three, and four-story rowhouses interspersed with condominiums, mid-rise apartments, hospitals and offices with ground-floor retail. The neighborhood follows William Penn&#x27;s original grid layout for the city, with many one-lane and pedestrian side streets added later as the population became denser. In addition to the block-sized Washington Square Park to the East, the neighborhood contains the smaller Kahn Park, named after the Philadelphia architect Louis Kahn who resided in the neighborhood.

==History==

The name &quot;Washington Square West&quot; came into official use in the late 1950s and early 1960s as part of Edmund Bacon&#x27;s comprehensive plan for Center City. In this plan, the south-east quadrant of center city was split into Washington Square East (more commonly known as Society Hill) and Washington Square West. Both neighborhoods were scheduled for urban renewal by Philadelphia&#x27;s City Planning Commission and Redevelopment Authority. After a period of decline in the early 20th century, city officials hoped that redevelopment would clean up the neighborhood and clear blighted areas.

After large-scale renewal of Washington Square East/Society Hill in the early 1960s, the Philadelphia Redevelopment Authority turned to Washington Square West. In the late 1960s, the Redevelopment Authority bought and demolished buildings and, by the mid-1970s, owned one-fifth of the neighborhood. By this time, however, federal money available for urban renewal had declined and the city was no longer able to fund the renewal of Washington Square West. Buildings razed by the city in the 1960s and 1970s were left as empty lots and the neighborhood was left in a state of decline.

Through the late 1970s and 1980 began a slow recovery without the aid of the large-scale redevelopment that had occurred in Society Hill. The 1990s saw a shift in the neighborhood as Mayor Ed Rendell encouraged investment in Center City and gentrification began to take hold. By the end of the 1990s and early 2000s, the neighborhood had transformed into an economically vital community. In 2003, construction began on what was to be (for a time) the city&#x27;s tallest apartment building, The St. James. The structure also incorporates the 1869 Philadelphia Savings Fund Society Building and the facades of York Row, a series of antique townhomes.

The Washington Square West Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. The area encompasses 450 contributing buildings. Located in the district and separately listed are the Clinton Street Historic District, Roberts-Quay House, and Portico Row.

==The Gayborhood==

The area approximately bounded by Chestnut, Pine, Juniper and 11th streets within Washington Square West is known as The Gayborhood. It is so-named because of its large concentration of LGBT-friendly small businesses, services, restaurants, and gay bars. It was also a red light district and center of Philadelphia&#x27;s gay bathhouse culture in the 1970s and 1980s. The area is the location for Philadelphia&#x27;s annual OutFest: National Coming Out Day celebration. On 18 April 2007, the city of Philadelphia officially recognized the area by adding 36 gay pride rainbow flag symbols to street signs within the Gayborhood area. 32 additional signs were added in June 2010. On 25 June 2015, rainbows, indicating LGBT pride, were painted onto crosswalks at the intersection of 13th and Locust streets.

Its success as a city neighborhood has led to several attempts at large-scale private development in the Gayborhood in the 2000s. In 2002, developer Tony Goldman attempted to change 13th Street and its surroundings into the &quot;Blocks Below Broad&quot; or &quot;B3&quot;, with the launch of several new retail establishments. The attempt failed but was repeated in 2006 by a merchants association organized by James McManaman. While the organization has attempted to re-brand the neighborhood &quot;Midtown Village&quot; and launched new retail establishments along 13th Street, long-time residents, professionals, and proprietors refer to the area as the Gayborhood or Center City. In 2019, the Gayborhood saw its first LGBTQ landmark with the addition to the city historic register of the Camac Baths, which was a meeting place for gay and bisexual men as early as the 1930s. The nomination provides a history of the bathhouse and its LGBTQ associations, which include Christopher Isherwood.

<doc id="1334097" wikidata="Q44737" url="?curid=1334097" title="Zhajiangmian">
<text>Zhajiangmian (; pinyin: &quot;zhájiàngmiàn&quot;), commonly translated as &quot;noodles served with fried bean sauce&quot;, is a dish of Chinese origin consisting of thick wheat noodles topped with &quot;zhajiang&quot;, a fermented soybean-based sauce. Variations may include toppings of fresh or pickled vegetables, beans, meat, tofu, or egg. In the Western press, it is occasionally dubbed &quot;Beijing bolognaise&quot; due to its superficial similarity (both dishes involve noodles with minced meat sauce) and ubiquitous nature.

&quot;Zhajiangmian&quot; originated in Shandong, China and is a popular dish that has evolved into distinct versions across many cuisines both within and beyond China. The most well-known variation is arguably &quot;Beijing zhajiangmian&quot; (北京炸醬麵), which is recognized as one of the Ten Great Noodles of China (中國十大麵條). &quot;Zhajiangmian&quot; has also been adapted into the cuisines of South Korea (as &quot;jajangmyeon&quot;), and Japan (as &quot;jajamen&quot;).

== History ==
The origin of &quot;zhajiangmian&quot; is widely attributed to northern China and sometimes specifically accredited to the coastal province of Shandong.

===Theories of origin===
There are several theories of &quot;zhajiangmian&quot;″s origins, many of which revolve around Chinese monarchs. The veracity of these claims is tenuous as important inventions in Chinese history were frequently attributed to prominent leaders and figures of the time. One theory maintains that the earliest form of &quot;zhajiangmian&quot; was created during the late 16th century in Manchuria by Nurhaci, the Emperor Taizu of Qing. Sources claim that during the Jurchen unification, Nurhaci commanded his troops to &quot;supplant rations with &quot; (以醬代菜) by dissolving solid slabs of fermented soybean (醬坯) in water, creating a protein- and sodium-rich paste, and consuming it as a dip with vegetables.

Another theory suggests that &quot;zhajiangmian&quot; was discovered in Xi&#x27;an, Shaanxi and introduced to Beijing by the Empress Dowager Cixi. In 1900, forces of the Eight-Nation Alliance invaded Beijing. The entire imperial court, including Empress Dowager Cixi and the Guangxu Emperor, fled Beijing and evacuated to Xi&#x27;an. The empress&#x27;s retinues were wearied by the time they reached (南大街) in Xi&#x27;an, where the imperial Grand Supervisor (大總管), Li Lianying, discovered a noodle restaurant by its appetizing aroma. The empress dowager and emperor dined at the restaurant, each partaking of a bowl of vegetarian &quot;zhajiangmian&quot;. Cixi was so impressed by the dish that on their return to Beijing, she ordered that the noodle chef join her court.

Analysis of the subjective factors such as Beijing city development in Qing and Ming dynasties, food supply, climate, people&#x27;s living conditions comes to a conclusion that Bean Paste Noodles and Old Beijing Noodles with Fried Bean Sauce occurred at the same time. The symbolic sign &quot;Old Beijing Noodles with Fried Bean Sauce&quot; is hidden but rich in profound cultural connotation.

==Types==
===Shandong===
In Shandong cuisine, the sauce is made with &quot;tianmianjiang&quot; and this version of &quot;zhajiangmian&quot; is commonly viewed as the standard within China.

===Beijing===
In Beijing cuisine, yellow soybean paste and &quot;tianmianjiang&quot; are combined to make the sauce. During the process of frying the sauce, a large amount of white scallion is added, and diced pork is used instead of ground meat. Typically the dish is served with a variety of crunchy vegetables, such as cucumber, radish, roseheart radish, bean sprouts, celery, and soybeans. Thick handmade noodles are preferred. In China, Beijing-style &quot;zhajiangmian&quot; is the most well-known version, even over the original Shandong &quot;zhajiangmian&quot;.

===Sichuan===

In Sichuan cuisine, &quot;zajiangmian&quot; (雜醬麵) is considered its own version of &quot;zhajiangmian&quot;.
Despite the similarity in name and contents, there is actually no clear evidence that &quot;zajiangmian&quot; originates from &quot;zhajiangmian&quot;. Ground meat is used instead of diced meat. Doubanjiang is also added to the sauce. This results in the &quot;zajiang&quot; meat sauce being more watery than &quot;zhajiang&quot; sauce, and the dish is less salty. Boiled, leafy vegetables are served with the noodles. &quot;Zajiangmian&quot; is typically served in soup, but there is also a version that is mixed directly with the sauce. Chili oil and chopped green onion are usually added as toppings.

===Northeast China===
In Liaoning and Jilin, the &quot;zhajiang&quot; sauce is traditionally fried with Dajiang sauce.
Ground meat is commonly used. Northeast &quot;zhajiang&quot; sauce also has two special variations: &#x27;Egg Zhajiang&#x27; and &#x27;Egg and Green Chili Zhajiang&#x27; which contain no meat.

===Cantonese===
In Cantonese especially Hong Kong cuisine, ketchup and chili sauce is added to the base &quot;zhajiang&quot; sauce and brings a slightly sweet, spicy, and sour flavor.

===Buddhist===
A vegetarian version of &quot;zhajiang&quot; sauce may be made by substituting ground beef or pork with finely diced extra firm smoked tofu (熏豆腐乾), edamame (毛豆), eggplant, or extra firm tofu (素雞). The vegetarian versions generally call for soybean paste of any sort instead of soy sauce, since the tofu chunks are larger and need more structure.

===Islamic=== 
A halal version is often made with ground beef or lamb.

===South Korea===

In South Korea, &quot;zhajiangmian&quot; has evolved into &quot;jajangmyeon&quot; when workers from Shandong were sent by the Chinese military to Korea.

===Taiwan===

In Taiwan, zhajiangmian is served with a special Taiwanese-style sauce, which is prepared by 
cutting pork belly (五花肉) into small square pieces and mixing with doubanjiang (豆瓣醬) and Tianmian sauce (甜麵醬) diluted with water. Then, oil is heated in a pan and ginger and dougan (豆乾) is added with stir-fry. This means that the Taiwanese version is &#x27;lighter&#x27;, with less oil and without the dark sauce. In different parts of Taiwan, there is also a combination of thin noodles, home-rolled noodles and instant noodles. One famous product derived from the zhajiangmian is the instant noodle brand Wei Lih Men (維力炸醬麵) which is popular with Taiwanese people since its release in 1973.

===Japan===

In Japan, &quot;zhajiangmian&quot; evolved into &quot;jajamen&quot; (じゃじゃ麺) when it was brought from Northeast China. It is a popular dish in the northern Japanese city of Morioka, Iwate and is known as one of the three great noodle dishes of Morioka (盛岡三大麺).

== Preparation ==

&quot;Zhajiang&quot; sauce is normally made by simmering stir-fried diced meat or ground pork or beef with salty fermented soybean paste. &quot;Zhajiang&quot; also means &quot;fried sauce&quot; in Chinese. Even though the sauce itself is made by stir-frying, this homonym does not carry over into the Classical Chinese term.

The topping of the noodles usually are sliced fresh or/and pickled vegetables, including cucumber, radish, and pickled edamame, depending on the region. Chopped omelette or in lieu of extra firm tofu can also be alongside. Low-fat dieters often use minced skinless chicken for the meat portion.

<text>Body armor, personal armor (also spelled &quot;armour&quot;), armored suit (&quot;armoured&quot;) or coat of armor, among others, is armor for a person&#x27;s body: protective clothing or close-fitting hands-free shields designed to absorb or deflect physical attacks. Historically used to protect military personnel, today it is also used by various types of police (riot police in particular), private security guards, or bodyguards, and occasionally ordinary citizens. Today there are two main types: regular non-plated body armor for moderate to substantial protection, and hard-plate reinforced body armor for maximum protection, such as used by combatants.


==History==
Many factors have affected the development of personal armor throughout human history. Significant factors in the development of armor include the economic and technological necessities of armor production. For instance full plate armor first appeared in medieval Europe when water-powered trip hammers made the formation of plates faster and cheaper. At times the development of armor has run parallel to the development of increasingly effective weaponry on the battlefield, with armorers seeking to create better protection without sacrificing mobility.

===Ancient===
The first record of body armor in history was found on the Stele of Vultures in ancient Sumer in today&#x27;s south Iraq. The oldest known Western armor is the Dendra panoply, dating from the Mycenaean Era around 1400 BC.
Mail, also referred to as chainmail, is made of interlocking iron rings, which may be riveted or welded shut. It is believed to have been invented by Celtic people in Europe about 500 BC: most cultures that used mail used the Celtic word or a variant, suggesting the Celts as the originators. The Romans widely adopted mail as the lorica hamata, although they also made use of lorica segmentata and lorica squamata. While no non-metallic armor is known to have survived, it was likely to have been commonplace due to its lower cost.

Eastern armor has a long history, beginning in Ancient China. In East Asian history laminated armor such as lamellar, and styles similar to the coat of plates, and brigandine were commonly used. Later cuirasses and plates were also used. In pre-Qin dynasty times, leather armor was made out of rhinoceros. The use of iron plate armor on the Korean peninsula was developed during the Gaya Confederacy of 42 CE - 562 CE. The iron was mined and refined in the area surrounding Gimhae (Gyeongsangnam Province, South Korea). Using both vertical and triangular plate designs, the plate armor sets consisted of 27 or more individual thick curved plates, which were secured together by nail or hinge. The recovered sets include accessories such as iron arm guards, neck guards, leg guards, and horse armor/bits. The use of these armor types disappeared from use on the Korean Peninsula after the fall of the Gaya Confederacy to the Silla Dynasty, during the three kingdoms era Three Kingdoms of Korea in 562 CE.

===Middle Ages===

In European history, well-known armor types include the mail hauberk of the early medieval age, and the full steel plate harness worn by later medieval and Renaissance knights, and a few key components (breast and back plates) by heavy cavalry in several European countries until the first year of World War I (1914–1915).

The Japanese armor known today as samurai armor appeared in the Heian period. (794－1185) These early samurai armors are called the &quot;ō-yoroi and &quot;dō-maru&quot;.

====Plate====

Gradually, small additional plates or discs of iron were added to the mail to protect vulnerable areas. By the late 13th century, the knees were capped, and two circular discs, called besagews were fitted to protect the underarms.

A variety of methods for improving the protection provided by mail were used as armorers seemingly experimented. Hardened leather and splinted construction were used for arm and leg pieces. The coat of plates was developed, an armor made of large plates sewn inside a textile or leather coat.

Early plate in Italy, and elsewhere in the 13th to 15th centuries were made of iron. Iron armor could be carburized or case hardened to give a surface of harder steel. Plate armor became cheaper than mail by the 15th century as it required much less labor and labor had become much more expensive after the Black Death, though it did require larger furnaces to produce larger blooms. Mail continued to be used to protect those joints which could not be adequately protected by plate, such as the armpit, crook of the elbow and groin. Another advantage of plate was that a lance rest could be fitted to the breast plate.
The small skull cap evolved into a bigger true helmet, the bascinet, as it was lengthened downward to protect the back of the neck and the sides of the head. Additionally, several new forms of fully enclosed helmets were introduced in the late 14th century to replace the great helm, such as the sallet and barbute and later the armet and close helm.

Probably the most recognized style of armor in the world became the plate armor associated with the knights of the European Late Middle Ages, but continuing to the early 17th-century Age of Enlightenment in all European countries.

By about 1400, the full harness of plate armor had been developed in armories of Lombardy Heavy cavalry dominated the battlefield for centuries in part because of their armor.

In the early 15th century, small &quot;hand cannon&quot; first began to be used, in the Hussite Wars, in combination with Wagenburg tactics, allowing infantry to defeat armored knights on the battlefield. At the same time crossbows were made more powerful to pierce armor, and the development of the Swiss Pike square formation also created substantial problems for heavy cavalry. Rather than dooming the use of body armor, the threat of small firearms intensified the use and further refinement of plate armor. There was a 150-year period in which better and more metallurgically advanced steel armor was being used, precisely because of the danger posed by the gun. Hence, guns and cavalry in plate armor were &quot;threat and remedy&quot; together on the battlefield for almost 400 years. By the 15th-century, Italian armor plates were almost always made of steel. In Southern Germany armorers began to harden their steel armor only in the late 15th century. They would continue to harden their steel for the next century because they quenched and tempered their product which allowed for the fire-gilding to be combined with tempering.

The quality of the metal used in armor deteriorated as armies became bigger and armor was made thicker, necessitating breeding of larger cavalry horses. If during the 14th and 15th centuries armor seldom weighed more than , then by the late 16th century it weighed . The increasing weight and thickness of late 16th-century armor therefore gave substantial resistance.

In the early years of pistols and arquebuses, black powder muzzleloading firearms were fired at a relatively low velocity (usually below ). The full suits of plate armor, or only breast plates could actually stop bullets fired from a modest distance. The front breast plates were, in fact, commonly shot as a test. The impact point would often be encircled with engraving to point it out. This was called the &quot;proof&quot;. Armor often also bore an insignia of the maker, especially if it was of good quality. Crossbow bolts or quarrels, if still used, would seldom penetrate good plate, nor would any bullet unless fired from close range.
In effect, rather than making plate armor obsolete, the use of firearms stimulated the development of plate armor into its later stages. For most of that period, it allowed horsemen to fight while being the targets of defending arquebusiers without being easily killed. Full suits of armor were actually worn by generals and princely commanders until the 1710s.

====Horse armor====
The horse was afforded protection from cavalry and infantry weapons by steel plate barding. This gave the horse protection and enhanced the visual impression of a mounted knight. Late in the era, elaborate barding was used as parade armor.

===Gunpowder era===

As gunpowder weapons greatly improved from the 16th century onward, it became cheaper and more effective to have groups of unarmored infantry with early guns than to have expensive knights mounted on horseback, which was the primary cause for armor to be largely discarded. Most light cavalry units discarded their armor, though some heavy cavalry units continued to use it, such as German reiters, Polish hussars, and French cuirassiers.

===Late modern use===

Metal armor remained in limited use long after its general obsolescence. Soldiers in the American Civil War (1861–1865) bought iron and steel vests from peddlers (both sides had considered but rejected it for standard issue). The effectiveness of the vests varied widely—some successfully deflected bullets and saved lives but others were poorly made and resulted in tragedy for the soldiers. In any case the vests were abandoned by many soldiers due to their weight on long marches as well as the stigma they got for being cowards from their fellow troops.
At the start of World War I in 1914, thousands of the French cuirassiers rode out to engage the German cavalry who likewise used helmets and armor. By that period, the shiny armor plate was covered in dark paint and a canvas wrap covered their elaborate Napoleonic-style helmets. Their armor was meant to protect only against sabers and lances. The cavalry had to beware of rifles and machine guns, like the infantry soldiers, who at least had a trench to give them some protection.

Some Arditi assault troops of the Italian army wore body armor in 1916 and 1917.

By the end of the war the Germans had made some 400,000 &quot;Sappenpanzer&quot; suits. Too heavy and restrictive for infantry, most were worn by spotters, sentries, machine gunners, and other troops who stayed in one place.

== Modern non-metallic armor ==
Soldiers use metal or ceramic plates in their bullet resistant vests, providing additional protection from pistol and rifle bullets. Metallic components or tightly woven fiber layers can give soft armor resistance to stab and slash attacks from combat knives and knife bayonets. Chain mail armored gloves continue to be used by butchers and abattoir workers to prevent cuts and wounds while cutting up carcasses.

=== Ceramic ===
Boron carbide is used in hard plate armor capable of defeating rifle and armor piercing ammunition. The ceramic material is typically structured with a Kevlar layer on one side and a nylon spall shield on the other, optimizing ballistic resistance against different projectile threats, including various calibers of shells and bullets. Boron carbide ceramics were first used in the 1960s in designing bulletproof vests, cockpit floor and pilot seats of gunships. It was used in armor plates like the SAPI series, and today in most civilian accessible body armors.

Other materials include boron suboxide, alumina, and silicon carbide, which are used for varying reasons from protecting from tungsten carbide penetrators, to improved weight to area ratios. Ceramic body armor is made up of a hard and rigid ceramic strike face bonded to a ductile fiber composite backing layer. The projectile is shattered, turned, or eroded as it impacts the ceramic strike face, and much of its kinetic energy is consumed as it interacts with the ceramic layer; the fiber composite backing layer absorbs residual kinetic energy and catches bullet and ceramic debris (spalling). This allows such armor to defeat armor-piercing 5.56×45mm, 7.62×51mm, and 7.62x39mm bullets, among others, with little or no felt blunt trauma. High-end ceramic armor plates typically utilize ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene fiber composite backing layers, whereas budget plates will utilize aramid or fiberglass.

=== Fibers ===
DuPont Kevlar is well known as a component of some bullet resistant vests and bullet resistant face masks. The PASGT helmet and vest used by United States military forces since the early 1980s both have Kevlar as a key component, as do their replacements. Civilian applications include Kevlar reinforced clothing for motorcycle riders to protect against abrasion injuries. Kevlar in non-woven long strand form is used inside an outer protective cover to form chaps that loggers use while operating a chainsaw. If the moving chain contacts and tears through the outer cover, the long fibers of Kevlar tangle, clog, and stop the chain from moving as they get drawn into the workings of the drive mechanism of the saw. Kevlar is used also in emergency services protection gear if it involves high heat, &quot;e.g.&quot;, tackling a fire, and Kevlar such as vests for police officers, security, and SWAT. The latest Kevlar material that DuPont has developed is Kevlar XP. In comparison with &quot;normal&quot; Kevlar, Kevlar XP is more lightweight and more comfortable to wear, as its quilt stitch is not required for the ballistic package.

Twaron is similar to Kevlar. They both belong to the aramid family of synthetic fibers. The only difference is that Twaron was first developed by Akzo in the 1970s. Twaron was first commercially produced in 1986. Now, Twaron is manufactured by Teijin Aramid. Like Kevlar, Twaron is a strong, synthetic fiber. It is also heat resistant and has many applications. It can be used in the production of several materials that include the military, construction, automotive, aerospace, and even sports market sectors. Among the examples of Twaron-made materials are body armor, helmets, ballistic vests, speaker woofers, drumheads, tires, turbo hoses, wire ropes, and cables.

Another fiber used to manufacture a bullet-resistant vest is Dyneema ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene. Originated in the Netherlands, Dyneema has an extremely high strength-to-weight ratio (a diameter rope of Dyneema can bear up to a load), is light enough (low density) that it can float on water, and has high energy absorption characteristics. Since the introduction of the Dyneema Force Multiplier Technology in 2013, many body armor manufacturers have switched to Dyneema for their high-end armor solutions.

==Protected areas==
===Shield===

A shield is held in the hand or arm. Its purpose is to intercept attacks, either by stopping projectiles such as arrows or by glancing a blow to the side of the shield-user, and it can also be used offensively as a bludgeoning weapon. Shields vary greatly in size, ranging from large shields that protect the user&#x27;s entire body to small shields that are mostly for use in hand-to-hand combat. Shields also vary a great deal in thickness; whereas some shields were made of thick wooden planking, to protect soldiers from spears and crossbow bolts, other shields were thinner and designed mainly for glancing blows away (such as a sword blow). In prehistory, shields were made of wood, animal hide, or wicker. In antiquity and in the Middle Ages, shields were used by foot soldiers and mounted soldiers. Even after the invention of gunpowder and firearms, shields continued to be used. In the 18th century, Scottish clans continued to use small shields, and in the 19th century, some non-industrialized peoples continued to use shields. In the 20th and 21st centuries, ballistic shields are used by military and police units that specialize in anti-terrorist action, hostage rescue, and siege-breaching.

===Head===

A combat helmet is among the oldest forms of personal protective equipment, and is known to have been worn in ancient India around 1700 BC and the Assyrians around 900 BC, followed by the ancient Greeks and Romans, throughout the Middle Ages, and up to the modern era. Their materials and construction became more advanced as weapons became more and more powerful. Initially constructed from leather and brass, and then bronze and iron during the Bronze and Iron Ages, they soon came to be made entirely from forged steel in many societies after about AD 950. At that time, they were purely military equipment, protecting the head from cutting blows with swords, flying arrows, and low-velocity musketry. Some late medieval helmets, like the great bascinet, rested on the shoulders and prevented the wearer from turning his head, greatly restricting mobility. During the 18th and 19th centuries, helmets were not widely used in warfare; instead, many armies used unarmored hats that offered no protection against blade or bullet. The arrival of World War I, with its trench warfare and wide use of artillery, led to mass adoption of metal helmets once again, this time with a shape that offered mobility, a low profile, and compatibility with gas masks. Today&#x27;s militaries often use high-quality helmets made of ballistic materials such as Kevlar and Twaron, which have excellent bullet and fragmentation stopping power. Some helmets also have good non-ballistic protective qualities, though many do not. The two most popular ballistic helmet models are the PASGT and the MICH. The Modular Integrated Communications Helmet (MICH) type helmet has a slightly smaller coverage at the sides which allows tactical headsets and other communication equipment. The MICH model has standard pad suspension and four-point chinstrap. The Personal Armor System for Ground Troops (PASGT) helmet has been in use since 1983 and has slowly been replaced by the MICH helmet.

A ballistic face mask is designed to protect the wearer from ballistic threats. Ballistic face masks are usually made of kevlar or other bullet-resistant materials and the inside of the mask may be padded for shock absorption, depending on the design. Due to weight restrictions, protection levels range only up to NIJ Level IIIA.

===Torso===

A ballistic vest helps absorb the impact from firearm-fired projectiles and shrapnel from explosions, and is worn on the torso. Soft vests are made from many layers of woven or laminated fibers and can be capable of protecting the wearer from small caliber handgun and shotgun projectiles, and small fragments from explosives, such as hand grenades.

Metal or ceramic plates can be used with a soft vest, providing additional protection from rifle rounds, and metallic components or tightly woven fiber layers can give soft armor resistance to stab and slash attacks from a bayonet or knife. Soft vests are commonly worn by police forces, private citizens and private security guards or bodyguards, whereas hard-plate reinforced vests are mainly worn by combat soldiers, police tactical units and hostage rescue teams.

A modern equivalent may combine a ballistic vest with other items of protective clothing, such as a combat helmet. Vests intended for police and military use may also include ballistic shoulder and side protection armor components, and explosive ordnance disposal technicians wear heavy armor and helmets with face visors and spine protection.

===Limbs===
Medieval armor often offered protection for all of the limbs, including metal boots for the lower legs, gauntlets for the hands and wrists, and greaves for the legs. Today, protection of limbs from bombs is provided by a bombsuit. Most modern soldiers sacrifice limb protection for mobility, since armor thick enough to stop bullets would greatly inhibit movement of the arms and legs.

== Performance standards ==
Due to the various different types of projectiles, it is often inaccurate to refer to a particular product as &quot;bulletproof&quot; because this suggests that it will protect against any and all projectiles. Instead, the term bullet resistant is generally preferred.

Standards are regional. Around the world ammunition varies and armor testing must reflect the threats found locally.

While many standards exist, a few standards are widely used as models. The US National Institute of Justice ballistic and stab documents are examples of broadly accepted standards. In addition to the NIJ, the United Kingdom&#x27;s Home Office Scientific Development Branch (HOSDB—formerly the Police Scientific Development Branch (PSDB)) standards are also used by a number of other countries and organizations. These &quot;model&quot; standards are usually adapted by other countries by following the same basic test methodologies, while changing the specific ammunition tested. NIJ Standard-0101.06 has specific performance standards for bullet resistant vests used by law enforcement. This rates vests on the following scale against penetration and also blunt trauma protection (deformation):

In 2018 or 2019, NIJ was expected to introduce the new NIJ Standard-0101.07. This new standard will completely replace the NIJ Standard-0101.06. The current system of using Roman numerals (II, IIIA, III, and IV) to indicate the level of threat will disappear and be replaced by a naming convention similar to the standard developed by UK Home Office Scientific Development Branch. HG (Hand Gun) is for soft armor and RF (Rifle) is for hard armor. Another important change is that the test-round velocity for conditioned armor will be the same as that for new armor during testing. For example, for NIJ Standard-0101.06 Level IIIA the .44 Magnum round is currently shot at for conditioned armor and at for new armor. For the NIJ Standard-0101.07, the velocity for both conditioned and new armor will be the same.

In January 2012, the NIJ introduced BA 9000, body armor quality management system requirements as a quality standard not unlike ISO 9001 (and much of the standards were based on ISO 9001).

In addition to the NIJ and HOSDB standards, other important standards include: the German Police&#x27;s Technische Richtlinie (TR) Ballistische Schutzwesten, Draft ISO prEN ISO 14876, and Underwriters Laboratories (UL Standard 752).

Textile armor is tested for both penetration resistance by bullets and for the impact energy transmitted to the wearer. The &quot;backface signature&quot; or transmitted impact energy is measured by shooting armor mounted in front of a backing material, typically oil-based modelling clay. The clay is used at a controlled temperature and verified for impact flow before testing. After the armor is impacted with the test bullet the vest is removed from the clay and the depth of the indentation in the clay is measured.

The backface signature allowed by different test standards can be difficult to compare. Both the clay materials and the bullets used for the test are not common. In general the British, German and other European standards allow of backface signature, while the US-NIJ standards allow for , which can potentially cause internal injury. The allowable backface signature for this has been controversial from its introduction in the first NIJ test standard and the debate as to the relative importance of penetration-resistance vs. backface signature continues in the medical and testing communities.

In general a vest&#x27;s textile material temporarily degrades when wet. Neutral water at room temp does not affect para-aramid or UHMWPE but acidic, basic and some other solutions can permanently reduce para-aramid fiber tensile strength. (As a result of this, the major test standards call for wet testing of textile armor.) Mechanisms for this wet loss of performance are not known. Vests that will be tested after ISO-type water immersion tend to have heat-sealed enclosures and those that are tested under NIJ-type water spray methods tend to have water-resistant enclosures.

From 2003 to 2005, a large study of the environmental degradation of Zylon armor was undertaken by the US-NIJ. This concluded that water, long-term use, and temperature exposure significantly affect tensile strength and the ballistic performance of PBO or Zylon fiber. This NIJ study on vests returned from the field demonstrated that environmental effects on Zylon resulted in ballistic failures under standard test conditions.

===Ballistic testing V50 and V0===

Measuring the ballistic performance of armor is based on determining the kinetic energy of a bullet at impact. Because the energy of a bullet is a key factor in its penetrating capacity, velocity is used as the primary independent variable in ballistic testing. For most users the key measurement is the velocity at which no bullets will penetrate the armor. Measuring this zero penetration velocity (V0) must take into account variability in armor performance and test variability. Ballistic testing has a number of sources of variability: the armor, test backing materials, bullet, casing, powder, primer and the gun barrel, to name a few.

Variability reduces the predictive power of a determination of V0. If, for example, the V0 of an armor design is measured to be with a 9 mm FMJ bullet based on 30 shots, the test is only an estimate of the real V0 of this armor. The problem is variability. If the V0 is tested again with a second group of 30 shots on the same vest design, the result will not be identical.

Only a single low velocity penetrating shot is required to reduce the V0 value. The more shots made the lower the V0 will go. In terms of statistics, the zero penetration velocity is the tail end of the distribution curve. If the variability is known and the standard deviation can be calculated, one can rigorously set the V0 at a confidence interval. Test Standards now define how many shots must be used to estimate a V0 for the armor certification. This procedure defines a confidence interval of an estimate of V0. (See &quot;NIJ and HOSDB test methods&quot;.)

V0 is difficult to measure, so a second concept has been developed in ballistic testing called V50. This is the velocity at which 50 percent of the shots go through and 50 percent are stopped by the armor. US military standards define a commonly used procedure for this test. The goal is to get three shots that penetrate and a second group of three shots that are stopped by the armor all within a specified velocity range. It is possible, and desirable, to have a penetration velocity lower than a stop velocity. These three stops and three penetrations can then be used to calculate a V50 velocity.

In practice this measurement of V50 often requires 1–2 vest panels and 10–20 shots. A very useful concept in armor testing is the offset velocity between the V0 and V50. If this offset has been measured for an armor design, then V50 data can be used to measure and estimate changes in V0. For vest manufacturing, field evaluation and life testing both V0 and V50 are used. However, as a result of the simplicity of making V50 measurements, this method is more important for control of armor after certification.

==== Cunniff analysis ====
Using dimensionless analysis, Cuniff arrived at a relation connecting the V50 and the system parameters for textile-based body armors. Under the assumption that the energy of impact is dissipated in breaking the yarn, it was shown that
:formula_1
Here, 
:formula_2
:formula_3 are the failure stress, failure strain, density and elastic modulus of the yarn
:formula_4 is the mass per unit area of the armor
:formula_5 is the mass per unit area of the projectile

===Military testing===

After the Vietnam War, military planners developed a concept of &quot;Casualty Reduction&quot;. The large body of casualty data made clear that in a combat situation, fragments, not bullets, were the greatest threat to soldiers. After World War II vests were being developed and fragment testing was in its early stages. Artillery shells, mortar shells, aerial bombs, grenades, and antipersonnel mines are fragmentation devices. They all contain a steel casing that is designed to burst into small steel fragments or shrapnel, when their explosive core detonates. After considerable effort measuring fragment size distribution from various NATO and Soviet Bloc munitions, a fragment test was developed. Fragment simulators were designed and the most common shape is a Right Circular Cylinder or RCC simulator. This shape has a length equal to its diameter. These RCC Fragment Simulation Projectiles (FSPs) are tested as a group. The test series most often includes , , , and mass RCC FSP testing. The 2-4-16-64 series is based on the measured fragment size distributions. 
The second part of &quot;Casualty Reduction&quot; strategy is a study of velocity distributions of fragments from munitions. Warhead explosives have blast speeds of to . As a result, they are capable of ejecting fragments at speeds of over , implying very high energy (where the energy of a fragment is mass × velocity2, neglecting rotational energy). The military engineering data showed that, like the fragment size, the fragment velocities had characteristic distributions. It is possible to segment the fragment output from a warhead into velocity groups. For example, 95% of all fragments from a bomb blast under have a velocity of or less. This established a set of goals for military ballistic vest design.

The random nature of fragmentation required the military vest specification to trade off mass vs. ballistic-benefit. Hard vehicle armor is capable of stopping all fragments, but military personnel can only carry a limited amount of gear and equipment, so the weight of the vest is a limiting factor in vest fragment protection. The 2-4-16-64 grain series at limited velocity can be stopped by an all-textile vest of approximately . In contrast to deformable lead bullets, fragments do not change shape; they are steel and can not be deformed by textile materials. The FSP (the smallest fragment projectile commonly used in testing) is about the size of a grain of rice; such small, fast-moving fragments can potentially slip through the vest, moving between yarns. As a result, fabrics optimized for fragment protection are tightly woven, although these fabrics are not as effective at stopping lead bullets.

By the 2010s, the development of body armor had been stymied in regards to weight, in that designers had trouble increasing the protective capability of body armor while still maintaining or decreasing its weight.

<text>Michael C. Feldman (December 29, 1927 – May 10, 2023) was a Canadian politician in Toronto, Ontario. He was a municipal councillor from 1992 to 2010, and served as deputy mayor from 2003 to 2006.

==Background==
Before entering municipal politics, Feldman was a businessman who founded Teela Data Management, a company specializing in real estate information, which was sold to Moore Corporation Ltd. in 1982. He retired from business in 1988.

Feldman served as president of the Beth Emeth Bais Yehuda Synagogue and of the Ontario Region of the United Synagogue of America, the central organization of synagogues in Conservative Judaism. He was active with the Canadian Council of Christians and Jews.

Feldman and his wife, Sue, had three children. He died on May 10, 2023, at the age of 95.

==Politics==
Feldman was elected in 1992 in a by-election to North York council to replace longtime councillor Irv Chapley who had died in office early in the year. In addition to his job as a municipal councillor, he served as chair of the Metro Housing Development Corporation, a public housing agency serving the second-tier municipality of Metropolitan Toronto. In 1997 he was elected to the newly amalgamated Toronto City Council.

Feldman was a longtime supporter of Mel Lastman, the generally conservative mayor first of North York, then of the merged Toronto until 2003. In that year&#x27;s municipal election, Feldman supported John Tory, a moderate conservative, for mayor. When David Miller, a social democrat, was elected, one of his first appointments was to name Feldman one of his three Deputy Mayors, jointly with Joe Pantalone and Sandra Bussin.

Along with the appointment of fellow councillor David Soknacki as budget chief, Feldman’s appointment was seen as a key outreach to conservatives on the new mayor’s part. The left-wing alternative weekly newspaper ‘’Now‘’ magazine wrote that “Miller has long respected Feldman’s financial acumen and his commitment to neighbourhood issues. The retired business executive is a straight-shooting conservative who can get along with both sides at council and give North York a high-profile voice at City Hall.”

After the 2006 election, Miller appointed a single deputy mayor, Pantalone. In 2009, Feldman joined the Responsible Government Group, a conservative caucus seen as an unofficial opposition to Miller and the centre-left majority of council.

<text>The phurba (; alternate transliterations: &quot;phurpa&quot;, &quot;phurbu&quot;, &quot;purbha&quot;, or &quot;phurpu&quot;) or kīla (Sanskrit Devanagari: कील; IAST: kīla) is a three-sided peg, stake, knife, or nail-like ritual implement deeply rooted in Indo-Tibetan Buddhism and Bön traditions. Its primary association is with the meditational deity Vajrakīlaya (Dorje Phurba), embodying the essence of transformative power. The etymology and historical context of the term reveal some debate. Both the Sanskrit word &quot;kīla&quot; and the Tibetan &quot;phurba&quot; are used interchangeably in sources.

The construction of the phurba is diverse, featuring a pommel, handle, and a blade with three triangular facets. The composition often revolves around the numerological significance of three and nine, with materials ranging from wood and metal to bone and crystal. Phurba blades can be made from meteoric iron, which holds symbolic importance. The pommel typically displays faces of Vajrakīlaya or other sacred motifs. This implement is not intended as a physical weapon, but rather as a spiritual tool, embodying stability and energetic continuity.

The phurba&#x27;s ritual usage is extensive and encompasses various practices. It is used to establish stability during ceremonies and symbolizes powerful attributes of Vajrayana deities. The phurba&#x27;s energy is fierce and transfixing, used for purposes such as exorcism, weather manipulation, meditation, and blessings. The implement&#x27;s connection with Vajrakilaya represents the transmutation of negative energies.

In diverse cultural contexts, the phurba maintains its significance. It remains in use among shamans, magicians, tantrikas, and lamas of various ethnic backgrounds. Different traditions and lineages emphasize various aspects of the phurba, using it for healing, meditation, and connecting with spiritual energies. Ultimately, the phurba stands as a potent emblem of transformation, symbolic power, and the interconnectedness of the spiritual and material realms.

==Etymology==
Most of what is known of the Indian &quot;kīla&quot; lore has come by way of Tibetan culture. Scholars such as F. A. Bischoff, Charles Hartman and Martin Boord have shown that the Tibetan literature widely asserts that the Sanskrit for their term &quot;phurba&quot; is &quot;kīlaya&quot; (with or without the long &quot;i&quot;). However, as Boord describes it, 

Mayer (1996) contests Boord&#x27;s assertion, pointing out that eminent Sanskritists such as Sakya Pandita employed &quot;Vajrakīlaya&quot;. Further, he argues:

==Fabrication and components==

The fabrication of phurba is quite diverse. Having pommel, handle, and blade, phurba are often segmented into suites of triunes on both the horizontal and vertical axes, though there are notable exceptions. This compositional arrangement highlights the numerological importance and spiritual energy of the integers three and nine. Phurba may be constituted and constructed of different materials and material components, such as wood, metal, clay, bone, gems, horn or crystal.

Like the majority of traditional Tibetan metal instruments, the phurba is often made from brass and iron (terrestrial and/or meteoric iron. &#x27;Thokcha&#x27; () means &quot;thunder-iron&quot; in Tibetan and refers to tektites and meteorites which are often high in iron content. Meteoric iron was highly prized throughout the Himalaya where it was included in sophisticated polymetallic alloys such as &quot;Panchaloha&quot; for ritual implements. The pommel of the phurba often bears three faces of &quot;Vajrakīla&quot;, one joyful, one peaceful, one wrathful, but may bear the umbrella of the &quot;ashtamangala&quot; or mushroom cap, &quot;Yidam&quot; (like &quot;Hayagriva&quot;) , snow lion, or &quot;stupa&quot;, among other possibilities. The handle is often of a &quot;vajra&quot;, weaving or knotwork design. The handle generally has a triune form as is common to the pommel and blade. The blade is usually composed of three triangular facets or faces, meeting at the tip. These represent, respectively, the blade&#x27;s power to transform the negative energies known as the &quot;three poisons&quot; or &quot;root poisons&quot; (Sanskrit: &quot;mula klesha&quot;) of attachment/craving/desire, delusion/ignorance/misconception, and aversion/fear/hate.

==Ritual usage==
Cantwell and Mayer (2008) have studied a number of texts recovered from the cache of the Dunhuang manuscripts that discuss the phurba and its ritual usage.

The phurba is one of many iconographic representations of divine symbolic attributes (Tibetan: &quot;phyag mtshan&quot;) of Vajrayana and Hindu deities. When consecrated and bound for usage, Phurba are a &quot;nirmanakaya&quot; manifestation of &quot;Vajrakīlaya&quot;.

Chandra, &quot;et al.&quot; in their dictionary entry &#x27;korkor&#x27; () &quot;coiled&quot; (English) relates that the text titled the &quot;&#x27;Vaidūry Ngonpo&quot;&#x27; () has the passage: ཐག་བ་ཕུར་བ་ལ་ཀོར་ཀོར་བྱམ &quot;a string was wound round the (exorcist&#x27;s) dagger [phurba].&quot;

One of the principal methods of working with the phurba and to actualize its essence-quality is to pierce the earth with it; sheath it; or as is common with Himalayan shamanic traditions, to penetrate it vertically, point down into a basket, bowl or cache of rice (or other soft grain if the phurba is wooden). The terms employed for the deity and the tool are interchangeable in Western scholarship. In the Himalayan shamanic tradition, the phurba may be considered as axis mundi. Müller-Ebelling, &quot;et al.&quot; affirm that for the majority of Nepalese shaman, the phurba is cognate with the &quot;world tree&quot;, either in their visualisations or in initiatory rites or other rituals.

The phurba is used as a ritual implement to signify stability on a prayer ground during ceremonies, and only those initiated in its use, or otherwise empowered, may wield it. The energy of the phurba is fierce, wrathful, piercing, affixing, transfixing. The phurba affixes the elemental process of &#x27;space&#x27; (Sanskrit: ākāśa) to the Earth, thereby establishing an energetic continuum. Phurba, particularly those that are wooden are for shamanic healing, harmonizing and energy work and often have two &quot;nāgas&quot; (Sanskrit for snake, serpent and/or dragon, also refers to a class of supernatural entities or deities) entwined on the blade. Phurba often also bear the &quot;ashtamangala&quot;, &quot;swastika&quot;, &quot;sauwastika&quot; and/or other Himalayan, Tantric or Hindu iconography or motifs.

The phurba as an iconographical implement is also directly related to &quot;Vajrakilaya&quot;, a wrathful deity of Tibetan Buddhism who is often seen with his consort Diptacakra (Tib. &#x27;khor lo rgyas &#x27;debs ma). He is embodied in the phurba as a means of destroying (in the sense of finalising and then freeing) violence, hatred, and aggression by tying them to the blade of the phurba and then transmuting them with its tip. The pommel may be employed in blessings. It is therefore that the phurba is not a physical weapon, but a spiritual implement, and should be regarded as such.

As Müller-Ebeling, &quot;et al.&quot; state:

As Beer states:

===Cultural context===
To work with the spirits and deities of the earth, land and place, people of India, the Himalayas and the Mongolian Steppe pegged, nailed and/or pinned down the land. The nailing of the phurba is comparable to the idea of breaking the earth (turning the sod) in other traditions and the rite of laying the foundation stone. It is an ancient shamanic idea that has common currency throughout the region; it is prevalent in the Bön tradition and is also evident in the Vajrayana tradition. According to shamanic folklore current throughout the region, &quot;...the mountains were giant pegs that kept the Earth in place and prevented it from moving.&quot; Mountains such as Amnye Machen, according to folklore were held to have been brought from other lands just for this purpose.

Kerrigan, &quot;et al.&quot;, state that:

Traditions such as that of the phurba may be considered a human cultural universal in light of foundation stone rites and other comparable rites documented in the disciplines of anthropology and ethnography; e.g., turning of the soil as a placation and votive offering to spirits of place and to preparation of the land as a rite to ensure fertility and bountiful yield.

===Traditional lineage usage===
In the Kathmandu Valley, the phurba is still in usage by shamans, magicians, tantrikas and lamas of different ethnic backgrounds. The phurba is used particularly intensively by the Tamang, Gurung and Newar peoples. The phurba is also employed by the Tibetans native to Nepal (the Bhotyas), the Sherpas, and the Tibetans living in Dharamasala. The phurba is also used in religious rituals in Bhutan, and can most often be found in the temples and altars of Bhutan.

Müller-Ebelling, &quot;et al.&quot;, chart the difference of the traditions between the &quot;jhankris&quot; and the &quot;gubajus&quot;:

A &quot;Bhairab kīla&quot; is an important healing tool of the tantric Newari gubajus. As Müller-Ebelling, &quot;et al.&quot; state:

Müller-Ebelling, &quot;et al.&quot; interviewed Mohan Rai, a shaman from the border area of Nepal and Bhutan and belongs to the Mongolian people of the Rai and/or Kirati. Mohan Rai is the founder of the Shamanistic Studies and Research Centre in Kathmandu, Nepal. In the interview Rai says:

<text>Radiation is the tenth studio album by the British neo-prog band Marillion, released in 1998. Recorded at The Racket Club between November 1997 and June 1998, it was co-produced and mixed by Stewart Every. The album was remixed by Michael Hunter in September to November 2012 and a reissued remastered version was released in 2013.

==Background==
For this album the band decided to experiment with different instrument tones, vocal effects, samples (making transitions between songs by cutting and pasting pieces from elsewhere in the album), and the like. As the album recording progressed, there was &quot;a desire for new sounds and a desire not to repeat ourselves and to fall into familiar patterns&quot;, according to guitarist Steve Rothery.

The first element was that Rothery decided he wanted a different guitar sound. They placed a ban on digital delay and chorus which had been Rothery&#x27;s sound for years. He borrowed a Gretsch from Dave Gregory, and played on a Harmony guitar on the bluesy &quot;Born To Run&quot;. Mark Kelly used a new Roland JP8000, a virtual analogue synth which was very versatile, and he placed a ban on string synths. Pete Trewavas used quite a lot of his old Rickenbacker fuzz bass on the album.

During the recording sessions, the tracks &quot;Tumble Down the Years&quot; and &quot;Interior Lulu&quot; were recorded and mixed, but it was decided to leave them for the next album, &quot;marillion.com&quot; (1999), as the band thought the songs were incomplete.

They also tried a different approach to mixing that left certain fans criticise the production quality of the album. Rothery said: &quot;I wanted to completely remix it. I think it’s an album with good material, poorly mixed. Sonically it’s a bit flat.&quot;

Drummer Ian Mosley said: &quot;We tried to step outside ourselves, it sounds like a second rate version of who we were trying to copy. It backfired. I found it too harsh, not musical enough.&quot;

The entire album was significantly remixed 14 years later by Michael Hunter to give a different perspective and rectify many of those complaints.

For the first time ever on tour there were no Fish-era songs in the setlist. &quot;We are playing our most recent material really which is six albums worth&quot; claimed Mark Kelly at the time.

Marillion recorded a promo video for the single &quot;These Chains&quot;. Hogarth said in 1998: &quot;Well, essentially the idea of the video was to put me down in a well. Water is dropping on me and the idea is that as a consequence of the water raining into the well the level of the water subsequently rises and I climb to freedom in the end. So it was a metaphor for being trapped only to find that what trapped you released you. So that was it in its simpliest terms. What it amounts to really was me standing in a lot of cold water all day&quot;.&quot;&quot;

==Release==
&quot;Radiation&quot; was released in Europe on 21 September 1998 by the Castle Communications imprint Raw Power. It was the second of the three recordings Marillion made on a contract with Castle Communications between being dropped by EMI Records in 1995 and eventually going independent in the 2000s. Due to an announcement on the band&#x27;s official website before the release, the album&#x27;s title had been incorrectly listed as either &quot;Don&#x27;t Try This at Home&quot; or &quot;Radiation Leak&quot;. As Marillion&#x27;s tenth studio album, the number 10 can be seen in the &quot;io&quot; in both &quot;marillion&quot; and &quot;radiation&quot; on the front cover.

The album peaked at number 35 in the UK charts and stayed there for just one week, making it the last Marillion album to enter the Top 40 until &quot;Somewhere Else&quot; (2007). The only single released from &quot;Radiation&quot; was &quot;These Chains&quot; which stalled at number 78 in the UK Singles Chart.

In the autumn of 2012, &quot;Radiation&quot; was remixed by Michael Hunter, and re-released in March 2013 by Madfish as a 2CD deluxe edition containing both the original and the new mixes as well as featuring re-designed artwork by Carl Glover. In July 2013, Hunter&#x27;s mix was issued on double 180gm heavyweight translucent blue vinyl. Some of the remixed tracks are shorter because the cut-and-paste reprises were eliminated (see track listing below), making the 2013 version almost two minutes shorter than the original.

<doc id="1334123" wikidata="Q904190" url="?curid=1334123" title="Quantum Darwinism">
<text>Quantum Darwinism is a theory meant to explain the emergence of the classical world from the quantum world as due to a process of Darwinian natural selection induced by the environment interacting with the quantum system; where the many possible quantum states are selected against in favor of a stable pointer state. It was proposed in 2003 by Wojciech Zurek and a group of collaborators including Ollivier, Poulin, Paz and Blume-Kohout. The development of the theory is due to the integration of a number of Zurek&#x27;s research topics pursued over the course of 25 years, including pointer states, einselection and decoherence.

A study in 2010 is claimed to provide preliminary supporting evidence of quantum Darwinism with scars of a quantum dot &quot;becoming a family of mother-daughter states&quot; indicating they could &quot;stabilize into multiple pointer states&quot;; additionally, a similar kind of scene has been suggested with perturbation-induced scarring in disordered quantum dots (see scars). 
However, the claimed evidence is also subject to the circularity criticism by Ruth Kastner (see Implications below). Basically, the de facto phenomenon of decoherence that underlies the claims of Quantum Darwinism may not really arise in a unitary-only dynamics. Thus, even if there is decoherence, this does not show that macroscopic pointer states naturally emerge without some form of collapse.

==Implications==
Along with Zurek&#x27;s related theory of envariance (invariance due to quantum entanglement), quantum Darwinism seeks to explain how the classical world emerges from the quantum world and proposes to answer the quantum measurement problem, the main interpretational challenge for quantum theory. The measurement problem arises because the quantum state vector, the source of all knowledge concerning quantum systems, evolves according to the Schrödinger equation into a linear superposition of different states, predicting paradoxical situations such as &quot;Schrödinger&#x27;s cat&quot;; situations never experienced in our classical world. Quantum theory has traditionally treated this problem as being resolved by a non-unitary transformation of the state vector at the time of measurement into a definite state. It provides an extremely accurate means of predicting the value of the definite state that will be measured in the form of a probability for each possible measurement value. The physical nature of the transition from the quantum superposition of states to the definite classical state measured is not explained by the traditional theory but is usually assumed as an axiom and was at the basis of the debate between Niels Bohr and Albert Einstein concerning the completeness of quantum theory.

Quantum Darwinism seeks to explain the transition of quantum systems from the vast potentiality of superposed states to the greatly reduced set of pointer states as a selection process, einselection, imposed on the quantum system through its continuous interactions with the environment. Recent developments, such as Karl Seelig&#x27;s 2024 publication Twilight Dimension Model: The Origin of Time (ISBN-13: 979-8302487568), propose mechanisms complementing Quantum Darwinism. The Twilight Dimension Model suggests that the selection of pointer states could emerge from higher-dimensional systems projecting into our observable reality, providing additional theoretical support for the Darwinian processes in quantum systems.All quantum interactions, including measurements, but much more typically interactions with the environment such as with the sea of photons in which all quantum systems are immersed, lead to decoherence or the manifestation of the quantum system in a particular basis dictated by the nature of the interaction in which the quantum system is involved. In the case of interactions with its environment Zurek and his collaborators have shown that a preferred basis into which a quantum system will decohere is the pointer basis underlying predictable classical states. It is in this sense that the pointer states of classical reality are selected from quantum reality and exist in the macroscopic realm in a state able to undergo further evolution. However, the &#x27;einselection&#x27; program depends on assuming a particular division of the universal quantum state into &#x27;system&#x27; + &#x27;environment&#x27;, with the different degrees of freedom of the environment posited as having mutually random phases. This phase randomness does not arise from within the quantum state of the universe on its own, and Ruth Kastner has pointed out that this limits the explanatory power of the Quantum Darwinism program. Zurek replies to Kastner&#x27;s criticism in &quot;Classical selection and quantum Darwinism&quot;.

As a quantum system&#x27;s interactions with its environment results in the recording of many redundant copies of information regarding its pointer states, this information is available to numerous observers able to achieve consensual agreement concerning their information of the quantum state. This aspect of einselection, called by Zurek &#x27;Environment as a Witness&#x27;, results in the potential for objective knowledge.

==Darwinian significance==
Perhaps of equal significance to the light this theory shines on quantum explanations is its identification of a Darwinian process operating as the selective mechanism establishing our classical reality. As numerous researchers have made clear any system employing a Darwinian process will evolve. As argued by the thesis of Universal Darwinism, Darwinian processes are not confined to biology but are all following the simple Darwinian algorithm:

# Reproduction/Heredity; the ability to make copies and thereby produce descendants.
# Selection; A process that preferentially selects one trait over another trait, leading to one trait being more numerous after sufficient generations.
# Variation; differences in heritable traits that affect &quot;Fitness&quot; or the ability to survive and reproduce leading to differential survival.

Quantum Darwinism appears to conform to this algorithm and thus is aptly named: 

#The Twilight Dimension Model by Karl Seelig aligns with this view, positing that the emergence of stable pointer states involves constraints from a higher-order framework, thereby refining the selection mechanism inherent in Quantum Darwinism.
# Numerous copies are made of pointer states
# Successive interactions between pointer states and their environment reveal them to evolve and those states to survive which conform to the predictions of classical physics within the macroscopic world. This happens in a continuous, predictable manner; that is descendants inherit many of their traits from ancestor states.
# The analogy to the Variation principle of &quot;simple Darwinism&quot; does not exist since the Pointer states do not mutate and the selection by the environment is among the pointer states preferred by the environment (e.g. location states).

From this view quantum Darwinism provides a Darwinian explanation at the basis of our reality, explaining the unfolding or evolution of our classical macroscopic world.

<doc id="1334130" wikidata="Q2587924" url="?curid=1334130" title="Posadnik">
<text>A posadnik (, ) was a representative of the prince in some towns during the times of Kievan Rus&#x27;, and later the highest-ranking official (mayor) in Novgorod (from 1136) and Pskov (from 1308).

In the early 12th century, Novgorod won the right to elect its own posadnik, who was originally appointed by the prince to rule on his behalf during his absence, thus the posadnik became the elected burgomaster. In 1136, the prince Vsevolod was expelled and the Novgorod veche began to appoint and expel princes at its own will. The posadnik was so much of an official that the representative of the prince became known as the namestnik.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;posadnik&quot; appears to be derived from the early process of princely representation, when the prince placed (&quot;posadi&quot;) his men in towns such as Novgorod.

==History==
===Novgorod===

Despite legends of posadniks such as Gostomysl that were set in the 9th century, the term &quot;posadnik&quot; first appears in the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; under the year 977. The earliest Novgorodian posadniks include Dobrynya (an uncle of Vladimir the Great), his son Konstantin Dobrynich and Ostromir, who is famous for patronizing the &quot;Ostromir Gospels&quot;, among the first books published in Russia (it is now housed in the National Library of Russia in St. Petersburg). 

In the Novgorod Republic, the city posadnik was elected from among the boyars by the Novgorod veche (public assembly). The elections were held annually. Novgorodian boyars differed from boyars in the other principalities in that the category was not caste-like and that every rich merchant could reasonably hope to reach the rank of boyar. Valentin Yanin, the Soviet &quot;dean&quot; of medieval Novgorodian history, has found that most posadniks held the office consecutively for sometimes a decade or more and then often passed the office on to their sons or another close relative, indicating that the office was held within boyar clans and that the elections were not really &quot;free and fair&quot;. Yanin&#x27;s theory challenged historians&#x27; understanding of the Novgorod Republic, showing it to be a boyar republic with little or no democratic elements. It also showed the land-owning boyarstvo to be more powerful than the merchant and artisan classes, which until that time were thought to play a significant role in the political life of the city. It also called into question the true nature of the veche, which up until that time had been considered democratic by most scholars. However, Yanin&#x27;s interpretation of the Novgorod government as a hereditary oligarchy is not universally accepted.

Originally, there was one posadnik, but gradually over time the office multiplied until, by the end of the republic, there were something like 24 posadniks. There were also posadniks for each of the city&#x27;s boroughs (called ends - &quot;kontsy&quot;, singular &quot;konets&quot; in Russian). The multiplication of the office dates to the 1350s, when the posadnik Ontsifor Lukinich implemented a series of reforms. Retired posadniks took the title &quot;old posadnik&quot; (старый посадник) and the current, serving posadnik was known as the &quot;stepenny&quot; posadnik (степенный посадник). In accordance with the reform of 1416–1417, the number of posadniks was increased threefold and &quot;stepenny&quot; posadniks were to be elected for a six-month period. In this manner, the various boyar clans could share power and one or another of them would neither monopolize power or be left out if they lost an election. However, it diluted power in the &quot;boyarstvo&quot;. Some scholars have argued that the archbishop of Novgorod became the head of the republic and stood above the fray of partisan politics that raged among the boyardom, but the archbishops seem to have shared power with the boyardom and the collective leadership tried to rule by consensus. The dilution of boyar power may, however, have weakened Novgorod in the 15th century, thus explaining the series of defeats it suffered at Moscow&#x27;s hands and the eventual end of its independence. 

The posadnikdom (mayoralty) was abolished along with the veche when Ivan III, the grand prince of Moscow, took full control of the city in 1478. In fact, upon being asked by Archbishop Feofil (1470–1480) on behalf of the Novgorodians what type of government he wanted, Ivan (speaking through Vassian Patrikeyev) told them &quot;there will be no veche bell in our patrimony of Novgorod; there will be no posadnik, and we will conduct our own government&quot;.

===Pskov===

There were 78 known posadniks in Pskov between 1308 and 1510. The &quot;posadnichestvo&quot; was abolished in Pskov in 1510 when Grand Prince Vasili III took direct control of the city.

<text>The [[Toyota]] R family was a series of inline-four gasoline automobile engines. Designed for longitudinal placement in such vehicles as the Celica and Hilux and in production from 1953 through 1997, usage faded out as many of Toyota&#x27;s mainstream models moved to front-wheel drive. Overhead cam (OHC) versions featured a chain-driven camshaft.

==History of the R family==

===R===
The R family was produced from 1953 through 1964, and was originally manufactured at the Toyota Honsha plant.

Bore and stroke was . In common with new engines of the time, it was made from cast iron (both the block and the head), water cooled, used a three bearing crank, 12V electrics and a side-mounted gear-driven camshaft controlling overhead valves via pushrods in a non-cross flow head (exhaust and inlet manifolds being on the same side of the engine). Induction was by a twin throat down-draft carburettor, the compression ratio was 8.0:1 and the total weight was . An LPG version, the R-LPG, was produced for the last two years.

The R engine was the Toyota engine used in the 1958 Toyota Crown, the first model to be exported to the United States. &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; was unimpressed with the engine on its introduction, noting that it idled quietly but was &quot;not capable of very high revolutions per minute.&quot;

Applications:
* 1953–1955 Toyota Super
* 1955–1956 Toyota Master
* 1955–1958 Toyota Crown

===2R===
The 2R family was produced from 1964 through 1971. It is a square engine, with bore and stroke of .

Again, an LPG version, the 2R-LPG, was produced alongside the gasoline version. Production had been gradually transferred from the original Honsha plant to the new Toyota Kamigo plant in 1968.

Applications:
* 1964 – January 1970 Toyota Corona RT40/RT46V/RT50/RT56
* February 1970 – January 1971 Toyota Corona RT80/90/86V
* 1968–1971 Toyota Mark II
* Toyota Bus RH15B
* 1965–1967 Toyota Stout RK43/RK47
* Toyota ToyoAce PK41
* Toyota Hilux RN10

===3R===
The 3R family was produced from 1959 through 1968.

When introduced it had a 7.7:1 compression ratio. In 1960 the 3R was uprated to 8:1 and the 3R-B version was offered from 1960 through 1968 with the old 7.7:1 compression ratio. The 3R-C was introduced to comply with California emissions laws. The 3R-LPG variant was produced for the last five years.

Applications:
* 1963–1968 Toyota Dyna
* 1964–1967 Toyota Stout, originally 
* 1969–? Toyota Hilux
* 1967–1969 Toyota Corona (US)
* 1959–1967 Toyota Crown
* 1960–1967 Toyopet Masterline

===4R===
The 4R family was produced from 1965 through 1968.

Bore and stroke was .

Applications:
* 1967 Toyota 1600S (Japan)

===5R===
The 5R family was produced from 1968 through 1986. An LPG version, the 5R-LPG, was produced from 1968 through 1983.

It is a 2-valve OHV engine. Cylinder bore and stroke are . Output was at 5200 rpm and at 3000 rpm. Trucks such as the Dyna received a version tuned for torque, with a maximum power of at 4600 rpm and torque of at 3000 rpm.

Applications:
*Toyota Crown: third through sixth generation (RS50, RS60/66, RS80/RS100, and RS110). Only with LPG for taxi use in the last two generations.
*1969-1977 Toyota Coaster RU18/RU19
*Toyota Dyna RU10/RU20/RU30
*Toyota Stout RK101
*Toyota ToyoAce RY20
*Aug 1981–? Toyota Corona sixth generation (RT131), only LPG combined with automatic transmission.

===6R===
The 6R was produced from 1969 through 1974. Output is at 5,300 rpm. The 6R-B was produced those same years, while the natural gas powered 6R-LPG was produced from 1970 through 1973.

;Applications:
* Sep 1970 – Jul 1973 Toyota Corona RT84/94
* Jan 1972 – Aug 1973 Toyota Mark II RX16V – 

===7R===
The 7R was produced from 1968 through 1971 with a twin throat down-draft carburettor.
The 7R-B was produced from 1968 through 1969 with dual SU carburetors and higher compression.
The 7R-LPG was produced from 1969 through 1970.

The 7R was similar in displacement and technology to the 4R except the wider bore and shorter stroke of the 7R gave different power characteristics.

Applications:
* 1968–1970 Toyota Corona (RT41 sedan, RT53 hardtop, RT54 hardtop)
* 1970 Toyota Corona (RT82 sedan)
* 1968–1970 Toyota Corona Mark II (RT6x)
* 1968–1971 Toyota Corona Mark II Wagon (RT76D)

===8R===
The 8R The engine was produced from 1968 through 1973.
Cylinder bore and stroke was with a five bearing crank.
It was also available as the 8R-D, dual SU 8R-B, EFI 8R-E, Californian-spec 8R-C and DOHC 8R-G.

It was a major departure for the R family. With a 2-valve SOHC head, it impressed contemporary reviewers – &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; praised its quietness and free-revving nature.

The 8R engine has a closed chamber head vs the open chamber of the 18R-C. The 8R-B has dual side draft SU-type Aisan carburettors with the float bowl under the body and vacuum activated power valves with strangle plates for chokes and liquid cooled intake with a balance tube.

Toyota upped the ante again with the DOHC (but still 2-valve) 8R-G, produced from 1969 through 1972. From 1969 to Feb 1971 it was known as the 10R, but along with a removal of the tensioner gear in the interest of quieter operation, it was renamed the 8R-G to reflect the decision that twin-cam engines were henceforth to be identified by a &quot;-G&quot; suffix. 4,931 twin cam engines were built, all installed in the Toyota Corona Mark II (RT72) 1900 GSS. The 10R/8R-G weighed in at and as such was both lighter and more compact than its less powerful predecessor the 9R

Applications:
* 1970–1971 Toyota Hilux, 
* 1971–1973 Toyota Corona 1900 hardtop
* Toyota Corona Mark II RT72 Corona Mark II 1900 hardtop
* Toyota Corona Mark II RT72 Corona Mark II 1900 hardtop GSS (8R-G)

===9R===
The 9R was produced from 1967 through 1968. Bore and stroke .

It was essentially a 4R with a DOHC head designed by Yamaha. The cam lobes activated the valves directly via a bucket over shim arrangement. This same arrangement was used on the 2M, 8R-G, 10R, 18R-G, 2T-G, 4A-GE and 3T-GTE engines (all designed by Yamaha).

Output was at 6,200 rpm and at 5,000 rpm. It was a 2-valve DOHC design with two Solex carburettors and weighed . A total of 2,229 9R engines were built.

Applications:
* Toyota Corona (RT55) 1600 GT hardtop

===10R===
The twin cam 10R was produced from 1967 through Feb 1971, when it was renamed the 8R-G. The later 8R-G version did not receive a timing chain tensioner in an effort to make it more silent.

Output was at 6,400 rpm and at 5,200 rpm.

Applications:
* Toyota Corona Mark II RT75 Corona Mark II GSS

===12R===
The 12R was produced from 1969 through 1988. It was also built in the Philippines as the 12R-M, by Toyota&#x27;s local affiliate Delta Motors Corporation.
Technical Specs (Finnish Owner&#x27;s Manual from 1973 Corona Mark 1)
– Four cylinder, 4-stroke, OHV

** 1974–1981 Toyota Celica &quot;2000&quot;
** 1980–1981 Toyota Corona Liftback (RT132, Australia)



==== 18R-G ====
The 2-valve DOHC 18R-G and its variations were produced from 1973 to 1982, replacing the 8R-G and providing a performance engine which took advantage of the entire 2-litre limit of Japan&#x27;s &quot;small car&quot; class. While most 18R-Gs had a head designed and made by Yamaha, a very few had Toyota heads. Yamaha&#x27;s tuning-fork logo can be seen on the Yamaha heads. Except for the head and related timing components, most parts were shared or interchangeable with the SOHC 18R. Combustion chambers were hemispheric.

In 1975, air injection was added to the Japan-market 18R-GR for improved emissions. This used Solex carburettors. A fuel injected and catalyzed Japan-market version, the 18R-GEU, was produced from 1978 through 1982. There was also a catalyzed carburetted version, the 18R-GU.

Competition versions of the 18R-G and -GE include those used in rally Celicas of the period, one of which finished second in the 1977 RAC Rally. These had 4-valve heads and were called 152E, they were of bore and stroke and (depending on the source). The Group 4 rally version of the 152E had two twin-choke carburettors, and developed at 9000 rpm. Higher tuned engines developed as much as at 9,200 rpm. German racing team Schnitzer also developed a turbocharged silhouette racing version of the Celica, to take on the Porsche 935. With a KKK turbocharger, the Group 5 Celica developed but reliability was less than satisfactory.

Applications:
* 1973–1981 Toyota Celica GT 2000
* 1982–1983 Toyota Celica GT 2000 (RA63)
* 1974–1983 Toyota Carina GT 2000
* 1978–1983 Toyota Celica Camry GT 2000
* 1973–1982 Toyota Corona GT 2000

===19R===
The 2-valve SOHC 19R was produced from 1974 through 1977. Cylinder bore and stroke was . Its dimensions are the same as of the 18R, but it featured TTC-V, Toyota&#x27;s licensed version of Honda&#x27;s CVCC stratified charge combustion system. Output is . The 19R was a short-lived experiment by Toyota, and was only offered in Japanese market cars.

Applications:
* 1974–1977 Carina RA13/RA31
* 1974–1977 Corona RT103/RT123

===20R===
The 2-valve SOHC 20R was produced from 1975 through 1980. Cylinder bore and stroke was . Aluminum alloy heads were used.

Initial output was at 4800 rpm ( in California) and at 2,800 rpm. Power was down slightly from 1978 through 1979 at at 4800 rpm and at 2400 rpm. The final version, from 1979 through 1980, was down again at at 4800 rpm (still at in Canada) and at 2400 rpm.

The 20R and subsequent models featured important design changes relative to the earlier SOHC R-series engines. The head was changed from a reverse-flow to a cross-flow type with hemispherical combustion chambers and shorter valve rockers. The timing chain was strengthened. The lower block bearings were strengthened against wear, safeguarding oil pressure, and the stroke was lengthened. The changes increased torque substantially and shifted peak power and torque towards the lower speed range. The later R series engines did much to establish Toyota&#x27;s reputation for reliability, which had previously been indifferent at best.

Applications:
* 1975–1980 Toyota Hilux
* 1975–1980 Toyota Celica (U.S. Version)
* 1975–1980 Toyota Corona (U.S. Version)
* Toyota Stout (RK110/111)
* Toyota Coaster (RB11)
===21R===
The 2-valve SOHC 21R was produced from 1978 through 1987. Cylinder bore and stroke are .

Output for export markets, largely unconstrained by emissions, was DIN at 5,000 rpm and at 4,000 rpm. Air injection and federally compliant emissions equipment for the 21R-C (1982–1985) dropped power down to SAE net at 5,000 rpm. The air-injected Japanese version, the 21R-U, produces JIS at 5,200 rpm and at 3,600 rpm but dropped to at 5,400 rpm and at 4,000 rpm in 1986.

Applications:
* 1978–1982 Toyota Carina RA46-A, RA56-A
* 1978–1981 Toyota Celica RA46-B
* 1981–1983 Toyota Celica RA60-B

* 1980–1983 Toyota Cressida/Corona Mark II RX60
* 1979–198? Toyota HiAce Wagon RH23G

===22R===
The 2-valve SOHC 22R was produced from 1981 through 1997.

Cylinder bore and stroke was .

Initial output was at 4,800 rpm and at 2,800 rpm. By 1990 the 22R was producing at 5,000 rpm and at 3,400 rpm.

The first fuel injected 22R-E engines appeared in August 1982. Output of these engines is commonly rated at at 4,800 rpm and at 2,800 rpm.

In 1985, the engine was significantly reworked, output was up to at 4,800 rpm and at 3,600 rpm. Many parts from the newer 22R/R-E are not compatible with those from the older pre-1985 engine. Non-compatible parts include the cylinder head, block, pistons and many of the associated parts such as the timing chain and cover, and water and oil pumps (although the oil pump internals are the same).
These changes also affected the 22R, therefore one can consider the 85–95 22R-E as a fuel injected version of the 85–90 22R with only minor differences, if any.

Toyota swapped the dual-row timing chain used in older engines for a single-row chain with plastic guides in 1983. The new system reduced drag on the engine but introduced a new maintenance problem. After about of operation, the chain may stretch to the point that the hydraulic-operated chain tensioner cannot take up any more slack. The timing chain then impacts the plastic driver&#x27;s side chain guide, breaking it within a short period of time and creating a noticeable chattering sound in the front of the engine, especially when cold. If the engine continues to be operated without the guide restraint, the chain will vibrate excessively on the driver&#x27;s side and stretch rapidly. The result is any of several failure modes.

First, the loose chain will reduce ignition timing accuracy, which usually results in noticeably rough running. Second, it may jump a tooth on the drive sprocket or break entirely, which almost always results in major damage to an interference engine. Third, the stretched chain can slap against the side of the timing cover and wear through the metal into the coolant passage behind the water pump, resulting in major damage to both the oil and cooling systems (sometimes mis-diagnosed as a head gasket failure). The damaged aluminum timing cover is difficult to repair effectively and is typically replaced after such an event. Aftermarket timing-chain kits for the 22R/R-E typically include steel-backed guides that do not readily break even after the initial chain stretching has occurred, permitting the chain to run beyond the point without further incident. However, some Toyota mechanics will recommend the plastic guides as they will break when the timing chain is stretched; When the guides break a noticeable chatter is heard from the timing chain slapping on the cover, warning the operator of a worn timing chain.

The turbocharged 22R-TE (sold from late 1985 through 1988) produced at 4,800 rpm and at 2,800 rpm.

These engines are extremely well known for their durability, decent fuel efficiency and good low to mid range torque.

However, its weakness is high-end power. The 22R has a large displacement and a strong block, but its comparatively long stroke and restrictive head limit its use in high revving applications. Thus, the Toyota 18R-G, 2T-G, 4A-GE and 3S-GE 4-cylinder engines are better suited for performance applications.

A popular modification to the early 22R is to use a 20R head. Contrary to popular lore, the 20R head does not have smaller combustion chambers. The misunderstanding originated when the 22R came out and an advantage was its higher compression ratio, so swapping a 20R block with a 22R, there was a compression increase. The 20R head has straight ports, so can flow better than the 22R head, improving high RPM power. The 20R head is a simple bolt-on modification for the pre-1985 block, but also requires the use of the 20R intake manifold, making it almost impossible (there&#x27;s a lot of matching necessary) to use with the 22R-E EFI system. For blocks 1985 and onwards, further modifications are required.

<text>Shakespeare Wallah is a 1965 Merchant Ivory Productions film. The story and screenplay are by Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, about a travelling family theatre troupe of English actors in India, who perform Shakespeare plays in towns across India, amidst a dwindling demand for their work and the rise of Hindi film industry. Madhur Jaffrey won the Silver Bear for Best Actress at the 15th Berlin International Film Festival for her performance. The music was composed by Satyajit Ray.

==Plot==
Loosely based on the real-life actor-manager Geoffrey Kendal&#x27;s family and his travelling &quot;Shakespeareana Company&quot;, which earned him the Indian sobriquet &quot;Shakespearewallah&quot;, the film follows the story of nomadic British actors as they perform Shakespeare plays in towns in post-colonial India. In this story, Tony Buckingham (Geoffrey Kendal) and his wife Carla (Laura Liddell) oversee the troupe. Their daughter, Lizzie Buckingham (Felicity Kendal), falls in love with Sanju (Shashi Kapoor), who is also romancing Manjula (Madhur Jaffrey), a Bollywood film star.

In real life, Kapoor fell in love with and married Geoffrey Kendal&#x27;s elder daughter Jennifer Kendal. Their marriage was an important contribution to the Indian film industry until Kendal&#x27;s death in 1984.

<doc id="1334153" wikidata="Q7897305" url="?curid=1334153" title="Unplugged at the Walls">
<text>Unplugged at The Walls is an album by British rock band Marillion released in 1999. It was recorded in a small restaurant in Oswestry, near where they were mixing &quot;Radiation&quot;, on 25 and 26 June 1998 as a strictly acoustic set. Lead vocalist Steve Hogarth is reported to claim &quot;We offered to play a gig in there for a free meal and some beers.&quot;

As soon as the fans found out they were going to perform in the restaurant, everyone wanted to come and see them. They eventually had to sell some tickets, and those were sold out in less than a day or so. Fans from all around the world found their way to the small town of Oswestry to hear the band perform, and the response was so great that the band also figured they had to tape the show. The band rewrote much of their performed material for the gig and debuted two songs from &quot;Radiation&quot;. They also performed their version of &quot;Abraham, Martin And John&quot; which appeared later on &quot;Marillion Christmas 1999&quot; fan-club only release in a studio version. Some of the arrangements would later be used again on live recordings such as &quot;A Piss-Up in a Brewery&quot; and &quot;Mirrors&quot;.

At first the band didn&#x27;t feel that the quality of the show warranted a CD of their own. Kelly had to re-record his piano parts for the album. On the night he used the restaurants piano, and the microphone was right next to Ian Mosleys drums and more noises of the room was spilling into the piano mikes.

&quot;Unplugged at The Walls&quot; was released on the band&#x27;s own label, Racket Records. In 2018, earMUSIC reissued the album to retail as a limited edition (part of the 10 Live Albums campaign).

The cover of Radiohead&#x27;s &quot;Fake Plastic Trees&quot; was also released on the &quot;These Chains&quot; CD single and the Japanese edition of &quot;Radiation&quot;, which also includes &quot;The Space...&quot; from this recording.

<doc id="1334155" wikidata="Q728169" url="?curid=1334155" title="Manolis Glezos">
<text>Manolis Glezos (; 9 September 1922 – 30 March 2020) was a Greek left-wing politician, journalist, author, and folk hero, best known for his participation in the World War II resistance.

In Greece, he is best remembered for taking down the Flag of Nazi Germany from the Acropolis during the Axis occupation of Greece, along with Lakis Santas. After the end of the Occupation, his left-wing political beliefs and activism led to him being sentenced to death thrice; his imprisonments and legal troubles were often the topic of international interest, until his permanent release in 1971.

Since the restoration of democracy in 1974, he had been active as a politician, becoming a Member of the Greek Parliament for various left-wing parties over the years. In 2014, at the age of 91, he became a Member of the European Parliament for a second time in his life, for Syriza, making him the oldest-ever member of the European Parliament. He was also the most voted-for candidate in Greece.

Glezos was an award-winning journalist, and worked as head-editor and editor for the left-wing newspapers &quot;Rizospastis&quot; and &quot;I Avgi&quot;, which are popular to this day; he also published six books.

== Early life and World War II ==
Born in the village of Apiranthos, Naxos, Glezos moved to Athens in 1935 together with his family, where he finished high school. During his high school years in Athens, he also worked as a pharmacy employee. He was admitted to the Higher School of Economic and Commercial Studies (known today as the Athens University of Economics and Business) in 1940. In 1939, still a high school student, Glezos participated in the creation of an anti-fascist youth group against the Italian occupation of the Dodecanese and the dictatorship of Ioannis Metaxas. At the onset of World War II, he volunteered to join the Greek army in the Albanian front against Italy but was rejected because he was underage. Instead, he worked as a volunteer for the Hellenic Ministry of Economics. During the Axis occupation of Greece, he worked for the Hellenic Red Cross and the municipality of Athens, while actively involved in the resistance.

According to popular tradition, on 27 April 1941 Konstantinos Koukidis was ordered to lower the Greek flag, and raise the Nazi swastika flag. Koukidis allegedly lowered the flag and jumped from the Acropolis holding it, rather than raise the Nazi flag.

On 30 May 1941 Glezos and Apostolos Santas climbed on the Acropolis and tore down the swastika, which had been there since 27 April 1941, when the Nazi forces had entered Athens. It inspired not only the Greeks, but all subjected people, to resist the occupation, and established them both as two international anti-Nazi heroes.

Hours later, the Nazi regime sentenced the perpetrators to death, but they were not identified until much later. Glezos was arrested by the German occupation forces on 24 March 1942, imprisoned, and tortured. As a result of his treatment, he was affected by tuberculosis.

Glezos was arrested again on 21 April 1943 by the Italian occupation forces and spent three months in jail. In 1944, he was imprisoned by Greek collaborators and beaten for trying to escape.

== Career and political activism ==
=== Post-war period ===

The end of World War II was not the end of Glezos&#x27; plight. On 3 March 1948, in the midst of the Greek Civil War, he was put to trial for his political convictions and sentenced to death multiple times by the national government. His death penalties were reduced to a life sentence in 1950. Even though he was still imprisoned, Manolis Glezos was elected member of the Hellenic Parliament in 1951, under the flag of the United Democratic Left, also known as EDA (). Upon his election, he went on a hunger strike demanding the release of his fellow EDA MPs that were imprisoned or exiled in the Greek islands. He ended his hunger strike upon the release of 7 MPs from their exile. He was released from prison on 16 July 1954.

On 5 December 1958, he was arrested again and convicted of espionage, which was the common pretext for the persecution of the supporters of the left during the Cold War. The Soviet Union reacted circulating a postage stamp with Glezos, while the Greek government responded with a postage stamp depicting Imre Nagy. His release on 15 December 1962 was a result of the public outcry in Greece and abroad, including winning the Lenin Peace Prize. During his second term of post-war political imprisonment, Glezos was reelected MP with EDA in 1961. At the &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; of 21 April 1967, Glezos was arrested at 2 am, together with the rest of the political leaders. During the &quot;Regime of the Colonels&quot;, the military dictatorship led by George Papadopoulos, he was imprisoned and exiled until his release in 1971.

Manolis Glezos&#x27; sentences, from the Second World War to the Greek Civil War and the &quot;Regime of the Colonels&quot; total 11 years and 4 months of imprisonment, and 4 years and 6 months of exile.

=== Since 1974 ===
After the restoration of democracy in Greece in 1974, Glezos participated in the reviving of EDA. In the elections of October 1981 and June 1985, he was elected Member of the Greek Parliament, on a Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) ticket. In 1984 he was elected Member of the European Parliament, again on a PASOK ticket. He was the President of EDA from 1985 until 1989. In the meantime, in 1986, he withdrew from the Parliament, in order to try to implement a grassroots democracy experiment. He did so in the community of Aperathu, where he was elected as the President of the Community Council in 1986 elections. He then essentially abolished the privileges of the council, introducing a &quot;constitution&quot; and establishing a local assembly that had total control over the community administration. This model worked for several years, but in the long term the interest of the rest of his community wore off and the assembly was abandoned. Glezos remained the President until 1989.

In the 2000 Greek legislative election he led the list of Synaspismos (in English &quot;Coalition&quot;) party of the radical left. In 2002, he formed the political group Active Citizens (which is part of Coalition of the Radical Left, an alliance with Synaspismos and other minor parties of the Greek left) and he ran as a candidate prefect for Attica.

In March 2010, Glezos was participating in a protest demonstration in Athens, when he was hit in the face by a police tear gas canister. He was carried away injured.

In February 2012, Glezos was arrested by riot police while protesting in Athens. He was sprayed with tear gas by one of the police officers in that area.

In the June 2012 parliamentary election, Glezos was elected as MP of the Coalition of Radical Left (SYRIZA) party.

Glezos was a SYRIZA candidate for the European Parliament in the elections of 25 May 2014. He was elected to the European Parliament with over 430,000 votes, more than any other candidate in Greece. At age 91, he was also the oldest person elected to the European Parliament in the 2014 election.

In 2015, Glezos took a firm stance in favour of the &quot;No&quot; vote in the Greek bailout referendum. As an MEP he also participated in a support protest in Brussels, along with thousands of Belgians in favour of Greeks voting negatively in the referendum, a few days before the latter takes place. 
He resigned from his position in the European Parliament in July 2015, being succeeded by Nikolaos Chountis. The same year, he left SYRIZA before the September 2015 Greek election, where he was an MP candidate with the newly formed Popular Unity party.

In 2018, Manolis Glezos publicly voiced his opposition to the Prespa Agreement between Athens and Skopje on the resolution of the Macedonia naming dispute -despite the agreement being promoted by the SYRIZA government party which he formerly supported. In an article for the Greek daily paper &quot;Kathimerini&quot;, he insisted that the people of the neighbouring country should &quot;define themselves in accordance with their history, language, traditions... taking out of their mind the word Macedonia&quot;.

== Non-political career ==
Apart from his political work, Glezos invented a system to prevent floods, combat erosion and preserve underground water, that works by the constructions of a series of very small dams that redirect water to aquifers. For his contributions to democracy, to geological sciences, and to linguistics he was pronounced honorary Doctor of Philosophy of the University of Patras (Department of Geology) in 1996, of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (Department of Civil Engineering) in 2001, of the National Technical University of Athens (School of Mining &amp; Metallurgical Engineering) in 2003, and of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens (School of Philosophy) in 2008.

==Death==

On 30 March 2020, Glezos died of heart failure, at the age of 97. Alexis Tsipras, former Greek prime-minister, said, &quot;He will remain for all eternity the symbol of a fighter who knew how to sacrifice himself for the people.&quot; The Russian president Vladimir Putin sent a condolence message to the Greek government, which included, inter alia, the following words: &quot;To his Excellency, PM Kyriakos Mitsotakis. May you accept [my] deep condolences for the loss of Manolis Glezos, a brilliant political and social figure of Greece and a hero of the Greek Resistance at World War II. Manolis Glezos was a true friend of our country [...] He [also] greatly contributed, in person, in the struggle against the distortion of history. [...] With honour, Vladimir Putin. Moscow Kremlin, April 1st, 2020&quot;. 

===Funeral===
His funeral was held in the First Cemetery of Athens, in public expense on April 1, with only his family present, due to the restrictions for the COVID-19 pandemic.

== Publications ==
Glezos wrote articles in Greek newspapers since 1942 and was the editor of the newspapers &quot;Rizospastis&quot; and &quot;I Avgi&quot; in the 1950s. He was awarded the International Award of Journalism in 1958, the Golden Medal Joliot-Curie of the World Peace Council in 1959, and the Lenin Peace Prize in 1963. He published six books in Greek:
* &quot;The History of the Book&quot; (&quot;Η ιστορία του βιβλίου&quot;, 1974)
* &quot;From Dictatorship to Democracy&quot; (&quot;Από τη Δικτατορία στη ∆ημοκρατία&quot;, 1974)
* &quot;The Phenomenon of Alienation in the Language&quot; (&quot;Το φαινόμενο της αλλοτρίωσης στη γλώσσα&quot;, 1977)
* &quot;The Conscience of the Rocky Earth&quot;, (&quot;Η συνείδηση της πετραίας γης&quot;, 1997)
* &quot;Hydor, Aura, Nero&quot;, (&quot;Ύδωρ, Αύρα, Νερό&quot;, 2001)
* &quot;National Resistance 1940-1945&quot;, (&quot;Εθνική Αντίσταση 1940-1945&quot;, 2006)

<text>A thangka (; Tibetan: ཐང་ཀ་; Nepal Bhasa: पौभा) is a Tibetan Buddhist painting on cotton, silk appliqué, usually depicting a Buddhist deity, scene, or mandala. Thangkas are traditionally kept unframed and rolled up when not on display, mounted on a textile backing somewhat in the style of Chinese scroll paintings, with a further silk cover on the front. So treated, thangkas can last a long time, but because of their delicate nature, they have to be kept in dry places where moisture will not affect the quality of the silk. Most thangkas are relatively small, comparable in size to a Western half-length portrait, but some are extremely large, several metres in each dimension; these were designed to be displayed, typically for very brief periods on a monastery wall, as part of religious festivals. Most thangkas were intended for personal meditation or instruction of monastic students. They often have elaborate compositions including many very small figures. A central deity is often surrounded by other identified figures in a symmetrical composition. Narrative scenes are less common, but do appear.

Thangka serve as important teaching tools depicting the life of the Buddha, various influential lamas and other deities and bodhisattvas. One subject is the Wheel of Life (&quot;Bhavachakra&quot;), which is a visual representation of the Abhidharma teachings (Art of Enlightenment). The term may sometimes be used of works in other media than painting, including reliefs in metal and woodblock prints. Today, printed reproductions at poster size of painted thangka are commonly used for devotional as well as decorative purposes. Many thangkas were produced in sets, though they have often subsequently become separated.

==History==
Tibetan Buddhist painting developed from widespread traditions of early Buddhist paintings which now only survive in a few sites such as the Ajanta Caves in India and the Mogao Caves in China, which have very extensive wall-paintings and were the repository for what are now the earliest surviving Tibetan paintings on cloth. The thanka form developed alongside the tradition of Tibetan Buddhist wall paintings, which are or were mostly in monasteries.

The early history of the form is more easily traced through these murals, which survive in greater numbers than the portable paintings which certainly once existed. The art form originating from the Newari art of Phauba from Nepal, from the early years artists were commissioned from Nepal, furthermore, ancient texts have been found wherein instructions were provided as to the proportions, postures and geometrical measurements of these deities to the monasteries from Nepal. Most thanka were commissioned by individuals, who were believed to acquire merit by doing so. They might then be given to a monastery or another individual, or retained for use by the commissioner. Some thangka have inscriptions on their back recording that they were the personal meditation image (&quot;thugs dam&quot;) of a notable monk. Most artists were probably monks, although lay artists seem to have also existed, as they did for metalwork sculpture. The commissioner would provide the materials, which were often valuable, and by tradition the compensation to the artist was regarded as a &quot;gift&quot; rather than a fee. The word &quot;thangka&quot; means &quot;thing that one unrolls&quot; in Classical Tibetan. Thangka are very rarely signed, but some artists are known, more because they were important monastic leaders than famous as artists. Painting was a valued accomplishment in a monk.

The earliest surviving Tibetan paintings on cloth are from the Mogao Caves at Dunhuang on the Silk Road in Gansu province, China. The &quot;Library Cave&quot; there was a repository of old or worn out manuscripts, paintings, prints, textiles and other items which was sealed off in the 11th century, after several centuries of deposits. Many of the paintings have Tibetan inscriptions or are in a style that can be recognized as Tibetan, as opposed to the dominant Han Chinese style and some pieces reflecting Indian styles. Though they are hard to date, it is thought that these pieces mainly come from a period c. 781–848 during Tang dynasty rule.

Surviving tangkas on cloth certainly from Tibet itself start in the 11th century, after the revival of Buddhism; there are some 20 surviving from the 11th and 12th century. Such early examples typically have compositions that are already complex, but less so than in later examples. Later the typical compositions show a central figure flanked by smaller figures, often in framed compartments, or surrounded by flaming halos or seated on small clouds. Behind these figures a landscape background including much sky is often indicated, though little of it may be visible. The central figure may be a deity, arhat, or important monk, and the same groups make up the background figures. Several of the figures may be different &quot;aspects&quot; or reincarnations of each other according to Buddhist theology. In the example at left the flanking bodhisattvas are in a style, one of several found in such figures in this period, that appears derived from central Indian art.

Over the following centuries Tibetan painting, both on walls and thangka, continued to develop in its distinctive style, balancing between the two major influences of Indo-Nepalese and Han Chinese painting, despite Buddhism being on the general decline in these regions. Styles could vary considerably between the different regions of Tibet, as well as the wider region where tangkas were painted. Within Tibet the regions nearer Nepal and the rest of China were often more influenced by regional styles. Bhutanese tangkas were mainly influenced by Central Tibet. The different monastic orders also developed somewhat different stylistic characters.

Tibetan painting incorporated many elements from Han Chinese painting, especially from the 14th century onwards, reaching a peak in the 18th century. One aspect of this was allowing more space and emphasis to the landscape background. In general the style of figures in thangkas remains derived from the Indo-Nepalese tradition. According to Giuseppe Tucci, by the time of the Qing dynasty, &quot;a new Tibetan art was then developed, which in a certain sense was a provincial echo of the Chinese 18th century&#x27;s smooth ornate preciosity.&quot; Since the Yuan dynasty, Tibet was administered as part of China, but when the Qing dynasty came to power court interest in Tibetan Buddhism increased, and many refined and elegant works were produced by Imperial artists and sent to Tibet, influencing local styles. As well as the court style, there was influence from the regions of China near Tibet.

Tangkas were painted in all the areas where Tibetan Buddhism flourished, which apart from those mentioned already included Mongolia, Ladakh, Sikkim, and parts of Himalayan India in Arunachal Pradesh, Dharamshala, and Lahaul and Spiti district in Himachal Pradesh. It is also practiced in parts of Russia (Kalmykia, Buryatia, and Tuva) and Northeast China.

Other traditions of Buddhist scroll paintings are not usually covered by the term thangka, although they may have many similarities, and descend from the same origins. An example is Japanese painting, where a number of very early examples survive from the Nara (710–794) and Heian periods (794 to 1185). Most of these are National Treasures of Japan. &quot;Raigō-zu&quot; developed as one popular genre, showing the Amida Buddha accompanied by bodhisattvas welcoming the souls of the faithful to his Western Paradise. These were, and still are, carried into the house of a person who was near death.

==Types==
Based on technique and material, tangkas can be grouped by types. Generally, they are divided into two broad categories: those that are painted (Tib.) bris-tan—and those made of silk, either by appliqué or embroidery.

Tangkas are further divided into these more specific categories:

* Painted in colours (Tib.) tson-tang—the most common type
* Appliqué (Tib.) go-tang
* Black Background—meaning gold line on a black background (Tib.) nagtang
* Blockprints—paper or cloth outlined renderings, by woodcut/woodblock printing
* Embroidery (Tib.) tsem-thang
* Gold Background—an auspicious treatment, used judiciously for peaceful, long-life deities and fully enlightened buddhas
* Red Background—literally gold line, but referring to gold line on a vermillion (Tib.) mar-tang

Whereas typical tangkas are fairly small, with painted area between about 20 to 50 centimetres high, there are also giant festival tangkas, usually appliqué, and designed to be unrolled against a wall in a monastery for particular religious occasions. These are likely to be wider than they are tall, and may be sixty or more feet across and perhaps twenty or more high. In Bhutan at least these are called thongdrels. There are also larger than average thankas that were designed for altars or display in temples.

Somewhat related are Tibetan tsakli, cards which look like miniature tangkas perhaps up to 15 centimetres high, and often square, usually containing a single figure. These were mostly produced in sets and were usually used in earlier stages of training monks, or as initiation cards or offerings, or to use when constructing temporary mandalas. Another related form is the painted wooden top cover for a manuscript book, giving a long narrow strip, typically some 6 cm by 55 cm, often painted with a row of seated figures in compartments. The techniques for both these forms are essentially the same as for thangka, and presumably the same artists worked on them. Because tangkas can be quite expensive, people nowadays use posters of tangkas as an alternative to the real tangkas for religious purposes.

Sources on Asian art often describe all-textile tangkas as &quot;tapestry&quot;, but tangkas that meet the normal definition of tapestry with the image created only by weaving a single piece of fabric with different colours of thread are extremely rare, though a few tapestry examples in the Chinese &quot;kesi&quot; technique are known, mostly from the medieval period. There is a large example in the Hermitage Museum, although in this and other pieces the different colours are woven separately and then sewn together in a type of patchwork. Most thangka described as tapestry are some combination of embroidery, appliqué and other techniques.

==Process==

Thangkas are painted on cotton or silk. The most common is a loosely woven cotton produced in widths from . While some variations do exist, tangkas wider than 45 cm (17 or 18 inches) frequently have seams in the support. The paint consists of pigments in a water-soluble medium of animal glue. Both mineral and organic pigments are used. In Western terminology, this is a distemper technique; although it is often described as a form of gouache, this is incorrect, and the paint was applied as a warm liquid, mixed shortly before application.
In Nepal, 24 carat gold is also plated over some parts of thangka paintings which makes the art a little more expensive.

The Role of Natural Pigments: Thangka paintings traditionally utilize natural pigments sourced from minerals, plants, and even precious stones. These pigments not only lend vibrant colors but also hold symbolic significance. For example, gold symbolizes enlightenment, lapis lazuli represents the sky, and cinnabar signifies vitality. Understanding the symbolism behind these pigments adds depth to the appreciation of Thangka art.
Sacred Geometry and Proportions: Thangka paintings are not merely artistic expressions but also embody spiritual principles and sacred geometry. The precise measurements and proportions used in creating Thangkas are based on ancient mathematical and philosophical concepts, such as the golden ratio and mandala symbolism. This aspect reflects the harmony between art and spirituality in Tibetan culture.
The Ritual of Thangka Creation: Creating a Thangka is not just a creative process but also a spiritual practice. Artists often undergo rigorous training and follow specific rituals before, during, and after painting a Thangka. These rituals involve purification ceremonies, chanting mantras, and invoking blessings from spiritual masters. This imbues each Thangka with a sacred energy that resonates with those who view or meditate upon it.
The Living Tradition of Thangka Painting: While Thangka paintings have a rich history dating back centuries, the tradition is very much alive today. Contemporary Thangka artists are not only preserving ancient techniques but also innovating with new styles and interpretations. Some artists blend traditional Tibetan motifs with modern artistic influences, creating unique expressions that appeal to a global audience.
Empowering Communities Through Thangka Art: Beyond their aesthetic and spiritual value, Thangka paintings play a significant role in empowering communities in the Himalayan region. Many Thangka painting schools and cooperatives provide training and employment opportunities for local artists, particularly in rural areas. By supporting Thangka art, buyers contribute to the preservation of Tibetan culture and the livelihoods of Himalayan communities.

Most old thangka have inscriptions on the back, usually the mantra of the deity depicted, but sometimes also information as to later owners, though rarely information about the original commissioner or artist. Sometimes x-rays allow pious inscriptions placed under the paint on the front of the image to be seen. Inscriptions may be made in the shape of a stupa, or sometimes other shapes.

The composition of a thangka, as with the majority of Buddhist art, is highly geometric. Arms, legs, eyes, nostrils, ears, and various ritual implements are all laid out on a systematic grid of angles and intersecting lines. A skilled thangka artist will generally select from a variety of predesigned items to include in the composition, ranging from alms bowls and animals, to the shape, size, and angle of a figure&#x27;s eyes, nose, and lips. The process seems very methodical, but often requires deep understanding of the symbolism involved to capture the spirit of it.

Thangka often overflow with symbolism and allusion. Because the art is explicitly religious, all symbols and allusions must be in accordance with strict guidelines laid out in Buddhist scripture. The artist must be properly trained and have sufficient religious understanding, knowledge, and background to create an accurate and appropriate thangka:

==Nepal==
The earliest surviving thangka paintings from Nepal date to about the 14th century AD, but this is probably well after Buddhists and Hindus began to make illustrations of the deities and natural scenes. Historically, Tibetan and Chinese influence in Nepalese paintings is quite evident in Paubhas (Tangkas), and Nepalese styles have been a significant influence on Tibetan art. Paubhas are of two types, the Palas which are illustrative paintings of the deities and the Mandala, which are mystic diagrams paintings of complex test prescribed patterns of circles and square each having specific significance. It was through Nepal that Mahayana Buddhism was introduced into Tibet during reign of Angshuvarma in the seventh century AD. There was therefore a great demand for religious icons and Buddhist manuscripts for newly built monasteries throughout Tibet. A number of Buddhist manuscripts, including Prajnaparamita, were copied in Kathmandu Valley for these monasteries. Astasahas rika Prajnaparamita for example, was copied in Patan in the year 999 AD., during the reign of Narendra Dev and Udaya Deva, for the Sa-Shakya monastery in Tibet. For the Nor monastery in Tibet, two copies were made in Nepal, one of Astasahasrika Prajnaparamita in 1069 AD and the other of Kavyadarsha in 1111 AD. The influence of Nepalese art extended to China in regular order in the thirteenth century. Nepalese artisans were dispatched to the courts of Chinese emperors at their request to perform their workmanship and impart expert knowledge, with the Nepalese innovator and architect Balbahu, known by his popular name Araniko becoming the chief Imperial artist of Kubilai Khan.

After the introduction of paper, palm leaf became less popular, however, it continued to be used until the eighteenth century. Paper manuscripts imitated the oblong shape but were wider than the palm leaves. From the fifteenth century onwards, brighter colours gradually began to appear in Nepalese thangka. Because of the growing importance of the tantric cult, various aspects of Shiva and Shakti were painted in conventional poses. Mahakala, Manjushri, Lokeshvara and other deities were equally popular and so were also frequently represented in thangka paintings of later dates. As Tantrism embodies the ideas of esoteric power, magic forces, and a great variety of symbols, strong emphasis is laid on the female element and sexuality in the paintings of that period.

Religious paintings worshipped as icons are known as Paubha in Newari and thangka in Tibetan. The origin of Paubha or thangka paintings may be attributed to the Nepalese artists responsible for creating a number of special metal works and wall- paintings as well as illuminated manuscripts in Tibet. Realizing the great demand for religious icons in Tibet, these artists, along with monks and traders, took with them from Nepal not only metal sculptures but also a number of Buddhist manuscripts. One of the earliest specimens of Nepalese Thangka painting dates from the thirteenth /fourteenth century and shows Amitabha surrounded by bodhisattva. Another Nepalese thangka with three dates in the inscription (the last one corresponding to 1369 A.D.), is one of the earliest known thangka with inscriptions. The &quot;Mandala of Vishnu &quot; dated 1420 A.D., is another fine example of the painting of this period. Early Nepalese Tangkas are simple in design and composition. The main deity, a large figure, occupies the central position while surrounded by smaller figures of lesser divinities.

During the reign of Tibetan Dharma King Trisong Duetsen the Tibetan masters refined their already well-developed arts through research and studies of different country&#x27;s tradition. Thanka painting&#x27;s lining and measurement, costumes, implementations and ornaments are mostly based on Indian styles. The drawing of figures is based on Nepalese style and the background sceneries are based on Chinese style. Thus, the thangka paintings became a unique and distinctive art. Although the practice of thanka painting was originally done as a way of gaining merit it has nowadays evolved into a commercial business and the noble intentions it once carried has been diluted. Tibetans do not sell Tangkas on a large scale as the selling of religious artifacts such as tangkas and idols is frowned upon in the Tibetan community and thus non Tibetan groups have been able to monopolize on its (thangka&#x27;s) popularity among Buddhist and art enthusiasts from the west.

Thangka have developed in the northern Himalayan regions among the Lamas. Besides Lamas, Gurung and Tamang communities are also producing Tankas, which provide substantial employment opportunities for many people in the hills. Newari Thankas or paubha have been produced in Kathmandu valley from the 13th century.

<text>Karadach or Kuridach (in Greek Κουριδαχος, &quot;Kouridachos&quot;, ) was an important chieftain of the Akatziri tribe of the Hunnic confederation during the reign of Attila. According to Priscus he rose to prominence when he was courted by Roman diplomats in 448 AD as a potential ally against the Huns, but used the information to help his overlord foil a revolt among lesser chiefs of the Akatziri; thus Attila left his lands untouched while the remaining were taken.

==Etymology==
Otto J. Maenchen-Helfen considers the name to be &quot;possibly&quot; Turkic. He suggests an etymology of &quot;*Kurtaq&quot;: &quot;kurt&quot; (wolf) plus the diminutive suffix &quot;-q&quot;.

<text>Joseph Hergenröther (15 September 1824 – 3 October 1890) was a German Church historian and canonist, and the first Cardinal-Prefect of the Vatican Archive.

==Biography==
Born in Würzburg, he was the second son of Johann Jacob Hergenröther, professor of medicine in the University of Würzburg. In 1842 Hergenröther completed with notable success his gymnasium course in his native town, and entered the University of Würzburg to take up a two-year course of philosophical studies, to which he added certain branches of theology. His historical tendencies exhibited themselves at this early age in a dramatic poem entitled &quot;Papst Gregor VII&quot; (Würzburg, 1841).

Bishop von Stahl took an interest in him, and in 1844 sent him to the Collegium Germanicum et Hungaricum at Rome, whither he had already sent Heinrich Joseph Dominicus Denzinger and Franz Hettinger. Among his scholarly teachers were Giovanni Perrone and Carlo Passaglia in doctrinal theology, Tomei in moral theology, Antonio Ballerini in church history, Francis Xavier Patrizi in Scriptural exegesis, and Marzio in canon law.

The political troubles of 1848 prevented the completion of his theological studies at Rome; he was ordained to the priesthood 28 March of that year, and returned to Würzburg, where he pursued his ecclesiastical preparation for another year. In 1849 he was appointed chaplain at Zellingen, and for some time devoted himself to the duties of his office. In 1849 he stood successfully for the degree of doctor of theology before the University of Munich, and offered as his dissertation a treatise on the Trinitarian teaching of St. Gregory Nazianzen (&quot;Die Lehre von der göttlichen Dreieinigkeit nach d. heil. Gregor von Nazianz&quot;, Ratisbon, 1850). The qualities of the young doctor induced the theological faculty of Munich to offer him a place as instructor (privatdozent) in theology, which he accepted. Following ancient usage, he justified the confidence of the university by a printed thesis (Habilitationschrift) on the later Protestant theories of the origins of the Catholic Church (&quot;De catholicæ ecclesiæ primordiis recentiorum Protestantium systemata expenduntur&quot;, Ratisbon, 1851). Henceforth he devoted himself without reserve to his professorial duties.

In 1852 he was called to Würzburg, as professor extraordinary of canon law and church history; after three years (1855) he was promoted to the full possession of that chair. To his other duties he added the teaching of patrology. In those years Würzburg rejoiced in the possession of such theologians as Hettinger, Denzinger, Hähnlein, and Hergenröther.

Hergenröther was often honoured by election to the office of dean of his faculty, and occasionally to the University Senate; the latter office he never held after 1871, because of his opposition to Ignaz von Döllinger. For a similar reason he was never chosen to be rector of the university. Until 1869 Hergenröther was occupied as teacher and writer, chiefly with early Christian and Byzantine ecclesiastical history. The discovery (1851) of the Greek Christian text known as the &quot;Philosophoúmena&quot; led him to examine its disputed authorship in a series of studies in the &quot;Tübinger Theol. Quartalschrift&quot; (1852) and in the supplementary volume (1856) to the first edition of the &quot;Kirchenlexikon&quot; of Heinrich Joseph Wetzer and Benedict Welte. He again defended the authorship of Hippolytus in the &quot;Œsterreichische Vierteljahrschrift f. kath. Theol.&quot; (1863).

Hergenröther was especially interested in the career of Photius and in the origins of the Greek Schism, and kept up continuous research in the principal libraries for manuscripts of the works of Photius, in order to exhibit the original materials in as perfect a text as could be established. This led to the publication (Ratisbon, 1857) of the work, &quot;Photii Constantinopolitani Liber de Spiritus Sancti mystagogia&quot;. He contributed essays on the same work and on the &quot;Amphilochia&quot; of Photius to the &quot;Tüb. Theol. Quartalschrift&quot; (1858).

In 1860 appeared at Paris the Migne edition of &quot;Photius&quot;. It offered many textual emendations that were owing to Hergenröther, particularly in the &quot;Amphilochia&quot;; it was against his will that his earlier edition of the &quot;Liber de Sp. Sancti mystagogia&quot; was reprinted by Migne. When Aloys Pichler&#x27;s work on the history of the separation of the Eastern and Western Churches appeared (Munich, 1864), Hergenröther was prepared to criticize it in the most thorough manner, which he did in a series of studies in a Würzburg theological periodical, the &quot;Chilianeum&quot; (1864–65), and in the &quot;Archiv. f. kath. Kirchenrecht&quot; (1864–65). The results of his twelve years of research in the history of the Greek Schism appeared finally in the classical work, &quot;Photius Patriarch von Constantinopel, sein Leben, seine Schriften, und das griechische Schisma&quot; (3 vols., Ratisbon, 1867–69). An additional volume bears the title: &quot;Monumenta Græca ad Photium ejusque historiam pertinentia&quot; (Ratisbon). In this monumental work it is difficult to say whether the palm belongs to the author&#x27;s extensive knowledge of all the manuscript material, to his profound erudition, or to his calm objective attitude. Karl Krumbacher, the historian of Byzantine literature, says that the work cannot be surpassed. In these volumes Hergenröther laid here in minute detail the origins of the Byzantine Church, its development since the fourth century, and after the death of Photius until the completion of the schism in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.

While professor of canon law at Würzburg, Hergenröther published several important historico-canonical essays on such subjects as early ecclesiastical reordinations (Ester, Vierteljahrsch. f. kath. Theol., 1862), the canonical relations of the various rites in the Catholic Church (Archiv f. kath. Kirchenrecht, 1862), the politico-ecclesiastical relations of Spain and the Holy See (ibid., 1863–66), and the canon law of the Greeks to the end of the ninth century (ibid., 1870). His interest in the ecclesiastical vicissitudes of his own day was manifested by valuable essays on the States of the Church after the French Revolution (Hist.-polit. Blätter, 1859), spirit of the age (&quot;Zeitgeist&quot;) and papal sovereignty (Der Katholik, 1861), and the Franco-Sardinian Treaty (Frankfort, 1865). Among his historico-apologetic essays are his treatises on the errors condemned by the Holy See in the Encyclical (Syllabus) of 8 December 1864 (in the Chilianeum, 1865), the veneration of the Blessed Virgin in the first ten centuries of the Christian Era (Münster, 1870).

He was a regular contributor of similar but briefer articles to the Würzburg periodicals, &quot;Die katholische Wochenschrift&quot; and the &quot;Chilianeum&quot;. Hergenröther was constantly engaged in attempting to develop a genuine Catholic sentiment and truly Christian life among the faithful. He preached frequently, and was always a welcome speaker at the general assemblies of the German Catholic associations (Vereine; 1863–77). For the Fulda meeting of the Prussian bishops (1870) he prepared an exhaustive historical study on the spoliation of the Papal States, in which he developed at length the arguments for the temporal power of the papacy.

At Munich he gained the reputation of being one of the most learned theologians on the Ultramontane side of the Infallibility question, which had begun to be discussed; and in 1868 he was sent to Rome to arrange the proceedings of the Vatican Council. Together with some other Catholics, Hergenröther deplored the attitude that certain Catholic theologians assumed from about 1860, in particular that of the celebrated historian Döllinger. The latter&#x27;s work &quot;Kirche und Kirchen, Papsttum und Kirchenstaat&quot; (1861) was criticized by Hergenröther in &quot;Der Katholik&quot;. At the Munich meeting of Catholic savants (1863), Hergenröther was one of the eight who sent in a written protest against the opening discourse of Döllinger on the past and present of Catholic theology. Among the other signers were Heinrich Moufang von Schäzler, Paul Leopold Haffner, Franz Hettinger, and Matthias Joseph Scheeben. Hergenröther was soon called on to answer the pamphlet of Dr. Friedrich Bernhard Ferdinand Michelis, &quot;Kirche oder Partei? Ein offenes u. freies Wort an den deutschen Episkopat&quot; (Church or Faction? A Frank Address to the German Episcopate), in which this writer attacked violently the &quot;Mainz&quot; and the &quot;Roman&quot; theologians. Hergenröther&#x27;s answer appeared in the &quot;Chilianeum&quot; (1865) under the title of &quot;Kirche u. nicht Partei. Eine Antwort auf die jüngste Broschüre des Herrn Dr. Fr. Michelis&quot; (Church and not Faction: an Answer to the latest Brochure of Dr. Michelis). In the same review (1863) Hergenröther had written a critical account of the latest efforts of Western Catholics for ecclesiastical reunion with the Oriental Churches.

The opening of the Vatican Council (1870) brought to a head the domestic conflict in Germany. Hergenröther was the foremost defender of the council and its decrees; as early as 1868 he had been appointed, with Hettinger, consultor for the preparation of the council&#x27;s work and had taken up his residence at Rome. His knowledge of ecclesiastical history, canon law, and Catholic dogma made him a valuable co-labourer in the many careful and detailed preliminary meetings of the council commission. In the meantime he prepared, with Hettinger, and published in the &quot;Chilianeum&quot; (1869) a memorial of the theological faculty of Würzburg in reply to five questions, submitted by the Bavarian Government, concerning the approaching council. He also published (Der Katholik, 1871) another outlined memorial concerning the Vatican Council, in reply to eleven questions submitted by the Bavarian Minister of Worship to the theological and law faculties of Würzburg. This memorial, though projected, was never formally called for by the Government.

The opposition to the Vatican Council reached its acme in the work &quot;Der Papst und das Concil&quot;, by &quot;Janus&quot; (Döllinger). In the same year (1869) Hergenröther prepared his &quot;Anti-Janus&quot;, an historico-theological critique (Freiburg, 1870). He also published a number of small brochures in favour of the council and against Döllinger, e. g. &quot;Die Irrthümer logischer Censor&quot; (Freiburg, 1870), and a critique of Dr. Döllinger&#x27;s declaration of 28 March 1871 (Freiburg, 1871). His pen was also active in the &quot;Historisch-politische Blätter&quot;, where he published (1870) a series of articles on the &quot;Allgemeine Zeitung&quot; and its letters from the council, on papal infallibility before the Vatican Council, and on ancient Gallicans and modern Appellants. In 1871 he published the solid study &quot;Das unfehlbare Lehrant des Papstes&quot; [The Infallible Magisterium (teaching office) of the pope, Passau, 1871]. These grave and exhausting labours were crowned and partially summarized by a new work, &quot;Katholische Kirche u. christlicher Staat in ihrer geschichtlichen Entwicklung u. in Beziehung auf die Gegenwart&quot; (The Catholic Church and the Christian State, in their historical development and their relations to the present), together with an &quot;Anti-Janus vindicatus&quot; (Freiburg, 1872, 2nd annotated ed., Freiburg, 1876). The former is a thesaurus of information concerning politico-ecclesiastical conflicts of the past, and is marked throughout by an uncompromising tone. It was translated into Italian (Pavia, 1877) and into English (London, 1876; Baltimore, 1889).

He published his &quot;Handbuch der allgemeinen Kirchengeschichte&quot; (Manual of General Church History) in the &quot;theological Library&quot; of Herder (Freiburg, 1876). A second annotated edition appeared in 1879; in 1880 a third volume was added, containing the notes and documentary evidence. This work was then and remains yet unsurpassed for abundance of information, accuracy of narrative, and manifold sources of historical proof. A third edition appeared (1884–86), in which the notes are no longer printed apart, but accompany the text. The writer of this article is the editor of a fourth edition (3 vols., Freiburg, 1902-1909). When it was proposed to bring out a new edition of the &quot;Kirchenlexikon&quot; of Wetzer and Welte, Hergenröther was naturally suggested as the savant most capable of executing this gigantic task. He accepted it, but was compelled to abandon it when scarcely begun; his elevation to the dignity of cardinal with the obligation of a Roman residence, left him no freedom for the enterprise. The first volume contains many articles from his pen, some of them quite lengthy. He was unable to do as much for the other volumes–in all there are eighty-seven articles signed by him. Other minor literary tasks consumed his spare hours in the last period of his life at Würzburg. The various subjects were Pius IX (Würzburg, 1876); Athanasius the Great (Cologne, 1876); Cardinal Maury in &quot;Katholische Studien&quot; (Würzburg, 1878); a short history of the popes (Würzburg, 1878); the vow of poverty among the Oriental monks in &quot;Archiv f. kath. Kirchenrecht&quot; (1877); the canonical significance of nomination (ibid., 1878). Hergenröther&#x27;s works in the departments of church history and canon law, and his firm attitude on the great ecclesiastical questions of the day, won for him the confidence of all the bishops and Catholic scholars of Germany.

In 1877 Pius IX had recognized his services to the Vatican Council and the ecclesiastical sciences by making him a domestic prelate. When Leo XIII determined to open the Vatican Archives to the scholars of the world, he found in him the savant to whom he might safely entrust the practical execution of this generous act. Hergenröther was made Cardinal-Deacon of San Nicolò in Carcere on 12 May 1879. At a later date he was transferred to Santa Maria in Via Lata. He was also appointed Cardinal-Prefect of the Apostolic Archives, a new office, which he was the first to fill, and in which he was charged with the establishment of research work in the Vatican Archives and the systematizing, on scientific lines, of scholarly work amid these rich treasures. That he executed the views of Leo XIII in a satisfactory and even generous manner, is acknowledged by the numerous historical workers who have laboured in the archives since 1879. Hergenröther was also a member of several Roman congregations (Index, Studies, and Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs), and protector of several religious institutes. He undertook, moreover, to edit the official correspondence (Regesta) of Leo X, a rather thankless task, and one of great difficulty, because of the exceedingly bad handwriting of that day. He was efficiently aided by his younger brother, Franz Hergenröther, who had accompanied him to Rome. Before his death the cardinal published eight parts or fasciculi of this extensive work, &quot;Leonis X Pont. Maximi Regesta&quot;, Vol. I (Freiburg, 1884–85). A small part of the second volume was brought out (Freiburg, 1891) by his brother and fellow-editor, since which time the publication has ceased by reason of the latter&#x27;s return to Würzburg as canon capitular of the cathedral.

Cardinal Hergenröther undertook another work of the most exacting nature, the continuation of Karl Joseph von Hefele&#x27;s &quot;History of the Councils&quot;, two volumes of which he published before his death (vol. VIII, Freiburg, 1887; vol. IX, 1890). The latter volume contains the preliminary history of the Council of Trent and is also a history of the Lutheran Reformation.
He suffered much in the last years of his life, as the result of an apoplectic attack which crippled him grievously though it did not affect the brightness and vigour of his intellect. He was able to keep up his literary labours to the day of his death. During the summer vacation of 1890 he took up his residence in the Cistercian Abbey of Mehrerau (on the Bodensee) the hospitality of which he had more than once enjoyed. In this secluded spot he met with another apoplectic stroke, and died. He was laid to rest in the church of the abbey. In 1897 a suitable monument was erected to his memory by his friends, and dedicated (25 March).

He was a stanch supporter of the infallibility dogma. In 1870 he wrote &quot;Anti-Janus&quot;, an answer to The Pope and the Council, by Janus (Ignaz von Döllinger and Johann Friedrich), which made a great sensation at the time. In 1877 he was made prelate of the papal household; he became cardinal deacon in 1879, and was afterwards made curator of the Vatican archives.

He died in Mehrerau Abbey near Bregenz in 1890.

His portrait was apparently painted by the Swiss-born American artist Adolfo Müller-Ury (1862-1947) during the two years he spent studying in Italy 1882-1884, and was probably signed Ad. Muller. Its present whereabouts is unknown.

==Works==

Of Hergenröther&#x27;s other works, the most important are:
*his history of the Papal States since the Revolution (&quot;Der Kirchenstaat seit der französischen Revolution&quot;, Freiburg i. B., 1860; Fr. trans., Leipzig, 1860)
*his great work on the relations of church and state (&quot;Katholische Kirche und christlicher Staat in ihrer geschichtlichen Entwickelung und in Beziehung auf Fragen der Gegenwart&quot;, 2 parts, Freiburg i. B., 1872; 2nd edition expanded, 1876; Eng. trans., London, 1876, Baltimore, 1889)
*his universal church history (&quot;Handbuch der allgemeinen Kirchengeschichte&quot;, 3 vols, Freiburg i. B., 1876-1880; 2nd edition, 1879, etc.; 3rd edition, 1884-1886; 4th edition, by Peter Kirsch, 1902, etc.; French trans., Paris, 1880, etc.)
He also found time for a while to edit the new edition of Wetzer and Welte&#x27;s &quot;Kirchenlexikon&quot; (1877), to superintend the publication of part of the &quot;Regesta&quot; of Pope Leo X (Freiburg i. B., 1884-1885), and to add two volumes to Karl Josef von Hefele&#x27;s &quot;Conciliengeschichte&quot; (ib., 1887 and 1890).

<text>Enemies () is a 1906 Russian-language play by Maxim Gorky. It was published in 1906 in the collection &quot;Znaniye&quot; (Knowledge, book 14), in Saint Petersburg, at a time when Gorky was actively involved with the Russian revolutionary underground, which served as the impetus for the play. It is a recognized as an early work of socialist realism.

==Plot==
The action takes place in 1905 at the factory of the landowners Bardiny and Skrobotov. Skrobotov is dissatisfied with the liberal policy of his partner Bardiny and complains that the workers are given too much voice – &quot;They don&#x27;t dare squeak at me!&quot; says Skrobotov, sincerely believing that the working class should not be allowed entertainment, education, or voting rights.

The factory has a social democratic worker&#x27;s organization, and its activists demand the removal of a cruel manager, Dichkov. Skrobotov categorically refuses, believing that even if Dichkov deserves removal in this case, doing so in response to worker demands would be a fatal step.

Discussions between the workers lead nowhere, the situation spirals out of control, Skrobotov summons the militia, and blood is shed. One of the enraged workers mortally wounds Skrobotov, who before he dies identifies the worker as a communist. A murder investigation ensues, the militia arresting masses of workers. But the workers do not break, and display iron calm, coolness and courage.

A worker, Akimov, comes to Bardiny and confesses to the murder. But other workers come, and stand behind Akimov. Skrobotov&#x27;s widow Cleopatra advises Akimov to flee into exile, to which Akimov responds:
==Productions and adaptations==

&quot;Enemies&quot; was produced at the Moscow Art Theater beginning October 10, 1935, directed by Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko and Mikhail Nikolayevich Kedrov.

Ann Pennington directed a multi-national production of &#x27;Enemies&#x27; in association with Internationalist Theatre, in London, in the March of 1985. One critic saw a parallel between the workers&#x27; uprising in Enemies and the Miners&#x27; Strike that had been running in the UK since 1984, saying, &quot; it is about the miners strike &quot; UK miners&#x27; strike (1984–85). Gorky`s &quot;pseudo-populism&quot; is done away with in this production by the actors speaking &quot;without distinctive accents and consequently without populist sentiment&quot;. Designed by Paul Brown, the cast included Madlena Nedeva, Nick Ellsworth, Angelique Rockas and Marilyn Flynn 

A production was mounted at the Omsk Academic Drama Theater, beginning May 20, 2014, directed by Georgy Zurabovich Tskhvirava.

&quot;Enemies&quot; was adapted into an English-language television film, broadcast under the auspices of &quot;Great Performances&quot; on January 23, 1974. Ellis Rabb wrote the adaptation and shared directing credit with Kirk Browning, and also appeared as an actor, as did Frances Sternhagen, Peter Donat, Kate Reid, and Josef Sommer.

==Plot==
The story is set around a group of students taking a college course in which they are asked to list ways in which society could benefit from the application of nanotubes. They are assigned together apparently at random, and they decide their topic: using nanotubes to alter human DNA, giving them access to abilities which are latent in the human genome. When they present their thesis, the university refuses to let them test it. During the night they test the nanotubes upon themselves and awake with superhuman abilities.

It has been implied that the experiment that gave them their powers has some connection to Jeff Carey, aka Breakdown, who stars in another of Aftermath&#x27;s titles.

==Characters==
*Ariel Davis (alias Six) - A young woman who has all of her senses heightened to a super human level, with an extra sixth sense
*Jack Morgan (alias Idol) - A young man with the ability to control pheromones and hormones at will

<doc id="1334222" wikidata="Q6560927" url="?curid=1334222" title="List of massacres during the Algerian Civil War">
<text>Many massacres were committed during the Algerian Civil War that began in 1991. The Armed Islamic Group (GIA) claimed responsibility for many of them, while for others no group has claimed responsibility. In addition to generating a widespread sense of fear, the massacres effected migration from and depopulation of the worst-affected areas. The number of massacres peaked in 1997, with a smaller peak in 1994, and they were particularly concentrated in the areas between Algiers and Oran, with very few occurring in the east or in the Sahara.

This list is not exhaustive and covers only events in which over 50 civilians or prisoners were killed; with the number of smaller massacres being far more numerous. Sources frequently disagree on the number of deaths.

==Wilaya of Algiers==
* Serkadji prison mutiny of 21 February 1995, 109 deaths
* Beni-Messous massacre of 5–6 September 1997, 87-151 deaths
* Bentalha massacre of 22 September 1997, 202-300 deaths

==Wilaya of Ain-Defla==

<text>Francis Herbert Goldsborough (July 16, 1910 – July 16, 1930) was a record-holding aviator who died in a plane crash in Vermont on his 20th birthday.

==Early years==
Goldsborough was born in Washington, D.C. His father was Brice Goldsborough, who died in a plane crash as Frances Wilson Grayson&#x27;s navigator on an attempted crossing of the Atlantic Ocean from Newfoundland. Frank&#x27;s stepmother was named Gertrude. By the time he was 18 the family was living in New York where he attended Flushing High School in Queens.

==Transcontinental speed record==
Goldsborough held the junior transcontinental air speed record until his death. In April and May 1930 he wrote a series of exclusive first-person accounts for &quot;The New York Times&quot; about his exploits in the National Air Tour and his breaking of the transcontinental air speed record.

==Death==
Goldsborough&#x27;s plane crashed in Vermont on July 15, 1930, only a day short of his 20th birthday. His passenger, Don Mockler, walked away from the crash, dazed but alive, and went for help. Goldsborough was trapped in the wreckage with a head injury for 18 hours before he was rescued, alive but not conscious. All his teeth had been knocked out. He was carried away by rescuers on a makeshift stretcher made from a parachute to the home of Harry C. Jenkins.

Goldsborough died on July 16, 1930, at Putnam Memorial Hospital in Bennington on his 20th birthday, without regaining consciousness.

==Funeral==
He was buried on July 19, 1930, at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx. Charles Lindbergh sent flowers. His body was moved by his stepmother and reburied on 30 July 1930 to Kensico Cemetery in Valhalla, Westchester County, New York. His stepmother, Gertrude Jacobi Goldsborough, and her mother Anna Marie Hoehn Jacobi are buried there as well.

<text>Ernest Abraham Hart (26 June 18357 January 1898) was an English medical journalist. He was the editor of &quot;The British Medical Journal&quot;.

==Biography==

Hart was born in London, the son of a Jewish dentist. He was educated at the City of London school, and became a student at St George&#x27;s hospital. In 1856, he became a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, making a specialty of diseases of the eye. He was appointed ophthalmic surgeon at St Mary&#x27;s hospital at the age of 28, and occupied various other posts, introducing into ophthalmic practice some modifications since widely adopted. His name, too, is associated with a method of treating popliteal aneurism, which he was the first to use in Great Britain.

His real life-work, however, was as a medical journalist, beginning with the &quot;Lancet&quot; in 1857. He was appointed editor of the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; on 11 August 1866. During this time, the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot;&#x27;s harsh criticism of Isaac Baker Brown lead to the complete destruction of Brown&#x27;s career. As editor, Hart can be held accountable in part for this (as can the editor before him, William Orlando Markham). His campaigning editorials could be vicious. They were usually sententious and often self-congratulatory.

On 22 November 1866 Hart was appointed as a poorlaw inspector as his colleague William Orlando Markham rejected the position. He took a leading part in the exposures which led to the inquiry into the state of London work-house infirmaries, and to the reform of the treatment of sick poor throughout England, and the Infant Life Protection Act of 1872, aimed at the evils of baby farming, was largely due to his efforts. The record of his public work covers nearly the whole field of sanitary legislation during the last thirty years of his life.

He had a hand in the amendments of the Public Health and of the Medical Acts, always promoting the medical profession above others in the public health field; in the measures relating to notification of infectious disease, to vaccination, to the registration of plumbers; in the improvement of factory legislation; in the remedy of legitimate grievances of Army and Navy medical officers; in the removal of abuses and deficiencies in crowded barrack schools; in denouncing the sanitary shortcomings of the Indian government, particularly in regard to the prevention of cholera.

His work on behalf of the British Medical Association is shown by the increase from 2,000 to 19,000 in the number of members, and the growth of the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; from 20 to 64 pages, during his editorship. From 1872 to 1897 he was chairman of the Association&#x27;s Parliamentary Bill Committee.

Beginning his collections by contacting Tadamasa Hayashi in 1882, Hart became a prominent collector of Japanese Art and later joined the Japan Society, frequently giving lectures on subjects such as Lacquerware. In 1891 he travelled to Japan with his second wife, Alice Hart.

Hart was also editor of &quot;The Sanitary Record&quot; for a period, and chairman of the National Health Society.

==Vaccination==

In 1880, Hart authored the book &quot;The Truth About Vaccination&quot;. It refuted the arguments made by anti-vaccinators. Each anti-vaccination allegation was disproved with medical and statistical evidence. Hart demonstrated from a vast body of evidence the advantages of how a vaccinated person can resist an attack of smallpox, compared to those un-vaccinated.

==Selected publications==
* An account of the condition of the infirmaries of London workhouses, 1866
*&quot;The Truth About Vaccination: An Examination and Refutation of the Assertions of the Anti-Vaccinators&quot; (1880)
*&quot;Hypnotism, Mesmerism and the New Witchcraft&quot; (1896)

==Family==
Hart married his first wife, Rosetta Levy, in 1855. He married his second wife, in 1872, Alice Marion Rowland, the sister of social reformer Henrietta Barnett. Rowland had herself studied medicine in London and Paris, and was no less interested than her husband in philanthropic reform. She was most active in her encouragement of Irish cottage industries, and was the founder of the Donegal Industrial Fund.

<doc id="1334279" wikidata="Q3699868" url="?curid=1334279" title="Cydrome">
<text>Cydrome (1984–1988) was a computer company established in San Jose of the Silicon Valley region in California. Its mission was to develop a numeric processor. The founders were David Yen, Wei Yen, Ross Towle, Arun Kumar, and Bob Rau (the chief architect).

==History==
The company was originally named &quot;Axiom Systems.&quot; However, another company in San Diego called &quot;Axiom&quot; was founded earlier. Axiom Systems called its architecture &quot;SPARC.&quot; It sold the rights to the name (but not the architecture) to Sun Microsystems and used the money to hire NameLab to come up with a new company name. They came up with &quot;Cydrome&quot; from &quot;cyber&quot; (computer) and &quot;drome&quot; (racecourse).

Cydrome moved from an office in San Jose to a business park in Milpitas on President&#x27;s Day 1985. This site was used to host meetings of the Bay Area ACM chapter&#x27;s Special Interest Group in Large Scale Systems (SIGBIG), in contrast to then SIGSMALL for microcomputers, which are now called &quot;PCs,&quot; and its present-day national SIGHPC.

Late in its history, Cydrome received an investment from Prime Computers and OEMed the Cydra-5 through Prime. The system sold by Cydrome had white skins. The skins for the Prime OEM system were black. In the summer of 1988, Prime was set to acquire Cydrome. At the last minute, the board of Prime decided not to go through with the deal. That sealed the fate of Cydrome.

The company closed after roughly 4 years of operation in 1988. Many of the ideas in Cydrome were carried on in the Itanium architecture.

==Product==
In order to improve performance in a new instruction set architecture, the Cydrome processors were based on a very long instruction word (VLIW) containing instructions from parallel operations. Software pipelining in a custom Fortran compiler generated code that would run efficiently.

The numeric processor used a 256 bit-wide instruction word with seven &quot;fields&quot;. In most cases the compiler would find instructions that could run in parallel and place them together in a single word. It also had a special mode where each of the operations could be executed sequentially. It implemented register rotation to aid in software pipelining of loops. There was an instruction cache only, since it was felt that a data cache would be inefficient on sparse array operations.

The numeric processor also incorporated memory management and consequently employed virtual memory concepts. The memory subsystem implemented a 64-way interleaved 4-port memory. To ensure that there would be no &quot;hot spots&quot; within the memory system, the addresses to the memory were hashed to spread the accesses evenly across the 64-way memory system.

It was implemented in ECL running at 25 MHz. Major functional modules were implemented using AMCC ECL ASICs. The project grew beyond its original definition to include a front-end general-purpose processor ensemble based on the multiple 68020 processors running Unix System V. The numeric processor ran a small kernel that would allow it to receive job submissions from the Unix system. The initial machine was dubbed the Cydra-5 and nine systems (three prototypes plus six production units) were built. In 1987, the machine saw its first public appearance at the first Supercomputer Conference held in Santa Clara, CA. A sample Cydra-5 is in storage at the Computer History Museum.

<doc id="1334301" wikidata="Q10553309" url="?curid=1334301" title="Legislative chamber">
<text>A legislative chamber or house is a deliberative assembly within a legislature which generally meets and votes separately from the legislature&#x27;s other chambers. Legislatures are usually unicameral, consisting of only one chamber, or bicameral, consisting of two, but there are rare examples of tricameral and tetracameral legislatures. The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is the only country documented as having a pentacameral (later hexacameral) legislature.

== Bicameralism ==


In a &quot;bicameral&quot; legislature, the two bodies are often referred to as an &quot;upper&quot; and a &quot;lower&quot; house, where the latter is often regarded as more particularly the representatives of the people. The lower house is almost always the originator of legislation, and the upper house is the body that offers the &quot;second look&quot; and decides whether to veto or approve the bills. In the United Kingdom legislation can be originated in either house, but the lower house can ultimately prevail if the two houses repeatedly disagree. In most countries the lower house also has sole or predominant control over matters to do with finance and taxation.

A parliament&#x27;s lower house is usually composed of at least 100 members, in countries with populations of over 3 million. The number of seats rarely exceeds 400, even in very large countries. Among the countries with large lower houses are France, where the National Assembly has 577 members, and Japan, where the House of Representatives has 475 members. The upper house of a parliament customarily has anywhere from 20 to 200 seats, but almost always significantly fewer than the lower house. In the United Kingdom however, the lower house (the House of Commons) has 650 members, but the upper house (the House of Lords) currently has slightly more members than the lower house, and at one time (before the exclusion of most of the hereditary peers) had considerably more.

==Merging of chambers==
Until 1953, the Rigsdag in Denmark was divided into two houses, the &quot;Folketing&quot; and &quot;Landsting&quot;, but has since become a unicameral legislature. The same goes with Sweden, and its &quot;Riksdag&quot; until 1971. The Norwegian parliament (&quot;Storting&quot;) was officially divided in two chambers 1814–2009, but functioned as a single chamber in practice, a situation called Qualified unicameralism.

==Floor and committee==
The &quot;floor&quot; is the name for the full assembly, and a &quot;committee&quot; is a small deliberative assembly that is usually subordinate to the floor. In the United Kingdom, either chamber may opt to take some business such as detailed consideration of a Bill on the Floor of the House instead of in Committee.

== Security ==
The building that houses the Chambers of a Parliament is usually equipped with an internal police and in some, the public force is not allowed access without authorisation.

<text>Thomas Gordon Hake (10 March 180911 January 1895) was an English physician and poet.

==Life==
Hake was born in Leeds on 10 March 1809, and was descended from an old Devonshire family who had &#x27;lived on the soil for many years without being distinguished in any branch of science, literature, or art.&#x27; His father, whose usual residence was Sidmouth, possessed considerable musical acquirements. His mother, fourteen years older than the father, was of the Huntly branch of the Gordon family, being eldest daughter of Captain William Augustus Gordon, and aunt of General Charles Gordon. His father died when Hake was three years old and his mother, left with a moderate competence, continued to live in Devonshire, and obtained for her son an admission to Christ&#x27;s Hospital, where, first at the preparatory school at Hertford and afterwards in London, he received most of his education.

Having determined upon a medical career, Hake studied at Lewes under Thomas Hodson, &#x27;the highest authority in his profession within the bounds of Sussex,&#x27; afterwards at St. George&#x27;s Hospital, and at the University of Edinburgh and University of Glasgow, at which latter he graduated. After travelling for some time in Italy he settled at Brighton, where he was for five years physician to the dispensary, then proceeded to Paris for a year&#x27;s study, and on his return in 1839 published &quot;Piromides,&quot; a tragedy on the mysteries of Isis, and the &#x27;nebulous but impressive romance,&#x27; as Mr. W. M. Rossetti calls it, &quot;Vates, or the Philosophy of Madness,&quot; first issued in four incomplete numbers, with illustrations by Charles Landseer (1840, 4to), and afterwards republished in &quot;Ainsworth&#x27;s Magazine&quot; as &#x27;Yaldarno, or the Ordeal of Art-Worship.&#x27;

Towards 1844, &#x27;it seethed in my brother&#x27;s head,&#x27; says Mr. Rossetti, and it ultimately led to a friendship between Dante Rossetti and the author eventful for both. Hake next settled at Bury St. Edmunds, where he became intimate with George Borrow and J. W. Donaldson, of both of whom he has given interesting particulars in his autobiography. Between 1839 and 1853, he contributed numerous papers, chiefly of a scientific complexion, to the medical journals. About the latter date he gave up practice at Bury, travelled in America, and on his return established himself at Roehampton, and, while tilling the post of physician to the West London Hospital, became physician to the Countess of Ripon, who was related to his mother&#x27;s family. The beauty of Lady Ripon&#x27;s woods at Nocton revived the spirit of poetry within him. He wrote his &quot;Lily of the Valley&quot; and his &quot;Old Souls,&quot; which, with other poems, were threaded together as &quot;The World&#x27;s Epitaph,&quot; privately printed in 1866 in an edition of one hundred copies. One of these came into the hands of Rossetti, who admired it as enthusiastically is &quot;Valdarno,&quot; and the two poets met in October 1869. 

In Rossetti&#x27;s darkest days, when in 1872 his life was nearly terminated by laudanum, Hake rendered the greatest service. &quot;He was the earthly providence of the Rossetti family,&quot; says Mr. W. M. Rossetti. He took Dante Rossetti to his house during the wont of the crisis, afterwards accompanied him to Scotland, and consented to his own son George acting for a long time as Rossetti&#x27;s companion and secretary, a position which the derangement of the patient&#x27;s mental and physical health eventually rendered untenable.
After 1872, Hake spent a considerable time in Italy and Germany, and, returning to England, settled near St. John&#x27;s Wood, principally occupied in the composition and publication of poetry for the few, difficult rather than obscure in thought and diction, but uninviting to those who cannot appreciate mystical symbolism. In 1871 he published &quot;Madeline and other Poems,&quot; reproducing much of &quot;The World&#x27;s Epitaph.&quot; In 1872 appeared &quot;Parables and Tales,&quot; comprising &quot;Old Souls.&quot; In 1876 he published &quot;New Symbols&quot;; in 1879 &quot;Legends of the Morrow&quot;; in 1880 &quot;Maiden Ecstasy&quot;; in 1883 &quot;The Serpent Play,&quot; and in 1890 &quot;The New Day&quot;, a collection of sonnets in the Shakespearean form.

Hake&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Memoirs of Eighty Years&quot;, was published in 1892. During the last four years of his life he was confined to his couch by a fracture of the hip, but his faculties and spirits remained unimpaired. He died on 11 January 1895 and is buried in a family grave on the western side of Highgate Cemetery.
==Works==
In 1839, he published a prose epic &quot;Vales&quot;, republished in &quot;Ainsworth&#x27;s Magazine&quot; as &quot;Valdarno&quot;, which attracted the attention of Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Rossetti, against his habit, reviewed Hake&#x27;s poems in &quot;The Academy&quot; and the &quot;Fortnightly Review&quot;. Hake became a member of the circle round Rossetti. Hake&#x27;s first poetry collection, &quot;The World&#x27;s Epitaph&quot;, was published in 1866, in a print run of 100.

In 1871, Hake published &quot;Madeline&quot;; in 1872, &quot;Parables and Tales&quot;; in 1879, &quot;Legends of the Morrow&quot;; in 1880 &quot;Maiden Ecstasy&quot; (poems) in 1883, &quot;The Serpent Play&quot;; in 1890, &quot;New Day Sonnets&quot;; and, in 1892, his &quot;Memoirs of Eighty Years&quot;.

==Family==
In the 1830s, Hake married Lucy Bush. They had several sons, including Alfred Egmont Hake, an author and philosopher who wrote a biography of General Charles Gordon.

<text>Nicolas Auguste Tissot (; March 16, 1824 – July 14, 1907) was a French cartographer, who in 1859 and 1881 published an analysis of the distortion that occurs on map projections. He devised Tissot&#x27;s indicatrix, or distortion circle, which when plotted on a map will appear as an ellipse whose elongation depends on the amount of distortion by the map at that point. The angle and extent of the elongation represents the amount of angular distortion of the map. The size of the ellipse indicates the amount that the area is distorted.

==Biography==
Born in Nancy, Meurthe, France, Tissot was trained as an engineer in the French Army, from which he graduated as &quot;capitaine du génie&quot;. In the early 1860s he became an instructor in geodesy at the well-reputed Ecole Polytechnique in Paris. Around the same time, he indulged a research program meant to determine the best way of cartographic projection for a particular region and presented his findings to the French Académie des Sciences.

In the eighteenth century, the German cartographer Johann H. Lambert had enunciated a mathematical theory of map projections and of the attendant characteristics of distortions that any given projection involved. Carl Friedrich Gauss had also studied the subject before Tissot&#x27;s contributions later in the nineteenth century.

Tissot&#x27;s research in the mid-1850s on methods for finding good projections for particular regions led him to develop a projection that he saw as optimal. While not quite equal-area or conformal, his projection resulted in &quot;negligible distortion for a very small region.&quot; Subsequently, his optimal projection was adopted by the geographic service of the French Army. 
While his first concepts regarding cartographic distortions developed in mid-century, it was only with the publication of &quot;Mémoire sur la représentation des surfaces et les projections des cartes géographiques&quot; in 1881 that the Tissot&#x27;s Indicatrix became popular. In the book, Tissot argued for his method, reportedly demonstrating that &quot;whatever the system of transformation, there is at each point on the spherical surface at least one pair of orthogonal directions which will also be orthogonal on the projection.&quot;

Tissot employed a graphical device he called the &quot;ellipse indicatrice&quot; or &quot;distortion circle&quot;. When plotted on a map it reveals the amount of distortion by the map at the particular point where the ellipse is plotted. He suggested that the angle and extent of the elongation of the distortion circle represented the amount of angular distortion of the map, while the size of the ellipse corresponded to the amount of distortion in area.

In a nineteenth-century cartographic context, in which professionals looked for ways to apply mathematical principles to the science of mapping and the map projection, Tissot&#x27;s theory was favorably received, at least in continental Europe. Even in the more restrained Anglo-American academic world, a columnist of &quot;Science&quot;, a publication sponsored by the American Association for the Advancement of Science, hailed Tissot&#x27;s method and encouraged his readers to study his work in the hope that such a study &quot;will lead to the adoption of better projections than those which are at present in use.&quot; The legacy of Tissot’s method is still vivid today, as suggested by the authors of &quot;Map Projections for Europe&quot;, who argue that since Tissot’s famous analysis regarding distortion, the only major scientific development in the metric interpretation of deformation has been Eduard Imhof&#x27;s &quot;Verzerrungsgitter&quot;, or &quot;deformation grid&quot;.

Tissot died in Voreppe, Isère on .

<text>Megathrust earthquakes occur at convergent plate boundaries, where one tectonic plate is forced underneath another. The earthquakes are caused by slip along the thrust fault that forms the contact between the two plates. These interplate earthquakes are the planet&#x27;s most powerful, with moment magnitudes (&quot;Mw&quot;) that can exceed 9.0. Since 1900, all earthquakes of magnitude 9.0 or greater have been megathrust earthquakes.

The thrust faults responsible for megathrust earthquakes often lie at the bottom of oceanic trenches; in such cases, the earthquakes can abruptly displace the sea floor over a large area. As a result, megathrust earthquakes often generate tsunamis that are considerably more destructive than the earthquakes themselves. Teletsunamis can cross ocean basins to devastate areas far from the original earthquake.

==Terminology and mechanism==
The term &quot;megathrust&quot; refers to an extremely large thrust fault, typically formed at the plate interface along a subduction zone, such as the Sunda megathrust. However, the term is also occasionally applied to large thrust faults in continental collision zones, such as the Himalayan megathrust. A megathrust fault can be long.
A thrust fault is a type of reverse fault, in which the rock above the fault is displaced upwards relative to the rock below the fault. This distinguishes reverse faults from normal faults, where the rock above the fault is displaced downwards, or strike-slip faults, where the rock on one side of the fault is displaced horizontally with respect to the other side. Thrust faults are distinguished from other reverse faults because they dip at a relatively shallow angle, typically less than 45°, and show large displacements. In effect, the rocks above the fault have been thrust over the rocks below the fault. Thrust faults are characteristic of areas where the Earth&#x27;s crust is being compressed by tectonic forces.

Megathrust faults occur where two tectonic plates collide. When one of the plates is composed of oceanic lithosphere, it dives beneath the other plate (called the &quot;overriding plate&quot;) and sinks into the Earth&#x27;s mantle as a &quot;slab&quot;. The contact between the colliding plates is the megathrust fault, where the rock of the overriding plate is displaced upwards relative to the rock of the descending slab. Friction along the megathrust fault can lock the plates together, and the subduction forces then build up strain in the two plates. A megathrust earthquake takes place when the fault ruptures, allowing the plates to abruptly move past each other to release the accumulated strain energy.

==Occurrence and characteristics==

Megathrust earthquakes are almost exclusive to tectonic subduction zones and are often associated with the Pacific and Indian Oceans. These subduction zones are also largely responsible for the volcanic activity associated with the Pacific Ring of Fire.

Since these earthquakes deform the ocean floor, they often generate strong tsunami waves. Subduction zone earthquakes are also known to produce intense shaking and ground movements that can last for up to 3–5 minutes.

In the Indian Ocean region, the Sunda megathrust is located where the Indo-Australian plate subducts under the Eurasian plate along a fault off the coasts of Myanmar, Sumatra, Java and Bali, terminating off the northwestern coast of Australia. This subduction zone was responsible for the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. In parts of the megathrust south of Java, referred to as the Java Trench, for the western part, 8.9 is possible, while in the eastern Java segment, 8.8 is possible, while if both were to rupture at the same time, the magnitude would be 9.1.

In the South China Sea lies the Manila Trench, which is capable of producing 9.0 or larger earthquakes, with the maximum magnitude at Mw 9.2 or higher.

In Japan, the Nankai megathrust under the Nankai Trough is responsible for Nankai megathrust earthquakes and associated tsunamis. The largest megathrust event within the last 20 years was the magnitude 9.0–9.1 Tōhoku earthquake along the Japan Trench megathrust.

In North America, the Juan de Fuca plate subducts under the North American plate, creating the Cascadia subduction zone from mid Vancouver Island, British Columbia down to Northern California. This subduction zone was responsible for the 1700 Cascadia earthquake. The Aleutian Trench, of the southern coast of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands, where the North American plate overrides the Pacific plate, has generated many major earthquakes throughout history, several of which generated Pacific-wide tsunamis, including the 1964 Alaska earthquake; at magnitude 9.1–9.2, it remains the largest recorded earthquake in North America, and the third-largest earthquake instrumentally recorded in the world.

In the Himalayan region, where the Indian plate subducts under the Eurasian plate, the largest recorded earthquake was the 1950 Assam–Tibet earthquake, at magnitude 8.7. It is estimated that earthquakes with magnitude 9.0 or larger are expected to occur at an interval of every 800 years, with the highest boundary being a magnitude 10, though this is not considered physically possible. Therefore, the largest possible earthquake in the region is a magnitude 9.7, assuming a single rupture of the whole Himalayan arc and assuming standard scaling law, which implies an average slip of 50 m.

A megathrust earthquake could occur in the Lesser Antilles subduction zone, with a maximum magnitude of 9.3, or potentially even 10.3 through recent evaluations, a value not considered impossible.

The largest recorded megathrust earthquake was the 1960 Valdivia earthquake, estimated between magnitudes 9.4–9.6, centered off the coast of Chile along the Peru-Chile Trench, where the Nazca plate subducts under the South American plate. This megathrust region has regularly generated extremely large earthquakes.

The largest possible earthquakes are estimated at magnitudes of 10 to 11, most likely caused by a combined rupture of the Japan Trench and Kuril–Kamchatka Trench, or individually the Aleutian Trench or Peru–Chile Trench. Another possible area could be the Lesser Antilles subduction zone.

A study reported in 2016 found that the largest megathrust quakes are associated with downgoing slabs with the shallowest dip, so-called flat slab subduction.

Compared with other earthquakes of similar magnitude, megathrust earthquakes have a longer duration and slower rupture velocities. The largest megathrust earthquakes occur in subduction zones with thick sediments, which may allow a fault rupture to propagate for great distances unimpeded.

<text>Tiedemann Giese (1 June 1480 – 23 October 1550), was Bishop of Kulm (Chełmno) first canon, later Prince-Bishop of Warmia (Ermland) whose interest in mathematics, astronomy, and theology led him to mentor a number of important young scholars, including Copernicus. He was a prolific writer and correspondent, publishing a number of works on the reformation of the church. Tiedemann was a member of the patrician Giese family of Danzig (Gdańsk). The Giese family ancestors originated from Unna in Westphalia, near Dortmund. His father was Albrecht Giese and his younger brother, the Hanseatic League merchant Georg Giese.

==Life and career==

Giese was the fifth child of Albrecht Giese and his wife, Elisabeth Langenbeck, both members of wealthy merchant families. His paternal family had emigrated from Cologne to Danzig in the 1430s. His father was the Mayor of Danzig, and his mother&#x27;s uncle, Johann Ferber, had been Mayor of Danzig.

At the age of 12 years, Tiedemann, along with his cousin, Johann Ferber, entered the University of Leipzig, and subsequently studied at Basel and in Italy. He earned a Master of Theology degree. Giese was one of the best educated scholars in Prussia, well versed in both theology and the sciences. At age 24, he and Mauritius Ferber (possibly a cousin) became priests at the Catholic Church of St. Peter and St. Paul.

He was secretary to the King of Poland, and later appointed canon of Frauenburg (Frombork), where he remained for 30 years. His residence was the Episcopal Castle at Frauenburg. The King appointed him Bishop of Kulm on 22 September 1537 (ratified by the Pope on 11 January 1538). Toward the end of his life, he became Bishop of Ermland.

Giese was supported by Chancellor Lucas David. He was a humanist and a liberal in the Erasmian mould. Although a Catholic, he demonstrated relative tolerance towards Lutherans. He made himself the spokesperson for a group of liberal and tolerant men who wanted to mediate between the &quot;old-believers&quot; and &quot;the new-believers&quot;. In his writings, he expressed the aim of reconciling the Catholic and Protestant branches of the church, but ultimately alienated both of them.

Bishop Giese was a lifelong friend and frequent companion of the astronomer and proponent of heliocentrism Nicolaus Copernicus and shared his interest in astronomy. As a very wealthy man, Giese had the best instruments which, from time to time, he loaned to Copernicus. Giese, seven years younger than Copernicus, was sufficiently well educated to be able to follow Copernicus&#x27; studies. Giese bought his friend an ingenious sundial, and gave him an instrument with which he could observe the equinoxes. The mathematician, Rheticus, published a list of Giese&#x27;s astronomical instruments, which he considered to have been made by men who really understood their mathematics.

Giese actively encouraged his friend, Copernicus, to publish his findings in relation to the movement of the planets in the solar system. In turn, Copernicus regularly acknowledged his indebtedness to the many friends, especially Giese and Rheticus, who had supported him and encouraged him to publish.

In 1516, Giese was the co-author, with Copernicus, of a letter to the Polish King Sigismund I the Old asking for the King&#x27;s protection of Prussia against the Teutonic Knights, and generally supported the interests of the Polish Crown against that of the Teutonic Order. Danzig had been part of the State of the Teutonic Order since the Teutonic invasion of Gdańsk Pomerania in 1308. Its population became ethnically German as a result. In 1466 Danzig reverted to the Kingdom of Poland, within which it retained considerable independence (e.g. had its own judiciary and minted its own coinage). The region&#x27;s ethnic German inhabitants resisted full incorporation into Poland, but turned to the Polish King for support against the Teutonic aggressors.

He also worked on updating the Kulm law while a canon in Ermland. On 1 July 1536 he was designated by King of Poland, Sigismund I, who considered him a very valuable diplomat, as Bishop of Kulm, which was later confirmed by the Pope. After Mauritius Ferber&#x27;s death, Giese became prince-bishop.

Giese was described by his contemporaries as a very pious man, an extremely learned man, a loyal friend, generous and a man who supported those in need. Nicolaus Copernicus explained that his &quot;devoted friend, Tiedeman Giese, [was] a man filled with the greatest zeal for the divine and the liberal arts.&quot;

Giese was a prolific writer and correspondent. He regularly corresponded with young, ambitious scholars, encouraging them and following their careers with interest. In the preface of his book, &quot;De revolutionibus&quot;, Copernicus credits Giese with encouraging publication and urging him not to conceal the principles on which he deduced his theory of planetary motions. He carried out active correspondence with the humanist Erasmus of Rotterdam, the Lutheran reformer, Philip Melanchthon and the humanist philosopher, Damião de Gois.

Among his known publications is &quot;Centum et decem assertiones, quas auctor earum Flosculos appellavit de homine interiore et exteriore&quot; and &quot;Antilogikon,&quot; a polemical refutation of Lutheran reformer Johann Briesmann. He also wrote &quot;De Regno Christi&quot; in which he envisions a reformed, reunited and reinvigorated church, but which now only survives in fragments. He also wrote a treatise defending Copernicus&#x27;s theory of planetary motions. Most of his other works have been lost, including a treatise on Aristotle.

His friend, Copernicus (who died in 1543) willed his writings to Giese and left his library to the church administration of the Prince-Bishopric of Ermland (Warmia). Bishop Giese died in Heilsberg (Lidzbark) and was laid to rest next to Copernicus at the Frauenburg (Frombork) cathedral.

<text>Jessops (Group) Limited is a British photographic retailing company. It was established in 1935 by Frank Jessop in Leicester, United Kingdom. The company controls Jessops Europe Limited, which in turn control JR Prop Limited (formerly Jessops Retail Limited).

In the end of the 2000s, the business struggled with insolvency, and entered administration in January 2013. The company was rescued by PJ Investment Group, founded by entrepreneur Peter Jones CBE who bought the assets, and formed Jessops (Group) Limited, and related companies.

==History==
===Early years to 1990s===

Frank Jessop founded Jessop of Leicester in 1935, as a specialist photographic retailer. The company expanded to major towns and cities.

Jessop later used the Centon name as an own brand for a range of photographic and related goods sold through its shops.

===Sale of company and following years (1996–2007)===

In July 1996, Alan Jessop, the son of founder Frank Jessop, sold the firm in a management buyout to Bridgepoint Capital.

Bridgepoint Capital attempted to float Jessops on the London Stock Exchange in September 2000, but abandoned plans the following month. This was because it was told the firm would list with a market value of £90 million to £100 million. The two hundredth store, Durham, opened in July 2001, which has since closed down. Jessops once again abandoned plans to float, in April 2002.

ABN Amro paid £116 million for the company, in September 2002. The sale was completed the next month. ABN Amro applied to float on the London Stock Exchange in October 2004, which successfully occurred the next month. In May 2004, the main warehouse relocated to Weedon Bec, Northamptonshire, as the warehouse in Leicester was considered too small. This resulted in most of the staff being made redundant.

===Financial problems (2007–2013)===
The company suffered financial difficulties by June 2007, requiring the strategic review, and eventually leading to a re financing with its bankers, HSBC, in September 2009. This led to the group&#x27;s trade being transferred to a new holding company, Snap Equity Limited, whilst Jessops plc was placed in liquidation and the group&#x27;s final salary pension scheme transferred to the Pension Protection Fund.

Snap Equity was formed as a private company, 48% owned by HSBC, 33% by pension trustees, and 20% by an employee trust. On 21 June 2007, Jessops announced the closure of 81 of its then 315 stores, as &quot;part of a strategic review, which aimed to save the Leicester firm £15m&quot;. HSBC acquired the company circa September 2009, in a &quot;debt for equity&quot; deal. The &quot;Financial Times&quot; commented that the company was hurt by the increasing quality of mobile phone cameras, reducing demand for traditional cameras.

On 9 January 2013, Jessops went into administration, with an application made to the High Court. On 11 January, it was announced that all 187 stores would close, with the loss of 1,370 jobs. Shoppers who put up to £500 on a gift card, found them useless, and the company ceased to accept customer returns, although manufacturers&#x27; warranties on products not branded by Jessops, were not affected.

On 31 January 2013, however, the brand of Jessops, and various assets, were acquired by PJ Investment Group owned by entrepreneur, Peter Jones, one of the investors from the television programme, &quot;Dragons&#x27; Den&quot;. Various new companies were incorporated including Jessops (Group) Limited, Jessops Europe Limited and Jessops Retail Limited. Jones also incorporated &quot;Jessops Online Limited&quot;, at the same time.

On 3 February, the supermarket retailer, Morrisons, agreed to purchase seven of Jessops larger store sites, from the administrators, for an undisclosed price, to be converted to the convenience store format by Morrisons, M Local.

=== Reopening (2013–2019) ===
On 28 March 2013, six stores reopened, and Jessops aimed to open a new store every day on average during April 2013. One of the six opened on the 28 March, the store in Oxford Street in London, received considerable media interest, and was attended by several celebrities, including the actor James Corden. Another store in London, Birmingham, Manchester, Aberdeen and High Wycombe were the other five.

St Albans opened on the 29 March. Several other stores reopened throughout April. All the new stores contained a mini labs, offering same day processing of photographic film. The company had reopened twenty eight stores across the United Kingdom, by September 2013. Jessops signed a landmark deal with Sainsbury&#x27;s in July 2014, to start opening Jessops branches in its larger stores, the first of which opened in October 2014. There were fifty two stores of Jessops, by April 2016.

=== Financial difficulties (2019–present) ===
ReSolve were appointed as administrators for JR Prop Limited, in December 2019. This company holds property leases and employs retail staff, the main trading company, Jessops Europe Limited, was not affected.

On the 26 March 2021, Jessops announced that were considering a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) which would allow it to survive. PJ Investment Group is offering to provide additional financial support if management can come up with a sustainable business plan. On 27 August 2021 Jessops successfully secured 100% approval of the CVA and PJ Investment Group invested several million pounds into the business in order to provide sufficient capital to grow the business.

In the year to 1 October 2023, the company reported revenues of £19.97 million, a decrease of 7.5 per cent on the previous year leading to a £1.2 million loss.

In July 2024, HM Revenue and Customs issued the company a winding-up petition due to its outstanding tax liability.

Writing in Latin in a time of plague and war, Gregory structured his work as a conversation between himself and Peter, a deacon. His focus is on miraculous events in the lives of monastics.

The second book is devoted to a life of Saint Benedict.

==Reception==
The &quot;Dialogues&quot; were the most popular of Gregory&#x27;s works during the Middle Ages, and in modern times have received more scholarly attention than the rest of his works combined. From this, the author himself is sometimes known as Gregory the Dialogist.

Pope Zachary () translated the &quot;Dialogues&quot; into Greek.

<text>Armand Joseph Bruat (Colmar, 26 May 1796 – &quot;Montebello&quot;, off Toulon, 19 November 1855) was a French admiral.

== Biography ==
Bruat joined the French Navy in 1811, at the height of the Napoleonic Wars. His early career included far-ranging sea duties: in 1815, he served in Brazil and the West Indies. From 1817 to 1820 he was with French forces in the Levant. Then, until 1824, he was stationed first in Senegal and then the Pacific.

As a Lieutenant, Bruat took part in the 1827 Battle of Navarino as maneuver officer on &quot;Breslaw&quot;. In 1830, he received command of the brig &quot;Silène&quot; and cruised off Algiers, taking a number of prizes. As &quot;Silène&quot; followed the &quot;Aventure&quot; commanded by Félix-Ariel d&#x27;Assigny (1794–1846), she was wrecked and the crew was captured during the shipwreck of Dellys, 110 men being massacred. While captive, Bruat managed to transmit observations on the state of the defences of Algier to admiral Duperré.

After the Invasion of Algiers, Bruat was promoted to captain and awarded commanded the &quot;Iéna&quot;, off Portugal. He then served on &quot;Triton&quot;, before supervising naval constructions in Toulon from 1841.

In 1843, he was made the Governor of the Marquesas Islands. During this time, he was also France&#x27;s agent at the court of Queen Pomare of Tahiti, where he was able to convince her to acknowledge a French protectorate over her realm.

In 1849, Bruat became Governor-General of the Antilles and in 1852 was promoted to vice admiral. In 1854, during the Crimean War, he was named Commander of the French Fleet in the Black Sea. He died at sea from cholera, near Toulon, on his flagship, the &quot;Montebello&quot;, on 19 November 1855.

<text>Labyrinths (1962, 1964, 1970, 1983) is a collection of short stories and essays by Argentine writer and poet Jorge Luis Borges. It was translated into English, published soon after Borges won the International Publishers&#x27; Prize with Samuel Beckett.

It includes, among other stories, &quot;Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius&quot;, &quot;The Garden of Forking Paths&quot;, and &quot;The Library of Babel&quot;, three of Borges&#x27;s most famous stories.

== Analysis ==
André Maurois in the Preface of &quot;Labyrinths&quot; provides a critical overview of Borges&#x27;s work. He makes three main points: first, that Borges was highly influenced by his wide and obscure reading, making the assertion that, &quot;His sources are innumerable and unexpected. Borges has read everything, and especially what nobody reads any more: the Cabalists, the Alexandrine Greeks, medieval philosophers. His erudition is not profound ― he asks of it only flashes of lightning and ideas ― but it is vast.&quot;. Second, that Borges has many precursors, but is in the end, almost entirely unique - &quot;... once these relationships are pointed out, it must be said that Borges&#x27;s style is, like his thought, highly original&quot;. In this Maurois notes that to some extent, &quot;&#x27;Every writer creates his own precursors&#x27;&quot;, finally noting that Borges&#x27;s stories can be described by &quot;&#x27;an absurd postulate developed to its extreme logical consequences&#x27;&quot;, making &quot;a game for [Borges&#x27;] mind&quot;. This, he claims, reflects Borges&#x27; interest in metaphysics and philosophy, and leads to his style of magical realism.

== Translators ==
&quot;Labyrinths&quot;″ principal editor and translator is James Irby, Professor Emeritus at Princeton. Irby&#x27;s work on &quot;Labyrinths&quot; includes the book&#x27;s Introduction and translations of the stories &quot;Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius&quot;, &quot;Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote&quot;, &quot;The Circular Ruins&quot;, &quot;The Library of Babel&quot;, &quot;Funes the Memorious&quot;, &quot;Theme of the Traitor and the Hero&quot;, &quot;Three Versions of Judas&quot;, &quot;The Sect of the Phoenix&quot;, &quot;The Immortal,&quot; &quot;The Theologians&quot;, &quot;Story of the Warrior and the Captive&quot;, &quot;The House of Asterion&quot;, &quot;Averroes&#x27; Search&quot;, and &quot;The Waiting&quot;: fourteen titles in all, and the largest part of the translation work for the book.

The balance of the translations are by Donald A. Yates, Professor Emeritus of Spanish American literature at Michigan State University; John M. Fein, Professor Emeritus, Spanish, in the Department of Romance Languages at Duke University; Julian Palley (September 16, 1925 - December 20, 2014) of the University of California, Irvine; and author and prize-winning translator Harriet de Onís.

== Reception ==
On the book&#x27;s release, the journalist Mildred Adams at &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote of it, &quot;The translations, made by various hands, are not only good they are downright enjoyable. They make it finally possible, after all these years, to give Borges his due and to add North Americans to his wide public.&quot; In 2012, the novelist Jake Arnott observed in &quot;The Independent&quot;:

Like many of my generation, I first encountered him in the Penguin edition of &quot;Labyrinths&quot;, a collection of stories, essays, parables and poetry. An excellent compendium, it&#x27;s a sort of collection of collections which I find a little frustrating (although it mirrors his theme of recursiveness). More recently, there has been the reissue of all of his short stories: &quot;Collected Fictions&quot;, translated by Andrew Hurley. But this new translation, commissioned by his estate after his death, has proved controversial. The battle over Borges&#x27;s legacy in English has become as Daedalian as one of his faux literary essays. It&#x27;s hard to know where to begin rereading.

The essayist Alberto Manguel writes in &quot;The Guardian&quot;:

since the first American translations of Borges, attempted in the Fifties by well-intentioned admirers such as Donald Yates and James Irby, English-speaking readers have been very poorly served. From the uneven versions collected in &quot;Labyrinths&quot; to the more meticulous, but ultimately unsuccessful, editions published by Norman Thomas di Giovanni, from Ruth Simm&#x27;s abominable apery of &quot;Other Inquisitions&quot; to Paul Bowles&#x27;s illiterate rendition of &quot;The Circular Ruins&quot;, Borges in English must be read in spite of the translations.

In 2008 the London Society of Authors selected &quot;Labyrinths&quot; as one of the fifty outstanding translations from the last fifty years.

<text>Wei Yen () is a Taiwanese-American technologist and serial entrepreneur. He has been involved with several companies, including most recently as Chairman and Founder of AiLive.

Yen received his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering in Operating Systems and Artificial Intelligence from Purdue University. Yen and his brother David Yen along with King-sun Fu published the paper &quot;Data Coherence Problem in a Multicache System&quot; that describes a practical cache coherence protocol.

==Career==
Yen served as the Director of Software Engineering for Cydrome, where he worked with his brother David, who served as the Director of Hardware Engineering. They were the major contributors to the Cydra-5 mini-supercomputer. The system was a combination of a VLIW ECL-based processor used for scientific applications and a multi-processor system designed for a bus architecture based on their Cache Coherence protocol.

Yen served as Senior Vice President of Silicon Graphics from 1988 to 1996, where he led development on OpenGL and also served as President of subsidiary MIPS Technologies. In 1996, he left SGI and founded TVsoft, a maker of interactive software for television setup devices. The company was renamed Navio and later merged with Oracle&#x27;s Network Computer. Subsequently, the company went public as Liberate Technologies in July 1999. Its public offering reached a $12 billion valuation in early 2000 with a revenue run rate of $25 million.

In parallel, Yen founded a company called ArtX, employed with former SGI graphics engineers. ArtX received the contract to deliver the GameCube&#x27;s Flipper graphics chip. The company was acquired by ATI in February 2000 for $400 million. This led to ATI&#x27;s greatly improved R300 graphics chip family. Yen later joined ATI&#x27;s board of directors.

With Nintendo, Yen cofounded another company iQue, the manufacturing and distributing arm of Nintendo for mainland China.

Yen founded iGware, a company that offers cloud computing services to its customers, including Nintendo. iGware&#x27;s cloud services power the online services of the Nintendo DS, Wii, Nintendo 3DS, and Wii U. In July 2011, Acer, of which Yen is a former board member, acquired the US-based iGware for $320 million, and thus iGware becomes a part of Acer&#x27;s company structure in providing cloud services. iGware changed its name to Acer Cloud Technology Co. and continued to be headed by Yen. As a result of the acquisition, Yen is the second largest shareholder of Acer after founder Stan Shih.

Yen is currently the chairman and founder of AiLive, the company that partnered with Nintendo in developing software tools for programmers working with the Wii Remote controller and Wii MotionPlus attachment.

Yen has been on the board of several prominent companies including Acer, ATI, MoSys, and others.

<text>Harvard Summer School, founded in 1871, is a summer school run by Harvard University. It serves more than 5,000 students per year.

==History==

Harvard Summer School was founded in 1871. It is the first academic summer session established and the oldest summer school present in the United States. The Summer School is part of the Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences and is one of the principal programs within the Harvard Division of Continuing Education.

==Academics==
Each summer, more than 5,000 students arrive from across the U.S. and more than 100 foreign countries. Students from American and foreign universities often enroll in the school to study for seven weeks with Harvard faculty as well as visiting scholars from other institutions. The Summer School does not offer any degrees but grants academic credits.

The Summer School offers more than 300 daytime and evening classes in over 60 disciplines. Among its offerings are the Pre-College Program, the Ukrainian Summer Institute, and a study abroad program. Study abroad programs feature hands-on experiences, ranging from language studies in Georgia to archaeological digs in Tønnesminde, Denmark.

<doc id="1334372" wikidata="Q1284362" url="?curid=1334372" title="Quintessence (band)">
<text>Quintessence were a rock band formed in April 1969 in Notting Hill, London, England. Their style was a mixture of jazz, psychedelic rock and progressive rock with an influence of music from India.

==Career==
The original line-up included Sambhu Babaji (bass guitar), Maha Dev (rhythm guitar), Shiva Shankar Jones (vocals, keyboards, percussion), Jake Milton (drums, percussion), Allan Mostert (lead guitar) (born 1952), and Raja Ram (flute, percussion). Jones, an Australian, had been Phil Jones and with his Sydney band The Unknown Blues had a hit with &quot;If I Had a Ticket&quot; in 1967.

They rehearsed in All Saints Hall which was a converted church near Portobello Road, and recorded three albums for Island Records between 1969 and 1971, with two further albums recorded in 1972 for RCA. The first of the latter set, &quot;Self&quot;, featured studio material on side one, with the band recorded playing live at Exeter University, on 11 December 1971, on side two.

They built a reputation on solid club work. Besides appearing at the first two Glastonbury Festivals (then called &#x27;Fayres&#x27;), in 1970/71, they also were invited to play the Montreux Jazz Festival.


On 18 September 1971, Quintessence played a benefit concert for Bangladesh at The Oval, Kennington. They appeared on a bill that included The Who, Mott the Hoople, Lindisfarne, Atomic Rooster, The Grease Band and America.

Although Quintessence played many hundreds of concerts and festivals all over Europe, they turned down a U.S. record deal negotiated by Island Records&#x27; Chris Blackwell and did not play at a concert at New York&#x27;s Carnegie Hall lined up in early 1972, or tour the U.S., because four of the band&#x27;s members wanted a larger monetary advance. This disappointed Blackwell and he dropped the band from the record label. Quintessence then signed with RCA and recorded one album with Jones and Dev. Raja Ram then unexpectedly &#x27;fired&#x27; the pair after that album was released. Jones and Dev went on to form the short-lived outfit called Kala. Meanwhile, Quintessence played on into the 1980s before breaking up.

==Later activities==
Jones, the primary composer of Quintessence, has been extensively touring throughout the United States for the last 20 years. Jones has released numerous recordings of both new material and updated versions of Quintessence songs with his Swiss musical partner, Ralph Rudra Beauvert, via their band Shiva&#x27;s Quintessence. As of 2014, Jones is performing in the U.S. with Boston-based guitarist Frank M Evans, as Trans-Portal, expressing many of the Quintessence songs in a more intimate and acoustic format.

In 2010, Maha Dev&#x27;s new Quintessence were invited by Michael Eavis to play the 40th Anniversary Glastonbury Festival, where they were joined by original vocalist Jones. Produced by John Barham, Quintessence&#x27;s previous producer, this performance was recorded and released as &quot;Rebirth: Live At Glastonbury&quot; in 2011. The reunion of Phil Shiva Jones with Dev&#x27;s Quintessence for the 2010 Glastonbury Festival was documented in a BBC One &quot;Inside Out&quot; programme which was aired in November 2010.

Maha Dev&#x27;s Quintessence continued to perform sporadically in the UK recreating the &#x27;classic&#x27; Island Records era Quintessence sound. Dev released his first solo album, and Jones&#x27; Quintessence continues to record sporadically. Jake Milton went on to form Blurt with his brother Ted Milton. Raja Ram went on to help create the psytrance style of electronic music in the 1990s, and continues to produce electronic music to this day, being most well known for his involvement in Shpongle.

Maha Dev (born David Codling) died on 5 July 2019 from cancer.

<text>Harvard Extension School (HES) is the continuing education School of Harvard University, a private Ivy League research university in Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States. Established in 1910, it is one of the oldest liberal arts and continuing education schools in the United States. Part of the Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences, HES offers both part-time, open-enrollment courses, as well as selective undergraduate (ALB) and graduate (ALM) degrees primarily for nontraditional students. Academic certificates and a post-baccalaureate pre-medical certificate are also offered.

Established by then-university President A. Lawrence Lowell, HES was commissioned to extend education, equivalent in academic rigor to traditional Harvard programs, to non-traditional and part-time students, as well as lifelong learners. Under the supervision of the Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences, HES offers over 900 courses spanning various liberal arts and professional disciplines, offered in on-campus, online, and hybrid formats. These courses are generally available to both its matriculated students and to the general public.

For matriculation, HES places significant weight on an applicant&#x27;s academic transcript at Harvard rather than previous academic work. According to Harvard&#x27;s current guidelines, students are required to achieve a minimum 3.0 GPA in degree-credit coursework in order to matriculate. Once this academic criterion is met, applicants must submit a formal application, which is subsequently reviewed by a committee. Matriculated students have additional benefits such as convocation, graduation, cross-registration, teaching assistant, faculty research aid, and supervised senior thesis or research paper; they also, as students of Harvard University, have access to the full resources and the broader academic environment of Harvard.

==History==
Founded in 1910, based out of his work with the Lowell Institute, then-Harvard President A. Lawrence Lowell, wanted to tether his work to a &quot;proper university&quot; and serve the &quot;many people in our community, who have not been to college, but who have the desire and the aptitude to profit by so much of a college education as, amid the work of earning their living, they are able to obtain.&quot; It was designed to serve the educational interests and needs of the Greater Boston community, particularly those &quot;who had the ability and desire to attend college, but also had other obligations that kept them from traditional schools.&quot;

James Hardy Ropes, Extension&#x27;s first dean, said that &quot;our aim will be to give the young people of Boston who have heretofore been prevented from securing a college education the same instruction they would receive were they undergraduates at Harvard [College].&quot; He added that &quot;many persons who wish that they had a college education will be able to get gradually an effective substitute for it--in some respects more effective than the ordinary college education because of the greater eagerness and maturity of such students.&quot; 

In the early years, a commission composed of several Boston area schools ran the courses, though it was largely a Harvard-run program. Early faculty included Charles Townsend Copeland, William Yandell Elliott, William L. Langer, Oscar Handlin, Perry Miller, John Kenneth Galbraith, and Frank M. Carpenter. During the 1920s, affiliates traveled around New England to teach courses offsite. While they were primarily aimed at teachers, courses were offered whenever 40 or more students expressed an interest. Professors traveled on a weekly basis to places as far away as Yonkers, New York, some 200 miles away. 

Lowell&#x27;s bequest limited tuition to no more than &quot;two bushels of wheat.&quot; During the Great Depression, this amounted to roughly $5 per semester course. Several years after his retirement, President Lowell wrote that the Extension courses &quot;have given a service to the public ... which seems to me of the utmost importance.&quot; In his will, John Lowell asked his successors to develop courses &quot;more erudite and particular corresponding to the age.&quot; By the 50th anniversary of the Commission of Extension in 1960, more than 1,400 courses had taught to over 85,000. 

In the 2010s, more than 100 years after its founding, the Extension School&#x27;s classes were described as &quot;surprisingly affordable&quot; and the school itself was said to be a &quot;thriving institution.&quot;

===Degree development===
The Extension School currently offers two degrees (and has offered these degrees since 1979): the Bachelor of Liberal Arts in Extension Studies (ALB) and the Master of Liberal Arts in Extension Studies (ALM). From 1911 to 1933, the school offered an Associate in Arts, and from 1933 to 1960, it offered an Adjunct in Arts. Both were considered the equivalent of a bachelor&#x27;s degree. From 1971 to 2014, the school offered an Associate of Arts in Extension Studies (AA), the equivalent of a two-year degree.

==== Degree-name controversy ====
A proposal before the Faculty of Arts and Sciences in 2009 and 2010 to rename the school and the degrees offered was not accepted. A committee led by Professor of Computer Science Harry R. Lewis proposed renaming the school the &quot;Harvard School of Continuing and Professional Studies&quot; and dropping the words &quot;in Extension Studies&quot; from degrees so that the school would offer Bachelor of Liberal Arts, Master of Liberal Arts, and Master of Professional Studies degrees. Some faculty objected, saying that those degrees were too similar to &quot;Bachelor of Arts&quot; and &quot;Master of Arts&quot; degrees already offered by the college and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.

In 2016, a student group calling itself the Harvard Extension Degree Change Initiative rallied in front of University Hall to call for removing “Extension Studies” from the degree name and adding a student&#x27;s field of study instead. &quot;The Harvard Crimson&quot; editorialized in favor, urging Harvard to &quot;consider changing the title of Extension School degrees to include the field of study rather than the ambiguous &#x27;Extension Studies.&#x27;&quot; While the school retains &quot;Extension Studies&quot; in official degree titles, transcripts reflect students&#x27; area of academic concentration.

In 2019, then-Dean Huntington D. Lambert stated agreement with student complaints that degrees awarded by the Harvard Extension School should be rephrased to more accurately reflect students’ programs of study, but he was not successful in making any changes. In 2022, and again in 2023, members of the Harvard Extension Student Association, the student government of the Harvard Extension School, held a protest in Harvard Yard calling on the university to remove the words “in Extension Studies” from the Harvard Extension School Liberal Arts Degrees.

==Leadership==
===Deans===
The dean of the extension school is also the Dean of the Harvard Division of Continuing Education, who works under and reports directly to the Dean of Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences. There have been seven deans in the school&#x27;s history and three are alumni of Harvard College:
*James Hardy Ropes, Chairman of Commission on Extension Courses, Dean of University Extension, 1910–1922
*Arthur F. Whittem, Chairman of Commission on Extension Courses, Director of University Extension, 1922–1946
*George W. Adams, Chairman of Commission on Extension Courses, Director of University Extension, 1946–1949
*Reginald H. Phelps, Chairman of Commission on Extension Courses, Director of University Extension, 1949–1975
*Michael Shinagel, Director of Continuing Education and University Extension, 1975–1977, and Dean of Continuing Education and University Extension, 1977–2013
*Huntington D. Lambert, Dean of Continuing Education and University Extension, 2013–2019
*Nancy Coleman, Dean of the Division of Continuing Education, 2020–present

==Accreditation and partnerships==
Harvard University is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education.

Harvard Business School Online&#x27;s Credential of Readiness (CORe) program can be counted for Extension School undergraduate academic credit on a pass fail basis.

The graduate program in Museum Studies has a partnership with the Smithsonian Institution. The partnered courses include two active learning weekends in Washington, D.C. Harvard Extension School has collaborated with Massachusetts Institute of Technology Micromasters program for Management, Sustainability, and Development Practice Masters degree program.

==Academics==

Part of the Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Harvard Extension School offers more than 900 on-campus and online courses, most of which have open enrollment. The number of courses offered has continuously grown over the school&#x27;s history.

Students may enroll full or part-time, and classes may be taken on campus, via distance-learning, or both. In order to earn an academic degree, students must complete a minimum number of on-campus-only credits at Harvard. Since the school&#x27;s inception, it has only graduated less than two out of every thousand (0.2%) of its students. As of 2009, nearly 13,000 have graduated with degrees.

In August 2018, Grossman Library, located in Sever Hall, merged with the larger Harvard College Library system, giving non-degree students access to the Harvard Library, including electronic resources and select computer facilities. Those registered for a course at the Extension School may also access writing tutorials at the Writing Center as well as assistance with math and related courses at the Math Question Center. Career services and academic advising are offered through the school&#x27;s Career and Academic Resource Center.

Ropes, the school&#x27;s first dean, said that &quot;our aim will be to give the young people of Boston who have heretofore been prevented from securing a college education the same instruction they would receive were they undergraduates at Harvard.&quot; The Harvard Undergraduate Council found in a 2020 study of Extension courses that 156 were identical or nearly identical to courses at Harvard College and 95 were equivalent or similar, while 344 were unique to the Extension School. A &quot;New York Times&quot; guidebook stated that professors said some courses were &quot;virtually identical.&quot; As of the 2022-2023 academic year, courses for undergraduate credit at the Extension School were $1,980 and courses for graduate credit were $3,100.

A number of on-campus Harvard courses are recorded and offered to Extension students online. For these courses, office hours and other student support are typically available through live or asynchronous software. The majority of instructors at the Extension School, 52%, are Harvard affiliates; 48% are faculty from peer schools and industry professionals. Nobel laureate Roy J. Glauber has taught Extension courses.

===Special student===
Extension degree candidates may also apply for &quot;Special Student status&quot; to enroll for up to two courses per semester in Harvard College, Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, or another Harvard Graduate School.

===Pre-medical program===
A pre-medical program was established at the Extension School in 1980. Students who successfully complete the program are eligible for sponsorship and a committee letter of support in their applications to medical school.

===Distance education===
Harvard Extension was a pioneer in distance education. Beginning on December 5, 1949, courses were offered on the Lowell Institute&#x27;s new radio station. New Englanders could go to college six nights a week at 7:30 in their living rooms simply by tuning into courses on psychology, world history, and economics. The first course on radio was by Peter A. Bertocci of Boston University. 

The radio courses proved to be so successful that when the television station WGBH went on the air in October 1951 they began broadcasting an Extension class every weekday at 3:30 and 7:30. The first course, offered by Robert G. Albion, was on European Imperialism. In the late 1960s, three of the televised courses were offered in the Deer Island Prison. Students who watched the courses on television could attend six &quot;conferences&quot; and take a mid-term and a final exam at Harvard in order to gain credit for the class.

, distance-learning courses at Harvard Extension School are offered in two formats: asynchronous video courses (lectures are recorded and uploaded within 24 hours of on-campus class meetings); and live web-conference courses (courses are streamed live, and typically allow for synchronous participation from students via a secondary online platform).

The first online courses were offered in 1997. Between 2013 and 2016, the number of online classes grew from 200 to more than 450.

==Degree programs==


To be eligible to apply to the Extension School&#x27;s degree programs, students must &quot;earn [their] way in&quot; by passing the Test of Critical Reading and Writing Skills as well as completing two or three designated admission classes with a B or better. In 2016, then-Dean Huntington D. Lambert said that 32% of those who want to pursue an undergraduate degree (ALB) earn the grades necessary for admission, making admissions &quot;very selective.&quot; If the admission requirements are met, acceptance is not guaranteed but very likely. About 85% of those admitted successfully earn their degree (ALB).

ALB students may graduate &quot;cum laude&quot;, but &quot;magna&quot;- and &quot;summa&quot;- &quot;cum laude&quot; are not offered. Extension students may earn the Dean&#x27;s List Academic Achievement Award upon graduation based on a high GPA (at least 3.5 for ALB, 3.8 for ALM). Many courses are offered online, but a degree cannot be earned entirely online as students are required to take classes on campus before earning their degree.

Students who wish to earn degrees must be formally admitted by the Admissions Committee. Admitted degree candidates are granted full privileges to Harvard&#x27;s libraries, facilities, and student resources, as well as access to Harvard&#x27;s museums and academic workshops. As of 2019–20, an undergraduate degree cost about $58,800, and a graduate degree cost about $28,400–$34,080.

Of the over 30,000 students enrolled in the Extension School, 850 are admitted degree candidates for the Bachelor of Liberal Arts in Extension Studies (ALB) and 3,063 are admitted degree candidates for the Master of Liberal Arts in Extension Studies (ALM).

===Bachelor of Liberal Arts (ALB)===
The undergraduate curriculum requires expository writing, quantitative reasoning, foreign language, moral reasoning, upper-level coursework, and an area of concentration. The expository writing class is known as a &quot;gatekeeper course&quot; as it will typically &quot;determine whether [students] are prepared for the intensive and demanding curriculum.&quot;

Once admitted as an ALB degree candidate, students must successfully complete 128 credits (Harvard courses are typically 4 credits each) and maintain good academic standing to meet graduation requirements. Upon admission into the ALB program, students may petition to transfer up to a maximum of 64 credits from other accredited post-secondary institutions, but 64 credits must be completed at Harvard. Students select one of three &quot;areas of concentration&quot; which are humanities, science, and social sciences.

ALB degree candidates are also required to complete a minimum of 16 on-campus-only credits at Harvard; students must also complete a minimum of 12 writing-intensive credits and earn a minimum of 52 credits in courses that are taught by Harvard instructors. In addition to a concentration, degree candidates have the option to pursue one of twenty &quot;fields of study&quot; (similar to majors). In order to successfully complete a field of study, students must earn a B− or higher in 32 Harvard credits in one field, and maintain a B average in the field. Students may also complement their degree with up to two minors.

=== Undergraduate admissions ===
Undergraduate degree programs require pre-admission courses as well as a formal application process. Students must also hold a &quot;high school diploma or its equivalent [which] must have been earned at least five years prior to enrolling in any ALB degree-applicable courses.&quot; Students applying for degree candidacy must complete three 4-credit liberal arts courses at Harvard with at least a B grade in each, and maintain a minimum 3.0 cumulative GPA. One of these three pre-admission courses must be EXPO E-25. To enroll in this course, students must either pass a placement test, which measures critical reading and writing skills, or enroll in EXPO E-15 (a course that acts as a precursor to EXPO E-25). Students failing to earn at least a B in a class can retake it once. Those who meet all these criteria are then eligible to apply for admission into the school&#x27;s undergraduate degree programs.

===Master of Liberal Arts (ALM)===
The Master of Liberal Arts in Extension Studies (ALM) includes 19 liberal arts fields of study and seven professional degree programs (Biotechnology, Information Technology, Journalism, Management, Mathematics for Teaching, Museum Studies, &amp; Sustainability). Except for Museum Studies (10 courses), all ALM candidates must complete 12 courses—48 credit hours—with most requiring a thesis or capstone project crafted under the direction of an instructor or faculty member holding a teaching appointment in the Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences.

=== Graduate admissions ===
Application to a graduate degree program requires an accredited bachelor&#x27;s degree (or foreign equivalent), passing the Test of Critical Reading and Writing Skills, the completion of two or three designated pre-admission courses with grades of B or higher, and a cumulative grade-point average of 3.0. One of the pre-admission courses must be the &quot;proseminar&quot; course for the intended area of study, which is akin to a traditional research methods course. Some disciplines have additional specified pre-admission coursework, while others have specific coursework that is required before submitting a master&#x27;s thesis proposal (biology and psychology students must take a specific graduate statistics course). In addition, several programs require supplemental application materials; for instance, Creative Writing and Literature ALM candidates must submit original manuscripts. Students who meet these criteria are then eligible to submit an application for admission into the graduate degree programs (ALM).

A student who fails to earn a grade of B after twice enrolling in the proseminar course—often considered a &quot;gatekeeper&quot; course—will be denied admission indefinitely.

=== Privileges and demographics ===
Students who graduate from the Extension School become part of the Harvard Alumni Association. Extension students have dedicated study spaces, conferences rooms, and access to the dining hall in Lehman Hall. Alpha Sigma Lambda, the national honor society for nontraditional students, has a Harvard chapter. There is a student government body for the Harvard Extension School which participates in the Harvard Graduate Council. Admitted degree candidates have access to many of the same student privileges of other Harvard alumni, such as access to athletic facilities, libraries, and museums.

The class of 2019, the largest class to date, had 1,184 graduates. The graduates had an average age of 37 and were nearly evenly split between the genders, with 54% being male. 49 countries were represented in the graduating class.

In 2016, 96% of the students enrolled for professional enrichment. Half took a single course, and half were pursuing a degree. The increase in online course offerings has fueled growth, and students from more than 150 countries are enrolled. In 2017, the school educated more students than all of the rest of Harvard combined.

In 2000, there were 14,216 students, with the youngest in their early teens and the oldest in their late 80s. There is often a span of 60 years between the oldest and youngest students, and students as young as 11 years old have taken courses alongside those old enough to be their grandparents. Of the students enrolled in 2000, 75% had a bachelor&#x27;s degree and 20% had a graduate degree. More than 1,700 were Harvard employees using the Tuition Assistance Program, and an estimated 10–15% were exclusively online students. Of the 255 Certificate of Special Studies graduates that year, 163 were international students hailing from 39 countries.

In the early 2000s, there were 208 students under the age of 18. Most attended local high schools, but a growing number were home-schooled. The Extension School now requires that a high school diploma or its equivalent is earned at least five years prior to enrolling in any courses applicable to its undergraduate degree.

Harvard Extension School enrolls about 4,000 international students each year. To be admitted to courses or degrees, a student must prove proficiency in the English language. If English is not a student&#x27;s native language, then they must submit an official TOEFL or IELTS score with a minimum score of 100 for the TOEFL or a minimum score of 7.0 for the IELTS. International students, like American students, must meet the on-campus-only course requirements to earn a degree. The Extension School does not issue I-20s for the F-1 visa. In 2013, students came from 118 countries and 46 states.

==Student life==
Harvard Extension School degree students can work as faculty aides and research assistants for instructors at the university. They can also run for elections in the Harvard Graduate Council and participate in Harvard Innovation Labs activities. The Harvard Extension Student Association has three student clubs and five different societies: the Psychological Student Society, the Creative Writing &amp; Literature Student Society, the Industrial Organizational Psychology Student Society, the Global Development Practice Student Society, and the Veteran Student Society.

<text>Cancer research is research into cancer to identify causes and develop strategies for prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and cure.

Cancer research ranges from epidemiology, molecular bioscience to the performance of clinical trials to evaluate and compare applications of the various cancer treatments. These applications include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, immunotherapy and combined treatment modalities such as chemo-radiotherapy. Starting in the mid-1990s, the emphasis in clinical cancer research shifted towards therapies derived from biotechnology research, such as cancer immunotherapy and gene therapy.

Cancer research is done in academia, research institutes, and corporate environments, and is largely government funded.

== History ==

Cancer research has been ongoing for centuries. Early research focused on the causes of cancer. Percivall Pott identified the first environmental trigger (chimney soot) for cancer in 1775 and cigarette smoking was identified as a cause of lung cancer in 1950. Early cancer treatment focused on improving surgical techniques for removing tumors. Radiation therapy took hold in the 1900s. Chemotherapeutics were developed and refined throughout the 20th century.

The U.S. declared a &quot;War on Cancer&quot; in the 1970s, and increased the funding and support for cancer research.

=== Seminal papers ===
Some of the most highly cited and most influential research reports include:

*&quot;The Hallmarks of Cancer&quot;, published in 2000, and &quot;Hallmarks of Cancer: The Next Generation&quot;, published in 2011, by Douglas Hanahan and Robert Weinberg. Together, these articles have been cited in over 30,000 published papers.

== Types of research ==
Cancer research encompasses a variety of types and interdisciplinary areas of research. Scientists involved in cancer research may be trained in areas such as chemistry, biochemistry, molecular biology, physiology, medical physics, epidemiology, and biomedical engineering. Research performed on a foundational level is referred to as basic research and is intended to clarify scientific principles and mechanisms. Translational research aims to elucidate mechanisms of cancer development and progression and transform basic scientific findings into concepts that can be applicable to the treatment and prevention of cancer. Clinical research is devoted to the development of pharmaceuticals, surgical procedures, and medical technologies for the eventual treatment of patients.

=== Prevention and epidemiology ===

Epidemiologic analysis indicates that at least 35% of all cancer deaths in the world could now be avoided by primary prevention. According to a newer GBD systematic analysis, in 2019, ~44% of all cancer deaths — or ~4.5 million deaths or ~105 million lost disability-adjusted life years — were due to known clearly preventable risk factors, led by smoking, alcohol use and high BMI.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1016/S0140-6736(22)01438-6&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

However, one 2015 study suggested that between ~70% and ~90% of cancers are due to environmental factors and therefore potentially preventable. Furthermore, it is estimated that with further research cancer death rates could be reduced by 70% around the world even without the development of any new therapies. Cancer prevention research receives only 2–9% of global cancer research funding, albeit many of the options for prevention are already well-known without further cancer-specific research but are not reflected in economics and policy. Mutational signatures of various cancers, for example, could reveal further causes of cancer and support causal attribution.

===Detection===
Prompt detection of cancer is important, since it is usually more difficult to treat in later stages. Accurate detection of cancer is also important because false positives can cause harm from unnecessary medical procedures. Some screening protocols are currently not accurate (such as prostate-specific antigen testing). Others such as a colonoscopy or mammogram are unpleasant and as a result some patients may opt out. Active research is underway to address all these problems, to develop novel ways of cancer screening and to increase detection rates.

For example:
* Multimodal learning AI systems are being developed to help detect many cancer types via integrating different types of data.
* Scientists work on identifying and measurability of novel biomarkers or sets of such to detect cancer early, such as tumor-associated mycobiomes and bacterial microbiomes
* Researchers investigate whether ants could be used as biosensors to detect cancer via urine

=== Treatment ===

Emerging topics of cancer treatment research include:

*Anti-cancer vaccines
**Oncophage
**Sipuleucel-T (Provenge) is a prostate cancer vaccine
**Inactivated tumor cells are investigated as potential bifunctional cancer vaccines
* Newer forms of chemotherapy
*Gene therapy
*Photodynamic therapy
*Radiation therapy
*Reoviridae (Reolysin drug therapy)
*Targeted therapy
*Medical microbots (including bacterial), nanobots and bacterial &#x27;cyborg cells&#x27;
* Virotherapy
* Antibodies
* Photoimmunotherapy (for brain cancer)
*Natural killer cells can induce immunological memory. Research is being developed to modify their action against cancer.
*How treatments can best be combined (in combination therapies)

=== Cause and development of cancer ===
Research into the cause of cancer involves many different disciplines including genetics, diet, environmental factors (i.e. chemical carcinogens). In regard to investigation of causes and potential targets for therapy, the route used starts with data obtained from clinical observations, enters basic research, and, once convincing and independently confirmed results are obtained, proceeds with clinical research, involving appropriately designed trials on consenting human subjects, with the aim to test safety and efficiency of the therapeutic intervention method.
An important part of basic research is characterization of the potential mechanisms of carcinogenesis, in regard to the types of genetic and epigenetic changes that are associated with cancer development. The mouse is often used as a mammalian model for manipulation of the function of genes that play a role in tumor formation, while basic aspects of tumor initiation, such as mutagenesis, are assayed on cultures of bacteria and mammalian cells.

==== Genes involved in cancer ====
The goal of oncogenomics is to identify new oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes that may provide new insights into cancer diagnosis, predicting clinical outcome of cancers, and new targets for cancer therapies. As the Cancer Genome Project stated in a 2004 review article, &quot;a central aim of cancer research has been to identify the mutated genes that are causally implicated in oncogenesis (&quot;cancer genes&quot;).&quot; The Cancer Genome Atlas project is a related effort investigating the genomic changes associated with cancer, while the COSMIC cancer database documents acquired genetic mutations from hundreds of thousands of human cancer samples.

These large scale projects, involving about 350 different types of cancer, have identified ~130,000 mutations in ~3000 genes that have been mutated in the tumors. The majority occurred in 319 genes, of which 286 were tumor suppressor genes and 33 oncogenes.

Several hereditary factors can increase the chance of cancer-causing mutations, including the activation of oncogenes or the inhibition of tumor suppressor genes. The functions of various onco- and tumor suppressor genes can be disrupted at different stages of tumor progression. Mutations in such genes can be used to classify the malignancy of a tumor. 

In later stages, tumors can develop a resistance to cancer treatment. The identification of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes is important to understand tumor progression and treatment success. The role of a given gene in cancer progression may vary tremendously, depending on the stage and type of cancer involved.

==== Cancer epigenetics ====
== Diet and cancer ==

Periods of intermittent fasting (time-restricted feeding which may not include caloric restriction) is investigated for potential usefulness in cancer prevention and treatment and as of 2021 additional trials are needed to elucidate the risks and benefits. In some cases, &quot;caloric restrictions could hinder both cancer growth and progression, besides enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy and radiation therapy&quot;. Caloric restriction mimetics, including some present in foods like spermidine, are also investigated for these or similar reasons. Such and similar dietary supplements may contribute to prevention or treatment, with candidate substances including apigenin, berberine, jiaogulan, and rhodiola rosea.

== Research funding ==

Cancer research is funded by government grants, charitable foundations and pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.

In the early 2000s, most funding for cancer research came from taxpayers and charities, rather than from corporations. In the US, less than 30% of all cancer research was funded by commercial researchers such as pharmaceutical companies. Per capita, public spending on cancer research by taxpayers and charities in the US was five times as much in 2002–03 as public spending by taxpayers and charities in the 15 countries that were full members of the European Union. As a percentage of GDP, the non-commercial funding of cancer research in the US was four times the amount dedicated to cancer research in Europe. Half of Europe&#x27;s non-commercial cancer research is funded by charitable organizations.

The National Cancer Institute is the major funding institution in the United States. In the 2023 fiscal year, the NCI funded $7.1 billion in cancer research.

== Difficulties ==
Difficulties inherent to cancer research are shared with many types of biomedical research.

Cancer research processes have been criticised. These include, especially in the US, for the financial resources and positions required to conduct research. Other consequences of competition for research resources appear to be a substantial number of research publications whose results cannot be replicated.

===Replicability===
== Public participation ==
===Distributed computing===
One can share computer time for distributed cancer research projects like Help Conquer Cancer. World Community Grid also had a project called Help Defeat Cancer. Other related projects include the Folding@home and Rosetta@home projects, which focus on groundbreaking protein folding and protein structure prediction research. Vodafone has also partnered with the Garvan Institute to create the DreamLab Project, which uses distributed computing via an app on cellphones to perform cancer research.

=== Clinical trials ===

Members of the public can also join clinical trials as healthy control subjects or for methods of cancer detection.

There could be software and data-related procedures that increase participation in trials and make them faster and less expensive. One open source platform matches genomically profiled cancer patients to precision medicine drug trials.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1038/s41698-022-00312-5&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organizations ==

Organizations exist as associations for scientists participating in cancer research, such as the American Association for Cancer Research and American Society of Clinical Oncology, and as foundations for public awareness or raising funds for cancer research, such as Relay For Life and the American Cancer Society.

=== Awareness campaigns ===
Supporters of different types of cancer have adopted different colored awareness ribbons and promote months of the year as being dedicated to the support of specific types of cancer. The American Cancer Society began promoting October as Breast Cancer Awareness Month in the United States in the 1980s. Pink products are sold to both generate awareness and raise money to be donated for research purposes. This has led to pinkwashing, or the selling of ordinary products turned pink as a promotion for the company.

<text>Port Kaituma is a small village within the Barima-Waini administrative region of Guyana. It became known internationally as a gateway village to the Peoples Temple settlement in nearby Jonestown. It has long been a hub for mining in the area.

== History ==
Although an Indigenous settlement has existed along the Kaituma River for some time, it was only after the discovery of manganese at nearby Matthews Ridge that Port Kaituma was developed. As Matthews Ridge was not located on a navigable river, a canal was cut from the Kaituma River and Port Kaituma was constructed. At the time of the manganese mining, Port Kaituma had three separate areas. The mine managers&#x27; house and the guest house were in a large clearing separated by a short road through the forest from the main rail-head and manganese loading facility. A longer road led in the opposite direction to the area known as &#x27;Bottom Floor&#x27; where the workers lived.

The manganese was transported from Matthews Ridge via a railway and then shipped from Port Kaituma to Chaguaramas Bay in Trinidad, from where it was distributed for industrial use with a large proportion going to Stavanger in Norway. The project was operated by subsidiaries of Union Carbide.

Two Trinidadian oil tankers, the Ambrosio and the Inverrosa, were converted into manganese carriers as part of this project. They made the trip from Port Kaituma to Chaguaramas on a regular four-day cycle for much of the 1960s. With a displacement of just under 3,000 tonnes, they were originally built in the mid 1920s with a shallow draft to ship oil across shallow sand-bars at the mouth of Lake Maracaibo in Venezuela. The ability to slip over sand bars in very shallow water was essential to their being able to get across Waini Bar at the mouth of the Kaituma River.

Port Kaituma&#x27;s significance grew further following the proclamation from the then-President of Guyana, Forbes Burnham, that Guyana should become more self-sufficient by populating the interior of the country. Matthews Ridge was highlighted as a potential new capital city, and within Port Kaituma a large secondary school was constructed to educate students sent from all over Guyana. During its heyday, the school boasted over 800 students, of which most were housed in two large dormitory buildings.

In the 1970s, Jim Jones&#x27; commune of Jonestown was built away from Port Kaituma. The first killings of the November 1978 Jonestown deaths occurred in Port Kaituma when Leo Ryan, a US Congressman from California, and others were gunned down while boarding a small Twin Otter aircraft on the local airstrip. In the aftermath and clean-up operation that ensued, the Guyanese Government prohibited any dead bodies from being buried on the site of the commune. This however didn&#x27;t stop locals from scavenging the worthless garbage left behind from the property.

Over the next 25 years, a large foreign-owned logging company came and went, the manganese factory at Matthews Ridge ceased working and the railway linking Matthews Ridge and Port Kaituma was closed and in some parts cut up. The school&#x27;s importance diminished and fell into a state of disrepair.

Today, Kaituma serves as the gateway to the nearby jungle where the now predominant industry of small-scale gold mining takes place. The transient nature of many of these pork-knockers (gold miners) has led to problems of gun crime, robbery, murder and bribery in the unpoliced hinterlands. This however does not perturb a continual flow of workers through the town, including a recent influx of Brazilians.

== Public services ==
Port Kaituma Community School provides nursery through secondary education. A hospital was commissioned in 2020. Also in 2020, Guyana Gold Board opened an office in Port Kaituma for testing and buying gold.

<text>Hermesianax of Colophon (; &quot;gen&quot;.: Ἑρμησιάνακτος) was an Ancient Greek elegiac poet of the Hellenistic period, said to be a pupil of Philitas of Cos; the dates of his life and work are all but lost, but Philitas is supposed to have been born c. 340 BC.

His chief work was a poem in three books, dedicated to his mistress Leontion. Of this poem a fragment of about one hundred lines has been preserved by Athenaeus. Plaintive in tone, it enumerates instances, mythological and semi-historical, of the irresistible power of love. Hermesianax, whose style is characterized by alternate force and tenderness, was exceedingly popular in his own times, and was highly esteemed even in the Augustan period.

Many separate editions have been published of the fragment, the text of which is in a very unsatisfactory condition: by FW Schneidewin (1838), J Bailey (1839, with notes, glossary, and Latin and English versions), and others; R Schulze&#x27;s &quot;Quaestiones Hermesianacteae&quot; (1858) contains an account of the life and writings of the poet and a section on the identity of Leontion.

The 2016 census measured the population of the village as 1,058 people in 397 households. It was the most populous village in its rural district.

Zibad, which means &quot;beautiful&quot; in Persian, was a famous ancient area in Shahnameh. According to Shahnameh Ferdowsi (around 1000 AD), it was the place of a famous war called Davazdah Rokh(12 hero) between Iran and Turan. Zibad also has an ancient qanat that may be more than 1600 years old.
==Zibad famous products and sites==

*Its Watermill, producing flour and cracked wheat. The ancient water mill was at work until 1984 and destroyed for the construction of a dam.
According to Callisthenes, the Persians were using water clocks in 328BCE to ensure a just and exact distribution of water from qanats to their shareholders for agricultural irrigation. The use of water clocks in Iran, especially in Zibad, dates back to 500BCE. Later they were also used to determine the exact holy days of pre-Islamic religions, such as the &quot;Nowruz&quot;, &quot;Chelah&quot;, or &quot;Yaldā&quot; - the shortest, longest, and equal-length days and nights of the years. The water clocks used in Iran were one of the most practical ancient tools for timing the yearly calendar.

==Zibad Castle==
Zibad Castle is one of the four historical monuments of Zibad. It is located in Gonabad and is believed to be the last shelter of the last Sasanian emperor Yazdegerd III. It was registered in 2001 as an Iranian national heritage property, as it is related to the history of pre-Islamic Iran. There is the royal castle nationally registered in 2002 under the name of Shahab Castle. Sources conflict as to the exact manner of the emperor&#x27;s final moments. One suggests that after his defeat, he sought refuge at a mill near Marv, the latter who killed Yazdegerd in order to obtain his jewelry. The Cambridge History of Iran states that the miller was sent by Mahoe Suri. According to the history of Belazari, Yazdegerd III was defeated in a war in the city of Gonabad.

According to the excavations of Zibad-Gonabad Fortress and according to oral narrations and the report of Blazeri and Habib Abdolhai, Dr Ajam and Abas Zmani (historical study magazine 1974), it seems that the narration related to the murder of Yazdgerd in Merw Mill is more mythical than fact. What is closer to the truth is the narration of Al-Baladhuri in Kitab Futuh al-Buldan, that he was killed in Gonabad.

The main text of Blazeri&#x27;s book The Fate of Yazdgerd III:

Then he went to Khorasan, then he went to Janabad (Gonabad) he was welcomed and ruler of Merv send Nizak Trkhan to welcome him in Gonabad. but after weeks he asked the emperor to marry his daughter and the emperor refused and this caused a war and at the end Nizak defeats the king&#x27;s army and destroys and captures remnants of the imperial forces. The battle occurred in Zibad Gonabad.
Mahoe Suri was probably from the House of Suren, one of the seven Parthian clans of the Sasanian state. During the Islamic invasion of Iran, Yazdegerd III went to refuge in Marv; on his way to Merv he stayed in Gonabad Mahoe. The envoy warmly received them. Mahoe Suri used opportunity to secretly plot with the Hephthalite ruler Nizak against Yazdegerd.

Regardless, the death of Yazdegerd marked the end of the Sasanian Empire, and made it less difficult for the Arabs to conquer the rest of Iran. All of Khorasan was soon conquered by the Arabs, who would use it as a base to attack Transoxiana. The death of Yazdegerd thus marked the end of the last pre-Islamic Iranian empire after more than 400 years of rule. An empire–which had a generation earlier briefly conquered Egypt and Asia Minor, even reaching as a far as Constantinople, fell to a force of lightly equipped Arabs that were used to skirmishes and desert warfare. The heavy Sasanian cavalry was too sluggish and systematized to contain them; employed light-armed Arab or East Iranian mercenaries from Khorasan and Transoxiana would have been much more successful.

== Sights and attractions ==


Zibad is an ancient place with many historical places. The Davazdah Rokh war had occurred in Zibad.

== Sufeh Pir ==
Sufeh Pir is another famous place in Zibad, a holy cave believed to be the tomb of Piran Viseh in the Kūh-Zibad mountain. He is a Turanian figure in Shahnameh, the national epic of Greater Iran.

According to the book of Dr. Abas Zamani Piran Viseh was buried in the cave of Sofe Zibad now called DarSufa Pir. 

==Sarv-e Zibad==
The Cypress of Zibad ( &quot;Sarv-e Zibad&quot;), is a &quot;Cupressus sempervirens&quot; tree in Zibad, Sarv-e Zibad is from Qanats of Ghasabeh a UNESCO&#x27;s World Heritage Sites since 2016.

<doc id="1334423" wikidata="Q28170" url="?curid=1334423" title="Max Brooks">
<text>Maximilian Michael Brooks (born May 22, 1972) is an American author. He is the son of comedian Mel Brooks and actress Anne Bancroft. Much of Brooks&#x27;s writing focuses on zombie stories. He was a senior fellow at the Modern War Institute at West Point, New York.

==Early life==
Brooks was born on May 22, 1972, in Manhattan, New York City. He is the son of actress Anne Bancroft and actor, director, producer, and writer Mel Brooks. His father is Jewish, while his mother was an Italian-American Catholic.

Brooks is dyslexic, and recalled that during the time in which he was growing up:
Brooks attended Crossroads School in Santa Monica, California. He studied at Pitzer College in Claremont, California, where he earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in history. He also attended graduate school, studying film at American University in Washington, D.C.

==Career==
=== Writing ===
From 2001 to 2003, Brooks was a member of the writing team at &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.

In 2003, Brooks wrote his first book, &quot;The Zombie Survival Guide&quot;, a fictional survival manual about zombies. In 2006, Brooks wrote the follow-up &quot;World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War&quot;, a novel on the same subject, set in the ten years following a zombie apocalypse. Paramount Pictures acquired the rights for a film adaptation, and Brad Pitt&#x27;s production company, Plan B Entertainment, produced the film. In the October 2006 issue of &quot;Fangoria&quot;, Brooks stated that he would not be writing the screenplay for the motion picture, as he felt he was not an accomplished enough screenwriter to &quot;do it right&quot;. J. Michael Straczynski wrote the first version of the screenplay.

Brooks wrote the introduction for the hardcover collected edition of Dynamite Entertainment&#x27;s zombie miniseries &quot;Raise the Dead&quot;, released in 2007.
In 2010, Brooks wrote the IDW comic book mini-series &quot;G.I. Joe: Hearts &amp; Minds&quot;.

In 2012, Brooks published &quot;Closure, Limited and Other Zombie Tales&quot;, featuring the story of that name from &quot;The New Dead&quot;, along with three other short stories set in the &quot;World War Z&quot; universe.

In 2014, Broadway Books published &quot;The Harlem Hellfighters&quot;, a graphic novel which portrays a fictionalized account of the African American 369th Infantry Regiment&#x27;s experiences in World War I, written by Brooks and illustrated by Caanan White. Sony Pictures has purchased the rights to create a film of the novel, with Caleeb Pinkett and James Lassiter producing on behalf of Overbrook Entertainment.

He wrote the story for the 2016 film &quot;The Great Wall&quot;, starring Matt Damon.

In 2016, Brooks was invited to MineCon and announced that he was working on a new novel based on &quot;Minecraft&quot;, titled &quot;&quot;, and in 2021, he published the sequel, &quot;Minecraft: The Mountain&quot;.

In August 2019, Brooks announced a new book, entitled &quot;&quot;, about the cryptid Bigfoot. It was released on June 16, 2020.

=== Acting and voice-over work ===
Brooks has a number of other creative credits. As an actor, he has been seen in &quot;Roseanne&quot;, &quot;To Be or Not to Be&quot;, &quot;Pacific Blue&quot;, and &quot;7th Heaven&quot;. He also has a career voicing animation: his voice has been featured in the animated shows &quot;Batman Beyond&quot;, &quot;Buzz Lightyear of Star Command&quot;, &quot;Justice League&quot;, and &quot;All Dogs Go to Heaven: The Series&quot;. During the start of the third season of &quot;Lost Tapes&quot;, he was cast as himself in the zombie episode, telling the audience about how zombies come to be. He also appeared on the Spike TV series &quot;Deadliest Warrior&quot;, in which he represented the zombie team in the &quot;Vampires vs. Zombies&quot; episode, as one of the zombie experts along with Matt Mogk, founder of the Zombie Research Society.

==Personal life==
Brooks has been married to playwright Michelle Kholos since 2003. They have one son and live in Venice, California. In October 2020, Brooks and his father appeared in a short video endorsing Joe Biden&#x27;s presidential campaign.

<text>Breakdown was a comic published by Devil&#x27;s Due Productions as part of their Aftermath line. It began in October 2004, and was written by Chuck Dixon, and drawn by Dave Ross.

The story is set around Jeff Carey, who, when he discovers/receives his powers, decides to use them for good, as Paragon, the world&#x27;s first superhero. He battles evil superhumans, such as Humongulous and Cactus Rose. He is loved by the media, by his wife, and by his daughter. One day, he is given a mysterious warning by a woman in a crowd. That night, his family is attacked. Only he survives, and his face is ruined. He tracks down the woman who warned him.

A year later, the special prison which houses Humongulous is attacked by a man with the same powers as Paragon. However, he wears a mask, and shares none of Paragon&#x27;s morality...

As of Issue #2, it is revealed that Jeff Carey received his powers from his father. Where his father got them is unclear, but is likely to involve a secret organization known as the Black Ring.

The first arc consisted of 6 issues.

<text>Famous Monsters of Filmland is an American genre-specific film magazine, started in 1958 by publisher James Warren and editor Forrest J Ackerman.

&quot;Famous Monsters of Filmland&quot; directly inspired the creation of many other similar publications, including &quot;Castle of Frankenstein&quot;, &quot;Cinefantastique&quot;, &quot;Fangoria&quot;, &quot;The Monster Times&quot;, and &quot;Video Watchdog&quot;. In addition, hundreds, if not thousands, of &quot;FM&quot;-influenced horror, fantasy and science fiction film-related fanzines have been produced, some of which have continued to publish for decades, such as &quot;Midnight Marquee&quot; and &quot;Little Shoppe of Horrors&quot;.

==Publication history==

===1958–1983===
&quot;Famous Monsters of Filmland&quot; was originally conceived as a one-shot publication by Warren and Ackerman, published in the wake of the widespread success of the &quot;Shock Theater&quot; package of old horror movies syndicated to American television in 1957. But the first issue, published in February 1958, was so successful that it required a second printing to fulfill public demand. Its future as part of American culture was immediately obvious to both men. The success prompted spinoff magazines such as &quot;Spacemen&quot;, &quot;Favorite Westerns of Filmland&quot;/Wildest Westerns, &quot;Screen Thrills Illustrated&quot;, &quot;Creepy&quot;, &quot;Eerie&quot;, and &quot;Vampirella&quot;.

&quot;FM&quot; offered brief articles, well-illustrated with publicity stills and graphic artwork, on horror movies from the silent era to the current date of publication, their stars and filmmakers. Warren and Ackerman decided to aim the text at late pre-adolescents and young teenagers.

In the pages of &quot;FM&quot;, Forrest J Ackerman promoted the memory of Lon Chaney Sr., whose silent works were mostly beyond the accessibility of fans for most of the magazine&#x27;s life, but were a great influence on his own childhood. He also introduced film fans to science fiction fandom through direct references, first-person experiences, and adoption of fandom terms and customs. The magazine regularly published photos from &quot;King Kong&quot; (1933), including one from the film&#x27;s infamous &quot;spider pit sequence&quot;, featured in Issue #108 (1974) which, until Ackerman discovered a photo of a spider in the cavern setting, had never been proven definitively to have actually been filmed.

&quot;FM&quot;&#x27;s peak years were from its first issues through the late 1960s, when the disappearance of the older films from television and the decline of talent in the imaginative film industry left it with a dearth of subject matter acceptable to both editor and fan.

Warren and Ackerman created a jump in issue numbering from issue 69, which was printed in September 1970, to issue 80 in October 1970, because (according to the editorial in issue 80) it moved them closer to issue #100. Ackerman justified this in the editorial with &quot;if, once upon a time, we had simply published 10 more numbers of FM instead of putting the same material in a companion magazine—&quot;Monster World&quot;—we would indeed by now have reached issue #80.&quot; During the 1970s, the magazine came to rely heavily on reprints of articles from the 1960s.

In November 1974 and November 1975, New York City was host to the &quot;Famous Monsters Convention,&quot; a fan convention centered on &quot;FM&quot;, which featured such guests as Forrest J Ackerman, Verne Langdon, James Warren, Peter Cushing, Ingrid Pitt, Barbara Leigh, Catherine Lorre, Cal Floyd, and Sam Sherman. (A similar gathering was held in 1995 in Los Angeles, with such guests as Maila Nurmi, Ray Harryhausen, John Landis, Joe Dante, Richard Matheson, Ray Bradbury, Curt Siodmak, Adam West, John Agar, Les Tremayne, Angus Scrimm, William Schallert, and Al Lewis.)

In the early 1980s, the magazine folded after Warren became ill and unable to carry on as publisher, and Ackerman resigned as editor in the face of the increasing disorganization within the leaderless Warren Publishing Company. The magazine stopped publication in 1983 after a run of 191 issues.

===&quot;Monsterland&quot; (1984–1987)===
After &quot;Famous Monsters of Filmland&quot; ceased publication in 1983, Ackerman was coaxed into briefly resuming his title as editor of a horror-oriented magazine with &quot;Forrest J Ackerman&#x27;s MONSTER LAND&quot; (with the official publication title inside as one all-caps word – &quot;MONSTERLAND&quot;, and then &quot;Monsterland&quot; from 1986 onward) by Hal Schuster of New Media Publishing, which began publication in December 1984. After two fill-in editorials by Ackerman as &quot;Editor &amp; Chief&quot; (beginning with issue #10 /1986), the cover title &quot;Forrest J Ackerman&#x27;s MONSTER LAND&quot; was shortened to &quot;MONSTER LAND&quot;, and Ackerman&#x27;s title changed to &quot;Editor Emeritus&quot; (with James Van Hise assigned as &quot;Editor&quot;). Inside that issue, host character &quot;Evila&quot; states that &quot;Forry [had] moved on.&quot; After the end of New Media Publishing in 1985, beginning with issue #10 the magazine was published by a new Schuster publishing entity, Movieland Publishing, Inc., until the final issue, #17 (summer 1987).

===Revival (1993–2008)===
&quot;Famous Monsters of Filmland&quot; was resurrected in 1993 by New Jersey portrait photographer and monster movie fan Ray Ferry. After finding that the &quot;Famous Monsters of Filmland&quot; title had not been &quot;maintained&quot; under law, Ferry filed for &quot;intent to use&quot; for the magazine&#x27;s trademark, unbeknownst to Ackerman or the trademark&#x27;s owner and creator, Jim Warren. Ferry, poised to restart publication of &quot;FM&quot; on a quarterly basis, offered Ackerman the position of editor-in-chief for a fee of $2,500 per issue, which he accepted. Starting at issue #200, the new &quot;Famous Monsters&quot; acquired subscribers and over-the-counter buyers who believed they would be reunited with Ackerman in print. While Ferry tried to maintain Ackerman&#x27;s style in his own writings, he heavily edited and rejected contributions from the man himself.

In an effort to help Ferry finance his full-time efforts on behalf of &quot;FM&quot;, Ackerman agreed to a reduced editor&#x27;s fee of $1,500 per issue. With four consecutive unpaid issues and a continued rejection of his work, Ackerman resigned from his position. Aside from removing Ackerman&#x27;s name from the masthead, Ferry did not inform &quot;FM&quot; readers that they were no longer reading material by, or authorized by, Ackerman. Instead, Ferry infused his writing with Ackerman&#x27;s trademark puns, and mimicked his writing style, which led to legal action brought forth by Ackerman.

====Libel lawsuit====
In 1997, Ackerman filed a civil lawsuit against Ferry for libel, breach of contract, and misrepresentation; Ferry had publicly claimed that Ackerman&#x27;s only connection with the new &quot;FM&quot; was as a hired hand and that Ferry “had to let Forry go” because he was no longer writing or editing for the magazine. Ferry also claimed rights to pen names and other personal properties of Ackerman. On May 11, 2000, the Los Angeles Superior Court jury decided in Ackerman&#x27;s favor and awarded him $382,500 in compensatory damages and $342,000 in punitive damages. This verdict was appealed by Ferry, but the verdict was upheld by the Appellate Court of California, on November 12, 2002. With judgments in Ackerman&#x27;s favor, Ferry filed for bankruptcy.

As of mid-2007, Ferry had been allowed to continue to publish issues of &quot;FM&quot; due to lack of efforts on the part of bankruptcy trustees and Ackerman&#x27;s lawyers to force the sale of the trademark or personal assets attached to his income. Ferry had also failed to pay any of the $720,000-plus cash judgment against him.

===2008 to present===
In late 2007, Philip Kim, an entrepreneur and a private equity investor, purchased the rights to the logo and title, entering into an agreement with Ackerman to use his trademarks to retain the magazine&#x27;s original look and feel. 
The new &quot;Famous Monsters of Filmland&quot; website was launched in May 2008 and on December 7, 2009, Kim announced the magazine&#x27;s return to print.

Ackerman died just before midnight on Thursday, December 4, 2008.

The revival of the classic horror magazine came in July 2010, with the publication of &quot;Famous Monsters of Filmland&quot; #251 at the Famous Monster Convention in Indianapolis, Indiana. The success of the print magazine at the Famous Monster Convention and Comic-Con International in San Diego yielded the announcement of the magazine&#x27;s expansion in distribution and circulation into major bookstore chains and independent retailers throughout North America and select markets in the US, Canada, and UK. Publisher Movieland Classics, LLC announced concurrently that the magazine would be entering into a bi-monthly publication schedule to meet the significant increase in requests from readers beginning with Issue 253.

Editors changed in quick succession until the promotion of Ed Blair in 2011. As executive editor of the magazine, Blair steered FM to success starting with Issue 256 in 2011 through issue 282 in 2015, when the torch of editorial leadership was handed over to David Weiner, a 13-year veteran of the syndicated television program Entertainment Tonight. Weiner held the position through Issue 288.

In 2011, the new magazine&#x27;s first Rondo Hatton Award (&quot;Best Interview of the Year&quot;) was awarded to &quot;A Talk with Haruo Nakajima&quot; conducted by author and Associate Editor August Ragone in Blair&#x27;s first issue (#256). More Rondos followed for cover art, interviews, and articles under Blair&#x27;s and later Weiner’s leadership. For &quot;Famous Monsters&quot;, Weiner also received a &quot;Best Interview of the Year&quot; for his interview with Mel Brooks for the 40th anniversary of &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot; in 2015. The magazine also won two consecutive &quot;Best Classic Magazine&quot; Rondos in 2015 and 2016. 

In 2015, &quot;Famous Monsters&quot; launched American Gothic Press, a comic book publishing imprint, marking their first foray into comics since Forrest Ackerman co-created Vampirella. 

In 2017, &quot;Famous Monsters&quot; transitioned to an annual print format with Issue 289, which saw longtime associate editor Holly Interlandi take the position of executive editor.

==Pop-culture connections==

In April 1981, the punk band The Misfits began using the magazine&#x27;s distinctive logo font on most albums, T-shirts, and other associated promotional materials. In 1999, The Misfits released an album named &quot;Famous Monsters&quot;.

In his 2000 non-fiction book &quot;On Writing&quot;, Stephen King describes his own history with Ackerman&#x27;s work and calls &quot;Famous Monsters of Filmland&quot; a life-changing publication, adding: &quot;Ask anyone who has been associated with the fantasy–horror–science fiction genres in the last thirty years about this magazine, and you’ll get a laugh, a flash of the eyes, and a stream of bright memories—I practically guarantee it.&quot;

&quot;Famous Monsters&quot; was mentioned by Billy Bob Thornton in an infamous 2009 interview with host Jian Ghomeshi on the CBC Radio One program &quot;Q&quot;. Thornton; upset by Ghomeshi&#x27;s mentioning his career in the film industry during the interview with The Boxmasters, he became non-responsive before relating a long story of how he read and entered a contest sponsored by FM when he was a boy.

&quot;The Sci-Fi Boys,&quot; a 2006 documentary by Paul Davids, focuses heavily on &quot;Famous Monsters&quot; and Forrest J Ackerman. The film features interviews with Ackerman and several of the current top names in the science fiction genre, including Peter Jackson and Rick Baker, who attest to the influence of the magazine and of Ackerman himself.

Writer and filmmaker Jason V. Brock created &quot;The Ackermonster Chronicles!&quot;, a 2012 documentary about Ackerman. The film has been shown at several venues (including a special screening at Loscon 39 in Los Angeles), and been critically well received in magazines such as &quot;Fangoria&quot;, &quot;Scary Monsters&quot;, and &quot;VideoScope&quot;. The movie is billed as the definitive film about Ackerman&#x27;s life and cultural influence, and features in-depth interviews with Ackerman, Ray Bradbury, John Landis, Greg Bear, Richard Matheson, Dan O&#x27;Bannon, Ray Harryhausen, David J. Skal, and others.

==Reception==
David Sanjek in &quot;Literature/Film Quarterly&quot; (1990) found that the magazine indulged in &quot;wearisome punning&quot; and that for all its good humor it was devoted to what James B. Twitchell described as &quot;artificial horror&quot;. Twitchell described the term as &quot;what an audience searches for in verbal or visual text when it wants a particular kind of frisson without much intellectual explanation or sophistication.&quot;

<text>Samuel Wesley (17 December 1662 – 25 April 1735) was a clergyman of the Church of England, a poet, and a writer. He was the father of John Wesley and Charles Wesley, the founders of Methodism.

==Family and early life==

Samuel Wesley was the second son of Rev. John Westley or Wesley, rector of Winterborne Whitechurch, Dorset. His mother was the daughter of John White, the rector of Trinity Church, Dorchester.
Following grammar school education in Dorchester, Wesley was sent away from home to prepare for ministerial training under Theophilus Gale. Gale&#x27;s death in 1678 forestalled this plan. Instead, he attended another grammar school. After that, he studied at dissenting academies under Edward Veel in Stepney and then Charles Morton in Newington Green, where Gale had lived. Daniel Defoe also attended Morton&#x27;s school. This school was situated &quot;probably on the site of the current Unitarian church&quot;, contemporaneously with Wesley. Samuel resigned his place and his annual scholarship among the Dissenters. After that, he walked all the way to Oxford, where he enrolled at Exeter College as a &quot;poor scholar&quot;. He functioned as a &quot;servitor&quot;, which means he sustained himself financially by waiting upon wealthy students. He also published a small book of poems, entitled &quot;Maggots: or Poems on Several Subjects never before Handled&quot; in 1685. The unusual title is explained in a few lines from the first page of the work:

Wesley married Susanna Annesley in 1688. He fathered, among others, Samuel (the younger), Mehetabel, John and Charles Wesley. He had 19 children, nine of whom died in infancy. Three boys and seven girls survived.

In 1688 he became curate at St. Botolph&#x27;s, Aldersgate, London, serving there for about one year. In 1689 he was made chaplain on a British Man-o-war. In 1690 he became curate at Newington Butts, Surrey. Then, in 1691 the rector of South Ormsby, Lincolnshire. By 1697 he was resident as rector of Epworth, Lincolnshire.

In 1697 he was appointed to the living at Epworth, Lincolnshire through the benevolence of Queen Mary. He may have come to the queen&#x27;s attention because of his heroic poem, &quot;The Life of Christ&quot; (1693). He dedicated this poem to her. Wesley&#x27;s high-church liturgies, academic proclivities, and loyalist Tory politics were a complete mismatch for some of his illiterate parishioners. He was not warmly received, and his ministry was not widely appreciated. Wesley was soon deep in debt and much of his life would be spent trying to make financial ends meet. In 1709 his parsonage was destroyed by fire, and his son John was barely rescued from the flames. The parsonage was rebuilt and is now known as the Old Rectory, Epworth.

==Career==
His poetic career began in 1685 with the publication of &quot;Maggots&quot;, a collection of juvenile verses on trivial subjects, the preface to which apologizes to the reader because the book is neither grave nor gay. The poems appear to be an attempt to prove that poetic language can create beauty out of the most revolting subject. The first poem, &quot;On a Maggot&quot;, is composed in hudibrastics, with a diction obviously Butlerian, and it is followed by facetious poetic dialogues and by Pindarics of the Cowleian sort but on such subjects as &quot;On the Grunting of a Hog&quot;. In 1688 Wesley took his B.A, at Exeter College, Oxford, following which he became a naval chaplain and, in 1690, rector of South Ormsby. In 1694 he took his MA from Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, and the following year he became rector of Epworth. During the run of the &quot;Athenian Gazette&quot; (1691–1697) he joined with Richard Sault and John Norris in assisting John Dunton, the promoter of the undertaking. His second venture in poetry, the &quot;Life of Our Blessed Lord and Saviour&quot;, an epic largely in heroic couplets with a prefatory discourse on heroic poetry, appeared in 1693, was reissued in 1694, and was honoured with a second edition in 1697. In 1695 he dutifully came forward with &quot;Elegies&quot;, lamenting the deaths of Queen Mary II and Archbishop Tillotson. &quot;An Epistle to a Friend concerning Poetry&quot; (1700) was followed by at least four other volumes of verse, the last of which was issued in 1717. His poetry appears to have had readers on a certain level, but it stirred up little pleasure among wits, writers, or critics. Judith Drake confessed that she was lulled to sleep by Blackmore&#x27;s &quot;Prince Arthur&quot; and by Wesley&#x27;s &quot;heroics&quot; (&quot;Essay in Defence of the Female Sex&quot;, 1696, p. 50). And he was satirized as a mere poetaster in Garth&#x27;s &quot;Dispensary&quot;, in Swift&#x27;s &quot;The Battle of the Books&quot;, and in the earliest issues of the &quot;Dunciad&quot;.

==Controversy==
For a few years in the early eighteenth century, Wesley found himself in the vortex of controversy. Brought up in the dissenting tradition, he had swerved into conformity at some point during the 1680s, possibly under the influence of Tillotson, whom he greatly admired (cf. &quot;Epistle to a Friend&quot;, pp. 5–6). In 1702 there appeared his &quot;Letter from a Country Divine to his friend in London concerning the education of dissenters in their private academies&quot;, apparently written about 1693. This attack upon dissenting academies was published at an unfortunate time, when the public mind was inflamed by the intolerance of overzealous churchmen. Wesley was furiously answered; he replied in &quot;A Defence of a Letter&quot; (1704), and again in &quot;A Reply to Mr. Palmer&#x27;s Vindication&quot; (1707). It is scarcely to Wesley&#x27;s credit that in this quarrel he stood shoulder to shoulder with that most hot-headed of all contemporary bigots, Henry Sacheverell. His prominence in the controversy earned him the ironic compliments of Daniel Defoe, who recalled that our &quot;Mighty Champion of this very High-Church Cause&quot; had once written a poem to satirize frenzied Tories (&quot;Review&quot;, II, no. 87, 22 September 1705). About a week later, Defoe, having got wind of a collection being taken up for Wesley – who in consequence of a series of misfortunes was badly in debt – intimated that High-Church pamphleteering had turned out very profitably for both Lesley and Wesley (2 October 1705). But in such snarling and bickering Wesley was out of his element, and he seems to have avoided future quarrels.

His literary criticism is small in bulk. But though it is neither brilliant nor well written (Wesley apparently composed at a break-neck clip), it is not without interest. Pope observed in 1730 that he was a &quot;learned&quot; man (letter to Swift, in &quot;Works&quot;, ed. Elwin-Courthope, VII, 184). The observation was correct, but it should be added that Wesley matured at the end of an age famous for its great learning, an age whose most distinguished poet was so much the scholar that he appeared more the pedant than the gentleman to critics of the succeeding era; Wesley was not singular for erudition among his seventeenth-century contemporaries.

===&quot;Essay on Heroic Poetry&quot;===

The &quot;Essay on Heroic Poetry&quot;, serving as Preface to &quot;The Life of Our Blessed Lord and Saviour&quot;, reveals something of its author&#x27;s erudition. Among the critics, he was familiar with Aristotle, Horace, Longinus, Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Heinsius, Bochart, Balzac, Rapin, Le Bossu, and Boileau. But this barely hints at the extent of his learning. In the notes on the poem itself the author displays an interest in classical scholarship, Biblical commentary, ecclesiastical history, scientific inquiry, linguistics and philology, British antiquities, and research into the history, customs, architecture, and geography of the Holy Land; he shows, an intimate acquaintance with Grotius, Henry Hammond, Joseph Mede, Spanheim, Sherlock, Lightfoot, and Gregory, with Philo, Josephus, Fuller, Walker, Camden, and Athanasius Kircher; and he shows an equal readiness to draw upon Ralph Cudworth&#x27;s &quot;True Intellectual System&quot; and Robert Boyle&#x27;s new theories concerning the nature of light. In view of such a breadth of knowledge it is somewhat surprising to find him quoting as extensively as he does in the &quot;Essay&quot; from Le Bossu and Rapin, and apparently leaning heavily upon them.

The &quot;Essay&quot; was composed at a time when the prestige of Rymer and neo-Aristotelianism in England was already declining, and though Wesley expressed some admiration for Rapin and Le Bossu, he is by no means docile under their authority. Whatever the weight of authority, he says, &quot;I see no cause why Poetry should not be brought to the Test [of reason], as well as Divinity...&quot; As to the sacred example of Homer, who based his great epic on mythology, Wesley remarks, &quot;But this [mythology] being now antiquated, I cannot think we are oblig&#x27;d superstitiously to follow his Example, any more than to make Horses speak, as he does that of Achilles.&quot; To the question of the formidable Boileau, &quot;What Pleasure can it be to hear the howlings of repining Lucifer?&quot; our critic responds flippantly, &quot;I think &#x27;tis easier to answer than to find out what shew of Reason he had for asking it, or why Lucifer mayn&#x27;t howl as pleasantly as either Cerberus, or Knoeladus.&quot; Without hesitation or apology he takes issue with Rapin&#x27;s conception of Decorum in the epic. But Wesley is empiricist as well as rationalist, and the judgment of authority can be upset by appeal to the court of experience. To Balzac&#x27;s suggestion that, to avoid difficult and local proper names in poetry, generalized terms be used, such as &quot;Ill-luck&quot; for the &quot;Fates&quot; and the &quot;Foul Fiend&quot; for &quot;Lucifer&quot;, our critic replies with jaunty irony, &quot;... and whether this wou&#x27;d not sound extremely Heroical, I leave any Man to judge&quot;, and thus he dismisses the matter. Similarly, when Rapin objects to Tasso&#x27;s mingling of lyric softness in the majesty of the epic, Wesley points out sharply that no man of taste will part with the fine scenes of tender love in Tasso, Dryden, Ovid, Ariosto, and Spenser &quot;for the sake of a fancied Regularity&quot;. He had set out to defend the Biblical epic, the Christian epic, and the propriety of Christian machines in epic, and no rules or authority could deter him. As good an example as any of his independence of mind can be seen in a note on Bk. I, apropos of the poet&#x27;s use of obsolete words (&quot;Life of Our Blessed Lord&quot;, 1697, p. 27): It may be in vicious imitation of Milton and Spenser, he says in effect, but I have a fondness for old words, they please my ear, and that is all the reason I can give for employing them.

Wesley&#x27;s resistance to a strict application of authority and the rules grew partly out of the rationalistic and empirical temper of Englishmen in his age, but it also sprang from his learning. From various sources he drew the theory that Greek and Latin were but corrupted forms of ancient Phoenician, and that the degeneracy of Greek and Latin in turn had produced all, or most, of the present European tongues (&quot;ibid.&quot;, p. 354). In addition, he believed that the Greeks had derived some of their thought from older civilizations, and specifically that Plato had received many of his notions from the Jews (&quot;ibid&quot;., p. 230)—an idea which recalls the argument that Dryden in &quot;Religio Laioi&quot; had employed against the deists, furthermore, he had, like many of his learned contemporaries, a profound respect for Hebrew culture and the sublimity of the Hebrew scriptures, going so far as to remark in the &quot;Essay on Heroic Poetry&quot; that &quot;most, even of [the heathen poets&#x27;] beat Fancies and Images, as well as Names, were borrow&#x27;d from the Antient Hebrew Poetry and Divinity.&quot; In short, however faulty his particular conclusions, he had arrived at an historical viewpoint, from which it was no longer possible to regard the classical standards—much less the standards of French critics—as having the holy sanction of Nature herself.

===Literary tastes===
Some light is shed on the literary tastes of his period by &quot;Epistle to a friend concerning poetry&quot; (1700) and the &quot;Essay on Heroic Poetry&quot; (1697), which with a few exceptions were in accord with the prevailing current. &quot;The Life of Our Blessed Lord&quot; shows strongly the influence of Cowley&#x27;s &quot;Davideis&quot;. Wesley&#x27;s great admiration persisted after the tide had turned away from Cowley; and his liking for the &quot;divine Herbert&quot; and for Crashaw represented the tastes of sober and unfashionable readers. Although he professed unbounded admiration for Homer as the greatest genius in nature, in practice he seemed more inclined to follow the lead of Cowley, Virgil, and Vida. Although there was much in Ariosto that he enjoyed, he preferred Tasso; the irregularities in both, however, he felt bound to deplore. To Spenser&#x27;s &quot;Faerie Queene&quot; he allowed extraordinary merit. If the plan of it was noble, he thought, and the mark of a comprehensive genius, yet the action of the poem seemed confused. Nevertheless, like Prior later, Wesley was inclined to suspend judgment on this point because the poem had been left incomplete. To Spenser&#x27;s &quot;thoughts&quot; he paid the highest tribute, and to his &quot;Expressions flowing natural and easie, with such a prodigious Poetical Copia as never any other must expect to enjoy.&quot; Like most of the Augustans Wesley did not care greatly for &quot;Paradise Regained&quot;, but he partly atoned by his praise for &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, which was an &quot;original&quot; and therefore &quot;above the common Rules&quot;. Though defective in its action, it was resplendent with sublime thoughts perhaps superior to any in Virgil or Homer, and full of incomparable and exquisitely moving passages. In spite of his belief that Milton&#x27;s blank verse was a mistake, making for looseness and incorrectness, he borrowed lines and images from it, and in Bk. IV of &quot;The Life of Our Blessed Lord&quot; he incorporated a whole passage of Milton&#x27;s blank verse in the midst of his heroic couplets.

Wesley&#x27;s attitude toward Dryden deserves a moment&#x27;s pause. In the &quot;Essay on Heroic Poetry&quot; he observed that a speech of Satan&#x27;s in &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; is nearly equalled in Dryden&#x27;s &quot;State of Innocence&quot;. Later in the same essay he credited a passage in Dryden&#x27;s &quot;King Arthur&quot; with showing an improvement upon Tasso. There is no doubt as to his vast respect for the greatest living poet, but his remarks do not indicate that he ranked Dryden with Virgil, Tasso, or Milton; for he recognized as well as we that the power to embellish and to imitate successfully does not constitute the highest excellence in poetry. In the &quot;Epistle to a Friend&quot; he affirmed his admiration for Dryden&#x27;s matchless style, his harmony, his lofty strains, his youthful fire, and even his wit—in the main, qualities of style and expression. But by 1700 Wesley had absorbed enough of the new puritanism that was rising in England to qualify his praise; now he deprecated the looseness and indecency of the poetry, and called upon the poet to repent. One other point calls for comment. Wesley&#x27;s scheme for Christian machinery in the epic, as described in the &quot;Essay on Heroic Poetry&quot;, is remarkably similar to Dryden&#x27;s. Dryden&#x27;s had appeared in the essay on satire prefaced to his translation of Juvenal, published late in October 1692; Wesley&#x27;s scheme appeared soon after June 1693.

The &quot;Epistle to a Friend concerning Poetry&quot; is neither startling nor contemptible; it has, in fact, much more to say than the rhymed treatises on verse by Roscommon and Mulgrave. Its remarks on Genius are fresh, though tantalizing in their brevity, and it defends the Moderns with both neatness and energy. Much of its advice is cautious and commonplace—but such was the tradition of the poetical treatise on verse. Appearing within two years of Collier&#x27;s first attack upon the stage, it reinforces some of that worthy&#x27;s contentions, but we are not aware of its having had much effect.

== Theology ==
Samuel Wesley held Anglican Arminianist views. The Arminian Hugo Grotius, was his favourite biblical commentator. Through his sermons, he demonstrated beliefs in the tenets of Arminianism and especially in its distinctive prevenient grace.

<text>Hegumen, hegumenos, or igumen (, trans. ), is the title for the head of a monastery in the Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic Churches, or an archpriest in the Coptic Orthodox Church, similar to the title of abbot. The head of a convent of nuns is called a hegumenia or igumeni (). The term means &quot;the one who is in charge&quot;, &quot;the leader&quot; in Greek.

==Overview==

Initially, the title was applied to the head of any monastery. After 1874, when the Russian monasteries were reformed and classified into three classes, the title of &quot;hegumen&quot; was reserved only for the lowest, third class. The head of a monastery of the second or first class holds the rank of archimandrite. In the Greek Catholic Church, the head of all monasteries in a certain territory is called the &quot;protohegumen&quot;.

The duties of both hegumen and archimandrite are the same, archimandrite being considered the senior dignity of the two. In the Russian Orthodox Church, the title of Hegumen may be granted as an honorary title to any hieromonk, even one who does not head a monastery.

A ruling hegumen is formally installed in a ceremony by the bishop, during which he is presented with his pastoral staff (Greek: &quot;paterissa&quot;, Slavonic: палица, &quot;palitza&quot;). Among the Russians, the pastoral staff for a Hegumen tends to be of wood (usually ebony), rather than metal. The hegumen is awarded the gold pectoral cross by the bishop, as for an archpriest. During divine services, the hegumen wears a simple black monastic mantle, while the higher ranking archimandrite wears a mantle similar to one worn by a bishop (though without the white &quot;rivers&quot; along the sides, and decorated with unadorned &quot;tablets&quot; at the neck and feet). An archimandrite also wears a mitre similar to one worn by a bishop; a hegumen does not (however, in the Russian tradition, a bishop may grant an hegumen the privilege of wearing the mitre as an ecclesiastical award). A hegumen may carry his pastoral staff in processions and when giving blessings in the church (though it is never carried into the sanctuary), although it usually stands upright next to his kathisma (monastic choir stall). When outside the church, a hegumen may use a wooden walking stick similar to that used by a bishop or archimandrite, only not adorned with a silver knob.

In the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, the rank is used in the capacity of an archpriest and actually is one. The name in the Arabic is &quot;kommos&quot; (قمص); this honorary title is granted to both married priests and hieromonks without distinction and is not used in the capacity of an Abbot, although the monasteries&#x27; abbots used to be Hegumen until the beginning of the 20th century, but by the mid century, the Church of Alexandria started to appoint Bishops in the capacity of Abbots. On the other hand, the rank of archimandrite fell into disuse in the Church of Alexandria from the late 16th century.

<text>Irene Roswitha Heim (born October 30, 1954) is a linguist and a leading specialist in semantics. She was a professor at the University of Texas at Austin and UCLA before moving to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1989, where she is Professor Emerita of Linguistics. She served as Head of the Linguistics Section of the Department of Linguistics and Philosophy.

==Biography==
Heim&#x27;s parents were German speakers born in Czechoslovakia, who had emigrated to Germany after World War II. She attended school in Munich, and studied at the University of Konstanz and the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, graduating from the latter in 1978 with an MA in Linguistics and Philosophy and a minor in mathematics. Following this, she studied for a PhD at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, completing her dissertation in 1982.

After short-term postdoctoral positions at Stanford University, MIT, the University of Texas at Austin (1983-1987), and UCLA, she took up a faculty position at MIT in 1987, receiving tenure as an associate professor in 1993 and becoming promoted to full professor in 1997.

==Research==
Heim&#x27;s 1982 dissertation &quot;The semantics of definite and indefinite noun phrases&quot; is considered a classic text and a major milestone in formal semantics. In the second chapter of the work she argued (developing an insight by the philosopher David Lewis) that indefinite noun phrases like &quot;a cat&quot; in the sentence &quot;If a cat is not in Athens, she is in Rhodes&quot; are not quantifiers but free variables bound by an existential operator inserted in the sentence by a semantic operation that she dubbed existential closure. In the third chapter of the work she developed a compositional dynamic theory of (in)definites. This work, along with Hans Kamp&#x27;s roughly contemporaneous &#x27;A Theory of Truth and Semantic Representation&#x27; (1981), became the founding work in the influential tradition of dynamic semantics and the first compositional dynamic fragment.

She is the co-author with Angelika Kratzer of &quot;Semantics in Generative Grammar&quot;, an influential textbook of formal semantics, and was a founding co-editor (also with Kratzer) of the journal &quot;Natural Language Semantics&quot;.

==Awards==

In 2010 Irene Heim was awarded a Senior Fellowship of the Zukunftskolleg at the University of Konstanz.

In 2012 she was inducted as a Fellow of the Linguistic Society of America.

In 2014 Heim was the recipient of a festschrift, &quot;The Art and Craft of Semantics&quot;.

In 2024 she was awarded the Rolf Schock Prize jointly with Hans Kamp.

<doc id="1334565" wikidata="Q7786276" url="?curid=1334565" title="This Sweet Sickness">
<text>This Sweet Sickness (1960) is a psychological thriller novel by Patricia Highsmith, about a man who is obsessed with a woman who has rejected his advances. It is a &quot;painful novel about obsessive imaginary love&quot;.

==Composition==
Highsmith dedicated the novel to her mother Mary: &quot;To my mother&quot;.

==Synopsis==
Scientist David Kelsey is infatuated with Annabelle, with whom he had a short relationship before moving away to take a job. David hopes the job will allow him to earn enough money to marry Annabelle. However, the two never actually discussed marriage and, while David is away, Annabelle marries another man named Gerald. Unable to accept the turn of events and move on, David begins laboring under the increasingly self-deluding hope that Annabelle will leave her new husband.

Under the assumed identity of William Neumeister, a freelance journalist who frequently travels, David buys a cabin in the country to serve as his eventual home with Annabelle. He furnishes the house to her liking and spends weekends there, performing household routines as if he is doing everything for two. David sends letters, visits Annabelle&#x27;s home and asks her to divorce Gerald even after she has had a son by him.

Eventually, Gerald discovers David&#x27;s house and arrives to confront the situation. The two men get into a scuffle which ends with Gerald falling and breaking his neck. David reports the death to the police, identifying himself as Neumeister and describing Gerald as a belligerent stranger who showed up at his door and, spoiling for a fight, was killed accidentally. 

Two of David&#x27;s friends, Wes Carmichael and Effie Brennan, once secretly followed him to the house and, after the death of Gerald, suspect him of a duality about which they question him over time and with escalating incisiveness. Effie, being in love with David and hoping he will ultimately give up on Annabelle, often supports him at key points during his attempts to maintain his two identities. 

David builds a web of lies, betrayal and denial. Annabelle wants to meet Neumeister in order to learn more about the circumstances of her husband&#x27;s death; David fends her off successfully. David secures a new job, sells his house, and buys a new one nearer to Annabelle under his own name. He repeats his intrusive behavior with her new beau, Grant. 

One weekend, David, who is beginning to occasionally lose touch with reality, invites Wes and Effie to visit in his new home. After some heavy drinking and quarreling, their relationships deteriorate rapidly, followed by more violence and David on the lam in New York City. There, he fantasizes that Annabelle is with him as they sight-see, shop and dine. When, in a restaurant, he is recognized as a wanted man, he imagines the two of them are fleeing together, but David&#x27;s time has run out.

==Reception==
Writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Anthony Boucher called the novel &quot;an impressive psychological study&quot;. He wrote:

==Adaptations==
&quot;This Sweet Sickness&quot; was adapted in 1962 for an episode of the anthology television series &quot;The Alfred Hitchcock Hour&quot;. The episode, titled &quot;Annabel,&quot; starred Dean Stockwell as David Kelsey. The novel was also the basis for the 1977 French-language film &quot;Dites-lui que je l&#x27;aime&quot; (&quot;Tell Her I Love Her&quot;), starring Gérard Depardieu as David, which Highsmith did not like.

Matt Damon, who starred in the 1999 film adaptation of Highsmith&#x27;s novel &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot;, expressed interest in writing &quot;a really strict adaptation&quot; of &quot;This Sweet Sickness&quot;.

<doc id="1334579" wikidata="Q917695" url="?curid=1334579" title="Sentinelese">
<text>The Sentinelese, also known as the Sentineli and the North Sentinel Islanders, are an indigenous people who inhabit North Sentinel Island in the Bay of Bengal in the northeastern Indian Ocean. Designated a particularly vulnerable tribal group and a Scheduled Tribe, they belong to the broader class of Andamanese peoples.

Along with the Great Andamanese, the Jarawas, the Onge, the Shompen, and the Nicobarese, the Sentinelese are one of the six native and often reclusive peoples of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The tribe has had minimal contact with outsiders and has usually been hostile to those who approach or land on the island. While friendly contact was reported in the early 1990s, such instances are rare.

In 1956, the government of India declared North Sentinel Island a tribal reserve and prohibited travel within of it. It further maintains a constant armed patrol in the surrounding waters to prevent intrusions by outsiders. Photography is prohibited. There is significant uncertainty as to the group&#x27;s size, with estimates ranging between 35 and 500 individuals, but mostly between 50 and 200.

== Overview ==
=== Geography ===
The Sentinelese live on North Sentinel Island, in the Andaman Islands, an Indian archipelago in the Bay of Bengal. The island lies about west of Andaman capital Port Blair. It has an area of about and a roughly square outline. The seashore is about wide encompassing a littoral forest that gives way to a dense tropical evergreen forest. The island is surrounded by coral reefs and has a tropical climate.

=== Appearance ===

A 1977 report by Heinrich Harrer described a man as tall, possibly because of insular dwarfism (the so-called &quot;Island Effect&quot;), nutrition, or simply genetic heritage. During a 2014 circumnavigation of their island, researchers put their height between and recorded their skin colour as &quot;dark, shining black&quot; with well-aligned teeth. They showed no signs of obesity and had very prominent muscles.

=== Population ===
No rigorous census has been conducted and the population has been variously estimated to be as low as 15 or as high as 500. Most estimates lie between 50 and 200.

The 1971 census estimated the population at around 82, and the 1981 census at 100. A 1986 expedition recorded the highest count, 98. In 2001, the census of India officially recorded 21 men and 18 women. This survey was conducted from a distance and may not have been accurate. 2004 post-tsunami expeditions recorded counts of 32 and 13 individuals in 2004 and 2005, respectively. The 2011 census of India recorded 12 males and three females. During a 2014 circumnavigation, researchers recorded six females, seven males (all apparently under 40 years old) and three children younger than four. A handbook released in 2016 by the Anthropological Survey of India on &quot;Vulnerable Tribe Groups&quot; estimates the population at between 100 and 150.

=== Practices ===
The Sentinelese are hunter-gatherers. They use spears with bows and arrows to hunt terrestrial wildlife and more rudimentary methods to catch local seafood, such as mud crabs and molluscan shells. They are believed to eat many molluscs, given the abundance of roasted shells found in their settlements. They are not known to engage in agriculture. Both sexes wear bark strings; the men tuck daggers into their waist belts. They also wear some ornaments such as necklaces and headbands, but are essentially nude. Usual habitations include small temporary huts erected on four poles with slanted leaf-covered roofs.

Sentinelese appreciate the value of metal, having scavenged it to create tools and weapons, and accepted aluminum cookware left by the National Geographic Society in 1974. There is no evidence of them having knowledge of metallurgy outside of cold forging to make tools such as arrow heads, though the Andamanese scholar Vishvajit Pandya notes that Onge narratives often recall voyages by their ancestors to North Sentinel to procure metal. Canoes are used for lagoon-fishing, but long poles rather than paddles or oars propel them. They seldom use the canoes for cross-island navigation. Artistic engravings of simple geometric designs and shade contrasts have been seen on their weapons. The women have been seen to dance by slapping both palms on the thighs whilst simultaneously tapping the feet rhythmically in a bent-knee stance.

Similarities and dissimilarities to the Onge people have been noted. They prepare their food similarly. They share common traits in body decoration and material culture. There are also similarities in the design of their canoes; of all the Andamanese tribes, only the Sentinelese and Onge make canoes. Similarities with the Jarawas have been also noted: their bows have similar patterns. No such marks are found on Onge bows, and both tribes sleep on the ground, while the Onge sleep on raised platforms. The metal arrowheads and adze blades are quite large and heavier than those of other Andamanese tribes.

=== Language ===

Because of their complete isolation, nearly nothing is known about the Sentinelese language, which is therefore unclassified. It has been recorded that the Jarawa language is mutually unintelligible with the Sentinelese language. The range of overlap with the Onge language is unknown; the Anthropological Survey of India&#x27;s 2016 handbook on Vulnerable Tribe Groups considers them mutually unintelligible.

=== Isolation and uncontacted status ===
In 1957, the Indian government declared North Sentinel Island a tribal reserve and prohibited travel within . Photography was prohibited. A constant armed patrol prevents intrusions by outsiders.

The Sentinelese are a community of indigenous peoples in voluntary isolation. Designated a particularly vulnerable tribal group and a Scheduled Tribe, they belong to the broader class of Andamanese people.

Along with the Great Andamanese, the Jarawas, the Onge, the Shompen, and the Nicobarese, the Sentinelese are one of the six native and often reclusive peoples of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Unlike the others, the Sentinelese appear to have consistently refused any interaction with the outside world. They are hostile to outsiders and have killed people who approached or landed on the island.

== History of contacts ==

The first peaceful contact with the Sentinelese was made by Triloknath Pandit, a director of the Anthropological Survey of India, and his colleagues, on 4 January 1991. Later, contact was made by Madhumala Chattopadhyay. Indian visits to the island ceased in 1997. An American, John Allen Chau, was killed in 2018 while visiting the island illegally as a Christian missionary.

=== Colonial period ===
In 1771, an East India Company hydrographic survey vessel, the &quot;Diligent&quot;, observed &quot;a multitude of lights[...] upon the shore&quot; of North Sentinel Island, which is the island&#x27;s first recorded mention. The crew did not investigate.

During a late summer monsoon in October 1867, the Indian merchant-vessel &quot;Nineveh&quot; foundered on the reef off North Sentinel. All the passengers and crew reached the beach safely, but as they proceeded for their breakfast on the third day, they were subject to a sudden assault by a group of naked, short-haired, red-painted islanders with arrows that were probably iron-tipped. The captain, who fled in the ship&#x27;s boat, was found days later by a brig and the Royal Navy sent a rescue party to the island. Upon arrival, the party discovered that the survivors had managed to repel the attackers with sticks and stones and that they had not reappeared.

The first recorded visit to the island by a colonial officer was by Jeremiah Homfray in 1867. He recorded seeing naked islanders catching fish with bows and arrows, and was informed by the Great Andamanese that they were Jarawas.

In 1880, in an effort to establish contact with the Sentinelese, the Royal Navy officer Maurice Vidal Portman, who was serving as a colonial administrator to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, led an armed group of Europeans along with convict-orderlies and Andamanese trackers (whom they had already befriended) to North Sentinel Island. On their arrival, the islanders fled into the treeline. After several days of futile search, during which they found abandoned villages and paths, Portman&#x27;s men captured six people: an elderly man, a woman and four children. The man and woman died of illness shortly after their arrival in Port Blair and the children began to fall ill as well. Portman hurriedly sent the children back to North Sentinel Island with a large quantity of gifts in an attempt to establish friendly relations. Portman visited the island again in 1883, 1885 and 1887.

In 1896, a convict escaped from the penal colony on Great Andaman Island on a makeshift raft and drifted across to the North Sentinel beach. His body was discovered by a search party some days later with several arrow-piercings and a cut throat. The party recorded that they did not see any islanders.

In an 1899 speech, Richard Carnac Temple, who was chief commissioner of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands from 1895 to 1904, reported that he had toured North Sentinel island to capture fugitives, but upon landing discovered that they had been killed by the inhabitants, who retreated in haste upon seeing his party approach. Temple also recorded a case where a Sentinelese apparently drifted off to the Onge and fraternized with them over the course of two years. When Temple and Portman accompanied him to the tribe and attempted to establish friendly contact, they did not recognize him and responded aggressively by shooting arrows at the group. The man refused to remain on the island. Portman cast doubt on the exact timespan the Sentinelese spent with the Onge, and believed that he had probably been raised by the Onge since childhood. Temple concluded the Sentinelese were &quot;a tribe which slays every stranger, however inoffensive, on sight, whether a forgotten member of itself, of another Andamanese tribe, or a complete foreigner&quot;.

Other British colonial administrators visited the island, including Rogers in 1902, but none of the expeditions after 1880 had any ethnographic purpose, probably because of the island&#x27;s small size and unfavourable location. M.C.C. Bonnington, a British colonial official, visited the island in 1911 and 1932 to conduct a census. On the first occasion, he came across eight men on the beach and another five in two canoes, who retreated into the forest. The party progressed some miles into the island without facing any hostile response and saw a few huts with slanted roofs. Eventually, failing to find anyone, Bonnington and his men left the island. Notably, the Sentinelese were counted as a standalone group for the first time in the 1911 census.

In 1954, the Italian explorer Lidio Cipriani visited the island but did not encounter any inhabitants.

=== T. N. Pandit (1967–1991) ===
In 1967, a group of 20 people, comprising the governor, armed forces and naval personnel, were led by T. N. Pandit, an Indian anthropologist working for the Anthropological Survey of India, to North Sentinel Island to explore it and befriend the Sentinelese. This was the first visit to the island by a professional anthropologist. Through binoculars, the group saw several clusters of Sentinelese along the coastline who retreated into the forest as the team advanced. The team followed their footprints and after about , found a group of 18 lean-to huts made from grass and leaves that showed signs of recent occupation as evidenced by the still-burning fires at the corners of the hut. The team also discovered raw honey, skeletal remains of pigs, wild fruits, an adze, a multi-pronged wooden spear, bows, arrows, cane baskets, fishing nets, bamboo pots and wooden buckets. Metal-working was evident. The team failed to establish any contact and withdrew after leaving gifts.

The government was aware that leaving the Sentinelese (and the area) completely isolated and ceasing to claim any control would lead to rampant illegal exploitation of the natural resources by the numerous mercenary outlaws who took refuge in those regions, and probably contribute to the Sentineleses&#x27; extinction. Accordingly, in 1970, an official surveying party landed at an isolated spot on the island and erected a stone tablet, atop a disused native hearth, that declared the island part of India.

In early 1974, a &quot;National Geographic&quot; film crew went to the island with a team of anthropologists (including Pandit), accompanied by armed police, to film a documentary, &quot;Man in Search of Man&quot;. They planned to spread the operation of gift-giving over three days and attempt to establish friendly contact. When the motorboat broke through the barrier reefs, the locals emerged from the jungle and shot arrows at it. The crew landed at a safe point on the coast and left gifts in the sand, including a miniature plastic car, some coconuts, a live pig, a doll and aluminium cookware. The Sentinelese followed up by launching another volley of arrows, one of which struck the documentary director in his thigh. The man who wounded the director withdrew to the shade of a tree and laughed proudly while others speared and buried the pig and the doll. They left afterward, taking the coconuts and cookware. This expedition also led to the first photograph of the Sentinelese, published by Raghubir Singh in &quot;National Geographic&quot; magazine, where they were presented as people for whom &quot;arrows speak louder than words&quot;.

During the 1970s and 1980s, Pandit undertook several visits to the island, sometimes as an &quot;expert advisor&quot; in tour parties including dignitaries who wished to encounter an aboriginal tribe. Beginning in 1981, he regularly led official expeditions with the purpose of establishing friendly contact. Many of these got a friendly reception, with hoards of gifts left for them, but some ended in violent encounters, which were mostly suppressed. Some of the expeditions (1987, 1992, et al.) were entirely documented on film. Sometimes the Sentinelese waved and sometimes they turned their backs and assumed a &quot;defecating&quot; posture, which Pandit took as a sign of their not being welcome. On some occasions, they rushed out of the jungle to take the gifts but then attacked the party with arrows. Other gestures in response to contact parties, such as swaying of penises, have been noted. On some of his visits, Pandit brought some Onge to the island to try to communicate with the Sentinelese, but the attempts were usually futile and Pandit reported one instance of angering the Sentinelese.

=== Wreck of the &quot;Rusley&quot; ===
In 1977, the &quot;Rusley&quot; ran aground off the north coast of North Sentinel Island.

=== 1981 wreck of &quot;MV Primrose&quot; ===
On 2 August 1981, the MV &quot;Primrose&quot;, carrying a bulk cargo of chicken feed from Bangladesh to Australia, ran aground in rough seas just off North Sentinel Island, stranding a small crew. After a few days, the captain dispatched a distress call asking for a drop of firearms and reported boats being prepared by more than 50 armed islanders intending to board the ship. Strong waves prevented the Sentinelese canoes from reaching the ship and deflected their arrows. The crew of 31 men were keeping a twenty-four-hour guard with axes, pipes, and flare guns. Nearly a week later, the crew was evacuated by a civilian helicopter contracted to the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) with support from Indian naval forces.

The Sentinelese scoured the abandoned shipwrecks to salvage iron for their weaponry. M. A. Mohammad, a scrap dealer who won a government contract to dismantle the &quot;Primrose&quot; wreck (about from the shoreline) and assembled men for the purpose, recorded friendly exchange of fruits and small metal scraps with the Sentinelese, who often canoed to the workplace at low tide:

=== 1991 expedition ===
In 1991, the first instances of peaceful contact were recorded in the course of two routine expeditions by an Indian anthropological team consisting of various representatives of diverse governmental departments, including the anthropologist Madhumala Chattopadhyay. This was the first time a woman was a part of a contact expedition with the Sentinelese.

During a 4 January 1991 visit, the Sentinelese approached the party without weaponry for the first time. They collected coconuts that were offered but retreated to the shore as the team gestured for them to come closer. The team returned to the main ship, MV &quot;Tarmugli&quot;. It returned to the island in the afternoon to find at least two dozen Sentinelese on the shoreline, one of whom pointed a bow and arrow at the party. Once a woman pushed the arrow down, the man buried his weapons in the sand and the Sentinelese approached quite close to the dinghies for the first time. The Director of Tribal Welfare distributed five bags of coconuts hand-to-hand.

Pandya comments:

Pandit and Madhumala took part in a second expedition on 24 February. The Sentinelese again appeared without weapons, jumped on the dinghies and took coconut sacks. They were also curious about a rifle hidden in the boat, which Chattopadhyay believed they saw as a source of iron.

In light of the friendly exchanges with the scrap dealers&#x27; team and Portman&#x27;s observations in 1880, Pandya believes that the Sentinelese used to be visited by other tribes.

=== Later expeditions ===
The series of contact expeditions continued until 1994, with some of them even attempting to plant coconut trees on the island. The programmes were then abandoned for nearly nine years. The Indian government maintained a policy of no deliberate contact, intervening only in cases of natural calamities that might pose an existential threat or to thwart poachers.

A likely reason for the termination of these missions was that the Sentinelese did not let most of the post-Pandit contact teams get near them. The teams usually waited until the armed Sentinelese retreated, then left gifts on the beach or set them adrift toward shore. The government was also concerned about the possibility of harm to the Sentinelese by an influx of outsiders, a result of them projecting a relatively friendly image. Photos of the 1991 expedition were removed from public display and use of them was restricted by the government.

The next expedition was in April 2003, when a canoe built by the Onges was given to the visitors.

=== 2004 tsunami ===
Further expeditions (some aerial) in 2004 and 2005 evaluated the effects of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, which caused massive tectonic changes to the island: it was enlarged by a merger with nearby small islands, and the sea floor was raised by about , exposing the surrounding coral reefs to air and destroying the shallow lagoons, which were the Sentinelese&#x27;s fishing grounds. The expeditions counted 32 Sentinelese scattered over three places but did not find any bodies. The Sentinelese responded to these aerial expeditions with hostile gestures, which led many to conclude that the community was mostly unaffected and had survived the calamity. Pandya argues that Sentinelese hostility is a sign of the physical as well as the cultural resilience of the community.

The Sentinelese generally received the post-tsunami expeditions in a friendly manner. They approached the visiting parties unarmed, in contrast to the arms or shields carried when meeting earlier expeditions.

=== 2006 killing of fishermen ===
On 27 January 2006, Indian fishermen Sunder Raj and Pandit Tiwari, who had been attempting to illegally harvest crabs off North Sentinel Island, drifted towards the island after their boat&#x27;s makeshift anchor failed during the night. They did not respond to warning calls from passing fishermen, and their boat drifted into the shallows near the island, where a group of Sentinelese tribals attacked it and killed the fishermen with axes. According to one report, the bodies were later put on bamboo stakes facing out to sea like scarecrows. Three days later, an Indian Coast Guard helicopter, dispatched for the purpose, found the buried bodies. When the helicopter tried to retrieve them, the Sentinelese attacked it with arrows, and according to some sources with spears, and the mission was soon abandoned. There were contrasting views in the local community as to whether the Sentinelese ought to be prosecuted for the murder.

Pandya hypothesizes that the aggressive response might have been caused by the sudden withdrawal of those gift-carrying expeditions, which was not influenced or informed by any acts of the Sentinelese. He also notes that while the images of the hostile Sentinelese the helicopter sorties captured were heavily propagated in the media, the images of them burying the dead were never released. This selective display effectively negated the friendly images that circulated in the aftermath of the 1991 contact, which had already been taken out of public display, and restored the 1975 &quot;National Geographic&quot; narrative.

=== 2018 killing of missionary ===
In November 2018, John Allen Chau, a 26-year-old American trained and sent by the US-based Christian missionary organization All Nations, travelled to North Sentinel Island with the aim of contacting and living among the Sentinelese in the hope of converting them to Christianity. He did not seek the necessary permits required to visit the island.

On 15 November, Chau paid local fishermen to take him to a point from the island&#x27;s shore, then continued to the island in a kayak. As he approached, he attempted to communicate with the islanders and offer gifts, but retreated after facing hostile responses. On another visit, Chau recorded that the islanders reacted to him with a mixture of amusement, bewilderment, and hostility. He attempted to sing worship songs to them, and spoke to them in Xhosa, after which they often fell silent, while other attempts to communicate ended with them bursting into laughter. Chau said the Sentinelese communicated with &quot;lots of high pitched sounds&quot; and gestures. Eventually, according to Chau&#x27;s last letter, when he tried to hand over fish and gifts, a boy shot a metal-headed arrow that pierced the Bible he was holding in front of his chest, after which he retreated again.

On his final visit, on 17 November, Chau instructed the fishermen to leave without him. The fishermen later saw the islanders dragging Chau&#x27;s body, and the next day they saw his body on the shore.

Police subsequently arrested seven fishermen for assisting Chau to get close to the island. Local authorities opened a murder case naming &quot;unknown individuals&quot;, but there was no suggestion that the Sentinelese would be charged and the U.S. government confirmed that it did not ask the Indian government to press charges against the tribe. Indian officials made several attempts to recover Chau&#x27;s body but eventually abandoned those efforts. An anthropologist involved in the case told &quot;The Guardian&quot; that the risk of a dangerous clash between investigators and the islanders was too great to justify any further attempts.

<text>The first USS &quot;Jarvis&quot; (DD-38) was a modified in the United States Navy during World War I. She was named for James C. Jarvis.

&quot;Jarvis&quot; was laid down by the New York Shipbuilding Company, Camden, New Jersey on 1 July 1911; launched on 4 April 1912; sponsored by Mrs. Jean King; and commissioned on 22 October 1912.

==Pre-World War I==
Following shakedown off Cuba, &quot;Jarvis&quot; spent a year operating out of Norfolk, Virginia in the Caribbean. She departed Pensacola, Florida on 20 April 1914 for patrols off Tampico and Veracruz, Mexico, during the US occupation of Veracruz. Returning to Norfolk on 16 June, she operated in the Atlantic until departing New York on 26 May 1917 to join US Naval Forces operating in European waters under Vice Admiral William Sims.

==World War I==
Arriving in Queenstown, Ireland, via St. Nazaire, France on 11 June, she commenced patrol and escort duty along the Irish and English coasts. The operations of destroyers such as &quot;Jarvis&quot; were of immense value to the Allies in overcoming the German U-boat menace. While not credited with sinking any U-boats, on two occasions &quot;Jarvis&quot; rescued crews of ships torpedoed by enemy submarines. On 19 June she rescued 41 survivors of SS &quot;Batoum&quot; off the Irish coast, and she pulled 22 survivors of the British merchantman &quot;Purley&quot; from the North Sea on 25 July. After recovering &quot;Batoum&quot;″s survivors, she braved a possible torpedo attack and positioned herself between SS &quot;Mechanician&quot; and a U-boat to protect the merchant ship from enemy torpedoes.

&quot;Jarvis&quot; operated out of Queenstown until 15 February 1918, when she sailed to Brest, France to guard Allied shipping along the French coast. She patrolled out of Brest until 28 December; then she sailed for the United States. Arriving at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on 12 January 1919, she resumed operations along the Atlantic Coast. &quot;Jarvis&quot; returned to Philadelphia on 21 July and decommissioned on 26 November. To comply with the terms of the London Naval Treaty, she was scrapped and her materials sold on 23 April 1935.

<text>Gytheio ( ) or Gythio, also the ancient Gythium or Gytheion (), is a town on the eastern shore of the Mani Peninsula, and a former municipality in Laconia, Peloponnese, Greece. Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality East Mani, of which it is a municipal unit. The municipal unit has an area of 197.313 km2. 

Gytheio was the seaport of Ancient Sparta, which lies approximately north of it. It is the site of ancient Cranae, a tiny island where, according to the myth, Paris and Helen spent their first night together before departing for Troy.

Gytheio used to be an important port until it was destroyed in 4th century AD, possibly by an earthquake, though its strategic location continued to give it a significant role in Maniot history. Now the seat of the municipality of East Mani, Gytheio is the largest and most important town in Mani. 
== Historical population ==

== Geography ==
Gytheio is located in the northeastern corner of the Mani Peninsula and lies on the northwestern end of the Laconian Gulf. Gytheio was built on a hill called Koumaros or Laryssio in one of the most fertile areas in Mani, near the mouth of the Gythium River, which is usually dry and has been nicknamed &quot;Xerias&quot; &quot;dry river&quot;; today, most of the Xerias is covered by Ermou Avenue.

Directly north and visible from the harbor is Profitis Ilias, the ultra-prominent peak of Taygetus, the mountain range whose spine juts southward into the Mediterranean Sea and forms the Mani Peninsula.

On the ridgeline running south from Profitis Ilias sits the Monastery of Panayia Yiatrissa overlooking the valley toward Gytheio; the E4 hiking path connects the three, running south from Profitis Ilias, passing by the monastery, and leading to Gytheio.

Northeast of Gytheio is the delta of the Evrotas River. Offshore are several small islands; the most important of these islands is Cranae, on which sits the Tzannetakis Tower (now the Historical and Cultural museum of Mani) and a lighthouse built of solid marble. Today Cranae is connected to the mainland by a causeway.

Approximately 5 km (3 mi) southwest is a passageway to the deeper Mani, historically guarded by Castle Passavas (now in ruins), which towers over the site of ancient Las. Further west is the historic city of Areopoli and the Caves of Diros, which are important tourist attractions.

Gytheio is only southeast of Sparti, connected by Greek National Road 39. The town center is situated around the port. Pine trees are situated in the west and rocky mountains in the north.

== History ==



The reputed founders of ancient Gythium were Heracles and Apollo, who frequently appear on its coins or in other legends, and Castor and Pollux: the former of these names may point to the influence of Phoenician traders from Tyre, who, we know, visited the Laconian shores at a very early period. It is thought that Gytheio may have been the center of their purple dye trade because the Laconian Gulf had a plentiful source of murex. In classical times it was a community of &quot;Perioeci&quot;, politically dependent on Sparta, though doubtless with a municipal life of its own.

In 455 BC, during the First Peloponnesian War, it was burned by the Athenian admiral Tolmides who besieged the city with 50 ships and 4,000 hoplites. It was rebuilt and was most probably the building ground for the Spartan fleet in the Peloponnesian War. In 407 BC during the Peloponnesian War, Alcibiades landed there and saw the thirty triremes the Spartans were building. In 370 BC, the Thebans under the command of Epaminondas besieged the city successfully for three days after ravaging Laconia, but it was recaptured by the Spartans three days later.

In 219 BC, Philip V of Macedon unsuccessfully attempted to capture the city. Under Nabis, Gythium became a major naval arsenal and port. During the Roman-Spartan War, Gythium was captured after a lengthy siege. After the war finished, Gythium was made part of the Union of Free Laconians under Achean protection. Nabis recaptured Gythium three years and the Spartan fleet defeated the Achean fleet outside of Gythium. Gythium was liberated by a Roman fleet under the command of Aulus Atilius Serranus.

Subsequently, Gythium formed the most important of the Union of Free Laconians, a group of twenty-four, later eighteen, communities leagued together to maintain their autonomy against Sparta and declared free by Caesar Augustus. The highest officer of the confederacy was the general, who was assisted by a treasurer (&quot;rauias&quot;), while the chief magistrates of the several communities bore the title of &quot;ephors&quot;.

In Roman times Gythium remained a major port and it prospered as a member of the Union. As purple dye was popular in Rome, Gythium exported that as well as porphyry and rose antique marble. Evidence of the ancient Gythium prosperity can be found by the fact that the Romans built an ancient theatre which is well preserved today and is still used occasionally. The ancient theatre and the city&#x27;s Acropolis (west of the theatre) were discovered by the archeologist Dimitris Skias in 1891. Some time in the 4th century AD, the city was destroyed. What happened to Gythium is not recorded but it is thought to have been either sacked by Alaric and the Visigoths, pillaged by the Slavs or destroyed by the massive earthquake that struck the area in 375 AD.

After the earthquake Gythium was abandoned. It remained a small village throughout the Byzantine and Ottoman times. Its importance grew when Tzannetos Grigorakis built his tower at Cranae and more people came and settled at Gytheio. During the Greek War of Independence, refugees flooded into Mani and made Gytheio a major town.

The modern Gytheio opened a port in the 1960s. Ferries sail from Gytheio to Kythira almost daily and also to Crete twice a week. It is the See of the Diocese of Gytheion and Oitylo, headed by a Metropolitan bishop of the Orthodox Church of Greece. Gytheio is the largest and most important town in Mani. Most of the ruins of ancient Gythium are now submerged in the Laconian Gulf. 
Some walls&#x27; remains can be seen today on the sandy beach of Valtaki and in the shallow waters, where the well known Dimitrios shipwreck lies stranded. It is also the capital of the municipality of Gytheio.

==Province==
The province of Gytheio () was one of the provinces of the Laconia Prefecture. Its territory corresponded with that of the current municipal units Gytheio and East Mani. It was abolished in 2006.

By the game&#x27;s end, it is revealed she is the Sith Lord Darth Traya and is planning on destroying the Force, and she becomes the final boss of &quot;The Sith Lords&quot;. Kreia makes no more appearances in &quot;Star Wars&quot; fiction, though a miniature by Wizards of the Coast was released in August 2008, and she appears as an obtainable character in &quot;Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes&quot;.

Written by Chris Avellone, the character was created as a sounding board for the game&#x27;s theme of the role of the Jedi and the nature of the Force, and was heavily influenced by &quot;&quot;″s Ravel Puzzlewell. She served both to test the player and to act as a mouthpiece for any questions Avellone thought should be asked about the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe. Sara Kestelman voiced the character, with Kreia&#x27;s casting being considered the most important of all the characters. Her name references Princess Leia of the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy, while her character design draws both on Palpatine&#x27;s hood and Obi-Wan Kenobi&#x27;s robes.

She was positively received, and is often pointed to as the highlight of &quot;The Sith Lords&quot;. Praise went to the questions and dialogue she provided, as well as her voice acting. The character has appeared in numerous &quot;top lists&quot;, often commending her as a &quot;Star Wars&quot; character. Attention was drawn to one moment where Kreia lectures about the dangers of charity. Despite this, Avellone felt he failed in creating a &quot;sympathetic&quot; Sith Lord, though he has called her one of his favorite characters in the game.

==Conception and creation==
The first draft of the game placed a figurehead similar to Kreia as the leader of matriarchs ruling the Handmaiden&#x27;s world, which the player was sent to free. This draft was made before Obsidian had played the first game, and after they had played it the draft was discarded. However, some of Kreia&#x27;s characteristics were salvaged, though little else was.

In the game proper, Kreia was written by Chris Avellone, who was also lead designer of &quot;The Sith Lords&quot; and created most of the party. Avellone was initially unsure about working on &quot;Star Wars&quot; but after beginning became more &quot;excited&quot; about it. Avellone decided to attempt to create a sympathetic Sith Lord. The character was highly influenced by Ravel Puzzlewell, a &quot;&quot; character which Avellone also wrote, and was intended to tell stories with her he had been unable to do in &quot;Torment&quot;. Avellone felt it would be &quot;cool&quot; to be in a party with Ravel. Despite Ravel&#x27;s influence, the &quot;Star Wars&quot; setting and its elements resulted in Kreia changing heavily.

A multi-page biography was created for narrative reference, art and audio. When making characters, Avellone prefers to focus on their role in the story, their name, their visual signature (discussed with the concept artist), and in Kreia&#x27;s case the character&#x27;s ability to serve as his voice. Her name is inspired by Princess Leia of the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; films, and serves a similar role as ally, but Kreia has darker past demonstrated by a harsher prefix. Her visuals, meanwhile, combine elements of both &quot;the wise mentor&quot; like Obi-Wan&#x27;s robes and dark side elements like Palpatine&#x27;s hood. Brian Menze, lead concept artist and modeller for the characters, designed Kreia.

Narratively, Kreia had several roles in &quot;The Sith Lords&quot;, acting as a party member, a foil, and a &quot;sounding board&quot; for the theme of the game, which concerned the Jedi&#x27;s role and the Force&#x27;s nature in a living galaxy. As an extension of Avellone&#x27;s voice, Kreia became his way of expressing all his problems with the Force. Despite her view of the Force, it was important to avoid causing continuity problems with the rest of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; series, and her views were presented within the context of the original Force in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; world. Kreia is intended to test the player on the basic philosophical issues of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe. She is rude and dismissive to everyone but the player character, something intended to help make the player feel special.
English actress Sara Kestelman voiced the character in the game. In voice directors Will Beckman and Darragh O&#x27;Farrell&#x27;s &quot;Designer Diary&quot;, the character was considered the most critical character to cast, though a challenging one as few games cast women of her age group. Obsidian worked hard in finding Kreia&#x27;s voice, which had to match with her model without being &quot;witchy or grating&quot; due to her lengthy amount of dialogue.

Developers tried to give each companion a unique ability to make them distinct from any other companion. Originally, throughout &quot;The Sith Lords&quot; Kreia would be seen through cutscenes recruiting certain characters such as Hanharr to side with her and seducing them to the dark side, though her exact purpose was not made overt. At the end of the game, they would then be used as &quot;cannon fodder&quot; before the fight with her began. Ultimately, this was cut.

===Character===
Kreia is shown as an elderly blind woman, whose eyes have atrophied from lack of use in preference of viewing things through the Force, viewing normal sight as a distraction. Dialogue in &quot;The Sith Lords&quot; establishes her past as a Jedi historian and one of the teachers of Revan, who became a Sith Lord and was the player character of the first game, and how her teachings were blamed for his fall. &quot;The Sith Lords&quot; reveals she has trained two Sith antagonists of the game, Darth Sion and Darth Nihilus, before they cast her out. She is initially depicted in earth-brown hooded Jedi robes with empty white eyes, though after the revelation of her identity as Darth Traya, both a Sith and a being of betrayal, both her robes and eyes are changed to black, and her skin becomes paler.
Kreia was the personification of Avellone&#x27;s frustrations with the concept of the Force. He called her &quot;one redeeming feature&quot; her love of the player character, and what they represent: a way of destroying the Force and its predestination in favor of giving freedom to the galaxy. She shuns the light-side and the dark-side divide of the Force, as well as blanket good and evil, favoring choices that emphasise personal strength for the player. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;″s Julie Muncy described her philosophy as &quot;a pessimistic and borderline-Randian way of thinking focused on the importance of power and strife&quot;.

She is initially presented as an ally and a teacher, and acts a mentor from the start of the game. Alexander Gambotto-Burke of &quot;Eurogamer&quot; commented that she has a &quot;genuine, albeit twisted maternal&quot; love for the player, her student. In contrast to Darth Malak, the clear villain of the first game, Avellone called Kreia neither &quot;necessarily good or evil&quot;; instead, she merely wants the Exile to grow as a person. Kreia is deliberately complicated in her goals and motivations, giving the character a feel of mystery. IGN&#x27;s Hilary Goldstein noted this mystery, commenting both on her seemingly dark motives and yet how she appears as the player&#x27;s &quot;staunchest defender and a true protector&quot;.

==Appearances==
===In &quot;The Sith Lords&quot;===

The game was first released in December 2004, on Xbox, marking the character&#x27;s debut. Kreia initially seems dead when introduced, but after the player character, an exile of the Jedi Order, enters the morgue of the mining station they&#x27;ve woken in, she begins conversation. She informs the player that while they slept they both formed a Force bond, tying the Exile and Kreia together. It is revealed that Kreia and the Exile both came in aboard the Ebon Hawk after the Exile&#x27;s original ship was attacked by the Sith and the Exile rescued while unconscious. During their escape, Kreia encounters Darth Sion and loses her hand during the battle, which in turn causes the Exile tremendous pain due to their bond. After she rejoins the party and they escape the station on the Ebon Hawk, Kreia then appoints herself the Exile&#x27;s &quot;teacher&quot;.

Kreia serves as a party member throughout the game, and may interject at certain points of it to offer her perspective. Depending on each decision the player makes, Kreia may gain or lose &quot;Influence&quot;, which measures how much &quot;trust, confidence, or control&quot; the player has with a party member. Unlike other party members, Kreia&#x27;s alignment is not affected by the player&#x27;s Influence level with her and is instead set at neutral, though Influence will unlock new conversations with her. In gameplay, she may only equip one hand, and is a &quot;Jedi Consular&quot;, focused on using the game&#x27;s Force powers. Having her in the party grants the player extra experience, and any Force effects the player character or Kreia use on themselves will also affect the other.

After the player finds all the in-hiding Jedi Masters, Kreia will retake her mantle as a Sith Lord. If the player does not kill the Jedi, she will intervene when they attempt to cut the Exile off from the Force, draining the Jedi of the Force herself and killing them. If the player chooses to kill the Jedi, she will renounce the Exile. Either way, she will leave, and the player must hunt her to Malachor V, the site of such great atrocities and death that they caused a wound in the Force. Kreia seemingly plans on creating another wound in the Force there, deafening all to the Force and causing its &quot;death&quot;, as well as potentially killing all those touched by it. The player faces Kreia, now &quot;Darth Traya&quot;, as the final boss, and after she is defeated she offers to describe the future she foresees before dying.

===Later appearances===
The character would make no more future appearances in &quot;Star Wars&quot; fiction. However, Kreia is mentioned in several &quot;Star Wars&quot; reference books, such as &quot;Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force&quot; and the second volume of &quot;The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia&quot;. In addition, Wizards of the Coast created a miniature for the character, along with other characters in the &quot;Knights of the Old Republic&quot; series, which was released August 19, 2008. In February 2018, Darth Traya and select other &quot;Sith Lords&quot; characters were announced as playable characters and raid bosses for the mobile game &quot;Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes&quot;.

==Reception==
Kreia has been positively received. Alexander Gambotto-Burke, for &quot;Eurogamer&quot;, considered Kreia to be the greatest villain in video gaming, praising her dialogue, Kestelman&#x27;s &quot;intelligent and subtle&quot; voice-acting, and the way she forced the player into making choices and considering their decisions. IGN&#x27;s Hilary Goldstein offered similar praise to her dialogue. When looking at morality in games, Gamasutra&#x27;s Katherine Cross noted how Kreia&#x27;s comments affected her more than many of the dark-side/light-side choices in the game. Her &quot;practical&quot; philosophy was also complimented by Kotaku&#x27;s Phil Owen, who noted its ties to reality over the traditional moral extremes of the Sith and the Jedi. &quot;Eurogamer&quot;″s Richard Cobbett considered her the most &quot;famous&quot; of &quot;The Sith Lords&quot;″ subversion of &quot;Star Wars&quot; and the first &quot;Knights of the Old Republic&quot;, commenting &quot;Whether you agree or think she&#x27;s crazy, she&#x27;s a fresh breath of air for the series, and easily one of the best RPG characters ever.&quot;

The character is often considered &quot;The Sith Lord&quot;″s greatest or most important character. Julie Muncy of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; said she was the greatest part of the game and called her the game&#x27;s most &quot;captivating&quot; character, which she credited to her &quot;cold charisma&quot;. Muncy found herself genuinely changing her character based on her opinions, overly caring about how Kreia viewed her character. Similarly, &quot;PC Gamer&quot; credited Kreia with &quot;The Sith Lords&quot;″s success, calling her &quot;clearly haunted, bitter, manipulative, and yet &quot;right&quot; in so many ways&quot;. By looking at the &quot;Star Wars&quot; world through the view of her philosophy, they felt Obsidian made &quot;the most thoughtful take on &quot;Star Wars&quot; we&#x27;ll ever get&quot;. Robert Purchese, writing for &quot;Eurogamer&quot;, called her &quot;the strongest and most memorable character&quot; in the game, praising her writing and how she embodied &quot;The Sith Lords&quot;″s gray areas. Allen Rausch of GameSpy described her as the game&#x27;s most compelling character, commending Kreia for her challenges to his choices and noting how one example, concerning the importance of lightsabers, changed his view of the game.

The character has appeared in numerous lists, often reflecting her good reception as a &quot;Star Wars&quot; character. IGN placed her at 81 in &quot;The Top 100 &quot;Star Wars&quot; Characters&quot;, noting her crypticness. She, along with the other Sith Lords in the game, came second-place in a modified list of the best &quot;Star Wars&quot; villains, based on reader requests for characters left out of the original list. The Lords of both the first and second &quot;Knights of the Old Republic&quot; were similarly grouped as some of gaming&#x27;s best &quot;Star Wars&quot; characters by Joe Juba of &quot;Game Informer&quot;, calling most of them &quot;cooler and better developed&quot; than the Sith Lords in the actual &quot;Star Wars&quot; films. The character was ranked seventh among &quot;Game Informer&quot;″s &quot;Top Ten Female Villains in Video Games&quot; by Liz Lanier, saying that &quot;Kreia is one of the few female Sith Lords of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe, but she represents women of the dark side relatively ruthlessly.&quot; The &quot;struggle&quot; against her was called one of &quot;25 greatest &quot;Star Wars&quot; moments in Xbox history&quot; by Edwin Evans-Thirlwell writing for GamesRadar, who called her reveal of her agenda &quot;compelling&quot; despite being exposition.

Not all reception of the character was positive. Adam Rosenburg of UGO Networks listed Kreia as one of the worst &quot;Star Wars&quot; expanded universe characters, considering her at the center of &quot;Knights of the Old Republic II&quot;″s &quot;stupidity&quot; and criticizing her Sith name. Gamasutra&#x27;s Christopher Buecheler, the &quot;Resident Cynic&quot;, found Kreia&#x27;s comments &quot;a bit trite and condescending&quot;. Buecheler also faulted how gaining Influence with Kreia was essential in understanding the main plot of the game.
In a moment described as &quot;(in)famous&quot; by Cross, on Nar Shaddaa the player may give a beggar money or leave him; if he is given the money, Kreia shows how he is made a target of and attacked, and if he is refused Kreia reveals he attacks others. Owen called this moment the crystallization of the game&#x27;s gray areas. Anthony Brock of Gamers Hell noted how it led to him passionately arguing with a game character, complimenting Obsidian for how involved he felt. Cobbett similarly highlighted the moment when praising the character. Buecheler, however, criticized the scene for using an unlikely chance event to make its point.

Kreia won &quot;Best Character&quot; in GameSpy&#x27;s 2005 game of the year awards. They called her a &quot;deeply unpleasant, highly disturbing, and incredibly hateful person&quot;, but also &quot;easily the most intriguing, complicated, enigmatic, well-designed and nuanced character in a video game [in 2005]&quot;. She was also nominated for GameSpot&#x27;s 2004 &quot;Best New Character&quot; award, though lost to &quot;The Boss&quot; in &quot;Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater&quot;.

===Avellone retrospective===
Avellone has said he felt he failed in creating a sympathetic Sith Lord, recalling buglists by QA testers referring to her as &quot;that crusty annoying lady,&quot; and he considered the ending&#x27;s explanations of her motivations more &quot;hamfisted&quot; than sympathetic. However, in an interview with 1UP.com he called Kreia, along with the Handmaiden, his favorite character after T3-M4, citing the mystery surrounding her. He called his favorite &quot;unexpected turn&quot; in the game the revelation of Kreia being neither fully good nor evil. In another interview, this time with &quot;Star Wars&quot; fansite EU Cantina, he called his favorite character either Kreia or T3, and called her scene where she explains her relationship with the Force one of his favorites in the game.

==Analysis==

Alexander Gambotto-Burke felt the character was a presentation of Avellone&#x27;s criticisms of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; mythos and the morality presented in most post-Garriott video games, and called her &quot;a tutorial, an incentive to explore moral avenues you might have otherwise ignored&quot;. Gambotto-Burke considered her not purely evil, and felt even at the end of the game &quot;you can&#x27;t help but see her as a flawed visionary&quot;. GameSpot considered her point to be for the player to move on from &quot;self-defeating&quot; nihilism and realize &quot;the act of choice &quot;is&quot; what gives form and pattern to the universe&quot;.

In her piece analysing game morality, Katherine Cross highlighted the beggar scene on Nar Shaddaa. Cross noted how it illustrated Kreia&#x27;s morality, shed doubt on &quot;tokenist&quot; moral acts, and highlighted the player&#x27;s own powerlessness. Hilary Goldstein noted how her philosophical points questioned the roles of the Jedi and the Sith.

<text>Jamshid() (, &quot;Jamshēd&quot;; Middle- and New Persian: جم, &quot;Jam&quot;), also known as Yima (Avestan: 𐬫𐬌𐬨𐬀 &quot;Yima&quot;; Persian/Pashto: یما &quot;Yama&quot;), is the fourth Shah of the mythological Pishdadian dynasty of Iran according to &quot;Shahnameh&quot;.

In Persian mythology and folklore, Jamshid is described as the fourth and greatest king of the epigraphically unattested Pishdadian Dynasty (before the Kayanian dynasty). This role is already alluded to in Zoroastrian scripture (e.g. &quot;Yasht&quot; 19, &quot;Vendidad&quot; 2), where the figure appears as &quot;Yima xšaēta&quot; () &quot;radiant Yima&quot;, from which the name &#x27;Jamshid&#x27; is derived.

Both &quot;Jam&quot; and &quot;Jamshid&quot; remain common Iranian and Zoroastrian male names that are also popular in surrounding areas of Iran such as Afghanistan and Tajikistan. Edward FitzGerald transliterated the name as &quot;Jamshyd&quot;. In the eastern regions of Greater Iran, and by the Zoroastrians of the Indian subcontinent it is rendered as &quot;Jamshed&quot; based on the Classical Persian pronunciation.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Jamshid&quot; is originally a compound of two parts, &quot;Jam&quot; and &quot;shid&quot;, corresponding to the Avestan names &quot;Yima&quot; and &quot;Xšaēta&quot;, derived from the Proto-Iranian &quot;*Yamah Xšaitah&quot; (&#x27;Yama, the brilliant/majestic&#x27;). &quot;Yamah&quot; and the related Sanskrit &quot;Yama&quot; are interpreted as &quot;the twin&quot;, perhaps reflecting an Indo-Iranian belief in a primordial Yama and Yami pair. By regular sound changes (y → j, and the loss of the final syllable) an Old Persian form equivalent to Avestan &quot;Yima&quot; became Middle Persian &quot;Jam&quot;, which was subsequently continued into New Persian.

There are also a few functional parallels between Avestan Yima and Sanskrit Yama; for instance, &quot;Yima&quot; was the son of &quot;Vivaŋhat&quot;, who in turn corresponds to the Vedic &quot;Vivasvat&quot;, &quot;he who shines out&quot;, a name for the sun-god Surya. Both Yamas in Iranian and Indian myth guard Hell with the help of two four-eyed dogs.

Oettinger, when talking about how the story of Yima was originally a flood myth, and how original Sanskrit flood myths had their protagonist as yama, mentions that even the Norse had their own cognate of Yima and Yama, named Ymir, who was a primordial giant whose death caused a great flood and was a basis behind the formation of the world. Ymir was still associated with a flood, as Snorri Sturluson recorded that they believed that the death of Ymir caused a great flood, killing all of the Frost Giants except one named Bergelmir, who floated on some wooden object with his wife and from him the Frost Giants come. The Bergelmir aspect may be due to Christianization. However, the myth still has Ymir connected to a flood. Oettinger&#x27;s main argument was on how the Indic &quot;Yama&quot; and the Iranic &quot;Yima&quot;, both cognates of the Norse &quot;Ymir&quot;, also related to the flood.

&quot;*Xšaitah&quot; meant &quot;bright, shining&quot; or &quot;radiant&quot;. By regular sound changes (initial xš → š (sh); ai → ē; t → d between vowels; and dropping of the final syllable) &quot;*xšaitah&quot; became Persian &quot;shēd&quot;. In Iranian Persian, the vowel /ē/ is pronounced as /i/. Consequently, &quot;Jamshēd&quot; (as it is still pronounced in Afghanistan and Tajikistan) is now pronounced &quot;Jamshid&quot; in Iran. The suffix &quot;-shid&quot; is the same as that found in other names such as &quot;khorshid&quot; (&quot;the Sun&quot; from Avestan &quot;hvarə-xšaēta&quot; &quot;radiant Sun&quot;).

The modern Turkish name &quot;Cem&quot; is derived from the Persian &quot;Jam&quot;.

One contributor has posited that Persian &quot;jam&quot; is the root of Arabic &quot;ajam&quot;, assuming that this Arabic word for the Persian-speaking population was derived from a Persian endonym, meaning the people of Jam. However, this is incorrect. ʿAjam comes from the Arabic root ʿ(ʿayn) ج (jim) م (mim), meaning to speak incomprehensibly, and was used among Arabs, initially, for all peoples who spoke languages that were incomprehensible to Arabic speakers, whether they spoke Persian, Fulani, or a Turkic language. Later, Arabs used this word as a derogatory term for Persian speakers to distinguish them from Arabic speakers. The word ʿajam or ʿajami is still used in other parts of the Islamic world to denote languages other than Arabic, particularly in the Saharan and sub-Saharan regions.

==In scripture==
Source:

In the second chapter of the &quot;Vendidad&quot; of the Avesta, the omniscient Creator Ahura Mazda asks Yima, a good shepherd, to receive his law and bring it to men. However, Yima refuses, and so Ahura Mazda charges him with a different mission: to rule over and nourish the earth, to see that the living things prosper. This Yima accepts, and Ahura Mazda presents him with a golden seal and a dagger inlaid with gold.

Yima rules as king for three hundred years, and soon the earth was full of men, flocks of birds and herds of animals. He deprived the &quot;daevas&quot;, who were demonic servants of the evil Ahriman, of wealth, herds and reputation during his reign. Good men, however, lived lives of plenty, and were neither sick nor aged. Father and son walked together, each appearing no older than fifteen. Ahura Mazda visits him once more, warning him of this overpopulation. Yima, shining with light, faced southwards and pressed the golden seal against the earth and boring into it with the poniard, says &quot;O Spenta Armaiti, kindly open asunder and stretch thyself afar, to bear flocks and herds and men.&quot;

The earth swells and Yima rules for another six hundred years before the same problem occurred once more. Once again he pressed the seal and dagger to the earth and asked the ground to swell up to bear more men and beasts, and the earth swells again. Nine hundred years later, the earth was full again. The same solution is employed, the earth swelling again.

The next part of the story tells of a meeting of Ahura Mazda and the Yazatas in &quot;Airyanem Vaejah&quot;, the first of the &quot;perfect lands&quot;. Yima attends with a group of &quot;the best of mortals&quot;, where Ahura Mazda warns him of an upcoming catastrophe: &quot;O fair Yima, son of Vivaŋhat! Upon the material world the evil winters are about to fall, that shall bring the fierce, deadly frost; upon the material world the evil winters are about to fall, that shall make snow-flakes fall thick, even an arədvi deep on the highest tops of mountains.&quot;

The Vedivdad mentions that Ahura Mazda warns Yima that there will come a harsh winter storm followed by melted snow. Ahura Mazda advises Yima to construct a &quot;Vara&quot; (Avestan: enclosure) in the form of a multi-level cavern, two miles (3 km) long and two miles (3 km) wide. This he is to populate with the fittest of men and women; and with two of every animal, bird and plant; and supply with food and water gathered the previous summer. Yima creates the Vara by crushing the earth with a stamp of his foot, and kneading it into shape as a potter does clay. He creates streets and buildings, and brings nearly two thousand people to live therein. He creates artificial light, and finally seals the Vara with a golden ring.Henry Corbin interprets this story as a spiritual event and describes it as follows: Yima &quot;received the order to build the enclosure, the Var, where were gathered together the elect from among all beings, the fairest, the most gracious, that they might be preserved from the mortal winter unleashed by the demonic Powers, and some day repopulate a transfigured world. Indeed, the Var of Yima is, as it were, a city, including houses, storehouses, and ramparts. It has luminescent doors and windows that themselves secrete the light within, for it is illuminated both by uncreated and created lights.&quot;Norbert Oettinger argues that the story of Yima and the Vara was originally a flood myth, and the harsh winter was added in due to the dry nature of Eastern Iran, as flood myths didn&#x27;t have as much of an effect as harsh winters. He has argued that the Videvdad 2.24&#x27;s mention of melted water flowing is a remnant of the flood myth.

==In tradition and folklore==
Over time, the Avestan hero &quot;Yima Xšaēta&quot; became the world-ruling Shāh &quot;Jamshid&quot; of Persian legend and mythology.

According to the &quot;Shāhnāma&quot; of the poet Firdausī, Jamshid was the fourth king of the world. He had command over all the angels and demons of the world, and was both king and high priest of Hormozd (middle Persian for Ahura Mazda). He was responsible for a great many inventions that made life more secure for his people: the manufacture of armor and weapons, the weaving and dyeing of clothes of linen, silk and wool, the building of houses of brick, the mining of jewels and precious metals, the making of perfumes and wine, the art of medicine, the navigation of the waters of the world in sailing ships. The &quot;sudreh&quot; and &quot;kushti&quot; of the Zoroastrianism are also attributed to Jamshid. Traditional mythology also credits him with the invention of music. From the skin-clad followers of Keyumars, humanity had risen to a great civilization in Jamshid&#x27;s time.

Jamshid also divided the people into four groups:

* Kātouzians: The priests who conducted the worship of Hormozd
* Neysārians: The warriors who protected the people by the might of their arms
* Nāsoudians: The farmers who grew the grain that fed the people
* Hotokhoshians: The artisans, who produced goods for the ease and enjoyment of the people

Jamshid had now become the greatest monarch the world had ever known. He was endowed with the royal &quot;farr&quot; (Avestan: &quot;khvarena&quot;), a radiant splendor that burned about him by divine favor. One day he sat upon a jewel-studded throne and the &quot;div&quot;s who served him raised his throne up into the air and he flew through the sky. His subjects, all the peoples of the world, marvelled and praised him. On this day, which was the first of the month of Farvardin, they first celebrated the holiday of &quot;Nawrōz&quot; (&quot;new day&quot;). In the variant of the Zoroastrian calendar followed by the Zoroastrians of India, the first day of the month of Farvardin is still called &quot;Jamshēd-i Nawrōz&quot;.

Jamshid was said to have had a magical seven-ringed cup, the &quot;Jām-e Jam&quot; which was filled with the elixir of immortality and allowed him to observe the universe.

Jamshid&#x27;s capital was erroneously believed to be at the site of the ruins of Persepolis, which for centuries (down to 1620 CE) was called &quot;Takht-i Jamshēd&quot;, the &quot;Throne of Jamshid&quot;. However, Persepolis was actually the capital of the Achaemenid kings and was destroyed by Alexander. Similarly, the sculptured tombs of the Achaemenids and Sāsānians near Persepolis were believed to be images of the legendary hero Rostam, and so were called &quot;Naqsh-e Rustam&quot;.

Jamshid ruled well for three hundred years. During this time longevity increased, sicknesses were banished, and peace and prosperity reigned. But Jamshid&#x27;s pride grew with his power, and he began to forget that all the blessings of his reign were due to God. He boasted to his people that all of the good things they had come from him alone, and demanded that he should be accorded divine honors, as if he were the Creator.

From this time the &quot;farr&quot; departed from Jamshid, and the people began to murmur and rebel against him. Jamshid repented in his heart, but his glory never returned to him. The vassal ruler of Arabia, Zahhāk, under the influence of Ahriman, made war upon Jamshid, and he was welcomed by many of Jamshid&#x27;s dissatisfied subjects. Jamshid fled from his capital halfway across the world, but he was finally trapped by Zahhāk and brutally murdered by being sawn asunder. After a reign of seven hundred years, humanity descended from the heights of civilization back into a Dark Age.

===Legend of the discovery of wine===
King Jamshid is featured prominently in one apocryphal tale associated with the history of wine and its discovery. According to Persian legend, the king banished one of his harem ladies from his kingdom, causing her to become despondent and wishing to commit suicide. Going to the king&#x27;s warehouse, the girl sought out a jar marked &quot;poison&quot; which contained the remnants of grapes that had spoiled and were deemed undrinkable. Unbeknownst to her, the &quot;spoilage&quot; was actually the result of fermentation caused by the breakdown of the grapes by yeast into alcohol. After drinking the so-called poison, the harem girl discovered its effects to be pleasant and her spirits were lifted. She took her discovery to the king, who became so enamored with this new &quot;wine&quot; beverage that he not only accepted the girl back into his harem but also decreed that all grapes grown in Persepolis would be devoted to winemaking. While most wine historians view this story as pure legend, there is archaeological evidence that wine was known and extensively traded by the early Persian kings.

<doc id="1334658" wikidata="Q3706052" url="?curid=1334658" title="Boardshorts">
<text>Boardshorts are a type of swimwear and casual wear in the form of long (approximately knee length) loose-fitting shorts that are designed to be quick-drying and are generally made from strong and smooth polyester or nylon material. Originally known as surf trunks, later as [[Jams (clothing line)|Jams]], and occasionally in British English as swim shorts, boardshorts are a style of male and, more recently, female summerwear.

The name &quot;boardshorts&quot; is based on their use in aquatic sports that use a board, such as surfing. They may also be called boardies (coined by Body Glove in 1953) especially in Australia, or baggies particularly in South Africa.

Boardshorts have evolved over the last 50 years and separated themselves from the simpler swim trunks category from which they originated. In the beginning of their history, change happened organically – individual solutions were born out of the need to address environmental requirements and inadequacies in a garment that was increasingly used specifically for surfing. Although they are now considered a popular form of general beachwear, much of today&#x27;s mass consumer acceptance is based on competing brands marketing themselves as being authentic due to their historical roots within the surfing lifestyle and their product&#x27;s technical authority. 

Boardshorts are especially popular in North America and spread beyond surfing especially as the skater punk fashion trend got underway. They are also typically worn in men&#x27;s beach volleyball. They are less popular in other parts of the world, where other suit styles are preferred.

== Use and design ==
Boardshorts are designed to be quick-drying, and are generally made from strong and smooth polyester or nylon material. They are durable and hold up to wear from contact with a surfboard, yet are comfortable and light-weight. They are well-adapted to use in various active watersports.

Boardshorts do not have an elastic waist like many swim shorts do; instead they have a more rigid waistband which opens at the front, often with a velcro fly. The waistband is also held together at the front with a lace-up tie. This double fail-safe system is in order to ensure that the shorts cannot be pulled off the body by the force of the wave when a surfer is tumbled underwater during a wipeout. Another common feature of authentic surfing boardshort design is a very small pocket sealed with velcro and vented with a grommet. This is designed to be a secure place to carry a car key, house key, or hotel key card while in the water. Boardshorts traditionally have no lining, unlike traditional swim shorts.

Boardshorts are normally longer than many shorts or form-fitting speedo styles of swimwear, and often (other than the waist) they have a loose or baggy appearance. The major reason for the extra length is to protect the wearer&#x27;s legs from wax on the board. Surfboards are covered with a layer of sticky wax, which allows the surfer to stand on the board without slipping off. However, this wax can rip hair off the leg of a surfer when sitting on the board waiting for waves. Long boardshorts cover the back of the leg when sitting on the board, preventing the wax from ripping off the leg hair. The length of boardshorts is also affected by fashion trends; the length can range from mid-thigh (old school) to below the knee, covering the entire knee. In the 2000s, boardshorts were often worn low in the back, exposing the top of the buttocks. Many designs of boardshorts use vibrant color, striking patterns including Hawaiian floral images, and highlighted stitching; however not all boardshorts have these features.

Although the basic design for boardshorts remains largely the same, some manufacturers have taken advantage of new technology. Because surfers and other water-sports enthusiasts commonly wear boardshorts without underwear, one of the major complaints has been about the use of velcro for the fly closure which tends to entangle pubic hair. A solution that some manufactures have come up with is to use a neoprene fly, which does not allow the fly to completely open, but provides enough stretch so that the shorts can be easily pulled on and off. Pubic hair does not get caught on the neoprene fly. To remedy another common complaint, about boardshorts stitching in the inseam area which would rub directly against the wearer&#x27;s skin, many manufacturers switched to a seamless design, or use welding or glue, rather than stitches. For boardshorts without a liner, many males choose to wear some type of tight swimwear underneath. Some male wearers prefer to wear regular underwear such as compression shorts, boxer shorts, a jockstrap, or briefs under them, while others wear nothing underneath at all. Some female surfers wear a one-piece swimsuit or bikini bottom under boardshorts.

Some style of Mixed Martial Arts shorts were developed from boardshorts. Men&#x27;s physique class in the National Physique Committee also uses boardshorts for onstage competition.

Almost all swimsuit manufacturers and many designer brands now produce boardshorts. There are also boardshort-specific retailers, which offer an assortment of boardshorts to the surfing and wakeboarding public.

<doc id="1334687" wikidata="Q6685226" url="?curid=1334687" title="Lotus birth">
<text>Lotus birth (or umbilical cord nonseverance - UCNS) is the practice of leaving the umbilical cord uncut after childbirth so that the baby is left attached to the placenta until the cord naturally separates at the umbilicus. This usually occurs within 3–10 days after birth. The practice is performed mainly for spiritual purposes, including for the perceived spiritual connection between the placenta and the newborn.

As of December 2008, no evidence exists to support any medical benefits for the baby. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has warned about the risks of infection as the decomposing placenta tissue becomes a nest for infectious bacteria such as Staphylococcus. In one such case a 20-hour old baby whose parents chose UCNS was brought to the hospital in an agonal state, was diagnosed with sepsis and required an antibiotic treatment for 6 weeks.

==History==

Although recently arisen as an alternative birth phenomenon in the West, super-delayed (1+ hours post-birth) umbilical severance is common in home births.

Early American pioneers, in written diaries and letters, reported practicing nonseverance of the umbilicus as a preventative measure, as they believed it protected the infant from an open wound infection.

===Modern practice===

In the 1980s, yoga master and midwife Jeannine Parvati Baker was the main advocate for the practice in the United States. The practice spread to Australia by a midwife, Shivam Rachana, founder of the International College of Spiritual Midwifery and author of the book &quot;Lotus Birth&quot;. In the full lotus birth clinical protocol, the umbilical cord, which is attached to the baby&#x27;s navel and placenta, is not clamped or cut. The baby is immediately placed on the mother&#x27;s belly/chest (depending on the length of the cord) or kept in close proximity to the mother in cases when medically necessary procedures such as resuscitation may be needed. In Lotus birth, the placenta is delivered vaginally, often with the maternal informed choice for passive management of third stage of labor, allowing for natural detachment of the placenta within appropriate time allowed for it, with no hormonal injections (such as oxytocin) or via cesarean section.

Following birth, the placenta is simply put in a bowl or quickly wrapped in absorbent toweling and placed near the mother-baby. Caregivers step back to allow for undisturbed maternal-child bonding to occur as the primary event for an hour or more. It is only after this initial intense bonding period that the placenta is managed by rinsing, drying, applying preservatives, and positioning it in a way that allows for plentiful air circulation and proximity to the baby. The placenta, once ejected from the womb, has no circulation and quickly dies; and within 3–10 days postpartum the umbilical cord dries and detaches from the baby&#x27;s belly. The practice requires the mother and baby to be home bound as they wait for the placenta and umbilical cord to dry, decompose, and separate from the baby.

=== Risks ===

Lotus births are an extremely rare practice in hospitals. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) has stated, &quot;If left for a period of time after the birth, there is a risk of infection in the placenta which can consequently spread to the baby. The placenta is particularly prone to infection as it contains blood. At the post-delivery stage, it has no circulation and is essentially dead tissue,&quot; and the RCOG strongly recommends that any baby that undergoes lotus birthing be monitored closely for infection. Other risks include jaundice caused by abnormally high bilirubin and polycythemia, which is an abnormally high percentage of red blood cells in circulation. Case descriptions about adverse medical conditions related to this praxis are emerging, indicating severity of potential complications.
The World Health Organization does not support Lotus Birth, instead recommending a delayed cord clamping. 
=== Deaths ===
In May 2020, the Coroners Court of Victoria concluded that a baby died 16 hours after birth from sepsis in the setting of a lotus birth, which took place in 2017 at the Royal Children&#x27;s Hospital in Melbourne. The investigation identified that the most significant and severe risk factors for sepsis were vaginal seeding and lotus birth.

==Spiritual==
===Relation to nature===

In the animal world, the placenta is usually consumed by the mother. This is called placentophagy. Primates have been observed keeping the placenta attached to their newborns for a longer period. Primatologist Jane Goodall, who was the first person to conduct long-term studies of chimpanzees in the wild, reported that they did not chew or cut their offspring&#x27;s cords, instead leaving the umbilicus intact, like many other monkeys. Other researchers report that chimpanzees consume placentas after birth. Though other mammals may sever their offspring&#x27;s cords, they only do so after initial maternal sensory reception, unwinding of the cord, massage/cleaning (through touch), and initiation of nursing. This has been observed to last at least one hour, if left undisturbed.

===Energy===
Pseudo-scientific proponents of lotus births view the baby and the placenta as one on a cellular level, as they are from the same source, the egg and sperm conceptus. They also assert that the newborn and the placenta exist within the same quantum field, thus influencing various expressions of quantum mechanics that influence health. They claim transfers of energy &amp; cellular information continue to take place, moving gradually from the tissue of the placenta to the baby during the drying process. Scientists challenge this claim of a metaphysical dimension related to quantum mechanics.

<text>Where Have All the Merrymakers Gone? is the debut studio album by American rock band Harvey Danger. It was initially released by the independent record label the Arena Rock Recording Company on July 29, 1997. The second song on the album, &quot;Flagpole Sitta&quot;, received extensive airplay in the United States and resulted in the band&#x27;s fame. As the song gained national attention, the album was picked up and reissued by Slash Records, a label associated with London Records. On July 29, 2014, 17 years to the day after the album&#x27;s initial release, &quot;Where Have All the Merrymakers Gone?&quot; was re-released, for the first time as a vinyl LP, by No Sleep Records. The album has been described by Fuse as &quot;a definitive indie power pop punk record at a time and place where grunge reigned supreme&quot;.

The album title comes from a line in the song &quot;Radio Silence&quot;, which itself may have been inspired by a line from the Paul Newman film &quot;Harper&quot;. &quot;Private Helicopter&quot; was released to radio on October 13, 1998.

== Recording and production ==
&quot;Where Have All the Merrymakers Gone?&quot; was recorded over three different sessions with John Goodmanson at John &amp; Stu&#x27;s Place in Seattle, Washington. &quot;Private Helicopter&quot;, &quot;Terminal Annex&quot;, and &quot;Carjack Fever&quot; were recorded on March 16, 1996, and released on a commercially produced cassette tape, titled simply &quot;Harvey Danger&quot;, which was sold by the band at their shows and sent to music industry professionals. Three more songs (&quot;Flagpole Sitta&quot;, &quot;Woolly Muffler&quot;, and &quot;Wrecking Ball&quot;) recorded at the June 1996 session, were sent on a one-off cassette tape to Slash/London Records at the request of Greg Glover, an intern who was convinced on the strength of the recordings that he should fund a full album. All of the recordings, except one (&quot;Carjack Fever&quot;), became &quot;Where Have All the Merrymakers Gone?&quot; The total cost of the recording was about $3,000. &quot;Carjack Fever&quot; was later reworked into &quot;(Theme from) Carjack Fever&quot; for the band&#x27;s next album, &quot;King James Version&quot; (2000).

==Critical reception==

The &quot;Edmonton Journal&quot; deemed the album &quot;an effortless fusion of crystalline Elvis Costello songcraft, roaring indie-rock guitars, a big rhythm section and smart, smart-ass lyrics.&quot;

<text>WKUF-LP (94.3 FM) is a student-run low-power campus radio station located in Flint, Michigan. It broadcasts at 100 watts. It is operated by Kettering University, formerly the General Motors Institute (GMI). It is paid for by student activity fees and a special fund created by the university.

== History ==

=== Early broadcasts ===
Radio has a long history at Kettering University. In the early 1970s an unlicensed &quot;carrier current&quot; radio station operated with the call letters &quot;KRIB&quot;. The station was managed by GMI student Lewis Middaugh and Friday late-evening DJ, the late Johnnie Heiman (Dr. J). &quot;Dr. J&quot; moved from an Indiana nut farm to the &quot;big city&quot; Flint when he attended GMI. KRIB helped start him off on a very successful radio career until his death in a farming accident. KRIB was ahead of its time in the radio world. The Glett-Albanese wind-down hour, a Friday evening regular show, was one of the first &quot;dueling DJ&quot; spots in the nation. The show had a dedicated following and this broadcasting technique caught on across the nation. This continued until in the early 1980s, when the current student media club was formed, calling itself WGMI. The WGMI AM broadcasts were only available in the dorms, which meant that WGMI did not require any government licensing. The station, however, declined as AM broadcasts lost popularity. By 1997 there were no more broadcasts from WGMI AM 530. Despite this, there was still enough student interest to keep the radio media group alive.

=== WKUS Student Club ===
When GMI became Kettering University in 1998, the club updated its name to WKUS (Kettering University Station), and interest in a more official radio broadcast grew. Believing that Kettering should have a radio station due to its inevitable positive impacts on the university, WKUS made it one of their main goals to bring such a broadcast to campus. In effort to prepare for a radio station, a small broadcast booth was created in BJ&#x27;s Lounge, and students began to pursue official licensing.

Low-power FM was introduced to the public for the first time by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in January 2000. Club presidents Cortny Robison and Noelle Surprenant played an important role in filing the original FCC application in September 2000 for an LPFM building permit at a broadcast frequency of 96.7 MHz. The application, however, was held up because of a frequency adjacency issue with existing radio stations. Without a clear opportunity to amend the application, hopes for an FM radio station were put in limbo.

In order to sustain itself as a student media organization while it awaited the FCC&#x27;s response, WKUS reinvented itself as a student DJ service. The club promoted itself by instituting a regular Friday DJ Lunch Hour in the Great Court of Kettering&#x27;s Campus Center. In addition, the club provided DJ services for student organization activities, orientation weekends, homecoming week, Greek open parties, and philanthropy events. WKUS also achieved campus recognition by regularly hosting open mic nights and an annual battle-of-the-bands. A benefit concert for the FM effort was even held at the Flint Local 432.

The club operated this way for about two years, while this adjacency issue remained unchanged. Eventually, the FCC allowed the station the opportunity to amend the application and then-president Steven Proper took charge of filing the corrected application and preparing for possibility of being awarded a permit-to-build. With the time lapse from the original application, the university&#x27;s official stance on the project had become unclear and so the club officers set to work on creating a proposal to secure the university&#x27;s support. Foremost at the club&#x27;s priorities was creating a contingency plan to raise approximately $50,000 for the construction of the tower and broadcast equipment.

Work intensified when the club received notice that the FCC reviewed the amended application and had granted the university a permit-to-build. Faced with a fast approaching deadline, the student officers worked closely with Diane Vyvyan, the club&#x27;s advisor, and a steering committee to secure station space, design the broadcasting rig, and create an entirely new infrastructure for the club. After many presentations and meetings with the university&#x27;s leadership, the station was generously supported financially by Dr. Patrick Deese, the Dean of Student Affairs, and the Kettering Student Government (KSG).

The station&#x27;s construction was finished just before the deadline specified by the permit-to-build. The most visible portion of the station, the antenna tower, was erected on November 14, 2004 behind the Academic Building (original plans called for the antenna to be located on a lamp post in the athletic fields or on top of the campus center). As the station applied for an official call sign from the FCC, it was discovered that the letters WKUS, which had been associated with the LPFM effort were unavailable. The station leadership decided to instead apply for WKUF, which they envisioned standing for &quot;Kettering University and Flint&quot;, suggesting the station&#x27;s mission to be a voice for both the university and the Flint community. The &quot;LP&quot; suffix denotes the low power nature of the station.

The selection and acquisition of broadcast equipment was overseen by David Blankenship, the club&#x27;s vice-president (station engineer) and Dr. James McLaughlin from Kettering&#x27;s Electrical Engineering department designed the station&#x27;s antenna. Because of the time constraints surrounding the station&#x27;s construction, the University hired a dedicated co-op student, Alan Delos Santos, to work on the station.

On November 19, 2004 at 12:30 PM, WKUF-LP officially kicked off its broadcast with then-president Scott Porter giving a speech over the airwaves. As the speech was being read in the broadcast studio, a radio receiver was set up in the Great Court for all to hear. Steve Proper, who had originally prepared for the creation of the station, spoke as did Melverne Mills Jr., the Program Director and Steve Schwartz. Finally, Alan Delos Santos introducing the first official song broadcast by the station, &quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot; by The Buggles (a reference to the inaugural broadcast of MTV).

In addition to TV12, the &quot;Flint Journal&quot; and The Uncommon Sense stopped by to cover the official opening of the station. TV5 also stopped by before the official first broadcast to see the station.

<text>The Galleria dell&#x27;Accademia di Firenze, or &quot;Gallery of the Academy of Florence&quot;, is an art museum in Florence, Italy. It is best known as the home of Michelangelo&#x27;s sculpture &quot;David&quot;. It also has other sculptures by Michelangelo and a large collection of paintings by Florentine artists, mostly from the period 1300–1600 (the Trecento to the Late Renaissance). It is smaller and more specialized than the Uffizi, the main art museum in Florence. It adjoins the Accademia di Belle Arti or academy of fine arts of Florence, but despite the name has no other connection with it.

In 2016, it had 1.46 million visitors, making it the second-most-visited art museum in Italy, after the Uffizi (2.02 million).

==History==

The Galleria dell&#x27;Accademia was founded in 1784 by Pietro Leopoldo, Grand Duke of Tuscany.

In 2001 the &quot;Museo degli strumenti musicali&quot; collection opened. It includes musical instruments made by Stradivarius, Niccolò Amati and Bartolomeo Cristofori which were acquired by the Florence Conservatory.

In 2023, the museum successfully sued a magazine publisher for using an image of Michelangelo&#x27;s &quot;David&quot; without the museum&#x27;s permission, even though the artwork (which is physically in the museum) belongs to the public domain. The museum also objected to GQ Italia using a lenticular cover to switch between an image of the statue and Pietro Boselli.

==Works==
The Galleria dell&#x27;Accademia has housed the original &quot;David&quot; by Michelangelo since 1873. The sculpture was allegedly brought to the Accademia for reasons of conservation, although other factors were involved in its move from its previous outdoor location on Piazza della Signoria. The original intention was to create a &quot;Michelangelo museum&quot;, with original sculptures and drawings, to celebrate the fourth centenary of the artist&#x27;s birth. Today, the gallery&#x27;s small collection of Michelangelo&#x27;s work includes his four unfinished &quot;Prisoners&quot;, intended for the tomb of Pope Julius II, and a statue of &quot;Saint Matthew&quot;, also unfinished. In 1939, these were joined by the &quot;Palestrina Pietà&quot;, discovered in the Barberini chapel in Palestrina, though experts now consider its attribution to Michelangelo to be dubious.

Other works on display are Florentine paintings from the 13th and 16th centuries, including works by Paolo Uccello, Domenico Ghirlandaio, Sandro Botticelli and Andrea del Sarto; and, from the High Renaissance, Giambologna&#x27;s original full-size plaster modello for the &quot;Rape of the Sabine Women&quot;. As well as a number of Florentine Gothic paintings, the gallery houses the collection of Russian icons assembled by the Grand Dukes of the House of Lorraine, of which Leopoldo was one.

<text>The River Pool, or Pool River, is an urban river in south London, England. It is a tributary of the River Ravensbourne.

== Geography ==

The River Pool is in length, and rises with its tributaries between Shirley and West Wickham in the London Borough of Croydon. It then flows northwards through Beckenham in the London Borough of Bromley, and Sydenham in the London Borough of Lewisham, to join the Ravensbourne in Catford. Two of its tributaries are the River Beck and the Chaffinch Brook.

For much of its length the river lies in a floodplain. Land on either side is given up to sports grounds and a flood watch is kept continually on it.

In New Beckenham, the River Pool Walkway, running north from Lennard Road near the Midland Bank Sports Ground and Cator Park, includes a conservation site and naturalised areas; the route is part of the National Cycle Network. At Sydenham, the section of the river that ran in a culvert under the gas works has been opened up and landscaped.

In June 2009, London Mayor Boris Johnson fell into the River Pool whilst promoting volunteering to clean up the waterway.

<text>&quot;The Incredible Jewel Robbery&quot; was an episode of &quot;General Electric Theater&quot;, broadcast by CBS on March 8, 1959. It was the first appearance of the three Marx Brothers together in the same scene since &quot;A Night in Casablanca&quot; in 1946. They had previously appeared in individual scenes in &quot;The Story of Mankind&quot; in 1957, and in pairs in &quot;Love Happy&quot; in 1949 (Chico and Harpo appear together; Groucho is in one brief shot with Harpo in the chase scene, and Chico is in a cutaway shot in the wrap-up in Groucho&#x27;s office). &quot;Jewel Robbery&quot; would be their last joint TV appearance.

CBS explained the show as follows: &quot;If you watch the show you&#x27;ll see a familiar face equipped with mustache and leer. Because of his contract terms, his name can&#x27;t be mentioned, but he is not Jerry Colonna.&quot; This refers to the fact that Groucho was still hosting &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot; on NBC.

==Plot==

Harpo and Chico play Harry and Nick, two inept would-be robbers who try to pull a jewelry heist. Chico is disguised in a police uniform, and Harpo wears a Groucho Marx disguise. When they are caught and placed in a police lineup, the real Groucho shows up and is immediately fingered as the thief. Groucho then delivers the only line in the otherwise silent program: &quot;We won&#x27;t talk until we see our lawyer!&quot; Everybody gives each other their leg, and the &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot; duck drops down with &quot;The End&quot; in its beak.

<text>Kiviuq (), also spelled Qiviuq, Kiviok and other variants, is a legendary hero of the epic stories of the Inuit of the Arctic regions of northern Canada, Alaska and Greenland. Versions of his adventures vary with the location and the storyteller. In Greenland he is known as Qooqa. In Alaska he is called Qayaq, which is short for Qayaqtuaġiŋñaqtuaq (&#x27;He who shall always long to go roaming in his qayaq&#x27;).

==Story==
Kiviuq is an eternal Inuk wanderer. Spirits, giants, cannibals, bears and sea monsters intermingle in Kiviuq&#x27;s world, creating havoc for him. He walks, or travels by dog sled, kayak (qajaq), or may be borne by huge fishes. He fights with a harpoon and his supernatural powers allow him to overcome all manner of obstacles in his travels across the north.

==Franz Boas==
Franz Boas identified the Kiviuk legend as one of the best known of the circumpolar Inuit adventure hunter-hero-traveler legends.

==Versions of the legend==

One well-known legend of Kiviuq tells of his friendship with the grandson of an old woman. Everyone abuses and makes fun of the boy except Kiviuq. The old woman decides to get revenge. She changes her grandson into a seal and has him swim out to sea. The men follow the seal, intending to hunt it. Before the hunters reach it, however, the old woman creates a storm and drowns everyone but the seal and Kiviuq. The seal swims safely back to shore, where the old woman turns him back into a boy. Kiviuq drifts away in his kayak continuing his adventures and living with people of many foreign lands.

===Netsilik===
In a story from the Netsilik people, the world ends when Kiviuq&#x27;s face transforms completely into stone. Currently, after about 100 years of change, his face is half stone.

Inuit elders say that he is in his last life now, on an adventure somewhere. However, before he dies he will return to see his people. Oral tradition has preserved many versions of the Kiviuq story-cycle, and today, a new generation of Inuit storytellers is bringing the tales to life in written or graphic form.

Qikiqtaarjuk, once a Hudson Bay island and now a peninsula, is associated with Kiviuq.

===Kivalliq===
In the Kivalliq Region, the story tells of an orphan boy who lived with his grandmother. The boy would be teased and bullied every day by other boys. He would go home crying every day with ripped clothes. His poor grandmother would have to sew perfectly good clothes every day with her poor eyesight. She grew tired of all the bullying her grandson went through that she had a plan.

There was a seal that had been caught for them as they couldn&#x27;t provide for themselves. With that seal, she asked her grandson to skin it carefully and not to puncture any holes in the skin. So as she said, the boy skinned it carefully and with no punctures. Then she asked him to put the skin on and make sure he could see through the little eye holes as if he were a seal. He followed her instructions, then he was asked to put his head in a pail of water and stay in there until he needed to breathe again. So the boy did as his grandmother asked and after he did it, he had to do it over and over until he could stay in the water so long that the sun had moved when he finally comes up for air. The grandmother was so satisfied that she told him to secretly go into the water with the seal skin on and get the mean boys to notice him as if he were a seal. After he gets noticed, he had to lure them out to the ocean. The boy did what his grandmother told him to do. The mean boys noticed him and thought he was a seal. Among the mean boys were Kiviuq and his brother.

After he lured them out to sea, they say he waved his arms and legs and cried as if he was a baby and asked for the wind to come. It is believed that when you were born and whatever the weather is on that day, it belongs to you. So in this case, the boy called for the wind and it came to him drowning all the mean boys but Kiviuq.

Kiviuq was a strong boy; he fought and fought against the waves. He did this for many days until he found land. It is believed that he is still out there living, so old that he is hard as stone, but his heart is still beating. If his heart stops beating, they say the world will end.

==In Inuit art==
The Kiviok legend is depicted in numerous works by Canadian Inuit artists such as Jessie Oonark (1906-1985) and her daughters, Janet Kigusiuq, Victoria Mamnguqsualuk, and Miriam Marealik Qiyuk.

Kigusiuq and Mamnguqsllaluk learned the stories from their grandparents in the 1930s and 1940s. Oonark&#x27;s mother and father and her mother-in-law Naatak, were storytellers who shared them with their grandchildren. Oonark&#x27;s well-known drawing and 1970 print by the same name–&quot;Dream of the Bird Woman&quot;–refers to the Kiviuq (Qiviuk)., an Inuk who faced dangerous obstacles in his journeys by kayak, which was described by Franz Boas as the most widely known Inuit legend in the circumpolar region.

<text>Keith Charles Flint (17 September 1969 – 4 March 2019) was an English singer, motorcyclist, dancer and a vocalist of the electronic dance act The Prodigy. Starting out as a dancer for the group, he became the vocalist and performed on the group&#x27;s two UK number-one singles, &quot;Firestarter&quot; and &quot;Breathe&quot;, both released in 1996. He was also the singer of his own band, Flint.

Flint owned a motorcycle racing team, Team Traction Control, which won four Isle of Man TT races in 2015 and 2016, and competed in the British Superbike Championship. He died at age 49 from hanging, while an inquest could not rule whether it was suicidal or accidental.

==Early life==
Flint was born in Redbridge, London, to Clive and Yvonne Flint, on 17 September 1969. Clive Flint worked as an engineering consultant. Keith Flint was initially raised in East London, but in the mid-1970s his parents moved out to a quiet suburban cul-de-sac in Springfield, in Chelmsford, Essex. His childhood was described as unhappy, and he feuded with his parents, who parted when he was young. He attended the Boswells School in Chelmsford and moved to Braintree after leaving school. Flint was described as being a &quot;bright boy with dyslexia&quot; and was disruptive in class. He was expelled from school at the age of 15. Flint then worked as a roofer and later enthusiastically embraced the acid house scene of the late 1980s. Musically, Flint was a childhood fan of The Jam, and in the late 1980s he listened to bands like Siouxsie and the Banshees.

In 1989, he appeared as the boy running in the video for the new beat act 101&#x27;s video for &quot;Just As Long As I Got You&quot;.

== Music career ==

Flint met DJ Liam Howlett at local rave club the Barn in Braintree, Essex, and said he liked Howlett&#x27;s taste in music. After receiving a mixtape from Howlett, Flint came back with great enthusiasm, insisting that Howlett should be playing his tracks up on stage and that Flint, along with friend Leeroy Thornhill, would dance to them. Flint, Howlett and Thornhill were joined by MC Maxim Reality and became the successful electronic dance act The Prodigy.

In 1996, just prior to the release of The Prodigy&#x27;s third album, Flint moved from being a dancer for the group to being its frontman when he performed vocals on the hit single &quot;Firestarter&quot;; the accompanying video showcased Flint&#x27;s new and soon-to-be iconic punk look. This trend continued with the next Prodigy single, &quot;Breathe&quot;, on which Flint sang vocals, with Maxim backing him up.

The 1997 album &quot;The Fat of the Land&quot; also featured Flint&#x27;s vocal contributions on the tracks &quot;Serial Thrilla&quot; and &quot;Fuel My Fire&quot;. In 2002, the non-album single &quot;Baby&#x27;s Got a Temper&quot; was released, which was written by Flint.

Flint did not perform vocals on the next Prodigy album—&quot;Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned&quot; (2004)—but reappeared on the &quot;Hotride (El Batori Mix)&quot;, included on the &quot;Hotride&quot; single.

The Prodigy album &quot;Invaders Must Die&quot; was released on 23 February 2009 and featured vocals by Flint on multiple tracks. Flint released a single titled &quot;War&quot; with dubstep artist Caspa in 2012.

Flint experimented with solo projects, including his punk rock band Flint, which included remixes by Steven &quot;Stitch&quot; Held at The Recovery Room and Clever Brains Fryin&#x27;. Flint&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Device #1&quot;, was cancelled before its release, leaving &quot;Aim4&quot; as their only single to be commercially released.

==Motorcycle racing==
Flint was a keen motorcyclist. He rode from England to southern Spain to attend the 2007 Spanish motorcycle Grand Prix and also raced in club competitions. He rode with Lee Thompson of the band Madness. He had his own motorcycle team, Team Traction Control, which competed in the British Supersport Championship as part of the British Superbike Championship before stepping up to the British Superbike Championship in 2017. In 2015, Team Traction Control machines won two Isle of Man TT races, ridden by Ian Hutchinson. The team and Ian Hutchinson repeated their two victories again in 2016.

==Personal life==
Flint dated television presenter Gail Porter; the couple split in 2001. In 2006, Flint married Mayumi Kai. The couple were separated at the time of Flint&#x27;s death.

Flint had a tattoo across his stomach of the word &quot;Inflicted&quot;, a reference to a lyric in &quot;Firestarter&quot;. Flint was difficult on transatlantic flights; on one occasion he had to be restrained from kicking down the door to the cockpit. Prior to his marriage, Flint suffered from depression and an addiction to prescription painkillers. Flint kept fit by boxing and practicing Brazilian jiu-jitsu.

In 2014, he bought and renovated the Leather Bottle pub in Pleshey, Essex, and became a popular landlord. Flint kept a jar in which customers were required to put a pound in if they made a &quot;Firestarter&quot; joke as he lit the pub&#x27;s fire. He ended his connection with the pub without explanation in 2017.

Flint lived in a listed Tudor manor house near Dunmow, Essex. He had a small flat track in his back garden, where he rode some of his motorcycles. Flint was a lover of animals and was an enthusiastic twitcher; he built a pond in his garden to attract birds and kept several dogs and horses at his home.

He also enjoyed the countryside and rode with a fox hunt for several years.

==Death==
On 4 March 2019, just after 8:10 am, Essex Police were called to Flint&#x27;s home in North End, near Great Dunmow, Essex, in response to concerns for his welfare. Flint was pronounced dead at the scene, aged 49. The police did not treat the death as suspicious. It was later confirmed at an inquest into his death he had died as a result of hanging. The coroner adjourned the inquest until 23 July for a full hearing.

Later that day, bandmate Liam Howlett stated in an Instagram post that Flint&#x27;s death was a suicide. The official band website then went black with an announcement of his death, and the Prodigy cancelled all forthcoming shows.

Flint&#x27;s funeral was held on 29 March 2019. There was a public procession, attended by fans from around the world, followed by a private ceremony at St Mary&#x27;s Church Bocking, near Braintree in Mid-Essex, attended by family and friends, including Flint&#x27;s wife, Mayumi Kai, and bandmates Liam Howlett, Maxim and Leeroy Thornhill.

It was established by the coroner&#x27;s inquest on 8 May 2019 that there was insufficient evidence to either conclude a suicide verdict in relation to Flint&#x27;s death, or conclude his death was an accident. It was found that he had cocaine, alcohol, and codeine in his system at the time of his death. 

== Legacy ==
After Flint&#x27;s death, fans used the hashtag &quot;#Firestarter4Number1&quot; on social media in a campaign to try to get the song &quot;Firestarter&quot; to Number 1 in the UK Singles Chart as a mark of respect for Flint and to raise awareness for male suicide in the UK.

Following his death, many musical artists and music industry figures from around the world paid tribute to Flint. Many tributes highlighted Flint&#x27;s gentle temperament, illustrating a personal kindness, politeness and generosity that contrasted with his energetic and sometimes aggressive stage persona. Fellow British musician and Jamiroquai frontman Jay Kay said, &quot;What bloody tragic news. What a top fella and a great laugh. I hope they&#x27;ve got a quick bike for him up there.. cos he fucking sure knew how to ride one. Keith Flint... always &#x27;balls to the wall&#x27;.&quot;

In June 2019, fashion designer Donatella Versace dedicated her spring/summer 2020 menswear show in Milan to Flint&#x27;s memory. Versace, who was a friend of Flint&#x27;s, dressed male models in clothing reflecting his style and they sported Flint&#x27;s distinctive &quot;Firestarter&quot; hairstyle.

Whilst performing at Glastonbury Festival in June 2019, Liam Gallagher dedicated &quot;Champagne Supernova&quot; to Flint.

In the 2020 video game &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla&quot;, a bard named Keith resembling Flint can be found in Essex, England, as part of a sidequest titled &quot;The Prodigy&quot;. There, the &quot;Bishop of the Ruins&quot; is denouncing his music as unholy. The character says the presence of the player character, Eivor, is &quot;surely an omen&quot;, referencing the Prodigy&#x27;s song of the same name; when the protesting clergyman starts a fistfight with Eivor, Keith encourages the character to &quot;Smack my Bishop&quot;. Kristen McGorry, a writer on the game, confirmed on Twitter that these and other references were intentional tributes to Flint and the band.

On 5 August 2021, a Crowdfunder campaign was launched by music and mental wellbeing festival &quot;Headstock&quot; to commission street artist Akse P19 to paint a mural of Flint. The mural, which was unveiled on 9 September 2021, a day ahead of World Suicide Prevention Day, is located at Beechwood Road in Hackney, near to where The Prodigy played their first gig at the Four Aces Club in 1990.

<text>Constitution Dock is the harbour-side dock area of Hobart, the capital city of the Australian state of Tasmania, in the Port of Hobart, on the Derwent River. 

The dock is adjacent to other Hobart landmark areas, Victoria Dock, Salamanca Place and Battery Point, and forms part of the foreshore of Sullivans Cove.

The dock consists of a rock-walled marina with an opening for boats. The bridge is normally closed, allowing pedestrian access around the dock. The dock is normally used by motor pleasure boats, yachts, and fishing boats serving the city&#x27;s fish market and restaurants, several of which are at the northern end of the dock. 

Constitution Dock is famous for being the rallying point and party venue for the annual Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race, held from Boxing Day (the day after Christmas Day) until yachts complete their 630 nautical mile journey from Sydney.

<text>Heorhiy Mykolayovych Kirpa () (20 July 1946 in Klubivka, Khmelnytskyi Oblast – 27 December 2004 in Bortnychi, Kyiv) was a Ukrainian railway manager, statesman and politician, best known as the head of the Ukrzaliznytsia national railway company and Minister of Transportation and Telecommunications under President Leonid Kuchma.

== Political career ==
In May 2002, Kirpa was appointed Minister of Transport by the then President Leonid Kuchma and on April 23 was awarded an honourable title Hero of Ukraine. In a publicly debated move in 2003, the President placed paramilitary railroad armed forces under the direction of Kirpa. Kirpa was a staunch supporter of Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych, and the BBC described him as &quot;one of the most influential figures&quot; in Yanukovych&#x27;s government. 

== Death ==
Heorhiy Kirpa was found shot dead at his holiday home in Bortnychi (the outskirt of Kyiv), on 27 December 2004. The official police report states that Kirpa committed suicide.

==Remembrance==
Late December 2009 the Southwestern Railways requested the Kyiv City Council to rename Petrozavodska Street, which is located in the Solomianskyi Raion of Kyiv, as Heorhiy Kirpa Street. The Bortnychi railway station, the closest to Kirpa&#x27;s residence and death place, was renamed &quot;Heorhiy Kirpa Station&quot; in his honor by Ukrzaliznytsia.

==Key projects==
*Bridges: New Darnytskyi Bridge
*Train stations: Uzhhorod railway station, Darnytsia railway station, Kyiv-Pasazhyrskyi, Karavaevi Dachi railway station
*Highways: Highway M05

<doc id="1334735" wikidata="Q2466408" url="?curid=1334735" title="River Roding">
<text>The River Roding () rises at Molehill Green, Essex, England, then flows south through Essex and London and forms Barking Creek as it reaches the River Thames.

==Course==

The river leaves Molehill Green and passes through or near a group of eight or nine villages in Essex known collectively as the Rodings, as their names are &#x27;Roding&#x27; prefixed with various different specific names (High, Margaret, Aythorpe, etc.). After Chipping Ongar, the river flows under the M25 motorway by Passingford Bridge and Abridge.

 The river then runs between Loughton and Chigwell, where the Roding Valley Meadows make up the largest surviving area of traditionally managed river-valley habitat in Essex. This nature reserve consists of unimproved wet and dry hay meadows, rich with flora and fauna and bounded by thick hedgerows, scrubland, secondary woodland and tree plantation. The meadows stretch down to the M11 motorway and the Roding Valley tube station is situated close to the area, although Loughton or Buckhurst Hill are better placed for a visit. The river then enters Woodford.
Redbridge takes its name from a crossing of the river which then passes through Ilford and Barking near the A406 North Circular Road. The River Roding through Ilford project is a government-backed scheme to improve amenities along this stretch of the river. After Barking, the tidal section is known as Barking Creek, which flows into the Thames at Creekmouth, where the Barking Barrier acts as a flood defence.

==As a boundary==
In Essex the river forms part of the boundary between the district of Epping Forest and borough of Brentwood. The river marks the southernmost part of the boundary between the London Borough of Newham and the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham. 

==Former name==
Ilford takes its name from &quot;Ilefort&quot;, &quot;ford on the River Hyle&quot;, which was the ancient name for the lower part of the Roding, based on an earlier Celtic word.

<text>Harfleur () is a commune in the Seine-Maritime department in the Normandy region of northern France.

It was the principal seaport in north-western France for six centuries, until Le Havre was built about five kilometres (three miles) downstream in the sixteenth century to take advantage of anchorages less prone to siltation. Harfleur is now on the eastern edge of Le Havre&#x27;s urban area.

==Geography==
A light industrial town situated in the Pays de Caux by the banks of the Seine and Lézarde rivers, some east of Le Havre, at the junction of the N282, D231 and D9015 roads. Harfleur station has rail connections to Fécamp and Le Havre.

==History==
In Roman times, Harfleur was known as &quot;Caracotinum&quot;, the principal port of the ancient Calates. A Roman road led from Harfleur to Troyes. Another road that disappeared during the Hundred Years War linked Harfleur to Fécamp.

Several Merovingian sarcophagi have been unearthed at the foot of Mount Cabert.

In the Middle Ages, the town&#x27;s name, &quot;Herosfloth&quot;, &quot;Harofluet&quot; or &quot;Hareflot&quot;, was still sufficiently uncorrupted to indicate its Norman origins. The suffix &quot;fleur&quot; comes from Old Norse &quot;Flöthe&quot; meaning &quot;estuary or arm of the sea&quot;. The precise meaning of the prefix &quot;har&quot; is unknown.

* 1202 saw the granting of a town charter by King John of England.
* In 1281 the expansion of the port of Harfleur began.
* At the beginning of the 14th century, Harfleur saw the setting-up of a Spanish (from the Aragonese Crown) and Portuguese merchants association.
* 1341–1361 saw the building of the city walls, pierced by three gates (Porte d&#x27;Eure, Porte de Rouen and Montivilliers Gate). These were restored in the 15th century after the destruction caused during the Hundred Years War.
For six centuries, Harfleur was the principal seaport of north-western France. In 1415, it was captured by Henry V of England, an event explicitly mentioned in a popular song of the day, the Agincourt Carol. Sir John Fastolf of Caister Castle Norfolk (1380–1459) later claimed to have been &#x27;the first man over the side&#x27; of the boat when the English landed outside the town; and he certainly played a part in the siege, being invalided home afterwards. The Siege of Harfleur lasted some weeks longer than Henry V had anticipated; that was not helped by the outbreak of dysentery which afflicted and killed soldiers, knights, and nobles, with many of the sick having to be transported back to England. The town&#x27;s defences were badly damaged by the siege warfare, as were many of the principal buildings of the town. In order to consolidate his victory, Henry was forced to leave a significant part of his army as a garrison for the newly captured town. While Henry&#x27;s intentions after the end of the siege are unclear, he had clearly entered France with an army large enough to engage the French in open battle and not merely to lay siege to one town. Henry left Harfleur, but he found his path to Calais blocked by a French army forcing him inland. The French cut off the English route and confronted them on the muddy fields near Azincourt (not the present-day Agincourt) on Saint Crispin&#x27;s Day, 25 October 1415. The Battle of Agincourt ended in a decisive English victory with minimal losses - only in the hundreds - and a crushing defeat for the French with losses nearing the tens of thousands.

In 1435, the people of the district of Caux, led by Jean de Grouchy, rose against the English. One hundred and four of the inhabitants opened the gates of the town to the insurgents, and forced the English occupiers out. The memory of the deed was long perpetuated by the bells of St. Martin&#x27;s tolling 104 strokes.

Between 1445 and 1449 the English were again in possession, but the town was recovered for the French by Jean de Dunois in 1450. In 1562, the Huguenots pillaged Harfleur and its registers and charters perished in the confusion, but its privileges were restored by Charles IX of France in 1568. It was not until 1710 that it was subjected to the &quot;taille&quot;.

In the 16th century, the port began to dwindle in importance owing to the silting up of the Seine estuary and the rise of Le Havre. In 1887, the Tancarville canal restored waterborne access to the town from both the Seine and Le Havre.

In 1884, Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée shipbuilding company constructed an artillery workshop on the land immediately south of the canal, known for his QF designs worked there. In January 1897 the workshop together with the shipyard&#x27;s intellectual property related to artillery was bought by Schneider et Cie, who employed Canet and invested a lot of money into developing the facility into a full-scale plant with a large testing range that could be used for firing at both sea and land targets, and also built Mayville town north of the canal for the workers. In 1937 it was nationalized by the left government of Popular Front and later existed as Ateliers de construction du Havre de la Compagnie normande de mécanique de précision (AHE/CNMP), producing e. g. Panhard AML armoured cars. In 1963 it was subordinated to SNECMA, which redirected the efforts to aerospace industry. Now the location hosts a Safran Nacelles plant.
After the Armistice following World War I, a huge hutted camp was established at Harfleur as a basis for dealing with the transit of thousands of troops being demobilised. The British soldier Arthur Bullock recorded in his memoir what life was like there, together with a humorous illustration of his Nissen hut, labelled &#x27;Home Sweet Home&#x27;.

<text>Mansaku Itami (伊丹万作; real name Yoshitoyo Ikeuchi 池内義豊; 2 January 1900 – 21 September 1946) was a Japanese film director and screenwriter known for his critical, sometimes satirical portraits of Japan and its history. He is the father of the director Juzo Itami.

==Career==
Originally from Matsuyama, Ehime, Itami joined the Nikkatsu studio in 1927, but the very next year moved to the actor Chiezō Kataoka&#x27;s company, Chiezō Productions, where he made his directorial debut with &quot;Adauchi Ruten&quot;. His samurai films diverged from the norm in that they were not heroic epics of the sort which had by that time become formulaic, but rather satires that used the established symbols and iconography of the samurai culture to comment on both historical and modern society. His work was championed by the film critic Fuyuhiko Kitagawa. His most famous work is &quot;Akanishi Kakita&quot;, which is based on a story by Naoya Shiga and still survives (unlike many of his other films).

In 1937, he collaborated with director Arnold Fanck on a German-Japanese co-production, starring the young Setsuko Hara. This eventually became two slightly different films: &quot;Atarashiki Tsuchi&quot; (&quot;The New Earth&quot;) in Japan, while &quot;Die Tochter des Samurai&quot; (&quot;Daughter of the Samurai&quot;) was the German version.

He died of tuberculosis in 1946. His screenplays&#x27; popularity endured, however, and he is credited as a writer as recently as 1986&#x27;s &quot;Kokushi Muso&quot;, a remake of his 1932 film of the same name.

==Family==
His son Yoshihiro Ikeuchi, who later changed his name to Juzo Itami, followed in his footsteps, becoming one of the pre-eminent Japanese filmmakers of the late 20th century. His daughter Yukari married Kenzaburō Ōe, the Nobel Prize-winning novelist. Ōe edited a collection of his father-in-law&#x27;s essays.

<text>Combat or tactical boots are military boots designed to be worn by soldiers during combat or combat training, as opposed to during parades and other ceremonial duties. Modern combat boots are designed to provide a combination of grip, ankle stability, and foot protection suitable for a rugged environment. They are traditionally made of hardened and sometimes waterproofed leather. Today, many combat boots incorporate technologies originating in civilian hiking boots, such as Gore-Tex nylon side panels, which improve ventilation and comfort. They are also often specialized for certain climates and conditions, such as jungle boots, desert boots, and cold weather boots as well as specific uses, such as tanker boots and jump boots.

==History==
===Early===
====Classical era====
The legionnaires of the Roman Empire wore hobnail boots, called &quot;caligae&quot;. By the late 1st century the army began to transition into an enclosed boot called &quot;calceus&quot;; calcei offered more protection and warmth than the caligae. They quickly became a staple in both Roman military and civilian dress.

====England and United Kingdom====
During the English Civil War, each soldier of the New Model Army was issued three shoes or ankle boots. After every march, the soldier would rotate them to ensure they received even wear. Following the Restoration, shoes and uniforms followed the civilian pattern: shoes with buckles were used by most armies from 1660 until around 1800. Hessian boots were used by cavalry from the 18th century until World War I.

Late in the Napoleonic Wars, the British army began issuing ankle boots that replaced the buckle shoes. These types of boots remained in use throughout the 19th century and were used in conflicts including the Crimean War (1853–1856), First Zulu War (1879), and First Boer War (1880–1881).

These in turn were replaced by ammunition boots, which were used in a variety of similar design patterns from the late 1880s until the late 1960s. The &quot;George Boots&quot; worn with the Officers&#x27; dress uniform and mess dress are similar, but they lack the leather counter (heel cap), the toe case (toe-cap) and omit the hobnails, and the steel heel and toe plates.

====United States====
Infantry regiments of the US military were equipped with calf-high boots in the War of 1812. From the 1820s until before the American Civil War soldiers were issued ankle-high boots, which were made on straight lasts. There was no &quot;left&quot; or &quot;right&quot; boot; instead, they shaped themselves to the wearer&#x27;s feet over time. As a result, these boots were very uncomfortable until broken in and often resulted in blisters. They were replaced in 1858 with an improved version generally known as Jeff Davis boots after Jefferson Davis, the Secretary of War who re-equipped the army in the 1850s. These were used until the 1880s.

==20th and 21st centuries==

===Australia===
Since 2000, the Australian Defence Force, primarily uses the Redback Terra Combat Boot as a replacement for the Vietnam War-era General Purpose combat boots. It was given a limited number of tests in 1999, and was later distributed in 2000. Despite the boot&#x27;s general aptitude for the tasks which the ADF had first put it in place for, it still had major flaws. 90% of all negative feedback from soldiers was about its inappropriate sizing, having only 43 different sizes. Many also claimed that its sole would rot under worst-case tropical circumstances. Various military personnel have also used Rossi boots.

In mid 2013 a boot trial was undertaken by the ADF to find a replacement for the issued Redback Combat Boot. Boots trialled included updated versions of the Redback Boot as well as various off the shelf boots. At the conclusion of the trial the Danner TFX 8 was selected as the new ADF combat boots: they were comfortable in hot weather and provided good support. However these were found to fail prematurely and were never issued on a large scale.

As a result, Redback were tasked with once again providing a range of combat boots to the ADF including a General Purpose boot, a Jungle Style boot and a Flame Resistant boot. These boots are being issued on a very limited basis and are currently undergoing limited testing. However early reports are not favourable with complaints of failing eyelets and lack of water resistance. Danners are still being retained as a &#x27;Desert&#x27; boot or for those who don&#x27;t fit the current boot.

As of December 2017 the Redback Terra style combat boot is still the standard issue combat boot.

===Argentina===
In the early 20th century, Argentine soldiers wore hobnail boots with leather gaiters as well as jackboots. The combat boots worn during the Falklands War came with durable stitched rubber soles. These boots continue to be worn today in addition to the later pattern with &quot;EA&quot; stamped on the leg.

===Belgium===
Belgian combat boots are marked by the abbreviation &quot;ABL&quot; (Armée Belge / Belgisch Leger), i.e. &quot;Belgian armed forces&quot; in French and Dutch languages. The soles of Belgian combat boots have different markings, according to the soles manufacturers: Rugak, Rubex and Solidor (models of 1970-s). Leather uppers have markings of &quot;GESKA&quot; (&quot;Geska&quot; NV) or &quot;ARWY NV&quot;. Belgian Combats of the years 1970-90s come with stitched rubber soles.
Later pattern made by Urban Body Protection International and come with British type &quot;tyre tread&quot; soles.

===France===
Combat boots of the French army are nicknamed &quot;rangers&quot; because of their similarity to the M 43 American model. Since the end of World War 2, three models have been manufactured. The first model was based on the 1952 combat ankle-boots on which a leather high-top cuff with two buckles were added. It was made of sturdy but very stiff brown colored cowhide leather. It was called and was widely distributed from 1956 on, in priority to airborne troops engaged in Algeria. In 1961, a simplified version was introduced, the boot and the leather cuff being made in one piece. In 1965 a new version of the 1961 model was introduced made of shined black grained leather more flexible than the original one. Their soles were of a direct molded type. In 1986 a transitory model with laces and enhanced waterproofing was experimented with under the designation &quot;combat boots model F 2&quot; but was not adopted. The first two models had to be blackened with colored grease and shoe polish. They were issued to French soldiers; including Foreign legionnaires, until the beginning of the 1990s, and then were kept in store in case of conflict. A lot of them have been released on the market after the gendarmerie dropped the territorial defense mission at the beginning of the 21st century. A winter model, with laces and a Gore-Tex lining was introduced in 1998. The third model and a winter model are still in service in the French army but are progressively being replaced in operation by more modern Meindl type boots.

By the end of the 2000s, following the FÉLIN equipment program, the venerable Mle 1965 pattern was replaced by a Gore-Tex boot designed by Meindl (based on Meindl &quot;Army Pro&quot; tactical boot and itself derived from &quot;Island&quot; civilian boots) as the main army boot. The boot is known as (Felin boot) and, while there are several contractor beyond Meindl for the actual production of the design including historical French boot provider Argueyrolles, the design is colloquially known as &quot;the Meindl&quot;. Progressive replacement of Mle 65 was planned starting with combat units sent on missions abroad. In 2014, the German company Haix won the contract to supply French army standard issue shoes with its Nepal Pro model.
===India===
The leather combat boots used by the Indian Army &quot;remained unchanged in design for 130 years&quot;, other than the addition of a directly moulded sole. Combat boots were manufactured exclusively by the India&#x27;s Ordnance Factories Board. In 2017, the Ministry of Defence authorized procurement of combat boots from private companies. The Defence Research and Development Organisation is also developing boots which will enable the tracking of soldiers in snowy locations.

===Norway===
The current combat boot used by the Norwegian Armed Forces is the M77. It was introduced in 1977 and is produced by Samelin AS, originally designed for the Finnish Defence Forces.
The M77 boot took ten years to develop and strict requirements were set for weight, durability, water resistance, comfort, as well as ease of maintenance and good heat resistance to facilitate quicker drying.
The Norwegian army frequently test boots from other manufacturers, but they have not made any plans to change boots for their soldiers. The M77 boot has notches along the sole and in the heel made for the NATO issue skis used by the Norwegian Armed Forces. The bindings for these skis fit the M77 boots as well as the thick waterproof outer shoes they can be put in. The boots can also be used for snowshoes.
===Russia===

The Imperial Russian Army used jackboots (called &quot;sapogi&quot;) until mid-World War One when it adopted ankle boots with puttees as did both side of the Russian Civil War. The Soviet army used ankleboots with puttees, and then jackboots until the end of its existence and which continued into the Russian Army of today where they are currently mainly used for public duties such as parades and ceremonies. At the end of 2007, the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation announced a transition from jackboots to combat boots (Ru:Военные ботинки). The transition process was delayed, among other reasons, for financial reasons: combat boots cost more than jackboots and wear out faster.

===Sweden===
The military started using boots in 1779. The current model is boot mod. 90 that is designed to be both comfortable and light as well as giving ankle support. They are part of the UNI (Uniform) 90 combat uniform system and are available in a lighter summer version and an insulated winter version with a heavier sole, designed for skiing, using Swedish standard army wood skis.
===Switzerland===
The Swiss Armed Forces use three models of combat boots. The KS 90 (from the German ), made from black leather and with a flat sole and used for marching on paved roads. The KS14 (&#x27;heavy&#x27;), made by the Italian company AKU, is a heavy duty combat boot specially designed for the Swiss Army but also sold to civilians, with metal inserts to protect the foot. Every soldier receives, at the beginning of boot camp, two pairs of KS90 and one pair of KS14. Special Forces corpsmen are outfitted with another custom made boot, developed by the German Meindl for the Swiss Army, the KS08 Schwer AGFA. The KS08 is suitable for every environment, for parachute jumps and fast roping. It allows the mounting of crampons for rock climbing and, like the KS14, it has metal inserts to protect the feet. The army will introduce new boots (KS19 and KS19 ) in the near future.

===South Africa===
Members of The South African National Defense Force (SANDF) are issued brown or black combat boots with 18 lace holes, pimple print leather and stitched rubber soles. The brown boots are worn by members of the South African Army and South African Military Health Service, whereas the black boots are worn by members of the South African Air Force and the South African Navy.

Paratroopers (Parabats) wear a variant known as &quot;Jumpers&quot;. These boots are taller, having 22 lace holes, and are heavier, due to the steel plate housed within their double soles. The steel plate prevents the foot from flexing during hard landings when parachuting. They are usually polished with red polish. The colour combination of the brown leather with the red polish creates a shade of maroon that matches their maroon berets.

Special Forces (Recces) are issued tan half-combat boots known as &quot;Waxies.&quot;
These boots are an evolution of the old Rhodesian anti-tracking boots. 
The boots are ankle height, having 12 lace holes and an ankle strap at the top which is fastened with a buckle. The leather is thin and breathable and has a smooth wax finish, hence the name. The boots are lightweight, and have stitched rubber anti-tracking soles. These soles are completely flat, leaving behind shallow footprints that appear old and faded.

===Singapore===
The Singapore Armed Forces has a few models of combat boots currently produced for its servicemen, namely the Army Combat Boot (ACB), Enhanced Combat Boot (ECB), RSAF Combat Safety Boot, and RSN Combat Safety Boot.

New enlistees are generally issued the ACB, of which there are two variations, one manufactured by Wellco Peruana, a Peruvian brand, and another manufactured by Altama, a United States brand. Both variations have a near-identical construction, with variations in quality. They feature a part-leather, part-fabric construction for breathability, directly molded soles, and two holes that allow drainage of any water that may have entered. The outsoles are designed to suit jungle environments. These boots are similar in design to the U.S. Army hot weather combat boots and jungle boots.

The ECB is the Spartan XTB by Magnum, and is issued to more combat focused units in the Singapore Army, such as the infantry, armoured infantry, guards, and commandos. It has a hybrid leather-fabric upper like the ACB, but with lighter weight, fully stitched cupsoles, and an outsole design that is more suited for both urban and jungle environments.

Both the ACB and the ECB have been in use since December 2016.

Past versions of boots issued within the Singapore Armed Forces include a full leather upper boot with a reinforced toecap (in service until 1993), an improved version that removed the reinforced toecap, reducing weight, and had improved insoles that provided more support and offered better hygiene (in service 1993–2002), the &#x27;Gore-Tex&#x27; boots, a revised design with parts of the upper made of Gore-Tex, making it waterproof (in service 2002–2012), and the &#x27;Frontier&#x27; boots (named after the manufacturer), of which the Gore-Tex material was replaced with a porous nylon fabric for quick drying, and featured water drainage holes, thus no longer making the boots waterproof (in service 2012–2016). The Frontier boots also had a redesigned sole that was supposed to give improved agility and comfort.

The Frontier boots had received criticism from some Singapore Army reserve conscripts who were previously issued the Gore-Tex boots. Unlike its predecessor, the Gore-Tex boots, which were padded and waterproof, the Frontier boots did not feature the padding, and instead had an added ankle support strip, which some servicemen claimed made the boot more uncomfortable. The revised design also lost its waterproof properties, which also drew criticism. However, it allowed water to drain out of the boot after a river-crossing. Also, the boot became more ventilated and thus cooler with the revised design. Durability was also an issue in both the second Generation Gore-Tex and also some batches of the Frontiers. At times, the sole of the boot will come apart since it is only glued to the shell of the boot and not stitched. Some servicemen would also find their Frontier boots&#x27; stitching coming apart after some weeks of usage, or even the soles disintegrating and cracking after prolonged use or storage. The succeeding ACB addressed the durability issue with directly molded soles, and is also purportedly more comfortable.

Non-combat ground crew and airbase personnel of the Republic of Singapore Air Force are issued the RSAF Combat Safety Boots, manufactured by Frontier, for use in airbases. The RSAF boots feature padded sides, an outsole that is more suited to urban environments, a side-zip with a Velcro fastener, and a composite toe. Aircrew are instead issued the 800ST flight boots by Belleville that are waterproof, have a full leather upper, are steel-toed, and have a similar design to the U.S. Army temperate weather combat boots, albeit with different materials. Personnel in the combat focused &#x27;Ground Based Air Defence&#x27; units, along with security troopers tasked to guard airbases, are issued boots and uniforms as if they were in the army.

The Republic of Singapore Navy servicemen are issued the modified version of the RSAF&#x27;s safety boots. The modifications include the two water outlets (similar to the Singapore Army&#x27;s standard issue boots), and a reduction in height from a high-cut boot to a mid-cut.

===Spain===
Before 1979, the Spanish army had issued triple-buckled boots, with full lace-up boots becoming common from 1984 to 1986. During the 1980s Spain changed boot suppliers and had many variations of design including Vibram or Panamá sole, buckles or laces, and eyelets or speed lace. There were three common models:

*Regular – The general-issue boot used for instruction and campaign, it had a medium sole thickness and a few cleats. Smooth-soled versions fell into disuse over time, leaving only the instruction and campaign model.
*Walking – A lighter-constructed version of the regular boot with no cleats. It had a distinctive peculiarity as a boot to wear comfortably in the street, on flat ground, and was commonly known as (crude or vulgar) for its thin soles.
*Paratrooper – A boot exclusive to paratrooper units. It lacked the issue triple buckles (due to the hazard of hooking the parachute lines), and was slightly higher with extra shin-to-foot support and reinforced toe and heel.

This was the general approach in the late 1970s and early 1980s. During this period the manufacturer, Segarra, had various major problems which prevented regular deliveries on their supply contract with the Ministry of Defence. This eventually led to Segarra&#x27;s closure, with Imipiel chosen as an alternative provider.

Imipiel-manufactured boots were copies of the Segarra models but proved to be inferior, with poorly-attached soles that opened and peeled-off with relative ease, greatly shortening their useful lifetime. In an attempt to overcome the debonding problem, Imipiel changed the outsole, removing the cleats, and incorporated &quot;Panama&quot; type soles.

The Ministry initiated parallel studies for the final adoption of a new model boot, accepting new concepts on the original boot of instruction and campaign and benefits of the paratrooper-styled boot.

===United Kingdom===

During the First World War, the British army introduced a variation of ammunition boot designated Boots, Type B5. These were made from brown leather and generally lacked toecaps. They featured hobnailed soles.

The British Army introduced the DMS (Direct Moulded Sole) ankle boot in 1958. This had a moulded plastic sole and was externally similar to the World War II Ammunition Boot. However, they featured a low sideless tongue which allowed water to get in over the top of the foot. Once water had got into the boot, it would evaporate through the top of the boot but not through the plastic sole, thereby keeping the foot wet and accelerating the development of trench foot. Although mesh insoles were issued to combat this, they were themselves fragile and could lead to &#x27;burning&#x27; of the sole of the foot, with the result that most soldiers used commercially available sports-shoe insoles instead. This type of boot continued in service until the mid-1980s, after its unsatisfactory characteristics became a matter of public concern owing to the severe cases of trench foot incurred during the Falklands War. The DMS boot was worn with anklets or wind-around puttees.

The immediate successor of the DMS boot was the &quot;Boot, Combat, High&quot; (BCH). These were essentially the DMS boots, but made of smooth leather (as opposed to pebble grain leather), lacking toecaps and extended up to the calf. The design of the boots could cause acute tendonitis. A MkII version was introduced to solve this. One advantage was that it was not supposed to be &#x27;bulled&#x27; to a mirror shine.

The Combat Assault Boots (CAB) were current issue until 2012, and were used primarily for combat training and general service, although privately purchased boots were often deemed acceptable as long as they were made of black leather. The Foot Guards still use modified ammunition boots. These boots, being primarily made of leather, can be brought to a high shine for the ceremonial purpose, although boots used as every-day military footwear tend to be left comparatively dull, but clean.

Various levels of shine can be achieved with CAB. However, when on exercise (in the field) or on operations, soldiers are only required to shine their boots to combat high.

Jungle boots supplied by various manufacturers are also commonly worn in barracks due to the ability to carry out loaded marches faster and for longer.

From 2012 Armed Forces personnel have a newly designed range of brown combat boots to replace the black and desert combat footwear they previously wore. Personnel have the choice of five different boots depending on where they are based and what role they are in.

* Desert Combat – worn by dismounted troops conducting medium to high levels of activity in desert type environments with temperatures exceeding 40 degrees Celsius.
* Desert Patrol – worn by drivers/armoured troops conducting lower levels of activity in desert type environments exceeding 40 degrees Celsius.
* Temperate Combat – worn by dismounted troops for medium to high levels of activity in temperate (European) climates.
* Patrol – worn by mounted troops (drivers/armoured troops) taking part in lower levels of activity in temperate (European) climates.
* Cold Wet Weather – worn by dismounted troops for medium to high levels of activity in temperatures down to –20 degrees Celsius.

Each of the five boot types comes in two different styles, so personnel can wear whichever one is more comfortable for them. The new brown boots, which have been developed to match the MTP uniform worn by Service personnel, are made in two different fittings designed for the first time to take account of the different shapes of men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s feet. The previous black boots continued being worn with most non-camouflage uniforms as well as by units on parade in full dress uniform, such as regiments performing ceremonial duties in central London.

As of 2018, the five categories previously issued were changed to simplify the choices available. The Italian manufacturer AKU now supply their Pilgrim model as an option for a high liability boot alongside Altberg.

===United States===
The 1917 Trench Boot was an adaptation of the boots American manufacturers were selling to the French and Belgian armies at the beginning of World War I. In American service, it replaced the Russet Marching Shoe. The boot was made of tanned cowhide with a half middle sole covered by a full sole. Iron plates were fixed to the heel. It was a great improvement, however it lacked waterproofing. It soon evolved into the 1918 Trench Boot, also called the Pershing Boot after General John Pershing, who oversaw its creation. The boot used heavier leather in its construction, and had several minor changes from the 1917 Boot.

The first true modern combat boots in the US Army, officially titled &quot;Boots, Combat Service&quot;, were introduced in conjunction with the M-1943 Uniform Ensemble during World War II. They were modified service shoes, with an extended, rough-out or, more commonly, a smooth leather high-top cuff added. The cuff was closed using two buckles, allowing the boots to replace the existing service shoes and leggings worn by most soldiers with a more convenient and practical solution. The boots, and the service shoes from which they were made, had a one piece sole and heel, made from molded synthetic or reclaimed rubber. These &quot;double buckle&quot; boots were worn through the Korean War as a substitute for the Boots, Russet, Leather Lace Up introduced in 1948. The first type of Combat Boots, or Combat Tropical boots were based on the &quot;buckle boot&quot; design and worn during the early parts of the Vietnam War.


In 1957, the US Army switched to shined black combat boots, although the transition to black boots was not completed until late in the Vietnam War, which also saw the introduction of the jungle boot. Both of these boots had a direct molded sole. The jungle boot had a black leather lower and an olive drab canvas (later nylon) upper. Black boots continued to be worn following Vietnam, with the M81 BDU, although non-shine boots were considered by the Army. As the BDU was replaced with the MCCUU, Army Combat Uniform, and Airman Battle Uniform the services moved to more practical, non-shine footwear. The only current military service mandating shined black combat boots are the United States Naval Sea Cadet Corps, the Auxiliary Cadet Detachment of the Naval forces, and the Civil Air Patrol, the Auxiliary of the U.S. Air Force, in conjunction with the BDU utility uniform.

As the United States Marine Corps made the transition from its utility uniform to the MCCUU, they discarded shined black combat boots, and switched to more functional tan rough-out (non-shine) combat boots, with either hot weather or temperate weather versions. The standard-issue boot is the Bates Waterproof USMC combat boot. Commercial versions of this boot are authorized without limitation other than they must be at least in height and bear the Eagle, Globe, and Anchor on the outer heel of each boot. Beginning on October 1, 2016, Marine Corps personnel were authorized to wear various Marine Corps Combat Boot models from Danner, Belleville, McRae and Bates, and Rugged all-terrain boots from Danner.

The United States Army followed suit in 2002 with the introduction of the Army Combat Uniform, which also switched to tan rough-out combat boots, called the Army Combat Boot, and cotton socks. Commercial versions of this boot are authorized without limitation other than they must be at least eight inches in height and are no longer authorized to have a &#x27;shoe-like&#x27; appearance. Two versions exist: a temperate weather boot, and a hot weather (desert) boot. Current manufacturers include (but are not limited to) Altama, Bates, Belleville Boot, McRae, Rocky, Warson Brands/Converse, and Wellco.

The US Air Force used a sage green suede combat boot with its Airman Battle Uniform, although a tan version was authorized until 2011, when the green boot became mandatory. The Airman Battle Uniform was phased out in 2021 and replaced with the Army Combat Uniform in Operational Camouflage Pattern, with the boots authorized only in Coyote Brown.

==Fashion==
Combat boots are popular as fashion clothing primarily in the gothic, punk, grunge, heavy metal, industrial, skinhead, and BDSM fashions, and as work boots, but are becoming more and more mainstream. Beyond fashion as such, many individuals choose to wear combat boots simply due to durability, comfort and other utilities, as the boots are specifically designed to be comfortable to wear in a variety of changing conditions for long durations without significant long-term wear. Combat boots have a longer lifespan than fashion boots, which can give them a vintage feel, even after recrafting. For these and other reasons, they can be purchased at military surplus stores.

<doc id="1334769" wikidata="Q834516" url="?curid=1334769" title="Etymology of electricity">
<text>The word &quot;electricity&quot; derives from Neo-Latin and ultimately Greek. It first appears in English in Francis Bacon&#x27;s writings. Depending on context, the word may refer to &quot;electric charge&quot;, &quot;electric power&quot; or &quot;electric energy&quot;.

==Historical drift==
===Pre-English origins===
The Neo-Latin adjective , originally meaning &#x27;of amber&#x27;, was first used to refer to amber&#x27;s attractive properties by William Gilbert in his 1600 text De Magnete. The term came from the classical Latin , &#x27;amber&#x27;, from the Greek (), &#x27;amber&#x27;. The origin of the Greek word is unknown, but there is speculation that it might have come from a Phoenician word , meaning &#x27;shining light&#x27;.

===Entry into English===
The word &quot;electric&quot; was first used by Francis Bacon to describe materials like amber that attracted other objects. The first usage of the English word &quot;electricity&quot; is ascribed to Sir Thomas Browne in his 1646 work, &quot;Pseudodoxia Epidemica&quot;:

In this context, an &quot;Electrick&quot; or &quot;Electrick body&quot; was a non-conductor, or an object capable of attracting &quot;light bodies&quot; (like bits of paper) when excited by friction; a piece of amber is &quot;an Electrick&quot;, while a piece of iron is not. &quot;Electricity&quot;, then, was simply the property of behaving like an electric, in the same way that &quot;elasticity&quot; is the property of behaving like an elastic. (&quot;Electric&quot; continued to be used as a noun until at least 1913 and is still used in this sense in the word &quot;dielectric&quot;.)

It was not until later that the definition shifted to refer to the &quot;cause&quot; of the attraction instead of the property of being attractive.

&quot;Charge&quot;, in the electrical sense, was first used in 1748.

== &quot;Quantity of electricity&quot; ==

The term quantity of electricity was once common in scientific publications. It appears frequently in the writings of Franklin, Faraday, Maxwell, Millikan, and J. J. Thomson, and was even occasionally used by Einstein.

However, over the last hundred years the term &quot;electricity&quot; has been used by electric utility companies and the general public in a non-scientific way. Today the vast majority of publications no longer refer to electricity as meaning electric charge. Instead they speak of electricity as electromagnetic energy. The definition has drifted even further, and many authors now use the word &quot;electricity&quot; to mean electric current (amperes), energy flow (watts), electrical potential (volts), or electric force. Others refer to any electrical phenomena as kinds of electricity.

These multiple definitions are probably the reason that &quot;quantity of electricity&quot; has fallen into disfavor among scientists. Physics textbooks no longer define &quot;quantity of electricity&quot; or &quot;flow of electricity&quot;. &quot;Quantity of electricity&quot; is now regarded as an archaic usage, and it has slowly been replaced by the terms &quot;charge of electricity&quot;, then &quot;quantity of electric charge&quot;, and today simply &quot;charge&quot;. Since the term &quot;electricity&quot; has increasingly become corrupted by contradictions and unscientific definitions, today&#x27;s experts instead use the term &quot;charge&quot; to remove any possible confusion.

<text>The Green Brain (1966), initially published as Greenslaves, is a science fiction novel by American writer Frank Herbert.

== Plot introduction ==
The book is set in the not-so-distant future, where humankind has all but succeeded in controlling all life on the planet and almost completely wiping out all insect life. The earth is divided into a &quot;Green Zone&quot; which humans totally dominate (or so they believe) and a diminishing &quot;Red Zone&quot; that is not yet conquered.

The &quot;Green Brain&quot; of the title is an intelligent organism that embodies and arises from nature&#x27;s resistance to human domination. It is able to command social insects to form humanoid-shaped collective organisms which it uses to infiltrate the &quot;Green Zone&quot;.

The book is about a small team sent into the jungles of Brazil to investigate the problem, who find out that some of their assumptions were wrong.

==Reception==
David Pringle described the novel as &quot;a giant-insect story, full of grotesquerie and done with verve&quot;. Pringle rated the novel two stars out of four. 

==Adaptation==
By the time of Herbert&#x27;s death, arrangements also had been made to make a movie adaptation of the novel.

<doc id="1334796" wikidata="Q116265654" url="?curid=1334796" title="Lorteburn">
<text>The Lorteburn or Langbourne is a lost stream or river, which ran in the east of the City of London, arising near to Aldgate, flowing south near to the Tower of London, and discharging into the River Thames. The stream appears to have been covered over or dry by the early 14th century but its course has been discovered during archaeological digs in the area and the watershed can be traced in the street level contours of that part of the city as mapped by Kelsey in 1841. The stream gave its name to the Langbourn ward of the city. The river is seldom included on maps or lists of London&#x27;s lost rivers, and its existence is denied by Nicholas Barton, in his 1962 book &quot;Lost Rivers of London&quot;, but in more recent work David Bentley argues for its existence.

== Toponymy ==
The name &quot;Lorteburn&quot; is attested in a deed of 1288, when the stream was still extant. The name &quot;Langbourne&quot; is attested in Stow in 1603, when it had been dry for nearly two centuries.
In &quot;English River Names&quot;, Eilert Ekwall identifies several instances of Lorteburn. He gives the derivation as from an Old English word meaning dirt or filth. Related to the Old Norse &quot;lortr&quot; (&quot;excrement, faeces&quot;), this implies a dirty or filthy stream, possibly one used for a sewer.

There is a second possibility given by Ekwall, a derivation from either the brook name &quot;Hlōra&quot;, or the mythical Norse female name &quot;Hlóra&quot;. The brook name derived from the Old English &quot;hlōwan&quot; meaning &quot;The roaring one&quot;. This implies a swift stream with foaming water. This derivation may seem unlikely given the short length of the stream, but the watercourse was steep, and &#x27;roaring&#x27; does correspond with Stow&#x27;s description.

Burn or Bourne is a standard name for smaller streams and river, common in the area of London, for example the nearby rivers Ravensbourne, Tyburn and Westbourne. In place names it normally means &#x27;stream&#x27;.

== Archaeological evidence ==
In 1981, David Bentley assembled evidence for the stream&#x27;s existence, relying on archaeological and map evidence, especially in the records of the Museum of London. He first points out there is a shallow linear valley in that part of the city, first identified by Richard Kelsey&#x27;s topographical survey in 1841. The topography of this part of London has been changed almost beyond recognition since the 1841 survey, especially by the construction of the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway and its terminus at Fenchurch Street railway station, and thus this valley can no longer be seen in the modern contours.

Bentley then goes on to provide detailed evidence for the Lorteburn&#x27;s existence. Archaeological evidence has identified dried stream beds in this part of the city. Discoveries include:
* Mariner House, Crutched Friars (Peter Marsden 1963-4) a small stream in the natural gravels, on an east to west alignment.
* 2-4 Jewry Street (Peter Rowsome 1980) a stream in a section cutting through the natural brickearth, on a north to south alignment.
* Rangoon Street (David Bowler 1982) two stream-beds were observed following differing courses.

Bentley interprets this evidence as &lt;q&gt;a stream called the Lorteburn recorded east of Seething Lane in the late 13th century.&lt;/q&gt;

== Early references ==
Bentley has identified that:
A very different course is described in 1603 by John Stow, giving the name as &#x27;Langborne&#x27; and describing the route as running along Fenchurch Street, Lombard Street, and Sherbourn Lane. Stow states that the river gave its name to the Langbourn ward of the City of London. The stream was either covered over or dry by his time.

In 1770 John Noorthouck gives a similar description to Stow, with some additional details.

The church of St Katherine Coleman is indeed at the head of the course of the Lorteburn described by Bentley, but the rest of Stow and Noorthuck&#x27;s descriptions are problematic given that they would require the water to flow uphill in the vicinity of Mincing Lane (see below).

== Nicholas Barton&#x27;s disbelief ==
The 1962 book &quot;Lost Rivers of London&quot; by Nicholas Barton is considered by many to be the foundational work on London rivers. Barton refutes the existence of the Langbourne for three reasons:
# &quot;It does not fit in with the contours, and actually involves the proposed stream&#x27;s flowing uphill to the extent of three feet, both in the ancient and modern ground levels.&quot; 
# &quot;During the construction of the Gracechurch Street sewer the builders specifically looked for it and found no traces.&quot;
# &quot;Stow more or less admits that he himself has nothing more to go on than the name.&quot;
Barton&#x27;s denial of the stream thus rests on Stowe&#x27;s description, which describes a route far to the west of the one proposed by Bentley.

== Inclusion on modern maps ==
The Lorteburn is included on some modern maps of Roman Londinium and early Medieval London.
