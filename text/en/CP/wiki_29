<text>Kuch Naa Kaho (Hindi: कुछ ना कहो, translation: &quot;Don&#x27;t Say Anything&quot;) is a 2003 Indian Hindi-language romantic drama film directed by Rohan Sippy (in his directorial debut), starring Aishwarya Rai, Abhishek Bachchan and Arbaaz Khan. It was released on 26 August 2003. This title of the film is based on a song from the film &quot;1942: A Love Story&quot; (1994).

==Plot==

Raj (Abhishek Bachchan) is a happy and free-spirited Indian-American bachelor living with his mother (Suhasini Mulay) who visits his ancestral homeland in Mumbai, to attend his cousin Nikki&#x27;s (Meghna Malik) wedding. Once in India, he finds himself pushed towards marriage by his overzealous uncle (Satish Shah). His uncle&#x27;s employee, Namrata (Aishwarya Rai) chaperones Raj on a series of setups and dates, all of which he deliberately sabotages. During the wedding ceremonies, Raj discovers that he is falling for Namrata. After some deliberation, he decides to tell her, but to his surprise, he discovers she has a 7-year-old son, Aditya.

Raj is confused but forms a strong fatherly relationship with Aditya. Raj&#x27;s uncle informs him that Namrata&#x27;s husband disappeared right before Aditya&#x27;s birth, and has never returned to his son or wife. Finding a letter that Raj had written confessing his feelings, Namrata gets upset thinking Raj tried to use her son to get close to her. She attempts to distance herself from him, but a stubborn Raj follows her to Aditya&#x27;s boarding school, having promised the boy to pose as his father. On being prodded by Raj, she tells him that her husband Sanjeev left her for another woman whilst she was pregnant. Namrata and Raj begin to bond.

After some months, Raj decides to introduce Namrata to his mother. A short while later, he finds out that Sanjeev (Arbaaz Khan) has returned and is looking to reconcile with Namrata. Namrata is aghast and makes it clear that she does not want anything to do with him. Sanjeev refuses to leave, becoming stubborn and persistent, threatening her with a lawsuit for custody of Aditya. This puts Namrata on the path of reconciliation with Sanjeev.

After a chance meeting, Raj invites Sanjeev to his home for the wedding. Aditya is present and is affectionate with Raj, calling him &quot;Dad.&quot; Sanjeev becomes jealous and angry, insulting Raj and his family. After witnessing Sanjeev&#x27;s bad behaviour towards Raj, Namrata finally gets the courage to stand up to him. She publicly tells him off and also admits her feelings. Sanjeev is ashamed and disappears once again, warning Raj to not make the mistakes he made with his family.

<doc id="1326107" wikidata="Q5788637" url="?curid=1326107" title="Steady state">
<text>In systems theory, a system or a process is in a steady state if the variables (called state variables) which define the behavior of the system or the process are unchanging in time. In continuous time, this means that for those properties &quot;p&quot; of the system, the partial derivative with respect to time is zero and remains so:
: formula_1
In discrete time, it means that the first difference of each property is zero and remains so:
: formula_2
The concept of a steady state has relevance in many fields, in particular thermodynamics, economics, and engineering. If a system is in a steady state, then the recently observed behavior of the system will continue into the future. In stochastic systems, the probabilities that various states will be repeated will remain constant. For example, see &quot;&quot; for the derivation of the steady state.

In many systems, a steady state is not achieved until some time after the system is started or initiated. This initial situation is often identified as a transient state, start-up or warm-up period. For example, while the flow of fluid through a tube or electricity through a network could be in a steady state because there is a constant flow of fluid or electricity, a tank or capacitor being drained or filled with fluid is a system in transient state, because its volume of fluid changes with time.

Often, a steady state is approached asymptotically. An unstable system is one that diverges from the steady state. See for example Linear difference equation#Stability.

In chemistry, a steady state is a more general situation than dynamic equilibrium. While a dynamic equilibrium occurs when two or more reversible processes occur at the same rate, and such a system can be said to be in a steady state, a system that is in a steady state may not necessarily be in a state of dynamic equilibrium, because some of the processes involved are not reversible. In other words, dynamic equilibrium is just one manifestation of a steady state.

== Applications ==

=== Economics ===
A &quot;steady state economy&quot; is an economy (especially a national economy but possibly that of a city, a region, or the world) of stable size featuring a stable population and stable consumption that remain at or below carrying capacity. In the economic growth model of Robert Solow and Trevor Swan, the steady state occurs when gross investment in physical capital equals depreciation and the economy reaches economic equilibrium, which may occur during a period of growth.

=== Electrical engineering ===
In electrical engineering and electronic engineering, &quot;steady state&quot; is an equilibrium condition of a circuit or network that occurs as the effects of transients are no longer important. Steady state is also used as an approximation in systems with on-going transient signals, such as audio systems, to allow simplified analysis of first order performance.

Sinusoidal Steady State Analysis is a method for analyzing alternating current circuits using the same techniques as for solving DC circuits.

The ability of an electrical machine or power system to regain its original/previous state is called Steady State Stability.

The stability of a system refers to the ability of a system to return to its steady state when subjected to a disturbance. As mentioned before, power is generated by synchronous generators that operate in synchronism with the rest of the system. A generator is synchronized with a bus when both of them have same frequency, voltage and phase sequence. We can thus define the power system stability as the ability of the power system to return to steady state without losing synchronicity. Usually power system stability is categorized into steady state, transient and dynamic stability.

Steady State Stability studies are restricted to small and gradual changes in the system operating conditions. In this we basically concentrate on restricting the bus voltages close to their nominal values. We also ensure that phase angles between two buses are not too large and check for the overloading of the power equipment and transmission lines. These checks are usually done using power flow studies.

Transient Stability involves the study of the power system following a major disturbance. Following a large disturbance in the synchronous alternator the machine power (load) angle changes due to sudden acceleration of the rotor shaft. The objective of the transient stability study is to ascertain whether the load angle returns to a steady value following the clearance of the disturbance.

The ability of a power system to maintain stability under continuous small disturbances is investigated under the name of Dynamic Stability (also known as small-signal stability). These small disturbances occur due to random fluctuations in loads and generation levels. In an interconnected power system, these random variations can lead catastrophic failure as this may force the rotor angle to increase steadily.

Steady state determination is an important topic, because many design specifications of electronic systems are given in terms of the steady-state characteristics. Periodic steady-state solution is also a prerequisite for small signal dynamic modeling. Steady-state analysis is therefore an indispensable component of the design process.

In some cases, it is useful to consider constant envelope vibration—vibration that never settles down to motionlessness, but continues to move at constant amplitude—a kind of steady-state condition.

=== Chemical engineering ===
In chemistry, thermodynamics, and other chemical engineering, a &quot;steady state&quot; is a situation in which all state variables are constant in spite of ongoing processes that strive to change them. For an entire system to be at steady state, i.e. for all state variables of a system to be constant, there must be a flow through the system (compare mass balance). One of the simplest examples of such a system is the case of a bathtub with the tap open but without the bottom plug: after a certain time the water flows in and out at the same rate, so the water level (the state variable being Volume) stabilizes and the system is at steady state. Of course the Volume stabilizing inside the tub depends on the size of the tub, the diameter of the exit hole and the flowrate of water in. Since the tub can overflow, eventually a steady state can be reached where the water flowing in equals the overflow plus the water out through the drain.

A steady state flow process requires conditions at all points in an apparatus remain constant as time changes. There must be no accumulation of mass or energy over the time period of interest. The same mass flow rate will remain constant in the flow path through each element of the system. Thermodynamic properties may vary from point to point, but will remain unchanged at any given point.

=== Mechanical engineering ===

When a periodic force is applied to a mechanical system, it will typically reach a steady state after going through some transient behavior. This is often observed in vibrating systems, such as a clock pendulum, but can happen with any type of stable or semi-stable dynamic system. The length of the transient state will depend on the initial conditions of the system. Given certain initial conditions, a system may be in steady state from the beginning.

=== Biochemistry ===
In biochemistry, the study of biochemical pathways is an important topic. Such pathways will often display steady-state behavior where the chemical species are unchanging, but there is a continuous dissipation of flux through the pathway. Many, but not all, biochemical pathways evolve to stable, steady states. As a result, the steady state represents an important reference state to study. This is also related to the concept of homeostasis, however, in biochemistry, a steady state can be stable or unstable such as in the case of sustained oscillations or bistable behavior.

=== Physiology ===
Homeostasis (from Greek ὅμοιος, &quot;hómoios&quot;, &quot;similar&quot; and στάσις, &quot;stásis&quot;, &quot;standing still&quot;) is the property of a system that regulates its internal environment and tends to maintain a stable, constant condition. Typically used to refer to a living organism, the concept came from that of milieu interieur that was created by Claude Bernard and published in 1865. Multiple dynamic equilibrium adjustment and regulation mechanisms make homeostasis possible.

=== Fiber optics ===
In fiber optics, &quot;steady state&quot; is a synonym for equilibrium mode distribution.

=== Pharmacokinetics ===
In pharmacokinetics, steady state is a dynamic equilibrium in the body where drug concentrations consistently stay within a therapeutic limit over time.

<doc id="1326108" wikidata="Q76218" url="?curid=1326108" title="Eugen Herrigel">
<text>Eugen Herrigel (20 March 1884 – 18 April 1955) was a German philosopher who taught philosophy at Tohoku Imperial University in Sendai, Japan, from 1924 to 1929 and introduced Zen to large parts of Europe through his writings.

While living in Japan from 1924 to 1929, he was taught &quot;kyūdō&quot;, traditional Japanese archery, by Awa Kenzō (阿波研造:1880-1939), a master of archery and founder of his own religion known as &quot;The Great Doctrine of the Way of Shooting&quot;. Herrigel allegedly learned archery in the hope of better understanding Zen. Although Herrigel claimed to have studied archery for six years, he was only in Japan for slightly more five years and probably only studied archery for three of those years. During July 1929 he returned to Germany and was given a professorship in philosophy at the University of Erlangen. In a letter to the magazine &quot;Encounter&quot;, Gershom Scholem writes: &quot;Herrigel joined the Nazi Party after the outbreak of the war and some of his former friends in Frankfurt, who broke with him over this issue, told me about his career as a convinced Nazi, when I enquired about him in 1946. He was known to have stuck it out to the bitter end. This was not mentioned in some biographical notes on Herrigel published by his widow, who built up his image as one concerned with the higher spiritual sphere only.&quot; He also states in the same letter that he thinks this fact is evidence for the claim made by Arthur Koestler in the same magazine that Zen can be used to justify the politics of the Nazi party.

Eugen Herrigel was an active member of the Nazi organization Militant League for German Culture.

==Writings==
In 1936 he published a 20-page article describing his experiences entitled &quot;Die Ritterliche Kunst des Bogenschiessens&quot; (The Knightly Art of Archery) in the journal, &quot;Zeitschrift für Japanologie&quot;. This later formed the basis of his most famous work &quot;Zen in the Art of Archery&quot; (1948), which is perhaps one of the most influential works ever written on Zen in a European language.

Herrigel died in 1955. Among his papers were found voluminous notes on various aspects of Zen. These notes were selected and edited by Hermann Tausend in collaboration with Gusty L. Herrigel, the author&#x27;s wife (who studied Japanese flower arranging) and were published in German with the title &quot;Der Zen-Weg&quot; (The Zen-Way). This version was revised and edited by Alan Watts in 1960 and published by Vintage Press as &quot;The Method Of Zen&quot;.

==Dispute==
Yamada Shōji has demonstrated that Herrigel&#x27;s teacher, Awa Kenzō, never practiced Zen or even studied with a Zen master. While John Stevens has reproduced a photograph of a calligraphy by Awa that reads &quot;The Bow and Zen are One.&quot;, Yamada quotes Awa&#x27;s biographer Sakurai Yasunosuke, who wrote &quot;While Kenzō used the phrase &#x27;the bow and Zen are one&#x27; and used philosophical language of Mahāyāna Buddhism in particular to describe shadō, he did not approve of Zen unconditionally.&quot; Rather, Kenzō was emphasized establishing his own religion of archery and claimed he was doing missionary work in promoting it. Herrigel either intentionally or inadvertently misinterpreted Awa&#x27;s teachings as an expression of Zen.

Herrigel himself never really learned the Japanese language and instead relied on interpreters, who have since confessed that they seldom understood Awa&#x27;s cryptic phrases. Much of Herrigel&#x27;s understanding of Zen seems to have derived from the writings of D.T. Suzuki, the great lay popularizer of Zen Buddhism in the west. Suzuki himself seems to have agreed initially with Herrigel&#x27;s analysis, having written the introduction to an edition of &quot;Zen in the Art of Archery&quot;, but he wrote later that &quot;Herrigel is trying to get to Zen, but he hasn&#x27;t grasped Zen itself&quot;.

Volker Zotz revealed in his book, &quot;Auf den glückseligen Inseln&quot;, concerning Buddhism and German culture, that Eugen Herrigel was a strong advocate of the Nazi party. For his involvement with Nazism he was forbidden to teach at the University for three years after 1945.

<text>A spectroradiometer is a light measurement tool that is able to measure both the wavelength and amplitude of the light emitted from a light source. Spectrometers discriminate the wavelength based on the position the light hits at the detector array allowing the full spectrum to be obtained with a single acquisition. Most spectrometers have a base measurement of counts which is the un-calibrated reading and is thus impacted by the sensitivity of the detector to each wavelength. By applying a calibration, the spectrometer is then able to provide measurements of spectral irradiance, spectral radiance and/or spectral flux. This data is also then used with built in or PC software and numerous algorithms to provide readings or Irradiance (W/cm2), Illuminance (lux or fc), Radiance (W/sr), Luminance (cd), Flux (Lumens or Watts), Chromaticity, Color Temperature, Peak and Dominant Wavelength. Some more complex spectrometer software packages also allow calculation of PAR μmol/m2/s, Metamerism, and candela calculations based on distance and include features like 2- and 20-degree observer, baseline overlay comparisons, transmission and reflectance.

Spectrometers are available in numerous packages and sizes covering many wavelength ranges. The effective wavelength (spectral) range of a spectrometer is determined not only by the grating dispersion ability but also depends on the detectors&#x27; sensitivity range. Limited by the semiconductor&#x27;s band gap the silicon-based detector responds to 200-1100 nm while the InGaAs based detector is sensitive to 900-1700 nm (or out to 2500 nm with cooling).

Lab/Research spectrometers often cover a broad spectral range from UV to NIR and require a PC. There are also IR Spectrometers that require higher power to run a cooling system. Many Spectrometers can be optimized for a specific range i.e. UV, or VIS and combined with a second system to allow more precise measurements, better resolution, and eliminate some of the more common errors found in broadband system such as stray light and lack of sensitivity.

Portable devices are also available for numerous spectral ranges covering UV to NIR and offer many different package styles and sizes. Hand held systems with integrated displays typically have built in optics, and an onboard computer with pre-programmed software. Mini spectrometers are also able to be used hand held, or in the lab as they are powered and controlled by a PC and require a USB cable. Input optics may be incorporated or are commonly attached by a fiber optic light guide. There are also micro Spectrometers smaller than a quarter that can be integrated into a system, or used stand alone.

==Background==

The field of spectroradiometry concerns itself with the measurement of absolute radiometric quantities in narrow wavelength intervals. It is useful to sample the spectrum with narrow bandwidth and wavelength increments because many sources have line structures Most often in spectroradiometry, spectral irradiance is the desired measurement. In practice, the average spectral irradiance is measured, shown mathematically as the approximation:

: formula_1

Where formula_2 is the spectral irradiance, formula_3 is the radiant flux of the source (SI unit: watt, W) within a wavelength interval formula_4 (SI unit: meter, m), incident on the surface area, formula_5 (SI unit: square meter, m2). The SI unit for spectral irradiance is W/m3. However it is often more useful to measure area in terms of centimeters and wavelength in nanometers, thus submultiples of the SI units of spectral irradiance will be used, for example μW/cm2*nm

Spectral irradiance will vary from point to point on the surface in general. In practice, it is important note how radiant flux varies with direction, the size of the solid angle subtended by the source at each point on the surface, and the orientation of the surface. Given these considerations, it is often more prudent to use a more rigorous form of the equation to account for these dependencies

Note that the prefix &quot;spectral&quot; is to be understood as an abbreviation of the phrase &quot;spectral concentration of&quot; which is understood and defined by the CIE as the &quot;quotient of the radiometric quantity taken over an infinitesimal range on either side of a given wavelength, by the range&quot;.

==Spectral power distribution==
The spectral power distribution (SPD) of a source describes how much flux reaches the sensor over a particular wavelength and area. This effectively expresses the per-wavelength contribution to the radiometric quantity being measured. The SPD of a source is commonly shown as an SPD curve. SPD curves provide a visual representation of the color characteristics of a light source, showing the radiant flux emitted by the source at various wavelengths across the visible spectrum It is also a metric by which we can evaluate a light source&#x27;s ability to render colors, that is, whether a certain color stimulus can be properly rendered under a given illuminant.


==Sources of error==
The quality of a given spectroradiometric system is a function of its electronics, optical components, software, power supply, and calibration. Under ideal laboratory conditions and with highly trained experts, it is possible to achieve small (a few tenths to a few percent) errors in measurements. However, in many practical situations, there is the likelihood of errors on the order of 10 percent Several types of error are at play when taking physical measurements. The three basic types of error noted as the limiting factors of accuracy of measurement are random, systematic, and periodic errors 

* &quot;Random errors&quot; are variations about that mean. In the case of spectroradiometric measurements, this could be thought of as noise from the detector, internal electronics, or the light source itself. Errors of this type can be combated by longer integration times or multiple scans.
* &quot;Systematic errors&quot; are offsets to the predicted &quot;correct&quot; value. Systematic errors generally occur due to the human component of these measurements, the device itself, or the setup of the experiment. Things such as calibration errors, stray light, and incorrect settings, are all potential issues.
* &quot;Periodic errors&quot; arise from recurrent periodic or pseudo-periodic events. Variations in temperature, humidity, air-motion, or AC interference could all be categorized as periodic error.

In addition to these generic sources of error, a few of the more specific reasons for error in spectroradiometry include:

* The multidimensionality of the measurement. The output signal is dependent on several factors, including magnitude of measured flux, its direction, its polarization, and its wavelength distribution.
* The inaccuracy of measuring instruments, as well as the standards used to calibrate said instruments, cascaded to create a larger error throughout the entire measurement process, and
* The proprietary techniques for reducing multidimensionality and device instability error.

Gamma-scientific, a California-based manufacturer of light measurement devices, lists seven factors affecting the accuracy and performance of their spectroradiometers, due to either the system calibration, the software and power supply, the optics, or the measurement engine itself.

==Definitions==
=== Stray light ===
Stray light is unwanted wavelength radiation reaching the incorrect detector element. It generates erroneous electronic counts not related to designed spectral signal for the pixel or element of the detector array. It can come from light scatter and reflection of imperfect optical elements as well as higher order diffraction effects. The second order effect can be removed or at least dramatically reduced, by installing order sorting filters before the detector. 

A Si detector&#x27;s sensitivity to visible and NIR is nearly an order of magnitude larger than that in the UV range. This means that the pixels at the UV spectral position respond to stray light in visible and NIR much more strongly than to their own designed spectral signal. Therefore, the stray light impacts in UV region are much more significant as compared to visible and NIR pixels. This situation gets worse the shorter the wavelength. 

When measuring broad band light with small fraction of UV signals, the stray light impact can sometimes be dominant in the UV range since the detector pixels are already struggling to get enough UV signals from the source. For this reason, calibration using a QTH standard lamp can have huge errors (more than 100%) below 350 nm and a deuterium standard lamp is required for more accurate calibration in this region. In fact, absolute light measurement in the UV region can have large errors even with the correct calibration when majority of the electronic counts in these pixels is result of the stray light (longer wavelength strikes instead of the actual UV light).

=== Calibration errors ===
There are numerous companies that offer calibration for spectrometers, but not all are equal. It is important to find a traceable, certified laboratory to perform calibration. The calibration certificate should state the light source used (ex: Halogen, Deuterium, Xenon, LED), and the uncertainty of the calibration for each band (UVC, UVB, VIS..), each wavelength in nm, or for the full spectrum measured. It should also list the confidence level for the calibration uncertainty.

===Incorrect settings===
Like a camera, most spectrometers allow the user to select the exposure time and quantity of samples to be collected. Setting the integration time and the number of scans is an important step. Too long of an integration time can cause saturation. (In a camera photo this could appear as a large white spot, where as in a spectrometer it can appear as a dip, or cut off peak) Too short an integration time can generate noisy results (In a camera photo this would be a dark or blurry area, where as in a spectrometer this may appear are spiky or unstable readings).

The exposure time is the time the light falls on the sensor during a measurement. Adjusting this parameter changes the overall sensitivity of the instrument, as changing the exposure time does for a camera. The minimum integration time varies by instrument with a minimum of .5 msec and a maximum of about 10 minutes per scan. A practical setting is in the range of 3 to 999 ms depending on the light intensity.

The integration time should be adjusted for a signal which does not exceed the maximum counts (16-bit CCD has 65,536, 14-bit CCD has 16,384). Saturation occurs when the integration time is set too high. Typically, a peak signal of about 85% of the maximum is a good target and yields a good S/N ratio. (ex: 60K counts or 16K counts respectively)

The number of scans indicates how many measurements will be averaged. Other things being equal, the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of the collected spectra improves by the square root of the number N of scans averaged. For example, if 16 spectral scans are averaged, the SNR is improved by a factor of 4 over that of a single scan.

S/N ratio is measured at the input light level which reaches the full scale of the spectrometer. It is the ratio of signal counts Cs (usually at full scale) to RMS (root mean square) noise at this light level. This noise includes the dark noise Nd, the shot noise Ns related to the counts generated by the input light and read out noise. This is the best S/N ratio one can get from the spectrometer for light measurements.

==How it works==

The essential components of a spectroradiometric system are as follows:

*Input optics that gather the electromagnetic radiation from the source (Diffusers, Lenses, Fiber optic light guides)
*An entrance slit, determines how much light will enter the spectrometer. A smaller slit with have greater resolution, but less overall sensitivity
*Order sorting filters for reduction of second-order effects
*Collimator directs the light to the Grating or prism
*A grating or prism for dispersion of the light
*Focusing optics to align the light onto the Detector
*A detector, CMOS sensor or CCD array
*A control and logging system to define data and store it.

=== Input optics ===

The front-end optics of a spectroradiometer includes the lenses, diffusers, and filters that modify the light as it first enters the system. For Radiance an optic with a narrow field of view is required. For total flux an integrating sphere is required. For Irradiance cosine correcting optics are required. The material used for these elements determines what type of light is capable of being measured. For example, to take UV measurements, quartz rather than glass lenses, optical fibers, Teflon diffusers, and barium sulphate coated integrating spheres are often used to ensure accurate UV measurement.

=== Monochromator ===


To perform spectral analysis of a source, monochromatic light at every wavelength would be needed to create a spectrum response of the illuminant. A monochromator is used to sample wavelengths from the source and essentially produce a monochromatic signal. It is essentially a variable filter, selectively separating and transmitting a specific wavelength or band of wavelengths from the full spectrum of measured light and excluding any light that falls outside that region.

A typical monochromator achieves this through the use of entrance and exit slits, collimating and focus optics, and a wavelength-dispersing element such as a diffraction grating or prism. Modern monochromators are manufactured with diffraction gratings, and diffraction gratings are used almost exclusively in spectroradiometric applications. Diffraction gratings are preferable due to their versatility, low attenuation, extensive wavelength range, lower cost, and more constant dispersion. Single or double monochromators can be used depending on application, with double monochromators generally providing more precision due to the additional dispersion and baffling between gratings.

===Detectors===

The detector used in a spectroradiometer is determined by the wavelength over which the light is being measured, as well as the required dynamic range and sensitivity of the measurements. Basic spectroradiometer detector technologies generally fall into one of three groups: photoemissive detectors (e.g. photomultiplier tubes), semiconductor devices (e.g. silicon), or thermal detectors (e.g. thermopile).

The spectral response of a given detector is determined by its core materials. For example, photocathodes found in photomultiplier tubes can be manufactured from certain elements to be solar-blind – sensitive to UV and non-responsive to light in the visible or IR.

CCD (Charge Coupled Device) arrays typically one dimensional (linear) or two dimensional (area) arrays of thousands or millions of individual detector elements (also known as pixels) and CMOS sensors. They include a silicon or InGaAs based multichannel array detector capable of measuring UV, visible and near-infra light.

CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) sensors differs from a CCD in that they add an amplifier to each photodiode. This is called an active pixel sensor because the amplifier is part of the pixel. Transistor switches connect each photodiode to the intrapixel amplifier at the time of readout.

=== Control and logging system ===

The logging system is often simply a personal computer. In initial signal processing, the signal often needs to be amplified and converted for use with the control system. The lines of communication between monochromator, detector output, and computer should be optimized to ensure the desired metrics and features are being used. The commercially available software included with spectroradiometric systems often come stored with useful reference functions for further calculation of measurements, such as CIE color matching functions and the Vformula_6 curve.

==Applications==

Spectroradiometers are used in many applications, and can be made to meet a wide variety of specifications. Example applications include:

*Solar UV and UVB radiation
*LED measurement 
*Display measurement and calibration
*CFL testing
*Remote detection of oil slicks
*Plant research and development 
*Earth and planetary remote sensing
== DIY builds ==
It is possible to build a basic optical spectrometer using an optical disc grating and a basic webcam, using a CFL lamp for calibrating the wavelengths. A calibration using a source of known spectrum can then turn the spectrometer into a spectroradiometer by interpreting the brightness of photo pixels. A DIY build is affected by some extra error sources in the photo-to-value conversion: photographic noise (requiring dark frame subtraction) and non-linearity in the CCD-to-photograph conversion (possibly solved by a raw image format).

<doc id="1326121" wikidata="Q271565" url="?curid=1326121" title="Etruscan alphabet">
<text>The Etruscan alphabet was used by the Etruscans, an ancient civilization of central and northern Italy, to write their language, from about 700 BC to sometime around 100 AD.

The Etruscan alphabet derives from the Euboean alphabet used in the Greek colonies in southern Italy which belonged to the &quot;western&quot; (&quot;red&quot;) type, the so-called Western Greek alphabet. Several Old Italic scripts, including the Latin alphabet, derived from it (or simultaneously with it).
==Origins==
The Etruscan alphabet originated as an adaptation of the Euboean alphabet used by the Euboean Greeks in their first colonies in Italy, the island of Pithekoussai and the city of Cumae in Campania.
In the alphabets of the West, X had the , Ψ stood for ; in Etruscan: X = , Ψ = or (Rix 202–209).

The earliest known Etruscan &quot;abecedarium&quot; is inscribed on the frame of a wax tablet in ivory, measuring , found at Marsiliana (near Grosseto, Tuscany). It dates from about 700 BC, and lists 26 letters corresponding to contemporary forms of the Greek alphabet, including digamma, san and qoppa, but not omega, which had still not been added at the time.

==Letters==

The shapes of the Archaic Etruscan and Neo-Etruscan letters had a few variants, used in different places and/or in different epochs. Notably, opposite letters were used for and depending on the locality. Shown above are the glyphs from the Unicode Old Italic block, whose appearance will depend on the font used by the browser. These are oriented as they would be in lines written from left to right. Also shown are SVG images of variants shown as they would be written right to left, as in most of the actual inscriptions.

==Development==

The archaic form of the Etruscan alphabet remained practically unchanged from its origin in the 8th century BC until about 600 BC, and the direction of writing was free. From the 6th century BC, however, the alphabet evolved, adjusting to the phonology of the Etruscan language, and letters representing phonemes nonexistent in Etruscan were dropped. By 400 BC, it appears that all of Etruria was using the classical Etruscan alphabet of 20 letters, mostly written from right to left.
An additional sign , in shape similar to the numeral 8, transcribed as F, was present in Lydian, Neo-Etruscan and Italic alphabets of Osco-Umbrian languages such as Oscan, Umbrian, Old Sabine and South Picene (Old Volscian). This sign was introduced in Etruscan around 600–550 BC and was not present in the Marsiliana tablet, the earliest example of the Etruscan alphabet. It is thought that the sign may have been an altered B or H or an &quot;ex novo&quot; creation. Formerly it was even suspected to have been an Etruscan invention, but an early Sabellian inscription suggests that it is instead an invention of speakers of a Sabellian language (Osco-Umbrian languages). Its sound value was and it replaced the Etruscan digraph FH that was previously used to express that sound. Some letters were, on the other hand, falling out of use. Etruscan did not have any voiced stops, for which B, C, D were originally intended (, , and respectively). The B and D therefore fell out of use, and the C, which is simpler and easier to write than K, was adopted to write , mostly displacing K itself. Likewise, since Etruscan had no vowel sound, O disappeared and was replaced by U. In the course of its simplification, the redundant letters showed some tendency towards a semi-syllabary: C, K and Q were predominantly used in the contexts CE, KA, QU.

This classical alphabet remained in use until the 2nd century BC, when it began to be influenced by the rise of the Latin alphabet. Soon after, the Etruscan language itself became extinct — so thoroughly that its vocabulary and grammar are still only partly known, in spite of more than a century of intense research. The Romans, who did have voiced stops in their language, after taking over the archaic Etruscan alphabet in the 7th century BC, continued to use B and D for and , and used C for both and , until they invented a separate letter G to distinguish the two sounds.

==Legacy==
The Etruscan alphabet apparently was the immediate ancestor for the Latin alphabet, as well as of several Old Italic scripts used in Italy before the rise of Rome, such as those used in the Oscan, Umbrian, Lepontic, Rhaetian (or Raetic), Venetic, Messapian, North and South Picene, and Camunic inscriptions.

<doc id="1326128" wikidata="Q3177458" url="?curid=1326128" title="Louvre Inverted Pyramid">
<text>The Louvre Inverted Pyramid () is a skylight constructed in the Carrousel du Louvre, an underground shopping mall in front of the Louvre Museum in France. It may be thought of as a smaller sibling of the more famous Louvre Pyramid proper, yet turned upside down: its upturned base is easily seen from outside.

==Design==
The inverted pyramid marks the intersection of two main underground walkways beneath the Place du Carrousel and orients visitors towards the museum entrance under the Cour Napoléon. Tensioned against a , square steel caisson frame, the inverted pyramidal shape in laminated glass points downward towards the floor. The glass of the pyramid itself is thick, while the glass above the pyramid at courtyard (ground) level, which must be able to support the weight of pedestrians, is thick. The tip of the pyramid is suspended above floor level. Individual glass panes in the pyramid are connected by stainless-steel crosses in length. After dark, the structure is illuminated by a frieze of spotlights.

Directly below the tip of the downwards-pointing glass pyramid, a small stone pyramid (about ) is stationed on the floor, as if mirroring the larger structure above: The tips of the two pyramids almost touch.

The Pyramide Inversée was designed by architect I.M. Pei, and installed as part of the Phase II government renovation of the Louvre Museum, known as the Grand Louvre project. It was completed in 1993. In 1995, it was a finalist in the Benedictus Awards, described by the jury as &quot;a remarkable anti-structure ... a symbolic use of technology ... a piece of sculpture. It was meant as an object but it is an object to transmit light.&quot;

==&quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;==
The Inverted Pyramid figures prominently on the concluding pages of Dan Brown&#x27;s international bestseller &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;. The protagonist of the 2003 novel, Robert Langdon, reads esoteric symbolism into the two pyramids: The Inverted Pyramid is perceived as a Chalice, a feminine symbol, whereas the stone pyramid below is interpreted as a Blade, a masculine symbol: the whole structure could thus express the union of the sexes. Moreover, Brown&#x27;s protagonist concludes that the tiny stone pyramid is actually only the apex of a larger pyramid (possibly the same size as the inverted pyramid above), embedded in the floor as a secret chamber. This chamber is implied to enclose the body of Mary Magdalene.

At the climax of the 2006 film adaptation, the camera elaborately moves through the entire glass pyramid from above and then descends beneath the floor below to reveal the supposed hidden chamber under the tiny stone pyramid, containing the sarcophagus with the remains of Mary Magdalene.

In reality, the smaller stone pyramid does not form the tip of a larger pyramid. In fact, it can be pushed aside to facilitate maintenance and cleaning of the glass pyramid above.

<text>Alexander Fedorovich Mozhaysky (also transliterated as Mozhayski, Mozhayskii and Mozhayskiy; ) ( – ) was an admiral in the Imperial Russian Navy, an aviation pioneer, and a researcher and designer of heavier-than-air craft.

==Biography==
Mozhaysky was born in Rochensalm, in the Grand Duchy of Finland (present-day Kotka), southern Finland, then part of the Russian Empire. His father was an admiral in the Imperial Russian Navy, and Mozhaysky graduated from the Sea Cadet Corps in 1841. He spent the next seven years on voyages in the Baltic Sea and in the White Sea on various vessels, and was commissioned as a lieutenant in 1849. He served with the Baltic Fleet from 1850 to 1852. In 1853 he was selected as a member of Vice Admiral Yevfimy Putyatin’s expedition to the Far East. In August 1853, he demonstrated a working model of a steam engine to various Japanese dignitaries at Nagasaki, from which Japanese inventor Tanaka Hisashige was later able to reverse-engineer a Japanese version. In December 1854 he was shipwrecked at Heda, Shizuoka when the frigate &quot;Diana&quot; sank in the 1854 Ansei-Tōkai earthquake. Mozhaysky assisted in the construction of the schooner &quot;Heda&quot; in 1855, which enabled the Russian delegation negotiating the Treaty of Shimoda to return home. Later in 1855, during the Crimean War, he served in the Gulf of Finland on the brig &quot;Antenor&quot;.

In 1858 Mozhaysky was selected to participate in an expedition to Khiva in Central Asia, and published an account of the Aral Sea and the Amu Darya River. He was awarded the Order of St Vladimir, 4th class, for his participation in this expedition. After his return he was made a lieutenant-commander; however, he resigned his commission in 1863 with the downsizing of the Russian navy following the end (1856) of the Crimean War. From 1869 to 1876 he lived outside the city of Vinnytsia in what is now Ukraine.

Mozhaysky began work on a project to develop a heavier-than-air aircraft from 1876. 
Mozhaysky re-enlisted in the navy in 1879 and was granted the rank of captain, 1st class. He became an instructor at the Sea Cadet Corps. He was promoted to rear admiral in July 1882, but resigned shortly thereafter due to domestic reasons.
Approximately in 1884 Mozhaysky&#x27;s airplane made its first flight. His design relied upon a ramp rather than on engine power to generate sufficient speed for lift. The wing design of his craft lacked the curvature necessary to generate lift. While it is possible that Mozhaysky&#x27;s wings slowed his monoplane&#x27;s descent after launch from the ramp, the wings were unlikely ever to have provided sufficient lift for sustained flight unless used at angles of attack that would have been impractical, given the engines available to Mozhaysky. He also experimented with different angles of attack.

Mozhaysky died on April 1, 1890; his tomb is at the Smolensk Cemetery in Saint Petersburg.

==Legacy==
In 1909 a Russian newspaper claimed Mozhaysky&#x27;s hop was the first powered flight. This claim was later repeated in many Soviet publications. In 1971-1981 Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute researched the topic and disproved the claim. Mozhaysky&#x27;s original aircraft was found incapable of generating lift because of low engine capacity. It was also shown that with a more powerful engine, which Mozhaysky had planned shortly before his death, the aircraft might have been able to fly.

Nevertheless, Mozhaysky&#x27;s aviation achievements, particularly with regard to flight controls and propulsion, were considerable given the limits of the technology available to him, and have only recently received serious attention.

The A.F. Mozhaysky Military-Space Academy in St Peterburg and asteroid 2850 Mozhaiskij are named in his honour.

<doc id="1326143" wikidata="Q2011746" url="?curid=1326143" title="Nemo (song)">
<text>&quot;Nemo&quot; is the eighth single by Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish and the first from the album &quot;Once&quot;. A big-budget video was made for the song; the director was Antti Jokinen, who had previously worked with Shania Twain, Celine Dion and Eminem. The video was number one on MTV Brasil Video Chart. The song was nominated for the Kerrang! Award for Best Single. Although Nightwish already enjoyed a solid fan base in Europe and South America by the time of the single&#x27;s release, it is considered their breakthrough song since it helped them reach a wider audience.

The song can be heard in the ending credits of the 2005 film &quot;The Cave&quot;.

== Composition ==
Keyboardist and songwriter Tuomas Holopainen says the song was &quot;one of the most difficult songs&quot; the band&#x27;s ever done. It took them months to work on the arrangement. The first version was faster and two minutes longer, but recording engineer Tero Kinnunen suggested they cut off a certain section and slowed it down by about 10 bpm.

== Lyrics ==
Holopainen has stated that the title is Latin for &quot;nobody&quot; or &quot;no name&quot; and the song is based on his occasional feelings of being lost, longing for the past and feeling nameless. This contradicts speculations that the song simply borrows on a Nemo character of an earlier work, such as J. Verne&#x27;s Captain Nemo, Homer&#x27;s Ulysses alias Nemo, C. Dickens’ Captain Hawdon alias Nemo, W. McCay&#x27;s Little Nemo, or the Disney Studio&#x27;s film &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;. Asked about that, Holopainen responded:

In a 2016 interview, he said he &quot;was just a much darker person then than I am now&quot; and that he &quot;would never do a song like that again&quot;.

== Music video ==
The song received a video that cost around €80,000, which is much more than most heavy metal videos cost at that time. It was directed by Finnish director Antti Jokinen and shows the band performing among snowy mountains. Then vocalist Tarja Turunen is wearing a red coat, which she admits to be different from other symphonic metal female vocalists, who usually dress in black. A second version of the video included footage from &quot;The Cave&quot;.

The video was heavily played on TVs around the world, but according to Turunen, some channels were reluctant at first due to the video having been shot in the snow. Also, she said the video helped the band gain more attention from gothic fans, even though she doesn&#x27;t believe they have ever considered themselves to be a gothic band.

== Live performances ==
Nemo is the most played song by Nightwish, with well over 640 times as of August 2023. After Turunen left Nightwish, &quot;Nemo&quot; became one of the songs from the band that she would frequently perform live in her solo concerts.

== Track listings ==

==Personnel==
Personnel are adapted from the Nightwish website.
== Chart performance ==
&quot;Nemo&quot; topped the charts in Finland and Hungary; in the former country, it was the highest-selling single of 2004 from a domestic artist. In the United Kingdom, it charted at number 87, giving Nightwish their first chart entry, and peaked at number five on the UK Rock Chart. Elsewhere in Europe, the single became a top-10 hit in Germany and Norway and a top-20 hit in Austria, Sweden, and Switzerland. &quot;Nemo&quot; was certified platinum in Finland, selling 13,109 copies.

<doc id="1326144" wikidata="Q583338" url="?curid=1326144" title="Lake Poets">
<text>The Lake Poets were a group of English poets who all lived in the Lake District of England, United Kingdom, in the first half of the nineteenth century. As a group, they followed no single &quot;school&quot; of thought or literary practice then known. They were named, only to be uniformly disparaged, by the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot;. They are considered part of the Romantic Movement.

The three main figures of what has become known as the Lakes School were William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and Robert Southey. They were associated with several other poets and writers, including Dorothy Wordsworth, Charles Lamb, Mary Lamb, Charles Lloyd, Hartley Coleridge, John Wilson, and Thomas De Quincey.

==Origins and accuracy of the name==
The &quot;Lake Poet School&quot; (or &#x27;Bards of the Lake&#x27;, or the &#x27;Lake School&#x27;) was initially a derogatory term (&quot;the School of whining and hypochondriacal poets that haunt the Lakes&quot;, according to Francis Jeffrey as reported by Coleridge) that was also a misnomer, as it was neither particularly born out of the Lake District, nor was it a cohesive school of poetry. The principal members of the &#x27;group&#x27; were William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Robert Southey. Dorothy Wordsworth was an auxiliary member who was unpublished during her lifetime (her journals, letters, and poems were published posthumously), but she provided much of the inspiration for her brother William&#x27;s work.

There was a certain amount of additional irony involved in the &#x27;School&#x27;s&#x27; perception by readers, who were inspired, upon reading the poetry, to visit the area, thus helping to destroy, in the mind of Wordsworth at least, the very thing that made the Lakes special (although he himself ended up writing one of the best guides to the region). In addition, many of the first and second generation practitioners of Romantic poetry had a complex and not entirely easy relationship with the Lakes (apart from Wordsworth). &quot;For the most part other Romantic poets either struggle with a Lake Poet identity or come to define themselves against what the Lakes seem to offer in poetic terms.&quot;

==The Lake poets==

For Wordsworth, who settled at Dove Cottage, Grasmere, with his sister Dorothy after some years of wandering, the Lakes became bound up with his identity as a poet. Born and brought up on the fringes of the Lake District (at Cockermouth and Penrith), Wordsworth came back to the area in December 1799 and settled into a &#x27;poetic retirement&#x27; within his &#x27;native mountains.&#x27; Although Wordsworth did not &#x27;discover&#x27; the Lake District, nor was he the one who popularised it the most, he &quot;was destined to become one of the key attractions to the area, while his particular vision of his native landscape would have an enduring influence upon its future&quot;. Not just a &#x27;nature poet&#x27;, his poetry &quot;is about the organic relationship between human beings and the natural world...&#x27; After a brief flirtation with the Picturesque in his Cambridge years, he came to see this aesthetic view of nature as being only one of many (although it is arguable that he &quot;was under the sway of Picturesque theory&quot;, he frequently transcended it). His &#x27;vision&#x27; of nature was one that did not distort it in order to make art.

Wordsworth&#x27;s early radical political ideas led him to his second poetic characteristic: the use of &quot;plain language&quot; and having for his subject the &quot;common man&quot; as represented by the Dales-folk (rather than &quot;kings and queens, lords and ladies or gods and goddesses&quot; as was the case up to then). A third notable feature of his work was to do with the inward-turning of his mind, producing a semi-autobiographical take on nature and imagination: his poem &quot;The Prelude&quot;, he wrote to Dorothy, was &quot;the poem on the growth of my own mind.&quot; 
Despite this reclusive side of his personality, Wordsworth was a strong believer in family and community, and he was much concerned with the effects on (especially poor) people&#x27;s way of life of social change (for example, due to the enclosure movement) that were taking place. He disliked change that flew in the face of Nature: the planting of regimented lines of Larches; the coming of the railways; new building that did not chime with the vernacular; and the building of grand houses in the Lakes by the industrialists of Lancashire particularly upset him. In 1810 he published his &quot;Guide to the Lakes&quot;, tellingly subtitled &quot;for the Use of Tourists and Residents&quot;, and with a Section Three entitled &quot;Changes, and Rules of Taste for Preventing their Bad Effects.&quot; Nicholson argues that the &quot;Guide&quot; was the outcome of the loss of Wordsworth&#x27;s poetic vision of nature and a turning outwards into hard facts in order to preserve his sanity after &quot;years, perhaps, of disillusion, disappointment, of spiritual impotence...&quot; Another aspect of it was the link to the ideas of Uvedale Price, whom Wordsworth knew and who proposed a &quot;conservative, historicising and non-interventionist aesthetic&quot;. The &quot;Guide&quot; ran to five editions during Wordsworth&#x27;s lifetime and proved to be very popular. Indeed, it has been said that &quot;the architectural axioms of building and gardening in the Lake District for the next hundred years were established by the &quot;Guide&quot;&quot;.

For other writers, the region&#x27;s pull was more uncertain. Coleridge followed Wordsworth to the Lakes and moved into Greta Hall in 1800. Although identified by his contemporaries as a &#x27;Lake Poet&#x27;, Coleridge&#x27;s response to the landscape was at variance with the vision of Wordsworth, leading Coleridge to identify the landscape&#x27;s &quot;Gothic elements&quot;...&quot;and in so doing seems to recognise a potential for psychological horror rather than solace.&quot; Wordsworth&#x27;s rejection of the poem &quot;Christabel&quot;, partly written at Greta Hall, for the &quot;Lyrical Ballads&quot; collection, added to Coleridge&#x27;s depression over his personal life, his doubts about being able to write as he would have wished and his ill-health which was made worse by the Cumbrian climate. This led him to resort to the Kendal Black Drop, making matters desperate. Coleridge moved out of the area in 1804. 
Robert Southey, it has been argued, although becoming identified as the central &#x27;Lake Poet&#x27; (he lived at Greta Hall from 1803 to 1843), was mostly a prose writer and did not particularly subscribe to the Wordsworthian vision of the Lakes. Southey, like Wordsworth, started out on the republican left, but, by the time the threat from Napoleon had dwindled, he had become the embodiment of a Tory extolling the virtues of nation and patriotism, and using the Lakes as a touchstone, and as &quot;the symbol of the nation&#x27;s covenant with God.&quot;

Letitia Elizabeth Landon&#x27;s sketch, &quot;Grasmere Lake, A Sketch by a Cockney&quot;, in Fisher&#x27;s Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1834, is a spoof on the Lake Poets, whom she admired (especially Wordsworth) but regarded as outmoded. In her view the days of Romanticism were over.

In &quot;John Paterson&#x27;s Mare&quot;, James Hogg&#x27;s allegorical satire on the Edinburgh publishing scene first published in the &quot;Newcastle Magazine&quot; in 1825, the Lake Poets feature as &#x27;a whole covey of sandpipers or water larks&#x27;.

==Associated writers==
The second generation of Romantic poets were drawn to the area by the Romantic vision of seclusion and by the perceived republican views of the older poets, but found a different reality when they arrived. Shelley lived for three months in 1811 at Keswick, having been drawn to the Lakes by reading the early, &quot;liberty and equality&quot; Southey, only to find that Southey&#x27;s views had changed and that the Lakes had been despoiled by &quot;the manufacturers&quot;.

Keats, in the summer of 1818, had a similar response to that of Shelley, finding his hero Wordsworth&#x27;s house full of fashionable people and Wordsworth himself away canvassing for the local Tory candidate. Keats moved on to Scotland which provided him with the inspiration he sought (and where, in particular, he felt the influence of Robert Burns).

Byron did not visit the Lakes, but he ridiculed the isolation and narrowness of mind of the older Lake Poets, as well as of their abandonment of radical politics.

The hale and hearty John Wilson provided an alternative take on the role of Lake Poet. He lived near Windermere between 1808 and 1815 and knew the older Lake Poet trio well. His poetry (&quot;Isle of Palms&quot;) reveals a physical response to the Lakes scenery (he was an energetic walker and climber), and emphasises companionship and energy as against Wordsworthian quiet and solitude.

Wilson knew both Harriet Martineau and Thomas De Quincey. Martineau settled in a house she had built near Ambleside in 1845. As befitted her sociology-based background, her views concentrated on the need for the Lakes to be connected more with the outside world (for example, she was in favour of improved sanitation and of the new railways being set up through the district, unlike her friend Wordsworth). Her guide to the Lakes (&quot;Complete guide to the Lakes&quot;, 1855) was a rather factual and clear-eyed description about what to find there and about the condition of the people.

De Quincey moved into Dove Cottage in 1809 after having met his hero Wordsworth a couple of times before at Allan Bank, where the Wordsworths lived during 1808–1811, and then at Rydal Mount (&quot;Recollections of the Lake Poets&quot;, edited essays, 1834–1840). His worship of Wordsworth turned sour after De Quincey married a local girl and the Wordsworths refused to meet her. Instead, according to Nicholson, he turned more to the local dalesfolk and &quot;he got to know the dalesmen &quot;as people, as persons&quot;, better than ever Wordsworth did&quot;. He reversed the practice of the Picturesque – instead of using the imagination to transform (and distort) the real, external world, he used the external world of the Lakes to feed his dreams and imagination.

==Other writers==
The beauty of the Lake District has also inspired many other writers over the years, beyond the core Lake Poets. These include their contemporaries Bryan Procter, Felicia Hemans, and Walter Scott, as well as the labouring-class and slightly later John Close, who catered particularly to the growing tourist trade. Other poets include James Payn, Margaret Cropper, and Norman Nicholson.

In 1871, aged 48, having visited the Lakes many times, John Ruskin decided to settle down in Brantwood, a house overlooking Coniston Water. Worn out in body and mind, he was looking for a restful escape, and it was this &#x27;weariness and despair&#x27; that caught the sympathy of the Lake visitors. They, too, turned to the Lakes for comfort and rest,&#x27; rather than for the &#x27;stimulus and excitement that had been the joy of the early travellers.&#x27; Ruskin, although he wrote little about the area, ended up taking on the mantle of Wordsworth as the &#x27;new Sage of the Lakes, the Picturesque Figure, the Old Man of Coniston.&#x27; Nicholson saw him as the &#x27;Picturesque Figure&#x27;, &#x27;for in him are combined its three main phases - the aesthetic, the scientific and the moral ...&#x27; His scientific approach to the rocks and water of the Lakes, Nicholson argues, was an attempt, not to understand his subject, but to teach people how to react to it in a &#x27;practical and moral&#x27; way.

<text>The Breton Liberation Front (, or FLB) was a paramilitary organisation founded in 1963 whose aims were to seek greater autonomy for the region of Brittany (Breton: Breizh) separate from the rest of France. Brittany is a province in northwest France, and formed an independent Duchy of Brittany until the treaty of union in 1532. The group allegedly had strong allies with ETA (separatist group) as their struggles were almost the same.

==Ideology==
While the ideology of FLB was unclear during its very early years, the group&#x27;s overarching goal was Breton independence, considering their cause a part of the greater struggle of Celtic and European nations. The FLB believed that France had abused the treaty of 1532, as the treaty allowed Brittany to remain a legally separate duchy from France and thus retain a large degree of sovereignty, which was then gradually abolished by French centralism. The organization positioned itself as a fierce opponent of French unitary administration and affirmed that it would not exist in the first place &quot;if the Bretons had the status that the English colonists gave to the Quebecois: autonomous government, elected assembly, compulsory teaching of the national language.&quot;

The FLB also included the ARB, whose name was inspired by the IRA and which was considered the armed wing of the FLB. The ARB called for armed struggle against the &quot;French occupation of Brittany&quot;, though initially the group lacked a precise doctrine and had its members operate autonomously. This was changed by the publication of FLB&#x27;s manifesto in late 1968, which called for the right of Bretons to own local means of production and argued that Brittany is a colony suffering under the foreign domination of France. The FLB wrote: &quot;... We are in a typical colonial situation, where a handful of foreign capitalist entrepreneurs, represented by the French State, exploit and transform at their leisure, and for their own interests, the natural and human wealth of an indigenous community, powerless and enslaved, that is to say almost destroyed.&quot;

The organisation called itself socialist and called for &#x27;indigenous socialism&#x27; in Brittany that would be &quot;neither bureaucratic nor authoritarian&quot;, and was to be inspired by the Celtic heritage and tradition of Brittany. The FLB then steadily moved towards a more radical direction, though in September 1969 a Maoist faction left the organisation to form FLB-2, which then dissolved shortly afterwards to join the Breton Communist Party. On 29 May 1972 the FLB published a new manifesto which went further; instead of establishing indigenous socialism as the main ideology of the group, the new 1972 manifesto affirmed the FLB&#x27;s dedication to Marxism instead. The document also included the name change of ARB - instead of Armee Republicaine Bretonne (Breton Republican Army), it was now known as the Armee Revolutionnaire Bretonne (Breton Revolutionary Army).

Breton separatism was particularly unique in its eagerness to establish international connections with other separatist movements across the world, and playing a very active role in Celtic movements. As early as 1911, Breton nationalists called for the need to &quot;develop lines of friendship between all the Celtic peoples&quot;, and in 1927 Breton separatists held a conference in Rosporden which was also attended by representatives of the Alsatian, Corsican, Flemish and Celtic nationalist movements. While the declaration of the conference was very moderate and only called for extensive autonomy within France that would become &quot;une fédération de peuples&quot;, the Breton delegation stated that the long-term goal is to go further, stating: &quot;We believe that Europe is destined to form, sooner or later, an economic unity, and we see this transformation as the sole means of eliminating this universal calamity that is standing armies and wars. But we believe that this unity will not be a federation of the current states.&quot;

Strong Celtic and Pan-European currents in Breton nationalism made the FLB embrace these ideologies as well, infusing their separatism with &quot;celticism and europeanism&quot;. However, support for European federation was never supported by the majority of FLB members, and was a minority view that considered Breton struggle for independence a part of a larger struggle for liberating all stateless nation of Europe and creating a federal or confederal structure, devoid of foreign domination. When interviewed, most FLB members confirmed that the organization was not pan-European, with one member stating: &quot;We had to build a strategy of separation that would lead to total independence. It must also be said that in that era we were not interested at all in the construction of the European Union. Our preferred readings were &quot;The People’s War&quot; by Mao Zedong, &quot;The Rape of the Masses: The Psychology of Totalitarian Political Propaganda&quot; by Sergei Chakhotin, &quot;The Technique of Revolution&quot; by Malaparte.&quot;

Ultimately, the FLB followed &quot;a philosophy more concerned with socialism worldwide than ethnonationalism and Europeanism&quot;. While sympathy for other separatist was common, and the FLB believed that its cause &quot;was very connected to the international struggles in Paris, in relation with the Occitans and the Algerians&quot;, the organization did not share the vision of confoederal &quot;Third Europe&quot; of Yann Fouéré. In 1972, FLB and ETA released a joint declaration calling for the boycott of the French referendum on enlargement of the European Economic Community, rejecting the European Union as exploitative and bourgeois. Both organisations likewise stated: &quot;The fight against imperialism and colonialism in the Western European subcontinent calls for determined and fundamental opposition to the Common Market. The national oppression and economic exploitation suffered by the Irish, Basque, and Breton people can do nothing in effect but worsen by the development of this vast and dangerous capitalist enterprise.&quot;

Nevertheless, the FLB was distinguished by its willingness to work together with other separatist organizations. It established contact with Basque Euskadi Ta Askatasuna in 1969, and became associated with the Provisional Irish Republican Army around the same time. All three groups exchanged intel, and in 1972 some Breton militants received training from ETA in the Pyrenees. The FLB also had its combatants trained by the far-left Irish Saor Éire. The organization also sought ties with revolutionary Cuba and contacted the Cuban government through Swiss embassy, but Cuba turned the Bretons down as it did not want to sour its relations with France. Surprisingly, the party was also allied to the Basque Nationalist Party, despite it being much more moderate than ETA. The FLB was also involved in the creation of the far-left Front de libération du Québec.

==History==
Breton Nationalism had been a significant force in the early 20th century through the Breton National Party, but it has been discredited by its association with collaborationism in World War II. The FLB represented a new wave of nationalist politics associated with anti-colonialist ideology. The group claimed that Brittany was oppressed by France acting as a colonial power.

Citizens of Brittany, or, Bretons, retain their own national identity including an independent language from that of France, music, and other cultural details. Bretons are considered an ethnic Celtic group with their roots in Brittonic-speaking people from what is today Devon and Cornwall in Britain.

The group was linked to surviving members of earlier nationalist groups, notably Yann Goulet, who was operating from Ireland. The first known FLB attack occurred in June 1966 when a municipal tax office in Saint-Brieuc was bombed, and a note signed by the FLB claimed that they would continue to carry out a campaign of violence against these &quot;occupying symbols of Brittany&quot;.

In the following years, the FLB carried out attacks against administrative structures, such as electrical installations, police barracks and statues, mainly by bombing them. The number of attacks peaked in 1968. However, the FLB ensured that no physical injuries or deaths would result from their attacks, which they wished to remain purely symbolic. In this they followed the model of the earlier group Gwenn ha du. They thus gained a reputation in the international community as the &quot;smiling terrorists.&quot; There are even reports that the only two known FLB victims during this period were two FLB members themselves, who were killed while trying to defuse a bomb they were afraid would hurt civilians.

Factions in the FLB emerged in the early 1970s, leading to the creation of the militant Breton Revolutionary Army (&quot;Armée révolutionnaire bretonne&quot;, or ARB). This group acted separately from the FLB and proved to be the durable faction that still exists today. There were several Breton liberation groups that were distinct from the FLB.

== Activity ==
The first known FLB attack occurred in June 1966 when a municipal tax office in Saint-Brieuc was bombed, and a note signed by the FLB claimed that they would continue to carry out a campaign of violence against these &quot;occupying symbols of Brittany.&quot; In the following years, the FLB carried out attacks against administrative structures, such as electrical installations, police barracks and statues—mainly by bombing them. Though the group peaked in 1968 there have been attacks reported as recently as 2014 using incineration tactics.

The FLB ensured that no physical injuries or deaths would result from their attacks, which they wished to remain purely symbolic; in this they followed the model of the earlier group Gwenn ha du, founded 1930. There are reports that the only two known FLB victims during this period were two FLB members themselves, who were killed while trying to defuse a bomb they were afraid may hurt civilians. They thus gained a reputation in the international community as the &quot;smiling terrorists.&quot; The actions of the organization did not arise any moral disapproval of the Breton community, and the FLB enjoyed constant support of Breton nationalists.

One of their most notorious acts was the 1978 bombing of the Palace of Versailles.

=== Trials and police intervention ===
It was in 1969 that the police intervened, confiscating propaganda and weaponry. More than 60 people were arrested, those directly involved in previous attacks were given brief sentences, however within a few months many had been granted amnesty, or pardons, and released. Although created by young Bretons in the early 1960s, the FLB enjoyed popular support, evident during these arrests which revealed that members came from very diverse backgrounds: businessmen, housewives, students, farmers, and even clergy.

Though most had favorable outcomes for the organization, trials bolstered the Breton &quot;liberation&quot; movement as the trials were perceived to be further suppressive action by the government. This period was also marked with a rise in the number of students enrolling in Breton language courses, as being able to speak Breton was seen as legitimizing one&#x27;s position as a Breton militant.

== Notable leaders ==
===Yann Fouéré===

Yann was a prominent force in the Breton Liberation Front, so much so that he fled to Ireland 1948, seeking political asylum. He was an author, businessman and, in some ways politician. In 1999 he formed the &quot;Party for the Organization of Free Brittany&quot; which he led until 2004.

Yann was involved in a &quot;Pro-German witch Hunt&quot; in 1944, where he was held in custody for a year. Upon escape, he was sheltered by fellow Nationalists in Wales. While hidden he was sentenced to life in prison and was forced out of Brittany and into the Republic of Ireland, where he secured citizenship. In 1955 he was given a retrial in France and came back, innocent, to form the &quot;Movement for the Organization of Brittany.&quot;

In 1973 Yann ran for political office, lost, then was arrested two years later for involvement with the Breton Liberation Front&#x27;s bombings. He was released conditionally until 1979 when he and 22 others were charged with security-related offences .

He died in Saint-Brieuc at 101 years old in 2011, where he spent his last days advocating for Breton Nationalism and avoiding being tried as a &quot;wartime collaborator.&quot;

===Pierre Le Moine===
Pierre joined a resistance movement at 16 years old during the German occupation of France during which time he survived being captured by occupying forces. After the war in 1955 he co-founded the Breton Nationalist magazine Ar Vro and later Jeune Bretagne, becoming a regular contributor to Armor Magazine.

He was arrested during attacks by the Breton Liberation Front. After being freed he went into exile for many years in Jersey. He died at 96 years old in 2023 after a 68-year career as a founding member, vice-president, and president of the Federal Union of European Nationalities and its representative at the Council of Europe and OSCE.

<doc id="1326157" wikidata="Q2572131" url="?curid=1326157" title="Pink Panther and Sons">
<text>Pink Panther and Sons is an American animated television series produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions and Mirisch-Geoffrey-DePatie-Freleng. The series was originally broadcast on NBC from 1984 to 1985 and moved to ABC in 1986. Friz Freleng (a close friend of Joseph Barbera and William Hanna since all three worked on the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio in the 1930s) served as creative producer for the series as his and David H. DePatie&#x27;s production company, DePatie–Freleng Enterprises, existed as an in-name-only enterprise by this time, as its operations were absorbed by Marvel Productions in 1981. The show is based on the Pink Panther, a character created in 1963.

==Plot==
The series centers on The Pink Panther&#x27;s two sons: pre-teen Pinky, his toddler brother, Panky and their friends in the Rainbow Panthers crew (the pretty Chatta, fighting Rocko, gibberish-talking Murfel, overalls-wearing Annie, and mixed-up-talking Punkin). Each episode shows the Rainbow Panthers coming together in friendship as they learn about growing up and take on a group of lions called the Howl Angels.

Featured in each episode would be short three to five minutes cartoons featuring The Pink Panther bookending the main cartoons with Pinky and Panky.

==Characters==
===Rainbow Panthers===
* Pinky Panther (voiced by Billy Bowles) - Pinky is a very polite young panther. Pinky generally ends up getting in the most danger in situations, such as turning six inches tall in one episode, and is the one who comes up with most of the ideas. He is the leader of the Rainbow Panthers and he is in love with Chatta, a purple panther in the group.
* Panky (voiced by B.J. Ward) – Panky is Pinky&#x27;s little brother. His diaper is never tied correctly so he just holds it up wherever he goes. Since he is still a toddler, he is considered very impressionable, and tends to wander from his older brother. He is the larger of the two panther sons.
* Chatta (voiced by Sherry Lynn) – Chatta is a purple panther. She is in love with Pinky and often tries to impress him to win his affection. She also has an enormous vocabulary.
* Murfel (voiced by Shane McCob) – Murfel is a green panther who wears an oversized knit cap. Murfel always mumbles or slurs when he speaks, and as a result, it is difficult (albeit possible) for the audience to decipher what he is saying, although the other members of the Rainbow Panthers seem to understand him without much hassle.
* Rocko (voiced by Frank Welker) – Rocko is a yellow panther who is the most athletic of the group. Eager and energetic, he is always seen sporting boxing gloves and shorts.
* Annie O&#x27;Gizmo (voiced by Jeannie Elias) – Annie is an orange panther sporting overalls and a hard hat. She is very scientific and is considered the intellectual of the group.
* Punkin (voiced by B.J. Ward) – Punkin is a blue panther who wears a baseball cap and a wool sweater. He tends to confuse words and often requires multiple attempts to say what he means.
* The Pink Panther – Celebrity star of film and television and the father of Pinky and Panky. While he does not speak, Pinky and Panky often understand his gestures even when they go to him for advice.

===Howl Angels===
* Finko (voiced by Frank Welker) – Finko is the leader of the Howl Angels. An orange-colored lion with a multicolored mohawk, Finko is a rival to Pinky and one time was babysitter to Panky at the time when Pinky and Chatta go on a date to the movies.
* Howl (voiced by Marshall Efron) – Howl is a diminutive lion and the scheming right-hand man to Finko. He wears a saucepan on his head as a helmet.
* Liona (voiced by Jeannie Elias) – Liona is a lioness who is tough but pretty. She has a crush on Pinky where she and Chatta fight for his affection.
* Bowlhead and Buckethead (voiced by Gregg Berger and Sonny Melendrez) – Bowlhead and Buckethead are two of Finko&#x27;s goons and are often paired together when partaking in the Howl Angels&#x27; schemes, usually serving as comic relief. Fitting to their names, Bowlhead wears on his head a bowl adorned with horns, while Buckethead wears an iron bucket.

==Episodes==
==Other media==
A children&#x27;s book called &quot;Pink Panther: Fun at the Picnic&quot; was based on the series. Unlike the cartoon series, the Pink Panther is shown speaking. The story was where the Pink Panther had been hired as a magician for a party and asked Pinky to assist him, upsetting Panky who felt left out. The Pink Panther decides to start his act creating &quot;two Pink Panthers!&quot; displaying Pinky and Panky onstage.

In late October 2023, the complete series was finally made available on MGM+ and other digital platforms.

<text>The Breton Revolutionary Army (, ARB) is an illegal armed organization that is part of the Breton nationalism movement in the Brittany region of France.

==History==
=== Origins of the conflict ===
Until the end of the 15th century, Brittany had managed to remain independent of its French and English neighbours.
In December 1491, however, after two consecutive civil wars opposing the French Crown to an alliance of French Princes (among them Brittany) and foreign powers, the latter were defeated and the young Breton duchess, Anne, was married to the young King Charles VIII, thereby tying Brittany to France.

In 1532, the then French monarch, Francis I of France, officially tied Brittany to France despite originally allowing it to preserve its fiscal and legal privileges. This partial autonomy, in turn, allowed Brittany to remain unaffected by most of the foreign and domestic conflicts that afflicted the French Kingdom throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.

During the French Revolution, however, Brittany&#x27;s relative autonomy was revoked. Its parliament abolished, its Breton language banned, and its territory divided into five departments. This new transformed Brittany provoked bipolar reactions throughout the five new departments, as some overwhelmingly endorsed such fusion while others systematically rebelled against the fragile new Republic.

=== L&#x27;Armée Revolutionnaire Bretonne (ARB) ===
The Breton Revolutionary Army was created in 1971 as the armed wing of the Front de Liberation Breton (FLB), in English known as the Breton Liberation Front. The FLB had been established in 1963 with the intention to secure the liberation of Brittany from France. The ARB seeks recognition by the French government of the existence of the Breton people, the integrity of its territory, and the Breton language. Christian Georgeault is the group&#x27;s current leader and a former Emgann general Secretary.

The 1974 bombing in Roc Tredudon marks the first of approximately 200 terrorist acts on foreign soil, both inside and outside Brittany.

The ARB, unlike its Corsican (FLNC) and Basque (ETA) counterparts, does not seek to achieve human casualties. This is a view shared across the entire Breton political spectrum and especially by the Breton people who, until the attack on a McDonald&#x27;s in 2000, during which an employee was killed, have tolerated the actions of the separatist movement.
Until the 2000 attack, only two casualties (two ARB members were killed when trying to defuse their own bombs that they thought would injure someone) had resulted from their attacks. Nevertheless, considerable property damage has been inflicted as a result of these attacks.

The frequency of attacks increased between 1993 and 1996. A two-year truce followed. Attacks resumed on 30 October 1998 with the partial destruction of the Belfort city hall, home town of the then Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevènement. Other subsequent targets included symbols of the French government such as administrative offices, police precincts and utility installations, as well as the home towns of then-Prime Minister Lionel Jospin. The latter attack, which occurred on 18 June 1999, was a result of the refusal, two days before, by the then French President Jacques Chirac to ratify the European Charter on Regional and Minority Languages.

=== The 1999 Plévin heist and the ETA-ARB connection ===
The theft of eight and a half tons of an explosive, Titadine 30, from one of the warehouses of the company Titanite SA, in Plévin on 28 September 1999 by an ETA and ARB commando is one of the most spectacular achievements of the ARB to date (the security alarm system had been carefully dismantled). This incident served to confirm suspicions about the nature of the relationship between the ETA and the Breton separatists. As the subsequent investigation revealed, ARB members had been hosting Basque separatists in Brittany prior to the heist. Spanish authorities even suspect that some ETA members may at times come to Brittany temporarily in search of a safe haven.
The investigation also confirmed the close relationship between Emgann and the ARB as one of the former&#x27;s members, Arnaud Vannier was arrested in connection with the Plévin heist when twenty-five sticks of dynamite and two detonators and two timers were found in the trunk of his car, all originating from the Plévin heist.
Emgrann replied to the accusations saying that it was not responsible for the activities of individual members.
Half a dozen individuals were subsequently arrested in connection with the heist. Three days after the heist, three ETA members were arrested near Pau, France, with a van containing two and a half tons of explosives, all originating from Plévin. Two other individuals, Denis Riou and Richard Lefaucheux, were arrested for their complicity in the heist (renting cars to pick up the Basque separatists and providing them with shelter in Lorient).

=== McDonald’s bombing ===
On Wednesday 19 April 2000, around 10 a.m., one and a half kilogram bomb placed near the drive-through of a McDonald&#x27;s restaurant in Quévert, Brittany, exploded. At the time of the explosion, the building was relatively empty with the exception of three teenagers and two other customers. While none of them sustained any injuries as a result of the explosion, a 27-year-old employee, Laurence Turbec, was killed on impact as she made her way through a service entrance.

The explosion did not ignite a fire but the building itself sustained severe damage and its roof was blown off.

The explosive used was Titane 30, the same type of dynamite stolen in 1999 from Plévin, suggesting that the ARB may have been responsible for this bombing. Further evidence confirmed this relationship, as at the same moment the Quévert bombing was taking place, another bomb near a post office in Rennes was defused by police.

Forensic analysis determined that Titane 30 had been used during both attacks. A piece of spring found in the remains found at the Quévert site was found to originate from the same type of kitchen timer used to offset the defused explosive in Rennes. The use of kitchen timers also confirmed the ARB&#x27;s involvement given their systematic use in previous bombings.

While the perpetrators of the bombing were never found, four individuals were subsequently arrested as a result of the investigation. Stéphane Phillipe, Pascal Laizé, and Christian Gorgeault (the presumed ARB ringleader) were arrested for suspected complicity; Gael Roblin, the main spokesman of Emgann, was also arrested for his theoretical justification of previous ARB bombings. The four men were ultimately acquitted of charges in the Quévert bombing, but they were sentenced the same day to serve prison terms (six, eight, eleven, and three years respectively) for their involvement in prior attacks.

While the ARB claimed to be unrelated to the Quévert bombing, in November 2000 police confirmed that the group had returned a hundred kilograms of the explosives stolen in the Plévin heist in 1999 to police authorities. This action came following a statement by the ARB that it sought to appease the current political climate in Brittany as well as an end to the repression of the ARB.

==Emgann (&quot;Fight&quot;)==

Emgann is believed to provide political support to the ARB. Its affiliation with the latter has been repeatedly denied over the years by Emgann, which considers itself a pacifist group, although it openly supports the ARB&#x27;s violent methods and goals. It nonetheless publishes the ARB&#x27;s messages and articles and substantial evidence has been produced by French authorities that confirms the suspected intimate and complicit relationship between the two groups. Hence, several Emgann members were apprehended in connection with several attacks attributed to the ARB. Created in 1982, Emgann defines itself as part of the independent Breton leftist wing. Pro-independence and anti-capitalist, Emgann advocates for no compromise or contact with the French government and political parties.
Its activism came in the wake of the election of François Mitterrand to the French Presidency. In 1981, the newly elected state leader had pardoned members of the FLB who had just been convicted and imprisoned by the State Security Court, in France. Their release provoked the dismantlement of the FLB as many of its newly released members gave up their former violent activism and instead chose to retire or join the Breton Democratic Union (UDB), an autonomist Breton political movement opposed to violence. Emgrann, therefore, picked up the FLB&#x27;s mantle and sought to pursue the fight.

==Recruitment==
The characteristics of Emgann and the ARB&#x27;s recruitment pool serve to explain the rather lack of preparedness of its attacks over the years.
While in the 70s many recruits came from universities and parts of the Breton elite, today most if not all are mainly drawn from either urban and unemployed youth, those living on welfare and those on limited and short term employment.
This non-specialized recruitment illustrates, according to French authorities, the amateur nature of the often botched bombings of the ARB. On 25 November 1999 police managed to retrieve two and a half kilograms of dynamite in Saint-Herblain because the timer had malfunctioned and was out of order. On 28 November that year, in Rennes, police defused a bomb with a nearby sign indicating the presence of an ARB explosive device.
However, the more successful attacks of the ARB, such as the 1998 bombing of Belfort City Hall and the Plévin attack seem to counter that claim. Police theorize that this divergence in preparedness and specialization may be explained by the association, at times, of the ARB and their Basque counterparts, the ETA.

==Support==

=== Financial Support ===
Local financial support for the ARB is geared toward the families of its incarcerated members.
This financial support is provided by Skoazell Vreizh (&quot;Breton assistance&quot;), an original group headed by Pierre Locquet, who has been its president for over 20 years. A former FLB member, Locquet was convicted for an attack in the 1970s.
Locquet considers his organisation essential in helping anyone who commits an act that defies French authority. Upon capture, the perpetrator&#x27;s family is contacted by Skoazell Vreizh to make arrangements in order to pay their legal fees. In case of incarceration, the organisation takes it upon itself to support the prisoner&#x27;s family financially until his release.
Until the 1990s, Skoazell Vreizh had mainly used its financial support to assist minor delinquents « with a good cause » who engaged in such activities as repainting street signs in Breton, refusing to pay the national television tax to protest the lack of a Breton channel, or paying their taxes by writing checks in Breton.
The 1990s, however proved to be more costly for Skoazell Vreizh as the seriousness of the ARB&#x27;s attacks increased, part of which can be blamed on the group&#x27;s increased association with better trained and more radical groups such as the ETA, as is evidenced by the Plévin theft.
Nonetheless, Skoazell Vreizh remains a crucial asset and is well organized. Part of its funds emanate from minor donations collected at concerts and other public festivities or personal donations withdrawn from a donor&#x27;s bank account. The largest contributions, however, come directly from its political support, namely from the UDB itself and the Breton Cultural Institute which is a branch of the Breton Regional Counsel.

=== Popular support ===
Until the McDonald&#x27;s attack in 2000, the ARB and Emgann had enjoyed widespread support throughout Brittany. While this support has largely dwindled over the years, as evidenced by the various nationalist protests organized over the years by Emgrann and which have managed to draw less than two hundred people, a number in sharp contrast with the thousands of supporters the FLB used to attract in the 1970s.
Nonetheless, the ARB managed to maintain, at the very least, a form of toleration from the wider population who recognize the merit in their fight. Most of all the nonviolent nature of the group (refusing to spill blood to achieve their goals), until 2000, served to maintain that support as the Breton people, including the group&#x27;s most ardent supporters, consider non-lethal violence a more respectable form of protest than the opposite.
The death of Laurence Turbec had a tremendously negative impact on the group&#x27;s popularity. Both Breton leftist and right wing groups condemned the attack. The UDB clamored for the perpetrators to turn themselves in. Similarly, the POBL (center-right party) worried this might signal an ideological drift from the ARB toward a more violent type of radicalism, such as that of their ETA counterparts. Emgann&#x27;s spokesman, Gael Roblin, as well, called the act itself unacceptable and unjustifiable. Former ARB members similarly denounced the attack and said the ARB should justify itself publicly.

Pierre Locquet was also said to be sickened by the attack, criticized the amateur nature of ARB members, pointing out that in the 1970s, ARB members would always stay nearby so as to ensure that the explosive would work as intended and that no casualties would be sustained.

<text>The Crescentii (in modern Italian Crescenzi) were a baronial family, attested in Rome from the beginning of the 10th century and which in fact ruled the city and the election of the popes until the beginning of the 11th century.

==History==

Several individuals named &quot;Crescentius&quot; who appear in the very scanty documentation of the period have been grouped together by historians as the &quot;Crescentii.&quot; Some do seem to bear family relationships, falling into two main branches, the Ottaviani and the Stefaniani, and their policies were consistent enough, especially as regards confronting the rival gang of aristocratic thugs, the Tusculani, who were descended from the influential curial official Theophylact, Count of Tusculum, ruler of Rome at the beginning of the 10th century. Their territorial strongholds were situated mainly in the Sabine Hills.

The Crescentii had another formidable enemy, whose power did not always extend to Rome, in the German kings and emperors of the Ottonian Saxon dynasty, notably Otto the Great and Henry II. Emperor Otto&#x27;s intervention in Italian affairs in 961 was not in Crescentii interests. In February 962, the pope and the emperor ratified the &quot;Diploma Ottonianum&quot;, in which the emperor became the guarantor of the independence of the papal states. It was the Crescentii who most threatened papal independence.

The clan&#x27;s triumph was in the later 10th century. They produced one pope from among their number — John XIII — and controlled most of the others, whom the leaders of the Crescentii installed as puppet popes. They held the secular offices such as &quot;praefectus&quot; by which Rome was technically still governed, and exacted large contributions and donations from the Papal treasury, in a thinly disguised extortion. From this power base within the city, they were able to influence even those popes who had not been their direct candidates.

In the countryside, Crescentii castles concentrated a cluster of population that depended on them for their defense and were dependable armed members of the Crescentii clientage.

After Sergius IV&#x27;s death (1012), the Crescentii simply installed their candidate, Gregory, in the Lateran, without the assent of the cardinals. A struggle flared between the Crescentii and the rival Tusculani. The failure of their bold attempt and the pontificate of the Tusculan pope Benedict VIII, whose powerful protector was the King of the Germans, Henry II, whom he crowned Emperor in Rome in 1014, forced the Crescentii out of Rome, retreating to the fortified strongholds. In the 1020s, the abbot Hugh of Farfa was able to play one branch of Crescentii against another, and Crescentii support of two unsuccessful antipopes in mid-century, Sylvester III (Pope in 1045) and Benedict X in 1058 were symptoms of the clan&#x27;s loss of unity and political prestige. As landowners, they settled into more local forms of patronage, as the &quot;Crescenzi.&quot;

The last known member of the family was Cardinal Marcello Crescenzi who died in 1768.

<doc id="1326166" wikidata="Q990686" url="?curid=1326166" title="Bros (British band)">
<text>Bros () are an English band formed in 1986 in Camberley, Surrey. The band originally consisted of twin brothers Matt and Luke Goss, and their friend Craig Logan, who attended Collingwood School in Camberley. The band was managed by former Pet Shop Boys manager Tom Watkins. They achieved chart success and a large teenage fanbase in 1988 with songs such as &quot;When Will I Be Famous?&quot; and &quot;I Owe You Nothing&quot;. Early the following year, Logan quit the band and the Goss twins continued as a duo. After two more albums the band split up in 1992.

According to the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), Bros has been certified for sales of 1.3 million albums and 750,000 singles in the UK. Bros are estimated to have sold 16 million records worldwide. In 2017, the Goss twins reunited to perform two dates as Bros at the O2 Arena in London.

==History==
===Early years===
Luke Goss and Matt Goss (born 29 September 1968 in Lewisham, London) had settled in Camberley, Surrey, after their parents had split up and their mother had found a new boyfriend, who bought Luke an electronic drum kit and Matt a saxophone, noticing their interest in music. The twins attended Collingwood College, where they became part of a band called Blue. At school they met Craig Logan (born 22 April 1969 in Kirkcaldy, Fife, Scotland) who was playing bass guitar in another school band, Stillbrook. Logan recalled that the Goss brothers came to his house one evening to say they had split from their band, and asked Logan to join them in a new group. Logan agreed, and the trio went through a variety of names for the group before settling on Gloss.

The group were noticed by Bob Herbert, who had ambitions to break into the music business as a manager – Herbert&#x27;s son Chris was a classmate of the trio at Collingwood. Herbert allowed the group to practise in his summer house and paid for them to record demos, but he was unable to sign them to a contract as they were under 18 years old.

During this period Gloss had met Nicky Graham, a songwriter and producer. Graham was working and writing songs with music manager Tom Watkins, and he suggested that Watkins meet the group. Although he was unimpressed with either their look or their music, Watkins realised that he could shape the group into a boy band for the teen girl market, with Graham and Watkins writing the songs for them. Gloss split from Herbert, and signed a contract with Watkins and his management company as soon as they turned 18. Watkins renamed the band Bros, and he and Graham wrote the group&#x27;s songs under the pseudonym of &quot;The Brothers&quot;, in order to create the impression that the Goss brothers had written the songs themselves.

===Success===
Bros&#x27;s debut single, &quot;I Owe You Nothing&quot;, was released in August 1987, but it only peaked at number 80 in the UK Singles Chart. However, their breakthrough came with the release of their second single, &quot;When Will I Be Famous?&quot;, in November 1987. The song reached number two in the UK, and number one in Ireland. The song also reached the top ten in 10 other countries across Europe and Australia, and peaked at number 10 in the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Club Play chart.

Bros followed up the success of &quot;When Will I Be Famous?&quot; with their third single, &quot;Drop the Boy&quot;. Like its predecessor, it also peaked at number two in the UK and was certified Silver by the BPI. and at number one in Ireland. as well as reaching the top ten in Australia, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland and West Germany.

Bros released their debut album &quot;Push&quot; on 28 March 1988. &quot;Push&quot; entered the UK Albums Chart at number two. Although it never reached number one, the album was eventually certified quadruple platinum in the UK, as well as double platinum in Australia, platinum in New Zealand, and gold in France, Germany, Spain and Switzerland. A deluxe 3-CD edition of &quot;Push&quot; was reissued in 2013 by Cherry Pop records for its 25th anniversary, featuring bonus tracks.

Bros reissued a remixed version of &quot;I Owe You Nothing&quot; as a single in June 1988, which became their only number one single in the UK. The song peaked at number two in Ireland and in the top ten in eight other countries across the world, as well as giving them their second top ten hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Club Play chart. Two further singles were released from &quot;Push&quot;, &quot;I Quit&quot; in September 1988, which entered the UK charts at number four, and &quot;Cat Among the Pigeons&quot;, which was released in November 1988 as a double A-side with a version of the Christmas carol &quot;Silent Night&quot; and entered the UK charts at number two.

Their first UK tour, known as Bros Push Live, sold out 14 shows within an hour of the tickets going on sale. Due to the demand, extra dates were added. 

The group&#x27;s popularity was named &quot;Brosmania&quot; by the music press, and their following of teenage girls were known as &quot;Brosettes&quot;. In September 1988 the Metropolitan Police had to close off part of Oxford Street in central London when an overwhelming number of fans turned up to a record signing by the band at the flagship store of record shop HMV. Bros had over six million fans worldwide join the band&#x27;s fan club, known as the Bros Front. With such demand for merchandise and fans wanting to talk to their idols, a phone line was set up, with 70,000 fans using the service within the first month.

Logan left the band in early 1989, due to several bouts of illness, including chronic fatigue syndrome, and the fact he could no longer walk and was being assisted on and off stage. Logan was admitted to hospital for six weeks, and once released from hospital he spent a further six months of rehabilitation to learn to walk again. Logan decided that the pressure of stardom was no longer for him and told Matt and Luke he was thinking of leaving the band. He appeared with the brothers at the 1988 Smash Hits Poll Winners Party; this was his final appearance as a member of Bros. He appeared on the BBC1 television programme &quot;Wogan&quot; discussing why he had left the band. During the interview Logan talked about the legal action he took against the management of Bros over unpaid royalties, but confirmed he left the band due to illness.

Bros continued as a duo, with Matt Goss and Luke Goss continuing with the sold-out world tour titled &#x27;The Global Push&#x27;, where the band played to fans in Australia, Japan, mainland Europe and the UK.

After a short break recovering from their Global Push Tour, Bros went back to the recording studio and released their second album, &quot;The Time&quot;. The album was released on 16 October 1989 and reached number 4 in the UK Albums Chart. Bros released several tracks from the album as singles, including &quot;Too Much&quot;, &quot;Chocolate Box&quot;, &quot;Madly in Love&quot;, and &quot;Sister&quot;.

Bros did a one-off concert, &quot;Bros in 2 Summer&quot;, which was seen by over 77,000 fans at Wembley Stadium in August 1989. The support acts for the show were Salt &#x27;n&#x27; Pepa and Debbie Gibson.

In 1991 Bros released their third and final album, &quot;Changing Faces&quot;, before the band split up in 1992. They released two tracks from the album: &quot;Are You Mine?&quot;, reaching number 12 in the UK and &quot;Try&quot;, which got to number 27. The album was not highly publicised and entered the chart at number 18.

Bros achieved eleven top 40 singles and three top 20 albums in the United Kingdom. Worldwide, the group is estimated to have sold 16 million records. The band never had commercial success in the US, where they remain relatively unknown.

==Careers after Bros==
Matt Goss began a solo career during the 1990s, enjoying chart success with singles &quot;The Key&quot; and &quot;If You Were Here Tonight&quot;, and had his own Vegas Residency at The Palms, Caesars Palace and The Mirage.

Luke Goss moved to the US and became a film actor, appearing in Hollywood movies such as &quot;Blade II&quot; and &quot;Hellboy II: The Golden Army&quot;. He starred in the UK film &quot;Interview with a Hitman&quot; in 2012 and released his directorial debut Your Move in 2018.

Craig Logan became a songwriter and later an artist manager following his departure from the band in 1989. At the time he was in a relationship with singer Kim Appleby and co-wrote many of her solo songs. From 2006 to 2010 he was the head of RCA Records in the UK, before launching his own management company.

==Reunion==
On 1 July 2008, singer Matt Goss told BBC News that he had spoken to the other members of the band and in principle they had agreed to reform, feeling that he and his bandmates &quot;are finally at a place&quot; where they could reunite. However, his brother Luke denied any plans of taking part in a reunion. On 14 September 2010, Matt Goss stated that the band would not be reuniting in the near future, saying that the moment had passed.

On 19 August 2017 — 28 years to the day since the band&#x27;s original farewell concert at Wembley Stadium. — Matt and Luke Goss played a 30th anniversary Bros concert at London&#x27;s O2 Arena. Craig Logan wished the Goss brothers success with the concerts, but confirmed he was not interested in taking part in the reunion. A UK tour was scheduled, with a second date at the O2 Arena and shows in Manchester, Glasgow, Birmingham and Newcastle upon Tyne, but all the dates except the two shows in London and the show in Manchester were later cancelled, with the band blaming &quot;unforeseen logistical circumstances&quot;.

A documentary film of the brothers&#x27; reunion and the rehearsals and lead-up to the first concert at the O2 Arena, titled &quot;&quot;, was shown on 18 October 2018 as part of the BFI London Film Festival and given a limited cinema release on 9 November 2018, with a DVD and digital release on 12 November. The film debuted at number one on the UK&#x27;s Official Music Video Chart. It received its television debut on BBC Four on 23 December and became one of that year&#x27;s Christmas television highlights due to its subsequent popularity on BBC iPlayer.

Following the documentary&#x27;s success, the duo played another concert at London&#x27;s O2 Brixton Academy on 5 July 2019, followed by further UK tour dates. They also planned to re-record their debut album &quot;Push&quot; in a more contemporary style, and to release an album of new material in the future.

<text>Reeve Oliver is an American pop rock band formed in 2000 in San Diego, California. They have released two albums and several EPs and have toured with larger acts such as The Vandals, Yellowcard, and Switchfoot. They have been locally recognized at the San Diego Music Awards, earning &quot;best rock album&quot; in 2003 for &quot;The Reeveolution EP&quot; and again in 2005 for &quot;Reeve Oliver&quot;, and being named &quot;best rock act&quot; at the 2006 awards.

==Band history==
Reeve Oliver was formed by vocalist/guitarist Sean O&#x27;Donnell while he was a member of the Christian punk band Dogwood. While writing songs for Dogwood, O&#x27;Donnell found himself writing more pop-based rock songs as well that did not fit the band&#x27;s style. When Dogwood&#x27;s album &quot;Building a Better Me&quot; was completed ahead of schedule, O&#x27;Donnell and Noise Ratchet drummer Brandon Young used the remaining studio time to record Reeve Oliver&#x27;s first 5-song demo. O&#x27;Donnell left Dogwood in 2001 and he and Young formed Reeve Oliver as a full-time band, initially with Dogwood bassist Jason Harper who soon left and was replaced by Otis Bartholameu of the band Fluf (known simply by his first initial, O). Eventually Young&#x27;s commitments to Noise Ratchet led to his replacement by Brad Davis, a longtime friend of O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s. O&#x27;Donnell and Davis also work as entertainers and show hosts at SeaWorld.

In 2003 Reeve Oliver was awarded &quot;best rock album&quot; at the San Diego Music Awards for &quot;The Reeveolution EP&quot;. This was followed by their debut self-titled album in 2005 which received the same award, and a 2006 award for &quot;best rock act.&quot; During this time the band performed as the opening act for Yellowcard on tour and also performed on the Warped Tour. In 2006 the band signed to major label Capitol, however they were soon dropped during the label&#x27;s merger with Virgin. In March 2007 they released &quot;The Endless Bummer EP&quot; through Apple Danish Records. That December they self-released their second album &quot;Touchtone Inferno!!!&quot;, recorded under their contract with Capitol.

In February 2009 O&#x27;Donnell announced his involvement in a new musical project called Big If with Ryan Key of Yellowcard. This effectively put Reeve Oliver on hiatus, with Key stating that &quot;Neither Yellowcard or Reeve Oliver feel like it is necessary to announce official break ups. There may come a time down the road where we want to get together and play shows with those bands. Who knows when that may be, but we aren&#x27;t ruling it out completely.&quot; O&#x27;Donnell went on to serve as the bassist for Yellowcard from April 2010 until February 2012.

<text>The Telecoms &amp; Internet converged Services &amp; Protocols for Advanced Networks (TISPAN) is a standardization body of ETSI, specializing in fixed networks and Internet convergence. It was formed in 2003 from the amalgamation of the ETSI bodies Telecommunications and Internet Protocol Harmonization Over Networks (TIPHON) and Services and Protocols for Advanced Networks (SPAN).

TISPAN&#x27;s focus is to define the European view of the Next Generation Networking (NGN), though TISPAN also includes much participation from regions outside Europe.

TISPAN NGN Release 1 was published in December 2005 and contained the architectural foundations and basic specifications required in support of PSTN replacement. The TISPAN NGN architecture is based on sharing common components between cooperating subsystems. The TISPAN NGN architecture complies with the general reference model for next generation networks defined in ITU-T Recommendation Y.2011 [1] and is therefore layered with a service stratum and a transport stratum. Each of these layers is further decomposed into sub-systems that perform specific roles within the overall architecture. This allows new subsystems to be added over time to cover new demands and service classes. By making network resources, applications, and user equipment common to all subsystems, it ensures mobility of users, terminals and services as much as possible, even across administrative boundaries. A key subsystem is based on the architectures of 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS). TISPAN has been working with 3GPP to extend the IMS architecture with capabilities required in support of wire-line access.

TISPAN NGN Release 2 was finalized early 2008, and added support for IPTV services and Business Communications over the IMS.

Since early 2008, TISPAN has begun work on the third release of its NGN specifications with prime focus on IPTV enhancements, Content Delivery Networks (CDN) and home networking. In 2011, TISPAN published the specification of a functional architecture for Content Delivery Networks (CDN) and is now working on the specification of the protocols applicable to the reference points identified in this architecture (See ETSI TS 182 019)

The ETSI website on Next Generation Networking states:
&quot;Standards for fixed NGN were developed by the now closed ETSI technical committee TISPAN. The TC has adopted the 3GPP™ core IMS specifications using Internet (SIP) protocols to allow features such as Presence, IPTV, Messaging, and Conferencing to be delivered irrespective of the network in use. Maintenance of NGN standards are now the responsibility of TC NTECH.&quot;

<doc id="1326180" wikidata="Q724391" url="?curid=1326180" title="Norm Breyfogle">
<text>Norman Keith Breyfogle (; February 27, 1960 – September 24, 2018) was an American artist, best known for his comic book art on DC Comics&#x27;s Batman franchise from 1987 to 1995. During this time, he co-created the villains Ventriloquist and Ratcatcher with writers Alan Grant and John Wagner, and the characters Anarky, Jeremiah Arkham, Victor Zsasz, and Amygdala with Grant alone. He co-created with writers Gerard Jones and Len Strazewski the Malibu Comics Ultraverse flagship hero Prime, and both wrote and drew the Malibu-published series featuring his original character Metaphysique.

== Early life ==
Norman Keith Breyfogle was born on February 27, 1960, in Iowa City, Iowa to parents Lois (née Roberts) and Gerald Breyfogle. He had a brother Kevin and a sister Penny Duncan.

Breyfogle began taking private art lessons at the age of twelve, and won an award at a local art show. His family subsequently moved to Houghton, Michigan, and the local newspaper &quot;The Daily Mining Gazette&quot; profiled him in 1976 as &quot;Norm Breyfogle: Near Master Cartoonist at 16&quot;. While in high school, he produced &quot;Tech-Team&quot;, a comic commissioned by local Michigan Technological University. In 1977, he submitted a design for Robin&#x27;s costume, which was published in &quot;Batman Family&quot; #13.

Breyfogle attended Northern Michigan University, studying painting and illustration while working as an illustrator for a local magazine and a graphics company. In 1980, he illustrated a book titled &quot;Bunyan: Lore&#x27;s Loggin&#x27; Hero&quot;, published by Book Concern. He moved to California in 1982. He worked as a draftsman and later as a technical illustrator designing a Space Shuttle training manual for the United Space Boosters.

== Career ==
=== Early comics work ===
In 1984, Breyfogle penciled a six–page story for DC Comics&#x27;s &quot;New Talent Showcase&quot;. Mike Friedrich (President of Star Reach, a talent representative agency) saw Breyfogle&#x27;s work hanging at the 1985 San Diego Comic-Con Art Show and began representing him. This was followed by several issues of First Comics&#x27;s &quot;American Flagg&quot;, penciling a back-up story titled &quot;Bob Violence&quot; in 1985. During this time he drew for &quot;Tales of Terror&quot;, a horror anthology published by Eclipse Comics. Following that, Breyfogle wrote, illustrated, and lettered a Captain America story in &quot;Marvel Fanfare&quot; #29 (Nov. 1986). He then drew &quot;Whisper&quot; for First Comics in 1986–1987, his first monthly book, before landing on &quot;Detective Comics &quot; starring Batman published by DC Comics.

=== Batman ===

Teamed with writer Alan Grant, Breyfogle worked on &quot;Detective Comics&quot;. They introduced the Ventriloquist in their first Batman story together and the Ratcatcher in their third. He drew the Batman for six years (1987–1993), penciling &quot;Detective Comics &quot;from 1987 to 1990, then moving to &quot;Batman&quot; to introduce the character Tim Drake as the new Robin from 1990 to 1992, and finally starting a new Batman series for DC titled &quot;&quot; from 1992 to 1993 which saw the Grant/Breyfogle team create three new characters, Jeremiah Arkham, Mr. Zsasz, and Amygdala. During his six-year run on the Batman character, he drew a few one-shots, two of them being &quot;&quot;, the first DC comic book to feature the Elseworlds logo, and &quot;Batman: Birth of the Demon&quot;, which he hand painted. He provided pencils to a 10-page short story in &quot;Superman 80-Page Giant&quot; #1 (Feb. 1999).

=== Later work ===
In 2000, Breyfogle drew the Elseworlds three-issue mini-series &quot;Flashpoint.&quot; In 2001, DC offered him the job of penciling &quot;The Spectre&quot; monthly, which he drew for one year.

He spent 2003 penciling and inking the title &quot;Black Tide&quot;, published by Angel Gate Press.

In 2004, Breyfogle began work on an illustrated children&#x27;s book for the Society of St. John Monastery, finished many commissions for fans, put together a couple printed sketchbooks showcasing his work, and continued writing his novel, getting halfway done, finishing through chapter six. He wrote over forty poems and over 1,300 haikus in a five-month marathon, and a number of short stories.

In February 2005 he accepted an offer to pencil and ink the interiors and covers of the new ongoing monthly title &quot;Of Bitter Souls&quot; from studio Relative Comics, originally published by Speakeasy Comics. It was written by Chuck Satterlee. Shortly before Speakeasy Comics went out of business, Relative Comics joined with Chimaera Studios and moved to publisher Markosia Comics. Breyfogle produced illustrations for a wide variety of clients outside of the comics industry including Nike, Inc., &quot;Mojo&quot;, &quot;The Red Bulletin&quot;, &quot;Time Out&quot;, &quot;Company&quot;, &quot;Süddeutsche Zeitung Magazin&quot;, and various bands such as 12 Stone Toddler, among many others.

In 2007, he provided art for the main story interiors and the covers for the comic book title &quot;The Danger&#x27;s Dozen&quot;. He began a professional relationship with the London-based art agency Debut Art.

Starting in 2006, he began a working relationship with Mazz Press, contributing stand-alone illustrations to two novels by Stephen Pytak, &quot;The .40 Caliber Mousehunt&quot; and &quot;The Wild Damned.&quot;

In 2008, Breyfogle began drawing Archie&#x27;s New Look, for &quot;Archie&#x27;s Double Digest&quot;, published by Archie Publications. Breyfogle drew two titles for Archie Comics: &quot;Archie Loves Betty&quot; and &quot;Archie Loves Veronica&quot;.

He returned to DC to draw &quot;DC Retroactive: Batman – The &#x27;90s,&quot; written by his former Batman collaborator Alan Grant, in October 2011. Breyfogle contributed art to DC&#x27;s &quot;Batman Beyond Unlimited&quot; digital comic series from 2012 to 2013; later reprinted as an 18 issue series.

In 2015, DC published &quot;Legends of the Dark Knight: Norm Breyfogle Vol. 1&quot;, a hardcover collection of Breyfogle&#x27;s early Batman stories. A second volume was released in late 2018.

== Retirement and death ==
On December 18, 2014, Breyfogle suffered a stroke that cut off blood flow to part of his brain, causing paralysis on his left side. He was left-handed, and although he regained some use of his left side, he was no longer able to draw professionally.

In July 2015 writer/novelist Glenn Hauman and writer/editor Bob Greenberger set up an Indiegogo campaign to raise $10,000 to defray the cost of Breyfogle&#x27;s therapy, which involved producing a 280-page trade paperback reprinting issues #3–11 of &quot;Whisper&quot;, a 1986 First Comics series created by Steven Grant, which Breyfogle illustrated. The book also featured original contributions by participating creators, and was issued in hardcover to those donating at least $100.

Breyfogle died of heart failure on September 24, 2018, in Houghton, Michigan.

<text>Hartenberg-Münchfeld is a borough of the Rhineland-Palatinate state capital Mainz, Germany.

Hartenberg-Münchfeld is known for the Bruchwegstadion former home of first league football club of 1. FSV Mainz 05, the state broadcasting house of the Südwestrundfunk for Rhineland-Palatinate, a subsidiary of the Deutsche Bundesbank, formerly: &quot;State Central Bank of Rhineland-Palatinate/Saarland&quot;, a large vocational school centre, the day-care centre ″Alte Patrone″ with artists&#x27; studios. The Taubertsberg town bath and the Peter Cornelius Conservatory are located in the district called &quot;Binger Schlag&quot; near Mainz Hauptbahnhof.

Created in the 1989 reorganisation of Mainz, the borough currently has a population of nearly 19,000 citizens.

Due to its vicinity to the University of Mainz it is one of the favourite student quarters of the town, and many of the city&#x27;s 35,000 students live there. Famous residents include Nobel Prize Winner Paul J. Crutzen and fashion designer Anja Gockel.

== History ==
The street name &quot;Am Judensand&quot; indicates the use of parts of the later area in the borough from the Middle Ages on. Here are burial places of the Jewish community. The old Jewish cemetery on the border between Hartenberg-Münchfeld and Mainz-Neustadt has been preserved until today; the oldest gravestone dates back to the 11th century. The memorial stone of Gershom ben Judah, who died in 1028 or 1040, is located here.

In the early 19th century, probably more than a thousand people were buried in a mass grave on the territory of the present borough. The mass grave was discovered in autumn 2018 during construction work for a shooting range. According to initial estimates, it could have been German and French soldiers who had fallen victim to an epidemic. Survivors of the Battle of Leipzig in 1813, who had fled to Mainz, had brought the so-called &quot;Typhus de Mayence&quot; into the city. At least 16292 men of the French occupation and 2485 inhabitants of Mainz died during this time.

Due to the importance of Mainz as a fortified city, the &quot;Hartenberg&quot; also had a military function. Those who controlled it could fire from there to the city centre of Mainz. When the town was extended, a new rampart was built around it, the Rheingauwall. It was built in the Neo-Prussian style of fortification and enclosed parts of what is now the district. Several forts have been partially preserved, such as Fort Hauptstein, the Cavalier Prince Holstein, Fort Hartmühl in Hartenberg Park north of the water features and the &quot;New Golden Ross&quot; Barracks. At the Mombacher Tor, an army cannery was built at the suggestion of Field Marshal Edwin von Manteuffel, of which only the foundations can be seen today. During the expansion of the Südwestrundfunk in 2003, parts of the &quot;Gonsenheimer Tor&quot; were rediscovered during excavation work. The parts were salvaged and restored near the site. Extensive parts of Fort Hartenberg, built in the 19th century, including its mining galleries, also came to light when excavation work began on the site of the Hartenberg Primary School (later &quot;Peter-Jordan School&quot;), which was built around 1965 and demolished in 2018, for a planned residential development in Hartenberg Park. Here, in September 2019, a construction freeze of three months came into effect to allow the archaeologists to survey and document the facilities before they gave way to residential buildings.

The construction of the settlement in Baentschstraße in 1904 marked the beginning of civil housing construction in the borough, which continues until today. In 1928, the Bruchwegstadion was built, where 1 FSV Mainz 05 played its home games until 2011. At the beginning of the 1960s and in the 1970s, massive construction work was carried out on the Hartenberg and Münchfeld and housing was created to alleviate the housing shortage of the post-war period in Mainz city centre.

After the death of Martin Luther King Jr., the city council agreed to the proposal of the city&#x27;s cultural and school committee to rename the &quot;Bruchweg&quot;, which was adjacent to the then &quot;Mainz University Housing Area&quot; of the US Army, as &quot;Dr.-Martin-Luther-King-Weg&quot;. The urban conversion of the &quot;Mainz University Housing Area&quot; brought many apartments for the civilian population of Mainz.

As a result of this development, the former borough Mainz-Innenstadt was dissolved in 1989 and divided into four independent districts. Thus the new district Hartenberg-Münchfeld was created from parts of the borough Mainz-Gonsenheim as well as (east of the Martin-Luther-King-Weg or Am Judensand) the former district city centre. The district consisting of the parts Hartenberg (northeast of the street &quot;An der Allee&quot;) and Münchfeld (southwest of it) has not yet found its own identity.

<text>Zoe Heriot (sometimes spelled Zoe Herriot) is a fictional character played by Wendy Padbury in the long-running British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. A young astrophysicist who lived on a space wheel in the 21st century, she was a companion of the Second Doctor and a regular in the programme from 1968 to 1969. Zoe appeared in eight stories (48 episodes).

==Character history==
Zoe first appears in the serial &quot;The Wheel in Space&quot;, where she is the librarian on board Space Station W3, also known as the Wheel. When the Cybermen attack, she aids the Doctor and Jamie in defeating them before stowing away aboard the TARDIS. In David Whitaker&#x27;s script for &quot;The Wheel in Space&quot;, Zoe&#x27;s last name is spelled &quot;Heriot&quot;, but the double-&quot;r&quot; misspelling is also seen in reference works.

Zoe&#x27;s age is not given in the series, but according to initial publicity she was fifteen when she joined the TARDIS crew. She holds a degree in pure mathematics and is a genius, with intelligence scores comparable to the Doctor&#x27;s. Coupled with her photographic memory and the advanced learning techniques of her era, this makes her somewhat like a human calculator, able to perform complicated mathematics in her head. Part of the reason for her wanting to travel with the Doctor is her chafing at the restrictions and sterile surroundings of her station-bound existence. However, her real-world experience is severely limited, causing her to get herself into trouble frequently.

Together with the Doctor and Jamie, she meets the Cybermen again when they invade 20th-century London, enters the surreal Land of Fiction, fights the Ice Warriors and survives the battlefields of the War Chief&#x27;s war games. Her journeys with the Doctor come to an end in that serial, when the Time Lords finally catch up with the Doctor. As well as forcing a regeneration on him and exiling him to Earth, the Time Lords return Jamie and Zoe to their own times, wiping their memories of their experiences with the Doctor (save for their first encounters with him) in the process.

An illusory image of Zoe appears to the Second Doctor and the Brigadier in Gallifrey&#x27;s Death Zone the 20th-anniversary episode, &quot;The Five Doctors&quot;.

An older Zoe, still played by Padbury, returns in the 60th-anniversary spin-off &quot;Tales of the TARDIS&quot;. She and Jamie, drawn from their respective timelines aboard a Memory Tardis, discover their memories of each and the Doctor have been restored. Zoe describes her life after the events of The War Games; she married an Australian man, has a scientist son she named James, and is currently serving her third term as president.

==Other appearances==
Zoe&#x27;s life after her return to her own time is not further explored in the series. In the spin-off short story &quot;The Tip of the Mind&quot; by Peter Anghelides, it is revealed that although her intellect allows her to resist the memory blocks by the Time Lords, she is unable to access the memories of her time with the Doctor consciously. This causes her strange dreams, and makes her work suffer. An encounter with the Third Doctor makes the memory blocks permanent, but she ultimately never reaches her full potential.

Padbury has appeared in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audio adventures from Big Finish Productions, first as a character other than Zoe in the full-cast audio &quot;Davros&quot;, and then as Zoe in &quot;Fear of the Daleks&quot;, part of the &quot;Companion Chronicles&quot; talking book series. The latter story portrays an older Zoe having detailed dreams of her adventures with the Doctor; she suspects that something is blocking her memory, but she does not know what, and is seeing a psychiatric counselor in an effort to understand the &quot;dreams&quot;. She has returned as Zoe in several more Big Finish plays such as &quot;Echoes of Grey&quot; and her second Companion Chronicle, &quot;Prison in Space&quot;, based on an unmade TV story. &quot;Echoes of Grey&quot; and subsequent follow-up stories, &quot;The Memory Cheats&quot; and &quot;The Uncertainty Principle&quot; depict Zoe being essentially taken prisoner by an unnamed Company whose experiments in creating a new form of life were disrupted by the Doctor, Jamie and Zoe—the TARDIS arriving on Earth a few decades in Zoe&#x27;s future—in &quot;Echoes of Grey&quot;, subsequent stories seeing the Company arresting Zoe&#x27;s older, contemporary self on trumped-up charges to try and provoke Zoe into unlocking her lost memories of her time with the Doctor so that they can harness the secret of time travel. This comes to a head in the audio &quot;Second Chances&quot; when Zoe has a &#x27;flashback&#x27; of the destruction of a space station that will actually take place a few days in the future from her current point in time, allowing Zoe to interact with her past self as she tries to change her history and prevent the station&#x27;s destruction. Although this part of her plan fails, the audio ends with Zoe using a computer virus that has mutated to attack physical matter to destroy the Company and escape, although her mental state and memories of her time with the Doctor are still lost.

An older Zoe is reunited with the Doctor in his sixth incarnation in &quot;Legend of the Cybermen&quot;, where she returns to the Land of Fiction after she is nearly converted by the Cybermen after leaving the Doctor, her attempt to trap the Cybermen in the Land resulting in the universe being endangered by the risk that the Cybermen will harness the computer that controls the Land and use that to influence the imagination of the entire universe. After Zoe draws the Doctor into the Land, she created a fictional duplicate of Jamie to protect the Doctor until he learns the full situation and helps Zoe drive the Cybermen out, at the cost of Zoe losing her memories again as the Doctor takes her home. Zoe and Jamie also meet the Sixth Doctor in the audio &quot;Last of the Cybermen&quot;, but in this case the Sixth Doctor has swapped with the Second shortly before the events of &quot;The War Games&quot;, the Doctor&#x27;s attempt to change his personal history to let his companions keep their memories failing when history is &#x27;reset&#x27; as the Second Doctor returns to his proper place in history.

The novelisation of the TV serial &quot;The Mind Robber&quot; mentions, in passing, that Zoe discussed that adventure &quot;long afterwards&quot;, suggesting that she eventually recovered some or all of her lost memories.

<text>John Owen-Jones (born 5 May 1971) is a Welsh musical theatre actor and singer, best known for his portrayals of Jean Valjean in Alain Boublil &amp; Claude-Michel Schönberg&#x27;s &quot;Les Misérables&quot; and The Phantom in Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;.

He most recently appeared in these roles as an emergency Valjean replacement in the 2021 West End production at the Sondheim Theatre, and as The Phantom in the 2016 West End production at Her Majesty’s Theatre. He has now recorded six studio albums.

==Early life==

Owen-Jones was born in 1971 and originates from Burry Port in Carmarthenshire. He was educated at Glan-y-Mor Comprehensive School, and was a member of the still running local theatre group, Llanelli Youth Theatre. Jones went on to train at the Central School of Speech and Drama in London. He graduated in 1994 with a BA (Hons) in Acting.

He has been married since 1999 to Teresa, a primary school teacher. They live in Surrey with their two children.

==Musical Theatre==
During 1995 he played the &#x27;liebeslieder&#x27; in Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;A Little Night Music&quot; at the National Theatre along with Judi Dench, Patricia Hodge, Joanna Riding and Siân Phillips, and in &quot;The Ladies Paradise&quot; at the RNT Studio.

In 1998, he became the youngest person ever to play the role of Jean Valjean full-time when he took over in the London production at the age of 26. He had previously understudied the role, and had also performed the roles of the Factory Foreman, Feuilly, Grantaire and Enjolras. Owen-Jones also appeared in the choir of the 10th Anniversary Concert at the Royal Albert Hall in 1995.

In 2000, he was part of that year&#x27;s season at the Regent&#x27;s Park Open Air Theatre. He played roles in &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; and &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;. In 2001, he was chosen to succeed Scott Davies in the title role in &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;. He left the role on 26 February 2005, after three and a half years and nearly 1,400 performances, making him the longest running London Phantom. His last performance in this run was with Rachel Barrell. In 2015 he agreed to play the Phantom again for a limited period of time – 7 September 2015 until Saturday 30 January 2016.

His other theatre work includes Antipholus in &quot;The Boys from Syracuse&quot; and Lorenzo in &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; at Harrogate Theatre, Herr Zeller in &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, Cléante in &quot;The Hypochondriac&quot;, Valère in &quot;Le Médecin Volant&quot; at the West Yorkshire Playhouse and &quot;Uprooted&quot; at the Tricycle Theatre, and he performed in a private concert version in London of the musical &quot;Tomorrow Morning&quot; by Laurence Mark Wythe.

Owen-Jones reprised the role of Jean Valjean in &quot;Les Misérables&quot; at the Queen&#x27;s Theatre in London, beginning 27 June 2005. He took a month off in May 2006, during which time he played the role of Gaylord Ravenal in &quot;Show Boat&quot;, the first fully staged musical performed at the Royal Albert Hall, which played for a limited season between 10 and 25 June 2006. He then returned to &quot;Misérables&quot; in the West End until his contract expired on 6 October 2007. After finishing his London contract, Owen-Jones went to the US to perform the role of Valjean on Broadway, trading locales with Drew Sarich, who was playing the role of Valjean in the American production. Owen-Jones began performances on 23 October 2007 and returned in January 2008 when the show finished its Broadway run. Owen-Jones most recently played Valjean on the 25th Anniversary International Touring production of &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, which opened 12 December 2009 in Cardiff, and ended 2 October 2010 at the Barbican Theatre in London, where the show first played.

He performed the role of the Phantom in London once again, as of 1 November 2010 and continued his run until 10 December 2011. His first performance back was with Sofia Escobar. From March 2012, Owen-Jones played the title role in the show&#x27;s 25th Anniversary UK tour opposite Katie Hall. He left the tour that September and was replaced by Earl Carpenter.

On 16 December 2010, Owen-Jones appeared in the Royal Variety Performance at the London Palladium as part of the &#x27;Valjean Quartet&#x27; alongside Alfie Boe, Colm Wilkinson and Simon Bowman (Each of whom have previously played the role of Jean Valjean in various productions of &quot;Les Misérables&quot;). Together they sang &quot;Bring Him Home&quot; just as they had performed at the 25th Anniversary Performance of &quot;Les Misérables&quot; at the O2 Arena. Earlier that week, the recording of the song from the O2 Arena concert had been released as a UK Single.

As part of the 25th anniversary of &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, Owen-Jones performed the title song at The Royal Variety Performance – held in The Lowry, Manchester – on Monday 5 December 2011. Performing alongside Nicole Scherzinger, Owen-Jones was joined by three other former Phantoms (Simon Bowman, Earl Carpenter and Ramin Karimloo). The performance was aired on ITV1 on Wednesday 14 December 2011. He also performed it, along with &quot;The Music of the Night&quot;, with Karimloo, Colm Wilkinson, Peter Jöback and Anthony Warlow, at the 25th anniversary production &quot;The Phantom of the Opera at the Royal Albert Hall&quot; in October 2011. He also sang at the 25th anniversary gala of New York&#x27;s production of the show with Ramin Karimloo, Hugh Panaro, and Peter Joback, the last of whom went on to reprise the role on Broadway for a short time.

Owen-Jones also toured the UK with the Earl Carpenter production of The Three Phantoms, the highlight of which is a trio performance of &#x27;Music of the Night&#x27;. In January 2014, he went to New York to record the concept album for a new Broadway show An American Victory with Hugh Panaro, Ruthie Henshall, Alexander Gemignani, and many other Broadway stars. The musical will be directed by Larry Blank.

In 2015 from October to January 2016 he returned to Phantom of the Opera. Shortly after, Owen-Jones returned to Broadway to reprise the role of Valjean in the production&#x27;s closing cast. On his return from Broadway, Owen-Jones appeared in a concert version of &quot;The Hired Man&quot; at Cadogan Hall.

<text>The Transylvanian peasant revolt (), also known as the peasant revolt of Bábolna or Bobâlna revolt (), was a popular revolt in the eastern territories of the Kingdom of Hungary in 1437. The revolt broke out after George Lépes, bishop of Transylvania, had failed to collect the tithe for years because of a temporary debasement of the coinage, but then demanded the arrears in one sum when coins of higher value were again issued. Most commoners were unable to pay the demanded sum, but the bishop did not renounce his claim and applied interdict and other ecclesiastic penalties to enforce the payment.

The Transylvanian peasants had already been outraged because of the increase of existing seigneurial duties and taxes and the introduction of new taxes during the first decades of the century. The bishop also tried to collect the tithe from the petty noblemen and from Orthodox Vlachs who had settled in parcels abandoned by Catholic peasants. In the spring of 1437, Hungarian and Vlach commoners, poor townspeople from Kolozsvár (now Cluj-Napoca in Romania) and petty noblemen started to assemble on the flat summit of Mount Bábolna near Alparét (Bobâlna) where they set up a fortified camp. The bishop and his brother, Roland Lépes, the deputy of the voivode (or royal governor) of Transylvania, gathered their troops to fight against the rebels. The voivode, the two counts of the Székelys and many Transylvanian noblemen also hurried to the mountain to assist them against the rebels.

The rebels sent envoys to the voivode to inform him about their grievances, but the envoys were captured and executed. The voivode invaded the rebels&#x27; camp, but the peasants resisted and made a successful counter-attack, killing many noblemen during the battle. To prevent the rebels from continuing the war, the bishop and the leaders of the noblemen started negotiations with the rebels&#x27; envoys. Their compromise was recorded in the Kolozsmonostor Abbey on 6 July. The agreement reduced the tithe by half, abolished the ninth (a seigneurial tax), guaranteed the peasants&#x27; right to free movement and authorized them to hold an annual assembly to secure the execution of the agreement.

The noblemen, the counts of the Székelys and the delegates of the Saxon seats concluded a &quot;brotherly union&quot; against their enemies at Kápolna (Căpâlna). The rebellious peasants left their camp and moved towards Dés (Dej). After a battle near the town, the parties concluded a new agreement on 6 October which increased the rent payable by the peasants to the landowners. Shortly thereafter, the peasants invaded the Kolozsmonostor Abbey and took possession of Kolozsvár and Nagyenyed (Aiud). The united armies of the voivode of Transylvania, the counts of the Székelys and the Saxon seats forced the rebels to surrender in January 1438. The leaders of the revolt were executed and other rioters were mutilated at the assembly of the representatives of the Three Nations of Transylvania in February.

==Background==

Transylvania (&quot;the Land beyond the Forests&quot;) was a geographic region in the 15th-century Kingdom of Hungary. Four major ethnic groups – the Hungarians, Saxons, Székelys, and Vlachs (Romanians) – inhabited the territory. The Hungarians, the Hungarian-speaking Székelys, and the Saxons formed sedentary communities, living in villages and towns. Many of the Vlachs were shepherds, herding their flocks between the mountains and the lowlands, but the monarchs and other landowners granted them fiscal privileges to advance their settlement in arable lands from the second half of the century. The Vlachs initially enjoyed a special status, which included that they were to pay tax only on their sheep, but Vlach commoners who settled in royal or private estates quickly lost their liberties. For administrative purposes, Transylvania was divided into counties and seats. The seven Transylvanian counties were subjected to the authority of a high-ranking royal official, the voivode of Transylvania. The seats were the administrative units of the autonomous Saxon and Székely communities.

The voivodes presided over the noblemen&#x27;s general assemblies, which were annually held at a meadow near Torda (Turda). From the early 15th century, the voivodes rarely visited Transylvania, leaving the administration of the counties to their deputies, the vice-voivodes. The Transylvanian noblemen were exempted from taxation in 1324. Noblemen were granted the right to administer justice to the peasants living in their estates in 1342. The prelates acquired the same right in their domains in the second half of the 14th century. In 1366, Louis I of Hungary decreed that an oath taken by a Vlach &quot;knez&quot; (or chieftain) who &quot;had been brought&quot; to his estate by royal writ was equal to a true nobleman&#x27;s oath, but other &quot;knezes&quot; were on a footing of equality with the heads of villages. The legal position of the &quot;knezes&quot; was similar to the &quot;nobles of the Church&quot; and other groups of conditional nobles, but the monarchs frequently rewarded them with true nobility. The ennobled Vlachs enjoyed the same privileges as their ethnic Hungarian peers, thus they became members of the &quot;Hungarian nation&quot; which had been associated with the community of noblemen. On the other hand, the Vlach commoners who lived on their estates lost their liberties.

The Székelys were a community of privileged border guards. They fought in the royal army, for which they were exempted from taxation. A royal official, the count of the Székelys, was their supreme leader, but the Székely seats were administered by elected officials. The Saxons also had the right to elect the magistrates of their seats. They enjoyed personal freedom and paid a lump sum tax to the monarchs. The wealthiest Saxon towns – Bistritz, Hermannstadt and Kronstadt (Bistrița, Sibiu and Brașov) – owned large estates which were cultivated by hundreds of peasants. Dozens of Saxons and Székely families held landed property in the counties, for which they also enjoyed the status of noblemen. Saxon and Székely leaders were occasionally invited to Torda to attend the general assemblies, which enabled the leaders of the three nations to coordinate their actions.

The towns, located in the counties, could hardly compete with the large Saxon centers. Kolozsvár was granted the right to buy landed property from the noblemen or other landowners in 1370, but its burghers were regarded as peasants by the bishops of Transylvania and the abbots of Kolozsmonostor Abbey, who forced them to pay the ninth (a seigneurial tax) on their vineyards until 1409. The merchants from Kolozsvár, Dés and other Transylvanian towns were exempted from internal levies, but the noblemen often ignored that privilege, forcing the merchants to pay duties while travelling across their domains.

The Hungarians, Saxons and Székelys adhered to Roman Catholicism. The Diocese of Transylvania included most of the province, but the Saxons of Southern Transylvania were subjected to the archbishops of Esztergom. Catholic commoners were to pay an ecclesiastic tax, the tithe, but John XXIII exempted the lesser noblemen from paying it in 1415. However, George Lépes, the bishop of Transylvania, ignored this decision, especially after John had been declared an antipope. The Vlachs were originally exempt from the ecclesiastic tax, but Sigismund of Luxemburg, king of Hungary, decreed that the Vlachs who settled on lands abandoned by Catholic peasants were to also pay the tithe. Sigismund was an absent monarch, deeply involved in European politics; he spent much time outside Hungary, especially in his other realms, such as Germany and Bohemia.

The Ottomans attacked Transylvania almost every year starting in 1420. The peasants had to pay the increasing costs for defence against the Ottomans. They were regularly obliged to pay &quot;extraordinary taxes&quot; in addition to the chamber&#x27;s profit (the traditional tax payable by each peasant household to the royal treasury). The king also ordered that every tenth peasant should take up arms in case of an Ottoman attack, although peasants had always been exempt from military obligations. The accommodation of the troops was also an irksome duty, because the soldiers often forced the peasants to supply them with food and clothes. The landowners began to collect the ninth from the peasants. Although the ninth had already been introduced in 1351, it was not regularly collected in Transylvania. The noblemen also made attempts to hinder the free movement of their serfs.

The increasing taxes and the new burdens stirred up the commoners. The Transylvanian Saxons could only overcome their rebellious serfs with the assistance of the vice-voivode, Roland Lépes, in 1417. The united armies of the counties and the Saxon seats crushed the Székely commoners&#x27; uprising in 1433. In early 1434, the burghers of Kronstadt had to seek the assistance of the count of the Székelys against the Vlachs who had risen up in Fogaras County. Hussite ideas, especially their egalitarian Taborite version, began to spread among the peasantry in the 1430s. In May 1436, George Lépes urged the inquisitor James of the Marches to come to Transylvania, because Hussite preachers had converted many people to their faith in his diocese.

==Peasant war==
===Bishop Lépes&#x27;s actions===

In order to tackle financial burdens resulting from the Hussite wars and military campaigns against the Ottoman Empire, Sigismund of Luxemburg put lower value silver coins into circulation in 1432. The new pennies were known as quarting because they contained only a quarter of the silver content of the old currency. Bishop Lépes, who knew that pennies of higher value would again be minted in a few years, suspended the collection of the tithe in 1434.

After the valuable coins were issued, Lépes demanded the tithe for the previous years in one sum. Historians estimate that the peasant families were required to pay six to nine gold florins, although the value of an average peasant lot was only about 40 florins. Most peasants were unable to pay this amount, especially because they also had to pay the seigneurial taxes to the owners of their parcels.

To secure the payment of the arrears, the bishop applied ecclesiastic penalties, placing whole villages under interdict in summer 1436. He also excommunicated the petty noblemen who had refused to pay the tithe. However, most serfs resisted and their lords were unwilling to assist the bishop. At the bishop&#x27;s request, the king ordered the voivode and the &quot;ispáns&quot; (or heads) of the counties to secure the collection of the tithe in early September. The king also decreed that all peasants who failed to pay the arrears within a month after their excommunication were to pay twelve golden florins as a penalty.

===Rebellion breaks out===
The revolt developed from local disturbances in the first half of 1437. The villagers from Daróc, Mákó and Türe (Dorolțu, Macău and Turea) assaulted the abbot of Kolozsmonostor at Bogártelke (Băgara) in March. In Alsó-Fehér County and around Déva (Deva), the serfs gathered into small bands and attacked the noblemen&#x27;s manors. Peasants from Alparét and Bogáta (Bogata de Sus) were the first to settle on the top of the nearby Mount Bábolna in May or June. Being surrounded by high cliffs and dense forests and crowned by a plateau of about , the mountain was an ideal place for defence. Following the Taborites&#x27; military strategy, the rebels established a camp on the flat summit of the mountain.

A lesser nobleman, Antal Nagy de Buda, came with a group of peasants from Diós and Burjánosóbuda (Deușu and Vechea) to the mountain. The Vlach Mihai arrived with people from Virágosberek (Florești). Salt miners from Szék (Sic) and poor townspeople from Kolozsvár joined the peasantry. About 5–6,000 armed men gathered on the plateau by the end of June, according to historian Lajos Demény&#x27;s estimation.

Bishop Lépes and his brother, the vice-voivode, started to assemble their troops near the peasants&#x27; camp. The absent voivode, Ladislaus Csáki, hurried to Transylvania. The counts of the Székelys, Michael Jakcs and Henry Tamási, also joined the united armies of the voivode and the bishop. The young noblemen who joined the campaign wanted to make a sudden assault on the peasants, but the bishop suggested that the peasants should be pacified through negotiations. The delay enabled the rioters to complete the fortification of their camp.

===First battle and compromise===
The peasants elected four envoys to inform the voivode about their grievances. They requested Csáki to put an end to abuses over the collection of the tithe and to persuade the bishop to lift the ecclesiastic bans. They also demanded the confirmation of the serfs&#x27; right to free movement. Instead of entering into negotiations, the voivode had the rebels&#x27; envoys tortured and executed in late June. He soon invaded the rebels&#x27; camp, but the peasants repulsed the attack and encircled his army. During the ensuing battle, many noblemen perished; Bishop Lépes barely escaped from the battlefield.

The representatives of the noblemen and the rebels entered into negotiations in early July. The rebels&#x27; deputies were appointed by their leaders, including Pál Nagy de Vajdaháza, who styled himself &quot;the flag bearer of the &quot;universitas&quot; of the Hungarian and Vlach inhabitants of this part of Transylvania&quot;. The use of the term &quot;universitas&quot; evidences that the peasantry sought the acknowledgement of their liberties as a community. The peasants emphasized that they wanted to &quot;regain their freedoms granted them by the ancient kings, freedoms that had been suppressed by all sorts of subterfuges&quot;, because they were convinced that their liberties had been recorded in a charter during the reign of the first king of Hungary, Saint Stephen. Their belief in a &quot;good king&quot; who had secured his subjects&#x27; welfare in a mythical &quot;golden age&quot; was not unusual in the Middle Ages.

The parties reached a compromise which was recorded in the Kolozsmonostor Abbey on 6 July. They agreed that the tithe would be reduced by half. The payment of the rents, taxes and other levies due to the landowners and the royal treasury was suspended until the tithe was collected. The agreement abolished the ninth and prescribed that the peasants were only required to pay the rent to the landowners. The annual amount of the rent was fixed at 10 denars, much lower than the rent from before the uprising. The noblemen also acknowledged the peasants&#x27; right to free movement, which could only be limited if a peasant failed to fulfill his obligations to the landowner. To keep the execution of the agreement under surveillance, the peasants were authorized to hold an annual assembly at Mount Bábolna. Their assembly was entitled to punish noblemen who had broken the compromise.

The Kolozsmonostor agreement prescribed that the &quot;delegates of the noblemen and the inhabitants of the realm&quot; should ask Sigismund of Luxemburg to send an authentic copy of Stephen&#x27;s charter. The peasants agreed that the provisions of the charter were to be applied in case of a contradiction between the charter and the Kolozsmonostor agreement. The peasants preserved the right to elect delegates and start new negotiations with the representatives of the noblemen if Stephen&#x27;s charter did not properly regulate their obligations towards the landowners.

===Union of the Three Nations===

The bishop and the noblemen regarded the Kolozsmonostor agreement as a temporary compromise. Their motives were to encourage the rebels to demobilize and to give them time to muster new troops. They assembled at Kápolna and started negotiations with the counts of the Székelys and the delegates of the Saxon seats. This was the first occasion when the representatives of the noblemen, Székelys and Saxons held a joint assembly without the authorization of the monarch. They concluded a &quot;brotherly union&quot; against their enemies in early September, pledging to provide military assistance to each other against both internal and foreign aggressors. The bishop seems to have acknowledged that petty noblemen were exempt from paying the tithe, according to Demény, because the Diet of Hungary decreed that noblemen could not be forced to pay the tithe in 1438.

===Second battle and second compromise===

The rebels abandoned their fortified camp on Mount Bábolna, most probably because they needed new provisions. They moved towards Dés, pillaging the noblemen&#x27;s manors during their march. They threatened all who did not support them with severe punishments. They established a new camp on the Szamos (Someș) River near the town. A new battle was fought between the rebels and their enemies near the camp in late September.

After being unable to overcome the rebels, the noblemen started new negotiations with them at Dellőapáti (Apatiu). The representatives of the two parties reached a new compromise on 6 October, which was included in a new charter in the Kolozsmonostor Abbey four days later. For unknown reasons, the peasants accepted less favorable terms than those of the first agreement. Demény argues, their leaders had most probably realized that they were unable to resist for a long time.

According to the new agreement, the minimum amount of the rent payable by the peasants to the landowners was increased to 12 denars per year; peasants who held larger plots were to pay 25 to 100 denars to their lords, which was equal to the sum payable before the uprising. The new agreement did not determine the &quot;gifts&quot; that the peasants were to give to the landowners, only stating that they were required to fulfill this obligation three times a year. The agreement confirmed the noblemen&#x27;s right to administer justice to the peasants living in their estates, but also stipulated that the peasants could appeal against their lords&#x27; decision to the court of a nearby village or small town.

===Last phase===
The second agreement was again regarded as a provisional compromise by both parties. The charter prescribed that a joint delegation of the rebels and the noblemen should be sent to the king, who was staying in Prague, to seek his arbitration. There is no evidence of the appointment of the delegates or their departure for Prague. Sigismund of Luxemburg died on 9 December 1437.

Knowing that their camp on the Szamos could easily be attacked, the rebels marched towards Kolozsvár in October or November. They invaded and pillaged the Báthorys&#x27; estates at Fejérd (Feiurdeni). They also captured and beheaded many noblemen before attacking the abbey and forcing the abbot to flee. A group of rebels took possession of Nagyenyed with the assistance of its poor burghers and the inhabitants of the nearby villages. Most burghers of Kolozsvár also sympathized with the rebels, who thus entered the town without resistance. A Saxon charter recorded that Antal Nagy de Buda died fighting against the noblemen before 15 December. Demény refutes the credibility of the report, saying that all other sources indicate that the peasants were still resisting in January 1438.

The united armies of the new voivode, Desiderius Losonci, and Michael Jakcs laid siege to Kolozsvár. On 9 January, they sent a letter to the Saxon leaders, urging them to send reinforcements to contribute to the destruction of the &quot;faithless peasants&quot;. During the siege, &quot;not one soul could come out or go in&quot; the town, according to the besiegers&#x27; report. The blockade caused a famine which forced the defenders to surrender before the end of January. The rebel groups around Nagyenyed were annihilated around the same time.

==Aftermath and assessment==

The delegates of the three Estates of Transylvania, noblemen (including the ennobled Saxons and Vlachs), Székelys, and Saxons, assembled at Torda on 2 February 1438. They confirmed their &quot;brotherly union&quot; against the rebellious peasants and the Ottoman marauders. Nine leaders of the revolt were executed at the assembly. Other defenders of Kolozsvár were mutilated. Taking advantage of the victory, the leaders of the noblemen also made attempts to harm their personal enemies. For instance, the voivode who wanted to seize some properties of the Báthorys accused them of having cooperated with the rebels. In retaliation for its support of the rebels, Kolozsvár was deprived of its municipal rights on 15 November. However, the burghers attained the restoration of their liberties with the support of John Hunyadi on 21 September 1444.

Contemporaneous letters unanimously described the revolt as a peasant war against their lords. On 22 July 1437, the judge royal, Stephen Báthory, referred to the Transylvanian events as the &quot;peasants&#x27; war&quot;; on 30 September, Roland Lépes mentioned that a nobleman had been wounded &quot;in the general fight against the peasantry&quot;; and Bishop Lépes wrote of the &quot;war of the peasants&quot; on 27 January 1439. Other documents (including the records of the meetings of the town council of Nagyenyed) emphasized that craftsmen and townspeople also joined the revolt. No contemporaneous source recorded that national hatreds played any role in the uprising. On the contrary, the cooperation of the Hungarian and Vlach commoners during the rebellion is well-documented. The first compromise between the rebels and the noblemen explicitly mentioned their common grievances. For instance, the rebels complained that &quot;both the Hungarians and the Vlachs who lived near castles&quot; had arbitrarily been compelled to pay the tithes on their swines and bees.

Historian Joseph Held states, the &quot;conservative stance of the Transylvanian peasant movement was similar to late medieval peasant movements elsewhere in Europe&quot;. The peasants only wanted to secure the abolition of new seigneurial duties and the restoration of the traditional level of their taxes, without calling into question the basic structure of the society. On the other hand, Lajos Demény writes, the movement developed into a &quot;general attack against feudal society&quot; in Transylvania. Both historians conclude that the rebels could not achieve their principal purposes. The peasants&#x27; right to free movement was partially restored, but the landowners were again able to reduce it during the last decade of the century. According to historian Jean Sedlar, Vlach peasants &quot;occupied the lowest rung of the social ladder, superior only to slaves&quot; in medieval Transylvania because of their Orthodox faith. However, no merely ethnic prejudice prevented Vlachs from acquiring land and joining the Hungarian noble class, provided they accepted Catholicism and adopted a noble life-style. At the same time, the fact that upward mobility required the renunciation of Vlach identity clearly hindered this group from developing a sense of ethnic solidarity.

<text>The Renault 5 Turbo or R5 Turbo is a rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout sports car, produced by French automaker Renault, loosely based on their popular Renault 5 hatchback, primarily designed to compete in rally sports. Launched at the Brussels Motor Show in January 1980, the car was sold in a street-legal version, to comply with homologation minimum production numbers regulations, certifying that the R5 Turbo was to a sufficient extent indeed a &quot;production car&quot;.

In side profile, the R5 Turbo looked largely the same as any other 2-door Renault 5 of the contemporaneous first generation, sharing the same greenhouse, rear hatch and doors shape, as well as a very similar looking nose, featuring only design tweaks typical of a sporty model, like a low front spoiler, wider front wheels and tires, widened fender flares to accommodate these, and side skirts that continued from the front airdam. But any similarities with a regular Renault 5 ended there. 

Instead of the rear bench-seat is the engine compartment, housing a turbo-charged engine, far more powerful than in any other R5, and counter to all other first generation Renault 5s, the rear mid-mounted engine was placed transversely, driving a pair of very wide rear wheels, housed in rear quarter panels, widened by , featuring near full-height air-intake grilles on their leading edges, as well as hot air exit vents to the left and right of the respective (standard) tail-light units. Behind the engine compartment, a surprisingly usable luggage compartment was, as usual, accessible through the rear hatch. The nose of the car, however lost much of its function. The now wider spare wheel stayed under the hood, and air entering through the front grille was let out via vents in the bonnet, perhaps adding some downforce.

In the interior remained only two sporty front bucket seats, and occupants faced an avant-garde restyled dashboard, including an asymmetrical steering wheel. Series one units were typically red with blue interior upholstery. The alternative was the reverse.

Despite a hefty price-tag, market demand for the Renault 5 Turbos exceeded the required homologation production minimums, such that a total of 4,987 (1,820 Turbo 1 and 3,167 Turbo 2) R5 Turbos were manufactured during their six-year production run.

==Design==
In response to Lancia&#x27;s rallying success with the mid-engined Stratos, Renault&#x27;s Jean Terramorsi, vice-president of production came up with the idea of creating a new sports version of the Renault 5 Alpine supermini. The distinctive new rear bodywork was styled by Marc Deschamps at Bertone, headed by Chief Designer Marcello Gandini. A Renault 5 Alpine was sent to Bertone in October 1977 to be used as a &quot;mannequin.&quot; The car&#x27;s code name was &quot;Projet 822&quot;.

Although the standard Renault 5 has a front-mounted engine, the 5 Turbo featured a mid-mounted Cléon-Fonte with fuel fed by Bosch K-Jetronic fuel injection and a Garrett AiResearch T3 turbocharger OHV 2 valves per cylinder Inline-four engine placed behind the driver in mid-body in a modified Renault 5 chassis. In standard form, the engine developed at 6000 rpm and maximum torque of at 3250 rpm.

Though it used a modified body from a standard Renault 5 and was badged a Renault 5, the mechanicals were radically different. The most obvious difference was the rear-wheel drive and rear-mid engine instead of the normal version&#x27;s front-wheel drive and front-mounted engine. The engineers creating the Turbo used parts from various other Renault models: the rear suspension was derived from that of the rear-engined Renault Alpine A310 V6 while the five-speed manual transmission was the unit from the Renault 30 TX, rotated through 180 degrees. At the time of its launch, it was the most powerful French production car.

The first 400 production 5 Turbos were made to comply with Group 4 homologation to allow the car to compete in international rallies, and were manufactured at the Alpine factory in Dieppe. Many parts later transferred to the Alpine A310, such as the suspension or alloy wheel set.

===Renault 5 Turbo 2===

Once the homologation models were produced, a second version named Turbo 2 was introduced using more standard Renault 5 parts replacing many of the light-alloy components in the original 5 Turbo version, and dropping the specific Bertone seats and dashboard for the interior of the R5 Alpine. Many parts also became dark grey rather than the iconic red or blue. The Turbo 2 was cheaper but had nearly the same levels of performance, with a top speed of and 0–100 km/h (62 mph) in 6.9 seconds. To differentiate it from the Turbo 2, the original 5 Turbo is often referred as &quot;Turbo 1&quot;.

Although the Turbo 2 is not known as a Homologation special, 200 cars were made to homologate the car for the new Group B class. Known by the &#x27;8221&#x27; number in the chassis VIN, these featured an alloy-roof, a larger 1437cc engine, as well as a range of additional aerodynamic and geometry changes which allowed them to homologate the car that would compete against the Lancia Stratos and the Audi Quattro in Group B rally class.

The concept of a mid-engined small Renault returned with the 1998 announcement of the Renault Clio V6.

==North America==
 The original plan called for 1,000 Renault 5 Turbo cars to be built to meet the requirements for Group 3 homologation, with an eye to building an additional 3,000 factory U.S. Models for sale in the United States. This did not actually happen. 

Instead the vehicle was available to Americans via the burgeoning grey market (1976–1988), in which European street legal cars were converted to U.S. specifications. 

==Awards==
In 2004, &quot;Sports Car International&quot; named the R5 Turbo number nine on the list of Top Sports Cars of the 1980s.

==Motorsport==

The R5 Turbo was conceived with dual intent, promoting the sales of the common R5 and being homologated in the FIA group 3 and 4 categories of the rally championship (today WRC). All the motorsport derivatives were based on the Turbo 1.

The factory pushed the engine output up to for the Critérium des Cévennes, for the Tour de Corse, and by 1984 as much as in the R5 Maxi Turbo. The final Renault 5 Maxi Turbo Superproduction reached and won the 1987 French Supertouring Championship that year.

The Renault 5 Turbo competed in the sub-2000 cc category, thanks to the multiplication factor of 1.4 which was applied to turbocharged engines. FISA restricted tire and wheel sizes based on engine size, so for the Maxi Turbo, Renault enlarged to engine to 1527 cc which brought it up to 2138 cc in the eyes of the regulatory agencies - placing it in the 2000–2500 cc category and allowing for the fitment of wider wheels at the expense of a higher minimum weight.

Driven by Jean Ragnotti in 1981, the 5 Turbo won the Monte Carlo Rally on its first outing in the World Rally Championship. 

==WRC victories==

There are several victories throughout the early 1980s in the national championships in France, Portugal, Switzerland, Hungary, and Spain, as well as victories in international rallies throughout Europe, with wins in iconic rallies such as Monte Carlo. 

After the factory ceased support, it underwent development by many teams and enthusiasts to compete in regional championships and local races in which it was ubiquitous and successful for almost 20 years. 

Later, the newly created historical categories allowed these celebrated cars to return to international events and competitions.

<doc id="1326222" wikidata="Q2639582" url="?curid=1326222" title="Emgann">
<text>Emgann is a left-wing Breton nationalist movement in Brittany, France. Founded in 1982, it soon became one of the principal groups agitating for Breton independence. They describe themselves as a &quot;Left-wing independentist movement&quot; which &quot;fights for the emancipation and the national liberation of the Breton people and their direct representation in European authorities&quot;.

== Origin ==
Emgann emerges from the third Emsav, the revival of Breton nationalism as a leftist movement after the 1960s. It describes itself as anti-capitalist and anti-racist movement. It was formed in 1983 by radical militants within the Breton independence movement after the sudden shift in French politics caused by the 1981 election of a leftist government. Shortly after it was elected, the Mitterrand government granted an amnesty to the nineteen Breton militants still in prison at the time, removing one of the political demands of Breton nationalists. Between their release and the establishment of a left-wing government in Paris, leftist nationalism began to dwindle in Brittany, and Emgann was established in large part in response to this change in the political climate.

Emgann&#x27;s 1988 manifesto also emphasises the importance of solidarity with other national liberation movements, citing Basque nationalists as an example.

One of Emgann&#x27;s particularities is its refusal of all contact with established French political parties, and its atypical pattern of recruitment. At the end of the 1990s, it was largely absent from the universities - the traditional recruiting ground of French radical political movements - but instead tended to recruit new members in urban areas, especially among the young unemployed and under-employed. As a result, the movement&#x27;s militancy tends to be proportionate to the weakness of the local economy.

In 1995, Emgann organised a celebration of the Breton nation called &quot;Devezh Ar Vro&quot;. The movement also publishes a journal called &quot;Combat Breton&quot;, currently edited by Yann Puillandre.

== Connection with the Breton Revolutionary Army==

Emgann&#x27;s leaders are adamant that &quot;Emgann is not the legal mouthpeice of the ARB&quot; (&quot;Armée Révolutionnaire Bretonne&quot; - Breton Revolutionary Army). The ARB is the armed branch of the &quot;Front de Libération de la Bretagne&quot; (&quot;Breton Liberation Front&quot;) - a banned organisation that French law considers to be a terrorist group. Despite Emgann&#x27;s denials of any formal link between the two organisations, its official statements call the ARB a &quot;patriotic resistance organisation&quot; and their journal &quot;Combat Breton&quot; publishes the ARB&#x27;s press releases. 

Emgann claims that it does not approve of the violent actions of the ARB, but it doesn&#x27;t disapprove either, treating them instead as &quot;a logical consequence of the colonialist French state and the desperation of young Bretons.&quot; However, several members of Emgann were arrested and convicted by French courts as accomplices in the theft of several tonnes of explosives from a Breton company in Plévin (Côtes-d&#x27;Armor) in 1999. This theft was followed by a series of bombings attributed to the ARB, including a fatal explosion at a McDonald&#x27;s in Quévert (Côtes-d&#x27;Armor). Ultimately, a former spokesman for Emgann was cleared of conspiracy to commit terrorist acts for the bombings in Quévert and elsewhere. However, since many of the accused were held in provisional detention for several years before their trials, many were released, having been imprisoned for longer than the time they were sentenced to before their trials even started. One has appealed his conviction to the European Court of Human Rights. These lengthy delays and other claimed irregularities in the trial have led to their condemnation by Emgann as a &quot;travesty&quot;.

<doc id="1326226" wikidata="Q7057420" url="?curid=1326226" title="North Woolwich Old Station Museum">
<text>The North Woolwich Old Station Museum was a small railway museum in North Woolwich, in Newham, east London. Located in the former Great Eastern Railway terminal station building at North Woolwich railway station, the museum opened in 1984. It closed in 2008.

== History ==
The station building at North Woolwich was opened in 1847, and was designed by Sir William Tite. The station was bombed during the London Blitz in 1940. The building was in use as a ticket office until 1979 when it was replaced by a more austere building on the one remaining platform. It was derelict for many years until its opening as a museum by the Queen Mother on 20 November 1984. It had been established by the London Borough of Newham and the building owner, the Passmore Edwards Museum Trust.

The line was electrified in 1985 when it became part of the North London Line but closed on 9 December 2006, following the opening of the Docklands Light Railway in the local area. 

The collections included historical materials on railways in East London, model trains, and a non-operational steam locomotive. The building was also used for some local community functions. The station building was Grade II-listed in 1998.

=== Closure ===
By 2008, the Borough of Newham was no longer able to finance the Museum. Its closure was finalised in November 2008. By 2011 all externally visible displays including the rolling stock and signage had been removed. Most loans were returned to their private lenders, with other items dispersed to the East Anglian Railway Museum, Mangapps Railway Museum and the Great Eastern Railway Society and some items retained by Newham Heritage Service, also heir to the collections of the Passmore Edwards Museum.

The building has been disused since. It remains owned by the River Lea Tidal Mill Trust (now House Mill Trust). It was put up for sale in 2020.

<doc id="1326228" wikidata="Q1131126" url="?curid=1326228" title="Price system">
<text>In economics, a price system is a system through which the valuations of any forms of property (tangible or intangible) are determined. All societies use price systems in the allocation and exchange of resources as a consequence of scarcity. Even in a barter system with no money, price systems are still utilized in the determination of exchange ratios (relative valuations) between the properties being exchanged.

A price system may be either a regulated price system (such as a fixed price system) where prices are administered by an authority, or it may be a free price system (such as a market system) where prices are left to float &quot;freely&quot; as determined by supply and demand without the intervention of an authority. A mixed price system involves a combination of both regulated and free price systems.

== History ==
Price systems have been around as long as there has been economic exchanges. 

The price system has transformed into the system of global capitalism that is present in the early 21st century. The Soviet Union and other Communist states with a centralized planned economy maintained controlled price systems. Whether the ruble or the dollar is used in the economic system, the criterion of a price system is the use of money as an arbiter and usual final arbiter of whether a thing is done or not. In other words, few things are done without consideration for the monetary costs and the potential making of a profit in a price system.

=== Debate on socialism ===

The American economist Thorstein Veblen wrote a seminal tract on the development of the term as discussed in this article: &quot;The Engineers and the Price System&quot;. Its chapter VI, &quot;A Memorandum on a Practicable Soviet of Technicians&quot; discusses the possibility of socialist revolution in the United States comparable to that then occurring in Russia (the Soviets had not yet at that time become a state (USSR formed in 1922)).

According to Bockman, the original conception of socialism involved the substitution of money as a unit of calculation and monetary prices as a whole with calculation in kind (or valuation based on natural units), with business and financial decisions replaced by engineering and technical criteria for managing the economy. Fundamentally, this meant that socialism would operate under different economic dynamics than those of capitalism and the price system. 

In the 1930s, the economists Oskar Lange and Abba Lerner developed a comprehensive model of a socialist economy that utilized a price system and money for the allocation of capital goods. In contrast to a free-market price system, &quot;socialist&quot; prices would be set by a planning board to equal the marginal cost of production to achieve neoclassical Pareto efficiency. Because this model of socialism relied upon money and administered prices as opposed to non-monetary calculation in physical magnitudes, it was labelled &quot;market socialism&quot;. In effect, Oskar Lange conceded that calculations in a socialist system would have to be performed in value terms with a functioning price system rather than using purely natural or engineering criteria as in the classic concept of socialism.

===Hayek===

Austrian School economist Friedrich Hayek argued that a free price system allowed economic coordination via the price signals that changing prices send, which is regarded as one of his most significant and influential contributions to economics.

In &quot;The Use of Knowledge in Society&quot; (1945), Hayek wrote, &quot;The price system is just one of those formations which man has learned to use (though he is still very far from having learned to make the best use of it) after he had stumbled upon it without understanding it. Through it not only a division of labor but also a coordinated utilization of resources based on an equally divided knowledge has become possible. The people who like to deride any suggestion that this may be so usually distort the argument by insinuating that it asserts that by some miracle just that sort of system has spontaneously grown up which is best suited to modern civilization. It is the other way round: man has been able to develop that division of labor on which our civilization is based because he happened to stumble upon a method which made it possible. Had he not done so, he might still have developed some other, altogether different, type of civilization, something like the &quot;state&quot; of the termite ants, or some other altogether unimaginable type.&quot;

<text>Byung-hyun Kim (; or ; born January 19, 1979) is a South Korean former professional baseball pitcher. He had his most successful years with the Arizona Diamondbacks and the Boston Red Sox.

Kim is remembered for his role in the 2001 World Series, in which he gave up consecutive ninth-inning leads in both Game 4 and Game 5, taking the loss in Game 4, though the Diamondbacks rebounded to win the Championship in seven games over the New York Yankees. Kim went on to save 36 games for the Diamondbacks in 2002 and 16 for the Red Sox in 2003, and played in the 2002 All Star Game. He is the first Korean player to win a World Series.

==Early career==
Kim is a 1997 graduate of Gwangju Jeil High School. Jae Seo and Hee-seop Choi were Kim&#x27;s teammates in 1996 and they are very close friends. Named both the Most Valuable Player and Most Valuable Pitcher for the National High School championships in South Korea, Kim was selected to the 1996 National Junior Team, then named to the National Team in both 1997 and 1998. In that year, he pitched against the US Olympic team, striking out 15 batters in 6 innings. Later, he helped Korea claim the gold medal in the Asian Games held in Bangkok, Thailand. Kim attended Sungkyunkwan University&#x27;s Faculty of Law until 1999.

== Professional career ==

=== 1999 season ===
Kim was signed by the Arizona Diamondbacks on February 19, 1999. Kim went 2–0 with 32 strikeouts in 21.1 innings in El Paso (AA) and then went to Tucson Sidewinders (AAA), where he posted 2–0 with 21 strikeouts in 17.1 innings. His ability to strike out batters caught the attention of Diamondbacks coaching staff. He was the youngest player in MLB at the time he debuted on May 29 at Shea Stadium. He came in to pitch in the bottom of the ninth inning, and after retiring Edgardo Alfonzo and John Olerud, struck out Mike Piazza and got the save in the Diamondbacks&#x27; 8–7 victory over the New York Mets.

On June 9, 1999, during a game against the Chicago Cubs, a bandage covered in a foreign substance fell from Kim&#x27;s sleeve after a pitch. He was immediately ejected by umpire Ed Montague for possessing the illegal item but was not disciplined further.

===2000 season===
In the season, Kim got the closer role when incumbent Matt Mantei opened the season on the disabled list. For the year, Kim struck out 111 hitters in just 70.2 innings pitched (14.14 per nine innings), including 11 out of 12 batters over five games, and twice struck out eight consecutive batters. After his 14 saves and a 1.82 ERA over his first 28 appearances, he was demoted to Triple-A Tucson at the end of July. Mostly used as a starter to restore his confidence, Kim returned to Arizona a month later. With Mantei reinserted as the closer, Kim pitched as a setup man and also started a game after recording 84 relief appearances.

===2001 season and the road to the World Series===
Arizona turned to Kim again as a closer after Mantei was lost to injury for the remaining season. Kim responded with 19 saves, a 2.94 ERA, and 113 strikeouts in 98 innings.

He made his first career postseason appearance in the NLDS Game 3 at Busch Stadium to protect the Diamondbacks’ 5–3 lead against the Cardinals with the go-ahead run at the plate in the 8th inning. After a walk to Albert Pujols that loaded the bases, Kim ended the inning with a center-field flyout. In the 9th inning, Kim saved the game with the game-ending double play off Mark McGwire&#x27;s bat.

In the NLCS against the Atlanta Braves, Kim worked a scoreless inning in Game 2, in which the Diamondbacks lost. Kim then picked up saves in Games 4 and 5 for the Diamondbacks. Kim entered Game 4 in the 8th inning with the Diamondbacks leading 7–3. However, prior to Kim entering the game, The D-backs had worked themselves into a bases loaded jam with no one out. Kim pitched masterfully in the inning, ending the bases loaded jam with a double play and a lineout. He then retired the next three batters in the 9th inning and picked up the save. The next night, Kim pitched another two shut-out innings and earned the two-inning save that clinched the Diamondbacks’ ticket to the World Series. Kim became the first pitcher since Goose Gossage to earn two-inning saves on back-to-back days in the postseason. In the 2004 postseason, Houston Astros closer Brad Lidge matched Gossage and Kim&#x27;s feat.

With the Diamondbacks up two games to one going into Game 4 of the World Series, Kim relieved Curt Schilling in the eighth inning with the Diamondbacks leading 3–1. Kim struck out Shane Spencer, Scott Brosius, Alfonso Soriano, and Bernie Williams and grounded out Derek Jeter. But Paul O&#x27;Neill hit a single off Kim before Williams&#x27; plate appearance and Tino Martinez&#x27;s two-out, two-run home run tied the game in the bottom of the ninth inning. With another home run hit off Kim by Jeter in the bottom of the tenth, the Yankees won the game and tied the Series. Kim threw more than 60 pitches and was charged with the loss. The night after, in Game 5, Diamondbacks manager Bob Brenly sent Kim again to the mound to protect the Diamondbacks&#x27; 2–0 lead. Jorge Posada hit a leadoff double off Kim, and after retiring Spencer and Chuck Knoblauch on a groundout and strikeout, Brosius then hit a two-run home run to tie the score. Later, Soriano hit a single in the bottom of the 12th to win the game.

Despite Kim&#x27;s performances in Games 4 and 5, the Diamondbacks clinched the World Series Championship in Game 7 at Bank One Ballpark. He became the first Asian-born and Korean-born baseball player to appear and win a World Series title.

Kim later revealed in an interview how he felt during the 2001 World Series. &quot;We went through the whole season, approximately 25 guys and then the coaching staff. That time it was like old people. They said, &#x27;OK, we got last chance.&#x27; Some people said if we don&#x27;t win, next year everybody&#x27;s gone.&quot; Kim continued, &quot;Then I gave up a home run. I didn&#x27;t feel good. But we won.&quot;

===2002 season===
In , Kim set a single-season franchise record for saves (36), breaking the old mark set by Gregg Olson in (30). Kim finished the season with an 8–3 record, 92 strikeouts, and a career-best 2.04 ERA in a team-high 72 appearances. On May 11, 2002, Kim struck out all three batters on nine total pitches in the eighth inning of a 10-inning 6–5 win over the Philadelphia Phillies; he became the 23rd National League pitcher and the 32nd pitcher in major-league history to pitch an immaculate inning.

On June 12, 2002, Kim pitched two shut-out innings with four strikeouts and saved the Diamondbacks&#x27; 9–5 win over the New York Yankees at Yankee Stadium.

In 2002, Kim converted 36 of 42 save opportunities, eighth-best in the NL. Kim was selected for the All-Star Game.

===2003–2004===
When Matt Mantei returned from the disabled list and became the Arizona Diamondbacks&#x27; closer, Kim joined the starting rotation. As a Diamondbacks starter, he compiled a record of 1–5 with a 3.56 ERA. On May 29, Kim was traded to Boston for Shea Hillenbrand. Kim remained as a starter through June, but the Red Sox needed him as their closer because the Red Sox&#x27;s closer-by-committee approach implemented following the advice of statistician and Red Sox adviser Bill James was failing. On June 27, Kim made his final start for the 2003 season in Boston&#x27;s 25–8 win against the Florida Marlins at Fenway Park.

Kim became the Red Sox closer in July, converting 16 out of 19 save opportunities despite pitching through lingering ankle and shoulder pain caused by the injury he sustained in April. Although he did not give up an earned run in September, by the time the postseason started Kim was not healthy enough to be effective on the pitching mound.

Kim was pulled in the bottom of the ninth inning with two outs in his only ALDS appearance in Game 1 against the Oakland Athletics. During the lineup announcement in Game 3 at Fenway Park, Red Sox fans intensely booed him. Thinking that he did not deserve the booing after he pitched despite being in pain to advance the Red Sox to the postseason, Kim gave them the middle finger, but later issued an apology. Because of shoulder stiffness, Kim was left off the ALCS roster.

As a starter, Kim went 3–6 with a 3.38 ERA in 12 appearances in . In the beginning of 2004, however, problems with his balance—a lingering effect of the 2003 ankle injury—made him ineffective and cost him a spot in the starting rotation after going 1–1 with a 6.17 ERA in three starts. Bronson Arroyo took Kim&#x27;s starting rotation spot and Kim was optioned to Triple-A Pawtucket in May. Kim rejoined the Red Sox in September. He was assigned to the bullpen and won one game in 5⅔ innings of work. Despite not being on the Red Sox roster for their 2004 World Series championship run, he was awarded his second World Series ring by the team.

Kim briefly became a subject of talks between high-ranking U.S. and South Korean diplomats in August 2004. Upon his arrival in Seoul as the new U.S. Ambassador to Korea in August 2004, Christopher R. Hill spoke with his Korean diplomatic counterparts about Kim and the Red Sox, along with the U.S.–Korea relationship and other diplomatic and geopolitical issues surrounding the Korean peninsula.

===2005 season===
Before the 2005 season, the Red Sox sent Kim to the Colorado Rockies, with general manager Theo Epstein calling the two-year deal given to him in 2004 &quot;a mistake.&quot; Kim was traded for left-handed pitcher Chris Narveson, who was optioned to Triple-A Pawtucket, and catcher Charles Johnson, who was immediately designated for assignment and released. As part of the trade, Colorado sent Boston $2.6 million to equalize the salaries.

Rockies manager Clint Hurdle gave Kim the choice of taking a spot in the bullpen (Kim posted 0–3 with 7.84 ERA as a middle reliever for the Rockies that season) or a starter position in the Rockies&#x27; Triple-A team Colorado Springs Sky Sox. Just 20 minutes later, Hurdle was told that Rockies starter Shawn Chacón was injured and had to go to the disabled list, opening a spot in the Rockies starting rotation for Kim.

On August 8, Sunny Kim, another South Korean starting pitcher who had just joined the Rockies from the Washington Nationals, and Kim started doubleheader games at Coors Field against the Florida Marlins. They became the first two pitchers with same last name to start both ends of doubleheader since Gaylord and Jim Perry for the Cleveland Indians in 1974. The Rockies won both games and Kim collected a win.

Kim finished the season 5–9 with a 4.37 ERA as a starter. He filed for free agency on November 1, 2005, and re-signed with the Rockies. He earned $1.25 million in 2006 with a club option worth $2.5 million in 2007 (with a $250,000 buyout).

===2006 World Baseball Classic===
Kim represented Korea in the World Baseball Classic, a tournament held during spring training before the 2006 season. Kim was credited with solid shutout middle relief performances during the tournament in Korea&#x27;s wins against Taiwan in the first round and Japan and the United States. in the second round. Kim collected a relief-win against Japan in the second round. In the semifinal game against Japan, Kim relieved Jun Byung-doo in the 7th inning and then allowed a two-run home run to Kosuke Fukudome. Kim intentionally hit the next batter Michihiro Ogasawara. Korea lost the semifinal game and finished third in the tournament.

===2006 season===
Kim began the 2006 campaign with the Colorado Rockies on the disabled list. Upon his successful rehabilitation, he made his season debut on April 30, 2006, against the Florida Marlins in Miami. Kim pitched impressively, giving up only one run on five hits while striking out nine batters. Kim established himself in the Rockies starting rotation for the season.

On May 22, 2006, Kim and his former high school teammate and then-Los Angeles Dodgers&#x27; starter Jae Seo started against each other. This game was the first game in which two Korean pitchers started against each other in the Major League history. Both pitchers had quality starts, with Seo getting the win.

On May 28, Barry Bonds hit his 715th home run off Kim at SBC Park and surpassed Babe Ruth&#x27;s 714 career home runs and put himself in sole possession of second place on the all-time career home runs list. After a three-minute delay, Kim struck out the next two batters and pitched 5 innings to collect a win.

On July 28, 2006, Kim had five consecutive strikeouts against the San Diego Padres, tying the Rockies record for consecutive strikeouts. In four different starts, he recorded nine strikeouts each against the Florida Marlins, Houston Astros, Pittsburgh Pirates and Washington Nationals. Kim became the only pitcher in Major League history to pitch shutout wins in consecutive starts at Coors Field by beating the Oakland Athletics on June 19 and the Texas Rangers on June 25.

===2007 season===
Kim began the season with the Colorado Rockies as a reliever after he lost his starting rotation spot to Josh Fogg. The Rockies&#x27; decision to move Kim to the bullpen was controversial. Kim contended that he was not given a fair opportunity during Spring training to compete for a starting spot and asked to be traded.

After a spot start on April 15, Kim was placed on the disabled list with an injured thumb. He was assigned to the Rockies&#x27; Triple-A team, the Colorado Springs Sky Sox, for a rehab assignment. Kim was concerned that his rehab assignment was longer than necessary and changed his agent to Scott Boras in an effort to get a quicker trade. On May 13, 2007, he was traded to the Florida Marlins for Jorge Julio. As a Marlin, he proved himself as a dependable starter.

On August 1, Kim collected his 50th career win with a career-high ten strikeouts in his starting matchup against Colorado Rockies&#x27; Josh Fogg.

Two days later, Kim was claimed off waivers by the Arizona Diamondbacks. Kim&#x27;s return to Arizona lasted two starts; the Diamondbacks designated him and Joe Kennedy for assignment on August 14. Shortly after Kim left the team, Diamondbacks closer José Valverde broke Kim&#x27;s franchise single-season save record.

On August 25, 2007, the Florida Marlins re-signed Kim as a free agent.

On September 28, Kim collected his tenth win of the season against the Mets at Shea Stadium and became the second South Korean pitcher after Chan Ho Park to win ten games in a Major League season.

===2008 season===
On February 24, 2008, Kim signed a contract with the Pittsburgh Pirates. The Pirates had planned to use Kim exclusively in the bullpen. Kim made his first spring training appearance on March 10, 2008. After a disappointing spring training performance, Kim was released by the Pirates on March 25.

===2010 season===
On February 1, 2010, Kim agreed to a minor league contract with the San Francisco Giants. On March 20, 2010, the Giants granted him his release after he appeared in just one minor league game.
Kim later played with the Orange County Flyers of the Golden Baseball League in 2010.

===2011 season===
On January 25, Kim signed a one-year deal with the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles of the Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB). That year in the NPB, Kim went 0–1 with a 2.66 ERA in 18 games.

On November 21, 2011, he became free agent.

===2012–2015===
On January 18, 2012, it was announced that Kim signed a one-year deal with the Seoul-based team the Nexen Heroes of the KBO League. After being used primarily in relief in the MLB and NPB, Kim was often used as a starting pitcher in the KBO.

On April 10, 2014, he was traded to the Kia Tigers.

He retired from the KBO in 2015 with a career record of 11–23, an ERA of 6.19, and 190 strikeouts.

=== 2018 season ===
Kim returned to professional baseball at age 39 in 2018, making nine relief appearances for the Melbourne Aces of the Australian Baseball League, compiling a 1–0 record with an ERA of 0.93 and nine strikeouts in 9-2/3 innings.

==Pitching style==
Usually described as a submarine pitcher, Kim was a side-arm and under-arm hard thrower who uses a great variety of deliveries. Kim possesses a four-seam fastball with tailing movement frequently hitting the low 90s, a Frisbee slider with sweeping motion across the plate, an up-shoot slider with a rising motion, and a circle-changeup which he usually uses to strike out left-handed hitters. Nevertheless, during the three seasons between and , his main problem had been the loss of right pitching balance which caused difficulty in ball control and reduced ball velocity. During that time, he also struggled against left-handed batters. In 2014, Hall of Famer, and perennial award-winning third baseman Adrián Beltré named Kim as the toughest pitcher he had ever faced, due in large part to his pitching motion.

<doc id="1326251" wikidata="Q624443" url="?curid=1326251" title="Arabuko Sokoke National Park">
<text>The Arabuko Sokoke Forest Reserve is located on the coast of Kenya, 110 km north of Mombasa and is protected as a national Forest Reserve. The Arabuko Sokoke National Park, situated at the north-western edge of the Arabuko Sokoke Forest Reserve, is only a few square kilometres in size and constitutes only a small portion of the latter.

==Protection==
The National Park was gazetted only in the late 1980s and in fact straddles the Forest Reserve boundary, with about 50% lying outside the boundary. This outer section actually lies outside an electric elephant fence installed in 2006/7 and is now fully inhabited by local communities to the extent that there is no sign on the ground to show where the National Park begins or ends. The National Park doesn&#x27;t add any particular protection to the forest which is the largest fragment of coastal forest (420 square km) left in East Africa.

The Forest Reserve, on the other hand, is jointly managed by the Kenya Forest Service, Kenya Wildlife Service, National Museums of Kenya and the Kenya Forest Research Institute, Community Forest Associations and Friends of Arabuko Sokoke Forest, and is one of the better protected forests in Kenya. The forest was first protected as a Crown Forest in 1943, and was gazetted in the 1960s. The forest is threatened by the desire for land by local people. Several national and international conservation organisations are working with the Kenya Wildlife Service to protect the park.

==Wildlife==
The Arabuko Sokoke Forest is an area of high endemism, containing endemic mammals, birds and plants. It contains three forest types, mixed forest, &quot;Brachystegia&quot; and &quot;Cynometra&quot;, each of which protects different communities of plants and animals.

It protects many endemic and near-endemic species. The Clarke&#x27;s weaver is completely endemic to the forest, while the eponymous Sokoke scops owl, Sokoke pipit, and the Amani sunbird and spotted ground thrush are found only here and in a forest fragment in Tanzania. The park adjoins &quot;Mida Creek&quot;, a mangrove forest that is an important shorebird wintering ground, protecting species such as the Terek sandpiper and the crab plover.

The endearing leopard, golden-rumped elephant shrew, an endemic elephant shrew, is the most noticeable of the park&#x27;s endemic mammals; the Sokoke bushy-tailed mongoose and Aders&#x27;s duiker (found only here and in Zanzibar) are more elusive. The forest also has savannah elephants, African civets, as well as sokokes, baboons and vervet monkeys. The park is also recognised as an outstanding centre of amphibian diversity.

<doc id="1326257" wikidata="Q155466" url="?curid=1326257" title="James Clerk Maxwell Telescope">
<text>The James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) is a submillimetre-wavelength radio telescope at Mauna Kea Observatory in Hawaii, US. The telescope is near the summit of Mauna Kea at . Its primary mirror is 15 metres (16.4 yards) across: it is the largest single-dish telescope that operates in submillimetre wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum (far-infrared to microwave). Scientists use it to study the Solar System, interstellar dust and gas, and distant galaxies.

The JCMT started operations in 1987, and was funded until February 2015 by a partnership between the United Kingdom and Canada, and the Netherlands. It was operated by the Joint Astronomy Centre and was named in honour of mathematical physicist James Clerk Maxwell. In March 2015 the operation of the JCMT was taken over by the East Asian Observatory. Funding is provided by the National Astronomical Observatory of China, National Astronomical Observatory of Japan, Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute, and the Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics of Taiwan.

The telescope was combined with the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory next to it to form the first submillimetre astronomical interferometer. This success was important driving the construction of the later Submillimeter Array and the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) interferometers.

In recent years the JCMT has also taken part in Event Horizon Telescope observations, which produced the first direct image of a black hole. The JCMT was also involved in the discovery of phosphine, a potential biomarker, in the atmosphere of Venus.

==History==
In the late 1960s, the Astronomy Committee of the UK&#x27;s Science Research Council (SRC, the forerunner of STFC) considered the importance of astronomical observations at submillimetre and millimetre wavelengths. After a series of proposals and debates, in 1975, the SRC millimetre steering committee concluded that it would be possible to construct a 15-metre diameter telescope capable of observing at wavelengths down to 750–800 μm. The project, then called the National New Technology Telescope (NNTT), was to be an 80/20 per cent collaboration with the Netherlands Organisation for the Advancement of Science. Site tests were made at Mauna Kea in Hawaii, the Pinaleno Mountains in Arizona, and a site in Chile; and Mauna Kea was chosen. The NNTT was to be larger and with more instruments than competing telescopes such as the CSO and SMT.

The final specifications called for the &quot;world&#x27;s largest telescope optimised for submillimetre wavelengths&quot;. It was to be a parabolic 15-metre antenna composed of 276 individually adjustable panels with a surface accuracy of better than 50 μm. It would be an altitude-azimuth mounted Cassegrain telescope with a tertiary mirror to direct the incoming radiation onto a number of different receivers. The antenna and mountings were to be protected from the elements by a co-rotating carousel with a transparent membrane stretched across the carousel aperture. Building work started in 1983 and went well.

In 1984, the telescope was shipped from England to Hawaii. After the original shipper broke down at the last minute, the telescope was given to a commercial captain who was supposed to deliver it directly to Hawaii. Instead, the captain sailed to Holland to pick up a shipment of explosives, then was delayed at the Panama Canal, allegedly because special clearance was needed to transport the explosives through the canal. The captain then delivered the explosives to Ecuador before finally reaching Hawaii. Waiting just outside of territorial waters, the captain demanded that the late delivery charges -- now almost equal to that of the shipping charges -- be waived, and threatened to throw the telescope overboard if his demand was not met. The telescope team was able to get a court order to give up the board, and the ship was subsequently boarded and the captain arrested at gunpoint by the Coast Guard. The telescope saw first light in 1987. The name for the final facility was changed to the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope.

The telescope itself was operated by the Joint Astronomy Centre (JAC), from Hilo, Hawaii. 
From 1987 until March 2013 the telescope was funded by a partnership of the United Kingdom (55 per cent), Canada (25 per cent), and the Netherlands (20 per cent). In 2013 the Netherlands withdrew, and until 2015 the shares became UK 75 per cent, Canada 25 per cent. 
In March 2015, the UK and Canada handed over ownership of the JCMT to the East Asian Observatory, which is funded by Japan, China, Taiwan and South-Korea, together with a consortium of Universities from the United Kingdom and Canada.

==Instrumentation==

The JCMT has two kinds of instruments: broadband continuum receivers and heterodyne detection spectral line receivers.

Continuum emission is a tracer of star formation in other galaxies and gives astronomers clues to the presence, distance, and evolution history of galaxies other than our own. Within our own galaxy dust emission is associated with stellar nurseries and planet forming star systems.

Spectral-line observations can be used to identify particular molecules in molecular clouds, study their distribution and chemistry and determine gas velocity gradients across astronomical objects (because of the doppler effect).

===SCUBA===

The older continuum single pixel UKT14 bolometer receiver was replaced around 1995 by the Submillimetre Common-User Bolometer Array (SCUBA). This instrument operated simultaneously at wavelengths of 450 and 850 micron (with 91 and 37 pixels, respectively), and was sensitive to the thermal emission from interstellar dust. SCUBA was a ground-breaking instrument, among the most high-impact astronomy instruments from 1997-2003; it was retired from service in 2005, and is now in the National Museum of Scotland.

===SCUBA-2===
SCUBA was succeeded by SCUBA-2, which was commissioned in 2011. This ground-breaking camera consists of large arrays of superconducting transition edge sensors with a mapping speed hundreds of times larger than SCUBA. It has 5120 array elements at both 450 and 850 micron wavelength (10,240 total pixels). It has been conducting the JCMT legacy surveys since November, 2011, including the SCUBA-2 All Sky Survey, and was made available for general astronomical observations in February, 2012. Two ancillary instruments, FTS-2 and POL-2, add spectroscopic and polarimetric capabilities to SCUBA-2.

===Spectral line detectors===
The JCMT is also equipped with two heterodyne receivers, which allow submillimetre spectral line observations to be made. The spectral-line mapping capabilities of the JCMT have been greatly enhanced by the commissioning in 2006 of HARP, a 350 GHz, 16 element heterodyne array receiver. Both instruments can be used in conjunction with the JCMT&#x27;s new digital autocorrelation spectrometer, ACSIS. One of the heterodyne receivers is named Namakanui (&quot;Big-Eyes&quot;), referring to big-eyed fish that swim in Hawaiian waters at night. This receiver can operate at 86, 230, and 345 GHz.

<text>The pygmy mouse lemur (Microcebus myoxinus), also known as Peters&#x27; mouse lemur or dormouse lemur, is a primate weighing only ; it is the second smallest of the mouse lemurs. Its dorsal side is a rufous-brown colour, and creamy-white ventrally. It lives in dry deciduous forests of western Madagascar. It has been captured in the Tsingy de Bemaraha Nature Reserve, the Andramasy forests north of Belo sur Tsiribihina, and the border of heavily degraded deciduous forest and savanna at Aboalimena. It has also been found in other habitats, in mangroves in two localities.

Accounts and descriptions of this species are frequently confounded with those of &quot;Microcebus berthae&quot;, the smallest primate in the world. This is because specimens of &quot;M. berthae&quot; captured in Kirindy Forest, 60 km north of Morondava, were erroneously named &quot;M. myoxinus&quot;. Apparently, the rufous color of &quot;M. berthae&quot; (not described at the time) matched the description by Peter as &quot;M. myoxinus&quot;. Most articles on the web report information on &quot;M. myoxinus&quot; that correspond to studies made in Kirindy Forest on &quot;M. berthae&quot;.

The behavior and ecology of &quot;Microcebus myoxinus&quot; remains to be studied in the wild.

The pygmy mouse lemur measures around (head-body length).

== Mating ==
During mating season, male pygmy mouse lemurs have a home range that is much larger than the home range of females. It was found that males would typically roam long distances at night during mating season. Males also tend to be heavier than females during the mating season compared to the rest of the year. This indicates that the testes of male pygmy mouse lemurs would grow a significant amount during the mating season. There has also been evidence of male sperm competition, seen through sperm plugs in females which indicate the importance of prevention of additional matings in females.

== Hibernation ==
During the dry season, pygmy mouse lemurs enter a state of inactivity to save energy. This is possible for them in natural conditions when their body temperatures are below . Compared to males, female pygmy mouse lemurs are more likely to enter this type of hibernation which results in the sex ratio being skewed to one side. However, when the pygmy mouse lemurs live in areas where the temperatures are relatively higher, the sex ratio is more even. This is because higher temperatures make it difficult for the lemurs to remain in hibernation for a long time. For those living in cooler temperatures, metabolic rates drop by about 86% compared to the normal metabolic rates.

== Genetics ==
For many years, pygmy mouse lemurs were not considered to be a different species when compared to other mouse lemurs. However, recently there have been studies that show that there are large genetic differences of the DNA. This made it evident that the pymgy mouse lemur could be classified into its own species, rather than being grouped with another species of mouse lemur. Even with these morphological differences found among the species of mouse lemurs, there is still more need for studies to be doen on the chromosome variation of all the mouse lemur species.
