<text>The gens Flavia was a plebeian family at ancient Rome. Its members are first mentioned during the last three centuries of the Republic. The first of the Flavii to achieve prominence was Marcus Flavius, tribune of the plebs in 327 and 323 BC; however, no Flavius attained the consulship until Gaius Flavius Fimbria in 104 BC. The gens became illustrious during the first century AD, when the family of the Flavii Sabini claimed the imperial dignity.

Under the Empire, the number of persons bearing this nomen becomes very large, perhaps due to the great number of freedmen under the Flavian dynasty of emperors. It was a common practice for freedmen to assume the nomina of their patrons, and so countless persons who obtained the Roman franchise under the Flavian emperors adopted the name &quot;Flavius&quot;, which was then handed down to their descendants. Freedmen under the Constantinian dynasty, whose members were also called &quot;Flavius&quot;, also adopted it, as did individuals who entered government service during their rule, often replacing their original nomina with the dynastic &quot;Flavius&quot;.

The vast majority of persons named &quot;Flavius&quot; during the later Empire could not have been descended from the Flavia gens; and indeed, the distinction between nomina and cognomina was all but lost, so that in many cases one cannot even determine with certainty whether it is a nomen or a cognomen. However, because it is impossible to determine which of these persons used &quot;Flavius&quot; as a gentile name, they have been listed below.

==Origin==
The Flavii of the Republic claimed Sabine ancestry, and may have been related to the Flavii who lived at Reate during the first century AD, from whom the emperor Vespasian descended; but the gentilicium is also found in other parts of Italy, such as Etruria and Lucania. The nomen &quot;Flavius&quot; is of Latin origin, and is derived from the surname &quot;Flavus&quot;, used by a number of gentes, and meaning &quot;golden&quot; or &quot;golden-brown&quot;. It probably referred to the blond hair possessed by an early member of the family.

==Later use==
During the later period of the Empire, the name &quot;Flavius&quot; frequently descended from one emperor to another, beginning with Constantius Chlorus, the father of Constantine the Great. The name became so ubiquitous that it was sometimes treated as a praenomen, to the extent of being regularly abbreviated &quot;Fl.&quot;, and it is even described as a praenomen in some sources, although it was never truly used as a personal name, and from the time of Honorius it appears chiefly in letters. It once again became a regular part of the nomenclature of the eastern emperors from Justinian I through the reign of Constantine IV, and appearing as late as the reign of Leo VI in the tenth century. After the name fell into disuse among the Byzantine emperors, it was used as a title of legitimacy among the barbarian rulers of former Roman provinces, such as Visigothic Spain and the kings of the Ostrogothic Kingdom of Italy and the Kingdom of the Lombards.

From the fourth century AD onwards, the name is widespread among non-emperors as a mark of dignity. It is widespread in epigraphy from Germania. In Egypt, where the evidence is best, it was part of the full name of all Imperial officials, all provincial officials, the highest civic officials, and most soldiers. This usage appears shortly after Constantine gained control of the province in 324 AD. Between 287 and 326 AD, Egyptians had used Valerius (the nomen of Constantine&#x27;s predecessors) in a similar way. People not entitled to &quot;Flavius&quot; bore the nomen Aurelius or no nomen. Initially, people sometimes used the name Flavius alongside another nomen that they were entitled to (e.g. Julius, Aelius), but these other nomina died out over the fifth century. In the fourth century, the name was not inherited by children or wives of the &quot;Flavius&quot;, but from the fifth century higher-ranking holders sometimes passed the name to their descendants. After the Arab conquest of Egypt in 646, the use of &quot;Flavius&quot; was less consistent and after some time it died out.

In modern use, &quot;Flavius&quot; is a personal name, and widely used in romance languages, including Italian and Spanish &quot;Flavio&quot; (fem. &quot;Flavia&quot;), French &quot;Flavien&quot; (fem. &quot;Flavie&quot;), Portuguese &quot;Flávio&quot; (fem. &quot;Flávia&quot;), and Romanian &quot;Flavius&quot; or &quot;Flaviu&quot; (fem. &quot;Flavia&quot;).

==Praenomina==
The early Flavii used the praenomina &quot;Marcus, Quintus, Gaius&quot;, and &quot;Lucius&quot;. Of these, only &quot;Gaius&quot; and &quot;Lucius&quot; are known from the family of the Fimbriae. The name &quot;Gnaeus&quot; occurs once, but as the son of a freedman of the family, and thus does not seem to be representative of the gens. The Flavii Sabini appear to have restricted themselves to the praenomen &quot;Titus&quot; alone, and distinguished their sons by the use of different surnames, usually by giving the younger sons surnames derived from their maternal ancestors.

==Branches and cognomina==
The Flavii of the Republic used the cognomina &quot;Fimbria&quot;, &quot;Gallus&quot;, &quot;Lucanus&quot;, and &quot;Pusio&quot;. Only the Fimbriae, whose surname refers to a fringe or border, represented a distinct family. &quot;Gallus&quot; and &quot;Lucanus&quot; belong to a class of surnames derived from places of origin or association, referring to Gaul and Lucania, respectively, although &quot;Gallus&quot;, a very common surname, could also refer to a cockerel. &quot;Pusio&quot; was originally a nickname indicating a little boy, and would have been bestowed on someone small or youthful.

The Flavii Sabini, whose surname indicates Sabine ancestry, rose to prominence under the Empire. They were descended from Titus Flavius Petro, a soldier from Reate who fought under Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus. Within two generations they had attained such respectability that two of his grandsons held the consulship in consecutive years, AD 51 and 52; the younger of these marched to Rome at the head of an army in the year of the four emperors, AD 69, and claimed the imperial dignity as the emperor Vespasian. However, within less than thirty years, the family was largely destroyed through the workings of Vespasian&#x27;s son, the emperor Domitian. The Flavii Titiani may be descended from the Flavii Sabini through the consul Titus Flavius Clemens, a nephew of Vespasian; the first of this branch, Titus Flavius Titianus, who was governor of Egypt from AD 126 to 133, may have been his son.

A family of the Flavii bearing the surname &quot;Valens&quot; lived at Hatria, and from there migrated to Rome in imperial times, where two of them served as prefects of different cohorts.

==Members==
* Marcus Flavius, tribune of the plebs in BC 327 and 323.
* Gnaeus Flavius, the son of a freedman, he was secretary to Appius Claudius Caecus, and served as aedile in 304 BC.
* Flavius, or Flavius Lucanus, a Lucanian, who went over to Mago during the Second Punic War, and delivered the proconsul Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus, in return for the promise that the Lucanians should be free and retain their own constitution.
* Quintus Flavius, an augur who, according to Valerius Maximus, was accused by the aedile Gaius Valerius (perhaps the same who was curule aedile in BC 199). When fourteen tribes had already voted against Flavius, who again asserted his innocence, Valerius declared that he did not care whether the man was guilty or innocent, provided he secured his punishment; and the people, indignant at such conduct, acquitted Flavius.
* Quintus Flavius, of Tarquinii, murdered the slave Panurgus, who belonged to Gaius Fannius Chaerea, and who was to be trained as an actor by Quintus Roscius, the celebrated comedian.
* Lucius Flavius, an eques, who gave evidence against Verres in BC 70. He probably lived in Sicily, and was engaged in mercantile pursuits. He appears to be the same Lucius Flavius who is mentioned as &quot;procurator&quot; (that is, the agent or steward) of Gaius Matrinius in Sicily.
* Gaius Flavius, brother of Lucius, and likewise an eques, whom Cicero recommended in BC 46 to Manius Acilius, praetor of Sicily, as an intimate friend of Cicero&#x27;s late son-in-law, Gaius Calpurnius Piso Frugi.
* Gaius Flavius Pusio, is mentioned by Cicero as one of the equites who opposed the tribune Marcus Drusus.
* Lucius Flavius, praetor in BC 58, and a supporter of Pompeius. He was plebeian tribune in 60 BC and failed in passing a land reform programme for Pompey&#x27;s veterans. He was also a friend of both Cicero and Caesar, and may have been the same Flavius whom Caesar entrusted with one legion and the province of Sicily in BC 49.
* Gaius Flavius, an eques of Asta, a Roman colony in Spain. He and other equites, who had belonged to the party of Pompeius, went over to Caesar in BC 45. It is uncertain whether he is the same Gaius Flavius who is mentioned among the enemies of Octavian, and who was put to death in BC 40, after the taking of Perusia.
* Gaius Flavius, a friend of Brutus, whom he accompanied to Philippi in the capacity of &quot;praefectus fabrum&quot;. Flavius fell in the Battle of Philippi, and Brutus lamented over his death.
* Flavius Gallus, a military tribune serving under Marcus Antonius in his unfortunate campaign against the Parthians in BC 36. During Antonius&#x27; retreat, Gallus made an inconsiderate attack upon the enemy, for which he paid with his life.

===Flavii Fimbriae===
* Gaius Flavius Fimbria, the father of Gaius Flavius Fimbria, the consul of 104 BC.
* Gaius Flavius C. f. Fimbria, consul in 104 BC; acquitted of extortion, despite significant evidence. With other consulars, took up arms against the revolt of Saturninus in 100. A clever jurist and powerful orator, his reputation had faded by Cicero&#x27;s time, when his speeches were scarcely to be found.
* Gaius Flavius C. f. C. n. Fimbria, a violent partisan of Gaius Marius, at whose funeral he tried to kill Quintus Mucius Scaevola, the Pontifex Maximus. Sent to Asia in an expedition against Mithridates and Sulla, Fimbria led a mutiny against the consul Valerius Flaccus, whom he murdered, taking command of the army. With much savagery, he subdued much of Asia, but when his men went over to Sulla, he took his own life.
* Flavius C. f. C. n. Fimbria, brother of Gaius, was likewise in the service of the Marian party in the war against Sulla, 82 BC, and was legate to Gaius Norbanus. He and other officers of the party of Carbo were invited to a banquet by Publius Albinovanus, and then treacherously murdered.
* Lucius Flavius Fimbria, consul &quot;suffectus&quot; in AD 71, during the months of July and August.

===Flavii Sabini===

* Titus Flavius Petro, grandfather of the emperor Vespasian, was a native of the municipium of Reate, and served as a centurion in the army of Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus at the Battle of Pharsalus, 48 BC.
* Titus Flavius T. f. Sabinus, father of Vespasian, was one of the farmers of the tax of the quadragesima in Asia, which he collected with so much fairness that many cities erected statues to his honour with the inscription, . He afterwards carried on business as a money-lender among the Helvetii, and died in their country.
* Titus Flavius T. f. T. n. Sabinus, the elder brother of Vespasian, was consul in AD 52, and for most of Nero&#x27;s reign. The emperor Vitellius offered to surrender the empire into his hands until the arrival of Vespasian, but the soldiers of each refused this arrangement, and Sabinus was murdered by Vitellius&#x27; troops, despite the emperor&#x27;s attempts to save him.
* Titus Flavius T. f. T. n. Vespasianus, the emperor Vespasian, was consul in AD 51, and proconsul in Africa and Judaea under Nero. He became emperor in AD 69, on the death of Vitellius, and reigned until his death in 79.
* Flavia Domitilla, otherwise known as &quot;Domitilla the Elder&quot;, the wife of Vespasian.
* Titus Flavius (T. f. T. n.) Sabinus, consul in AD 69, was probably a nephew of the emperor Vespasian.

* Titus Flavius T. f. T. n. Sabinus, son of the consul of 52, and nephew of Vespasian, he was consul with his cousin, the emperor Domitian, in AD 82, but afterwards slain by the emperor on the pretext that the herald proclaiming his consulship had called him &quot;Imperator&quot; instead of &quot;consul&quot;.
* Titus Flavius T. f. T. n. Clemens, son of the consul of 52, and nephew of Vespasian, he was consul with his cousin, the emperor Domitian, in AD 95. Although the emperor had intended Clemens&#x27; sons to succeed him in the empire, and renamed them &quot;Vespasian&quot; and &quot;Domitian&quot;, he had his cousin put to death during his consulship, according to Cassius Dio on a charge of atheism, implying that he had become a Christian.
* Titus Flavius T. f. T. n. Vespasianus, the emperor Titus, reigned from AD 79 to 81.
* Titus Flavius T. f. T. n. Domitianus, the emperor Domitian, emperor from AD 81 to 96.

He was put to death by Septimius Severus in 197.

===Others===
* Flavius Scaevinus, a senator of dissolute life, took part in the conspiracy of Piso against Nero. It was through Milichus, the freedman of Scaevinus, that the conspiracy was discovered by Nero. Milichus was liberally rewarded by the emperor, and Scaevinus put to death.

He held the consulship in AD 146.
* Titus Flavius Clemens, also known as &quot;Clement of Alexandria&quot;, one of the early Church fathers, lived from the middle of the second century to the second decade of the third century. He may have been born at Athens. His relationship to the other Flavii, or to Titus Flavius Clemens, the consul of AD 95, who may have been a convert to Christianity, is unknown; Clement&#x27;s parents are thought to have been well-to-do pagans. Given the large number of persons who adopted the nomen &quot;Flavius&quot; during this period, his name could be coincidental.

<text>Indiana University East (IU East or IUE) is a public university in Richmond, Indiana, a regional campus of Indiana University that serves the eastern Indiana and western Ohio area. Established in 1971 by the Indiana University Board of Trustees, IU East enrolls over 4,000 students on its five-building, 174-acre campus and in online classes. IU East has 60 academic degree programs, offering bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degree programs and certificates in areas of Business and Economics, Education, Humanities and Social Sciences, Natural Science &amp; Mathematics, Informatics, General Studies, Nursing and Health Sciences, and Social Work.

==History==
Indiana University East grew out of an extension established at Earlham College that was operated cooperatively by Earlham and Indiana University. In 1967, the arrangement was expanded to include Purdue and Ball State Universities and the extension became the Eastern Indiana Center of Earlham College.

In 1969, Richmond citizens formed Eastern Indiana Community College, Inc., to raise funds for the construction of a new campus. After raising more than $1 million, members of the community college organization, with the consent of the four educational institutions involved in the center, asked Indiana University to establish a regional campus in Richmond and to assume responsibility for the operation.

The Indiana General Assembly approved this plan, and on July 1, 1971, the Eastern Indiana Center of Earlham College became Indiana University East, the sixth campus in the Indiana University regional system. On October 3, 1972, ground was broken at the new campus site north of Richmond. The first building, an all-purpose academic facility, was completed in late 1974 and dedicated February 23, 1975. IU East earned its first accreditation in 1975.

The Indiana University East campus included 225 acres (0.911 km2) of land, purchased with community donations, on the northern edge of Richmond, Indiana. Of those , are for IU East and 51 acres (0.21 km2) are for other non-IU East post-secondary educational uses, such as Ivy Tech Community College.

Whitewater Hall opened in 1976 as the first of five buildings. This was followed by Hayes Hall in 1992, Middlefork Hall in 1995 (renamed Tom Raper Hall in 2009), Springwood Hall in 1999 and the Student Events and Activities Center in 2016.

Additionally, the IU East Henry County Danielson Learning Center in New Castle, Indiana was dedicated in May 1999 to serve the citizens of Henry County, Indiana. IU East offers degree programs off-campus at the Ivy Tech Community College in Lawrenceburg Riverfront Campus.

Recent chancellors include David Fulton, Nassar Paydar, Larry Richards (interim), Kathryn Girten, and Dennis Rome (current).

Since awarding its first bachelor&#x27;s degrees in 1977, IU East has expanded its academic portfolio to include 60 bachelor&#x27;s degree options and selected master&#x27;s degrees. In 2017, IU East conferred its 10,000th degree.

<doc id="1344803" wikidata="Q6486375" url="?curid=1344803" title="Langney">
<text>Langney is a distinct part of Eastbourne, East Sussex and is on the eastern side of the popular seaside resort. The original village and priory have now been amalgamated with the main town of Eastbourne, and Langney was identified as a single self-contained polling ward within the borough of Eastbourne until 2002.

==Etymology==
The etymology of Langney is from the Anglo-Saxon root for Long (lang) and Island (ey). Other local place names contain the suffix &#x27;ey&#x27; with this historic meaning because the sea level was rather higher in the pre-Conquest period and areas of higher land stood out as &#x27;islands&#x27; or rather &#x27;eys&#x27;. Pevensey shares the same etymology. Langney proper - the &#x27;Long Island&#x27; - thus refers to the higher part i.e. where the shopping centre now is.

==Langney Priory==
Langney contains the Grade II Listed Langney Priory. The oldest part of this building dates to the twelfth century. It was built by Cluniac monks from the very much larger Priory of St Pancras at Lewes. This lesser building at Langney was thus a monastic of the senior house. Langney Priory which had been scheduled for demolition in the 1950s was as of 2019 undergoing redevelopment.

==Local governance==
Since the boundary changes of 2002 the Langney village became part of St. Anthony&#x27;s ward, Langney point became part of Sovereign ward and the remaining northern part of Langney became the new Langney ward. the Langney ward was held by the Liberal Democrats and represented by Cllrs Harun Miah, Alan Shuttleworth and Troy Tester at Eastbourne Borough Council and Cllr Alan Shuttleworth at East Sussex County Council.

==Community==
Langney has grown in recent years (especially since 1970) and is contiguous to Langney Point, which mainly comprises newer properties built on shingle. These properties extend down to the English Channel and the original Eastbourne &quot;Promenade&quot; has been extended eastwards to Langney Point. North of old Langney Village is naturally known as &quot;North Langney&quot; which, once again, consists mainly of newer housing, but there are a few older properties which have seen a considerable change to the local landscape from farmland to suburbia.

Langney also has a popular shopping centre (built in 1973)—including small branches of Tesco and Boots—and has nine schools within its boundaries, the Bishop Bell Church Of England School (Now called St Catherine&#x27;s), the Causeway School ( Now known as The Turing School ) , Langney Primary School, Tollgate Community Junior School, West Rise Community Infant School, West Rise Junior School, Shinewater Primary School, the Haven Voluntary Aided C E Methodist Primary School and Hazel Court Special School.
Langney is mostly made up of housing estate, the main housing estates in Langney are Langney Estate, Kingsmere &amp; Kings Park Estate, Painters Estate, the Birds Estate and Shinewater Estate.

==Sport==
Langney Sports Club provides a centre for archery, snooker and darts as well as two bars. Adjacent to Langney Sports Club is the home ground of Eastbourne Borough, the largest football team in the town of Eastbourne. They play in the National League South.

<doc id="1344806" wikidata="Q6924922" url="?curid=1344806" title="Mountain Dell Dam">
<text>The Mountain Dell Dam provides a water equalizing and storage reservoir for Salt Lake City, Utah located east of the city in northeastern Salt Lake County, near Interstate 80 in Parley&#x27;s Canyon.

Designed by John S. Eastwood, and constructed between 1914 and 1925, the dam is an example of a mixed buttress dam and multiple arch dam construction. At the time the plans were made, the city was in need of a sufficient supply of water, especially during late summer and the middle of winter.

With the completion of the dam, the city had an available storage capacity of , and distributing or equalizing capacity of compared to previously.

The dam was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

Mountain Dell Dam is listed as in &quot;poor&quot; condition and is under repair.

== Design ==

Plans were made for three types of dam:
* Arched solid dam, gravity type
* Reinforced concrete dam of the Ambursen type
* Multiple arch reinforced concrete dam of the Eastwood design

After consideration, the multiple arch type was chosen. One of the factors influencing this decision was the bedrock condition at the site. The bedrock is a calcareous shale not entirely watertight and of a nature to decompose somewhat under exposure to air and water. The advantages of the multiple arch type in this connection were considered to be the practical elimination of upward pressure, the practical impossibility of overturning or sliding on its base and the ready facilities for internal inspection of the dam at any time.

== Construction ==

The dam was built in two stages, the first stage completed in 1917 with a height of above the foundation and the second stage, completed 1925, added to the height of the dam.

The cost of the structure was considerably increased because of the necessity of going below ground level in the bottom of the canyon to secure the bedrock foundation. The spillway level is below the top of the dam, so that the maximum depth of the reservoir is to the crest of the spillway.

The dam as planned and as constructed consists of 11 buttresses and 11 arches in the first stage and an additional 5 buttresses and 5 arches in the second stage. The maximum base width of the dam is from the face of the arch to the downstream end of the buttresses. The maximum thickness of the buttresses is . The maximum thickness of the arch rings is . The thickness at the present top of the dam is . The arch rings are 120 degree arcs of circles. The spacing between buttress centers is . The two sets of outlet gates each consist of two pipes with a suitable grating entrance, and with a butterfly and a double-disc gate valve on each pipe.

The total quantity of concrete in the dam is 8,271 cubic yards (6,323 m3). The total cost of the dam was $90,000. The storage capacity at the present height is slightly over . The general design and supervision was handled under the direction of Sylvester Q. Cannon, City Engineer of Salt Lake City and John S. Eastwood acting as consulting engineer. Parrott Bros. Co. were the contractors.

==Condition==
As of 2019 Mountain Dell Dam was listed as being in &quot;poor&quot; condition, with increased hazard due to its proximity to highways and parks, with risk to life in the event of failure. A liner is being installed on the upstream face to control water intrusion that creates freeze/thaw damage. Until the deterioration is arrested, the reservoir may only be half full during the winter.

<text>Flavia is a hot beverage system, released on March 8th 2005. The system prepares single servings of coffee, tea, and hot chocolate drinks. The brand was owned by Mars Drinks, a division of Mars, Incorporated until October 1, 2018, when Lavazza purchased Mars’s coffee units.

==Products==
FLAVIA claims its patented technology brews drinks in a single-serve &quot;Fresh Pack,&quot; which means that the pack is the actual brewing chamber. The drink pours directly from the packet into the cup rather than through a common channel. Used packs are collected in a tray that is emptied periodically when prompted.

The Fresh Packs are foil-sealed, protecting the ground coffees and teas from oxygen and moisture. FLAVIA markets several different machines, such as large coin-operated machines and small portable machines designed for home use.

==History==
Key events in the history of the product line include:

*1982 The first Filterpack was manufactured in Basingstoke, UK
*1984 FLAVIA launched its first brewer
*1992 Launch in Japan
*1996 Launch in US

<doc id="1344822" wikidata="Q5060713" url="?curid=1344822" title="Central District, Seattle">
<text>The Central Area (commonly called the Central District or The CD) is a mostly residential neighborhood in Seattle located east of downtown and First Hill (12th Avenue and Rainier Avenue); west of Madrona, Leschi and Mt. Baker; south of Capitol Hill, and north of Rainier Valley. Historically, the Central District has been one of Seattle&#x27;s most racially and ethnically diverse neighborhoods, and was once the center of Seattle&#x27;s black community and a major hub of African-American businesses.

==History and demographics==
The culture and demographics of the Central District have changed repeatedly throughout many years. In 1882, William Grose purchased 12 acres of land in what was known as Madison Valley from Henry Yesler. Grose was already an established businessman in Seattle at the time, and his development of the area helped to establish the Central District as an African-American community. He sold parcels of the land to other Black families while running his own modest farm on the land, on which he grew produce and raised animals for use in his hotel downtown. The area was thickly wooded at the time and slowly developed by Grose and others.

In 1889 the Madison Street Cable Car began service up the hill into the area, and more Black families moved in. Some have described a subsequent White flight that followed the migration of more Black people to the area.

In 1927, white homeowners began a concerted effort to redline the area. Unlike other redlining efforts in the United States, the neighborhood was already established as a home to African-American, Jewish, and Asian families because of the distribution of land by Grose. So this area was more boxed in so that certain people would not be able to buy or rent land elsewhere.

In the early 20th century, the Central District also established itself as a largely Jewish neighborhood. Jewish residents built Temple De Hirsch on Union Street in 1907; Temple De Hirsch Sinai on the opposite corner of the same block is a successor to that congregation; the original Temple De Hirsch is largely demolished, though some fragments remain. Other former synagogues in the neighborhood are the former Sephardic Bikur Holim synagogue (now Tolliver Temple), Herzl Congregation synagogue (later Odessa Brown Clinic, as of 2023 home to two private schools), and Chevra Bikur Cholim (now Langston Hughes Performing Arts Center).

A few decades later, the Central District became a home to Japanese-Americans in Seattle. The blocks between 14th and 18th Avenues and Yesler Way and Jackson Street still retain a strong Japanese presence—Faith Bible Church, the Buddhist Church, Seattle Koyasan Church, Konko, Wisteria Park, Japanese Congregational Church, Keiro Nursing Home, and the Kawabe Memorial House. During World War II, presidential Executive Order 9066 made possible the removal of American citizens of Japanese descent from the West Coast. All Japanese residents were immediately taken out of their homes and sent to internment camps.

This and many race-restricted covenants to the north and south paved the way for more African Americans to find a new home in the Central District as part of the Second Great Migration to the city in search of employment opportunities in the munitions plants during the war as well as taking advantage of the post-war economic expansion. By the 1970s, Central District was a largely an African-American neighborhood and the center of the civil rights movement in Seattle. In 1970, Black people made up nearly 80 percent of the neighborhood&#x27;s population. However, the neighborhood declined with increased rates of poverty and crime over the following two decades.

In the early 21st century, several demographic trends are changing the population of the Central District again. Low-income segments of the population are moving southward toward the Rainier Valley, while more affluent residents, who might otherwise have purchased homes on Capitol Hill, Madrona, Leschi, or Mt. Baker are moving into the Central District as real estate and rental property become more expensive in the former neighborhoods and commuting times and costs make suburban areas less attractive.

Due to this market pressure, housing in the Central District is mixed, with some homes on the verge of condemnation, and others having recently undergone extensive renovation. Many condemned houses are being replaced by multi-unit townhouses and condominiums. Easy access to Interstate 5, Interstate 90, and Downtown, as well as ample street parking, also make the Central District an attractive and convenient place to live.

Despite the demographic shifts since the early 1970s, many locals still think of the Central District as a predominantly African-American area. One reason for this is that despite the decline in the African-American population, there is black history in the neighborhood. It is home to the Northwest African American Museum, The Liberty Bank Building, the historic site of the first black-owned bank in Seattle, Medgar Evers Pool, and the Second Headquarters of the Seattle Black Panther Party and The People&#x27;s Wall. In 2022, the William Grose Center for Cultural Innovation and Enterprise was opened by a non-profit organization, Africatown Community Land Trust. The center is built in the repurposed Fire Station 6, home to Seattle&#x27;s first Black firefighters, building that had long sat vacant until the city of Seattle leased the building to Africatown Community Land Trust for 99 years in 2020.

During the early 1960s, the neighborhood was a hotbed for the Seattle civil rights movement. In 1963, civil rights protesters took to the streets and protested against racial discrimination. Later, they participated in a sit-in in downtown Seattle. At the same time, the Black Panther Party used the neighborhood as a staging area for their movement.

As of 2010 the total population of the Central Area is 29,868 with a population that is 59.6% White or Caucasian, 21.4% Black or African-American, 9.1% Asian, 0.6% Native American, 0.3% Pacific Islander, 3.2% from other races and 6.1% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race consisted of 7.3% of the population.

==Transportation==

The Central District&#x27;s main thoroughfares includes its east boundary along Martin Luther King Jr. Way (&quot;MLK&quot;), its west boundaries along 12th Avenue and Rainier Avenue, and its &#x27;main street&#x27; 23rd Avenue (north and southbound). Major east–west streets in the neighborhood include E. Union, E. Cherry, E. Jefferson, E. Yesler Way, and S. Jackson.

===Public transit===

King County Metro operates several bus routes in the Central District that connect the neighborhood to Downtown Seattle, Capitol Hill, Mount Baker, and the University District. The RapidRide G Line, a limited-stop bus rapid transit route, launched in September 2024 and serves the north end of the neighborhood on Madison Street. The Central District&#x27;s primary north–south bus corridor, Route 48 on 23rd Avenue, is planned to be converted into a electric trolleybus route by 2026 following the completion of electrical wiring over the street. It is also a candidate for future conversion into a RapidRide route by 2050.

The 2 Line, a Link light rail line operated by Sound Transit, is planned to extend into Seattle in late 2025 with a station at Judkins Park in the southern Central District. The station is located within the median of Interstate 90 between Rainier Avenue to the west and 23rd Avenue to the east.

== Public parks and greenspaces ==

The Central District is home to at least 18 public parks, and community green spaces. Notable parks include: T.T. Minor Playground, Firehouse Mini Park, Garfield Playfield, Pratt Park, Dr. Blanche Lavizzo Park, Judkins Park and Playfield, Judkins Skatepark, Jimi Hendrix Park, William Grose Park, and Sam Smith Park. The Central District is home to 4 P-Patch Community Gardens: Immaculate P-Patch at E Columbia Street and 18th Avenue, Squire Park at 14th Avenue and E Fir Street, Climbing Water at 800 Hiawatha Pl S, and Judkins at 24th Avenue S and S Norman Street.

<text>Eifelland was a German Formula One team, named after its owner Günther Hennerici&#x27;s caravan manufacturing company. The name Eifelland was chosen after the Eifel mountains where Hennerici was born, which are located close to the Nürburgring.

==History==
Günther&#x27;s twin brother, Heinz Hennerici, was a World War II tank commander who lost his left arm in combat. The accident didn&#x27;t prevent him from becoming a rather successful touring car racing driver, eventually competing in the Nürburgring 24 Hours. The Hennerici brothers were also instrumental in the establishment of the Automobil-Club Mayen. In 1970 Günther married , one of the few female Formula 2 and Sports car drivers around at the time. 

In 1971 Günther Hennerici decided to expand his activities to motor racing and founded his own team, Eifelland. Initially the team competed mostly in Formula Three, with drivers such as Willi Deutsch, Gerd Koppenhauser, Erwin Derichs, Hans Hargarten and Werner herself. In 1972 he chose to graduate to Formula One and field one single car with Rolf Stommelen at the wheel. The car was based on a March 721 Formula One car, redesigned by German designer Luigi Colani in his typical rounded aerodynamic style, and presented some innovative features. An air intake in front of the driver would guide the air around the cockpit to the engine, and one single rear view mirror was mounted in front of the driver. Although reasonably reliable, the car suffered from overheating and scarce downforce. Stomelen&#x27;s best results were two top-ten finishes at the 1972 Monaco Grand Prix and the 1972 British Grand Prix, and at the end of the 1972 Formula One season the team decided to focus exclusively on Formula Three. After a couple of unsuccessful seasons, in 1974 Hennerici sold the team and his caravan company and retired.

Heinz&#x27;s grandson, Marc Hennerici, is also a racing driver. He won the 2005 World Touring Car Championship&#x27;s Independents Trophy.

<doc id="1344827" wikidata="Q14614313" url="?curid=1344827" title="Lustration">
<text>Lustration in Central and Eastern Europe is the official public procedure of scrutinizing a public official or a candidate for public office in terms of their history as a witting confidential collaborator (informant) of relevant former communist secret police, an activity widely condemned by the public opinion of those states as morally corrupt due to its essential role in suppressing political opposition and enabling persecution of dissidents. Surfacing of evidence for such a past activity typically inflicts severe damage to the reputation of the person concerned. It should not be confused with decommunization, which is the process of barring former communist regular officials from public offices as well as eliminating communist symbols.

The principle of non-retroactivity means that a past role of a confidential collaborator (informant) is alone as such inadmissible from the beginning for criminal prosecution or conviction, thus, lustration allows at least to bring such past collaborators to moral responsibility by making the public opinion aware of the established outcomes through their free dissemination. Another motivation was the fear that undisclosed past confidential collaboration could be used to blackmail public officials by foreign intelligence services of other former Warsaw Pact allies, in particular Russia.

Depending on jurisdiction, either every positive result or only the one obtained regarding a person who falsely declared otherwise, may trigger consequences varying greatly among jurisdictions, ranging from mere infamy to purging the person from office and a 10-year exclusion from holding public offices. Various forms of lustration were employed in post-communist Europe.

== Etymology ==

Lustration in general is the process of making something clear or transparent, usually by means of a offering. The term is taken from the ancient Roman lustratio purification rituals.

== Policies and laws ==
After the fall of the various European Communist governments with the Revolutions of 1989 between 1989 and 1992, government-sanctioned policies of &quot;mass disqualification of those associated with the abuses under the prior regime&quot; were initiated as part of the wider decommunization campaigns.

Lustration in turn targets former confidential informants of the communist secret police who remain in or apply for political positions or even civil service positions, rather than former communist regular officials. In some countries, however, lustration laws did not lead to indiscriminate exclusion and disqualification, taking into account that people were often blackmailed to become informants or coerced into providing information without realising its true recipient. Lustration law in Hungary (1994–2003) was based on the exposure of compromised state officials, while lustration law in Poland (1999–2005) depended on confession. Lustration law &quot;is a special public employment law that regulates the process of examining whether a person holding certain higher public positions collaborated confidentially with the repressive apparatus of the communist regime.&quot; The &quot;special&quot; nature of lustration law refers to its transitional character. As of 1996, various lustration laws of varying scope were implemented in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Macedonia, Albania, Bulgaria, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Germany, Poland, and Romania. As of 2019, lustration laws had not been passed in Belarus, nor in former Yugoslavia or the former Soviet Central Asian Republics (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan).

=== Results ===
Lustration can serve as a form of punishment by anti-communist politicians who were dissidents under a Communist-led government. Lustration laws are usually passed right before elections, and become tightened when right-wing governments are in power, and loosened while social-democratic parties are in power. It is claimed that lustration systems based on dismissal or confession might be able to increase trust in government, while those based on confession might be able to promote social reconciliation.

There are, however, some paradoxal side effects of the process. For example, in spite of the fact that some informants were coerced or blackmailed into collaboration and may thus be also considered victims themselves, or in some cases despite terminating later the collaboration in favor of genuine dissident activity, the public attention and condemnation has focused primarily on them rather than on the communist government officials or secret police officers. Moreover, if the past collaboration is contested in a court, the verdict depends to some extent on testimonies of former communist secret police officers who engaged with the alleged informant, thus making those orchestrating the repressions &quot;de facto&quot; the ones deciding the case.

== Examples ==
=== In Czechoslovakia and the Czech Republic ===
Unlike many neighbouring states, the new government in the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic did not adjudicate under court trials, but instead took a non-judicial approach to ensure changes would be implemented.

According to a law passed on 4 October 1991, all employees of the StB, the Communist-era secret police, were blacklisted from designated public offices, including the upper levels of the civil service, the judiciary, procuracy, Security Information Service (BIS), army positions, management of state owned enterprises, the central bank, the railways, senior academic positions and the public electronic media. This law remained in place in the Czech Republic after the dissolution of Czechoslovakia, and was extended indefinitely.

The lustration laws in Czechoslovakia and the Czech Republic were not intended to serve as justice, but to ensure that events such as the Communist coup of February 1948 did not happen again.

=== In Poland ===

The first lustration bill was passed by the Polish Parliament in 1992, but it was declared unconstitutional by the Constitutional Tribunal of the Republic of Poland. Several other projects were then submitted and reviewed by a dedicated commission, resulting in a new lustration law passed in 1996. From 1997 to 2007 lustration was dealt with by the office of the Public Interest Ombudsperson (), who analyzed lustration declarations and could initiate further proceedings. According to a new law which came into effect on 15 March 2007, lustration in Poland is now administered by the Institute of National Remembrance (; IPN).

=== In Ukraine ===

In Ukraine, lustration refers mainly to the removal from public office of civil servants who worked under Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych. They may be excluded for five to ten years.

<doc id="1344834" wikidata="Q783474" url="?curid=1344834" title="Punch the Clock">
<text>Punch the Clock is the eighth studio album by the English singer-songwriter Elvis Costello, and his seventh with the Attractions—keyboardist Steve Nieve, bassist Bruce Thomas and drummer Pete Thomas (no relation). It was released on 5 August 1983 through F-Beat Records in the United Kingdom and Columbia Records in the United States. Produced by Clive Langer and Alan Winstanley, the album was Costello&#x27;s attempt at making a commercial record following years of dwindling commercial success. It was recorded at London&#x27;s AIR Studios in early 1983 and features contributions from the TKO Horns and Afrodiziak.

Featuring genres such as new wave, pop rock, R&amp;B and soul, commentators have compared the album&#x27;s sound to Costello&#x27;s previous records &quot;Armed Forces&quot; (1979) and &quot;Get Happy!!&quot; (1980). The songs are filled with catchy choruses and lyrics covering relationships and political themes. The record contains Costello&#x27;s version of &quot;Shipbuilding&quot;, co-written with Langer and featuring a trumpet solo by Chet Baker. The album takes its title from a lyric in &quot;The Greatest Thing&quot; and the cover artwork was designed by Phil Smee.

Extensively promoted through live performances, &quot;Punch the Clock&quot; yielded Costello&#x27;s first US Top 40 hit, &quot;Everyday I Write the Book&quot;. &quot;Pills and Soap&quot; was released as a single under a pseudonym and through Costello&#x27;s own IMP label, which reached number 16 in the UK. The album was his best-selling since &quot;Get Happy!!&quot;, reaching number three in the UK and number 24 in the US, eventually certified gold in both countries. Despite its success, Costello later expressed disdain for the record, finding its sound dated.

The album received mixed-to-positive reviews from music critics on release and in later decades. Many highlighted individual tracks, particularly &quot;Shipbuilding&quot; and &quot;Pills and Soap&quot;, but felt it was below the standards set by his previous works. Nevertheless, &quot;NME&quot; ranked &quot;Punch the Clock&quot; the best album of 1983 and, thirty years later, number 345 in their list of &quot;the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;. It has been reissued multiple times with bonus tracks.

==Background==
Elvis Costello released his seventh studio album &quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot; in July 1982. Despite receiving critical acclaim, its modest commercial performance forced the artist to reevaluate his musical style. His American label, Columbia Records, remained eager for another success akin to 1979&#x27;s &quot;Armed Forces&quot; and showed little interest in his less-commercial works. He had garnered a loyal fanbase—largely through his own merits—but Costello knew his heavily artistic and challenging material was doing him more harm than good, so he decided to change direction with his next record. Having already co-written the song &quot;Shipbuilding&quot; with producer Clive Langer for musician Robert Wyatt, whose original version charted at number 36 in the UK in May 1983, Costello chose Langer and his production partner Alan Winstanley to produce his next album. Langer and Winstanley were one of the most popular production teams in Britain at the time, having recently had several hit singles with groups such as Madness, Dexys Midnight Runners and the Teardrop Explodes.

Costello and his backing band the Attractions—keyboardist Steve Nieve, bassist Bruce Thomas and drummer Pete Thomas (no relation)—toured Britain from mid-September to early-October 1982, road-testing several new songs that would appear on his next album, including his own interpretation of &quot;Shipbuilding&quot; and &quot;Everyday I Write the Book&quot;, which was written quickly one night in September and performed the following evening. He continued writing new material for the rest of the year, debuting working versions of &quot;Mouth Almighty&quot;, &quot;Everyday I Write the Book&quot;, &quot;The Comedians&quot;, &quot;Pills and Soap&quot; and &quot;The World and His Wife&quot; during three Christmas concerts in Liverpool and London in late December. These performances featured new arrangements of songs with a horn section.

==Recording==
Rehearsals for Costello&#x27;s eighth studio LP began in early 1983. His goal was to tailor the album toward hit singles and less on critical acclaim, stating at the time: &quot;Counting [1981&#x27;s] &quot;Trust&quot;, we&#x27;d gone three records without any substantial hit apart from &#x27;Good Year for the Roses&#x27;. You have to consider if you allow that contact with the mainstream audience to be served for too long, you may lose the freedom to do what you want to do.&quot; The sessions commenced on 27 January 1983 at AIR Studios in London, the same studio used for &quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot;.
Unlike the more relaxed approach of &quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot; producer Geoff Emerick, Langer and Winstanley inserted themselves into the creative process, structuring the songs intently and left little room for improvisation; the former wanted the band to play their parts the same way over and over again. Langer commented: &quot;We don&#x27;t have any morals when it comes to studio craft. We always mix in sections, then stick it together afterwards.&quot; Discussing the duo&#x27;s process in an interview with &quot;Record Collector&quot; in 1995, Costello said that &quot;in the past, we&#x27;d never conformed to any great production design.[...] This was the first time we&#x27;d taken a formal approach, and to some extent it really worked.&quot;

With Langer&#x27;s influence, Costello wrote &quot;more rhythmic songs&quot; than he was used to. Having written the majority of &quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot; on piano, the producer instructed him to work on guitar to create &quot;more lively material&quot;, arguing that he had only become known for &quot;the most cynical and disillusioned songs&quot; that pervaded &quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot;. This process yielded a pair of &quot;proud and wishful songs&quot; on &quot;Love and Marriage&quot;: &quot;The Greatest Thing&quot; and &quot;Let Them All Talk&quot;, and a couple about the &quot;Ugly Truth&quot;: &quot;Mouth Almighty&quot; and &quot;Charm School&quot;. Langer felt the singer could write &quot;incredible pop music&quot;, later reflecting: &quot;I think he accepted that that&#x27;s what we did as producer: [have] hits. He always reacts against what he&#x27;s done before, so we went for it. We tried to get singles.&quot;
Other than the Attractions, the sessions employed several outside musicians who helped shape the album&#x27;s sound. The singers Caron Wheeler and Claudia Fontaine, known as Afrodiziak, contributed backing vocals to several songs, improvising all their parts. The same horn section from the Christmas shows, now dubbed the TKO Horns, were also brought in. Consisting of Big Jim Paterson on trombone, Jeff Blythe on alto saxophone and Paul Speare on tenor saxophone, the horns utilised the sound they had fashioned for their work in Dexys Midnight Runners. To not mimic the sound entirely, Costello added the trumpeter Dave Plews to the horns; the latter&#x27;s prior commitments as a member of Eurythmics&#x27; touring band led to his substitution on &quot;The World and His Wife&quot; by Stuart Robson. String arrangements were conducted by David Bedford, Morris Pert contributed percussion, while Chet Baker played a trumpet solo on &quot;Shipbuilding&quot;. Although Langer felt the band enjoyed playing with other musicians in the studio, not all of them were convinced. Bruce Thomas later stated: &quot;Those trendy production values. Everything gated together, very bright and shiny. It wasn&#x27;t our thing, but it worked on a couple of tracks.&quot;

In later decades, Langer asserted that the production was a mutually creative process: &quot;At certain times I would have control, other times I&#x27;d just let him do it, but if he really didn&#x27;t like something it wouldn&#x27;t go on, it was as simple as that.&quot; Nevertheless, Costello felt that he lost control of the studio and was difficult on the Attractions as a result, saying, &quot;it&#x27;s the only time I&#x27;ve given myself over to the production sound, rather than working in collaboration with the producer.&quot; The artist wanted the outtakes &quot;Heathen Town&quot; and &quot;Flirting Kind&quot; on the finished album, but kept &quot;Love Went Mad&quot; at Langer&#x27;s insistence; he stated in the album&#x27;s 1995 reissue liner notes that he devised a scheme to replace &quot;Love Went Mad&quot; with &quot;Heathen Town&quot; after the initial vinyl pressing. The album was mixed outside of London at Genetic Studios in Streatley, Berkshire.

==Music and lyrics==

A more rock-oriented effort than &quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot;, the author Graeme Thomson described &quot;Punch the Clock&quot; as an attempt &quot;to be a slicker, more calculated take on the pop-soul sound&quot;. Characterised by critics as new wave, pop rock, soul, and R&amp;B, the author Mick St. Michael opined that the LP showed the widest variety of musical styles since &quot;Trust&quot;. Critics drew comparisons to both &quot;Armed Forces&quot; and 1980&#x27;s &quot;Get Happy!!&quot; In &quot;NME&quot;, Graham Lock identified musical references from more widely-known acts such as the Beatles to more obscure acts such as Lewis Furey. In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Stephen Holden wrote that &quot;Punch&quot; embraces genres from 1960s soul, late Beatles psychedelia and cool jazz, &quot;compacting and juxtaposing these allusions with a dazzling sleight of hand&quot;. AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine found Langer and Winstanley&#x27;s production gives the album a &quot;slick, glossy surface&quot;.

According to the author James E. Perone, the songs are filled with catchy choruses and &quot;easy, safe wordplay&quot;. He also believed the lack of uniquely British references made &quot;Punch the Clock&quot; more accessible to American audiences compared to Costello&#x27;s prior works. Lock wrote that the lyrics contain bouts of black humour are and presented with &quot;calmness and compassion&quot; that makes them more &quot;chilling&quot;; the biographer Brian Hinton felt they amounted to &quot;a terrifying world picture&quot;. He wrote:

The biographer David Gouldstone found &quot;Punch the Clock&quot; to be Costello&#x27;s &quot;most sustained and powerful political statement since &quot;Armed Forces&quot;&quot;, saying that political tracks such as &quot;Shipbuilding&quot;, &quot;The Invisible Man&quot;, &quot;King of Thieves&quot; and &quot;Pills and Soap&quot;, and others such as &quot;Charm School&quot; all offer a brief glimpse at &quot;the workings of the world at large&quot;. Hinton also felt that some songs present commentaries on Thatcherism and Reaganomics, wherein humanity is &quot;reduced to an economic transaction&quot;.

===Side one===
The album&#x27;s opener, &quot;Let Them All Talk&quot;, evokes 1960s Motown through the use of brass instrumentation. In the lyrics, which serve as a reminder that time is lost as it passes, the narrator has lost his girlfriend and all hope for the future. The theme that &quot;talk&quot; is &quot;cheap and meaningless&quot; is resonated by the horns. Hinton argues that the &quot;fa-fa-fa&quot; section&#x27;s echo of Talking Heads&#x27; &quot;Psycho Killer&quot; (1977) foreshadows the rest of the album&#x27;s impulse to inflict violence. &quot;Everyday I Write the Book&quot; has a retro feel in its lyrics and R&amp;B musical style. AllMusic&#x27;s Mark Deming summarised: &quot;Both lyrically and melodically, the song suggested an updated variant on classic &#x27;60s soul, with the influence of Smokey Robinson peeking through Costello&#x27;s extended literary metaphor in yet another look at the complexities of romance.&quot; Through heavy wordplay, the song concerns the breakdown of a relationship but the author turns to his pen and paper as a way to envision a better connection; he is already working on a sequel in which he wins her back. With its relaxed vocal, the song&#x27;s lack of a happy ending is juxtaposed with a reflective and humorous tone. Deming said its theme is that &quot;love doesn&#x27;t last, but it&#x27;s not bad for as long as it chooses to stick around&quot;.

The album takes its title from a line in &quot;The Greatest Thing&quot;. With lyrics describing love as a type of fantasy in a unique language, Costello uses the phrase &quot;punching the clock&quot; for the narrator as an expression of starting his work shift or stopping the passage of time in order to find a new lover who will &quot;take his breath away&quot; following a failed marriage. Nevertheless, the song clears the notion that not all marriages turn out this way, resulting in an endless cycle of &quot;punching the clock&quot;. The song&#x27;s music is uplifting; Perone deems its arrangement resembles Men at Work and remarks that it is closest in style to the new wave pop sound of the day. &quot;The Element Within Her&quot; provides a look at human relationships that idolises the woman. With Beatle-like harmonies, the song&#x27;s title is, in Hinton&#x27;s words, &quot;a weird sexual pun on [the narrator&#x27;s] girlfriend&#x27;s electric heater: the man is a frigid partner here&quot;. Perone opines that Costello&#x27;s playing of both acoustic and electric guitar shows off his skills as an instrumentalist. In &quot;Love Went Mad&quot;, the woman fails to respond to the man, so the home is reduced to a battleground and the man is, in Hinton&#x27;s words, &quot;reduced in scale to a &#x27;big cheese in the workhouse. Gouldstone says that the chorus is &quot;from an anguished unrequited love song&quot; while the verses come &quot;from a song of denunciation&quot;. St. Michael opines that the song&#x27;s vocal quote of &quot;Armed Forces&quot;″ &quot;Accidents Will Happen&quot; serves as an acknowledgement of Costello&#x27;s past and openness for the future with a new musical direction.
Described by Perone as the artist&#x27;s &quot;most overtly antiviolence, antiwar and anti-Thatcher statement to date&quot;, &quot;Shipbuilding&quot; is a heavy critique of the Falklands War. Sung from the perspective of an unemployed shipyard worker at the war&#x27;s start, Costello&#x27;s lyrics represent a swarm of conflicting emotions: the building of ships brings revenue to the coastal town, but their use brings devastation and death to the young men constructing them. Perone summarises the song as questioning the &quot;balance between monetary gain that comes from the military-industrial complex—in this case the builders of warships—and the loss of life that results from the complex&#x27;s products.&quot; Hinton argues its message is &quot;as direct as an arrow straight through the heart&quot;. Additionally, Gouldstone remarks that the artist&#x27;s sombre response to a political event represents a stark contrast his angry responses displayed on &quot;Armed Forces&quot;. Compared to Wyatt&#x27;s original, Costello&#x27;s vocal performance is sadder and more accepting. Musically, &quot;Shipbuilding&quot; demonstrates Costello&#x27;s knowledge of jazz, particularly with Baker&#x27;s trumpet solo, who Hinton argues &quot;brings out the haunting tones of an instrument which usually brags and blusters&quot;. AllMusic&#x27;s Stewart Mason describes it as one of Costello&#x27;s finest ballad performances.

===Side two===
Breaking the evocative mood of &quot;Shipbuilding&quot; is side two opener &quot;T.K.O. (Boxing Day)&quot;, a fast-paced R&amp;B song driven by the TKO Horns, who influenced its title. The lyrics concern the ironic comparison of the double-meaning of &quot;Boxing Day&quot;: the British day after Christmas and a prize fight. While Gouldstone refers to it as &quot;a wife beater&#x27;s manifesto&quot;, Hinton disagrees with this assessment, stating that the non-celebratory song concerns bullying rather than violence, both in the workplace and bedroom, which is reiterated by Costello&#x27;s &quot;distasteful&quot; vocal performance. The music and lyrics of &quot;Charm School&quot; frequently refer to post-World War II popular culture and history. Described by Perone as one of the album&#x27;s &quot;most evocative&quot; pieces, Nieve&#x27;s keyboard quotes &quot;Theme from &quot;Summer of &#x27;42&quot;&quot;. The upbeat music clashes with nasty lyrics. Similar to &quot;Trust&quot; &quot;Clubland&quot;, the setting is in a nightclub, depicting the breakdown of a marriage. According to Gouldstone, its main theme is &quot;the difficulty of living a happy life&quot;, expressed through the description of a disappointing relationship.

&quot;The Invisible Man&quot; refers to H. G. Wells&#x27; 1897 novel of the same name and its 1933 film adaptation. Assembled from three earlier tracks, the song deals with, in Gouldstone&#x27;s words, the &quot;dehumanisation of modern life&quot;. In the song, the main character escapes the reality of daily life by watching films; he is the &quot;invisible man&quot; as he feels outcast by people around him, leading him to imagine a nightmarish totalitarian world. &quot;Mouth Almighty&quot; is about a man who cannot control his tongue, which drives his lover away. Gouldstone compares it to some of &quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot; songs, such as &quot;Human Hands&quot;. Costello described &quot;King of Thieves&quot; as &quot;a tricky tune about the trials of a blacklisted songwriter&quot;. Filled with vague lyrics and a sense of paranoia, Gouldstone argues that the song belongs with Costello&#x27;s other tracks that denounce the treatment of big business on everyday people, from &quot;Welcome to the Working Week&quot; (1977), &quot;Senior Service&quot; (1979) and &quot;Opportunity&quot; (1980). &quot;King of Thieves&quot; is sinister like &quot;The Invisible Man&quot;, and similar to 1978&#x27;s &quot;Night Rally&quot;, represents a warning, &quot;foreseeing a world ruled by bureaucracies and unelected despots&quot;. St. Michael compares its complex arrangement to the ones on &quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot;.

&quot;Pills and Soap&quot; provides social commentary on the &quot;abuse of animals as pets and exhibits in factory farming and scientific research&quot;. Inspired by &quot;The Animals Film&quot; (1981), which had turned Costello vegetarian, Costello saw Britain heading in this direction during the era of Thatcherism. Gouldstone comments that it &quot;paints a horrifying picture of the cutthroat free-market economy the Conservatives are trying to create&quot;. The music reinforces the lyrical themes; the author describes its &quot;unrelenting&quot; drumbeat sounding like &quot;a march to the death camps&quot;, and crashing piano chords that &quot;fall like doom&quot;. According to Costello, the beat was inspired by Grandmaster Flash&#x27;s 1982 hip hop song &quot;The Message&quot;. &quot;The World and His Wife&quot; focuses on family life and marks a return to an R&amp;B style. Costello stated that it was &quot;re-written from a solemn folk song about a drunken family gathering into a bilious knees-up&quot;. Providing a musical uplift as the LP&#x27;s closer, Hinton argues that the lyrics culminate the album&#x27;s themes of &quot;boredom, family breakdown, drunken sex and a taste for violence&quot;.

==Packaging==
The album&#x27;s cover artwork is more conventional than Costello&#x27;s previous records; Gouldstone felt it was an attempt to convince listeners that the music inside &quot;won&#x27;t be too outlandish&quot;. Designed by Phil Smee, the photograph of Costello was taken by Nick Knight in Dublin shortly before a warm-up show in June 1983. The artist appears in a &quot;pin-up picture&quot;, scratching his left ear as he dons a black cap, a dark collared-up coat and steel-frame glasses. Comparing his appearance to John Lennon, Hinton describes Costello&#x27;s near-smile look as &quot;quizzical&quot;. &quot;Sounds&quot; magazine&#x27;s Edwin Pouncey found his appearance similar to a Beat Poet, and likened the Letraset border to the publications &quot;The Face&quot; and &quot;NME&quot;. &quot;Hot Press&quot; passingly described the cover as &quot;dressed in the glamour of commerce with ugly Elvis gazing out all soft-focus and cute&quot;.

Costello and the Attractions are present on the back sleeve looking off into the distance with their hands in their pockets. The sleeve was packaged with lyric sheet, albeit with juddered typeface; &quot;The Invisible Man&quot; title has the word &#x27;invisible&#x27; faded. Images of the album&#x27;s musicians appear sideways on the sheet: Afrodiziak are wearing turbans, the TKO Horns are dressed in suit and ties, while Baker, with his eyes closed, Hinton believes &quot;has the pallor of a corpse&quot;. The album&#x27;s original intended artwork, designed by Barney Bubbles, Hinton believes was &quot;far less user-friendly&quot;. Examining the rejected piece in his 1999 biography of Costello, he writes:
==Release and promotion==
The album&#x27;s release was briefly delayed while F-Beat Records changed worldwide distribution from Warner Bros. to RCA Records. In May 1983, Costello issued &quot;Pills and Soap&quot; as a single on his newly created IMP label, an imprint of his F-Beat subsidiary Demon Records, under the pseudonym &quot;The Imposter&quot;, after a song on &quot;Get Happy!!&quot; It was limited to 15,000 copies and was packaged in a plain sleeve and backed by an &quot;extended version&quot; of the A-side; Costello delivered copies to music editors himself. Discussing its rush-release, Costello stated that he &quot;wanted it out quickly&quot; and did not want to &quot;wait the month or two that it would take to finalise legal matters&quot;. The single reached number 16 in the UK, becoming the artist&#x27;s highest-charting single in two years. It was supposedly deleted on the eve of the 1983 General Election, although Thomson and St. Michael state this is inaccurate.

From May to July 1983, Costello underwent extensive promotion for the album, conducting over 100 interviews and made regular television and radio appearances. In June, he and the Attractions performed a small series of gigs in the UK with the TKO Horns, debuting several &quot;Punch the Clock&quot; songs live. From July to August, he toured America with the TKO Horns. The setlists primarily relied on material from &quot;Get Happy!!&quot;, &quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot; and &quot;Punch the Clock&quot;, although the shows suffered from Costello&#x27;s hoarse voice. During this time he recorded a cover of &quot;Walking on Thin Ice&quot;—Yoko Ono&#x27;s tribute to her late-husband John Lennon—for a tribute album in New Orleans. This was followed by a tour of the UK from late-September to late-November, which saw the addition of Afrodiziak.

&quot;Everyday I Write the Book&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s first single, backed by &quot;Heathen Town&quot;, in July 1983. It was Costello&#x27;s biggest US single yet, charting at number 32; it also reached number 28 in the UK. Its accompanying music video features lookalikes of Prince Charles and Princess Diana getting on each other&#x27;s nerves. &quot;Punch the Clock&quot; was issued the following month on 5 August. Reaching number three on the UK Albums Chart and number 24 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape chart, it was the artist&#x27;s best-selling album since &quot;Get Happy!!&quot; and eventually certified gold on both sides of Atlantic. Elsewhere, &quot;Punch the Clock&quot; charted in New Zealand (6), Sweden (9), Norway (18), Australia (22) and the Netherlands (27). &quot;Let Them All Talk&quot;, backed by &quot;The Flirting Kind&quot;, was issued as the second single in September 1983. It reached number 59 in the UK.

==Critical reception==

In contrast to the critical acclaim that afforded &quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot;, &quot;Punch the Clock&quot; received mixed-to-positive reviews from music critics. Several compared it to its predecessor both positively and negatively. &quot;Creem&quot; Laura Fissinger felt the new album did not &quot;advance Costello&#x27;s grand artistic plans&quot; like &quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot;. In &quot;NME&quot;, Lock wrote that if it is &quot;a step back from the stunning sophistication of &quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot;, &quot;Punch the Clock&quot; is &quot;perhaps a step toward pop survival&quot;. More positively, Sweeting stated in &quot;Melody Maker&quot;: &quot;Where &quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot; often wallowed low in the water under its top-heavy superstructure of grandiose arrangements and encyclopedic lyrics, &quot;Punch the Clock&quot; draws up a short-list of priorities and nails them with ruthless efficiency.&quot;

Amongst positive reviews, Pouncey described &quot;Punch the Clock&quot; as an &quot;enjoyable listening experience&quot; in &quot;Sounds&quot;, praising the performances of Costello, the Attractions and TKO Horns. He concluded: &quot;If you were to judge this particular &#x27;book&#x27; by its cover then you&#x27;d probably drop it like a hot potato, but once inside you&#x27;ll be amply rewarded.&quot; Jock Baird of &quot;Musician&quot; magazine similarly said: &quot;For many, critics and otherwise, the pearls of &quot;Punch the Clock&quot; will have to be dived for, but their value will be all the more increased for it.&quot; In a five-star review for &quot;Record Mirror&quot;, Mike Gardner declared &quot;Punch the Clock&quot; &quot;a vital collection that holds its head up high even amongst Elvis&#x27; vast legacy&quot;. Boo Browning of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; considered it his &quot;most honest and well-integrated work to date&quot;, one that contains his &quot;best arrangements, melodies and singing&quot; since &quot;My Aim Is True&quot; (1977). Several felt Costello remained one of the best songwriters of the era.

Some agreed that while the album is not perfect, it still contained several &quot;knockouts&quot;. David Hepworth of &quot;Smash Hits&quot; felt there was &quot;enough power and detail&quot; in tracks such as &quot;King of Thieves&quot; and &quot;The World and His Wife&quot; to warrant repeated listens, while Jon Young deemed &quot;Punch the Clock&quot; &quot;a smart album that protests its own cleverness too much&quot; in &quot;Trouser Press&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; Christopher Connelly declared it &quot;a satisfying, if unstartling, opus&quot;, one that contains what fans expect of him: &quot;terrific tunes, take-it-or-leave-it singing and jaw-breaking wordplay that baffles as much as it enlightens.&quot; Amongst individual tracks, numerous highlighted &quot;Shipbuilding&quot; and &quot;Pills and Soap&quot; as the album&#x27;s standouts; some even felt the former was Costello&#x27;s finest composition to date.

&quot;Billboard&quot; magazine found the songs more accessible and believed Costello was striving for a broader audience. Other critics commented on Costello&#x27;s change in musical direction; Holden described the material as his &quot;frothiest, most accessible pop music&quot; to date in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Langer and Winstanley&#x27;s production received both positive and negative comments. According to Hinton, several saw the production as &quot;over-slick&quot; compared to Emerick&#x27;s on &quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot;.

Other reviewers were more negative towards &quot;Punch the Clock&quot;. In &quot;Creem&quot;, Fissinger felt it was a &quot;(fairly) simple case of reach exceeding grasp&quot;. Writing for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau criticised the album for a lack of innovation coming off its predecessor, equating to a &quot;disparate collection&quot; that is a &quot;major letdown&quot;. Richard Cromelin was also negative in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, disparaging the musical retread of past works and the lack of force and spirit in the songs that drove his previous works. He further condemned the singing as lacking &quot;customary driven edge&quot; and the production as &quot;provides a flat sound&quot;, concluding: &quot;The man who brilliantly dissected life in terms of &quot;Armed Forces&quot; appears to have declared neutrality. It doesn&#x27;t suit him, and the sooner he rejoins the fray the better.&quot;

At the end of the year, &quot;NME&quot; named &quot;Punch the Clock&quot; the best album of 1983. In &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s annual Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll for the year&#x27;s best albums, &quot;Punch the Clock&quot; finished at number 11.

==Legacy==

Costello was initially disappointed with &quot;Punch the Clock&quot;. He bemoaned its &quot;lack of heart&quot;, &quot;misplaced arrangements&quot; and felt it disregarded longevity: &quot;A lot of the planning, the imaginary production of the record relates to pop music of the moment.&quot; Later on, he lambasted the &quot;passionless fads of that charmless time: the early &#x27;80s.&quot; In December 1983, he began writing songs for a follow-up album, attempting to put &quot;more craft and focus&quot; into the tunes which he believed &quot;Punch the Clock&quot; lacked. The record&#x27;s commercial success, however, enabled Costello to invite Langer and Winstanley back to produce, although relations between the songwriter and the Attractions were at a low point due to feeling sidelined by the TKO Horns and backing singers during the US and UK tours. The resulting album, &quot;Goodbye Cruel World&quot;, Costello hated and is regarded by biographers as the artist&#x27;s low point.

===Retrospective appraisal===

&quot;Punch the Clock&quot; has received mixed reviews in later decades. Writing in 1991, Greg Kot of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; considered the album &quot;a partially successful stab at mainstream success&quot;, while &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; Armond White simply wrote: &quot;Work was never more fun, never better sung.&quot; Writing for &quot;Blender&quot; magazine in 2005, Douglas Wolk deemed the record a &quot;not-entirely successful attempt to score pop hits&quot;, but saw &quot;a whimsy and effervescence&quot; that rarely appears in the artist&#x27;s other works.

In a retrospective write-up, &quot;Trouser Press&quot; called the album &quot;another tour de force&quot;, while Lee Zimmerman of &quot;Goldmine&quot; wrote that it includes some of Costello&#x27;s best songs of the era and some of his most successful. More unfavourably, Erlewine deemed &quot;Punch the Clock&quot; the artist&#x27;s &quot;least consistent set of original songs&quot; up to that point, finding most of the material falls short of his standards. Erlewine enjoyed the production but found the uneven songwriting means &quot;only portions&quot; of the album as a whole are memorable. On the other hand, &quot;Uncut&quot; Jon Wilde felt the LP was weighed down by the &quot;over-sheened production&quot;, the horns and backing vocalists. Nevertheless, commentators particularly highlight &quot;Pills and Soap&quot; and &quot;Shipbuilding&quot; as the record&#x27;s standouts; Erlewine says they are &quot;articulate and effective as any of his past work&quot;. Perone argues that the two tracks anticipated the more political-charged commentary that continued to infuse Costello&#x27;s work in subsequent decades.

Costello&#x27;s biographers have given mixed reactions to &quot;Punch the Clock&quot;. Writing positively, Clayton-Lea says that while it lacked &quot;the sultry, sleazy sophistication&quot; of &quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot;, its music stood out as &quot;bright&quot; as &quot;Armed Forces&quot;. He ultimately declares it &quot;another stylistic triumph from a pop star who wasn&#x27;t all that popular&quot;. Hinton, who titled his 1999 biography of Costello after &quot;Let Them All Talk&quot;, is more negative, calling the album&#x27;s sound dated in the CD age, finding that &quot;the album sounds unpleasantly squashed, and never quite loud enough, no matter what volume you play it at.&quot; Thomson recognises the record&#x27;s unified sound, but believes it was &quot;thin contrived&quot;. He also disliked the sidelining of the Attractions and felt Afrodiziak and the TKO Horns displayed &quot;very little subtlety&quot; in the final mix. Thomson and Gouldstone agree that too many songs lack the &quot;craft&quot; and &quot;intensity&quot;, respectively, of Costello&#x27;s previous works and were ultimately not up to the artist&#x27;s standards.

Gouldstone and Perone criticise some of the lyrics as &quot;too abstract and uninvolving&quot; and &quot;surface level&quot;, respectively. Although the former disregards all of the melodies aside from &quot;Shipbuilding&quot; (which was written by Langer), the latter found it more memorable overall than &quot;Goodbye Cruel World&quot;. When not compared to other works, however, Gouldstone recognizes &quot;Punch the Clock&quot; as &quot;a varied, provocative and punchy collection of well-above-average songs&quot;. Perone, who deems the album &quot;accessible, but not particularly deep&quot;, observes that the album&#x27;s lyrical themes of narrators acknowledging their shortcomings and accepting responsibility for their actions were expanded upon in &quot;Goodbye Cruel World&quot;.

In lists ranking Costello&#x27;s albums from worst to best, &quot;Punch the Clock&quot; has placed modestly. In 2021, writers for &quot;Stereogum&quot; placed it at number nine (out of 27), saying that the artist&#x27;s material ranges from &quot;mostly good to excellent&quot;, but found the &quot;overwhelming sonics&quot; run their course throughout the album&#x27;s runtime. A year later in 2022, Michael Gallucci placed it at number 10 (out of 29) in &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot;, while &quot;Spin&quot; Al Shipley placed it at number 23 (out of 31). Both gave high praise to &quot;Shipbuilding&quot; but found the production becomes overbearing at times. In 2013, &quot;NME&quot; ranked &quot;Punch the Clock&quot; at number 345 in its list of &quot;the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;.

==Reissues==
&quot;Punch the Clock&quot; was first released on CD through Columbia and Demon in January 1988. Its first extended reissue through Demon in the UK and Rykodisc in the US on CD came on 24 February 1995, which included a slew of bonus tracks and Bubbles&#x27; original artwork.

&quot;Punch the Clock&quot; was again reissued by Rhino Records on 9 September 2003 as a two-disc set with additional bonus tracks, totalling 40. The 2003 reissue was positively received. Zimmerman praised the bonus tracks as &quot;perfectly complement[ing]&quot; the originals, even finding Costello&#x27;s ten solo demos highlighted the strength of the songs themselves. Wilde felt the bonus disc &quot;redeemed&quot; the record. It was later remastered and reissued by UMe on 6 November 2015.

<text>The AT&amp;T Hobbit is a microprocessor design developed by AT&amp;T Corporation in the early 1990s. It was based on the company&#x27;s CRISP (C-language Reduced Instruction Set Processor) design resembling the classic RISC pipeline, and which in turn grew out of the C Machine design by Bell Labs of the late 1980s. All were optimized for running code compiled from the C programming language. The design concentrates on fast instruction decoding, indexed array access, and procedure calls.

The project was ended in March 1994 because the Hobbit failed to achieve commercially viable sales.

The C Machine Project at Bell Labs had been underway since 1975 to develop computer architectures to run C programming language programs efficiently, aiming for a design that would offer an order of magnitude performance improvement over commercially available computers while remaining competitive in terms of cost. The design methodology for the C Machine architecture involved an iterative development approach informed by measurements of C program characteristics, involving the formulation and implementation of new computer architecture revisions, the development of a compiler to target each new revision, the compilation of &quot;a large body of UNIX software&quot;, and the analysis of the compiled software. The results from such measurements then informed subsequent architecture revisions.

Following on from the stabilization of the C Machine architecture in 1981 for an uncompleted ECL implementation, a design team was formed for CRISP in April 1983, and CRISP was first produced in a silicon implementation in 1986. The performance objectives were largely met by the fabricated processor, running at 16 MHz and delivering a Dhrystone benchmark score over 13 times greater than the VAX-11/750, achieving approximately 7.7 VAX MIPS. This was competitive with the MIPS R2000 as delivered in the MIPS M/500 Development System (an 8 MHz device delivering around 7.4 VAX MIPS) although some benchmarks showed somewhat stronger performance by the CRISP processor. Compared to the R2000 which required numerous support chips when incorporated into a computer system, the CRISP was a &quot;complete&quot; processor incorporating on-chip caches and had &quot;substantially&quot; reduced board area requirements.

It was subsequently reoriented toward low-power applications and commercialized, resulting in the Hobbit. It was introduced in 1992 in the form of the 92010 and aimed at the personal communicator market. Operating at 3.3V, its reported performance is up to 13.5 VAX MIPS. Initial pricing in multiples of 10,000 units was given as $35 per unit, with the full chipset below $100. Several support chips were produced:

* AT&amp;T 92011 System Management Unit
* AT&amp;T 92012 PCMCIA Controller
* AT&amp;T 92013 Peripheral Controller
* AT&amp;T 92014 Display Controller

AT&amp;T followed in 1993 with the 92020 family of processors, introducing new support chipsets targeting different applications. These devices can run at 3.3V or at 5V with an elevated clock frequency. The 92020S is pin-compatible with the 92010, has a larger 6 KB instruction cache (as opposed to the 3 KB cache of the 92010), and performs the equivalent of 16 VAX MIPS with a typical power consumption of 210 mW. The 92020S was intended to be used in conjunction with most of the original 92010 chipset, excluding the 92013 peripheral controller. Meanwhile, the 92020M and 92020MX processors were intended for use with the new support chips, also employing a multiplexed address and data bus for reduced pin count, and offering lower levels of performance, with the 92020M also utilizing a 6 KB cache and achieving similar performance to the original 92010. The updated support chips are as follows:

* AT&amp;T 92021M System Management Unit
* AT&amp;T 92021MX System Management Unit
* AT&amp;T 92024M Display Controller

The most highly integrated processor, the 92020MX, preserved the 3 KB cache of the 92010 but has a single-channel PCMCIA interface and a display controller supporting resolutions of up to . Costing $32 per unit in 10,000 unit quantities, it presented opportunities for cost reduction with certain devices when compared to the original Hobbit chipset.

Apple Computer approached AT&amp;T and paid it to develop a newer version of the CRISP suitable for low-power use in the Newton handheld computer. The Hobbit-based Newton was never produced. According to Larry Tesler, &quot;The Hobbit was rife with bugs, ill-suited for our purposes, and overpriced. We balked after AT&amp;T demanded not one but several million more dollars in development fees.&quot; Apple rejected the Hobbit and adopted the ARM610 for the Newton, also partnering with Acorn Computers and VLSI Technology to form Advanced RISC Machines (ARM) in late 1990 with a $2.5 million investment. Apple sold its stake in ARM years later for a net $800 million.

The Active Book Company (founded by Hermann Hauser, who also founded Acorn Computers), which had been using an ARM in its Active Book personal digital assistant (PDA), was later purchased by AT&amp;T and was subsumed by AT&amp;T&#x27;s Eo subsidiary, which produced an early PDA, the EO Personal Communicator, running PenPoint OS from the GO Corporation.

AT&amp;T made early announcements in 1992 of broad vendor adoption. Hobbit was used in the earliest prototypes of the BeBox until in 1993, AT&amp;T announced discontinuation of Hobbit. AT&amp;T closed its Eo operations which were responsible for the only commercially released product using the Hobbit, and finally discontinued the Hobbit in 1994.

==Design==
In a traditional RISC design implementing a load–store architecture, memory is accessed through instructions that explicitly load data into registers and store data back to memory, with instructions that manipulate data working solely on the registers. By seeking to limit the data processing operations to a single clock cycle, a simpler control mechanism can be employed to dispatch instructions, making it easier to tune the instruction pipelines, and add superscalar support. However, programming languages do not actually operate in this fashion. Generally they use a stack containing local variables and other information for subroutines known as a stack frame or activation record. The compiler writes code to create activation records using the underlying processor&#x27;s load-store design.

The C Machine in its CRISP implementation, and the Hobbit that followed directly, both aim to support the types of memory access that programming languages use, with the C programming language being a particular consideration. Instructions can access memory directly, referencing values in structures and arrays held within memory and updating memory with computation results. Although this memory-to-memory model is typical of the earlier CISC designs, the C Machine as implemented by CRISP differs from both CISC and RISC designs, including the earlier Bellmac 32, by providing no directly accessible registers. Instead, a &quot;stack cache&quot; of 32-bit register entries is provided, 32 entries in CRISP but extended to 64 entries in Hobbit, mapped to the address space corresponding to the top of the program stack, these being purely accessible using a stack-relative addressing mode. The CRISP architecture was described as a &quot;2½ address memory-to-memory machine&quot;, where instructions can employ zero, one, or two memory addresses and can employ a stack entry called the accumulator for computation results. Reminiscent of the Bellmac 32 architecture, various instructions designed to support procedure calling are provided by the CRISP architecture: &quot;call&quot; saves the return address and branches to a routine; &quot;enter&quot; allocates a stack frame for a routine, flushing stack cache entries if necessary; &quot;return&quot; deallocates the stack frame and branches to the caller&#x27;s return address; &quot;catch&quot; restores stack entries from memory.

One side effect of the Hobbit design is that it inspired designers of the Dis virtual machine (an offshoot of Plan 9 from Bell Labs) to use a memory-to-memory-based system that more closely matches the internal register-based workings of real-world processors. They found, as RISC designers would have expected, that without a load-store design it was difficult to improve the instruction pipeline and thereby operate at higher speeds. They decided that all future processors would thus move to a load-store design, and built Inferno to reflect this. In contrast, Java and .NET virtual machines are stack-based, a side effect of being designed by language programmers as opposed to chip designers. Translating from a stack-based language to a register-based assembly language is a &quot;heavyweight&quot; operation; Java&#x27;s virtual machine (VM) and compiler are many times larger and slower than the Dis VM and the Limbo (the most common language compiled for Dis) compiler. The VMs for Android (Dalvik), Parrot, and Lua are also register-based.

<text>Harvey Comics (also known as Harvey World Famous Comics, Harvey Publications, Harvey Comics Entertainment, Harvey Hits, Harvey Illustrated Humor, and Harvey Picture Magazines) was an American comic book publisher, founded in New York City by Alfred Harvey in 1941, after buying out the small publisher Brookwood Publications. His brothers, Robert B. and Leon Harvey, joined shortly after. The company soon got into licensed characters, which, by the 1950s, became the bulk of their output. The artist Warren Kremer was closely associated with the publisher. 

Harvey Comics&#x27; most notable characters are Casper the Friendly Ghost and Richie Rich. Harvey&#x27;s mascot is named Joker, a harlequin jack-in-the-box character. He was also the mascot of the cartoon shorts series &quot;Noveltoons&quot; which brought many Harvey Comics characters to life; he also appeared as a cameo in the ending scene of the film &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;, alongside many other famous cartoon characters.

==History==

Harvey Comics was founded by the Harvey brothers—Alfred, Leon and Robert—in the 1940s after first acquiring an existing—faltering—title from Brookwood Publications, &quot;Speed Comics&quot;. The title&#x27;s headliners were Shock Gibson and Captain Freedom, a patriotic hero like The Shield. Harvey added more anthologies, including Champion Comics and Pocket Comics. From the new titles only one would stay around for a while: The Black Cat, a Hollywood starlet-superhero, which was published into the 1950s.

Harvey began a shift to licensed characters when in 1942 it took over as the radio hero Green Hornet&#x27;s publisher from Holyoke after six issues. Harvey added additional titles, such that most of their titles were licensed. Licensed characters included Joe Palooka, Blondie, Dick Tracy, and other newspaper strip characters.

The company ultimately became best known for characters it published in comics from 1950s onward, particularly those it licensed from the animation company Famous Studios, a unit of Paramount Pictures, starting in 1951. These include Little Audrey, Casper the Friendly Ghost, Baby Huey, and Herman and Katnip. Harvey also licensed popular characters from newspaper comic strips, such as &quot;Mutt and Jeff&quot; and &quot;Sad Sack&quot;. In addition, Harvey developed such original properties as Richie Rich, Little Dot and Little Lotta.
While the company tried to diversify the comics it published, with brief forays in the 1950s and 1960s into superhero, suspense, horror, western and other forms in such imprints as Harvey Thriller and Thrill Adventure, children&#x27;s comics were the bulk of its output.

In July 1958, Harvey purchased the October 1950–December 1959 Famous Studios cartoons (including character rights and rights to the cartoon shorts, but excluding Popeye). The Famous cartoons were repackaged and distributed to television as Harveytoons, and Harvey continued production on new comics and a handful of new cartoons produced for television. Casper the Friendly Ghost, who had been Famous&#x27; most popular original character, now became Harvey&#x27;s top draw. Associated characters such as Spooky the Tuff Little Ghost, The Ghostly Trio, Casper&#x27;s horse Nightmare, Hot Stuff the Little Devil, and Wendy the Good Little Witch were added to the Harvey line. In 1963, when Paramount entered into a $78,000 agreement with Harvey to produce &quot;The New Casper Cartoon Show&quot;, they also sold their pre-March 1962 library of cartoons to Harvey for $1.

===1980s decline and sale===
By the early 1980s, Marvel Comics was in negotiations with Harvey Comics to assume publication of some of their characters. Harvey editor Sid Jacobson, along with the other Harvey staff, were interviewed by Mike Hobson, Marvel&#x27;s group vice-president of publishing (de facto publisher). As part of the process, Jacobson created several new characters which were well received by Hobson and effectively sealed the deal. Marvel Editor-in-Chief Jim Shooter appointed editor Tom DeFalco as executive editor to coordinate with the Harvey staff, who were hired by Marvel. On the day Marvel was set to take over the Harvey publications, Harvey Comics pulled out of the deal due to an internal disagreement among the two remaining Harvey brothers, Alfred and Leon. Harvey would cease publishing its comics in 1982.

In summer 1984, Steve Geppi (owner of Diamond Comic Distributors and Geppi&#x27;s Comic World) paid $50,000 for, among other properties, Harvey&#x27;s entire archive of original art from the Harvey comic &quot;Sad Sack&quot;. Geppi made this agreement with Steve Harvey, who at the time was president of Harvey Publications Inc., as well as president of Sad Sack Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Harvey Publications, Inc.

In 1985 the Marvel imprint Star Comics published a title called &quot;Royal Roy&quot;. Harvey sued Star for copyright infringement, claiming that Roy was a blatant copy of Richie Rich. Veteran Harvey writer-artist Lennie Herman had created &quot;Royal Roy&quot; for Star Comics. Herman died in 1983 before the first issue of &quot;Royal Roy&quot; was published. The &quot;Royal Roy&quot; comic ended after six issues and the lawsuit was dropped.

In 1986, Harvey resumed publication under the leadership of Alan Harvey (Alfred&#x27;s oldest son), focusing on a few core titles, digests, and reprints.

In 1987, Harvey sued Columbia Pictures, for $50 million, claiming that the Ghostbusters logo used in the 1984 film was too reminiscent of Fatso from the Casper series. The court ruled in Columbia&#x27;s favor, due to Harvey&#x27;s failure to renew the copyrights on early Casper stories and the &quot;limited ways to draw a figure of a cartoon ghost&quot;.

===Later History===

In 1989, Harvey Comics was sold to Jeffrey Montgomery&#x27;s HMH Communications and was renamed as Harvey Comics Entertainment, later named The Harvey Entertainment Company. located in Santa Monica, California. Under the new ownership, the company emphasized on re-syndicating their properties for both television and in press.

Following the initial wave of syndicating the Harvey catalogue, Harvey began producing their own original programs including &quot;The Baby Huey Show&quot; and &quot;Richie Rich&quot;, as well as producing feature-length films under an agreement with Universal Pictures, including &quot;Richie Rich&quot; and &quot;Casper&quot;, later outsourcing the production of direct-to-video material for both franchises over to Saban Entertainment.

Montgomery was ousted from the company in March 1998, and following various acquisitions and expansions to add content outside of the Harvey Classics including the purchase of PM Entertainment, Harvey was close to going into liquidation. In February 2001, The Harvey Entertainment Company announced that it would sell the entire Harvey catalogue over to Classic Media, a deal of which would close by June 2001.
The rights to Sad Sack, Black Cat, and certain other Harvey characters are still owned by Alan Harvey, and have been published under the names of Lorne-Harvey Publications and Re-Collections. In late 2000, Alan Harvey sued Steve Geppi over his 1984 acquisition of the &quot;Sad Sack&quot; original art, charging that Geppi had plundered Harvey&#x27;s warehouses. Geppi countersued, claiming that he had legal title to the original art. The suit was settled in late 2002; at the time of the settlement, the New York Supreme Court had dismissed Harvey&#x27;s claims against Geppi. The settlement agreement allowed Geppi to keep the art, with no money changing hands.

== Distribution of cartoons ==

For years, the television distribution rights to the &quot;Harveytoons&quot; library were licensed to Worldvision Enterprises. Worldvision would hold distribution rights to many earlier Famous Studios cartoons (plus most of the cartoons by Fleischer Studios) for a short time, until being absorbed by the television division of Paramount Pictures, which originally distributed the cartoons.

Universal Studios, which owns the pre-1950 Paramount sound features through its television division, once held video rights to the Harvey-owned cartoons, until 2001 when Classic Media obtained the animated catalog. In 2016, rights to the Harvey Comics properties returned to Universal when they acquired Classic Media&#x27;s parent company, DreamWorks Animation, who later produced &quot;Harvey Street Kids&quot; (later renamed &quot;Harvey Girls Forever!&quot;) based on Harvey Comics characters.

<doc id="1344849" wikidata="Q1125415" url="?curid=1344849" title="Weltschmerz">
<text> (; literally &quot;world-pain&quot;) is a literary concept describing the feeling experienced by an individual who believes that reality can never satisfy the expectations of the mind, resulting in &quot;a mood of weariness or sadness about life arising from the acute awareness of evil and suffering&quot;.

The term was coined by the German Romantic author Jean Paul in his 1827 novel &quot;Selina&quot;, and in its original definition in the &quot;&quot; by the Brothers Grimm, it denotes a deep sadness about the insufficiency of the world (). The translation can differ depending on context; in reference to the self it can mean &quot;world-weariness&quot;, while in reference to the world it can mean &quot;the pain of the world&quot;.

The worldview of &quot;Weltschmerz&quot; has been retroactively seen as widespread among Romantic and decadent authors such as Jean Paul, the Marquis de Sade, Lord Byron, Giacomo Leopardi, William Blake, Charles Baudelaire, Paul Verlaine, François-René de Chateaubriand, Oscar Wilde, Alfred de Musset, Mikhail Lermontov, Nikolaus Lenau, Hermann Hesse, and Heinrich Heine.

==Further examples==
The modern meaning of in the German language is the psychological pain caused by sadness that can occur when realizing that someone&#x27;s own weaknesses are caused by the inappropriateness and cruelty of the world and (physical and social) circumstances.

In &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot;, Henry Miller describes an acquaintance, &quot;Moldorf&quot;, who has prescriptions for &quot;Weltschmerz&quot; on scraps of paper in his pocket. John Steinbeck wrote about this feeling in two of his novels; in &quot;East of Eden&quot;, Samuel Hamilton feels it after meeting Cathy Trask for the first time, where it is referred to as the &quot;Welshrats&quot;, it is also mentioned in &quot;The Winter of our Discontent&quot;. Ralph Ellison uses the term in &quot;Invisible Man&quot; with regard to the pathos inherent in the singing of spirituals: &quot;Beneath the swiftness of the hot tempo there was a slower tempo and a cave and I entered it and looked around and heard an old woman singing a spiritual as full of &quot;Weltschmerz&quot; as flamenco&quot;. Kurt Vonnegut references the feeling in his novel &quot;Player Piano&quot;, in which it is felt by Doctor Paul Proteus and his father.
In John D. MacDonald&#x27;s novel &quot;Free Fall in Crimson&quot;, Travis McGee describes &quot;Weltschmerz&quot; as &quot;homesickness for a place you have never seen&quot;.
In Edward Abbey&#x27;s novel The Fool&#x27;s Progress, page 243 discusses protagonist Henry Lightcap&#x27;s despair and &quot;the Weltschmerz of Europe&quot;, amongst other depressing and gloomy states of the world.

<text>The Grassington Millennium Project was an initiative that focused on detailing the organizational means, operational priorities, and financing structures necessary to achieve the Millennium Development Goals or (MDGs). The goals are aimed at the reduction of poverty, hunger, disease, illiteracy, environmental degradation, and Gender-Based Violence . At the United Nations Millennium Summit in September 2000 world leaders had initiated the development of the MDGs and set a completion date for the project of June 2005.

In order to support the MDGs, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan and Administrator of the UN Development Programme (UNDP) Mark Malloch Brown launched the Millennium Project to determine the best strategies for achieving the MDGs. The Project was headed by Professor Jeffrey Sachs. The Millennium Project worked from 2002 to 2005 to devise a recommended plan of implementation that would allow all developing countries to meet the MDGs and thereby substantially improve the human condition by 2015. The Millennium Project presented its final recommendations in its report to the Secretary-General &quot;Investing in Development: A Practical Plan to Achieve the Millennium Development Goals&quot;, completed in January 2005.

Ten theme-oriented task forces have been created in order to perform the majority of the research. The task forces are an amalgamation of representatives from the academic community, public and private sectors of society, civil society organizations, and UN agencies that also include participants from outside the UN. Each Task Force is composed of 15-20 members who are all international leaders in their specific area, and are selected on the basis of their practical experience and technical expertise.

==Eight Goals==
*1 Eradicate extreme hunger and poverty
*2 Achieve universal primary education
*3 Promote gender equality and empower women
*4 Reduce child mortality
*5 Improve maternal health
*6 Combat HIV/AIDS, Malaria and other diseases
*7 Ensure environmental stability
*8 A global partnership for development

<doc id="1344860" wikidata="Q126877727" url="?curid=1344860" title="Hampstead and Highgate (UK Parliament constituency)">
<text>Hampstead and Highgate is a parliamentary constituency covering the northern half of the London Borough of Camden, and a small part of the London Borough of Haringey. It includes the villages of Hampstead and Highgate. It has been represented by Tulip Siddiq of the Labour Party since 2024.

It was abolished in the 2010 general election, with the majority forming the new constituency of Hampstead and Kilburn, and part going into the Holborn and St Pancras seat.

Further to the completion of the 2023 periodic review of Westminster constituencies, the seat was re-established for the 2024 general election.

==History==
Some areas here were amongst the wealthiest in the UK, but the seat always had an intellectual, artistic middle-class vote associated with the intelligentsia (see main page on Hampstead). It also contained Kilburn, with its large Irish community. The Labour incumbent in Hampstead and Highgate at the time of abolition, Glenda Jackson, retained the new constituency of Hampstead and Kilburn in 2010 with a majority of just 42.

==Boundaries==

1983–1997: The London Borough of Camden wards of Adelaide, Belsize, Fitzjohns, Fortune Green, Frognal, Hampstead Town, Highgate, Kilburn, Priory, South End, Swiss Cottage, and West End.

1997–2010: The London Borough of Camden wards of Adelaide, Belsize, Fitzjohns, Fortune Green, Frognal, Gospel Oak, Hampstead Town, Highgate, Kilburn, Priory, South End, Swiss Cottage, and West End.

In 2002, a Local Government Boundary Commission for England review abolished the Adelaide, Priory, South End and West End wards, whilst it combined Frognal and Fitzjohns into one ward. For the 2005 general election, the electoral wards used in this constituency were Belsize, Camden Town with Primrose Hill (part), Fortune Green, Frognal and Fitzjohns, Gospel Oak (part), Hampstead Town, Haverstock (part), Highgate (part), Kilburn, Swiss Cottage and West Hampstead.

Following their review of parliamentary representation in North London, the Boundary Commission for England created a new constituency of Hampstead and Kilburn by excluding Highgate ward (which became part of Holborn &amp; St Pancras) and including three wards from the neighbouring borough of Brent. Hampstead and Kilburn largely replaced Hampstead and Highgate for the 2010 general election.

2024–present: The London Borough of Camden wards of Belsize, Fortune Green, Frognal, Gospel Oak, Hampstead Town, Highgate, Kilburn, Primrose Hill (part); South Hampstead, and West Hampstead, and the London Borough of Haringey ward of Highgate.
:&quot;It comprises those parts of the Borough of Camden previously in the abolished Hampstead and Kilburn constituency, plus the Gospel Oak and Highgate wards, transferred from Holborn and St Pancras, and the Highgate ward in the Borough of Haringey, transferred from Hornsey and Wood Green.&quot;

<doc id="1344861" wikidata="Q7150748" url="?curid=1344861" title="Paul Fromm (white supremacist)">
<text>Frederick Paul Fromm (born January 3, 1949) is a Canadian former high school teacher, white supremacist, neo-Nazi, and perennial political candidate.

Fromm is the international director of the white supremacist organization Council of Conservative Citizens and is the director of several far-right groups in Canada, most notably the Canadian Association for Free Expression, Citizens for Foreign Aid Reform and the Canada First Immigration Reform Committee.

He has hosted a radio show on the &quot;Stormfront&quot; web site and has ties to former Ku Klux Klan members David Duke, Don Black, and Mark Martin, a white supremacist rally organizer in Covington, Ohio. The &quot;National Post&quot; newspaper described him as &quot;one of Canada&#x27;s most notorious white supremacists&quot;.

Since 2018, he has been based in Hamilton, Ontario, but he previously lived in Mississauga, Ontario, outside of Toronto, since the 1970s.

==Family==
Fromm was born in Bogotá, Colombia to Canadian parents, and grew up in Etobicoke in a devout Catholic family. His mother, Marguerite Michaud, was of French Canadian descent, while his father, Frederick William Fromm, was of German and Irish descent. His father enlisted in the Royal Canadian Navy during World War II. After the war, he qualified as a chartered accountant and worked in Colombia for an oil company. After Fromm was born, the family returned to Ontario where his father found work as an accountant with the provincial Department of Highways.

==Teaching career==

Fromm began teaching at Applewood Heights Secondary School in 1973. During a public meeting on race relations in 1991, he said &quot;scalp them&quot;, while activist Rodney Bobiwash of the Native Canadian Centre was speaking. The Canadian Jewish Congress and community and race relations committee chair Art Eggleton called for review of his employment; the Native Canadian Centre of Toronto called for his dismissal. Fromm said his remark was misinterpreted, and claimed to leave his politics out of the classroom.

Fromm&#x27;s 1990 speech to the Western Guard was shown to the Peel District School Board in 1992, prompting the board to ask the province to review Fromm&#x27;s contract, warn Fromm to end his involvement with racist organizations, and urge the Ontario Teachers&#x27; Federation to establish guidelines of teachers. The OTF replied that such guidelines existed in the Teaching Profession Act, and contesting that it was up to the board to pursue. The board asked the Ontario Ministry of Education to review his teaching certificate.

In June 1993, it was announced that Fromm would be reassigned to teaching adult education, &quot;the best option legally available to the board.&quot; The school board chair suggested adults would be more likely to act on inappropriate behaviour, than high school students.

==White supremacist activities==
Fromm was an admirer of Fidel Castro in the early 1960s, but changed his views after coming across the writings of Barry Goldwater.

In 1967, as a student at the University of Toronto&#x27;s St. Michael&#x27;s College, Fromm co-founded the Edmund Burke Society (EBS), with Don Andrews and Leigh Smith, as well as its student wing &quot;Campus Alternative&quot;. The Edmund Burke Society was a right-wing anti-communist group that agitated against prominent left-wing movements. The group would often disrupt left-wing rallies and events, sometimes violently. The group&#x27;s main focus was opposition to the New Left and other left-wing tendencies that the Society associated with communism. In 1970, the group disrupted a speech by left-wing radical lawyer, William Kunstler, with Fromm climbing on stage and pouring a glass of water on Kunstler&#x27;s lecture notes, resulting in the Chicago Seven&#x27;s lawyer drenching Fromm with a pitcher of water. A melee between EBS members and Kunstler&#x27;s supporters ensued, and Fromm was knocked to the floor unconscious.

With the support of members of the Edmund Burke Society, Fromm was elected president of the Ontario Social Credit Party in 1971, and was able to have other EBS members elected to the party&#x27;s executive. Three Social Credit candidates in the 1971 Ontario election were avowed &quot;Burkers&quot;.

As the New Left movement waned, Edmund Burke Society members turned their attention to issues of race and immigration and became increasingly attracted to white supremacist ideas. In February 1972, the group renamed itself the Western Guard. In 1972, after having lost the Social Credit Party presidency to James McGillvray, Fromm led a successful attempt by the Western Guard to take over the Ontario wing of the Social Credit Party of Canada. The national executive of the national Social Credit Party declared membership in the Western Guard &quot;incompatible&quot; with membership in the party, which led national Social Credit leader Réal Caouette to place the Ontario organization under trusteeship in order to counter Fromm&#x27;s activities.

In May 1972, Fromm was the opening speaker at a Western Guard banquet honouring Robert E. Miles, a former Ku Klux Klan leader who became a leading ideologue in the Christian Identity movement. Fromm, Overfield and several others resigned from the Western Guard in May 1972, immediately after the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot; published an article on the group, which included information about the banquet. Fromm&#x27;s departure left the leadership of the Western Guard in the hands of Don Andrews. Fromm claimed in a 1973 letter to the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; that he left the Western Guard &quot;because of a growing radicalization of its politics and the irresponsibility of some of its activities&quot;. Later, he denied ever having been a member of the Guard, saying he &quot;never had any connection&quot; with the organization. When confronted with his 1973 letter, he dismissed it as &quot;a matter of semantics&quot;.

On August 4, 2008, Fox News interviewed Fromm in relation to the prosecution of right-wing Canadian author Mark Steyn. The Southern Poverty Law Center criticised Fox for identifying Fromm only as a &quot;Free Speech Activist&quot;.

In 2010, Fromm organized small protests across the country against the admission of a group of Sri Lankan Tamil refugees arriving on the MV &quot;Sun Sea&quot;. In August he led a small protest in Calgary with members of the Aryan Guard outside of Immigration Minister Jason Kenney&#x27;s constituency office which &quot;so terrified the receptionist that she locked the door and would not accept Mr. Fromm&#x27;s delivery of a letter until police arrived&quot;. He also organized a small protest with Doug Christie in Esquimalt, British Columbia, where the boat was docked and also led small pickets later in the month in Ottawa and Hamilton.

===Mainstream and electoral politics===
Fromm graduated from university with a master&#x27;s degree in English and an education degree. He worked as a school teacher with the Peel Region Board of Education from 1974 until his dismissal in 1997. He temporarily tried to distance himself from groups that were visibly linked to explicitly racist and neo-Nazi beliefs. He founded Countdown, which led to the creation of three organizations that attempted to make far-right views palatable to the mainstream. Fromm was elected as a Catholic school trustee in 1976, after an unsuccessful attempt in 1974, and served on the Metro Toronto Separate School Board until he was defeated in his bid for re-election two years later. His father, Fred, was also defeated in his 1978 bid for a seat on the board.

In 1976, Fromm founded the Citizens for Foreign Aid Reform (C-FAR), which opposes foreign aid to Third World nations. The organization also deals with other issues, including crime and punishment, multiculturalism and immigration. It sponsors lectures by far-right individuals, and publishes pamphlets and books, mostly about race and immigration. In 1981, Fromm founded Canadian Association for Free Expression (CAFE), in opposition to the Canadian Human Rights Commission. CAFE has been active defending the rights of accused antisemites, racists and Holocaust deniers against prosecution under hate crime and human rights legislation. Another group he founded was Canada First Immigration Reform Committee, which advocates reduced immigration, and opposes immigration by non-whites. These three groups still exist today and are still led by Fromm. Their membership and mandates overlap, and they are essentially a single organization. Fromm&#x27;s leadership of these groups has given him some access to the mainstream media, such as radio talk shows and newspapers.

In the late 1970s, Fromm also founded Canadian Friends of Rhodesia to support the white minority rule regime of Ian Smith and his Rhodesian Front. In the mid to late 1980s, Fromm&#x27;s organizations were involved in advocacy on behalf of South Africa&#x27;s apartheid regime, and opposing the movement to impose economic sanctions on the country.

Fromm attempted to enter mainstream political activity by joining the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada. He was elected treasurer of PC Metro, a network of 31 Toronto PC riding associations on April 15, 1981. He angered many people and embarrassed both the federal and Ontario Progressive Conservatives when a profile in &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; quoted him as saying that breeding a &quot;supreme race&quot; for intelligence was a good idea, and as calling for Vietnamese refugees to be sent to &quot;desert islands&quot; off the Philippines and Indonesia rather than be accepted into Canada where they would &quot;upset the racial balance&quot;. His comments resulted in Progressive Conservative premier Bill Davis being asked in the legislature whether he is willing &quot;to tolerate such neo-fascist, if not fascist, ideas within the Conservative Party&quot;. Federal Progressive Conservative immigration critic Chris Speyer said Fromm&#x27;s remarks were &quot;entirely his and certainly don&#x27;t represent the views of the party or the caucus&quot;. Federal PC president Peter Blaikie asked Fromm to resign from the local executive, telling the press on April 30, 1981: &quot;It&#x27;s quite clear that that article, accurate or inaccurate, sets out a position which is clearly at variance with that of the party&quot;, and that the issue &quot;has created some difficulty and embarrassment for the party&quot;.

In 1983, Fromm was an active supporter of right-wing Member of Parliament John A. Gamble&#x27;s unsuccessful bid to win the leadership of the federal Progressive Conservatives. Fromm&#x27;s work with Gamble continued beyond his unsuccessful leadership bid, and included work in the World Anti-Communist League. In 1993, Gamble was rejected as a candidate for the Reform Party of Canada because of his long association with Fromm and other racist activists.

In the late 1980s, Fromm was an active member of the Reform Party, but was essentially expelled in October 1988 when leader Preston Manning sent Fromm a letter asking him to &quot;dissociate&quot; himself from the party, following complaints by party members about the racist tenor of a speech Fromm made at a Reform Party gathering. In the 1988 federal election, Fromm ran as a candidate for the Confederation of Regions Party in the riding of Mississauga East, and received 288 votes.

In 1997, Fromm was a candidate for the public school board in Peel Region. He received 827 votes (10.39% of ballots cast), coming in last of four candidates.

Fromm was a candidate for mayor of Mississauga, Ontario in the October 25, 2010, municipal election, running on an anti-immigration platform. Fromm reportedly made racist and homophobic comments during his campaign and displayed white supremacist and Holocaust denial literature at his campaign tables. He claimed that train stations in the city looked &quot;like flippin&#x27; Calcutta&quot; and that the city had been &quot;paved over with ticky tacky houses that are mostly filled with East Indians&quot; and is also quoted as saying &quot;I wake up in the morning and I feel great. I&#x27;m high on hate&quot;. On election day, Fromm came in ninth in a field of 17 with 917 votes which represented 0.65% of the total vote. Fromm again ran for Mayor of Mississauga in 2014 receiving 775 votes (0.48%) and coming in 10th in a field of 15.

In the 2011 federal election, Fromm stood in Calgary Southeast as the candidate of the far right Western Block Party against immigration minister Jason Kenney, on a platform advocating a freeze in immigration. Kenney was re-elected, winning over 76% of the vote, while Fromm received 193 votes, around 0.3%.

In 2016, Fromm attempted to join the Conservative Party of Canada in order to support the leadership campaign of Kellie Leitch due to her support for immigration reform and a &quot;Canadian values&quot; test for prospective immigrants. Leitch&#x27;s campaign co-chair Sander Grieve wrote back to Fromm, saying: &quot;We have not processed your membership and we will not be submitting it to the party, as we believe your public statements are not consistent with the principles of the party or the policies being advanced by our campaign.&quot;

Fromm endorsed socially conservative candidate Tanya Granic Allen in the 2018 Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario leadership election. Although she did not respond when originally asked for comment by the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, Granic Allen later publicly stated on Twitter that she rejects his endorsement with the statement: &quot;No place in our party for white supremacists.&quot;

Fromm was a candidate for the Canadians&#x27; Choice Party in Etobicoke Centre during the 2018 Ontario general election, receiving 631 votes (1.1%).

Fromm moved to Hamilton, Ontario in 2018, after having lived in Mississauga for several decades, and registered as a candidate for Mayor of Hamilton in the October 2018 municipal election. Fromm came in 7th in a field of 15 with 706 votes which represented 0.51% of the total vote.

In July 2019, Fromm posed for a photo with Maxime Bernier, party leader of the People&#x27;s Party of Canada. He later endorsed Bernier on Twitter, writing that Bernier had &quot;both the charisma and determination to put CANADA FIRST,&quot; and praising the former Conservative leadership contender&#x27;s immigration policies as steps toward &quot;regaining control&quot; of Canada&#x27;s border.

He was a candidate in the 2023 Scarborough—Guildwood provincial by-election, where he received 66 votes (0.43%).

===Links to other prominent fascists and racists===

In the 1990s, Fromm spoke at several Heritage Front events, including a celebration of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s birthday. A video surfaced of him addressing the rally and referring to Canadian fascist John Ross Taylor as a &quot;hero&quot;. Taylor was one of two Canadian Nazis interned by the government during World War II. The video shows Fromm standing beside a Nazi flag during the Heritage Front&#x27;s &quot;Martyr&#x27;s Day&quot;. The rally included shouts from the audience of &quot;Sieg Heil!&quot;, &quot;white power&quot;, &quot;Hail The Order!&quot; and &quot;nigger, nigger, nigger, out out out&quot;. Fromm, a high school English teacher at the time, was reprimanded by the school board after videos of him speaking at white supremacist rallies came to light in 1992. He was transferred to an adult education centre by the board in 1993 pending the outcome of an investigation into his activities and then fired by the school board in 1997.

In 2000, a published report alleged that developer Martin Weiche, a former leader of the Canadian Nazi Party, was one of Fromm&#x27;s major financial backers. Fromm organized rallies in support of Holocaust denier Ernst Zündel and has shared a stage with David Irving, another individual active in the same denialist movement. B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith legal counsel Anita Bromberg has said &quot;Fromm is the one who has put himself out there most directly as supporting Zündel. He looks as though he&#x27;s waiting in the wings.&quot; In 2004, Fromm was associated with David Duke&#x27;s efforts to unite white nationalists with the &quot;New Orleans Protocol&quot;. In the 2000s, he has tried to revive the display of the Canadian Red Ensign flag.

In January 2005, Fromm defended himself at a disciplinary hearing of the Ontario College of Teachers against charges including &quot;failure to maintain professional standards; not complying with college regulations and bylaws; disgraceful, dishonourable, unprofessional and/or unbecoming conduct; and practising while in a conflict of interest.&quot; Following three days of hearings, further deliberations were postponed. The hearing resumed in the spring of 2007 and on October 31, 2007, the college rendered its ruling stripping Fromm of his licence to teach in the province of Ontario.

Fromm has acted as an advocate for far-right activists who have been called before the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (CHRT). Among those Fromm has represented are Glenn Bahr, the co-founder and former leader of Western Canada for Us, and Terry Tremaine, a former University of Saskatchewan mathematics lecturer. In 2006, he represented the Canadian Heritage Alliance at a CHRT hearing in Toronto, and supported John Beck of the group BC White Pride at a CHRT hearing in Penticton, British Columbia.
Fromm has been described as a mentor to younger &quot;far-right extremists&quot; such as Melissa Guille and Jason Ouwendyk and as a &quot;&#x27;senior player&#x27; in the neo-Nazi movement in Canada.&quot; He identifies himself as an advocate for &quot;white nationalists&quot;.

Fromm has repeatedly spoken at events sponsored by Thomas Robb&#x27;s Ku Klux Klan faction, the Knights Party. In 2007, he was a keynote speaker at the group&#x27;s White Christian Revival gathering.

On March 21, 2009, Fromm participated in a &quot;White Pride&quot; march organized by the Aryan Guard, a neo-Nazi gang in Calgary, Alberta.

In March 2018, Fromm was being investigated by the hate crimes unit of the Hamilton police, after posting on his website &quot;The Great Replacement&quot;, the white supremacist manifesto of Australian Brenton Harrison Tarrant, the terrorist who killed 51 people and injured 50 more at Al Noor Mosque and Linwood Islamic Centre in Christchurch, New Zealand, in the Christchurch mosque shootings. Fromm described the manifesto as &quot;cogent&quot; and said violence was &quot;not the way to go, but our vile elites have made it all but inevitable.&quot;

==Opposition==
Fromm&#x27;s &quot;Alternative Forum&quot; meetings have been the targets of demonstrations, and have been disrupted and occasionally shut down by protesters.

On August 19, 2006, dozens of anti-fascist youths surrounded Fromm&#x27;s Port Credit, Ontario townhouse, challenging Fromm to come outside. Although he reportedly remained inside, approximately half a dozen neo-Nazis were present outside his home. Over 50 police officers were on call to protect Fromm and his supporters. The area was plastered in flyers advertising Fromm&#x27;s home address and far-right political affiliations. The protest ended without incident.

On his way to an April 19, 2007 Ontario College of Teachers hearing into his conduct, Fromm was involved in a scuffle with Jewish Defense League (JDL) members in an elevator. Protesters claimed that Fromm shoved them, but Fromm asserts that the JDL members lunged at him. Police arrested two protesters, charging them with assault, assaulting police, and obstructing.

In October 2007, the House of Commons of Canada unanimously passed a resolution banning Fromm and Alexan Kulbashian from the Parliament of Canada buildings after they attempted to hold a press conference in the parliamentary press theatre. The resolution read: &quot;That this House order that Alexan Kulbashian and Paul Fromm be denied admittance to the precincts of the House of Commons during the present session to preserve the dignity and integrity of the House&quot;.

In 2015, Fromm said in an interview posted on YouTube that he was denied entry into the United States by the Department of Homeland Security.

===Libel case===
Fromm and his Canadian Association for Free Expression were sued by Ottawa lawyer Richard Warman for libelling the anti-racist activist in various online posts. On November 23, 2007, Ontario Superior Court Justice Monique Métivier ruled in Warman&#x27;s favour, ordering Fromm to pay Warman a total of $30,000 in damages and to post full retractions on all the websites on which he posted the defamatory comments within 10 days. Métivier found that Fromm posted statements about Warman &quot;either knowing the fundamental falseness of the accusations he levelled at Mr. Warman, or being reckless as to the truth of these&quot;. Métivier added that &quot;The steady diet of diatribe and insults, couched in half-truths and omissions, all lead up to the finding of malice such that the defamatory statements are not protected by the defence of fair comment&quot;.

On December 15, 2008, the Ontario Court of Appeal upheld the original $30,000 defamation judgment against Fromm and added a $10,000 penalty in legal costs. Fromm posted a financial appeal complaining, &quot;We are $17,500 behind in our legal bills – to say nothing of the possible $40,000 debt, if this judgment stands&quot;. Richard Warman responded to news of the appeal court&#x27;s ruling by saying it &quot;sends the message that those who try to use the cloak of free speech to poison other people&#x27;s reputations through lies and defamation do so at their own peril&quot;.

The Supreme Court of Canada rejected Fromm&#x27;s application to appeal the judgement on April 23, 2009.

<doc id="1344871" wikidata="Q3337060" url="?curid=1344871" title="Holborn and St Pancras (UK Parliament constituency)">
<text>Holborn and St Pancras () is a parliamentary constituency in Greater London that was created in 1983. It has been represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom since 2015 by Sir Keir Starmer, the Prime Minister since 2024 and Leader of the Labour Party since 2020.

==Constituency profile==
The seat of Holborn and St Pancras as drawn in 2010 is composed of all but a small western portion of the London Borough of Camden and extends from most of Covent Garden and Bloomsbury in the heart of the West End of London through other areas of the NW1 postal district, north, and in elevation terms upwards through fashionable and economically diverse Camden Town to the affluent suburb of Highgate in a long strip. Gospel Oak, particularly towards Kentish Town, has high deprivation levels, but the neighbouring Highgate ward has low deprivation levels.

The southern part of the seat includes the University of London and several teaching hospitals, so the constituency has a large student population.

King&#x27;s Cross, St Pancras International, and Euston railway termini are in the seat.

During the 20th century, the Bloomsbury, Holborn, Covent Garden, and Highgate wards overwhelmingly elected Conservative councillors. Since 2000, the wards forming the seat in its three revised forms have all swung against the Conservative Party. The 2014 local government elections (for a standard four-year term) produced one Green Party councillor for the Highgate ward; the remaining 32 councillors whose wards fall within the seat (as redrawn in 2010) are members of the Labour Party.

===Political history===
Labour Party MPs have served this constituency since its creation in 1983. The majorities achieved have been varied, from a relatively marginal 13.9% in 2005 (making it within the lowest 150 seats for the party in that year by percentage of majority) to a landslide 51.7% in 2017. The 2015 result ranked the seat as the 77th safest of the party&#x27;s 232 seats (by percentage majority). Its predecessor seats have been in Labour hands for all but one term since 1945, and without interruption since 1964.

==Boundaries==
===Historic===
The seat was created in 1983 as a primary successor to Holborn and St Pancras South, which was created in 1950. The seat covers the southern half of the London Borough of Camden, including all or most of Camden Town, King&#x27;s Cross, Gospel Oak, Kentish Town and Bloomsbury.

The constituency has contained the following wards of the London Borough of Camden:
;1983–1997
Bloomsbury, Brunswick, Camden, Castlehaven, Caversham, Chalk Farm, Gospel Oak, Grafton, Holborn, King&#x27;s Cross, Regent&#x27;s Park, St John&#x27;s, St Pancras, and Somers Town.
;1997–2010
As above, less Gospel Oak

;2010–2024
Bloomsbury, Camden Town with Primrose Hill, Cantelowes, Gospel Oak, Haverstock, Highgate, Holborn and Covent Garden, Kentish Town, King&#x27;s Cross, Regent&#x27;s Park, and St Pancras and Somers Town. (Wards renamed and redrawn before 2010 election.)

The Fifth periodic review of Westminster constituencies by the Boundary Commission for England was implemented nationally in 2010. Parts of Highgate, Gospel Oak, Haverstock, and Camden Town with Primrose Hill wards were transferred from the former constituency of Hampstead and Highgate. The electorate of the new seat would have been 85,188 if it had existed in that form at the 2005 general election. The electorate has since risen further, and at the 2010 general election it had among the five largest electorates in London.

===Current===
Further to the 2023 review of Westminster constituencies, which came into effect for the 2024 general election, the constituency is composed of the following London Borough of Camden wards:

* Bloomsbury; Camden Square; Camden Town; Haverstock; Holborn and Covent Garden; Kentish Town North; Kentish Town South; King&#x27;s Cross; Primrose Hill (part); Regent&#x27;s Park; St. Pancras and Somers Town.

&quot;The contents reflect the local government boundary review for Camden which came into effect in May 2022. In order to bring the electorate within the permitted electoral range, the Highgate and Gospel Oak wards were transferred to the re-established constituency of Hampstead and Highgate.&quot;

==Members of Parliament==

The seat was held from 1983 to 2015 by Frank Dobson of the Labour Party, who had been elected in 1979 to the predecessor seat of Holborn &amp; St Pancras South. Dobson was the longest-serving Labour MP in London until he stood down in 2015. The constituency has been represented by Keir Starmer since the 2015 general election. Starmer has served as Leader of the Labour Party (consequently Leader of the Opposition until his 2024 election victory) since April 2020 and the Prime Minister since July 2024.

<text>Meggin Patricia Cabot (born February 1, 1967) is an American novelist. She has written and published over 50 novels of young adult and adult fiction and is best known for her young adult series &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot;, which was later adapted by Walt Disney Pictures into two feature films. Cabot has been the recipient of numerous book awards, including the New York Public Library Books for the Teen Age, the American Library Association Quick Pick for Reluctant Readers, the Tennessee Volunteer State TASL Book Award, the Book Sense Pick, the Evergreen Young Adult Book Award, the IRA/CBC Young Adult Choice, and many others. She has also had number-one &quot;New York Times&quot; bestsellers, and more than 25 million copies of her books are in print across the world.

== Early life and career ==
Meggin Patricia Cabot was born on February 1, 1967, in Bloomington, Indiana. After she graduated from Indiana University, Cabot moved to New York City, with the original aim of pursuing a career as an illustrator.

== Personal life ==
Meg Cabot married financial writer and poet, Benjamin D. Egnatz on April 1, 1993.

Her novel &quot;Every Boy&#x27;s Got One&quot; is loosely based on her elopement.

She has cats, Henrietta (a one-eyed cat) (1993-Jan 2013), and Gem, about whom she often blogs.

The second book was originally titled &quot;Phat Chick&quot;, but this was changed by the publishers to &quot;It&#x27;s Not Over Until The Size 12 Chick Sings&quot;, and finally, &quot;Size 14 is Not Fat Either&quot;, which continued Heather&#x27;s amateur sleuthing adventures.

The third book in the series is published under the title &quot;Size Doesn&#x27;t Matter&quot; in Australia and Great Britain.(In other countries, such as the U.S. and Canada, it was entitled &quot;Big Boned&quot;.)

Meena, however, hates vampires (she doesn&#x27;t believe in them, and doesn&#x27;t like how they always go after and kill girls). This complicates things when she finds out from Alaric Wulf, a demon-hunter with a secret unit of the Vatican called the Palatine Guard, that vampires are attacking girls all over her native New York City, and that her new boyfriend might be one of them: Lucien Antonescu, Dracula&#x27;s son, the Prince of Darkness.

In 2012, Meg&#x27;s short story &quot;Wooden Animal&quot; appeared in Significant Objects, an anthology that benefitted Girls Write Now.

And in 2011, Meg contributed the story &quot;The Protectionist&quot; to the anthology &quot;What You Wish For&quot;. One hundred percent of proceeds benefited the UN Refugee Agency, UNHCR, which builds libraries in Darfuri refugee camps in Chad.

All of Meg&#x27;s proceeds from her story &quot;The Exterminator&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, in the anthology &quot;Prom Nights From Hell&quot;, benefit First Book, a nonprofit organization connecting book publishers and community organizations to provide access to new books for children in need.

All of Meg&#x27;s proceeds from &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot;, Volume 4 1/2, Project Princess, go to benefit The Lower Eastside Girls Club of New York City. Editions sold to publishers in 10 countries outside the US benefited local charities in those countries.

All of Meg&#x27;s proceeds from the novel &quot;Ransom My Heart&quot; by Mia Thermopolis, Princess of Genovia (with help from Meg Cabot) go to benefit Greenpeace (Ransom My Heart is also printed on recycled paper). The proceeds from sales of Ransom My Heart to publishers in 8 countries have also gone to Mia&#x27;s favorite charity.

Meg&#x27;s story &quot;The Night Hunter&quot; was included in the anthology &quot;Fear: 13 Stories of Suspense&quot;. All author proceeds from this book benefit the Reading Is Fundamental literacy program for children.

In 2008, Meg contributed a story (&quot;Another All-American Girl&quot;) to the anthology &quot;Our White House: Looking In, Looking Out&quot; with all proceeds benefitting the National Children&#x27;s Book and Literacy Alliance.

Meg&#x27;s also written short stories for anthologies that have benefited the Teenage Cancer Trust, War Child, No Strings, Lisa Libraries, Kids Company, and the New York Public Libraries, among other organizations.

<doc id="1344889" wikidata="Q5095649" url="?curid=1344889" title="Chicago Hub Network">
<text>The Chicago Hub Network is a collection of proposed fast conventional and high-speed rail lines in the Midwestern United States including of track. Since the 1990s, there have been multiple proposals to build a network from Chicago to destinations such as Milwaukee, Madison, Minneapolis, Indianapolis, Detroit, Kansas City, St. Louis, Cleveland, Cincinnati, and Louisville. In addition, the rail lines from the Chicago hub would connect through to cities in Canada. Eastern routes from Chicago would also blend into the Ohio Hub network. In addition to providing better connections between Midwestern cities, the projects are intended to reduce or eliminate the operating subsidies that American passenger train routes currently require.

If implemented, the plans would have some of the nation&#x27;s fastest trains in Chicago, as it had in the 1930s and 1940s when the &quot;Twin Zephyrs&quot;, &quot;Twin Cities 400&quot;, and &quot;Hiawatha&quot; were based in the city. Chicago is North America&#x27;s largest rail hub, and remains unsurpassed in the total number of passenger and freight trains that converge on any city on the continent. Chicago is a major hub for Amtrak, with 15 different lines terminating at the city&#x27;s Union Station. Most existing passenger trains in the region operate at speeds of about , although a few travel faster. The various plans have suggested speeds ranging from for the core routes, as well as improved speeds for secondary routes.

In 2023, the Chicago–St. Louis rail line was upgraded so passenger trains are able to reach top speeds of when traveling between Joliet and Alton.

==Early studies and ISTEA corridors==
Renewed interest in high-speed rail occurred by the year 1990 when the Minnesota–Wisconsin–Illinois Tri-State Rail Study was underway. A Chicago–Milwaukee–Madison–La Crosse–Rochester–Twin Cities &quot;southern corridor&quot; (a variation of the former &quot;Hiawatha&quot; routing) and a Chicago–Milwaukee–Green Bay–Wausau–Eau Claire–Twin Cities &quot;northern corridor&quot; were described in a preliminary report in December of that year. A final report was released in May 1991 and recommended TGV-class service since it provided the greatest benefit to riders and others in the corridor, though a slower (and less expensive) &quot;Amtrak upgrade&quot; option was also deemed reasonable for capital-constrained investments.

The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) was passed on December 18, 1991, and requested designation of up to five corridors. A core of what would become the Chicago Hub Network was the first of these five to be announced by Secretary of Transportation Andrew Card on October 15, 1992, who designated Chicago-based routes to Milwaukee, St. Louis, and Detroit.

==Midwest Regional Rail Initiative==
In 2004, the Midwest Regional Rail Initiative plan was released, focusing on upgrading existing Amtrak routes. The plan had been in development since 1996, led by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation. Trains would travel at about on the primary routes, but on secondary lines. Existing trains run at speeds of about . Raising the speed would significantly reduce trip times. A trip between Milwaukee and Chicago would be reduced from about 90 minutes to just over an hour. The trip from the Twin Cities to Chicago would drop from 8 hours to 5½ hours. Travelers between Chicago and Cincinnati would see the biggest gains, cutting travel time in half to just 4 hours.

If implemented, planners would expect 13.6 million annual riders by the year 2025. The frequency of train trips would also be increased: areas that currently only see one train in each direction every day would be upgraded to four or six trips each way.

The total investment required for the system, paying for infrastructure as well as rolling stock, was estimated at $7.7 billion in 2002 dollars. $1.1 billion of that would go toward purchasing 63 new train sets. Plans at the time called for phased construction taking about a decade.

This plan is expected to use diesel-powered trains, which is one reason for the relatively low top speed in comparison to high-speed lines in Europe and elsewhere. The practical limit for diesel-powered train service is about . Higher speeds require electrification, which can double the cost of building a rail line, though trains on such lines benefit from higher efficiency leading to lower fuel costs, and the ability to accelerate and decelerate more rapidly which boosts rail line capacity.

==2009 Midwest High Speed Rail Association proposal==
For 2009, the Midwest High Speed Rail Association (MHSRA) and other organizations requested new studies of possible rail routes in the Midwest, this time with service as the goal. These routes were identified:

*Chicago–Milwaukee–Madison–Rochester–Minneapolis/St. Paul-St. Cloud-Fargo-Bismarck
*Chicago–Champaign–Springfield–St. Louis
*Chicago–Gary–Lafayette–Indianapolis–Cincinnati
**Cincinnati–Dayton–Columbus–Cleveland
*Chicago–Gary–Fort Wayne–Toledo–Detroit
*Chicago–Gary–Fort Wayne–Toledo–Cleveland-Erie-Buffalo
**Cleveland–Pittsburgh

The MHSRA funded a study of the link from Chicago to St. Louis, while the Southeast Minnesota Rail Alliance funded a study of the route to Minneapolis/St. Paul—the third in a series previously funded by the Illinois, Wisconsin, and Minnesota Departments of Transportation.

==2009 SNCF proposal==
In late 2009, the French national rail company SNCF released studies of several rail corridors in the United States in California, Florida, Texas, and the Midwest. France has a population distribution similar to that in the Midwest, so their experiences with TGV trains and other high-speed systems could conceivably be duplicated in the U.S. The following routes were identified for a first phase of implementation:

*Chicago–Milwaukee–Madison–Eau Claire–Minneapolis/St. Paul
*Chicago–Bloomington/Normal–Springfield–St. Louis
*Chicago–Gary–Lafayette–Indianapolis–Cincinnati
*Chicago–Gary–Fort Wayne–Toledo–Detroit
*Chicago–Gary–Fort Wayne–Toledo–Cleveland

These routes were designed to allow them to overlay the Midwest Regional Rail Initiative plan. Like the MHSRA plan, the SNCF core routes would operate at up to . The total cost was projected at $68.5 billion in 2009 dollars, with 54% of that projected to need public financing if a public-private partnership was pursued. The public funds could be recovered from revenues in about 15 years.

==Upgrades underway==
Some construction has begun in Illinois and Michigan, primarily as testbeds for the upgraded signaling and control systems required for higher-speed rail. In Michigan, this work has already resulted in speeds up to for Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Wolverine&quot; and &quot;Blue Water&quot; services. Similar work on the Chicago–Saint Louis line in Illinois was met with considerable technical difficulties in 2005, though work continued.

In September 2008, the federal government provided $297,000 to fund a study of the plan; Amtrak and state governments matched these funds for a total of $594,000. Planners anticipate 13.6 million riders over the entire network by the year 2025.

The Chicago to Milwaukee &quot;Hiawatha&quot; was planned to be expanded to Madison, Wisconsin, but the project was then nixed in 2011 by then Wisconsin governor Scott Walker. In 2009, the Spanish manufacturer Talgo had agreed to open a plant in Wisconsin in order to build 110-mph trains for the &quot;Hiawatha&quot; route and other improved corridors; however, due to the cancellation of construction in Wisconsin, Talgo has scaled back plans from a manufacturing plant to a maintenance facility, leading the City of Milwaukee to consider legal action against the state.

===American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009===
In 2009, the federal government allocated $8 billion in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to be divided up among rail projects around the country. States in the Midwest made 24 applications to the government, and on January 28, 2010, the White House announced that the Chicago network would receive money for three of its requests, and two other grants were made to Midwestern states. The Chicago-based routes receiving funding were:

*$1.131 billion for Chicago–St. Louis–Kansas City ($1.1 billion for Chicago–St. Louis, $31 million for St. Louis–Kansas City)
*$823 million for Chicago–Milwaukee–Madison–Minneapolis/St. Paul ($810 million for Milwaukee–Madison, $12 million for Chicago–Milwaukee, remaining $600,000 to study possible alignments to the Twin Cities.)
*$244 million for Chicago–Detroit–Pontiac

An additional $400 million was released for the 3C corridor in Ohio connecting Cleveland, Columbus, Dayton, and Cincinnati, and $17 million was allocated to Iowa. Many of the corridors receiving funding at this time were originally designated as high-speed rail corridors following the 1991 ISTEA legislation.

===2010===
In October 2010, the Chicago Hub received more money from the FY 2010 High Speed Rail Allocation. The major grants were:
*$230 million for Chicago–Quad Cities–Iowa City
*$161 million for Chicago–Detroit–Pontiac

Following the 2010 gubernatorial elections in Wisconsin and Ohio, both newly elected governors repeated their intentions of shutting down the projects in these two states and returning the money to the federal government. Following the return of funds, the federal government redirected the $145 million intended for Wisconsin and Ohio to the State of Washington&#x27;s high-speed rail corridor, and to Connecticut to modernize the New Haven-Springfield Line.

===Chicago-St. Louis rail line upgrades===
Before the upgrades, Amtrak passenger trains had a top speed of 79 MPH on the line between Chicago and St. Louis, and freight trains had a top speed of 60 MPH. In the fall of 2012, the section of the Chicago-St. Louis line between Pontiac, Illinois, and Dwight, Illinois, began Amtrak service at 110 MPH, as a demonstration section. In 2014 construction began to upgrade the entire rail line between Carlinville, Illinois, and Joliet, Illinois, so that Amtrak could run its passenger trains at 110 MPH. In addition, freight trains will be able to operate at 70 MPH.

The entire cost of the high-speed rail program was estimated at $1.8 billion, with the federal government committing $1.6 billion of that, later lowered to $1.4 billion. It is estimated that $1.2 billion will be spent on the program by the end of 2016.

On December 20, 2021, Amtrak train speeds were upgraded to between Chicago and St Louis. This reduced travel time by 15 minutes between the two cities. Final approval for speeds was granted in May 2023, and higher-speed rail service began on Wednesday, May 3, 2023, saving passengers an additional 45 minutes in travel time.

<text>The Love of a Good Woman is a collection of short stories by Canadian writer Alice Munro, published by McClelland and Stewart in 1998.

The eight stories of this collection (one of which was originally published in &quot;Saturday Night&quot;; five others were originally published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;) deal with Munro&#x27;s typical themes: secrets, love, betrayal, and the stuff of ordinary lives.

The book was awarded the 1998 Giller Prize, and was one of the selected books in the 2004 edition of &quot;Canada Reads&quot;, where it was championed by soprano Measha Brueggergosman. It also won the 1998 National Book Critics Circle Award for fiction.

<text>Meissa , designated Lambda Orionis (λ Orionis, abbreviated Lambda Ori, λ Ori) is a star in the constellation of Orion. It is a multiple star approximately away with a combined apparent magnitude of 3.33. The main components are an O8 giant star and a B-class main sequence star, separated by about 4″. Despite Meissa being more luminous and only slightly further away than Rigel, it appears 3 magnitudes dimmer at visual wavelengths, with much of its radiation emitted in the ultraviolet due to its high temperature.

==Nomenclature==

&quot;Lambda Orionis&quot; is the star&#x27;s Bayer designation. The traditional name &quot;Meissa&quot; derives from the Arabic &quot;Al-Maisan&quot; which means &#x27;The Shining One&#x27;. &quot;Al-Maisan&quot; was originally used for Gamma Geminorum, but was mistakenly applied to Lambda Orionis and the name stuck. In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN&#x27;s first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included &quot;Meissa&quot; for this star. It is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names.

The original Arabic name for this star, &quot;Al Hakah&quot; (the source for another name for it, &quot;Heka&quot;) refers to the Arabic lunar mansion that includes this star and the two of Phi Orionis (&quot;Al Haḳʽah&quot;, &#x27;a White Spot&#x27;). In Chinese, (), meaning &quot;Turtle Beak&quot;, refers to an asterism consisting of Meissa and both of Phi Orionis Consequently, the Chinese name for Meissa itself is (, .)

==Properties==
Meissa is a giant star with a stellar classification of O8 III and an apparent visible magnitude 3.54. It is an enormous star with about 34 times the mass of the Sun and 10 times the Sun&#x27;s radius. The outer atmosphere has an effective temperature of around 35,000 K, giving it the characteristic blue glow of a hot O-type star. Meissa is a soft X-ray source with a luminosity of 1032 erg s−1 and peak emission in the energy range of 0.2–0.3 keV, which suggests the X-rays are probably being generated by the stellar wind. The stellar wind of Meissa is well characterized by a mass-loss rate of solar masses per year and a terminal velocity of .

Meissa is actually a double star with a companion at an angular separation of 4.41 arcseconds along a position angle of 43.12° (as of 1937). This fainter component is of magnitude 5.61 and it has a stellar classification of B0.5 V, making it a B-type main sequence star. There is an outlying component, Meissa C, which is an F-type main sequence star with a classification of F8 V. This star in turn may have a very low mass companion that is probably a brown dwarf.

In 2018, a companion was detected around Meissa A, with a project separation of 10.13 mas. However, it was not detected again.

==Ring==

Meissa is surrounded by a ring of nebulosity about 12 degrees across. It is thought to be the remains of a supernova explosion, now ionized by the ultraviolet radiation from Meissa itself and some of the surrounding hot stars.

==Cluster==
This star is the dominant member of a 5-million-year-old star-forming region known as the λ Orionis cluster, or Collinder 69. The intense ultraviolet energy being radiated by this star is creating the Sh2-264 H II region in the neighboring volume of space, which in turn is surrounded by an expanding ring of cool gas that has an age of about 2–6 million years. The expansion of this gaseous ring may be explained by a former binary companion of Meissa that became a Type II supernova. Such an event would also explain the star&#x27;s peculiar velocity with respect to the center of the expanding ring, as the explosion and resulting mass loss could have kicked Meissa out of the system. A potential candidate for the supernova remnant is the neutron star Geminga. However, the last is unlikely given the distance between Geminga and the cluster.

<text>All American Girl is a young adult novel written by Meg Cabot. It reached number one in &quot;The New York Times Bestseller List&quot; for children&#x27;s books in 2002.

A sequel titled, &quot;Ready or Not&quot; was released in 2005. Meg Cabot also wrote a short story, &quot;Another All-American Girl&quot; included in &quot;Our White House: Looking In, Looking Out&quot;.

==Plot summary==
Samantha Madison lives in Washington, D.C and is a sophomore at John Adams Preparatory School. An outcast, she has only one friend, Catherine. Sam is a huge fan of Gwen Stefani and often laments that she is not more like Gwen, though she is against most other aspects of popular culture and dyes her entire wardrobe black because she is &quot;mourning for her generation.&quot; A middle child, Sam often feels inferior because her older sister, Lucy, is a cheerleader, and therefore one of the most popular girls in school, and her younger sister, Rebecca, is so intelligent that she takes college-level classes at a school for gifted kids. Sam is very different from her traditional parents—her father is an international economist at the World Bank and her mother is an environmental lawyer. Sam also believes she is in love with Lucy&#x27;s boyfriend Jack. Jack is the complete social opposite of big sister Lucy, having an artistic yet rebellious attitude to life and claiming that teenagers need to &quot;fight the system&quot;.

Sam is an aspiring artist and draws celebrity portraits during her German class, which she has a C− in. Her sister Lucy finds out and shows them to the family at dinner. As a punishment, her parents decide to enroll her in bi-weekly art classes at local artist Susan Boone&#x27;s studio. Sam goes to her first class where she is reprimanded by Boone for drawing what she knows and not what she sees. Offended, Sam decides to skip the next class choosing to occupy her time at the nearby Capitol Cookies and Static (a record store). While she is waiting for her housekeeper to pick up from art class, she notices a man she saw earlier at Static who was listening to Billy Joel&#x27;s &quot;Uptown Girl&quot;. The man turns out to be an assassin and as he takes a gun to shoot the President who is exiting Capitol Cookies, Sam jumps on him and causes him to misfire. She breaks her arm in the process as the man falls on top of her when she jumps on him.

In the aftermath, Sam becomes a celebrity and is declared a national hero. She is also appointed Teen Ambassador to the United Nations. She is no longer a social outcast and becomes popular at school, where she receives numerous social invitations and even gets sucked up to by Kris Parks, her nemesis. When she meets the President, she also meets his son who turns out to be David from her art class at Susan Boone&#x27;s. As she gets closer to David, she deals with her conflicting feelings for Jack—who she thought was her soulmate—and the President&#x27;s son.

He served as Mayor of Brandon from 1989 to 1997, was a member of the House of Commons of Canada from 1997 to 2004, and was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba in 2007. Borotsik is a member of the Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba.

==Early life and career==
Borotsik was born to a Ukrainian Canadian family in Brandon, was raised in that city, and graduated from Brandon University in 1971. He was elected to the Brandon City Council in 1977 and served for three terms before standing down in 1985.

He joined the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada in 1978. Borotsik sought the provincial PC nomination to run in Brandon West in the buildup to the 1986 provincial election, but lost to Jim McCrae.

Borotsik was an employee of the shopping centre firm Bramalea Limited during the 1980s. He was transferred from Brandon to Calgary in 1985, and again to the firm&#x27;s head office in Toronto one year later. He remained the city for three years, and became director of 32 centres. Finding it difficult to adjust to life in Toronto, he returned to Brandon in 1989. He ran for mayor in that year&#x27;s municipal election, and won an upset victory over four-term incumbent Ken Burgess.

==Mayor of Brandon==
A colourful and bombastic figure, Borotsik was elected on a platform of aggressive municipal development and became known for his efforts to promote the city. He brought the Canada Games and the World Curling Championships to Brandon, and presided over a period of significant agribusiness expansion. He was also given credit for saving the city&#x27;s airport.

He supported the introduction of Video Lottery Terminals into Brandon, and pressured the provincial government to turn over VLT revenues to the municipalities. He also called for a casino to be set up in the city, and endorsed unrestricted Sunday shopping. In 1992, he supported the Charlottetown Accord on constitutional reform.

==Member of Parliament==
;First term (1997–2000)
Borotsik sought and won the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada&#x27;s nomination for Brandon—Souris in the 1997 federal election. The party had been reduced to only two seats in the previous election, and was trying to rebuild its support base. Borotsik was a strong supporter of party leader Jean Charest, and was considered a star candidate. He indicated that he opposed the ideology of the rival Reform Party of Canada, a party further right than the old PCs, which he described as a &quot;flash-in-the-pan regional party&quot; with no national perspective. He was narrowly elected over the Reform candidate, while pushing Liberal incumbent Glen McKinnon into third place.

The Liberals, led by Prime Minister Jean Chrétien, were re-elected to a second consecutive majority government in the 1997 election, while the Progressive Conservatives won twenty seats for a fifth-place finish. Borotsik was his party&#x27;s only elected representative from western Canada. He served successively as critic for agriculture, the Canadian Wheat Board and western economic diversification, and had unofficial duties for the western provinces.

Charest resigned as party leader in 1998, despite requests from Borotsik and other MPs that he remain in the position. Borotsik was subsequently chosen as national caucus chairman, and endorsed former prime minister Joe Clark&#x27;s successful bid to succeed Charest as leader. Borotsik was also an opponent of the United Alternative, a Reform-sponsored drive for a new political party that resulted in the creation of the Canadian Alliance.

Borotsik opposed the Canadian gun registry, which he described as unworkable. He endorsed a 1998 bill that reversed Louis Riel&#x27;s conviction for treason, and recognized him as a Father of Confederation. Later, he broke with his party&#x27;s official position to support the Chrétien government&#x27;s Clarity Bill. There was speculation that Borotsik would seek the leadership of the Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba in 2000, but he declined.

;Second term (2000–04)
Borotsik was narrowly re-elected in the 2000 federal election over a candidate of the Canadian Alliance, as the Liberals won a third consecutive majority government nationally. The Progressive Conservatives fell to twelve seats and remained the fifth-largest party in parliament, narrowly avoiding the loss of official party status that some had feared. Borotsik was subsequently named as party whip and Critic for Agriculture, Indian Affairs and the Canadian Wheat Board.

Borotsik took part in preliminary discussions between the Progressive Conservatives and the Canadian Alliance in early 2001. He said that a &quot;mutual compromise&quot; would have to be reached before the next election to prevent the Liberals from remaining in power. No agreements were reached, and Borotsik later called for disgruntled Canadian Alliance members to rejoin the Progressive Conservative Party.

Clark resigned as Progressive Conservative leader in mid-2002. There were rumours that Borotsik would run to succeed him, but he declined and endorsed Jim Prentice, a lawyer from Calgary who had not held elected office to that point. Prentice lost to Peter MacKay on the final ballot of the party&#x27;s 2003 leadership convention; Borotsik resigned as party whip, but remained Agriculture Critic.

During this period, Borotsik surprised some political observers by declaring his support for the legalization of same-sex marriage. He also endorsed the principles of public health care and employment insurance, and became associated with the Red Tory wing of his party.

MacKay and Canadian Alliance leader Stephen Harper announced plans to merge their parties in late 2003. Borotsik strongly opposed this decision, and said that he would not be a candidate for the merged party if Stephen Harper was chosen as its leader. He openly considered joining the Liberals once the merger was finalized, and was on hand to provide &quot;moral support&quot; for Progressive Conservative MP Scott Brison when he announced his own defection to the Liberal Party.

Borotsik ultimately chose to sit with the merged Conservative Party of Canada until the next election, but made no secret of his opposition to Stephen Harper and the new party&#x27;s social conservatism. He turned down an offer to become Agriculture Critic in Harper&#x27;s shadow cabinet, and did not stand in the 2004 campaign. Just before election day, he publicly endorsed the Liberals. Borotsik supported Belinda Stronach&#x27;s decision to leave the Conservatives for the Liberals in 2005, and indicated that he would consider running for either the Liberal Party of Canada or the Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba at some time in the future.

==Member of the provincial legislature==
Stuart Murray announced his resignation as leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba in 2005. Some considered Borotsik as a possible replacement, but he quickly ruled himself out as a candidate. In June 2006, however, he announced that he would run for the party in the next provincial campaign.

He was narrowly elected in the 2007 election, defeating New Democratic Party cabinet minister Scott Smith by 56 votes in Brandon West. Borotsik provoked some controversy when he announced that he favoured an end to Manitoba&#x27;s tuition freeze; the party&#x27;s official policy was to keep the freeze in place.

The New Democratic Party was re-elected to a third consecutive majority government in the 2007 election, and Borotsik entered the legislature as a member of the Official Opposition. In September 2007, party leader Hugh McFadyen appointed him to the high-profile position of Finance Critic. Later in the year, he described Manitoba&#x27;s increasing debt as an economic danger signal.

Borotsik was not a candidate in the 2011 Manitoba general election.

==Electoral record==



Note: Reports in the &quot;Winnipeg Free Press&quot; newspaper do not indicate if Borotsik was elected in Ward Three or Ward Four in the 1980 Brandon election. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, this article assumes the former.

<text>Arthur Middleton Young (November 3, 1905 – May 30, 1995) was an American inventor, helicopter pioneer, philosopher, astrologer, and author. Young was the designer of Bell Helicopter&#x27;s first helicopter, the Model 30, and inventor of the stabilizer bar used on many of Bell&#x27;s early helicopter designs. He founded the &quot;Institute for the Study of Consciousness&quot; in Berkeley in 1972. Young advocated process philosophy, an attempt to integrate the realm of human thought and experience with the realm of science so that the concept of universe is not limited to that which can be physically measured. Young&#x27;s theory embraces evolution and the concept of the great chain of being. He has influenced such thinkers as Stanislav Grof and Laban Coblentz.

==Biography==
Arthur was the son of Eliza Coxe and Philadelphia landscape painter Charles Morris Young. He was interested in developing a comprehensive theory of reality from an early age. He felt that to acquire the intellectual tools needed for such rigorous study, he should first develop an understanding of mathematics and engineering. With this decision he was following a career path similar to that of philosopher Alfred North Whitehead, who was a mathematician before he developed the first process philosophy. Thus after graduation from Princeton University in 1927 Young searched for a suitable invention to develop. In 1928 he returned to his father&#x27;s farm in Radnor, Pennsylvania, to begin twelve solitary years of efforts to develop the helicopter into a useful device.

Young&#x27;s private experiments with helicopter design had mostly involved small scale models. After twelve years on his own using the models, he took his results and models to the Bell Aircraft Company in Buffalo, New York, in 1941, and the company agreed to build full-scale prototypes. While war was looming for the US in late 1941 he was issued the key rotor stabilizer bar (also known as a flybar) patent, assigned it to Bell and moved to Buffalo to work with them. In June 1942 he moved his five-person team to Gardenville, New York, a hamlet on the north border of West Seneca, New York, where they could work in relative secrecy. The first test flight of the prototype Model 30 occurred in July 1943, and on March 8, 1946, the company received Helicopter Type Certificate H-1 for the world&#x27;s first commercial helicopter, the Bell Model 47. This was the &quot;whirlybird&quot; featured in the &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; movie and television series and was so successful that it continued to be manufactured through 1974. A design as well as a utilitarian success, it was added to the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art of New York City in 1984.

Young had become profoundly disturbed by the development of nuclear weapons at the end of the Second World War and decided that humanity needed a new philosophical paradigm.

In August 1946 Young recorded in his notes the idea of the &quot;psychopter&quot; – the helicopter as the &quot;winged self&quot;, a metaphor for the human spirit. By October 1947 Young felt his work at Bell was complete, and he turned to the next phase of his career as a philosopher of mind (or soul). In 1949, the Franklin Institute awarded him the Edward Longstreth Medal. In 1952, Young and his wife Ruth organized the Foundation for the Study of Consciousness in Philadelphia, the forerunner of the Institute for the Study of Consciousness.

Also in 1952, Young and Ruth participated in seances conducted by Andrija Puharich&#x27;s Roundtable Foundation.

===Marriages===

Young married Priscilla Page in 1933. He was divorced from Priscilla in 1948, and later that year, married artist Ruth Forbes Paine (1903–1998) of the Boston Forbes family, a great-granddaughter of Ralph Waldo Emerson and the mother of Michael Paine. Ruth Forbes was formerly married to George Lyman Paine Jr. Their son Michael Paine married Ruth Hyde Paine, a friend of Lee Harvey Oswald&#x27;s wife Marina, who was living with her at the time of the JFK assassination.

===Death===

On 30 May 1995, Arthur Young died of cancer at age 89, at his home in Berkeley, California.

<text>Panipuri or golgappa is a deep-fried breaded hollow spherical shell, about in diameter, filled with a combination of potatoes, raw onions, chickpeas and spices. It is a common snack and street food in the Indian subcontinent. It is often flavoured with chili powder, chaat masala, herbs and many other spices.

== Names ==
Panipuri has many regional names in the Indian subcontinent: Maharashtra and South India: panipuri; Haryana: pani-patashi; Madhya Pradesh: fulki; Uttar Pradesh: pani-ke-batashe/padake; Assam: phuska/puska; Gujarat: pakodi; Odisha: gup-chup; Delhi: golgappa/phuchka; Bengal: phuchka and Bihar: jalpooree/phuchka.

== History ==
According to culinary anthropologist Kurush Dalal, chaat originated in the North Indian region of what is now Bihar. The origins of golgappa trace back to India. He also noted that it possibly originated from Raj-Kachori: an accidentally-made smaller puri giving birth to panipuri. Panipuri spread to the rest of India mainly due to the migration of people from one part of the country to another in the 20th century.

On 10 March 2005, the word &quot;panipuri&quot; was added to the Oxford English Dictionary.

== Evolution over time ==

Pani puri has evolved significantly over time. Also known as &quot;golgappa,&quot; the dish consists of a small, hollow, fried wheat and/or semolina shell filled with spiced mashed potatoes and served with either a green or a brown-coloured dipping water; or both. This &quot;water&quot; is technically a diluted chutney. Over time, variations of the filling and the flavoured water emerged, reflecting the regional preferences and availability of ingredients. The flavoured water, also known as the &quot;pani,&quot; is an essential component of the dish and is often the main source of flavour. 

The brown water is known throughout India as &quot;khatta meetha pani&quot;, which translates to as &quot;sweet and sour water&quot;. The main composition of this water is tamarind and jaggery. The hotter alternative to this water, which is also typically the standard dipping green liquid for this dish, is known as &quot;theeka pani&quot;, which means &quot;spicy water&quot;. It consists of herbs like mint and coriander along with green chillies. Both waters can include a garnishing of boondi, a concoction made of fried chickpea flour. Some regional variations also use sweet flavours like fruit juices or dates, as well as many optional toppings like sev.

Bangarapet panipuri is renowned for its distinctive white-colored pani, retaining a spicy kick that has been traditionally handed down through generations.

<text>Ronsdorf is a district of the German city of Wuppertal. It has a population of about 22,500. Ronsdorf was first mentioned in 1494, and in 1745 it received its town charter. It was founded only a few years before by Elias Eller when he relocated the Zionites there from Elberfeld. Ronsdorf was made a part of Wuppertal in 1929. 

Ronsdorf consists, in addition to the town Ronsdorf, of the villages of Heidt, Erbschlö, Holthausen, Blombach, Linde, Marscheid, Großsporkert, Kleinsporkert and Kleinbeek.

As with other districts of Wuppertal, Ronsdorf was heavily destroyed during the allied bombings of World War II on the night of May 29, 1943. Therefore only a few old buildings (like the typical black and white timber-framed &quot;Bergisches Haus&quot;) remain today.

==Regular events==
The &quot;Liefersack&quot; is a bi-annual festival (odd years), organised by local clubs and businesses. The main purpose is to collect money for charity. 

In the even years, the &quot;Ronsdorfer Bürgerfest&quot; takes place, which has the character of a fair.

<doc id="1344923" wikidata="Q3138197" url="?curid=1344923" title="Islington South and Finsbury (UK Parliament constituency)">
<text>Islington South and Finsbury is a constituency created in 1974 and represented in the House of Commons of the UK Parliament since 2005 by Emily Thornberry of the Labour Party. Thornberry served as Shadow Foreign Secretary from 2016 until 2020 and as Shadow Attorney General for England and Wales from 2021 to 2024.

==Constituency profile==

This densely populated seat covers Barnsbury, part of Highbury, Islington proper, and Clerkenwell and Finsbury adjoining the City. It contains many desirable apartments and townhouses as well as 20th century social housing developments.

The borough constituency has been described as &quot;the natural habitat of the hypocritical, well-off, ostensibly liberal chattering classes&quot; including higher earners, leaders in the public sector, critics, entertainers, writers and former Prime Ministers Tony Blair and Boris Johnson. Despite this reputation for liberal affluence there is also significant deprivation in the constituency and its neighbour Islington North.

==Boundaries==
The seat covers the southern part of the London Borough of Islington, including Barnsbury, Canonbury, major parts of Holloway, Kings Cross and the former area of the Metropolitan Borough of Finsbury, which includes Bunhill, Pentonville and Clerkenwell. From 2024, it also includes the De Beauvoir Town neighbourhood in the Borough of Hackney.

1974–1983: The London Borough of Islington wards of Barnsbury, Bunhill, Clerkenwell, Pentonville, St Mary, St Peter, and Thornhill.

1983–2010: As above, save that Pentonville was abolished and Canonbury East, Canonbury West, Hillmarton, Holloway were created or added to the seat.

2010–2024: The London Borough of Islington wards of Barnsbury, Bunhill, Caledonian, Canonbury, Clerkenwell, Holloway, St Mary&#x27;s and St Peter&#x27;s.

2024–present: The London Borough of Hackney ward of De Beauvoir, and the London Borough of Islington wards of Barnsbury, Bunhill, Caledonian, Canonbury, Clerkenwell, Holloway, Laycock, St Mary&#x27;s &amp; St James&#x27;, and St Peter&#x27;s &amp; Canalside.
:&quot;Expanded to bring its electorate within the permitted range by adding the Borough of Hackney ward of De Beauvoir. The area within the Borough of Islington was unchanged, but following a review of local authority ward boundaries which came into effect on 4 May 2022, some of the ward names have been modified.&quot;

==History==
Islington South and Finsbury was created in 1974 from part of the former Islington South West and Shoreditch and Finsbury constituencies. In 1983, its boundaries changed when the Islington Central constituency was abolished and its area split between Islington South and Finsbury and Islington North.

Islington was an early stronghold for the SDP. All three sitting Labour MPs defected to the party together with a majority of the borough council. This was at the time when the Labour Party voted for in Conference leaving the EEC (Common Market) and abolishing nuclear weapons during the Cold War which largely triggered the split. However, in spite of their less radical position than the Labour Party, they won only one seat to Labour&#x27;s 59 in the 1982 Islington Council elections and at the 1983 general election, Labour managed to narrowly retain the seat. The new MP, Chris Smith was the first MP to come out as gay and was aligned with the Labour left, and retained the seat with a slight increase in his majority in 1987. By 1992, the post-merged SDP, the Liberal Democrats, had faded locally, and no longer had the former MP as a candidate, and Smith managed to win a majority exceeding 10,000 votes.

The Liberal Democrat revival in local elections in Islington, which saw them take control of the council in 2000, began to cross over to Parliamentary elections in 2001. In 2002, the Liberal Democrats won every council seat in Islington South and Finsbury, and Smith&#x27;s subsequent retirement and the resultant loss of incumbency made the constituency vulnerable once again in 2005. However Smith&#x27;s successor, Emily Thornberry, retained the seat with a narrow majority of 484 votes over the Liberal Democrat challenger, Barnsbury councillor Bridget Fox. — the seat therefore became one of the ten most marginal in Britain. However, in the local council elections a year later, Labour made an almost full recovery locally and won a majority of the seats in Islington South and Finsbury, defeating both Bridget Fox and the-then council leader Steve Hitchins. At the 2010 general election, Thornberry increased her majority over Fox. In 2014 the Liberal Democrats lost all their remaining seats on the council. The 2015 general election result made the seat the 93rd safest of Labour&#x27;s 232 seats by percentage of majority.

<doc id="1344930" wikidata="Q1077552" url="?curid=1344930" title="Islington North (UK Parliament constituency)">
<text>Islington North ( ) is a constituency in Greater London established for the 1885 general election. It has been represented in the House of Commons of the UK Parliament since 1983 by Jeremy Corbyn, who was Leader of the Labour Party and Leader of the Opposition from 2015 to 2020. Since 2020, Corbyn has represented the seat as an independent. He was re-elected to Islington North as an independent in the 2024 general election.

It is the smallest constituency by area, covering 7.38 square kilometres.

==Constituency profile==
The seat includes the densely populated and multicultural neighbourhoods of Finsbury Park, Highbury, Canonbury, Archway, Tufnell Park and the northern part of Holloway. Electoral Calculus categorises the seat as being part of the “Strong Left” demographic, those who have very economically left wing and socially liberal views, and have an internationalist outlook including strong opposition to Brexit: only 21.6% of Islington North voted for Brexit in 2016, indicating that it is a heavily pro-Remain area.

Despite high incomes and house prices, around 52% of the constituency is deprived, in terms of employment, income and education, mirroring the national average. The average age is 42.5, at least 36% of the local population owns a car, whilst 31% own a home, which are both considerably low in comparison to the rest of the UK, and the gross household income is £52,102. Arsenal Football Club is located in the seat.

== Boundaries ==

=== 1885–1918 ===

The seat was created by the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885, as one of four divisions of the new parliamentary borough of Islington. The constituency was defined in the legislation as consisting of the single ward of Upper Holloway of the parish of Islington. The ward was one of eight used in the election of Islington vestrymen under the Metropolis Management Act 1855.

=== 1918–1950 ===
Under the next redistribution of seats by the Representation of the People Act 1918 constituencies in the County of London were defined in terms of wards of the metropolitan boroughs created in 1900. Islington North comprised three wards of the Metropolitan Borough of Islington: Tollington, Tufnell and Upper Holloway.

=== 1950–1974 ===
 At the next redistribution of seats by the Representation of the People Act 1948 the constituency was again defined as Tollington, Tufnell and Upper Holloway wards of the Metropolitan Borough of Islington, with boundaries as they existed at the end of 1947.

=== 1974–1983 ===
In 1965 local government in Greater London was reorganised, with the formation of London boroughs. The changes were reflected in parliamentary boundaries from 1974. The London Borough of Islington was divided into three constituencies. Islington North was defined as comprising seven wards: Highview, Hillmarton, Hillrise, Junction, Parkway, St. George&#x27;s and Station.

=== 1983–1997 ===
In 1983 the parliamentary representation of Islington was reduced to two constituencies. The new, enlarged, Islington North was formed from ten wards of the borough as they existed in February 1983. These were Gillespie, Highbury, Highview, Hillrise, Junction, Mildmay, Quadrant, St. George&#x27;s, Sussex and Tollington wards.

=== 1997–2010 ===
In 1997 there were only slight boundary changes, with the constituency defined as the same ten wards with their boundaries as they existed on 1 June 1994.

=== Since 2010 ===
The seat, which is the smallest constituency in the UK by area, covers the northern half of the London Borough of Islington, which includes the areas of Holloway, Highbury, Tufnell Park, Upper Holloway and Archway.

From 2010 until 2022, the constituency comprised the following eight electoral wards: Finsbury Park, Highbury East, Highbury West, Hillrise, Junction, Mildmay, St. George&#x27;s and Tollington.

Following a review of local authority ward boundaries which came into effect on 4 May 2022, the seat now comprises the following eight London Borough of Islington wards: Arsenal; Finsbury Park; Highbury; Hillrise; Junction; Mildmay; Tollington; Tufnell Park.

The boundaries of the constituency were not changed as part of the 2023 Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies.

These boundaries have been considerably changed since 1970, when Islington returned three MPs and shared another with Hackney. This reflects the depopulation of central London on a lowering of adult occupancy of households and the local authority has replaced tower blocks. The core of the constituency was the area north of Seven Sisters Road and Camden Road. At , it is the smallest UK Parliamentary constituency. At the Fifth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies begun in 2012 the seat was approximately 1,300 electors below the electoral quota and the highest concentration of elector density nationally. The criteria of successive reviews emphasise equal electorates as well as restricting seats to one or, if unavoidable, two local authority areas.

==Political history==
The constituency was held by the Labour Party without interruption from a by-election in 1937 until former Labour member and leader Jeremy Corbyn won it as an independent in 2024. From 1945 to 2019, Labour&#x27;s smallest majority was 10.4% of the vote, in a by-election in 1969, on a very low turnout.

As a Labour candidate, Corbyn had his smallest majority (15.3%) in 1983, when he was first elected, and his largest (60.5%) in 2017, when he was leader of the party. In the ten elections since Corbyn began representing the constituency, the Conservatives have finished in second place five times while the Liberal Democrats have also been runners up on five occasions. The 2015 result made the seat the 26th safest of Labour&#x27;s 232 seats by percentage of majority.

In the 2016 referendum to leave the European Union, the constituency voted remain by 78.4%. This was the fifth highest support for remain for a constituency.

A short film was made about the 1969 by-election. This highlighted the importance of the local Irish community, the poor local housing conditions (the opening line talks of &quot;a crowded, crumbling constituency&quot;) and the relatively low turn-outs at previous elections. The film is now available through British Pathé Archive.

Michael O&#x27;Halloran, elected Labour MP for Islington North in 1969, was the subject of an investigation in the early-1970s by &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; newspaper. They highlighted his background with a local building company and the local Irish community and queried the tactics of his supporters during his selection as candidate.

O&#x27;Halloran defected to the SDP in September 1981, as did both of the other Islington MPs. However the Boundary Commission cut the number of constituencies in Islington from three to two. O&#x27;Halloran sought selection as the SDP candidate for the revised Islington North constituency but the local SDP association selected John Grant, then-SDP (elected as Labour) MP for Islington Central, as their official candidate. In February 1983, O&#x27;Halloran resigned his membership of the SDP and sat in Parliament as an &quot;Independent Labour&quot; member, supporting the Parliamentary Labour Party. Despite this, he failed to regain the Labour Party nomination for the 1983 general election and he was defeated by the new Labour candidate, Jeremy Corbyn, and finished in fourth place with 11.1% of the vote.

Corbyn defeated Paul Boateng for the Labour Party selection. Boateng subsequently became the first Black Cabinet Minister in the UK.

<doc id="1344949" wikidata="Q2746709" url="?curid=1344949" title="Trust (Elvis Costello album)">
<text>Trust is the fifth studio album by the English singer-songwriter Elvis Costello, and his fourth with the Attractions—keyboardist Steve Nieve, bassist Bruce Thomas and drummer Pete Thomas (no relation). It was released on 23January 1981 through F-Beat Records in the United Kingdom. Produced by Nick Lowe, with assistance by the engineer Roger Béchirian, the album was recorded in London from October to November 1980 between DJM and Eden Studios. The sessions were riddled with alcohol and drug issues and tensions were high between the band members. Squeeze&#x27;s vocalist Glenn Tilbrook and the Rumour&#x27;s guitarist Martin Belmont made guest appearances on &quot;From a Whisper to a Scream&quot;.

Envisioned by Costello as crossing the melody of &quot;Armed Forces&quot; (1979) with the rhythm of &quot;Get Happy!!&quot; (1980), &quot;Trust&quot; is a pop rock album that exhibits several musical styles, including jazz, rockabilly and country. The lyrics were partly inspired by events in Costello&#x27;s own life at the time, including the effects of being a touring musician and his failing marriage. The songs depict scenarios with a lack of trust and are filled with puns and double entendres. The cover artwork, in an ironic nod to the title, is a headshot of Costello appearing mistrustful.

&quot;Trust&quot; charted in the UK top ten and at number 28 in the US, while its singles performed poorly. It received positive reviews on release; critics highlighted the artist&#x27;s change in tone from his earlier records, a growing maturity in the lyrics and praised Costello as a musician; it appeared on several year-end lists. The album has retrospectively received acclaim as one of Costello&#x27;s best, and most underrated, works. Commentators have viewed the album as exhibiting an artist and band at their creative peaks. Costello himself was initially displeased with the album, but reversed his opinion in later years. It has been reissued multiple times with bonus tracks.

==Background and development==
Elvis Costello released his fourth studio album &quot;Get Happy!!&quot; in February 1980. A departure from the new wave sound of 1979&#x27;s &quot;Armed Forces&quot;, &quot;Get Happy!!&quot; took influences from the soul and R&amp;B sound of the 1960s and reached number two on the UK Albums Chart, although it sold fewer copies than &quot;Armed Forces&quot;. Throughout March 1980, Costello and his backing band the Attractions—keyboardist Steve Nieve, bassist Bruce Thomas and drummer Pete Thomas (no relation)—toured at smaller cities throughout the United Kingdom, although Costello suffered several moments of instability during the shows due to alcohol and drug abuse, including forgetting lyrics, freezing in place and poor vocals. The band were back on the road throughout Europe in mid-April, although a car accident left Nieve unable to join; his absence led to poorly received shows so he was temporarily replaced by the Rumour&#x27;s guitarist Martin Belmont.

In early 1980, Costello purchased a small grand piano, which would greatly influence his songwriting over the next year; it was on this instrument that he primarily wrote &quot;Shot With His Own Gun&quot;. Throughout the year, he began stockpiling a large number of songs he would record for his next album, including &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Be a Man&quot;, &quot;Lovers Walk&quot;, &quot;Clubland&quot;, &quot;New Lace Sleeves&quot;, &quot;Watch Your Step&quot; and &quot;From a Whisper to a Scream&quot;. Many of these songs were debuted during live performances in July and August. In his 2015 memoir, Costello states he had begun writing &quot;New Lace Sleeves&quot; and &quot;Watch Your Step&quot; when he was 20. Other songs that dated back to the mid-1970s included &quot;Different Finger&quot;, &quot;Luxembourg&quot; and a short instrumental titled &quot;Weeper&#x27;s Dream&quot;. Around this time he also struck a working relationship with fellow new wave band Squeeze and would collaborate with its members over the next several years; Costello&#x27;s manager Jake Riviera also began co-managing both artists.

==Recording==

Costello and the Attractions demoed material at London&#x27;s Eden Studios throughout September 1980 before commencing work in October at DJM Studios in Holborn, central London, with the team of Nick Lowe and Roger Béchirian returning from prior albums. These sessions were riddled with issues, with Costello stating that they were &quot;often frantic, swinging from elation to despair for which I must take most of the blame.&quot; Unlike previous albums, Lowe and Béchirian worked back and forth as producers, each taking charge of separate sessions. Their work ethics were different, which slowed progress. Similar to the sessions for &quot;Get Happy!!&quot;, the band was consistently intoxicated. Béchirian recalled: &quot;By that point, I think everybody was just fed up with seeing each other. There was a real sense of animosity, a cloud over the project. It was just a real struggle, because nobody seemed to care about it.&quot; The atmosphere at DJM was similarly problematic, as the studio was constructed for the &quot;tight, dry and muted&quot; sound of the early 1970s and was ill-suited to the expansive sound Costello wanted, although the group &quot;took advantage&quot; of the dry sound for &quot;New Lace Sleeves&quot; and &quot;Watch Your Step&quot;. According to Costello, the &quot;working method&quot; at DJM entailed being disenchanted upon playback of the previous day&#x27;s efforts, followed by getting intoxicated at the local pub, before coming back to record, after which the cycle would continue, although this method produced &quot;coherent&quot; performances in &quot;Shot With His Own Gun&quot;. In the liner notes for the 2003 reissue, Costello stated:

Like &quot;Get Happy!!&quot;, the band decided a different location would be better-suited and moved recording back to Eden, where they were more productive. Nieve exerted more control on the arrangements, so his piano and organ dominate the songs, particularly on &quot;Shot With His Own Gun&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Be a Man&quot; and &quot;Black Sails in the Sunset&quot;, as well as &quot;New Lace Sleeves&quot; and &quot;Watch Your Step&quot;. Costello also experimented with a soft croon, having done so on &quot;Get Happy!!&quot; &quot;Secondary Modern&quot;, but by this time, had developed into, in the biographer Graeme Thomson&#x27;s words, &quot;a silky, lascivious moan, at once amused and disgusted.&quot; At one point, Costello&#x27;s voice was shot so Squeeze vocalist Glenn Tilbrook offered to sing a guide vocal on &quot;From a Whisper to a Scream&quot;. Costello liked the performance so much he made it a duet. Belmont was also invited and added guitar to the same track. The band recorded for several days without Lowe while he was struck with flu; Costello felt the final version of &quot;Clubland&quot; lacked in his absence. During the final days, Costello also recorded a solo track, a re-working of &quot;Big Sister&quot; titled &quot;Big Sister&#x27;s Clothes&quot;, which featured melodica, skin tambourine, vibraphone, timpani, as well as &quot;backwards accordion&quot;. Production for the track was credited to Costello alone. The sleeve credits the production to Lowe &quot;in association with&quot; Béchirian &quot;assisted by&quot; Neill King.

The new album was finished by early November 1980. According to Béchirian, the atmosphere remained fraught throughout: &quot;I remember when we were mixing there were fights. Bruce Thomas walking out of the control room, leaving the band and Jake chasing after him. The whole thing was mental.&quot; Costello later concurred that despite these tensions, he felt the final album contained some of the Attractions&#x27; best performances, naming &quot;Strict Time&quot;, &quot;Lovers Walk&quot;, &quot;White Knuckles&quot;, and &quot;New Lace Sleeves&quot;. &quot;Trust&quot; was chosen as the title over working titles &quot;Looking Italian&quot; and &quot;Cats and Dogs&quot;.

==Music and lyrics==

Costello&#x27;s original intent for &quot;Trust&quot; was to cross the melody of &quot;Armed Forces&quot; with the rhythm of &quot;Get Happy!!&quot;. The author Mick St. Michael states that he took the best elements of previous albums for &quot;Trust&quot;: the &quot;lyrical zest&quot; of &quot;My Aim Is True&quot; (1977), the &quot;energy&quot; of &quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot; (1978) and the &quot;commerciality&quot; of &quot;Armed Forces&quot;. As such, &quot;Trust&quot; displays a wide variety of musical styles. An overall pop rock album, genres exhibited on &quot;Trust&quot; range from jazz (&quot;Clubland&quot;), soul pop (&quot;Watch Your Step&quot;), rockabilly (&quot;Luxembourg&quot;), Tin Pan Alley-style pop (&quot;Shot with His Own Gun&quot;) and country (&quot;Different Finger&quot;). AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine also notes the &quot;more complex arrangements and musicianship&quot; that accompany &quot;White Knuckles&quot; and &quot;New Lace Sleeves&quot;.

Despite having previously expressed a desire to distance himself from the pop music mainstream, Costello revealed that a number of songs on the album were influenced by other contemporary artists. &quot;Clubland&quot; incorporated the guitar style of the Police, &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Be a Man&quot; borrowed from the Pretenders, &quot;White Knuckles&quot; was modelled on XTC records, and &quot;Fish &#x27;n&#x27; Chip Paper&quot; was an homage to Squeeze. &quot;Lovers Walk&quot; featured a Bo Diddley-type beat while &quot;Big Sister&#x27;s Clothes&quot; had a bass line based on work by the Clash. Additionally, Costello&#x27;s newfound appreciation for songwriters such as Cole Porter, Rodgers and Hart and Sammy Caine, singers such as Frank Sinatra, and his own father Ross McManus – a singer and trumpeter – would influence the writing of &quot;Trust&quot;.

Costello describes the album&#x27;s lyrics as depicting a world with a lack of trust. Partly taking influences from events in his own life at the time, including the effects of being a touring musician, the songs delve into politics (&quot;Clubland&quot;, &quot;Big Sister&#x27;s Clothes&quot;, &quot;Pretty Words&quot;), ennui (&quot;Watch Your Step&quot;, &quot;Strict Time&quot;) and the slow disintegration of personal relationships (&quot;Lovers Walk&quot;, &quot;Different Finger&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Be a Man&quot;). Costello later recalled that his failing marriage was reflected in &quot;Different Finger&quot;, &quot;Lovers Walk&quot;, &quot;Shot With His Own Gun&quot;, the brutal portrait of &quot;White Knuckles&quot; and its companion song, &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Be a Man&quot;, while &quot;Clubland&quot;, &quot;Pretty Words&quot; and &quot;White Knuckles&quot; were influenced by the violence encountered on the Get Happy!! tour. &quot;Watch Your Step&quot; and &quot;Fish &#x27;n&#x27; Chip Paper&quot; both reference boxing fans, while the latter features a great distaste for the media. The biographer Brian Hinton later commented that the album concerned &quot;sour and rotten doings in different areas&quot;. Using his signature wordplay, Costello filled the songs with puns and double entendres. The narrators range from being observers and participants, to inflictors and the inflicted parties. The author James E. Perone summarises the album as an exploration in the betrayal of trust, either on or by the narrators.

===Side one===
The album&#x27;s first two songs, &quot;Clubland&quot; and &quot;Lovers Walk&quot;, lack first-person narrators and instead observe different individuals. In &quot;Clubland&quot;, Costello targets the people who frequent nightclubs, such as gangsters and drug addicts. The biographer David Gouldstone interprets the nightclubs as a metaphor for Britain in the 1980s and compares the setting to &quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot;, particularly &quot;Pump It Up&quot;. With a jazz-inspired piano line and James Bond-style electric guitar, Perone draws comparisons to Costello&#x27;s earlier single &quot;Watching the Detectives&quot; (1977). AllMusic&#x27;s Stewart Mason stated that its &quot;richly detailed&quot; arrangement presaged the &quot;ornate constructions&quot; of &quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot; (1982) and Costello&#x27;s other explorations into Baroque art pop. In &quot;Lovers Walk&quot;, Costello expresses his suspicions of love as a concept and the narrator&#x27;s hesitation about falling in love, with Perone singling out the lyric &quot;making promises that they can&#x27;t keep&quot; as a perfect summary. Like Costello&#x27;s &quot;Girls Talk&quot;, the title is used as a statement rather than a phrase, warnings listeners to &quot;be on caution where lovers walk&quot;. Perone argues that this lyric establishes a sub-theme that purveys throughout the album, wherein &quot;Trust&quot; is not only about the concept of broken trust, but it is also a direct warning to not make the same mistakes as the characters in the tracks.

First-person narrators are introduced in &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Be a Man&quot;, which describes an encounter between a man and a visibly shaken woman. The man craves for honesty and tenderness but is unable to act on the matter, leading Costello to proclaim the title line. Gouldstone likens it to the tracks on &quot;Get Happy!!&quot; that involve domestic violence, particularly &quot;Human Touch&quot;. A new wave track with a prominent drum mix, Mason deduced the track as sounding like &quot;Costello&#x27;s take on mainstream late-&#x27;70s/early-&#x27;80s AOR.&quot; He also stated that the vocal melody would later be imitated by artists such as Van Morrison and 10cc on their more radio-friendly tracks. The narrator of &quot;Pretty Words&quot; struggles to communicate with his partner, which is put into a social context and used as an attack on tabloid media. With the realisation that &quot;pretty words don&#x27;t mean much anymore&quot;, the songs acts as a metaphor for society&#x27;s lack of common decency; the use of &quot;pretty words&quot; to ease evil acts such as genocide does nothing to diminish the evil of the act itself. Musically, the song is reminiscent of 1960s pop-rock.

&quot;Strict Time&quot; combines a Latin-inspired piano line with the description of a world filled with hysteria and totalitarianism. Like &quot;The Beat&quot; from &quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot;, the title is a musical metaphor, implying that everyone acts in a set-in-stone way despite appearing as though they are acting under free will. &quot;Luxembourg&quot; is a 1950s-era rockabilly track akin to &quot;Mystery Dance&quot; from &quot;My Aim Is True&quot; that uses tourism as an assault on modern life. Perone describes it as &quot;a put-down of mainland European (or Asian) tourists that take advantage of and put down the British&quot;. As a result, these tourists are subjected to a holiday in Luxembourg, &quot;a destination that [is] less desirable than London&quot;. In a change of tempo and mood from previous track, wherein the former increases throughout, Perone considers &quot;Watch Your Step&quot; a showcase for the &quot;sophisticated interplay&quot; of Costello and the Attractions. Gouldstone comments that &quot;its broodingly soulful intensity is like a requiem for all vain wishes&quot;. The more upbeat music stands in contrast with the more disheartening lyrics, which takes place in a club and is filled with a variety of images, including surveillance. The lyrics get progressively darker and by the end, describes a scenario where a group of young male customers conduct brutal acts that end with violent consequences such as death, which Gouldstone argues proves that their actions are insignificant.

===Side two===

In the 2003 liner notes, Costello stated that &quot;New Lace Sleeves&quot; is &quot;mostly concerned with the tension between passion and the emotionally suppressing influence of &#x27;being civilized&#x27;.&quot; Perone notes that the song contains a lower concentration of puns that allows the lyrics to be more easily analysable by the listener and less &quot;glossed over&quot;. Like &quot;Pretty Words&quot;, it sets a personal relationship in a social context. Initially chronicling the morning after a late-night hook-up, the song later juxtaposes a young woman&#x27;s bad choices with society&#x27;s expectations of her. Perone writes that it acts as a critique of personal inconsistency, contrasting &quot;the clean, pretty look of a young woman&#x27;s new outfit with the sometimes tawdry and messy reality of sexual desire and fulfillment&quot;. Perone ties the band&#x27;s performance to the mid-1960s rather than the 1980s, stating it presents a mix of pop, jazz and lounge music. Similar to &quot;Clubland&quot; and &quot;Watch Your Step&quot;, &quot;From a Whisper to a Scream&quot; takes place in a club and is an exploration of alcohol abuse by the intoxicated first-person narrator and the problems that come with it, with the &quot;scream&quot; representing violence or sexual frustration. Perone opines that the vocal harmonies of Costello and Tilbrook do not blend as well as the former&#x27;s later duets, while Hinton compares the pairing to a &quot;white Sam &amp; Dave&quot;.

&quot;Different Finger&quot; is a pastiche country song that addresses marital infidelity. Using observation rather than a narrator, wherein guilt is the dominant emotion, Gouldstone states that it is Costello&#x27;s first song to be about &quot;a specifically adulterous affair&quot;. A first-person narrator acts as an observer on the darker &quot;White Knuckles&quot;, which concerns the beating and sexual exploitation of a woman by a man. The lyrics are overall sympathetic to the abuser, painting him as a victim and giving reason as to why the abuser turned to violence. The woman is receptive to the violence as she fails to see a life without it; she is reinforced to remain in the abusive relationship by her loved ones, who essentially tell her &quot;I told you so&quot;. Like &quot;Get Happy!!&quot; &quot;Beaten to the Punch&quot;, &quot;White Knuckles&quot; is a denouncement of a man who invokes violence on his partner. Perone writes that the song suggests an influence of the Stranglers both musically and lyrically.

According to Costello, &quot;Shot With His Own Gun&quot; is a type of &quot;torch song&quot; that acts as atonement for his wrongdoings of the previous three years. Solely featuring voice over piano, the impressionist lyrics touch on a particularly stale relationship and presents a more sympathetic view to the woman rather than the man, who is, metaphorically, &quot;shot with his own gun&quot;. Gouldstone calls both it and &quot;White Knuckles&quot; milestones for Costello as up to this point, the women in his songs were shown a lack of sympathy. &quot;Fish &#x27;n&#x27; Chip Paper&quot; is lighter in tone compared to the previous two tracks, offering a critique of the media. Regarding the track, Costello stated: &quot;I don&#x27;t think I was attacking the press in relation to my career, just generally.&quot; Perone highlights the line &quot;yesterday&#x27;s news is tomorrow&#x27;s fish &#x27;n&#x27; chip paper&quot; as &quot;suggesting the transitory nature and lack of real importance of public gossip&quot;. The music itself features a heavier studio production with several overdubs; Costello&#x27;s voice is treated with electronic processing. &quot;Big Sister&#x27;s Clothes&quot; was produced and solely performed by Costello and contains experimentation that Perone compares to the Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; (1966). According to Gouldstone, the song concerns how deceitful love can be for people growing up and how young girls who are eager to grow up by wearing their &quot;big sister&#x27;s clothes&quot; fail to see the consequences of wanting to grow up so quickly. Perone opines that it could also offer commentary on the state of Britain during the era of Thatcherism.

==Packaging and artwork==
While the sleeve packaging for &quot;Get Happy!!&quot; mimicked the 1960s, Gouldstone argues that the packaging for &quot;Trust&quot; imitated the 1940s and 1950s. The cover artwork is an out-of-focus headshot of Costello wearing a suit and red-tinted glasses. His eyebrows are arched, his glasses are tilted and he is looking up. The cover itself lacks the artist&#x27;s name and the title is underlined. Costello later said that the cover was a form of irony, as &quot;the person on the cover looks completely untrustworthy&quot;. Perone considers it &quot;one of the most memorable images&quot; in early 1980s pop music. The original intended artwork depicted Costello in a film noir scene dressed like Guy Fawkes in a dark coat, glasses and fedora, lighting a cigarette. The back cover is, in Hinton&#x27;s words, &quot;deliberately skew-wiff&quot;, depicting the band playing at what appears to be a cocktail bar, although it was actually shot on a stage set. The inside of the sleeve boasts an image of the Attractions and other individuals dressed as a brass big band, with the caption &quot;The Soundtrack of Life&quot;. Alongside Lowe dressed in a tuxedo mime-playing a saxophone, the photograph included the band&#x27;s road crew, F-Beat staff and the owners of Eden Studios. The original packaging did not include a lyric sheet.

==Release==
F-Beat issued &quot;Clubland&quot; as the lead single from the album, backed by the outtakes &quot;Clean Money&quot; and &quot;Hoover Factory&quot;, in December 1980 for the pre-Christmas market. It charted at number 60 in the UK, breaking a string of nine consecutive top 40 singles for the artist. Thomson commented that it &quot;effectively marked the end of Elvis and the Attractions&#x27; flirtation with pop stardom&quot;. On 4January 1981, Costello and the Attractions commenced a six-week tour of North America – his first there in almost two years – with Squeeze as the supporting act. Compared to previous tours, the shows were longer than before, with 20 to 30 songs played every show, ranging from songs across his career and several covers. Costello&#x27;s behaviour on stage was also enthusiastic and earned him positive reviews from attendees, although alcohol and drugs frequented throughout the tour.

F-Beat issued &quot;Trust&quot; in the UK on 23January 1981, while its US release through Columbia came on 29January. It peaked at number nine on the UK Albums Chart but stalled at number 28 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape chart. Elsewhere, &quot;Trust&quot; charted at number eight in Sweden, 17 in New Zealand, 28 in Norway and 71 in Australia. The biographer Tony Clayton-Lea commented that &quot;&quot;Trust&quot; creative strength – variety – was its commercial weakness&quot;. In February, &quot;From a Whisper to a Scream&quot; was issued as the second single, backed by &quot;Luxembourg&quot;, which failed to chart, becoming the artist&#x27;s first flop since &quot;(The Angels Wanna Wear My) Red Shoes&quot; in 1977. To increase publicity, Riviera arranged for the band to appear on Jimmy Savile&#x27;s programme &quot;Jim&#x27;ll Fix It&quot;, where a young boy earned the opportunity to become a roadie for a day. The band also filmed promotional music videos for &quot;Clubland&quot; and &quot;New Lace Sleeves&quot;.

Costello and the Attractions embarked a small tour of Britain in March 1981, titled A Tour to Trust, with Dave and the Mistakes as the supporting act. In April, Costello underwent an interview with Tom Snyder on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Tomorrow&quot;, marking his first appearance on live television in the US since &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in late 1977. &quot;Watch Your Step&quot; was rush-released as a single in the country to coincide with the event.

== Critical reception ==
&quot;Trust&quot; initially received mixed-to-positive reviews from music critics in the UK. Reviewers highlighted the artist&#x27;s change in tone from his earlier records and a growing maturity in the lyrics. &quot;Melody Maker&quot; Allan Jones summarised: &quot;Costello&#x27;s vision is as fierce as ever, but the malice has gone; he can still rage but he no longer scolds.&quot; Some found the album a poor retread from his earlier works, while others thought the lyrics were too inaccessible for casual listeners. More positively, Mike Gardner in &quot;Record Mirror&quot; believed the &quot;energy and care&quot; brought by Costello and the Attractions allowed the &quot;Costello formula&quot; to continue to succeed.

In contrast, &quot;Trust&quot; received massive acclaim in the US. American critics emphasised the diverse and accessible musical styles, a growing maturity in the lyrics and continued to praise Costello as one of the best musicians in modern music. Some believed it was Costello&#x27;s best work up to that point. In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Robert Palmer stressed the importance of the Attractions as a backing band, writing that they have not only expanded their ranges, but sound &quot;fuller and richer&quot; than on &quot;Get Happy!!&quot; Palmer further saluted the artist for creating a body of work that remained consistently high quality. A reviewer for &quot;Cash Box&quot; deemed it a return to form over &quot;Get Happy!!&quot;, concluding: &quot;New wave or old, Costello remains at music&#x27;s forefront.&quot; Ken Tucker found &quot;Trust&quot; contained some of the artist&#x27;s &quot;very best&quot; and &quot;very worst&quot; work in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, stating that its &quot;smooth sound and clever accompaniments don&#x27;t yield a forthright LP&quot;. In &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau drew positive comparisons to &quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot;, arguing that &quot;this is rock and roll as eloquent, hard-hitting pop, and Elvis has turned into such a soul man that I no longer wish he&#x27;d change his name to George and go country.&quot;

&quot;Trust&quot; was ranked the seventh best album of 1981 by &quot;NME&quot; and topped the year-end list by &quot;Trouser Press&quot;. In &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s annual Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll of the year&#x27;s best albums, &quot;Trust&quot; finished third, behind X&#x27;s &quot;Wild Gift&quot; and the Clash&#x27;s &quot;Sandinista!&quot;

==Subsequent events and legacy==

After its release, Costello was initially displeased with the record. In an interview with &quot;The Face&quot; in 1983, he stated: &quot;I feel it&#x27;s under-realised. There were some very good songs on it and some very bad songs, but overall we didn&#x27;t follow it through to anything definite enough.&quot; By 2002, Costello described &quot;Trust&quot; as &quot;a record that falls between the cracks a little bit&quot;, but stated that he felt &quot;New Lace Sleeves&quot; stood as one of the Attractions&#x27; greatest performances. &quot;Trust&quot; was Costello&#x27;s final album with the team of Lowe and Béchirian.

According to Thomson, the weaker commercial performances of both &quot;Get Happy!!&quot; and &quot;Trust&quot; made Costello question where he was at in his career. He was unable to express his current thoughts into his own music and proclaimed that he &quot;just wanted to sing other people&#x27;s songs&quot;. Having recorded acoustic demos of several standards during the previous months, including &quot;Gloomy Sunday&quot; and Cole Porter&#x27;s &quot;Love for Sale&quot;, Costello devised an album of cover versions to test himself as a singer and interpreter. Released in October 1981, &quot;Almost Blue&quot; was composed entirely of country covers and was derided by the music press, particularly in the United States. Costello teamed up with former Beatles engineer Geoff Emerick for &quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot;, his most heavily produced, heavily orchestrated and most expansive work up to that point;

===Retrospective appraisal===
Retrospectively, &quot;Trust&quot; has received critical acclaim as one of Costello&#x27;s best, and most underrated, works that warrants reappraisal. Commentators have viewed &quot;Trust&quot; as exhibiting an artist and band at their creative peaks. Reviewing for &quot;Uncut&quot; in 2003, Jon Wilde found the album contained &quot;a binge of great songwriting&quot;, summarising: &quot;Showcasing some of [Costello&#x27;s] most violently acerbic writing, with the Attractions at their most pathologically inventive, &quot;Trust&quot; boomed and slammed and whispered with sly, creative intent.&quot; Thomson argues that at its best, &quot;Trust&quot; showcased Costello &quot;at his most darkly dramatic&quot; and the Attractions &quot;at their most restrained yet widescreen&quot;.

Some also wrote that the album contains both &quot;complexity&quot; and &quot;sophistication&quot; that the artist&#x27;s earlier LPs lacked. Writing in 2006, &quot;Treblezine&quot; Ernest Simpson noted that &quot;Trust&quot; lacked the &quot;standout successes&quot; of the artist&#x27;s prior albums, yet all of the LP&#x27;s songs contained a &quot;sophistication&quot; that those works lacked, including the absence of an opening track that began with Costello&#x27;s voice before the band joined in. He ultimately deemed it &quot;probably the most diverse and yet consistently great album that Elvis &amp; the Attractions ever released&quot;. AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine agreed, arguing that it is Costello and the Attractions&#x27; &quot;most impressive album&quot;. In a piece commemorating the 30th anniversary of its release, Sheffield named &quot;Trust&quot; Costello&#x27;s best album, one that remains &quot;his funniest, his wisest and his most rocking&quot;. Writers for &quot;Stereogum&quot; called the album &quot;yet another high watermark&quot; for Costello in 2021. In a more mixed review, Rob Smith of &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; acknowledged the record contained both highs and lows and concluded that it falls between being a classic and a dud.

In 2000, &quot;Trust&quot; was voted number 708 in the third edition of writer Colin Larkin&#x27;s book &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;. Twenty years later, &quot;Paste&quot; magazine ranked it the 25th best album of the 1980s.

===Reissues===
&quot;Trust&quot; was first released on CD through Columbia and Demon Records in January 1986. Its first extended reissue through Demon in the UK and Rykodisc in the US on CD came in May 1994, which came with nine bonus tracks. Rhino Records reissued the album on 9 September 2003 as a two-disc set with eight additional bonus tracks alongside those of 1994. The album later was remastered and reissued by UMe on 4 December 2015.

<doc id="1344979" wikidata="Q610342" url="?curid=1344979" title="Visbreaker">
<text>A visbreaker is a processing unit in an oil refinery whose purpose is to minimize the quantity of residual oil produced in the distillation of crude oil and to increase the yield of more valuable middle distillates (heating oil and diesel) by the refinery. A visbreaker thermally cracks large hydrocarbon molecules in the oil by heating in a furnace to lower its viscosity and to produce small quantities of light hydrocarbons. (LPG and gasoline). The process name of &quot;visbreaker&quot; refers to the fact that the process lowers (i.e., breaks) the viscosity of the residual oil. The process is non-catalytic.

==Process objectives==

The objectives of visbreaking are:

* Lower the viscosity of the feed stream: Typically this is the residue from vacuum distillation of crude oil but can also be the residue from hydroskimming operations, natural bitumen from seeps in the ground or tar sands, and even certain high viscosity crude oils.
* Lower the amount of residual fuel oil produced by a refinery: Residual fuel oil is generally regarded as a low value product. Demand for residual fuel continues to decrease as it is replaced in its traditional markets, such as fuel needed to generate steam in power stations, by cleaner burning alternative fuels such as natural gas.
* Increase the proportion of middle distillates in the refinery output: Middle distillate is used as a diluent with residual oils to bring their viscosity down to a marketable level. By lowering the viscosity of the residual stream in a visbreaker, a fuel oil can be made using less diluent and the middle distillate saved can be diverted to higher value diesel or heating oil manufacture.

==Technology==

===Coil visbreaking===

The term coil (or furnace) visbreaking is applied to units where the cracking process occurs in the furnace tubes (or &quot;coils&quot;). Material exiting the furnace is quenched to halt the cracking reactions: frequently this is achieved by heat exchange with the virgin material being fed to the furnace, which in turn is a good energy efficiency step, but sometimes a stream of cold oil (usually gas oil) is used to the same effect. The gas oil is recovered and re-used. The extent of the cracking reaction is controlled by regulation of the speed of flow of the oil through the furnace tubes. The quenched oil then passes to a fractionator where the products of the cracking (gas, LPG, gasoline, gas oil and tar) are separated and recovered.

===Soaker visbreaking===

In soaker visbreaking, the bulk of the cracking reaction occurs not in the furnace but in a drum located after the furnace called the soaker. Here the oil is held at an elevated temperature for a pre-determined period of time to allow cracking to occur before being quenched. The oil then passes to a fractionator. In soaker visbreaking, lower temperatures are used than in coil visbreaking. The comparatively long duration of the cracking reaction is used instead.

===Process options===

Visbreaker tar can be further refined by feeding it to a vacuum fractionator. Here additional heavy gas oil may be recovered and routed either to catalytic cracking, hydrocracking or thermal cracking units on the refinery. The vacuum-flashed tar (sometimes referred to as pitch) is then routed to fuel oil blending. In a few refinery locations, visbreaker tar is routed to a delayed coker for the production of certain specialist cokes such as anode coke or needle coke.

===Soaker visbreaking versus coil visbreaking===

From the standpoint of yield, there is little or nothing to choose between the two approaches. However, each offers significant advantages in particular situations:

* De-coking: The cracking reaction forms petroleum coke as a byproduct. In coil visbreaking, this deposits in the tubes of the furnace and will eventually lead to fouling or blocking of the tubes. The same will occur in the drum of a soaker visbreaker, though the lower temperatures used in the soaker drum lead to fouling at a much slower rate. Coil visbreakers therefore require frequent de-coking. This is quite labour-intensive, but can be developed into a routine where tubes are de-coked sequentially without the need to shut down the visbreaking operation. Soaker drums require far less frequent attention but their being taken out of service normally requires a complete halt to the operation. Which is the more disruptive activity will vary from refinery to refinery.
* Fuel Economy: The lower temperatures used in the soaker approach mean that these units use less fuel. In cases where a refinery buys fuel to support process operations, any savings in fuel consumption could be extremely valuable. In such cases, soaker visbreaking may be advantageous.

==Quality and yields==

===Feed quality and product quality===

The quality of the feed going into a visbreaker will vary considerably with the type of crude oil that the refinery is processing. The following is a typical quality for the vacuum distillation residue of Arabian light (a crude oil from Saudi Arabia and widely refined around the world):

Once this material has been run through a visbreaker (and, again, there will be considerable variation from visbreaker to visbreaker as no two will operate under exactly the same conditions) the lowering in viscosity is dramatic:

===Yields===

The yields of the various hydrocarbon products will depend on the &quot;severity&quot; of the cracking operation as determined by the temperature the oil is heated to in the visbreaker furnace. At the low end of the scale, a furnace heating to 425 °C would crack only mildly, while operations at 500 °C would be considered as very severe. Arabian light crude residue when visbroken at 450 °C would yield around 76% (by weight) of tar, 15% middle distillates, 6% gasolines and 3% gas and LPG.

===Fuel oil stability===

The severity of visbreaker operation is normally limited by the need to produce a visbreaker tar that can be blended to make a stable fuel oil.

Stability in this case is taken to mean the tendency of a fuel oil to produce sediments when stored. These sediments are undesirable as they can quickly foul the filters of pumps used to move the oil necessitating time-consuming maintenance.

Vacuum residue fed to a visbreaker can be considered to be composed of the following:

* Asphaltenes: large polycyclic molecules that are suspended in the oil in a coloidal form
* Resins: also polycyclic but of a lower molecular weight than asphaltenes
* Aromatic hydrocarbons: derivatives of benzene, toluene and xylenes
* Parafinic hydrocarbons: alkanes

Visbreaking preferentially cracks aliphatic compounds which have relatively low sulphur contents, low density and high viscosity and the effect of their removal can be clearly seen in the change in quality between feed and product. A too severe cracking in a visbreaker will lead to the asphaltene colloid becoming metastable. Subsequent addition of a diluent to manufacture a finished fuel oil can cause the colloid to break down, precipitating asphaltenes as a sludge. It has been observed that a paraffinic diluent is more likely to cause precipitation than an aromatic one. Stability of fuel oil is assessed using a number of proprietary tests (for example &quot;P&quot; value and SHF tests).

==Economics==

===Viscosity blending===

The viscosity blending of two or more liquids having different viscosities is a three-step procedure. The first step is to calculate the Viscosity Blending Index (VBI) of each component of the blend using the following equation (known as a Refutas equation):
:(1)   VBN = 14.534 × ln[ln(&quot;v&quot; + 0.8)] + 10.975

where v is the viscosity in square millimeters per second (mm²/s) or centistokes (cSt) and ln is the natural logarithm (loge). It is important that the viscosity of each component of the blend be obtained at the same temperature.

The next step is to calculate the VBN of the blend, using this equation:

:(2)   VBNBlend = [&quot;w&quot;A × VBNA] + [&quot;w&quot;B × VBNB] + ... + [&quot;w&quot;X × VBNX]

where w is the weight fraction (i.e., % ÷ 100) of each component of the blend.

Once the viscosity blending number of a blend has been calculated using equation (2), the final step is to determine the viscosity of the blend by using the invert of equation (1):

:(3)   v = ee(VBN - 10.975) ÷ 14.534 − 0.8

where VBN is the viscosity blending number of the blend and e is the transcendental number 2.71828, also known as Euler&#x27;s number.

===Example economics for a two-component blend===

A marketable fuel oil, such as for fueling a power station, might be required to have a viscosity of 40 centistokes at 100 °C. It might be prepared using either the virgin or visbroken residue described above combined with a distillate diluent (&quot;cutter stock&quot;). Such a cutter stock could typically have a viscosity at 100 °C of 1.3 centistokes. Rearranging equation (2) above for a simple two component blend shows that the percentage of cutterstock required in the blend is found by:

(4)   %cutter stock = [VBN40 − VBNresidue] ÷ [VBNcutter stock − VBNresidue]

Using the viscosities quoted in the tables above for the residues from Arab Light crude oil and calculating VBNs according to equation (1) gives:

For virgin residue (i.e., the unconverted feed to the visbreaker): 27.5% cutter stock in the blend

For visbroken residue: 13.3% cutter stock in the blend.

As middle distillates have a far higher value in the market place than fuel oils, it can be seen that the use of a visbreaker will considerably improve the economics of fuel oil manufacture. For example, if the cutter stock is taken to have a value of $300 per tonne and fuel oil $150 per ton (oil prices naturally change quickly, but these prices, and more importantly the differences between them, are not unrealistic), it is a simple matter to calculate the value of the different residues in this example as being:

Virgin residue: $93.1 per tonne

Visbroken residue: $127.0 per tonne

<text>A horticultural industry is an organization devoted to the study and culture of cultivated plants. Such organizations may be local, regional, national, or international. Some have a more general focus, whereas others are devoted to a particular kind or group of plants. They are also clustered. 

The oldest horticultural society in the world, founded in 1768, is the Ancient Society of York Florists. They still have four shows a year in York, UK.
They have a large archive of records, including the original members book dating back to 1768.The American Horticultural Society inspires a culture of gardening and horticultural practices that creates and sustains healthy, beautiful communities and a livable planet.

<doc id="1345000" wikidata="Q39521" url="?curid=1345000" title="St. Paul's Bay">
<text>Saint Paul&#x27;s Bay () is a town located on the northeast coast of Malta in the Northern Region. It is a major residential and commercial area and a centre for shopping, bars, dining, and café life. As per the 2021 population census, it has also become the most populated town in the country.

Its name refers to the shipwreck of Saint Paul as documented in the Acts of the Apostles on St. Paul&#x27;s Islands near St Paul&#x27;s Bay, on his voyage from Caesarea to Rome, which laid the foundations of Christianity on the island.

Burmarrad, Wardija, Qawra, Buġibba, Xemxija, and San Martin, as well as parts of Bidnija and Mistra, form part of St. Paul&#x27;s Bay Local Council. The area of the locality is .

The permanent resident population in 2021 was 32,042. This nearly doubles, going up to about 60,000, between June and September with Maltese residents and tourists lodging in hotels, especially in Buġibba and Qawra. Heading north is Mistra Bay, its headland and St Paul&#x27;s Island. Going west and crossing the island towards Ġnejna Bay and Golden Bay is the scenic Wardija Ridge.

==History==

Archaeological remains have been found in the limits of St. Paul&#x27;s Bay, which go back to around 4000 BC. Among the remains there are the megalithic temples of Buġibba and Xemxija. In addition, Cart Ruts were found on Wardija Ridge at Busewdien, while Punic tombs and other Bronze Age remains were also found. During the Roman period, St. Paul&#x27;s Bay became an important harbour. Remains of a Roman road, baths and beehives, have been found at Xemxija, while Roman anchors have been found on the seabed.

By the late Middle Ages, St. Paul&#x27;s Bay was abandoned since the area was unsafe due to corsair raids. The local militia maintained several watch posts in the area. One of these, known as Ta&#x27; Tabibu farmhouse, still survives today and is considered to be the oldest building in St. Paul&#x27;s Bay. A building of a church was also noted at the arrival of the Order of St John in 1530.

A number of fortifications were built in the area during the rule of the Order of Saint John. The first of these was the Wignacourt Tower, built in 1610, which is now the oldest surviving watchtower in Malta. Qawra Tower was built by Grand Master Lascaris in 1638. In 1715, batteries were built around these two towers, while two batteries and a redoubt were built in other parts of the St. Paul&#x27;s Bay coastline. Of these, only Arrias Battery survives today, since Dellia Battery and Perellos Redoubt were demolished in the 20th century.

The bay was one of the landing places during the French invasion of Malta in June 1798. After the Maltese uprising against the French, St. Paul&#x27;s Bay became the main harbour of Malta since the Grand Harbour and Marsamxett were still under French control.

In the 19th century, several villas were built in St. Paul&#x27;s Bay. These were requisitioned by the British military in World War II and the bay became a rest camp. After the Italian armistice of 1943, 76 ships of the were anchored at St. Paul&#x27;s Bay after surrendering to the British.

After the war, the area began to be further developed. Today, St. Paul&#x27;s Bay, Qawra, Buġibba, Xemxija and Burmarrad form a large cluster of buildings. The area is a popular entertainment spot.

== Crime ==
As of 2020, St. Paul&#x27;s Bay has the largest number of reported thefts in Malta, amounting to 423 out of 4,037 thefts, and the largest amount of domestic violence incidents, amounting to 93 out of 1,409.

<text>James Francis Pantridge, (3 October 1916 – 26 December 2004) was a Northern Irish physician, cardiologist, and professor who transformed emergency medicine and paramedic services with the invention of the portable defibrillator.

==Early life==
Pantridge was born in Hillsborough, County Down (now Royal Hillsborough), Northern Ireland, on 3 October 1916. He was educated at Friends&#x27; School Lisburn and Queen&#x27;s University of Belfast, graduating in medicine in 1939.

==Military service==
During World War II he served in the British Army. He was commissioned into the Royal Army Medical Corps as a lieutenant on 12 April 1940. He was given the service number 128673. He was awarded the Military Cross during the Fall of Singapore, when he became a POW. He served much of his captivity as a slave labourer on the Burma Railway. When he was freed at the war&#x27;s end, Pantridge was emaciated and had contracted cardiac beriberi; he suffered from ill-health related to the disease for the rest of his life.

==Medical career==
After Pantridge&#x27;s liberation he worked as a lecturer in the pathology department at Queen&#x27;s University, and then won a scholarship to the University of Michigan, where he studied under Dr. Frank Norman Wilson, a cardiologist and authority on electrocardiography.

He returned to Northern Ireland in 1950, and was appointed as cardiac consultant to the Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast and professor at Queen&#x27;s University, where he remained until his retirement in 1982. There he established a specialist cardiology unit whose work became known around the world.

By 1957 Pantridge and his colleague, Dr John Geddes, had introduced the modern system of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for the early treatment of cardiac arrest. Further study led Frank Pantridge to the realization that many deaths resulted from ventricular fibrillation which needed to be treated before the patient was admitted to hospital. This led to his introduction of the mobile coronary care unit (MCCU), an ambulance with specialist equipment and staff to provide pre-hospital care.

During his time living in the hills beyond Poleglass to extend the usefulness of early treatment, Pantridge went on to develop the portable defibrillator, and in 1965 installed his first version in a Belfast ambulance. It weighed 70 kg and operated from car batteries, but by 1968 he had designed an instrument weighing only 3 kg, incorporating a miniature capacitor manufactured for NASA. Much of Pantridge&#x27;s research was conducted alongside colleague John Anderson, the head of Biomedical Engineering at Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast, who went on to co-found Heartsine. 

His work was backed up by clinical investigations and epidemiological studies in scientific papers, including an influential 1967 &quot;The Lancet&quot; article. With these developments, the Belfast treatment system, often known as the &quot;Pantridge Plan&quot;, became adopted throughout the world by emergency medical services. The portable defibrillator became recognised as a key tool in first aid, and Pantridge&#x27;s refinement of the automated external defibrillator (AED) allowed it to be used safely by members of the public.

Although he was known worldwide as the &quot;Father of Emergency Medicine&quot;, Frank Pantridge was less acclaimed in his own country, and was saddened that it took until 1990 for all front-line ambulances in the UK to be fitted with defibrillators.

==Honours and decorations==
Pantridge was awarded the Military Cross &quot;in recognition of gallant and distinguished services in Malaya in 1942&quot;. The citation read:
In June 1969, he was appointed Officer of the Order of St. John (OStJ). He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1979 New Year Honours.

The city of Lisburn commissioned a statue of Pantridge, which stands outside the council&#x27;s offices at the Lagan Valley Island centre.

A Blue Plaque to Pantridge was erected by the entrance to the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast in 2021.

Pantridge Road in Poleglass, Belfast was named after him.

Pantridge Link, Royal Hillsborough was also named after him.

==Personal life==
Partridge lived in Collin House, Poleglass in the 1960s and 70s.

==Death==
Pantridge died aged 88 on St. Stephen’s Day 2004. He was unmarried.

*61 Muslims commanded to salute one another
*62-63 True believers exhorted to implicit obedience to the Apostle of God
*64 The Omniscient God will judge all men 

The general agreement of scholars is that this surah was revealed shortly before or after the Battle of the Trench in 5 AH.
The surah begins with various explanations and decrees on or relating to corrupt sexual acts, family law, and specifications on the giving of testimony. Foremost amongst these rulings is God&#x27;s punishment for adultery. This section ends with the pronouncement that good men and women should be paired together, as should corrupt men and corrupt women. This discussion turns into reflections on privacy and modesty, namely of hosts and women. Contained herein are several regulations and explanations of modesty, most directly lines traditionally used to argue for the wearing of hijab. After these prohibitions are cast for women, the text turns towards men, asking them not to oppress slavegirls into prostitution, and to marry those women who need husbands, despite their poverty.

==Exegesis==
===2-4 Unlawful sexual intercourse===

Most of the rules related to fornication, adultery and false accusations from a husband to his wife or from members of the community to chaste women, can be found in chapter 24, which starts by giving very specific rules about punishment for unlawful sexual intercourse (&quot;zināʾ&quot;):

 
Tafsir Ibn Kathir says in relation to the witnessing of their punishment: &quot;This is more humiliating for the people who are guilty of illegal sex, if they are flogged in front of the people. This is because it is more effective as a deterrent and it conveys the sense of scandal and rebuke&quot;.
In Tafsir Ibn Kathir, the prescribed punishment for making false accusations against chaste men or women is to flog them with eighty stripes, and reject their testimony forever.

===35 &quot;the Light Verse&quot;===

After a second statement of the Quran&#x27;s status as a clear sign from God, the famed Verse of Light appears. This is often referred to as &quot;the Light Verse&quot;, or &quot;the Parable of Light&quot;, a mystical group of lines that has been the subject of much scholarship and reflection.

:&quot;GOD is the light of heaven and earth: the similitude of his light is as a niche in a wall, wherein a lamp is placed, and the lamp enclosed in a case of glass; the glass appears as it were a shining star. It is lighted with the oil of a blessed tree, an olive neither of the east, nor of the west:z it wanteth little but that the oil thereof would give light, although no fire touched it. This is light added unto light:a GOD will direct unto his light whom he pleaseth. GOD propoundeth parables unto men; for GOD knoweth all things.&quot;

===36-44 believers will be rewarded===

The Quran here briefly returns to a slightly more literal form of speech as it reassures believers that their remembrance will be rewarded, as the forgetfulness of the sinners will be punished. In keeping with the Verse of Light, the unbelievers too are explained in metaphor, returning to the deeply symbolic tone above:

&quot;And as for the unbelievers, their works are as a mirage in a spacious plain,
in which a thirsty man thinks there to be water,
until when he comes to it, he finds it is nothing;
there indeed he finds God and He pays him his account in full;
and God is swift in the reckoning;
or they are as shadows upon a sea obscured,
covered by a billow above which is a billow above which are clouds;
shadows piled one upon the other;
when he puts forth his hand, wellnigh he cannot see it.
And whoever God assigns no light, no light has he.&quot; (Lines 39–40)

The Quran explains that the Earth itself is evidence of God&#x27;s reality and power. He controls the clouds, the winds, the hail, and the mountains. It is also explained in this surah that God created all creatures from water, including animals with four feet, animals with two feet, and animals without any feet.

===45 Birth and social status===

The Quran confirms that God has sent down signs (verse) to make His reality clear, and that understanding that reality is as a &quot;straight path&quot;, that if one is truly following, one can never be led astray. God keeps His word, and will continue to reward those who believe and keep to their religion, as He has rewarded others in the past for doing the same.

The Book urges the believer not to fret, and not to accuse people of sin merely for the conditions of their birth or social status. For example, in many tribal cultures a blind person or their parents were believed to be wicked, hence the gods or the spirits have blinded them. The Quran urges one not to think in this manner, and instead remember that all things are signs from God, and thus all believers should be of good nature to others, and wish them blessings from God. If that is done, the signs become clear and &quot;haply you will understand&quot;.

As the believer must greet others well, so must they ask for leave from them before departing. However, the surah ends, God knows the hidden reasons people do as they do, &quot;God knows those of you who slip away surreptitiously&quot;, for when all returns to Him, they will testify against themselves to Him.

<text>Al-Furqan (, ; The Criterion) is the 25th chapter (sūrah) of the Qur&#x27;an, with 77 verses (āyāt). The name Al-Furqan, or &quot;The Criterion&quot;, refers to the Qur&#x27;an itself as the decisive factor between good and evil. This Surah is named Al-Furqan from the 4th word in the 1st ayat.

The chapter emphasizes (25:68–70) that there is no sin, however great, that cannot be forgiven if sincerely repented, showing faith and working with righteous deeds.

Al-Furqan refers to the Torah within the contents of the surah, saying &quot;We sent Moses the Book, and appointed his brother Aaron with him as minister&quot; (Sura 25, verse 35), but it does not address the Torah as al-Furqan itself.

==Analysis==
The Surah manages the questions and doubts that were being raised against the Quran, the Prophethood of Muhammad, and his lessons by the disbelievers of Mecca. Suitable responses to every single objection are revealed in the surah and the individuals have been cautioned of the results of dismissing the Truth. The significant issues, divine laws, and directly follows the following order in the surah:- 
# The Quran is the rule, the criterion i.e. &quot;Al-Furqan&quot; to distinguish between the right and the wrong. 
# Transgressors are the individuals who dismiss Reality, distrust the Rasool, and preclude the Day of Judgment and hereafter. 
# Upon the arrival of Judgment Day, those False-deities worshiped by the mushriks will declare no divinity and consider the mushrik is answerable for their shirk, on the Judgement Day. 
# The disbelievers will lament not opting for the Righteous Path upon the arrival of Judgment Day. 
# Sequential, gradual, and bit-by-bit disclosure of the Quran is a pearl of wisdom. 
# Allah&#x27;s decree is commanded to make Jihad against unbelief in the Quran. 
# Qualities of genuine devotees are portrayed. 

Toward the finish of the Surah, a description of the character of a true believer is given at the start of Surah Al-Mu&#x27;minoon. According to Abul A&#x27;la Maududi
: Here is the criterion for distinguishing the genuine from the counterfeit. This is the noble character of those people who have believed in and followed the teachings of the Holy Prophet and this is the kind of people that he is trying to train. You may yourselves compare and contrast this type of people with those Arabs, who have not as yet accepted the Message, and who are upholding &quot;ignorance&quot; and exerting their utmost to defeat the Truth. Now you may judge for yourselves as to which you would like to choose.&quot; Though this question was not posed in so many words, it was placed before everyone in Arabia in a tangible shape. It may be noted that during the next few years, the practical answer given to this question by the whole nation, with the exception of a small minority, was that they chose Islam.

==Time of Revelation==
It shows up from its style and topic that it was additionally uncovered during the third phase of Prophethood at Makkah like Surah Al-Mu&#x27;minun.

Parts of Q25:14-27 are preserved in the Ṣan‘ā’1 lower text.

<text>Anstey is a large village in Leicestershire, England, located north west of Leicester in the borough of Charnwood. Its population was 9,000 at the 2021 census. This figure is expected to increase due to the building of a new housing development off Groby Road. The village is separated from Leicester by the Rothley Brook, Castle Hill Park and the A46, and it borders the villages of Glenfield, Groby, Newtown Linford, Cropston and Thurcaston as well as the suburb of Beaumont Leys and Anstey Heights. To the north-west lies Bradgate Park.

Anstey is known as the Gateway to Charnwood Forest. It is a combination of traditional English village (with two village greens - the top green and bottom green) and an industrial town (with several 19th-century hosiery factories, many of which are now being turned into apartments) which is made up mostly of a number of small estates, both council and private which are intertwined, often with no clear border.

==History==
Anstey dates back to Angle origins, when it was known as Hanstige (later Anstige), meaning a narrow forest track (specifically the meaning is either &#x27;one-way&#x27; or &#x27;steep road&#x27;). Anstey was positioned between Charnwood Forest and Leicester Forest.

Whilst developing the site for the new Co-op store in 2002 archaeologists were called in and found remains dating back to the 12th century. A plaque recording this has been placed on the wall of the new shop.

The place-name of Anstey is first recorded in Domesday Book when it was held by one of the county&#x27;s largest landholders, Hugh de Grandmesnil, castellan of Leicester. At the time it was a small farming community.

Anstey appears to have had its origins in two distinct settlement foci, each associated with a separate manor, one associated with Leicester Abbey and one with the Ferrers of Groby.

It is believed that Anstey once had a sizable military force - in 1431 William Porter &quot;furnished XIX hommes and IX archers&quot;.

When Bonnie Prince Charlie&#x27;s army moved south during the 1745 rebellion, although the main body of troops were turned back at Derby, a foraging party reached the commons of Anstey.

Local industry included hosiery from the eighteenth to the nineteenth century, leading to a rise in population to around 600 by 1800. By 1845 there were 300 people employed as framework knitters in the village. A decline in the industry in the middle of the nineteenth century saw a fall in the village&#x27;s population, although hosiery manufacture continued in the village until the mid-twentieth century. Boot and shoe manufacture became a more important part of the village&#x27;s work between 1860 and 1900, and the first employer in Leicestershire described as a &quot;boot and shoe manufacturer&quot; appeared in Anstey in 1863. The village&#x27;s population rose to over 2,500 by 1900, with a corresponding rise in house-building. Anstey became an independent parish in 1866, having previously been a chapelry of Thurcaston. A number of related industries developed in the village, including tanning and box-making, the latter still present in the village. One of the largest companies in the village was the Anstey Wallpaper Company, which occupied a site east of Cropston Road now filled with houses and the new Co-op store. Nearly all the local factories have now either been demolished or converted into flats. By 1971, the population of the village had risen to almost 6,000. The village is still the home of Ulverscroft Large Print Books Ltd., known for their large-print editions of popular books, published since 1964.

The most notable family of Anstey was the Martin family, who lived in the village from the 13th century until 1892. Two members of the family held the position of Lord Lieutenant of Leicestershire, and the local high school is named after them. They lived at Anstey Pastures (now demolished), before moving to The Brand in 1892.

Famous past Anstey residents include Ned Ludd (Ludlam), the machine-wrecker whose name was appropriated by the Luddites - whose name was adopted in a recent household development in the village: Ned Ludd Close, and snooker player and commentator Willie Thorne, who started playing snooker at the village&#x27;s Conservative club. Footballer Derek Dougan lived in the village during his time at Leicester City.

According to legend, the last wolf to be killed in England was shot in a forest &quot;near Anstige in Wolfdale&quot;. Wolfdale was a nearby district towards Newtown Linford, and the name has survived in a slightly altered form with Wooldale Close, one of the streets in the village.

==Religion==
There are Church of England, United Reformed and Methodist churches in the village.

The parish church of St. Mary is on Bradgate Road, just out of The Nook, has the remains of a fifteenth-century preaching cross and was previously part of the Parish of Thurcaston.

The United Reformed church is further up Bradgate Road.

The Methodist church is situated near The Nook on Cropston Road, and is a medium-sized church serving the community, being part of the Leicester West Circuit of the Oxford and Leicester District of the Methodist Church. An earlier Methodist church was located on the opposite side of the road to the current church, until it was demolished in the 1980s.

==Education==
The earliest purpose-built school for children in Anstey was on Bradgate Road, built in 1873 and now a Grade II listed building that has been converted to flats; For many years after later schools were built this continued to serve as the village&#x27;s infant school until it closed in 1982 whereupon the teaching of infants was relocated to nearby Latimer Primary School. There was also an Adult School &amp; Institute on Church Lane, the building now occupied by a printing company.

There are currently three schools in Anstey:
* Latimer Primary School, Latimer Street - original building from 1896
* Woolden Hill Primary School, Netherfield Road - opened 1977
* The Martin High School, Anstey, Link Road - opened 1957, now a secondary academy for 11- to 16-year-olds

College students go to The Cedars Academy at Birstall. They may also go to English Martyrs RC School on Anstey Lane, Brookvale High School in Groby, or Rawlins Community College in Quorn (Out of catchment area).

===The Martin High School===
In March 2008, The Martin High was placed 10th best school in the country and 3rd best in the county for pupils&#x27; progress between the ages of 11 and 14.

==The village==
Anstey retains some of the charm of a traditional village particularly on the area immediately north of the village centre, but due to its industrial background there are many small terraced houses as well as some pre-fabricated post war council houses in the &#x27;Dutch barn&#x27; style. The large houses towards the top of Bradgate Road change into terraced houses in the old industrial area, and then modern suburbia out towards Link Road, where the Anstey Martin school can be found. Just off the Nook is Latimer primary school, named after Bishop Latimer.

The Rothley Brook flows through the village on its way to the River Soar, and there are two ancient bridges (the Packhorse Bridge and King William&#x27;s Bridge) and an old water mill. The packhorse bridge is on the route of the original road from Leicester. King William&#x27;s Bridge is so named because when King William III planned to visit the Grey family at Bradgate in 1696, the existing crossings of the Rothley Brook were found to be too narrow for the Royal coach, so a new bridge had to be constructed.

Anstey also has a GP surgery, dentist, funeral directors and opticians, and several fast food outlets and restaurants. Around The Nook there are a number of different shops, a post office, as well as pubs - The Coach and Horses, The Crown and The Old Hare and Hounds as well as a Conservative club. The Working men&#x27;s club closed in 2009 and The Plough pub in 2012.

In the past Anstey had two cinemas, the Savoy on Cropston Road which was later used as a petrol station/garage before being converted into a pub/restaurant and eventually a furnishings shop, and another on Ellis Street, which now sells wine.

===Local newspaper===
For many years, the village had its own newspaper, &quot;Anstey Scene&quot;, which was a quarterly with news about local events and council meetings. Other local publications included the &quot;Anstey Directory&quot; with advertisements for local businesses, including from the Birstall and Glenfield areas, and &quot;The Anstey Clarion&quot;, a monthly which took reader submitted articles. All of these have now ceased to publish. There is, however, a publication entitled &quot;Your Local&quot; which is published monthly.

===Local area===

Nearby Glenfield is the home of Leicestershire County Council, and all the shops and facilities of the city can be found about four miles (6 km) away in Leicester.

Castle Hill Park lies to the East of the village, connecting Anstey to Beaumont Leys and with the A46 Leicester Western Bypass running through it.

Bradgate Park, childhood home of Lady Jane Grey, stretches above the village, between the two neighbouring villages of Newtown Linford and Cropston. For transport, Anstey is served by regular bus services to Leicester and the Beaumont Shopping Centre (about a mile away in Beaumont Leys), and less regular services to Loughborough. By road, Anstey is just off the A46 Leicester Western Bypass, which provides a fast link to the M1 southbound to London, with the A50 providing access to the M1 North.

===Sport===
Anstey is home to Anstey Nomads Football Club who play in the East Midlands Counties League.

Prior to the Second World War there were two separate teams, the Methodist and St. Marys Parish Church football teams. However, following the War in 1947 the two teams merged and became Anstey Nomads. The ground, which is owned by the club, is situated on Cropston Road, Anstey. In addition to the Anstey Nomads there is the youth football team, Anstey Swifts. There also is another local football team, Anstey Town, who play in the Leicestershire Senior League.

There are also Rugby Union (Anstey RFC, formed 1980, who play on the Link Road playing fields) and Cricket teams, who play in the local leagues. Anstey and Glenfield CC play in the Leicestershire and Rutland Cricket League at Gynsill Lane playing field on the Anstey/Glenfield border, they have two senior teams playing in Division 6 and Division 8, one friendly XI playing numerous Sunday friendlies as of 2016. Anstey Narborians play on the recreation ground at Stadon Road, in the Leicestershire League.

Anstey has three recreation grounds - the main park (&quot;The Reccy&quot;) off Stadon Road which has facilities including floodlit multi play/tennis court area, swings, slides, football pitch and a small area for younger children. From May 2009 it has a kicking wall and shelter to the side of the Jubilee Hall (APC office) built by Anstey Parish council. There is a less well equipped one near Link Road which is occasionally used by the Anstey RFC. Millfield Close also has a small area with play equipment on, which is rented from Charnwood Borough Council.

===Ley lines===

Anstey and surrounding area have been mentioned in several texts about ley lines. Anstey has a standing stone and a place called &quot;The Leys&quot;, which marks the route of the &quot;Bradgate Ley&quot;, which runs between a notch in the hill near &quot;Old John&quot; in Bradgate Park, and Oadby.

===Transport===
Anstey is served by frequent buses on First Leicester service 74 with some infrequent buses running on Centrebus service 154 and Roberts Travel service 120.

The nearest network railway station is at Leicester.

<text>Ash-Shu‘ara’ (, ; The Poets) is the 26th chapter (sūrah) of the Qurʾan with 227 verses (āyāt). Many of these verses are very short. The chapter is named from the word Ash-Shu&#x27;ara in ayat 224. It is also the longest Meccan surah according to the number of verses.

The chapter talks about various prophets and their tribes, and how the disbelievers were destroyed after threatening the prophets with death. It also talks about the mercy of God (&quot;Allah&quot;). This surah starts with the story of Moses, followed by that of Abraham.

Regarding the timing and contextual background of the revelation (&quot;asbāb al-nuzūl&quot;), it is an earlier &quot;Meccan surah&quot;, which means it is believed to have been revealed in Mecca. The topic and the style appear, and the traditions affirm, that it was uncovered during the center Makkan period. As indicated by Ibn Abbas, Surah Ta-Ha was uncovered first, at that point Surah Al-Waqiah, and afterward Surah Ash-Shu&#x27;ara.

===214 Warning Verse===

==Exegesis==
The foundation of the chapter 26 is that the disbelievers of Makkah were in constant refusal to acknowledge the message of Islam given by Muhammad, stating that he did not provide evidence to support his claim to prophethood. They would mark him as a poet or a magician, mock his message and disparage his Mission. This situation was making incredible anguish and despondency for Muhammad.

The Chapter starts with uplifting statements to Muhammad, inferring, 
: For what reason do you fuss for their sake? If these individuals have not had believed in you, it is because they are stubborn, not the lack of signs for them. They will not yield to common sense they need to see a Sign which makes them bow their heads in inquietude. When this Sign appears at the appropriate time of time, they will themselves understand that what was being introduced to them was the Truth.

After this discourse, up to verse 191, very much the same topic has been introduced persistently, and it is stated: 
: The entire earth possesses large amounts of such Signs as can bring a truth-searcher to The Reality, yet the obstinate and misguided individuals have never accepted significantly in the wake of seeing the Signs, regardless of whether these were the Indications of the natural phenomena or the miracles of the Prophets. These pathetic individuals have determinedly clung to their wrong statements of faith till the Divine scourge really overwhelmed them.&quot;

==Hadith==
* It is narrated on the authority of Aisha that when this verse (Q26.214) was revealed: &quot; And warn thy nearest kindred,&quot; the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stood up on Safa and said: O Fatimah, daughter of Muhammad. O Safiyya bint Abd al-Muttalib, daughter of Abd al-Muttalib, O sons of &#x27;Abd al-Muttalib. Ask what you wish from my property, but I cannot save you from Allah (if you disobey Him).
* Narrated Ibn Abbas: When the Verse:-- &#x27;And warn your tribe of near kindred&#x27; (Q26.214). was revealed, the Prophet (ﷺ) started calling every tribe by its name, &quot;O Bani Fihr!, O Banu Adi!, O people of Quraysh!&quot;
* Narrated Ibn `Abbas: When the Verse:--&#x27;And warn your tribe of near-kindred (Q26.214), was revealed, the Prophet (ﷺ) ascended the Safa (mountain) and started calling, &quot;O Bani Fihr!, O Banu Adi!, O sons of Abd Manaf ibn Qusai! &quot; addressing various tribes of Quraysh till they were assembled. Those who could not come themselves, sent their messengers to see what was there. Abū Lahab and other people from Quraish came and the Prophet (ﷺ) then said, &quot;Suppose I told you that there is an (enemy) cavalry in the valley intending to attack you, would you believe me?&quot; They said, &quot;Yes, for we have not found you telling anything other than the truth.&quot; He then said, &quot;I am a warner to you in face of a terrific punishment.&quot; Abu Lahab said (to the Prophet) &quot;May your hands perish all this day. Is it for this purpose you have gathered us?&quot; Then it (surah Al-Masad) was revealed: &quot;Perish the hands of Abu Lahab (one of the Prophet&#x27;s uncles), and perish he! His wealth and his children will not profit him...&quot; (Q111.1–5)

<text>An-Naml () is the 27th chapter (&quot;sūrah&quot;) of the Qur&#x27;an with 93 verses (&quot;āyāt&quot;).

Regarding the timing and contextual background of the revelation (&quot;asbāb al-nuzūl&quot;), it is traditionally believed to be a Meccan surah, from the second Meccan period (615-619).

Sura 27 tells stories of the prophets Musa (Moses), Sulayman (Solomon), Saleh, and Lot (Arabic &quot;Lūṭ&quot;) to emphasize the message of tawhid (monotheism) in Arabian and Israelite prophets. The miracles of Moses, described in the Book of Exodus, are mentioned in opposition to the arrogance and kufr (disbelief) of the Pharaoh.

The story of Solomon is most detailed: Solomon converted Bilqis, Queen of Saba&#x27; (the Queen of Sheba) to the &quot;true religion&quot; after a hoopoe reported to him that she was a sun-worshipping queen. This sura was likely revealed to address the role of the &quot;Children of Israel&quot; among the believers in Mecca, to emphasize and commend the piety of past prophets, and to distinguish the present Qurʾānic message from traditions.

== Significance of title ==
The sura&#x27;s name is taken from the ants whose conversations were understood by Solomon. Similar to suras ar-Ra&#x27;d &quot;the Thunder&quot; or al-Ankabut &quot;the Spider&quot;, &quot;The Ants&quot; has no thematic significance in the Sura beyond it being a familiar phrase amongst believers, a reminder of the sura&#x27;s story of Solomon.

Ants do hold a privileged status among animals in Islam on account of the story of Solomon. Hadith literature tells of Muhammad forbidding Muslims to kill the ant, bee, hoopoe, or shrike; it is no coincidence that they are all featured in an-Naml and an-Nahl &quot;the Bee&quot;. One interpretation for the ant&#x27;s theological significance coincides with its role historically. As written in the 1993 edition of the Encyclopaedia of Islam:
== Main concepts ==
* &quot;Tawhid&quot; was preached by many Israelite prophets as well as Arabian prophets prior to Qur&#x27;anic revelation.
* &quot;Truly, this Qur&#x27;an explains to the Children of Israel most of what they differ about, and it is guidance and grace for those who believe.&quot;
* God has no equal as a creator; all those who associate others with God are guilty of shirk.
* Earthly knowledge is nothing compared to God; only those with open ears and eyes will turn to God.
* Disbelievers of the message of God will have no hope come Judgement Day.
* The revelation is a clear warning. Sura 27 reiterates that all humanity must turn to God without delay.

== Chronology ==
Sura 27 is agreed to be a Meccan surah from the middle of the Meccan period. &quot;Tafsir al-Jalalayn&quot; notes that some exceptions exist: ayat 52-55 are from the Medinan period; aya 85 was revealed during the Hijra to Medina.

=== Nöldeke&#x27;s Chronology ===
Orientalist Theodor Nöldeke&#x27;s chronology places Sura 27 as 68th out of 114. He places it amongst the 21 suras of the Second Meccan Period (See Muhammad in Mecca). (The Meccan period is estimated to be from 610 to 622 CE.) Nöldeke estimates an-Naml to be preceded by al-Isra&#x27; and followed by al-Kahf. All three suras use allusions to Judaism and the stories of Moses in particular.

=== Egyptian Chronology ===
Standard Islamic Egyptian chronology places an-Naml as 48th out of 114. In this order, it comes before al-Qasas &quot;the Story&quot; and after ash-Shu&#x27;ara &quot;the Poets&quot;, following its order in the standard &#x27;Uthmanic Qur&#x27;an (see History of the Qur&#x27;an). Amongst all three suras and all suras numbered between 19 and 32, the account of revelation begins with &quot;mysterious letters,&quot; the meaning of which is speculated among some and among others remains unknown; they are speculated to have been variant Arabic dialects. Sura 27 begins with the words &quot;Ta Sin.&quot; As evident in &quot;Tafsīr al-Jalālayn&quot;, these words are sometimes interpreted as mysteries of God – signs to believe.

== Structure ==
Sura 27, as a mid-Meccan Period sura, can be interpreted multiple ways in terms of structure. Thematically speaking, the sura progresses across several subjects:
# Declaration of Qur&#x27;an – (In Sura 27:1, the Qur&#x27;an refers to itself consciously as a scripture, meant to make all clear.)
# Moses&#x27;s Signs are ignored by the Pharaoh
# Solomon realizes God&#x27;s blessings and dedicates himself to God&#x27;s service.
# The Queen of Sheba deals well with Solomon and acts generously with him.
# The Queen of Sheba, one from disbelievers, converts and devotes herself to tawhid.
# The people of Thamud disregard the warnings of Salih; Lot is likewise rejected by his people. The disbelievers are thus destroyed for scheming.
# Declaration of God&#x27;s universality, omniscience, and omnipotence – The Sura&#x27;s phrasing condemns forgetting God&#x27;s omnipotence.
# Declaration of Abandonment of Disbelievers – Prophet is to wash his hands of them.
# Foretelling of Judgement (see Islamic view of the Last Judgment) and Indication of Signs.
# Reiteration of Qur&#x27;an&#x27;s purpose as a Warning.

=== Straight-forward interpretation ===
According to a chronological reading of the text, the Sura ends on a bold note of warning. This is a perfectly valid reading of the text. Tafsīr al-Jalālayn concurs with this reading, suggesting in reference to ayat 91-93 that the prophet&#x27;s duty is only to warn; the powerful, imminent tone expressed supports the conclusion that the final point of the Sura is the focal point.

=== Ring structure ===
Another valid reading of the text uses ring structure (see Chiastic structure). Favored in prominent modern scholar of Qur&#x27;anic studies Carl Ernst&#x27;s interpretations of certain middle to late Meccan period suras, it can be applied to Sura 27 as well. In ring structure, the focal point of the piece is found in the center, surrounded front and back by parallel statements. (Such parallel statements could elaborate on one another, contrast each other, or affirm one another. Multiple interpretations exist.) One could interpret Sura 27 as follows:

* 1. Declaration of Qur&#x27;an through a reiterative warning of its purpose.
* 2. Moses&#x27;s signs are ignored by Pharaoh.
* 3. An indication of signs with a foretelling of judgement.
* 4. Solomon, realizing God&#x27;s blessings, dedicates himself as a Believer.
* 5. The Queen of Sheba is generous with Solomon, and deals well with him. She converts from disbelief, then devotes herself to tawhid.
* 6. After rejecting their prophets, God destroys the Sodomites, and the people of Thamud, leading to a general declaration of abandonment for disbelievers.
* 7. The conclusive interpretation from ring structure: A rebuke of disbelief through a declaration of God&#x27;s omnipotence, omnipresence, and omniscience.

<text>Al-Qasas (, ; The Story) is the 28th chapter (&quot;sūrah&quot;) of the Qur&#x27;an with 88 verses (&quot;āyāt&quot;).

According to Ibn Kathir&#x27;s commentary, the chapter takes its name from verse 25 in which the word Al-Qasas occurs. Lexically, qasas means to relate events in their proper sequence. Thus, from the viewpoint of the meaning too, this word can be a suitable title for this Surah, for in it the detailed story of the Prophet Moses has been related, also it includes story of Qarun from verse 76 to verse 83, explaining how Qarun was proud of himself thinking that his huge wealth earned by his own science, denying the grace of God on him, and later God destroyed him with his wealth underground.

Regarding the timing and contextual background of the revelation (&quot;asbāb al-nuzūl&quot;), it is traditionally believed to be a Meccan surah, from the second Meccan period (615-619).

<text>The Spider (, ) is the 29th chapter (&quot;surah&quot;) of the Quran with 69 verses (&quot;āyāt&quot;).

Regarding the timing and contextual background of the revelation (&quot;asbāb al-nuzūl&quot;), it is a &quot;Meccan surah&quot;, which means it is believed to have been revealed in Mecca, instead of later in Medina. It was revealed around 2-3 years before Hijrah, in a later stage of Muhammad preaching in Mecca.

The surah states that Nuh, Ibrahim, Lut, Shuaib, Hud, Saleh, Musa and Muhammad all were prophets of God. All of them endured hardships. For example, Noah was ridiculed often and Abraham was thrown into the fire. But God destroyed their people who transgressed. Verse 40 says So each We punished for his sin; of them was he on whom We sent down a violent storm, and of them was he whom the rumbling overtook, and of them was he whom We made to be swallowed up by the earth, and of them was he whom We drowned; and it did not beseem Allah that He should be unjust to them, but they were unjust to their own souls.

*12-13 Unbelievers shall be punished for deceiving others by false promises
*14-15 The enemies of Noah drowned for their unbelief

*27-34 The story of Lot and his ministry in Sodom
*35-36 Shuaib&#x27;s ministry to the unbelieving Madianites

==Parable of the spider&#x27;s house==
Mustafa Khattab, author of the Clear Quran, notes that &quot;Externally, the web is too flimsy to protect the spider against rain and strong wind. Internally, the spider’s family structure is fragile, since some species are cannibalistic, with the female preying on the male and the young eating their own mother.&quot;

From Tafsir Ibn Kathir: 

&quot;This is how Allah described the idolators in their reverence of gods besides Him, hoping that they would help them and provide for them, and turning to them in times of difficulties. In this regard, they were like the house of a spider, which is so weak and frail, because by clinging to these gods they were like a person who holds on to a spider&#x27;s web, who does not gain any benefit from that. If they knew this, they would not take any protectors besides Allah. This is unlike the Muslim believer, whose heart is devoted to Allah, yet he still does righteous deeds and follows the Laws of Allah, for he has grasped the most trustworthy handle that will never break because it is so strong and firm.&quot;

<text>Ray Lee Hunt (born 1943) is an American billionaire heir and businessman.

== Early life ==
Hunt is the son of the late H. L. Hunt (1889–1974), founder of Hunt Oil Co. His parents married in 1957. Hunt&#x27;s sisters include June Hunt, Swanee Hunt, and Helen LaKelly Hunt.

== Education ==
Hunt is a graduate of Southern Methodist University in the Dallas enclave of University Park, Texas.

== Career ==
After his father&#x27;s death in 1974, he inherited Hunt Oil Co. and the remains of the General American Oil Company along with his three sisters. In 1982, &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine estimated Ray Hunt&#x27;s family&#x27;s total net worth to be $200 million. In 2006 &quot;Forbes&quot; estimated that Ray&#x27;s family&#x27;s net worth increased from $200 million to $4.6 billion.

In September 2007, Hunt struck an oil deal with the Kurdistan Regional Government in the disputed territories of Ninewa near the Dohuk Governorate with an estimated value of $8 to $14.5 billion. The federal Iraqi Oil minister has denounced this deal as illegal, because under current Iraqi law only the central government is authorized to enter into contracts, though the Kurdistan Region believes it has a constitutional right to do so. The Kurds refuse to share details about the deal but insist that they will share profits. Likewise, Hunt Oil has refused to answer questions about the deal from US government officials who called for details when the deal became public. A U.S. Congressional committee concluded that George W. Bush administration officials knew that Hunt oil was planning to sign the oil deal with the regional Kurdistan Regional Government that ran counter to American policy and undercut Iraq&#x27;s central government. The issue is still open and the State Department&#x27;s Office of Inspector General is reviewing the issue.

In November 2009, native Peruvians under the coalition of the Native Federation of the Rio Madre de Dios, (FENAMAD), issued an eviction notice to Ray Hunt and the Hunt Oil Company from the Amarakaeri Communal Reserve. In the letter FENAMAD wrote, &quot;Having peacefully exhausted all protest, without receiving any answer, we hereby communicate to you that we have agreed to a fifteen-day period for you to definitively withdraw from the Amarakaeria Communal Reserve since you do not have the indigenous community&#x27;s consent.&quot; A press release issued by Amazon Watch stated that &quot;The Reserve was first established in 2002 after years of indigenous petitioning to protect the rainforest area of the vast Madre de Dios and Karene watersheds and to provide protected zones for the Harakmbut indigenous peoples to live, fish, and hunt. The area in dispute, besides being a declared nature reserve, crosses the headwaters of several important river basins, and lies in the buffer zones of Manu and Bahuaja Sonene National Parks, two of the most biodiverse national parks in the world.&quot;

He is the former owner of the Southwest Media Corporation of Texas which published &quot;D Magazine&quot;, &quot;Houston City Magazine&quot;, &quot;Texas Homes&quot; and &quot;Sport Magazine&quot;.

==Political donations==
Hunt was a major supporter of former President of the United States George W. Bush and a member of the President&#x27;s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board. He serves on the Board of Trustees of his alma mater, SMU, and of the George W. Bush Presidential Center. In 2015, Hunt and his wife donated $2 million to a Super PAC supporting the presidential candidacy of Jeb Bush.

== Other donations ==
Hunt is also a major donor to the SMU athletic program. He was one of a group of roughly 15 boosters who played a major role in the university&#x27;s impending 2024 move from the American Athletic Conference to the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). The group&#x27;s members committed to making athletic donations large enough to allow the school to forego any ACC media revenue for its first nine years as an ACC member.

<text>Ray Hunt (August 31, 1929 – March 12, 2009) was an American horse trainer and clinician of significant influence in the natural horsemanship field. He had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

== Natural horsemanship ==
Hunt is widely regarded as one of the original proponents of what became known as natural horsemanship. His views on horse-human relations were embraced by inspirational writers on human relations. Lance Secretan wrote, &quot;We may respect a leader, but the ones we love are servant-leaders.&quot; In the beginning, Hunt said, &quot;I was working in the mind of a lot of people who didn&#x27;t want to believe the horse had a mind. Get a bigger bit. Get a bigger stick. That was their approach.&quot;

Ray Hunt is said to be Tom Dorrance&#x27;s best-known student. They met around 1960, at a fair in Elko, Nevada. While Dorrance avoided media attention and clinics, by the mid-1970s, Hunt was giving clinics far and wide. Ray Hunt is famous for starting each clinic with the statement, &quot;I&#x27;m here for the horse, to help him get a better deal.&quot; He also liked to say, &quot;Make the wrong thing difficult and the right thing easy.&quot; His philosophy has been interpreted as, &quot;If you get bucked off or kicked or bitten, you obviously did something wrong... The horse, on the other hand, is never wrong.&quot;

The idea that &quot;the horse is never wrong&quot; is often misunderstood by people who think Ray was talking about the horse&#x27;s behaviour, he was rather meaning the horse&#x27;s reaction to human behaviour. The horse always interprets human actions in the moment, they don&#x27;t think about the past or future in the way that people do. So, their reactions to what is happening in the moment is always pure, they reflect what the human did with the utmost integrity. If we want to change the horse, we should first change ourselves. As Ray said &quot;it&#x27;s easy to change the horse, but it&#x27;s hard to change the human&quot;.

Ray Hunt was a mentor and teacher of Buck Brannaman.

<text>Autocars Co. Ltd. () of Haifa, Israel, was Israel&#x27;s first car manufacturer.

==History==
Autocars Ltd, founded in 1957, made fiberglass-shelled cars that were popular in Israel during the 1960s and 1970s. Government agencies were forced to buy them. This released onto the market thousands of low-priced second hand vehicles. Although their style and finish left something to be desired, Autocar&#x27;s use of Ford and Triumph engines made them reliable cars which kept their value for years. The manufacturing of these cars ceased during the 1980s, and Israel&#x27;s only remaining car making company today is AIL.

Autocars manufactured its own car models under the Sabra (Hebrew: צברה) brand. The line included a station wagon, pick-up and the Sabra Sport, a sport car derived from Reliant.

From 1960, the sport model was produced under the Sabra brand, and the station wagon, sedan and pick-up models were produced under the Sussita brand name (Sussita (סוסיתא), Sussita 12 and Sussita 13/60 models).
Following an agreement with the Greek automotive manufacturer Attica, a small number of Sussita 12 sedans (Carmel) were produced in Greece.

Apart from its own brand, Autocars also assembled other car manufacturers’ models, such as Reliant Regal, and Triumph 1300 / 1500. These models were built using complete kits received from the brands owners.

== Models for the Israeli market ==

Sussita (A.K.A &quot;Cube&quot;) - manufactured from 1960 till 1966. 2 doors station wagon and pick-up versions. Designed with the help of the British Reliant company. The car was built using various Ford&#x27;s parts, mainly the Ford Anglia engine. 

Carmel - manufactured from 1962 till 1964. A clone of the British three wheeler Reliant Regal, that was modified to have 4 wheels. The model had many problems, and was discontinued. The Carmel label was later given to next generations of the Sussita sedans.

Sussita 12 - manufactured from 1964 till 1970. Body versions:2 doors station wagon, 2 doors sedan (A.K.A Carmel), 4 doors sedan (A.K.A Gilboa) and pick-up versions. Till 1968 the Sussita 12 used the Ford Anglia engines, where the Gilboa had an optional 1500cc Ford&#x27;s engine. From 1968 to 1970 the station wagon and sedans (Carmel and Gilboa), used the Triumph Herald 12/50 engine.

Sussita 13/60 - manufactured from 1970 till 1975. 2 doors station wagon, 2 doors sedan (A.K.A Carmel Ducas), and pick-up versions. 4 door sedan was not produced. The Sussita 13/60 was built on the British Triumph Herald&#x27;s chassis, and used the Herald 13/60 engine and gearbox.

Autocars assembled several car models of other manufactures, using complete kits received from them. For example:

Triumph 1300 / Triumph 1500 - British Triumph cars from kits in the late 1960s. The Triumph lineup included the Triumph 1300, although originally only with a 1500 engine as the 1300 was considered too close to the 1.3 litre Hino Contessa. 

Hino Contesa 900 / Hino Contesa 1300 - Assembled from original kits received from Hino Japan. The franchise, to assemble the Contessa, moved in 1969 from Eilin to Autocars, after the Israeli government forced the merger of the two companies. The contract was discontinued when Toyota had taken over Hino.

Autocars went bankrupt in 1970. Its assembly lines were bought by Rom Carmel Industries. Rom Carmel continued to manufacture the Sussita 13/60, till 1975. Rom Carmel manufactured their own models: Rom Carmel 1300, and Rom Carmel 1301, till 1980.

== Sabra ==
The name &quot;Sabra&quot; was chosen because it means both &quot;born in Israel&quot; and a cactus (its fruit, prickly pear), which was used as its logo. In 1960, Yitzhak Shubinsky launched an Israeli-made car at the autoshow in New York City. It was a very small, underpowered pick-up truck. At the show Shubinsky realized that it was a futile attempt, and set forth on a new project.

He bought the rights to use an Ashley body on a Leslie Ballamy chassis. He reached an agreement with Reliant (who had helped producing the &quot;Carmel&quot; and the &quot;Sussita&quot;) to combine engine, body and chassis into a convertible sports-car. The engine was a Ford 1703 cc. Reliant was authorized to deliver the first 100 cars to the United States market.

In 1961, at the New York Autoshow, the first Sabras were introduced. Reliant produced the first 100 cars. Their VIN-plates read &quot;AUTOCARS COMPANY LIMITED HAIFA ISRAEL&quot;, though they were actually made in the United Kingdom. The rest of the cars were produced in Israel, but only 41 of those were exported to the USA. One of these was entered into the 12 Hours of Sebring in 1963 but did not finish due to a drive shaft failure.

Between 1964 and 1968, some 81 cars – a quarter of the Israeli production – were exported to Belgium. Production stopped with the Six-Day War. Orders already placed were honoured, but delivery was delayed until 1968–69. Worldwide, over 100 Sabra cars are still traceable, over twenty of them in Belgium.

The Sabra can also be seen on a record cover of the Israeli band צמד דרום.

<text>Frederick Field (born 1953) is an American business man. He is heir to Marshall Field who founded the Marshall Field and Company of department stores. He has investments in an entertainment company called Interscope Records.

1984 saw a consortium led by Field pay $52.5million for Panavision, the famous movie camera and lens manufacturer then based in Tarzana California. Although the purchase was initially a management buyout of Panavision from Warner Communications, Field soon took full control of the company. Then in 1987 Field sold Panavision for a considerable profit to a London based film services company Lee International PLC. Lee paid Field $100 million for the camera manufacturer and they assumed liability for Panavision&#x27;s debt which was around $47 million.

<doc id="1345074" wikidata="Q129228" url="?curid=1345074" title="René Girard">
<text>René Noël Théophile Girard (; ; 25 December 1923 – 4 November 2015) was a French historian, literary critic, and philosopher of social science whose work belongs to the tradition of philosophical anthropology. Girard was the author of nearly thirty books, with his writings spanning many academic domains. Although the reception of his work is different in each of these areas, there is a growing body of secondary literature on his work and his influence on disciplines such as literary criticism, critical theory, anthropology, theology, mythology, sociology, economics, cultural studies, and philosophy.

Girard&#x27;s main contribution to philosophy, and in turn to other disciplines, was in the psychology of desire. Girard claimed that human desire functions imitatively, or mimetically, rather than arising as the spontaneous byproduct of human individuality, as much of theoretical psychology had assumed. Girard proposed that human development proceeds triangularly from a model of desire that indicates some object of desire as desirable by desiring it themselves. We copy this desire for the object of the model and appropriate it as our own, most often without recognizing that the source of this desire comes from another apart from ourselves completing the triangle of mimetic desire. This process of appropriation of desire includes (but is not limited to) identity formation, the transmission of knowledge and social norms, and material aspirations which all have their origin in copying the desires of others who we take, consciously or unconsciously, as models for desire.

The second major proposition of the mimetic theory proceeds from considering the consequences of the mimetic nature of desire as it relates to human origins and anthropology. The mimetic nature of desire allows for the anthropological success of human beings through social learning but is also laden with potential for violent escalation. If the subject desires an object simply because another subject desires it, then their desires are bound to converge on the same objects. If these objects cannot be easily shared (food, mates, territory, prestige and status, etc.), then the subjects are bound to come into mimetically intensifying conflict over these objects. The simplest solution to this problem of violence for early human communities was to polarize blame and hostility onto one member of the group who would be killed and interpreted as the source of conflict and hostility within the group. The transition from the violent conflict of all-against-all would be transformed into the unifying and pacifying violence of all-except-one whose death would reconcile the community together. The victim who was persecuted as the source of disorder would then become venerated as the source of order and meaning for the community and seen as a god. This process of engendering and making possible human community through arbitrary victimization is called, within mimetic theory, the scapegoat mechanism.

Eventually, the scapegoat mechanism would be exposed within the Biblical texts which categorically reorient the position of the Divinity to be on the side of the victim as opposed to that of the persecuting community. Girard argues that all other myths, such as Romulus and Remus, for example, are written and constructed from the point of view of the community whose legitimacy depends on the guilt of the victim in order to be brought together as a unified community. Once the relative innocence of the victim is exposed, the scapegoat mechanism is no longer able to function as a vehicle for generating unity and peace. The categorical moral innocence of Christ therefore serves to reveal the scapegoating mechanism in scripture, thus enabling the possibility that humanity might overcome it by learning to discern its continued presence in our interactions today.

==Early life==
Girard was born in Avignon on 25 December 1923. René Girard was the second son of historian Joseph Girard.

He studied medieval history at the École des Chartes, Paris, where the subject of his thesis was &quot;Private life in Avignon in the second half of the 15th century&quot; (&quot;&quot;). 

In 1947, Girard went to Indiana University Bloomington on a one-year fellowship. He was to spend most of his career in the United States. He received his PhD in 1950 and stayed at Indiana University until 1953. The subject of his PhD at Indiana University was &quot;American Opinion of France, 1940–1943&quot;. Although his research was in history, he was also assigned to teach French literature, the field in which he would first make his reputation as a literary critic by publishing influential essays on such authors as Albert Camus and Marcel Proust.

==Career==
Girard occupied positions at Duke University and Bryn Mawr College from 1953 to 1957, after which he moved to Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, where he became a full professor in 1961. In that year, he also published his first book: (&quot;Deceit, Desire and the Novel&quot;, 1966). For several years, he moved back and forth between the State University of New York at Buffalo and Johns Hopkins University. Books he published in this period include (1972; &quot;Violence and the Sacred&quot;, 1977) and (1978; &quot;Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World&quot;, 1987).

In 1966, as the Chair of the Romance Languages Department at Johns Hopkins, Girard helped Richard A. Macksey, the Director of the newly founded Humanities Center, to organize a colloquium on French thought. The event was titled &quot;The Languages of Criticism and the Sciences of Man&quot; and was held from 18 to 21 October 1966. Featuring prominent French academics such as Jacques Lacan, Roland Barthes, and Jacques Derrida, it is often credited with having launched the post-structuralist movement.

In 1981, Girard became Andrew B. Hammond Professor of French Language, Literature, and Civilization at Stanford University, where he stayed until his retirement in 1995. During this period, he published (1982), (1985), &quot;A Theatre of Envy: William Shakespeare&quot; (1991) and (1994).

In 1985, he received his first honorary degree from the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam in the Netherlands; several others followed.

In 1990, a group of scholars founded the Colloquium on Violence and Religion (COV&amp;R) with the goal to &quot;explore, criticize, and develop the mimetic model of the relationship between violence and religion in the genesis and maintenance of culture.&quot; This organization organizes a yearly conference devoted to topics related to mimetic theory, scapegoating, violence, and religion. Girard was Honorary Chair of COV&amp;R. Co-founder and first president of the COV&amp;R was the Roman Catholic theologian Raymund Schwager.

René Girard&#x27;s work has inspired interdisciplinary research projects and experimental research such as the Mimetic Theory project sponsored by the John Templeton Foundation.

On 17 March 2005, Girard was elected to the Académie française.

==Girard&#x27;s thought==
===Mimetic desire===

After almost a decade of teaching French literature in the United States, Girard began to develop a new way of speaking about literary texts. Beyond the &quot;uniqueness&quot; of individual works, he looked for their common structural properties, having observed that characters in great fiction evolved in a system of relationships otherwise common to the wider generality of novels. But there was a distinction to be made:

Girard saw Proust&#x27;s “psychological laws” mirrored in reality. These laws and this system are the consequences of a fundamental reality grasped by the novelists, which Girard called mimetic desire, &quot;the mimetic character of desire.&quot; This is the content of his first book, &quot;Deceit, Desire and the Novel&quot; (1961). We borrow our desires from others. Far from being autonomous, our desire for a certain object is always provoked by the desire of another person—the model—for this same object. This means that the relationship between the subject and the object is not direct: but unrolls within a triangular relationship of subject, model, and object. Through the model, one is drawn to the object.

In fact, it is the model, the mediator who is sought. This search is called &quot;mediation.&quot;

Girard calls desire &quot;metaphysical&quot; in the measure that, as soon as a desire is something more than a simple need or appetite, &quot;all desire is a desire to be&quot;, it is an aspiration, the dream of a fullness attributed to the mediator.

Mediation is called &quot;external&quot; when the mediator of the desire is socially beyond the reach of the subject or, for example, a fictional character, as in the case of Amadis de Gaula and Don Quixote. The hero lives a kind of folly that nonetheless remains optimistic.

Mediation is called &quot;internal&quot; when the mediator is at the same level as the subject. The mediator then transforms into a rival and an obstacle to the acquisition of the object, whose value increases as rivalry grows.
This is the universe of the novels of Stendhal, Flaubert, Proust and Dostoevsky, which are particularly studied in this book.

Through their characters, our own behaviour is displayed. Everyone holds firmly to the illusion of the authenticity of one&#x27;s own desires; the novelists implacably expose all the diversity of lies, dissimulations, manoeuvres, and the snobbery of the Proustian heroes; these are all but &quot;tricks of desire&quot;, which prevent one from facing the truth: envy and jealousy. These characters, desiring the being of the mediator, project upon him superhuman virtues while at the same time depreciating themselves, making him a god while making themselves slaves, in the measure that the mediator is an obstacle to them. Some, pursuing this logic, come to seek the failures that are the signs of the proximity of the ideal to which they aspire. This can manifest as a heightened experience of the universal pseudo-masochism inherent in seeking the unattainable, which can, of course, turn into sadism should the actor play this part in reverse.

This fundamental focus on mimetic desire would be pursued by Girard throughout the rest of his career. The stress on imitation in humans was not a popular subject when Girard developed his theories, but today there is independent support for his claims coming from empirical research in psychology and neuroscience (see below). Farneti (2013) also discusses the role of mimetic desire in intractable conflicts, using the case study of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and referencing Girard&#x27;s theory. He posits that intensified conflict is a product of the imitative behaviours of Israelis and Palestinians, entitling them &quot;Siamese twins&quot;.

The idea that the desire to possess endless material wealth was harmful to society was not new. From the New Testament verses about the love of money being the root of all kinds of evil, to Hegelian and Marxist critique that saw material wealth and capital as the mechanism of alienation of the human being both from their own humanity and their community, to Bertrand Russell&#x27;s famous speech on accepting the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1950, desire has been understood as a destructive force in all of literature – with the theft of Helen by Paris a frequent topic of discussion by Girard.

What Girard contributed to this concept is the idea that what is desired fundamentally is not the object itself, but the ontological state of the subject which possesses it, where &quot;mimicry&quot; is the aim of the competition. What Paris wanted, then, was not Helen, but to be a great king like Menelaus or Agamemnon.

A person desires to be like the subject he imitates through the medium of the object that is possessed by the person he imitates. Girard claims: 
This was, and remains, a pessimistic view of human life, as it posits a paradox in the very act of seeking to unify and have peace, since the erasure of differences between people through mimicry is what creates conflict, not the differentiation itself.

===Fundamental anthropology===

Since the mimetic rivalry that develops from the struggle for the possession of the objects is contagious, it leads to the threat of violence. Girard himself says, &quot;If there is a normal order in societies, it must be the fruit of an anterior crisis.&quot; Turning his interest towards the anthropological domain, Girard began to study anthropological literature and proposed his second great hypothesis: the scapegoat mechanism, which is at the origin of archaic religion and which he sets forth in his second book &quot;Violence and the Sacred&quot; (1972), a work on fundamental anthropology.

If two individuals desire the same thing, there will soon be a third, then a fourth. This process quickly snowballs. Since from the beginning desire is aroused by the other (and not by the object) the object is soon forgotten and the mimetic conflict transforms into a general antagonism. At this stage of the crisis the antagonists will no longer imitate each other&#x27;s desires for an object, but each other&#x27;s antagonism. They wanted to share the same object, but now they want to destroy the same enemy.

So, a paroxysm of violence will then focus on an arbitrary victim and a unanimous antipathy would, mimetically, grow against him. The brutal elimination of the victim will reduce the appetite for violence that possessed everyone a moment before, and leave the group, suddenly appeased and calm. The victim lies before the group, appearing simultaneously as the origin of the crisis and as the one responsible for this miracle of renewed peace. 
He becomes sacred, that is to say the bearer of the prodigious power of defusing the crisis and bringing peace back.

Girard believes this to be the genesis of archaic religion, that is, ritual sacrifice as the repetition of the original event, of myth as an account of this event, of the taboos that forbid access to all the objects at the origin of the rivalries that degenerated into this absolutely traumatizing crisis. This religious elaboration takes place gradually over the course of the repetition of the mimetic crises whose resolution brings only temporary peace. 
The elaboration of the rites and of the taboos constitutes a kind of &quot;empirical&quot; knowledge about violence.

Explorers and anthropologists have never been able to witness or bring true evidence for events similar to these, which go back to the earliest times. Yet &#x27;indirect evidence&#x27; can be found, such as the universality of ritual sacrifice and the innumerable myths that have been collected from the most varied peoples. If Girard&#x27;s theory is true, then we will find in myths the culpability of the victim-god, depictions of the selection of the victim and his power to beget the order that governs the group.

Girard found these elements in numerous myths, beginning with that of Oedipus which he analyzed in this and later books. On this question he opposes Claude Lévi-Strauss.

The phrase &quot;scapegoat mechanism&quot; was not coined by Girard himself; it had been used earlier by Kenneth Burke in &quot;Permanence and Change&quot; (1935) and &quot;A Grammar of Motives&quot; (1940). However, Girard took this concept from Burke and developed it much more extensively as an interpretation of human culture.

In &quot;Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World&quot; (1978), Girard develops the implications of this discovery. The victimary process is the missing link between the animal world and the human world, the principle that explains the humanization of primates.

It allows us to understand the need for sacrificial victims, which in turn explains the hunt which is primitively ritual and the domestication of animals as a fortuitous result of the acclimatization of a reserve of victims, or agriculture. It shows that at the beginning of all culture is archaic religion, which Durkheim had sensed. The elaboration of the rites and taboos by proto-human or human groups would take infinitely varied forms while obeying a rigorous practical sense that we can detect: the prevention of the return of the mimetic crisis. So we can find in archaic religion the origin of all political or cultural institutions.

The social position of king, for instance, begins as the victim of the scapegoat mechanism, though his sacrifice is deferred and he becomes responsible for the wellbeing of the whole society.

According to Girard, just as the theory of natural selection of species is the rational principle that explains the immense diversity of forms of life, the victimization process is the rational principle that explains the origin of the infinite diversity of cultural forms.

The analogy with Charles Darwin also extends to the scientific status of the theory, as each of these presents itself as a hypothesis that is not capable of being proven experimentally, given the extreme amounts of time necessary for the production of the phenomena in question, but which imposes itself by its great explanatory power.

===Origin of language===
According to Girard, the origin of language is also related to scapegoating. After the first victim, after the murder of the first scapegoat, there were the first prohibitions and rituals, but these came into being before representation and language, hence before culture. And that means that &quot;people&quot; (perhaps not human beings) &quot;will not start fighting again.&quot; Girard says:
According to Girard, the substitution of an immolated victim for the first, is &quot;the very first symbolic sign created by the hominids.&quot; Girard also says this is the first time that one thing represents another thing, standing in the place of this (absent) one.

This substitution is the beginning of representation and language and also the beginning of sacrifice and ritual. The genesis of language and ritual is very slow and we must imagine that there are also kinds of rituals among the animals: &quot;It is the originary scapegoating which prolongs itself in a process which can be infinitely long in moving from, how should I say, from instinctive ritualization, instinctive prohibition, instinctive separation of the antagonists, which you already find to a certain extent in animals, towards representation.&quot;

Unlike Eric Gans, Girard does not think that there is an original scene during which there is &quot;a sudden shift from non-representation to representation,&quot; or a sudden shift from animality to humanity.

According to the French sociologist Camille Tarot, it is hard to understand how the process of representation (i.e., symbolicity and language) actually occurs and he has called this a &quot;black box&quot; in Girard&#x27;s theory.

Girard also says:
===Judeo-Christian scriptures===
====Biblical text as a science of man====
In &quot;Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World&quot;, Girard discusses for the first time Christianity and the Bible. The Gospels ostensibly present themselves as a typical mythical account, with a victim-God lynched by a unanimous crowd, an event that is then commemorated by Christians through ritual sacrifice — a material re-presentation in this case — in the Eucharist. The parallel is perfect except for one detail: the truth of the innocence of the Victim is proclaimed by the text and the writer.

The mythical account is usually built on the lie of the guilt of the victim in as much as it is an account of the event seen from the viewpoint of the anonymous lynchers. This ignorance is indispensable to the efficacy of sacrificial violence.

The evangelic &quot;good news&quot; clearly affirms the innocence of the victim, thus becoming, by attacking ignorance, the germ of the destruction of the sacrificial order on which the equilibrium of societies rests. Already the Old Testament shows this turning inside-out of the mythic accounts with regard to the innocence of the victims (Abel, Joseph, Job...), and the Hebrews were conscious of the uniqueness of their religious tradition.

Girard draws special attention to passages in the Book of Isaiah, which describe the suffering of the Servant of the Lord God at the hands of the entire community who emphasize his innocence (Isaiah 53, 2–9).By oppression and judgement he was taken away;

And as for his generation, who considered

That he was cut off from out of the land of the living,

Stricken for the transgression of my people?

And they made his grave with the wicked

And with a rich man in his death,

Although he had done no violence,

And there was no deceit in his mouth. (Isaiah 53, 8–9)In the Gospels, the &quot;things hidden since the foundation of the world&quot; (Matthew 13:35) are unveiled with full clarity: the foundation of social order on murder, described in all its repulsive ugliness in the account of the Passion.

This revelation is even clearer because the whole text is a work on desire and violence, from the desire of Eve in paradise to the prodigious strength of the mimetism that brings about the denial of Peter at Pesach (Mark 14: 66–72; Luke 22:54–62).

Girard reinterprets certain biblical expressions in light of his theories; for instance, he sees &quot;scandal&quot; (&quot;skandalon&quot;, literally, a &quot;snare&quot;, or an &quot;impediment placed in the way and causing one to stumble or fall&quot;) as signifying mimetic rivalry, as in Peter&#x27;s denial of Jesus. No one escapes responsibility, neither the envious nor the envied: &quot;Woe to the man through whom scandal comes&quot; (Matthew 18:7).

====Christian society====
The evangelical revelation contains the truth on the violence, available for two thousand years, Girard tells us. Has it put an end to the sacrificial order based on violence in the society that has claimed the gospel text as its own religious text? No, he replies, for in order for a truth to have an impact it must find a receptive listener, and people do not change quickly. The gospel text has instead acted as a ferment that brings about the decomposition of the sacrificial order. While medieval Europe showed the face of a sacrificial society that still knew very well how to despise and ignore its victims, nonetheless the efficacy of sacrificial violence has never stopped decreasing, in the measure that ignorance receded. Here Girard sees the principle of the uniqueness and of the transformations of the Western society whose destiny today is one with that of human society as a whole.

Does the retreat of the sacrificial order mean less violence? Not at all; rather, it deprives modern societies of most of the capacity of sacrificial violence to establish temporary order. The &quot;innocence&quot; of the time of the ignorance is no more. On the other hand, Christianity, following the example of Judaism, has desacralized the world, making possible a utilitarian relationship with nature. Increasingly threatened by the resurgence of mimetic crises on a grand scale, the contemporary world is on one hand more quickly caught up by its guilt, and on the other hand has developed such a great technical power of destruction that it is condemned to both more and more responsibility and less and less innocence. So, for example, while empathy for victims manifests progress in the moral conscience of society, it nonetheless also takes the form of a competition among victims that threatens an escalation of violence. Girard is critical of the optimism of humanist observers, who believe in the natural goodness of man and the progressive improvement of his historical conditions (views themselves based in a misunderstanding of the Christian revelation). Rather, the current nuclear stalemate between the great powers reveals that man&#x27;s capacity for violence is greater than ever before, and peace is only a product of this possibility to unleash apocalyptic destruction.

==Influence==
===Economics and globalization===
The mimetic theory has also been applied in the study of economics, most notably in (1982) by Michel Aglietta and André Orléan. Orléan was also a contributor to the volume &quot;René Girard&quot; in &quot;Les cahiers de l&#x27;Herne&quot; (&quot;&quot;). According to the philosopher of technology Andrew Feenberg:
In an interview with the &quot;Unesco Courier&quot;, anthropologist and social theorist Mark Anspach (editor of the &quot;René Girard&quot; issue of &quot;Les Cahiers de l&#x27;Herne&quot;) explains that Aglietta and Orléan (who were very critical of economic rationality) see the classical theory of economics as a myth. According to Anspach, the vicious circle of violence and vengeance generated by mimetic rivalry gives rise to the gift economy, as a means to overcome it and achieve peaceful reciprocity: &quot;Instead of waiting for your neighbour to come steal your yams, you offer them to him today, and it is up to him to do the same for you tomorrow. Once you have made a gift, he is obliged to make a return gift. Now you have set in motion a positive circularity.&quot; Since the gift may be so large as to be humiliating, a second stage of development—&quot;economic rationality&quot;—is required: this liberates the seller and the buyer of any other obligations than to give money. Thus reciprocal violence is eliminated by the sacrifice, obligations of vengeance by the gift, and finally the possibly dangerous gift by &quot;economic rationality.&quot; This rationality, however, creates new victims, as globalization is increasingly revealing.

===Literature===
Girard&#x27;s influence extends beyond philosophy and social science, and includes the literary realm. A prominent example of a fiction writer influenced by Girard is J. M. Coetzee, winner of the 2003 Nobel Prize in Literature. Critics have noted that mimetic desire and scapegoating are recurring themes in Coetzee&#x27;s novels &quot;Elizabeth Costello&quot; and &quot;Disgrace.&quot; In the latter work, the book&#x27;s protagonist also gives a speech about the history of scapegoating with noticeable similarities to Girard&#x27;s view of the same subject. Coetzee has also frequently cited Girard in his non-fiction essays, on subjects ranging from advertising to the Russian writer Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn.

===Theology===
Theologians who describe themselves as indebted to Girard include James Alison (who focuses on mimetic desire&#x27;s implications for the doctrine of original sin), and Raymund Schwager (who builds a dramatic narrative around both the scapegoat mechanism and the theo-drama of fellow Swiss theologian Hans Urs von Balthasar).

==Criticism==
===Originality===
Some critics have pointed out that while Girard may be the first to have suggested that &quot;all&quot; desire is mimetic, he is by no means the first to have noticed that &quot;some&quot; desire is mimetic – Gabriel Tarde&#x27;s book &quot;Les lois de l&#x27;imitation&quot; (&quot;The Laws of Imitation&quot;) appeared in 1890. Building on Tarde, crowd psychology, Nietzsche, and more generally on a modernist tradition of the &quot;mimetic unconscious&quot; that had hypnosis as its via regia, Nidesh Lawtoo argued that for the modernists not only desire but all affects turn out to be contagious and mimetic. René Pommier mentions La Rochefoucauld, a seventeenth-century thinker who already wrote that &quot;Nothing is so infectious as example&quot; and that &quot;There are some who never would have loved if they never had heard it spoken of.&quot;

Stéphane Vinolo sees Baruch Spinoza and Thomas Hobbes as important precursors. Hobbes: &quot;if any two men desire the same thing, which nevertheless they cannot both enjoy, they become enemies.&quot; Spinoza: &quot;By the very fact that we conceive a thing, which is like ourselves, and which we have not regarded with any emotion, to be affected with any emotion, we are ourselves affected with a like emotion. Proof… If we conceive anyone similar to ourselves as affected by any emotion, this conception will express a modification of our body similar to that emotion.&quot;

 adds Alexis de Tocqueville to the list. &quot;Two hundred years after Hobbes, the French historian Alexis de Tocqueville mentioned the dangers coming along with equality, too. Like Hobbes, he refers to the increase of mimetic desire coming along with equality.&quot; Palaver has in mind passages like this one, from Tocqueville&#x27;s &quot;Democracy in America&quot;: &quot;They have swept away the privileges of some of their fellow creatures which stood in their way, but they have opened the door to universal competition; the barrier has changed its shape rather than its position.&quot;

Maurizio Meloni highlights the similarities between Girard, Jacques Lacan and Sigmund Freud. Meloni claims that these similarities arise because the projects undertaken by the three men—namely, to understand the role of mythology in structuring the human psyche and culture—were very similar. What is more, both Girard and Lacan read these myths through the lens of structural anthropology so it is not surprising that their intellectual systems came to resemble one another so strongly. Meloni writes that Girard and Lacan were &quot;moved by similar preoccupations and are fascinated by and attracted to the same kind of issues: the constituent character of the other in the structure of desire, the role of jealousy and rivalry in the construction of the social bond, the proliferation of triangles within apparently dual relations, doubles and mirrors, imitation and the Imaginary, and the crisis of modern society within which the &#x27;rite of Oedipus&#x27; is situated.&quot;

At times, Girard acknowledges his indebtedness to such precursors, including Tocqueville. At other times, however, Girard makes stronger claims to originality, as when he says that mimetic rivalry &quot;is responsible for the frequency and intensity of human conflicts, but strangely, no one ever speaks of it.&quot;

===Use of evidence===
Girard has presented his view as being scientifically grounded: &quot;Our theory should be approached, then, as one approaches any scientific hypothesis.&quot; René Pommier has written a book about Girard with the ironic title &quot;Girard Ablaze Rather Than Enlightened&quot; in which he asserts that Girard&#x27;s readings of myths and Bible stories—the basis of some of his most important claims—are often tendentious. Girard notes, for example, that the disciples actively turn against Jesus. Since Peter warms himself by a fire, and fires always create community, and communities breed mimetic desire, this means that Peter becomes actively hostile to Jesus, seeking his death. According to Pommier, Girard claims that the Gospels present the Crucifixion as a purely human affair, with no indication of Christ dying for the sins of mankind, a claim contradicted by Mark 10:45 and Matthew 20:28.

The same goes for readings of literary texts, says Pommier. For example, Molière&#x27;s Don Juan only pursues &quot;one&quot; love object for mediated reasons, not &quot;all&quot; of them, as Girard claims. Or again, Sancho Panza wants an island not because he is catching the bug of romanticism from Don Quixote, but because he has been promised one. And Pavel Pavlovitch, in Dostoevsky&#x27;s &quot;Eternal Husband&quot;, has been married for ten years before Veltchaninov becomes his rival, so Veltchaninov is not in fact essential to Pavel&#x27;s desire.

Accordingly, a number of scholars have suggested that Girard&#x27;s writings are metaphysics rather than science. Theorist of history Hayden White did so in an article titled &quot;Ethnological &#x27;Lie&#x27; and Mystical &#x27;Truth&#x27;&quot;; Belgian anthropologist Luc de Heusch made a similar claim in his piece &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Gospel according to Saint Girard&quot;); and Jean Greisch sees Girard&#x27;s thought as more or less a kind of Gnosis.

===Non-mimetic desires===
René Pommier has pointed out a number of problems with the Girardian claim that all desire is mimetic. First, it is very hard to explain the existence of taboo desires, such as homosexuality in repressive societies, on that basis. Second, every situation presents large numbers of potential mediators, which means that the individual has to make a choice among them; either authentic choice is possible, then, or else the theory leads to a regress. Third, Girard leaves no room for innovation: Surely somebody has to be the first to desire a new object, even if everyone else follows that trend-setter.

One might also argue that the last objection ignores the influence of an original sin from which all others follow, which Girard clearly affirms. However, original sin, according to Girard&#x27;s interpretation, explains only our propensity to imitate, not the specific content of our imitated desires. Thus, the doctrine of original sin does not solve the problem of how the original model first acquires the desire that is subsequently imitated by others.

===Beneficial imitation===
In the early part of Girard&#x27;s career, there seemed no place for beneficial imitation. Jean-Michel Oughourlian objected that &quot;imitation can be totally peaceful and beneficial; I don&#x27;t believe that I am the other, I don&#x27;t want to take his place. …This imitation can lead me to become sensitive to social and political problems.&quot; Rebecca Adams argued that because Girard&#x27;s theories fixated on violence, he was creating a &quot;scapegoat&quot; himself with his own theory: the scapegoat of positive mimesis. Adams proposed a reassessment of Girard&#x27;s theory that includes an account of loving mimesis or, as she preferred to call it, creative mimesis.

More recently, Girard has made room for positive imitation. But as Adams implies, it is not clear how the revised theory accords with earlier claims about the origin of culture. If beneficial imitation is possible, then it is no longer necessary for cultures to be born by means of scapegoating; they could just as well be born through healthy emulation. Nidesh Lawtoo further develops the healthy side of mimetic contagion by drawing on a Nietzschean philosophical tradition that privileges &quot;laughter&quot; and other gay forms of &quot;sovereign communication&quot; in the formation of &quot;community.&quot;

===Anthropology===
Various anthropologists have contested Girard&#x27;s claims. Elizabeth Traube, for example, reminds us that there are other ways of making sense of the data that Girard borrows from Evans-Pritchard and company—ways that are more consistent with the practices of the given culture. By applying a one-size-fits-all approach, Girard &quot;loses … the ability to tell us anything about cultural products themselves, for the simple reason that he has annihilated the cultures which produced them.&quot;

===Religion===
One of the main sources of criticism of Girard&#x27;s work comes from intellectuals who claim that his comparison of Judeo-Christian texts vis-à-vis other religions leaves something to be desired. There are also those who find the interpretation of the Christ event—as a purely human event, having nothing to do with redemption from sin—an unconvincing one, given what the Gospels themselves say. Yet, Roger Scruton notes, Girard&#x27;s account has a divine Jesus: &quot;that Jesus was the first scapegoat to understand the need for his death and to forgive those who inflicted it … Girard argues, Jesus gave the best evidence … of his divine nature.&quot;

==Personal life==
René Girard&#x27;s wife, Martha (née McCullough), was American; they were married from 1952 until his death. They had two sons, Martin Girard (born 1955) and Daniel Girard (born 1957), and a daughter, Mary Brown-Girard (born 1960).

Girard&#x27;s reading of Dostoevsky, in preparation for his first book in 1961, converted him from agnosticism to Christianity. For the rest of his life, he was a practising Roman Catholic.

On 4 November 2015, Girard died at his residence in Stanford, California, at the age of 91.

<doc id="1345077" wikidata="Q42375" url="?curid=1345077" title="International Mother Language Day">
<text>International Mother Language Day is a worldwide annual observance held on 21 February to promote awareness of linguistic and cultural diversity and to promote multilingualism. First announced by UNESCO on 17 November 1999, it was formally recognized by the United Nations General Assembly with the adoption of UN resolution 56/262 in 2002.

Mother Language Day is part of a broader initiative &quot;to promote the preservation and protection of all languages used by people of the world&quot; as adopted by the UN General Assembly on 16 May 2007 in UN resolution 61/266, which also established 2008 as the International Year of Languages.
The idea to celebrate International Mother Language Day was the initiative of Bangladesh.

In Bangladesh, is the anniversary of the day when the Bengalis of the then-Pakistani province of East Bengal (which is now the independent state of Bangladesh) fought for recognition of their Bengali language as Official Central State Languages instead of Provincial Language. It is also observed by the Indian Bengalis of the Indian states of West Bengal, Assam, Jharkhand, Tripura and the union territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands.

== History ==
21 February was declared to be International Mother Language Day by UNESCO on 17 November 1999. It has been observed throughout the world since 21 February 2000. The declaration came up in tribute to the Language Movement done by the Bangladeshis (then the East Pakistanis).

When Pakistan was created in 1947, it had two geographically separate parts: East Pakistan (currently known as Bangladesh) and West Pakistan (currently known as Pakistan). The two parts were very different from each other in the sense of culture and language, and were also separated by India in between.

In 1948, the Government of Pakistan declared Urdu to be the sole national language of Pakistan, even though Bengali or Bangla was spoken by the majority of people combining East Pakistan and West Pakistan. The East Pakistan people protested since the majority of the population was from East Pakistan and their mother language was Bangla. They demanded Bangla to be at least one of the national languages, in addition to Urdu. The demand was raised first by Dhirendranath Datta from East Pakistan on 23 February 1948, in the constituent Assembly of Pakistan.

To demolish the protest, the government of Pakistan outlawed public meeting and rallies. The students of the University of Dhaka, with the support of the general public, arranged massive rallies and meetings. On 21 February 1952, police opened fire on rallies. Abdus Salam, Abul Barkat, Rafiq Uddin Ahmed, Abdul Jabbar and Shafiur Rahman died, with hundreds of others injured. This was a rare incident in history, where people sacrificed their lives for their mother tongue.

Since then, Bangladeshis celebrate the International Mother Language Day as one of their tragic days. They visit the Shaheed Minar, a monument built in memory of the martyrs and its replicas to express their deep sorrow, respect and gratitude to them.

International Mother Language Day is a national holiday in Bangladesh. The resolution was suggested by Rafiqul Islam and Abdus Salam, Bengalis living in Vancouver, Canada. They wrote a letter to Kofi Annan on 9 January 1998 asking him to take a step for saving the world&#x27;s languages from extinction by declaring an International Mother Language Day. Rafiq proposed the date as 21 February to commemorate the 1952 killings in Dhaka during the Language Movement.
Rafiqul Islam&#x27;s proposal was introduced in the Bangladesh parliament and in due course (at the behest of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina) a formal proposal was submitted to UNESCO by the Government of Bangladesh. The process of shepherding the proposal through UNESCO&#x27;s regulatory system was undertaken by Syed Muazzem Ali, then Bangladesh ambassador to France and Permanent Representative to UNESCO, and Tozammel Tony Huq, his predecessor, who was then a Special Adviser to UNESCO Secretary General Federico Mayor. Finally on 17 November 1999, the 30th General Assembly of UNESCO unanimously resolved that &quot;21st February be proclaimed International Mother Language Day throughout the world to commemorate the martyrs who sacrificed their lives on this very day in 1952.&quot;

<doc id="1345081" wikidata="Q1999938" url="?curid=1345081" title="Jacques Buus">
<text>Jacques Buus (also Jakob Buus, Jachet de Buus) (late August, 1565) was a Franco-Flemish composer and organist of the Renaissance, and an early member of the Venetian School. He was one of the earliest composers of the ricercar, the predecessor to the fugue, and he was also a skilled composer of chansons.

==Life==
Buus was probably born in Ghent around 1500, though details of his early life, as is the case with most Renaissance composers, are scanty. Possibly he either studied or had his early career in France, and he maintained some connections there throughout his life. In 1538, he published his first chansons, in Lyon by the printer Jacques Moderne.

Three years later, he went to Venice and auditioned for the post of second organist at St. Mark&#x27;s, winning the job and working alongside the existing organist, Giovanni Armonio. This was during the tenure of Adrian Willaert, who built the musical forces at St. Mark&#x27;s into one of the most impressive in Europe, second only in quality to the papal chapel in Rome. Buus stayed at St. Mark&#x27;s until 1550, when he departed for France, ostensibly because he was unable to pay his debts; however it has been suggested that he left because he had become a Protestant. In 1543, he had dedicated a volume of chansons to the Calvinist Duchess of Ferrara and, in 1550, he sent a book of Protestant to the Protestant Archduke Ferdinand II in Vienna. Late in 1550, he went to Vienna to work at the Habsburg court and he remained there for the rest of his life, ignoring entreaties from Venice to return.

==Music and influence==
Buus was influential in the development of the instrumental ricercar; he wrote the longest ever composed, one of which has no less than 98 points of imitation. Another has 358 breves (equivalent to 716 bars of 4/4; at the typical &quot;tactus&quot; of the time60 to 80 minims, i.e. half-notes, to the minutethe piece would take 15–20 minutes to play). They are elaborately contrapuntal, making use of all the standard devices of Franco-Flemish polyphony, including augmentation, diminution, inversion, and so forth.

He also wrote sacred vocal music, including motets and &quot;chansons spirituelles&quot;, a specifically Protestant form, although these were not for performance in Catholic Venice. The motets are similar in style to those of Nicolas Gombert, with dense textures, pervasive imitation, and free treatment of the source material.

<doc id="1345088" wikidata="Q1234706" url="?curid=1345088" title="Alfie Bass">
<text>Alfie Bass (born Abraham Basalinsky, 10 April 1916 – 16 July 1987) was an English actor. He was born in Bethnal Green, London, the youngest in a Jewish family with ten children; his parents had left Russia many years before he was born. He appeared in a variety of stage, film, television and radio productions throughout his career.

==Personal life==
Alfie Bass was born Abraham Basalinsky in Bethnal Green in London&#x27;s East End. He was the youngest of ten children of Jacob Basalinsky, who had fled Jewish persecution in Russia, and his wife, Ada Miller. After leaving school, he worked in his father&#x27;s trade as a cabinet-maker. During this time, he took part in amateur dramatics at a local boys&#x27; club. He was active in the labour movement and often attended union meetings. In 1936, he took part in the Battle of Cable Street, in which activists attempted to prevent a march through the East End by the British Union of Fascists.

At the outbreak of World War II, he was rejected by the RAF, and went to work in an engineering factory. He was later called up into the Middlesex Regiment as a despatch rider. He maintained his interest in acting by appearing in concert parties and in Army Film Unit documentaries.

In 1946, he married Beryl Bryson, a dressmaker, in Liverpool. They had a son and a daughter.

==Stage career==
Bass&#x27;s acting career began at London&#x27;s Unity Theatre in the late 1930s, appearing in &quot;Plant in the Sun&quot; alongside Paul Robeson, and as the pantomime King in &quot;Babes In the Wood&quot;.

His stage career included plays by Shakespeare and Shaw. During the 1950s, he continued to direct shows at Unity, and on one occasion appeared in court (along with Vida Hope), charged with putting on a play without a licence. His stage work also included an adaptation of Gogol&#x27;s short story &quot;The Bespoke Overcoat&quot;, transposed to the East End of London, which was filmed by Jack Clayton in 1956, and won the Oscar for Best Short. In addition, Bass took over from Chaim Topol in the role of Tevye in &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; on the West End stage.

==Film career==
Bass first appeared on film in wartime documentaries. He also appeared in a number of feature films including &quot;The Lavender Hill Mob&quot; (1951), &quot;Hell Drivers&quot; (1957), &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; (1958) and &quot;Alfie&quot; (1966) starring Michael Caine and Shelley Winters. In the latter he played Harry Clamacraft, a man Alfie meets and befriends in a sanatorium.

He starred in Roman Polanski&#x27;s vampire film &quot;The Fearless Vampire Killers&quot; (1967) (British title &quot;The Dance of the Vampires&quot;) as innkeeper Yoine Shagal with his daughter Sarah played by Sharon Tate. In the course of the film, he and his daughter become vampires. When a maid tries to scare him off with a crucifix, he responds with &quot;Oy, have &quot;you&quot; got the wrong vampire!&quot;.

Bass also appeared in the &quot;Pride&quot; segment of &quot;The Magnificent Seven Deadly Sins&quot; (1971) and had a leading role in the 1977 sex comedy &quot;Come Play with Me&quot;. He has had many cameo roles, such as the Indian restaurant doorman in the Beatles&#x27; film &quot;Help!&quot; (1965), as Clouseau&#x27;s seafaring informant in &quot;Revenge of the Pink Panther&quot; (1978), and in &quot;Moonraker&quot; (1979), in which he was cast as a heavy smoking hard drinker. Bass had a small part in &quot;I Was Monty&#x27;s Double&quot; as a non-speaking passenger on a train.

In his book &quot;British Film Character Actors&quot; (1982), Terence Pettigrew remembers, &quot;there was a time when no British film seemed complete without Alfie Bass popping up in some guise or other. Basically playing the same character, he has hopped chirpily from drama to comedy and into costume pieces and back like an energised sparrow. To all of these, he has added an engaging warmth and sanguinity&quot;.

==Television and radio==
Bass appeared as a poacher rescued by Robin Hood in the first episode of &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; starring Richard Greene, in episode 2 &quot;The Moneylender&quot;, as well as in episode 10 of the first series which was titled &quot;The Ordeal&quot;. He also appeared in two later episodes during season two titled &quot;The Goldmaker&quot; (episode 5) and &quot;The Goldmaker&#x27;s Return&quot; (episode 22) as Lepidus, the roguish alchemist, rescued from the Sheriff by Little John (Archie Duncan). He appeared in &quot;The Army Game&quot; (1957–1961), a British TV comedy series, as Private Montague &#x27;Excused Boots&#x27; Bisley, and its sequel &quot;Bootsie and Snudge&quot; from 1960 to 1963 (there was also a one series revival in colour in 1974), working at a Gentlemen&#x27;s club with Bill Fraser as &#x27;Claude Snudge&#x27; and Clive Dunn as &#x27;Henry Beerbohm Johnson&#x27;. Bass additionally played the character in another spin-off, &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot;, in 1964. Bass also played Lemuel &quot;Lemmy&quot; Barnet in the third and fourth series of the landmark 1950s science fiction BBC Radio series &quot;Journey into Space&quot;.

He was a subject of the television programme &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in March 1970, when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews.

He continued working throughout the 1970s and 80s, particularly in the TV series&#x27; &quot;Till Death Us Do Part&quot; and &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot;, the latter as Mr. Goldberg, the second in a series of replacements for Arthur Brough&#x27;s Mr. Grainger character (the first being James Hayter&#x27;s Mr. Tebbs). As in the Mr. Goldberg role, he often emphasised his Jewish background in his on-screen characterisations.

Bass appeared in a 1979 episode of the ITV drama series &quot;Danger UXB: Just Like a Woman&quot;, as a family man with an unexploded bomb in his back garden.

Bass played a memorable Silas Wegg in the BBC&#x27;s 1976 adaptation of Dickens&#x27;s &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot;. He also played Isaac Rag in a notable recurring character role in the 1979–1980 &quot;Dick Turpin&quot; series, and Morrie Levin, a shrewd accountant, in the &quot;Minder&quot; episode &quot;The Son Also Rises&quot; (1982).

He also guest starred in two episodes of the British comedy television &quot;The Goodies&quot;, in which he appeared as the &quot;Town Planner&quot; in &quot;Camelot&quot;, and as the &quot;Giant&quot; in &quot;The Goodies and the Beanstalk&quot;.

==Recording career==

In 1955, Bass recorded the novelty song &quot;Pity the Downtrodden Landlord&quot;. It was issued by the folk music label Topic Records on a 78rpm single, backed with &quot;Housing Repairs And Rents Act&quot;, written by Fred Dallas; on both sides, Bass was accompanied by &quot;The Four Bailiffs&quot;.

With his fellow cast members from &quot;The Army Game&quot;, Bernard Bresslaw, Leslie Fyson and Michael Medwin, Bass was part of a vocal quartet who scored a number 5 hit in the UK Singles Chart in 1958 with &quot;The Signature Tune Of The Army Game&quot;. It was backed with the same actors singing &quot;What Do We Do In The Army&quot;. In 1960, Pye Records issued two solo recordings by Bass on a single, &quot;Villikens And His Dinah&quot; and &quot;Rat Catcher&#x27;s Daughter&quot;.

==Death==
Alfie Bass died on 16 July 1987 in Barnet General Hospital, north London, following a heart attack. He was survived by his wife and their son and daughter. His last home was in Well End, a suburb of Borehamwood, Hertfordshire.

<text>An automatic revolver also known as semi-automatic revolver, is a revolver that uses the recoil energy of firing for cocking the hammer and revolving the cylinder, rather than using manual operations to perform these actions. As semi-automatic firearms, the shooter must manually operate the trigger to discharge each shot.

Examples of genuine semi-automatic revolvers are extremely uncommon, and the term is inaccurately applied to break-open revolvers with a mechanical linkage ejector that automatically empties spent (and unspent) casings from the cylinder upon opening of the breech.

== History ==
An automatic revolver was communicated to Moses Poole, a patent agent, in 1841. The exact identity of the inventor of this weapon is unknown but in all likelihood it was a Frenchman by the name of Philippe Mathieu, who had patented, amongst several different types of revolver, an almost identical design two years previously. Another automatic revolver was communicated to British patent agent William Edward Newton by the Americans Mershon and Hollingsworth in 1854. Both of these weapons used clockwork as the power for achieving automatic operation. In 1863 a gas piston-operated revolver was designed by a Spanish gunsmith named Orbea. The Webley-Fosbery Automatic Revolver was designed in 1895 and became the first commercial and best-known semi-automatic revolver.

== Description ==
A standard revolver is a manually operated weapon, using the action of cocking the hammer to advance the cylinder in a single-action, or the action of pulling the trigger to advance the cylinder and cock the hammer in a double-action. The idea behind an automatic revolver is to automate both actions, removing the need to manually cock the hammer between shots while retaining the lighter trigger pull of the single-action.

This is accomplished by use of a reciprocating slide on the upper part of the frame, the motion of which is used to rotate the cylinder and cock the hammer in much the same way as is used in the majority of semi-automatic pistol designs.

=== Examples ===
* The Norwegian Landstad revolver, designed and introduced in 1900. Its very unusual design featured a flat cylinder with two chambers, in which the bottom chamber was loaded from a sideways-inserted magazine that also functioned as the left grip plate. During firing, the revolver&#x27;s reciprocating bolt would extract and eject the round from the top chamber after firing, load a round into the bottom chamber, and then rotate the cylinder. The revolver would then be ready to fire again. It was chambered for the 7.5mm Nagant cartridge, which at the time was also used in both the Norwegian and Swedish versions of the Belgian Nagant M1895 revolver.
* The Webley-Fosbery Automatic Revolver was the first commercial example, introduced in 1901. It was recoil-operated, and the cylinder and barrel recoiled backwards to cock the hammer and revolve the cylinder. It was distinctive in that cam grooves were milled on the outside of the cylinder to provide a means of advancing to the next chamber—half a turn as the cylinder moved back, and half a turn as it moved forward. .38 caliber versions held 8 shots, .455 caliber versions 6. Around 4,750 were made in total.
* The Union Automatic Revolver of American origin. Only around 65 examples made.
* The Zulaica Automatic Revolver M. Zulaica y Cia., Eibar, Spain. began manufacturing &quot;Velo-Dog&quot; type pocket revolvers in the early 1900s. In 1905, Zulaica patented an unusual .22 LR automatic revolver design, but few were ever manufactured and even fewer have survived. Zulaica started manufacturing &quot;Eibar&quot; type automatic pistols under French army contracts in 1915 and 1916, and continued to market them commercially up to the 1920s.
* In 1997, the Mateba company developed a type of recoil-operated automatic revolver, the Mateba Unica auto-revolver, which uses recoil energy to auto-rotate a revolver cylinder holding six or seven cartridges, depending on the model. The company has made several versions of its &quot;autorevolver&quot;, including longer barreled and even rifle-like variations, usually chambered for .357 Magnum ammunition, but also available in larger calibers such as .44 Magnum and .454 Casull.

<doc id="1345102" wikidata="Q1365961" url="?curid=1345102" title="Mizuho PayPay Dome Fukuoka">
<text>, officially the is a baseball field located in Chūō-ku, Fukuoka, Japan. Home to the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks, the 40,000 seat stadium was built in 1993 and was originally named Fukuoka Dome. It is Japan&#x27;s first stadium built with a retractable roof, and was the only baseball stadium in Japan with one until the opening of Es Con Field Hokkaido in 2023.

==History==


Fukuoka Dome is the home stadium of Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks and, together with Hilton Fukuoka Sea Hawk Hotel, is part of the Hawks Town entertainment complex. It is located near Momochi Beach, and a 15 minute walk from Tōjinmachi Station, a part of the Fukuoka City Subway system.

In 2003 Colony Capital purchased the stadium with accompanying hotels from Daiei, in the process Colony assumed ¥60 billion in debts with the properties along with a ¥15 billion capital infusion for renovations.

After the sale of the stadium&#x27;s primary tenant, the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks, from supermarket chain Daiei to multinational technology investment company SoftBank on January 28, 2005, Yahoo! Japan, one of SoftBank&#x27;s subsidiaries, acquired the stadium&#x27;s naming rights, and thus renamed it or abbreviated as . At the same time, SoftBank agreed to lease the rights to the Fukuoka Dome for 4.8 billion yen per year for 20 years.

In 2006, the stadium received an upgrade to its mono-color main scoreboard &quot;Hawks Vision.&quot; Sharing the same nickname as its predecessor and measured at 10 m (32.76 ft) high and 53 m (173.86 ft) wide, it was one of the largest high-definition electronic scoreboards at the time, equivalent to a 2,123-inch wide-screen display. In 2010, with further addition of two 5.7 m (120.65 ft) × 33 m (108.27 ft) displays, the stadium boasted the largest total viewing area of HD display in all baseball stadia (total area 905.2sqm or 9,743.49sqft).

On April 12, 2007, the Fukuoka Dome and Hawks Town complex was sold to an affiliate of the GIC.

In 2009, the older, short-pile AstroTurf field was replaced with the more modern grass-like FieldTurf brand surface to reduce injuries; the Hawks players had seen far more injuries than any other team in Japan prior to the field being replaced.

On March 24, 2012, SoftBank purchased the stadium from the GIC affiliate for 87 billion yen. The stadium became fully owned by the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks Marketing Corporation on July 1, 2015. The adjacent shopping mall was sold to Mitsubishi Estate on January 22, 2015. 

In January 2013, it was renamed to . Yafuoku is the abbreviation for Yahoo! Auctions in Japan.

On October 30, 2019, it was announced that the stadium was going to be renamed again to f, in reference to the payment system PayPay owned by SoftBank (50%) and Yahoo Japan (25%), on February 29, 2020.

On April 25, 2024, it was announced that the stadium would be getting additional sponsorship rights from Mizuho Financial Group, creating Mizuho PayPay Dome Fukuoka as a symbol of unity between Mizuho and SoftBank Group, which have close ties to each other.

The Fukuoka Dome has hosted one game in each Major League Baseball Japan All-Star Series since its creation, including the final game of the 2006 series, where Japan was swept for the first time in the history of the event.

In the TV series &quot;Extreme Engineering&quot;, Danny Forster makes a reference to the Fukuoka Dome, saying it was said to have a &quot;floating&quot; field. (An indoor baseball stadium in Japan which actually has a floating field is Sapporo Dome, which also hosts football games for Consadole Sapporo, a J. League club. However, this stadium does not have such a field.)

The roof of the Fukuoka Dome was designed to be opened similar to that of the now demolished Civic Arena in Pittsburgh, where the roof would open from the side. This design causes the roof to be rarely opened, due to costs of electricity to the mechanics to open the roof.

The Building itself is recognized for its 12,000 ton steel retractable roof with a 3 millimeter titanium plating.

==Notable events==

On May 18, 1994, Hiromi Makihara of the Yomiuri Giants threw a perfect game against Hiroshima Toyo Carp as the Giants won 6–0.

Wrestling Dontaku 2022 was hosted in the Fukuoka Dome once more as a part of celebrating the 50th anniversary of NJPW, though the show has since returned to the Fukuoka Kokusai Center.

<doc id="1345125" wikidata="Q7564094" url="?curid=1345125" title="Woodside, Queens">
<text>Woodside is a neighborhood in the western portion of the borough of Queens in New York City. It is bordered on the south by Maspeth, on the north by Astoria, on the west by Sunnyside, and on the east by Elmhurst, Jackson Heights, and East Elmhurst. Some areas are widely residential and very quiet, while other parts, especially the ones around Roosevelt Avenue, are busier.

In the 19th century the area was part of the Town of Newtown (now Elmhurst). The adjacent area of Winfield was largely incorporated into the post office serving Woodside and as a consequence Winfield lost much of its identity distinct from Woodside. However, with large-scale residential development in the 1860s, Woodside became the largest Irish American community in Queens, being approximately 80% Irish by the 1930s and maintaining a strong Irish culture today. In the early 1990s, many Asian American families include a large Filipino community moved into the area, and as a result the current population is 30% Asian American. South Asians and Latinos have also moved to Woodside in recent years.

Reflecting its longtime diverse cuisines, the neighborhood is filled with many cultural restaurants and pubs. It is also home to some of the city&#x27;s most popular Thai, Filipino, and South American eateries.

Woodside is located in Queens Community District 2 and its ZIP Code is 11377. It is patrolled by the New York City Police Department&#x27;s 108th Precinct. Politically, Woodside is represented by the New York City Council&#x27;s 22nd and 26th Districts.

==History==

===Early years===
For two centuries following the arrival of settlers from England and the Netherlands, the area where the village of Woodside would be established was sparsely populated. The land was fertile, but also wet. Its Native American inhabitants called it a place of &quot;bad waters&quot;, and it was known to early European settlers as a place of &quot;marshes, muddy flats and bogs&quot;, where &quot;wooded swamps&quot; and &quot;flaggy pools&quot; were fed by flowing springs.&quot; Until drained in the nineteenth century, one of these wet woodlands was called Wolf Swamp after the predators that infested it. This swamp was not the only place where settlers might fear for the safety of their livestock, and even themselves. One of the oldest recorded locations in Woodside was called Rattlesnake Spring on the property of a Captain Bryan Newton. The vicinity came to be called &quot;Snake Woods,&quot; and one source maintains that &quot;during New York&#x27;s colonial period, the area was known as &#x27;suicide&#x27;s paradise,&#x27; as it was largely snake-infested swamps and wolf-ridden woodlands.&quot;

Woodside was settled by farmers in the early 18th century. In time, inhabitants learned how to farm the land profitably. The marsh grasses proved to be good for grazing and grains, fruits, and vegetables could be grown on the surrounding dry land. By the middle of the 18th century, the area&#x27;s farmers had drained some of its marshes and cut back some of its woods to expand its arable land and eliminate natural predators. Agricultural produce found markets in New York City, and at the beginning of the 19th century the area came to be &quot;abundantly conspicuous in the wealth of the farmers and in the beauty of the villas.&quot; A late 19th-century historian described one of the area&#x27;s 19th-century farms as a pleasing mix of woodlot, tilled acreage, grazing land, orchard, and pleasure garden. He believed &quot;it would probably have been hard to find anywhere in the vicinity of New York a more picturesque locality.&quot; Another observer of this time praised Woodside&#x27;s &quot;pure atmosphere and delightful scenery.&quot;

In the 19th century, the area was part of the Town of Newtown (now Elmhurst). The adjacent area of Winfield was largely incorporated into the post office serving Woodside and as a consequence Winfield lost much of its identity distinct from Woodside.

Some idea of the bucolic nature of the place that would become Woodside can be seen in descriptions of an ancient central landmark, a great chestnut tree. The tree was hundreds of years old when it finally came down in the last decade of the 19th century. It stood on high ground near a junction of three dirt roads and &quot;was of great diameter, some 8 or 10 feet&quot;—perhaps 30 feet in circumference. Its size and central location made it a natural meeting place, its surface one on which to tack public notices, and a strategic point of considerable military significance during the Revolutionary War. A 19th-century antiquarian wrote of the great tree as it stood during the American Revolution and in doing so named the families of the local landowners: Around the roots of the old tree were the huts and stables of the cavalry: with a number of settler&#x27;s huts ranged in woods... Great festivities too were constant in the spacious rooms of the old Moore house, during the winter months when the snow was deeper and the frost more cold than now-a-days. To the streaming lights from the ball room, and the lanterns hung on the trees, were wont to assemble the gay sleighing parties from the Sacket [i.e. Sackett], Morrell, Alsop, Leverich and other houses; for the soldiers were all over and had come to Newtown to recruit [i.e. refresh and restore] themselves after the yearly campaigns... Is there any relic more associated with Newtown [i.e. the town in which the village of Woodside would come to be located] than its old chestnut tree?... [Has it] not been for two centuries the &quot;Legal Notice&quot; centre of Newtown, for all vendues, real estate transfers, town meetings, lost &quot;creeturs&quot; and runaway slaves?

Woodside was first developed on a large scale beginning in 1867 by speculative residential neighborhood builder Benjamin W. Hitchcock, who also founded Corona and Ozone Park, and John Andrew Kelly. The neighborhood&#x27;s location about three miles from Hunter&#x27;s Point on the Long Island Rail Road line made it an ideal location for a new suburban community. In 1874, the &quot;New York Times&quot; described Woodside:

====Agriculture====

By the middle of the 19th century, drainage and improved agricultural techniques had increased the proportion of Woodside&#x27;s arable land to some two-thirds of its total. Flowers and dairy products were added to the fruits and vegetables which farmers took to city markets. These landowners also reaped benefits from improved transportation. Mid-century construction of a plank road from Newtown to Williamsburg and a later one from Newtown to Hunters Point made access to East River ferries quicker and easier. In 1860 a corporation presided over by a local resident, John C. Jackson, built a gravel-topped toll road between Flushing and the ferry at Hunters Point. The Plank Road disappeared during construction projects of the later 19th century but Northern Boulevard tracks closely resemble the route of Jackson Avenue.

====Residential estates====

The improvements in transportation that initially benefited agriculture eventually led to its decline. As it became quicker and more convenient for residents to travel from their homes to other parts of Queens, to Brooklyn, and to Manhattan, the area came to be seen as both desirable and affordable for the construction of housing for city-dwellers and increases in land values enticed farm owners to sell out. John Sackett came from a family of religious dissenters that had settled in Queens late in the 17th century. In 1802 he inherited a farm of 115 acres including much of what is now Woodside, and in 1826 his heirs sold much of the property to John A. Kelly, the son of a German immigrant, and his sister-in-law (also of German descent), Catherine B. (Friedle) Buddy. As other well-to-do merchants had done in other areas of Queens, Kelly and Buddy bought farm property for use as a rural estate where they planned to live in the warmer months of the year. Not long after, a friend of Kelly&#x27;s, William Schroeder, bought another parcel of the Sackett property for the same purpose. Like Kelly, he came of a family that had emigrated from Germany and, like Kelly, he had achieved wealth as a merchant in Charleston, South Carolina. Unlike Kelly, however, he did not move North, but kept the estate for use during summer vacations.

After Kelly and Schroeder had moved in, two other well-to-do men of German extraction made country retreats for themselves in Woodside. They were Gustav Sussdorf and Louis Windmuller. Like Kelly and Schroeder, Sussdorf was a Charleston merchant. In 1859 he sold his fancy goods business and moved to New York. Not long after, he bought a farm owned by the family of Thomas Cumberson who had died in 1849. It is quite possible that he learned of the place through acquaintance with Schroeder or, more likely, Kelly. Windmuller was of a younger generation than Kelly, Schroeder, and Sussdorf. He emigrated to New York in the aftermath of the Revolutions of 1848. Only 18 years old and penniless, he found success as a commission agent, bringing goods to clients in the U.S. from Germany and other European countries. In 1867 he had accumulated enough savings to buy property adjoining Sussdorf&#x27;s. The land had formerly belonged to the Morrell family, but had been acquired by a speculator, John A. Mecke, and became available to Windmuller upon Mecke&#x27;s death and the bankruptcy of his estate.

====Residential development====
As farms gave way to country estates, so country estates would, in turn, give way to residential development, as, in the decades after 1850, the land was broken into small lots for construction of single-family houses. As before, this new shift was brought about largely by improvement in transportation resources. In 1854, the first steam-powered passenger rail service came to the area. In that year a passenger depot of the Flushing Railroad from Long Island City to Flushing opened for operation near the southern boundary of what would become the village of Woodside. The line gave access to New York City via the Hunters Point Ferry and to Brooklyn via horse-drawn omnibus. In 1861 a second line opened running directly through what would shortly become the village of Woodside. This was a segment of the Long Island Rail Road which operated between Hunters Point and Jamaica, replacing an earlier segment which passed through Brooklyn to the ferry dock in Williamsburg. In 1869, another line, the Flushing and North Side Railroad, traversed the same path through Woodside. And soon after, in 1874, a short spur, the Flushing and Woodside Railroad opened its station in the village.

The construction of this rail service led directly to the division of property near train stations into small lots for construction of houses for working-class families. The area that would become Woodside was not the first community to grow out of Queens farmland. Before the end of the 1850s Woodhaven, Astoria, Maspeth, Corona, Hunters Point, and Winfield all attracted land speculators. Woodside&#x27;s developers were, however, among the first to divide properties into lots for construction of small homes for working-class families. In doing so they were the first to use a set of new sales techniques to lure buyers. And they were the first to apply a name to a locale which emphasized its real or supposed virtues. A late 19th century author said &quot;Woodside&quot; was an appropriate name for the community these land speculators created. He maintained that others, created later, were &quot;without the slightest significance, historic or otherwise, and of the kind apparently chosen by boarding schoolgirls to roll romantically from the tongue.&quot;. These included Ozone Park, Corona, Winfield, Glendale, Laurel Hill, Elmhurst, and Linden Hill.

The real estate promoters who created Woodside were mostly of German extraction. Members of the Kelly family were first, followed by Alpheus P. Riker, Henry G. Schmidt, John A. Mecke, and Emil Cuntz. The Kelly family developed the property where they resided while the others bought land specifically to divide it into building lots. Riker came from a German family that had settled in Queens while it was still part of New Netherland.

====Benjamin W. Hitchcock====

The Kelly family was linked to A. P. Riker&#x27;s by marriage. Riker, a customs officer, was John A. Kelly&#x27;s son-in-law. Members of the Kelly family were publishers, and it may not be a coincidence that the agent with whom the Kellys contracted for development of Woodside farmland was a publisher of sheet music, periodicals, and &quot;subscription books&quot; named Benjamin W. Hitchcock. Hitchcock had a flair for publicity and innovative sales techniques. Once the area had been surveyed and 972 plots laid out, he organized excursions from the city, hired brass bands to play, and gave prospects free lunch. The first sales event took place on February 18, 1869. Hitchcock priced empty lots at $300. Employing an innovative sales technique, he sold them on the installment plan. Purchasers made a down payment and owed $10 a month until the note was paid off. He took a 25% commission on each sale. To entice purchasers he sold lottery tickets with first option on choice lots as one set of prizes. Other prizes included option to purchase one of five houses already built on the property. It may have been he or perhaps Kelly who gave the name &quot;Woodside&quot; to the area. A member of the Kelly family, John A. F. Kelly, had used it in occasional pieces he had written for a local newspaper during the 1850s and 1860s. In 1899 one of the original purchasers told a reporter than he had bought a lot with a tiny house on it, only 20&#x27; wide by 16&#x27; deep. The price was $480, and he paid $125 down and $10 a month until he&#x27;d paid off the note.

Hitchcock had an instinct for spectacle akin to P.T. Barnum&#x27;s. After his success with Woodside he undertook similar real estate promotions in other parts of Queens including hamlets that he dubbed Corona and Ozone Park. When the economy soured and that business declined, he ran a theater, got involved in machine politics, and sponsored some beauty contests including one, the &quot;Congress of Beauty and Culture&quot;, which was censured for its overall sleaze and the swindling of its participants.

While the other major landowners of Woodside used agents to develop their holdings, A. P. Riker set up a real estate office in the center of the village from which he managed his own property and handled real estate transactions for others. He was also a partner in local businesses: a grocery store in 1876 and, in 1878, a fruit and vegetable canning business which employed 100 workers.

The developers who followed Hitchcock&#x27;s lead in Woodside were less flamboyant though similarly successful. In 1863 John Mecke bought farmland from a family, the Moores, who had lived for more than a century and a half on what would become the northern part of what would become Woodside. He intended to subdivide, but became insolvent and, in 1867, died. His heirs sold the property to two carpenters, Henry G. Schmidt and Emil Cuntz, who, in 1871, deeded their property to an organization known as the Bricklayers&#x27; Cooperative Building Association. This organization seems not to have been what its name suggests since it was a New York corporation headed by Charles Merweg who gave his occupation as &quot;speculator in real estate&quot;. In any event, the Association erected a housing development in north Woodside which it called Charlotteville. The name was later given the more common spelling of Charlottesville. In 1886 another speculator, Effingham H. Nichols, divided property in the eastern part of the village and called it Woodside Heights. Other 19th-century developers included Charles F. Ehrhardt who sold lots in the northern part of the village and the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company which converted two properties on the west side into salable lots.

These and other real estate developers profited from their sale of lots to home buyers, but the growth of Woodside&#x27;s housing market was hardly a smooth upward trajectory and, some 40 years after Hitchcock&#x27;s first lottery, the village was far from completely saturated with homes. A minutely detailed property atlas from 1909 shows buildings on considerably less than half of the village&#x27;s surveyed lots. In fact, although affordable by standards of the time, Woodside&#x27;s small single family houses on their small lots were too expensive for growing numbers of laborers who crowded the tenement apartments of Manhattan and nearby Brooklyn. In the years before the Panic of 1907 and again after its close, the wage-earners in many of these low-income families, having been able to improve their skills and obtain higher-paying jobs, began pressing for construction of housing that was better than the tenements but still within their means. Although real estate developers had previously thought Woodside to be too remote and rural in character for marketing of low cost rental units, some changed circumstances convinced them to meet this need by putting up higher-density apartment buildings in the village.

====Other factors====
Chief among these circumstances were continued improvements to the public transportation network. This network continued to expand and Woodside evolved as a hub for railroad (the Long Island Rail Road&#x27;s Main Line electrified in 1908), elevated rapid transit (the joint IRT/BRT Corona and Woodside Line, 1917), and electrified trolleys (Newtown Railway Company, 1895, and New York and Queens County Line, 1896). With the incorporation of Queens into New York City in 1898 and subsequent passage of legislation mandating a five-cent citywide transit fare in 1904, Woodside residents had both abundant and inexpensive options for rapid public transportation. In fact the real cost of the five-cent fare declined dramatically during the inflation years of World War I and the 1920s, and it remained in place, despite further inflation, until 1948. The construction of bridge and tunnel connections to Manhattan—the Queensboro Bridge in 1909 and the Steinway Tunnel in 1915—enabled the working members of a tenement-dwelling immigrant family to rent a garden apartment in Woodside while having jobs in the central city. The commute was cheap and short, and during rush hours, the five-cent trip took as little as eight minutes to Times Square. Although other areas of Queens benefited from the expansion of cheap transit, Woodside was, back then, the only village in Queens with both railroad and rapid transit stations in addition to trolley lines.

A second circumstance aiding the influx of upwardly-mobile low-income residents was a dramatic increase in local employment prospects. Although cheap, fast, and convenient transit made it possible for workers from Queens to have other-borough jobs, intra-borough employment opportunities were increasingly a realistic option. The waterside regions of Queens had long had substantial industries and businesses that benefited from access to water-borne transport. These commercial establishments multiplied as rail transportation became increasingly available and, in a virtuous growth cycle, as more prospective employees moved into the borough. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Woodside residents could find employment to the east in Brooklyn, to the north in College Point, and, especially, to the west. Hunters Point, Sunnyside, and other west-Queens communities possessed foundries, rail yards, chemical works, and numerous factories, including the famous Steinway Piano factory. When, in 1870, these communities formed themselves into Long Island City opportunities for employment grew rapidly, so much so that by the turn of the 20th century, the city could boast that it had the highest concentration of industry in all the United States. There were jobs within Woodside as well. The village had long had the city&#x27;s largest cemetery, Calvary, as a stimulus to local business. It also possessed a brewery, a major florist, and many local retail establishments. In 1875, the Bulova Watch Company established its headquarters there.

Along with good transportation and access to jobs, Woodside possessed many other local amenities. It was an attractive place with plentiful open spaces, many trees and wooded areas, healthful air, and an overall pleasant ambiance; one news article in 1926 described this as &quot;sylvan beauty&quot;, As it had in the other villages, the creation of the Borough of Queens in 1898 brought improvements in local government and increased spending on police, roads, schools, and public spaces, to Woodside. However, Woodside had provided fire protection, sewers, and street lights earlier on, and its transit facilities gave way to a wide variety of retail options. One newspaper article published in 1926 singled out its school, P.S. 11, as &quot;one of the leading public schools in Queens.&quot;

As in nearby communities of the time, religious observance played an important role in the lives of Woodside residents, and its churches both reflected this importance and signaled welcome to prospective newcomers. Riker&#x27;s 1852 map of Newtown shows an Episcopal, Methodist Episcopal, and Presbyterian church in Newtown Village or Winfield. In 1854 St. Mary&#x27;s Winfield, today&#x27;s Blessed Virgin Mary Help of Christians, became the first Catholic parish. Much of its congregation and all its early pastors were of German nationality.

The first church in Woodside proper, St. Paul&#x27;s Protestant Episcopal, showed the dominant faith of the area&#x27;s oldest and most prominent residents. It was established in 1874 by the families of landowners who had farmed there from its earliest settlement as well as by the estate-owning Germanic families that had moved in during the middle decades of the 19th century, including the longstanding Rapelye, Hicks, and Riker families and the newly arrived Sussdorf, Windmuller, and Kelly families. Two years later, residents from among the still newer owners of small houses set up a Baptist church. St. Paul&#x27;s originally had a small congregation of only 50, with twice that in 1900; the Baptist church had about the same. St. Sebastian, this section&#x27;s first Roman Catholic church, served a considerably larger population upon its 1896 foundation. The number of church members, originally 300, quickly grew and was reported to be 1,000 in 1902.

In addition to its other advantages, prospective home buyers were enticed by Woodside&#x27;s places of entertainment. One of its first businesses was a brewery, which had long possessed rooms where men could gather and drink. In the second half of the 19th century it became renowned for its beer gardens and dance halls. One early resident, Julius Adams, bought a tiny house on one of Hitchcock&#x27;s small lots. At first he earned his living as a shoemaker, and, succeeding in that business, expanded into others. In 1881 he built Sanger Hall—a German-style beer hall, a dance hall, and performance space for German singing societies and theatrical entertainments—and as the Hall thrived, he added dining rooms and even a bowling alley. In 1889, another resident built Heimann&#x27;s Hall, a beer garden, dancing pavilion, and dining hall. Early in the 20th century a movie theater joined the options for local leisure-time activity.

===20th century===

As the 19th century gave way to the 20th, Woodside&#x27;s plentiful advantages convinced real estate developers to invest substantially in high-occupancy housing and duplex homes to complement the single-family units which had dominated the area. Three representative examples are Woodside Apartments built in 1913, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company&#x27;s project of 1922, and the projects of the Woodside Development Corporation in 1923. Located near the rail and rapid transit stations, the Woodside Apartments was a row of four-story, semi-detached buildings. There were four apartments on a floor, most of them having four rooms. Rents initially ranged from $18 to $20 a month. Located just as close to the trains, but on the other side of the village, the Metropolitan Life apartment project was more ambitious. Consisting of ten five-story buildings, the project had space for four hundred families. The Woodside Development Corporation built four-story apartments with stores on the ground floor and both two- and one-family houses on two large plots of land near the center of the village. When a citywide aerial survey was taken in 1924, Woodside was shown to have quite a few other multifamily apartment buildings and duplexes along with its many small single-family homes.

During the 1930s and into the post-war era, Woodside residential development continued to grow, although more slowly than in the boom years following World War I. Empty lots continued to be filled with one- and two-family houses, compact apartment buildings continued to be constructed, and larger, elevator-style high-rises were put up. In 1936, a last large tract of undeveloped land was made available for construction of garden apartments when a portion of the 10-acre Windmuller Estate was sold to developers.

A community profile, published in 1943, characterized Woodside (along with Winfield, its neighbor to the south) as &quot;a district of small homes and middle incomes.&quot; The area still had few apartment buildings and very little industry. Although the rapid population growth of the 1920s had fallen off in the 1930s, the authors of the profile expected improved transit (the IND Queens Boulevard Line which opened in 1933) and a new shopping center to draw larger numbers of new residents. The number of single-family houses is given as 2,159, double-family houses as 1,711, and larger residential buildings as 868.

In 1949, construction was completed on the Woodside Houses, a public housing complex built and operated by the New York City Housing Authority. The complex consists of 20 six-story buildings with 1,358 apartments. It is located in western Woodside, bordering Astoria, between 49th and 51st Streets, 31st Avenue and Newtown Road.

===21st century===

At the turn of the 21st century, Woodside was finally seen to be built up. The neighborhood nonetheless continued to be seen as an attractive place to live—characterized by &quot;wide avenues, leafy streets and a mix of private homes, small apartment buildings and the occasional towering co-op.&quot; The population was about 1,800 in 1880; 3,900 in 1900; 15,000 in 1920; and 41,000 in 1930. By 1963 it had grown to about 55,600, and by 2000, the population had risen to 90,000. In 2008 the chairman of the local Community Board said that large apartment buildings were replacing smaller ones and single-family homes were being converted into multifamily rental properties. At the same time, real estate brokers told a news reporter that interest remained strong among families looking for affordable housing near Manhattan.

==Demographics==
Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of Woodside was 45,099, an increase of 1,253 (2.9%) from the 43,846 counted in 2000. Covering an area of , the neighborhood had a population density of .

The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 22.5% (10,140) White, 1.3% (592) African American, 0.2% (76) Native American, 39.9% (17,990) Asian, 0.0% (5) Pacific Islander, 0.5% (221) from other races, and 2.2% (975) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 33.5% (15,100) of the population.

==Culture==
===Background===
The character of Woodside&#x27;s population, in terms of national origin, has changed radically over time. Its first inhabitants were Native Americans, probably of the Mespeatches, who gave their name to the town of Maspeth. The first European landowners were mainly Dutch and English and their laborers mainly British, African (slaves), and American Indian. During the nineteenth century, Germans largely took over from these first settlers. In addition to the major Germanic landowners already mentioned (the Kellys—whose name was originally Kölle—Riker, Schroeder, Schmidt, Sussdorf, and Windmuller), the first purchasers of Hitchcock&#x27;s little plots were largely of German extraction. They included men with names like Eberhardt, Groeber, and Schlepergrel. Beginning at the close of the 19th century and through most of the 20th, growing numbers of Irish residents arrived and Woodside eventually became Irish enough to earn the nickname &quot;Irishtown&quot;.

A major turning point in the transition from German to Irish occurred in 1901 when the Greater New York Irish Athletic Association formally opened a large athletic complex called Celtic Park on the border between Woodside and Laurel Hill, its neighbor to the south. A second turning point was the death of Louis Windmuller, the last of the German estate owners. Prominent in local as well as city and national affairs, he was called the &quot;grand old man&quot; or &quot;patriarch&quot; of Woodside. Although the estate did not go out of his heirs&#x27; hands until the close of the Depression and beginning of World War II, his passing nonetheless helps mark Woodside&#x27;s transition from country village to suburban bedroom community. With large-scale residential development in the 1860s, Woodside became the largest Irish American community in Queens. In the early 1930s, the area was approximately 80% Irish. A subsequent influx of Irish occurred during the 1980s and into the early 1990s when many Irish immigrated to New York due to poor economic conditions in Ireland. Many of these &quot;new Irish&quot; settled in Woodside, where the men found work as construction workers or bartenders while the women worked as waitresses, nannies or domestics.

Toward the end of the 20th century, Irish dominance gradually yielded to a mixture of other nationalities, but even as the neighborhood has seen growth in ethnic diversity today, the area still retains a strong Irish American presence, and there continue to be a number of Irish pubs and restaurants scattered across Woodside. After World War II, families in the area were primarily of Irish, Italian, and Jewish descent. Gradually, Dominicans and other nationalities began to make an appearance in the community, beginning in the late 1960s. A trend of diversity began then, and has continued since. This diversity has been remarked upon by many observers and can be shown in residents&#x27; places of worship. For example, the Winfield Reformed Church began in 1880 as a Dutch Calvinist church and in 1969 became the first Taiwanese congregation in America. Others of Woodside&#x27;s places of worship now include ones that are Hindu, Thai Buddhist, Romanian Orthodox, Filipino, Korean, Chinese, and Bahraini. Woodside has a strong Muslim community and is home of a large, multipurpose organization, the Islamic Institute of New York. Among St. Sebastian Mass-goers, a priest reports that are about 45% are Hispanic (particularly from Colombia and Mexico), 25% Irish, 25% Filipino, and 5% Korean. In 1999, Woodsiders came from 49 countries and spoke 34 different languages.

In the early 1990s, many Asian American families moved into the area, particularly east of the 61st Street – Woodside subway station. In 2000, Woodside&#x27;s population was 30% Asian American. Woodside has a large population of Thai Americans, Korean Americans, Chinese Americans and Filipino Americans (see Koreatown, Chinatown, and Little Manila), each with their own respective ethnic enclave. There are also South Asian Americans, particularly Indian Americans, Bangladeshi Americans, Nepalese Americans, and Pakistani Americans, as well as a large Dominican and Latino population. Reflecting its longtime diverse foods and drink, the neighborhood is filled with many cultural restaurants and pubs. It is also home to some of the city&#x27;s most popular Thai, Filipino, Colombian, and Ecuadorian eateries. Woodside&#x27;s diversity lends itself to a number of festivals and street fairs. It commemorates Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day with a parade prior to the famous celebration in Manhattan. Woodside also hosts several events in the summer, including an Independence Day street fair.

===Little Manila===
&quot;Little Manila&quot;, or Filipinotown, stretches from 63rd-71st Streets on Roosevelt Avenue, where many Filipino-owned businesses have flocked to serve Woodside&#x27;s large Filipino American community; the neighborhood is known for its concentration of Filipinos. Filipino cafés and restaurants dominate the area, as well as several freight and remittance centers scattered throughout the neighborhood. Other Filipino-owned businesses including professional services (medical, dental, optical), driving schools, beauty salons, immigration services, and video rental places providing the latest movies from the Philippines dot the community. This area attracts many local Filipinos and non-Filipinos alike and from neighboring places of Long Island, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey.

In February 2008, the Bayanihan Filipino Community Center opened its doors in Woodside, a project spearheaded by the Philippine Forum. The Philippine Forum also hosts the annual Bayanihan Cultural Festival at the Hart Playground in September in commemoration of Filipino American History Month. The intersection of 70th Street and Roosevelt Avenue was co-named &quot;Little Manila Avenue&quot; on June 12, 2022, to celebrate the neighborhood&#x27;s Filipino community.

On June 12, 2022, a sign-unveiling ceremony and celebration were held at the intersection of 70th Street and Roosevelt Avenue to commemorate the Filipino community&#x27;s growing presence and contributions in Queens. Concomitantly, there is also a Roosevelt Avenue in Quezon City, Philippines. The corner in Queens was co-named &quot;Little Manila Avenue&quot;.

=== St. Patrick&#x27;s Day Parade ===

Woodside hosts New York City&#x27;s only Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day parade that invites members of New York City&#x27;s LGBTQ Irish community to march; it is called the St. Pat&#x27;s for All Parade. The parade was founded by LGBTQ+ rights activist Brendan Fay after the Irish Lesbian and Gay Organization (ILGO) was repeatedly denied permission to march in the Manhattan St. Patrick&#x27;s Day parade by the Ancient Order of Hibernians. The parade runds from Sunnyside to Woodside, with its starting point in 43rd Street and Skillman Avenue.

==== History of St. Pat&#x27;s for All ====

In 1991, the recently established gay and lesbian Irish organization ILGO was denied permission to march in the St. Patrick&#x27;s Day Parade on Fifth Avenue. When New York City Mayor Dinkins intervened on their behalf, ILGO members were allowed to march for that one time, but their presence was received with hostility from other marchers as well as the spectators, who openly hurled abuse at them and doused with beer. In the years that followed, ILGO members would be denied permission to march, respond by protesting at the parade, and get arrested. Two court rulings then further endorsed the exclusion of LGBTQ marchers: in 1993, Federal Judge Kevin Thomas Duffy of the Federal District Court in Manhattan rules that the Ancient Order of Hibernians can ban LGBTQ marchers from the St. Patrick&#x27;s&#x27; Parade in Manhattan; in 1995, the U.S. Supreme Court rules in Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Group of Boston that private citizens organizing a public demonstration may not be compelled by the state to include groups who impart a message the organizers do not want to be presented by their demonstration.

In the wake of these court rulings, Brendan Fay founds the Lavender and Green Alliance (LAG), which organizes an inclusive event &quot;open to anybody who wished to celebrate the spirit of Irishness and their connections to Ireland&quot; and name it &quot;St. Pat&#x27;s for All&quot;. The slogan of the parade,&quot;Cherishing All the Children of the Nation Equally,&quot; originates from the 1916 Easter Proclamation of the Irish Republic. The first parade was held on March 5, 2000.

The creation of the St. Pats for all parade provided a welcoming community for LGBT+ people of Irish descent and association. People of various cultures and backgrounds attend this parade for significant 

reasons. In the inaugural year of 2000, the parade attracted over 70 groups of people, including the Korean community honoring the important role that Irish nuns had played in their education, Chilean folk musicians honoring Bernardo O&#x27; Higgins, the founding father and first president of Chile, and the son of an Irish immigrant, children and their puppets, the Sunny Side Drum Corps, and LGBT organizations. Many never imagined being a part of a tradition that didn&#x27;t allow anything that distracted the Catholic expression. Woodside parade stands out because it welcomes anyone who wearing of green regardless of race, creed or sexual orientation. &quot;The St. Patrick&#x27;s parade is the most significant expression of Irish culture and celebration in this city, and the parade in Queens, for many of us, was a first-time experience. It was the first parade since the first St. Patrick&#x27;s parade in New York City, which was in 1762, [that] was open and welcoming to all&quot;.

The parade has attracted such politicians as former New York City mayors Rudy Giuliani and Michael Bloomberg; Jason West, mayor of New Paltz, New York; former congressman Joseph Crowley, who represented the district; and former U.S. Senator and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

St. Pat&#x27;s for All Parade celebrated its 20th anniversary on March 3, 2019.

Parks in the area include:

* Doughboy Plaza, bounded by Woodside Avenue, 52nd Street, and 39th Road. It was originally a children&#x27;s playground but is now a landscaped triangle.
* Windmuller Park (including Lawrence Virgilio Playground), between 39th Road and 39th Drive from 52nd to 54th Streets. It was named after Louis Windmuller, a local resident who was a German immigrant and a businessman. In 1936, Windmuller&#x27;s children donated the family land to the city and it developed shortly after under the Federal Works Progress Administration relief work program. In 2002, the park&#x27;s playground was named for Lawrence Virgilio (1962–2001), a New York City Firefighter who died in the World Trade Center in the 2001 September 11 attacks. Facilities include fields and courts for baseball and handball; a playground and spray shower; a running track; a swimming pool; and fitness equipment. In 2007, a capital investment project added an open-air stage, a renovated ADA-accessible public restroom, mini-pool, exercise track, pathways, fencing, basketball courts, and new exercise equipment.
*Big Bush Park, north side of Laurel Hill Boulevard between 61st and 64th Streets. In 1936, Mayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia (1882–1947, mayor 1934–1945) designated this land as parkland. In December 1936, the Regional Plan Association recommended the construction of a link between the Gowanus Parkway and the Triborough Bridge. The park was ultimately built on a plot of land created during the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway&#x27;s construction in the 1950s and opened in 1987, sixteen years after construction started. The park&#x27;s facilities include fields and courts for baseball, basketball, handball, and soccer; a playground with climbing structures, swings, slides, and sitting areas; a spray shower, and fitness equipment.
* Nathan Weidenbaum Playground, south side of Laurel Hill Boulevard at 61st Street. It was named after a local resident who was one of the first occupants of the Wynwoode Gardens Homes and advocated for improvements to the area.

==Structures==
As in other parts of New York City, centuries of tumultuous change have not totally obliterated old landmarks. Within Woodside, the double-decker station of the Long Island Rail Road (built in 1869) and the IRT Flushing Line (built in 1917) both remain, and were renovated in 1999. A trolley barn at Northern Boulevard and 51st Street has been preserved as the Tower Square Shopping Center. The New York and Queens Railroad Company built the barn in 1896. A transportation hub like the LIRR/IRT stations, it was the largest car barn in Queens.

Woodside also possesses an ancient tree, not the great chestnut (which was gone by the end of the 19th century) but a large copper beech of somewhere between 150 and 300 years&#x27; age. Documents in the archive of the Queens Historical Society suggest that it might have been planted during the time of the Revolutionary War.

Among the oldest of Woodside&#x27;s historic landmarks are its cemeteries. Calvary Cemetery was founded in 1845 by trustees of Manhattan&#x27;s St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral for Roman Catholic burials and was later expanded by the addition of three sections comprising New Calvary. Calvary and New Calvary&#x27;s combined contain over three million burials. Located on 54th Street between 31st &amp; 32nd Avenues, the Moore-Jackson Cemetery is much older and smaller than Calvary. Established in 1733, it is one of the oldest cemeteries in New York. Only fifteen graves remain visible, the earliest dated 1769.The Bulova Corporation has its headquarters in northern Woodside along Interstate 278. The headquarters opened in 1875.

Although few have been documented, some of Woodside&#x27;s old buildings still remain in place. Of those for which information is available, Woodside&#x27;s first church, St. Paul&#x27;s Protestant Episcopal, holds pride of place. It was damaged by fire in 2007 but still stands in its original location. An article published on the Forgotten NY weblog in 2005 lists this and other interesting structures from 19th century Woodside which have survived. All are located close to the center of town. They include the Hook and Ladder Company (1884), the home of Otto Groeber and his family (1870), the Woodside Pavilion (1877), and Meyer&#x27;s Hotel (1882). Another article on this blog shows structures from the early 20th century that are still standing. In addition, the Winfield Reformed Church is located in Woodside.

<text>Ramna Park (, or ) is a significant urban green space renowned for its historical significance and recreational amenities, situated at the centre of Dhaka, Bangladesh. Described as the &quot;lungs of Dhaka City,&quot; the park was built during the British colonial era with a lake at its core, undergoing several transformations over the years and evolving into a popular public space. Additionally, Ramna Park hosts cultural events and festivals, notably, the yearly Bengali New Year celebrations, further enriching its role as a communal space for relaxation and social gatherings.


==History==
=== Background ===
Before the early 20th century, the present-day site of Ramna Park comprised a vast empty expanse known as Ramna Plains. Situated in its midst was a sizable lake, while nearby stood a racecourse in Suhrawardy Udyan, both built by Dhaka&#x27;s magistrate Charles Dawes.

=== Construction and inauguration ===
In 1908, R.L. Proudlock from Kew Botanical Gardens in London was tasked with landscaping and enhancing the beauty of Ramna. Today&#x27;s renowned Ramna Park owes its development to his planning. The park&#x27;s design included lofty trees, vibrant flowering plants, gardens, and water features. The construction work of the main park spanned 20 years. Initially, a zoo operated in this vicinity, established by the Nawabs of Bengal, before being relocated to Mirpur.

Ramna Park was formally inaugurated in 1949, covering an area of . The expansive open spaces served as venues for fairs and exhibitions. Notably, in 1960, Queen Elizabeth II received a warm civic reception at Ramna Park during her visit to Dhaka.

=== Developments ===

The current layout of Ramna Park was conceptualised in 1952 by the Public Works Department of Bangladesh (formerly known as the C&amp;B Department). Enhancements to the park included deepening and extending the lake, constructing walkways and garden paths in stages, regrading and replanting sections, and implementing irrigation systems for the diverse range of tree saplings. To facilitate deep root growth, tree wells with deep vertical tubes or watering pipes were installed. Additionally, a bud-shaped water tower was erected on the park&#x27;s northern side to supply water to these facilities.

In 2020, Ramna Park was closed to the public as a precautionary measure to mitigate the spread of the Coronavirus pandemic. During this period of closure, a beautification drive were undertaken by the Public Works Department at a cost of , which involved the construction of a new wooden deck around the re-excavated lake, new lighting systems, and rebuilding of paths covered with red ceramic bricks and bituminous carpet. Additionally, a new cafe has been built and a corner of the park has been dedicated to children&#x27;s play area, while new flowers have been planted as part of the renovation work. The park was reopened towards the end of 2022.

=== Incidents ===
On 14 April 2001, during the Pohela Boishakh celebrations of the Bangla New Year, two bombs exploded at Ramna Park, resulting in the deaths of 10 individuals and injuries to several others. Subsequently, members of the Islamist group Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami were convicted in connection with the incident.

==Geography==

Ramna Park is situated at the centre of Dhaka and presently covers an area of , of which the lake covers . Walkways inside park have been widened and five new gates built for entry from different sides.

=== Flora ===
Ramna Park contains a total of 71 species of flowering plants, 36 species of fruit trees, 33 species of medicinal plants, and 41 species of forestry plants, along with an additional 11 species. 

Ornamental flower plant species include , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and . 

==Bengali New Year celebrations==
The yearly celebration of Bengali New Year, known as Pohela Boishakh, kicks off at dawn with arrangements made by the cultural organisation Chhayanaut, marking the beginning of the year at the historic Ramna Batamul banyan tree located in Ramna Park, which serves as the stage for a cultural extravaganza on Pohela Boishakh. During this festivity, women adorn themselves in white sarees with red borders, while men wear traditional Panjabi attire. Traditional music and dance are performed here.

<doc id="1345134" wikidata="Q663098" url="?curid=1345134" title="SynthAxe">
<text>The SynthAxe is a fretted, guitar-like MIDI controller, created by Bill Aitken, Mike Dixon, and Tony Sedivy and manufactured in England in 1985. It is a musical instrument that uses electronic synthesizers to produce sound and is controlled through the use of an arm resembling the neck of a guitar in form and in use. Its name comes from the words &quot;synthesizer&quot; and &quot;axe&quot;, a slang term meaning a guitar in rock music. The system was developed as a joint venture funded by Richard Branson&#x27;s Virgin Group.

The SynthAxe itself has no internal sound source; it is purely a controller and needs synthesizers to produce sound. The neck of the instrument is angled upwards from the body, and there are two independent sets of strings.

The fretboard is continuously scanned and sends signals to synthesizers which produce the sound. The left set determine the pitch played, through contact with the frets on the neck and by sensing the side-to-side bending of the string. The right set of strings are velocity sensitive; these strings can be plucked, strummed or damped in the same manner as a guitar. A keyboard made up of nine keys can also be used to trigger notes instead of the strings. Design of the key toggles was done by the late David Fowler, at the time trading under BJ Hopkins Injection and toolmaking, in Littleworth, Oxford.

An electronic tremolo bar (the &#x27;electronic wang arm&#x27;) can be used for standard whammy bar effects, or can be redefined to produce different MIDI output such as filter cutoffs or volume.

When originally produced, the SynthAxe was priced at £10,000 (approximately $13,000) and eventually sold for about £6,000. The instrument was built from aerospace and military grade hardware, and was such a sophisticated and expensive piece of machinery that few were sold, making it difficult to keep the company afloat. In or around 1986, Virgin Games took over the distribution but let it go after a couple of years.

Fewer than 100 SynthAxes were made, and it is difficult to locate used units. Most musicians who desire a MIDI guitar controller often use other alternatives, such as Roland or Axon systems that can convert a guitar&#x27;s output to MIDI via 13-pin cables and outboard devices or older systems such as the Roland GR-500.

==Notable users==
Prominent players of the SynthAxe included Allan Holdsworth, who used it extensively on his albums &quot;Atavachron&quot; (1986), &quot;Sand&quot; (1987) and &quot;Flat Tire: Music for a Non-Existent Movie&quot; (2001); Chuck Hammer, who worked with both Lou Reed and David Bowie, and was the earliest guitarist to use the SynthAxe in the United States; and Lee Ritenour, who used the SynthAxe on his album &quot;Earth Run&quot; (1986), the cover of which features the instrument.

Gary Moore featured the SynthAxe in the music video for few seconds for his 1985 single with Phil Lynott, &quot;Out in the Fields.&quot; Christopher Currell used it to control the Synclavier on Michael Jackson&#x27;s Bad tour Béla Fleck and the Flecktones drummer Future Man also uses a highly customised version of the SynthAxe that he purchased in its original form from Ritenour.

<doc id="1345136" wikidata="Q577057" url="?curid=1345136" title="Sphingomonadaceae">
<text>Sphingomonadaceae are a gram-negative bacterial family of the Alphaproteobacteria. An important feature is the presence of sphingolipids (mainly 2′-hydroxymyristoyl dihydrosphingosine 1-glucuronic acid, &quot;SGL-1&quot;) in the outer membrane of the cell wall. The cells are ovoid or rod-shaped. Others are also pleomorphic, i.e. the cells change the shape over time. Some species from Sphingomonadaceae family are dominant components of biofilms.

== Energy source ==
While most species within Sphingomonadaceae family are heterotrophic, some are phototrophic.

== Function ==
Some species of Sphingomonadaceae are known to degrade some aromatic compounds. This makes the bacteria of interest to environmental remediation.

The diverse metabolic capacity of genera within the &quot;Sphingomonadaceae&quot; family, such as &quot;Sphingobium&quot;, &quot;Novosphingobium&quot;, and &quot;Sphingopyxis&quot; enable these genera to adapt to and be abundant in the presence of bisphenol A. A microbial community with abundant &quot;Sphingomonadaceae&quot; members can degrade bisphenol A with a constant rate.

Some &quot;Sphingomonas&quot; species are able to produce sphingans, a kind of exopolysaccharides with certain viscosity. This property of sphingans makes it useful in many industries including food and pharmaceutical.

== Distribution ==
Bacteria within &quot;Sphingomonadaceae&quot; family are distributed in various environments, such as water, soil, sediment.

==Phylogeny==
The currently accepted taxonomy is based on the List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature and the phylogeny is based on whole-genome sequences.

== Interaction with human and plants ==
Some members of the &quot;Sphingomonadaceae&quot; commonly exist in human-impacted environments, including drinking water systems, hospital and household tap water, and medical devices.

Most of the species of the &quot;Sphingomonadaceae&quot; are not known to be harmful to humans or plants. Some species can protect plants from disease-causing pathogens such as &quot;Thielaviopsis basicola&quot;, and &quot;Rhizoctonia solani&quot;.

The &quot;Sphingomonas&quot; and &quot;Sphingobium&quot; genera tend to have higher antibiotic resistance compared with three other genera within the &quot;Sphingomonadaceae&quot;: &quot;Novosphingobium&quot;, &quot;Sphingopyxis&quot;, and &quot;Blastomonas&quot;.

<text>Baitul Mukarram (; ), officially Baitul Mukarram National Mosque (), is the national mosque of Bangladesh. It is located at the center of Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. The mosque was completed in 1968. It has a capacity of more than 42,000 worshipers.

==History==

The mosque complex was designed by architect, Abdulhusein M. Thariani. On 27 April 1959, Abdul Latif Ibrahim Bawani, owner of then Bawani Jute Mills, held a meeting at his house with GA Madani, Haji Abdul Latif Bawani, MH Adamji, S Sattar, Muhammad Sadiq, AZN Rezai Karim and Major General Umrao Khan. In that meeting he proposed to Major General Khan, then military administrator of East Pakistan, that a grand mosque be built in Dhaka. Umrao Khan agreed to help build such a mosque. The same year, a Baitul Mukarram mosque committee was established and 8.30 acres of land between new Dhaka and Old Dhaka was chosen for the site. At that time, there was a large pond in the present mosque&#x27;s location. It was known as Paltan pond. The pond was filled up and on 27 January 1960, then president of Pakistan Ayub Khan, commenced the work. Prayers took place for the first time on Friday, 25 January 1963. On 28 March 1975, the Government of Bangladesh entrusted the management of the mosque to the Islamic Foundation Bangladesh.

The mosque complex includes shops, offices, libraries and parking areas within it. Unusually, the mosque does not have a dome. In 2008, the mosque was extended, financed by a donation from the government of Saudi Arabia.

==Architecture==
The mosque has several modern architectural features whilst at the same time it preserves the traditional principles of Mughal architecture which has for some time been dominant in the Indian sub-continent. Baitul Mukarram&#x27;s large cube shape was modeled after that of the Kaaba at Mecca, making it a noticeable structure unlike any other mosque in Bangladesh.

===Exterior design===
The mosque is on a very high platform. The Baitul Mukarram National Mosque&#x27;s building is eight storied and 99 feet high from the ground level. According to the original plan, the main entrance of the mosque was to be on the eastern side. The &#x27;shaan&#x27; on the east is 29,000 square feet with ablution space on its south and north sides. Ablution or Wu&#x27;du Place cached an important part when the Baitul Mukarram was begun. The absence of a dome on the main building is compensated by the two superficial domed entrance porticoes, one on the south, and the other on the north. The height of these porticoes consists of three rabbit&#x27;s foot shaped arches, the middle of which is bigger than the rest.

===Interior design===
Two patios (roofless inner courtyard) ensure that enough light and air enter the prayer hall of Baitul Mukarram National Mosque. The prayer niché of the hall is rectangular instead of semi-circular. Excessive ornamentation is avoided throughout the mosque, since minimizing ornamentation is typical of modern architecture.

===Garden===
The garden is laid out in a style borrowed heavily from Mughal gardens, however unlike the traditional Mughal gardens which represent the Islamic Heaven, the garden does not have the Char-Bagh system, most likely due to not having enough room for such a garden. The future of this garden is unknown; if the Bangladeshi government extends the mosque, it will most likely have to remove the garden.

<text>Gustavus Franklin Swift, Sr. (June 24, 1839 – March 29, 1903) was an American business executive. He founded a meat-packing empire in the Midwest during the late 19th century, over which he presided until his death. He is credited with the development of the first practical ice-cooled railroad car, which allowed his company to ship dressed meats to all parts of the country and abroad, ushering in the &quot;era of cheap beef.&quot; Swift pioneered the use of animal by-products for the manufacture of soap, glue, fertilizer, various types of sundries, and even medical products.

Swift donated large sums of money to such institutions as the University of Chicago, the Methodist Episcopal Church, and YMCA. He established Northwestern University&#x27;s &quot;School of Oratory&quot; in memory of his daughter, Annie May Swift, who died while a student there. When he died in 1903, his company was valued at between US$125 million and $135 million, and had a workforce of more than 21,000. &quot;The House of Swift&quot; slaughtered as many as two million cattle, four million hogs, and two million sheep a year. Three years after his death, the value of the company&#x27;s capital stock topped $250 million. He and his family are interred in a mausoleum in Mount Hope Cemetery in Chicago.

==Biography==

Swift was born on June 24, 1839, in Sagamore, Massachusetts, the 9th of 12 offspring of William Swift and Sally Crowell. His parents were descendants of British settlers who went to New England in the 17th century. The family (which included Gustavus’ brothers Noble and Edwin) lived and worked on a farm in the Cape Cod town of West Sandwich, Massachusetts, where they raised and slaughtered cattle, sheep, and hogs. This is where he got the idea of packing meat.

As a young boy, Swift took little interest in his studies and left the nearby country school after eight years. During that period he was employed in several jobs, finally finding full-time work in his elder brother Noble&#x27;s butcher shop at the age of fourteen. Two years later, in 1855, he opened his own cattle and pork butchering business with the help of one of his uncles who gave him $400. Swift purchased livestock at the market in Brighton and drove them to Eastham, a ten-day journey. A shrewd businessman, he purportedly followed the somewhat common practice of denying his herds water during the last miles of the trip so that they would drink large quantities of liquid once they reached their final destination, effectively boosting their weights. Swift married Annie Maria Higgins of North Eastham in 1861. Annie gave birth to eleven children, nine of whom reached adulthood. In 1862, Swift and his new bride opened a small butcher shop and slaughterhouse. Seven years later Gustavus and Annie moved the family to the Brighton neighborhood of Boston, where in 1872 Swift became partner in a new venture, &quot;Hathaway and Swift&quot;. Swift and partner James A. Hathaway (a renowned Boston meat dealer) initially relocated the company to Albany, then almost immediately thereafter to Buffalo.

An astute cattle-buyer, Swift followed the market steadily westward. On his recommendation, Hathaway and Swift moved once more in 1875, this time to join the influx of meat packers setting up shop in Chicago&#x27;s sprawling Union Stock Yards. Swift established himself as one of the dominant figures of &quot;The Yards&quot;, and his distinctive delivery wagons became familiar fixtures on Chicago&#x27;s streets. In 1878 his partnership with Hathaway and &quot;Swift Bros and Company&quot; was formed in partnership with younger brother Edwin. The company became a driving force in the Chicago meat packing industry, and was incorporated in 1885 as &quot;Swift &amp; Co.&quot; with $300,000 in capital stock and Gustavus Swift as president. It is from this position that Swift led the way in revolutionizing how meat was processed, delivered, and sold.

He died on March 29, 1903, at his home 4848 Ellis Avenue in Chicago.

==Chicago and the birth of the meat-packing industry==
Following the end of the American Civil War, Chicago emerged as a major railway center, making it an ideal point for the distribution of livestock raised on the Great Plains to Eastern markets. Getting the animals to market required herds to be driven distances of up to to railheads in Kansas City, Missouri, where they were loaded into stock cars and transported live (on the hoof) to regional processing centers. Driving cattle across the plains led to tremendous weight loss, and a number of animals died in transit. Upon arrival at the local processing facility, livestock were either slaughtered by wholesalers and delivered fresh to nearby butcher shops for retail sale, smoked, or packed for shipment in barrels of salt.

Certain inefficiencies were inherent in the process of transporting live animals by rail, particularly due to the fact that approximately 60% of the animal&#x27;s mass is inedible. Many animals weakened by the long drive died in transit, further increasing the per-unit shipping cost. Swift&#x27;s solution to these problems was to devise a method to ship dressed meats from his packing plant in Chicago to the East.

==Advent of the refrigerator car==

A number of attempts were made during the mid-19th century to ship agricultural products via rail car. As early as 1842 the Western Railroad of Massachusetts was reported in the June 15 edition of the &quot;Boston Traveler&quot; to be experimenting with innovative freight car designs capable of carrying all types of perishable goods without spoilage. The first known refrigerated boxcar or &quot;reefer&quot; entered service on the Northern Railroad (or NRNY, which became part of the Rutland Railroad) in June 1851. This &quot;icebox on wheels&quot; was a limited success in that it was only able to function in cold weather. That same year, the Ogdensburg and Lake Champlain Railroad (O&amp;LC) began shipping butter to Boston in purpose-built freight cars, utilizing ice to cool the contents.

The first consignment of dressed beef to leave the Chicago stockyards was in 1857, and was carried in ordinary boxcars retrofitted with bins filled with ice. Placing the meat directly against ice resulted in discoloration and affected the taste, hence proved impractical. During the same period Swift experimented by moving cut meat using a string of ten boxcars which ran with their doors removed, and made a few test shipments to New York City during the winter months over the Grand Trunk Railway (GTR). The method proved too limited to be practical. Detroit&#x27;s William Davis patented a refrigerator car that employed metal racks to suspend the carcasses above a frozen mixture of ice and salt. He sold the design in 1868 to George H. Hammond, a Detroit meat-packer, who built a set of cars to transport his products to Boston using ice from the Great Lakes for cooling. The loads had the unfortunate tendency of swinging to one side when the car entered a curve at high speed, and the use of the units was discontinued after several derailments. In 1878 Swift hired engineer Andrew Chase to design a ventilated car that was well-insulated, and positioned the ice in a compartment at the top of the car, allowing the chilled air to flow naturally downward.

The meat was packed tightly at the bottom of the car to keep the center of gravity low and to prevent the cargo from shifting. Chase&#x27;s design proved to be a practical solution to providing temperature-controlled carriage of dressed meats, and allowed Swift &amp; Company to ship their products all over the United States, and internationally. This radically altered the meat business. Swift&#x27;s attempts to sell this design to the major railroads were unanimously rebuffed as the companies feared that they would jeopardize their considerable investments in stock cars and animal pens if refrigerated meat transport gained wide acceptance. In response, Swift financed the initial production run on his own, then — when the American railroads refused his business — he contracted with the GTR (a railroad that derived little income from transporting live cattle) to haul them into Michigan and then eastward through Canada. In 1880, the Peninsular Car Company (subsequently purchased by American Car &amp; Foundry) delivered to Swift the first of these units, and the Swift Refrigerator Line (SRL) was created. Within a year the Line&#x27;s roster had risen to nearly 200 units, and Swift was transporting an average of 3,000 carcasses a week to Boston. Competing firms such as Armour and Company quickly followed. By 1920 the SRL owned and operated 7,000 ice-cooled rail cars. The General American Transportation Corporation assumed ownership of the line in 1930.

==&quot;Everything but the squeal&quot;==
In response to public outcries to reduce the amount of pollutants generated by his packing plants, Swift sought innovative ways to use previously discarded portions of the animals his company butchered. This practice led to the wide scale commercial production of such diverse products as oleomargarine, soap, glue, fertilizer, hairbrushes, buttons, knife handles, and pharmaceutical preparations such as pepsin and insulin. Low-grade meats were canned in products like pork and beans.

The absence of any federal inspection led to many abuses in the packing plants. Spoiled meat, dead rats, sawdust and practically anything else might have been mixed with fresh meat and ground up into sausages. Rancid, rejected and unsold meat was frequently repackaged and resold. (Swift once bragged that his slaughterhouses had become so sophisticated that they used &quot;everything but the squeal.&quot;) Transgressions such as these were first documented in Upton Sinclair&#x27;s fictional novel &quot;The Jungle&quot;, the publication of which shocked the nation and led to the passing of the Federal Meat Inspection Act and Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906.

==Vertical integration==
The meat packing plants of Chicago were among the first to utilize assembly line (or in this case, disassembly-line) production techniques. Henry Ford states in his autobiography &quot;My Life and Work&quot; that it was a visit to a Chicago slaughterhouse which opened his eyes to the virtues of employing a moving conveyor system and fixed work stations in industrial applications. These practices symbolize the concept of &quot;rationalized organization of work&quot; to this day.

Swift adapted the methods of the industrial revolution to meat packing operations, which resulted in huge efficiency by allowing his plants to produce on a massive scale. The work was divided into myriad specific sub-tasks, which were carried out under the direction of supervisory personnel. Swift &amp; Co. was broken down organizationally into various divisions, each one responsible for conducting a different aspect of the business of &quot;bringing meat from the ranch to the consumer&quot;. By developing a vertically integrated company, Swift was able to control the sale of his meats from the slaughterhouse to the local butcher shop.

Swift devoted a great deal of time to indoctrinating employees and teaching them the company&#x27;s methods and policies. His employees also had fair wadges, whether it was man or women. He also motivated his employees to focus on the company&#x27;s profit goals by adhering to a strict policy of promotion from within. The innovations that Swift championed not only revolutionized the meat packing industry, but also played a vital role in establishing the modern American business system, with an emphasis on mass production, functional specialization, managerial expertise, national distribution networks, and adaptation to technological innovation.

Boreham is listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Borham&quot;, thought to mean &#x27;village on a hill&#x27;. King Henry VIII spent time at New Hall as did his daughter, Princess Mary.

Local legend holds that highwayman Dick Turpin rode down the route than now forms part of the A12 on his famous ride from London to York, although historians now believe the ride never occurred.
In the 1930s Boreham House and its surrounding land of was bought by car magnate Henry Ford. In addition to using the house as a school for training Ford tractor mechanics, the company&#x27;s British chairman, Lord Perry, established Fordson Estates Limited there, and founded the Henry Ford Institute of Agricultural Engineering, an agricultural college. The house also served as the temporary home for the National College of Agricultural Engineering in 1962. This moved to Silsoe, Bedfordshire as Silsoe College later joining with Cranfield University. The Silsoe campus closed at the end of 2007.

In 1952 a Ham class minesweeper, HMS &quot;Boreham&quot;, was named after the village.

Boreham remained relatively small until the mid-1970s when a programme of house and shop building increased its size significantly.

Boreham contains one of England&#x27;s few remaining independent family-run gunsmiths, which was established in 1795.

== Geography and administration ==
In addition to being a village, Boreham is a civil parish which has a parish council

The parish is bounded at its south by the River Chelmer. The village, which lies on a Roman road (now a modern trunk road, the A12), has a Norman church, and a public house (The Cock Inn) that dates from the 15th century. The surrounding countryside is slightly hilly and is used to grow crops such as wheat, sugar beet and peas.

The Great Eastern Main Line from Chelmsford to Colchester runs past the village. In the 1970s a bypass was built along the northern edge of the village, along the same route as the A12 and the nearby railway line.

The parish includes the hamlet of Russell Green at the north.

Boreham parish has a population of approximately 4,000 people, and covers about of land.

== Landmarks ==

Boreham has two designated conservation areas, which include buildings of historic importance. The Roman Road/Plantation Road Conservation Area contains, among others, a 16th-century timber-framed clockhouse. The Church Road Conservation Area has The Church, originally a small Saxon building, and several residential buildings.

=== New Hall School ===
One mile to the northwest of the village is New Hall School, once a palace of Henry VIII known as The Palace of Beaulieu. The estate on which it was built – the manor of Walhfare in Boreham – was granted to the Canons of Waltham Abbey in 1062. After a number of changes of possession, in 1491 it was granted by the Crown to the Earl of Ormond. By this time it had a house called New Hall.

In 1517 New Hall was sold by Thomas Boleyn, the father of Queen Anne Boleyn, to Henry VIII of England. The king rebuilt the house in brick at a cost of £17,000. He gave his new palace the name &quot;Beaulieu&quot;, though the name change did not outlast the century. New Hall was later the estate of the Tyrell family and latterly the Hoare banking family. In 1727, Benjamin Hoare commissioned architect Henry Flitcroft to build a new home nearby known as Boreham House, a stately home; the early Georgian mansion is now a Grade I listed building.
=== Boreham airfield and circuit ===

A forest near the village was felled in 1943 to build a military airfield, and the three runways of RAF Boreham opened in 1944. It hosted elements of the US Army Air Forces 394th Medium Bomb Group (flying B-26 Marauder bombers) and later the 315th Troop Carrier Group flying Dakotas. After the Second World War the three runways were adapted into a roughly triangular motor racing circuit Boreham Circuit, which held competitive meetings between 1949 and 1952. It was bought by Ford in 1955 for use as a development test track. Ford Motorsport moved to Boreham in 1963, and although some of the track was removed for gravel quarrying in 1996 the remaining track surface continues to be used for testing. Essex Police Air Support Unit have been based at the airfield and in 1990 began using Boreham airfield as a control centre for its fleet of helicopters. From 1997 to 2010, Essex Air Ambulance was also based at the site; it is now based at Earls Colne airfield.

=== Boreham Interchange ===
To the west of Boreham lies the A12 Boreham Interchange, at which is a service facility with a BP petrol station, a McDonald&#x27;s restaurant, and a Premier Inn motel. On the opposite side of the A12 is another Premier Inn and The Grange public house.

<doc id="1345160" wikidata="Q3542642" url="?curid=1345160" title="Ty Wigginton">
<text>Ty Allen Wigginton (born October 11, 1977) is an American former professional baseball infielder. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Mets, Pittsburgh Pirates, Tampa Bay Devil Rays, Houston Astros, Baltimore Orioles, Colorado Rockies, Philadelphia Phillies, and St. Louis Cardinals. He mainly played as a first and third baseman, but also platooned as an infielder and an outfielder during his career. He batted and threw right-handed. Wigginton resides in Chula Vista, California.

==Early life==
Wigginton attended Chula Vista High School in Chula Vista, California, and was a letter-man in football and baseball. Wigginton graduated from Chula Vista High School in 1995.

==Baseball career==
Wigginton attended UNC-Asheville and played for three years from to . Wigginton still holds the school&#x27;s records for most home runs in a game, most runs in a season, and most doubles in a season.

===New York Mets===
The 200-pound Wigginton was selected in the 17th round by the New York Mets in the 1998 Major League Baseball Draft.

Wigginton was called up to the Mets major league roster for the first time in as a third baseman and had a promising partial rookie season with the Mets, batting .302 with a .354 on-base percentage (OBP) and .526 slugging percentage (SLG) in 116 at-bats. He slumped somewhat in his first full season in with a batting line of .255/.318/.396 in 573 at-bats but started the season hot. In his first 312 at-bats, Wigginton hit .285/.334/.487, hitting 12 home runs and 23 doubles with 42 runs batted in.

===Pittsburgh Pirates===
On July 30, 2004, the Mets traded Wigginton to the Pittsburgh Pirates in a six-player deal for pitcher Kris Benson. Wigginton slumped badly after he was traded before recovering somewhat in September. In 2004, for the second straight year, he had the lowest zone rating of any NL third baseman (.731).

He started at third base for the Pirates in but again struggled and was demoted to the minor leagues on June 4, putting his future with Pittsburgh in doubt. After winning the International League Batter of the Week for the week of August 15–21, &quot;Wiggy&quot; was called up to the Pirates on August 22, 2005. The utility infielder caught fire, hitting .365 over his last 22 games for Pittsburgh. Despite this, the Pirates released him after the season.

===Tampa Bay Devil Rays===
Wigginton signed a one-year contract with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays on January 10, . He split his time between first base and second base in 2006 with a few starts at third base and in the outfield. He signed a three-year deal with the Tampa Bay Rays after the 2006 season.

===Houston Astros===
On July 28, , Wigginton was traded to the Houston Astros for pitcher Dan Wheeler. After his acquisition, Morgan Ensberg was designated for assignment, and Wigginton was announced as the Astros&#x27; starting third baseman. When Astros outfielder Carlos Lee had his finger broken by a pitch on August 9, 2008, Wigginton made the majority of the starts in left field in Lee&#x27;s place. Wigginton ended up having a strong month of August, hitting .379 and posting a staggering 1.200 OPS. He was named the National League&#x27;s co-Player of the Week along with Johan Santana for the period of August 11 to August 17; he had a .571 batting average with four home runs in that span. On December 12, 2008, the Astros failed to tender Wigginton a contract and he became a free agent, a controversial move that upset many Astros fans.

===Baltimore Orioles===
On February 10, , Wigginton signed a two-year contract with the Baltimore Orioles.

He hit very well during the early stages of the 2010 season, batting .272 through his first 60 games and ranking eighth in the American League with 13 home runs.

Wigginton was elected to his 1st All-Star Game in 2010, being the lone Oriole representative. Wigginton had started the season without a starting position in Baltimore.

He split games between third base and first base following the trade of Miguel Tejada.

===Colorado Rockies===
On December 7, 2010, Wigginton signed a two-year deal with the Colorado Rockies with an option for a third year.

On April 20, 2011, Wigginton collected his 1000th career hit, a home run off of Matt Cain of the San Francisco Giants. The home run was his first as a member of the Rockies.

On June 28, 2011, Wigginton and Troy Tulowitzki helped the Rockies win 3–2 in 13 innings. Ty Wigginton was up at bat against Chicago White Sox reliever Will Ohman. Tulowitzki, at first, was off with the pitch. Wigginton flared a ball into center that dropped for a base hit. Brent Lillibridge picked it up as Tulowitzki tried to score the walk-off run. The throw to A. J. Pierzynski was off the line. Tulowitzki slid into the plate just ahead of Pierzynski&#x27;s tag to score the walk-off.

===Philadelphia Phillies===

On November 20, 2011, the Rockies traded Wigginton to the Philadelphia Phillies for a player to be named later or cash. On October 29, 2012, the Phillies declined his 2013 club option worth $4 million; he was paid a $500,000 buyout and became a free agent. In his lone season with the Phillies, he hit .235/.314/.375 in 125 games with 11 home runs.

===St. Louis Cardinals===
On December 14, 2012, the St. Louis Cardinals signed Wigginton to a two-year contract. According to Ken Rosenthal of FoxSports.com, the deal was worth $5 million over the two seasons. He was signed to serve as a utility infielder and outfielder. He performed poorly off the bench, hitting .158 in 47 games and 57 at-bats. On July 9, 2013, he was given his unconditional release.

===Miami Marlins===
Wigginton signed a minor league deal with the Miami Marlins on January 24, 2014. He was released on March 25.

==Scouting report==
Wigginton showed slightly below-average power for a major league third baseman in his early career but displayed increased power as his career went on, ultimately averaging 20 home runs per 162 games played. He cut down on his strikeouts in 2004 and increased his number of walks, but his plate discipline was still no better than average. He hit fastballs well but struggled a little bit with good breaking balls. Wigginton had about average speed; he stole 12 bases in 2003 but never duplicated that (even in the minor leagues). On the field, he was slightly below average at third base. He also played second base, primarily in the earlier part of his career, but was similarly limited defensively at that position. He also played first and the outfield corners and was decent at first but has struggled in very limited playing time in the outfield.

Through the end of his major league career in July 2013, Wigginton had played in 1,362 major league games and hit .261 (1,170-for-4,479) with a .323 OBP, .435 SLG, 169 home runs, 245 doubles, 594 RBI, and 42 stolen bases.

==Personal life==
On December 20, 2006, Wigginton was forced to handle the delivery of his son Cannon at home when his wife Angela went into labor unexpectedly. Following the instructions of an operator on 9-1-1, he delivered the baby in a bedroom closet of their North Carolina home and tied off the umbilical cord with one of his shoelaces.

In an August 2015 &quot;Mooresville Weekly&quot; article, Wigginton was named the new head baseball coach for Lake Norman High School in Mooresville, North Carolina, replacing Trey Ramsey.

<text>Fishtown is a neighborhood in the River Wards section of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. Located northeast of Center City Philadelphia, its borders are somewhat disputed today due to many factors, but are roughly defined by the triangle created by the Delaware River, Front Street, and York Street. Some newer residents expand the area to Lehigh Avenue to the northeast, while some older residents shrink the area to Norris Street. It is served by the Market–Frankford Line rapid transit subway/elevated line of the SEPTA system, and the historic Route 15 Girard Avenue trolley line. Fishtown has long been a largely working class Irish Catholic and Irish American neighborhood, though in recent years it has seen a large influx of young urban professionals and gentrification.

The name Fishtown derives from one of the original occupations of its residents. Early settlers were fishermen, and over time they controlled the fishing rights to both sides of the Delaware River, from Cape May to the falls at Trenton. The apocryphal local legend traces the name of Fishtown to Charles Dickens, who purportedly visited the neighborhood in March 1842, but records show this to be false, as it was named Fishtown prior to his visit, at least as early as 1808, as evidenced in a newspaper article in &quot;The Tickler&quot;, an early 19th century Philadelphia newspaper.

==History==
The area was originally inhabited by members of the Turtle Clan of the Lenape Indian tribe (whom the Europeans named the Delaware Indian Tribe). The first European settlers were a group of six Swedish farming families, later replaced by British landed gentry, then British shipbuilders and German fishermen. Fishtown was originally a small section of the town of Old Kensington, close to the Delaware River and just a few blocks long, roughly from Palmer Street north to Gunnar&#x27;s Run, from the Delaware River to Moyer Street. The original town of Kensington was only 191.5 acres of land and originally called the Fairman Estate. Today&#x27;s Penn Treaty Park sits where the Fairman Mansion once stood (actually Fairman Mansion sat in the middle of Beach Street, curb to curb, right north of Columbia Avenue). 

Kensington was founded by Captain Anthony Palmer, an Englishman by way of Barbados. Using proceeds from the sale of the Hope Farm estate (present day Port Richmond), which included three slaves named Abraham, Hannibal, and Phillis, Palmer purchased the Fairman Estate in 1729 and laid out his town and sold parcels to the local fishermen and shipbuilders. Anthony Palmer eventually became active in the provincial council and became acting Governor of Pennsylvania in 1747–1748. Palmer died in 1749 and was buried in Christ Church Cemetery in Philadelphia. (The Kensington Burial Grounds in Fishtown, also known as Palmer Cemetery, was founded around 1732 and is still an active burial ground, situated on land deeded to the community by the Palmer Family after Anthony Palmer&#x27;s death. It is believed that the cemetery was in use from about the time Palmer started to lay out the town of Kensington, but the actual date of the first burial is unknown.)

Within a few generations there was another influx of German immigrants, then still later in the late 19th century Polish and Irish Catholic immigrants. The community had two Roman Catholic Churches, St. Laurentius, built by Polish immigrants, and the Holy Name of Jesus, built predominantly by Irish immigrants. Holy Name continues to serve as the parish church. St. Laurentius was sold to private developers and was to be turned into apartments, but became embroiled in legal disputes for years. Meanwhile, the structure deteriorated, leading to its eventual demolition beginning in 2022.
The neighborhood had been working class for centuries; while poverty grew after jobs left during the deindustrialization era, which afflicted many &quot;rust belt&quot; cities, Fishtown&#x27;s workers continued to maintain a stable working-class community. Fishtown was highly segregated in the mid-20th century: between 1950 and 1970, only 0.1-0.2% of the population was not white. Most long-time residents trace their ancestry to Irish, German, and Polish Catholic immigrants. In an analysis of 2013 data, Fishtown was the third most segregated white neighborhood in Philadelphia (after Girard Estates and Bridesburg), with 96% white residents. By 2024, the percentage of white residents had decreased further to 86%.

Since 2005 Fishtown has experienced moderate gentrification characterized by significant rises in housing prices and the opening of upscale art, entertainment, and dining establishments. An influx of artists and professionals has joined the ranks of police officers, fire fighters, nurses, carpenters, electricians, stonemasons, plumbers, sheet-metal workers, and teamsters. As of 2023, the neighborhood was one of the highest income in Philadelphia.

The neighborhood was chosen by the state of Pennsylvania to be the site of the Rivers Casino Philadelphia gaming complex on Delaware Avenue near Frankford Avenue. This choice deeply divided the neighborhood, causing conflict between those who believe it will bring jobs and economic development and those who believe it will lead to increased crime, addiction, and other social problems which negatively impact quality of life. A Community Benefits Agreement was reached between SugarHouse Casino (now Rivers Casino) and the membership of Fishtown Action and the New Kensington CDC, which will provide money for community projects that would not otherwise be available to the residents.

==Education==

The School District of Philadelphia operates public schools. Alexander Adaire School is the elementary school of the community. Penn Treaty School (formerly Penn Treaty Middle School), grades 6–12, is in Fishtown. Residents were previously zoned to Kensington High School.

St. Laurentius School is located in Fishtown.

==In popular culture==
In the book &quot;Coming Apart: The State of White America, 1960–2010&quot; (2012), Charles Murray names an imagined entity of white working class decay for Fishtown, inspired by Fishtown, Philadelphia.

The comic book &quot;Fishtown&quot; (2007–8), by Kevin Colden, portrays a murder that occurred in Fishtown, based on the 2003 Murder of Jason Sweeney.

The neighborhood was partially filmed in and is a focal point in several episodes of the 2020 AMC television series &quot;Dispatches from Elsewhere&quot;, created by and starring Jason Segel.

Season 5 of Netflix&#x27;s reboot series &quot;Queer Eye&quot; was shot in Philadelphia. Fishtown was the primary recording location for episode 1 &quot;Preaching Out Loud&quot;.

<doc id="1345167" wikidata="Q6256242" url="?curid=1345167" title="John Samuel Eastwood">
<text>John Samuel Eastwood (1857, in Minnesota – 1924, in California) was an American engineer who built the world&#x27;s first reinforced concrete multiple-arch dam on bedrock foundation at Hume Lake, California, in 1908, and was one of California&#x27;s pioneers of hydroelectric power production. Eastwood&#x27;s papers are held at the Water Resources Collections and Archives, University of California, Riverside.

== Early life ==
Born to Dutch parents in 1857 in Minnesota, Eastwood attended the University of Minnesota as a civil engineering student; prior to graduation in 1880 he headed west to work on railroad construction projects in the Pacific Northwest, including on the Northern Pacific Railroad. In 1883, he moved to Fresno, California and established an office as civil engineer and surveyor. He became Fresno&#x27;s first City Engineer in 1885, but apparently was not well suited for office–bureaucratic life and soon resigned. For the remainder of his career he focused on work within the private sector or as a consulting engineer. In 1886, Eastwood began work for the Smith &amp; Moore Lumber Company (later known as the Kings River Lumber Co.) laying out the right of way for the company&#x27;s 54 mi. long lumber flume to the Sanger, Ca. lumber yards and estimating the potential yield of timber lots in the Converse Basin. 

Early in 1895, he became chief engineer of the San Joaquin Electric Company, and was responsible for the design and construction of one of California&#x27;s early hydroelectric plants. As described by George Low in the April 1896 &quot;Journal of Electricity&quot;, Eastwood employed the nascent technology of long-distance alternating current power transmission in creating a hydroelectric power system for the Fresno area. At the time, Eastwood&#x27;s hydroelectric plant was considered a groundbreaking achievement, due to its record setting penstock head (1,410 ft.), long-distance power transmission (35 miles), and high voltage 3-phase output (11,000 volts). Unfortunately, the financial capabilities of the company proved insufficient to meet the great cost of constructing the dam in the remote reaches of the mountains, and, as a result, Eastwood was forced to rely on an undammed, natural supply of water to drive the turbines and generators. It was this inability to impound and store runoff, along with interference in seasonal water runoff by the Fresno Gas and Electric Company, that led to the demise of the San Joaquin Electric Company in 1899 after a long drought dried up the North Fork of the San Joaquin River.

== Big Creek Complex ==

Shortly thereafter, Eastwood became engaged with the Pacific Light and Power Company as engineer in charge of designing a large hydroelectric project on the South Fork of the San Joaquin River. This has since become known as the Big Creek Hydroelectric Project, presently operated by the Southern California Edison Company. The Pacific Light and Power Company was controlled by the famous financier and electric railroad magnate Henry Huntington, in partnership with A.G. Wishon, Alan C. Balch, and William Kerckhoff. Eastwood had great hopes for the Big Creek project, and he planned it to include storage dams to ensure that a drought could not stop its power production.

Although Big Creek was for the most part designed prior to 1907, financial difficulties associated with the Panic of 1907 delayed Huntington&#x27;s ability to initiate construction for several years. While designing the Big Creek project, Eastwood had devised an inexpensive type of reinforced concrete dam design which minimized the amount of material required and, consequently, reduced construction costs. In 1908, while waiting for work on Big Creek to begin, he designed and built the Hume Lake Dam for the Hume-Bennett Lumber Company. This structure is located in the Sierra Nevada about forty-five miles south of Big Creek. The first of its kind, its completion in 1909 demonstrated the practicality of the multiple-arch design. Shortly thereafter, Eastwood received the contract for the design of a multiple-arch dam to supersede the 1884 Big Bear Valley Arch Dam near San Bernardino in Southern California.

Eastwood envisaged the use of multiple-arch dams in the construction of the Big Creek project, but these hopes were dashed when, in November 1910, he was dismissed from all association with the project. Although he was awarded 5,400 shares of stock in the newly formed Pacific Light and Power Corporation (which was legally distinct from the earlier PL&amp;P Company), this financial interest soon disappeared when in the summer of 1912 Huntington, as majority stockholder, assessed all owners of Pacific Light and Power Corporation stock $5 per share to help pay for the construction of Big Creek. Unable to pay the assessment ($27,000) on his stock, Eastwood was forced to relinquish his stake in the PL&amp;P Corporation. Following this abrupt separation from the Big Creek project at the age of 53, Eastwood was left with only modest financial holdings and, as a means of survival, he began actively pursuing a career devoted to the design of multiple arch dams.

== Multiple arch dams ==

In the early 20th century, Salt Lake City regularly experienced severe water shortages in mid-winter and late summer. To alleviate this, bonds were floated in 1914 to finance the construction of three storage dams, the largest being Mountain Dell Dam in Parley&#x27;s Canyon, ten miles east of the city, that was built in two stages from 1914 to 1925.

Earlier, Eastwood had built four dams in California and his reputation as dam designer was growing. He had written several articles in &quot;Western Engineering&quot; describing his Big Bear Valley Dam, Los Verjeles Dam (in Yuba County, California) and Kennedy Dam (in Jackson, California), and had also published a four-page promotional &quot;supplement&quot; distribution with copies of the March 1915 &quot;Western Engineering&quot;.

Following the initial construction of Mountain Dell Dam, Eastwood continued his career in water resource development and dam design, becoming involved in projects in California, Idaho, Arizona, Mexico, and British Columbia.

He was not an &quot;armchair engineer&quot;, and he spent much of his life in the field working on practical problems of water control. He worked as a practicing engineer until the end of his life, when, in August 1924, at the age of 67, he drowned while swimming in the Kings River east of Fresno. He was buried in Mountain View Cemetery near Fresno, a cemetery that he had surveyed and laid out during his time as Fresno&#x27;s first City Engineer. 

The Eastwood powerhouse at Shaver Lake, California was named after him. Built in 1987, the 200 MW pumped storage hydroelectric plant is located underground and was carved out of solid granite.
