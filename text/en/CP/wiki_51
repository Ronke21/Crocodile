<text>The Battle of Ourique () took place on 25 July 1139, in which the forces of Portuguese count Afonso Henriques (of the House of Burgundy) defeated those led by the Almoravid governor of Córdoba, Muhammad Az-Zubayr Ibn Umar, identified as &quot;King Ismar&quot; in Christian chronicles.

==Background==
Learning that during his Battle of Valdevez against Alfonso VII of León, Muslim forces had attacked and destroyed Leiria and Trancoso, Afonso Henriques&#x27;s anxiety at this incursion at his southern frontier hastened his negotiations with Alfonso VII of León, leading to the Treaty of Zamora and freeing Afonso Henriques&#x27;s troops to deal with the Muslim attack.

==Battle==

Historians are divided as to the location of this battle. At the time, the name &quot;Ourique&quot; designated a large area south of Beja. Since 12th-century chroniclers were unfamiliar with the region where the battle took place, they might have decided to call the location &quot;field of Ourique&quot; for lack of a more precise term. Nonetheless, the great distance that separated Ourique from the Christian lines farther north has led some historians to suggest various localities in central Portugal, abandoning the traditional idea that the combat occurred in Ourique in the Alentejo. It would have been difficult for the then Count of Portugal, with a realm little beyond the Mondego River, to go all the way south to battle five Muslim kings. One plausible alternative is Vila Chã de Ourique, some from Santarém.

However, incursions by Christian armies deep in Muslim territory were not unheard of. Alfonso VII had directed expeditions that had reached Cordoba and Seville, well beyond the limits of Castillian dominions, and in 1147 he managed to conquer the Mediterranean port of Almería, south of Granada. This was possible because the largest Almoravid armies were positioned at the frontier, while armies stationed in small towns would rather retreat into their castles than face a strong enemy force. It is feasible that Afonso led a raid into the Gharb, and then, while retreating, was intercepted by a sizable Almoravid force intending to crush his army and recover the spoils taken by the Portuguese.

Before the battle, Count Afonso was hailed as &quot;rex&quot; (king) by his men in the Germanic fashion, by being lifted atop his shield by the leading nobles of Portugal.

Despite the fact that the Christian Portuguese forces were strongly outnumbered, the Muslim armies were weakened by internal leadership problems, which led to Afonso Henriques&#x27;s victory and subsequently his proclamation as King of the Portuguese, as Afonso I, with the support from his troops, vanquishing and slaying, so legend says, five Muslim kings.

The earliest accounts provide little detail. In one account the Muslim forces are led by five kings (&quot;Life of St. Theotonius&quot;), while in another, they are under the command of one king, Ismar (&quot;Chronicles&quot;). In the more detailed &quot;Chronicle of the Goths&quot;, Ismar waited until Henriques penetrated into Muslim territory, then systematically sent his troops from Seville, Badajoz, Elvas, Évora, and Beja against the Portuguese count. It is thus possible that the five kings were actually the leaders of the Almoravid garrisons of each of the Andalusi cities, under the overall command of the Almoravid governor of Cordoba, Muhammad Az-Zubayr Ibn Umar. Further, the Portuguese forces were surrounded on the hilltop where they encamped, Ismar hosted knights, who were executed later by Henriques, and that the Muslim king escaped in defeat. Arabic and Spanish accounts do not clarify the circumstances, and they even confuse the issue, identifying the Ismar as, alternatively, Ismar Abuzicri or Ismar and Abuzicri, with later historians identifying Abu Zakariya, the governor of Santarém, as the protagonist. It is also likely that the numbers were inflated by the chroniclers from a large-scale raid to grand assault by Muslim forces.

==Aftermath==
Shortly after the battle, Afonso Henriques is said to have called for the first assembly of the estates-general () of Portugal at Lamego, where he was given the crown from the Primate Archbishop of Braga, to confirm the Portuguese independence from the Kingdom of León. This was a patriotic falsification perpetuated by the clergy, nobility, and supporters who promoted the restoration of Portuguese sovereignty and the claims of John IV, after the Iberian Union. The documents that refer to the estates-general were &quot;deciphered&quot; by Cistercian monks from the Monastery of Alcobaça to perpetuate the myth and justify the legitimacy of the Portuguese crown in the 17th century. The author of this falsification was Oliveira Marques, and even in 1632 there were misgivings about the validity of the chronicler&#x27;s account or the existence of the Cortes of Lamego The account continued to support the notion that a meeting of the Cortes occurred in the Church of Santa Maria de Almacave, in Lamego, in 1143. During this meeting, after being acclaimed by estates-general, Afonso Henriques accepted a group of laws on royal succession and excluded the Castilian line of kings from the Portuguese throne, made provisions for the nobility on justice and the independence of Portugal. However, even as Spanish jurists and diplomats later demonstrated that the document was not creditable, the Portuguese defended the authenticity of the account. Alexandre Herculano later recounted the patriotic re-imagining in his &quot;História de Portugal&quot;, which caused its own controversy, and was later perpetuated by the writings of Alfredo Pimenta (who defended the existence of the Cortes of Lamego).

In commemoration of the Battle of Ourique, the first Portuguese coat-of-arms appeared that included five small shields, to represent the five defeated Muslim kings (from one interpretation), which was later challenged by many authors.

===Legend===

Some years later, the idea of a miraculous intervention in the battle by Saint James in favor of the Portuguese appeared in the chronicles of the battle. Saint James was widely venerated in Iberia (with a main centre of veneration in Santiago de Compostela, in Galicia, where his tomb was believed to be), being generally seen as the . As a consequence of Portuguese independence this legend was embellished with time to distance the Portuguese from Spanish devotional practices and beliefs. Later interpretations replaced Saint James with Saint George and, finally, with Jesus Christ.

In the legend, Henriques was visited before the battle by an old man who saw in a dream that Henriques would be victorious because God would intervene in his favour. He advised the nobleman to leave the encampment alone when he heard the bell of the local chapel. Riding off he was surprised by a ray of light that showed him (in one interpretation) the sign of the cross and Jesus Christ on a crucifix. Henriques knelt in its presence and heard the voice of Christ, who told him he would defeat the Almoravids, which he, through courage and his faith, succeeded the following day.

The legend of the miracle of the Battle of Ourique served thus as a political instrument to defend Portuguese independence as divine will. Yet, the legend, possibly earlier, knows its first known record in the early 15th century by the monks of the Monastery of Santa Cruz, during the battles between John and the Kingdom of Castile. Some modern authors claim that it is a creation of the monks, or forged by these, while not presenting evidence to support their theory, being, according to others, a long popular and royal belief tradition. The legend first appeared in the &quot;Crónica de Portugal de 1419&quot; and was accepted as fact until Alexandre Herculano reexamined the event, judging it a &quot;pious fraud&quot;, in his investigation in the middle of the 19th century.

<doc id="1335595" wikidata="Q272142" url="?curid=1335595" title="Æscwine of Wessex">
<text>Æscwine was a King of Wessex from about 674 to 676, but was probably not the only king in Wessex at the time.

Bede writes that after the death of King Cenwalh in 672: &quot;his under-rulers took upon them the kingdom of the people, and dividing it among themselves, held it ten years&quot;. According to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; Cenwalh was succeeded as ruler for about one year by his wife Seaxburh. Æscwine reigned from about 674 to 676. Another source claims that Æscwine&#x27;s father, Cenfus (), ruled for two years after Seaxburh.

The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; supplies a genealogy, making him a fifth-generation descendant of Cynric. Bede&#x27;s dismissal of Æscwine as a mere sub-king may represent the views of the supporters of the King Ine of Wessex, whose family ruled Wessex in Bede&#x27;s time, as Ine&#x27;s family were &quot;bona fide&quot; descendants of Cynric through Ceawlin&#x27;s son Cuthwine.

In 675, Æscwine defeated an invasion of Wessex led by the Mercian King Wulfhere at &quot;Biedanheafde&quot;, a location which has not been certainly identified.

Æscwine was succeeded by Centwine of Wessex.

<doc id="1335597" wikidata="Q506453" url="?curid=1335597" title="Tony Sheridan">
<text>Anthony Esmond Sheridan McGinnity (21 May 1940 – 16 February 2013), known professionally as Tony Sheridan, was an English rock and roll guitarist who spent much of his adult life in Germany. He was best known as an early collaborator of the Beatles (though the record was labelled as being with &quot;The Beat Brothers&quot;), one of two non-Beatles (the other being Billy Preston) to receive label performance credit on a record with the group, and the only non-Beatle to appear as lead singer on a Beatles recording which charted as a single.

==Childhood and Early career==
Sheridan was born on 21 May 1940 in Norwich, Norfolk, where he grew up at 2 Hansell Road in Thorpe St Andrew and attended the City of Norwich School. His parents, Alphonsus McGinnity and Audrey Mann, were married in Norwich in 1939. 

=== Childhood ===
In his early life, Sheridan was influenced by their interest in classical music, and by age seven, he had learned to play the violin. After studying violin at Bignold Infants School (known as Crooks Place) he moved on to the City of Norwich School where he proved himself to be a highly gifted young man. He had a leading role in the school production of The Mikado in 1951 and played the violin in the orchestra.

=== Career launch ===
He eventually came to play guitar, and in 1956, formed his first skiffle band. &quot;From the moment Tony picked up a guitar he attracted the crowds and queues would form outside the Red Lion in St George&#x27;s [parish] where people were desperate to hear him play. During the 1950s he was one of the first skiffle kids – playing first at Thorpe [Hall] with his group The Cygnets and The Saints. But there was only one way up for up and coming rockers in England of the late 1950s, and that was The 2i&#x27;s Coffee Bar in London&#x27;s Soho, where he headed. He showed enough talent that he soon found himself playing there for some six months straight.

=== Notoriety growing on television ===
In 1958, only two years after starting to play in the skiffle band which he formed, at age 18, he and another young rocker from Norwich, Kenny Packwood, began appearing live on the &quot;Oh Boy!&quot; television show, made by the ITV contractor ABC, playing electric guitar on such early rock classics as Carl Perkins&#x27; &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot;and &quot;Glad All Over&quot;, Roy Brown&#x27;s &quot;Mighty Mighty Man&quot; and Buddy Holly&#x27;s &quot;Oh, Boy!&quot; which was the theme song of the show. He also played Roy Orbison&#x27;s &quot;I Like Love&quot; of which remains a rare footage on YouTube. 

=== Recruited as guitarist by renowned artists ===
&quot;It was said that Tony was the first musician to play electric guitar live on TV. In those days, few people could make an electric guitar sound the way Tony could and he played session guitar on a whole host of hit records&quot;. 

He was soon employed backing a number of singers, reportedly including Gene Vincent and Conway Twitty while they were in England.

In 1958 Johnny Foster sought to recruit Sheridan as a guitar player in Cliff Richard&#x27;s backing band (soon renamed the Shadows), but after failing to find him at the 2i&#x27;s Coffee Bar opted for another guitarist who was there, Hank Marvin. 

In 1959 he played the guitar solo on Cherry Wainer&#x27;s studio recording of &quot;The Happy Organ&quot;.

&quot;Early in 1960, he performed in a tour of the UK, along with Gene Vincent and Eddie Cochran. On 16 April, Vincent and Cochran rebuffed his request to ride along with them to the next venue. He therefore escaped the road accident which would leave Cochran dead and Vincent badly injured.&quot;

=== Disrepute in England and recovery in Hamburg === 
Despite these successes, his penchant for being late, showing up without his guitar, etc., soon got him a reputation for having gone a bit &quot;haywire&quot;, and cost him much of his professional standing in England. Providentially, an offer for a gig came from Bruno Koschmider&#x27;s &quot;Kaiserkeller&quot; club in Hamburg, West Germany for an English group to play there. Sheridan and others (including Colin &quot;Melander&quot; Crawley) joined an ad hoc group promptly dubbed &quot;The Jets&quot; and were put on the ship headed for Hamburg. As fate would have it, legal woes (i.e. lack of proper papers) caused &quot;The Jets&quot; to not last long, but Sheridan (and now-friend Crawley) were soon back onstage in Hamburg.

While performing in Hamburg between 1960 and 1963, Sheridan employed various backup bands, most of which were really &quot;pickup bands&quot;, or simply an amalgam of various musicians, rather than a group proper (though almost always including now bassist Colin &quot;Melander&quot; Crawley and usually top-pianist Roy Young). However, in 1961, the young Beatles (with their line-up at the time of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, Stuart Sutcliffe and Pete Best) who had met and admired Sheridan during their first visit to Hamburg in 1960, and who worked with him on their second visit, became even closer. The Beatles sometimes backed Sheridan, who, in turn, often joined the Beatles during their own sets backing them on guitar. They even visited Sheridan&#x27;s home and had jam sessions in the back garden.

Ringo Starr briefly played in Sheridan&#x27;s backing band during very early 1962, before returning to Rory Storm and the Hurricanes. Starr was reportedly unhappy with Sheridan performing songs he had not rehearsed with his band (other musicians made the same complaint, as well as about Sheridan&#x27;s penchant for fist-fights).

== Polydor recordings with The Beatles ==
When a colleague of German Polydor producer/A &amp; R man Bert Kaempfert saw the pairing on stage, he suggested that Sheridan and the Beatles make some recordings together. Kaempfert viewed Sheridan as the one with &quot;star&quot; potential, and though Kaempfert&#x27;s production company signed the Beatles to play on Sheridan&#x27;s records, the contract stipulated that the four Beatles (Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Best) were guaranteed to play on a minimum of two songs. Of the seven songs recorded during Sheridan&#x27;s two-day-long sessions for Polydor in June 1961, at times the band behind Sheridan would be down to only two Beatles (Paul McCartney and Pete Best). Conversely some say that only on their two songs do all four Beatles play (minus Sheridan), while Sheridan plays on all of his tracks. John Lennon&#x27;s rhythm guitar is heard only on the two Beatles tracks (though his voice is heard in background vocals as well as his handclaps on Sheridan&#x27;s tracks) (per &quot;Beatles Deeper Undercover&quot; by Kristopher Engelhardt, p. 302). During these sessions at Polydor were produced a total of nine songs, seven of them for Sheridan: &quot;My Bonnie&quot;, &quot;The Saints&quot;, &quot;Why&quot;, &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Child&quot;, &quot;If You Love Me, Baby (Take Out Some Insurance On Me Baby)&quot;, &quot;Sweet Georgia Brown&quot; and &quot;Swanee River&quot; (this last recording is now lost, but it was recorded later on by Sheridan with another backup group). Two more songs without Sheridan were recorded by The Beatles: &quot;Ain&#x27;t She Sweet&quot; and 
&quot;Cry for a Shadow&quot; (formerly titled &quot;Beatle Bop&quot;).

About his singing in the beginning of his career, mainly during the early period of his recordings with Polydor, it was often said that 
&quot;Sheridan didn&#x27;t have a lot of originality, his performances mostly channeling Elvis&quot;.

Polydor&#x27;s beliefs in Sheridan&#x27;s coming stardom were so strong that they buried the two Beatles tracks until much later. Additionally John Lennon, Pete Best and Tony Sheridan all swore that there were several other Beatles tracks that were recorded during the two-day session, but they have not surfaced. In the spring of 1962 in order to fulfill contractual obligations, the four surviving Beatles (plus Roy Young but without Sheridan) recorded an instrumental version of &quot;Sweet Georgia Brown&quot;; later, Sheridan cut his vocal overdub for the song while solo in the studio. (Reportedly &quot;Swanee River&quot; was also recorded by the Beatles and Roy Young, though Polydor released a version in 1962 on Sheridan&#x27;s album &quot;My Bonnie&quot;; however, Polydor states they&#x27;ve never found this last recording). A newspaper story of the day also mentioned that Sheridan had recorded &quot;You Are My Sunshine&quot; with the Beatles as well for single release (it was also on his album as well).

In 1962, after a series of singles (the first of which, &quot;My Bonnie&quot;/&quot;The Saints&quot; made it to number 5 in the German chart), the record was released in America on Decca with a black label and also in a pink label for demo play. The record has the distinction of being one of the most expensive collectible 45 rpm with the black label in mint condition selling for $15,000 in 2007 and the pink label selling for $3000.

Also in 1962, Polydor released the album &quot;My Bonnie&quot; across West Germany. The word &quot;Beatles&quot; was judged to sound too similar to the Hamburgisch dialect word &quot;Pidels&quot; (pronounced &quot;peedles&quot;), the plural of a slang term for penis, hence the album was credited to &quot;Tony Sheridan and the Beat Brothers&quot;. After the Beatles had gained fame, the album was re-released in the United Kingdom, with the credit altered to &quot;Tony Sheridan and the Beatles&quot;. The Beatles&#x27; Hamburg studio recordings, as well as some live recordings from the same period, have been reissued many times.

==Later career==

In the mid-1960s, Sheridan&#x27;s musical style underwent a drastic transformation, away from his rock and roll roots and towards a more blues- and jazz-oriented sound. Though those recordings were praised by some, many fans of his earlier work felt disappointed. The change was presaged by liner notes from his 1964 album, &quot;Just a Little Bit of Tony Sheridan&quot;, in which his musical preferences are listed as &quot;jazz and classical&quot; rather than rock. The liner notes also mention his wanting to visit the southern US &quot;to hear at first hand the original negro music and experience the atmosphere that has been instrumental in creating negro jazz and the spiritual, for which he has a great liking.&quot; During 1967, Polydor continued releasing Tony Sheridan singles recorded German producer Jimmy Bowien, though they only ever released two albums by him.

By 1967, Sheridan had become disillusioned with his Beatle-brought fame. Because he was more concerned by the Vietnam War and the thought of further Communist aggression, Sheridan agreed to perform for the Allied troops. While in Vietnam, the band that he had assembled was fired upon and one of the members was killed. For his work entertaining the troops, Sheridan was made an honorary Captain of the United States Army. Due to the repeated shellings he experienced in Vietnam, Sheridan henceforth suffered from great sensitivity to the sounds of any kind of explosions, even fireworks.

With his Polydor contract gone, Sheridan did what he could to survive. In the early 1970s, he managed to cut a single as a pop duo, teamed with Carole Bell, and they toured Europe together with fair success. Following that phase he returned to playing in West Germany (usually Hamburg) or London. The mid-1970s saw him deejaying a West German radio programme of blues music, which was well received. He then managed to record an entire live album of early rock classics, a number of which had been part of his and the early Beatles live act but had never been released.

In 1978, a record producer in the United States heard Sheridan&#x27;s early Polydor recordings (with and without the young Beatles), and was impressed by Sheridan&#x27;s singing and playing. Sheridan immediately accepted an offer to record a whole studio album in Los Angeles. Elvis Presley&#x27;s TCB Band, not working at the time, was hired to play on the album along with top bassist (and former Hamburg friend) Klaus Voormann. An album of rock classics plus a few country tunes resulted but, with no major label release, it was restricted to direct TV sales. Thus, the prospect of a long American career in Las Vegas evaporated.

In 1978, the Star Club was reopened, and Sheridan performed there along with Elvis Presley&#x27;s TCB Band.

In 1991, Joe Sunseri, Sheridan&#x27;s biographer and then-manager, completed &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Child: The Tony Sheridan Story&quot;. However, due to a falling-out, the biography remained unpublished.

On 13 August 2002, after a long hiatus away from the record industry, Bear Family Records released Sheridan&#x27;s album &quot;Vagabond&quot;, essentially a collection of his own material, except for a new cover version of &quot;Skinny Minnie&quot;, a Bill Haley song he had recorded years earlier for his first album &quot;My Bonnie&quot;. &quot;Vagabond&quot; was essentially different from his previous repertoire, consisting mainly in reflective ballads. &quot;His development as an artist and on a personal and spiritual level makes Vagabond an interesting departure that bona fide r’n’r that made his reputation on the Hamburg scene way back in the 60&#x27;s. Those who know his story know that he gradually departed from that said scene after his experiences in Viet Nam and his search for spiritual awareness.&quot;. &quot;Vagabond&quot; can be heard on YouTube.

In 2002, the Argentinian rock musician Charly Garcia recorded his album &quot;Influencia&quot;, on which Tony Sheridan contributed as a singer/guitarist on the song &quot;I&#x27;m Not in Love&quot;. The song can be heard on YouTube.

In 2003, Sheridan produced a DVD on which there was a 24 minutes video clip, where he gives us a guided tour of the St. Pauli district, showing us the main venues and places where himself, The Beatles and other musicians would perform, hang out and sleep when they played at the Star-Club, the Kaiserkeller and other clubs in Hamburg. He also reminisces about the day-to-day life of them as performers, the harsh conditions they endured, performing 8 hours per day, with little money for salary, and sometimes sleeping in squalid living quarters, all which they had to endure for the love of Rock and Roll. &quot;We were like slaves&quot; he pointed out with a grin, concluding that he feels honored to have been privileged to contribute to this little piece of history. An extract of that guided tour can be viewed on YouTube.

On 29 February 2004, the German classical music group &quot;CHANTAL InstrumentalEnsemble&quot; produced a tribute concert for The Beatles, where they performed 15 instrumental Beatles songs along with an additional 11 played with Tony Sheridan as their Guest Star. One of the highlights of the night, was the Live performance of Sheridan&#x27;s song &quot;Tell Me If You Can&quot;, the only Live recording of the song, which he co-wrote with Paul McCartney during their time in Hamburg, more than 40 years prior. The full set of the songs played on that night are found on the DVD of the event, entitled &quot;CHANTAL meets Tony Sheridan - A Beatles Story&quot;. An abridged set of these songs was issued on CD (including all the tracks sung by Sheridan). All the songs played by Sheridan on that night can be viewed on YouTube. Michael Hofmann-von der Weiden, founder of the Ensemble CHANTAL commented that this unique event was &quot;A musical dream come true for me&quot;, as it represented &quot;an ascent not thought to be possible: CHANTAL toured and recorded with the Teacher of The Beatles, the full-blooded musician Tony Sheridan. (...) This CD (&amp; DVD) is the audible and visual proof of how romantic the ballad &quot;Why&quot; can still sound today, that the stomping &quot;Skinny Minnie&quot; is still a highlight in Sheridan&#x27;s song list, and how the traditional &quot;The Saints&quot; fairs in a vivid rock arrangement. (...) Sheridan and CHANTAL are a combination of a special category, and they disprove old prejudices (such as): &quot;Too old to rock and roll...&quot; &quot; - Günter Jertz 

In 2005 the Ensemble CHANTAL also produced with Tony Sheridan the first studio version of the song &quot;Tell Me If You Can&quot; recorded at Abbey Road Studios, which was issued as a CD-Single including an instrumental version.

In 2007 Sheridan went to the Opus 3 Studio in Sweden to record some songs, three of which he sang: &quot;Tell Me If You Can&quot;, &quot;Indochina&quot; (a song relating his experience when he performed for the US soldiers in Vietnam in the 1970s) and &quot;The Puzzle&quot;. They were issued as part of the album: &quot;Tony Sheridan and Opus 3 Artists&quot;, which was released posthumously in 2018. The remaining nine tracks were original songs recorded by Sheridan in his home by himself with only his guitar, to which additional post-production arrangements (musical and vocal) were added to the basic tracks by the &quot;Opus 3 Artists&quot;. The whole lineup of 12 songs of this album is available on YouTube

A biography of Sheridan, titled &quot;The Teacher&quot; (), was eventually published in 2013 by Norfolk author Alan Mann, a childhood-friend of Sheridan. The book was essentially an email question and answer interview. While repeated probings by the author did elicit the fact that Sheridan spent two weeks in an English jail, the author unfortunately took Sheridan&#x27;s memory of things at total face value.

In 2015, Colin &quot;Melander&quot; Crawley, Sheridan&#x27;s former bassist, published another biography, &quot;Tony Sheridan – The One The Beatles Called &quot;The Teacher&quot;&quot;(). Of the two published biographies, it gives the most insight into Sheridan&#x27;s major career of the early &#x27;60&#x27;s.

==&quot;The Teacher&quot;==
&quot;The Beatles and Tony Sheridan had a brief but intense working relationship. Before they rocked the world, the Beatles were a backing band in Hamburg for Tony Sheridan. A groundbreaking rocker and lead guitarist, Sheridan was a music mentor for the young group.&quot; 
- Radio producer Martin Duffy 

&quot;Yes, Tony Sheridan was a genuinely talented performer, and the fledgling Beatles were lucky to meet him and learn from him. He was charismatic, and could play a lead guitar that must have left George Harrison slack-jawed with envy.&quot; - Dan Wiencek

&quot;They were hooked on Tony – especially young George, who spent ages learning how to play the guitar with Tony and never forgot how much he helped him.&quot; - Martin Duffy

&quot;Tony Sheridan never got the credit he deserved. When it came to playing the guitar, he was the one [The Beatles] all looked up to. (...) Tony was no quiet man in the corner. He was a rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll wild cat who always did his own thing and went his own way. They said sharing a stage with him would either make or break a musician. It made The Beatles.&quot; - Derek James 

The Beatles affectionately called him &quot;The Teacher&quot;, because they learned from him so many crucial professional skills, namely from his sense of showmanship, his stage presence, his musical talent, and his musical arrangement skills.
One of Sheridan&#x27;s outstanding skills was for musical arrangements, which were evident especially in the early years of his career, by his turning into Rock&#x27;n Roll many old traditional songs like: &quot;My Bonnie&quot;, &quot;The Saints&quot;, &quot;Swanee River&quot;, &quot;You Are My Sunshine&quot; and jazz standards like &quot;Sweet Georgia Brown&quot;. 
But ironically, one of the greatest lessons which the Beatles learned from Tony&#x27;s life, was to reproduce the opposite of what they saw from his habits: Be disciplined in rehearsing their music relentlessly, always arrive fully prepared... and on time.

Ulf Krüger, the German producer of Sheridan&#x27;s album &quot;Vagabond&quot; (2002) wrote this: &quot;The leader of the amateur band with whom I played in the early 1960s, was a Sheridan fan. His working method (&quot;How would Tony Sheridan do it?&quot;) demanded that we busy ourselves with the arrangements until the band leader was satisfied that the result came close to the required &quot;TS&quot; (Tony Sheridan) style - then it was alright! Having become acquainted with the &quot;Top Ten&quot; and the &quot;Star-Club&quot;, I was shocked by both; and seeing Tony Sheridan at last on stage, I immediately knew why countless musicians unconditionally accepted him as the &quot;master&quot;: Tony was unique - and miles away of his time.&quot;

Gerry Marsden, lead singer of the band &quot;Gerry and the Pacemakers&quot;, said: &quot;He was a genius, a great guitar player. I used to watch Tony every night and he influenced me a great deal.&quot;

&quot;Tony was the Star in &quot;Star-Club&quot;, His Name will live forever.&quot; - Ted &quot;Kingsize&quot; Taylor

==Personal life==
Eventhough Tony Sheridan was extremely secretive about his personal life, in a 2010 radio documentary, he shared his painful childhood experience of his mother &quot;dumping&quot; him in a orphanage without a word, with no explanation:
&quot;My father disappeared by the time I came to my senses... My mother went to London to check on her relatives because of the [German] Blitz, and she came back pregnant. The effect it had on my life was that my father and mother broke up. He obviously said, &quot;How can you be pregnant? It wasn&#x27;t me!&quot; The end result was that I finished up in this children&#x27;s home, and I remember standing in this kid&#x27;s bed, holding onto the railings and shaking them, and seeing my mother disappear down the ward. I was screaming! In those five minutes, I lost my mother forever, definitely, definitely, definitely. Not just my mum, she was taking the love with her as well. So now I&#x27;m this horrible piece of nothing with these other horrible pieces of nothing.&quot;
Eventhough she came back to pick him up many months later, Tony explains that no matter how joyful it felt, &quot;the damage has been done. The damage, it&#x27;s there. The story of my life, basically, apart from the music (...), it&#x27;s been [about] the sort of relationships which haven&#x27;t worked, one way or another.

It is known that he was married three times, lastly to Anna Sievers, and previously to Rosi Heitmann and to Hazel Byng. 

His friend and former bassist Crawley stated that in 1960 Sheridan confided that despite his mixed Irish-Catholic and Jewish background, he was at that point viewing himself as a Buddhist. Later Sheridan became a devotee of the guru Bhagwan Sri Rajneesh and lived in the 1980s at the guru&#x27;s Rajneeshpuram commune in Oregon, United States.

In the later part of his life, Sheridan lived in Seestermühe, a village north of Hamburg, and in addition to music, he was interested in heraldry and designed coats of arms.

Sheridan’s musical legacy is carried on by his oldest son Tony Sheridan, Jr. who is himself a rockabilly guitarist/singer based near Orlando, Florida.

==Death==
Tony Sheridan died on 16 February 2013 in Hamburg, after undergoing heart surgery.

<text>Pierre-Jules Renard (; 22 February 1864 – 22 May 1910) was a French author and member of the Académie Goncourt, most famous for the works &quot;Poil de carotte&quot; (Carrot Top, 1894) and &quot;Les Histoires Naturelles&quot; (Nature Stories, 1896). Among his other works are &quot;Le Plaisir de rompre&quot; (The Pleasure of Breaking, 1898) and the posthumously published &quot;Huit Jours à la campagne&quot; (Eight Days in the Country, 1912).

==Early life==
The child of François Renard and Anna-Rose Colin, Renard was born in Châlons-du-Maine, Mayenne where his father was working on the construction of a railroad. Renard grew up in Chitry-les-Mines, (Nièvre). He had three older siblings, including Amélie (born 1858), who died at a young age. A second sister was also named Amélie (born 1859). A third child, Maurice, was born before Pierre-Jules in 1862. Renard&#x27;s childhood was characterized as difficult and sad (&quot;un grand silence roux&quot; or &quot;a great ruddy silence&quot;). Although he decided not to attend the prestigious École normale supérieure, love of literature would eventually dominate his life. From 1885 to 86, he served in the military in Bourges.

==Life and career==
On 28 April 1888, Renard married Marie Morneau. He and his wife lived at 43 rue du Rocher in the 8th Arrondissement of Paris. He began to frequent literary cafés and to contribute to Parisian newspapers. Among his steady friends were Alfred Capus and Lucien Guitry. Jules Renard wrote poems, short stories, short plays, novels and his famous &quot;Poil de carotte&quot;. He was elected mayor (&quot;maire&quot;) of Chitry les mines (58) on 15 May 1904 as the socialist candidate and became a member of the Académie Goncourt in 1907, thanks to Octave Mirbeau. He died of arteriosclerosis in Paris.

==Work==

Some of Jules Renard&#x27;s works take their inspiration from the countryside he loved in the Nièvre region. His character portraits are sharp, ironic and sometimes cruel (in his &quot;Histoires naturelles&quot; he humanizes animals and animalizes men) and he was an active supporter of pacifism and anticlericalism (apparent in &quot;La Bigote&quot;).

His &quot;Journal, 1887–1910&quot; (published in 1925) is a masterpiece of introspection, irony, humor and nostalgia, and provides an important glimpse into the literary life.

The English writer Somerset Maugham was influenced to publish his own well-known journals by the example of Renard. In the introduction to his own work &quot;A Writer&#x27;s Notebook&quot;, Maugham wrote an apt summary of the virtues of Renard&#x27;s journal: &quot;The journal is wonderfully good reading. It is extremely amusing. It is witty and subtle and often wise...Jules Renard jotted down neat retorts and clever phrases, epigrams, things seen, the sayings of people and the look of them, descriptions of scenery, effects of sunshine and shadow, everything, in short, that could be of use to him when he sat down to write for publication.&quot;

The American novelist Gilbert Sorrentino based his 1994 work &quot;Red the Fiend&quot; on Renard&#x27;s &quot;Poil de carotte&quot;. For a great part, the 2008 memoir &quot;Nothing to Be Frightened Of&quot; by the English novelist Julian Barnes is a homage to Jules Renard.

Renard is one of several popular philosophers whose quotations appear on the road signs of Project HIMANK in the Ladakh region of northern India. On one such sign in the Nubra Valley, he is quoted as saying, &quot;Laziness is nothing more than the habit of resting before you get tired&quot;.

<text>Chemainus is a community within the municipality of North Cowichan in the Chemainus Valley on the east coast of southern Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada.

Founded as an unincorporated logging town in 1858, Chemainus is now famous for its 53 outdoor murals. This outdoor gallery has given birth to many businesses, including a theatre, antiques dealers, and eateries. The tourist industry stemming from the murals helped rejuvenate the town after its large sawmill closed in the early 1980s and was replaced by a smaller, more efficient, mill.
The name &quot;Chemainus&quot; comes from the native shaman and prophet &quot;Tsa-meeun-is&quot; meaning &quot;broken chest&quot;. Legend says that the man survived a massive wound in his chest from an arrow in battle to become a powerful chief. His people took his name to identify their community, the Stz&#x27;uminus First Nation, formerly the Chemainus Indian Band.

The railway arrived in the 1880s and by the early 1920s the town&#x27;s population had ballooned to 600 persons. Chemainus was eventually designated a census populated area by Statistics Canada comprising the more built-up residential and commercial neighbourhoods. Its population had further grown to 3,035 residents by 2011. A larger more inclusive Chemainus area is customarily regarded as comprising part of the District of North Cowichan that lies north of the Chemainus River. This is the area covered by the Chemainus Advisory Committee set up as a consultation body by North Cowichan.

Chemainus Secondary School is located in the town, and serves as a secondary school for students living in Chemainus, Crofton, and Saltair.

A BC Ferry terminal is located in Chemainus, which provides service to Thetis Island and Penelakut Island (previously Kuper).

On 13 January 2006, a Boeing 737 aircraft was sunk off the coast in order to build an artificial reef. The sinking was documented in &quot;Sinking Wings&quot;, an episode of &quot;Mega Builders&quot;, a Discovery Channel series.

== Economic development post-Fordism ==

In the 1980s, British Columbia&#x27;s forest industry experienced a period of deep recession, largely caused by a substantial decrease in demand and price of B.C. forest products. This decrease came as a consequence of increases in global competition within forest product markets, the reduction in B.C. forest stocks, the placing of tariffs on B.C. forest imports to the United States, issues regarding aboriginal land claims and the increased public support for environmental groups.

Scholars view this recession more importantly as a representation of a larger structural shift from a Fordist economic production system underpinning many North American industries, toward one of Post-Fordism. Fordism is a system of production methods based on principles of specialized mass production technologies, aimed at capturing economies of scale. However, due to rising global competition, energy crises, stagflation and recession, Fordism began to unravel. Consequently, a new system of economic production, characterized by greater flexibility and the exploitation of economies of scope, known as Post-Fordism, began to emerge.

This transition placed a heavy burden on coastal single-industry forest communities like Chemainus due to rising unemployment. At Chemainus, Post-Fordist restructuring of B.C.&#x27;s Forest industry resulted in a large overhaul of the local sawmill owned by the Macmillan Bloedel company (a CPR subsidiary). Automated, state-of-the-art machinery was installed which allowed for greater flexibility in producing a larger range of products and greater ease in meeting varied market demands. This restructuring however led to a reduction in the amount workers necessary for its operation: a decrease from about 600 workers to 145 workers.

However, the declining forest industry in Chemainus has led to a drive to diversify the local economy. Chemainus has been successful in growing its tourist industry through the entrepreneurial activities of local citizens. Key projects include the revitalization of Chemainus&#x27; main street, through painting a series of large outdoor murals, as well as the construction of a shopping mall about a kilometer away.

Chemainus&#x27; geographical location, between Vancouver Island&#x27;s largest cities, Victoria and Nanaimo, as well as its proximity to ferry terminals and the coast island highway has also contributed to the successful growth of tourism in the community.

While tourism activities represent a new feature of Chemainus&#x27; economy, the forest industry is still the largest industry in the community. Chemainus&#x27; restructured sawmill is profitable, and newer developments such as Chemainus&#x27; industrial park have been completed, attracting a number of re-manufacturing firms including Plenks Wood Centre and Paulcan.

Despite Chemainus being heralded as a rare case of successful economic redevelopment within small resource communities, there are still some uncertainties facing its continued development into the future. Some note that the initial redevelopment projects in Chemainus such as the painting of large murals and other revitalization projects depended on funding from the government. This funding has largely disappeared and some have observed a reduction of opportunities for entrepreneurialism.

<doc id="1335645" wikidata="Q6984280" url="?curid=1335645" title="Neanderthal extinction">
<text>Neanderthals became extinct around 40,000 years ago. Hypotheses on the causes of the extinction include violence, transmission of diseases from modern humans which Neanderthals had no immunity to, competitive replacement, extinction by interbreeding with early modern human populations, natural catastrophes, climate change and inbreeding depression. It is likely that multiple factors caused the demise of an already low population.

==Possible coexistence before extinction==
In research published in &quot;Nature&quot; in 2014, an analysis of radiocarbon dates from forty Neanderthal sites from Spain to Russia found that the Neanderthals disappeared in Europe between 41,000 and 39,000 years ago with 95% probability. The study also found with the same probability that modern humans and Neanderthals overlapped in Europe for between 2,600 and 5,400 years. Modern humans reached Europe between 45,000 and 43,000 years ago. Improved radiocarbon dating published in 2015 indicates that Neanderthals disappeared around 40,000 years ago, which overturns older carbon dating which indicated that Neanderthals may have lived as recently as 24,000 years ago, including in refugia on the south coast of the Iberian peninsula such as Gorham&#x27;s Cave. 
Zilhão et al. (2017) argue for pushing this date forward by some 3,000 years, to 37,000 years ago.
Inter-stratification of Neanderthal and modern human remains has been suggested, but is disputed. Stone tools that have been proposed to be linked to Neanderthals have been found at Byzovya (:ru:Бызовая) in the polar Urals, and dated to 31,000 to 34,000 years ago, but is also disputed. At Mandrin Cave the French palaeolontologist and colleagues developed a new method of analysing soot from fires. They were able to distinguish between fires made by Neanderthals and modern humans based on the differing food residues in the soot as a result of their different diets. The researchers found that the last layer of soot from Neanderthal fires was a year or less before the first made by modern humans, and in Slimak&#x27;s view this shows that the two species met and supports the hypothesis that the Neanderthals disappeared due to competitive replacement. 

==Possible causes of extinction==
===Violence===
Kwang Hyun Ko discusses the possibility that Neanderthal extinction was either precipitated or hastened by violent conflict with &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;. Violence in early hunter-gatherer societies usually occurred as a result of resource competition following natural disasters. It is therefore plausible to suggest that violence, including primitive warfare, would have transpired between the two human species. The hypothesis that early humans violently replaced Neanderthals was first proposed by French paleontologist Marcellin Boule (the first person to publish an analysis of a Neanderthal) in 1912.

===Parasites and pathogens===
Infectious diseases carried by &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; may have passed to Neanderthals, who would have had poor protection to infections they had not previously been exposed to, leading to devastating consequences for Neanderthal populations. &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; were less vulnerable to Neanderthal diseases, partly because they had evolved to cope with the far higher disease load of the tropics and so were more able to cope with novel pathogens, and partly because the higher numbers of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; meant that even devastating outbreaks would still have left enough survivors for a viable population. If viruses could easily jump between these two similar species, possibly because they lived near together, &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; might have infected Neanderthals and prevented the epidemic from burning out as Neanderthal numbers declined. The same process may also explain &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;&#x27; resilience to Neanderthal diseases and parasites. Novel human diseases likely moved from Africa into Eurasia. This purported &quot;African advantage&quot; remained until the agricultural revolution 10,000 years ago in Eurasia, after which domesticated animals surpassed other primates as the most prevalent source of new human infections, replacing the &quot;African advantage&quot; with a &quot;Eurasian advantage&quot;. The catastrophic impact of Eurasian viruses on Native American populations in the historical past offers a sense of how modern humans may have affected hominin predecessor groups in Eurasia 40,000 years ago. Human and Neanderthal genomes and disease or parasite adaptations may give insight on this.

Infectious illness interactions may express the prolonged period of stagnation before the modification, as per disease ecology. Mathematical models have been used to make forecasts for future investigations, giving information about inter-species interactions during the shift between the Middle and Upper Paleolithic eras. This can be useful given the sparse material record from this time and the potential of DNA sequencing and dating technology. Such modeling, together with modern technology and prehistoric archaeological methodologies, may provide a fresh understanding of this time in human origins.

===Competitive replacement===
==== Species specific disadvantages ====

Slight competitive advantage on the part of modern humans may have accounted for Neanderthals&#x27; decline on a timescale of thousands of years.

Generally small and widely dispersed fossil sites suggest that Neanderthals lived in less numerous and socially more isolated groups than contemporary &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;. Tools such as Mousterian flint stone flakes and Levallois points are remarkably sophisticated from the outset, yet they have a slow rate of variability and general technological inertia is noticeable during the entire fossil period. Artifacts are of utilitarian nature, and symbolic behavioral traits are undocumented before the arrival of modern humans in Europe around 40,000 to 35,000 years ago.

The noticeable morphological differences in skull shape between the two human species also have cognitive implications. These include the Neanderthals&#x27; smaller parietal lobes and cerebellum, areas implicated in tool use, visuospatial integration, numeracy, creativity, and higher-order conceptualization. The differences, while slight, would have possibly been enough to affect natural selection and may underlie and explain the differences in social behaviors, technological innovation, and artistic output.

Jared Diamond, a supporter of competitive replacement, points out in his book &quot;The Third Chimpanzee&quot; that the replacement of Neanderthals by modern humans is comparable to patterns of behavior that occur whenever people with advanced technology clash with people with less developed technology.

====Division of labour====
In 2006, it was posited that Neanderthal division of labour between the sexes was less developed than Middle Paleolithic &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;. Both male and female Neanderthals participated in the single occupation of hunting big game, such as bison, deer, gazelles, and wild horses. This hypothesis proposes that the Neanderthal&#x27;s relative lack of labour division resulted in less efficient extraction of resources from the environment as compared to &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;.

====Anatomical differences and running ability====
Researchers such as Karen L. Steudel of the University of Wisconsin have highlighted the relationship of Neanderthal anatomy (shorter and stockier than that of modern humans) and the ability to run and the requirement of energy (30% more).

Nevertheless, in the recent study, researchers Martin Hora and Vladimir Sladek of Charles University in Prague show that Neanderthal lower limb configuration, particularly the combination of robust knees, long heels, and short lower limbs, increased the effective mechanical advantage of the Neanderthal knee and ankle extensors, thus reducing the force needed and the energy spent for locomotion significantly. The walking cost of the Neanderthal male is now estimated to be 8–12% higher than that of anatomically modern males, whereas the walking cost of the Neanderthal female is considered to be virtually equal to that of anatomically modern females.

Other researchers, like Yoel Rak, from Tel-Aviv University in Israel, have noted that the fossil records show that Neanderthal pelvises in comparison to modern human pelvises would have made it much harder for Neanderthals to absorb shocks and to bounce off from one step to the next, giving modern humans another advantage over Neanderthals in running and walking ability. However, Rak also notes that all archaic humans had wide pelvises, indicating that this is the ancestral morphology and that modern humans underwent a shift towards narrower pelvises in the late Pleistocene.

====Modern humans and alliance with dogs ====
Pat Shipman argues that the domestication of the dog gave modern humans an advantage when hunting. Evidence shows the oldest remains of domesticated dogs were found in Belgium (31,700 BP) and in Siberia (33,000 BP). A survey of early sites of modern humans and Neanderthals with faunal remains across Spain, Portugal and France provided an overview of what modern humans and Neanderthals ate. Rabbit became more frequent, while large mammals – mainly eaten by the Neanderthals – became increasingly rare. In 2013, DNA testing on the &quot;Altai dog&quot;, a paleolithic dog&#x27;s remains from the Razboinichya Cave (Altai Mountains), has linked this 33,000-year-old dog with the present lineage of &quot;Canis familiaris&quot;.

===Interbreeding===
At the time of the last Neanderthals, approximately 45 to 40 thousand years ago, genetic analysis suggests that there was a gene flow from Neanderthals to modern humans of around 10%, but almost no flow from modern humans to Neanderthals. This may be an artifact due to the small number of late Neanderthal genomes, or because hybrids were not viable in Neanderthal groups, or because fertile Neanderthals were being absorbed into modern human groups but not vice versa. If the effect was real over an extended period, it would have increased the size of the modern human gene pool and reduced that of the already sparse Neanderthals, contributing to reduce their numbers below a viable population and thus to their extinction.

===Inbreeding===
According to a study by Rios et al, kinship patterns among recovered Neanderthal remains suggests that there was inbreeding, such as pairings between half-siblings and/or uncle/aunt and niece/nephew. Researchers hypothesize that Neanderthals may have become isolated into small groups during harsh climatic conditions, which contributed to inbreeding behaviours. Due to the lack of genetic diversity, Neanderthal populations would have become more vulnerable to climatic changes, diseases, and other stressors, which may have contributed to their extinction. A similar model to the inbreeding hypothesis can be seen among endangered lowland gorillas. Their populations are so small that it has caused inbreeding, making them even more vulnerable to extinction.

===Climate change===

Neanderthals went through a demographic crisis in Western Europe that seems to coincide with climate change that resulted in a period of extreme cold in Western Europe. &quot;The fact that Neanderthals in Western Europe were nearly extinct, but then recovered long before they came into contact with modern humans came as a complete surprise to us,&quot; said Love Dalén, associate professor at the Swedish Museum of Natural History in Stockholm. If so, this would indicate that Neanderthals may have been very sensitive to climate change.

The data reveal that sudden climatic change, although crucial locally, had a limited effect on the worldwide Neanderthal population. Interbreeding and assimilation, which were hypothesized as causes in the death of European Neanderthal populations, are successful only for low levels of food competition. Future research will examine models of interbreeding, and hybridization may be evaluated using genomic records from the last ice age (Fu et al., 2016).

====Natural catastrophe====
A number of researchers have argued that the Campanian Ignimbrite Eruption, a volcanic eruption near Naples, Italy, about 39,280 ± 110 years ago (older estimate ~37,000 years), erupting about of magma ( bulk volume) contributed to the extinction of Neanderthals. The argument has been developed by Golovanova et al. The hypothesis posits that although Neanderthals had encountered several Interglacials during 250,000 years in Europe, inability to adapt their hunting methods caused their extinction facing &quot;H. sapiens&quot; competition when Europe changed into a sparsely vegetated steppe and semi-desert during the last Ice Age. Studies of sediment layers at Mezmaiskaya Cave suggest a severe reduction of plant pollen. The damage to plant life would have led to a corresponding decline in plant-eating mammals hunted by the Neanderthals.

<doc id="1335652" wikidata="Q5243823" url="?curid=1335652" title="De-policing">
<text>De-policing is a term for police disengaging from active police work, generally as a reaction to external scrutiny or negative publicity. A form of work slowdown, de-policing represents a de facto police strike, in which the police withdraw an aspect of their crime prevention services. It is a practical police protest at perceived political interference in their day-to-day task of policing.

Conservative author Heather Mac Donald offered another interpretation for the term &quot;de-policing&quot;. In her book &quot;The War on Cops&quot;, she used the term as the antithesis for pro-active policing in general. In the light of the 2014 killing of Eric Garner in Staten Island, New York and criticism of &quot;broken windows&quot; policing, MacDonald used the term &quot;de-policing&quot; to describe the NYPD&#x27;s policy of backing away from actively pursuing stop-and-frisk procedures as a primary method of crime prevention.

According to a 2019 study, there is no evidence that de-policing contributes to city homicide rates. A 2017 FBI study suggested that law enforcement felt a &quot;chill wind&quot; after several high-profile police killings in recent years—especially the 2014 shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. The study noted the stance of politicians, the media, and the broader social movement making people feel that it was acceptable &quot;to challenge and discredit law enforcement actions&quot;; and proposed that these circumstances have demoralized police officers and led them to do less on the job. In a 2017 survey by Pew Research Center, 86% of police officers said they believed that police killings of African Americans had made policing more difficult.

Recent court decisions like &quot;Ligon&quot; and &quot;Floyd&quot; have also contributed to the atmosphere of de-policing in many American cities, but particularly New York City. Cities like Ferguson, Missouri and Baltimore, Maryland have been similarly affected due to what is perceived as unfair and aggressive policing in minority communities.

<text>Ricardo &quot;Richie&quot; Ray (born February 15, 1945) is a Nuyorican (a New York-born Puerto Rican) virtuoso pianist, singer, music arranger, composer and religious minister known for his success beginning in 1965 as part of the duo Richie Ray &amp; Bobby Cruz. He is known as &quot;El Embajador del Piano&quot; (The Ambassador of the Piano).

==Early life==
Ray (birth name: Richard Maldonado Morales ) was born in Brooklyn, New York City of Puerto Rican parents. They lived on Hoyt Street. Ray&#x27;s father, Pacifico Maldonado, was an accomplished guitarist in his native Bayamón, and as such was the Maldonado family&#x27;s early musical influence.

Ray&#x27;s parents had him take piano lessons when he was seven years old. His life-long partnership with Robert &quot;Bobby&quot; Cruz Feliciano started five years later in 1957 when Ray played bass in a group led by Cruz. This combination was the beginning of one of the greatest salsa duos in the salsa music industry.

He attended the Brooklyn Conservatory of Music, the famed High School of Performing Arts, and the Juilliard School of Music. These experiences served to further develop and refine his musical training. In addition, he became well-versed in various Latin music genres which were popular at that time – the Guajira, the Cha-cha-cha, the Bolero and others.

==Musical career==
Ray left Juilliard in 1963, after just one year. He made this choice so that he could get organized and dedicate himself to his own band. This was a year after Cruz joined in as the lead vocalist. In 1965, he signed with Fonseca Records and released his debut album, Ricardo Ray Arrives-Comején. The album included the outstanding hit songs &quot;Mambo Jazz&quot;, &quot;Comején&quot;, &quot;Viva Richie Ray&quot;, &quot;El Mulato&quot;, &quot;Suavito&quot;, &quot;Pa&#x27; Chismoso Tú&quot; and the bolero-cha &quot;Si Te Contaran&quot;. The famous pair recorded some of their finest work during the period that they were with the Fonseca label.

In 1966, the group switched to the Alegre label, coinciding with the arrival of the boogaloo. Ray recorded nine albums with Alegre. He was a part of Tico/Alegre Records until 1970, and during that time he produce such hits as &quot;Richie&#x27;s Jala Jala&quot;, &quot;Mr. Trumpet Man&quot;, &quot;Señor Embajador&quot;, &quot;Agúzate&quot; (Gold Record Award winner), &quot;Amparo Arrebato&quot;, &quot;Traigo de Todo&quot;, and the Spanish version of Claude François &#x27;s &quot;Comme d&#x27;habitude&quot;, called &quot;A Mi Manera&quot; in reference to Frank Sinatra&#x27;s version &quot;My Way&quot;. This song went on to be the most radio played Spanish version of &quot;comme d&#x27;habitude&quot; (and so of &quot;My Way&quot;) during 1970; the song also won the duo a Gold Record Award.

While with Alegre, Ray also recorded two albums for UA Latino. These included &quot;Viva Ricardo&quot; and &quot;El Diferente&quot; (Gold Record Award winner). The band scored a number one hit with the song &quot;Colorín Colorado&quot;, while &quot;El Diferente&quot;, &quot;Feria En Manizales&quot; and &quot;Ay, Compay!&quot;, became number one hits in Latin America.

In 1968, Ray and Cruz had been together professionally for five years, had written most of their songs together, and for the first time in the album Los Durísimos, they shared equal billing in an album cover. This album had such hits as &quot;Agallú&quot;, &quot;Pancho Cristal&quot;, &quot;Adasa&quot;, and &quot;Yo Soy (Babalú)&quot;. Since then the band became officially known as Richie Ray and Bobby Cruz.

===The 1970s===

In 1970, Ray and Cruz left New York and moved to San Juan, Puerto Rico, for professional and personal reasons. They opened a nightclub, but managing it required too much of their time. Shortly after, they decided to sell the establishment to focus on their artistic commitments. That same year, Ray and Cruz signed with the new Vaya Records label, a subsidiary of Fania Records.

In 1971, they released &quot;El Bestial Sonido de Ricardo Ray y Bobby Cruz&quot;, the first ever release on Vaya Records, and was one of their better albums on that label. The album went gold, and it took them to the top of the charts once again. It included hits such as Joan Manuel Serrat&#x27;s &quot;Señora&quot;, the bolero version of the Gardel/Lepera tango &quot;Volver&quot;, and the Rubén Blades composition &quot;Guaguancó Triste&quot;, as well as the salsa version of James Taylor&#x27;s &quot;Fire And Rain&quot;. This album also included his most impressive and well-known hit called &quot;Sonido Bestial&quot;, which has a Latin-flavoured arrangement of Chopin&#x27;s Etude Opus 10/No. 12, and is considered a classic masterpiece of salsa music.

In 1974 The Dynamic Duo won the title &quot;The Kings Of Salsa&quot; at the &quot;Coliseo Roberto Clemente&quot; in San Juan, Puerto Rico. For a period of 12 hours, 24 bands had competed for the coveted title, and Ray and Cruz emerged triumphant. Contracts started to pour in, requests for interviews and TV appearances, and even movie offers.

==Born-again Christian==
All of these things spoke of success, but Ray suffered strong emotional problems during this time. The despair he felt led him into alcohol and drug abuse. He felt tormented by his addictions, however, and wanted to change his life.

In August of that year, he surprised many when he announced that he had become a born-again evangelical Christian. The professed experience radically changed his career and life. At first, Cruz refused to accept Ray&#x27;s change, but within two months Cruz himself became a convert.

In spite of these dramatic changes, Ray &amp; Cruz fans continued to support the duo. The 1976 release of Reconstrucción went &quot;Gold&quot; (their ninth). The album included their smash hit single &quot;Juan En La Ciudad&quot;. They followed with Viven in 1977, De Nuevo &#x27;Los Durísimos&#x27; Again (1980), and their final release on Vaya Records, Los Inconfundibles (1987), in which Ray and Cruz announced their retirement from Salsa music. All of these were successful releases.

Richie Ray and Bobby Cruz lost most of their fans and found opposition among the members of their own faith when they suggested the idea of Christian salsa. They stood their ground, however, and little by little, they started to regain the confidence of their fans and fellow Christians. They abandoned secular salsa and recorded salsa with a Christian message, reworking many of their worldly hits into religious themes. Some of these include &quot;El Sonido La Bestia&quot;, &quot;Más Que Vencedores&quot;, and &quot;Aguzate&quot;. They also created some new ones, like &quot;Los Fariseos&quot;, &quot;Timoteo&quot;, and &quot;Sipriano&quot;

The sincerity of their Christian beliefs was not just conveyed in their music. Both Ray and Cruz are pastors, and they have founded more than 70 churches throughout Puerto Rico and the United States. In addition, Ray founded the Salvation Records label as an outlet for Christian music. Then, he continued his music career although his long-time friend, Cruz, had retired. During &quot;retirement&quot;, however, both Cruz and Ray released albums with previously recorded numbers and with other bands or singers. Richie Ray is now a pastor in Miami under Spring of Life Fellowship.

In 1991, Ray and Cruz reunited for successful concert appearances in San Juan, and again in New York. They reunited again in 1999 for the &quot;Sonido Bestial VIP&quot; concert in the Coliseo Rubén Rodríguez located in Bayamón. The duo sang some of their early hits together along with some of their religious songs, and the concert was recorded live. The outcome was so impressive that they were offered a contract by Universal Records. The recording was selected as one of the best recordings of 1999, and helped bring the pair back into the limelight of the Puerto Rican music scene. The pair has continued to be active in the music scene since.

==Later years==
In 2000, Ray and Cruz held a series of concerts that were completely sold out at the Antonio Paoli Hall of the Luis A. Ferré Performing Arts Center in San Juan. They were also honored with a National Day of Salsa in Bayamón. In 2002, Richie Ray and Bobby Cruz were inducted into the International Latin Music Hall of Fame.

In 2003, Ray recorded &quot;Al Ritmo del Piano&quot; for Warner Music Latina. Ray and Cruz continue to make appearances in places such as the Copacabana Club in New York. In December 2005, Ray &amp; Cruz released a totally new album under the label &quot;Tropisounds&quot;. The album was recorded in Colombia under the musical direction of its producer Diego Galé. &quot;Que Vuelva La Música&quot; has 14 new tracks – &quot;El gallo y La Vaca&quot;, &quot;La Bailarina&quot;, &quot;Quim Bon Bori&quot;, &quot;Vive Contento&quot;, &quot;Soy Boricua&quot; and &quot;Va a Llover&quot; among others, are just a few of the titles. The album was an instant hit in Colombia and Latin America. &quot;El gallo y la vaca&quot; (Nov. 25) and &quot;Salsa La Celebracion&quot; (April 7) appeared in the top 100 salsa songs charts in North America through 2006. In 2006, Richie Ray and Bobby Cruz won a Latin-Grammy Award for &quot;Lifetime Achievement&quot;. That year, they also recorded a CD and DVD titled &quot;A lifetime of hits&quot; (live at Centro de Bellas Artes, San Juan, Puerto Rico) which was nominated for a Latin Grammy in the &quot;Best Contemporary Tropical Album&quot; category.

Ray currently lives in Florida with his wife Angie Ray and besides being musically active, he is also busy attending the churches which he and Cruz founded in the United States, Caribbean and Latin-America. Ray is still considered along with Eddie Palmieri and Papo Lucca as one of the best and most influential pianists of all time in Salsa music. On August 16, 2008, Richie Ray &amp; Bobby Cruz celebrated 45 years in the musical business, with a concert at José Miguel Agrelot Coliseum. Prior to the presentation, the duo noted that the concert would last at least three hours. The duo also expressed that it might be their last &quot;big scale concert&quot;.

<text>CA Anti-Spyware is a spyware detection program distributed by CA, Inc. Until 2007, it was known as PestPatrol.

This product is now offered by Total Defense, Inc. and has been named Total Defense Anti-Virus.

==History==
PestPatrol, Inc. was a Carlisle, PA based software company founded by Dr. David Stang and Robert Bales, which developed PestPatrol and released its first version in 2000. Originally called SaferSite, the company changed its name in 2002 to better reflect the focus of the company.

PestPatrol was an anti-malware product, designed to protect a computer system against threats such as adware, spyware and viruses. It performed automated scans of a system&#x27;s hard disks, Windows registry and other crucial system areas, and enabled manual scans for specific threats, selected from a very long list of known malicious software. Among its unique features were CookiePatrol, which purges spyware cookies, and KeyPatrol, which detects keyloggers. Unlike most anti-spyware programs designed for home use on a single desktop, PestPatrol also provided a solution for the network environments found in enterprises. Among the features that made it appealing for enterprise security administrators was the ability to manage networked desktops remotely.

Early versions of the product were criticized for the poor user interface, described alternatively as something that &quot;looks like an application that was ported from OS/2, with unclear buttons&quot; or a &quot;clunky, text-based UI&quot;, but the reviewers praised its malware detection and removal capabilities, stating &quot;PestPatrol is the most effective anti-spyware system - short of a switch to Linux - that we&#x27;ve ever used&quot;.

It was described by InfoWorld as &quot;one of the most established brands in anti-spyware&quot;, and in 2002, it was selected as &quot;Security product of year&quot; by Network World, which cited its ability to detect and remove more than 60,000 types of malware, and its defenses against Remote Administration Tools (RATs).

Billing itself as the &quot;Authority in Spyware Protection,&quot; it licensed its signature files for use in Yahoo! Companion and others. In 2003, along with other anti-spyware and anti-malware companies such as Webroot, Lavasoft and Aluria, it formed an industry consortium to fight malware called the Consortium of Antispyware Technology (COAST).

Computer Associates (now CA Technologies) bought PestPatrol in 2004 and made it a part of its computer security line, which includes a virus scanner and a firewall. Using the newly acquired technology, CA created a bundle named CA Integrated Threat Management (ITM), which consisted of an anti-virus solution and the PestPatrol anti-spyware.

Renamed CA Anti-Spyware in 2007, the program can be bought separately, or as part of CA Internet Security.

In 2007, the CA Anti-Spyware team was instrumental in exposing the fact that Facebook was collecting personal information about their users, without their knowledge, even when those users opted out of Facebook&#x27;s ill-fated Beacon program, and even when those users were not logged into Facebook.

<text>&quot;The Adventure of the Yellow Face&quot;, one of the 56 short Sherlock Holmes stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is the third tale from &quot;The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. It was first published in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in the United Kingdom in February 1893, and in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; in the United States on 11 February 1893.

One of Doyle&#x27;s sentimental pieces, the story is remarkable in that Holmes&#x27; deduction during the course of it proves incorrect. According to Dr. Watson:
...where he failed it happened too often that no one else succeeded... Now and again, however, it chanced that even when he erred the truth was still discovered.

==Plot==

Sherlock Holmes, bored due to a want of cases, returns home from a walk with Dr. Watson early in spring to find he has missed a visitor but that the caller has left his pipe behind. From it, Holmes deduces that he was disturbed of mind (because he forgot the pipe); that he valued it highly (because he had repaired it with silver bands which cost more than the pipe cost, rather than replacing it, when it was broken); that he was muscular, left-handed, had excellent teeth, was careless in his habits and was not needed to practice economy.

None of these deductions are particularly germane to the story: they are merely Holmesian logical exercises. When the visitor, Mr. Grant Munro (whose name Holmes observed from his hatband) returns, Holmes and Watson hear the story of Munro&#x27;s deception by his wife Effie. She had been previously married in America, but her husband and child had died of yellow fever, whereupon she returned to England and met and married Munro. Their marriage had been blissful until Effie asked for a hundred pounds and begged him not to ask why. Two months later, Effie Munro was caught conducting secret liaisons with the occupants of a cottage near the Munro house in Norbury. Grant Munro has seen a mysterious yellow-faced person in this cottage. Overcome with jealousy, he breaks in and finds the place empty. However, the room where he saw the mysterious figure is very comfortable and well furnished, with a portrait of his wife on the mantelpiece.

Holmes, after sending Munro home with instructions to wire for him if the cottage was reoccupied, confides in Watson his belief that the mysterious figure is Effie Munro&#x27;s first husband. He postulates that the husband, having been left in America, has come to England to blackmail her.

After Munro summons Holmes and Watson, the three enter the cottage, brushing aside the entreaties of Effie Munro. They find the strange yellow-faced character, and Holmes peels the face away, showing it to be a mask, and revealing a young girl who is half-black. It is then revealed that Effie Munro&#x27;s first husband was John Hebron, an African-American lawyer, who did die in America, but their daughter, Lucy, survived. At the time Effie came to England, she could not bring Lucy with her, as the child was still ill enough that the transition might have exacerbated her state. But later, after she and Grant were married, Effie got word that Lucy was alive and well. Upon hearing of this, Effie became overcome with desire to see her child again, so she asked for the hundred pounds and used it to bring Lucy and her nurse to England, and installed them in the cottage near the Munro house. She feared, however, that Grant might stop loving her if he found out that she was the mother of a mixed race child, so all the while, she had made every endeavour to keep Lucy&#x27;s existence a secret.

Both Watson and Holmes are touched by Munro&#x27;s response. Watson observes:
...when [Munro&#x27;s] answer came it was one of which I love to think. He lifted the little child, kissed her, and then, still carrying her, he held his other hand out to his wife and turned towards the door. &quot;We can talk about it more comfortably at home,&quot; said he. &quot;I am not a very good man, Effie, but I think I am a better one than you have given me credit for being.&quot;

Holmes excuses himself and Watson, and, that evening, after they have returned to Baker Street, says:
Watson, if it should ever strike you that I am getting a little overconfident in my powers, or giving less pains to a case than it deserves, kindly whisper &#x27;Norbury&#x27; in my ear, and I shall be infinitely obliged to you.

== Treatment of race ==

Doyle&#x27;s sympathetic treatment of interracial marriage, between an Englishwoman and a black lawyer in Atlanta, Georgia, appears extraordinarily liberal for the 1890s. Though the story has the widow treating her dead husband&#x27;s race as a secret whose revelation might entail negative reactions, the marriage is not illegal in Britain, and her second husband&#x27;s loving response is reported approvingly by Watson. This story, however, should be set alongside Doyle&#x27;s stereotyped caricature of a thuggish black boxer, in &quot;The Adventure of the Three Gables&quot; (1926).

== Publication history ==
&quot;The Adventure of the Yellow Face&quot; was published in the UK in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in February 1893, and in the US in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; on 11 February 1893. It was also published in the US edition of &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in March 1893. The story was published with seven illustrations by Sidney Paget in the &quot;Strand&quot;, and with two illustrations by W. H. Hyde in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot;. It was included in the short story collection &quot;The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, which was published in December 1893 in the UK and February 1894 in the US.

==Adaptations==
===Film and television===
The story was adapted as a short film released in 1921 as part of the Stoll film series, featuring Eille Norwood as Holmes.

The story is also alluded to in the BBC television series &quot;Sherlock&quot; where a yellow smiley face is painted on the wall of Sherlock&#x27;s flat. Additionally, quotes from the story are used as plot points in &quot;The Lying Detective&quot;. In addition, the town of Norbury from the story is represented in the episode &quot;The Six Thatchers&quot; in the form of Vivian Norbury, the main adversary of the episode.

===Radio===
Edith Meiser adapted the story as an episode of the American radio series &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; that was broadcast on 14 January 1932, with Richard Gordon as Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Watson.

&quot;The Yellow Face&quot; was dramatised by Gerry Jones for BBC Radio 4 in 1992 as an episode of the 1989–1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson. It featured Helena Breck as Effie Munro.

The story was adapted for radio in 2005 as part of &quot;The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, a series on the American radio show &quot;Imagination Theatre&quot;, with John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson. It was the first episode in the series.

<text>John Ruggles (October 8, 1789June 20, 1874) was an American politician from the U.S. state of Maine. He served in several important state legislative and judicial positions before serving in the U.S. Senate.

==Early life and career==

Ruggles was born in Westborough, Massachusetts. He attended public school there and in 1813 graduated from Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. Ruggles studied law, and after being admitted to the bar in 1815 he began practicing in Skowhegan, Maine. Two years later, Ruggles moved to Thomaston. In 1823, Ruggles was elected to the Maine House of Representatives. He served in the House until 1831, and was speaker (1825–1829 and again in 1831). He resigned from the state house to replace Samuel E. Smith (who had been elected governor) as a justice of the supreme judicial court of Maine, serving until 1834.

He also made the first US patent. The patent was for new traction wheels for trains for going uphill with heavy loads.

==U.S. Senate career==

The state legislature elected Ruggles as a Democratic-Republican (Jacksonian) to the U.S. Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Peleg Sprague. He was later elected for the full term beginning March 4, 1835, and in total served from January 20, 1835, to March 3, 1841. He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1840.

During his tenure in Congress, Ruggles had served as chairman of the Committee on Patents and Patent Office (25th Congress), and in 1836 framed the bill for the reorganization of the United States Patent Office. He was known for his interest in inventions and patents, and because of his legislative accomplishments in this area he has become known as the &quot;Father of the U.S. Patent Office&quot;. Ruggles also was an inventor and the patent-holder of , issued July 13, 1836. His invention was a type of train wheel designed to reduce the adverse effects of the weather on the track. This was not the first patent ever from the USPTO; the previous patents were destroyed by fire and afterwards called the X-Patents, and new patents afterwards were numbered from 1 again. Ruggles received the first patent granted under the new system; Samuel Hopkins received the first X-Patent.

Ruggles, a conservative Democrat, opposed the Loco-Foco influence in the Van Buren administration. In 1840, he penned a letter going against his party to endorse William Henry Harrison, whom he described as a man of &quot;enlightened patriotism, great practical wisdom, and sound Republican principles,&quot; while denouncing Van Buren&#x27;s policies as &quot;ruinous to the enterprise and business of the people.&quot;

==Retirement and death==

In retirement, Ruggles resumed the practice of law in Thomaston. There he made several more inventions and was well known as a political writer and orator. Ruggles was wealthy; he and his wife Margaret George Ruggles had children and lived in the largest house on the town&#x27;s Main Street. He died in 1874 a few months before reaching age 85. He is interred in the Elm Grove Cemetery.

<text>Seaxburh (; died c. 674) was a queen of Wessex. She is also called Queen of the Gewisse, an early name for the tribe which ruled Wessex. She is said to have ruled Wessex for between one and two years after the death of her husband, Cenwalh, in 672. Her accession to the throne is documented in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle for that year which states that &quot;This year king Kenwalk died, and Sexburga his queen reigned one year after him&quot;. It was extremely rare for a woman to reign &quot;suo jure&quot; in Anglo-Saxon England, and she was the only woman to appear in a regnal list. She may have reigned for over a year, as the next reign is entered in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; in 674.

However, Bede said that after the death of Cenwalh, &quot;sub-kings took upon themselves the government of the kingdom&quot;, so the chroniclers may have tidied up a complicated situation. Writing decades after Cenwalh&#x27;s life, when Bede lists Cenwalh&#x27;s accession, he mentions Seaxburh as the unnamed second wife whom the king married after he had cast away his first wife, who was the sister of the Mercian king Penda. It has been suggested that Bede deliberately omitted mention of Seaxburh because he viewed her marriage to Cenwalh, and therefore her right to the throne, as illegitimate.

Seaxburh was succeeded in about 674 by Æscwine, a descendant of Cenwalh&#x27;s great-uncle Ceolwulf of Wessex.

<text>Tom Clancy&#x27;s Ghost Recon is a series of military tactical shooter video games published by Ubisoft. In the series, the player is in charge of a fictional, newly conceived squad of U.S. Army Special Forces soldiers from Delta Company, 1st Battalion, 5th Special Forces Group (5th SFG) stationed at Fort Bragg. Except for the &quot;1st Battalion, 5th SFG&quot; designation, this reconnaissance unit is entirely fictional, as Special Forces Battalions currently only support three Companies (A, B and C). They are often referred to as &quot;the Ghosts&quot;. Their role is like other real world special operations forces, in that their operations are kept highly classified. In &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Ghost Recon: Future Soldier&quot;, it is shown that the Ghost&#x27;s unit has multiple designations and is part of JSOC; they are also known as the Group for Specialized Tactics (or GST—where the term &quot;Ghost&quot; comes from), much like real JSOC units such as Delta Force (1st SFOD-D or CAG) and SEAL Team Six (or DEVGRU). &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Ghost Recon&quot; has also been novelized by Grant Blackwood under the pseudonym David Michaels.

===&quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Ghost Recon&quot; (2001)===

&quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Ghost Recon&quot; begins in April 2008, with civil unrest taking place in Russia. Ultra-nationalists have seized power with plans to rebuild the Soviet Union. Their first step is clandestine support of rebel forces in Georgia and the Baltic states. Alarmed by the threat, the U.S. deploys the Ghosts into Georgia to stop the Russians. Over the course of the campaign, the Ghosts take the fight to the ultra-nationalists, with a final showdown in Moscow&#x27;s Red Square.

====&quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Ghost Recon: Desert Siege&quot; (2002)====

Set in 2009, after the first game, &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Desert Siege&quot; features a new campaign in East Africa, where the Ghosts have been deployed to stop Ethiopian army Colonel Tesfaye Wolde&#x27;s plans to invade Eritrea. He executes his plan through arms sales with the same Russian ultra-nationalists who launched the coup the previous year.

The second expansion set to &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Ghost Recon&quot;, &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Ghost Recon: Island Thunder&quot; takes place in Cuba in 2010. Its plot revolves around Cuba&#x27;s first democratic elections since the 1950s, but an anti-American faction named the FDP (&quot;El Frente Democratico del Pueblo&quot; or People&#x27;s Democratic Front), secretly terrorizes election outlets during the campaign while fielding their own presidential candidate. The Ghosts, who are sent to ensure order during the elections, discover that the FDP is a shell organization run by a Colombian drug cartel that needs the island as a transit point to the United States.

====&quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Ghost Recon: Jungle Storm&quot; (2004)====

Taking place in Bogotá, Colombia just after the events of &quot;Island Thunder&quot;, the drug cartel that had aided and financed the FDP in their efforts in Cuba has initiated a number of terrorist attacks against the Colombian government, who have allied themselves with the United States.

Walsh. They depict a new Korean War brought about by a renegade Korean People&#x27;s Army general, Jung Chong-sun, who launches a coup against the North Korean government. The Xbox version is the direct sequel of the two games, in which Jung plots revenge against NATO and South Korea.

<doc id="1335689" wikidata="Q1474245" url="?curid=1335689" title="Conga line">
<text>The conga line is a novelty line dance that was derived from the Cuban carnival dance of the same name and became popular in the US in the 1930s and 1950s. In order to perform the dance, dancers form a long, processing line, which would usually turn into a circle. It has three shuffle steps on the beat, followed by a kick that is slightly ahead of the fourth beat. The conga, a term sometimes mistakenly believed to be derived from the African region of Congo, is both a lyrical and danceable genre, rooted in the music of carnival troupes or comparsas.

==Origin==
The conga dance was believed to have been brought over from Africa by enslaved people in the West Indies, and became a popular street dance in Cuba. The style was appropriated by politicians during the early years of republic in an attempt to appeal to the masses before election. During Gerardo Machado&#x27;s dictatorship in Cuba, Havana citizens were forbidden to dance the conga since rival groups would work themselves to high excitement and start street fights. This was not the case when Fulgencio Batista became president in the 1940s - he permitted people to dance congas during elections, but a police permit was required.

==Description==
The conga dance style is more of a march, which is characterized by its distinctive conga drum rhythm. It differs from the Cuban rumba, which uses movements considered &quot;hip&quot; and shows the sensually aggressive attitude of each dancer. Conga music is played with a staccato beat as its base, which gives rhythm to the movements of the dancers. Conga dancers lift their legs in time with the rhythm of the music, marking each beat with the strong motion of their body.

The basic dance steps start from left leg 1-2-3 kick then repeat, opposite. Originally, a band member wearing a drum would venture onto the dance floor and begin zig-zagging around while drumming out the rhythm. Dancers would start joining up behind the drummer, forming a line that moves like a snake in an open circle. The line (or the circular chain) would grow longer and the drumming more intense until it finally stopped. The dance has two styles, which is a single line form and partners. The single line is more popular in Cuba.

== Western popularity ==
Beginning in the late 1930s, the dance became popular in the United States; however, in the 1940s, it became very popular due to Hollywood&#x27;s &quot;Latin&quot; musicals. RKO Pictures&#x27; offerings were particularly influential, notably &quot;Too Many Girls&quot; (1940), in which Desi Arnaz appeared as a conga-playing Argentine student. Spanish-Catalan bandleader Xavier Cugat, who gave Arnaz his musical start, helped to popularize the dance, but the biggest impact belonged to Arnaz himself. It is prominently featured in the 1941 Deanna Durbin film, &quot;It Started With Eve&quot;, in which Durbin and Charles Laughton dance the dance together in a nightclub.

With its simple march step, the interlinking of dancers circling about in single file, and one-two-three-bump rhythm with the fourth beat strongly marked, the dance was not only attractive but also readily accessible to US and other foreign audiences. The dance started to gain a foothold in the US around 1929, when the original La Conga nightclub opened its doors in Manhattan. It is believed that the La Conga was at Broadway and 51st Street. By 1937, the conga was well known in New York.

The widespread popularity of the dance resulted in many cultural references in contemporary media. For example, the conga line was a recurring theme in Warner Bros. animated cartoons of the 1940s.

This music and dance form has become totally assimilated into Cuba&#x27;s musical heritage and has been used in many film soundtracks in the US and Mexico. One of the earliest and most successful of 20th-century Cuban musical exports, the conga lacked the polyrhythmic sophistication of the son, mambo, or salsa but served to nurture the future receptivity of an international public to the wider gamut of Cuban musical styles.

== In popular culture ==

1940 “Too Many Girls” starring Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz. 

1940 “Strike Up The Band” starring Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney

In the 1950 Malayan movie entitled &quot;Twin Sisters (Kembar?)&quot;, in the opening scene, a conga line is performed by the guests in a party scene. 

The 1955 musical film adaptation of &quot;My Sister Eileen&quot; features a conga line as a recurring gag. 

In the 1963 film &quot;Billy Liar&quot;, a scene at the Locarno Dance Hall in Manchester features the conga line.

In 1984 the British band Black Lace reached number ten in the UK charts with the song &quot;Do the Conga&quot;.

In 1985 the Cuban-American band Miami Sound Machine reached number ten on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 with the song &quot;Conga&quot;.

In the 1994 film &quot;The Flintstones&quot;, the party for Fred Flintstone featured a conga line including Dino.

The long-time jingle for Dad&#x27;s Old-Fashioned Root Beer employed a conga beat.

The weekly fundraising event held by the charitable organisation Phone Credit For Refugees every Friday is based around the formation of a virtual conga line.

In the video game &quot;Team Fortress 2&quot;, players are able to form Conga lines using the in-game taunt system, by purchasing the taunt through the in-game store.

<doc id="1335697" wikidata="Q1826891" url="?curid=1335697" title="Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon 2">
<text>Tom Clancy&#x27;s Ghost Recon 2 is a tactical shooter video game developed by Red Storm Entertainment and published by Ubisoft for Xbox, PlayStation 2 and GameCube. A Microsoft Windows version was planned but cancelled in April 2005 in favor of &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter&quot;. It is a direct sequel to the 2001 video game &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Ghost Recon&quot;.

The game takes place on the Korean Peninsula, with slight variations between platforms. The GameCube and PS2 campaign occurs in 2007, while the Xbox campaign is set in 2011. &quot;Ghost Recon 2&quot; sports an updated graphics engine, the Havok 2 physics engine, new multiplayer options, and voice command ability via microphone.

==Gameplay==
In the single player campaign, the player assumes the role of Ghost Team leader, Captain Scott Mitchell; Mitchell is described as &quot;a consummate soldier&quot;, being a veteran of several armed conflicts and can use weaponry from any soldier class, including assault rifles, carbines, submachine guns, sniper rifles and more. In several missions the player is inserted alone and must complete the mission without assistance from the other Ghosts. Such missions render assistance in the form of air strikes the player can call in.

===Multiplayer===
There are several variations of multiplayer mode in &quot;Ghost Recon 2&quot;.
Co-operative games are available in the campaign mission, battle, defend, firefight, garrison, recon, and scout modes, in which players must work together to accomplish a single goal. Garrison mode, for example, is when players must keep enemy troops out of a marked area, for a designated time.

Adversarial modes are divided into two categories; Solo, where players work separately, usually against one another, and Squad, where players are divided up into opposing teams.

==Plot==
Like &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield&quot;, the plot of &quot;Ghost Recon 2&quot; differs between releases. The PlayStation 2 and GameCube versions have entirely different plots from that of the Xbox version, with the latter serving as a sequel to the former. The plot is also peripherally connected to that of &quot;Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory&quot;.

===PlayStation 2/GameCube (2007: &quot;First Contact&quot;)===
In July 2007, North Korea is devastated by a nationwide famine that forces the government to redirect much of the military budget to relief programs and civic projects. The reappropriation angers the Korean People&#x27;s Army command, especially General Jung Chong-sun, who launches a coup d&#x27;état and places the military on high alert across the DMZ. When a North Korean Super-Silkworm missile sinks the U.S. Navy intelligence-gathering vessel USS &quot;Clarence E. Walsh&quot; (CG-80), supposedly by accident, the United States deploys covert forces, including the U.S. Army&#x27;s &quot;Ghosts&quot; special forces unit and the National Security Agency&#x27;s Third Echelon, to defuse the situation in North Korea and determine the nature of the attack.

The Ghosts deploy to North Korea and conduct operations to defeat the coup forces and prevent a reignited Korean War, eventually succeeding after foiling Jung&#x27;s plan to demolish a dam and flood the DMZ, while Third Echelon uncovers the truth about the sinking. Having inflicted sufficient damage, the coup forces back down and American forces withdraw. However, four months later, one of Jung&#x27;s subordinates, General Paik, activates a Taepodong-2 MIRV nuclear missile and targets South Korea, the United States, and NATO. The Ghosts redeploy to North Korea to prevent the launch and destroy the missile. With their plans in disarray, Paik commits suicide while Jung plots revenge.

===Xbox (2011: &quot;Final Assault&quot;)===
In 2011, North Korea has recovered from the initial conflict in 2007. Emboldened and still seeking revenge, Jung launches another coup to overthrow the North Korean government and prepares to spark a greater Korean War involving all of Asia by targeting Asian and Western countries with North Korea&#x27;s nuclear arsenal. In response, the U.S., NATO, and Australia deploy a peacekeeping force to the region alongside the Ghosts to counter the North Korean threat.

The Ghosts deploy to North Korea and launch another successful campaign against North Korea, whittling their combat capabilities and supply lines. Faced with dwindling supplies and growing dissent among the populace, Jung becomes increasingly desperate to retain control and attempts to crush dissent by force, eventually culminating in an attempt to destroy his own rebellious cities using nuclear warheads hidden in trains that is foiled when the Ghosts intercept them.

Now out of options, Jung leads the capture of a dam near Hamhung with a nuclear warhead, planning a repeat of his attempted flooding attack from 2007. The Ghosts attack once more to disable the warhead and kill Jung, preventing the escalation of the Korean conflict.

==Expansion packs==

===&quot;Ghost Recon 2: Summit Strike&quot;===
&quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Ghost Recon 2: Summit Strike&quot; is a standalone expansion pack for &quot;Ghost Recon 2&quot; available exclusively on the Xbox. &quot;Summit Strike&quot; included 11 new single-player missions, as well as new weapons (such as the FN SCAR) and an expanded multiplayer game. It was released on August 2, 2005.

==Reception==
By the end of 2004, after seven weeks of availability, &quot;Ghost Recon 2&quot; had sold 1.4 million copies.

&quot;Ghost Recon 2&quot; was met with positive (Xbox) to very mixed reception (PS2 and Gamecube). GameRankings and Metacritic gave it a score of 82.67% and 80 out of 100 for the Xbox version; 63.34% and 58 out of 100 for the PlayStation 2 version; and 48.67% and 54 out of 100 for the GameCube version.

The game was criticized by the North Korean government for its storyline.

<doc id="1335700" wikidata="Q328913" url="?curid=1335700" title="Claude Bloodgood">
<text>Claude Frizzell Bloodgood III (alias: Klaus Frizzel Bluttgutt III; July 14, 1937 – August 4, 2001) was a controversial American chess player. As a young man, he got into trouble with the law and was arrested several times. He was sentenced to death in 1970 after having been convicted of murdering his mother, although this sentence was later commuted to life in prison. While in prison, he remained a very active chess player, playing a large number of correspondence games and rated games with other inmates. Over time, he achieved a very high ranking in the United States Chess Federation (USCF) by playing in a closed pool, which allowed rating manipulation. He died in prison in 2001.

== Early life ==

Bloodgood was born in Norfolk, Virginia, to Claude Frizzell Bloodgood Jr. and Margaret B. Howell.

== Early chess career ==
In 1955, Bloodgood played a number of chess games against actor Humphrey Bogart, who was a good amateur player.

Bloodgood was an active chess organizer in Hampton Roads, Virginia in the late 1950s. He was the rating statistician for the Virginia State Chess Federation, where he rated himself at an Elo rating of 1956.

== Life in prison, chess and brief escape ==

In the early 1960s, he was twice convicted of burglary and served prison time in Delaware. He was also convicted of forgery of his parents&#x27; accounts, and spent more time in jail. In 1969, just nine days after being released from prison, he murdered his mother, Margaret Bloodgood (whom he later claimed to be his stepmother). According to reports, he rolled her body in a carpet and left it in Dismal Swamp, where it was soon found. His death sentence was ultimately commuted to life imprisonment after &quot;Furman v. Georgia&quot;, the 1972 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that the death penalty, as then administered, was unconstitutional.

From prison, Bloodgood played thousands of chess games by mail, as well as thousands with fellow inmates. He also published three books on chess openings, including &quot;The Tactical Grob&quot; (on 1.g4) .

In 1974, Bloodgood and fellow inmate Lewis Capleaner received a furlough to play in a chess tournament. They overpowered the single guard assigned to them and escaped, but they were recaptured after a few days.

== Legal challenges ==

Bloodgood filed two petitions for habeas corpus with the courts. His contention was that the death sentence, later commuted to life, was based in part on the fact that he was a repeat offender, having been convicted twice of burglary in Delaware. But these convictions had been obtained before the U.S. Supreme Court decision of Gideon v. Wainwright which guaranteed the right to counsel. He argued that since no defense attorney had been assigned to him in the Delaware cases, the two convictions were unconstitutional and thus the Virginia death sentence was unconstitutional as well. The courts rejected his contentions, resulting in decisions of the Virginia Supreme Court in Bloodgood v. Virginia and the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Bloodgood v. Garraghty, 783 F.2d 470 (4th Cir. 1986).

== High rank possibly via manipulation ==
Bloodgood organized chess games within Powhatan Correctional Center in Powhatan, Virginia, which were by necessity with fellow inmates. Many of these inmates were taught the game by Bloodgood, and thus began as unrated and inexperienced players. Bloodgood obtained USCF memberships for them. Some accused Bloodgood, with his intimate knowledge of the rating system, of rigging their ratings. The accusation was that he arranged for new prisoners to play rated games against other prisoners, who would deliberately lose, thus giving the new inmate an inflated USCF rating. Bloodgood, it is further alleged, then played rated games against the new highly rated prisoner, and each time he won, gained a few more rating points. This continued for several years, and by 1997 his rating rose to 2759, making the 59-year-old Bloodgood the second highest rated player in the nation, behind only Gata Kamsky.

This is all a matter of considerable controversy even today. Bloodgood himself vehemently denied these accusations, and said that he played chess in the only competitions available to him, prison tournaments, and won almost every game because he was the strongest player in the prison system. As his rating rose, he wrote to the USCF to warn them that its system was prone to &quot;closed pool&quot; rating inflation. But nothing was done until Bloodgood&#x27;s rating skyrocketed. By virtue of his high rating, Bloodgood would have qualified for entry into the U.S. Chess Championship, a prestigious invitation-only event intended for the best 16 players in the country. This caused an investigation by the USCF, which debated extensively what to do about the situation. In the end, Bloodgood wasn&#x27;t invited to the event (which he could not have attended anyway), and the USCF changed its rating system rules to attempt to prevent &quot;closed pool&quot; ratings inflation from prison memberships.

== Later life in prison ==

Late in life, Bloodgood made a variety of claims that seemed designed to obtain a release from prison. For example, he claimed to have been born in 1924 and asked for a furlough based on old age. He claimed to have been born in Germany or Mexico and asked to be extradited to those countries or to be involved in prisoner exchange. He also claimed to have been a Nazi spy during World War II. He often gave interviews, trying to convince the interviewer that he was completely innocent of his crimes and a victim of mistaken identity. Bloodgood died in Powhatan Correctional Center of lung cancer on August 4, 2001.

== Library ==
The Cleveland Public Library houses the Claude F. Bloodgood Collection, which &quot;contains the personal papers of Claude F. Bloodgood, including legal documents, medical and other prison records, and chess related items.&quot;

<doc id="1335701" wikidata="Q5354324" url="?curid=1335701" title="Eleanor Maltravers">
<text>Eleanor Maltravers, or Mautravers, ( 1345 – January 1405) was an English noblewoman. The granddaughter and eventual heiress of the first Baron Maltravers, she married two barons in succession and passed her grandfather&#x27;s title to her grandson.

==Origins==
Her father was Sir John Maltravers, son of John Maltravers, 1st Baron Maltravers and his first wife Millicent. Eleanor&#x27;s mother, a woman called Gwenthlian of unknown family, died in 1349, leaving Eleanor and her two siblings:

* Henry (born in 1347), who died in infancy;
* Joan (born about 1342), who married first Sir John Keynes and secondly Sir Robert Rous.

When her grandfather John died in 1364, his two heiresses were Eleanor and her sister Joan. When Joan died without leaving children, Eleanor herself became the sole inheritor of his title.

==First marriage==
On 17 February 1359, she married Sir John FitzAlan. Their children included:
:Sir John, who married Elizabeth, daughter of Edward le Despencer, 1st Baron le Despencer, with whom he had three sons.
:Sir William, KG, who married a wife named Agnes but had no children.
:Sir Richard, who married Alice, the widow of Roger Burley, and had one son and three daughters.
:Joan, who married first Sir William Bryan and secondly Sir William Etchingham.
:Margaret, who married William de Ros, 6th Baron de Ros.

Her husband was summoned to Parliament on 4 August 1377, for which he is regarded as 1st Baron Arundel, and died in a shipwreck on 15 December 1379, his body being washed ashore in Ireland and buried there.

==Second marriage==
On 9 August 1380 she married as his second wife Reginald Cobham, 2nd Baron Cobham, of Sterborough. Their children included: 
:Reginald, later 3rd Baron Cobham of Sterborough, who married Eleanor Culpeper and was the father of Eleanor, first the mistress and then the second wife of Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester.
:Margaret, who married Sir Reginald Curtis, of Westcliffe, and had children.

After the birth of their son and heir Reginald in 1381, it was realised that as they were second cousins, both being great-grandchildren of Maurice Berkeley, 2nd Baron Berkeley, their marriage was invalid and their child, being therefore illegitimate, could not inherit. After obtaining an annulment of the marriage, followed by a papal dispensation waiving their consanguinity, they married again on 29 September 1384. This did not however legalise the status of young Reginald, for when his father died in July 1403 his inheritance was seized by the king on the grounds that there was no legitimate male heir.

==Death and legacy==
Eleanor died on 10 or 12 January 1405, and was buried at Lewes Priory, Sussex. Her will dated 26 September 1404, was proved on 16 January 1405 at Maidstone, Kent.

After her death, her grandfather&#x27;s title passed to her grandson John FitzAlan, 13th Earl of Arundel, who was also called Baron Maltravers.

<text>Eric &quot;Doc&quot; Hammer (born February 2, 1967) is an American voice actor, musician, writer and artist. He performed in the gothic rock bands Requiem in White from 1985 to 1995 and Mors Syphilitica from 1995 to 2002, both with his then-wife Lisa Hammer. His film credits include a number of Lisa&#x27;s projects—released through their own production company Blessed Elysium—in which he participated as a writer, actor, composer, designer, and visual effects artist. He also composed the music for the 1997 film &quot;A, B, C... Manhattan&quot;. He and Christopher McCulloch are the co-creators, writers, and editors of the animated television series &quot;The Venture Bros.&quot; (2004–2020), in which Hammer voices several recurring characters including Billy Quizboy, Henchman 21, Dr. Mrs. The Monarch, and Dermott Fictel. The show is produced through Hammer and McCulloch&#x27;s company Astro-Base Go. Hammer is also the guitarist and lead vocalist of the band Weep, which formed in 2008. In 2021, Hammer founded the band Pageant Girls with vocalist Ivy Jaff.

==Early life==
Hammer was born in Ledyard, Connecticut. He has stated that his hair naturally grows in both black and blonde, a condition he attributes to &quot;a pigmentation problem or a birthmark or something. But my hair is naturally like this... Kinda. Because my eyebrows are black, I used to dye my whole head that color. Also, I used to enjoy looking like Dracula for some asinine reason.&quot; He lives with Ménière&#x27;s disease, a disorder of the inner ear that can affect hearing and balance. He is a self-taught oil painter.

==Personal life==
He adopted the pseudonym &quot;Doc&quot; in the mid-2000s.

In July 2018, Dark Horse Books, a division of Dark Horse Comics, published &quot;Go Team Venture!: The Art and Making of The Venture Bros&quot;. The book, co-authored by Hammer, Christopher McCulloch, and Kenneth Plume details the entire history of the creation of &quot;The Venture Bros.&quot; episode by episode from seasons one through six.

At an unspecified point in his adult life Hammer suffered a back injury that left him paraplegic. He regained the use of his legs but was left with a numb section in his back.

<doc id="1335715" wikidata="Q2073881" url="?curid=1335715" title="Peter Beinart">
<text>Peter Alexander Beinart (; born February 28, 1971) is an American liberal columnist, journalist, and political commentator. A former editor of &quot;The New Republic&quot;, he has also written for &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, and &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, among other periodicals. He has written four books.

He is a professor of journalism and political science at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York. He is an editor-at-large at &quot;Jewish Currents,&quot; a contributing opinion columnist at &quot;The New York Times&quot;, a political commentator for MSNBC, and a fellow at the Foundation for Middle East Peace.

==Early life and education==
Beinart was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts. His parents were Jewish immigrants from South Africa. His maternal grandfather was from Russia, and his maternal grandmother, who was Sephardic, was from Egypt. His father&#x27;s parents were from Lithuania. His mother, Doreen (&quot;née&quot; Pienaar), is a former director of the human-rights film program at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, and his father, Julian Beinart, is a former professor of architecture at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His stepfather is theatre critic and playwright Robert Brustein.

Beinart attended Buckingham Browne and Nichols School in Cambridge, graduating in 1989. He then studied history and political science at Yale College, where he was a member of the Yale Political Union and graduated in 1993 with the Alpheus Henry Snow Prize. He was a Rhodes Scholar at University College, Oxford University, where he earned an M.Phil. in international relations in 1995.

==Career==
Beinart worked at &quot;The New Republic&quot; as the managing editor from 1995 to 1997, then as senior editor until 1999, and as the magazine&#x27;s editor from 1999 to 2006. For much of that time he also wrote &quot;The New Republic&quot;″s &quot;TRB&quot; column, which was reprinted in the &quot;New York Post&quot; and other newspapers. From 2007 until 2009 he was a Senior Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. Beinart is Associate Professor of Journalism and Political Science at the City University of New York. He has written for &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, and other periodicals. He has appeared on various TV news discussion programs and is a political commentator for &quot;MSNBC&quot;. His editor-in-chief at the &quot;Forward&quot; called him a &quot;wunderkind&quot;. He was also a senior political writer for &quot;The Daily Beast&quot;. On March 12, 2012, Beinart launched a new group blog, &quot;Zion Square&quot;, renamed &quot;Open Zion&quot; two weeks later, at &quot;The Daily Beast/Newsweek&quot;. Also in 2012, Beinart was included on &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of 100 top global thinkers.

On November 4, 2013, &quot;Haaretz&quot; announced that Beinart would be hired as a columnist beginning January 1, 2014. The same day, the Atlantic Media Company said he would join &quot;National Journal&quot; and write for &quot;The Atlantic&quot;&#x27;s website beginning in January, and a statement from &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; said &quot;Open Zion&quot; would cease. In 2017, Beinart left &quot;Haaretz&quot; and became a columnist for &quot;The Forward&quot;, where he stayed until 2020, when he joined &quot;Jewish Currents&quot; as an editor-at-large.

In August 2018, Beinart was detained by Shin Bet at Israel&#x27;s Ben Gurion Airport and questioned about his presence at West Bank protests and outspoken criticism of the Israeli government&#x27;s policies toward the Palestinians. Beinart called his experience &quot;trivial&quot; when compared to the experiences of others, particularly Palestinians and Palestinian Americans who travel through Israel&#x27;s main airport. A statement issued by the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office said Benjamin Netanyahu asked the Israeli security forces how it happened and was told that Beinart&#x27;s detention was an administrative mistake. The statement continued, &quot;Israel is an open society which welcomes all—critics and supporters alike.&quot;

==Works and views==
Beinart was the editor of &quot;The New Republic&quot; when the publication editorially supported the 2003 Invasion of Iraq; Beinart was identified as one of the major forces behind the magazine&#x27;s support for the war. In 2004, a New Republic editorial written during his editorial tenure assessed its support for the Iraq War thus: &quot;We feel regret, but no shame. ... Our strategic rationale for war has collapsed.&quot; In 2010, Beinart said he was motivated to support the Iraq War by a concern that Saddam Hussein was developing nuclear weapons.

Beinart is the author of the 2006 book &quot;The Good Fight: Why Liberals—and Only Liberals—Can Win the War on Terror and Make America Great Again&quot;. The book, which grew out of a 2004 article in &quot;The New Republic&quot; arguing that Democrats need to take the threat of Islamic totalitarianism more seriously, is a liberal defense of muscular interventionism abroad, particularly with a view to reforming various nations in the Middle East.

Beinart&#x27;s second book, &quot;The Icarus Syndrome: A History of American Hubris&quot; (2010), was born from his desire to understand how he had gotten the Iraq War so wrong. It &quot;look[ed] back at the past hundred years of U.S. foreign policy in the baleful light of recent events [and found] the ground littered with ... the remnants of large ideas and unearned confidence [as demonstrable in] a study of three needless wars&quot;, World War I, the Vietnam War, and the Iraq War.

Beinart&#x27;s third book Is &quot;The Crisis of Zionism&quot; (2012). It describes his views on the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Particularly, Beinart contends that policies advocated by Zionists, especially under Benjamin Netanyahu&#x27;s Likud government, are increasingly at odds with liberal ideals.

Beinart&#x27;s fourth book, &quot;Being Jewish After the Destruction of Gaza: A Reckoning&quot;, was released in January 2025. In it, he argues that &quot;Jewish texts, history, and language have been deployed to justify mass slaughter and starvation [of the population of Gaza]&quot;.

==Personal life==
As of 2012, Beinart lives in New York City. He keeps kosher, regularly attends an Orthodox synagogue, and has sent his children to a Jewish day school.

<text>Rachel Perry (born January 20, 1976) is a Canadian TV personality working in the United States. The former MuchMusic VJ is the host of &quot;All Access&quot; on VH1, and is the narrator for &quot;Web Junk 20&quot;, and the host of &quot;The Stash&quot; on Playboy TV. 

Born in Brockville, Ontario, Perry has done numerous narrations and voiceovers for VH1 shows, specials and Viacom channels specials, including Viacom owned gay and lesbian station Logo. She was also the co-host of VH1&#x27;s reality show &quot;Strip Search&quot; which lasted for one season. She was co-host of &quot;Pepsi Smash&quot;. Perry began working at VH1 in January 2001 where she hosted &quot;VH1 News&quot;, &quot;All Access&quot; and the morning video show. In June 2001, she hosted Not Much On Day, a MuchMusic marathon of music videos which featured pop stars wearing little or no clothing. Perry appeared naked throughout the marathon with various objects covering her body. Until March 2006, she was also the host of VH1&#x27;s &quot;Top 20 Countdown&quot;. She sometimes co-hosted with fellow Canadians Aamer Haleem and Bradford How. She narrated the behind the scenes program for &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot;, which is featured on the DVD for it.

==Other works==
In the meantime, Perry is also the host of VH1 Radio Network&#x27;s &quot;Weekly Rewind&quot; radio program, heard on top stations around the country and distributed by Westwood One. She had also done &quot;content wrap&quot; spots for The CW&#x27;s &quot;c-what&#x27;s happening&quot; commercial segments, but they have seemed to be discontinued after a number of weeks.

Perry appeared as a guest star in an episode of &quot;&quot; called &quot;Heart of Glass&quot;. The episode was aired on February 14, 2007.

Perry used to be neighbors with Ed Begley, Jr. and Bill Nye, and has appeared on at least one episode of Ed Begley, Jr.&#x27;s show &quot;Living With Ed&quot;, which airs on Planet Green.

===Playboy Channel host===

Perry is the host and a co-writer of the Playboy Channel&#x27;s &quot;The Stash&quot;—a &quot;Soup-esque&quot; (see The Soup) style format in which she comments on video clips and photos from adult media.

===&quot;Dirty Jobs&quot;===
Perry appeared in Discovery Channel&#x27;s &quot;Dirty Jobs&quot; on the 100th Job special, as a possible &quot;replacement&quot; for Mike Rowe. The segment featured her and other female guest stars attempting to clean out septic tanks, with Perry&#x27;s reaction the most extreme.

===&quot;Adam Carolla Show;&quot; controversy===
On December 29, 2005, it was announced that Perry would be joining Adam Carolla&#x27;s new radio show in January 2006.

On March 20–21, 2006, the show announced that Perry was absent to rehearse for a television pilot. (The pilot was a show called &quot;Beyond&quot;, a drama based on NASA&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.)

She was absent again beginning on March 27 when the pilot was filmed. What was initially announced as a short absence grew into several weeks, during which the show featured several guests filling her role on the show.

On May 1, Carolla announced that Perry had been let go from the show and was replaced, permanently, by Teresa Strasser on May 8, 2006.

<doc id="1335722" wikidata="Q212216" url="?curid=1335722" title="Venceslaus Ulricus Hammershaimb">
<text>Venceslaus Ulricus Hammershaimb (, ; March 25, 1819 – April 8, 1909) was a Faroese Lutheran minister who established the modern orthography of Faroesethe language of the Faroe Islandsbased on the Icelandic language, which like Faroese, derives from Old Norse.

==Background==
Hammershaimb was born in Sandavágur on the island of Vágar in the Faroe Islands. He was a Lutheran parish priest in Kvívík and a rural dean in Nes on the Faroese island of Eysturoy before settling in Denmark in 1878. In addition to his contributions to the written standard of Faroese, he was also a known folklorist. During the years 1847–1848, and again in 1853, he returned to the Faroe Islands to study the dialects and to collect the native ballads and folklore, which he published in 1851–1855 under the title of &quot;Færöiske Kvæder&quot;. In 1854, he published a grammar of Faroese.

==Faroese language==
At one point, the language spoken in the Faroe Islands was Old West Norse, which Norwegian settlers had brought with them. Between the 9th and the 15th centuries, a distinct Faroese language evolved, although it was still intelligible to speakers of Old West Norse. It would have been closely related to the Norn language of Orkney and Shetland. However, for some 300 years until the 19th century, under the dual kingdom of Denmark–Norway, Danish was the language of religion, education, and administration in the Faroe Islands.

Hammershaimb created his spelling system for Faroese in 1846. It was etymological, with the vowels based on written Icelandic, rather than phonetically descriptive (as in, for example, Welsh). For instance, the letter eth (Ð ð) has no phonemes attached to it. In this, Hammershaimb had accepted the advice of the Icelandic independence leader Jón Sigurðsson, who had seen the manuscript for his (&quot;Notes with Respect to Faroese Pronunciation&quot;); Hammershaimb considered that, despite its artificiality, this was the only approach that would overcome the problems of differing dialects in the islands. Hammershaimb&#x27;s orthography met with some opposition for its complexity. In 1889, Jakob Jakobsen proposed modifying Hammershaimb&#x27;s system to bring it closer to the spoken language, but a committee charged with considering the proposal in 1895 advocated only minor revisions, and the bulk of Hammershaimb&#x27;s orthography remained in force. In 1886–1891, Hammershaimb published his principal work, ; it incorporated an account of the islands and their inhabitants, a variety of prose and verse in the Faroese language, and a grammar, andin the second volumea lexicon by Jakobsen.

==Literature in Faroese==
A new national written literature in Faroese became possible only after the language&#x27;s orthography was normalized. Its development was promoted by nationalist agitation, which hastened the restoration of the Faroese Parliament in 1852 and the end of the Danish royal trade monopoly in 1856. During the late 19th century, modern Faroese literature began to appear and the first Faroese newspaper, , appeared in 1890. Faroese literature came into its own after the turn of the 20th century. After World War II, Faroese became the official language of the Faroe Islands.

<text>Luol Ajou Deng (born 16 April 1985) is a South Sudanese–British former professional basketball player. He was a two-time NBA All-Star and was named to the NBA All-Defensive Second Team in 2012. Born in South Sudan that was then part of Sudan, Deng fled the country with his family as a child, eventually settling in the United Kingdom. He became a British citizen in 2006, and has played for the Great Britain national team.

After playing college basketball for the Duke Blue Devils, Deng was selected by the Phoenix Suns in the first round of the 2004 NBA draft with the seventh overall pick. He was named to the NBA All-Rookie First Team as a 19-year-old in 2005. The small forward was an All-Star with the Bulls in 2012 and 2013 before splitting the 2013–14 season with the Cleveland Cavaliers. After just half a season with Cleveland, Deng joined the Miami Heat for 2014–15. He played two seasons for the Heat before signing with the Lakers in 2016. He spent his last season with the Minnesota Timberwolves.

Deng has been the president of the South Sudan Basketball Federation since 2019. He is an assistant coach for the South Sudan men&#x27;s national team and has previously served as its head coach.

==Early life==
Deng was born in Wau, Sudan and is a member of the Dinka ethnic group. When he was young, his father Aldo, a member of the Sudanese parliament, moved the family to Egypt to escape the Second Sudanese Civil War. In Egypt, they met former NBA player Manute Bol, another Dinka, who taught Deng&#x27;s older brother, Ajou Deng, how to play basketball and also mentored Luol. When they were granted political asylum, his family immigrated to Brixton in South London.

Deng was educated at St Mary&#x27;s Roman Catholic High School, a voluntary aided state comprehensive school in Croydon in South London. He developed an interest in football, admiring Faustino Asprilla of Newcastle United F.C., but also continued to play basketball, and was invited to join England&#x27;s 15-and-under team in that sport. During this time, he began his career at Brixton TopCats. At Brixton, Deng was coached by Jimmy Rogers, who convinced him to play basketball. He represented Croydon at the London Youth Games, and was inducted into their Hall of Fame. At age 13, he played for England under-18 team in the 1998 FIBA Europe Under-18 Championship qualifying tournament, averaging 40 points and 14 rebounds, and was named the most valuable player (MVP) of the tournament. Next, he led England to the finals of the European Junior National Tournament, where he averaged (34) points and earned another MVP award.

At age 14, Deng moved to the United States to play basketball at Blair Academy in New Jersey. One of his teammates was future NBA player Charlie Villanueva. Deng was also named a tri-captain at Blair along with Villanueva. During his senior year, Deng was considered the second most promising high school senior in the United States after LeBron James and was named First Team All-America by &quot;Parade&quot; and USA Today. He was selected to play in the McDonald&#x27;s High School All-America game, but could not play due to a foot injury.

Considered a five-star recruit by Rivals.com, Deng was listed as the no. 1 small forward and the no. 2 player in the nation in 2003.

==College career==
Deng accepted an athletic scholarship to attend Duke University, where he played for coach Mike Krzyzewski&#x27;s Duke Blue Devils basketball team in 2003–04. In one season at Duke, he appeared in 37 games and made 32 starts. He averaged 30.1 minutes and 15.1 points per game en route to a berth in the 2004 Final Four. He was the 10th freshman in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) history to lead all freshmen in scoring, rebounding, and field goal percentage.

==Professional career==

===Chicago Bulls (2004–2014)===

====2004–05 season====
After one year at Duke, Deng entered the 2004 NBA draft. He was picked seventh overall by the Phoenix Suns, but was immediately traded to the Chicago Bulls by prior agreement. Deng suffered a season-ending wrist injury late in his rookie season, but still made the NBA All-Rookie First Team and helped the resurgent Bulls return to the playoffs for the first time in seven years. Deng played in 61 games and averaged 11.7 points per game. On 8 February 2005, Deng recorded his first double-double in a 107–100 win against the Dallas Mavericks.

====2005–06 season====
In his second season, he posted strong performances throughout March and April 2006, to help the Bulls earn their second consecutive playoff berth. His offensive statistics improved in his sophomore season, increasing his scoring to 14.3 points per game, and increasing his rebounding to 6.6 per game, up from a 5.3 average in his rookie season. Deng had four straight double-double performances from 28 February to 5 March, with at least 10 points and rebounds in each game. In the playoffs, the Bulls faced off against the Miami Heat in a seven-game series. Deng came off the bench in all six games, averaging 10 points per game.

====2006–07 season====
For the 2006–07 season, Deng was the only Bulls player to start all 82 regular season games. His statistics continued to improve, and he led the team in minutes played (37.5) and field goal percentage (.517), while playing a strong second scoring option to Ben Gordon, with a marked improvement to 18.8 points per game. Deng also notably rarely committed fouls on defense (2.00 per game), despite the minutes he played and frequently being outsized in matchups against power forwards such as Kevin Garnett.

On 27 December 2006, Deng was driving in the lane when Miami Heat&#x27;s James Posey grabbed him, causing concern that Deng may have re-injured his wrist. Posey earned a flagrant foul, was ejected and suspended for one game. Deng scored 32 points against the Cleveland Cavaliers just three nights later, resolving concern that the wrist would be re-injured. On 26 March 2007, Deng posted a new career-high 38 points to lead the Bulls to a 100–89 victory against the Portland Trail Blazers. Deng converted 18 of his 25 shots from the field. On 3 May, Deng won the NBA Sportsmanship Award. For that award, the league donated $25,000 on his behalf to Pacific Garden Mission, the oldest continuously operating rescue mission in the country.

====2007–08 season====
Near the beginning of the 2007–08 season, the Bulls started negotiating a contract extension with Deng. Negotiations were mostly handled by Bulls chairman Jerry Reinsdorf. The team offered Deng a five-year extension for $57.5 million. However, Deng decided to reject the deal and wait until the season ended to continue negotiations.

In the 2007–08 season, Deng played in 63 games, missing 19 mostly because of left Achilles tendinitis. Despite injuries, he averaged 17.0 points per game and 6.3 rebounds per game. He had his best game of the season against the Milwaukee Bucks when he scored 32 points in a 151–135 victory. The Bulls missed the playoffs in the 2007–08 season for the first time since 2004.

====2008–09 season====

Before the 2008–09 season started, Deng agreed to a contract extension for six years and $71 million. After the agreement was announced, Bulls general manager John Paxson said in a statement &quot;Signing Luol has always been a priority for this organization and we have always felt that he was a big part of our future. We are very happy that Luol will now be with us long term as we continue to grow as an organization.&quot;

Due to injury, Deng played in 48 games. During the regular season his scoring dropped to 14.1 points per game and his rebounding dropped to 6.0 per game. The Bulls made the playoffs, but Deng missed the 2009 playoffs due to injury.

====2009–10 season====
Deng played in a total of 70 games during the 2009–10 season, also increasing his scoring and rebounding to 17.6 and 7.3 respectively, helping the Bulls make the playoffs again. He missed 11 straight games at the end of March 2010, because of a sprained right calf.

During the first round of the 2010 playoffs, Deng averaged 18.8 points along with 5.0 rebounds per game against the Cleveland Cavaliers. He scored 26 points in the final game of the series, but could not prevent the Bulls from being eliminated by the Cavaliers.

====2010–11 season====
On 1 November 2010, Deng scored a new career-high 40 points, hitting 14 of his 19 shots, along with 9 of 11 free throws, against the Portland Trail Blazers, scoring a point a minute. On 24 February 2011, he recorded 20 points, 10 rebounds, and hit the game winning three-point shot with 16 seconds left in a game against the Miami Heat. Throughout the season, Deng significantly improved his three-point shooting after coach Tom Thibodeau asked him to. In the past four seasons, Deng attempted 132 three-point shots, whereas during this season he attempted 333, making 115.

Deng finished the season averaging 17.4 points and 5.8 rebounds per game, being the third scorer for the Bulls behind Derrick Rose (25.0) and Carlos Boozer (17.5). During the first round of the 2011 playoffs against the Indiana Pacers, Deng averaged 18.6 points and 6.2 rebounds per game, being the second leading scorer of the team behind Derrick Rose.

On 31 March 2011, Eric Bressman of &quot;Dime&quot; magazine called Deng &quot;the most underrated player&quot; writing he was &quot;never the face of the franchise but always the backbone&quot;. Coach Thibodeau has consistently called Deng the &quot;glue&quot; that holds the Bulls together. &quot;Luol&#x27;s professional. He practices hard. He prepares well. He studies his opponent. He&#x27;s great at executing offensively and defensively. He&#x27;s helped this team get better every day,&quot; said Thibodeau.

Deng was the Bulls&#x27; second leading scorer during the playoffs. In the first game of the Eastern Conference finals against the Miami Heat, Deng was praised for his defense on LeBron James. However, the Heat went on to eliminate the Bulls in five games. Deng averaged just under 43 minutes, 16.9 points, 6.6 rebounds and 2.7 assists per game during the 2011 playoffs.

====2011–12 season: All-Star season====

Deng injured his wrist during the fourth quarter against the Charlotte Bobcats on 21 January 2012. Initially thought to be a minor injury, it was later revealed by a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that Deng tore the ligament in his left wrist. He decided to postpone surgery and play the rest of the 2011–12 season through the pain. He returned to the starting line-up against the Milwaukee Bucks on 4 February 2012, scoring 21 points with 9 rebounds, 1 steal, and 1 block. On 9 February, Deng was selected as a reserve for the 2012 NBA All-Star Game, joining teammate Derrick Rose, who was voted in as a starter. This was the first time since 1997 (when both Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen made the team) that the Bulls had two All-Stars in the NBA All-Star Game. Deng made a buzzer-beating game winner on 24 March, off a tip-in basket to lift the Bulls 102–101 in overtime versus the Toronto Raptors. At the end of the season, Deng was selected for the NBA All-Defensive Second Team.

====2012–13 season: Second All-Star season====
Deng was selected as a reserve for the 2013 NBA All-Star Game, along with Joakim Noah. During the 2012–13 season, he averaged a team-high 16.5 points, 6.3 rebounds, and a career-high 3 assists per game. His free throw percentage of .816 was also a career high. He again led the league in minutes per game with (38.7). Even without Derrick Rose, who was out for the whole year due to an ACL injury, the Bulls still tallied a 45–37 record, finishing fifth in the Eastern Conference and second in the Central Division.

The Bulls met the Brooklyn Nets in the first round of the 2013 playoffs, and defeated the Nets in seven games. They then met the Miami Heat in the conference semifinals. The Heat defeated the Bulls in five games. The Heat went on to win the 2013 NBA Finals. During the 2013 playoffs, Deng averaged 13.8 points, 7.6 rebounds, and 3.8 assists in 44.8 minutes per game.

====2013–14 season====
Deng&#x27;s representatives and Bulls executives had informal talks about extending his contract over the summer, but the team never made a formal offer. Deng&#x27;s contract was set to expire after the 2013–14 season, and he sought a new contract close to $12 million a year over 4–5 seasons. Rumors about him being traded continued throughout the season.

During the first months of the season, Deng again emerged as the Bulls leading scorer with the absence of Derrick Rose. He had his best performances on 27 and 30 November 2013, when he scored 27 points against the Detroit Pistons and the Cleveland Cavaliers in two separate games. He also registered six rebounds against the Pistons, and 11 assists against the Cavaliers. During the first two months of the season, Deng averaged a career-high of 19 points and 3.7 assists per game, and also averaged 6.9 rebounds per game.

===Cleveland Cavaliers (2014)===
On 7 January 2014, the Chicago Bulls traded Deng to the Cleveland Cavaliers for Andrew Bynum, two future second-round draft picks in 2015 and 2016 (initially traded from the Trail Blazers to the Cavaliers), a protected future pick the Cavaliers received from the Sacramento Kings, and the right to swap first-round picks with the Cavaliers in the 2015 draft. At the time of the trade, Deng was the fifth-longest tenured Bulls player, and fourth-leading scorer in franchise history.

In his Cavaliers debut, Deng had 10 points, one rebound, one steal, and four turnovers in 21 minutes. Two games later, he scored 27 points with five rebounds, four assists, and one block. This was his highest-scoring game with the Cavaliers. Deng finished the season averaging 14.1 points and 2.5 assists.

===Miami Heat (2014–2016)===
On 15 July 2014, Deng signed with the Miami Heat. He had his best scoring game of the 2014–15 season on 20 January 2015, when he scored 29 points against the Philadelphia 76ers. Deng finished the season averaging 14 points and 5.2 rebounds per game.

On 29 June 2015, Deng exercised his player option for the 2015–16 season. On 1 August, Deng played for Team Africa at the 2015 NBA Africa exhibition game. In late November and early December 2015, Deng missed six games with a left hamstring strain. On 19 February 2016, he scored a season-high 30 points in a 115–111 win over the Atlanta Hawks. The Heat finished the regular season as the third seed in the Eastern Conference with a 48–34 record. In the first round of the 2016 playoffs, the Heat faced the sixth-seeded Charlotte Hornets, and in a game 1 win on 17 April, Deng set a Heat playoff debut record with 31 points on 11-for-13 shooting.

===Los Angeles Lakers (2016–2018)===
On 7 July 2016, Deng signed a four-year, $72 million contract with the Los Angeles Lakers. The Lakers signed the two-time All-Star along with Timofey Mozgov to big contracts in a bid to remain competitive after Kobe Bryant&#x27;s recent retirement. However, in February 2017, Magic Johnson became the Lakers&#x27; president of basketball operations, and coach Luke Walton benched Deng to start rookie Brandon Ingram. He missed the final 22 games of the 2016–17 season after being shut down in March to give more playing time to the team&#x27;s young players.

On opening night of the 2017–18 season, Deng made a substitute start in place of a suspended Kentavious Caldwell-Pope; it was the only game he played the entire season. He and head coach Walton mutually decided that it was better for him to stay in the locker room during games than to play meaningless minutes in garbage time. On 1 September 2018, he was waived and stretched by the Lakers after reaching a buyout agreement. The move freed him to find playing time elsewhere, while the Lakers gained salary cap space to potentially offer a maximum contract to a free agent in 2019. Deng had been the highest-paid Laker in each of his two seasons.

===Minnesota Timberwolves (2018–2019)===
On 10 September 2018, Deng signed with the Minnesota Timberwolves, reuniting him with Derrick Rose, Jimmy Butler, Taj Gibson, and head coach Tom Thibodeau. On 11 February 2019, Deng started in place of an ill Andrew Wiggins and scored 12 points in a 130–120 win against the Los Angeles Clippers. It was Deng&#x27;s first start since 19 October 2017, his lone game for the Timberwolves during the 2017–18 season.

Deng&#x27;s final NBA game was played on February 27, 2019, in a 131–123 loss to the Atlanta Hawks. In his final game, Deng recorded one rebound and one steal in eight minutes of playing time.

He would go on to sign a one-day contract with the Bulls to retire with the team.

==National team career==
Deng represented England at under-16 and under-19 levels, and was an ambassador for the 2012 Summer Olympics. In October 2006, Deng became a naturalised British citizen in a ceremony in Croydon and was called up to play in European competition for the Great Britain national team. He made his debut in a closed international test match against Georgia national team in Pau, France, on 9 August 2007, scoring 19 points. In his first competitive qualifying game representing Great Britain, Deng collected 21 points, 10 rebounds, two assists, three steals and two blocks against Slovakia national team, at Birmingham&#x27;s National Indoor Arena on 21 August 2007. He played with the team at the 2012 Summer Olympics, where he averaged 15.8 points, 6.6 rebounds, and 4.6 assists. However, Great Britain finished with a 1–4 record.

Deng retains South Sudanese citizenship in addition to his British citizenship, making him a dual citizen.

==Post-playing career==
Deng has been credited with helping develop South Sudan&#x27;s basketball presence and their rise on the international stage. In November 2019, he was appointed for four years as president of the South Sudan Basketball Federation (SSBF). On 24 November 2020, it was reported that Deng would coach the South Sudan national team in the FIBA AfroBasket 2021 qualifiers. As of 2023, he served as an assistant coach for the South Sudan national team and as president of the South Sudan Basketball Federation. For his efforts with the SSBF, Deng was likened to Jerry West by &quot;Slam&quot;.

==Personal life==
Deng is involved in numerous charities, such as the UK children&#x27;s charity School Home Support. He has been noted for his work on behalf of the Lost Boys of Sudan and other refugees. During the summers of 2006 and 2007, he went to Africa, Asia and Europe with the NBA for their Basketball Without Borders tour. He is also a spokesperson for the World Food Programme. &quot;He really does epitomize everything I had hoped for as a person and a basketball player&quot;, general manager John Paxson said. &quot;I think it&#x27;s one of the reasons we&#x27;ve gotten to the level we&#x27;re at this year. I&#x27;m truly proud of him. I think the world of him as a person and as a player.&quot;

Deng is a fan of Premier League&#x27;s side Arsenal F.C.

Deng was the cover athlete for &quot;NBA Live 09&quot; and &quot;NBA Live 10&quot; video games in the United Kingdom.

Deng&#x27;s cousin, Peter Jok, is a professional basketball player.

Deng has invested in real estate almost since the time he entered the NBA in 2004. In 2020, Deng was included in the annual &quot;Powerlist&quot; as one of the most influential people in the United Kingdom of African/African–Caribbean descent.

In 2010, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by Loughborough University.

Deng is depicted on one of the Brixton Pound&#x27;s community currency notes.

<text>Maharashtra State Highway 42, commonly referred to as Ghodbunder Road or G.B. Road, runs entirely through the district of Thane. It is one of the major roads leading out of Thane city and connects to the Eastern Express Highway coming from south at Kapurbawdi, which joins National Highway 3 at this junction from North-East. It also connects to the Western Express Highway coming from south at Ghodbunder village, which later joins National Highway 8 at this junction traveling Northwards towards Gujarat.

==General information==
Maharashtra State Highway 42 is approximately 20 km long and links the two main arterial roads of Mumbai, the Eastern Express Highway and the Western Express Highway. It connects to Eastern Express Highway at Kapurbawdi village and Western Express Highway at Ghodbunder village. The Kapurbawdi bridge has been constructed to ease the traffic congestion. This highway is tolled by the MSRDC. This road skirts the northern boundary of Salsette Island providing scenic views of the Yeoor hills and the Thane creek.
Ghodbunder Road cuts across dense forests which form part of the Sanjay Gandhi National Park. It also skirts the Vasai Creek for most of its route and overlooks the forest from across the creek. In spite of development encroaching on the forest, much of flora and fauna continue to survive and prosper. Ghodbunder Road is lined with numerous historical monuments like the Ghodbunder Fort. Naglakot, Gaimukh Gadi and Firangkot, which although damaged now, unfolds stories of the 1500 century era reign of the Portuguese.

This road once played a crucial role in Indo-Arab trade and later the Portuguese used it to monopolise sea routes in the Arabian Sea, at one point acted as a bridge between distant cultures. Several empires fought wars to control it. The Persian horses that came from the Arab countries used to land in the port (bunder) at the west end of this road. Hence, it initially came to be known as Ghodegaon (horse village). Around the time of Chhatrapati Shivaji, the road was renamed as Ghodbunder Road after the port.

Locals say that till 1950, it was only a dirt road with residents of centuries old villages like Waghbil, Majhiwada, Patlipada, Ghodbunder, Kolshet and Kasarwadavli using bullock carts for transport. The surrounding forests had considerable plants like cashew, mangoes that were brought in by the Portuguese. The area was very rich in flora and fauna.

==Mumbai Metro Line 4 (Upcoming) ==
Green Line 4 of the Mumbai Metro, currently under construction, is part of the metro system for the city of Mumbai, India and is being developed by MMRDA and a consortium of international companies.

The line is planned to be fully elevated, and is expected to consist of 32 stations from Wadala, Mumbai to Kasarvadavali via Ghatkopar, Mulund. It is estimated to cost (). Its construction was expected to begin by June 2018.

It is expected to be completed in 2022 and is expected to provide interconnectivity among the existing Eastern Express Highway, Central Railway, Mono Rail, the ongoing Metro Line 2B (D N Nagar to Mandale), and the proposed Metro Line 5 (Thane to Kalyan), Metro Line 6 (Swami Samarth Nagar to Vikhroli) and Metro Line 11 (Wadala to CSMT). It will provide rail based access to the commercial, government bodies and geographical landmarks in Mumbai. It will reduce the current travel time by between 50% and 75% depending on road conditions.

<doc id="1335744" wikidata="Q7828830" url="?curid=1335744" title="Toughman Contest">
<text>The Toughman Contest, founded in 1979 in Bay City, Michigan, by late boxing promoter Art Dore (1936–2022), is a chance for the novice amateur boxers (those with no more than five sanctioned wins in the past five years) to test themselves in the ring.

==Format==
Toughman Contest formats vary from state to state and are configured to each particular state’s rules and regulations. The most common format prescribes the use of standard amateur boxing rules, 16 ounces for each glove, protective headgear, and bouts made of 3 rounds of boxing. Each round is 2 minutes with a 60-second rest period or interval for men and 1 minute rounds with 1 minute or 45-second intervals for women.

The Original Toughman Contest plays across the US in between 75 and 100 cities each year and culminates with the World Championship. Toughman Contest tournaments feature the local residents of a particular city (generally, participants must live within 100–150 mile radius of where the event is to be held). Contestants must be at least 18 years of age, pass a standard boxing physical, and meet any other requirements of the state&#x27;s boxing commission&#x27;s regulations, and also sign a waiver freeing the parent company from liability. Some states, like Florida and Missouri, do not sanction the Toughman Contest and other amateur boxing contests unless it is under the rules and regulations of the USAAB.

==History==
The Toughman Contest was started in 1979 by Art Dore and Dean Oswald in Bay City, Michigan. Dore and Oswald wanted to prove how tough they were and opened it up to their friends determine who was the toughest. The Toughman Contest spread quickly. In its heyday, Toughman Contests were held at Las Vegas Casinos and broadcast live on multiple networks. Fox and the FX aired weekly Toughman Contest shows from 2000 to 2004 featuring Matt Vasgersian and Lawrence Taylor as commentators. At its peak, 135 Toughman shows were conducted around the US in 2001.

After 2001 Toughman was revived in West Virginia by Jerry Thomas.

Toughman Contest is the most widely attended boxing series in the United States in the last three decades. Dozens of Toughman contests continue be held as annual events in West Virginia, Ohio, and Oklahoma.

==In culture==
The 1983 film &quot;Tough Enough&quot;, starring Dennis Quaid, features a Toughman Contest. Dore served as a technical advisor and inspired the character played by Warren Oates.

In 1995, Toughman licensed a video game for the Sega Genesis called &quot;Toughman Contest&quot;.

==Deaths and controversy==
In 2003, Toughman faced public scrutiny following the death of Stacy Young in a &quot;Toughwoman&quot; bout staged as part of a Toughman competition in Sarasota, Florida. Young was a last-minute entry and faced Sara Kobie in the ring. Kobie&#x27;s hits on Young led to Young&#x27;s death from brain injuries. Young&#x27;s family sued the Toughman company. The following year, Florida enacted the Stacy Young Act into law, requiring such competitions be sanctioned by the Florida State Boxing Commission. A 2007 review of boxing deaths documented six fatalities in &quot;Original Toughman&quot; competitions since 1979, and another ten in &quot;Toughman-style&quot; bouts.

==Notable competitors==
* Arnold Mackey Toughman Champion at the Jackson Sports Arena Jackson, Michigan. 1981
* Eric &quot;Butterbean&quot; Esch

<doc id="1335749" wikidata="Q2906534" url="?curid=1335749" title="Rocket Rods">
<text>Rocket Rods was a high-speed thrill attraction located in Tomorrowland at Disneyland, Anaheim, California. The ride was themed around a hypothetical “drag race” of the future, as well as a futuristic rapid transit system. The ride opened in May 1998, utilizing the existing PeopleMover track and infrastructure as part of the New Tomorrowland refurbishment project. Plagued from its inception with technical problems and mechanical repairs, Rocket Rods was shut down indefinitely for renovations in September 2000; ultimately, the ride would be fully shut down, as confirmed via an official press release in April 2001, after two years of sporadic operations. While Rocket Rods&#x27; queue was replaced with the &quot;Toy Story&quot;-themed dark ride &quot;Buzz Lightyear&#x27;s Astro Blasters&quot; in 2005, the majority of the track infrastructure utilized by both the attraction and its predecessor still sit, visibly derelict, throughout Tomorrowland as of 2024.

==History==

In the 1990s, Disneyland wanted to refurbish the Tomorrowland section as part of the &quot;Disney Decade&quot;, started by Michael Eisner. This project was originally called Tomorrowland 2055.&quot; Mission to Mars&quot; was planned to be replaced by &quot;ExtraTERRORestrial Alien Encounter&quot;. Also proposed to join Tomorrowland 2055 was &quot;The Timekeeper&quot;, which was set to take over &quot;Circle-Vision 360°&quot;; another attraction, &quot;Plectu&#x27;s Fantastic Intergalactic Revue&quot;, a musical stage show, was to take place where &quot;America Sings&quot; was previously located. Unfortunately, Tomorrowland 2055’s plans were cancelled following the underwhelming opening figures—and negative public reception—of Euro Disney (known today as Disneyland Paris). Instead of a complete overhaul, Tomorrowland instead saw some updates to a few of its attractions, and a golden-bronze color scheme was given to the once bright, all-white land. One of the attractions to be shuttered was the PeopleMover, which would close on August 21, 1995.

In early 1996, Disneyland announced that Tomorrowland would be remodeled with a variety of new attractions, including &quot;Honey, I Shrunk the Audience&quot;, Rocket Rods and &quot;Innoventions&quot;. Rocket Rods was set to be the area&#x27;s star attraction. It would take over the former PeopleMover, with construction beginning in 1997.

Rocket Rods opened on May 22, 1998 as part of the New Tomorrowland. The high-speed attraction ran on a renovated PeopleMover track and riders entered the attraction through the former Circle-Vision 360° building at the front of Tomorrowland.

The ride was met with mixed reception from guests, as some enjoyed the thrilling acceleration and speed, but others felt it lacked the thrills of a true thrill ride while going too fast to be enjoyable for sightseeing. Rocket Rods was also operating sporadically due to constant downtime and mechanical problems. Guests would have to wait in line for over three hours, as there were intermittent closures. Disney could not convince a corporate sponsor to provide funding for a big budget and entertaining pre-show. At that point, the company was still facing financial issues following the “disastrous” grand opening of Disneyland Paris in 1992. To save on costs, Disney chose not to modify the original PeopleMover track with banked turns, which would have aided in higher speeds being possible. Instead, the ride would accelerate on the straight sections of track and abruptly decelerate as the cars approached a tight, flat-grade turn. The original PeopleMover was able to traverse these turns smoothly as it did not travel more than seven miles per hour. However, the original support structure was not designed for the much greater speed and weight of Rocket Rods’ ride vehicles, causing the structure to weaken. The cars’ tires were worn down at a quick rate, resulting in damaged engines. The constant changes of speed in the ride often caused malfunctions. In addition, the computer system would shut the attraction down if it wasn&#x27;t in the correct position, leading to frequent downtime for breakdowns, evacuations, reboots and maintenance.

On July 6, 1998, just a little over a month after its grand opening, Rocket Rods was closed for a refurbishment to address the issues. It was reported to remain closed for five weeks, but it ended up staying closed for three months before reopening in October 1998.

On August 29, 2000, Disneyland announced that Rocket Rods would close again on September 25 for a refurbishment that was to last until the spring of 2001, but no work was ever seen on the attraction. On April 27, 2001, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; and &quot;The Orange County Register&quot; reported that Rocket Rods would never reopen.

The queue building is now used for Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters. Most of the Rocket Rods vehicles were scrapped after the closure, but it is unknown exactly how many were kept. One vehicle was placed in front of the Hollywood &amp; Dine restaurant at Disney California Adventure where it remained for a few months. It was gone by the spring of 2002. Another vehicle ended up in the collection of Richard Kraft, and was listed for auction in late August 2018.

==Ride experience==
===Queue===

The queue for Rocket Rods was located in the former CircleVision 360° theater which housed America the Beautiful and Wonders of China. In the first room, large blueprints of old and current Tomorrowland attractions adorned the walls, along with former Tomorrowland attraction vehicles, which were repainted blue with an orange grid to mimic a blueprint appearance. Four PeopleMover cars, two rockets from Rocket Jets, a Space Mountain rocket, and the front of a Mark III Disneyland Monorail were included in the queue of the ride. Near the end of the room was a video screen that displayed Walt Disney animated segments from the 1950s to the 1970s, which featured Walt&#x27;s ideas of future transportation. All of the segments featured what many consider far-fetched or nearly impossible concepts of future transportation systems, such as fully automated and auto-guided mobile homes and cars using anti-gravity or magnetic devices to scale walls and objects. Each segment concluded with a short narrated segment explaining how these technologies evolved into forms of technology used in 1998, or expected to be used in the future. The short narrations brought insight to the animated segments and explained to guests that &quot;in the world of creativity there&#x27;s no end to the possibilities&quot; (the theme of the ride itself.)

The next room of the queue was the original nine-screen Circle-Vision 360° theater, where guests watched transportation videos, excerpts from the Circle-Vision 360° films &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; and &quot;The Timekeeper&quot; put between a Walt Disney narrated video, and a video depicting the evolution of General Motors cars. Guests then continued through the &quot;transit tunnel&quot; (formerly a backstage area) where guests passed &quot;proposals&quot; for extending the Rocket Rods system to the nearest commercial airport, John Wayne Airport and other nearby destinations. The Transit Tunnel led to a series of stairs that circled around the inside of the tower that held the Rocket Rods platform and the Observatron (the former location of the Rocket Jets attraction.) The stairs led guests to the elevated Rocket Rods station in the center of Tomorrowland.

In the queue area, near the stairway to the boarding area was a fictional map titled &quot;Rocket Rods Proposed System Expansion&quot;, showing guests where Rocket Rods was to expand in the future. The map was for fun, and had no actual locations on it (as well as ambiguous ones), including Tomorrowland attractions already bypassed by the Rocket Rods route, such as:

*Star Tours
*Space Mountain
*Innoventions
*Disney California Adventure
*Disneyland Resort Hotels
*Edison International Field
*Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim
*Walt Disney Studios, Burbank
*Los Angeles neighborhood Hollywood
*John Wayne Airport
*The beach
*The mountains

===Layout===
Guests boarded an unusual 5-seat Rocket Rod before moving forward to a staging area similar to one used for drag racing. In front of the riders were lights changing from red, to yellow, to green, a charging sound effect was heard and the vehicles would then zoom down a straightaway toward the entrance of Tomorrowland, before quickly decelerating at the curve in the track. When the attraction was first opened, the straightaway was used for a small wheelie as well. During the development phase, Disney was unable to obtain sponsors to aid in the funding of the attraction after Euro Disney&#x27;s failure; thus, the turns were not banked, requiring sudden deceleration followed by acceleration. The ride traversed the building housing Star Tours. R2-D2&#x27;s beeping noise could be heard as the ride zoomed through the queue line. Along with Star Tours, guests also went past the &quot;Star Trader&quot; gift shop and the Starcade, offering views of all three through glass panes in the tunnel. Segments of the tunnel were entirely opaque, and one turn used a mirror to create the effect of nearly colliding with another oncoming ride vehicle. Afterwards, the Rocket Rod took guests into Space Mountain, during which the riders could catch a brief glimpse of the ride. The vehicle then took riders outside again before entering the Carousel Theater, home of Innoventions. Due to the long, slightly curved nature of this stretch of track, the Rocket Rods were able to accelerate to a comparatively high speed here. After leaving the other side of Innoventions, another charging sound effect was heard and the vehicle took riders to the next area. Guests zoomed through a series of turns and dips above Autopia and the Submarine Voyage, which closed only a few months after the opening of Rocket Rods. A variety of street sounds could be heard in this portion, including cars and honking horns. Finally, the vehicle passed next to the Disneyland Monorail station before entering the Rocket Rods queue building, where a strobe light flashed and a blast of air shot out at the riders. The vehicle then traveled along the straightaway from the first leg of the ride back to the station.

Rocket Rods was the first Disneyland attraction to house a Single Rider line due to its long lines and limited capacity.

===Music===

The evolution of GM cars video featured an electronic version of the Steppenwolf hit &quot;Born to Be Wild&quot;, arranged and recorded by former Oingo Boingo member Steve Bartek.

In addition to the re-arranged version of &quot;Born to Be Wild,&quot; the attraction featured its own theme song: &quot;World of Creativity (Magic Highways of Tomorrow)&quot; also arranged and performed by Steve Bartek. The song, originally known as &quot;Detroit&quot; from the 1967 Disney film &quot;The Happiest Millionaire&quot;, was composed by Robert and Richard Sherman.

<text>Creed Bane Taylor V (May 13, 1929 – August 22, 2022) was an American record producer, best known for his work with CTI Records, which he founded in 1967. His career also included periods at Bethlehem Records, ABC-Paramount Records (including its jazz label, Impulse!), Verve, and A&amp;M Records. In the 1960s, he signed bossa nova artists from Brazil to record in the US including Antonio Carlos Jobim, Eumir Deodato, João Gilberto, Astrud Gilberto, and Airto Moreira.

==Biography==
===Early work===
Taylor was born in Lynchburg, Virginia, and spent his childhood in Pearisburg, Virginia, where he played trumpet in the high school marching band and symphony orchestra. Although he grew up surrounded by country music and bluegrass, he gravitated more toward the sounds of jazz, citing Dizzy Gillespie as a source of inspiration during his high school years. Taylor recalls spending many evenings beside a small radio, listening to Symphony Sid&#x27;s live broadcasts from Birdland in New York City.

After high school, Taylor completed an undergraduate degree in psychology from Duke University in 1951 while actively performing with the student jazz ensembles the Duke Ambassadors and the Five Dukes. Taylor credits Duke&#x27;s strong tradition of student-led jazz ensembles, and Les Brown&#x27;s association with Duke in particular, as initially drawing him to the university. As he recalls, &quot;The reason I went to Duke was from hearing Les Brown and all the history of the bands who went through Duke. This was really a great jazz band, . . . and the book was handed down from one class to the next, you had to audition and all the best players who came to Duke got in the band. . . . I had a ball when I was there.&quot; After graduating from Duke, Taylor spent two years in the Marines before returning to Duke for a year of graduate study.

===The Bethlehem years===
Shortly thereafter, Taylor relocated to New York City in order to pursue his dream of becoming a record producer. Although he had no formal training in record production, he recalls that his &quot;mix of naivete and positive thinking&quot; convinced him that he could succeed. After arriving in NYC, Taylor approached another Duke University alum who was running Bethlehem Records. Taylor persuaded the label to allow him to record the vocalist Chris Connor with the trio of pianist Ellis Larkins. Due in part to the album&#x27;s success, Taylor became head of artists and repertoire for Bethlehem, where he remained during its two most significant years, recording such artists as Oscar Pettiford, Ruby Braff, Carmen McRae, Charles Mingus, Herbie Mann, Charlie Shavers, and the J.J. Johnson-Kai Winding Quintet.

===The ABC-Paramount years===
In 1956 Taylor left Bethlehem to join ABC-Paramount, where, four years later, he founded the subsidiary label Impulse!. Motivated by the idea of a label dedicated to tasteful, current jazz, Taylor worked with ABC-Paramount executive Harry Levine to advocate for the label, which he dubbed &quot;The New Wave in Jazz&quot;. It was Taylor who signed John Coltrane to Impulse!, rather than Coltrane&#x27;s better known producer at the label, Bob Thiele. Taylor&#x27;s accomplishments during this period also included gaining immediate credibility for the label by releasing successful gate-fold albums by Ray Charles, Gil Evans, J.J. Johnson and Kai Winding, and Oliver Nelson. Taylor was sensitive to the importance of album cover design to visually attract people to the music, and he regularly hired photographers Pete Turner and Arnold Newman to create cover images. Taylor&#x27;s successful Impulse! albums regularly blurred the genre-based lines between jazz and popular music, and his superb production values became the hallmark of the label.

=== The Verve years ===
Although he signed John Coltrane for Impulse! in 1960, Taylor left the following year to accept a job with Verve Records. There he prominently introduced bossa nova to the US through recordings such as “The Girl from Ipanema” with Antonio Carlos Jobim and Stan Getz. As Taylor recalls, &quot;I went down to Brazil a few times and spent some time at Jobim&#x27;s house and met all the players down there. Then of course after “Desafinado” became a hit, Jobim wanted to come up and see what New York was like, so he came in to see me right off the bat. That started a long friendship and series of albums.&quot;

As Gene Lees puts it: &quot;Creed Taylor was treating [bossa nova] with respect and dignity. Were it not for Creed Taylor, I am convinced, bossa nova and Brazilian music generally would have retreated into itself, gone back to Brazil . . . and become a quaint parochial phenomenon interesting to tourists, instead of the worldwide music and the tremendous influence on jazz itself that it in fact became.&quot;

According to Lees, in &quot;Singers and the Song II&quot;, however, Getz asked Taylor to ensure that singer Astrud Gilberto was paid no royalties on “The Girl from Ipanema” single, which went on to sell more than five million copies. It became one of the most covered songs in the history of pop music.

While at Verve, Taylor also produced recordings by Wes Montgomery, Jimmy Smith, Bill Evans, Cal Tjader, and others.

===Later years===
In 2009, Taylor toured Europe with the CTI All Stars band. The first concert at the Montreux Jazz Festival was recorded and filmed for a CD/DVD/Blu-ray release, &quot;CTI All Stars At Montreux 2009&quot;, featuring Hubert Laws, Airto Moreira, Flora Purim, Randy Brecker, John McLaughlin, George Duke, Mark Egan, and special guest Jamie Cullum. The album was engineered by Rudy Van Gelder with cover art by Pete Turner. That same year, Taylor himself produced, for the first time, an extensive CTI reissue series on SHM-CD format, &quot;The CTI + RVG&quot; series, working for the last time with Van Gelder.

In 2010, Taylor once again put together the CTI All Stars for another tour, this time with Bryan Lynch replacing Randy Brecker. A video was filmed at the Burghausen Festival and was broadcast on German TV.

==Awards==
Albums and tracks produced by Creed Taylor have won 12-Grammy awards. 8-tracks Taylor produced are Grammy Hall of Fame Inductees. However, Taylor himself has not been officially recognized by the Recording Academy. This is primarily because producers were not officially recognized by the Recording Academy until 1974. The last of Taylor&#x27;s productions to win an award was in 1976, for George Benson &quot;Theme From Good King Bad&quot;, which won Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Instrumental Performance.

For his decades of production work numerous awards and nominations were made, these include awards for: &quot;Focus&quot; (Stan Getz, 1961), &quot;Desafinado&quot; (Stan Getz/Charlie Byrd, 1962), &quot;Conversations with Myself&quot; (Bill Evans, 1963), &quot;The Girl from Ipanema&quot; (Stan Getz/Joao Gilberto, 1964), &quot;Willow Weep for Me&quot; (Wes Montgomery, 1969), and &quot;First Light&quot; (Freddie Hubbard, 1972).

==Death==
Taylor died on August 22, 2022, at the age of 93. Taylor had been visiting family in Winkelhaid, Germany, where he suffered a stroke on August 2. He was taken to hospital in nearby Nuremberg, where he died.

<text>David John Ian Dunn (born 27 December 1979) is an English former professional football player, manager and coach.

Dunn played as an attacking midfielder and spent the majority of his playing career representing Blackburn Rovers. His first stint began as a youth team player in 1997, and he signed professional terms a year later. During this time, Dunn helped the club to win promotion out of the First Division in 2000–01, as well as lift the League Cup the following season. He also made his only appearance for England in 2002. He was sold to Premier League rivals Birmingham City for £5.5 million a year later before returning to Blackburn in 2007 for a fee of £2.2 million; continuing as a crucial squad member. He remained there until 2015, with them now a Championship club, when he signed for Oldham Athletic, his final club as a player before his retirement under a year later.

He was player-manager at Oldham between September 2015 and January 2016 and then Blackburn&#x27;s under-23s and first-team assistant coach. In 2020, he was a coach and briefly caretaker manager at Blackpool, and had five months as manager of Barrow.

==Early life==
David John Ian Dunn was born on 27 December 1979 in Great Harwood, Lancashire. Dunn joined Blackburn Rovers as a schoolboy. After leaving St Augustine&#x27;s School, Billington, he was taken on the Youth Training Scheme upon joining the club, which is just down the road from the club&#x27;s Brockhall training ground. Dunn reflected on his school life, saying: &quot;I wasn&#x27;t very academic. I was bored in the classroom. It never really excited me and it was never something I really wanted to do. I went to a good school – St Augustine&#x27;s in Billington. &quot;I didn&#x27;t wag school or anything like that.&quot;

Growing up, Dunn wanted to be a footballer because of the influence from his grandfather, David, who was a footballer himself and was a Blackburn Rovers fan, along with his family. Growing up, he idolised Simon Garner. In addition to playing football, Dunn also played cricket.

==Club career==
===Blackburn Rovers===
Dunn joined Blackburn Rovers as a trainee at the beginning of 1997 and quickly impressed the reserve team. His first goal for Blackburn Rovers&#x27; Reserves came on 3 February 1997. Dunn then played in both legs of the FA Youth Cup semi–finals, as Blackburn Rovers Academy lost 4–3 on aggregate. Nevertheless, he was part of the squad that saw Blackburn Rovers Youth win 3–0 against Everton Youth in a penalty shoot-out following a 1–1 draw after extra-time. However, in the final of the Lancashire FA Youth Cup, they lost 3–1 against Manchester United Youth. The following season, Dunn played in both legs of the FA Youth Cup, as they lost 5–3 on aggregate against Everton Youth.

The start of the 1998–99 season saw Dunn being called up to the first-team squad by manager Roy Hodgson. He made his debut during a goalless draw with Everton on 26 September 1998. Dunn came off the bench after 70 minutes but was taken off after just 11 minutes on the pitch, due to the sending off of Martin Dahlin. After making his debut, he said: &quot;I am not a nervous person so it doesn&#x27;t really bother me. I am just glad to be playing. It&#x27;s exciting and a brilliant experience. I was just happy to go on no matter how long it was for. It was a surprise to come off but it had to be done for the team. The gaffer explained to me why he did it afterwards and I agree with him.&quot; In his second appearance, Blackburn beat Newcastle United at St James&#x27; Park in the League Cup; Dunn scored the winning penalty in the shoot-out. The end of the year saw Dunn being linked a move away from Blackburn Rovers, as Preston North End wanted to sign him on loan. But it was announced on 12 December that he signed a contract with the club, keeping him until 2003. His first goal came in a 3–1 victory against Aston Villa on 6 February. Throughout the 1998–99 season, he had received a handful of first-team appearances for the club. At the end of the 1998–99 season, Dunn made sixteen appearances and scored one goal in all competitions.

Ahead of the 1999–2000 season, it was expected that Dunn was to fight for his first-team place in the central midfield position. He began the season when he appeared in a number of matches, either starting a match and coming on as a substitute, without able to play the whole game for the side. On 22 September, Dunn scored his first goal of the season, in a 3–1 win against Portsmouth in the second round of the League Cup. Dunn then spend the next two months playing for the reserve side, though he did return to the first-team once, coming against Leeds United in the third round of the League Cup. On 6 November, Dunn returned to the first-team, where he started a match and played 83 minutes before being substituted, in a 2–2 draw against Ipswich Town. Dunn started in the next two matches before he returned to the reserve side for a month until on 28 December 1999 against Portsmouth, starting the whole game, winning 2–1. Dunn then regained his first-team place for the rest of the 1999–2000 season. His lack of first-eam opportunities led him to a transfer request, only to be rejected by Blackburn Rovers. He later withdrew the transfer request a month later. Dunn then scored two goals in two matches between 18 March and 22 March against Fulham and Birmingham City. Despite suffering injuries during the 1999–2000 season, Dunn made twenty–six appearances and scored three times in all competitions.

At the start of the 2000–01 season, Dunn became a first-team regular, establishing himself in the starting eleven and playing midfield. On 26 August, he scored his first goal of the season, in a 3–2 win against Norwich City. This was followed up when Blackburn entertained Rochdale in the League Cup, where Dunn scored a hat-trick from the penalty spot. He then scored in the next two matches, against Nottingham Forest and Watford. Two weeks later on 26 September, Dunn scored his seventh goal of the season, in a 1–1 draw against Portsmouth. He reached double figures in terms of goals in 2000 after scoring five more goals, including a brace against Crystal Palace on 22 December. Along the way, Dunn was suspended on three occasions. After his performances attracted interests from top division clubs, Blackburn Rovers began open talks with him over a new contract. It was announced on 14 February that he signed a four-year contract extension, keeping him at the club until 2005. During the same month, Dunn added three more goals in February, including scoring against Bolton Wanderers in two separate matches. His performances throughout February earned him the Young Player of the Month award. He then scored three goals throughout April and then helped Blackburn achieve promotion back to the Premier League for the first time since 1999. At the end of the 2000–01 season, Dunn made fifty–two appearances and scored eighteen times in all competitions (although he stated in his column on Lancashire Telegraph that he aimed to score twenty goals). For his performance, Dunn was named PFA Team of the Year.

Ahead of the 2001–02 season, Dunn was linked a move away from Blackburn Rovers, but the club&#x27;s chairman John Williams refused to sell him. He started in the opening game of the season against Derby County but was substituted at half-time following a challenge, as Blackburn Rovers lost 2–1. Having previously sustained a knee while on international duty, Dunn was sidelined for six weeks. On 30 September, he returned to the starting line–up and played 81 minutes before being substituted, in a 2–1 loss against Aston Villa. Dunn starred in Rovers&#x27; return to the Premier League, putting in a string of impressive performances, notably in their 7–1 win over West Ham United and a 3–3 draw at Arsenal, where he scored two goals, one a last minute equaliser. Following these two matches, local newspaper &quot;The Lancashire Telegraph&quot; praised Dunn&#x27;s performance. He later reflected on his performance on his column for the Lancashire Telegraph. Since returning from injury, Dunn continued his good form in the season and regained his place in the midfield position. He then scored two goals in two matches between 15 December and 22 December against Newcastle United and Charlton Athletic. Dunn was sidelined with a calf injury during a 2–1 loss against Manchester United on 19 January. After being sidelined for three weeks, he returned to the starting line–up and played the whole game, as Blackburn Rovers lost 2–0 against Fulham on 9 February. Dunn then started in the League Cup final against Tottenham Hotspur, as he helped the side win 2–1 to win the trophy at the Millennium Stadium. Dunn scored his sixth goal of the season, in a 3–0 win against Aston Villa on 5 March. A week later, however, he suffered a rib injury and was substituted in the 34th minute, as Blackburn Rovers lost 3–1 against Leeds United. Dunn did not return to the first-team until on 1 April against Southampton and played 53 minutes before being substituted, as they won 2–0. Following his return, he started in the last six league matches, including scoring his seventh goal of the season, in a 3–1 win against Middlesbrough on 20 April. At the end of the 2001–02 season, Dunn made thirty–four appearances and scored seven times in all competitions.

Ahead of the 2002–03 season, Dunn, once again, was linked a move away from Blackburn Rovers, as Premier League clubs continued to declare their interests in signing him. He started the season well, scoring two goals in two separate weeks against Liverpool and Chelsea. Both of these matches saw him earn praises from &quot;The Lancashire Telegraph&quot;. Since the start of the 2002–03 season, Dunn continued to regain his first-team place in the midfield position and was in good form. He then made his UEFA Cup debut against CSKA Sofia and played in both legs, as Blackburn Rovers went through away goal following a 4–4 draw on aggregate. After suffering a hamstring injury during a 2–1 loss against Tottenham Hotspur on 6 October, Dunn returned to the starting line–up and scored twice for the side, in a 5–2 win against Newcastle United on 19 October. However, loss of form combined with his injury concerns did not help his cause and he fell out with then-Blackburn manager Graeme Souness. It was speculated the previous January that the pair fell out. Although Dunn was hurt over the situation leading up to his departure, he later said he did not have a grudge against Souness. Dunn then scored two goals in two matches between 22 February and 1 March against Chelsea and Manchester City. Despite suffering injuries along the way, he continued to regain his first-team place and then added two more goals later in the 2003–04 season. At the end of the season, Dunn made thirty–five appearances and scored eight times in all competitions.

Subsequently, Dunn was ready to move on to another club in the summer. He even turned down a contract extension from Blackburn Rovers, further doubting his stay at the club. Blackburn initially rejected offers from a number of clubs, but Birmingham City&#x27;s revised bid of £5.5 million was accepted, and Dunn moved to the West Midlands in time for the start of the 2003–04 season. Dunn later said that he regretted leaving Blackburn Rovers for Birmingham City. During his time in his first spell at Blackburn Rovers, Dunn was at one time dubbed &quot;the New Gazza&quot;, a testament to his flair and technical ability.

===Birmingham City===
After signing a four-year contract, Dunn impressively made an impact in the club&#x27;s friendly matches, scoring three times before suffering a muscle injury against Walsall, which he recovered from. Dunn&#x27;s Birmingham City career started brightly with a debut goal in a 1–0 victory over Tottenham Hotspur on 16 August 2003. After the match, Manager Steve Bruce praised his performance, saying: &quot;David Dunn proved he had some real, real quality with the spotlight on him and such a big crowd. He&#x27;s rushed to get the ball (for the penalty). He&#x27;s got something about him and he&#x27;s a special player.&quot; Two weeks later on 30 August, Dunn scored his second goal of the season, in a 1–0 win against Newcastle United. During a 0–0 draw against local rivals, Aston Villa on 19 October, he attempted to do the Rabona pass, only for it to backfire. Dunn later spoke about his embarrassing incident on numerous occasions. Since the start of the 2003–04 season, he started in every match until a niggling hamstring sustained in February meant that Dunn spent much of the second half of his first season on the side-line. At the end of the 2003–04 season, Dunn made twenty–two appearances and scored two times in all competitions.

The beginning of his second season saw Dunn continuing to recover from his injury. It was not until on 18 September 2004 when he returned to the first-team, coming on as a 61st-minute substitute, in a 1–1 draw against Charlton Athletic. Dunn quickly re-established himself in the heart of the Birmingham midfield and chipped in some vital goals despite suffering from injury along the way. However, a recurrence of Dunn&#x27;s hamstring problems in November limited him to just a handful of performances for the remainder of the season, and kept him out of the side until midway through the following season. At one point, he thought about retiring from football because of the injury. At the end of the 2004-05 season, Dunn made twenty–eight appearances and scored two times in all competitions.

The 2005–06 season saw Dunn continuing rehabilitating from his hamstring injury. It was not until on 16 October when he returned to the first-team, coming on as a 67th-minute substitute, in a 1–0 loss against rivals Aston Villa. However, Dunn&#x27;s return was short–lived when he suffered a calf injury while training and was sidelined for a month. Ultimately, Birmingham were relegated from the Premier League, with Dunn still not returning to fitness. Amidst injuries, he went on to score three goals during the season, coming against Portsmouth, Reading and Wigan Athletic. At the end of the 2005–06 season, Dunn made nineteen appearances and scoring three times in all competitions.

Ahead of the 2006–07 season, Dunn returned to training and spent the whole pre-season regaining his fitness. He made his first appearance of the season, starting the whole game, in a 2–1 win against Colchester United in the opening game of the season. Since the start of the 2006–07 season, Dunn quickly became a first-team regular, playing in the midfield position. He then scored his first goal of the season, in a 2–2 draw against Ipswich Town on 16 September 2006. However, Dunn was plagued with injuries throughout the first half of the season. Amid to injuries, he was linked with a return to Blackburn in the upcoming transfer window in November, as Bruce said his departure from Birmingham City could be imminent. By the time he left the club, Dunn made eleven appearances and scored once in all competitions.

===Return to Blackburn Rovers===
On 17 January 2007, Dunn returned to Blackburn Rovers for an undisclosed fee on a three-and-a-half-year deal believed to be £2.2 million. He rejected a move to Bolton Wanderers in favour of returning to his boyhood club. On 3 February, Dunn played his first Premier League match since his return to Blackburn Rovers against Sheffield United and earned a free kick which led to Rovers scoring a last-minute winner. After the match, he said: &quot;It was good to be back out there again – it felt like I&#x27;d never been away. I was really touched by the reception I got from the fans – it was special for me.&quot; Dunn then played a role in the FA Cup fifth round replay against Arsenal when he set up a goal for Benni McCarthy to score the only goal of the game to advance to the next round. At the end of this campaign, despite injury problems, he managed to feature in a total of 16 games in all competitions, including appearing in 11 Premier League matches.

Dunn started the 2007–08 season well, scoring in a 1–1 draw against Arsenal. Manager Mark Hughes praised Dunn&#x27;s performance after the match. Since the start of the 2007–08 season, Dunn&#x27;s place in the midfield position proved to be resurrection of his football career. He then set up two goals in two matches between 7 October and 20 October against his former club Birmingham City and Reading. Dunn started in every match since the start of the 2007–08 season until he was sent off for a second bookable offence, in a 2–0 loss against Manchester United. After serving a one match suspension, Dunn returned to the starting line–up against Aston Villa on 28 November, where they lost 4–0. He then provided a hat–trick of assists, as Blackburn Rovers won 4–1 against Bolton Wanderers on 24 February. At one point during a 2–1 loss against West Ham United, he was involved in altercation with teammate Christopher Samba after conceding the equalising and the argument carried on in the dressing room at half-time. Despite being sidelined on four more occasions later in the 2007–08 season, Dunn made thirty–eight appearances and scored once in all competitions. For his performances, he won the Special Club Award at Blackburn Rovers&#x27; annual Player of the Year awards.

Ahead of the 2008–09 season, Dunn was appointed vice-captain by new manager Paul Ince for the new season. He started the season well, scoring in the opening game of the season, in a 3–2 win against Everton. However, his 200th league appearance for Blackburn Rovers against Hull City on 23 August was overshadowed when he suffered an Achilles injury and was substituted at half-time. It was announced that Dunn was out for four months. By November, Dunn made his return to training to maintain his fitness, as he continued to recover from his injury. It was not until on 12 December when Dunn returned from injury, coming on as a second-half substitute, in a 3–0 loss against Wigan Athletic.

At the end of the 2008–09 season, Dunn made seventeen appearances and scored once in all competitions.

Ahead of the 2009–10 season, Dunn was linked to a move away from Blackburn Rovers, with Sunderland interested in signing him, but the move did not materialise. He was featured in the club&#x27;s pre-season matches before suffering a thigh injury that saw him miss the start of the 2009–10 season. Despite missing the first two games of the 2009–10 season Dunn returned in the League Cup clash against Gillingham and scored on his return in a 3–1 win in the second round making Rovers progress to the third round of the tournament. He then hit top form for Rovers, scoring first goals in the Premier League including strikes against Wolverhampton Wanderers, Aston Villa, Arsenal, Bolton Wanderers and a memorable equaliser against local rivals Burnley at Ewood Park. Since returning from injury, Dunn regained his first-team place, playing in the midfield position for the next two months. However, Dunn was plagued with injuries that sidelined him for the next three months, though he did return around January. While sidelined, it was announced on 26 January, with Dunn&#x27;s contract expiring at Rovers, he signed a new two-and-a-half-year contract to keep him with the club until at least July 2012. His contract talks started in August 2008 but it was delayed following his injuries.

On 21 February 2010, Dunn returned to the first-team, coming on as an 87th-minute substitute, in a 3–0 win. He made his 260th appearance for Blackburn Rovers in a home fixture with Chelsea at Ewood Park in a 1–1 draw on 21 March, playing for 56 minutes before being replaced by Australian international Brett Emerton. In a follow–up match, he scored twice against Birmingham City on 24 March in a 2–1 victory at Ewood Park, one in front of the Darwen End in the 5th-minute with him shooting with his left foot right in the corner of the goal and the other goal came on 67 minutes with a well-timed header from a corner taken by winger El Hadji Diouf from the left by line, and he celebrated in front of the Walkersteel Blackburn End with all the Rovers supporters, and received a yellow card for going into the crowd. Four days later on 28 March, Dunn scored the winning goal from the penalty spot against rivals Burnley at Turf Moor. Since returning from injury, he regained his first-team place for the rest of the 2009–10 season. Two months later on 3 May, Dunn scored his tenth goal of the season, in a 2–1 win against Arsenal. At the end of the 2009–10 season, he made twenty–four appearances and scored ten times in all competitions, making him the club&#x27;s top scorer this season. His performance in the 2009–10 season earned him the most Man of the Matches awards.

At the start of the 2010–11 season, Dunn featured in two matches for the club. However, he suffered a thigh injury while playing for the club&#x27;s reserves and was sidelined for a month. On 18 October, Dunn returned to the first-team from injury, coming on as a 64th-minute substitute, in a 0–0 draw against Sunderland. Since returning from injury, he was involved in the first-team for the next three months. On 4 December, Dunn scored his first goal of the 2010–11 season against Wolverhampton Wanderers with a close range header. On 2 February 2011, in the match against Tottenham Hotspur at Ewood Park, he made his 100th Premier League appearance since returning to the club for a second spell which ended in a disappointing 1–0 defeat. Three days later on 5 February, he came on for Brett Emerton in the 60th-minute with Rovers down 3–2 against Wigan Athletic at the DW Stadium, he netted a penalty kick in the 81st-minute but could not prevent them from losing 4–3. However, Dunn suffered a groin injury while training and was sidelined for the rest of March. On 2 April, he returned to the first-team, coming on as a late substitute, in a 0–0 draw against Arsenal. Dunn then started in the next three matches before suffering a calf injury during a match against Manchester City on 25 April. Following Blackburn Rovers&#x27; survival in the Premier League, he called on the players to improve in the league next season. At the end of the 2010–11 season, Dunn went on to make twenty–seven appearances and scored two times in all competitions.

Ahead of the 2012–13 season, Dunn believed the club&#x27;s main priority was to aim for promotion back to the Premier League. After being featured for the first two league matches of the season, Dunn then found himself placed on the substitute bench, as well as, his own injury concern. In a match against Sheffield Wednesday on 24 October, he started and set up the club&#x27;s only goal of the game before suffering a calf injury in the 34th-minute and was substituted, as they won 1–0.

However, Dunn suffered a knee injury that kept him out for a month. On 9 November, he returned to the first-team, coming on as a 63rd-minute substitute, in a 3–0 win against Brighton &amp; Hove Albion.

Dunn was released by Blackburn following the end of his contract on 1 July 2014, but re-signed for the club on 11 July of the same year.

At the start of the 2014–15 season, Dunn made his first appearance of the season, where he started and played 62 minutes before being substituted in a 1–0 loss against Scunthorpe United in the first round of the League Cup. However, Dunn suffered a minor knock that eventually kept him out for the month. On 21 October, he returned to the first-team, coming on as a 66th-minute substitute, in a 1–0 win against Birmingham City. However, Dunn found his first-team opportunities limited throughout the 2014–15 season. On 27 April, Dunn announced he would be departing Blackburn Rovers at the end of the season, ending his combined time of thirteen years.

==International career==
Dunn represented England at international level and was first called up to the England U18 squad for the first time and made his debut for the U18 squad on 12 February 1998. He was then a part of their squad for the 1998 UEFA European Championship in Cyprus, where they were eliminated in the Group Stage.

In November 1998, Dunn was called up to the Under-21 squad for the first time. He made his debut on 18 November 1998.

Dunn was called up for the UEFA European Under-21 Championship and played three times, as they finished last in their group.

Throughout 2001, there were calls from the British media that Dunn should be called up to the England squad. On his column for the Lancashire Telegraph, he wrote positively about Sven-Göran Eriksson&#x27;s early managerial start at England. Dunn was considered to be in the England squad for the FIFA World Cup, but he did not make the final cut. Three months later, on 3 September 2002, Dunn was called up to the England for the first time and made his first cap on 7 September 2002, when he replaced Steven Gerrard against Portugal at half-time. This turned out to be his only senior England appearance. Following this, there were calls for England to call Dunn to the squad, but to no avail, as he said: &quot;I know that I should&#x27;ve had more caps. I truly wish that I&#x27;d knuckled down at times and pushed myself that bit more. I&#x27;m really proud that I played professionally for my country, it&#x27;s what I started out wanting to do but there&#x27;s always that little bugbear that I could and maybe should&#x27;ve had more caps.&quot;

== Coaching career ==

=== Oldham Athletic ===
On 13 September 2015, following the sacking of Darren Kelly, Dunn was appointed as the caretaker manager of his playing club Oldham Athletic, with him supposed to remain in that position until a permanent replacement was found. At the time of his appointment, he was working on completing his UEFA Pro Licence, having previously completed his UEFA A and B Licences. On 7 October, Dunn was appointed permanently, following a recent unbeaten run. His first game in charge as their permanent manager came three days later in a 4–2 defeat to Scunthorpe United at Boundary Park. His first victory was a 2–1 victory at Swindon Town on 20 October 2015.

His tenure as manager did not go according to plan: Oldham entered into a relegation battle after a negative run of results which resulted in Dunn being dismissed on 12 January 2016, just three months after his appointment. Oldham had gone several league games without a win. Dunn&#x27;s departure also led to the exits of Dean Holden and Keith Brown, who were both members of Dunn&#x27;s coaching staff. He left the club sat in twenty-second place, with Dunn being replaced by heavily experienced John Sheridan a day later.

On 25 February 2016, Dunn returned to his former playing club Blackburn Rovers to work alongside his former teammate Damien Johnson in the academy set-up as the under-23s assistant coach. His appointment as coach saw Dunn hang up his boots after an 18-year-spell as a professional footballer. On 22 February 2017, Dunn was promoted to first-team coach under new manager Tony Mowbray. Dunn remained in that role until the end of the season; he reverted to his previous position after Blackburn were relegated to League One. A successful season followed for Blackburn: the under-23s (which Dunn coached with Johnson) won the Premier League 2 Division 2, earning promotion to Division 1; whereas the first-team achieved immediate promotion back to the Championship as runners-up. Dunn departed Blackburn for the third time in June 2018, in order to concentrate on his family and other business interests outside of football.

=== Blackpool ===
In January 2020, Dunn joined League One side Blackpool as an assistant coach. On 12 February, Dunn was installed as the club&#x27;s caretaker manager until further notice, following the dismissal of Simon Grayson, who was sacked after a negative run of form. His first game in charge was 2–1 defeat in the league, away at Bristol Rovers, taking place three days following his appointment. However, Blackpool went on to record a respectable run of form, including a goalless draw against AFC Wimbledon, before achieving 2–1 victories whilst hosting Bolton Wanderers and promotion-chasing Ipswich Town at Bloomfield Road, respectively.

Neil Critchley, a highly acclaimed coach who had previously been employed by Premier League giants Liverpool as their under-23s team manager, was appointed as Grayson&#x27;s replacement on 2 March. Following his appointment, Critchley stated that he was satisfied with the existing coaching staff, with Dunn confirming two days later that he intended to remain in his previous role as an assistant coach, with all four members of the coaching staff being on the touchline for the club&#x27;s reserves fixture against Huddersfield Town one day previously.

=== Barrow ===
In July 2020, Dunn became linked with the vacant managerial position at Barrow, whose previous manager Ian Evatt had recently departed to join Bolton Wanderers just shortly after guiding the club to promotion into the English Football League. On 9 July, his appointment at the club was confirmed, after he signed a two-year contract. This became Dunn&#x27;s first permanent managerial position since his tenure at Oldham Athletic concluded in 2016. After 22 matches, the last nine without a win, and with the team 21st in the table, Dunn was sacked on 13 December 2020.

=== Port Vale ===
In July 2022, he joined Port Vale as a first-team coach. He left the club following the sacking of Andy Crosby in February 2024.

==Personal life==
Dunn was in a relationship with actress Sammy Winward; the couple were once engaged and had a daughter named Mia. Dunn has three children with his wife, Hayley. The oldest, Isaac, was born in 2008.

During his first spell at Blackburn Rovers, Dunn wrote a column for the &quot;Lancashire Telegraph&quot;, and was known as a prankster. He later went onto business with former teammate Garry Flitcroft, running a timber firm named Flitcraft.

<text>Car Nicobar ( in Car language) is the northernmost of the Nicobar Islands. It is also one of three local administrative divisions of the Indian district of Nicobar, part of the Indian union territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
Annual rainfall is 2800 millimetres.

==History==
The sea farers of the region referred to the island as the &quot;northern land of the nake&quot; i.e. Car Nakkavar which is perhaps the direct predecessor of the current name Car Nicobar. 

===2004 tsunami devastation===
The island was severely affected by the tsunami that was caused by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, which led to many deaths and damaged infrastructure. Car Nicobar lies from the epicenter of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, and the ensuing tsunamis struck it with great force. Witnesses reported the waves were as high as 30 ft (9 m). As of December 30, 2004, the number of casualties remained unknown, but were estimated to be high. One survivor told the Associated Press: &quot;There&#x27;s not a single hut which is standing. Everything is gone. Most of the people have gone away from the shore and Indian govt has made many relief programmes here such as temporary shelters, subsidize their every primary needs etc.&quot;

==Geography==
Car Nicobar falls in between Little Andaman and Nancowry. The area south to the Ten-degree channel comes under Car Nicobar headquarters. Car Nicobar is remarkably flat except for some cliffs in the north and small hilly areas in the interior. It is bordered by a silvery beach and areas of flat ground consisting of coraline diluvium. It is a flat fertile island covered with clusters of coconut palms and enchanting beaches with a roaring sea all around.

Compared to the Middle Andaman and South Andaman, Car Nicobar is a small island, having only .

The soil analysis revealed a high content of sand &amp; clay hindering the growth of agricultural crops. The area of Car Nicobar is suitable for the plantation crops, and coconut and areca nut are the major products, which are grown in the area.

===Climate===
The climate of Car Nicobar Island is a tropical monsoon climate (Koppen: Am), as it is just 9 degree from the equator, with an annual rainfall of 400 mm. The data of past ten years shows that the mean relative humidity in the Island is 79%, the mean maximum temperature is of 30.20 C, and mean minimum temperature is 23.00 C.

The official pin code of Car Nicobar is 744301.

Although the area of Car Nicobar is less than 7% of the area of the Nicobar group, in the census of 2011 its population of 17841 was 48% of the total population of Nicobar.

==Flora and fauna==
The Car Nicobar islands do not have any evergreen forests, which dominate the central and southern islands of the Nicobars. Most of the island is covered with coconut plantation and natural flora is present only in the interior areas.

===Important Bird Area===
The island has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports populations of various restricted-range or threatened bird species. These include Nicobar sparrowhawks, Nicobar serpent-eagles, Andaman wood pigeons, Andaman cuckoo-doves, Andaman boobooks, white-headed starlings and Nicobar green imperial pigeons.

<text>LeDroit Park ( or ) is a neighborhood in Washington, D.C. located immediately southeast of Howard University. Its borders include Florida Avenue NW, Bryant Street NW, Georgia Avenue NW, and 2nd Street NW .LeDroit Park is known for its history and 19th century protected architecture. The community&#x27;s diversity entices new residents to the community, as well as its close proximity to the Shaw–Howard University Metro station and many dining options.

==History==
The neighborhood was founded in 1873 by Amzi Barber, a businessman who served on the board of trustees of neighboring Howard University. Barber named the neighborhood after his father-in-law, LeDroict Langdon, but dropped the ⟨c⟩.

As one of the first suburbs of Washington, LeDroit Park was developed and marketed as a &quot;romantic&quot; neighborhood with narrow tree-lined streets that bore the same names as the trees that shaded them, differing from the street names used in the rest of the city. Extensive focus was placed on the landscaping of this neighborhood, as developers spent a large sum of money to plant flower beds and trees to attract high-profile professionals from the city. Originally a whites-only neighborhood, LeDroit Park was even gated with guards to promote security for its residents. Efforts by many, especially multiple actions by students from Howard University, led to the integration of the area. Between 1886 and 1891, what newspapers called a &quot;fence war&quot; between LeDroit Park residents and &quot;intruders&quot; seeking a corridor from Howard Town to downtown unfolded. &quot;With the opening of the streets, the park soon lost its former characteristics and became a part of the city with all its advantages and disadvantages.&quot;

By the 1940s, LeDroit Park became a major focal point for the African-American elite as many prominent figures resided there. Griffith Stadium, the home of the Washington Redskins and Washington Senators was also located here until 1965, when the Howard University Hospital was built where it used to stand. Le Droit Park includes Anna J. Cooper Circle, named for the education pioneer.

===Historic District===
Today, the neighborhood&#x27;s historic value is officially recognized as the LeDroit Park Historic District. The historic district includes the Mary Church Terrell House, a U.S. National Historic Landmark. The neighborhood was awarded a place on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.

===Heritage Trail===
On October 17, 2015, the LeDroit Park Heritage Trail was opened by Cultural Tourism DC. Featuring 16 signs, the 90-minute walking tour chronicles the history of the neighborhood and its residents. The Trail begins where Florida Avenue, 6th and T Streets, NW meet at the &quot;gateway&quot; to LeDroit Park.

== Architecture ==

One of LeDroit Park&#x27;s more recognizable features is its Victorian mansions, houses and row-houses, designed by architect James McGill. None of the original 64 homes McGill designed in LeDroit Park were identical and most were built between 1873 and 1877. Today, 50 of the original homes remain. McGill was also a member of the LeDroit Park Property Owners Association, a precursor to the LeDroit Park Civic Association, which is active today. LeDroit&#x27;s protected housing stock includes 12 different styles of homes.

==Public spaces and art==

When the Gage-Eckington School Elementary School closed, residents successfully lobbied the city to tear it down and convert it into a park, which opened in 2011 as The Park at LeDroit. The park houses a large playground, a dog park and the Common Good City Farm, an urban agriculture education center and community garden with 40 plots. In May 2011, His Royal Highness Prince Charles of Wales visited the Common Good City Farm.

Murals are painted on many walls throughout the neighborhood. &quot;This Is How We Live&quot; was commissioned by the DC Commission on the Arts &amp; Humanities to be painted by artist Garin Baker. The mural shows the African-American heritage of the neighborhood, the changing community and landscape and historical and architectural scenes from the past and present. At the dedication on December 13, 2008, Mayor Adrian M. Fenty is quoted as describing the mural as serving to

... visually engage residents through a beautiful neighborhood mural that depicts the unique landscapes, people and images of the historic LeDroit Park community. The mural will become a prominent landmark in the neighborhood for years to come.

<text>Ain&#x27;t Nobody&#x27;s Business if You Do: The Absurdity of Consensual Crimes in Our Free Country is a 1993 book by Peter McWilliams, in which he presents the history of legislation against what he feels are victimless crimes, or crimes that are committed consensually, as well as arguments for their legalization.

The book is divided into five sections.
*Part I gives a definition of victimless and consensual crime and outlines the difference between personal morality and governmentally-imposed morality.
*Part II presents arguments against the criminalization of victimless crimes.
*Part III gives a closer look into some of the individual activities which the author classifies as consensual crimes, such as prostitution and marijuana use, but which the majority of criminologists would classify as victimless.
*Part IV gives historical examples of the treatment of consensual and victimless crimes, such as Prohibition, and Biblical examples.
*Part V advises readers on what to do to change the laws.
Throughout the book are approximately six hundred quotations by noted thinkers on both sides of his positions (primarily supporters).

McWilliams presents a variety of arguments against the criminalization of victimless crimes. Some are philosophical in nature: one argument is that laws against these crimes are based in religion, which violates the separation of church and state. He also claims that they are un-American, as they attempt to homogenize the country to a certain group&#x27;s idea of morality, and that they create an oppressive society, restricting personal freedoms without justification. Another claim is that they teach irresponsibility, by not letting people deal with the natural consequences of their actions, but rather penalizing them whether or not their actions harmed anyone else.

Other objections are practical: catching the &quot;criminals&quot; involved is an expensive affair. Victimless crimes draw manpower and funds away from crimes that do hurt innocent parties, and enforcement of the laws is not consistent enough to be an effective deterrent. He also argues that actions to help people deal with problems caused by these illegal activities are effectively prevented by their criminalization—for example, no one could be helped with their drinking problems during Prohibition. Additionally, he details how laws against victimless crimes paved the way for organized crime.

Activities examined in detail in Part III include gambling, recreational drug use, medical marijuana, prostitution, homosexuality, pornography, indecent exposure, and seat belt legislation.

Until a few years after McWilliams&#x27;s death, the text of this book (as well as McWilliams&#x27; other books) was available for free in its entirety through his archived website; though all the books have been removed from that site in favor of links to online retail vendors, the texts have been archived in various formats by others.

<text>Jack Kapp (born Jacob Kaplitzky; June 15, 1901 – March 25, 1949) was a record company executive with Brunswick Records who founded the American Decca Records in 1934, along with British Decca founder Edward Lewis, and later American Decca head Milton Rackmil. Kapp oversaw Bing Crosby&#x27;s rise to success as a recording artist in the early 1930s, and, four decades later, Crosby still gave appreciation to Kapp for diversifying his song catalogue into various styles and genres, saying, &quot;I thought he was crazy, but I just did what he told me.&quot; Kapp could not read or sing music, but to his talent he stressed the credo, &quot;Where&#x27;s the melody?&quot;

==Biography==
He was born in Chicago, Illinois to a Jewish family of immigrants from Russia. His father, Myer Kaplitzky, was a distributor for Columbia Records in 1905 and the founder of the Imperial Talking Machine Shop in Chicago. Kapp worked at the store after high school, and was known for having memorized the catalog numbers of every record in the inventory as well as the addresses and phone numbers of his father&#x27;s best customers. After marrying his childhood sweetheart Frieda Lutz in 1922, he opened the Kapp Record Store with his younger brother, Dave Kapp. In 1926, Kapp joined Brunswick Records and was put in charge of their &quot;race&quot; label (Brunswick 7000 and Vocalion Records 1000 series), where he scouted, signed or produced artists including, King Oliver, Jelly Roll Morton, Pinetop Smith, Leroy Carr, Frankie Jaxon, and Cow Cow Davenport, among others.

Kapp also worked with artists on the Brunswick label; it was over the company&#x27;s objection that he had Al Jolson record &quot;Sonny Boy&quot;, which became a huge success for Jolson. The artists signed by Kapp included Crosby, Cab Calloway, the Mills Brothers, the Boswell Sisters, and Mildred Bailey. Kapp sold Brunswick&#x27;s British franchises to stockbroker Edward R. Lewis, who owned the English Decca Company. Two years later, when a deal to buy Columbia Records fell through, the pair instead started Decca Records. Crosby&#x27;s deal with Brunswick had an escape clause that allowed him to follow Kapp to the new company. Other artists followed, including the Mills Brothers, Boswell Sisters, Earl Hines, Ted Lewis, Isham Jones and the Dorsey Brothers. Kapp also signed new performers such as Chick Webb, Art Tatum, Jimmie Lunceford, Ethel Waters, and a year after the company&#x27;s founding, Louis Armstrong. Dave Kapp was instrumental in building the company&#x27;s extensive hillbilly catalogue, allowing Decca to corner the market on country music for years.

Record sales had plunged during the Depression, and Kapp decided that Decca discs would sell for 50 cents instead of the usual 75 cents to a dollar. When Brunswick shifted its back catalogue to a 25-cent subsidiary label in an effort to sink the fledgling company, Kapp further reduced the price to 35 cents per disc. Crucially, he also pursued the then-new jukebox market. In 1938, Decca began releasing record sleeves with cover artwork; other innovations such as liner notes and Broadway cast albums followed (although Jack Kapp pioneered this practice in 1933 by recording the entire &quot;Blackbirds of 1928&quot; and &quot;Showboat&quot; scores and issuing them in album sets). By 1939, the company was on its feet; 18 million of the 50 million records sold in the United States that year were issued by Decca.

Jack Kapp died in New York City, of a cerebral hemorrhage in 1949 at the age of 47. After his death, his brother Dave Kapp took over American Decca. Dave Kapp later founded Kapp Records, based in New York.

<doc id="1335791" wikidata="Q1104585" url="?curid=1335791" title="Cobb salad">
<text>The Cobb salad is an American garden salad typically made with chopped salad greens (authentically romaine lettuce), tomato, bacon, chicken breast, hard-boiled eggs, avocado, chives, blue cheese (often Roquefort; some versions use other cheeses such as cheddar or Monterey Jack, or no cheese at all) and red wine vinaigrette. The ingredients are laid out on a plate in neat rows. It is served as a main course.

==Origin==
Various stories recount how the salad was invented. One says that it came about in 1937 at the Hollywood Brown Derby restaurant, where it became a signature dish. It is named after the restaurant&#x27;s owner, Robert Howard Cobb. Stories vary whether the salad was invented by Cobb or by his chef, Paul J. Posti. The legend is that Cobb had not eaten until near midnight, and so he mixed together leftovers he found in the kitchen, along with some bacon cooked by the line cook, and tossed it with their French dressing.

Another version of the creation is that Robert Kreis, executive chef at the restaurant, created the salad in 1929 (the year the Brown Derby&#x27;s Hollywood location opened) and named it in honor of Cobb. The same source confirms that 1937 was the reported date of the version noted above, with Cobb making the salad.

<text>Elizabeth Despenser (died 10 April/11 April 1408) was an English noblewoman of the late 14th century. She should not be confused with Elizabeth le Despenser, Baroness Berkeley, who was her great-aunt and who was the daughter of her great-grandmother, Eleanor de Clare. She was the daughter of Sir Edward le Despencer, 1st Baron le Despencer, by Lady Elizabeth Burghersh, daughter and heiress of Bartholomew de Burghersh, 2nd Baron Burghersh.

==First marriage==
She married Sir John FitzAlan, 2nd Baron Arundel. They had three sons and one daughter:
* John de Arundel, Lord Maltravers, and Lord Arundel.
* Thomas FitzAlan.
* Edward/Edmund Arundel.
* Margaret (married to William de Ros, 6th Baron de Ros)

Sir John de Arundel, 2nd Baron Arundel, died on 14 August 1390, and was buried at Missenden Abbey, Buckinghamshire.

==Second marriage==
Elizabeth married secondly, apparently after 28 April 1393 (as his second wife), William la Zouche, 3rd Baron Zouche of Haryngworth (d. 13 May 1396). They had no children. Her will requested burial at Tewkesbury Abbey, Gloucestershire.

<doc id="1335820" wikidata="Q1394363" url="?curid=1335820" title="Inhaler">
<text>An inhaler (puffer, asthma pump or allergy spray) is a medical device used for delivering medicines into the lungs through the work of a person&#x27;s breathing. This allows medicines to be delivered to and absorbed in the lungs, which provides the ability for targeted medical treatment to this specific region of the body, as well as a reduction in the side effects of oral medications. There are a wide variety of inhalers, and they are commonly used to treat numerous medical conditions with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) being among the most notable.

Some of the common types of inhalers include metered-dose inhalers, dry powder inhalers, soft mist inhalers, and nebulizers. Each device has advantages and disadvantages and can be selected based on individually specific patient needs, as well as age, pathological conditions, coordination, and lung function. Proper education on inhaler use is important to ensure that inhaled medication creates its proper effects in the lungs. Using a spacer can ensure that more medicine reaches the lungs, thus providing the most optimal treatment.

==Medical uses==
Inhalers are designed to deliver medication directly to the lungs through a person&#x27;s own breathing. This may benefit a patient by providing medicines directly to areas of disease, allowing medication to take a greater effect on its intended target, and limit side effects of medications when administered locally. Inhalers are used in a variety of different medical conditions with diseases of the lungs and respiratory system being among the most common. Individuals with these diseases/conditions need medications designed to decrease airway inflammation and obstruction to allow for easier and comfortable breathing. Antibiotic medications have even been developed for inhalers to allow for direct delivery to areas of infection within the lungs. Two of the most common conditions that warrant inhaler therapy are asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

===Asthma===

Asthma is a condition of intermittent airway obstruction due to inflammatory processes in the lungs. Inhaled medications are used to calm down the inflammation present in the lungs and allow for relief of the airway obstruction. Common inhaled medications used for treatment of asthma include long term inhalational steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (most commonly inhaled corticosteroids, also called ICS) and fast-relieving bronchodilators such as salbutamol (known commonly as &quot;Ventolin&quot;) and salmeterol. These medications allow for patients to have relief of airway obstruction symptoms and reduced inflammation. If some people are unable to use inhalers, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may be used, but with caution since they may cause immunological hypersensitivity to NSAIDs, resulting in respiratory-related symptoms such as bronchospasms, acute asthma exacerbation, and severe asthma morbidity.

===Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)===

COPD is an obstructive lung disease due to long-term damage to the airways of the lungs. The long-term damage leads to the inability of the airways to open properly, causing airway obstruction. Inhaled medications allow patients to see improvement in symptoms and better function of daily living. Some commonly used inhaled medications in patient&#x27;s with COPD are ipratroprium, salmeterol, and corticosteroids. Inhalers that combine two or three different medications including inhaled corticosteroids, long-active muscarinic medications (LAMA) and long acting beta2 agonists (LABA) for treating COPD may be associated with improvements in some quality of life variables and small improvements in lung function and respiratory symptoms, however, may also be associated with an increase in the risk of pneumonia.

==Types of inhalers==
===Meter-dosed inhaler (MDI)===
The most common type of inhaler is the pressurized metered-dose inhaler (MDI) which is made up of 3 standard components- a metal canister, plastic actuator, and a metering valve. The medication is typically stored in solution in a pressurized canister that contains a propellant or suspension. The MDI canister is attached to a plastic, hand-operated actuator. On activation, the metered-dose inhaler releases a fixed dose of medication in aerosol form through the actuator and into a patient&#x27;s lungs. These devices require significant coordination as a person must discharge the medication at or near the same time that they inhale in order for the medication to be effective.

===Dry powder inhaler (DPI)===

Dry powder inhalers release a metered or device-measured dose of powdered medication that is inhaled through a DPI device. This device usually contains a chamber in which the powdered medication is deposited prior to each dosage. The powder can then be inhaled with a quick breath. This allows for medication to be delivered to the lungs without the need for use of propellant/suspension.

===Soft mist inhaler (SMI)===
Soft mist inhalers release a light mist containing medication without the need for a propellant/suspension. Upon pressing a button, the inhaler creates a mist of medication, allowing for inhalation into the lungs. SMIs suspend inhaled medications for roughly 1.2 seconds, which is longer than the average MDI inhaler suspension time period. This requires less coordination when using and may be helpful for young patients or patients that find the MDI inhalers difficult to use.

===Nebulizer===

Nebulizers are designed to deliver medications over an extended period of time over multiple breaths through a mouthpiece or face mask. They generate a continuous mist with aerosolized medication, allowing a patient to breathe normally and receive medications. They are commonly used in infants and toddlers requiring inhaled medications or in patients in the hospital who require inhaled medications.

===Smart inhaler===
The smart-inhaler is an inhaler that will automatically update an app with information that includes the time of day, air quality, and how many times it has been used through sensor technology on the device. The first smart-inhaler was approved in 2019 by the FDA, its purpose is to track patient use of the device and some other circumstantial factors that could affect the effectiveness of the dosage. This information is sent via Bluetooth to a mobile device app, and is later shared with their physician to determine what kind of things can trigger issues with asthma and other problems. This technology presents a great way to cut down on medical costs associated with asthma and also help patients better manage their condition with fewer emergencies.

The Teva ProAir Digihaler was the first FDA approved smart inhaler. It shows how effective the device is at aiding patients in using the proper dose amount for their asthma. In a study published by the European Respiratory Journal, the ProAir Digihaler accurately identified when patients were using their inhalers and whether they were effectively administering the dose in a 370 patient trial with the device. This study further gives an overview on the technology regarding applications and devices that help aid in the tracking and medication management for asthma and other lung conditions. Another study showed that smart inhalers accurately recorded all doses administered by patients with their technology, which signifies their importance in providing accurate dosage information to patients and their physicians.

==Propellants==
In 2009, the FDA banned the use of inhalers that use chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) as propellants. In their place, inhalers now use hydrofluoroalkane (HFA). HFA is not environmentally inert as it is a greenhouse gas but it does not affect the ozone layer. While some people with asthma and advocacy groups contend that HFA inhalers are not as effective, published clinical studies indicate CFC and HFA inhalers are equally effective in controlling asthma.

While the impact of CFCs from inhalers on the ozone layer had been minuscule (dwarfed by industrial processes using CFCs), the FDA in its interpretation of the Montreal Protocol mandated the switch in propellants. Patients expressed concern about the high price of the HFA inhalers as there were initially no generic versions, whereas generic CFC inhalers had been available.

==Proper use==

It is important to use proper techniques when administering medications through inhalers.

Proper use of inhalers often involves initial deep breathing (which involves mostly the diaphragm&#x27;s movements), and then rapid breathing (which involves most of the muscles of respiration, such as external and internal intercostal muscles) during intake of one or more puffs from the inhalers.

Improper use of inhalers is very common, can lead to distribution of the medicine into the mouth or throat where it cannot create its desired effect and may cause harm. Education on the correct use of inhalers for delivery of medications is a commonly cited topic in medical studies and a great deal of thought has been put into how best to help people learn to use their inhalers effectively. Below is a description of proper inhaler technique for each different type of inhaler as well as a helpful video explaining what the text states.

===Meter-dosed inhalers===

# The mouthpiece is removed and the inhaler is shaken for 5–10 seconds.
# The inhaler is gripped with mouthpiece on the bottom and canister on top. A finger is placed on the canister to allow for delivery of medicine.
# Deep inhalation is done until no more air can be taken into the lungs. 
# Deep exhalation is done until most of the air is out of the lungs.
# Once deep exhalation is done, mouth is placed over mouthpiece.
# As the next deep inhalation begins, the canister is pressed down to release the medicine into the lungs.
# Slow deep breathing is continued and breath is held for 5–10 seconds, keeping the medicine in the lungs for a longer time period and preventing escape of aerosolized form of the medicine.
# Complete exhalation is done again. If multiple puffs of the medicine have to be taken, steps 1–5 are repeated after waiting for 15–30 seconds.
# Mouthpiece is replaced.

===With spacer===
Spacer is placed at the mouthpiece of a meter-dosed inhaler while keeping mouth at the end of the spacer. After pressing the canister of the inhaler, the medicine will linger inside the spacer, allowing for the user of the inhaler to directly absorb medicine into their lungs. Deep breathing is done to be ready for the delivery of the medicine to the lungs; this minimizes need for coordination of breathing with inhaler activation. Cleanage of the spacer regularly with warm soapy water is recommended.

===Dry powder inhalers===
# Inhaler medication chamber is prepared (this will be different based on the type of inhaler but will involve preparing and opening the chamber with the medication)
# The inhaler is held with the chamber pointing towards the patient and complete exhalation is done with their head turned away from the inhaler.
# Mouth is placed over the chamber and a quick, deep breath is taken allowing medication to dispense in the lungs.
# Breath is held for 5–10 seconds and then slow exhalation is done.
# After waiting for a few minutes, steps 1-4 are repeated if another dose is needed.

===Soft mist inhalers===
# The inhaler is primed by loading the cartridge and discharging the inhaler until a fine mist is visible (more explanation in the video).
# Once complete exhalation is done, mouth is placed around the mouthpiece while leaving space for the small holes on the side of the mouthpiece.
# Slow inhalation is done while simultaneously pressing the button to release the medication.
# Breath is held for 5–10 seconds.
# Slow exhalation is done and steps 1-4 are repeated if another dose of medication is required after waiting for a few minutes.

If inhaler is used everyday, the inhaler usually has to be primed the first time using a new cartridge, but it may need to be primed again if it has not been used in multiple days.

===After use===

If using inhaled corticosteroids, one should wash the mouth out directly after use of an inhaler. This helps to prevent mouth infections that can occur due to immunosuppressant effects of corticosteroids.

===Nebulizer===
# Mouth is placed over mouthpiece or face mask is placed over nose and mouth
# The nebulizer machine is turned on.
# Normal breathing is done for 10-20 min (or time allotted for treatment).
# Machine is turned off and face mask/mouthpiece remove is removed.

==Price and availability==

In the United States, pharmaceutical manufacturers use legal and regulatory strategies to keep inhaler prices artificially high. There has been little innovation in inhaler technology for decades the most recent drug to be approved by the FDA for treating asthma or COPD via a novel target of action was Ipratropium bromide in 1986. Since then, manufacturers have used small changes to drug delivery mechanisms, or have switched active ingredients from one inhaler device to another (a strategy known as a &quot;device hop&quot;) to keep patents active. This has the effect of limiting competition, keeping inhalers expensive. Because of high prices, patients sometimes skip doses or give up using their inhalers.

==History==
The idea of directly delivering medication into the lungs was based on ancient traditional cures that involved the use of aromatic and medicinal vapors. These did not involve any special devices beyond the apparatus used for burning or heating to produce fumes. Early inhalation devices included one devised by John Mudge in 1778. It had a pewter mug with a hole allowing attachment of a flexible tube. Mudge used it for the treatment of coughs using opium. These devices evolved with modifications by Wolfe, Mackenzie (1872) and better mouth attachments such as by Beigel in 1866. Many of these early inhalers needed heat to vaporize the active chemical ingredient. The benefits of forced expiration and inspiration to treat asthma were noted by J. S. Monell in 1865. Chemicals used in inhalers included ammonia, chlorine, iodine, tar, balsams, turpentine camphor and numerous others in combinations. Julius Mount Bleyer used a variation in 1890 in New York.
In 1968, Robert Wexler of Abbott Laboratories developed the Analgizer, a disposable inhaler that allowed the self-administration of methoxyflurane vapor in air for analgesia. The Analgizer consisted of a polyethylene cylinder 5 inches long and 1 inch in diameter with a 1 inch long mouthpiece. The device contained a rolled wick of polypropylene felt which held 15 milliliters of methoxyflurane.

Because of the simplicity of the Analgizer and the pharmacological characteristics of methoxyflurane, it was easy for patients to self-administer the drug and rapidly achieve a level of conscious analgesia which could be maintained and adjusted as necessary over a period of time lasting from a few minutes to several hours. The 15 milliliter supply of methoxyflurane would typically last for two to three hours, during which time the user would often be partly amnesic to the sense of pain; the device could be refilled if necessary.

The Analgizer was found to be safe, effective, and simple to administer in obstetric patients during childbirth, as well as for patients with bone fractures and joint dislocations, and for dressing changes on burn patients. When used for labor analgesia, the Analgizer allows labor to progress normally and with no apparent adverse effect on Apgar scores. All vital signs remain normal in obstetric patients, newborns, and injured patients. The Analgizer was widely utilized for analgesia and sedation until the early 1970s, in a manner that foreshadowed the patient-controlled analgesia infusion pumps of today. The Analgizer inhaler was withdrawn in 1974, but use of methoxyflurane as a sedative and analgesic continues in Australia and New Zealand in the form of the Penthrox inhaler.

<text>Stan Lazaridis (born 16 August 1972) is an Australian former soccer player. He was predominantly a left winger though he was known to perform at left-back. He notably played for Birmingham City and West Ham United and made 58 official appearances for Australia and was in the Australian 2006 FIFA World Cup squad.

In 2024, Lazaridis was appointed director of football at Perth Glory.

==Club career==
His reputation as a young left-footed teenager began with Olympic Kingsway where, despite his age, he intimidated many a defender with his change of pace.

Lazaridis made his senior debut for West Adelaide Hellas in the Australian National Soccer League in the 1992 season. His dribbling ability and pace drew much attention on the Australian scene. At the end of the 1995 season he earned a move to Europe when West Ham manager Harry Redknapp encountered Lazaridis playing for West Adelaide during West Ham&#x27;s pre-season tour of Australia in May, 1995. Signed for £300,000 a poor debut and consistent injury problems made his debut season difficult when he made only six appearances. He scored his first goal for West Ham in a 1–1 away draw with Wimbledon on 18 March 1997. Over four seasons, Lazaridis played just 87 games for West Ham United and scored three goals. In 1999, he dropped a division to sign for Birmingham City when manager Trevor Francis signed him in a deal worth an eventual £1.7million. Settling much better at St Andrew&#x27;s, he played an important role in guiding the team up to the Premiership for the 2002–03 season, scoring one of the penalties in the play-off final shootout to help them get promoted to the Premier League. While at Birmingham he played in the 2001 Football League Cup Final.

Following promotion (and despite a raft of new signings) Lazaridis remained a regular player for the Blues, scoring the winner against local rivals Aston Villa in March 2003 and a classic goal against Everton in February 2004. After seven successful years at Birmingham City, in which he had become a fan favourite, Lazaridis was released at the end of the 2005–06 season after making 222 appearances for the club. He then looked to finish his career in Australia with A-League club Perth Glory.

Lazaridis made only 11 appearances for the Perth club in 2006–07. His time there was tainted when in January 2007, Lazaridis returned a positive drug test for anti-androgen Finasteride, a prescription alopecia medication, which was banned at the time. Although perhaps slim comfort to Lazaridis finasteride was removed from the banned list in large measure as a result of the widespread discontent that followed his unfortunate case becoming public.

While noting his previous good character and making clear there was no evidence he had taken performance-enhancing drugs, he was found to have breached the rules and was given a 12-month suspension from football, mostly backdated. In March 2008, Perth Glory manager David Mitchell cut Lazaridis from the club&#x27;s A-League roster, prompting the player to retire.

==International career==
Lazridis made his debut appearance for the Australian National Team in 1993 as they played Kuwait. He has 60 international appearances for the Socceroos and has one goal which he scored against Cook Islands. He played a major role in 4 world cup campaigns and was in the Australian squad at the 2006 World Cup in Germany. Lazaridis was also part of the Australian squad at the 2000 Sydney Olympic games.

<text>Gaius Fabricius Luscinus, son of Gaius, was said to have been the first of the Fabricii to move to ancient Rome, his family originating from Aletrium.

In 284 BC he was one of the ambassadors to Tarentum, successfully keeping peace, and was elected consul in 282 BC where he saved the Greek city Thurii from the Lucanians. After the Romans were defeated by Pyrrhus at Heraclea, Fabricius negotiated peace terms with Pyrrhus and perhaps the ransom and exchange of prisoners; Plutarch reports that Pyrrhus was impressed by his inability to bribe Fabricius, and released the prisoners even without a ransom. Fabricius was consul a second time in 278 BC, and once again successful against the Samnites, Lucanians and Bruttians. He also defeated Tarentum&#x27;s army after Pyrrhus&#x27; departure from Italy to Sicily.

Fabricius was elected censor in 275 BC.

The tales of Fabricius are the standard ones of austerity and incorruptibility, similar to those told of Curius Dentatus, and Cicero often cites them together; it is difficult to make out a true personality behind the virtues. On the other hand, Valerius Maximus says that he and his co-consul/co-censor Quintus Aemilius Papus kept &quot;silver in the[ir] homes... Each of them had a dish for the gods and a salt cellar, but Fabricius was more elegant because he chose to put a little pedestal of horn under his dish.&quot; [Valerius Maximus, Chapter Four &quot;Poverty&quot; 4.3]

In the Purgatorio of Dante&#x27;s Divine Comedy, Canto XX depicted Fabricius as an example of virtue opposing Avarice, as the Pilgrim and Virgil trek through the realm of Purgatory, also galvanizing the connection between poverty and asceticism. They say his principles were so deeply embedded within his character that he suffered intense impoverishment, and that he died a pauper and had to be buried by the state. A quote wailed by a mysterious voice in Canto XX 24-27 reveals this: &quot;O Good Fabricius, you who chose to live with virtue in your poverty, rather than live in luxury with vice.&quot;

<text>Cynthia Jane Williams (August 22, 1947 – January 25, 2023) was an American actress. She is best known for her role as Shirley Feeney on the television sitcoms &quot;Happy Days&quot; (1975–1979), and &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot; (1976–1982). She also appeared in &quot;American Graffiti&quot; (1973), &quot;The Conversation&quot; (1974), &quot;Mr. Ricco&quot; (1975), and &quot;More American Graffiti&quot; (1979).

==Early life==
Williams was born in Van Nuys, Los Angeles on August 22, 1947. Her mother Cindy was a waitress and her father Beachard “Bill” Williams worked at an electronics manufacturing company. The family moved to Dallas when she was a year old and returned to Los Angeles when she was ten years old. She had a sister named Carol Ann.

Williams wrote and acted at a church during childhood and later acted in productions at Birmingham High School; she graduated in 1965, a year behind Sally Field. She attended Los Angeles City College where she majored in theater.

==Career==
After college, Williams began her professional career by landing national commercials, which included Foster Grant sunglasses and TWA. Her first roles in television, among others, were on &quot;Room 222&quot;, &quot;Nanny and the Professor&quot;, and &quot;Love, American Style&quot;.

Williams accompanied an actor-friend from Los Angeles City College who needed a scene partner for the audition and was also accepted at The Actors Studio West, but rarely attended due to acting commitments. Williams picked up important film roles early in her career: George Cukor&#x27;s &quot;Travels with My Aunt&quot; (1972); as Laurie Henderson, Ron Howard&#x27;s character&#x27;s high school sweetheart in George Lucas&#x27;s &quot;American Graffiti&quot; (1973) for which she earned a BAFTA nomination as Best Supporting Actress; and Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s &quot;The Conversation&quot; (1974). She auditioned along with thousands of others, for Lucas&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars&quot; for the role of Princess Leia, but Leia was ultimately played by Carrie Fisher because Lucas wished to cast unknowns, as in &quot;American Graffiti&quot;.

Williams met Penny Marshall, first on a double date, and later at Francis Ford Coppola’s Zoetrope company. The company hired them as comedy writers, because &quot;they wanted two women&quot; on a prospective TV spoof for the Bicentennial. While the two were writing for Zoetrope, Penny Marshall&#x27;s brother, Garry Marshall, called to ask if they would like to make an appearance on an episode of &quot;Happy Days&quot;, a television series he produced.

In 1975, Williams was cast as a fun-loving brewery bottle capper, Shirley Feeney, in an episode of &quot;Happy Days&quot; with Penny who played her best friend and roommate Laverne De Fazio. The girls were cast as &quot;sure-thing&quot; dates of Richie and Fonzie (Henry Winkler). Their appearance proved so popular that Garry Marshall commissioned a spin-off series for the characters of Shirley and Laverne. Williams continued her role on the very successful &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot; series from 1976 until 1982. At one point during its run, the series was the number one rated show on television. Williams was praised for her portrayal of Shirley Feeney. She left the show after the second episode of the show&#x27;s eighth and what would become its final season, after she became pregnant with her first child. The show&#x27;s various producers were not enthusiastic that Williams was pregnant. Williams and co-star Penny Marshall had also been feuding for quite some time on the set long before Williams became pregnant. (They would reconcile many years later.) The success of the TV series led to a short-lived Saturday morning animated series &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley in the Army&quot; (1981–82), created by Hanna-Barbera.

In 1979, she reprised her role of Laurie from &quot;American Graffiti&quot; in its sequel, &quot;More American Graffiti&quot;.

In 1985, Williams starred in the ABC sitcom pilot &quot;Joanna&quot;, which aired as a special on April 30 of that year. The premise involved Williams&#x27;s character, Joanna, following her boyfriend from Los Angeles to New York, though he leaves her for another woman. Joanna then decides to stay in New York, becoming the operations manager of a trucking company. The pilot was not picked up as a series. That same year, Williams starred in the sci-fi comedy &quot;UFOria&quot; alongside Fred Ward and Harry Dean Stanton, a movie which was already completed in 1981.

In 1990, Williams starred in an unsold pilot for CBS that was adapted from the 1989 film &quot;Steel Magnolias&quot;. Williams was cast as M&#x27;Lynn Eatenton, the role that was played by Sally Field in the film. Also in 1990, Williams returned to series TV in the short-lived sitcom &quot;Normal Life&quot; and, a couple of years later, reunited with former &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot; producers Thomas L. Miller and Robert L. Boyett to star in their family sitcom &quot;Getting By&quot; (1993–94). She guest-starred on several television shows, including two episodes of &quot;8 Simple Rules&quot;.

Williams performed onstage in the national tours of &quot;Grease, Deathtrap&quot;, and &quot;Moon Over Buffalo&quot; as well as a regional production of &quot;Nunsense&quot;. She reunited with her &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot; co-star Eddie Mekka in a November 2008 regional production of the Renée Taylor-Joseph Bologna comedy play &quot;It Had to Be You&quot;.

She made her Broadway debut as daffy Mrs. Tottendale in &quot;The Drowsy Chaperone&quot; at the Marquis Theatre on December 11, 2007, succeeding Jo Anne Worley in the role which was first played on Broadway by Georgia Engel.

Williams reunited with Penny Marshall on the TV series &quot;Sam &amp; Cat&quot; in the episode &quot;#SalmonCat&quot; (2013). In 2015, her memoir &quot;Shirley, I Jest!&quot; (co-written with Dave Smitherman) was published. In the same year, Williams engaged in celebrity branding for the home care service Visiting Angels.

==Personal life==
Williams married Bill Hudson of the musical trio The Hudson Brothers in 1982. They had two children, Emily and Zachary before divorcing in 2000.

Williams was a Roman Catholic.

==Death==
Williams died in Los Angeles on January 25, 2023, at age 75, following a brief illness.

Williams was interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Hollywood Hills, Los Angeles.

<text>Claude &quot;Claudius&quot; Crozet (December 31, 1789 – January 29, 1864) was a soldier, educator, and civil engineer. 

Crozet was born in France and trained as an artillery officer and civil engineer. After the defeat of Napoleon&#x27;s army, he emigrated to the United States in 1816 and joined the U.S. Army to teach at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. 

After resigning his commission in 1823, he took a job with the Virginia Board of Public Works and oversaw the planning and construction of canals, turnpikes, bridges and railroads in Virginia, including the area which became West Virginia during the American Civil War (during which Crozet sided with the Confederate States of America). Crozet also helped found the Virginia Military Institute in 1839 and earned a nickname as the &quot;Pathfinder of the Blue Ridge.&quot;

==Early life, family==
Claudius Crozet was born in Villefranche-sur-Saône, Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, France on December 31, 1789 to Pierrette Varion Crozet and her husband, wine merchant François Crozet. His mother died when he was a boy, and his father moved to Paris in 1800 with Claude and two siblings. Claude secured permission to attend the École Polytechnique in 1805. He studied engineering (including bridge-building) as well as military matters, and graduated as sub-lieutenant on October 1, 1807. Crozet then graduated from the Imperial Artillery School in Metz, and received a commission as a second lieutenant on June 9, 1809. Thus, he served in the French Army under Napoleon Bonaparte, and won a promotion to captain on July 22, 1812 during Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of Russia. 

At the Battle of Borodino in September 1812, Captain Crozet was taken prisoner, but released in 1814 and returned to duty in the French army. Napoleon abdicated in April 1814, but returned to power about a year later, was defeated at the Battle of Waterloo on June 18, 1815 and surrendered about a month later. Crozet resigned from the French military on April 11, 1816.

On June 7, 1816, in Paris, Crozet married Agathe Decamp, and they would have daughters Agatha and Claudia Crozet Mills and a son (Alfred) before her death in March 1861.

==Immigration to United States and West Point ==
In the fall of 1816, Crozet and his bride immigrated to the United States. Almost immediately after arriving, Crozet began work as a professor of engineering at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York.

While at West Point, Crozet is credited by some as being the first to use the chalkboard as an instructional tool. He also used the &quot;Elementary Course of Civil Engineering&quot;, translated from the course of M. J. Sganzin at the École Polytechnique, designed several of the buildings on the campus, and published &quot;A Treatise on Descriptive Geometry&quot;. Thomas Jefferson referred to Claudius Crozet as &quot;by far the best mathematician in the United States.&quot;

==Life in Virginia==

===Virginia Board of Public Works===
In 1823, Crozet was elected Principal Engineer and Surveyor for the Virginia Board of Public Works. He resigned from his duties at West Point, and brought his wife and two children (a boy and a girl) with him to live in Richmond, Virginia.

Virginia&#x27;s Board of Public Works was very active in promoting the development of canals, roads, and railroads. His work included approving various proposals and determining their engineering feasibility. At the time, Virginia extended all the way from the Atlantic Ocean to the Ohio River and was the largest state east of the Mississippi River. It included what is now the State of West Virginia. Crozet worked on hundreds of transportation projects, such as the Northwestern Turnpike.

Typical of his many projects of this nature was the Chesterfield Railroad, the first in Virginia, the plans of which he examined before Board of Public Works funds were approved. It began operations in 1831.

In 1832, Crozet left Virginia to work in Louisiana. However, he returned to his old job in Virginia in 1837 to work on roads, canals, railroads and other points of necessity for the state. By this time, some railroads were already under construction and the canal system had reached its potential. He left office in 1843 after losing support of canal owners when he correctly forecast the future advantages railroads would hold for Virginia. Authoring textbooks on highway, railroad and aqueduct design, his 1848 map of the entire state was the first since the one prepared by Peter Jefferson, father of Thomas Jefferson, over a century earlier.

===Virginia Military Institute===

Crozet was one of the founders of Virginia Military Institute (VMI) at Lexington, Virginia, a major training institution for engineers and militia officers for Virginia and the South. When VMI opened in 1839, Crozet was the architect of the college&#x27;s academic program and military organization. At its first meeting, the members of the VMI Board of Visitors elected Crozet president of the Board, a position he held for six years (while remaining the state&#x27;s Chief Engineer).

However, his varied duties meant Crozet did not reside in Lexington, Virginia. In 1840, he and his family and five enslaved people lived in Richmond, Virginia. Ten years later, he and at least two much younger engineers boarded with plantation owner John T. Cocke in Albemarle County, Virginia.

===Blue Ridge Tunnels===

In 1839, Crozet surveyed the Blue Ridge Mountains and determined that the best way to allow the Blue Ridge Railroad, an extension of the Virginia Central Railroad, to cross the mountain would be through a series of four tunnels (from east to west: Greenwood Tunnel, Brookville Tunnel, Little Rock Tunnel, and Blue Ridge Tunnel) near Rockfish Gap at Afton Mountain. The long Blue Ridge Tunnel was opened in 1856, although rail service did not begin until April 1858. At that time, it was the longest tunnel in the United States and one of the longest in the world. Dug a decade before the invention of dynamite it was considered to be an &quot;engineering wonder of the world&quot; and was less than a half-foot (15.2 centimetres) off perfect alignment, as construction had proceeded from either end. Upon completion of the tunnels in 1858, the Blue Ridge Railroad ceased to exist, becoming a part of the Virginia Central Railroad.

During the American Civil War, Confederate General Thomas Stonewall Jackson, a former instructor at VMI, used Crozet&#x27;s tunnel to transfer his &quot;foot cavalry&quot; (comparable to a &quot;rapid deployment force&quot; today) from the Shenandoah Valley to the east side of the Blue Ridge quickly, to the puzzlement and consternation of Union military leaders.

In 1868, the Virginia Central Railroad was merged with the Covington and Ohio Railroad to create the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway; the original tunnel served until it was replaced with a different alignment in 1944. Perhaps as mute testament to Crozet&#x27;s extraordinary skills, despite advances in technology from the 1850s, the &quot;new&quot; mid 20th century tunnel was off-center, in comparison with only 6 inches in Crozet&#x27;s earlier project.

==Death and legacy==

Crozet died in January 1864 at the residence of his daughter and son-in-law, as the Confederacy was losing the Civil War, but more than a year before its defeat. He was initially buried near his wife and children in Shockoe Hill Cemetery, but in 1942 his remains were reinterred in the Virginia Military Institute cemetery. Hundreds of plans and drawings which he oversaw have been retained in the archives of the Library of Virginia.

The town of Crozet, Virginia was named in his honor in 1870. The original Blue Ridge Tunnel was converted into a &quot;rails-to-trails&quot; project sponsored by Nelson County in 2020 and is the third-longest pedestrian tunnel in the United States.

VMI also named its dining hall in his honor, so cadets sometimes affectionately call it &quot;Club Crozet&quot;.

<doc id="1335853" wikidata="Q925656" url="?curid=1335853" title="Bulweria">
<text>Bulweria is a genus of seabirds in the family Procellariidae named after English naturalist James Bulwer. The genus has two extant species, Bulwer&#x27;s petrel and Jouanin&#x27;s petrel. A third species, the Olson&#x27;s petrel, became extinct in the early 16th century; it is known only from skeletal remains. Bulwer&#x27;s petrel ranges in the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans, whereas Joaunin&#x27;s petrel is confined to the northwestern Indian Ocean. Olson&#x27;s petrel is known from the Atlantic.

&quot;Bulweria&quot; petrels have long been considered related to the gadfly petrels in the genus &quot;Pterodroma&quot;, but recent mtDNA cytochrome &quot;b&quot; sequence analysis has proven them to be closely related to the shearwaters in the genus &quot;Puffinus&quot; and especially the &quot;Procellaria&quot; petrels.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Bulweria&quot; was introduced in 1843 by the French naturalist Charles Lucien Bonaparte to accommodate Bulwer&#x27;s petrel. The petrel had originally been placed in the genus &quot;Procellaria&quot;. The genus name is from the specific epithet for Bulwer&#x27;s petrel, &quot;bulwerii&quot;. This had been coined in 1828 by the naturalists Jardine and Selby to acknowledge the artist and naturalist James Bulwer who had collected the type specimen on the island of Madeira.

The genus contains three species:

<text>Southampton is a community on the shores of Lake Huron in Bruce County, Ontario, Canada. It is close to Port Elgin and is located at the mouth of the Saugeen River in the Saugeen Ojibway Nation Territory. The size of the town is 6.44 square kilometres. The permanent population in 2016 was 3,678, but the summer population is higher since cottagers and campers spend vacation time in the area.

Although the community still has its own post office, and road signs indicating the name Southampton, it is no longer an entity in its own right. In 1998, Port Elgin, Southampton and Township of Saugeen, all along the shores of Lake Huron, were amalgamated to form the Town of Port Elgin-Saugeen-Southampton. On December 17, 1998, the province renamed the community the Town of Saugeen Shores. The primary employment categories are agriculture, small business, tourism, and the Bruce Power nuclear power station 40 km away. Southampton is a bedroom community, a retirement destination, and a tourist destination.

==History==

Long before settlers arrived to the area, Southampton was an important trading area, according to a historic plaque erected in town by the Government of Ontario, titled Fur Trading at Saugeen:

The community was originally known as Saugeen by the early residents, by the Canadian Post Office and by Custom House Departments. However, the Crown Land Departments labelled the village as Southampton and the name stuck as the town was incorporated, named after Southampton, the English sea port. The first European settlers of the area, around 1848, were Captain John Spence and William Kennedy, who wanted to establish a fishing company.

While it proved unsuccessful, Spence became a sailor and Kennedy joined a search for the Arctic explorer, Sir John Franklin. Nevertheless, in 1851 there were at least a dozen families living in the community. In the same year, the Post Office was established, the first and only in Bruce County for several years. Three years later, a Bank of Upper Canada was built.

In 1846, &quot;Smith&#x27;s Canadian Gazetteer&quot; describes Saugeen (Southampton) as little more than a pioneer settlement:

The pioneers of Southampton wanted the village to become the county town or county seat, as the village held the only Crown Land Department and Post Office in the county. However, the town of Kincardine had a larger population and seemed the strongest rival. Furthermore, Southampton did not have enough population to meet the requirements for incorporation. The town petitioned the Legislative Assembly of Ontario and the elective officials passed an exceptional Act of Incorporation on July 24, 1858 to allow the community to be considered for the county seat. Despite their efforts, Walkerton eventually won the battle.

In the mid-1800s, John Denny built a dam, a grist mill, a sawmill, a woolen mill and an inn on the Saugeen River. (Only the latter building remains at 484 Carlisle Street; the current dam was built in the 1970s.)
The Chantry Island Lightstation Tower was completed in April 1859, first lit on April 1, with Duncan McGregor Lambert as the first keeper. (The tower and the keeper&#x27;s home have been extensively renovated and are open for tours, several days a week late May to mid-September, operated only by the Marine Heritage Society. Otherwise, access to the island is prohibited because it is a federal bird sanctuary.)

Records from 1869 indicate that the population had increased to 600. Large amounts of wheat, pork and lumber were being shipped from the village. A bank agency was operating. Good roads were available to other communities. A steam ship made runs to Goderich and Collingwood in summer; stagecoaches operated in winter.

Southampton was incorporated as a town in 1904; at the time, its population was over 2400. The economic base included commercial fishing, warehousing, furniture factories, a tannery and mills.

The town built a hospital in 1947, a post office in 1952, a library in 1956, an arena in 1961 (replaced in 1977) and a new firehall in 1974.

In 2001 a Pallasite meteorite was recovered from Lake Huron close to Southampton. It is believed to have been transported there by glacial action.

In the early 2000s, a historically significant shipwreck was discovered on the beach. Relics of the ship, &quot;General Hunter&quot;, can be found in the Bruce County Museum.
===Railway history===

The history of Southampton is intertwined with the history of the Wellington, Grey and Bruce Railway (WG&amp;B). The original 1856 charter for what was then known as the Canada North-West Railway called for a line &quot;... from
Southampton on Lake Huron to Toronto on Lake Ontario with branch to Owen Sound[.]&quot; The railway was intended to both serve the local area and to provide a through route to the west via the Great Lakes steamer trade. It remained a paper railway for several years, and in 1864 was rechartered as the Wellington, Grey and Bruce, with a key provision allowing it to be taken over by the Great Western Railway, as well as a change of southern terminus to Guelph, to connect to the Great Western&#x27;s Galt and Guelph Railway. Construction began at Fergus in 1867, and it was formally leased by the Great Western in 1869. The line slowly marched northwest through the late 1860s and early 1870s, reaching Palmerston around 1871. The final stretch of the line, from Harriston to Southampton, was subsidized by the provincial government at $2,000 per mile; it is this final stretch which would later become the CN Southampton Subdivision. The full line to Southampton finally opened on December 7, 1872.

The line would survive repeated mergers over the next fifty years: first, the Great Western&#x27;s acquisition by the Grand Trunk Railway in 1882, then the consolidation of numerous railways into the Canadian National Railways (CNR) system in the early 1920s. The CNR managed the former Wellington, Grey and Bruce mainline using its division and subdivision system, with the section from Harriston Junction to Southampton being known as the Southampton Subdivision. The CN Stratford-to-Southampton passenger service was converted to Budd Rail Diesel Cars (RDCs) in 1958. The CN passenger timetable for 1960–61 shows a fragmented network of mostly six-day-a-week Railiner services in the area, with six round trips per week between Palmerston and Southampton, requiring a transfer at Palmerston to travel further. Regular passenger service on the line disappeared by 1970.

Around this time, the Douglas Point Spur was constructed, branching off the main Southampton Subdivision line at Port Elgin. It was primarily used for transporting fuel oil from Sarnia to the Bruce Nuclear Generating Station at Douglas Point. CN abandoned the former WG&amp;B mainline in stages throughout the 1980s, beginning with the oldest section running from Fergus to Palmerston; the Southampton Subdivision from Harriston Junction to Southampton was abandoned in 1988, including the Douglas Point Spur.

=== Historical timeline, 1848–1904 ===

Although specific dates vary depending on the source, the following are excerpted from a reliable source, History of the County of Bruce, Ontario, Canada, by Norman Robertson, published in 1906.

==Climate==
==Economy==
Tourism is the majority source of revenue for the economy; however, the Bruce Nuclear plant in nearby Tiverton, Ontario, is a major employer. In 2016, the Bruce Nuclear Generating Station started a $13 billion refurbishment program which will provide employment for many residents and maintain demand for other services. According to Bruce Power, this multi-year plan &quot;will generate between 1,500 and 2,500 jobs on site annually – and 18,000 across Ontario directly and indirectly – while injecting up to $4 billion annually into Ontario’s economy&quot;.

==Tourism==
This area of the Lake Huron shore is known for its long sand beaches (the Main Beach is approximately 4 km long) as well as the sunsets since the beach area faces to the west.

Every Friday night in from mid June to early September, a bagpiper plays under the &quot;Big Flag&quot; at the foot of High Street on Friday evenings, a tradition which started in the late 1990s. Canada Day is a highly celebrated occasion, where hundreds of cottagers and locals alike gather on Southampton Beach to watch the fireworks lit off the base of the &quot;Big Flag&quot;. During the months of July and August there are &quot;Ghost Walks&quot; available every Tuesday night with Katherine Leonard and Raymond Harrison. These commence at sunset at the foot of High St at the &quot;Big Flag&quot;. During the summer and early autumn, the beaches are full of people who have come to see the colourful sunsets lighting up the sky over the lake.

Near the town, Southampton, a summer destination, is close to Chantry Island, Port Elgin, Saugeen First Nation which holds a PowWow in August each year, and Sauble Beach. Every Thursday evening from early June to late August, a Cruise Nite is held; the classic cars park downtown on High St. near the lake shore. Concerts are held at Fairy Lake at least one evening per week in summer.

Fishing is common in this area in the nearby Saugeen River, at Denny&#x27;s Dam and in Lake Huron. The Chantry Chinook Classic Salmon Derby is held each summer, usually from about mid-July to the second week of August. The contest&#x27;s weigh stations are located in Saugeen Shores and in two other Lake Huron communities, Kincardine, Ontario, and Wiarton, Ontario.

The Bruce County Museum &amp; Cultural Centre provides displays about local history and in summer especially, offers adult and children&#x27;s programming and special events. These are listed in the Shoreline Beacon community newspaper. The museum has been enlarged over the years and was recently renovated. In addition to a settlers cabin, the facility houses numerous historic artifacts from the area, genealogical records, county newspapers, photographs, and municipal documents.

The Chantry Island Lightstation Tower was built in 1859; the tower, keeper&#x27;s cottage, boat house and dock have been fully restored. The island is a federal Migratory Bird Sanctuary and access is prohibited except with the single licensed tour operator. From late-May to mid-September, tours of the lightstation facilities are available several times a week. They leave on the Marine Heritage Society&#x27;s boat from the ticket office by the fishing boat docks at the harbour.

Three other local lighthouses have been designated under the Heritage Lighthouse Protection Act: McNab Point and both the Front and Rear Range lights at the River Front.

===Cottages===

There are numerous cottage owners in and around Southampton. Cottage owners are uniquely split between those who own their land outright and those with cottages located on Native lands. A lease relationship exists between the Saugeen First Nation (&quot;Chippewas of Saugeen&quot;) and cottagers who have built seasonal homes on Native land in the lakeside area between urban Southampton and Sauble Beach; there are approximately 1,200 such cottages. Each cottager on such land pays an annual lease fee to the First Nation for use of the land. The current (mid-2019) lease contract between the cottagers and two Saugeen First Nation Reserves, Chief&#x27;s Point 28 and Saugeen 29, is in effect until 30 April 2021.

==Transportation==

 passes through Southampton, following its lakeshore route to the south and veering over land to the north on its way to Owen Sound. Bruce County Road 3 intersects with it just south of Southampton, near Port Elgin. Bruce County Road 13 continues following the lakeshore north from Southampton.

===Trails===

The Saugeen Rail Trail is a long rail trail connecting Southampton and Port Elgin. It also connects to the larger Bruce County Rail Trail, It follows the route of the former Wellington, Grey and Bruce Railway line (later the CN Southampton Subdivision) which was abandoned in 1988. After the railways ceased to service the area, the tracks were removed and the beds were vacant and overgrown. A group of volunteers founded the Saugeen RailTrail Association in 1990, and convinced Port Elgin, Southampton and Saugeen Township to acquire sections of the then-unused rail bed. Over the years, the bed has been developed as trails for walking and cycling. The trail also connects to the 80 kilometre long Bruce County Trail Network which leads to towns such as Paisley, Walkerton, Mildmay and Kincardine. The trailhead can be accessed at River Street in Port Elgin, a few blocks north of the town centre and east of Hwy 21. There are other access points in both towns, some with parking. The trail is not groomed for cross-country skiing during the winter but is used frequently for that purpose.

The Great Lakes Waterfront Trail also runs through Southampton, following a more coastal route and a mix of on-road and off-road rights of way. South of Port Elgin, it connects to MacGregor Point Provincial Park.

==Health care==
The Town of Saugeen Shores&#x27; hospital is in Southampton, Saugeen Memorial. Many physicians&#x27; practices are at the Saugeen Shores Medical Building. The hospital is part of the Bright Shores Health System&#x27;s network of hospitals in northern Bruce and in Grey County. Hospital facilities include 16 beds, a 24-hour emergency department, surgery, acute medical care, outpatient services, and day surgery including ear, nose and throat surgery.

<doc id="1335864" wikidata="Q4929616" url="?curid=1335864" title="Blue Peter (band)">
<text>Blue Peter was a Canadian new wave synthpop band founded in 1978 in Markham, Ontario, by Chris Wardman and Paul Humphrey. In their heyday, Blue Peter opened for major international acts such as the Police and Simple Minds. The video for &quot;Don&#x27;t Walk Past&quot;, directed by Rob Quartly, was No. 85 on MuchMusic&#x27;s top videos of the century list, and was played on MTV in the United States, in spite of the lack of American record distribution for the band. Humphrey died on April 4, 2021, after a long illness.

==History==
Blue Peter was founded by guitarist/songwriter Chris Wardman and lead singer Paul Humphrey in the late 1970s, as a high school band.
The initial lineup was rounded out by bassist Geoff McOuat and drummer Ron Tomlinson; this ensemble recorded Blue Peter&#x27;s first EP, &quot;Test Patterns for Living&quot;, in 1979. In 1980, Mike Bambrick replaced Tomlinson on drums, and in the same year, the band released their first full-length album, &quot;Radio Silence&quot;.

Over the next couple of years, Blue Peter ran into difficulties with record labels and management, which led to them briefly releasing material on their own label, including &quot;Chinese Graffiti&quot; in 1981. Around this same time, McOuat left the band and was replaced by new bassist Rick Joudrey. After a year without label representation, Blue Peter returned to Ready Records in 1982, in time to release &quot;Up To You&quot;. &quot;Chinese Graffiti&quot; was included on the &quot;Up To You&quot; release, and won the band a CASBY Award (then known as the &quot;U-Knows&quot;) for Single Of The Year in 1982.

When &quot;Falling&quot; was recorded, the band was fleshed out by the addition of Jason Sniderman on keyboards, and new drummer Owen Tennyson (replacing Bambrick). The album was their most successful, and would also prove to be their last. It spawned their biggest single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Walk Past&quot;, and its companion video, which won awards including &quot;Best Video of 1983&quot; from the Canadian Film and Television Association. The music video, inspired by &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, was created at the insistence of the band who saw British and American artists making visuals for MTV.

&quot;Falling&quot; ranked 24th on CFNY&#x27;s Top 83 of &#x27;83. &quot;Don&#x27;t Walk Past&quot;, was ranked at number 92 in CFNY&#x27;s Best 102 of the Decade, published in 1990. After &quot;Falling&quot;, Blue Peter had some of the tracks, including &quot;Don&#x27;t Walk Past&quot;, remixed by engineer Kevin Doyle and released these remixes as &quot;Version&quot; in 1984. That same year, Blue Peter won another CASBY, this time for Male Vocalist of the Year, for Paul Humphrey.

Later in 1984, Blue Peter demoed several tracks for a proposed new album (tentatively entitled &quot;Vertigo&quot;), but the band broke up in 1985 before the tracks were completed or released.

In 1997, the band issued the &quot;best-of&quot; compilation &quot;All Through The Night&quot; which featured one newly overdubbed and mixed track from the &quot;Vertigo&quot; demo sessions called &quot;Equalizer&quot;.

In 2006, Blue Peter reunited for a concert to commemorate the release of &quot;The Best of Ready :: 20th Century Masters — The Millennium Collection&quot;. The following year, the band reissued their catalog as three compilation CDs. The re-release of &quot;Falling&quot; included eight of the &quot;Vertigo&quot; demos as bonus tracks.

For the next decade or so, the band played a couple of concerts a year, including appearances at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2009 to promote the movie Suck, which featured music by them on its soundtrack. In January 2011, Blue Peter performed at the Horseshoe Tavern in Toronto as part of &quot;Juno Decades: Songs of the &#x27;80s&quot;.

==Live==
Blue Peter performed across Canada between 1979 and 1985. Some notable opening slots included the Boomtown Rats (Toronto at El Mocambo), the Jam (Toronto at the Concert Hall, and Ottawa), Simple Minds at (Massey Hall in Toronto, and Montreal) and The Police at &quot;The Police Picnic &#x27;83&quot; in Toronto. In 1984, the band played a sold out show at Toronto&#x27;s Ontario Place Forum.

<text>Canada Bay is an estuarine bay on the Parramatta River, in the inner-west of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. It is the innermost inlet of the larger Hen and Chicken Bay. Two other bays to the north of Canada Bay are two other bays named for Canadian internment camps for convicts involved in the Lower Canada Rebellion:

* Exile Bay – surrounded by Massey Park Golf Club and Prince Edward Park
* France Bay – surrounded by residential area of Cabarita, New South Wales

==Location and features==

The shoreline of Canada Bay is largely open parkland, with some residential use to the north and east. The City West Link Road, a major arterial road, runs along the southern shore of the bay.

A suburb on the shore of the bay is named after it, as is the City of Canada Bay, the local government area encompassing a large portion of inner-western Sydney.

==History==

The name Canada Bay honours a link between Australia and Canada. Following the Lower Canada Rebellion of 1837 to 1838, two Irish and 58 French Canadian rebels were deported to Australia. At the request of the local Catholic bishop, they were brought to Sydney. Imprisoned at Longbottom Stockade (which was located at what is now Concord Oval), the convicts broke stone for the construction of Parramatta Road and collected oyster shells for making lime. In 1842, the French Canadians were allowed to work outside the prison. Between 1843 and 1844, all received pardons and, except for two people who died and one (Joseph Marceau) who settled in Dapto all returned to Canada.

After the rebellions, the Australian Governor General and High Commissioner to Canada recommended that Britain grant responsible self-government to the Union of Upper and Lower Canada. In the 1850s, the Australian colonies achieved responsible government and parliamentary democracy. Many parts of Canada Bay are a reminder of this history: Exile Bay, France Bay, Durham Street, Marceau Drive, Polding Street and Gipps Street. Bayview Park, occupying the headland at the northern end of the bay, has a plaque that honours the exiles and marks the point of disembarkation.

<text>WFLA-TV (channel 8) is a television station licensed to Tampa, Florida, United States, serving as the NBC affiliate for the Tampa Bay area. It is owned by Nexstar Media Group alongside St. Petersburg–licensed CW owned-and-operated station WTTA (channel 38) and Sarasota-based low-power MyNetworkTV affiliate WSNN-LD (channel 39). WFLA-TV and WTTA share studios on South Parker Street in downtown Tampa; through a channel sharing agreement, the two stations transmit using WFLA-TV&#x27;s spectrum from a transmitter in Riverview, Florida.

==History==

Channel 8 first signed on the air on February 14, 1955, with a live broadcast of the Gasparilla Pirate Festival. It is the longest serving television outlet in the Tampa Bay region still in operation, as it signed on less than two years behind UHF outlet WSUN-TV (channel 38), which ceased operations in 1970. It was originally owned by &quot;The Tampa Tribune&quot;, along with WFLA radio (970 AM and 93.3 FM, now WFLZ). WFLA-TV has been an NBC affiliate since the station&#x27;s inception. Largely because of its newspaper background, it was the early ratings leader in the Tampa market until WTVT (channel 13) passed it for first place in 1962. In 1966, Richmond Newspapers, publishers of the &quot;Richmond Times-Dispatch&quot; and part-owner of the &quot;Tribune&quot;, acquired full control of the paper and the WFLA radio and television stations. Three years later, Richmond Newspapers changed its name to Media General, and WFLA-TV, the first television station owned and operated by the company, would be the flagship of its broadcasting group for the rest of its existence.

Due to an FCC regulation in effect at the time that stated that TV and radio stations in the same market, but with different owners had to have differing callsigns, the station&#x27;s callsign was changed to WXFL on January 19, 1983, after WFLA-AM and -FM were sold (WFLA and WFLZ are currently owned by iHeartMedia). At the time, Federal Communications Commission cross-ownership regulations forced Media General to sell the radio stations; however, the company was granted a permanent waiver permitting it to keep &quot;The Tampa Tribune&quot; and the television station. Channel 8 reverted to its original WFLA-TV call letters on January 1, 1989. That same year, it surged to first place in the Tampa Bay ratings and has stayed there for most of that time, led by one of the most popular anchor teams in the country. For one day in May 1999, UPN affiliate WTOG (channel 44) housed the operations for WFLA-TV, after a power outage occurred at the station&#x27;s main studios in Downtown Tampa.

WFLA and &quot;The Tampa Tribune&quot; remained corporate siblings until Media General sold the newspaper to Tampa Media Group Inc. in October 2012 as part of Media General&#x27;s selloff of its newspaper holdings in a reorganization to alleviate the company&#x27;s substantial debt load. (With the exception of the &quot;Tribune&quot;, the company&#x27;s other newspapers went to World Media Enterprises). Despite the split, the two outlets continued a newsgathering partnership until the &quot;Tribune&quot; was merged with the &quot;Tampa Bay Times&quot; in 2016, with their operations adjacent to one another at the downtown Tampa facility. In January 2013, as a result of the sale, WFLA began outsourcing its digital operations and website to Worldnow, as part of a group deal with the company. Following the takeover of the company by the principal staff of LIN Media, Media General&#x27;s stations, including WFLA, have since migrated to the WordPress.com-based platform and site design previously introduced by LIN, which in turn is now being replaced by Nexstar&#x27;s own Lakana CMS platform.

On August 20, 2014, Media General announced that it would acquire MyNetworkTV affiliate WTTA (channel 38) from Sinclair Broadcast Group. The deal made WTTA a sister station to WFLA.

On January 27, 2016, it was announced that what was then known as the Nexstar Broadcasting Group would buy Media General for $4.6 billion. WFLA and WTTA became part of the newly minted Nexstar Media Group on January 17, 2017.

==Programming==
WFLA mostly clears the entire NBC programming lineup, but it airs the fourth hour of &quot;Today&quot; at noon instead of the network&#x27;s recommended 10 a.m. time slot which is occupied by the local lifestyle program, &quot;Daytime&quot; (see below).

===&quot;Daytime&quot;===
WFLA-TV produces &quot;Daytime&quot;, a lifestyle and entertainment program which airs weekday mornings at 10 am; the program features regular correspondents and contributors for various topics. In 2003, WFLA and &quot;Daytime&quot; caused controversy after &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported of its &quot;pay for play&quot; practices. The article revealed that businesses were charged several thousand dollars to appear on the show, effectively making their segments &quot;paid segments&quot;. Many people saw this as payola, a practice that is illegal under an FCC ruling. After much dispute, WFLA agreed to identify each paid segment as such to avoid an intervention from Congress.

Original hosts Debra Schrills and Brian Fasulo left the show in 2005. They were later replaced by Cyndi Edwards and Danny New. From 2008 to September 2011, the show aired nationally on the Retro Television Network as part of Media General&#x27;s affiliation deal with the network, but was dropped by RTV when Media General switched most of its stations&#x27; subchannel affiliations to MeTV. National broadcasts of the show currently air on The Family Channel and Youtoo America. Edwards left &quot;Daytime&quot; in September 2020 and was replaced by former CBS News correspondent Maggie Rodriguez in February 2021.

===Sports programming===
Since 2006, channel 8 airs any Tampa Bay Buccaneers games when they are featured on &quot;NBC Sunday Night Football&quot;; the station also served as the default home station of the team in its first season as a member of the American Football Conference in 1976; with the team&#x27;s move to the National Football Conference the next year, the station aired up to two games a season in which they played host to an AFC team at Tampa Stadium until the end of the 1997 season. WFLA provided local coverage of Super Bowl XLIII, which was hosted at Raymond James Stadium. In addition, through NBC&#x27;s broadcast contract with the NHL that ran through 2021, Tampa Bay Lightning games aired on the station; this included their Stanley Cup Finals appearance in 2015 and their victories in 2020 and 2021 (game 5 of the latter series was the last NHL game aired on NBC).

===News operation===
WFLA presently broadcasts 42 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with seven hours each weekday, three hours on Saturdays and four hours on Sundays). Arch Deal and Bill Henry were the prominent faces of WFLA&#x27;s newscasts in the 1960s. Deal&#x27;s tenure was abruptly cut short in 1975, when he suffered injuries from a parachute accident. Bob Koop served as the evening anchor from 1977 to 1979. Longtime anchorman Bob Hite came to the anchor desk in 1979. The station began using a helicopter for newsgathering called &quot;Eagle 8&quot; in October 1985.

Bill Ratliff, who was brought in to anchor the evening newscasts in 1982 and had been morning and noon anchor since 1985, retired from WFLA on June 25, 2009; Ratliff (who was previously a political contributor at WTSP) died on May 8, 2012. WFLA began broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition in early September 2007. Following Bob Hite&#x27;s November 2007 retirement after 30 years, Keith Cate assumed anchor duties of the 6 and 11 p.m. newscasts along with veteran anchor Gayle Sierens, who herself retired in May 2015.

In the midst of a market shake-up in December 1994, which saw three Tampa area stations swapping network affiliations (CBS affiliate WTVT switching to Fox; ABC affiliate WTSP, channel 10, switching to CBS; and Fox affiliate WFTS-TV, channel 28, switching to ABC), WFLA was one of the few major stations in the market that did not change its network affiliation. As a result, it became the highest-rated station in the market, a position formerly held by WTVT, which saw its ratings drop after switching from CBS to Fox. However, since NBC&#x27;s ill-fated prime time experiment with &quot;The Jay Leno Show&quot; from September 2009 to January 2010, WTVT regained the top spot.

In the February 2012 sweeps period, WFLA was the clear ratings winner for early morning, evening, and late news. It was also the only station in the market to gain an audience for its late newscast despite NBC&#x27;s lackluster ratings performance at the time. On July 30, 2012, WFLA debuted a new weeknight 7 p.m. newscast; the first such program in that timeslot in the Tampa market since WFLA produced a similar newscast for WXPX-TV (channel 66) from 2000 to 2002. On August 26, 2013, WFLA launched an hour-long 4 p.m. newscast. Concurrent with the addition, WFLA dropped its 11:30 a.m. newscast on August 23 (the second time WFLA discontinued its midday newscast in its history, although it retains a noon newscast on Saturdays and Sundays), however, management stated that a midday newscast may return to the station&#x27;s weekday schedule in September 2014. However, it was less than 3 years later in May 2016, when WFLA reintroduced a new one-hour midday newscast at 11 a.m.

At the start of 2015, WFLA assumed production of WTTA&#x27;s news updates, &quot;Great 38 News Now&quot;. Previously, the news updates, which debuted eleven days before Media General&#x27;s acquisition of WTTA, were produced by that station&#x27;s former sister in West Palm Beach, WPEC. On January 4, 2016, WFLA once again began producing a local newscast for WTTA, this time, a nightly hour-long newscast at 8 p.m. under the title &quot;NewsChannel 8 at 8:00 on Great 38&quot;, pushing WTTA&#x27;s MyNetworkTV programming back one hour. On August 7, 2017, WFLA began producing another local newscast for WTTA, this time, a two-hour expansion of its morning newscast under the title &quot;NewsChannel 8 Today on Great 38&quot;, airing from 7 a.m. to 9 am. Until September 28, 2018, the second hour of that program, which was titled, &quot;Make Today Gr8 with Gayle and Leigh&quot;, was co-hosted by Gayle Guyardo and morning meteorologist Leigh Spann.

On August 4, 2021, Tampa Mayor Jane Castor declared &quot;Steve Jerve Day,&quot; in honor of WFLA&#x27;s longtime meteorologist, who would retire two days later after 23 years at the station.

===Controversy and criticism===
====&quot;Silencing Christians&quot;====

On June 27, 2009, WFLA aired an hour-long documentary, &quot;Silencing Christians&quot;, which dealt with the Fundamentalist Christian position of condemning homosexuality as a sin, and claims of the gay community&#x27;s drive to make all criticism of homosexuality as hate speech, in the name of political correctness. The documentary, presented as a paid program from the American Family Association, was televised at 7 p.m. that evening, on the same day that St. Petersburg held the city&#x27;s pride parade, &quot;St. Pete Pride&quot;, on the weekend of the 40th anniversary of the Stonewall riots.

Prior to the telecast, the station was swamped with numerous phone calls and e-mails against WFLA&#x27;s broadcast of the program. After it aired, the station logged hundreds of phone calls and over 1,000 e-mails protesting the broadcast.

General manager Mike Pumo refused to elaborate on the decision, other than the show&#x27;s content did not &quot;raise the red flag&quot; during pre-screening. Stratton Pollitzer, deputy director of Equality Florida, considered the show hate speech, saying, &quot;I think this program is a piece of homophobic propaganda and it has no place on a major network like NBC&quot; despite the fact that NBC is merely the network that WFLA is affiliated with.

On July 15, 2009, 70 to 100 protesters gathered outside of WFLA&#x27;s studios to protest against the special and the station&#x27;s attitude towards the community. The station, however, remained firm on its decision to show the program.

===Subchannels===
&lt;section begin=subs /&gt;

&lt;section end=subs /&gt;

WFLA-TV carried NBC Weather Plus on digital subchannel 8.2 until 2008. The station replaced the Retro Television Network with MeTV on digital subchannel 8.2 on September 26, 2011, as part of a groupwide affiliation agreement with Media General; the Weigel Broadcasting-owned MeTV network also replaced RTV on some Media General-owned stations in other markets. On September 26, 2019, Court TV replaced MeTV as the primary subchannel affiliate of WFLA-TV, with MeTV moving to WMOR-TV. Nexstar announced in early June 2021 that WFLA-DT2 would take the company&#x27;s Antenna TV network on September 1, 2021, after a three-month interregnum when WTSP replaced it with their own in-house network, Twist.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WFLA-TV shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 8, on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition VHF channel 7, using virtual channel 8.

<text>James Mourilyan Tanner (1 August 1920 – 11 August 2010) was a British paediatric endocrinologist who was best known for his development of the Tanner scale, which measures the stages of sexual development during puberty. He was a professor emeritus of the Institute of Child Health at the University of London.

== Biography ==
Tanner was born on 1 August 1920 in Camberley, Surrey, United Kingdom and was educated at Marlborough College and University College of the South West of England. His family travelled widely while he was a youth because his father, a soldier in the British Army, was stationed in various locations. Tanner was a top-ranked hurdler who might well have participated in the 1940 Summer Olympics which were to be held in London, but were cancelled after the outbreak of World War II. He decided to become a doctor and not follow his father into the military after his brother was killed early in the war. He attended St Mary&#x27;s Hospital, London, under a scholarship in which he instructed fellow students in physical education. He went to the United States to complete his medical studies as part of a group of British students funded by a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation. He met his first wife, fellow physician Bernice Alture, while at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine and performed his internship at Johns Hopkins Hospital.

Tanner oversaw a study initiated by the British government at an orphanage in Harpenden starting in 1948. While the study had originally been planned to study the effects of malnutrition on children, Tanner charted and photographed the growth of the children in the study over a period of several years, developing the Tanner Scale, which measures sexual maturation in adolescents based on characteristics that can be objectively measured, including size of the genitals and the quantity of pubic hair. The data gathered led to the development of the modern growth chart, used by paediatricians around the world to monitor the pattern of growth in children through adolescence, with separate curves measuring the growth trajectory for boys and girls identified as maturing early, normal or late. Based on his research, Tanner noted that 90% of an individual child&#x27;s adult height is based on genetic factors, but that the environment is the key factor when thousands of children are studied. By studying the growth characteristics of large populations, Tanner concluded that community-wide data on adult height was an indicator of how a society fosters its youths.

Tanner did early research on the use of human growth hormone to address children whose growth was significantly delayed and was responsible for selecting the small handful of children in the UK who would be treated with the limited supply of HGH extracted from human cadavers. After a number of patients worldwide died in 1985 of Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease linked to HGH treatments, Tanner immediately stopped the therapy, but had patients who insisted that they were willing to take the risk to address their child&#x27;s delayed growth. Treatments resumed in the 1990s following the introduction of genetically engineered human growth hormone.

Tanner died at age 90 on 11 August 2010 in Wellington, Somerset, due to a stroke and prostate cancer. He was survived by his second wife, Gunilla, as well as by a daughter, Helen Phillips, a stepdaughter, a stepson and three granddaughters.

<doc id="1335890" wikidata="Q984504" url="?curid=1335890" title="Nicola Fabrizi">
<text>Nicola Fabrizi (4 April 1804 – 31 March 1885) was an Italian politician, born at Sassi, Garfagnana under the jurisdiction of Modena. Fabrizi was one of the most militant and dedicated leaders of the Risorgimento, the movement aimed at the unification of Italy.

==Insurrections==
He took part in the Modena insurrection of 1831, and attempted to succour Ancona, but was arrested. After his release he went to Marseilles where he joined the Young Italy movement. Afterwards he organized, with Giuseppe Mazzini, the ill-fated Savoy expedition. Taking refuge in Spain, he fought against the Carlists, and was decorated for valour on the battlefield (18 July 1837).

==Conspiracies==
In 1837 he established a centre of conspiracy at Malta, endeavoured to dissuade Mazzini from the Bandiera enterprise, but aided Crispi in organizing the Sicilian revolution of 1848. With a company of volunteers he distinguished himself 1849 in the defence of Venice, afterwards proceeding to Rome, where he took part in the defence of San Pancrazio. Upon the fall of Rome he returned to Malta, accumulating arms and stores, which he conveyed to Sicily, after having worked with Crispi to prepare the Sicilian revolution of 1860.

==Governorship==
While Giuseppe Garibaldi was sailing from Genoa towards Marsala, Fabrizi landed at Pozzillo, and, after severe fighting, joined Garibaldi at Palermo. Under the Garibaldian Dictatorship he was appointed governor of Messina and minister of war. Returning to Malta after the Neapolitan plebiscite, which he had vainly endeavoured to postpone, he was recalled to aid Cialdini in suppressing brigandage.

==Diplomacy==
While on his way to Sicily in 1862, to induce Garibaldi to give up the Aspromonte enterprise, he was arrested at Naples by La Marmora. During the war of 1866 he became Garibaldis deputy chief of staff, and in 1867 he fought at Mentana. As a member of parliament from 1861 to 1865 he endeavoured to promote agreement between the leaders of the Left. From 1878 onwards worked to secure the return of Crispi to power. He died in March 1885, two years before the realization of this objective.

<doc id="1335895" wikidata="Q3470589" url="?curid=1335895" title="Sam the Record Man">
<text>Sam the Record Man was a Canadian record store chain that, at one time, was Canada&#x27;s largest music recording retailer. In 1982, its ads proclaimed that it had &quot;140 locations, coast to coast&quot;.

Its iconic flagship store was located at 259 Yonge Street in 1959 and moved to 347 Yonge Street two years later, remaining there from 1961 until it closed in 2007. Located at Yonge just north of Dundas, the store became part of a strip of music stores, nightclubs and taverns featuring live performance that produced the &quot;Toronto Sound&quot; and was the centre of Toronto&#x27;s music scene in the 1960s.

The Yonge Street store was the best known store in the Sam the Record Man chain of 140 locations across Canada, two blocks away from the Eaton Centre and Dundas Square. Sam&#x27;s became a popular attraction, drawing people into its selection of LP records, and later cassettes and compact discs. It flourished in the Downtown Toronto area, quickly gaining notoriety and outselling the competition. What started as a single storefront had evolved into an entire block completely dedicated to the Sam the Record Man store. For several years, the store went into head-to-head competition with the popular A&amp;A Records flagship store, just up the street, before the latter filed for bankruptcy in 1993. The building was demolished over a period of two years, from 2009 until 2011. It is part of the site on which Toronto Metropolitan University&#x27;s (then known as Ryerson University) Sheldon &amp; Tracy Levy Student Learning Centre was built. The store&#x27;s iconic neon sign has been restored and installed in a new location overlooking nearby Yonge-Dundas Square.

The Information Age, competition with the HMV chain and other factors, forced Sam the Record Man into bankruptcy in 2001, but its flagship location remained in business until 2007. One independent franchise store, in Belleville, Ontario, continues to bear the Sam the Record Man name.

== Founding ==
Sniderman&#x27;s Music Hall was launched in 1937 by Sam Sniderman (d. September 23, 2012) and Sidney Sniderman, as the record department in his family&#x27;s existing store, Sniderman Radio Sales &amp; Service, at 714 College Street (now home to L Squared Salon) in Toronto, which had itself been established in 1929 by Sidney Sniderman. In 1959, Sniderman&#x27;s Music Hall moved to Yonge Street in order to compete with A&amp;A Records, and was located in the basement of Yolle Furniture Store at 291–295 Yonge Street. On Labour Day 1961, the new store moved north to its location at 347 Yonge Street, two doors down from A&amp;A, where it became a Toronto landmark. The flagship store of the competing A&amp;A Records chain was located nearby at 351 Yonge Street. Steeles Tavern, a popular nightclub and live music venue, was between the two stores at 349 Yonge Street until it closed in 1974.

== Iconic neon signs ==

The Yonge Street location was always noted for its kitschy signage. 

With Sam the Record Man growing rapidly, the business added the first of two spinning records that would later become its trademark. The first record, added at 347 Yonge Street, was designed by the Markle Brothers in 1969–70; it was 7.5 metres (24.6 feet) wide and 8 metres (26.2 feet) tall. The second sign was added in 1987, just north of the original, at 349 Yonge Street (former Steeles Tavern Restaurant). It was designed by Claude Neon Inc. In that same year, the letters spelling out &quot;SAM&quot; were added above the records (it took 550 light bulbs to light up the two SAM signs), as was the lower signage that read &quot;Yes this is SAM the Record Man&quot;. The insert in the middle of the records reading &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment&quot; was also added at this time. Its first neon signage included the store&#x27;s address in large neon &quot;347&quot; numbers vertically aligned between two windows. On the left side was a thermometer made from neon. On the far right was a neon multi-sectioned triangle similar to the one on top of the Canada Life Building, which indicated weather conditions depending on how it was blinking. In the late 1960s, the iconic spinning record replaced the previous neon signs, with the second neon record being added in the mid 1980s. The buildings where the sign hung were two Second Empire structures (347 Yonge was formerly McDonald and Wilson Lighting store with the second floor bricked off to allow for the sign to be installed, 349 Yonge was Steeles&#x27; Tavern, whose upstairs windows had been bricked off when the store became a women&#x27;s fashion store (Le Chateau) following the closing of the restaurant. Both buildings have since been demolished.

===1960s===
A third floor was built onto the back portion of the original 347 Yonge Street store sometime in the 1960s and a basement stockroom was excavated. It served as the Third Floor Bargain Basement for many years before becoming the first video department for the store. Concert tickets were sold there for a time as well.

An additional property was purchased several stores to the north (371 and 375 Yonge?) which became Sam the Tape Man (formats open reel, 4 track, 8 track, and cassette) with Sam the Chinese Food Man upstairs. When Sam found out that his favourite Chinese restaurant was being demolished to make way for the new Toronto City Hall, Sam offered the restaurant the upstairs of his Sam the Tape Man store as a new location. It served as the venue for many flagship store, franchise, and record industry functions over the years. In the early 1970s, Sam the Tape Man was relocated to the 347 Yonge store and the space rented to an adult bookstore. The restaurant was eventually closed and the building sold and fully renovated into two Asian restaurants.

===1970s===
The parking lot behind the adjoining Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) at Yonge and Gould St. was purchased in the early 1970s and an annex built which housed the classical department and later added the tape department (now only cassettes and 8-tracks), when it was incorporated back into the 347 location. CIBC restricted the height of the annex building to slightly below the height of the bank building, which prevented the addition of a second story, though a low-ceiling mezzanine was included for use as a stock area.

===1980s===
Steeles&#x27; Tavern at 349 Yonge Street closed in 1974 and the building was acquired by Sniderman in the early 1980s; however, the ground floor was rented out to a stereo equipment store. After cutting access doorways through the walls to the existing store, the second floor became the CD department and a greatly reduced-in-size Bargain Basement. Eventually the ground floor and basement of 349 Yonge Street were incorporated via doorways cut through the walls into the adjoining record store, with the 45s department moving to the back of 347 Yonge St. The ground floor of 349 Yonge became a greatly expanded CD department, the second floor became the video department, and a third floor was added to the back portion of the building to house the video rental library, staff lunchroom, and new staff washrooms. The Bargain Basement was restored to the third floor of 349 Yonge Street. When CDs were incorporated into their respective departments, the video store was relocated to the ground floor of 349 Yonge Street.

===1990s===
The chain branched out into computer software and games in the mid-1990s and a new department, Sam The Interactive Man, was created on the now-adjoined and renovated third floors to house it. It was later moved briefly to the ground floor, prior to the expansion of the store into the CIBC property.

In 1991 the CIBC property (341, 343, and 345 Yonge Street) was purchased and the store was reconfigured yet again with the Pop/Rock department moving to the ground floor of the new property. New cashier stations were installed at the front of 347 Yonge where the pop/rock department had been. A two-stage plan of renovation/construction involving the CIBC building and the classical annex were drawn up but only the first stage of the reconstruction was completed. The renovations comprised the creation of doorways from the CIBC building into the classical annex, the addition of stairs and a mezzanine which became the new location for Sam The Interactive Man. When the interactive department was closed it became the Nexx Level, which comprised the relocated R&amp;B/Soul/Rap/Electronic department. The Jazz department was moved to the second floor of 349 Yonge St. and the Pop Vocal and Instrumental departments moved to the second floor where jazz had been. Huge outdoor video screens were installed by an advertising firm on the (rented) lower portions of the roof of the former CIBC building. Extensive neon signage, including a replica of the original neon sign for Sniderman Radio Sales &amp; Service, was installed in the former CIBC building. The third floor was turned into offices and fulfilment area when the store expanded to online sales.

===2000s===
Major renovations followed the re-consolidation of the company after bankruptcy (January 2002). Much of this work was redecoration of the sales areas in terms of painting, lighting, flooring, and the inclusion of vintage fixtures such as a bar with mirrors, a wood-and-glass display cabinet, and a barbershop counter/mirror. Classical was moved to the newly renovated ground floor of 349 Yonge Street and the Jazz, Blues, &amp; Folk department was temporarily moved back to the second floor of 349 Yonge St. while redecorating took place, then moved back when the renovations were completed. The former classical annex was transformed into a new DVD department, complete with a chandelier, theatrical spotlights, drapes, popcorn machine, 5.1 sound system, video monitors, neon sign, and theatre marquee. A small stage was also added for in-store performances. Renovations were also done on the ground floor of 347 Yonge, primarily the addition of a magazine section and a new cashier desk. The Pop/Rock Department and Nexx Level were also renovated. The former parkette (Hacksel Place) and chess tables on Gould Street were made over and incorporated into a café added to the Pop/Rock department. At one point limited menu food service was provided by Lick&#x27;s hamburger chain.

==Notable customers==
Sam Sniderman was known as a friend to people starting out in the Canadian music industry, and helped jumpstart the careers of the likes of Anne Murray, Rush, Gordon Lightfoot and The Guess Who, who were all known to appear at the store from time to time.

==Bankruptcy and change of ownership==
When the Sam the Record Man chain was forced into bankruptcy in 2001, Sniderman&#x27;s sons Jason and Robert (&quot;Bobby&quot;) took over the flagship store. The two men kept the store running until announcing on May 29, 2007, that the store would close permanently on June 30 of that same year, citing the impact of technology on record sales as the determining factor of the closure.

== The flagship store in film and music ==

The double-disc neon sign is frequently visible in films shot in Toronto that use Yonge Street as a location. Recent examples include the 2008 film &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;, which features the signs prominently during the final battle sequences, and the CTV/CBS series &quot;Flashpoint&quot;, which is set in Toronto.

For a brief time in the 1910s, 347 Yonge Street was the location of music publishers Chappell &amp; Co, now Warner/Chappell Music.

== Building the chain ==

The flagship Sam the Record Man store was famous for its Boxing Day sales and often served as the location for newspaper and television reports on Boxing Day shopping. Shoppers would line up over many city blocks, in the cold, to get one-day-only specially discounted (20%–25%) records, and eventually, as the technology changed, CDs, and videos. Prices for videotapes were discounted as much as 50%.

The store was also known for its deep catalogue, eclectic selection of imported recordings, time specials, and ever-changing stock of deleted or cut out stock. Some of the walls bore autographs and photographs of various musicians and celebrities (among them Elton John, Iggy Pop, Bruce Springsteen, Liberace, Tony Bennett, Charles Aznavour) who had visited the store. There were in-store appearances (Radiohead, Meat Loaf) and, in the later years, in-store performances by various musical artists (Gordon Lightfoot, Blue Rodeo, Daniel Lanois, Saga, Don Ross, Mojo Nixon and Skid Roper, Luka Bloom, Los Lobos). T-shirts and later a complete line of &quot;Sam&#x27;s Wear&quot; were available for customers to purchase.

The chain stores were early promoters of Canadian artists, because they prominently featured their work with in-store displays, and concerts. Well-known Canadian artists like Loreena McKennitt, Barenaked Ladies, k d lang, Cowboy Junkies, and Ron Sexsmith had their first recordings stocked or consigned at the Yonge Street flagship store, then later throughout the chain. Sam Sniderman played a role in getting the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to implement Canadian content (Can-con) regulations for radio stations in the early 1970s. The move to Can-con allowed many Canadian musicians to gain a voice in their own country.
In addition to stocking (and later purchasing) the complete catalogue of the Canadian Talent Library broadcast music (see entries for Chad Allan, Jackie Mittoo, Dr. Music, Peter Appleyard), the flagship store also received copies of every LP record released in Quebec, making it the best source for French Canadian recordings outside of the province of Quebec.

In the late 1960s, Sniderman expanded the business with franchise and corporate stores in Toronto and elsewhere. The expanded business was called Roblan Distributors (named for Sam Sniderman&#x27;s son Robert and Sid Sniderman&#x27;s daughter Lana (d. August 2012)) and conducted business at the store level as Sam the Record Man. Some stores were not full franchises but used Roblan Distributors as their principal rack jobber and were known as RD 2000 stores. A warehouse to service the franchises and flagship store was established at 110 Bond Street incorporating the accounting and head offices which had previously been located at Yonge Street. It later moved to much larger facilities at 274 Church Street. This building was demolished and became a parking lot in the late 1990s after record companies agreed to direct ship orders to the franchise stores, thus rendering the need for a central warehouse redundant. (Previous to this the record companies would ship at no cost only to a few designated locations and that with a minimum order value.) The accounting, offices, and some warehousing facilities were moved back to 110 Bond Street, but closed when the chain filed for bankruptcy. Both properties were sold to Ryerson University along with the Yonge Street properties in January 2008.

The chain subsequently expanded to 130 stores (including RD2000 stores) across Canada, before the recorded music and media business started to decline in the 1990s. At one time, the chain was the leading music retailer in Canada.

The chain published a free music magazine (&quot;Network&quot;) in the late 1980s. One of the features in the magazine was a picture of a commissioned work of art (painting, collage, sculpture) by a local artist (among them Mendelson Joe and Kurt Swinghammer) depicting the store or brand. Some of these graphics were displayed in light boxes installed throughout the store or as the graphics for &quot;Sam&#x27;s Wear&quot;.

== 2001 bankruptcy ==

In 2001, tough competition, narrow margins, and the availability of free music downloads from the Internet, forced the chain to declare bankruptcy. Most of its 30 corporate-owned stores closed. The Sniderman family was underwriting the chain&#x27;s debt of $15 million for the previous five years and finally could not continue to lose money. Under new management, Sam Sniderman&#x27;s sons Jason and Bobby Sniderman reopened the Yonge Street store in 2002, along with 11 franchise stores outside of Toronto. The franchise stores were not a part of the bankruptcy filing, but the corporate stores were. Eventually, all but one of the corporate stores closed. The last corporate store, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, was shut down on February 20, 2007.

== Yonge Street flagship store closes ==
On May 29, 2007, Jason and Bobby Sniderman announced that the iconic flagship store, on Toronto&#x27;s Yonge and Gould Streets, would close permanently on June 30, 2007. They stated that &quot;their decision reflects the increasing impact of technology on the record industry.&quot; There was also increasing pressure to rent out some of the property or sell it to Ryerson University, currently known today as Toronto Metropolitan University.

On May 30, 2007, supporters started a Facebook group to save the store&#x27;s neon spinning record signs titled &quot;Save the Sam&#x27;s Sign!!!&quot;; the group, and its attached online petition, garnered more than 18,000 members. On June 14, 2007, it was announced that the signage, and some of the fixtures and memorabilia from the store, would be auctioned by Benaco Sales on June 27. The remaining stock had been greatly reduced to sell but was not sold at the auction sale.

However, on June 22, 2007, the Toronto city council voted in favour of designating the entire property as a heritage site, protecting the entire building, including the landmark signs. The entire building was designated because the &quot;Ontario Heritage Act&quot; has no provisions to protect store signs.
The site at 347 Yonge Street was a valuable piece of property and was purchased by Ryerson University in early 2008. The site sat vacant for several months before the spinning records were lit again at Nuit Blanche on October 4, 2008, although Ryerson owned the building at the time.

On January 18, 2008, Ryerson University acquired the property for future expansion of its nearby campus.
On October 4, 2008, the iconic neon signs were lit for the last time as part of Toronto&#x27;s Nuit Blanche festivities. The removal of the signage commenced shortly after the final lighting, and by mid-March 2009 the building had been partially demolished.
About a year after the lighting of the records at Nuit Blanche, demolition of the structure began. The building was demolished in early 2010. The new Ryerson Student Learning Centre (SLC) opened on February 23, 2015, on the old Sam&#x27;s site.

The closing of the flagship store left two Ontario-based franchise stores in operation, one in Sarnia and one in Belleville. The Sarnia store closed in 2009; the last remnant of the Sam the Record Man retail empire was a former franchise store that remained open under the Sam the Record Man name in Belleville as an independent store until 2024 when owner Spencer Detsun retired.

==Sign preservation at Yonge-Dundas Square==
 Under a heritage preservation deal with the city, Ryerson University was expected to restore the spinning record signs and incorporate them into the new Student Learning Centre on the former Sam&#x27;s site. However, the university later stated that the signs were not compatible with their designs for the new building. In July 2014, city council approved a revised agreement with Ryerson, whereby the university would pay to install and maintain the sign atop a city-owned building at 277 Victoria St., two blocks southeast of the original location.

In July 2017, Ryerson announced that restoration of the almost half-century-old neon signs had started in June, and they would be ready for display over Yonge-Dundas Square in the fall. The re-installation was completed and the sign has been relit since 2018.

==History==
A 2015 review of local government boundaries by the NSW Government Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal recommended that the City of Canada Bay merge with adjoining councils. The government proposed a merger of the Burwood, Canada Bay, and Strathfield Councils to form a new council with an area of and support a population of approximately 163,000. In May 2016 Strathfield Council challenged the proposed merger between Strathfield, Burwood and Canada Bay and commenced proceedings in the New South Wales Land and Environment Court. After the Court heard that there were legal flaws in the report from the state government-appointed delegate who examined the proposal for merging the councils, the NSW Government withdrew from the case and the merger proposal stalled. In July 2017, the Berejiklian government decided to abandon the forced merger of the Strathfield, Burwood and Canada Bay local government areas, along with several other proposed forced mergers.

<doc id="1335902" wikidata="Q7194656" url="?curid=1335902" title="Pimlico Race Course">
<text>Pimlico Race Course is a thoroughbred horse racetrack in Baltimore, Maryland, most famous for hosting the Preakness Stakes. Its name is derived from the 1660s when English settlers named the area where the facility currently stands in honor of Olde Ben Pimlico&#x27;s Tavern in London. The racetrack is nicknamed &quot;Old Hilltop&quot; after a small rise in the infield that became a favorite gathering place for thoroughbred trainers and race enthusiasts.

Pimlico was owned by the Stronach Group from 2011 until 2024, when ownership transferred to the state-run Maryland Thoroughbred Racetrack Operating Authority (MTROA). Pimlico closed for renovations in September 2024, with all of Pimlico&#x27;s racing dates except for the 2025 Preakness Stakes transferred to Laurel Park until the project is completed.

==History==
Pimlico officially opened in the October 25, 1870, with the colt Preakness winning the first running of the Dinner Party Stakes. Approximately 12,000 people attended, many taking special race trains arranged by the Northern Central Railway. Three years later the horse would have the 1873 Preakness Stakes named in his honor. The track is also noted as the home for the match race in which Seabiscuit beat War Admiral in the second Pimlico Special, on November 1, 1938, before a crowd of 43,000. The capacity of the stadium is 98,983.

The most notable architectural feature of the original racetrack was the members&#x27; Clubhouse, located on the first turn. A &quot;steamboat Gothic-era&quot; design, the Clubhouse was topped by a weathervane that was repainted each year in the colors of the winner of the Preakness. The old Clubhouse was restored in 1956, with private rooms on the third floor named after Triple Crown winners. The President&#x27;s room contained racing archives, while the second floor contained the Jockey&#x27;s Hall of Fame. The building was richly decorated and housed a notable collection of racing art. The building burned down when a fire started in the front rooms on June 17, 1966. The only item salvaged was the weathervane, which was relocated to a replica Victorian cupola in the infield.

The Preakness Stakes and the Pimlico Special are run at a distance of 1-3/16 miles (9½ furlongs). The Pimlico track record for that distance is held by Farma Way, who set it while winning the Pimlico Special in 1991.

In the century and more since its opening, Pimlico Race Track has weathered much outside history including the 1904 Great Fire of Baltimore, Great Depression of the 1930s, and several notable Baltimore riots. Pimlico also survived Prohibition and even an anti-gambling movement in 1910. A bill sponsored by the state racing commission in 1949 to abandon the track was originally supported by Governor William Preston Lane Jr., who reversed his position in late March. As Alfred G. Vanderbilt said, &quot;Pimlico is more than a dirt track bounded by four streets. It is an accepted American institution, devoted to the best interests of a great sport, graced by time, respected for its honorable past.&quot; The races held at Pimlico, especially the Preakness, draw spectators from the Mid-Atlantic region. In 2007, the official attendance was 121,263 for the Preakness, the most people to watch a sporting event in Maryland history. More than $87.2 million in bets were made. 

On March 23, 2010, an agreement was reached to sell the two &quot;Maryland Jockey Club&quot; tracks (Pimlico and Laurel Park) from Magna Entertainment Corporation to its parent company, MI Development. On May 7, Penn National Gaming, with MI Development, announced they would jointly own and operate the Maryland Jockey Club. Penn National, which began in 1973, operating the Penn National Race Course near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, has grown to become the largest racetrack operator in the country.

In June 2011, The Stronach Group took control of the tracks when MI Development bought out Penn National Gaming&#x27;s minority stake in the Maryland Jockey Club, which owned Laurel Park Racecourse, Pimlico, and Bowie Race Track which is used as a training facility. The Stronach Group is owned by Canadian horse breeder and owner Frank Stronach, who also was MI Development&#x27;s chairman and chief executive, a position he gave up in order to run Maryland&#x27;s racetracks. Penn National bought a 49% stake in the Jockey Club in 2010 in hopes of securing a slots license at Laurel Park.

In 2018, the track began using a GPS-based timing system.

===Renovations===
In February 2017, the Maryland Stadium Authority released the first phase of a study saying that Pimlico needed $250 million in renovations.

In January 2018 it was reported that Pimlico renovation studies were continuing. A report issued on December 14, 2018 suggested the existing buildings be demolished and rebuilt. In a meeting held in June 2018 by the Maryland Stadium Authority, locals &quot;overwhelmingly supported upgrading the track property.&quot; The Preakness Stakes took place at Pimlico in May 2019, with media reports suggesting that future Preakness races could be moved to Laurel Park.

In October 2019, The Stronach Group reached an agreement in principle with the city of Baltimore and groups representing Maryland horsemen that would permanently keep the Preakness at Pimlico. As part of the agreement, The Stronach Group would donate both Pimlico and Laurel Park to newly established government entities that would oversee the properties, with Stronach licensed to conduct the race meets. Pimlico&#x27;s grandstand would be demolished and replaced with a smaller structure, and temporary seating would be added to handle the attendance during Preakness week. The race track itself would be rotated 30 degrees in order to create nine parcels of land that could be sold for private development, and new barns for horses would be constructed.

The Racing and Community Development Act, approved by the Maryland General Assembly in May 2020, allowed the Maryland Stadium Authority to issue $375 million in bonds for the renovation of both Stronach Group tracks.

On March 14, 2024, the Stronach Group announced that it had reached a deal with the Maryland state government to transfer ownership of Pimlico to the new Maryland Thoroughbred Racetrack Operating Authority (MTROA), allowing for a multi-million dollar renovation project of the race course&#x27;s track to begin and for the construction of a new training center at a separate location. The deal would also consolidate thoroughbred racing in Maryland to Pimlico and have the Maryland state government assume responsibility over racing operations. The General Assembly passed a bill ratifying the deal in April 2024, which provided for $400 million in state bonds to be used for renovations to Pimlico.

The MTROA assumed ownership of the Pimlico property on July 1, 2024. On the same date, the Maryland Jockey Club announced that the entire Pimlico property would close on September 1, 2024 to begin the reconstruction project, with Laurel Park hosting day-to-day thoroughbred racing and training in Maryland until renovations are completed. Pimlico is expected to temporarily reopen in May 2025 to host the 150th Preakness Stakes, while the Preakness in 2026 would be held at Laurel. The new Maryland Jockey Club, as a non-profit entity of the MTROA, assumed control of thoroughbred racing in the state on January 1, 2025.

===&quot;The Great Race&quot;===
On October 24, 1877, the United States Congress shut down for a day so its members could attend a horse race at Pimlico. The event was a 2½-mile match race run by a trio of champions: Ten Broeck, Tom Ochiltree, and Parole. 

Ten Broeck, the Kentucky champion, was owned by Frank B. Harper. Tom Ochiltree, the Eastern champion and winner of the 1875 Preakness Stakes, was owned by George L. Lorillard, an heir to the Lorillard tobacco fortune. Parole, a gelding, was owned by Pierre Lorillard IV. Parole, with William Barrett up, prevailed with a late run, crossing the finish line three lengths ahead of Ten Broeck and six ahead of Tom Ochiltree, which had helped to set the early pace with Barbee in the irons. An estimated 20,000 people crowded into Pimlico to witness the event.

The event is depicted in a four-ton stone bas relief—copied from a Currier &amp; Ives print and sculpted in stone by Bernard Zuckerman—hanging over the clubhouse entrance at Pimlico. It is long and high and is gilded in 24-karat gold leaf.

==Description==

The track has a one-mile dirt oval, surrounding a seven-furlong (7/8 mile) turf oval. There are stables for about 1,000 horses. Pimlico&#x27;s capacity, including the infield, is over 120,000 people.

The track area is bounded by Park Heights and Winner Avenues to the west, West Rogers Avenue and West Northern Parkway to the north, Preakness Way to the east, and West Belvedere Avenue to the south. (Its namesake street, Pimlico Road, runs from the city line near Greenspring Avenue to Park Heights Avenue south of Cold Spring Lane, but is rendered discontinuous to through traffic between Northern Parkway and Belvedere Avenue.)

==Non-racing events==

Pimlico Race Course was the original US site for Virgin Festival from 2006 through 2008. The first was held on September 23, 2006, featuring bands The Killers, Red Hot Chili Peppers, and The Who. In 2007, it was a two-day festival (August 4–5) and featured The Police, the Beastie Boys, The Smashing Pumpkins, and Velvet Revolver. Its name was altered, to &quot;Virgin Mobile Festival&quot;, when it returned to Pimlico on August 9–10, 2008, with five headliners: The Foo Fighters, Kanye West, Stone Temple Pilots, Jack Johnson, and Nine Inch Nails. The event moved to Merriweather Post Pavilion in 2009.

Since 2014, Pimlico Race Course has been home to Moonrise (festival), an electronic dance music festival featuring artists such as Above &amp; Beyond, Bassnectar, and Kaskade.
The Orthodox Jewish community nearby to the race track also use Pimlico Race Course to burn their chametz every year.

==Transportation==
Pimlico Race Course has typically accessed from either the Rogers Avenue Metro Station to the east in Park Heights, Baltimore, and to the west by the Mount Washington Light Rail station in Mount Washington. For major events, a shuttle is typically in place by the Maryland Transit Administration going to the race course from light rail and metro stations.

<text>Walter Mortimer Mirisch (November 8, 1921 – February 24, 2023) was an American film producer. He was the president and executive head of production of The Mirisch Corporation, an independent film production company which he formed in 1957 with his brother, Marvin, and half-brother, Harold. He won the Academy Award for Best Picture as producer of &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot; (1967).

== Life and career ==
=== Early years ===
Born to a Jewish family in New York, Mirisch was the youngest of three sons born to Josephine Frances (née Urbach) and Max Mirisch. His siblings included film producer Marvin. His father emigrated from Kraków, Poland in 1891 at the age of 17, arriving in New York City where he worked as a tailor. His mother was the daughter of immigrants from Hungary and Poland. His father was previously married to Flora Glasshut with whom he had two sons; she died of cancer at the age of 40. Walter Mirisch graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School. He was a summer vacation usher in Jersey City&#x27;s State Theater, his first job associated with the movie business. He soon moved up to higher positions at other theaters.

A heart murmur kept him from joining the Navy, but Mirisch was still eager to serve his country during World War II. He moved to Burbank, California, to work at a bomber-plane plant, where he wrote technical articles, sharing knowledge with other military manufacturers. After the war ended Mirisch immediately turned his attention back to his original passion, the movies. In 1942, he received a BA degree from the University of Wisconsin–Madison and the next year he graduated from Harvard&#x27;s Graduate School of Business Administration. He produced his first film, &quot;Fall Guy&quot; (1947), for Monogram Pictures.

=== Career ===
At the age of 29, Mirisch became production head at Allied Artists Studio, initially only a division of Monogram, with some 30 films to oversee. During his tenure, he found time to personally produce &quot;Flat Top&quot; (1952), &quot;Wichita&quot; (1955), which received a Golden Globe Award from the Hollywood Foreign Press Association as Best Outdoor Drama of 1955, &quot;The First Texan&quot; (1956), and &quot;An Annapolis Story&quot; (1955). Among other films, he supervised the productions of &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot;, &quot;Friendly Persuasion&quot; (both 1956), and the Billy Wilder-directed &quot;Love in the Afternoon&quot; (1957).

Mirisch headed that category of creative producers who learned their craft thoroughly from the very inception of a project through all phases of its production process. Known in the industry as a perfectionist, he supervised every detail of his films from the earliest stages to the final release.

The Mirisch Company was founded in 1957. It produced 68 films for United Artists, including three that won the Academy Award for Best Picture, namely &quot;The Apartment&quot; (1960), &quot;West Side Story&quot; (1961) and &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot; (1967), which also won four other Oscars. Among the most noteworthy Mirisch projects that Walter personally produced are: &quot;Man of the West&quot; (1958); &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; (1960); &quot;Two for the Seesaw&quot; (1962); &quot;Toys in the Attic&quot; (1963); the film version of James A. Michener&#x27;s monumental novel, &quot;Hawaii&quot; (1966), which was nominated for seven Oscars, and its sequel, &quot;The Hawaiians&quot; (1970); &quot;Midway&quot; (1976), the saga of America&#x27;s greatest naval victory; the tender and moving &quot;Same Time, Next Year&quot; (1978); and &quot;Romantic Comedy&quot; (1983).

For the NBC television network, Mirisch was executive producer of &quot;Wichita Town&quot; with Joel McCrea (1959–1960), &quot;Peter Loves Mary&quot; (1960–1961), &quot;Desperado&quot;; &quot;Return of Desperado&quot;; &quot;Desperado: Avalanche At Devil’s Ridge&quot;; &quot;Desperado: Legacy&quot;; &quot;Desperado: Sole Survivor&quot;; and in 1993, &quot;Troubleshooters: Trapped Beneath The Earth&quot;. Mirisch was executive producer of &quot;Lily in Winter&quot; for the USA Network in 1994, &quot;A Class for Life&quot; for ABC in 1995, as well as &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot;, a weekly series for CBS in 1997.

Ron Howard said of Mirisch, &quot;From &quot;Bomba, the Jungle Boy&quot; to &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot; and &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot; ... Walter Mirisch produced many of the films which dazzled and inspired me (and I&#x27;m not kidding about &quot;Bomba&quot;. I loved those movies as a kid). When I later acted in one of his (lesser) productions, &quot;The Spikes Gang&quot;, I learned that a prolific and brilliant producer could also be a terrific guy and a wonderful teacher.&quot;

=== Honors and awards ===
Mirisch received the 1967 Academy Award for Best Picture for his production of &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot;.

Throughout the years he was the recipient of numerous awards and honors, including The Producer of the Year Award: first, from the Producers&#x27; Guild of America (1967); later, the National Association of Theatre Owners (1972); and then ShowaRama (1975).

In addition, he received the Cecil B. DeMille Award of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association for &quot;outstanding contribution to the entertainment field&quot; (1976), the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for his &quot;consistently high quality of motion picture production (1978), and the Academy&#x27;s Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award, which is given to an individual whose &quot;humanitarian efforts have brought credit to the industry&quot; (1983).

Mirisch served three terms as president of the Producers Guild of America. He served four terms as President of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. He was a former president and Governor of the Performing Arts Council of the Los Angeles Music Center, as well as a trustee of the Motion Picture and Television Fund. Mirisch was also an Emeritus member of the board of directors of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center of Los Angeles, and the board of directors of the UCLA Foundation.

He was decorated by the Republic of France with its Order of Arts and Letters in 1961.

In May 1989, he received an honorary doctorate in Humane Letters from the University of Wisconsin–Madison. In June 1989, he was the recipient of the UCLA Medal, the university&#x27;s highest award.

In 2004, he was honored with a retrospective at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art entitled &quot;The Magnificent Mirisches&quot;. The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York honored him in 2006 with a retrospective of twelve films.

On February 2, 2008, Mirisch presented the Darryl F. Zanuck Producer of the Year award at the 19th Annual Producers Guild of America Awards. The top honor (the equivalent of the Academy Award for Best Picture) went to Scott Rudin, Joel and Ethan Coen for &quot;No Country for Old Men&quot;.

== Personal life and death ==
Mirisch was married to Patricia Kahan (1924–2005); they had three children.

Mirisch turned 100 on November 8, 2021, and died of natural causes in Los Angeles on February 24, 2023, at the age of 101.

<text>Jason Sniderman is a Canadian musician and businessman. He was one of the chief executives of Sam the Record Man, He also played keyboards on a number of rock music albums, performed with the band Blue Peter, and later released several albums under the name Ensign Broderick. He is also the father of Canadian musician Cos Sylvan, who has been the live bassist for Swedish rock band Ghost since 2018.

==Early life==
Sniderman grew up in Toronto, Ontario, the son of businessman Sam Sniderman. He was involved in the music industry from childhood through the family record store.

==Music career==
Sniderman was a keyboard player in the new wave band Blue Peter, joining towards the end of their run in 1983, in time for the recording and release of their final album, &quot;Falling&quot;. He has appeared as a guest musician on albums by other Canadian artists, including contributing keyboards on Randy Bachman&#x27;s album &quot;Any Road&quot;, Chalk Circle&#x27;s recording of 20th Century Boy, and recordings produced by fellow Blue Peter member Chris Wardman. He played keyboards on the albums &quot;Presto&quot; and &quot;Clockwork Angels&quot; by Rush and &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry Too Hard&quot; by Leslie Spit Treeo, and played piano on &quot;6 Blocks&quot; by Meryn Cadell.

Sniderman is an Advisory Board Member of the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame and plays shows with Blue Peter a few times a year.

In March 2018, Sniderman released the album &quot;Feast of Panthers&quot; under the pseudonym Ensign Broderick, a musical alter ego he had first created in childhood. By November, Sniderman had released three more albums of music recorded decades earlier, and one album of new material, &quot;Bloodcrush&quot;. 

==Sam the Record Man==
Sniderman&#x27;s father, Sam Sniderman, started selling records in his brother&#x27;s radio store in the 1930s. His company grew into a national chain, with a flagship store on Yonge Street in Toronto. In the 1980s and 1990s the chain was operated by Roblan Distributors, with Jason Sniderman as Vice President. Sam retired in 2000, and the majority of the chain was closed in 2001 after filing for bankruptcy. Jason Sniderman and his brother Bobby saved the store&#x27;s iconic neon signs, and re-opened the Yonge St. location in 2002. An attempt at building the Sam&#x27;s brand with online sales was not enough, however, with the rise of mp3 downloads and competition from chains such as HMV down the street, Sam&#x27;s was forced to close in 2007.

<doc id="1335911" wikidata="Q121799" url="?curid=1335911" title="Usnea">
<text>Usnea is a genus of fruticose lichens in the large family  Parmeliaceae. The genus, which currently contains roughly 130 species, was established by Michel Adanson in 1763. Species in the genus grow like leafless mini-shrubs or tassels anchored on bark or twigs. Members of the genus are commonly called old man&#x27;s beard, beard lichen, or beard moss.

Members of the genus are similar to those of the genus &quot;Alectoria&quot;. A distinguishing test is that the branches of &quot;Usnea&quot; are somewhat elastic, but the branches of &quot;Alectoria&quot; snap cleanly off.

==Systematics==
The genus &quot;Usnea&quot; was circumscribed by Michel Adanson in 1763. He used the name designated by Johann Jacob Dillenius, whose earlier published description did not meet the rules of valid publication as established by the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants. However, he did not specify a type specimen; the species &quot;Usnea florida&quot;, moved to the genus by Friedrich Heinrich Wiggers in 1780, has been designated as the lectotype. Since the establishment of the genus, hundreds of &quot;Usnea&quot; species have been described. A three-volume series by Józef Motyka published in 1936 and 1947 listed 451 species. By 2006, the genus contained more than 600 species, which made it one of the largest genera within the family Parmeliaceae. However, many former species are now regarded as morphological varieties and adaptations to local circumstances. The number of recognized species in Finland has decreased for this reason, for example, dropping from 34 in 1951 to 25 in 1963 and only 12 in 2000. In addition, some former &quot;Usnea&quot; species have been moved to other genera; for instance, &quot;Usnea longissima&quot; was renamed &quot;Dolichousnea longissima&quot; in 2004. By 2022, the overall number of species assigned to the genus had dropped to 355.

The name &quot;Usnea&quot; is probably derived from the Arabic word &quot;Ushnah&quot;, meaning moss or lichen, though it may also mean &quot;rope-like&quot;. Based on a fossil &quot;Usnea&quot; found in Baltic amber, the genus is known to date back to at least the late Eocene, about 34 million years ago.

==Description==
&quot;Usnea&quot; lichens are fruticose. Structurally they are shrubby, often with many branches, and can be erect or . Some trailing species can grow to considerable size; strands of &quot;Usnea longissima&quot;, for example, may exceed in length. Colours vary depending on the species, from straw-coloured, yellow-green or pale green through green or greyish-green to reddish or variegated red and green. Unlike other similar-looking fruticose lichens, species in this genus have an elastic chord or axis running through the middle of the thallus that can be revealed by gently pulling a filament apart from either end.

&quot;Usnea&quot; looks very similar to the plant Spanish moss, so much so that the latter&#x27;s Latin name is derived from it (&quot;Tillandsia usneoides&quot;, the &#x27;Usnea-like Tillandsia&#x27;).

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;Usnea&quot; lichens are widely distributed in both the northern and southern hemisphere, in both temperate and tropical regions.

They appear in areas with low levels of air pollution. They can often be found on the ground in areas with where trees or branches have recently been cut, such as orchards (after pruning) and active logging areas.

==Ecology==
&quot;Usnea&quot; lichens reproduce via vegetative means through fragmentation, asexual means through soredia, or sexual means through ascogonium and spermatogonium. The growth rate of lichens in nature is slow, but can be increased in laboratory conditions.

Like other lichens, &quot;Usnea&quot; often grows on sick or dying trees due to the pre-existing loss of canopy leaves, allowing for greater photosynthesis by the lichen&#x27;s algae; this leads some gardeners to mistakenly blame the lichen for the tree&#x27;s leaf loss and illness.

&quot;Usnea&quot; is very sensitive to air pollution, especially sulfur dioxide. Under poor growing conditions, such as areas high in pollution, they may grow no larger than a few millimetres, if they survive at all. Where the air is unpolluted, they can grow to 10–20 cm long. It can sometimes be used as a bioindicator, because it tends to only grow in those regions where the air is clean, and of high quality.

==Uses==
===By humans===
==== Traditional medicines ====
According to Paul Bergner, Author of Medical Herbalism, &quot;the usnic acid in &quot;Usnea&quot; is effective against gram-positive bacteria such as &quot;Streptococcus&quot; and &quot;Staphylococcus&quot;, making &quot;Usnea&quot; a valuable addition to herbal formulas for sore throats and skin infections. It is also effective against a bacterium that commonly causes pneumonia.&quot;

Bolivian traditional healers called the Kallawaya use &quot;Kaka sunka&quot; in decoction to cure lung problems. The lichen is macerated in alcohol and rubbed onto the body of those suffering from &quot;nervous fragility&quot;.

Some believe that &quot;Usnea&quot;, in high concentrations, could possess some toxicity. The National Toxicology Program evaluated the issue, undertaking research involved feeding male and female rats and mice ground &quot;Usnea&quot; lichens containing usnic acid for three months at various concentrations. Rats suffered severe toxicity, with significant liver damage observed at various concentrations, while mice experienced liver toxicity, ovarian atrophy, and changes in reproductive cycles at higher doses. Additionally, both species showed weight loss at elevated exposure levels, and mice exhibited potential genetic damage after two weeks at high concentrations. A safe exposure level was established at 60 parts per million, below which no adverse effects were observed.

==== Dyes ====
&quot;Usnea&quot; species have been used to create yellow, orange, green, blue, and purple dyes for textiles. This wide variety of possible colors can be achieved due to variations in chemical composition depending on the species, locality, and race of a particular specimen. Specifically, &quot;Usnea&quot; can contain thamnolic, squamatic, barbatic, salazinic, and alectorialic acids, all of which can affect dye color.

Many indigenous peoples of Central and South America, including the Tarahumura and Mapuche people, have a history of dyeing with &quot;Usnea,&quot; generally to obtain orange and brown hues. The Tarahumura use them to dye wool blankets in brown and russet hues, and the Mapuche have used &quot;Usnea florida&quot; to obtain orange. There is also anthropological evidence that &quot;Usnea cocca sonca&quot; was historically used for dyeing in Peru, and a lichen called &quot;cuaxapaxtle&quot; was used near Mexico City.

==== Cosmetics ====
&quot;Usnea barbata&quot; has been used in cosmetic production for its antimicrobial and antifungal properties as a preservative and deodorant.

==== Firestarters ====
When dry, &quot;Usnea&quot; lichens are flammable and can be used as a fire starter.

==== Food ====
Some &quot;Usnea&quot; species have been used as food sources during times of scarcity. For example, people in Bosnia and Herzegovina ate &quot;Usnea barbata&quot; during the Bosnian War, particularly in the winter, when other plant material was not readily available. They ground it into powdery &quot;flour&quot; to make bread or ate it as mush.

===By other organisms===
The northern parula, a species of New World warbler which breeds in North America, uses &quot;Usnea&quot; lichens in the construction of its nest in some parts of its range. Where these lichens have declined due to air pollution, the bird has also vanished as a breeding species.

<text>True Women is a 1997 American Western CBS TV miniseries based on the 1993 novel by Janice Woods Windle directed by Karen Arthur, starring Dana Delany, Annabeth Gish, Angelina Jolie, Julie Carmen, Tina Majorino and Rachael Leigh Cook. It was filmed in Austin, San Antonio, and McDade, Texas. The series covers five decades, from the Texas Revolution through Native American uprisings and the Civil War to the early stages of the women&#x27;s suffrage movement. This miniseries was first aired on the CBS television network over two nights during May 1997.

The miniseries marks the debut of sisters Duff, Hilary and Haylie Duff, who were uncredited.

==Plot summary==
The story starts with young Euphemia Texas Ashby (Tina Majorino) and her older sister Sara McClure (Dana Delany). When Euphemia gets back to the house from picking flowers she finds out that Sam Houston is coming to the house. Santa Anna is on his way so they must head east in the Runaway Scrape. While they attempt to cross a river Sara suffers from a miscarriage while her young son Little Johnnie dies in Euphemia&#x27;s arms. Many other young and old Texans die and Euphemia is almost lost in a sea of graves. After a month and a week, Sam Houston defeats Santa Anna&#x27;s army and Texas is reborn as the Republic of Texas. They now live in a new home with their horses. Their sisters Fannie and Jane Isabella come to live with them after their father dies at sea. They are very different from Sara and Phemie (Annabeth Gish) and must adapt to their new brutal life.

One year later, Sarah survives an encounter with Tarantula (Michael Greyeyes), a Comanche warrior, and his band of Comanches. Later, Euphemia&#x27;s close friend Matilda &quot;Maddie&quot; Lockhart (Anne Tremko) is abducted by the Comanches and only later released. When given back, the Texans discover that she was brutally tortured, with the right side of her face disfigured by burn scars; the Comanche repeatedly awakened her by placing burning coals on her face. Maddie is bloody and shows signs of beating everywhere. She never fully recovers from her time with the Native Americans.

Euphemia is now sixteen and almost gets attacked by a panther when William King (Matthew Glave), a boy who she dreams about frequently, saves her. They continue to talk every day for the next five years and then get married. Sara&#x27;s own husband dies in battle, and she gets remarried to a musician. Euphemia has a few children with William while they live happily together with the slave Tildy (Khadijah Karriem). They have a few horses, including one called Dancer. Euphemia meets Tarantula once again at a show (he is one of the actors) and since he is walking far for an old man, she gives him Dancer, her best horse. He gives her the name &quot;Brave Squaw Child&quot;. This is the end of Euphemia&#x27;s life in the book.

Cherokee (Julie Carmen) and Lewis (Michael York) want to leave Georgia because Cherokee is half Creek and they are being driven out. They wanted to leave before they were forced to.

Georgia Lawshe Woods (Angelina Jolie) falls in love at the age of fifteen at Swann Lake when two dogs frighten her and make her fall and Colonial Doctor Peter Woods (Jeffrey Nordling) tends to her wounds. She finds herself falling in love with this man and they get married the same year. They have four children a few years later and head to Texas. Along the way Georgia has doubts but Peter wants to keep going. They live in Texas for a while but find out the river water is contaminated, which leads to many deaths from cholera. They move again, and Georgia and Euphemia meet when Sam Houston keeps them together. The story then switches to Bettie Moss.

<doc id="1335935" wikidata="Q3791464" url="?curid=1335935" title="Ian Bennett (footballer)">
<text>Ian Michael Bennett (born 10 October 1971) is an English former footballer who played as a goalkeeper from 1989 to 2014, most notably representing Birmingham City between 1993 and 2005. He is currently the goalkeeping coach at Huddersfield Town.

==Early life==
Ian Michael Bennett was born on 10 October 1971 in Worksop, Nottinghamshire.

==Playing career==
===QPR and Newcastle===
Bennett started his football career as a YTS trainee with Queens Park Rangers in 1988. He turned professional with Newcastle United in March of the same season. Bennett never made a single first-team appearance for either club, and signed for Peterborough United in March 1991.

===Peterborough United===
Bennett signed for Peterborough United in March 1991. He made 89 appearances for the Posh (72 in the League) as they gained successive promotions from the old Fourth and Third Divisions between 1991 and 1993. After two seasons in the then First Division, Bennett moved on.

===Birmingham City===
Barry Fry signed Bennett for Birmingham City for £325,000 in December 1993. He became the first-choice goalkeeper, was ever-present as the club won the 1994–95 Second Division (third-tier) title, and remained as first choice for the next five years before losing his place to Kevin Poole in September 1998 because of injury. A broken finger in 1999–2000 pre-season extended his absence, but he returned to the team in October for a League Cup match at home to Newcastle United. With his first touch, he saved a penalty kick taken by Alan Shearer and Birmingham went on to win 2–0. He spoke after the match about his frustration with the injuries and his desire for first-team football, preferably with Birmingham. He kept his place for a few weeks before being dropped because of his contractual dispute with the club, but signed a new deal in January 2000 and returned to the side, continuing as first choice until a broken thumb ruled him out for the last two months of the season. With Poole also injured, loanee Thomas Myhre completed the campaign. Undisputed first choice the following season, Bennett helped Birmingham reach the 2001 League Cup Final, in which he made some fine saves in a losing cause as Liverpool won on penalties.

Although the signings of Nico Vaesen in summer 2001 and Maik Taylor two years later meant that Bennett was not selected as often as he wanted, he still made his 350th Birmingham appearance in October 2003, keeping a clean sheet against Aston Villa.

In late 2004 he was loaned to Sheffield United where he impressed manager Neil Warnock in the five games he played as cover for the injured Paddy Kenny. After this he was loaned to Coventry City. During his loan spell, his dismissal in the goalless draw to home to Stoke City made him the only Coventry goalkeeper to be sent off in a competitive match at Highfield Road.

===Leeds United===
On 17 June 2005, after 12 years at Birmingham, Bennett transferred to Leeds United who already had Scottish international Neil Sullivan as first-choice goalkeeper. Despite playing the pre-season friendlies, he was limited to four league appearances during the 2005–06 season, obtained deputising for the injured Sullivan.

===Sheffield United===
In July 2006, Bennett transferred for an undisclosed fee to newly promoted Premiership club Sheffield United, signing on a two-year deal to provide competition to the Blades&#x27; first-choice goalkeeper, Paddy Kenny. He played the first game of his second spell at the club at Bramall Lane against Reading on 16 September 2006. Bennett found first-team chances difficult to come by thanks to the fitness and form of Kenny; he made only nine starts in his first two seasons at Bramall Lane. His contract expired at the end of the 2007–08 season but despite reported interest from other clubs he signed a new one-year deal.

The following season again saw his first team opportunities limited to only two league starts and appearances in cup competitions. Nevertheless, the club took up their option to extend his contract for a further year.

===Huddersfield Town===
On 17 June 2010, after leaving Sheffield United, he was signed by Football League One club Huddersfield Town, reuniting with Gary Naysmith and manager Lee Clark with whom he worked at Newcastle United.

Bennett made his debut in the second round of the League Cup against Everton at Goodison Park, as a replacement for first-choice goalkeeper Alex Smithies. His first start for the Terriers was on 5 October, in the Football League Trophy match at the Galpharm Stadium against Peterborough United, which Town won 3–2. His first league start came four days later in the 3–0 win over Colchester United.

He played more than expected due to injuries to Smithies. In a 2–0 win over Carlisle United on 1 February 2011, Bennett twice made saves from François Zoko. After the match, Carlisle United manager Greg Abbott praised Bennett performance and said: &quot;They were wonder saves and saves change games. If one of those had gone in it would have been different.&quot; On 18 May, he saved a penalty in the League One play-off semi-final penalty shootout against Bournemouth, which Huddersfield went on to win 4–2. The following season he saved two penalties in Town&#x27;s 2–2 away draw with Scunthorpe United on 25 October 2011. At the end of the season, Bennett signed a new two-year contract which would see him stay on until the age of 42.

===Coaching career===
Bennett&#x27;s playing contract expired in May 2014. However, after Nick Colgan was appointed as senior goalkeeping coach, Bennett was appointed to Colgan&#x27;s previous role as goalkeeping coach for the Huddersfield Town academy.

A year later, Bennett left the Yorkshire club after five years in order to take up an Academy coaching role at Nottingham Forest. Ahead of the 2020–21 season, he moved on to Middlesbrough to join Neil Warnock&#x27;s staff as goalkeeping coach.

<text>NexTView was an electronic program guide for the analog domain, introduced in 1995 and based on Teletext Level 2.5 / Hi-Text.

It was used by TV programme listings for all of the major networks in Germany, Austria, France and Switzerland. The transmission protocol was based on teletext, however, using a compact binary format instead of preformatted text pages. The advantage compared to paper-based TV magazines was that the user had an immediate overview of the current and next programmes, and was able to search through the programme database, filtering results by categories.

The nxtvepg software enabled nexTView to be viewed using a personal computer.

Some TV manufacturers that implemented this solution were: Grundig, Loewe, Metz, Philips, Sony, Thomson, and Quelle Universum.

From 1997 to October 2013, NexTView was broadcast on Swiss Television channels and on French-language channels whose teletext services were managed from Swiss Television (SwissText) (TV5, M6, Canal+).

<text>The Land of the Sky, or, adventures in mountain by-ways (1876) is a novel by American author Frances Christine Fisher Tiernan, who published under the pseudonym Christian Reid. She published more than 50 novels, most notably this one.

The name refers to the Blue Ridge Mountains and Great Smoky Mountains in western North Carolina. The title of the book has come to be used as a nickname for North Carolina. More recently, it has been adopted by the city of Asheville, which lies between the Blue Ridge and Great Smoky mountains in the state.

<doc id="1335966" wikidata="Q4852943" url="?curid=1335966" title="Baltimore World Trade Center">
<text>The Baltimore World Trade Center is a 30-story skyscraper located on the Inner Harbor of Baltimore, Maryland designed by the architectural firm Pei Cobb Freed &amp; Partners with principal architects Henry N. Cobb and Pershing Wong.

Planning and design of the building began in April 1966. Construction started in October 1973. The building was completed in January 1977, and its construction cost was of $22 million.

Rising above the one-acre plaza where it stands between Pratt Street and the harbor, the building is 30 stories tall when its basement, lobby level and upper utility level are included in the count. Gross floor space covers . Major building components include of office floors, a lobby of , a basement of and of ground level plaza. It is the world&#x27;s tallest regular pentagonal–based skyscraper (the pentagonal-based JPMorgan Chase Tower in Houston is taller, but is not regular).

==Name==
The building&#x27;s name identifies its purpose of accommodating &quot;activities and services devoted to the promotion of world trade&quot; as required for licensing of this name by the World Trade Centers Association. Baltimore is one of 16 charter members of the World Trade Centers Association.

The landmark tower houses the headquarters of the Maryland Port Administration, the Maryland Department of Business and Economic Development and the World Trade Center Institute, which is a member of the World Trade Centers Association and operates as a private, non-profit international business membership organization.

==Alignment and lighting==
The building was positioned so that a corner points out toward the waters of the Inner Harbor, suggesting the prow of a ship. Perched at the Harbor&#x27;s edge, the building appears to rise out of the water when viewed from certain vantage points. It presents a frontal plane toward the city, across a broad plaza between the building and Pratt Street.

In the base at each of the building&#x27;s five recessed corners, 4,500-watt xenon spotlights dramatically illuminate the building at night, from the ground up, with oversized parabolic mirrors at the top of the
five corners then reflecting the light outward in brilliant V-shaped beams. The &quot;beacon&quot; effect was loosely inspired by lighthouses found along the Chesapeake Bay. This signature lighting scheme, designed by Ray Grenald, is visible in the Baltimore skyline from seven to 10 miles away under favorable weather conditions. Installed in 1994, the xenon lighting system replaced 1,000-watt incandescent lamps originally installed at the base of the building, which illuminated only the first three floors.

== Top of the World ==

An enclosed observation level on the 27th floor, called &quot;Top of the World&quot;, provides a 360-degree panoramic view of the city. The Top of the World is handicap accessible, offers Baltimore history, rotating art exhibits, occasional special events, a gift shop featuring local art, and is home of the 9/11 Memorial of Maryland. The observation level is open to the public during daytime hours, and may be rented for special events by government organizations and corporations. Its closure at the end of May was announced on January 16, 2025.

==Impact of September 11 attacks==
Two hours after the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City, Baltimore&#x27;s World Trade Center was evacuated and closed. This was a response to a &quot;credible&quot; threat that the Baltimore building would also be attacked. A resident of southwest Baltimore was arrested that night and accused of giving the police a false warning.

Unsubstantiated bomb threats received on September 12 and September 14 further contributed to security concerns at the building. A temporary barrier of concrete walls was erected around the brick plaza between the building and Pratt Street, closing the area to pedestrian and vehicle access. Four barges were moved to the building&#x27;s harbor side to protect it from attack by boats.

Due to the building&#x27;s name and its prominent location on Baltimore&#x27;s skyline, state officials presumed that a similar attack on other American cities would likely target the Baltimore World Trade Center. Their response was criticized, because &quot;such drastic steps&quot; were not taken at World Trade Center buildings in other cities. As security was relaxed later in the year, the concrete barriers and barges were removed.

The exterior lighting system was turned off and remained dark until the end of 2007. The waterfront walkway beneath the building, an extension of the Harborplace promenade, is now only open to the public during daylight hours.

===9/11 Memorial of Maryland===

A memorial to the victims of the September 11, 2001 attacks, built on the pedestrian promenade of the Baltimore World Trade Center between the building and Pratt Street, was dedicated on September 11, 2011, the tenth anniversary of the attacks. The memorial structure includes three 22-foot long steel beams from the New York World Trade Center, which were part of the 94th to 96th floors of the north tower. Twisted and fused together, the steel beams and damaged limestone pieces from the Pentagon&#x27;s west wall rest atop marble blocks bearing the names and birthdays of the 68 Marylanders who died in the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Windows on the top floor of the Baltimore World Trade Center are marked with all of the names of the September 11 attack victims.

Inscriptions on the marble platform, describing the events of the September 11 attacks, are arranged so that the building&#x27;s shadow moves across them like a sundial. On September 11 each year, the shadow touches each inscription at the time that event occurred.

The second exhibit memorializes the passengers of Flight 93 with a smooth, glossy granite block.

The memorial was designed by the Baltimore architectural firm of Ziger/Snead and paid for by donations.

==Hurricane Isabel flooding==

Hurricane Isabel flooded the Baltimore World Trade Center&#x27;s basement with of water in September 2003, destroying electrical, mechanical and telecommunications equipment serving the entire building, located there. The building remained closed for clean-up for more than a month after the hurricane struck, displacing 60 tenants.

==State ownership of building==
The building is owned by the Maryland Port Administration. As a result, there have been public discussions about whether it should be sold in debates over state budgets. In the &quot;Maryland Transition&quot; report to the incoming Governor Martin O&#x27;Malley in January 2007, the Transportation work group noted that former Governor Robert Ehrlich favored selling the Baltimore World Trade Center. Governor O&#x27;Malley chose to maintain state ownership.

During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, the Baltimore World Trade Center incurred an operating loss of $2.3 million. This was due to an occupancy rate that had declined to 43 percent by March 2008. A low occupancy level was expected &quot;to make it easier to sell&quot;.

The Maryland Board of Public Works took two important steps in 2007 and 2008 toward improving occupancy at the World Trade Center: streamlining lease approvals and hiring an agent. In December 2007, the Board delegated its lease approval authority to the Secretary of Transportation. Meridian Management Corp. was awarded a 5-year contract, beginning on June 10, 2008, to serve as the World Trade Center&#x27;s leasing agent. Meridian&#x27;s contract, approved by the Board of Public Works on May 21, 2008, also includes operation and maintenance of the building.

==Floating wetlands gardens==
Construction of an array of grassy floating gardens, tethered to the waterfront bulkhead below the southern face of the World Trade Center, began in the summer of 2010. This project, scheduled for completion by April 20, 2012, uses floating frames to build wetlands gardens in Baltimore&#x27;s inner harbor. The Waterfront Partnership, a nonprofit group serving the businesses located at the inner harbor, started the project with eight small wetland floats, funded in 2010 with a grant from Blue Water Baltimore. Although the original floats were destroyed by Hurricane Irene, students from the Living Classrooms Foundation and volunteers from T. Rowe Price have built 50 new floating frames to restore the floating wetland system.

The inner harbor wetlands system is expected to extract at least two pounds of nitrogen from the water for every 100 pounds of grass growing on the floats. Its underside will also provide a habitat for small marine life, such as worms, barnacles, eels, crabs and mussels. Plants selected for the floats include a variety of marsh grasses which feed on nutrients from sewage leaks and storm runoff. Plastic beverage bottles, retrieved from trash floating in the inner harbor, are embedded in the structure of the floats to provide buoyancy.

<text>South Mountain Reservation, covering between 2,047 and 2,112 acres (between 8.28 and 8.54 km2), depending on the source, is a nature reserve on the Rahway River that is part of the Essex County Park System in northeastern New Jersey. It is located in central Essex County, New Jersey within portions of Maplewood, Millburn, and West Orange. It borders South Orange between the first and second ridges of the Watchung Mountains.

Carved from wilderness at the end of the 19th century, designed by Olmsted Brothers, and developed over a few decades, the reservation has changed only slightly through the years. Preserved primarily in its wild state, woodlands abound in a variety of hardwood trees, and tall hemlocks tower above streams, creeks and ponds, and waterfalls. Higher points, such as Crater View, offer vistas of the New York and Jersey City skylines, Elizabeth, Union Township, and Staten Island.

==Recreational complex==
Richard J. Codey Arena and Turtle Back Zoo are located within the reservation&#x27;s boundaries. The recreation area was expanded to include Safari Minigolf and the Treetop Adventure Ropes Course in 2010, and McLoone&#x27;s Boathouse Restaurant abutting the Orange Reservoir was added in 2011. In 2013, a paddleboat concession was added, accessible from Cherry Lane, across from the Oakdale Picnic Area, and paths from the restaurant and zoo.

Orange Reservoir is a reservoir located in the reservation&#x27;s northern tract. Within the borders of West Orange, it is owned by the City of Orange and operated and maintained under contract with United Water. It was originally developed during the intense urbanization of northeastern New Jersey in the late 19th century, drawing from the Rahway River. The man-made lake is no longer part of the water-supply system and since the late 2000s (decade) various proposals have been made to allow its use as a recreational resource as part of the Recreational Complex. The complex abutting the reservoir includes a miniature golf course, and a boathouse-restaurant opened in 2011. Proposals were complicated by the fact that while owned by one municipality, it lies within the borders of another, and it is unclear whether it is taxable. Offers by the Essex County Park System to buy or lease property were put in place as a possible resolution. The county was able to reach an agreement to lease the reservoir from the City of Orange until 2032. In November 2013 it was announced that bridges and other improvements for recreational use would be made.

==Dam proposal==
There have been several proposals for easing the damage caused by heavy rains, which include damming the Rahway River, with headwaters in the reservation.

==History==
===Revolutionary era===
Washington Rock is a Revolutionary War historic site, dating back to the late 18th century when Beacon Signal Station 9 was located here—one of 23 beacons built by General Washington to observe British troop movements quartered on Staten Island and New York City.

It was from this outlook that, on June 23, 1780, Essex County and Newark Militia were first warned that the British had launched an attack westward toward &quot;the Gap&quot;, (Hobart Gap), a natural pathway to Washington&#x27;s troops encamped at Morristown. In a pincer movement designed to gain access to the Gap, Hessian troops fought bitterly along Vaux Hall Road, while the British advanced along Galloping Hill Road, until they were repelled, the Hessians at the base of the mountain and the British in Springfield.

===Development===
In 1860, wolves, bears and cougars were observed in the area, and there was a bounty on them. In 1896, John Durand, the son of Asher Brown Durand, described the mountain that includes South Mountain Reservation

a wilderness, as it probably existed at the time of Hendrick Hudson, a primitive forest abounding with deer and other wild animals, and traversed by streams alive with trout. Game was plentiful—partridges, quail, woodcock, rabbits, squirrels of every species, raccoons and foxes; while occasionally a hungry bear that had trespassed on the farmyards in the vicinity would be tracked to its den and shot.

The reservation was built from land purchases begun in 1895. It took a decade to untangle the deeds and assemble all the lands at South Mountain. Before he delegated design of the Essex Parks to his stepson&#x27;s firm, Frederick Law Olmsted visited the newly acquired reservation. He regarded it as some of the most beautiful and promising terrain he had ever seen anywhere. The design of South Mountain was finalized by the Olmsted Brothers in stages over the years. A good deal of construction work—trails, footbridges, shelters, etc.—was undertaken by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s.

<doc id="1335973" wikidata="Q208671" url="?curid=1335973" title="Flag of Kurdistan">
<text>The flag of Kurdistan (, ) is the flag of Kurds and was created by the Society for the Rise of Kurdistan in 1920. It would later, in different variants, be adopted as the national flag of different Kurdish states including Republic of Ararat, Republic of Mahabad and most recently by Kurdistan Region in 1992. Moreover, the Kingdom of Kurdistan used the crescent flag (shown below) which was also considered a Kurdish flag.

==History==
=== Union Jack ===
In October 1918, near the end of World War I, Mahmud Barzanji broke away from the Ottoman Empire and established the Kurdish state. As it was initially subordinate to Britain, the polity flew the British Union Jack until it revolted in May 1919.
=== Crescent flag ===

In May 1919, the Kurdish State revolted against the British Empire, and adopted a crescent flag. The British Empire conquered the Kurdish state in June 1919.

After the establishment of the Kingdom of Kurdistan in 1921, The crescent flag was again hoisted in Sulaymaniyah by Mahmud Barzanji. According to historian Rafiq Hilmi, the Kingdom of Kurdistan considered the crescent flag as the national flag of Kurds. He wrote: &quot;A big meeting was held at the house of Şêx Qadir, the Speaker of the National Assembly, and with official permission, the official Kurdish flag was raised. On the day of the meeting, about 10,000 people gathered in front of the Grand Mosque.&quot;
=== CTK flag ===

This flag was created in 1920 by the Society for the Rise of Kurdistan (CTK). Shortly after, it was used by the nationalist party Xoybûn who hoisted the flag over the city of Ağrı during the Ararat rebellion. In his memoir &quot;Doza Kurdistan&quot;, Kurdish politician Kadri Cemilpaşa of the CTK declared that this flag was the national Kurdish flag whose colors and shape had now been defined. In 1925, during the trial of CTK politicians in Turkey, they stated that the Ottoman flag was dead and that the Kurdish flag would shine like a sun. 
=== Republic of Mahabad (1940s) ===

Prior to the declaration of the Republic of Mahabad from Iran in 1946, Kurdish leaders in Iran from Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan (KDPI) with support from Kurds in Iraq, had prepared the flag to be used as the national flag of the Mahabad Republic. The prepared flag was altered and approved by the KDPI who went on to hoist it in the official office of the Iranian government in Mahabad on 17 December 1945. When the republic was declared on 22 January 1946, the flag was hoisted at the main square while Ey Reqîb was being sung. In his speech, President Qazi Muhammad declared the flag as &quot;flag of Kurdistan&quot; and it was hoisted in all towns which was under his control. Days before the collapse of the republic, President Muhammad handed over the flag on his desk to Mustafa Barzani, leader of Kurdistan Democratic Party, who had fled to Mahabad after the 1943 Barzani revolt.
==Symbolism==
The Kurdish flag is the most important symbol of cohesive Kurdish identity. Since it was first hoisted in 1946 to represent the concept of an independent Kurdistan (called the Republic of Mahabad and founded in Iranian territory) it has become a symbol of the national identity of Kurds.

The main characteristic of the flag is the blazing golden sun emblem (&quot;Roj&quot; in Kurdish) at its center. The emblem&#x27;s sun disk has 21 rays, equal in size and shape, with the single odd ray at top and the two even rays on the bottom.

The symbolism of the colours is:
In the fall of 2006, the Iraqi Kurdish leadership gave orders for Kurdish officials to stop flying the Iraqi flag under decree number 60 &quot;to hoist the flag of Iraqi Kurdistan&quot;. Masoud Barzani issued orders that the Ba&#x27;athist flag should be lowered and all regions in Iraqi Kurdistan should &quot;hoist only the Kurdistan flag&quot; because the symbols of Ba&#x27;athism were associated with the Anfal genocide where 180,000 people died. When the Ba&#x27;athist symbols were removed from the Iraqi flag in 2008, the KRG hoisted the Iraqi flag to fly alongside the Kurdish flag, reported to still be the practice as of March 2013. Flying the Iraqi flag side by side with the Kurdish flag is symbolic of their acceptance of Iraqi federalism.

==Modern adaptation to international flag standards==
The flag appeared in Kurdish media throughout the 1990s with MED TV, Kurdsat, Kurdistan TV and their affiliates broadcasting with the flag appearing frequently in their programming allowing it to become a symbol of Kurdish statehood.

==Other flags used by Kurds==
==Similar flags==
Due to Iranian roots of the Kurds, the colours used in flags used by Kurds are the same that are used in other Iranian-origin areas like Iran and Tajikistan, known as Pan-Iranian colors.
==Kurdistan Region&#x27;s flag day ==
Since 1993, the Kurdish Flag Day is celebrated on December 17.

<doc id="1335974" wikidata="Q4102677" url="?curid=1335974" title="Vacuum arc">
<text>A vacuum arc can arise when the surfaces of metal electrodes in contact with a good vacuum begin to emit electrons either through heating (thermionic emission) or in an electric field that is sufficient to cause field electron emission. Once initiated, a vacuum arc can persist, since the freed particles gain kinetic energy from the electric field, heating the metal surfaces through high-speed particle collisions. This process can create an incandescent cathode spot, which frees more particles, thereby sustaining the arc. At sufficiently high currents an incandescent anode spot may also be formed.

Electric discharge in vacuum is important for certain types of vacuum tubes and for high-voltage vacuum switches.

The thermionic vacuum arc (TVA) is a new type of plasma source, which generates a plasma containing ions with a directed energy. TVA discharges can be ignited in high-vacuum conditions between a heated cathode (electron gun) and an anode (tungsten crucible) containing the material. The accelerated electron beam, incident on the anode, heats the crucible, together with its contents, to a high temperature. After establishing a steady-state density of the evaporating anode material atoms, and when the voltage applied is high enough, a bright discharge is ignited between the electrodes.

<text>The Lizzie McGuire Movie (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) is a soundtrack album to the 2003 film &quot;The Lizzie McGuire Movie&quot;. It was released on April 22, 2003, by Walt Disney Records.

==Music==
It is composed primarily of songs from (or inspired by) the film, including Hilary Duff&#x27;s &quot;Why Not&quot; and her sister Haylie&#x27;s &quot;Girl in the Band&quot;. &quot;Why Not&quot; was released to Radio Disney on March 21, 2003. It was released in Australia and Europe on June 23, 2003. A version of &quot;Why Not&quot; featuring different lyrics in the first verse was later included on Duff&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Metamorphosis&quot;. Duff referred to &quot;Why Not&quot; as &quot;a song that I really love. It&#x27;s really fun, and about just letting loose, so it&#x27;s really cool&quot;.

==Critical reception==
Heather Phares of AllMusic called &quot;The Lizzie McGuire Movie Soundtrack&quot; a &quot;fun but not especially memorable soundtrack&quot;.

==Commercial performance==
Two weeks after its release, &quot;The Lizzie McGuire Movie&quot; was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of over 500,000 copies in the United States. The soundtrack was number ten on the week of May 14, selling 92,900 copies, which was 30% gain over the previous week. The next week saw a sales decrease of 16% to 78,000 copies, despite raising two spots to number eight. On the week of May 28, the soundtrack remained at number eight, selling an additional 77,000 copies. The album has been certified platinum by the CRIA, and 2× platinum by the RIAA for selling 2,000,000 copies in the U.S.

<doc id="1335984" wikidata="Q903923" url="?curid=1335984" title="Dendrimer">
<text>Dendrimers are highly ordered, branched polymeric molecules. Synonymous terms for dendrimer include arborols and cascade molecules. Typically, dendrimers are symmetric about the core, and often adopt a spherical three-dimensional morphology. The word dendron is also encountered frequently. A dendron usually contains a single chemically addressable group called the focal point or core. The difference between dendrons and dendrimers is illustrated in the top figure, but the terms are typically encountered interchangeably.



The first dendrimers were made by divergent synthesis approaches by Fritz Vögtle in 1978, R.G. Denkewalter at Allied Corporation in 1981, Donald Tomalia at Dow Chemical in 1983 and in 1985, and by George R. Newkome in 1985. In 1990 a convergent synthetic approach was introduced by Craig Hawker and Jean Fréchet. Dendrimer popularity then greatly increased, resulting in more than 5,000 scientific papers and patents by the year 2005.

==Properties==

Dendritic molecules are characterized by structural perfection. Dendrimers and dendrons are monodisperse and usually highly symmetric, spherical compounds. The field of dendritic molecules can be roughly divided into low-molecular weight and high-molecular weight species. The first category includes dendrimers and dendrons, and the latter includes dendronized polymers, hyperbranched polymers, and the polymer brush.

The properties of dendrimers are dominated by the functional groups on the molecular surface, however, there are examples of dendrimers with internal functionality. Dendritic encapsulation of functional molecules allows for the isolation of the active site, a structure that mimics that of active sites in biomaterials. Also, it is possible to make dendrimers water-soluble, unlike most polymers, by functionalizing their outer shell with charged species or other hydrophilic groups. Other controllable properties of dendrimers include toxicity, crystallinity, tecto-dendrimer formation, and chirality.

Dendrimers are also classified by generation, which refers to the number of repeated branching cycles that are performed during its synthesis. For example, if a dendrimer is made by convergent synthesis (see below), and the branching reactions are performed onto the core molecule three times, the resulting dendrimer is considered a third generation dendrimer. Each successive generation results in a dendrimer roughly twice the molecular weight of the previous generation. Higher generation dendrimers also have more exposed functional groups on the surface, which can later be used to customize the dendrimer for a given application. Dendrimers may have a single surface functional group, or may be modified to allow for multiple functional groups on the surface.

==Synthesis==

One of the first dendrimers, the Newkome dendrimer, was synthesized in 1985. This macromolecule is also commonly known by the name arborol. The figure outlines the mechanism of the first two generations of arborol through a divergent route (discussed below). The synthesis is started by nucleophilic substitution of 1-bromopentane by &quot;triethyl sodiomethanetricarboxylate&quot; in dimethylformamide and benzene. The ester groups were then reduced by lithium aluminium hydride to a triol in a deprotection step. Activation of the chain ends was achieved by converting the alcohol groups to tosylate groups with tosyl chloride and pyridine. The tosyl group then served as leaving groups in another reaction with the tricarboxylate, forming generation two. Further repetition of the two steps leads to higher generations of arborol.

Poly(amidoamine), or PAMAM, is perhaps the most well known dendrimer. The core of PAMAM is a diamine (commonly ethylenediamine), which is reacted with methyl acrylate, and then another ethylenediamine to make the generation-0 (G-0) PAMAM. Successive reactions create higher generations, which tend to have different properties. Lower generations can be thought of as flexible molecules with no appreciable inner regions, while medium-sized (G-3 or G-4) do have internal space that is essentially separated from the outer shell of the dendrimer. Very large (G-7 and greater) dendrimers can be thought of more like solid particles with very dense surfaces due to the structure of their outer shell. The functional group on the surface of PAMAM dendrimers is ideal for click chemistry, which gives rise to many potential applications.

Dendrimers can be considered to have three major portions: a core, an inner shell, and an outer shell. Ideally, a dendrimer can be synthesized to have different functionality in each of these portions to control properties such as solubility, thermal stability, and attachment of compounds for particular applications. Synthetic processes can also precisely control the size and number of branches on the dendrimer. There are two defined methods of dendrimer synthesis, divergent synthesis and convergent synthesis. However, because the actual reactions consist of many steps needed to protect the active site, it is difficult to synthesize dendrimers using either method. This makes dendrimers hard to make and very expensive to purchase. At this time, there are only a few companies that sell dendrimers; Polymer Factory Sweden AB commercializes biocompatible bis-MPA dendrimers and Dendritech is the only kilogram-scale producers of PAMAM dendrimers. NanoSynthons, LLC from Mount Pleasant, Michigan, USA produces PAMAM dendrimers and other proprietary dendrimers.

===Divergent methods===

The dendrimer is assembled from a multifunctional core, which is extended outward by a series of reactions, commonly a Michael reaction. Each step of the reaction must be driven to full completion to prevent mistakes in the dendrimer, which can cause trailing generations (some branches are shorter than the others). Such impurities can impact the functionality and symmetry of the dendrimer, but are extremely difficult to purify out because the relative size difference between perfect and imperfect dendrimers is very small.

===Convergent methods===

Dendrimers are built from small molecules that end up at the surface of the sphere, and reactions proceed inward building inward and are eventually attached to a core. This method makes it much easier to remove impurities and shorter branches along the way, so that the final dendrimer is more monodisperse. However dendrimers made this way are not as large as those made by divergent methods because crowding due to steric effects along the core is limiting.

===Click chemistry===

Dendrimers have been prepared via click chemistry, employing Diels-Alder reactions, thiol-ene and thiol-yne reactions and azide-alkyne reactions.

There are ample avenues that can be opened by exploring this chemistry in dendrimer synthesis.

==Applications==

Applications of dendrimers typically involve conjugating other chemical species to the dendrimer surface that can function as detecting agents (such as a dye molecule), affinity ligands, targeting components, radioligands, imaging agents, or pharmaceutically active compounds. Dendrimers have very strong potential for these applications because their structure can lead to multivalent systems. In other words, one dendrimer molecule has hundreds of possible sites to couple to an active species. Researchers aimed to utilize the hydrophobic environments of the dendritic media to conduct photochemical reactions that generate the products that are synthetically challenged. Carboxylic acid and phenol-terminated water-soluble dendrimers were synthesized to establish their utility in drug delivery as well as conducting chemical reactions in their interiors. This might allow researchers to attach both targeting molecules and drug molecules to the same dendrimer, which could reduce negative side effects of medications on healthy cells.

Dendrimers can also be used as a solubilizing agent. Since their introduction in the mid-1980s, this novel class of dendrimer architecture has been a prime candidate for host–guest chemistry. Dendrimers with hydrophobic core and hydrophilic periphery have shown to exhibit micelle-like behavior and have container properties in solution. The use of dendrimers as unimolecular micelles was proposed by Newkome in 1985. This analogy highlighted the utility of dendrimers as solubilizing agents. The majority of drugs available in pharmaceutical industry are hydrophobic in nature and this property in particular creates major formulation problems. This drawback of drugs can be ameliorated by dendrimeric scaffolding, which can be used to encapsulate as well as to solubilize the drugs because of the capability of such scaffolds to participate in extensive hydrogen bonding with water. Dendrimer labs are trying to manipulate dendrimer&#x27;s solubilizing trait, to explore dendrimers for drug delivery and to target specific carriers.

For dendrimers to be able to be used in pharmaceutical applications, they must surmount the required regulatory hurdles to reach market. One dendrimer scaffold designed to achieve this is the polyethoxyethylglycinamide (PEE-G) dendrimer. This dendrimer scaffold has been designed and shown to have high HPLC purity, stability, aqueous solubility and low inherent toxicity.

===Drug delivery===

Approaches for delivering unaltered natural products using polymeric carriers is of widespread interest. Dendrimers have been explored for the encapsulation of hydrophobic compounds and for the delivery of anticancer drugs. The physical characteristics of dendrimers, including their monodispersity, water solubility, encapsulation ability, and large number of functionalizable peripheral groups make these macromolecules appropriate candidates for drug delivery vehicles.

==== Role of dendrimer chemical modifications in drug delivery ====
Dendrimers are particularly versatile drug delivery devices due to the wide range of chemical modifications that can be made to increase in vivo suitability and allow for site-specific targeted drug delivery.

Drug attachment to the dendrimer may be accomplished by (1) a covalent attachment or conjugation to the external surface of the dendrimer forming a dendrimer prodrug, (2) ionic coordination to charged outer functional groups, or (3) micelle-like encapsulation of a drug via a dendrimer-drug supramolecular assembly. In the case of a dendrimer prodrug structure, linking of a drug to a dendrimer may be direct or linker-mediated depending on desired release kinetics. Such a linker may be pH-sensitive, enzyme catalyzed, or a disulfide bridge. The wide range of terminal functional groups available for dendrimers allows for many different types of linker chemistries, providing yet another tunable component on the system. Key parameters to consider for linker chemistry are (1) release mechanism upon arrival to the target site, whether that be within the cell or in a certain organ system, (2) drug-dendrimer spacing so as to prevent lipophilic drugs from folding into the dendrimer, and (3) linker degradability and post-release trace modifications on drugs.

Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a common modification for dendrimers to modify their surface charge and circulation time. Surface charge can influence the interactions of dendrimers with biological systems, such as amine-terminal modified dendrimers which have a propensity to interact with cell membranes with anionic charge. Certain in vivo studies have shown polycationic dendrimers to be cytotoxic through membrane permeabilization, a phenomenon that could be partially mitigated via addition of PEGylation caps on amine groups, resulting in lower cytotoxicity and lower red blood cell hemolysis. Additionally, studies have found that PEGylation of dendrimers results in higher drug loading, slower drug release, longer circulation times in vivo, and lower toxicity in comparison to counterparts without PEG modifications.

Numerous targeting moieties have been used to modify dendrimer biodistribution and allow for targeting to specific organs. For example, folate receptors are overexpressed in tumor cells and are therefore promising targets for localized drug delivery of chemotherapeutics. Folic acid conjugation to PAMAM dendrimers has been shown to increase targeting and decrease off-target toxicity while maintaining on-target cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutics such as methotrexate, in mouse models of cancer.

Antibody-mediated targeting of dendrimers to cell targets has also shown promise for targeted drug delivery. As epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs) are often overexpressed in brain tumors, EGFRs are a convenient target for site-specific drug delivery. The delivery of boron to cancerous cells is important for effective neutron capture therapy, a cancer treatment which requires a large concentration of boron in cancerous cells and a low concentration in healthy cells. A boronated dendrimer conjugated with a monoclonal antibody drug that targets EGFRs was used in rats to successfully deliver boron to cancerous cells.

Modifying nanoparticle dendrimers with peptides has also been successful for targeted destruction of colorectal (HCT-116) cancer cells in a co-culture scenario. Targeting peptides can be used to achieve site- or cell-specific delivery, and it has been shown that these peptides increase in targeting specificity when paired with dendrimers. Specifically, gemcitabine-loaded YIGSR-CMCht/PAMAM, a unique kind of dendrimer nanoparticle, induces a targeted mortality on these cancer cells. This is performed via selective interaction of the dendrimer with laminin receptors. Peptide dendrimers may be employed in the future to precisely target cancer cells and deliver chemotherapeutic agents.

The cellular uptake mechanism of dendrimers can also be tuned using chemical targeting modifications. Non-modified PAMAM-G4 dendrimer is taken up into activated microglia by fluid phase endocytosis. Conversely, mannose modification of hydroxyl PAMAM-G4 dendrimers was able to change the mechanism of internalization to mannose-receptor (CD206) mediated endocytosis. Additionally, mannose modification was able to change the biodistribution in the rest of the body in rabbits.

==== Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics ====
Dendrimers have the potential to completely change the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) profiles of a drug. As carriers, the PK/PD is no longer determined by the drug itself but by the dendrimer’s localization, drug release, and dendrimer excretion. ADME properties are very highly tunable by varying dendrimer size, structure, and surface characteristics. While G9 dendrimers accumulate very heavily to the liver and spleen, G6 dendrimers tend to accumulate more broadly. As molecular weight increases, urinary clearance and plasma clearance decrease while terminal half-life increases.

==== Routes of delivery ====
To increase patient compliance with prescribed treatment, delivery of drugs orally is often preferred to other routes of drug administration. However oral bioavailability of many drugs tends to be very low. Dendrimers can be used to increase the solubility and stability of orally-administered drugs and increase drug penetration through the intestinal membrane. The bioavailability of PAMAM dendrimers conjugated to a chemotherapeutic has been studied in mice; it was found that around 9% of dendrimer administered orally was found intact in circulation and that minimal dendrimer degradation occurred in the gut.

Intravenous dendrimer delivery shows promise as gene vectors to deliver genes to various organs in the body, and even tumors. One study found that through intravenous injection, a combination of PPI dendrimers and gene complexes resulted in gene expression in the liver, and another study showed that a similar injection regressed the growth of tumors in observed animals.

The primary obstacle to transdermal drug delivery is the epidermis. Hydrophobic drugs have a very difficult time penetrating the skin layer, as they partition heavily into skin oils. Recently, PAMAM dendrimers have been used as delivery vehicles for NSAIDS to increase hydrophilicity, allowing greater drug penetration. These modifications act as polymeric transdermal enhancers allowing drugs to more easily penetrate the skin barrier.

Dendrimers may also act as new ophthalmic vehicles for drug delivery, which are different from the polymers currently used for this purpose. A study by Vanndamme and Bobeck used PAMAM dendrimers as ophthalmic delivery vehicles in rabbits for two model drugs and measured the ocular residence time of this delivery to be comparable and in some cases greater than current bioadhesive polymers used in ocular delivery. This result indicates that administered drugs were more active and had increased bioavailability when delivered via dendrimers than their free-drug counterparts. Additionally, photo-curable, drug-eluting dendrimer-hyaluronic acid hydrogels have been used as corneal sutures applied directly to the eye. These hydrogel sutures have shown efficacy as a medical device in rabbit models that surpasses traditional sutures and minimizes corneal scarring.

==== Brain drug delivery ====
Dendrimer drug delivery has also shown major promise as a potential solution for many traditionally difficult drug delivery problems. In the case of drug delivery to the brain, dendrimers are able to take advantage of the EPR effect and blood-brain barrier (BBB) impairment to cross the BBB effectively in vivo. For example, hydroxyl-terminated PAMAM dendrimers possess an intrinsic targeting ability to inflamed macrophages in the brain, verified using fluorescently labeled neutral generation dendrimers in a rabbit model of cerebral palsy. This intrinsic targeting has enabled drug delivery in a variety of conditions, ranging from cerebral palsy and other neuroinflammatory disorders to traumatic brain injury and hypothermic circulatory arrest, across a variety of animal models ranging from mice and rabbits to canines. Dendrimer uptake into the brain correlates with severity of inflammation and BBB impairment and it is believed that the BBB impairment is the key driving factor allowing dendrimer penetration. Localization is heavily skewed towards activated microglia. Dendrimer-conjugated N-acetyl cysteine has shown efficacy in vivo as an anti-inflammatory at more than 1000-fold lower dose than free drug on a drug basis, reversing the phenotype of cerebral palsy, Rett syndrome, macular degeneration and other inflammatory diseases.

==== Clinical trials ====
Starpharma, an Australian pharmaceutical company, has multiple products that have either already been approved for use or are in the clinical trial phase. SPL7013, also known as astodrimer sodium, is a hyperbranched polymer used in Starpharma’s VivaGel line of pharmaceuticals that is currently approved to treat bacterial vaginosis and prevent the spread of HIV, HPV, and HSV in Europe, Southeast Asia, Japan, Canada, and Australia. Due to SPL7013’s broad antiviral action, it has recently been tested by the company as a potential drug to treat SARS-CoV-2. The company states preliminary in-vitro studies show high efficacy in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection in cells.

===Gene delivery and transfection===
The ability to deliver pieces of DNA to the required parts of a cell includes many challenges. Current research is being performed to find ways to use dendrimers to traffic genes into cells without damaging or deactivating the DNA. To maintain the activity of DNA during dehydration, the dendrimer/DNA complexes were encapsulated in a water-soluble polymer, and then deposited on or sandwiched in functional polymer films with a fast degradation rate to mediate gene transfection. Based on this method, PAMAM dendrimer/DNA complexes were used to encapsulate functional biodegradable polymer films for substrate mediated gene delivery. Research has shown that the fast-degrading functional polymer has great potential for localized transfection.

===Sensors===
Dendrimers have potential applications in sensors. Studied systems include proton or pH sensors using poly(propylene imine), cadmium-sulfide/polypropylenimine tetrahexacontaamine dendrimer composites to detect fluorescence signal quenching, and poly(propylenamine) first and second generation dendrimers for metal cation photodetection amongst others. Research in this field is vast and ongoing due to the potential for multiple detection and binding sites in dendritic structures.

===Nanoparticles===
Dendrimers also are used in the synthesis of monodisperse metallic nanoparticles. Poly(amidoamine), or PAMAM, dendrimers are utilized for their tertiary amine groups at the branching points within the dendrimer. Metal ions are introduced to an aqueous dendrimer solution and the metal ions form a complex with the lone pair of electrons present at the tertiary amines. After complexation, the ions are reduced to their zerovalent states to form a nanoparticle that is encapsulated within the dendrimer. These nanoparticles range in width from 1.5 to 10 nanometers and are called dendrimer-encapsulated nanoparticles.

=== Other applications ===
Given the widespread use of pesticides, herbicides and insecticides in modern farming, dendrimers are also being used by companies to help improve the delivery of agrochemicals to enable healthier plant growth and to help fight plant diseases.

Dendrimers are also being investigated for use as blood substitutes. Their steric bulk surrounding a heme-mimetic centre significantly slows degradation compared to free heme, and prevents the cytotoxicity exhibited by free heme.
Dendritic functional polymer polyamidoamine (PAMAM) is used to prepare core shell structure i.e. microcapsules and utilized in formulation of self-healing coatings of conventional and renewable origins.

Different generations of polyamidoamine dendrimers have recently been implemented as selective contacts in photovoltaic devices. 

===Drug delivery===
Dendrimers in drug-delivery systems is an example of various host–guest interactions. The interaction between host and guest, the dendrimer and the drug, respectively, can either be hydrophobic or covalent. Hydrophobic interaction between host and guest is considered &quot;encapsulated,&quot; while covalent interactions are considered to be conjugated. The use of dendrimers in medicine has shown to improve drug delivery by increasing the solubility and bioavailability of the drug. In conjunction, dendrimers can increase both cellular uptake and targeting ability, and decrease drug resistance.

The solubility of various nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) increases when they are encapsulated in PAMAM dendrimers. This study shows the enhancement of NSAID solubility is due to the electrostatic interactions between the surface amine groups in PAMAM and the carboxyl groups found in NSAIDs. Contributing to the increase in solubility are the hydrophobic interactions between the aromatic groups in the drugs and the interior cavities of the dendrimer. When a drug is encapsulated within a dendrimer, its physical and physiological properties remains unaltered, including non-specificity and toxicity. However, when the dendrimer and the drug are covalently linked together, it can be used for specific tissue targeting and controlled release rates. Covalent conjugation of multiple drugs on dendrimer surfaces can pose a problem of insolubility.

This principle is also being studied for cancer treatment application. Several groups have encapsulated anti-cancer medications such as: Camptothecin, Methotrexate, and Doxorubicin. Results from these research has shown that dendrimers have increased aqueous solubility, slowed release rate, and possibly control cytotoxicity of the drugs. Cisplatin has been conjugated to PAMAM dendrimers that resulted in the same pharmacological results as listed above, but the conjugation also helped in accumulating cisplatin in solid tumors in intravenous administration.

<doc id="1335985" wikidata="Q470727" url="?curid=1335985" title="Martin Taylor (footballer, born 1979)">
<text>Martin Taylor (born 9 November 1979) is an English retired footballer who played as a defender.

Taylor began his career with Blackburn Rovers, for whom he made more than 100 appearances, and also spent time on loan at Darlington and Stockport County. While a Blackburn player, he was capped once for the England under-21 team and played on the winning side in the 2002 Football League Cup final. Taylor moved to Birmingham City in 2004, where he spent six seasons, and played for Norwich City on loan. He was involved in an incident in 2008 in which Arsenal player Eduardo da Silva suffered a badly broken leg. Unable to force his way into Birmingham&#x27;s first team after their return to the Premier League, he joined Watford in January 2010. Taylor quickly established himself in Watford&#x27;s first team, starting every league game in the 2010–11 season, but injury disrupted his next season, and he joined Sheffield Wednesday in August 2012. He played infrequently for Wednesday, spent time on loan at Brentford, and was released at the end of the 2013–14 season, and subsequently retired.

==Club career==

===Blackburn Rovers===
Taylor was born in Ashington, Northumberland, and attended Cramlington High School. He played football for Cramlington Juniors before joining Blackburn Rovers as a schoolboy at the age of 17, signing his first full contract at the start of the 1997–98 season.

Loan spells at Darlington and Stockport served to improve his self-belief, and in May 2001 he won his first and only cap for the England under-21 side, as a half-time substitute for John Terry in a 3–0 friendly win against Mexico. Though brought into the squad for the 2002 European under-21 championships to replace the injured Ledley King, he made no further international appearances.

Also in 2002, he played throughout Blackburn&#x27;s League Cup campaign, culminating in a 2–1 victory over Tottenham Hotspur at the Millennium Stadium.

Blackburn manager Graeme Souness felt that Taylor had enough ability to reach the top, but had for some time believed that without adopting a more aggressive physical approach – one befitting his frame, which caused his teammates to nickname him &quot;Tiny&quot; – he would not fulfil his potential. He had been viewed as a potential replacement for defenders Henning Berg and Craig Short, but, as Berg left the side, Souness signed Lorenzo Amoruso, because he felt that Blackburn needed experienced centre-backs, and then took Markus Babbel on loan.

Though injuries among his defenders made him reluctant to sell, Souness needed to generate transfer funds, so in January 2004, Blackburn accepted a £1.25 million bid from Birmingham City.

===Birmingham City===
On 2 February 2004, Taylor left Blackburn for Birmingham City, signing a contract due to end in 2007. He linked up with former Blackburn teammates David Dunn and Damien Johnson highlighted Taylor&#x27;s footballing ability and comfort on the ball. Rob Kelly, then head of youth coaching at Blackburn, while complimentary about his reading of the game and ability with both feet, felt that working with Birmingham manager Steve Bruce, a former top-class centre-half, in new surroundings might help bring out his unfulfilled potential, an assessment with which Taylor himself agreed.

He made his Birmingham debut in a 3–0 victory against Everton, and in his next game, a 3–1 victory against Middlesbrough, he scored his first league goal for the club. Unable to dislodge the established central defensive partnership of Matthew Upson and Kenny Cunningham, he played regularly for the remainder of the season, but mainly in his less favoured position of right back.

When Bruce brought Taylor to Birmingham he mentioned his admiration for the player&#x27;s ability to play in any defensive position; this versatility ideally suited him to a backup role in the event of injury to any of the first choice defenders. In the 2004–05 season, the form and fitness of Upson and Cunningham, together with the arrival of Dutch international fullback Mario Melchiot from Chelsea, considerably restricted Taylor&#x27;s appearances. In the second half of the 2005–06 season he had a long run in the side due to Upson&#x27;s ankle injury, a run which coincided with some of Birmingham&#x27;s better performances.

The departure of Cunningham and Melchiot following Birmingham&#x27;s relegation from the Premier League, with Upson still injured long-term, provided an opportunity for Taylor to establish his first-team place alongside newly arrived Bruno Ngotty. But Bruce also recruited Tunisian international Radhi Jaïdi, and preferred the more robust physical approach of Olivier Tébily while Jaïdi built up match fitness. However, Ngotty&#x27;s suspension proved the catalyst for an upturn in fortunes for Taylor. He was named captain after Damien Johnson suffered a broken jaw, and his rapport with fellow centre-back Jaïdi helped Birmingham to maintain a strong position in the Championship in the 2006–07 season. In recognition of his value to the club, in April 2007 he signed a new three-year contract with an option for a further two years.

====Norwich City loan====
With Birmingham back in the Premier League for 2007–08, competition for places meant that Taylor did not play in a single league game in the first two months of the season. On 1 November 2007, he became new Norwich City manager Glenn Roeder&#x27;s first signing, joining on a month&#x27;s loan. In his debut game, against East Anglian rivals Ipswich Town three days later, Taylor played a large role in his side&#x27;s first goal: his header was deflected in off defender Owen Garvan, who was credited with an own goal. Taylor scored with a diving header against Blackpool and added considerable solidity at the back for Norwich. Though Norwich hoped to extend the loan, this was not possible, so Taylor returned to Birmingham at the end of the initial month.

Following Alex McLeish&#x27;s arrival as Birmingham manager, Taylor was told that he was surplus to requirements; the club accepted an offer from Queens Park Rangers, reported at £1.25 million, but the player rejected it. However, injury to Rafael Schmitz, Jaïdi&#x27;s absence on international duty and McLeish&#x27;s failure to sign any of his defensive targets gave Taylor a first league start of the season in a 1–1 draw with Derby County in January 2008. He kept his place for the next match despite the availability of Schmitz and Jaïdi, and his impressive form left him in McLeish&#x27;s plans for the remainder of the season.

====Eduardo broken leg incident====
On 23 February 2008, in the third minute of Birmingham&#x27;s home match against Arsenal, Taylor committed a foul on Croatian international striker Eduardo da Silva as a result of which Eduardo suffered a compound fracture to his left fibula and an open dislocation of his left ankle. He received treatment on the field for seven minutes before undergoing surgery at a local hospital, and was transferred to a London hospital the following day. The injury was so disturbing that Sky Sports, who were broadcasting the game live, decided not to show replays of the incident. Taylor was sent off for the offence.

In his post-match interview, Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger called for a life ban for Taylor, but retracted his remarks later that day, admitting they had been excessive and made in the heat of the moment. Shortly after the match, Birmingham City issued a statement asserting Taylor&#x27;s lack of malicious intent and his distress at the injury, and sending their best wishes to Eduardo. While Croatia captain Niko Kovač referred to the &quot;brutality&quot; of the incident and death threats appeared on the internet, Birmingham manager Alex McLeish and Arsenal striker Nicklas Bendtner, a former teammate of Taylor&#x27;s, insisted that he was not a malicious player, and former manager Steve Bruce claimed that some might question whether Taylor even deserved a booking.

At president Sepp Blatter&#x27;s personal request, FIFA&#x27;s disciplinary chairman reviewed the matter, suggesting that the Football Association increase Taylor&#x27;s punishment from the standard three-match ban; they refused to do so as there was no suggestion of intent.

===Watford===
Taylor joined Championship club Watford on a free transfer on 29 January 2010. He signed a two-and-a-half-year contract. He made his Watford debut on 2 February, playing the full 90 minutes against Sheffield United at Vicarage Road. Watford won the match 3–0, with Taylor&#x27;s commanding display helping towards their first win whilst keeping a clean sheet for over two months. He scored his first goal for Watford in a 2–0 win over Bristol City the following week.

After USA defender Jay DeMerit left the club, Taylor and Adrian Mariappa were manager Malky Mackay&#x27;s preferred central defensive partnership for the 2010–11 season. Despite struggling with injury towards the end of the season, Taylor was able to start all 46 of Watford&#x27;s league games. He also played a further three games in other competitions and scored six league goals. Taylor was noted for his consistency during the season, and finished second in the voting for Watford F.C. Player of the Season behind Championship top-scorer Danny Graham.

Taylor scored his first goal of the 2011–12 season on 28 August, in a 2–2 draw against former club Birmingham City. A dislocated collarbone suffered in October after a collision during Watford&#x27;s home game against Crystal Palace kept him out for three months, and his return was further delayed when he broke his toe in a friendly in January 2012. He finally returned to league action at West Ham United in early March, as substitute for the concussed Dale Bennett, and was made captain for his first start since the injury, away to Bristol City two weeks later. At the end of the season, Taylor signed a new one-year contract with Watford.

===Sheffield Wednesday===

On 31 August 2012, Taylor signed a two-year deal to take him to newly promoted Championship side Sheffield Wednesday for an undisclosed fee. He made only thirteen appearances for Wednesday in his first season, the last of which came in mid-February 2013 against former club Birmingham City.

Taylor did not feature for the first month of Wednesday&#x27;s 2013–14 season, and signed for League One side Brentford on 10 September on loan for a month. He made his debut on 14 September at Tranmere Rovers and scored within the first two minutes, beating the club record for fastest goal on league debut; Brentford won 4–3. He scored again on his third appearance, netting the second goal in a 2–0 victory over Coventry City on 29 September. His loan deal was renewed for a second month, during which he lost his place, and returned to Wednesday having played five league games and once in the Football League Trophy. He was released at the end of the season without making any further first-team appearances, and subsequently retired from professional football.

<text>Leslie Spit Treeo were a Canadian folk-rock band in the 1980s and 1990s. The band took its name from the Leslie Street Spit area of Toronto Harbour.

==History==
The band originally consisted of vocalist Laura Hubert, guitarist Pat Langner and guitarist Jack (J.D.) Nicholsen. Tag, a dog, was the band&#x27;s mascot, was listed as their official manager, and was sometimes directly credited as a contributing musician as some of the band&#x27;s songs incorporated Tag&#x27;s barking, growling or whining into the mix. They first began rehearsing as a band on the Leslie Street Spit, a public park area where they could bring Tag. All three of the human members had a background in theatre, as either actors or writers.

They began as a street busking collective, sometimes with Graeme Kirkland contributing on drums, and won a role in Bruce McDonald&#x27;s 1989 film &quot;Roadkill&quot;, playing buskers in a field performing their song &quot;The Sound&quot;. They signed to Capitol Records and released their debut album &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry Too Hard&quot; in 1990, garnering airplay on rock radio stations with a cover of John Prine&#x27;s &quot;Angel from Montgomery&quot; and with their own original song &quot;UFO/Catch the Highway&quot;. They subsequently won a Juno Award for Most Promising Group at the Juno Awards of 1991. Around the same time, Nicholsen had an acting role in the film &quot;Perfectly Normal&quot;.

For their follow-up album, 1992&#x27;s &quot;Book of Rejection&quot;, the band brought in guests Jason Sniderman on keyboards, Frank Randazzo on bass and Joel Anderson on drums. That album included some songs from &quot;The Book of Rejection&quot;, a theatrical show the band had collaborated on with actors Daniel Brooks, Don McKellar and Tracy Wright, and included the band&#x27;s biggest hit, &quot;In Your Eyes&quot;, a Top 20 hit in the fall of 1992 which featured Randy Bachman on guitar. But they felt that they lost creative control of the recording process, and broke their seven-album recording contract.

Nicholsen left the band in 1993 to focus on his acting career, notably appearing as Val in the 1994 film &quot;The Last Supper&quot; and as Mike Lout in &quot;Jasper, Texas&quot;. With the core of the band now down to the duo of Langner and Hubert, their 1994 indie album &quot;Hell&#x27;s Kitchen&quot; was initially credited to The Spits since the band were no longer a &quot;treeo&quot;, but when initial sales were slower than expected, it was re-released under the band&#x27;s original name.

In 1995 the band appeared in another McDonald film, &quot;Dance Me Outside&quot;, again playing themselves in concert.

In 1996, the band released the double album &quot;Chocolate Chip Cookies&quot; in a cookie bag package that closely resembled Chips Ahoy! packaging; after Nabisco threatened the band with a lawsuit, the band burned all the packaging in a bonfire in Toronto&#x27;s High Park and created a new cookie bag that did not resemble Chips Ahoy!. They re-released the album the following year in a conventional jewel case, with Tag on the cover. For that album&#x27;s supporting tour, Langner and Hubert were joined by guitarist Jason Reed, bassist Shaun Noronha and drummer Vince Montagano.

&quot;Chocolate Chip Cookies&quot; was the band&#x27;s last album. Hubert has released three solo jazz recordings and is a fixture on the Toronto jazz scene. Langner is a writer. Nicholsen, who has always been credited as J.D. Nicholsen, Jack Nichols or Jack Matthews in acting roles to avoid any potential confusion with the more famous actor Jack Nicholson, continues to act and sings with The Cameron Family Singers. Tag died in 2000, and was cited as the pretext for the band&#x27;s breakup.

<doc id="1335998" wikidata="Q1552150" url="?curid=1335998" title="Meimad">
<text>Meimad (, an acronym for &quot;Medina Yehudit, Medina Demokratit&quot; (), lit., &quot;Jewish State, Democratic State&quot;) is a moderate to left-wing religious Zionist political party in Israel. Founded in 1999, it is based on the ideology of the Meimad movement founded in 1988 by Rabbi Yehuda Amital. It was formed by religious Zionists who supported the peace process and believed the National Religious Party had drifted too far to the right.

At the national level, it was in alliance with the Labor Party, and until the 2006 election, received the 10th spot on the Labor Knesset list. Meimad ended the pact with the 2009 election, formed an alliance with the Green Movement, and failed to win enough votes to be elected to the Knesset.

==History==
The Meimad movement was founded on 1 June 1988 by Rabbi Yehuda Amital, and included former National Religious Party Knesset member Yehuda Ben-Meir. It emerged from &quot;Oz ve Shalom&quot;, an Orthodox Jewish peace movement. It contested the 1988 Knesset elections, receiving 0.7% of the vote and failing to cross the 1% electoral threshold.

Eleven years later, a political party for the movement was established, and joined the One Israel alliance that won the Knesset elections that year. Meimad received one seat, taken by Michael Melchior. It gained a second when Yehuda Gilad replaced Maxim Levy in 2002. Tova Ilan also represented Meimad in the Knesset for a brief spell in 2006, after several other Labor MKs resigned. It attracted moderates among immigrants from the English-speaking world, including Shimon Glick.

In November 2008, minister and former Labor Party member Ami Ayalon joined Meimad. In the same month, the party ended its alliance with Labor after being told that 10th spot on the list would no longer be reserved for Meimad for the 2009 legislative elections.

Shortly afterwards, Ayalon announced his resignation from politics, and the party formed an umbrella alliance with the Green Movement.

In 2012, Melchior announced that he would not stand for election. The party was revived in 2018.

==Ideology==
The party emphasizes the values of many social democratic parties, except on religious issues. Meimad, like Labor, takes a centre-left approach to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. However, it supports religious studies in the main curriculum of Israel&#x27;s public schools, and encourages the use of rabbinical courts in addition to civil courts.

Under Melchior, the party has taken an even more left-leaning approach—both in foreign and, especially, in domestic affairs. The party has run in municipal elections in 2003, winning a number of key seats in Tel Aviv. It also ran together with Meretz party in Haifa in which it shares a seat under a rotation agreement. Shlomo Yaakov Rapaport serves on the Haifa city council representing Meimad, and is the chairman of the Haifa Aliyah and absorption committee, and the chairman of the municipal committee against alcohol and drug abuse.

<doc id="1336000" wikidata="Q2912114" url="?curid=1336000" title="Cartan subalgebra">
<text>In mathematics, a Cartan subalgebra, often abbreviated as CSA, is a nilpotent subalgebra formula_1 of a Lie algebra formula_2 that is self-normalising (if formula_3 for all formula_4, then formula_5). They were introduced by Élie Cartan in his doctoral thesis. It controls the representation theory of a semi-simple Lie algebra formula_2 over a field of characteristic formula_7.

In a finite-dimensional semisimple Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero (e.g., a Cartan subalgebra is the same thing as a maximal abelian subalgebra consisting of elements &quot;x&quot; such that the adjoint endomorphism formula_8 is semisimple (i.e., diagonalizable). Sometimes this characterization is simply taken as the definition of a Cartan subalgebra.pg 231

In general, a subalgebra is called toral if it consists of semisimple elements. Over an algebraically closed field, a toral subalgebra is automatically abelian. Thus, over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, a Cartan subalgebra can also be defined as a maximal toral subalgebra.

Kac–Moody algebras and generalized Kac–Moody algebras also have subalgebras that play the same role as the Cartan subalgebras of semisimple Lie algebras (over a field of characteristic zero).

== Existence and uniqueness ==
Cartan subalgebras exist for finite-dimensional Lie algebras whenever the base field is infinite. One way to construct a Cartan subalgebra is by means of a regular element. Over a finite field, the question of the existence is still open.

For a finite-dimensional semisimple Lie algebra formula_9 over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, there is a simpler approach: by definition, a toral subalgebra is a subalgebra of formula_9 that consists of semisimple elements (an element is semisimple if the adjoint endomorphism induced by it is diagonalizable). A Cartan subalgebra of formula_9 is then the same thing as a maximal toral subalgebra and the existence of a maximal toral subalgebra is easy to see.

In a finite-dimensional Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, all Cartan subalgebras are conjugate under automorphisms of the algebra, and in particular are all isomorphic. The common dimension of a Cartan subalgebra is then called the rank of the algebra.

For a finite-dimensional complex semisimple Lie algebra, the existence of a Cartan subalgebra is much simpler to establish, assuming the existence of a compact real form. In that case, formula_1 may be taken as the complexification of the Lie algebra of a maximal torus of the compact group.

If formula_2 is a linear Lie algebra (a Lie subalgebra of the Lie algebra of endomorphisms of a finite-dimensional vector space &quot;V&quot;) over an algebraically closed field, then any Cartan subalgebra of formula_2 is the centralizer of a maximal toral subalgebra of formula_2. If formula_2 is semisimple and the field has characteristic zero, then a maximal toral subalgebra is self-normalizing, and so is equal to the associated Cartan subalgebra. If in addition formula_9 is semisimple, then the adjoint representation presents formula_9 as a linear Lie algebra, so that a subalgebra of formula_9 is Cartan if and only if it is a maximal toral subalgebra.

== Examples ==

*Any nilpotent Lie algebra is its own Cartan subalgebra.
*A Cartan subalgebra of formula_20, the Lie algebra of formula_21 matrices over a field, is the algebra of all diagonal matrices.
*For the special Lie algebra of traceless formula_21 matrices formula_23, it has the Cartan subalgebra formula_24 where formula_25 For example, in formula_26 the Cartan subalgebra is the subalgebra of matrices formula_27 with Lie bracket given by the matrix commutator.
*The Lie algebra formula_28 of formula_29 by formula_29 matrices of trace formula_31 has two non-conjugate Cartan subalgebras.
*The dimension of a Cartan subalgebra is not in general the maximal dimension of an abelian subalgebra, even for complex simple Lie algebras. For example, the Lie algebra formula_32of formula_33 by formula_33 matrices of trace formula_31 has a Cartan subalgebra of rank formula_36 but has a maximal abelian subalgebra of dimension formula_37 consisting of all matrices of the form formula_38 with formula_39 any formula_40 by formula_40 matrix. One can directly see this abelian subalgebra is not a Cartan subalgebra, since it is contained in the nilpotent algebra of strictly upper triangular matrices (or, since it is normalized by diagonal matrices).

== Cartan subalgebras of semisimple Lie algebras ==
For finite-dimensional semisimple Lie algebra formula_9 over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0, a Cartan subalgebra formula_43 has the following properties:
*formula_43 is abelian,
*For the adjoint representation formula_45, the image formula_46 consists of semisimple operators (i.e., diagonalizable matrices).
(As noted earlier, a Cartan subalgebra can in fact be characterized as a subalgebra that is maximal among those having the above two properties.)

These two properties say that the operators in formula_46 are simultaneously diagonalizable and that there is a direct sum decomposition of formula_2 as
:formula_49
where 
:formula_50.

Let formula_51. Then formula_52 is a root system and, moreover, formula_53; i.e., the centralizer of formula_1 coincides with formula_1. The above decomposition can then be written as:
:formula_56
As it turns out, for each formula_57, formula_58 has dimension one and so:
:formula_59.

See also Semisimple Lie algebra#Structure for further information.

=== Decomposing representations with dual Cartan subalgebra ===
Given a Lie algebra formula_2 over a field of characteristic and a Lie algebra representationformula_61 there is a decomposition related to the decomposition of the Lie algebra from its Cartan subalgebra. If we set
formula_62
with formula_63, called the weight space for weight formula_64, there is a decomposition of the representation in terms of these weight spaces formula_65 In addition, whenever formula_66 we call formula_67 a weight of the formula_2-representation 

==== Classification of irreducible representations using weights ====

But, it turns out these weights can be used to classify the irreducible representations of the Lie algebra formula_2. For a finite dimensional irreducible formula_2-representation there exists a unique weight formula_57 with respect to a partial ordering on formula_72. Moreover, given a formula_57 such that formula_74 for every positive root there exists a unique irreducible representation This means the root system formula_52 contains all information about the representation theory of 

== Splitting Cartan subalgebra ==
Over non-algebraically closed fields, not all Cartan subalgebras are conjugate. An important class are splitting Cartan subalgebras: if a Lie algebra admits a splitting Cartan subalgebra formula_1 then it is called &quot;splittable,&quot; and the pair formula_77 is called a split Lie algebra; over an algebraically closed field every semisimple Lie algebra is splittable. Any two splitting Cartan algebras are conjugate, and they fulfill a similar function to Cartan algebras in semisimple Lie algebras over algebraically closed fields, so split semisimple Lie algebras (indeed, split reductive Lie algebras) share many properties with semisimple Lie algebras over algebraically closed fields.

Over a non-algebraically closed field not every semisimple Lie algebra is splittable, however.

== Cartan subgroup ==
A Cartan subgroup of a Lie group is a special type of subgroup. Specifically, its Lie algebra (which captures the group’s algebraic structure) is itself a Cartan subalgebra. When we consider the identity component of a subgroup, it shares the same Lie algebra. However, there isn’t a universally agreed-upon definition for which subgroup with this property should be called the ‘Cartan subgroup,’ especially when dealing with disconnected groups.

For compact connected Lie groups, a Cartan subgroup is essentially a maximal connected Abelian subgroup—often referred to as a ‘maximal torus.’ The Lie algebra associated with this subgroup is also a Cartan subalgebra.

Now, when we explore disconnected compact Lie groups, things get interesting. There are multiple definitions for a Cartan subgroup. One common approach, proposed by David Vogan, defines it as the group of elements that normalize a fixed maximal torus while preserving the fundamental Weyl chamber. This version is sometimes called the ‘large Cartan subgroup.’ Additionally, there exists a ‘small Cartan subgroup,’ defined as the centralizer of a maximal torus. It’s important to note that these Cartan subgroups may not always be abelian in genera

===Examples of Cartan Subgroups===
* The subgroup in GL2(R) consisting of diagonal matrices.

<doc id="1336001" wikidata="Q2141106" url="?curid=1336001" title="Email filtering">
<text>Email filtering is the processing of email to organize it according to specified criteria. The term can apply to the intervention of human intelligence, but most often refers to the automatic processing of messages at an SMTP server, possibly applying anti-spam techniques. Filtering can be applied to incoming emails as well as to outgoing ones.

Depending on the calling environment, email filtering software can reject an item at the initial SMTP connection stage or pass it through unchanged for delivery to the user&#x27;s mailbox. It is also possible to redirect the message for delivery elsewhere, quarantine it for further checking, modify it or &#x27;tag&#x27; it in any other way.

==Motivation==
Common uses for mail filters include organizing incoming email and removal of spam and computer viruses. Mailbox providers filter outgoing email to promptly react to spam surges that may result from compromised accounts. A less common use is to inspect outgoing email at some companies to ensure that employees comply with appropriate policies and laws. Users might also employ a mail filter to prioritize messages, and to sort them into folders based on subject matter or other criteria.

==Methods==

Mailbox providers can also install mail filters in their mail transfer agents as a service to all of their customers. Anti-virus, anti-spam, URL filtering, and authentication-based rejections are common filter types.

Corporations often use filters to protect their employees and their information technology assets. A catch-all filter will &quot;catch all&quot; of the emails addressed to the domain that do not exist in the mail server - this can help avoid losing emails due to misspelling.

Users, may be able to install separate programs (see links below), or configure filtering as part of their email program (&quot;email client&quot;). In email programs, users can make personal, &quot;manual&quot; filters that then automatically filter mail according to the chosen criteria.

==Inbound and outbound filtering==
Mail filters can operate on inbound and outbound email traffic. Inbound email filtering involves scanning messages from the Internet addressed to users protected by the filtering system or for lawful interception. Outbound email filtering involves the reverse - scanning email messages from local users before any potentially harmful messages can be delivered to others on the Internet. One method of outbound email filtering that is commonly used by Internet service providers is transparent SMTP proxying, in which email traffic is intercepted and filtered via a transparent proxy within the network. Outbound filtering can also take place in an email server. Many corporations employ data leak prevention technology in their outbound mail servers to prevent the leakage of sensitive information via email.

==Customization==
Mail filters have varying degrees of configurability. Sometimes they make decisions based on matching a regular expression. Other times, code may match keywords in the message body, or perhaps the email address of the sender of the message. More complex control flow and logic is possible with programming languages; this is typically implemented with a data-driven programming language, such as procmail, which specifies conditions to match and actions to take on matching, which may involve further matching. Some more advanced filters, particularly anti-spam filters, use statistical document classification techniques such as the naive Bayes classifier while others use natural language processing to organize incoming emails. Image filtering can use complex image-analysis algorithms to detect skin-tones and specific body shapes normally associated with pornographic images.

Microsoft Outlook includes user-generated email filters called &quot;rules&quot;.

<doc id="1336007" wikidata="Q3930378" url="?curid=1336007" title="Rash guard">
<text>A rash guard, also known as rash vest or rashie, is an athletic shirt made of spandex and nylon or polyester. The name rash guard reflects the fact that the shirt protects the wearer against rashes caused by abrasion, or by sunburn from extended exposure to the sun, as sun protective clothing.

==Description==
A rash guard shirt is usually worn by itself when surfing in weather too warm for a wetsuit to prevent chafing from sliding on and off of the waxed surface of the surf board. A surfboard&#x27;s wax holds sand from the beach that can rub against a surfer while paddling out to the break, or legs while sitting atop one&#x27;s board.

Rash guards also offer some protection from the sun (measured by its Ultraviolet Protection Factor) and slight protection against jellyfish stings and are sometimes worn under wetsuits to prevent chafing. A rash guard helps to prevent irritation caused by rapid impact with surface water and waves as well.

A rash guard by itself is used for light coverage in warm weather for many other watersports including surfing, canoe polo, scuba diving, snorkeling, freediving, wakeboarding, bodysurfing, bodyboarding, windsurfing, kitesurfing, kayaking, stand up paddle surfing, or swimming.

There are also lower body rash guards, which are similar to compression shorts to be worn under the surfers&#x27; boardshorts, but more specialized for surfers.

Rash guards are thought to have originated in Australia, where they are commonly referred to as &quot;rashies&quot; or &quot;rashys&quot;.

Important features of a rash guard include flatlock stitching and multi-panel construction. Flatlock stitching creates a seam where the seam allowances lies flat to the garment instead of hanging loose from it. It is made by adjusting the overlock or the thread overedge stitch. Flatlock stitching increases the strength of the garment for intense exercise or recreational activities. Multi-panel construction and different material for separate body parts sewn together in panels allow the user increased mobility wet or dry versus the conventional tee shirt construction.

The combination of products used to construct a rash guard differ slightly depending on the designer. The use of nylon and spandex create a garment that is lightweight, quick drying, flexible, durable, naturally antibacterial and water wicking.

==Variations==
Some variations include the following:
*Cropped rash guard: A rash guard that is similar to a crop top and is made specifically for females. It can be paired with swimwear bottoms.
*Rash guard overall/bodysuit: A hybrid one-piece swimsuit (with boyleg/short or classic bottoms) with rash guard material and design. There are designs for males and females and this variation is much catered to children.

== Swim shirts ==
Swim shirts are relatively new to the consumer market, but are growing in popularity. They are generally more loose fitting and casually worn. Their primary purpose is to offer an alternative to sunscreen to protect the wearer&#x27;s skin from the sun&#x27;s UV radiation and possible skin cancer. Many swim shirts carry a UPF rating of 50+, which blocks out over 98% of the sun&#x27;s harmful rays. Many people find that sunscreen isn&#x27;t always enough because it is often not used properly and some have skin allergies or sensitivities to chemicals in sunscreens. Children&#x27;s skin can be especially sensitive to the sun and sunscreens. Many children, and parents, find it is much easier to put on a swim shirt as it is loose and easily slipped on. There are also zip front rash guards available which makes slipping in and out of them even easier, especially when wet. Furthermore, it is comfortable and yet gives sun protection. Even though the name generally applies to water sports, people use swim shirts for an array of activities: swimming, boating, golfing, tennis, gardening, playing in the sprinklers, water parks, beach trips, pool play, rivers and lakes, water skiing, surfing, snow skiing, sledding, skimboarding, in mixed martial arts and Brazilian jiu-jitsu, and even as normal everyday clothing.

== Rash guards for grappling / mixed martial arts ==

Many practitioners wear rash guards underneath a gi or as a stand-alone garment for training in various grappling sports and mixed martial arts (MMA). The potential, but not proven, benefits for this include:
* Protect skin against mat burn. 
* Moisture control. 
* Compression effect on the muscles which is beneficial when it comes to preventing muscle sprain/strain.
* Good hygiene practice.

In most cases, Brazilian jiu-jitsu (BJJ) and MMA rash guards are thinner than traditional rash guards meant for surfing or diving. They also do not offer UV protection. Over the years MMA rash guards evolved and most have the following distinct features: reinforced stitching; a gel panel on the bottom of the rash guard to keep it from rolling up while sparring; fewer stitches, and a mix of 80% polyester and 20% spandex. They also carry unique designs, usually martial arts–centered but not strictly.

In competition, BJJ athletes are allowed to wear rash guards with long or short sleeves. Some organizations and promotions, like IBJJF, require the participants to wear a solid color - usually black, or black with at least 10% of their belt color. Other organizations allow the competitors to wear a rash guard of their choice. The same rule goes for gyms and academies with each one setting their own requirements from their students.

<text>Graeme Kirkland is a Canadian record producer, composer, musician, and performance artist active during the late 1980s and 1990s.

==Musical career==
At age 15, while too young to be formally enrolled, Kirkland studied music in advanced classes at York University. During his teen years, he received three full scholarships to The Banff Centre School of Fine Arts studying and working alongside Big Miller, John Abercrombie, Kenny Wheeler, Don Thompson, Dave Holland, Hugh Fraser, and Albert Mangelsdorff. He also studied privately in Toronto &amp; New York City.

During his musical career, Kirkland played alongside and recorded with the Leslie Spit Treeo, Varga, Jeff Healey, Ashley MacIsaac, Tim Brady, Holly Cole, Mark Feldman, John Zorn, George Koller, Fred Stone, Jane Bunnett, Bob Wiseman, John Gzowski, The Shuffle Demons, Joey Goldstein, as well as the National Ballet of Canada. Kirkland, together with Tom Walsh, composed and played for the Hemispheres Orchestra in 1988. His music was featured on Citytv, MuchMusic, and in the movie &quot;Roadkill&quot;, which won an award at the 1989 Toronto International Film Festival.

Albums produced by Kirkland include &quot;There&#x27;s No Such Word As Can&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;Sleep Alone&quot;, and &quot;Sing Along With Graeme&quot;, which featured famous musicians Mary Margaret O&#x27;Hara, and Jim Cuddy from Blue Rodeo. Along with being a respected studio drummer, Kirkland was well known for his street busking performances, using overturned buckets and other available surfaces. He organized his annual Santa&#x27;s Jolly Christmas Benefit show, as well as the urban-drumming show Graeme Kirkland&#x27;s Long Distance Canada Day event in Toronto. After his musical career, he became a financial advisor.

==Awards==
Kirkland was a popular performer in Toronto being voted &quot;Best Drummer&quot; by &quot;NOW&quot; magazine&#x27;s readers consecutively for 6 years (1996–2001) in their annual Reader&#x27;s Poll. The runner-up in each of these 6 years was Neil Peart of Rush.

<doc id="1336029" wikidata="Q863134" url="?curid=1336029" title="Billy Hayes (writer)">
<text>William &quot;Billy&quot; Hayes (born April 3, 1947) is an American writer, actor, film director and convicted drug smuggler. He is best known for his autobiographical book &quot;Midnight Express&quot; about his experiences in and escape from a Turkish prison, after being convicted of smuggling hashish. He was one of hundreds of US citizens in foreign jails serving drug charge sentences, following a drug-smuggling crackdown by foreign governments.

==Background==
Hayes was caught trying to smuggle four pounds (1.81 kg) of hashish out of Turkey on October 7, 1970. He was originally sentenced to four years and two months in a Turkish prison. With his release date weeks away, he learned that the authorities had chosen to penalize him with a life sentence for smuggling, instead of possession.

Hayes was imprisoned at Sağmalcılar prison in Istanbul after having spent one night in Sultanahmet Jail. Following an incident in prison, he was transferred in 1972 to Bakırköy Psychiatric Hospital, described as a &#x27;lunatic asylum&#x27;. On several occasions, the United States Department of State pressured Turkey to transfer sentencing to the United States; however, Turkish foreign minister Melih Esenbel stated that the US was not in a position to dispute a sentence issued by a Turkish court. He stated privately to officials that a release might be possible on humanitarian grounds, if Hayes&#x27; physical or mental health was deteriorating, but in a private consultation, Hayes stated to US diplomats that his experience at Bakırköy was highly traumatic, and he did not have confidence that the hospital would certify him for early release; Hayes also stated that he felt attempts to win early release would jeopardize his prospects of being transferred to a more desirable half-open prison. On May 12, 1975, the Constitutional Court of Turkey declared amnesty for all drug offenses, which shortened Hayes&#x27; sentence from life to 30 years; he was transferred to İmralı prison on July 11, 1975.

Declassified telegrams from the State Department indicated that in discussions between the US embassy and Vahap Aşıroğlu, Turkish Director of Consular Affairs, the latter believed Hayes would probably be released from prison on parole in October 1978, which in practice meant that a local prosecutor would declare him persona non grata and expel him from the country. Hayes escaped from İmralı on October 2, 1975, taking a rowboat at night to Bandirma, blending in with locals, and then heading westbound across the border to Greece. After over two weeks of detention and interrogation to determine whether he possessed any useful intelligence about Turkey&#x27;s military, he was deported from Thessaloniki to Frankfurt on October 20; after interrogation by US authorities in Frankfurt, Hayes spent several days in Amsterdam, and then returned to the United States, arriving at Kennedy Airport over three weeks later on October 24, 1975.

==Book==
Hayes wrote a book on his experiences, &quot;Midnight Express&quot;, which was later adapted into the 1978 film of the same name starring Brad Davis as Hayes. The film was directed by Alan Parker, with a screenplay by Oliver Stone. The film differs from Hayes&#x27; account in his book. Among the differences is a scene invented by Stone in which Hayes kills the prison guard Hamidou &quot;the Bear&quot;, the main antagonist of the story. The prison guard was killed in 1973 by another person entirely, a recently released prisoner, whose family Hamidou had insulted while beating the prisoner; this took place years before Hayes&#x27; actual escape.

In 2010, in an episode of National Geographic Channel&#x27;s &quot;Locked Up Abroad&quot;, titled &quot;The Real Midnight Express&quot;, Hayes finally told his fully accurate version of being sent to the infamous Turkish prison in Sağmalcilar, eventually escaping from İmralı prison on an island in the Marmara Sea. Hayes has since written the sequels &quot;Midnight Return (Escaping Midnight Express)&quot; and &quot;The Midnight Express Letters - from a Turkish Prison, 1970-1975&quot;, the latter a collection of the original letters written home to family and friends during his imprisonment.

==Acting and writing==
Hayes became active in the entertainment industry, specifically acting and writing. He appeared in the Charles Bronson 1987 film &quot;Assassination&quot;, as a hired killer.

One of Hayes&#x27; successes was writing and directing 2003&#x27;s &quot;Southside&quot; (later released in the US as &quot;A Cock and Bull Story&quot;) which won numerous awards, including the 2002 L.A. Drama Critics&#x27; Circle award.

On June 30, 2010, the National Geographic television channel aired &quot;Locked Up Abroad: The Real Midnight Express&quot;.

Hayes travelled the world with his one-man show, &quot;Riding the Midnight Express with Billy Hayes&quot;, from its premiere at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in August 2013 until theaters closed in 2020 amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

Hayes presented the TV series &quot;Greatest Prison Escapes&quot; produced by Sky TV. 

==Interview on &quot;Midnight Express&quot; film==
During the 1999 Cannes Film Festival, Alinur Velidedeoğlu, a Turkish advertiser, met Hayes by chance and interviewed him on the film &quot;Midnight Express&quot;. Hayes expressed his disappointment with parts of the film adaptation, especially its portrayal of all Turks as bad, and his regret that Turkey&#x27;s image was negatively affected by the film. Hayes also displayed affection for Turkey and the city of Istanbul. Although the Interpol warrant for him had by then been lifted, Hayes explained that while he wanted to return, he hesitated to do so, out of concern that many Turks might blame him for the negative publicity the movie had generated. The video was made available on YouTube. 

The Turkish order banning him from the country was finally suspended and Hayes was allowed to return to Turkey on June 14, 2007, to attend the 2nd Istanbul Conference on Democracy and Global Security, organized by the Turkish National Police (TNP) and the Turkish Institute for Police Studies (TIPS). Hayes said it was important to him to return, in order to &quot;apologize and &#x27;make amends&#x27; – not for the book he wrote, but for the film, scripted by Oliver Stone, on which it was based. &#x27;The film wasn&#x27;t what Turkish people deserved,&#x27; Hayes told reporters at a press conference, explaining that it painted an unfairly bleak portrait of the country.&quot;

<text>A heavy brigade is a formation made up from &#x27;Heavy&#x27; Cavalry; i.e. Dragoon Guards and Dragoons.

The Heavy Brigade was a British heavy cavalry unit commanded by General Sir James York Scarlett at the Battle of Balaclava in the Crimean War. The Brigade of 800 horsemen made a charge against Russian cavalry. The Russian force was in retreat and had halted. Although the Heavy Brigade&#x27;s uphill charge was at no more than a trot, it put the much larger Russian force, of around 3,000, into disorder.

At the Battle of Balaclava the brigade was composed of 2 squadrons each of the 1st Dragoons (The Royals), the 2nd Dragoons (Scots Greys), the 4th Dragoon Guards (Royal Irish), the 5th Dragoon Guards (Princess Charlotte of Wales&#x27;s), and the 6th Dragoons (Inniskilling).

<text>Founded first as a cooperative, the Minuteman Library Network (MLN) is today a consortium of over 40+ public or academic libraries. The network consists of an aggregate collection of over sum 6 million items and over 680,000 cardholders. Membership card eligibility is open to persons who: live, work, or study in Massachusetts; and can be used to borrow items from its Minuteman libraries.

The network operates through the pooling and sharing of resources, and through this offers patrons more services along with access to a more expansive catalog. For example, the network has a OverDrive E-book collection and allows users to sign-in with their library card and borrow E-books and audio books from other consortium library networks in Massachusetts. Given certain libraries may individually offer further services even within the MLN not all services are uniformly available at all member libraries.

== Libraries ==
The network largely spans the MetroWest area of eastern Massachusetts, in the Greater Boston Metropolitan area of the United States. The network encompasses the counties of Middlesex (South), and portions of Norfolk.

<text>Puri, also known as, Jagannath Puri, () is a coastal city and a municipality in the state of Odisha in eastern India. It is the district headquarters of Puri district and is situated on the Bay of Bengal, south of the state capital of Bhubaneswar. It is home to the 12th-century Jagannath Temple and is one of the original Char Dham pilgrimage sites for Hindus.

Puri has been known by several names since ancient times and was locally known as &quot;Sri Kshetra&quot; and the Jagannath temple is known as &quot;Badadeula&quot;. Puri and the Jagannath Temple were invaded 18 times by Muslim rulers, from the 7th century AD until the early 19th century with the objective of looting the treasures of the temple. Odisha, including Puri and its temple, were part of British India from 1803 until India attained independence in August 1947. Even though princely states do not exist in India today, the heirs of the House of Gajapati still perform the ritual duties of the temple. The temple town has many Hindu religious &quot;matha&quot;s or monasteries. Shree Hari is said to take one of his minor incarnations of on this divine land, along with 5 elemental gods; Varun(Air), Pushkarini Lake(Water), Devanshu Light of god(Controller of Climate and weather), Jwalaantra (Fire), Dharitri(Earth).

The economy of Puri is dependent on the religious importance of the Jagannath Temple to the extent of nearly 80 percent. The 24 festivals, including 13 major ones, held every year in the temple complex contribute to the economy; Ratha Yatra and its related festivals are the most important which are attended by millions of people every year. Sand art and applique art are some of the important crafts of the city.

Puri has been chosen as one of the heritage cities for Heritage City Development and Augmentation Yojana (HRIDAY) scheme of Government of India.

Puri is a significant part of the &quot;Krishna pilgrimage circuit&quot; which also includes Mathura, Vrindavan, Barsana, Gokul, Govardhan, Kurukshetra and Dwarka.

==History==
===Names in history===
Puri, the holy land of Jagannatha, also known by the popular vernacular name Srikshetram, has many ancient names in the Hindu scriptures such as the Rigveda, Matsya purana, Brahma Purana, Narada Purana, Padma Purana, Skanda Purana, Kapila Purana and Niladrimahodaya. In the Rigveda, in particular, it is mentioned as a place called Purushamandama-grama meaning the place where the Creator deity of the world – Supreme Divinity deified on an altar or mandapa was venerated near the coast and prayers offered with Vedic hymns. Over time the name got changed to Purushottama Puri and further shortened to Puri, and the Purusha came to be known as Jagannatha. Sages like Bhrigu, Atri and Markandeya had their hermitage close to this place. Its name is mentioned, conforming to the deity worshipped, as Srikshetra, Purusottama Dhāma, Purusottama Kshetra, Purusottama Puri and Jagannath Puri. Puri, however, is the popular usage. It is also known by the geographical features of its location as Shankhakshetra (the layout of the town is in the form of a conch shell), Neelāchala (&quot;Blue mountain&quot; a terminology used to name a very large sand lagoon over which the temple was built but this name is not in vogue), Neelāchalakshetra, Neelādri. In Sanskrit, the word &quot;Puri&quot; means town or city, and is cognate with &quot;polis&quot; in Greek.

Another ancient name is Charita as identified by General Alexander Cunningham of the Archaeological Survey of India, which was later spelled as Che-li-ta-lo by Chinese traveller Hiuen Tsang. When the present temple was built by the Eastern Ganga king Anantavarman Chodaganga in the 11th and 12th centuries AD, it was called Purushottamkshetra. However, the Moghuls, the Marathas and early British rulers called it Purushottama-chhatar or just Chhatar. In Moghul ruler Akbar&#x27;s Ain-i-Akbari and subsequent Muslim historical records it was known as Purushottama. In the Sanskrit drama &quot;Anargha Raghava Nataka&quot; as well, authored by Murari Mishra, a playwright, in the 8th century AD, it is referred to as Purushottama. It was only after the 12th century AD that Puri came to be known by the shortened form of Jagannatha Puri, named after the deity or in a short form as Puri. It is the only shrine in India, where Radha, along with Lakshmi, Saraswati, Durga, Bhudevi, Sati, Parvati, and Shakti, abodes with Krishna, who is also known by the name Jagannatha.

===Ancient period===

According to the chronicle Madala Panji, in 318 AD , the priests and servitors of the temple spirited away the idols to escape the wrath of the Rashtrakuta king Rakatavahu. In the temple&#x27;s historical records it finds mention in the Brahma Purana and Skanda Purana stating that the temple was built by the king Indradyumna, Ujjayani.

S. N. Sadasivan, a historian, in his book &quot;A Social History of India&quot; quotes William Joseph Wilkins, author of the book &quot;Hindu Mythology, Vedic and Purānic&quot; as stating that in Puri, Buddhism was once a well established practice but later Buddhism faded and Brahmanism became the order of the religious practice in the town; the Buddha deity is now worshipped by the Hindus as Jagannatha. It is also said by Wilkinson that some relics of Buddha were placed inside the idol of Jagannatha which the Brahmins claimed were the bones of Krishna. Even during Maurya king Ashoka&#x27;s reign in 240 BC, Kalinga was a Buddhist center and that a tribe known as Lohabahu (barbarians from outside Odisha) converted to Buddhism and built a temple with a statue of Buddha which is now worshipped as Jagannatha. Wilkinson also says that the Lohabahu deposited some Buddha relics in the precincts of the temple.

Construction of the present Jagannath Temple started in 1136 AD and completed towards the latter part of the 12th century. The Eastern Ganga king Anangabhima III dedicated his kingdom to Jagannatha, then known as the Purushottama-Jagannatha, and resolved that from then on he and his descendants would rule under &quot;divine order as Jagannatha&#x27;s sons and vassals&quot;. Even though princely states do not exist in India today, the heirs of the Puri Estate still perform the ritual duties of the temple; the king formally sweeps the road in front of the chariots before the start of the Ratha Yatra. This ritual is called Cherra Pahanra.

===Medieval and early modern periods===
The history of Puri is on the same lines as that of the Jagannath Temple, which was invaded 18 times during its history to plunder the treasures of the temple, rather than for religious reasons. The first invasion occurred in the 8th century AD by Rastrakuta king Govinda III (798–814 AD), and the last took place in 1881 AD by the monotheistic followers of &quot;Alekh&quot; (Mahima Dharma) who did not recognise the worship of Jagannatha. From 1205 AD onward there were many invasions of the city and its temple by Muslims of Afghan and Moghul descent, known as Yavanas or foreigners. In most of these invasions the idols were taken to safe places by the priests and the servitors of the temple. Destruction of the temple was prevented by timely resistance or surrender by the kings of the region. However, the treasures of the temple were repeatedly looted. The table lists all the 18 invasions along with the status of the three images of the temple, the triad of Jagannatha, Balabhadra and Subhadra following each invasion.

Puri is the site of the Govardhana Matha, one of the four cardinal institutions established by Adi Shankaracharya, when he visited Puri in 810 AD, and since then it has become an important &quot;dham&quot; (divine centre) for the Hindus; the others being those at Sringeri, Dwarka and Jyotirmath. The &quot;Matha&quot; (monastery of various Hindu sects) is headed by Jagatguru Shankarachrya. It is a local belief about these dhams that Vishnu takes his dinner at Puri, has his bath at Rameshwaram, spends the night at Dwarka and does penance at Badrinath.

In the 16th century, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu of Bengal established the Bhakti movements of India, now known by the name the Hare Krishna movement. He spent many years as a devotee of Jagannatha at Puri; he is said to have merged with the deity. There is also a &quot;matha&quot; of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu here known as Radhakanta Math.

In the 17th century, for the sailors sailing on the east coast of India, the temple served as a landmark, being located in a plaza in the centre of the city, which they called the &quot;White Pagoda&quot; while the Konark Sun Temple, away to the east of Puri, was known as the &quot;Black Pagoda&quot;.

The iconic representation of the images in the Jagannath temple is believed to be the forms derived from the worship made by the tribal groups of Sabaras belonging to northern Odisha. These images are replaced at regular intervals as the wood deteriorates. This replacement is a special event carried out ritualistically by special group of carpenters.

The city has many other &quot;Mathas&quot; as well. The Emar Matha was founded by the Tamil Vaishnava saint Ramanujacharya in the 12th century AD. This Matha, which is now located in front of Simhadvara across the eastern corner of the Jagannath Temple, is reported to have been built in the 16th century during the reign of kings of Suryavamsi Gajapatis. The Matha was in the news on 25 February 2011 for the large cache of 522 silver slabs unearthed from a closed chamber.

The British conquered Orissa in 1803, and, recognizing the importance of the Jagannath Temple in the life of the people of the state, they initially appointed an official to look after the temple&#x27;s affairs and later declared the temple as part of a district.

===Modern history===

In 1906, Sri Yukteswar, an exponent of Kriya Yoga and a resident of Puri, established an ashram, a spiritual training center, named &quot;Karar Ashram&quot; in Puri. He died on 9 March 1936 and his body is buried in the garden of the ashram.

The city is the site of the former summer residence of British Raj, the Raj Bhavan, built in 1913–14 during the era of governors.

For the people of Puri, Jagannatha, visualized as Krishna, is synonymous with their city. They believe that Jagannatha looks after the welfare of the state. However, after the partial collapse of the Jagannath Temple (in the Amalaka part of the temple) on 14 June 1990, people became apprehensive and considered it a bad omen for Odisha. The replacement of the fallen stone by another of the same size and weight (), that could be done only in the early morning hours after the temple gates were opened, was done on 28 February 1991.

Puri has been chosen as one of the heritage cities for the Heritage City Development and Augmentation Yojana scheme of the Indian Government. It is chosen as one of the 12 heritage cities with &quot;focus on holistic development&quot; to be implemented within 27 months by the end of March 2017.

Non-Hindus are not permitted to enter the shrines but are allowed to view the temple and the proceedings from the roof of the Raghunandan library, located within the precincts of the temple, for a small donation.

==Geography and climate==
===Geography===
Puri, located on the east coast of India on the Bay of Bengal, is in the centre of the Puri district.

Puri is in the coastal delta of the Mahanadi River on the shores of the Bay of Bengal. In the ancient days it was near to Sisupalgarh (also known as &quot;Ashokan Tosali&quot;). Then the land was drained by a tributary of the Bhargavi River, a branch of the Mahanadi River. This branch underwent a meandering course creating many arteries altering the estuary, and formed many sand hills. These sand hills could be cut through by the streams. Because of the sand hills, the Bhargavi River, flowing to the south of Puri, moved away towards the Chilika Lake. This shift also resulted in the creation of two lagoons, known as Sar and Samang, on the eastern and northern parts of Puri respectively. Sar lagoon has a length of in an east–west direction and a width of in north–south direction. The estuary of the Bhargavi River has a shallow depth of just and the process of siltation continues. According to a 15th-century Odia writer Saraladasa, the bed of the unnamed stream that flowed at the base of the Blue Mountain or &quot;Neelachal&quot; was filled up. &quot;Katakarajavamsa&quot;, a 16th-century chronicle (c.1600), attributes filling up of the bed of the river which flowed through the present Grand Road, as done during the reign of King Narasimha II (1278–1308) of Eastern Ganga dynasty.

====Jagannath Temple at Puri====

The Jagannath Temple at Puri is one of the major Hindu temples built in the Kalinga style of architecture. The temple tower, with a spire, rises to a height of , and a flag is unfurled above it, fixed over a wheel (&quot;chakra&quot;).
The temple is built on an elevated platform (of about area), above the adjacent area. The temple rises to a height of above the road level. The temple complex covers an area of . There are four entry gates in four cardinal directions of the temple, each gate located at the central part of the walls. These gates are: the eastern gate called the &quot;Singhadwara&quot; (Lions Gate), the southern gate known as &quot;Ashwa Dwara&quot; (Horse Gate), the western gate called the &quot;Vyaghra Dwara&quot; (Tigers Gate) or the &quot;Khanja&quot; Gate, and the northern gate called the &quot;Hathi Dwara&quot; or (elephant gate). These four gates symbolize the four fundamental principles of Dharma (right conduct), Jnana (knowledge), Vairagya (renunciation) and Aishwarya (prosperity). The gates are crowned with pyramid shaped structures. There is a stone pillar in front of the Singhadwara, called the &quot;Aruna Stambha&quot; {Solar Pillar}, in height with 16 faces, made of chlorite stone; at the top of the stamba an elegant statue of Aruṇa (Sun) in a prayer mode is mounted. This pillar was shifted from the Konarak Sun Temple. The four gates are decorated with guardian statues in the form of lion, horse mounted men, tigers, and elephants in the name and order of the gates. A pillar made of fossilized wood is used for placing lamps as offering. The Lion Gate (Singhadwara) is the main gate to the temple, which is guarded by two guardian deities Jaya and Vijaya. The main gate is ascended through 22 steps known as &quot;Baisi Pahaca&quot;, which are revered, as it is believed to possess &quot;spiritual animation&quot;. Children are made to roll down these steps, from top to bottom, to bring them spiritual happiness. After entering the temple, on the left side, there is a large kitchen where food is prepared in hygienic conditions in huge quantities; the kitchen is called as &quot;the biggest hotel of the world&quot;. 

According to a legend King Indradyumma was directed by Jagannatha in a dream to build a temple for him which he did as directed. However, according to historical records the temple was started some time during the 12th century by King Chodaganga of the Eastern Ganga dynasty. It was completed by his descendant, Anangabhima Deva, in the 12th century. The wooden images of Jagannatha, Balabhadra and Subhadra were then deified here. The temple was under the control of the Hindu rulers up to 1558. Then, when Orissa was occupied by the Afghan Nawab of Bengal, it was brought under the control of the Afghan General Kalapahad. Following the defeat of the Afghan king by Raja Mansingh, the General of Mughal emperor Akbar, the temple became part of the Mughal empire till 1751. Subsequently, it was under the control of the Marathas till 1803. During the British Raj, the Puri Raja was entrusted with its management until 1947.

The triad of images in the temple are of Jagannatha, personifying Krishna, Balabhadra, His older brother, and Subhadra, His younger sister. The images are made of neem wood in an unfinished form. The stumps of wood which form the images of the brothers have human arms, while that of Subhadra does not have any arms. The heads are large, painted and non-carved. The faces are marked with distinctive large circular eyes.

==== The Pancha Tirtha of Puri====
Hindus consider it essential to bathe in the Pancha Tirtha or the five sacred bathing spots of Puri, to complete a pilgrimage to Puri. The five sacred water bodies are the Indradyumana Tank, the Rohini Kunda, the Markandeya Tank, the Swetaganga Tank, and the Bay of Bengal also called the &quot;Mahodadhi&quot;, in Sanskrit &#x27;Mahodadhi&#x27; means a &quot;great ocean&quot;; all are considered sacred bathing spots in the Swargadwara area. These tanks have perennial sources of supply from rainfall and ground water.
====Gundicha Temple====
The Gundicha Temple, known as the Garden House of Jagannatha, stands in the centre of a garden, bounded by compound walls on all sides. It lies at a distance of about to the northeast of the Jagannath Temple. The two temples are located at the two ends of the &quot;Bada Danda&quot; (Grand Avenue), which is the pathway for the Ratha Yatra. According to a legend, Gundicha was the wife of King Indradyumna who originally built the Jagannath temple.

The temple is built using light-grey sandstone, and, architecturally, it exemplifies typical Kalinga temple architecture in the &quot;Deula&quot; style. The complex comprises four components: vimana (tower structure containing the sanctum), jagamohana (assembly hall), nata-mandapa (festival hall) and &quot;bhoga-mandapa&quot; (hall of offerings). There is also a kitchen connected by a small passage. The temple is set within a garden, and is known as &quot;God&#x27;s Summer Garden Retreat&quot; or garden house of Jagannatha. The entire complex, including the garden, is surrounded by a wall which measures with height of .

Except for the 9-day Ratha Yatra, when the triad images are worshipped in the Gundicha Temple, otherwise it remains unoccupied for the rest of the year. Tourists can visit the temple after paying an entry fee. Foreigners (generally prohibited entry in the main temple) are allowed inside this temple during this period. The temple is under the Jagannath Temple Administration, Puri, the governing body of the main temple. A small band of servitors maintain the temple.

====Swargadwar====

Swargadwar is the name given to the cremation ground or burning ghat which is located on the shores of the sea. Here thousands of dead bodies of Hindus brought from faraway places are cremated. It is a belief that the Chaitanya Mahaparabhu disappeared from this Swargadwar about 500 years back.

====Beach====
The beach at Puri, known as the &quot;Ballighai beach, at the mouth of Nunai River&quot;, is away from the town and is fringed by casurina trees. It has golden yellow sand. Sunrise and sunset are pleasant scenic attractions here. Waves break in at the beach which is long and wide.

====District museum====
The Puri district museum is located on the station road where the exhibits in display are the different types of garments worn by Jagannatha, local sculptures, patachitra (traditional, cloth-based scroll painting), ancient Palm-leaf manuscripts, and local craft work.

====Raghunandana library====
Raghunandana Library is located in the Emara Matha complex (opposite Simhadwara or lion gate, the main entrance gate). The Jagannatha Aitihasika Gavesana Samiti (Jagannatha Historical Centre) is also located here. The library houses ancient palm leaf manuscripts on Jagannatha, His cult and the history of the city.

===Festivals of Puri===
Puri witnesses 24 festivals every year, of which 13 are major. The most important of these is the Ratha Yatra, or the car festival, held in the June–July, which is attended by more than 1 million people.

====Ratha Yatra at Puri====
The Jagannath Temple triad are normally worshipped in the sanctum of the temple at Puri, but once during the month of Asadha (rainy season of Orissa, usually in June or July), they are brought out on the Bada Danda (main street of Puri) and taken over a distance of () to the Gundicha Temple in huge chariots (&quot;ratha&quot;), allowing the public to have darśana (holy view). This festival is known as the Ratha Yatra, meaning the journey (&quot;yatra&quot;) of the chariots. The yatra starts every year according to the Hindu calendar on the Asadha Sukla Dwitiya day, the second day of bright fortnight of Asadha (June–July).

Historically, the ruling Ganga dynasty instituted the Ratha Yatra on the completion of the Jagannath Temple around 1150 AD. This festival was one of those Hindu festivals that was reported to the Western world very early. Friar Odoric, in his account of 1321, reported how the people put the &quot;idols&quot; on chariots, and the King, the Queen and all the people drew them from the &quot;church&quot; with song and music.

The Rathas are huge wooden structures provided with large wheels, which are built anew every year and are pulled by the devotees. The chariot for Jagannatha is about high and and takes about 2 months for its construction. The chariot is mounted with 16 wheels, each of diameter. The carving in the front face of the chariot has four wooden horses drawn by Maruti. On its other three faces, the wooden carvings are of Rama, Surya and Vishnu. The chariot is known as Nandi Ghosha. The roof of the chariot is covered with yellow and red coloured cloth. The next chariot is of Balabhadra which is in height fitted with 14 wheels. The chariot is carved with Satyaki as the charioteer, roof covered in red and green coloured cloth, and the chariot is known as Taladhwaja. The carvings on this chariot include images of Narasimha and Rudra as Jagannatha&#x27;s companions. The next chariot in the order is of Subhadra, which is in height supported on 12 wheels, roof covered in black and red colour cloth, and the chariot is known as Darpa Dalaan and the charioteer carved is Arjuna. Other images carved on the chariot are of Vana Durga, Tara Devi and Chandi Devi. The artists and painters of Puri decorate the cars and paint flower petals and other designs on the wheels, the wood-carved charioteer and horses, and the inverted lotuses on the wall behind the throne. The chariots of Jagannatha pulled during Ratha Yatra is the etymological origin of the English word Juggernaut. The Ratha Yatra is also termed as the Shri Gundicha yatra and Ghosha yatra
====Chhera Panhara====
The Chhera Panhara (sweeping with water) is a significant ritual associated with the Ratha Yatra. During this ritual, the Gajapati King wears the outfit of a sweeper and sweeps all around the deities and chariots. The king cleans the road in front of the chariots with a gold-handled broom and sprinkles sandalwood water and powder. As per the custom, although the Gajapati King has been considered the most exalted person in the Kalingan kingdom, he still renders the menial service to Jagannatha. This ritual signifies that under the lordship of Jagannatha, there is no distinction between the powerful sovereign and the humblest devotee.

====Chandan Yatra====
The Chandan Yatra festival held every year on Akshaya Tritiya day marks the commencement of the construction of the chariots of the Ratha Yatra. It also marks the celebration of the Hindu new year.

====Snana Yatra====

Every year, on the Purnima day in the Hindu calendar month of Jyestha (June), the triad images of the Jagannath Temple are ceremonially bathed and decorated on the occasion of Snana Yatra. Water for the bath is taken in 108 pots from the &quot;Suna kuan&quot; (meaning: &quot;golden well&quot;) located near the northern gate of the temple. Water is drawn from this well only once in a year for the sole purpose of the religious bath of the deities. After the bath the triad images are dressed in the fashion of the elephant god, Ganesha. Later, during the night, the original triad images are taken out in a procession back to the main temple but kept at a place known as &quot;Anasara pindi&quot;. After this the Jhulan Yatra is performed when proxy images of the deities are taken out in a grand procession for 21 days, cruised over boats in the Narendra Tirtha tank.

====Anavasara or Anasara====

Anasara, a derivative of the Sanskrit word &quot;Anavasara&quot;, literally means vacation. Every year after the holy Snana Yatra, the triad images, without the Sudarshana Chakra, are taken to a secret altar named &quot;Anavasara Ghar&quot; (also known as &quot;Anasara pindi,&quot; &#x27;pindi&#x27; is Oriya term meaning &quot;platform&quot; ) where they remain for the next fortnight of (Krishna paksha); devotees are not allowed to view these images. Instead, devotees go to the nearby Brahmagiri to see the Lord in the four-handed form of Alarnath, a depiction of Vishnu. Devotees then get the first glimpse of the Lord only on the day before Ratha Yatra, which is called &quot;Navayouvana.&quot; It is a local belief that the gods suffer from fever after taking an elaborate ritual bath, and they are treated by the special servants, the Daitapatis, for 15 days. Daitapatis perform special nitis (rites) known as &quot;Netrotchhaba&quot; (a rite of painting the eyes of the triad). During this period cooked food is not offered to the deities.

====Naba Kalebara====

Naba Kalebara is one of the most grand events associated with the LJagannatha that takes place when one lunar month of Ashadha is followed by another of Ashadha called Adhika Masa (extra month). This can take place at an interval of 8, 12 or even 18 years. Literally meaning the &quot;New Body&quot; (Nava = New, Kalevar = Body) in Odia, the festival is witnessed by millions of people and the budget for this event generally exceeds $500,000. The event involves installation of new images in the temple and burial of the old ones in the temple premises at Koili Vaikuntha. During the Nabakalebara ceremony held during July 2015 the idols that were installed in the temple in 1996 were replaced by specially carved new images made of neem wood. More than 3 million people are reported to have attended this festival.

====Suna Besha====
Suna Besha, (&#x27;Suna besh&#x27;in English translates to &quot;gold dressing&quot;) also known as Raja or Rajadhiraja Bhesha or Raja Bhesha, is an event when the triad images of the Jagannath Temple are adorned with gold jewelry. This event is observed five times in a year. It is commonly observed on Magha Purnima (January), Bahuda Ekadashi also known as Asadha Ekadashi (July), Dashahara (Bijayadashami) (October), Karthik Purnima (November), and Pousa Purnima (December). One such Suna Bhesha event is observed on Bahuda Ekadashi during the Ratha Yatra on the chariots placed at the Simhadwar. The other four Beshas are observed inside the temple on the &quot;Ratna Singhasana&quot; (gem studded altar). On this occasion gold plates are decorated over the hands and feet of Jagannatha and Balabhadra; Jagannatha is also adorned with a Chakra (disc) made of gold on the right hand while a silver conch adorns the left hand. Balabhadra is decorated with a plough made of gold on the left hand while a golden mace adorns his right hand.

====Niladri Bije====
Niladri Bije, celebrated in the Hindu calendar month Asadha (June–July) on Trayodashi (13th day), marks the end of the Ratha Yatra. The large wooden images of the triad of gods are taken out from the chariots and then carried to the sanctum sanctorum, swaying rhythmically; a ritual which is known as &quot;pahandi&quot;.

====Sahi yatra====

The Sahi Yatra, considered the world&#x27;s biggest open-air theatre, is an annual event lasting 11 days; a traditional cultural theatre festival or folk drama which begins on Ram Navami and ends on Rama &quot;avishke&quot; (Sanskrit meaning : anointing). The festival includes plays depicting various scenes from the Ramayana. The residents of various localities, or 
Sahis, are entrusted the task of performing the drama at the street corners.

====Samudra Arati====

The Samudra arati is a daily tradition started by the present Shankaracharya 9 years ago. The daily practise includes prayer and fire offering to the sea at Swargadwar in Puri by disciples of the Govardhan Matha. On Paush Purnima of every year the Shankaracharya himself comes out to offer prayers to the sea.

===Arts and crafts===
====Sand art====

Sand art is a special art form that is created on the beaches of Puri. The art form is attributed to Balaram Das, a poet who lived in the 14th century. Sculptures of various gods and famous people are now created in sand by amateur artists. These are temporary in nature as they get washed away by waves. This art form has gained international fame in recent years. One of the famed sand artists of Odisha is Sudarshan Patnaik. He established the Golden Sand Art Institute in 1995, in the open air on the shores of Bay of Bengal, to provide training to students interested in this art form.

====Appliqué art====

Appliqué art, which is a stitching-based craft unlike embroidery, was pioneered by Hatta Maharana of Pipili. It is widely used in Puri, both for decoration of the deities and for sale. Maharana&#x27;s family members are employed as darjis or tailors or &quot;sebaks&quot; by the Maharaja of Puri. They prepare articles for decorating the deities in the temple for various festivals and religious ceremonies. The appliqué works are brightly colored and patterned fabric in the form of canopies, umbrellas, drapery, carry bags, flags, coverings of dummy horses and cows, and other household textiles; these are marketed in Puri. The cloth used is made in dark colours of red, black, yellow, green, blue and turquoise blue.

====Pattachitra====
Pattachitra, one of the oldest forms of cloth-based scroll painting of the region, originally created for ritual use and as souvenirs for pilgrims to Puri, as well as other temples in Odisha.

===Cultural activities===
Cultural activities, including the annual religious festivals, in Puri are: The Puri Beach Festival held from 5 to 9 November every year, and the Shreekshetra Utsav held from 20 December to 2 January every year. The cultural programs include unique sand art, display of local and traditional handicrafts and food festival. In addition, cultural programs are held for two hours on every second Saturday of the month at the district Collector&#x27;s Conference Hall near Sea Beach Police Station. Odissi dance, Odissi music and folk dances are part of this event. Odissi dance is the cultural heritage of Puri. This dance form originated in Puri from the dances performed by Devadasis (Maharis) attached to the Jagannath Temple who performed dances in the Nata &quot;mandapa&quot; of the temple to please the deities. Though the devadasi practice has been discontinued, the dance form has become modern and classical and is widely popular; many of the Odissi virtuoso artists and gurus (teachers) are from Puri. Some of the notable Odissi dancers are Kelucharan Mohapatra, Mayadhar Raut, Sonal Mansingh, and Sanjukta Panigrahi.

==Transport==
=== Road ===
Earlier, when roads did not exist, people used to walk or travel by animal-drawn vehicles or carriages along beaten tracks to reach Puri. Travel was by riverine craft along the Ganges up to Calcutta, and then on foot or by carriages. It was only during the Maratha rule that the Jagannath Sadak (Road) was built around 1790. The East India Company laid the rail track from Calcutta to Puri, which became operational in 1898. Puri is now well-connected by rail, road and air services.

=== Train ===
A broad gauge railway line of the South Eastern Railways which connects Puri with Kolkata and Khorda Road is an important railway junction on this route. The rail distance is from Kolkata and from Vishakhapatnam. Road network includes NH 203 that links the city with Bhubaneswar, the state capital, situated about away. NH 203 B connects the city with Satapada via Brahmagiri. Marine drive, which is part of NH 203 A, connects Puri with Konark. Puri railway station is among the top hundred booking stations of the Indian Railways. Puri railway station is away from New Delhi.

=== Air ===
A proposal was received from the State Government of Odisha for development of a Greenfield Airport at Puri to the Ministry of Civil Aviation seeking &#x27;Site Clearance&#x27; approval under GFA Policy.

Shree Jagannath International Airport is likely to be operational by 2024.

<text>Room Raiders is a dating/reality series that aired on MTV.

==Premise==
On the show, three men or women have their rooms inspected, or &quot;raided&quot; by another single man or woman. The raider does not meet or see any of the three singles (any personal photographs of the contestant are removed from the room or covered with a smiley face sticker). At the end of the episode, the raider chooses to go on a date with one of them based on the contents of their rooms. The three contestants watch and comment, while sitting in a van, as their rooms are inspected. After the raider has finished with each of the rooms, the three contestants then raid the raider&#x27;s room. Finally, the raider confronts the three contestants and makes his or her choice.

==Seasons==

She also served as a bencher of the Law Society of Upper Canada for nine years before becoming a judge. She was also president of the Federation of Law Societies of Canada, and vice-president of the Ontario Centre for Advocacy Training.

Madam Justice Bellamy was appointed to the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in April, 1997.

She led the External Contracts Inquiry and Computer Leasing Inquiry. She dismissed appeal motions in the Gold Reserve case.

<doc id="1336060" wikidata="Q969490" url="?curid=1336060" title="Burma plate">
<text>The Burma plate is a minor tectonic plate or microplate located in Southeast Asia, sometimes considered a part of the larger Eurasian plate. The Andaman Islands, Nicobar Islands, and northwestern Sumatra are located on the plate. This island arc separates the Andaman Sea from the main Indian Ocean to the west.

To its east lies the Sunda plate, from which it is separated along a transform boundary, running in a rough north–south line through the Andaman Sea. This boundary between the Burma and Sunda plates is a marginal seafloor spreading centre, which has led to the opening up of the Andaman Sea (from a southerly direction) by &quot;pushing out&quot; the Andaman-Nicobar-Sumatra island arc from mainland Asia, a process which began in earnest approximately 4 million years ago.

To the west is the much larger India plate, which is subducting beneath the western facet of the Burma plate. This extensive subduction zone has formed the Sunda Trench.

== Tectonic history ==
In models of the reconstructed tectonic history of the area, the generally northwards movement of the Indo-Australian plate resulted in its substantive collision with the Eurasian continent, which began during the Eocene epoch, approximately 50–55 million years ago (Ma). This collision with Asia began the orogenic uplift which has formed the Himalaya mountains, as well as the fracturing of the Indo-Australian plate into the modern Indian plate, Australian plate, and possibly Capricorn plate.

As the India plate drifted northwards at a relatively rapid rate of an average 16 cm/yr, it also rotated in a counterclockwise direction. As a result of this movement and rotation, the convergence along the plate&#x27;s eastern boundary (the Burma–Andaman–Malay region) with Eurasia was at an oblique angle.

The transform forces along this subduction front started the clockwise bending of the Sunda arc; in the late Oligocene (ca. 32 Ma) further faulting developed and the Burma and Sunda microplates began to &quot;break off&quot; from the larger Eurasian plate.

After a further series of transform faulting, and the continuing subduction of the India plate beneath the Burma plate, backarc spreading saw the formation of the marginal basin and seafloor spreading centre which would become the Andaman Sea, a process well-underway by the mid-Pliocene (3–4 Ma).

== Recent tectonic activity ==
On December 26, 2004, a large portion of the boundary between the Burma plate and the Indian plate slipped, causing the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. This megathrust earthquake had an estimated moment magnitude of 9.1–9.3 . Over of the boundary underwent thrust faulting and shifted up to vertically and horizontally. This rapid rise in the sea floor over such a short time (seven minutes) generated a massive tsunami that killed approximately 229,800 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean.

<text>The Commonwealth Transportation Board, formerly the State Highway and Transportation Board, regulates and funds transportation in Virginia.

It supervises the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT), the Department of Rail and Public Transportation (DPRT), the Department of Aviation (DOAV), the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV), the Virginia Port Authority, the Motor Vehicle Dealer Board, and the Virginia Commercial Space Flight Authority (VCSFA).

==Membership==
The Board consists of seventeen members:
*The Secretary of Transportation
*The Commissioner of the Virginia Department of Transportation
*The Director of the Virginia Department of Rail and Public Transportation
*Fourteen citizen members

The citizen members are appointed by the Governor to four-year terms, subject to confirmation by the General Assembly, and removable from office by the Governor at his pleasure. The Secretary of Transportation serves as chairman of the Board.

==Authority==
The Board has power to:

*Choose locations of routes
*Award contracts for construction, maintenance, and improvement of roads
*Make traffic regulations
*Name highways
*Enter into contracts with local entities created for transportation purposes
*Contract with other states
*Administer, distribute, and allocate funds in the Transportation Trust Fund
*Regulate outdoor theaters

All of these powers must be exercised within the framework of state law.

==Highway rest stops==
As of 2008, Virginia operated 42 rest stops and visitor centers along its interstate highways. In response to budget pressures, the Board sought public input and determined to reduce costs by closing 19 rest stops and expanding the truck parking lots at the remaining stops to accommodate the trucks that would other park and sleep at the stops designated for closing. The Board also removed the two-hour limit on truck parking. The closures began on July 21, 2009 The Board&#x27;s funding options were limited, because Federal law 23 U.S.C. §111 prohibits commercialization of interstate highway rest stops. The closing resulted in a $9 million annual saving. At the Board&#x27;s first meeting in January 2010, it reversed the decision to close the rest stops and reassigned $3 million in highway maintenance funds to keep the 19 rest stops open until the end of the fiscal year. No long-term funding source was identified.

<doc id="1336067" wikidata="Q3277180" url="?curid=1336067" title="Bhowani Junction">
<text>Bhowani Junction is a 1954 novel by British novelist John Masters, which was the basis of a 1956 film starring Ava Gardner and Stewart Granger. It is set amidst the turbulence of the British withdrawal from India. It is notable for its portrayal of the Eurasian (Anglo-Indian) community, who were caught in their loyalties between the departing British and the majority Indian population. The Anglo-Indian characters in the novel, like many members of their community, are closely involved with the Indian railway system.

==Plot summary==
The book is set in 1946/1947, shortly before India gained independence. Victoria is an Anglo-Indian, the daughter of a railwayman. Patrick Taylor, also an Anglo-Indian, considers himself her boyfriend, but her feelings towards him have become ambivalent since her experience of British Army staff culture (see below). Taylor is represented as a clumsy and resentful personality, tormented by conflicting feelings of social inferiority and racial superiority.

In vigorously defending herself from a British army officer who is attempting to rape her, Victoria unintentionally kills him. She is persuaded not to report the matter by a subordinate of Patrick&#x27;s, a Sikh, Ranjit, who hopes to marry her and whose family and friends help her to avoid detection.

Victoria had earlier decided to escape the claustrophobic atmosphere of the Anglo-Indian community by becoming a Women&#x27;s Auxiliary Corps (India) officer at army headquarters. With the war&#x27;s end and her return home, however, she is confronted with the problem of her identity all over again. She decides to get engaged to the gentle and serious Ranjit in an attempt to become assimilated in wider Indian society—since British rule is visibly on its way out—but then she realises that such a marriage would require her to give up her name (and, essentially, her identity).

She runs away from the Sikhs and literally into the arms of a veteran British officer, Rodney Savage (commander of a Gurkha battalion who &quot;have come from the war, lots of wars&quot;). Savage is, like John Masters, not only a professional soldier but also a member of a British family who have for generations served in India. Victoria originally dislikes Savage as hard and cruel but eventually becomes both his lover and his unofficial adjutant in the last hectic days of British rule in India. But in the end she realises that she cannot escape her origins, and—rejecting both the Indian man and the British one—chooses Patrick, an Anglo-Indian like herself.

Rodney Savage recognises that he is losing out to his social and intellectual inferior, but realises that he is powerless to prevent it. Patrick for his part begins to realise that, in the new India, his children might have a chance of becoming anyone they want to, rather than having to stick to the Anglo-Indians&#x27; traditional role of working on the railways.

==Themes==
The central theme of the novel, epitomised by Victoria&#x27;s own dilemma between her competing suitors, is the conflicting pressures upon the mixed-race Anglo-Indian community as Independence approaches, not confident of &quot;fitting in&quot; either in a Britain most of them have never seen, or in an independent India.

Another important theme in the novel is the significance of the developing Cold War tensions on a post-independence India. The British are resigned to leaving the country, but are desperate to have an influence on India&#x27;s future, specifically by averting the threat of a Communist takeover. The Royal Indian Navy Mutiny had been a stark reminder of Communist mutinies in the October Revolution and in post-World War I Germany.

Throughout the book the British are shown striving to support and sustain the Congress Party and its leader Mahatma Gandhi, who for so long they had been opposed to. In one passage the British character Rodney Savage reflects upon the irony of his being charged with protecting Gandhi against a terrorist assassination attempt.

According to Masters, writing in the Glossary to his earlier novel, Nightrunners of Bengal, Bhowani is an &quot;imaginary town. To get a geographical bearing on the story it should be imagined to be about where Jhansi really is - 25.27 N., 78.33 E.&quot;

==Series==
The book is one of a series of historical novels written by John Masters, set in India and involving several generations of the fictional Savage family. It has particular connections to &quot;Nightrunners of Bengal&quot;, the first novel Masters wrote in the series (though not the earliest in terms of its historical setting), which dealt with the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Both novels were set in Bhowani and its environs. Some locations, such as the Tree of the Silver Guru, appear in both novels (although the railway, which has a major role in &quot;Bhowani Junction&quot;, was in the earlier book a metalled road). In both books the protagonist is named Rodney Savage, and the WWII colonel is the direct descendant, almost a hundred years later, of the East India Company officer Rodney Savage from &quot;Nightrunners of Bengal&quot;.

Savage returns in a sequel, &quot;To the Coral Strand&quot;, where he undergoes a deep personal crisis which ends with his staying on in independent India rather than returning to Britain, and coming to terms with the new reality.

<doc id="1336073" wikidata="Q109739" url="?curid=1336073" title="Lexington Avenue">
<text>Lexington Avenue, often colloquially abbreviated as &quot;Lex&quot;, is an avenue on the East Side of Manhattan in New York City. The avenue carries southbound one-way traffic from East 131st Street to Gramercy Park at East 21st Street. Along its , 110-block route, Lexington Avenue runs through Harlem, Carnegie Hill, the Upper East Side, Midtown, and Murray Hill to a point of origin that is centered on Gramercy Park. South of Gramercy Park, the axis continues as Irving Place from 20th Street to East 14th Street.

Lexington Avenue was not one of the streets included in the Commissioners&#x27; Plan of 1811 street grid, so the addresses for cross streets do not start at an even hundred number, as they do with avenues that were originally part of the plan.

==History==

Both Lexington Avenue and Irving Place began in 1832 when Samuel Ruggles, a lawyer and real-estate developer, petitioned the New York State Legislature to approve the creation of a new north–south avenue between the existing Third and Fourth Avenues, between 14th and 30th Streets. Ruggles purchased land in the area and was developing it as a planned community of townhouses around a private park, which he called Gramercy Park. He was also developing property around Union Square and wanted the new road to improve the value of these tracts. The legislation was approved, and, as the owner of most of the land along the route of the new street, Ruggles was assessed for the majority of its cost. Ruggles named the southern section, below 20th Street, which opened in 1833, after his friend Washington Irving. The northern section, which opened three years later, in 1836, was named after the Battle of Lexington in the American Revolutionary War.

In 1899, Lexington Avenue was the location of the first arrest in New York City for speeding when a bicycle patrolman overtook cabdriver Jacob German, who had been racing down the avenue at the &quot;reckless&quot; speed of . The portion of Lexington Avenue above East 42nd Street was reconstructed at the same time as the IRT Lexington Avenue Line of the New York City Subway. The widened street and the subway line both opened on July 17, 1918.

Portions of the avenue were widened in 1955, which required eminent domain takings of the facades of some structures along Lexington.

Lexington Avenue has carried one-way (downtown) traffic since July 17, 1960.

The 2007 New York City steam explosion sent a geyser of hot steam up from beneath the avenue at 41st Street, resulting in one death and more than 40 injuries.

==Description==
===Lexington Avenue===
Lexington Avenue runs one-way southbound for its entire length from 131st Street to 21st Street. Parallel to Lexington Avenue lies Park Avenue to its west and Third Avenue to its east. The avenue is largely commercial at ground level, with offices above. There are clusters of hotels in the 30s and 40s, roughly from the avenue&#x27;s intersection with 30th Street through to its intersection with 49th Street, and apartment buildings farther north.

There are numerous structures designated as New York City Landmarks (NYCL), National Historic Landmarks (NHL), and National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) on Lexington Avenue. From south to north (in increasing address order), they include:
* Russell Sage Foundation Building and Annex (NYCL)
* George Washington Hotel, 23 Lexington Avenue (NRHP, NHL)
* 69th Regiment Armory, 68 Lexington Avenue (NRHP, NHL, NYCL)
* Chester A. Arthur House, 123 Lexington Avenue (NRHP, NHL)

* St. Jean Baptiste Roman Catholic Church, 1067-1071 Lexington Avenue (NRHP, NYCL)
* Public School 72, 1674 Lexington Avenue (NYCL)

===Irving Place===

In contrast to Lexington Avenue, the six-block stretch of Irving Place from 14th to 20th Street at Gramercy Park carries two-way traffic and is decidedly local in nature. After the opening of Union Square in 1839, the Irving Place area became one of the most sought-after residential neighborhoods in the city, a situation which was only enhanced by the development of Gramercy Park to the north and Stuyvesant Square to the east.

An assortment of restaurants and bars line Irving Place, including Pete&#x27;s Tavern, New York&#x27;s oldest surviving saloon, where O. Henry supposedly conceived of his short story &quot;The Gift of the Magi&quot;, and which survived Prohibition disguised as a flower shop. Irving Plaza, on East 15th Street and Irving, hosts numerous concerts for both well-known and indie bands and draws a crowd almost every night. Another component of the avenue are the large apartment buildings which line the street from Gramercy Park to 17th Street. Also at 17th, a small bed-and-breakfast, the Inn at Irving Place, occupies two Greek Revival architecture townhouses built in 1840–1841 and renovated between 1991 and 1995.

Historically and architecturally significant are 47 and 49 Irving Place—the latter where Washington Irving is said to have lived, but did not—which are part of the East 17th Street/Irving Place Historic District, and 19 Gramercy Park on the corner of 20th Street, part of the Gramercy Park Historic District.

Offices located on Irving Place include those of &quot;The Nation&quot; magazine, the New York branch of AMORC and the Seafarers and International House mission. There are also a number of clinics and official city buildings along the street, including Washington Irving High School and the headquarters of the New York City Human Resources Administration. The bottom of the street is anchored by the rear of the Zeckendorf Towers condominium apartment complex on the west side, and the Consolidated Edison Building on the east.
== Public transportation ==
The following buses use Lexington Avenue between the following streets (uptown buses run along Third Avenue):

* The runs from East 126th to East 124th Streets, changing direction from Harlem to Randall’s Island at East 125th Street.
* The M98 runs from East 120th to East 65th Streets. 
* The (Third and Lexington Avenues Line) run to East 24th Street from Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, East 116th Street and East 126th Street, respectively. 
* The BxM1 runs from East 106th to East 34th Streets.
* The SIM6 and SIM11 run from East 57th to East 23rd Streets.
* The SIM22 and SIM26 run from East 57th to East 42nd Streets.

The IRT Lexington Avenue Line () of the New York City Subway runs under Lexington Avenue north of 42nd Street (at Grand Central–42nd Street station) to 125th Street. South of Grand Central, this subway line runs under Park Avenue, Park Avenue South, and Fourth Avenue until Astor Place. The line interchanges with the IND Queens Boulevard Line () at Lexington Avenue/51st Street station and with the BMT Broadway Line () at Lexington Avenue/59th Street station. The Lexington Avenue–63rd Street station of the IND and BMT 63rd Street Lines () is also located at Lexington Avenue, but it does not have a direct interchange with the Lexington Avenue Line.

==In popular culture==
Lexington Avenue became part of a classic American cinematic moment in the 1955 movie &quot;The Seven Year Itch&quot; in which Marilyn Monroe shot what would become her most famous scene. While standing on a subway grating outside the Loew&#x27;s Lexington Theatre, her skirt billowed up from the wind underneath. While the footage showing the theatre in the background appeared in the finished film, the footage featuring the subway grate shot on September 15, 1954, on the corner of Lexington Avenue and 51st Street, was more of a publicity stunt; retakes were shot on a studio soundstage, and shots from both are seen in the film.

This street was also featured in the film &quot;1408&quot;.

The street is referenced in the Elton John song &quot;Island Girl&quot;, the first single from the album &quot;Rock of the Westies&quot; in 1976.
