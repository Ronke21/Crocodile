<text>Valozhyn or Volozhin (, ; ; ; ; ) is a town in Minsk Region, Belarus. It serves as the administrative center of Valozhyn District. It is located northwest of the capital Minsk, on the Valozhynka River in the Neman River basin, and the beginning of the Naliboki forest. In 1995, its population was approximately 11,500. As of 2024, it has a population of 10,015.

Before World War II, about half the town&#x27;s population were Jewish but they were murdered during the Holocaust.

==History==
===Overview===

The town was built on the main road leading from Vilnius to Minsk. It is divided into two sections: the &quot;lower neighborhood&quot; along the river and the &quot;upper neighborhood&quot; toward the hills. Half of the town square is framed by the remains of 12th century buildings, including a bell tower, a palace, and a monastery. Most of the other remaining impressive buildings in the town are from the 19th century.

Valozhyn was established as a &quot;privately owned city&quot; by Count Tyszkiewicz in the 14th century, and remained so until the 20th century. The town was known for its fertile land, mainly supporting flax growing, as well as livestock farming of horses and cattle.

In 1681 the Bernardine Monastery was established, which included a Christian college.

Within the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Valozhyn was part of Vilnius Voivodeship. In 1793, Valozhyn was acquired by the Russian Empire as a result of the Second Partition of Poland.

In 1839 Jozef Tyszkiewicz planted a large park and established a public zoo along the Valozhynka river. Three major fires, in 1815, 1880 and 1886, burned the city down, and it was rebuilt.

During World War I, Valozhyn became a strategic location, and was occupied by the Russian army. Most of the residents were allowed to stay in parts of their occupied homes. The town was attacked and bombed and most of the residents left it. In 1919 the Polish National Army took the town. After attacks on Jewish residents, a self-defense organization was established.

In the 2010s, the population declined, along with many other towns in Belarus. It was a county (powiat) centre in Nowogródek Voivodeship during Second Polish Republic period.
===Jewish Yeshiva===
The Yeshiva &quot;Etz Haim&quot;, known as the &quot;Volozhin Yeshiva&quot;, was established in 1807, by Rabbi Chaim Volozyn the owner of a large textile factory, and with the assistance of the leading Graf Tyszkiewicz. This led to an increase in the Jewish population, which by the end of the nineteenth century was roughly equal to the Christian population in the town. The Jewish religious seminary was the first of its kind, and served as a model for later similar establishments. It was closed by the authorities in 1892, but, by that time, had spawned a large number of similar institutions in Belarus, Russia and Lithuania.

===The Holocaust===

On 17 September 1939, the first day of the Soviet invasion of Poland, Valozhyn was occupied by the Red Army. On 14 November 1939, Valozhyn was incorporated into the Byelorussian SSR. All previously allowed religious studies were forbidden.

On the night of June 24–25, 1941, following the German invasion of the USSR, the NKVD started the evacuation of inmates from the local prison. After marching on foot for two days, approximately 100 prisoners were executed by the Soviets near the village of Tarasovo.

On the fourth day of Operation Barbarossa, on 25 June 1941 Valozhyn was bombed, captured by troops of the German Army Group Centre and mostly burned. Several Jews were murdered by German soldiers who entered the town. On the next day, a 12-member &quot;Judenrat&quot; was appointed by the Gestapo and shortly after Stanislaw Torsky, a member of the Polish National Democrats &quot;Endek&quot; party with strongly antisemitic views, was appointed mayor. On his second day as mayor, he ordered the arrest of the town doctor along with his daughter, and 10 other Jewish people, who were savagely beaten and shot. On 25 July 1941, Valozhyn was placed under the administration of the newly formed &quot;Generalbezirk Weißruthenien&quot; of &quot;Reichskommissariat Ostland&quot;. In August 1941, the Jewish residents of the town, approximately 3500 people, were moved to a ghetto in the &quot;Aropzu&quot; neighbourhood, along with Jewish residents from the neighboring towns Vishnyeva, Halshany and Ashmyany.

The Jews, as well as Russian prisoners in the area, were subjected to forced labour, tortured, underfed, and many of them publicly murdered. Local Christians who were caught having mercy or assisting the Jews in giving food received a similar fate.

On October 28, 1941, The head of the Gestapo, named Moka, ordered all the Jews in the ghetto to stand at a lecture of his, on work ethics. He freed most of them and kept around 200 people in the town&#x27;s cinema. From there he took groups of 10 to a pit in the nearby forest and had them shot. Among the murdered was Jakob (Jani) Garber, the head of the &quot;Judenrat&quot;. Belarus police then stripped the dead of their belongings and covered the pit. Three people escaped and told the townspeople what had occurred.

Public killings continued, including an incident where several Jews were forced to lie down on a spread Torah Scroll and were subsequently shot.

On May 10, 1942, the Jews of Valozhyn were blamed for the killing of three Germans by Belarusian partisans several days earlier. At 5 a.m., the ghetto was cordoned by Belarus and Polish police along with the SS. They entered the ghetto, killed the two Jewish policemen at the gate, and then began shooting and gathering the Jews into a large blacksmith shop, where they set a table with drinks surrounded by machine guns. While drinking and singing they shot into the building &quot;to silence the crying&quot;. Inside the building, an argument ensued where some called to die while resisting, but the leading rabbi called on the people to keep up hopes till the last minute.

The head of the police then called over a member of the &quot;Judenrat&quot; to polish his boots. When the man bent down, the policeman shot him in the head. This caused the Jews in the building who were able to watch this, to escape while scrambling to the roof and jumping off. Most were shot, but about 12 people escaped. The rest were held in the building till 5 p.m., and were then marched off to the forest in groups of children, women, elderly men and the rest, many in their prayer shawls and phylacteries from the morning prayers. They were marched through the Christian quarter, where they were met by dancing young men and women, singing, playing music and mocking the marched.

The people were taken to a house (&quot;the Bulowa house&quot;) near the cemetery, and shot. The house was then set on fire.

A short while afterward the remaining Jews of Valozhyn were taken to the graveyard, forced to dig a large pit and were then buried alive by tractors and tanks who drove over them.

On 5 July 1944, Valozhyn was recaptured by troops of the Soviet 3rd Belorussian Front during the Vilnius Offensive. Following its liberation, several Jews who returned openly to Valozhyn were murdered by local townspeople.

A raion is a type of administrative unit of several post-Soviet states, translated as &quot;district&quot; in English. It was initially raion centre in Navahrudak Voblast (1939), later in Baranavichy Voblast (1939–1944) and Molodechno Voblast (1944–1960) before passing to Minsk Region.

<doc id="1337917" wikidata="Q494373" url="?curid=1337917" title="Dudo">
<text>Dudo (Spanish for &quot;I doubt&quot;), also known as Cacho, Pico, Perudo, Liar&#x27;s Dice, Peruvian Liar Dice, Cachito, or Dadinho is a popular dice game played in South America. It is a more specific version of a family of games collectively called Liar&#x27;s Dice, which has many forms and variants. This game can be played by two or more players and consists of guessing how many dice, placed under cups, there are on the table showing a certain number. The player who loses a round loses one of their dice. The last player to still have dice is the winner.

==Game play==

Each player starts having five dice and a cup, which is used for shaking the dice and concealing the dice from the other players.

To decide order of play (who starts and who goes next), players roll a single die. Highest roll goes first, then next lowest and so on. In the event of a tie between 2 players, they simply re-roll until one gains a higher score.

Each game round begins with the players shaking the dice in their cups, then slamming upside down cup on table so that shaken dice remain concealed fully inside the cup. Players carefully lift the cups to look at their own dice while keeping them concealed from other players. The first player then makes a bid about how many dice of a certain value are showing among all players, at a minimum. Aces (dice showing a one) are wild, meaning that they count as any other number. For example: a bid of &quot;five threes&quot; is a claim that there are at least five dice showing a three or an ace, when you tally up all the dice across all players in the table. The player challenges the next player (moving clockwise) to raise the bid or call &quot;dudo&quot; to end the round.

;Raise: also known as &quot;bid&quot; in most versions, a player can increase the quantity of dice (e.g. from &quot;five threes&quot; to &quot;six threes&quot;) or the die number (e.g. &quot;five threes&quot; to &quot;five sixes&quot;) or both. If a player increases the quantity, they can choose any number e.g. a bid may increase from &quot;five threes&quot; to &quot;six twos&quot;.

;Bidding aces: a player who wishes to bid aces can halve the quantity of dice, rounding upwards. For instance, if the current bid is &quot;five threes&quot; then the next player would have to bid at least three aces. If the current bid is aces, the next player can call &quot;dudo&quot; or increase the quantity (e.g. &quot;four aces&quot;) or bid a different number, in which case the lower bound on the quantity is one more than double the previous quantity—for instance, from &quot;three aces&quot;, a player wishing to bid fours would have to bid &quot;seven fours&quot; or higher. Players are not allowed to begin a round betting on aces unless they have only one die left.
;Call: also known as &quot;dudo&quot;, if the player calls, it means that they do not believe the previous bid was correct. All dice are then shown and, if the guess is not correct, the previous player (the player who made the bid) loses a die. If it is correct, the player who called loses a die. A player with no dice remaining is eliminated from the game. After calling, a new round starts with the player that lost a die making the first bid, or (if that player was eliminated) the player to that player&#x27;s left.
;Spot on: also known &quot;calzo&quot; (etymology: perfect shoe fit) in some versions, the player claims that the previous bidder&#x27;s bid is exactly right. If the number is higher or lower, the claimant loses one or two dice, depending on the agreed upon rules. Otherwise, they recover a lost die. This is a reward for incurring on additional risk. Regardless of the outcome of the spot on, the previous bidder will not lose a die. The spot on can be played for as long as there is more than half of the original number of dice left on the table.
;Pass: The player decides not to place a bid. A pass is legal if the player has a full house (a pair and three of a kind), five of a kind, or five different suits. Two players cannot pass in a row, and each player can only pass once per round. Passes can be bluffed, and they can also be called out. After a player passes, the next player cannot call the previous bid, and can only call the pass. This rule only exists in some versions of dudo, and must be agreed upon before gameplay begins.
;Burn: A player has the option to &quot;burn&quot; some of their dice by revealing their hand, presenting one or a chosen set of dice of the same suit, putting the rest of the dice back in the cup, and re-rolling them. The revealed dice remain in play, and the entire table can see them. This is useful for when a player feels like they have a bad hand. It cannot be done when the player has only one die.
;Shuffle: An illegal move, where a player covertly uses one of their fingers (often their thumb) to shift one or many of their dice, to show another face. If caught, this brands that player as a &quot;mete dedo&quot; (Spanish for &#x27;putter of finger inside&#x27;) and eliminates them from the match instantly, often incurring a punishment for cheating. Punishments are often commonly understood or pre-established, such as having to do a cold plunge, or to buy a round of drinks for all the players.

Different versions of the game divide the lifeline of a player differently. In some versions, when a player first reaches one die (i.e. loses a round and goes from two dice to one), the player &quot;obliga&quot; (meaning &quot;they coerce&quot;) the round. In this kind of special round—often known as &quot;palo fijo&quot;—aces don&#x27;t count as wildcards, and the suit can only be changed by players with a single die. The player gets to choose if they play the round open or closed. In an open round, everyone can see everybody&#x27;s dice but their own. However, in a closed round, only the players with one die remaining can see their dice. In some other versions, the &quot;palo fijo&quot; happens on a player reaching their last two dice, and involves nobody being able to change the suit, as well as aces not counting as wildcards for the round. Then, upon a player reaching their last die, what begins is a &quot;palo ciego&quot;—nobody is allowed to see their hand, except for players that only have one die in theirs, and the bids must be done blindly. Often, players do not slam their cups before the round is called, to add tension.

The game ends when only one player has dice remaining; that player is the winner.

<text>Far Out Space Nuts is a Sid and Marty Krofft children&#x27;s television series that aired in 1975 for one season, and produced 15 episodes. It was one of only two Krofft series produced exclusively for CBS (the second being 1984&#x27;s &quot;Pryor&#x27;s Place&quot;). Reruns of the show aired in daily syndication from 1978 to 1985 as part of the &quot;Krofft Superstars&quot; package with six other Krofft series.

==Plot==
Like most of the Kroffts&#x27;s productions, the show&#x27;s opening sequence provides the setup of its fanciful premise: While loading food into various compartments to prepare a rocket for an upcoming mission, Barney instructs Junior to hit the &quot;lunch&quot; button, but Junior mistakenly hits the &quot;launch&quot; button. The rocket blasts off and takes them on various misadventures on alien planets.

Typically, in each episode, their spaceship (a NASA lunar module) would be captured by aliens (one being played by John Carradine, who so impressed Denver with his acting skills during a scene that he was left speechless and missed his cue, requiring another take) and taken to some strange planet, or the spaceship would merely land somewhere. Then, either Barney and Junior, or the ship, would be taken away by the strange creatures on the planet. After some weird mission was carried out, the two astronauts would be reunited with the spaceship and be off on their next mission.

==Cast==
The show starred Bob Denver as Junior, a grey-haired (Denver was 40 years old at the time) and seemingly dim-witted but uniquely clever NASA maintenance worker, and Chuck McCann as Barney, his plump and grumpy co-worker. Patty Maloney played Honk, their furry little alien friend who made honking sounds out of the horn on the top of his head instead of speaking.

<text>&quot;The Adventure of the Devil&#x27;s Foot&quot; from 1910 is one of the 56 Sherlock Holmes short stories written by Arthur Conan Doyle. It is one of eight stories in the cycle collected as &quot;His Last Bow&quot;.

Doyle ranked &quot;The Adventure of the Devil&#x27;s Foot&quot; ninth in his list of his twelve favorite Holmes stories.

==Plot==
Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson find themselves at Poldhu in Cornwall one spring. The holiday ends when the local vicar Mr. Roundhay and his lodger Mortimer Tregennis visit Holmes, asking for his assistance. The night before, Tregennis had gone to visit his three siblings, played whist with them, and then left. The next morning, the housekeeper found the trio still sitting in their places at the table; the brothers, George and Owen, had gone insane, and the sister, Brenda, was dead.

Dr. Leon Sterndale, a famous hunter-explorer and a cousin of the Tregennises, aborts his sailing from Plymouth after the vicar wires him with the tragic news. He asks Holmes what his suspicions are, and is displeased when Holmes will not voice them.

The next morning, the vicar informs Holmes that Mortimer Tregennis has died in the same way as his sister. The two men, along with Watson, rush to Mortimer&#x27;s room. A lamp is lit and smoking on the table beside the dead man. Holmes deduces that a poison, activated by combustion and affecting the cognitive functions, is the murder weapon; there were fires burning in both murder rooms, and people who entered them either felt ill or fainted. After a dangerous experiment in which he tests the residue of the poison on himself and is only just rescued by Watson, Holmes reveals that Mortimer Tregennis is guilty of the first crime and further deduces that Dr. Sterndale was Mortimer&#x27;s murderer.

Dr. Sterndale confesses that he held Mortimer at gunpoint and forced him to breathe the poison. It comes from a plant called the Devil’s-foot root. Sterndale once described the powder to Mortimer Tregennis, who later stole some from Sterndale&#x27;s collection of African curiosities, then murdered his siblings by throwing it on the fire just before he left. It is revealed that Sterndale was passionately in love with Brenda Tregennis, but was still married to and unable to divorce his first wife who had abandoned him years ago. Holmes&#x27; sympathies in this matter lie with Sterndale, and he tells him to go back to his work in Africa and never return.

==Publication history==

&quot;The Adventure of the Devil&#x27;s Foot&quot; was first published in the UK in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in December 1910. It was first published in the United States in the US edition of the &quot;Strand&quot; in January and February 1911. The story was published with seven illustrations by Gilbert Holiday in the &quot;Strand&quot;, and with eight illustrations in the US edition of the &quot;Strand&quot;. An extra illustration was needed for the story&#x27;s publication in two parts. The story was included in the short story collection &quot;His Last Bow&quot;, which was published in the UK and the US in October 1917.

The original manuscript of the story is now part of the Berg Collection at the New York Public Library.

==Adaptations==

===Film and television===
&quot;The Devil&#x27;s Foot&quot; served as the basis for a 1921 short film starring Eille Norwood as Sherlock Holmes and Hubert Willis as Dr. Watson.

It was adapted as an episode of the 1965 television series &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; starring Douglas Wilmer (with Nigel Stock as Dr Watson and Patrick Troughton as Mortimer Tregennis).

The story was adapted as a 1988 episode of &quot;The Return of Sherlock Holmes&quot; starring Jeremy Brett as Holmes and Edward Hardwicke as Watson.

The first episode of the HBO Asia/Hulu series &quot;Miss Sherlock&quot; has a digestible pill-bomb called the Devil&#x27;s Foot.

===Radio===
The story was dramatised by Edith Meiser as an episode of the American radio series &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. The episode aired on 8 October 1931, with Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson. Other episodes adapted from the story aired on 17 February 1935 (with Louis Hector as Holmes and Lovell as Watson) and 30 May 1936 (with Gordon as Holmes and Harry West as Watson).

Meiser also adapted the story as an episode of the American radio series &quot;The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; that aired on 30 October 1939. Other dramatisations of the story were broadcast on 21 May 1943 and 10 July 1944. All three productions starred Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson. In an adaptation that aired on 13 January 1947, Tom Conway played Holmes with Bruce as Watson. Max Ehrlich adapted the story as an episode that aired on 31 January 1949 (with John Stanley as Holmes and Wendell Holmes as Watson).

&quot;The Devil&#x27;s Foot&quot; was adapted for the BBC Light Programme in 1962 by Michael Hardwick, as part of the 1952–1969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson.

&quot;The Devil&#x27;s Foot&quot; was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 1994 by Bert Coules as part of the 1989–1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson, featuring Patrick Allen as Leon Sterndale, Geoffrey Beevers as Reverend Roundhay, and Sean Arnold as Mortimer Tregennis.

In 2014, the story was adapted for radio as an episode of &quot;The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, a series on the American radio show &quot;Imagination Theatre&quot;, with John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson.

<doc id="1337980" wikidata="Q1346991" url="?curid=1337980" title="Luke Air Force Base">
<text>Luke Air Force Base is a United States Air Force base in Maricopa County, Arizona, United States. It is located west of the central business district of Glendale, and west of Phoenix.

Luke AFB is a major training base of the Air Education and Training Command (AETC), training pilots in the F-16 Fighting Falcon. On 31 March 2011, the F-35 Lightning II was announced to be replacing the F-16 as the primary training aircraft at Luke, although the date of deployment of the new aircraft to Luke and reorganization plans were not announced. On 16 July 2013, the Air Force announced that Luke AFB will house a total of 144 F-35A Lightning IIs. The first F-35A Lightning II arrived to the base on March 10, 2014.

It is a designated superfund site due to a number of soil and groundwater contaminants.

==History==

===Frank Luke Jr.===
Luke Air Force Base was named after Second Lieutenant Frank Luke (1897–1918). Lt Luke is a posthumous Medal of Honor recipient and the number-two United States flying ace in World War I.

Born in Phoenix in 1897, the &quot;Arizona Balloon Buster&quot; scored 18 aerial victories during World War I (14 of these German observation balloons) in the skies over France. Lieutenant Luke was shot down at Murvaux between Verdun and Stenay, France, on 29 September 1918, after he had destroyed three enemy balloons. Surviving the crash of his SPAD S.XIII, Lieutenant Luke drew two pistols and fired on German soldiers, killing several of them before he was killed.

Luke Field, Oahu, Hawaii Territory (now the Naval Air Station Ford Island), was previously named in his honor.

=== Origins ===
In 1940, the U.S. Army sent a representative to Arizona to choose a site for a U.S. Army Air Corps training field for advanced training in conventional fighter aircraft. The city of Phoenix bought of land, which they leased to the government at $1 a year effective 24 March 1941. On 29 March 1941, the Del. E. Webb Construction Co. began excavation for the first building at what was known then as Litchfield Park Air Base. Another base known as Luke Field, in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, released its name so the Arizona base could be called Luke Field. Advanced flight training in the AT-6 Texan began at Luke in June that same year. The first class of 45 students, Class 41 F, arrived on 6 June 1941 to begin advanced flight training in the AT-6, although a few essential buildings had been completed. Flying out of Sky Harbor Airport until the Luke runways were ready, pilots received 10 weeks of instruction and the first class graduated 15 August 1941. Then-captain Barry Goldwater served as director of ground training the following year.

===World War II===
During World War II, Luke Field was the largest fighter training base in the U.S. Army Air Forces, graduating more than 12,000 fighter pilots from advanced and operational courses earning the nickname &quot;Home of the Fighter Pilot&quot;.

The base was under the control of the 37th Flying Training Wing (Advanced Single-Engine), Western Flying Training Command, AAF Flying Training Command. During the years of World War II, more than 17,000 pilots trained at Luke Field, making it the largest single-engine advanced flying training school in the U.S. More than a million hours of flying were logged, primarily in the AT-6 Texan, along with some transitioning to P-40 Warhawk fighters and later the P-51 Mustang and P-47 Thunderbolt.

Although continually modified during the war years, the course of advanced flight training at Luke averaged about 10 weeks and included both flight training and ground school. Around 60 hours of flying instruction covered formation flying, navigation, and instrument flying, as well as a bit of aerial acrobatics. About 20 additional hours of flight practice concentrated on aerial and gunnery training.

Ground school, or classroom training for the advanced flying course, varied from about 100 to 130 hours and was intermingled with flight time in the aircraft. Cadets flew in the morning and attended ground school in the afternoons, or flew training missions in the afternoon after a morning of ground school. At the peak of the training program at Luke, some students were required to attend night classes. Ground school included instruction in navigation, flight planning, radio equipment, maintenance, and weather.

By 7 February 1944, pilots at Luke had achieved a million hours of flying time. By 1946, however, the number of pilots trained dropped to 299 and the base was deactivated 30 November that year.

A World War II film, &quot;A Guy Named Joe&quot;, included some footage filmed at Luke.

===United States Air Force===

====Air Training Command====

Soon after combat started in Korea, Luke field was reactivated on 1 February 1951 as Luke Air Force Base, part of the Air Training Command (ATC) under the reorganized United States Air Force (USAF). A steady pipeline of trained bomber-escort pilots was needed by Strategic Air Command (SAC), and the mission of Luke AFB was to augment the jet fighter combat crew training in operation at Nellis AFB. The school at Luke was designated by ATC as the USAF Air Crew School (Fighter Bomber/Escort).

The program was to be conducted by the Federalized Michigan Air National Guard 127th Fighter Group, which had transferred from Continental Air Command to ATC, effective 10 February. The wing moved from Romulus Airport, Michigan, to Luke on 23 February, and on 1 March ATC established the USAF Air Crew School (Fighter-Bomber/Escort) at Luke. Fighter-bomber training began on 1 March 1951 in the P-51 Mustang, being replaced by early-model F-84C Thunderjets.

Effective 5 March, the 127th was redesignated as the 127th Pilot Training Wing. On 1 November 1952, the active-duty 3600th Flying Training Wing (Fighter), under Commander Charles F. Born, replaced the Air National Guardsmen. ATC flying training squadrons at Luke included:
* 3601st Fighter Interceptor (later Combat Crew Training) Squadron, 1 November 1952 – 31 December 1957
* 3602d Fighter Interceptor (later Combat Crew Training) Squadron, 20 November 1952 – 31 December 1957
* 3603d Fighter Interceptor (later Combat Crew Training) Squadron, 20 November 1952 – 31 December 1957
* 3604th Fighter Interceptor (later Combat Crew Training) Squadron, 20 November 1952 – 31 December 1957

The 3600th FTW became the dedicated training organization for both USAF and NATO pilots in the F-84. The F-84D began having electrical problems with the hot, dry Arizona air, which dried out the aircraft&#x27;s electrical insulation. They were replaced by F-84E, and shortly afterwards to the F-84G, which was then in use by SAC. In October 1954, ATC redesignated the 3600th as a &quot;Combat Crew Training Wing&quot; to describe its mission better.

In January 1954, the swept-wing F-84F Thunderstreak began to arrive, and three additional dedicated squadrons were activated:
* 3605th Fighter Interceptor (later Combat Crew Training) Squadron, 12 May 1954 – 31 December 1957
* 3606th Fighter Interceptor (later Combat Crew Training) Squadron, 12 May – 13 October 1954
: Redesignated 3607th Combat Crew Training Squadron, 20 October 1954 – 10 June 1957
* 3608th Fighter Interceptor (later Combat Crew Training) Squadron, 12 May 1954 – 31 December 1957

F-84Fs replaced the straight-winged earlier models in the original four squadrons by the end of 1956, giving the wing seven squadrons of 21 aircraft each, or about 150 aircraft; 30 more were received in 1957 as some of the older production blocks were transferred to Air National Guard units or to reclamation at Davis-Monthan AFB.

For several years, the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project at Sandia Base, New Mexico, had provided all atomic, biological, and chemical (ABC) warfare training for the USAF. Beginning in October 1954, ATC added ABC instruction to its fighter-pilot programs at Luke and Nellis. In addition, ATC established six general ABC courses to train aircrews already in the field, using mobile training teams.

=====Formation of the USAF Thunderbirds=====

On 25 May 1953 the 3600th Air Demonstration Team was officially organized and established at Luke, still officially carrying this designation, now known as the United States Air Force Thunderbirds. At Luke, the squadron initially operated F-84G Thunderjets, as the aircraft had to be able to show how good training made a typical aircraft easy to handle. The aircraft had to be stable for maneuvers in formation, reliable enough to meet show schedules, and rugged for the demonstration team. In addition, the F-84G was the first fighter in the USAF with aerial refueling capability. To convert the aircraft from combat to demonstration, technicians removed the guns and plugged the gun ports.

In 1955, the USAF selected the swept-wing F-84F Thunderstreak as their second aircraft. The Thunderstreak was modified for the team by adding smoke tanks for the first time, and red, white, and blue drag chutes. In addition, the extreme heat from the lead aircraft, , required moving the slot&#x27;s radio antenna from the jet&#x27;s fin. For the first time, a solo was added to the diamond displays, increasing the show time to 19 minutes.

The unit was reassigned to Nellis AFB, Nevada on 23 June 1956.

====Tactical Air Command====
=====4510th Combat Crew Training Wing=====
======F-100 Super Sabre era======
By the end of 1957, ATC basing structure had changed considerably as the result of tactical commitments, decreased student load, and fund shortages. During 1958, ATC discontinued its Flying Training and Technical Training Air Force. As a result, Luke AFB was transferred to Tactical Air Command (TAC). This reassignment came about as the result of a USAF-directed study of the feasibility of putting combat crew training under the appropriate zone of interior operational commands.

With the transfer to TAC, the ATC 3600th FTW was redesignated as the 4510th Combat Crew Training Wing, and flying training at Luke was changed to the F-100 Super Sabre. F-100 training squadrons were:
* 4511th Combat Crew Training Squadron, 1 January 1958 – 1 October 1964 (formerly ATC 3601st CCTW)
* 4512th Combat Crew Training Squadron, 1 January 1958 – 15 October 1969 (formerly ATC 3602d CCTW)
* 4513th Combat Crew Training Squadron, 1 January – 1 November 1958 (formerly ATC 3603d CCTW)
* 4514th Combat Crew Training Squadron, 1 January 1958 – 15 December 1969 (formerly ATC 3604th CCTW)
* 4515th Combat Crew Training Squadron, 1 January 1958 – 18 January 1970 (formerly ATC 3605th CCTW)
* 4516th Combat Crew Training Squadron, 1 January 1958 – 1 April 1970 (formerly ATC 3608th CCTW)

During the 1960s, thousands of American fighter pilots left Luke to fly missions in the skies over Vietnam in the F-100. In July 1968, the first &quot;LA&quot; tail codes were placed on the tails of Luke-based aircraft.

=====58th Tactical Fighter Training Wing=====
======F-4 Phantom II era======
The 58th Tactical Fighter Training Wing replaced the provisional 4510th CCTW on 15 October 1969. Although Luke remained under the jurisdiction of TAC, the HQ USAF-controlled (AFCON) 58th TFTW gave the wing at Luke a permanent lineage and history that the TAC provisional wing could not carry.

The provisional squadrons of the 4510th were redesignated as:
* 310th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron (formerly 4514th CCTS)
* 311th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron (formerly 4515th CCTS)
* 425th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron (GSU at Williams AFB, Arizona)
* 426th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron (formerly 4515th CCTS)
* 550th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron (formerly 4516th CCTS)
* 69th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron (formerly 4518th CCTS) (F-104G West German training squadron)*
* 418th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron (formerly 4519th CCTS) (F-104G West German training squadron)*

Upon activation of the 310th TFTS, the squadron began receiving new A-7D Corsair II ground-attack aircraft from Ling-Temco-Vought, with a mission to train USAF pilots in the new aircraft. Its F-100s were reassigned to other squadrons, which flew the F-100s of the 4510th CCTS. The 310th TFTS sent its A-7Ds to the 333d TFS at Davis-Monthan AFB in July 1971, and became an F-4C RTU.

The 425th TFTS was assigned to the 58th as a geographically separate unit in 1969, assigned to Williams AFB. The squadron was established in December 1963 as the 4441st CCTS, with a mission to train Republic of Vietnam Air Force pilots on the Northrup F-5A Freedom Fighter. The F-5 training continued at Williams after the end of the Vietnam War, becoming a squadron to train Military Assistance Program pilots from over 20 nations on the F-5. It was discontinued in 1989 and the 425th was inactivated.

In the summer of 1971, the 58th TFTW received F-4C Phantom IIs, and the wing assumed the F-4 pilot-training role that was formerly done by the 4453d CCTW at Davis-Monthan, when that base was converted to an operational A-7D base by the arrival of the 355th TFW from Takhli RTAFB, Thailand.

======F-15 Eagle era======
In November 1974, the Air Force&#x27;s newest air superiority fighter, the F-15 Eagle, came to Luke. To accommodate the F-15, the 555th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron was activated. The early F-15As, however, were quite troublesome, with engine problems limiting their effectiveness and availability.

In June 1976, a second F-15 training squadron was established, with the 4461st Tactical Fighter Training Squadron standing up on 23 June. The assets of the 4461st TFTS were redesignated as 461st Tactical Fighter Training Squadron on 1 July 1977. The 550th TFTS traded in its F-4s in August 1977, becoming the third F-15 training squadron. The F-15As, which remained troublesome throughout the 1970s, were replaced in 1982 with the updated F-15D.

On 25 August 1979, the 405th Tactical Training Wing was activated at Luke by TAC to consolidate the F-15 Eagle Replacement Training Unit operations. It took over the 425th, 461st 550th and 555th Tactical Fighter Training Squadrons

The 426th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron converted from F-4 Phantom II to F-15 training in January 1981 specifically to support the TAC Air Defense Command training mission inherited from the inactivated Aerospace Defense Command, which was merged into TAC. On 19 November 1990, the 555th TFTS changed its course from air superiority combat training with the Eagle to air defense interceptor training with the F-15C/D when TAC began assigning F-15s to interceptor duty, the 426th being inactivated.

The 461st TFTS received its first F-15E Strike Eagle in July 1988, and the 550th TFTS became the second F-15E training squadron in March 1989.

On 1 October 1991, due to the implementation of the Objective Wing at Luke and the &quot;One base, one wing&quot; policy, the 405th TTW was shut down and the F-15s were reassigned back to the 58th TTW. Between 1977 and 1991, Luke AFB had more fighter aircraft than any other base which earned the moniker “Fighter Country,” which was prominently displayed around the base.

In 1993, First Lt. Jeannie M. Flynn became the first woman to complete training in the F-15E Strike Eagle at Luke. After earning a master&#x27;s degree in aerospace engineering from Stanford University, she graduated first in her UPT class at Laughlin AFB in December 1992, and chose the F-15 after USAF Chief of Staff General Merrill McPeak opened the door for women to fly combat aircraft.

======F-16 Falcon era======
The 310th and 311th TFTS retained their F-4Cs until April 1982, ending the Phantom era at Luke, receiving Block 1 F-16A Fighting Falcons in November 1982 and April 1983. Luke-based F-16s began carrying tail codes &quot;LF&quot;. 310th TFTS officially began training fighter pilots 2 February 1983.
* 312th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron, activated on 1 October 1984, first F-16C squadron in the Air Force
* 314th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron, activated on 1 October 1986, second F-16C squadron in the Air Force

In 1990, Luke AFB was placed on the National Priorities List, often called the superfund list in 1990. After many years of cleanup and remediation, on 22 April, it 2002 became the first USAF base to be removed from the list, after satisfying the requirement to remove pollution dating back as far as World War II.

=====58th Operations Group=====
The end of the Cold War in the early 1990s brought significant changes to the base. On 1 October 1991, the 58th Tactical Training Wing adopted the Air Force Objective Organization Plan, and was redesignated simply as the 58th Fighter Wing (58 FW). All operational fighter training squadrons were reassigned to the new 58th Operations Group (58 OG). Training units also redesignated as &quot;fighter squadrons&quot;. Units assigned to the 58 OG were:
* 310th Fighter Squadron, F-16C/D Fighting Falcon
* 311th Fighter Squadron, F-16C/D Fighting Falcon
* 312th Fighter Squadron, inactivated, aircraft to 310th, 311th, 314th FS
* 314th Fighter Squadron, F-16C/D Fighting Falcon
* 461st Fighter Squadron, F-15E Strike Eagle (reassigned back from 405th FW, 1 October 1991)
* 550th Fighter Squadron, F-15E Strike Eagle (reassigned back from 405th FW, 1 October 1991)
* 555th Fighter Squadron, F-15C/D Eagle (reassigned back from 405th FW, 1 October 1991)

In 1991, the Base Realignment and Closure commission ordered that all flightline activities cease at MacDill AFB by 1993. The host unit at MacDill AFB, the 56th Fighter Wing, moved its F-16 training to Luke AFB, and Luke became an exclusive F-16 Fighting Falcon training base. The F-15s were reassigned to Seymour Johnson AFB, North Carolina, to accommodate additional F-16 training at Luke.

In addition, the 58th Fighter Wing was inactivated and moved to Kirtland AFB, New Mexico, with the historical senior 56th FW taking over all assets at Luke. At Kirtland, the wing was redesignated as the 58th Special Operations Wing, leaving all aircraft and equipment at Luke, and reassigned to Air Force Special Operations Command, replacing the Air Training Command 542d Crew Training Wing.

On 1 June 1992, Tactical Air Command was inactivated, and the new Air Combat Command (ACC) replaced it, assuming jurisdiction of Luke AFB.

On 30 December 1992, the 425th Fighter Squadron was activated at Luke AFB. The mission of the 425th was to provide advanced weapons and tactics continuation for Republic of Singapore Air Force&#x27;s F-16 pilots and maintenance personnel. Aircraft had already arrived for the squadron in October and shortly after in the new year, pilot training began in January 1993.

====Air Education and Training Command====
On 1 April 1994, after 24 years at Luke AFB, the 58th Fighter Wing was replaced by the 56th Fighter Wing (56 FW), relocated from MacDill AFB, Florida, due to Base Realignment and Closure Commission action, as part of the Air Force Heritage Program. With the reassignment, jurisdiction of Luke AFB was transferred to Air Education and Training Command (AETC), Nineteenth Air Force (19 AF) as a result of the Air Force deciding to consolidate all Air Force training programs under AETC. The 56th Operations Group assumed control over all operational fighter squadrons.

The transfer of Luke to AETC gave the command front-line aircraft, bases, and facilities that could be used for realistic operational training. With the return of AETC to Luke, producing a task-certified or more mission-ready apprentice became possible, and operational units could reduce the amount of on-the-job training provided to new airmen.

Within a year, the wing realignment to make the 56 OG an exclusive F-16 group took place. The 555th Fighter Squadron was reassigned to USAFE on 25 March 1994 as part of a realignment of Aviano AB, Italy; its F-15C/D Eagles were sent to Tyndall AFB, Florida, where F-15 air defense interceptor training was being consolidated under the First Air Force. The F-15E Strike Eagle squadrons (461st, 550th) were also inactivated, with their Strike Eagles being sent to Seymour Johnson AFB under the 4th Fighter Wing.

F-15 training ended with the last &quot;LA&quot; tail coded F-15 (Luke Arizona) leaving on 26 September 1995, when the 550th Fighter Squadron inactivated, 21 years after the first TF-15A arrived at Luke.

With the transfer of the Eagles, additional F-16 training units were assigned to the 56 OG, all tail-coded &quot;LF&quot; (Luke Falcons):
* 61st Fighter Squadron, 1 April 1994 (formerly at MacDill AFB)
* 62d Fighter Squadron, 18 March 1994 (formerly at MacDill AFB)
* 63d Fighter Squadron, 1 April 1994 (formerly at MacDill AFB)
* 308th Fighter Squadron, reassigned from 58th OG
* 309th Fighter Squadron, reassigned from 58th OG
* 310th Fighter Squadron, reassigned from 58th OG
* 425th Fighter Squadron, reassigned from 58th OG (joint USAF-RSAF unit)

The 21st Fighter Squadron was activated on 8 August 1996 to train Taiwanese Republic of China Air Force F-16A/B crews at Luke AFB. Empty hangars were refurbished and aircrews were pulled in from other units on base. By January 1997, several ROCAF F-16A/B block 20s had been delivered and the first training flights began for their crews. Despite being A/B models, the aircraft were new construction from General Dynamics, with modern avionics and engines, and were considered to be more advanced than the F-16C/Ds being flown from Luke AFB. The aircraft carry USAF markings and serial numbers, and also the &quot;LF&quot; tail code.

On 20 September 1999, an F-16D crashed at Luke AFB, marking the 56th Fighter Wing&#x27;s seventh class-A mishap in FY &#x27;99. In all cases, the pilots ejected safely. Engine problems caused most of the mishaps. The 56th Fighter Wing commander, Brig. Gen. John Barry, grounded the wing&#x27;s F-16s after the second mishap. Maintenance personnel discovered that engine augmentor ducts had failed in both cases. They developed a new inspection procedure to identify cracks, which was subsequently used throughout the Air Force. A manufacturing defect in turbine blades was responsible for many of the mishaps, and General Barry grounded the fleet a second time to allow maintainers to upgrade the turbine blades, which improved safety.

On 8 March 2000, the 50,000th fighter pilot had graduated from Luke AFB, Arizona, since the Army Air Forces started training at this location in July 1941.

After the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks, Luke suspended routine flight-training operations, as the Federal Aviation Administration shut down the nation&#x27;s airways to all but select military flights. Aircraft of the 56th Fighter Wing were deployed to fly combat air patrols over New York City and Washington, DC, in the immediate aftermath of the attacks in support of Operation Noble Eagle. Although the 56th Fighter Wing does not deploy aircraft to United States Air Forces Central Command Expeditionary units as part of the Global War on Terrorism, Luke airmen routinely deploy to USAFCENT in AEF deployment cycles, engaging in combat in support of Operation Enduring Freedom; Operation Iraqi Freedom, and other expeditionary operations as tasked.

On March 28, 2001, Arizona governor Jane Dee Hull signed new legislation to protect military airfields, such as Luke Air Force Base, in Arizona. The law was one of the first by any state created to protect military airfields. It called for compatible use of the land around the airfields. Arizona later created other legislation to further increase the protections of Air Force bases in the state, especially Luke. Later that same year, in June the base&#x27;s new $3.8-million control tower went into operation.

In 2002, the 56th Fighter Wing became responsible for the nearby Barry M. Goldwater Training Range, and was concerned that urban development near the base would curtail flight training if left unchecked. In addition, the munitions storage area (MSA) stood outside of the base compound, adding a burden to the Security Forces Squadron. In October 2002, Senator John McCain of Arizona shepherded a MILCON funding insert of $13 million to purchase needed to incorporate the MSA into the base perimeter and to acquire additional land to preserve access to the Goldwater Range.

BRAC 2005 directed that the older Block 25 F-16s be sent to Air National Guard units; this change reduced the number of fighter squadrons, with the 61st and 63d Fighter Squadrons inactivating in 2009 and 2010.

In 2005, the 56th Fighter Wing at Luke Air Force Base was the largest fighter unit in the world. This unit was made up of eight fighter squadrons (21st, 61st, 62nd, 63rd, 308th, 309th, 310th and 425th) which used an air fleet of 189 F-16 Fighter Falcons.

====Air Defense Command====
In 1959, Air Defense Command established a Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) Data Center (DC-21) at Luke AFB. The SAGE system was a network linking Air Force (and later FAA) general-surveillance radar stations into a centralized center for air defense, intended to provide early warning and response for a Soviet nuclear attack. It was initially under the Phoenix Air Defense Sector, established on 15 June 1959. It was inactivated on 1 April 1966, and redesignated as the 27th Air Division. DC-21 with its AN/FSQ-7 computer remained under the 27th AD until 19 November 1969, when it was inactivated and its assets absorbed by the 26th Air Division. DC-21 was inactivated on 9 December 1983, when technology advances made SAGE obsolete.

====Air Force Reserve====
Air Force Reserve training began at Luke AFB in 1960 with the activation of the 302d Air Rescue Squadron. The 302d had a distinguished heritage and lineage, being formed as the 302d Fighter Squadron, one of four African-American fighter squadrons to enter combat during World War II. It saw combat in the European Theater of Operations and Mediterranean Theater of Operations from 17 February 1944 – 20 February 1945.

For many years, the 302d operated a variety of air-rescue helicopters from the base, training for and performing search-and-rescue missions, in addition to some medical air-evacuation missions. In 1974, its mission changed to training for the combat search and rescue role, while continuing to perform some search and rescue.

The squadron&#x27;s mission changed again, in 1987, to a fighter role as the 302d Tactical Fighter Squadron, being assigned to the AFRES (now AFRC) 944th Fighter Wing. The 302d TFS was equipped with block 25/32 F-16C Fighting Falcons, carrying tail code &quot;LR&quot;. The 302d TFS trained for counterair, interdiction, and close air support missions. It deployed several times since late 1992 to Turkey to help enforce the no-fly zone over Iraq and to Italy to support UN air operations in the Balkans. The 302d FS was moved to Holloman AFB, New Mexico, and converted to F-22A Raptors on 2 October 2007.

The 69th Fighter Squadron was activated at Luke on 1 February 2010, equipped with block 42 F-16Cs, tail code &quot;LF&quot;, with the 69th FS carrying a black tail band. The 69th had formerly been assigned to Luke as an active-duty squadron from 1969–1983, flying Lockheed F-104G Starfighters training pilots from the West German Air Force.

===West German Air Force training at Luke===
From 1957 to 1965, 830 pilots from the West German air force were trained on the F-84 at Luke AFB under ATC. Since Northern European weather and operational restrictions placed severe limitations on the amount of training, Luke AFB was chosen, where flying conditions were ideal for most of the time.

On 4 April 1963, the USAF and the Federal Republic of Germany signed contracts for a unique pilot-training program. One agreement called for undergraduate pilot training for West German Air Force (GAF) and West German Navy (GN) students in Cessna T-37 Tweet and Northrop T-38 Talon jet aircraft at Williams AFB, Arizona. The second agreement provided for advanced fighter training in the Lockheed Lockheed F-104G Starfighter at Luke AFB. The two programs were interrelated. Graduates of the basic flight training at Williams were programmed for the advanced training at Luke, resulting in an almost two-year tour of duty in the United States for the young German pilots. The advanced training at Luke was the unique aspect of the program.

The host 4510th Combat Crew Training Wing at Luke was tasked with providing the advanced flying training. On 20 February 1964, the 4540th Combat Crew Training Group (CCTG) was organized and designated to conduct GAF training at Luke. The group was activated on 1 April. Prior to designating the 4540th CCTG, the 4518th Combat Crew Training Squadron was activated on 1 March 1964 and was reassigned to the 4540th CCTG upon the later&#x27;s activation. A second squadron, the 4519th Combat Crew Training Squadron, was assigned to the group, effective 1 July 1964. The German unit was named &quot;2. Deutsche Luftwaffen-Ausbildungsstaffel F-104 USA (2. DtLwAusbStff F-104 USA)&quot; (2nd German Air Force Training Squadron F-104 USA). Although remaining German property, the Starfighters carried USAF insignia and were assigned American serial numbers.

By mid-July 1964, 23 TF-104G and 12 F-104G were assigned to Luke. On 26 August 1964, 14 USAF F-104 instructor pilots graduated in the second class conducted at Luke. With a sufficient number of aircraft and instructor pilots, preparations were on target to receive the first advanced training class scheduled for October 1964. Aircraft inventories at Luke peaked in 1967 and 1968. In 1967, 100 aircraft were assigned, 62 F-104G and 38 TF-104G. The total increased to 102 in 1968, 61 F-104G models and 41 TF-104G models. Major changes occurred in organization on 1 October 1969, when the 58th Tactical Fighter Training Wing was activated, replacing the 4510th CCTW as the host unit at Luke. Concurrently, the 69th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron and the 418th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron were activated as F-104 training units, replacing the 4518th CCTS and 4519th CCTS.

By 1975, a decrease in training requirements was accompanied by a corresponding decrease in the fleet size. The two squadrons were consolidated in 1976 with the 418th TFTS inactivating on 1 October 1976. Also, a storage program was started to preserve the lifespan of the aircraft. As of 30 September 1975, some 13 aircraft were in flyable storage. Training of West German Air Force pilots in the F-104G continued until late 1982. The Germans flew more than 900 Starfighters totaling in excess of 269,750 hours and produced 1,868 F-104 pilots. The 69th TFTS inactivated on 16 March 1983.

A third F-104G squadron at Luke, the 4443d Combat Crew Training Squadron, differed from the West German squadrons in that it was associated with the Military Assistance Program (MAP) with students from NATO and other friendly nations being trained in the Starfighter. On 22 May 1964, TAC relieved the 4443d CCTS from its assignment to the 831st Air Division at George AFB, California, and reassigned it to the 4540th CCTG, effective 1 August 1964. The move consolidated all F-104 training at one location. The F-104s that were purchased with MAP funds were assigned USAF serial numbers for record-keeping purposes, although they never carried USAF insignia. On 15 June 1969, the 4443rd CCTS was inactivated.

== Role and operations ==
Luke Air Force Base is an active-duty F-16 Fighting Falcon training base with 170 F-16s assigned. The host command at Luke is the 56th Fighter Wing (56 FW), under Air Education and Training Command&#x27;s 19th Air Force.

The base population includes about 7,500 military members and 15,000 family members. With about 80,000 retired military members living in greater Phoenix, the base services a total population of more than 100,000 people.

=== F-16 Fighting Falcon operations ===
The host unit, the 56th Fighter Wing, is tasked to train F-35 and F-16 fighter pilots and maintainers. Historically, the wing graduated more than 400 F-16 pilots and 470 crew chiefs annually. The 56th FW is composed of four groups, 27 squadrons, including six training squadrons. There are several tenant units on base, including the 944th Fighter Wing, assigned to 10th Air Force and the Air Force Reserve. The 56th Fighter Wing also trains more than 700 maintenance technicians each year.

In addition to flying and maintaining the F-16, Luke airmen also deploy to support on-going operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and to combatant commanders in other locations around the world. In 2004, more than 900 Luke airmen deployed, with most supporting Operation Iraqi Freedom.

The 56th Operations Group (OG) has operational control and responsibility for the entire fighter-training mission at Luke. It has the tail code: &quot;LF&quot;. It comprises:
* 61st Fighter Squadron (&quot;Top Dogs&quot;, 1st F-35 Lightning II squadron on base, re-activated October 2013)
* 62d Fighter Squadron (&quot;Spikes&quot;, 2nd F-35 squadron on base, re-activated June 2015)
* 63d Fighter Squadron (&quot;Panthers&quot;, 3rd F-35 squadron on base, re-activated August 2016)
* 308th Fighter Squadron (&quot;Emerald Knights&quot;, 4th F-35 squadron on base, re-activated December 2018)

===Public reception===
The public has been more accommodating to the military operations at Luke Air Force base compared to other Arizona installations like the Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, according to a 2015 study. This is due to a buffer of public land around it, that helps against encroachment and land use conflicts. Also, the private sector in Glendale has been helping to maintain the buffer of public land, and with it the Arizona defense economy. This is because if encroachment impacts a site&#x27;s mission, it loses value for the military operation, and base closure is more likely to occur.

=== Barry M. Goldwater Air Force Range ===
An integral part of Luke&#x27;s F-16 fighter pilot training mission is the Barry M. Goldwater Air Force Range. The range consists of of relatively undisturbed Sonoran Desert southwest of Luke Air Force Base between Yuma and Tucson south of Interstate 8. Overhead are of airspace where pilots practice air-to-air maneuvers and engage simulated battlefield targets on the ground. Roughly the size of Connecticut, the immense size of the complex allows for simultaneous training activities on nine air-to-ground and two air-to-air ranges. The Luke Air Force Base Range Management Office manages the eastern range activities and Marine Corps Air Station Yuma oversees operations on the western portion.

=== Naval Operational Support Center (NOSC) Phoenix ===
Since June 2012, Luke AFB has been the permanent home of Naval Operational Support Center (NOSC) Phoenix of the US Navy. A NOSC is a facility used to provide operational support for training and administrative services to Navy Reserve Units. NOSC Phoenix supports over 750 Navy Reservists in sixteen Navy Reserve units. The new , one-story facility is located on a site at Luke AFB with sufficient parking and a secured perimeter to meet current anti-terrorism and force protection standards. NOSC Phoenix serves a full-time command and administrative staff, a medical unit, and reservists during drill weekends. It also has a drill hall, command staff offices, reserve unit administration spaces, medical and dental examination areas, six classrooms, a distance learning center, a physical fitness room, and a quarterdeck. The $11.2 million facility is the first LEED Platinum certified building of the US Navy Reserve Force.

<doc id="1337982" wikidata="Q6663336" url="?curid=1337982" title="Loaded (magazine)">
<text>Loaded is a men&#x27;s lifestyle magazine, now online. It launched as a mass-market print publication in 1994, stopped being issued in March 2015, and relaunched as a digital magazine in November 2015. The content was changed, with risqué material being heavily reduced. It relaunched in May 2024 as a website.

The magazine&#x27;s title was stylised entirely in lower case letters. The original version of the publication was often termed the epitome of a &quot;lad mag&quot;. The magazine was based in London. The brand was taken over by Dubai-based entrepreneur Stewart Lochrie in 2024, alongside new editor Danni Levy. 

==History==
===Development and launch===
Marketed with the tagline &quot;For men who should know better&quot;, &quot;Loaded&quot; was launched in May 1994. It was originally published by IPC Media who committed to its initial development following a discussion between the company&#x27;s executives and James Brown during a job interview for the editorship of &quot;New Musical Express&quot;, also part of the IPC group. In development for a year, &quot;Loaded&quot; was predicted to be a flop, but IPC considered it a low-risk investment because the advertising department of its Music &amp; Sport division already existed and the promotional budget was minimal. IPC itself had little faith in the magazine; according to Brown the staff were initially only contracted for 3 months after the launch. Taking its title from the Primal Scream song of the same name, the magazine was founded by Mick Bunnage, Tim Southwell and Brown.

As the magazine was part of IPC&#x27;s Music &amp; Sport division, &quot;Loaded&quot; was going to be a magazine which combined NME-style music journalism with that of football. Then, when the first issue was about to be signed off, the publication found out that it could not use a feature about Rod Stewart and so the magazine&#x27;s publisher Alan Lewis suggested that they replace Stewart with photographs of Elizabeth Hurley in her underwear, as well as adding a bit about fashion to help sell advertising space.

Speaking about &quot;Loaded&quot; audience in 2001, Brown remarked: &quot;I knew that most of the guys in the country weren&#x27;t like those other magazines, like &quot;GQ&quot; and &quot;Arena&quot;, were telling them they were. They weren&#x27;t driving around in Range Rovers with very expensive Savile Row suits.&quot; He cited the irreverent comic &quot;Viz&quot; as an inspiration for &quot;Loaded&quot;, while Holly Baxter has suggested that &quot;Playboy&quot; was an influence on the title. Brown wrote in the May 1994 launch issue: &quot;&quot;Loaded&quot; is a new magazine dedicated to life, liberty and the pursuit of sex, drink, football and less serious matters. &quot;Loaded&quot; is music, film, relationships, humour, travel, sport, hard news and popular culture. &quot;Loaded&quot; is clubbing, drinking, eating, playing and eating. &quot;Loaded&quot; is for the man who believes he can do anything, if only he wasn&#x27;t hungover&quot;.

The original editorial team also included Martin Deeson, Jon Wilde, Rowan Chernin, Pete Stanton and Derek Harbinson. The first issue, according to Brown, &quot;featured stories on Eric Cantona, Paul Weller and a travel story about a man whose &#x27;bird&#x27; was possibly eaten by a shark&quot; in addition to the photos of a Liz Hurley in her see-through lace underwear&quot; with the cover-stars on the first three issues being Gary Oldman, Leslie Nielsen and Elle Macpherson.

===1990s===
&quot;Loaded&quot; captured the lad culture of the time. Deeson remarked: &quot;I think we just caught some wave in Nineties, because the Eighties had been fairly miserable. Then we got into the Nineties and things started to loosen up a bit. ... It just seemed like a good time, and we just were part of it and caught that wave.&quot; The magazine won the prestigious PPA Magazine of the Year Award two years in succession, in 1995 and 1996.

Brown resigned from his post at &quot;Loaded&quot; in April 1997 to become editor of &quot;GQ&quot;. He was quoted as saying at the time: &quot;I won&#x27;t talk about Laddism and all that bollocks, that shows a lack of understanding of what &quot;Loaded&quot; is about. I&#x27;m not a 25-year-old loafer any more, I&#x27;m confronting new things in my life now and &quot;GQ&quot; will give me much greater scope... It is a natural step on.&quot; Staff at &quot;Loaded&quot; had mixed feelings about Brown considering him to be a bully while more widely he had acquired a reputation for heavy drinking and cocaine use.

Circulation peaked in the second half of 1998 with monthly sales of 457,318, although &quot;FHM&quot; surpassed competing titles with a 775,000 monthly circulation. At the end of 1999, with circulation in the market sector now beginning to decline, &quot;Loaded&quot; dropped what was described by Meg Carter in &quot;The Independent&quot; as its &quot;babe-only cover policy&quot;.

Launch Deputy Editor and later Editor, Tim Southwell, wrote about the early years of &quot;Loaded&quot; in &quot;Getting Away With It&quot; (Ebury Press, 1998). James Brown discussed the title at length and the impact it had on &#x27;90s culture in the documentary &quot;Live Forever: The Rise and Fall of Brit Pop&quot;.

===2000s===
&quot;Loaded&quot; had a circulation of 350,000 in 2000. The publication was edited by Martin Daubney from August 2003 to October 2010 with the sales supported by DVD girl themed covermounts and the price being reduced temporarily to £2.50. Daubney resigned when he became a father. Between 2003 and 2006, &quot;Loaded&quot; won industry awards for design and journalism, including &#x27;best designed fashion pages&#x27; at the Magazine Design Awards, for a spread of dogs photographed wearing jewellery. &quot;Loaded&quot; staff writer Jeff Maysh won five industry awards for journalism, including MJA Feature Writer of the Year, and PTC New Monthly Consumer Journalist of the year.

After the launch by IPC in 2004 of &quot;Nuts&quot;, announced as the world&#x27;s first men&#x27;s weekly, Emap quickly followed with &quot;Zoo&quot;. &quot;Loaded&quot; changed its policy of a few years earlier and increased its depiction of female nudity. Standard industry practices for news&#x27; vendors were revised in March 2006 after an agreement was reached between the National Federation of Retail Newsagents and the Home Office following concerns that lads&#x27; mags were within the reach of children. The result was that &quot;Loaded&quot; found itself displayed on the top shelf next to copies of &quot;Penthouse&quot; and other pornographic magazines.

The circulation declined: in the first six months of 2007, &quot;Loaded&quot; recorded a 35% drop in circulation compared to the first half of 2006. In February 2010, &quot;Loaded&quot; received an ABC circulation figure that was down &quot;just 2% over the period,&quot; compared with what &quot;Media Week&quot; called &quot;eye-popping falls&quot; for its competitors.

In 2007, &quot;Loaded&quot; was voted 49th in a poll organised by industry website goodmagazine.com&#x27;s for the Top 51 Magazines of All Time, for the &quot;Smartest, Prettiest, Coolest, Funniest, Most Influential, Most Necessary, Most Important, Most Essential, etc.&quot;

In the May 2008 issue of &quot;Loaded&quot;, the editorial team had to print an apology to Heinz after claiming in an earlier issue that Heinz had produced a version of alphabetti spaghetti especially for the German market that consisted solely of tiny pasta shaped swastikas.

===2010s===
IPC Media sold &quot;Loaded&quot;, along with &quot;SuperBike&quot;, to Vitality Publishing in 2010. Circulation figures had been dropping year on year by 26.3% and had declined to 53,591 at the time of the sale. In the second half of 2011, the last year for which figures were known at the time of the magazine&#x27;s eventual closure, circulation was 34,505 copies per issue, a decline of 30.2% over the same period in the previous year.

Vitality entered administration in April 2012. That month, Paul Baxendale-Walker purchased &quot;Loaded&quot; on behalf of Blue Media Publishing Group. Ian Edmondson, a former news editor at the &quot;News of the World&quot; then on bail, became editor in May replacing Andy Sherwood. &quot;Loaded&quot; owners Blue Publishing entered administration in June 2013.

&quot;Loaded&quot; was bought by independent publishing house Simian Publishing in September 2013.

===Print relaunch and closure===
&quot;Loaded&quot; relaunched for its twentieth anniversary in 2014 under editor Aaron Tinney. Tinney commissioned self-proclaimed militant feminist Julie Burchill to write a regular &#x27;agony aunt&#x27; column and Lia Nicholls as Deputy Editor, making her the first woman with an editorial role at the magazine. The relaunch also saw original &quot;Loaded&quot; writer Martin Deeson return to the magazine. In an article in &quot;The Independent&quot;, Deeson was quoted as comparing Tinney to James Brown, the original &quot;iconoclastic&quot; &quot;Loaded&quot; editor.

The Co-operative chain announced in August 2013 that it would soon only sell magazines like &quot;Loaded&quot; if they were sealed in a plastic &quot;modesty bag&quot;. Unlike some of its rivals, the magazine chose to adopt the practice. The following year, in July, &quot;Loaded&quot; dropped the photographs of partially clothed women after the lads&#x27; mag sector as a whole had faced opposition to their publication and display on covers from other supermarket chains, advertisers and feminist campaigners. When a reporter for the &quot;London Evening Standard&quot; asked if the policy on female nudity had changed, a spokesman for Simian Publishing commented: &quot;Yes — we&#x27;re going to be far more discerning and sophisticated from now on,&quot;

The magazine&#x27;s closure was announced in late March 2015, the last issue being for April of that year. This issue featured Noel Gallagher answering questions written by Irvine Welsh, but conveyed to him by Nicholls.

The &quot;Loaded&quot; style was copied many times, most obviously in a relaunch of &quot;FHM&quot;, then owned by Emap, &quot;Maxim&quot; and more niche titles like &quot;Eat Soup&quot; and &quot;Men&#x27;s Health&quot;. &quot;Loaded&quot; also influenced women&#x27;s monthlies, with Emap launching &quot;Minx&quot;, &quot;For girls with a lust for life&quot;. In the opinion of Holly Baxter, &quot;Loaded&quot; &quot;tried to incorporate interviews and features that would make the publication seem a little less seedy&quot; than &quot;Nuts&quot;, its more down market rival which closed in 2014.

=== Relaunch online ===
On 11 November 2015, &quot;Loaded&quot; relaunched online with new owners The Color Company. &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Mark Sweney wrote at the time of the online relaunch in November 2015 that &quot;Loaded&quot; had been given: &quot;a new lease of life as a digital publication dropping the scantily-clad girls of its heyday in favour of classier content&quot; intending to become a quality men&#x27;s magazine. Actor Colin Farrell was among the initial interviewees. Continuing the last version of &quot;Loaded&quot; in the final eight print issues, editor Aaron Tinney was quoted as saying, &quot;It is quality men&#x27;s magazine content online. There is a female focus, but not of the sort of Page 3 type stuff.&quot;

In May 2024, Danni Levy took over as new editor of the online magazine, and launched a 30th birthday limited edition print version featuring Elizabeth Hurley on the cover.

==&quot;Eat Soup&quot;==
&quot;Eat Soup&quot; magazine was a &quot;Loaded&quot; spin-off overseen by magazine publisher Alan Lewis (1945–2021) and editor David Lancaster at IPC and was intended as a more of a lifestyle magazine (like GQ) with articles about good food, good living, travel and luxury goods. However, even though the look and tone was in keeping with &quot;Loaded&quot;, the new bi-monthly magazine was not a success, with the publication being scrapped in 1997 after a year on sale.

== Legacy ==
In November 2024, the documentary &quot;Loaded: Lads, Mags and Mayhem&quot; aired on BBC Two, charting the rise and fall of the publication.

<text>Handsome Western States is indie rock band Beulah&#x27;s debut album, released in 1997. The sound is much less polished and elaborate than later albums. The album went out of print in 1999 but was re-pressed with new artwork in 2002. The album was never released in Europe, however. Because of this, many of the band&#x27;s European singles were pressed with songs from &quot;Handsome Western States&quot; as B-sides.

<doc id="1337996" wikidata="Q183651" url="?curid=1337996" title="Tokat">
<text>Tokat is a city of Turkey in the mid-Black Sea region of Anatolia. It is the seat of Tokat Province and Tokat District. Its population is 163,405 (2022). It is located at the confluence of the Tokat River (Tokat Suyu) with the Yeşilırmak.

== History ==

The city was established in the Hittite era. During the time of King Mithradates VI of Pontus, it was one of his many strongholds in Asia Minor.

Known as Evdokia or Eudoxia, ecclesiastically it was later incorporated into the western part of the Byzantine Greek Empire of Trebizond.

Some authors like Guillaume de Jerphanion and William Mitchell Ramsay identified Tokat with the ancient and medieval Dazimon, with Ramsay saying, &quot;Dazimon, which seems to have been a fortress, must have been the modern Tokat, with its strong castle.

Henri Grégoire, on the other hand, refuted this as implausible, because a 13th-century text written by Ibn Bibi clearly distinguishes Dazimon and Tokat as separate places. Instead, he said, Tokat should be identified with the town of Dokeia () mentioned in another 10th-century text, by Theophanes Continuatus, which says that the Byzantine general John Kourkouas was born in a village near Dokeia sometime in the 9th century. According to Grégoire, the name &quot;Dokeia&quot; does not have a Greek etymology and probably represents an old Anatolian place name. The supposed derivation from &quot;Eudokia&quot;, he claimed, is only a folk etymology that came much later.

After the Battle of Manzikert the town, like most of Asia Minor, came under the control of the Seljuk Turks. After the death of Sultan Suleiman ibn Qutulmish in 1086, the Emir Danishmend Gazi took control of the area, operating from his power base in the town of Sivas. It would be many decades before the Seljuks re-took control of that region, in the reign of Kilij Arslan II. After the Battle of Köse Dağ, Seljuk hold over the region was lost, and local Emirs such as the Eretna took power until the rise of the Ottomans, who captured the town in 1392 under Sultan Bayazid I.

== Climate ==
Tokat has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate, or alternatively a continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Csa,&quot; Trewartha: &quot;Dc&quot;). Due to the relatively high altitude and inland location, winters are fairly cold with average lows below the freezing point and significant snowfall.

Highest recorded temperature: on 30 July 2000&lt;br&gt;Lowest recorded temperature: on 20 January 1972

== Economy ==
Historically, copper was mined in the area. According to Greek researcher, Dimosthenis Oeconomidis (1858–1938):


== Culture ==
=== Education ===
Tokat Gaziosmanpaşa University is one of Turkey&#x27;s newer tertiary institutions, founded in 1992. It was named after the local hero Gazi Osman Paşa.

=== Sports ===
Football is the most popular sport: in the older districts above the city center children often kick balls around in the evenings in the smallest streets. The city&#x27;s football club is Tokatspor, which plays its games at the Tokat Gaziosmanpaşa Stadium.

Basketball, volleyball, tennis, swimming, cable skiing (in summer), horse riding, go karting, paintballing, martial arts and many other sports are played. Cycling and jogging are only common along the sea front, where recreational fishing is also popular.

===Cuisine===

Foods distinctive to Tokat include Tokat kebabı and Zile pekmezi, the latter being served in a wooden pot. &quot;Tokat kebabı&quot; consists of sliced lamb, aubergines, potatoes, green bell peppers and tomatoes. The slices are laid on their sides in rows in a dish and baked with cloves of garlic. &quot;Zile pekmezi&quot; is a grape-molasses confection, prepared from a variety of small green grapes, which are pressed (traditionally by foot but nowadays by machine) and then evaporated to a thick syrup by boiling. Egg-whites are then beaten into the syrup until it forms a pale marshmallow-like paste. It is sold commercially in tubs.

== Tourism ==

The most important landmark is Tokat Castle, an Ottoman citadel with 28 towers on a rocky hill overlooking the town. Vlad the Impaler, who may have inspired Bram Stoker&#x27;s fictional character Count Dracula, was imprisoned in one of its dungeons. Other sights include the remains of several Greek Orthodox churches and a cathedral, the Garipler Mosque dating to the 12th century, the Ali Paşa Mosque (16th century), the Hatuniye Külliyesi, also 16th century and the Gök Medrese (Pervane Bey Darussifasi), which was constructed in 1270. It was founded as a school of theology, and was converted into a museum, housing archaeological finds from the area, until that function was transferred in 2012 to another location.

The Latifoglu Konak, a late 18th-century Ottoman residence, is an example of Baroque architecture. The two-story building has been restored and has been converted into a small museum. Much of the furniture in the kitchen, study, visitors&#x27; rooms with bath and toilet, bedroom, master&#x27;s room, and harem is original.

Ballıca Cave is a small cave situated at 6 km (3.8 mi) southeast of Pazar, Tokat Province.

The abbey was dissolved in 1538; however, the town flourished, and many of the oldest existing houses in the village date from the 14th and 15th centuries, including The Seven Stars Inn in the High Street. From the village was discovered the Robertsbridge Codex (1360), a music manuscript from the 14th century. It contains the earliest surviving music written specifically for keyboard.

<doc id="1338010" wikidata="Q15062104" url="?curid=1338010" title="Operation Provide Relief">
<text>Operation Provide Relief was a United States spearheaded humanitarian relief airlift that ran from August to December 1992 in response to the famine in Somalia. This effort was assisted by the United Nations Operation in Somalia I (UNOSOM I) mission, in light of a severe food crisis initiated and exacerbated by ongoing factional fighting. However, there were significant obstructions to delivering relief aid due to the security situation. This prompted the UN to pass Resolution 794, which paved the way for the more robust, multinational Unified Task Force operation in December 1992.

==Background==
In January 1991, President of Somalia Mohammed Siad Barre, was overthrown by a coalition of rebel groups, including the United Somali Congress, Somali Salvation Democratic Front (SSDF), Somali National Movement (SNM), Somali Patriotic Movement (SPM) and Somali Democratic Movement (SDM). Many of the opposition groups began competing for influence in the ensuing power vacuum. In the south, armed factions led by USC commanders General Mohamed Farah Aidid and Ali Mahdi Mohamed, in particular, clashed as each sought to exert power over the capital Mogadishu.

In June 1991, a ceasefire was nominally agreed upon. In September 1991, the armistice was breached as fighting broke out again between Mogadishu factions. The armed confrontations continued in the following months and spread throughout the country, with over 20,000 people killed or injured by the end of the year.

These battles led to the destruction of the local agricultural sector, which in turn precipitated a food crisis in large parts of Somalia. The international community in response sent emergency rations. As a consequence, an estimated 300,000 people are believed to have died of starvation between 1991 and 1992. In July 1992, after a ceasefire between the opposing southern-based clan factions, the United Nations sent 50 military observers to supervise the food supply distributions.

==Humanitarian operation==

Operation Provide Relief began in August 1992, when the White House announced US military transports would support the multinational UN relief effort in Somalia. Ten C-130s and 400 people deployed to the Moi International Airport during Operation Provide Relief, airlifting aid to remote areas in Somalia to reduce reliance on truck convoys. 

The Air Force C-130s delivered 48,000 tons of food and medical supplies in six months to international humanitarian organizations. When this proved inadequate to stop the massive death and displacement, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 794 on 3rd December 1992, a major peacekeeping mission which authorized the use of all necessary means to assure a protected environment for conducting humanitarian operations. Concurrently, the U.S. launched Operation Restore Hope, a major coalition operation led by the United Task Force (UNITAF) to assist and protect relief activities. The US provided approximately 25,000 of the 37,000 troops provided.

After a long and protracted effort, the operation was eventually successful in saving many lives, as well as in de-escalating the high-intensity conflict into low-level, local skirmishes. However, the initiative has been criticized for expanding beyond its original boundaries (&quot;mission creep&quot;). The Washington-based Refugee Policy Group NGO in November 1994 suggests that any assessment of the success of Operation Provide Relief is &quot;so fraught with methodological problems that it is rarely attempted.&quot; As such, it asserts that excess mortality had already peaked by the time that the first relief programs in and flights to southern Somalia were set up. The think tank offers a conservative estimate that about 100,000 lives were saved as a result of international assistance, 10,000 of which occurred after U.S. troops arrived in December 1992.

<text>Ucluelet (; colloquially known as Ukee) is a district municipality on the Ucluelet Peninsula, on the west coast of Vancouver Island in British Columbia, Canada. Ucluelet comes from &quot;Yuułuʔił&quot; which means &quot;people of the safe harbour&quot; in the indigenous Nuu-chah-nulth language and is the homeland of the Yuułuʔiłʔatḥ. As of 2021, its population was 2,066, a 20.3% increase from 1,717 in 2016.

== Geography ==
Ucluelet is located at the western edge of Barkley Sound, northwest of the British Columbia provincial capital, Victoria, on the outer west coast of Vancouver Island.

The closest city is Port Alberni, which is approximately to the east. The District of Tofino is northwest of Ucluelet on Highway 4.

In between Tofino and Ucluelet is the Long Beach unit of the Pacific Rim National Park Reserve. Barkley Sound lies southeast of Ucluelet and is a marine area that features the Broken Islands Group unit of the Pacific Rim National Park Reserve. The fishing and scientific research community of Bamfield lies on its farther shore.

== History ==

Archaeological evidence indicated the presence of First Nations along the outer west coast of Vancouver Island for at least 4,300 years. British Columbia’s recorded history began with European explorers searching for the Northwest Passage.

Juan Pérez anchored and traded in 1774 on the west coast of Vancouver Island, at Nootka Sound, north of Ucluelet. In 1775, Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra sailed along the coast of Vancouver Island, heading north for Alaska. He did not stop, but roughly charted the coast in the vicinity of Kyuquot Sound. Captain James Cook of the British Navy anchored in Nootka Sound and went ashore in 1778. Maritime fur traders followed, such as Charles William Barkley, captain of the &quot;Imperial Eagle&quot;, who in 1787 arrived near Ucluelet harbour in Barkley Sound in search of sea otter pelts.

In 1870, fur sealers came to the area seeking ports for vessels working the Bering Sea sealing grounds. Captain Francis, the owner of several sealing schooners, established a trading post in Ucluelet harbour. Ucluelet began to grow along with the sealing industry and became a bustling town. In the 1890s, more settlers began arriving on the news of pending road access from Port Alberni. Fishing was excellent and gold was to be found on Florencia Bay. Gold was found, but it was so fine and in such little quantity that it could not be worked profitably.

Artist Emily Carr spent time on First Nations territories in and around Ucluelet in the late 1890&#x27;s, creating a series of drawings documenting life in the village.

The Presbyterian Church built a Mission House and school and a doctor was dispatched to the area in 1898. By 1900, more settlers had moved to the west coast of Vancouver Island. Development began bringing more infrastructure and services. The Canadian Pacific Railway operated a small freight boat sailing from Victoria three times a month. In 1903, a whaling station was established in Barkley Sound.

On December 26, 1905, while attempting to enter the Strait of Juan de Fuca in a strong southwest gale, a 2,346-ton steel-hulled four-masted barque, &quot;The Pass of Melfort&quot;, was wrecked east of Amphitrite Point. None of the 35 people aboard the vessel survived the sinking; 26 bodies were recovered and interred in a small cemetery northwest of Ucluelet. A nearby residential street, off Peninsula Road, is named after the ship. Following the disaster, the first lighthouse - a small wooden tower - was built at Amphitrite Point in 1906. This was destroyed in bad weather in 1914, and the current concrete Amphitrite Point Lighthouse opened in March 1915. A government telegraph office and a lifeboat station were also built. As World War I began, the local fishing industry had started.

When World War II began, the Government of Canada took measures to protect Vancouver Island’s west coast from potential invasions. The military established a seaplane base in Ucluelet and a land base at Long Beach. The road to Tofino, which had been worked on for thirty years, was finally completed.

In 1941, the Direction Finding capabilities at RCAF station Ucluelet (Long Beach) were placed at the disposal of the Royal Canadian Navy. In 1942, RCN operators at Ucluelet, Coal Harbour and Alliford Bay were transferred to Gordon Head in Victoria.

Ucluelet continued to prosper after the war luring more residents hoping for prosperity to the region. In August 1959, the long-awaited road to Port Alberni was finally opened.

On February 26, 1952, Ucluelet became incorporated. Its status was changed to a District in 1997 to reflect, in part, the increasing population and increasing importance within the region.

==Climate==
Ucluelet has an oceanic climate (Köppen &quot;Cfb&quot;) of the type found in Ireland, with mild, rainy winters and cool summers owing to its coastal location. As such, temperatures that are outside the range of are rare. Precipitation is high, averaging around per year, with most of it concentrated in the winter months. Even so, precipitation is significant in all months with no month averaging below of precipitation. Although it has an average snowfall of , the median is 0, meaning over 50% of years do not experience a single snowfall; this makes this climate unique in Canada.

The highest temperature ever recorded in Ucluelet was on 28 June 2021. The lowest temperature ever recorded was on 29 January 1917.
== Demographics ==

In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Ucluelet had a population of 2,066 living in 860 of its 997 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 1,717. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

Very important in local society is the presence of the Yuułuʔiłʔatḥ people (&quot;people of the safe landing place&quot; or &quot;people of the safe harbour&quot; in Nuu-chah-nulth), whose government is the Yuułuʔiłʔatḥ Government. Their government is located in Hitacu, which is located from the town of Ucluelet by road but just across the bay.

Both Ucluelet and nearby Tofino have become target sites for the construction of resorts, restaurants and adventure tourism centres. Although the local population has historically been based on fishing and logging, increasing numbers of seasonal residents pass through both communities to work in the tourism and hospitality industry.

=== Ethnicity ===
The ancestry of most residents is European (81%), Indigenous (9%), Japanese (4%), and Filipino (3%) populations.

=== Religion ===
According to the 2021 census, religious groups in Ucluelet included:
*Irreligion (1,405 persons or 70.8%)
*Christianity (415 persons or 20.9%)
*Buddhism (25 persons or 1.3%)
*Other (65 persons or 3.3%)

==Health and education==
Public education is offered by School District 70 Pacific Rim, through the Ucluelet Elementary School and Ucluelet Secondary School. Health services are provided in town by the Ucluelet Medical Clinic and larger facilities are located in Tofino and Port Alberni; all are operated by the Vancouver Island Health Authority (VIHA).

== Transportation ==

Ucluelet has an airport, Tofino Ucluelet Airport, about twenty minutes drive from town. Long Beach Airport is accessible to small passenger planes and the harbour in Ucluelet, Ucluelet Water Aerodrome, is accessible to floatplanes. Coastal fog is a common morning phenomenon in the summer, complicating access by air until the weather clears.

Accessing Ucluelet by car is via Highway 4 from Port Alberni. Vehicles are required to use winter tires or carry chains from October 1 to March 31 on this route. Tofino Bus also services Ucluelet from Victoria, Vancouver, Nanaimo and Port Alberni. In the summer, Lady Rose Marine Services operates a ferry service from Port Alberni to Ucluelet and return several times per week.

== Tourism ==

Like its neighbour Tofino, Ucluelet has made the transition from a resource-based economy to a year-round tourism-based economy. The Pacific Rim Visitor Centre is the second-most-visited Tourism Centre, after Victoria, on Vancouver Island, and on average receives 90,000 visitors from around the world to the Pacific Rim National Park, Ucluelet and Tofino area.

Tourist activities include surfing, stand-up paddle board, fishing, whale watching, bear watching, kayaking, canoeing, camping, hiking, biking, swimming, and beachcombing. Storm watching is also an activity during the November to March season.

=== Activities ===
The Wild Pacific Trail begins near the mouth of Ucluelet Inlet at Amphitrite Point Lighthouse and travels north along the open Pacific coastline through Big Beach Park to the bike path just outside Ucluelet. The final section will extend the trail to Halfmoon Bay in the Pacific Rim National Park Reserve. The trail is accessible to all ages and abilities, even wheelchairs in certain areas. No bikes, horses or motorized vehicles are permitted on the park’s beaches or trails. The hiking trails are designed to let visitors experience the shoreline while preventing damage to the fragile environment.

Various marine tours are available including sea kayaking, canoeing in the inlet, whale and wildlife watching. There has been an ongoing interest in sport fishing out of Ucluelet and there are many chartered sports fishing options in town. Surfing has become a popular activity among tourists and locals alike. In the summer months, surfers gather along Florencia Bay, Wickaninnish Beach and Long Beach in the Pacific Rim National Park Reserve.

In 2012, the catch-and-release public Ucluelet Aquarium moved into its new building on Main Street by the Ferry Ramp, displaying the local marine biodiversity with a wide variety of fish and invertebrates.

Mt. Ozzard, which hosts the Coast Guard Marine Communication and Traffic Services (MCTS) surveillance radar dome and various other communications towers, has a service road that is gated at the bottom. Despite the gate, the road to the summit is accessible to hikers and all-terrain vehicles. The MCTS centre at Amphitrite Point was closed in May 2015 and its services relocated to Prince Rupert.

== Festivals and events ==
Every March, the Pacific Rim Whale Festival is a week of events hosted by Ucluelet, Tofino and the Pacific Rim National Park Reserve. With a strong focus on marine life protection education, the event celebrates the annual return of migrating Pacific Grey Whales from their breeding and calving grounds along the Baja Peninsula of Mexico. Community events within the festival include gala dinners, children’s activities, workshops and live entertainment.

Every odd year, Ucluelet hosts a leg of the Van Isle 360. It is a point-to-point race circumnavigating Vancouver Island, sailed in 10 legs. While the participants are in Ucluelet, the community hosts a special salmon barbecue with live music and a send-off event.

In mid-June, there is the Annual Edge to Edge Marathon. Every year participants from within the community and beyond race from Tofino through the Pacific Rim National Park Reserve to Ucluelet.

The Pacific Rim Summer Festival is held in early July with two weeks of music, word and multi-cultural concerts featuring national and international performers. Nightly concerts are performed at venues in Ucluelet, Tofino and the Pacific Rim National Park Reserve.

The end of July or the last weekend are Ukee Days, a local celebration with several events such as a salmon barbecue on Friday, pancake breakfast and town parade on Saturday and a Ukee Days dance.

<text>Maladzyechna or Molodechno (, ; ; ) is a town in Minsk Region, Belarus. It serves as the administrative centre of Maladzyechna District (and formerly of Molodechno Region from 1944 to 1960). Maladzyechna is located northwest of Minsk. In 2006, it had an estimated population of 98,514 inhabitants. As of 2024, it has a population of 89,068.

Located on the Usha River, it has been a settlement since 1388 when it was part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. It was also home to the Cold War facility Maladzyechna air base.

== History==

===Early history===
The fortification on the right bank of the was first mentioned in 1388, although it is probable it was erected even before that date. Rectangular earthworks with stone walls 3,5 metres high and 11 metres wide formed the basis of the future castles and military camps formed on that location. The town itself was first mentioned the following year in a document issued by Kaributas, Prince of Severian Novgorod, who on December 16 assured his tributary fidelity to his cousin, King Władysław II Jagiełło and Jadwiga of Poland.

In 1501, the Maladzyechna was donated by King Sigismund I the Old to certain Michael of Mstsislaw, on the condition that the latter provided a safe river passage for the nobles and hunters dwelling in the area. The privilege was further confirmed on July 12, 1511.

After Michael&#x27;s heirless death, the locality passed through different hands until finally in 1567 it was acquired by Princess Nastazja Zbaraska, wife of Stafan Zbaraski, the voivode of Trakai. In 1568, that is the following year, a battle took place in the vicinity of the castle, in which the 40,000 men strong army of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth defeated the forces of Muscovy. In 1617 it was bought by Lew Sapieha, the Grand Chancellor of Lithuania. Around that time the village had 1,000 inhabitants. On August 20, 1631, Sapieha sold it to Stanisław Szemiott, the chamberlain of Samogitia, who then divided the villages surrounding Maladziečna among his sons. Following a testament conflict between the descendants of Szemiott and Aleksander Gosiewski, the Voivode of Smolensk, the town remained a property of the Gosiewski family. During their ownership of Maladziečna the fortifications were extended and strengthened significantly by addition of several bastions. Around that time Maladziečna started to be referred to as a town, even though it was officially a village and was not granted with a city charter. Nevertheless, it served as a centre of trade and commerce for the surrounding villages and also gained significant profits from transit between Lithuania and Poland. In 1708 the castle was one of the headquarters of the Swedish Army of King Charles XII of Sweden, which led to its partial devastation in the effect of a battle between the Swedes and the Russian forces.
On September 18, 1711, Bishop Bogusław Gosiewski, sold the town to the mighty Ogiński family. Among the owners of the area were Kazimierz Ogiński and Tadeusz Ogiński, the Castellan of Trakai (Lithuania). The Ogiński family became the main benefactors of the area, as they made it one of the main centres of their domain. They erected a new, classicist palace with notable frescoes, as well as a late renaissance church. It was also them to ask the king Sigismund II Augustus to grant the town with a city charter. Although it was not granted, in 1730 the monarch granted the town with the privilege of organization of two fairs a year and 2 markets every week. In mid-18th century the Ogiński&#x27;s also founded a monastery of the Trinitarians there.

Within the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Maladziečna was part of Minsk Voivodeship.

===Late modern period===
In 1793, Maladziečna was acquired by the Russian Empire as a result of the Second Partition of Poland. The palace was abandoned soon afterwards. The castle was also neglected. During the final stages of Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of Russia it was there that the Grande Armée made its last stand in former Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In early November 1812 Napoleon Bonaparte gave his last orders to his marshals there, after which he left for Vilnius. On November 21 of that year the Polish-born Russian general Yefim Chaplits arrived at the French camp there and defeated the already-routed French forces led by Marshal Victor. In the effect of the fights the town was completely demolished, as were the monastery and the castle. Because of that, in mid-19th century the town had not more than 500 inhabitants.
It was not until the later part of the century that the town started to gradually recover. In 1864 a Russian-language school was opened there and in 1871 an Orthodox church of Intercession of Our Most Holy Lady was built at the main town square. In 1873 it was linked to the world by the Minsk–Vilna railway, which sparked a period of economic recovery of the entire region. In early 20th century an additional rail line was opened, linking Saint Petersburg and Polotsk with Lida and Siedlce. This made the town a major railway junction and attracted many new settlers, in large part Jewish. By the outbreak of World War I the town had already over 2,000 inhabitants.
During the war, the town was the headquarters of the Russian 10th Army of the Western Front. Between February and December 1918 it was under German occupation, but was then seized by the Bolshevik forces during the Russian Civil War. On July 4, 1919, the town was captured by the Polish Army units led by Gen. Stanisław Szeptycki, during their advance towards Minsk. However, the town was again held by the Russian forces in the course of the Polish–Soviet War between 12 July 1920 and 12 October 1920. Following the Riga Peace Treaty it was transferred to the Second Polish Republic, but the border between Poland and the Soviet Union was only 30 kilometres to the east, which cut Mołodeczno, as the town was known in Polish, from much of its economical background.

It became a garrison town of the Polish Army, with the 86th Infantry Regiment stationed there since 1922. To counter the threat of economic decline, it became a capital of separate powiat (county) within the Wilno Voivodeship on April 1, 1927, and on April 26, 1929, the town was granted with city rights and its city limits were expanded.

===World War II===
On 17 September 1939, Maladzyechna was occupied by the Red Army and, on 14 November 1939, incorporated into the Byelorussian SSR. On 4 December 1939, Maladzyechna became a part of the newly formed Vileyka Region of the Byelorussian SSR. The NKVD expropriated the local school for teachers and set up one of its concentration camps there.
From 25 June 1941 until 5 July 1944, Maladzyechna was occupied by Nazi Germany and administered as a part of the &quot;Generalbezirk Weißruthenien&quot; of &quot;Reichskommissariat Ostland&quot;. On 13 and 18 July, the German &quot;Sonderkommando 7a&quot; and &quot;Einsatzkommando 9&quot; committed massacres of some 100 people, almost entirely Jews. In June 1942, the Jewish ghetto was liquidated with some 700 Jews massacred near the city by the &quot;Sicherheitsdienst&quot;, and then some 25–30 Jews from a local forced labour camp were massacred on 7 September 1942, and the camp was eventually dissolved in July 1943 with the remaining Jews deported to Wilejka. In addition, the German Wehrmacht has set up the infamous Stalag 342 for the Soviet prisoners of war there, in which at least 30,000 people were killed.

On 5 July 1944, the advancing Red Army recaptured Maladzyechna in the course of the Vilnius Offensive. The town resumed its status as a part of the Byelorussian SSR. The heavy damage that Vileyka suffered during the war made it unsuitable to perform the role of the administrative centre, thus Maladzyechna, which was located only 20 kilometres away from Vileyka, became the new administrative centre when the civilian control was restored in the BSSR on 20 September 1944.

===Post-war period===
Molodechno Region also survived the 1954 reform which halved the amount of regions in the BSSR, but on 20 January 1960, the Region was disestablished, and the town of Maladzyechna became part of the modern Minsk Region, in which it remains today as part of the Republic of Belarus.

<doc id="1338016" wikidata="Q16992337" url="?curid=1338016" title="Electra Woman and Dyna Girl">
<text>Electra Woman and Dyna Girl is a live action superhero children&#x27;s television series from 1976 created by Sid and Marty Krofft. The series aired 16 episodes in a single season as part of the umbrella series &quot;The Krofft Supershow&quot;. During the second season, it was dropped, along with &quot;Dr. Shrinker&quot;. When later syndicated in the package &quot;Krofft Super Stars&quot; and released on home video, the 16 segments, which were each about 12 minutes long, were combined into eight episodes.

== Premise ==
The program followed the crime-fighting exploits of caped superhero Electra Woman (played by Deidre Hall) and her teen sidekick Dyna Girl (Judy Strangis), who worked in their normal lives as reporters for &quot;Newsmaker Magazine&quot; (the two&#x27;s surnames were never revealed—just their first names: Lori and Judy, respectively). In each episode, the duo dons brightly-colored spandex costumes, in a bright flash of light called an &quot;Electra-Change&quot;; get into the &quot;ElectraCar&quot;; and use an array of technically-advanced gadgets to thwart an eclectic collection of supervillains. They were assisted by Frank Heflin (Norman Alden), a scientist who stayed at their &quot;ElectraBase&quot;, operating its highly sophisticated &quot;CrimeScope&quot; computer while keeping in continual contact with the pair through their &quot;ElectraComs&quot;.

== Characters ==

=== Main ===
* Lori / Electra Woman was played by Deidre Hall
* Judy / Dyna Girl was played by Judy Strangis
* Professor Frank Heflin was portrayed by Norman Alden
* Marvin Miller as Narrator

=== The &quot;ElectraEnemies&quot; with their henchpersons ===
* The Sorcerer and Miss Dazzle
* The Empress of Evil and Lucretia
* Ali Baba and the Genie
* Glitter Rock and Side Man
* The Spider-Lady with Leggs and Spinner
* The Pharaoh and Cleopatra

== The ElectraComs ==
The ElectraComs were bulky wrist devices worn by the title characters. They could function as two-way radios with video capabilities; they also served a variety of other specialized functions, which allowed the duo to escape various traps devised by their enemies. With the addition of special cartridge attachments, the ElectraComs were additionally seen to perform the following functions on the show:

* Direct-A-Scan – navigates the title characters through buildings to the exact location of the villain.
* Electra-Change – allows the title characters to change from their civilian clothing to the costumes of their super-powered alter-egos instantaneously.
* Electra-Beam – emits a focused kinetic beam of energy that can &quot;push&quot; or &quot;pull&quot; objects much like a tractor or pressor beam.
* Electra-Degravitate – allows the title characters to defy gravity for very short distances so that they can circumvent obstacles in their path or levitate themselves to higher ground.
* Electra-Force – apparently breaks steel bars (was not available the one time it was attempted).
* Electra-Force Shield – is essentially a force field used to detain villains once they have been caught. The shield was also used defensively as a protective barrier that can shield against physical and energy attacks.
* Electra-Freeze – lowers the temperature of the target to below freezing.
* Electra-G – increases the weight of the target.
* Electra-Split – replicates target to create a copy. Both objects are left in an unstable state and it does not work on human beings.
* Electra-Strobe – speeds the wearer&#x27;s motions, thoughts, and actions 10,000 times faster than normal.
* Electra-Vibe – creates a localized sonic field that can shatter glass or disorient an opponent who is not equipped with earplugs.
* Electra-Vision – emits a blindingly bright light, turning night into day.
* Electra-X – is a portable X-ray that reveals the target&#x27;s skeleton or identity beneath any disguise.

== Other resources ==
* The ElectraCar is a shield-shaped, three-wheeled vehicle that can also convert into the &quot;ElectraPlane&quot; with its wheels folded under/inside it. As the ElectraPlane, the ElectraCar is capable of flying into low Earth orbit. It also has a Tracking Beam for pursuing villains.
* The ElectraBase, located beneath the duo&#x27;s civilian home and accessible by a hidden elevator, not only houses Frank Heflin&#x27;s lab and the ElectraCar, but also serves as the home to &quot;CrimeScope&quot;, one of the most powerful computers ever built – much like the BatComputer, which it parodies. CrimeScope is always kept up-to-date with what is going on in the world, can analyze any data transmitted through the ElectraComs, and can also operate the ElectraCar via remote control.

== Episodes ==
== Other adaptations ==
=== Unaired WB television pilot ===

The WB Television Network commissioned a pilot for a new version of the show in 2001 starring Markie Post as Electra Woman and Anne Stedman as Dyna Girl. The new series was written in the form of a cynical parody of the original show – and the superhero genre in general. It was set 25 years after the original series, with a retired Electra Woman brought back into action by a fan who ends up becoming the new Dyna Girl.

The pilot portrayed Electra Woman as a disillusioned, bitter, sexually promiscuous, chain smoking alcoholic, much in contrast to the character&#x27;s original portrayal. In the pilot, Electra Woman had been married and divorced since the end of the original series, her husband having left her for the original Dyna Girl, taking her bank account and car and leaving her as trailer trash. Although the pilot was shot, the series was not picked up.

The pilot omits the character of Frank Heflin, but includes an in-joke reference to Norman Alden, who had portrayed him in the original. The university&#x27;s alumni function is attended by Aquaman, whose character voice Alden had provided on the &quot;Super Friends&quot; animated series.

=== Web series ===
YouTube personalities Grace Helbig and Hannah Hart starred in a reboot of the original series. The show, produced by Tim Carter and Tomas Harlan through their Contradiction shingle, was directed by Chris Marrs Piliero and shot in Vancouver, B.C. during February and March 2015.

&quot;Electra Woman and Dyna Girl&quot; was digitally released by Fullscreen through its streaming platform as a series of eight 11-minute webisodes in April 2016. It was released on all major platforms on June 7, by Legendary Digital Studios and Sony Pictures Home Entertainment. A DVD version was released in late July through Sony Pictures Home Entertainment.

=== Parody ===
In 1992, comic-book writer Bryan J. L. Glass and artist Michael Avon Oeming created Lycra Woman and Spandex Girl, an &quot;Aerobic Duo&quot; of super-heroines parodying Electra Woman and Dyna Girl. After the DuPont chemical company successfully sued the creators for unauthorized use of its Lycra trademark, copies of all issues using the name were destroyed and the lead character&#x27;s name was changed to Flex Woman. The pair appeared in several limited series and one-shot specials, most recently in 1997.

<text>&quot;His Last Bow. The War Service of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, later titled &quot;His Last Bow: An Epilogue of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, is one of 56 short stories about Sherlock Holmes written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. It was first published in September 1917 in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; and collected as the last of an anthology of eight stories titled &quot;His Last Bow: Some Reminiscences of Sherlock Holmes&quot; the following month. The narration is in the third person, instead of the first person narration usually provided by the character of Dr. Watson, and it is a spy story, rather than a detective mystery. Due to its portrayal of British and German spies on the eve of war, its publication during the First World War, and its patriotic themes, the story has been interpreted as a propaganda tool intended to boost morale for British readers.

==Plot==

On the eve of the First World War, the German agent Von Bork is getting ready to leave England with his vast collection of intelligence, gathered over a four-year period. His wife and household have already left Harwich for Flushing in the Netherlands, leaving only him and his elderly English housekeeper. Von Bork&#x27;s associate, Baron von Herling, a German diplomat from the Embassy of Germany, is impressed by his acquisition of vital British military secrets, and tells Von Bork that he will be received in Berlin as a hero. Von Bork says that he is waiting for one last transaction with his Irish-American informant, Altamont, who will arrive shortly with a rich treasure: naval signals.

Von Herling leaves just before Altamont arrives. Von Bork&#x27;s housekeeper has turned her light off and retired. Altamont shows Von Bork a package. Altamont disparages Von Bork&#x27;s safe, but Von Bork proudly says that its construction and the double combination lock make it impenetrable. He tells Altamont that the combination is &quot;August 1914&quot;. Altamont, mentioning cases in which several German informants have ended up in prison, is distrustful of Von Bork and refuses to deliver the naval codes until he receives payment. Von Bork refuses to pay until he has examined Altamont&#x27;s intelligence data.

Altamont hands him the package. Von Bork finds that it is a book titled &quot;Practical Handbook of Bee Culture&quot;, hardly what he expected. Even less expected is the chloroform-soaked rag that is held in his face by Altamont a moment later. Altamont is actually Sherlock Holmes in disguise, and the chauffeur who brought him is Dr. Watson. Now past their heyday, they have nonetheless caught several spies (Holmes is actually responsible for the imprisoned agents of whom &quot;Altamont&quot; spoke), and fed the Germans some thoroughly untrustworthy intelligence. Holmes had retired from detective work, spending his days beekeeping in the countryside, but returned after the Foreign Minister and the Premier came to him. Holmes has been on this case for two years, and it has taken him to Chicago, Buffalo, and Ireland, where he learnt to play the part of a bitter Irish-American, even gaining the credentials of a member of a secret society. He identified the security leak through which British secrets were reaching the Germans, and then set out to apprehend the receiving agents themselves. The housekeeper was one of Holmes&#x27; agents: the light that she switched off was the signal to Holmes and Watson that the coast was clear.

Holmes and Watson take Von Bork and the evidence to Scotland Yard. In reference to the impending War, Holmes says, &quot;There&#x27;s an east wind coming, Watson.&quot; Watson misinterprets the meaning of the words and says, &quot;I think not, Holmes. It is very warm&quot;, to which Holmes replies:

==Publication history==
&quot;His Last Bow&quot; was first published in the UK in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in September 1917, and in the US in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; in the same month. The story was published with three illustrations by Alfred Gilbert (best known as sculptor of the Shaftesbury Memorial Fountain) in the &quot;Strand&quot;, and with five illustrations by Frederic Dorr Steele in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;. It was included in the short story collection &quot;His Last Bow&quot;, which was published in the UK and the US in October 1917.

==Legacy==
The story is the last chronological installment of the series. &quot;The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, set before the story, was published later.

Holmes&#x27; patriotic passage has been widely quoted, and was later used in the final scene of the Basil Rathbone film &quot;Sherlock Holmes and the Voice of Terror&quot; (1942), loosely based on &quot;His Last Bow&quot;, though set during World War II.

The events leading up to and beyond this story were described in &quot;Sherlock Holmes and the Railway Maniac&quot; (1994, ), by Barrie Roberts. The end of Nicholas Meyer&#x27;s 1993 novel &quot;The Canary Trainer&quot; ties into &quot;His Last Bow&quot;, with Edward Grey and H. H. Asquith approaching Holmes to request he come out of retirement to investigate a man named Von Bork. &quot;Ten Years Beyond Baker Street&quot; by Cay Van Ash is set during Holmes&#x27;s undercover search for Von Bork; it tells how he divides his time between his counter-espionage task and a search for Sir Denis Nayland Smith, believed to have been kidnapped by Fu Manchu; thus, Van Ash combines the worlds created by Conan Doyle and Sax Rohmer.

The story is continued in Robert Ryan&#x27;s 2015 novel &quot;A Study in Murder&quot;, the third in his &quot;Dr Watson&quot; detective series, in which Von Bork torments Dr Watson, now a prisoner of war in Germany, and arranges for him to be exchanged for Sherlock Holmes so that he can exact his revenge.

Peter Brown wrote &quot;Anyone having any knowledge or experience of actual intelligence work could not help a gasp of horror at what Sherlock Holmes is doing in &#x27;His Last Bow&#x27;. Having by patient hard work established his credentials with the Germans and being in a perfect position to go on feeding them false information for the rest of the war, Holmes for no reason whatsoever blows his own cover and destroys everything. Why, for God&#x27;s sake? Why? How I wish I could reach into that room and shout at Holmes: &#x27;Stop! What are you doing? Are you crazy?&#x27;. Alas, this story with its monumental blunder must remain forever as it is. Conan Doyle had a wide knowledge of many subjects - evidently, intelligence work was not one of them. There were in 1916 England some people he could have profitably consulted on the subject.&quot;

==Adaptations==

===Film and television===

<text>The New Georgia campaign was a series of land and naval battles of the Pacific Theater of World War II between Allied forces and the Empire of Japan. It was part of Operation Cartwheel, the Allied strategy in the South Pacific to isolate the Japanese base around Rabaul. The campaign took place in the New Georgia Islands in the central Solomon Islands and followed the Allied capture of the Russell Islands. The main fighting took place on New Georgia itself, although significant actions also took place around the island chain throughout the campaign.

The campaign began on 30 June 1943, when US troops carried out landings in the Kula Gulf, in the north of New Georgia, and around the Munda area on the western coast. In addition, smaller landings were undertaken at Viru Harbor on the southern coast of the island, Wickham Anchorage on Vangunu, and on Rendova. In the north, several actions were fought around Enogai and Bairoko throughout July, while in the west, the main US objective was the Japanese airfield on Munda Point. Stubborn defense by the Japanese delayed the US advance on Munda and the Japanese mounted a strong counterattack before US force eventually captured Munda Point in early August.

Elsewhere, further actions took place on Arundel Island in August and September after Japanese forces withdrew there after the fighting around Munda Point. A large number of Japanese troops concentrated on Kolombangara late in the campaign but were bypassed by US troops who landed on Vella Lavella in mid-August and were later reinforced by New Zealand troops. The campaign ended on 7 October 1943 when the last Japanese troops were withdrawn from Vella Lavella, finalizing the Allied capture of the islands.

A series of naval actions also took place in conjunction with the fighting on land, including actions in the Kula Gulf, off Kolombangara, in the Vella Gulf, off Horaniu and off Vella Lavella.

==Background==

The Japanese had captured New Georgia in 1942 and built an airbase at Munda Point which began operations in December 1942 to support the Guadalcanal offensives. As it became clear at the end of 1942 that they could not hold Guadalcanal, the Japanese commanders guessed that the Allies would move toward the Japanese base at Rabaul on New Britain, and that the central Solomon Islands were logical steps on the way.

The Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) believed that holding the Solomon Islands would be ultimately unsuccessful and that it would be better to wait for an Allied attack on Bougainville which would be much less costly to supply and reinforce. The Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) preferred to delay the Allied advance for as long as possible by maintaining a distant line of defense. With no effective central command, the two Japanese services implemented their own plans: the navy assumed responsibility for the defense of the central Solomons and the army for the northern Solomons.

In early 1943, Japanese defenses were prepared against possible Allied landings on New Georgia, Kolombangara and Santa Isabel. By June 1943, there were 10,500 troops on New Georgia and 9,000 on Kolombangara, all under the command of General Minoru (Noboru) Sasaki, well dug in and waiting for an Allied attack.

==Allied planning==

===Choice of New Georgia===
By early 1943, some Allied leaders had wanted to focus on capturing Rabaul, but Japanese strength there and lack of landing craft meant that such an operation was not practical in 1943. Instead, on the initiative of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff and the South West Pacific Area&#x27;s staff, including General Douglas MacArthur, a plan known as Operation Cartwheel was developed, which proposed to envelop and cut off Rabaul without capturing it, by simultaneous offensives in the Territory of New Guinea and northward through the Solomon Islands.

The Allied base at Guadalcanal continued to suffer from Japanese bombing raids even after the island was declared secured on 9 February 1943. The Japanese airfield at Munda made these raids easier by giving Japanese planes a convenient place to refuel on the way to and from their main base at Rabaul. The Allies attempted to neutralize Munda with repeated bombing raids and naval shelling, but the Japanese were always able to repair the airfield in short order. The Allied command thus determined that Munda had to be captured by ground troops. Since the New Georgia Islands lay within the South West Pacific Area, which was any area of the Solomon Islands west of longitude 159° east, the operation would be the responsibility of MacArthur and would be conducted by Admiral William F. Halsey&#x27;s forces. Halsey&#x27;s operations east of longitude 159° east reported to Admiral Chester Nimitz. US forces committed to capturing Munda totaled 32,000 Army personnel and 1,700 Marines. Forces allocated to capturing Vella Lavella totaled 9,588, of which 5,888 were US servicemen and 3,700 were New Zealanders.

===Capture of the Russells===

The Russell Islands, lying between Guadalcanal and the New Georgia Islands, had served as a troop staging base for the Japanese during the fight for Guadalcanal, and Halsey determined to capture it in preparation for the main action in the New Georgias. In early February, he instructed Rear Admiral Richmond K. Turner, Commander Amphibious Force, to undertake Operation Cleanslate.

Beginning 21 February, Turner landed the US Army 43rd Infantry Division under Major General John H. Hester and the 3rd Marine Raider Battalion under Lieutenant Colonel Harry B. Liversedge on the Russell Islands, a total of approximately 9,000 troops and their equipment. These landings were unopposed because, unbeknownst to the Allies, the Japanese had evacuated the Russells soon after leaving Guadalcanal. In fact, the men landing on nearby Banika Island were greeted by two coastwatchers with the offer of a cup of tea.

===Preliminaries to the New Georgia landings===

Alarmed that the Allies were working their way up the Solomons chain, the Japanese bombed the new American base in the Russells and began strengthening their own airfields at Munda and at nearby Vila on Kolombangara. In turn, the Americans attempted to subdue Munda field with naval gunfire with limited success. During the course of one of these overnight bombardment sorties, on the night of 6–7 March 1943, an American force consisting of three light cruisers and three destroyers under the command of Rear Admiral A. Stanton Merrill encountered two Japanese destroyers as they were returning to the Kula Gulf from delivering food and supplies to the garrison at Vila. In the ensuing action, known as the Battle of Blackett Strait, both Japanese destroyers were sunk.

The Americans next attempted to interdict the Japanese supply lanes by mining the ocean approaches to Vila and Munda. This proved as ineffective as bombardment had been, since the Japanese were able to sweep up the mines readily.

The Allies had plenty of time to plan Operation Toenails, as the invasion of the New Georgias was called. The plan called for simultaneous landings on 30 June at four places. From southeast to northwest, these were: (1) Wickham Anchorage on the southeast coast of Vangunu; (2) Segi Point on the southeastern tip of New Georgia; (3) Viru Harbor on the southwest coast of New Georgia, just a few miles up from Segi; and (4) Rendova Harbor on Rendova Island just across Blanche Channel from Munda, placing the Japanese base well within range of land-based artillery.

During the entire New Georgia campaign, the resolution and resourcefulness of the British Commonwealth coastwatchers proved invaluable to the Allied cause. District Officer Donald Gilbert Kennedy, a New Zealander, set the tone in a message he delivered to every native village when occupation by the Japanese was imminent: &quot;These islands are British and they are to remain British. The government is not leaving. Even if the Japanese come, we shall stay with you and in the end they will be driven out.&quot; In the event, it was the prospect of Kennedy being killed or captured that led Turner to move up the first Allied landings by nine days. He sent two companies of the 4th Marine Raider Battalion to capture Segi Point on the morning of 21 June, where Kennedy and his native comrades were rescued.

==Conquest of New Georgia island==
===Initial landings: 30 June – 2 July===

A force consisting of portions of the 4th Marine Raider Battalion and the 103rd Infantry Regiment landed at Oloana Bay on the south coast of Vangunu Island on 30 June. From there they marched overland to Vura village which overlooked Wickham Anchorage, the first of the objectives of the original Allied plan. By 12 July, Vura was secured and garrisoned. Meanwhile, the remainder of the 4th Marine Raider Battalion captured Viru Harbor, supported by dive bombers, on 30 June, after advancing overland from Lambeti Plantation. They had moved to the plantation by boat on 27 June from Segi Point, having been dispatched there on 21 June during a preliminary operation. Another company from the 103rd Infantry Regiment relieved the Marines in the harbor on 4 July, having landed at Segi Point on 30 June when the Marines&#x27; advance had been delayed.

The landings in the Munda area were the most important of the four; the initial phase of this part of the operation was the capture of Rendova, commanded by Admiral Turner. A total of 6,000 soldiers, sailors and marines of the US Army&#x27;s 172nd Infantry Regiment, the 9th Marine Defense Battalion, and the Navy&#x27;s 24th NCB landed at Rendova Harbor early on 30 June while Companies A and B of the 169th Infantry Regiment along with the New Zealand-trained and led commando unit of 130 South Pacific islanders took three strategic islets in the Blanche Channel opposite Munda. Rendova, Wickham Anchorage and Viru Harbor were developed into staging areas for the main event, the siege of Munda, while Segi Point was developed into an airfield. The small Japanese garrison on Rendova was quickly overwhelmed but the island was subjected to heavy attack by Japanese aircraft over the following days. The Marines on Rendova quickly built artillery emplacements from which they could shell Munda airfield and support the operations during July and August to capture of Munda airfield.

On 2 July, the Americans were ready to make a landing in the Munda area on the New Georgia mainland. Laiana beach was closest, being only from Munda, but as it was heavily defended, it was rejected in favor of Zanana beach, more than farther east. Zanana would prove to be an unfortunate choice from an Allied perspective. The crossing was undertaken in daylight by elements from two regiments in the afternoon of 2 July; a small perimeter was established around Zanana and defenses built up before the advance westwards towards Munda Point began several days later.

===Landings in Kula Gulf===
Vice Admiral Jinichi Kusaka and Lieutenant General Hitoshi Imamura had no intention of allowing New Georgia to fall the way Guadalcanal had. They loaded 4,000 troops on destroyers, brought them down &quot;The Slot&quot; on the night of 4–5 July via the &quot;Tokyo Express,&quot; and landed them at Vila on the southeast coast of Kolombangara. From there, the men would be ferried across Kula Gulf on barges to Bairoko on the northwest coast of New Georgia, before moving along eight-mile jungle trail to Munda.

The Allies also carried out an amphibious operation in Kula Gulf that night. Halsey had dispatched transports carrying 4,600 troops consisting of Marine Raiders and two US Army battalions under Colonel Liversedge to Rice Anchorage on the northwest coast of New Georgia. A force of three light cruisers and four destroyers commanded by Rear Admiral Walden L. Ainsworth covered the troopships. One of Ainsworth&#x27;s destroyers was torpedoed and sunk by the Japanese as the latter were retiring up the gulf from their reinforcement mission to Vila.

Liversedge&#x27;s men were tasked with moving down the coast and capturing Bairoko, thereby interdicting the trailhead used by the Japanese to reinforce Munda. They were successfully landed at dawn but found the terrain difficult and advanced slowly inland over the course of several days.

The night (5–6 July) after the Kula Gulf landings, the opposing naval forces engaged in a full-scale battle in the waters northeast of Kolombangara, an action that came to be called the Battle of Kula Gulf. The Americans lost a light cruiser while the Japanese lost two destroyers. In the north, after advancing from Rice Anchorage, US forces occupied Triri on 7–8 July. A 400-strong Japanese force launched a counterattack on 8 July against Triri, which initially made some gains before it was checked by a flanking move. Following this, US troops captured Enogai at the mouth of the inlet on 10–11 July, before moving to establish a block along the Munda–Bairoko trail.

===Advance from Zanana and capture of Munda===
The US advance from Zanana to Munda was completely stymied, hampered by difficult terrain, supply problems and low morale. General Hester tried to break the stalemate by sending the 172nd Infantry Regiment around to the north to take the Japanese position in the rear, while the 169th Infantry Regiment continued the frontal assault, but this effort was checked by Sasaki. As a result, the US advance on New Georgia stalled in both the north and the south. The Japanese brought reinforcements by barge from Vila to Bairoko, and 1,200 more troops were loaded onto four destroyer-transports at Rabaul and sent down to be landed at Vila on the night of 12–13 July. These ships were escorted by a light cruiser and five destroyers. Ainsworth was sent to intercept this flotilla with three light cruisers and ten destroyers. He encountered the Japanese force in The Slot in the waters north of Kolombangara, and in the ensuing Battle of Kolombangara one US destroyer and one Japanese light cruiser were sunk.

Major General Oscar W. Griswold, commander XIV Corps and General Hester&#x27;s immediate superior, visited New Georgia in mid-July and assessed the situation as dire. He radioed Halsey at Nouméa that at least another division was needed to break the stalemate. Lieutenant General Millard F. Harmon of the United States Army Air Forces was sent to confirm the situation. After an investigation, Harmon gave field command to Griswold so that Hester could concentrate on leading his own division. At the same time, a long-anticipated change in naval command took place with Rear Admiral Theodore Stark Wilkinson taking over leadership of the amphibious forces from Turner on 15 July.

Sasaki initially took advantage of the disorder on the American side. The Japanese learned to apply close assault tactics against American tanks, rendering armor even less effective in the jungle than usual. Meanwhile, the inexperienced, hungry and fatigued US soldiers&#x27; nerves began to fray, and they began to lose their fire discipline. On the night of 17 July, the Japanese launched a strong counterattack and succeeded in overrunning the command post of the 43rd Division near Zanana. Eventually, however, Sasaki&#x27;s troops became sick and exhausted; also, he had lost communications with Rabaul. US forces, bolstered by the arrival of the 37th Infantry Division, subsequently launched a corps-level offensive under Griswold aimed at capturing Munda Point. Sasaki ordered a retreat from the Munda area on 3 August. Griswold had his men sweep around Munda to the northwest and on 5 August plastered the remaining Japanese with artillery fire. That day, the Americans moved unopposed into Munda, finally achieving the campaign&#x27;s most important goal.

===Capture of Bairoko===
On the northern front, Liversedge&#x27;s Marines consolidated their position around Enogai after 12 July and began patrolling the local area while US Army troops occupied the blocking position. This was subsequently abandoned on 17 July, and the soldiers returned to Triri. He had been reinforced by 700 Marines from the 4th Raider Battalion and made plans to capture Bairoko village, on the eastern side of Bairoko Harbor, on 20 July. His Army detachment was to attack the village from the southeast while his Marines converged from the northeast, a classic pincer movement. But the Japanese defensive positions were well designed and had been reinforced since the initial US landing at the Rice Anchorage; as a result, neither force made any progress, and US casualties began to mount. Just before dawn on 22 July, Liversedge called for air strikes to cover his withdrawal. With a view to compensating for failures in land-based air cover following previous such requests, what followed was the heaviest aerial bombardment of the campaign so far.

Beginning 3 August, Liversedge tried again, first establishing a battalion of the 148th Infantry Regiment at a blocking position on the Munda trail. Two days later he relieved these men with a combined Army/Marine force and moved the 148th to a dominant position overlooking the entire area. On 10 August, Liversedge picked up another US battalion and renewed the direct attack on Bairoko. At the same time, two regiments from the 25th Infantry Division, sent to New Georgia as reinforcements, advanced on Bairoko from Munda Point mopping up after the capture of Munda airfield. After two more grueling weeks, the Americans entered Bairoko unopposed on 24 August.

===Securing New Georgia===
Kusaka and Imamura at Rabaul made a final, disastrous attempt to reinforce Sasaki. Under the protection of a single destroyer, 940 troops and 700 naval personnel were loaded aboard three destroyer-transports and sent down under the command of Rear Admiral Kaju Sugiura to Kolombangara on the night of 6–7 August. Wilkinson, anticipating such a movement that night, sent a force of six destroyers under Commander Frederick Moosbrugger to intercept them. In the resulting Battle of Vella Gulf, fought in the waters northwest of Kolombangara, the American destroyers took the Japanese completely by surprise. The three ships carrying passengers were torpedoed and sunk, and the remaining escort ship did not linger to search for survivors.

Following this major reversal, Sasaki moved his headquarters to Kolombangara on 8–9 August, leaving behind a token force to defend the west coast of New Georgia. His mission now was simply to hold the remaining islands of the New Georgia group as long as possible, giving the Japanese a chance to reinforce the northern Solomons. US Army forces moved along the west coast of New Georgia, wiping out the 200 Japanese remaining in the Zieta area. Elements of the 169th and 172nd Infantry Regiments captured Baanga islet on 20–21 August, silencing the Japanese artillery that had been shelling Munda. Despite the proximity of US patrols, the last Japanese troops on New Georgia were moved by barge from Bairoko Harbor over to Kolombangara on the night of 23 August. This marked the end of ground combat on New Georgia.

==Outlying islands==

===Arundel===
Sasaki played his delaying role to the hilt. When the US 172nd Infantry Regiment landed on Arundel Island, just west of New Georgia, on 27 August, he allowed them to come ashore unopposed and establish a beachhead. Just as the Americans were feeling the occupation would be easy, Sasaki counterattacked in multiple places, tying the Americans down and forcing them to call for reinforcements. He carried out a particularly determined attack on 15 September, bringing the whole Allied effort on Arundel to a halt, and with far fewer troops than his opponents. Griswold ordered a full-scale effort, including Marine Corps tanks, to drive the Japanese off the island. After vicious fighting on 17 and 18 September, the Japanese abandoned Arundel for good on the night of 20–21 September.

=== Vella Lavella===
Halsey had earlier seen the wisdom of bypassing the heavily fortified island of Kolombangara and invading Vella Lavella instead, since Vella Lavella lay closer to Bougainville and Rabaul and was less well defended. Thus, a month before New Georgia was secured by the Allies, they landed a reconnaissance party on Vella Lavella to gain information about Japanese strength and dispositions as well as about suitable landing sites, before returning to Guadalcanal on 31 July. The village of Barakoma near the island&#x27;s southeastern tip was selected as the landing place. A large invasion force of about 6,500 troops led by Major General Robert B. McClure, escorted by 12 destroyers under the command of Wilkinson was dispatched from Guadalcanal early on 14 August. That night, Japanese planes attacked multiple Allied bases but completely missed this fleet headed for Vella Lavella. The next morning, disembarkation began at Barakoma.

The Japanese high command in Tokyo had already decided that no more troops would be wasted in the central Solomons. Rather than reinforce and defend Vella Lavella, it was to be used merely as a way station for the evacuation of the troops on Kolombangara that had been bypassed by the Allies with this new landing. Horaniu, on the northeast coast, was selected as a barge staging point and on the night of 17–18 August a small force of ground and naval troops was sent to secure the area. The Japanese destroyer covering force was met in The Slot by four US destroyers under Captain Thomas J. Ryan and subsequently fought an inconclusive action off Horaniu. No ships of either side were lost, and the Japanese succeeded in establishing a barge base.

Meanwhile, throughout August, the Allies pushed the remaining Japanese ground forces on Vella Lavella into a pocket in the northwest corner of the island. The 3rd New Zealand Division, under the command of Major General Harold E. Barrowclough, was tasked with destroying this pocket. The New Zealanders began their pincer movement on 21 September, but the Japanese resisted so fiercely that it took until 5–6 October to bottle them up. On the night of 6–7 October, Rear Admiral Ijuin Matsuji led a naval force to take the 600 remaining ground troops off Vella Lavella. In response, a force of US destroyers was dispatched to intercept them. Each side lost a ship in the ensuing ensuing naval battle, but the Japanese were able to successfully complete their evacuation. As a result, Barrowclough&#x27;s men entered the evacuated area unopposed, concluding the New Georgia campaign.

===Kolombangara===
Kolombangara was evacuated by the Japanese between 28 September and 4 October after the U.S. forces completely ignored and bypassed it. The Japanese had stationed a large number of troops on the island and had heavily fortified it in expectation of mounting a stubborn defense, but MacArthur and Halsey&#x27;s strategic plan was to only take lightly guarded beaches and islands and simply ignore the heavily defended islands.
==Aftermath==
Casualties during the campaign amounted to 1,195 US servicemen killed and 93 aircraft destroyed, while the Japanese lost 1,671 killed, and 358 aircraft destroyed. In addition, a total of 3,873 US troops were wounded. Casualties from disease were numerous, as were psychological casualties, with over 2,500 troops being diagnosed with &quot;war neurosis&quot; between 30 June and 30 September. The next stage of the Allied advance through the Solomons saw them land at Cape Torokina as part of efforts to secure Bougainville beginning in November; this campaign would last until the end of the war with Australian troops relieving US troops in late 1944. This was preceded by diversionary actions in the Treasury Islands by elements of the New Zealand 3rd Division and by US Marines on Choiseul. Elsewhere, in New Guinea, commencing in late September, the Allies launched campaigns in the Markham Valley and on the Huon Peninsula as part of efforts to secure Lae and Finschhafen. In analyzing the campaign, historian Samuel Eliot Morison describes it as &quot;the most unintelligently waged land campaign of the Pacific war (with the possible exception of Okinawa)&quot;, and highlighted the decision to land at Zanana during operations to secure Munda as a mistake, suggesting that Laiana should have been chosen instead. Morison further criticizes the failed flanking move undertaken by Hester&#x27;s troops to break the deadlock during the initial drive on Munda, describing it as &quot;perhaps the worst blunder in the [campaign]&quot;.

<text>Andrzej Michał Wawrzyniak (3 December 1931 – 8 November 2020) was a Polish sailor, diplomat, connoisseur and collector of Oriental art, and founder, lifetime director, and chief curator of the Asia and Pacific Museum in Warsaw.

In Indonesia, a country with which he had very close professional and emotional ties, he was known as “Andrzej &#x27;Nusantara&#x27; Wawrzyniak”.

==Life==
Andrzej Wawrzyniak was born on 3 December 1931 in Warsaw. At the age of sixteen he boarded the full-rigged school ship “Dar Pomorza”, then sailed on twelve ships, moving up from being a deck boy to the rank of officer of the Polish Merchant Marine. In the meantime he graduated from the Diplomatic and Consular Faculty of the Foreign Service School in Warsaw, then studied at the Maritime Faculty of the Economic School in Sopot, and at the Social Sciences School in Warsaw (postgraduate and doctoral studies). In 1956 he joined the Polish diplomatic service, to be promoted in 1973 to the rank of the Minister Plenipotentiary.
* From 1956–1960 Andrzej Wawrzyniak was chief of the department of the Polish Delegation to the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Vietnam.
* From 1961–1965 – he was a cultural attaché to – and from 1967 to 1971 deputy head of mission and chargé d&#x27;affaires at the Embassy of Poland in Indonesia.
* From 1973–1974 – he was head of the Polish Delegation to the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos.
* From 1977–1981 – he was head of the Polish Embassy in Nepal. He was also the UN international observer of the elections in Namibia (1989).
* From 1990–1993 - he was a head of the Polish Embassy in Afghanistan, later a head of the Field Office of the OSCE Mission to Bosnia and Herzegovina (1996) and UN observer in East Timor (1999).
* Andrzej Wawrzyniak had also been the Honorary Consul General of Sri Lanka in Poland (1997–2003).

Altogether he spent more than a quarter of a century in Asia amassing a significant collection of ethnographical and artistic objects from various countries.

==Indonesian art collection==
The largest impact on his life was his diplomatic assignment to Indonesia lasting nearly 9 years during the 1960s. After his return to Poland, he donated his collection, numbering over 3,000 objects, to the Polish State. Prof. Stanisław Lorentz described Andrzej Wawrzyniak&#x27;s Indonesian collection as “one of the largest private Indonesian collections, exceeding even the Dutch collections which are considered to be the biggest in the world”. On that basis the Nusantara Archipelago Museum was founded in Warsaw in 1973.

Because of its development and continuous enrichments with objects from other regions, in 1976 the Nusantara Archipelago Museum had been transformed and began a new span of life as the Asia and Pacific Museum in Warsaw. Andrzej Wawrzyniak was assigned as its director and curator-in-chief for his lifetime. Today the museum holds a collection of over 20,000 objects from Asia, Australia and Oceania.

==Honours and awards==

<text>John Bernard Larroquette (; born November 25, 1947) is an American actor. He is known for his starring roles in the NBC military drama series &quot;Baa Baa Black Sheep&quot; (1976–1978), the NBC sitcom &quot;Night Court&quot; (1984–1992; 2023–present) for which he received four consecutive Primetime Emmy Awards wins for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series during the earlier incarnation, the NBC sitcom &quot;The John Larroquette Show&quot; (1993–1996), the David E. Kelley legal drama series &quot;The Practice&quot; (1997–2002), the ABC legal comedy-drama series &quot;Boston Legal&quot; (2004–2008), and the TNT series &quot;The Librarians&quot; (2014–2018).

In 2011, he made his Broadway debut in the musical revival of Frank Loesser&#x27;s &quot;How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying&quot; alongside Daniel Radcliffe. He played J. B. Bigley in a role for which he received a Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Musical, and a Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Featured Actor in a Musical. The following year he starred as William Russell in the Broadway revival of Gore Vidal&#x27;s &quot;The Best Man&quot; (2012) directed by Mike Nichols starring James Earl Jones, Candice Bergen, and Angela Lansbury.

He made his film debut by providing the opening narration of the horror film &quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot; (1974), following which he appeared in films such as &quot;Stripes&quot; (1981), &quot;Choose Me&quot; (1984), &quot;Blind Date&quot; (1987), &quot;Madhouse&quot; (1990), &quot;Richie Rich&quot; (1994), and the Hallmark Channel mystery series &quot;McBride&quot; (2005–2008).

==Early life==
Larroquette was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, on November 25, 1947, the son of Berthalla Oramous, a department store clerk, and John Edgar Larroquette Jr., who was in the United States Navy. His paternal grandfather, John Larroquette Sr., was born in France and emigrated to the United States in 1895.

Larroquette grew up in the Ninth Ward of New Orleans, near the French Quarter. He played clarinet and saxophone through childhood and into high school. He attended Holy Cross School through his sophomore year before involuntarily moving to Francis T. Nicholls High School to finish his secondary education. It was his senior year at Nicholls High School that he first discovered acting. He was offered a scholarship to Louisiana State University after winning a state high school speech title but decided not to attend the university.

==Career==
===Early career===
His first acting role in Hollywood was providing the opening voiceover narration for &quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot; (1974). Larroquette did this as a favor for the film&#x27;s director Tobe Hooper, and was paid in marijuana. His first series regular role was in the 1970s NBC program &quot;Baa Baa Black Sheep&quot;, where he portrayed a World War II United States Marine Corps fighter pilot, 2nd Lt. Bob Anderson.

In a 1975 appearance on &quot;Sanford and Son&quot;, Larroquette played Lamont&#x27;s counterpart in a fictitious sitcom based on Fred and Lamont called &quot;Steinberg and Son&quot;. During the filming of &quot;Stripes&quot; (1981), his nose was nearly cut off in an accident. He ran down a hall into a door that was supposed to open but did not, and his head went through the window in the door.

===&quot;Night Court&quot; (1984–1992)===

Larroquette played Assistant District Attorney Dan Fielding on &quot;Night Court&quot;; the character was initially rather conservative, but changed after the sitcom&#x27;s creator Reinhold Weege came to learn more about Larroquette&#x27;s sense of humor. The role won him Emmy Awards in 1985, 1986, 1987 and 1988. In 1989, he asked not to be considered for an Emmy Award. His four consecutive wins were, at the time, a record.

&quot;Night Court&quot; ran on NBC from 1984 until 1992. Larroquette, Harry Anderson (as Judge Harry Stone), and Richard Moll (as bailiff Bull Shannon) appeared in every episode of the series. There was talk of spinning Dan Fielding off into his own show, but Larroquette said no to the idea. Later, Larroquette ended up on the 2023 series continuation as the only regular character from the original in the revival. On February 13, 2024, while talking to reporters, Larroquette admitted feeling a little sad when he first walked on the set of the &quot;Night Court&quot; revival, due to being one of the only cast members from the original run still living. But as time went on, he started feeling better and credited co-star/executive producer Melissa Rauch for rejuvenating the franchise.

===&quot;The John Larroquette Show&quot;===
Instead of a spinoff, Larroquette and Don Reo developed a show revolving around some of Larroquette&#x27;s own personal demons, particularly alcoholism. &quot;The John Larroquette Show&quot;, named by the insistence of NBC, starred Larroquette as the character John Hemingway. The show was lauded by critics, but failed to attract the prime-time audience, ranking around number 97 for most of the first season.

NBC threatened cancellation; however, Larroquette and Reo were granted the chance to retool the series, which saw it carry on for just over two more seasons, ending during its fourth season after 84 episodes, the last six of which were not aired. The show has a loyal cult following, although the series has never received an official home video release from Warner Bros.

===&quot;Boston Legal&quot; and other television roles===
In 1998, he guest-starred on three episodes of the legal drama &quot;The Practice&quot;. His portrayal of Joey Heric, a wealthy, wisecracking, narcissistic psychopath with a habit of stabbing his gay lovers to death, won him his fifth Emmy Award. He reprised the role for one episode in 2002, for which he was once again nominated for an Emmy Award. He also appeared in an episode of &quot;The West Wing&quot; as White House Counsel Lionel Tribbey.

In 2003, Larroquette reprised his narration for the remake of &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot;. From 2004 to 2006, he played the title role in the &quot;McBride&quot; series of ten &quot;Hallmark Mysteries&quot; television films. In 2007, he joined the cast of &quot;Boston Legal&quot; playing Carl Sack, a serious, ethical lawyer (the polar opposite of his more famous lawyer character, Dan Fielding). He also guest-starred in the drama &quot;House&quot; where he played a previously catatonic father awakened to try to save his son. 

From 2014 to 2018, Larroquette was a regular on &quot;The Librarians&quot; as Jenkins (actually the long-lived Camelot knight Sir Galahad), who provides support to the Librarians as a researcher and caretaker.

===Film===
His starring roles include the 1989 film &quot;Second Sight&quot; with Bronson Pinchot, and &quot;Madhouse&quot; with Kirstie Alley. Other films in which Larroquette had significant roles include: &quot;Blind Date&quot;, &quot;Stripes&quot;, &quot;Meatballs Part II&quot;, &quot;Summer Rental&quot;, &quot;Star Trek III: The Search for Spock&quot;, &quot;JFK&quot;, and &quot;Richie Rich&quot;.

===Theatre===
Larroquette made his musical stage debut in the Los Angeles production of &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas!&quot; as Old Max in 2009. He made his Broadway debut in the 2011 revival of &quot;How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying&quot; as J B. Biggley alongside Daniel Radcliffe. He won the Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Musical and the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Featured Actor in a Musical for his performance in the show.

He appeared on Broadway in a revival of Gore Vidal&#x27;s &quot;The Best Man&quot;, starring James Earl Jones, Angela Lansbury, and Candice Bergen. In early 2019, he was back in New York City starring in the play &quot;Nantucket Sleigh Ride&quot; by John Guare, at the Lincoln Center Theatre. In this off-beat play, Larroquette portrayed the lead character, Edmund &quot;Mundie&quot; Gowery, for a three-month run.

==Personal life==
Larroquette met his wife Elizabeth Ann Cookson in 1974 while working in the play &quot;Enter Laughing&quot;. They were married July 4, 1975, as that was the only day they had off from rehearsals. Cookson brought her daughter Lisa from a previous relationship into the marriage, and she and Larroquette would have two sons together, Jonathan and Benjamin. Jonathan co-hosts a comedy podcast called &quot;Uhh Yeah Dude&quot;.

Larroquette battled alcoholism from the mid-1970s to the early 1980s. On &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; on March 10, 2007, he joked, &quot;I was known to have a cocktail or sixty.&quot; He stopped drinking on February 6, 1982.

<text>&quot;The Adventure of the Illustrious Client&quot; (1924) is one of the 56 Sherlock Holmes short stories written by British author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, and one of the 12 stories collected as &quot;The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes&quot; (1927). It was first published in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; in the United States in November 1924, and in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in the United Kingdom in two parts, in February and March 1925.

==Plot==
Sir James Damery comes to see Holmes and Watson about his illustrious client&#x27;s problem (the client&#x27;s identity is never revealed to the reader, although Watson finds out at the end of the story; it is heavily implied to be King Edward VII). General de Merville&#x27;s young daughter Violet has fallen in love with the roguish and sadistic Austrian Baron Adelbert Gruner, who Damery and Holmes are convinced is a shameless philanderer and a murderer. His victim was his last wife, of whose murder he was acquitted owing to a legal technicality and a witness&#x27;s untimely death. She met her end in the Splügen Pass. Holmes also finds out that the Baron has expensive tastes and is a collector and a recognised authority on Chinese pottery.

Holmes&#x27;s first step is to see Gruner, who is amused to see Holmes trying to &quot;play a hand with no cards in it&quot;. The Baron will not be moved and claims that his charm is more potent than even a post-hypnotic suggestion in conditioning Violet&#x27;s mind to reject anything bad that might be said about him. Gruner tells the story of Le Brun, a French agent who was crippled for life after being beaten by thugs after making similar inquiries into the Baron&#x27;s personal business.

Holmes gets some help with his mission in the form of Shinwell Johnson, a former criminal who now acts as an informer for Holmes in London&#x27;s underworld. Johnson rakes up Miss Kitty Winter, the Baron&#x27;s last mistress, who was left permanently disfigured by him. She is bent on revenge, and will do anything to help Holmes. Kitty tells Holmes that the Baron &quot;collects women&quot; and chronicles his conquests in a book. Holmes realises that this book, written in Gruner&#x27;s own hand, is the key to curing Violet of her devotion to the scoundrel. Kitty tells Holmes that this book is kept in the Baron&#x27;s study.

First, Holmes goes to see Violet, bringing Kitty with him, but Violet is proof against Holmes&#x27;s words. Kitty then makes it clear that Violet might end up ruined, or murdered, by Gruner if she continues. Violet still stands firm, and the meeting ends with Holmes narrowly averting a public scene involving the enraged Kitty.

Later, Holmes is attacked by two of Gruner&#x27;s men, and the newspapers imply that he is near death. Watson goes to 221B Baker Street, only to discover that Holmes&#x27;s injuries have been exaggerated to give the impression that he will be out of action for quite a while. Several days later, Holmes is sufficiently recovered to be out of bed. The Baron is planning a trip to the United States just before the wedding, and will be leaving in three days. Holmes knows that Gruner will take his incriminating book with him, never daring to leave it behind in his study.

Holmes orders Watson to learn everything that he can about Chinese pottery in the next 24 hours. The next day, Holmes presents Watson with a fake business card styling him as &quot;Dr. Hill Barton&quot; and an actual piece of Ming pottery, a saucer. He is to go to Baron Gruner&#x27;s house, pose as a connoisseur of Chinese pottery, and try to sell the saucer. Watson does as Holmes tells him, but cannot fool the Baron for very long, and Gruner soon realises who has sent him.

As Watson faces his murderous captor, a noise from another room alerts the Baron, and he rushes into his study just in time to see Holmes jump out of the window, having stolen the book. The Baron rushes to the window, but Kitty Winter, who has been hiding outside, throws oil of vitriol in his face. Watson applies treatment to his injuries until further assistance comes.

The Baron is now hideously disfigured, but Holmes says this would not break Violet&#x27;s attachment. When Violet sees the book of conquests, written in her fiancé&#x27;s handwriting, she is forced to admit she has been wrong. An announcement in &quot;The Morning Post&quot; reports the engagement has been called off, and also that vitriol-throwing charges are being pressed against Kitty Winter. Extenuating circumstances reduce her sentence to the lowest possible for such an offence.

==Publication history==
&quot;The Adventure of the Illustrious Client&quot; was first published in the US in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; in November 1924, and in the UK in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in February–March 1925. The story was published in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; with four illustrations by John Richard Flanagan, and in the &quot;Strand&quot; with eight illustrations by Howard K. Elcock. It was included in the short story collection &quot;The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, which was published in the UK and the US in June 1927.

The original manuscript of the story is now held by the National Library of Scotland, it was formerly in the possession of Jean Conan Doyle.

==Adaptations==

===Radio and audio dramas===
The story was adapted by Edith Meiser as an episode of the American radio series &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. The episode aired on 23 February 1931, with Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson. Other dramatisations of the story, likely with the same script or a slightly altered script, also aired in the same series on 8 March 1933 (again with Gordon and Lovell) and 18 April 1936 (with Gordon as Holmes and Harry West as Watson).

Meiser also adapted the story as an episode of the American radio series &quot;The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; that aired on 5 October 1941 (with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson). Another episode adapted from the story aired on 9 May 1948 (with John Stanley as Holmes and Alfred Shirley as Watson).

A radio adaptation aired in 1960 on the BBC Light Programme, as part of the 1952–1969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson. It was adapted by Michael Hardwick.

An audio drama based on the story, starring Robert Hardy as Holmes and Nigel Stock as Watson, was released on LP record in 1971. It was dramatised and produced by Michael Hardwick (who also adapted the 1960 BBC radio version of the same story) and Mollie Hardwick.

&quot;The Illustrious Client&quot; was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 1994 by Bert Coules as part of the 1989–1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson, featuring Michael Feast as Baron Gruner and Ruth Gemmell as Violet de Merville.

In 2010, the story was adapted for radio as part of &quot;The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, a series on the American radio show &quot;Imagination Theatre&quot;, with John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson.

In 2023, the podcast Sherlock&amp;Co adapted the story in a three-episodes adventure called &quot;The Illustrious Client&quot;, starring Paul Waggot as Watson and Harry Attwell as Sherlock.

===Television===

The story was adapted in 1965 for an episode of &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;, starring Douglas Wilmer as Holmes, Nigel Stock as Watson, Peter Wyngarde as Baron Grüner and Rosemary Leach as Kitty Winter.

The 1991 Granada TV version with Jeremy Brett is faithful to the original, except that it shows that Miss Winter&#x27;s revenge attempt on the Baron was because he had disfigured her neck and chest with oil of vitriol, and in the small detail that Grüner finds Holmes inside the house, and Kitty (played by Kim Thomson) rushes inside and past Holmes to throw the vitriol at Grüner played by Anthony Valentine.

In &quot;Elementary&quot;″s third season, Kitty Winter (Ophelia Lovibond) and Adelbert Gruner (Stuart Townsend) are introduced in a mid-season story arc that changes Gruner from a philanderer and a baron to a corporate vice president and serial rapist-murderer. Kitty escaped from his captivity before he was able to kill her. She spends the first half of the season training under Holmes as a detective. When Gruner arrives in New York, she exposes his identity. Violet de Merville is a supporting character, the sister of another suspect who has no connection to Gruner. In this version, Kitty flees the United States to an unstated destination so as to escape arrest after she scarred Gruner&#x27;s face with a caustic chemical. In a later episode, &quot;The View From Olympus&quot;, Holmes mentions a previous case about a man who killed his wife on the Splügen Pass and made her murder look like an accident.

<text>Edward A. Terry (January 24, 1839 – June 1, 1882) was an officer in the United States Navy during the American Civil War. Following the war, he served several tours of duty at the United States Naval Academy, including a tour in the 1870s as Commandant of Cadets.

==Early life and career==
Born at Hartford, Connecticut, Terry entered the United States Naval Academy on September 21, 1853, and graduated on June 10, 1857. He served as a midshipman in the sloop , attached to the East India Squadron, from 1857 to 1859.

==Civil War==
In 1861 he was assigned to the steam sloop and served in her with the Western Gulf Blockading Squadron throughout the Civil War. He participated in the engagement with the Confederate ram during the Battle of the Head of Passes on October 12, 1861, the artillery duel with Fort McRee and other shore batteries in Pensacola Bay on 22 November, the passage of Forts Jackson and St. Philip, and the capture of New Orleans in late April 1862.

After New Orleans, David Farragut&#x27;s force moved up the Mississippi, and Terry was present when the salt water fleet ran the gauntlet at Vicksburg and joined Flag Officer Charles Henry Davis&#x27; riverine fleet above the Confederate stronghold. In January 1863, Terry was promoted to lieutenant commander. On March 14, his ship joined others of the fleet in bombarding the batteries surrounding Port Hudson so that Farragut could dash past them and establish a blockade cutting the Confederacy&#x27;s Red River supply line. In his last major engagement, the Battle of Mobile Bay on August 5, 1864, Terry helped to close the last major Confederate port on the Gulf of Mexico.

==Post-war assignments==
Following the Civil War, Terry alternated between sea duty and a series of shore assignments at the Naval Academy. In 1866–67, he served in the Pacific Squadron in the steam frigate .

His first tour of duty at the Naval Academy followed in 1868–69. He assumed his first command, , in 1870 and cruised with the Asiatic Fleet until 1872. During that assignment, on October 30, 1871, he was promoted to commander. Terry returned to the Naval Academy in 1873, and in 1875 was appointed Commandant of Midshipmen, a post he held until 1878.

Terry was then ordered to the Pacific Squadron to serve as Flag Captain in ; first to Rear Admiral C. R. Perry Rodgers, then in 1880–81 to Rear Admiral Thomas H. Stevens.

In 1881, he went on leave due to illness. On June 1, 1882, Commander Terry died at Manitou Springs, Colorado.

==Namesake==
Two ships in the United States Navy have been named for him.

<text>Jeffrey Bertrand Coleman Blake (born December 4, 1970) is an American former professional football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 14 seasons. Blake was a member of seven teams during his career, playing his longest stint with the Cincinnati Bengals from 1994 to 1999. Prior to his five seasons in Cincinnati, he spent his first two seasons with the New York Jets, who selected him in the sixth round of the 1992 NFL draft. He spent the second half of his career playing for the New Orleans Saints from 2000 to 2001 and one season each with the Baltimore Ravens, Arizona Cardinals, Philadelphia Eagles, and Chicago Bears.

During his Bengals tenure, Blake was selected to the Pro Bowl in 1995. He holds the record for the longest Pro Bowl touchdown at 93 yards.

==Early life==
Blake was born on December 4, 1970, in Daytona Beach, Florida to Peggy and Emory Blake. His father was a slotback for the Canadian Football League with the Toronto Argonauts. Tragedy struck on July 5, 1976, when his mother died when trying to rescue her younger sibling from drowning at Wekiwa Springs State Park. Emory decided to cancel a tryout scheduled with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and find a job to be with his only son. He was soon hired as a physical education teacher and coach in the school system of Sanford, Florida. Blake was near his father&#x27;s side growing up, whether that involved singing in the choir at Progress Missionary Baptist Church to his pastor father or as a sideline helper at Seminole High School to his coach father.

Blake was a star quarterback at Seminole High School in Florida, with his father Emory as offensive coordinator. When it came to recruiting, Florida, Miami, and Florida State tried to recruit him outside of the quarterback position, which he resisted. Of the three to actually offer him a chance to play the QB position, Blake chose East Carolina University, who heavily recruited him and gave him confidence that he could play at the school because &quot;They were used to having black quarterbacks there...so in their eyes I was simply a quarterback.&quot;

==College career==
After playing sparingly in his first two years at East Carolina, he got more time to play as the starter in 1990. They were 5–6 that year, but the 1991 was a shock all the way around, as they ultimately won eleven games (three of them versus ranked teams) while Blake finished sixth in the 1991 Heisman Trophy voting and the Pirates finished with a #9 ranking at the end of the season. He was inducted into the East Carolina Hall of Fame in 2007.

===College statistics===
==Professional career==

Blake was not valued highly as a draft prospect due to his height, which was measured slightly under 6 feet. Blake was drafted in the sixth round by the New York Jets in 1992 but he played little before being cut in 1993. He credited head coach Bruce Coslet in instilling the steps to have a lengthy career by having a focus on defense and trying to read defenses, which they did for the first four weeks Blake was with the Jets. When Coslet was fired after the 1993 season, he soon was hired as the offensive coordinator for the Cincinnati Bengals. He encouraged the Bengals to pick up Blake, who was brought into a roster that had David Klingler as the starter and Donald Hollas as the presumed backup. The 1994 Bengals were 0–7 with David Klingler before Blake was thrust into the starting role due to injuries by Klingler and Hollas. He threw for 243 yards and two touchdowns in his debut against the Dallas Cowboys in a narrow 23–20 loss. Blake went 3–6 as a starter, throwing for 2,154 yards with 14 touchdowns to 9 interceptions. He was named the starter for the 1995 season. That year saw local interest for his play, with a rap song even being composed called &quot;Shake-N-Blake&quot;; he established great rapport with Bengal receivers Carl Pickens and Darnay Scott, helping the former vie for the receiving title in 1995. They won only seven games, but Blake threw for 3,822 yards with 28 touchdowns to 17 interceptions as Blake made the Pro Bowl. One writer later argued that his play helped influence Ohio voters in Hamilton County to approve a sales tax increase to help fund a new new stadium for the team, as the measure passed in March 1996 (the stadium opened in 2000). He signed a five-year, $13.1 million contract not long before the Pro Bowl selection. The 1996 season, where the Bengals went 8–8 with Blake as starter, was the only one between 1991 and 2002 that did not result in a losing season. He threw for 3,624 yards with 24 touchdowns to 14 interceptions. The 1997 season was less successful. Amidst a year that saw him start just 11 games (with others filled by Boomer Esiason), Blake threw for 2,125 yards with 8 touchdowns and 7 interceptions. 1998 saw Blake passed over for free agent Neil O&#x27;Donnell for all but two games. He was given the bulk of the time in 1999 while they tried to nurture newly drafted Akili Smith, with Blake going 3-9 and throwing for 2,670 yards with 16 touchdowns to 12 interceptions.

Frustrated by management, Blake left the Bengals after the 1999 season in free agency. He signed with the New Orleans Saints as a free agent. Blake started 11 games at quarterback before breaking his foot late in the 2000 season and being replaced by Aaron Brooks. He threw for 2,025 yards with 13 touchdowns and 9 interceptions as the Saints were 7–4 with him as starter as Brooks led the Saints to the playoffs. Blake left the Saints after the 2001 season saw him get no starts in favor of Brooks. He started 11 games for the Baltimore Ravens in 2002 (after injury to Chris Redman) and 13 games for the Cardinals in 2003, but neither team expressed interest in signing him to a long-term contract.

Blake was signed by the Chicago Bears before the 2005 NFL season to replace back-up quarterback Chad Hutchinson. Following an injury to the Bears&#x27; starting quarterback, Rex Grossman, coach Lovie Smith opted to select rookie Kyle Orton to fill the slot. During the last game of the regular NFL season, Blake was put in to replace Kyle Orton during the fourth quarter, completing eight of nine passes. Despite stating that he wished to continue playing for the Bears and work with Grossman, the Bears did not express any interest in re-signing Blake. His contract with the team expired before the start of the 2006 NFL season. His position was filled by Kyle Orton, who was demoted after the Bears signed Brian Griese to serve as Grossman&#x27;s back-up. At the conclusion of his fourteen-year career, Blake amassed 21,711 passing yards, with 134 touchdown passes, and 99 interceptions. A mobile quarterback, Blake ran for 2,027 career rushing yards and 14 touchdowns. He made 100 career starts.

==Personal life==
Blake settled in Austin, Texas after retirement. He met his wife Lewanna as a sophomore in college, and they had four children in Emory, Torre, Trey, and Lahne. His son Emory won a national championship with Auburn in 2010. He threw footballs for his son for Auburn&#x27;s Pro Day. His daughter, Torre, auditioned for The Voice in 2024 and she chose Snoop Dogg as her coach. In 2017, he expressed interest in trying to open a football academy, as he had done a handful of sessions with football players over the years. He worked as a coach at IMG Academy as Director of the QB Academy. In 2023, he was hired to serve as head coach and offensive coordinator for Valley Sports Academy with the Prepstar 7-on-7 football team in Lake Hallie, Wisconsin.

<doc id="1338070" wikidata="Q506970" url="?curid=1338070" title="Do or Die (Dropkick Murphys album)">
<text>Do or Die is the debut studio album by the Celtic punk band Dropkick Murphys. It was released in 1998. A music video for the single &quot;Barroom Hero&quot; was released. It is the only album that featured original lead vocalist Mike McColgan, who went on to become a fireman before forming his own band, the Street Dogs.

==Reception==

&quot;The Washington Post&quot; noted that &quot;combining the Clash and the Pogues may not be an especially clever maneuver, but the result is certainly rousing.&quot; The &quot;Telegram &amp; Gazette&quot; wrote that &quot;the band strikes an earnest pose that champions anyone wearing a blue collar, be it one below a scally cap or shaved head.&quot; AllMusic gave &quot;Do or Die&quot; a rating of three stars out of five, and said that the album was &quot;an interesting blend of hardcore-style punk with traditional Irish inflections.&quot;

==In other media==

A &quot;Do or Die&quot; poster appears on the wall of John Connor&#x27;s bedroom in the pilot episode of &quot;&quot;.
&quot;Barroom Hero&quot; was used in the final credits of the documentary &quot;Restrepo&quot;.
&quot;Never Alone&quot; was featured in the Extreme sports video game &quot;Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX&quot;. &quot;Cadence to Arms&quot; was featured in &quot;College&quot;, the fifth episode of season one of &quot;The Sopranos&quot;.

<doc id="1338075" wikidata="Q3041825" url="?curid=1338075" title="The Adventure of the Blanched Soldier">
<text>&quot;The Adventure of the Blanched Soldier&quot; (1926) is one of 12 Sherlock Holmes short stories by British writer Arthur Conan Doyle included in &quot;The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. It was first published in the US in &quot;Liberty&quot; in October 1926, and in the UK in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in November 1926, and is one of 56 short stories in the canon of Sherlock Holmes. This story is one of only two narrated by Holmes rather than Doctor Watson, the other one being &quot;The Adventure of the Lion&#x27;s Mane&quot;. Dr Watson does not appear in either story.

== Plot ==
In January 1903, at Baker Street, James M. Dodd comes to Holmes with a strange story regarding his friend, Godfrey Emsworth. Dodd and Emsworth served in the Imperial Yeomanry in South Africa during the Second Boer War. Emsworth was sent home after being treated for a bullet wound; hearing nothing from his friend for quite some time afterwards, Dodd began to suspect something was amiss.

Dodd wrote to Colonel Emsworth, Godfrey&#x27;s father, and was told Godfrey had gone on a voyage round the world for his health. Dodd found it odd that Godfrey himself had not written to him about this matter, and managed to convince Godfrey&#x27;s mother to invite him to the Emsworth family home, Tuxbury Old Park, near Bedford. There were four people there—the colonel and his wife, and an old butler and his wife. The irritable colonel repeated the story about his son&#x27;s world voyage, implied Dodd was lying about knowing Godfrey, and abruptly refused Dodd&#x27;s request for Godfrey&#x27;s contact information.

That evening, in the ground-floor bedroom, Dodd talked to the butler, Ralph. After Ralph mentioned Godfrey in the past tense, Dodd asked if Godfrey was dead, to which the butler replied &quot;I wish to God he was, Sir!&quot; After Ralph had left, Dodd was considering what the phrase might mean, when he suddenly saw Godfrey&#x27;s face looking in on him through the window. Godfrey&#x27;s skin was blotched white in places, and when he realized he had been spotted, he fled into the night. Dodd pursued him, but stopped after hearing a door slam in the distance.

Determined to solve the mystery, Dodd contrived to stay one more night in Tuxbury Old Park. While exploring the estate, he met a small, well-dressed man coming out of one of the outbuildings. The man also indicated Godfrey had gone away, but Dodd later noticed the man watching him suspiciously. Fearing that Godfrey was being held against his will in the outbuilding, Dodd secretly returned to the building at night and looked through the window. He spotted the well-dressed man reading a paper in one chair, and Godfrey sitting in another chair, his back to the window. At this point, Colonel Emsworth discovered what Dodd was up to, berated him for violating the family privacy, and ordered him off the premises. 

After hearing Dodd&#x27;s story, Holmes asks two questions; one, to clarify Godfrey&#x27;s strange blanched appearance, and two, what sort of paper the well-dressed man was reading, though Dodd is uncertain of the answer to the second question. The two agree to return to Tuxbury Old Park in a week&#x27;s time.

Upon his arrival at Tuxbury Old Park, Holmes observes Ralph removing a pair of tarry-smelling leather gloves, indicating the presence of disinfectants. The colonel threatens to summon the police if Dodd and Holmes do not leave, but Holmes points out that this would make the family secret public. He writes the word &quot;leprosy&quot; on a piece of paper and shows it to the colonel; realising that Holmes knows all, the colonel agrees to grant Holmes and Dodd an interview with Godfrey. 

The young soldier orders them to keep their distance while he tells his story. When he was wounded in South Africa, he had dragged himself to a nearby building and slept in a bed there; in the morning, a doctor on the premises found him, and informed him that the building was a leper hospital and that Godfrey was in danger of catching the disease. Godfrey was sent to a regular hospital, and later back home to England; however, some weeks later, white blotches began to appear on his skin. Fearing he had caught leprosy, and knowing that he would be forced into segregation in a leper colony if the British authorities found out, Godfrey and his parents decided that he should hide. The well-dressed man staying with Godfrey is Dr. Kent, a sympathetic local general practitioner who agreed to keep the Emsworth&#x27;s secret.

The story ends happily. With Dr. Kent&#x27;s permission, Holmes brings Sir James Saunders, a famous dermatologist from London, to see to Godfrey. Sir James determines that Godfrey is not a leper, but is suffering from ichthyosis, an unsightly but non-contagious treatable disease.

==Related stories==
Holmes&#x27;s investigation of the mystery is delayed because he is engaged in clearing up &quot;the case which my friend Watson has described as that of the Abbey School, in which the Duke of Greyminster was so deeply involved&quot;. The Duke of Holdernesse was the principal client in the case of the Priory School.

&quot;The Adventure of the Blanched Soldier&quot; was first published in the US in &quot;Liberty&quot; in October 1926, and in the UK in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in November 1926. The story was published with five illustrations by Frederic Dorr Steele in &quot;Liberty&quot;, and with five illustrations by Howard K. Elcock in the &quot;Strand&quot;. It was included in the short story collection &quot;The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, which was published in the UK and the US in June 1927.

The original manuscript of the story is now part of the Berg Collection at the New York Public Library.

==Adaptations==
The story was dramatised by Edith Meiser as episodes of the American radio series &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; that aired on 2 March 1931 (with Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson) and 2 May 1936 (with Gordon as Holmes and Harry West as Watson).

Meiser also adapted the story as an episode of the American radio series &quot;The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; that aired on 19 February 1940 (with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson).

Michael Hardwick dramatised &quot;The Blanched Soldier&quot; for the BBC Light Programme in August 1959 as part of the 1952–1969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Sherlock Holmes and Norman Shelley as Dr. Watson, with Frederick Treves as James M. Dodd.

The story was adapted for BBC Radio 4 in 1994 by Roger Danes as part of the 1989–1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson. It featured Robert Glenister as James Dodd, Hannah Gordon as Jean Watson, and Derek Waring as Colonel Emsworth.

In 2014, the story was adapted for radio as an episode of &quot;The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, a series on the American radio show &quot;Imagination Theatre&quot;, with John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson.

It was adapted into one of the books of the Hong Kong children&#x27;s book series &quot;The Great Detective Sherlock Holmes&quot;, as &quot;The Blanched Soldier&quot; (連環失蹤大探案). It is Book #22 of the original Chinese version, and book #18 of the English version.

<text>Commodore George Hamilton Perkins (October 20, 1836 – October 29, 1899) was an officer in the United States Navy during the American Civil War.

==Biography==

Born in Contoocook, New Hampshire, in the northern part of Hopkinton to the Honorable Hamilton Eliot Perkins, George was appointed as acting midshipman in October 1851 and graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy with the class of 1856. 

===Early career===
During the rest of that decade Midshipman Perkins served on at sea on the sloop of war &quot;Cyane&quot;, the storeship &quot;Release&quot; and the steamer &quot;Sumpter&quot;. He attained the ranks of master in 1859 and lieutenant in February 1861, on the eve of the Civil War. Perkins spent the conflict&#x27;s first several months in the &quot;Sumpter&quot;, operating on anti-slavery patrols. In early 1862 he was assigned as executive officer to the West Gulf Blockading Squadron (WGBS) Unadilla-class gunboat under its commanding officer Lieutenant N.B. (Napoleon Bonaparte) Harrison in which he performed distinguished service during the 1862 campaigns to capture New Orleans and the lower Mississippi River. 

During Admiral Farragut&#x27;s assault up-river towards New Orleans April 24–25, the &quot;Cayuga&quot;, with Lt. Perkins at the wheel through the storm of shot and shell, was the first warship to pass forts Jackson and St. Phillip. The &quot;Cayuga&quot; found itself alone north of the forts and being assailed by eleven Confederate vessels, including the sloop rigged steamer C.S.S. &quot;Governor Moore&quot; which the &quot;Cayuga&quot; sank, and the ram C.S.S. &quot;Manassas&quot;, whose attack narrowly missed the &quot;Cayuga&#x27;s&quot; stern. Once the fleet lay at anchor in the river off New Orleans, Lieutenant Perkins accompanied Captain Theodorus Bailey, U.S.N., in the first boat sent ashore, to demand the surrender of the city (which was refused).

He was next executive officer of the steam sloop &quot;Pensacola&quot;, receiving promotion to lieutenant commander at the end of 1862. His service on the Mississippi and in the Gulf of Mexico continued in 1863–1865, including command of gunboats &quot;New London&quot; and &quot;Sciota&quot;, and the monitor &quot;Chickasaw&quot;. While in the latter ship, his aggressive and effective conduct during the August 1864 Battle of Mobile Bay was a major factor in the capture of the Confederate ironclad &quot;Tennessee&quot;.

===Post-Civil War===
In the years immediately following the Civil War, Lieutenant Commander Perkins was superintendent of iron-clads at New Orleans, executive officer of the steam sloop &quot;Lackawanna&quot; in the North Pacific, and had ordnance duty at the Boston Navy Yard. Reaching the rank of commander in early 1871, he spent the next decade as commanding officer of the storeship &quot;Relief&quot; and gunboat &quot;Ashuelot&quot; and had further shore duty at Boston.

Perkins was promoted to captain in 1882 and commanded the Pacific Station flagship during the mid-1880s. Captain Perkins&#x27; subsequent active service was limited to court-martial duty. He was transferred to the Retired List in October 1891, but in 1896 received a Congressionally authorized promotion to the retired rank of commodore in recognition of his gallantry and skill during the Battle of Mobile Bay three decades earlier. Commodore Perkins died at Boston on 28 October 1899.

Perkins was a First Class Companion of the Massachusetts Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States.

==Family==

The commodore married a daughter of William Fletcher Weld, a multimillionaire from Boston&#x27;s famous Weld Family.

Their daughter, Isabel Weld Perkins, married Larz Anderson, a wealthy businessman who served as Ambassador to Japan under William Howard Taft. Among the homes they maintained was Perkins Manor, the commodore&#x27;s birthplace.

The Andersons&#x27; legacy to the public includes Anderson House, Anderson Memorial Bridge, Larz Anderson Auto Museum, Larz Anderson Bonsai Collection and Larz Anderson Park.

==Ships named after Perkins==
The U.S. Navy has named three destroyers in honor of George H. Perkins, including: 
*USS &quot;Perkins&quot; Destroyer # 26, later DD-26 of 1910–1935
*USS &quot;Perkins&quot; (DD-377) of 1936–1943
*USS &quot;Perkins&quot; (DD-877, later DDR-877 and DD-877) of 1945–1973.

<doc id="1338096" wikidata="Q889520" url="?curid=1338096" title="Tilth">
<text>Tilth is a physical condition of soil, especially in relation to its suitability for planting or growing a crop. Factors that determine tilth include the formation and stability of aggregated soil particles, moisture content, degree of aeration, soil biota, rate of water infiltration and drainage. Tilth can change rapidly, depending on environmental factors, such as changes in moisture, tillage and soil amendments. The objective of tillage (mechanical manipulation of the soil) is to improve tilth, thereby increasing crop production; in the long term, however, conventional tillage, especially plowing, often has the opposite effect, causing the soil carbon sponge to oxidize, break down and become compacted.

Soil with good tilth is spongy with large pore spaces for air infiltration and water movement. Roots grow only where the soil tilth allows for adequate levels of soil oxygen. Such soil also holds a reasonable supply of water and nutrients.

Tillage, organic matter amendments, fertilization and irrigation can each improve tilth, but when used excessively, can have the opposite effect. Crop rotation and cover crops can rebuild the soil carbon sponge and positively affect tilth. A combined approach can produce the greatest improvement.

== Aggregation ==
Good tilth shares a balanced relation between soil-aggregate tensile strength and friability, in which it has a stable mixture of aggregate soil particles that can be readily broken up by shallow, non-abrasive tilling. A high tensile strength will result in large cemented clods of compacted soil with low friability. Proper management of agricultural soils can positively affect soil aggregation and improve tilth quality.

Aggregation is positively associated with tilth. With finer-textured soils, aggregates may in turn be made up of smaller aggregates. Aggregation implies substantial pores between individual aggregates.

Aggregation is important in the subsoil, the layer below tillage. Such aggregates involve larger (2- to 6-inch) blocks of soil that are more angular and not as distinctive. These aggregates are less affected by biological activity than the tillage layer. Subsurface aggregates are important for root growth deep into the profile. Deep roots allow greater access to moisture, which helps in drought periods. Subsoil aggregates can also be compacted, mainly by heavy equipment on wet soil. Another significant source of subsoil compaction is the practice of plowing with tractor wheels in the open furrow.

== Pore size ==
Soil that is well aggregated has a range of pore sizes. Each pore size plays a role in soil&#x27;s physical functioning. Large pores drain rapidly and are needed for good air exchange during wet periods, preventing oxygen deficiency that can drown plants and increase pest problems. Oxygen-deficient wet soils increase denitrification – conversion of nitrogen to gaseous forms. In degraded soil, large pores are compressed into small ones.

Small pores are critical for water retention and help a crop endure dry periods with minimal yield loss.

== Management ==
Soil tilth is naturally maintained by the interaction of plant roots with the soil biota.

Short lived tilth can be obtained through mechanical and biological manipulation.

=== Tillage ===
In 2021, the globally tilled soil volume was estimated at 1840 km3/yr. This value exceeds by two orders of magnitude the global total of all engineering earthworks. For comparison globally, the natural process of soil bioturbation by plant roots and earthworms, was estimated at 960 km3/yr.

Mechanical soil cultivation practices, including primary tillage (mold-board or chisel plowing) followed by secondary tillage (disking, harrowing, etc.), break up and aerate soil. Mechanical traffic and intensive tilling methods have a negative impact on soil aggregates, friability, soil porosity, and soil-bulk density. When soils become degraded and compacted, such tillage practices are often deemed necessary. The tilth created by tillage, however, tends to be &quot;unstable&quot;, because the aggregation is obtained through the physical manipulation of the soil, which is short lived, especially after years of intensive tillage. The compaction of soil aggregates can also decrease soil biota due to the low levels of oxygen in the top-soil. The resulting high soil-bulk density results in lower water infiltration from rainfall or conventional irrigation (surface, sprinkler, center-pivot); in turn, the series of processes will naturally erode and dissolve small soil particles and organic matter. The consequences from these processes cyclically require more tilling and intervention, thus tillage practices have the capability to disrupt biological mechanisms that stabilize soil structure, the soil carbon sponge and tilth quality.

=== Biological ===
The preferred scenario for good tilth is as the result of natural soil-building processes, provided by the activity of plant roots, microorganisms, earthworms and other beneficial organisms. Such stable aggregates break apart during tillage/planting and readily provide good tilth. Soil biota and organic matter work in unison to bind soil aggregates and establish a natural soil stability – a soil carbon sponge. Plant root exudates feed bacteria that emit extracellular polysaccharides (EPS), and feed the growth of fungal hyphae, to form a soil carbon sponge with the dispersed clay particles. These active tilth-forming processes contribute to the formation and stabilization of soil structure. The resulting soil structure reduces tensile strength and soil-bulk density while still forming soil aggregates through their abiotic/biotic binding mechanisms that resist breakdown during water saturation. The fungal hyphae networks can establish a role of enmeshment with EPS and rhizodeposition, thus improving aggregate stability. However, these organic materials are themselves subject to biological degradation, requiring active amendments with organic material, and minimal mechanical tillage. Tilth quality is heavily dependent on these naturally binding processes between biotic microorganisms and abiotic soil particles, as well as the necessary input of organic matter. All constituents in this naturally binding network must be supplied or managed in agriculture to ensure the sustainability of their presence through growing seasons.

=== Rotation ===
Crop rotation can help restore tilth in compacted soils. Two processes contribute to this gain. First, accelerated organic matter decomposition from tillage ends under the sod crop. Another way to achieve this is via no-till farming. Second, grass and legume sods develop extensive root systems that continually grow and die off. The dead roots supply a source of active organic matter, which feeds soil organisms that create aggregation – the soil carbon sponge. Beneficial organisms need continual supplies of organic matter to sustain themselves and they deposit the digested materials on soil aggregates and thereby stabilize them. Also, the living roots and symbiotic microorganisms (for example, mycorrhizal fungi) can exude organic materials that nourish soil organisms and help with aggregation. Grass and legume sod crops therefore deposit more organic matter in the soil than most other crops.

Some annual rotation crops, such as buckwheat, also have dense, fibrous, root systems and can improve tilth. Crop mixtures with different rooting systems can be beneficial. For example, red clover seeded into winter wheat provides additional roots and a more protein-rich soil organic matter.

Other rotation crops are more valuable for improving subsoils. Perennial crops, such as alfalfa, have strong, deep, penetrating tap roots that can push through hard layers, especially during wet periods when the soil is soft. These deep roots establish pathways for water and future plant roots, and produce soil organic matter.

Crops rotation can extend the period of active growth compared to conventional row crops, leaving more organic material behind. For example, in a corn–soybean rotation, active growth occurs 32% of the time, while a dry bean–winter wheat–corn rotation is active 72% of the time. Crops such as rye, wheat, oat, barley, pea and cool-season grasses grow actively in the late fall and early spring when other crops are inactive. They are beneficial both as rotation and cover crops, although intensive tillage can negate their effects.

== Soil types ==
The soil management practices required to maintain soil tilth are a function of the soil type. Sandy and gravelly soils are naturally deficient in small pores and are therefore drought-prone, whereas loams and clays can retain and thus supply crops with more water.

=== Coarse-textured, sandy soils ===
Sandy soil has a lower capacity to hold water and nutrients. Water is frequently applied in smaller amounts to avoid leaching and carrying nutrients below the root zone. Routine application of organic matter increases sandy soil&#x27;s ability to hold water and nutrients by 10 times or more.

=== Fine-textured, clay soils ===
Clay soils lack large pores, restricting both water and air movement. During irrigation or rain events, the limited large pore space in fine-textured soils quickly fills with water, reducing soil oxygen levels. In addition to routine application of organic matter, microorganisms and earthworms perform a crucial role in soil tilth. As microorganisms decompose the organic matter, soil particles bind into larger aggregates, increasing large pore space. Clay soils are more subject to soil compaction, which reduces large pore spaces.

=== Gravelly and decomposed granite soils ===
Such soils natively have little tilth, especially once they have been disturbed. Adding organic matter up to 25% by volume can help compensate. For example, if tilling to a depth of eight inches, add two inches of organic materials.

<doc id="1338098" wikidata="Q3041815" url="?curid=1338098" title="The Adventure of the Three Gables">
<text>&quot;The Adventure of the Three Gables&quot; is one of the 56 Sherlock Holmes short stories by British writer Arthur Conan Doyle, collected as one of 12 in &quot;The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. It was first published in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in 1926 as a serial.

==Plot==
The story begins with a visit to 221B Baker Street from Steve Dixie, a black man and a cowardly ruffian who warns Sherlock Holmes to keep away from Harrow. Although Dixie has come to intimidate Holmes, Holmes secures Dixie&#x27;s future cooperation by threatening to tell what he knows about the suspicious Perkins death involving Dixie. Dixie&#x27;s boss is Barney Stockdale, and he must be connected with the Harrow Weald case, of which Holmes has just learnt from a message from Mary Maberley, a lady who lives at Three Gables, a house at Harrow Weald.

Mrs Maberley is an elderly woman whose son has recently died in Rome. He was an attaché there. Some peculiar things have happened at Three Gables. Mrs Maberley has lived there nearly two years and in all that time has attracted very little attention from her neighbours. Suddenly, however, a man came to her recently and offered to buy her house and all the furniture in it. She was not really willing to do it, especially after her lawyer, Mr Sutro, told her that the legal agreement drawn up by this prospective buyer would forbid her to remove any possessions from the house when she moved out.
As she is telling Holmes this story, he becomes aware that someone is eavesdropping on the conversation. He opens a door and drags in Susan, a wheezing maid. Holmes manages to establish that Susan communicated to Barney Stockdale the fact that her mistress was hiring Sherlock Holmes, and that precipitated Steve Dixie&#x27;s visit. Holmes also finds out that a rich woman hired Barney Stockdale and his thugs to do her dirty work. Susan is also a member of the gang but will not give up all their secrets. She leaves in a huff.

Obviously, this woman wants something that has come into the house quite recently. Holmes, seeing some trunks with Italian placenames on them, realizes that her late son Douglas&#x27;s belongings must hold the key. He instructs Mrs Maberley to try to get Mr Sutro to spend a couple of nights at Three Gables, to keep the house guarded.

Holmes finds Dixie outside, keeping the house under surveillance. Dixie is now inclined to help Holmes if he can, to avoid any indiscreet talk about the Perkins lad who met his end so tragically. He swears, however, that he does not know who has hired Barney Stockdale.

The following day, the Three Gables is burgled, and Holmes and Watson go back to investigate. The burglars chloroformed Mrs Maberley and stole a manuscript from her son&#x27;s belongings. She had managed to grab part of one sheet of paper from it when, coming round, she lunged after one of the thieves.

The police inspector at the scene treats the matter as an ordinary burglary, but Holmes knows better. He examines the bit of manuscript retained by Mrs Maberley, and it appears to be the end of a lurid novel. Holmes is struck by the peculiar wording; the story abruptly changes from third-person narration to first-person narration. It is in Douglas&#x27;s handwriting; so it would seem that he was putting himself in a story that he was writing.

Holmes and Watson go to see Isadora Klein, a wealthy woman who is used to getting what she wants. The happenings at Three Gables, and the information Holmes obtained from Langdale Pike, &quot;his human book of reference upon all matters of social scandal&quot;, have all added up to something. It turns out that Douglas Maberley was involved with Isadora Klein at one time. She broke the relationship off, and he almost wrought his revenge by writing a thinly veiled account of their affair, to be published as a novel. Everyone in London would know who the characters truly were, were the novel ever published. Isadora established that no copy had ever been sent to Douglas&#x27;s publisher but realized that he must have a copy. She hired Barney Stockdale and his confederates to secure the manuscript. She tried legal means at first, and when that did not work, she resorted to crime. She has burnt the manuscript.

Holmes forces Isadora Klein to write a cheque for £5000 to furnish Mrs Maberley with a first-class trip round the world in return for his silence about Isadora&#x27;s nefarious dealings.

==Commentaries ==
&quot;The Adventure of the Three Gables&quot; has been criticized for its reliance on racist stereotypes in the portrayal of the black boxer, Steve Dixie. This contrasts strikingly with Doyle&#x27;s earlier sympathetic portrayal of an interracial marriage, in &quot;The Adventure of the Yellow Face&quot; (1893).

D. Martin Dakin wrote that &quot;no admirer of Holmes can read these scenes [with or discussing Steve Dixie] without a blush&quot;. Dakin saw Holmes&#x27;s crude jeers at Dixie as completely out of character for the detective, and this was one reason behind his conclusion that someone other than Doyle had in fact written the story. Others, including Walter Pond, have rejected Dakin&#x27;s argument and concluded that there is no reason to doubt Doyle&#x27;s authorship.

==Publication history==
&quot;The Adventure of the Three Gables&quot; was first published in the US in &quot;Liberty&quot; in September 1926, and in the UK in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in October 1926. The story was published with six illustrations by Frederic Dorr Steele in &quot;Liberty&quot;, and with four illustrations by Howard K. Elcock in the &quot;Strand&quot;. It was included in the short story collection &quot;The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, which was published in the UK and the US in June 1927.

==Adaptations==

===Radio===

The story was adapted by Edith Meiser as an episode of the American radio series &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; that aired on 12 November 1931, with Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson. Another episode adapted from the story aired on 7 April 1935 (with Louis Hector as Holmes and Lovell as Watson).

Meiser also adapted the story as an episode of the American radio series &quot;The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; that aired on 18 January 1942, with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson.

A radio adaptation of the story aired in 1964 on the BBC Light Programme, as part of the 1952–1969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson. It was adapted by Michael Hardwick. The cast included Frank Singuineau as Steve Dixie and Selma Vaz Dias as Isadora Klein.

&quot;The Three Gables&quot; was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 1994 by Peter Ling as part of the 1989–1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson, featuring Susannah Corbett as Susan Stockdale and Mary Wimbush as Mrs Maberly. In this adaptation, it is stated that &quot;Langdale Pike&quot; is a pen name derived from the Langdale Pikes, and that his real name is Clarence Gable.

In 2007, the story was adapted as an episode of &quot;The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, a series on the American radio show &quot;Imagination Theatre&quot;, with John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson. Like in the 1994 BBC adaptation, it is stated in the episode that &quot;Langdale Pike&quot; is a pseudonym. In this adaptation, he is a disinherited member of a noble family and his real name is implied to be Lord Peter.

In 2024 the Goalhanger podcast Sherlock and co released the three gables as a 3 part adventure with Paul Waggott as John Watson, Harry Attwell as Sherlock Holmes and Marta Da Silva as Mariana Ametxazurra (Mrs Hudson).

===Television===

Granada Television&#x27;s &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; series featuring Jeremy Brett as Holmes and Edward Hardwicke as Dr Watson presented the story with several differences. Douglas Maberley is depicted as Mary Maberley&#x27;s grandson instead of her son; he dies in his grandmother&#x27;s house after a month of suffering from a bout of pneumonia caused by a savage beating he received from Mrs Klein&#x27;s hired boxers; Langdale Pike defines himself as a benevolent counterpart of Charles Augustus Milverton (the eponym of an earlier story about a blackmailer, although his last name is slightly different) and points out that he suppresses more than he exposes; and Steve Dixie retains some enmity towards Holmes and brawls with Watson during the break-in.

In CBS&#x27; contemporary &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; adaptation &quot;Elementary&quot;, the season 2 premiere episode, &quot;Step Nine&quot;, features a case very briefly involving a character named Langdale Pike, the owner of a 3D printer manufacturing company that Holmes seeks out via a sign requesting something from him, which he holds up in front of a security camera for an extended period of time.

The episode &quot;The Adventure of the Blue Polar Bear&quot; from the NHK puppet series &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;, is based on &quot;The Adventure of the Three Gables&quot; and &quot;The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle&quot;. It features Isadora Klein as a female juvenile gang leader.

<doc id="1338103" wikidata="Q14457614" url="?curid=1338103" title="Aspirational age">
<text>In advertising and marketing, aspirational age is an ideal age whose characteristics consumers aspire to embody. Thus, marketing messages aimed at that target age will resonate with consumers of other ages.

The aspirational age in Western society is the cusp between childhood and adulthood. In theory, consumers younger than this age aspire to the maturity and freedom it signifies, while those older than it seek to recapture the youthfulness and freedom from responsibility of this age. Thus, products pitched at notional young adults will appeal to a broader target market.

== Ideology ==
The aspirational age can be identified as the age of which consumers associate positive experiences with, such as freedom. For example, most adults are preoccupied with day-to-day responsibilities which can be viewed as stressful. Marketing to the aspirational age therefore, allows businesses to attract a generation of nostalgic consumers. The aspirational age as a tool is thus essentially modelled on the notion of nostalgia. From the adult&#x27;s perspective, the psychology behind the &#x27;aspirational age&#x27; can be defined as a recapture of youthful days. &#x27;High-speed modern living, stress and the impact of recession&#x27; have all been considered as factors which influence a consumer&#x27;s longing of their &#x27;aspirational age&#x27;.

== Evidence ==
The aspirational age relies on a youth-obsessed culture, which is particularly associated with the Western World, specifically America. Crux Research states that the aspirational age in the form of adverts targeted to kids, essentially works as &#x27;adults aspire backwards&#x27;. Thus utilising this emotional link allows marketers, if effective, to target a wider audience.

A study of &#x27;Age Related Vicarious Nostalgia and Aesthetic Consumption&#x27; from the University of Wolverhampton concluded age as a phenomenon which is not &#x27;totally bound to chronological time constraints&#x27;. In this sense, nostalgia &#x27;has a bearing on the cognitive age of the individual&#x27;, making it useful for businesses to market towards the aspiration age, in an attempt to trigger a pleasant cognitive response. The Harvard Business Review article on a study conducted by the Grenoble School of Management, states that &#x27;nostalgic feelings increased people&#x27;s willingness to pay for desired objects&#x27;. The article concludes that the psychology behind the aspirational age is &#x27;useful to brands looking to elicit feelings of nostalgia in their promotions&#x27; . The article uses Subaru&#x27;s 2012 &#x27;First Car Story&#x27; as an example, although the car does not target 16-year-olds, the campaign allows adults to create their own first car story through animation. The desired result, as the study suggests, is that when consumers think nostalgically, they spend more money.

== Examples ==
Examples of real-life businesses who appear to market towards the aspirational age include Urban Outfitters and Pepsi. An article by The Business Journals identifies how using technology, businesses market their products to the aspirational age. The aspirational age then becomes a tool for product development alongside marketing. The article cites Urban Outfitters&#x27; nostalgic marketing of introducing old famous brands i.e. Lisa Frank, Nickelodeon&#x27;s &#x27;90 Are All That&#x27; time slots and Pepsi&#x27;s &#x27;Pepsi Throwback&#x27; as example of businesses which market towards the aspirational age. Thus the aspirational age as a tool, targets the particular age whilst simultaneously allowing the older generation to reflect on products or services they once loved.

== Differences ==

=== Generational differences ===
Differences between generations would however mean that marketing to the &#x27;aspirational age&#x27; today might not necessarily attract older consumers, as their experiences of being younger would differ greatly. Social changes and technological advancements would have influenced different experiences thus different aspirations.
* Generation Y; (1981-1996) Generation Y is defined as a product of &#x27;Baby Boomers&#x27;, accustomed to the onset of media and the genesis of the Internet. Generation Y is categorised by &#x27;choice customisation, scrutiny, integrity, speed and entertainment&#x27;.
* Generation Z; (1997-2012) Generation Z is characterised by the onset of &#x27;Tweendom&#x27;. Teenagers within this generation today recognised by the need for &#x27;instant gratification, success as a given and liberal social values&#x27;. Thus the product of a Generation Y youth would be more accustomed to &#x27;cyber speak&#x27; (certainly within the Western world). Since one quarter of 8-18 year olds spend their time using social media, the aspirational age can be difficult to estimate. The success of the aspirational age as a marketing tool is dependable on the success of how adaptable the latter generation is towards the target audience.

=== Industries ===

==== Music ====
Businesses can market to the aspirational age, yet this would vary depending on the industry. For example, music labels can build brand development according to their own &#x27;aspirational ages&#x27;. Labels can identify the age of 32 as an aspirational age for example. How Music Builds Value identifies the 32-year-old lifestyle as a time which can &#x27;supersede the elements of mass-market life&#x27;. The case study cites that the label (Smashburger) can create an &#x27;aspirational experience&#x27; by targeting 32-year-olds due to being a &#x27;magical age&#x27;.

==== Food ====
Differences within a particular industry can also occur in terms of appropriate aspirational ages. An Integrated Approach to New Food Product Development recognises the aspirational age as &#x27;1–3 years older than the calendar age of the child&#x27;. This would depend on the product and who the manufacturer aims to target. If the business desires a wider target audience, the target age should be &#x27;acceptable to the youngest age in the target&#x27;. The article recognises the aspirational age as the &#x27;safe&#x27; choice as consumers would not &#x27;reject a product that has a simpler flavour profile&#x27;.

=== Cultural differences ===
The aspirational age of the Western world would differ greatly. For example, to assume the aspired age (if accepted as within adolescence) would correspond universally could be stereotypical. Heavily influenced by societal laws such as marriageable age or legal drinking for example, differences in experiences would thus lead to different idealised aspirational ages between cultures.

== Issues ==

=== Stereotypes ===
A report by Age UK recognised advertising aimed at the aspirational age rather than the biological age as &#x27;stereotypical&#x27;. A study conducted by Age UK, led by Sandra Chalmers found that elderly people felt that their generation were &#x27;completely ignored&#x27;. Thus under-representation of older consumers due to marketing towards an aspirational age can be risky. Ann Murray Chatterton examined 52 commercials to find 35% included someone who was above the age of 50, and 12% including someone above the age of 65 years. Consequently, older consumers are less represented in an attempt to capture the target audience.

== Effectiveness and future use of the aspirational age ==

=== Product development ===
The article Nostalgia: A Neuropsychiatric Understanding even suggests that product development using smell can induce &#x27;nostalgic recall&#x27; and is thus an important &#x27;marketing tool&#x27;. In this sense, the aspirational age can be embedded as a factor within product development.

=== Reversals ===
Reversals of the aspirational age would differ as the child&#x27;s aspirational age has risen &#x27;whilst the adults has fallen&#x27;. Children at Play: An American History assessed the relationship between products and age within America to conclude that &#x27;marketers who once sought to sell toys to fourteen year olds have lowered their age target to ten&#x27;. The aspirational age will continue to adapt as societal changes occur.

&quot;&quot;An eleven year old no longer asks for a stuffed animal or a fire truck and instead desires a Madden NFL football game, a cell phone, an iPod, or a Beyonce Knowles CD, while a thirty-five-year-old may also indulge by buying a Madden football game, a cell phone, an iPod, or a Beyonce Knowles CD&quot;.&quot;

<doc id="1338105" wikidata="Q2740092" url="?curid=1338105" title="The Adventure of the Sussex Vampire">
<text>&quot;The Adventure of the Sussex Vampire&quot;, written by British author Arthur Conan Doyle, is one of 12 Sherlock Holmes stories collected between 1921 and 1927 as &quot;The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. It was first published in the January 1924 issues of &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in London and &quot;Hearst&#x27;s International&quot; in New York.

==Plot==
Holmes receives an odd letter that makes reference to vampires. Mr. Robert Ferguson, who comes to 221B Baker Street the next morning, has become convinced that his Peruvian second wife has been sucking their baby son&#x27;s blood. By his first wife, he has a 15-year-old son named Jack, who suffered an unfortunate accident as a child and now, although he can still walk, does not have full use of his legs. Since the start of the bloodsucking, Jack has unaccountably been struck twice by his stepmother, although Mr. Ferguson cannot imagine why. Ever since being found out by her husband, she has locked herself in her room and refused to come out. Only her Peruvian maid, Dolores, is allowed in. She takes Mrs. Ferguson her meals.

Even before Holmes and Watson set off for Mr. Ferguson&#x27;s house in Sussex, Holmes has worked out what is going on, and it has nothing to do with vampires. Holmes&#x27;s trip is made simply to observe and confirm what he has already deduced.

Upon their arrival in Sussex, Mrs. Ferguson&#x27;s maid announces that her mistress is ill, and Dr. Watson offers to help. He finds an agitated woman in the room upstairs – she speaks of all being destroyed, and of sacrificing herself rather than breaking her husband&#x27;s heart. She also demands her child, who has been with the nurse, Mrs. Mason, ever since Mr. Ferguson found out about the bloodsucking incidents. Holmes examines the South American weapons displayed in the house and meets the children. While Mr. Ferguson is doting on his younger son, Watson notices that Holmes is gazing at the window. He cannot imagine why his friend is doing this.

Holmes then reveals the truth about what has been happening, much to the relief of Mrs. Ferguson as this is exactly what she has been hoping for: the truth to come from someone else&#x27;s lips. It turns out that the culprit is Jack, Mr. Ferguson&#x27;s elder son, who is extremely jealous of his young half-brother. Holmes has confirmed this by looking at Jack&#x27;s reflection in the window while his father&#x27;s attention was on the baby. Jack has been attempting to murder his half-brother by shooting poisoned darts at him, and his stepmother&#x27;s behaviour of sucking the baby&#x27;s neck is thereby explained: she was sucking the poison out. It also explains why she struck Jack, and why she was sick when Holmes and Watson arrived. The wounds, therefore, were caused by the darts, not by her biting. Mrs. Ferguson had not wanted to be the one to tell her husband what Jack had done.

== Publication history ==
&quot;The Adventure of the Sussex Vampire&quot; was first published in the UK in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in January 1924, and in the US in &quot;Hearst&#x27;s International&quot; (under the title &quot;The Sussex Vampire&quot;) in the same month. The story was published with four illustrations by Howard K. Elcock in the &quot;Strand&quot;, and with four illustrations by W. T. Benda in &quot;Hearst&#x27;s International&quot;. It was included in the short story collection &quot;The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, which was published in the UK and the US in June 1927.

== Adaptations ==
=== Radio ===
The story was adapted by Edith Meiser as an episode of the American radio series &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. The episode aired on 16 February 1931, with Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson. The script was used again for an episode that aired on 7 March 1936 (with Gordon as Holmes and Harry West as Watson).

Meiser also adapted the story as an episode of the American radio series &quot;The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; that aired on 2 October 1939 (with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson), and another episode that aired on 14 December 1947 (with John Stanley as Holmes and Alfred Shirley as Watson).

A radio dramatisation of the story adapted by Michael Hardwick aired on the BBC Light Programme in 1964, as part of the 1952–1969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson.

&quot;The Sussex Vampire&quot; was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 1994 by Bert Coules as part of the 1989–1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson. It featured Michael Troughton as Robert Ferguson.

In 2012, the story was adapted for radio as an episode of &quot;The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, a series on the American radio show &quot;Imagination Theatre&quot;, with John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson.

=== Television ===
In a 1993 televised adaptation of this case entitled &quot;The Last Vampyre&quot;, produced by Granada Television and starring Jeremy Brett as Sherlock Holmes, the case was altered. In the televised version, Holmes was called by the town vicar to investigate the death of the Ferguson baby, with the prime suspect being the newly arrived Mr. John Stockton, a man of eccentric behaviour descended from a local family rumoured to be vampires. During this investigation, it is revealed that Jack Ferguson, driven to delusions by the childhood accident which cost him the full use of his legs, has come to believe himself to be a vampire because of the power and fear such a creature inspires. He sees Stockton as a &#x27;mentor&#x27; of sorts due to his seemingly vampire-like ability to charm women. The case concludes with Stockton dead in an accident; the villagers digging up Stockton&#x27;s body and taking it to his family&#x27;s old, burned-out house; Mrs. Ferguson&#x27;s sucking blood from her maid&#x27;s neck to remove poison introduced by Jack; Ferguson attempting to stake Stockton&#x27;s corpse; and Jack throwing himself from the ruined Stockton house, believing he can fly as part of his delusion. When Holmes and Watson discuss the case as they wait for their train, Holmes suggests that the world may not be prepared for a report of this case.

An episode of the animated television series &quot;Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century&quot; was based on the story. The episode, titled &quot;The Adventure of the Sussex Vampire Lot&quot;, first aired in 1999.

The 2018 Japanese television drama &quot;Miss Sherlock&quot; adapted &quot;The Adventure of the Sussex Vampire&quot; in season 1, episode 4 &quot;The Wakasugi Family&quot;, setting it in modern-day Japan. The episode is fairly faithful to the original, but includes a secondary antagonist motivated by revenge.

===Books===
It was adapted into one of the books of the Hong Kong children&#x27;s book series &quot;The Great Detective Sherlock Holmes&quot;, as &quot;The Mystery of the Vampire&quot; (吸血鬼之謎). It is Book #13 of the original Chinese version, and book #4 of the English version.

The work was adapted a crossover between &quot;Young Miss Holmes&quot; and Dance in the Vampire Bund.

<text>&quot;The Adventure of the Three Garridebs&quot; is one of the 56 Sherlock Holmes short stories written by British author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. One of the 12 stories in the cycle collected as &quot;The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes&quot; (1927), it was first published in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; in the United States on 25 October 1924, and in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in the United Kingdom in January 1925.

According to Dr. Watson&#x27;s opening narration, this story is set at &quot;the latter end of June, 1902...the same month that Holmes refused a knighthood for services which may perhaps some day be described.&quot; This is a parallel to the knighthood of Arthur Conan Doyle around the same time.

==Plot==

Holmes receives a letter from a man named Nathan Garrideb of 136 Little Ryder Street, in which the writer asks for help in finding someone else who shares his unusual surname. He has been informed by an American, John Garrideb of Kansas, that if he can find another Garrideb he stands to inherit a large fortune.

The American visits Holmes and Watson at 221B Baker Street, and is not pleased that Nathan has involved a private detective. John Garrideb, who claims to be a lawyer, tells a story about meeting a millionaire land tycoon in Kansas named Alexander Hamilton Garrideb, who bequeathed his $15 million estate to John, with the proviso that he find two more men of the same surname to share it with equally. John says he has come to England to seek out people with this name, having failed to find anyone in his home country. So far, he has found only Nathan.

Holmes deduces that John Garrideb has been in London for some time, and is not newly arrived as he claims. When Holmes invents a fictitious Kansas politician, John Garrideb says he once knew him. Holmes does not reveal that he knows John Garrideb is lying, and instead arranges to meet Nathan Garrideb. Upon arrival at Little Ryder Street, Holmes observes Nathan Garrideb&#x27;s nameplate outside the house. It has obviously been there for years, leading Holmes to conclude that this is his real name.

Nathan Garrideb is an elderly eccentric who collects everything from ancient coins to old bones. Nathan&#x27;s rooms look like a museum, but he holds nothing of financial value. It is not clear what the American might be after.

During the visit, John Garrideb arrives, having supposedly found a newspaper advertisement purportedly placed by one Howard Garrideb in the course of his everyday business. Holmes observes that John Garrideb must have placed the advertisement himself as the terms and spelling are distinctly American. Despite Nathan&#x27;s objections, John Garrideb insists that he must travel to Birmingham and meet this Howard Garrideb. Holmes realizes that the whole scheme is John Garrideb&#x27;s way to get Nathan out of the way for a while.

Next day, Holmes goes to see Inspector Lestrade at Scotland Yard and identifies John Garrideb as James Winter &quot;alias&quot; Morecroft &quot;alias&quot; &quot;Killer&quot; Evans, who has escaped from prison after shooting three men in the United States. In London, he had killed Rodger Prescott, a Chicago forger whose description matches the former occupant of Nathan Garrideb&#x27;s room. Holmes and Watson go to Garrideb&#x27;s home armed with revolvers. They do not have to wait long before Winter arrives. From their hiding place, Holmes and Watson see the criminal use a &quot;jemmy&quot; to open a trapdoor, revealing a little cellar. They capture Winter, but not before he manages to shoot twice, striking Watson in the leg. Holmes is distraught over Watson&#x27;s injury, and strikes Winter on the head with the butt of a gun hard enough to draw blood. Fortunately, Watson&#x27;s wound is superficial. The cellar contains a printing press and stacks of counterfeit banknotes, hidden there by Prescott, the man that Winter had killed.

Winter is sent back to prison. Nathan Garrideb ends up in a nursing home, so great is his disappointment, but many CID men are pleased that Prescott&#x27;s equipment has at last been found. Despite being hurt, Watson seems the happiest at the adventure&#x27;s outcome, declaring, from the sight of Holmes&#x27;s panic and rage over his friend&#x27;s shooting, that &quot;It was worth a wound, it was worth many wounds, to know the depth of loyalty and love which lay behind that cold mask&quot;.

==Publication history==

&quot;The Adventure of the Three Garridebs&quot; was published in the US in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; on 25 October 1924, and in the UK in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in January 1925. The story was published with three illustrations by John Richard Flanagan in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;, and with five illustrations by Howard K. Elcock in the &quot;Strand&quot;. It was included in the short story collection &quot;The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, which was published in the UK and the US in June 1927.

As noted by Wilma Morgan: &quot;The Three Garridebs&quot; takes up many plot elements used in the much earlier story &#x27;The Red-Headed League.&#x27; Both stories feature a rather naive, sedentary, middle aged bachelor who happens to sit on a location of great interest to cunning criminals. And in both stories, a very elaborate hoax is cooked up, involving a fake bequest by a fictional rich American, in order to make the bachelor go away and leave the criminals a clear field—which would have worked fine but for Sherlock Holmes seeing through the hoax. One difference between the two stories—and I am not sure that it is an improvement—is that in the second case, unlike the first, the innocent bachelor is deeply hurt and damaged by the hoax worked on him.&quot;

==Adaptations==

===Radio===

The story was adapted by Edith Meiser as an episode of the American radio series &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. The episode aired on 2 June 1932, with Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson.

Other dramatisations of the story aired on the American radio series &quot;The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; on 25 December 1939 (with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson, and also adapted by Meiser) and 9 May 1949 (with John Stanley as Holmes and Wendell Holmes as Watson).

A radio adaptation of the story, dramatised by Michael Hardwick, aired in 1964 on the BBC Light Programme, as part of the 1952–1969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson.

&quot;The Three Garridebs&quot; was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 1994 by David Ashton as part of the 1989–1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson, featuring Lou Hirsch as John Garrideb.

In 2009, the story was adapted for radio as part of &quot;The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, a series on the American radio show &quot;Imagination Theatre&quot;, with John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson.

===Television===

The then-newly formed NBC sought permission from Lady Conan Doyle to produce &quot;The Three Garridebs&quot; for American television in 1937. This would be the first televised adaptation of Doyle&#x27;s detective. Louis Hector was cast as Holmes with William Podmore as Watson.

In 1994 the story was again adapted for television. Jeremy Brett was taken ill during the production of the Granada Television adaptation of this story (which was also a conflation with &quot;The Adventure of the Mazarin Stone&quot; and transmitted under the latter title) and so Holmes&#x27;s role in the plot was taken by Mycroft Holmes with Charles Gray called in at short notice to reprise his role as Sherlock&#x27;s older brother. Some note that &quot;In addition to being immensely entertaining, &quot;The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes&quot; has the unfortunate bonus of tracing the decline of Jeremy Brett&#x27;s health, episode by episode.&quot;

The case is referenced in the &quot;Sherlock&quot; episode &quot;The Final Problem&quot;.

<doc id="1338122" wikidata="Q6273433" url="?curid=1338122" title="Jonathan Howe">
<text>Jonathan Trumbull Howe (born August 24, 1935) is a retired four-star United States Navy admiral, and was the Special Representative for Somalia to United Nations Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali from March 9, 1993, succeeding Ismat Kittani from Iraq, until his resignation in February 1994. During his time in Somalia he oversaw UNOSOM II operations including the &#x27;Bloody Monday&#x27; raid which killed dozens and was a decisive turning point in the UNSOM II mission.

Howe was also the former Deputy National Security Advisor in the first Bush Administration. He currently is executive director of The Arthur Vining Davis Foundations.

==Early life and education==
Howe is a 1957 graduate of the United States Naval Academy, and earned Master of Arts, Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy, and Doctor of Philosophy degrees from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University from 1968 to 1969.

==Naval service==
Howe&#x27;s naval commands included the (1974–1975), Destroyer Squadron 31 (1977–1978), and Cruiser-Destroyer Group Three (1984–1986). His other assignments include Military Assistant to the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs (1969–1974), Assistant to the Vice President for National Security Affairs (1975–1977), Chief of Staff of the Seventh Fleet in Yokosuka, Japan (1978–1980), Senior Military Assistant to the Deputy Secretary of Defense from 1981 to 1982, Director of the State Department&#x27;s Bureau of Political-Military Affairs from 1982 to 1984, deputy chairman, NATO Military Committee, Brussels, Belgium (1986–1987), Assistant to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (1987–1989). From May 1989 he served simultaneously as Commander in Chief, Allied Forces Southern Europe and Commander, United States Naval Forces Europe. Following that assignment, he was named Deputy Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs by President George H. W. Bush in 1991, succeeding Robert M. Gates when he moved on to become CIA director. He retired from the United States Navy in 1992.

During his time as Deputy Assistant he was directly involved in the pursuit of President Manuel Noriega of Panama.

==Service in Somalia and the Bloody Monday attack==

In 1992, Howe was selected by the Clinton Administration to head UNOSOM II - the UN operation in Somalia that took over from the US in May in what was described by one American official as &quot;the miscasting of the century.&quot; In this capacity he came under criticism for hiding away from the action in his fortified bunker, and for his pursuit of Somali military leader Mohamed Farrah Aidid, which was called a &quot;personal vendetta.&quot;

On July 12, 1993, Howe oversaw the event Somalis call Bloody Monday. According to American war correspondent Scott Peterson a group of Somali elders had gathered at a house to discuss a way to make peace to end the violence between Somali militias and the UN forces. The gathering had been publicized in Somali newspapers the day before the attack as a peace gathering. After being tipped off by an undercover operative, American Cobra attack helicopters launched TOW missiles and 20 mm caliber cannon fire at the structure. According to a Somali survivor, American ground troops killed 15 survivors at close range with pistols, a charge American commanders deny. According to the International Committee of the Red Cross there were over 200 Somali casualties. Four Western journalists were killed at the scene by Somalis following the attacks.

Howe claimed that the mission took out a &quot;very key terrorist planning cell&quot; and that no civilians were killed. He stated &quot;we knew what we were hitting. It was well planned.&quot; The event is considered a turning point in the war as Somalis turned from wanting peace to wanting revenge, ultimately leading to the Black Hawk Down Incident. Human Rights Watch declared that the attack &quot;looked like mass murder.&quot;

==Personal life==
Howe is author of the 1971 book &quot;Multicrises: Seapower and Global Politics in the Missile Age&quot;.

Admiral Howe was married to Dr. Harriet Mangrum Howe, whom he met in high school; her father, Richard C. Mangrum, was a U.S. Marine Corps general and served as Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps and his father, Hamilton W. Howe, was a Navy Admiral. She was an assistant professor of sociology at the University of North Florida.

Admiral Howe has six grown children, and currently resides in Florida.

<doc id="1338128" wikidata="Q363400" url="?curid=1338128" title="Nick Frost">
<text>Nicholas John Frost (born 28 March 1972) is an English actor, comedian and screenwriter. He has appeared in the &quot;Three Flavours Cornetto&quot; trilogy of films, consisting of &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot; (2004), &quot;Hot Fuzz&quot; (2007), and &quot;The World&#x27;s End&quot; (2013), and the television comedy &quot;Spaced&quot; (1999–2001). He also appeared in Joe Cornish&#x27;s film &quot;Attack the Block&quot; (2011). He co-starred in the 2011 film &quot;Paul&quot;, which he co-wrote with frequent collaborator and friend Simon Pegg. He has also portrayed various roles in the sketch show &quot;Man Stroke Woman&quot;. In 2020, he cocreated and starred in the paranormal comedy horror series &quot;Truth Seekers&quot; with Pegg.

==Early life==
Frost was born on 28 March 1972 in Hornchurch, Greater London, the son of John Frost and his Welsh wife, Tricia (died 2005), who were office furniture designers. When he was 10, his sister died of an asthma attack, aged 18. He attended Beal High School in Ilford. When Frost was 15 his parents&#x27; business failed and they lost the family home. They moved in with neighbours where he witnessed his mother having a stroke due to the stress. Frost left school and took a job with a shipping company to support the family. He subsequently spent two years at a kibbutz in Israel. He met actor Simon Pegg while working as a waiter at a North London Chiquito branch and the two became close friends and flatmates. Pegg and Jessica Hynes wrote a role for Frost in the cult slacker comedy series &quot;Spaced&quot; that was partly based on Pegg and Frost&#x27;s lifestyle at the time.

==Career==
He appeared in corporate training video clips such as &quot;Chris Carter and the Coverplan Challenge&quot;, a Dixons sales video, before playing Tim&#x27;s army-obsessed best friend Mike in &quot;Spaced&quot; (1999–2001), which aired on Channel 4 for two series. In 2001, Frost played a small role in a one-off episode of Victoria Wood&#x27;s &quot;Acorn Antiques&quot;. This was a specially written episode shown during the series called &quot;The Sketch Show Story&quot; that Victoria narrated, in which Frost played an armed robber who shot dead Acorn Antiques&#x27; most lovable character, Mrs Overall.

In 2002, Frost wrote and presented the show &quot;Danger! 50,000 Volts!&quot;, a spoof of the outdoors survival genre in which military experts demonstrate how to improvise solutions to dangerous problems. In the same year, Frost co-wrote and starred in &quot;The Sofa of Time&quot; with Matt King. In 2004, he appeared in &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot;, a &quot;romantic zombie comedy&quot; written by Simon Pegg and &quot;Spaced&quot; director Edgar Wright. In late 2005, Frost starred in the comedy sketch show &quot;Man Stroke Woman&quot; on BBC Three. A second series aired on in early 2007. In early 2006, Frost played Commander Henderson in two series of the BBC Two science fiction sitcom, &quot;Hyperdrive&quot;. Also in 2006, he acted in &quot;Kinky Boots&quot;. Frost had a small appearance in the British comedy &quot;Look Around You&quot;, a parody of 1970s/1980s technology parodying the format of shows like &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s World&quot;.

Frost and Pegg appeared in a second Pegg-Wright feature film called &quot;Hot Fuzz&quot;, an action and cop genre homage, set in Gloucestershire. Frost plays bumbling Constable Danny Butterman, who partners up with Pegg&#x27;s dynamic Nicholas Angel after the latter is transferred from the Metropolitan Police in London. The pair teamed up again for their self-penned 2011 science-fiction comedy film &quot;Paul&quot;, whose storyline concerns a fugitive alien. The two also starred in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures of Tintin: Secret of the Unicorn&quot; as Thomson and Thompson. Frost narrates the Channel 4 reality show &quot;Supernanny&quot;. He has made fleeting appearances on the Channel 4 surreal medical comedy series &quot;Green Wing&quot; as &quot;just a man&quot; in pub scenes (when Boyce asks who he is, he responds, &quot;just a man&quot;). In 2013, Frost played the role of Andy Knightley in the third Pegg-Wright feature film called &quot;The World&#x27;s End&quot;. In 2014, he played the eponymous character in the Sky Atlantic comedy &quot;Mr. Sloane&quot;.

In 2016, Frost was cast in an ensemble role for the second season of the AMC television series &quot;Into the Badlands&quot;.

In January 2024, Frost was announced to play Gobber the Belch in the live-action remake of &quot;How to Train Your Dragon&quot;.

==Personal life==
Frost is best friends of fellow actor Simon Pegg and the two have appeared alongside each other in six films. In a 2005 interview, Frost stated that he was brought up as a Catholic but is now an atheist. Frost is a patron of Humanists UK. He is a supporter of West Ham United and the England national football team, as well as being a rugby player, formerly playing for Barking RFC.

Frost lived with his half-Swedish wife, production executive Mariangela, in St Margarets, London. They married in 2008. He previously lived in Finsbury Park, which was also one of the filming locations for &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot;. On 22 June 2011, Mariangela gave birth to the couple&#x27;s son. They separated in 2013, and later divorced.

In October 2015, Frost released a memoir titled &quot;Truths, Half Truths &amp; Little White Lies&quot; (Hodder &amp; Stoughton), detailing his life up to the age of 30.

<doc id="1338130" wikidata="Q2371887" url="?curid=1338130" title="Postpositivism">
<text>Postpositivism or postempiricism is a metatheoretical stance that critiques and amends positivism and has impacted theories and practices across philosophy, social sciences, and various models of scientific inquiry. While positivists emphasize independence between the researcher and the researched person (or object), postpositivists argue that theories, hypotheses, background knowledge and values of the researcher can influence what is observed. Postpositivists pursue objectivity by recognizing the possible effects of biases. While positivists emphasize quantitative methods, postpositivists consider both quantitative and qualitative methods to be valid approaches.

==Philosophy==

===Epistemology===
Postpositivists believe that human knowledge is based not on a priori assessments from an objective individual, but rather upon human &quot;conjectures&quot;. As human knowledge is thus unavoidably conjectural, the assertion of these conjectures are &quot;warranted&quot;, or more specifically, justified by a set of &quot;warrants&quot;, which can be modified or withdrawn in the light of further investigation. However, postpositivism is not a form of relativism, and generally retains the idea of objective truth.

===Ontology===
Postpositivists believe that a reality exists, but, unlike positivists, they believe reality can be known only imperfectly. Postpositivists also draw from social constructionism in forming their understanding and definition of reality.

===Axiology===
While positivists believe that research is or can be value-free or value-neutral, postpositivists take the position that bias is undesired but inevitable, and therefore the investigator must work to detect and try to correct it. Postpositivists work to understand how their axiology (i.e. values and beliefs) may have influenced their research, including through their choice of measures, populations, questions, and definitions, as well as through their interpretation and analysis of their work.

==History==
Historians identify two types of positivism: classical positivism, an empirical tradition first described by Henri de Saint-Simon and Auguste Comte in the first half of the 19th century, and logical positivism, which is most strongly associated with the Vienna Circle, which met near Vienna, Austria, in the 1920s and 1930s. Postpositivism is the name D.C. Phillips gave to a group of critiques and amendments which apply to both forms of positivism.

One of the first thinkers to criticize logical positivism was Karl Popper. He advanced falsification in lieu of the logical positivist idea of verificationism. Falsificationism argues that it is impossible to verify that beliefs about universals or unobservables are true, though it is possible to reject false beliefs if they are phrased in a way amenable to falsification.

In 1965, Karl Popper and Thomas Kuhn had a debate as Thomas Kuhn&#x27;s theory did not incorporate this idea of falsification. It has influenced contemporary research methodologies.

Thomas Kuhn is credited with having popularized and at least in part originated the post-empiricist philosophy of science. Kuhn&#x27;s idea of paradigm shifts offers a broader critique of logical positivism, arguing that it is not simply individual theories but whole worldviews that must occasionally shift in response to evidence.

Postpositivism is not a rejection of the scientific method, but rather a reformation of positivism to meet these critiques. It reintroduces the basic assumptions of positivism: the possibility and desirability of objective truth, and the use of experimental methodology. The work of philosophers Nancy Cartwright and Ian Hacking are representative of these ideas. Postpositivism of this type is described in social science guides to research methods.

==Structure of a postpositivist theory==

Robert Dubin describes the basic components of a postpositivist theory as being composed of basic &quot;units&quot; or ideas and topics of interest, &quot;laws of interactions&quot; among the units, and a description of the &quot;boundaries&quot; for the theory. A postpositivist theory also includes &quot;empirical indicators&quot; to connect the theory to observable phenomena, and hypotheses that are testable using the scientific method.

According to Thomas Kuhn, a postpositivist theory can be assessed on the basis of whether it is &quot;accurate&quot;, &quot;consistent&quot;, &quot;has broad scope&quot;, &quot;parsimonious&quot;, and &quot;fruitful&quot;.

<doc id="1338147" wikidata="Q5580399" url="?curid=1338147" title="Goldy Gopher">
<text>Goldy Gopher is the mascot for the University of Minnesota and the associated sports teams, known as the Golden Gophers, as well as a four-time UCA Mascot National Champion (2011, 2013, 2017, and 2018). During the year, Goldy makes over 1000 appearances and is at virtually all home games for University teams, usually wearing the appropriate sporting attire. The mascot is based on the thirteen-lined ground squirrel, colloquially referred to as a “gopher” in Minnesota. Goldy was hit by a bus on February 11th, 2025.

==Origins==

Minnesota became known as the &quot;Gopher State&quot; in 1857, the result of a political cartoon ridiculing the $5 million Railroad Loan which helped open up the West. The cartoon portrayed shifty railroad barons as striped gophers pulling a railroad car carrying the Territorial Legislature toward the &quot;Slough of Despond&quot;. The first U of M yearbook bearing the name &quot;Gopher Annual&quot; appeared in 1887.

Minnesota&#x27;s athletic teams became widely known as the &quot;Gophers&quot; by the 1920s, but it was not until 1934 that Halsey Hall, great Minnesota sportswriter and broadcaster, dubbed Bernie Bierman&#x27;s all-gold uniformed team &quot;The Golden Gophers&quot;. Bierman had chosen the gold color because the football blended in with the uniforms.

The embodiment of the Gopher mascot came to life in 1952 when University of Minnesota assistant bandmaster Jerome Glass bought a fuzzy wool gopher suit with a papier-mâché head and asked one of the band members to climb into it. &quot;Goldy&quot; Gopher (the first name seems to have appeared sometime in the 1960s) became a fixture within the University of Minnesota Marching Band and Pep Band, as each year a band member was chosen to don the suit for that season. Wherever these two bands performed, Goldy was there to glad-hand with the crowd, hug the little kids, and torment the cheerleaders.

During the early 1960s, Goldy was written into the football pre-game and halftime shows with a specific place to be. Limited visibility from within the suit made it difficult to see out, and any of the suit&#x27;s wearers with glasses would fog up while trying to peer out the mouth hole, as the eyeholes were useless. One benefit during the cold games at Memorial Stadium in November was that Goldy Gopher was one of the few fans that stayed warm.

==Attitude and attire==

Each band member who was allowed the joy of being the Gopher developed an individual personality, a unique way of relating to the crowd. The mystique of Goldy Gopher became a tradition that absolutely prohibited removal of the head while in public, maintaining an illusion for the younger children that Goldy Gopher was a real live huggable animal.

From 1952 until 1990, the Gopher appearing at U of M sports events was a member of the Marching Band, and a symbiosis developed through the years that on more than one occasion kept Goldy out of trouble. With a propensity for attracting tail-pulling kids, Goldy relied on the band to save the gopher from their clutches. And when the opposing team&#x27;s cheerleaders or band members managed to “kidnap” the unfortunate rodent (a Big Ten tradition), band members would come to the rescue.

In the late 1980s the U of M Athletic Department began to make use of Goldy at an ever-increasing number of events, and held University-wide tryouts to secure a number of students who could cover the busy schedule. The Athletic Department&#x27;s Spirit Squad officially took charge of Goldy in 1992.

A signature move of Goldy&#x27;s is head spinning, usually brought on by crowd chants of &quot;Spin your head!&quot;, a tradition started at hockey games in the early 1990s. This is often followed by chants of &quot;Spin your body!&quot;, and occasionally &quot;Spin your tail!&quot;, with Goldy abiding and spinning the respective body parts. 1990s hockey games also sometimes featured Goldy sledding down the entirety of the Mariucci Arena staircase, nearly 30 rows. The tradition has been reigned in since then for safety concerns, but Goldy can still be found sledding and snowboarding from reduced heights.

The style of the gopher suit changed many times through the years, sometimes by chance, sometimes by design. Until the early 1970s, the head was narrow and pointy-nosed, reminiscent of the real animal. Then in 1972, Goldy suddenly grew chubby cheeks and a wider, forward-looking face, almost cherubic in appearance. The gopher of the 1970s and early 1980s was comparable in appearance to a teddy bear, a favorite of children and grandmothers. For a brief period in 1985, a fierce-looking “mega-rodent“ appeared, with a barrel chest, clown feet and sinister eyes. This look didn&#x27;t last long, and Goldy soon again became a lovable, friendly character.

The students that portray Goldy maintain anonymity throughout their tenure. They are also recognized as student athletes due to their vigorous schedule and amount of work that goes into it. They are considered a part of the &quot;Spirit Squad&quot; at the University of Minnesota, which encompasses the cheerleading and dance teams.

==Design==
Goldy’s first official design was made in the 1940s by sports merchandiser George Grooms, featuring a smiling &quot;gopher&quot; wearing a hat with the letter M on it. Grooms, while driving to the University of Minnesota from Iowa, stopped at a rest stop and sketched what he thought were gophers. He presented the drawing to U of M bookstore manager Harold Smith, who loved it. Only after the image was put into production did it become realized that the animal drawn was actually a chipmunk. 

In the 1950s, Goldy&#x27;s look became more animated. In the 1960s and 1970s, Goldy became more slim and simplistic, and was often drawn wearing sporting equipment. In 1979, the University hired Bill Stein to draw a new look for Goldy, which consisted of the mascot waving and wearing a shirt. Some commented that this drawing of Goldy wasn&#x27;t fierce enough as a college mascot, and in 1985, a new version of Goldy was drawn by Steve Wanvig, who was asked by the University to make a more aggressive look. This variation of Goldy was a buff gopher with a fierce expression; depicted to be wearing a sweater and charging. Students who preferred the old design formed a group called Save Our Wimp, who championed for the previous drawing&#x27;s more mild design. Responding to the criticism, the University&#x27;s athletics department asked Wanvig in 1986 to tone down Goldy, who was then drawn in the same style, but without huge muscles and with a friendlier expression. This version of Goldy has been the one used since.

==National competitions==
===UCA Mascot National Championships===
Goldy also competes in the UCA Mascot National Championships and regularly makes the top 3. Goldy’s first win was in 2011 and followed up with championships in 2013, 2017, and 2018.
=== Capital One ===
Goldy was nominated to and made the 2004, 2007, and 2010 Capital One All-American Mascot Team. In 2007 Goldy finished second to Zippy from the University of Akron.

==Goldy Gopher statue==

Due to the contributions from students, faculty, family, alumni, and friends, the University of Minnesota&#x27;s Student Union was able to fund the creation of an all bronze statue of Goldy the Gopher. This was a controversial issue for some in the university community because of the rising costs of tuition and the university&#x27;s concurrent appeals to the state legislature for a tuition freeze. The goal of the statue, located in the front of Coffman Memorial Union, was to promote school spirit and start new traditions. The University of Minnesota Administration hopes the iconic symbol will help students interact with the spirit and new traditions involving Goldy the Gopher. The statue is tall and made of bronze granite. Next to the statue is a solid granite &quot;M&quot; that is 63 inches in width, 24 Inches in depth, and 48 inches in height (160 x 61 x 122 cm). It was sculpted by Nicholas Legeros, who is a Minnesota graduate from the fine arts academy. He has sculpted many pieces for the Twin Cities Metro area. The total cost of the statue was $95,000.

On Monday, September 23, 2013, the Goldy statue was unveiled during the homecoming kickoff at noon - which happened to be Goldy Gopher&#x27;s birthday. Governor Mark Dayton declared this day Goldy Gopher Day to create a new tradition for the students. Supposedly if someone was to rub Goldy&#x27;s front teeth, it will bring them good luck.

<text>&quot;The Adventure of the Creeping Man&quot; (1923) is one of 12 Sherlock Holmes short stories by Arthur Conan Doyle collected in &quot;The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes&quot; (1927). The story was first published in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in the United Kingdom and &quot;Hearst&#x27;s International&quot; in the United States in March 1923. Watson states at the beginning of the story that this case was among the last that Holmes investigated before retiring to Sussex in 1903.

== Plot ==
A man named Trevor Bennett, the personal secretary of one Professor Presbury, comes to Holmes with a most unusual problem. He is engaged to the professor&#x27;s daughter, Edith, and the Professor is himself engaged to a young lady, Alice Morphy, although he himself is already 61 years of age. Their impending marriage has caused no scandal, but the trouble seems to have begun at about the time of the engagement. First, the professor suddenly left home for a fortnight without telling anyone of his destination, with the family later learning that he had been to Prague. Upon returning, Presbury unprecedentedly forbid Mr Bennett from opening certain stamped letters. The professor had also brought a carved wooden box from Prague, and became very angry with Bennett for touching it.

The whole household also observes severe changes in the man&#x27;s personality: he has become furtive and sly, with changes in his moods and habits, some of which are quite bizarre, though not impeding his functions. Bennett notes particularly strange incidents: one, in which he saw the professor crawling along the hall on his hands and feet and his master swore him off; and another, witnessed by Edith Presbury, who saw her father at two o&#x27;clock in the morning at her bedroom window on the second floor.

Further, the professor&#x27;s usually faithful Irish Wolfhound has started attacking him (Holmes notes this happens at 9 day intervals), and has to be chained up outside.

Holmes and Watson go to the university city of Camford to see the professor. They pretend that they have an appointment, but the professor sees through the ruse and becomes furiously angry at the intrusion. Bennett dissuades the professor from violence. Holmes and Watson leave with Holmes confiding to Watson that the visit has taught him that the professor&#x27;s mind is clear and functional despite recent behaviour. Bennett tells Holmes that he has found the address of the mysterious letters. The addressee is a man named Dorak, a Central European name, fitting with the professor&#x27;s secret journey to Prague. Holmes later finds out from Mercer, his &quot;general utility man&quot;, that Dorak is indeed an elderly Bohemian who keeps a large general store. Holmes examines Edith&#x27;s bedroom window, finding that the only way to climb up to it is using the creeper, unusual for a 61-year-old man.
Holmes forms a theory that every 9 days Professor Presbury takes some drug which causes the odd behaviour, having become addicted in Prague, and is supplied by Dorak in London. Holmes also comes to realise, by connecting the professor&#x27;s thick and horny knuckles, his odd behaviour, the dog&#x27;s attacks, and the use of the creeper, that the professor is behaving like a monkey.

Shortly after the realisation, Holmes and Watson are treated to a firsthand display of Professor Presbury&#x27;s odd behaviour. He comes out of the house, scampers about on all fours, climbs on the creeper, and torments the tied-up dog. Unfortunately, the wolfhound gets loose and attacks the professor. The two of them, with Mr. Bennett&#x27;s help, get the dog off the professor who is wounded badly. Watson and Bennett, also a medical man, tend to the professor&#x27;s injuries.

Holmes then examines the professor&#x27;s little wooden box after having obtained the key from the unconscious owner. It contained a drug, as Holmes expected, but also a letter from a man named Lowenstein, who Watson reveals to be a notorious quack. The professor had sought out Lowenstein&#x27;s rejuvenation treatments due to his upcoming marriage to a younger woman. The drug&#x27;s effects are explained as a consequence of being obtained from langurs. Promising to hold Lowenstein responsible, Holmes muses on the consequences of such drugs and departs with Watson.

== Commentaries ==
David Stuart Davies, who has written an afterword for the &quot;Case-Book&quot;, comments that this story &quot;veers towards risible science fiction&quot;. Indeed, there is something a bit less scientific in this story than is usually the case with Conan Doyle&#x27;s writing. This is one of four stories said to be forged &quot;drivel&quot; in Nicholas Meyer&#x27;s 1974 novel &quot;The Seven-Per-Cent Solution&quot;. (The other three are also from &quot;The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes&quot;.)

Ancient philosophy scholar Jonathan Barnes writes of encountering the story as a child and finding it &quot;one of the richest and most singular investigations of Holmes&#x27;s long career – an opinion which I have had no reason to change ... Revisited in adulthood, the story reveals itself as a sour parable about the endurance of lust, a lurid treatment of the question that is put to Falstaff as Doll Tearsheet fidgets on his knee: &#x27;Is it not strange that desire should so many years outlive performance?&#x27;. Yet, curiously, the feeling persists that there is something in the narrative – hidden, submerged – which the reader is not permitted to comprehend but which forms the source of its power.&quot;

== Publication history ==
&quot;The Adventure of the Creeping Man&quot; was published in the UK in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in March 1923, and in the US in &quot;Hearst&#x27;s International&quot; in the same month. The story was published with five illustrations by Howard K. Elcock in the &quot;Strand&quot;, and with seven illustrations by Frederic Dorr Steele in &quot;Hearst&#x27;s International&quot;. It was included in the short story collection &quot;The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, which was published in the UK and the US in June 1927.

== Adaptations ==
=== Radio and audio dramas ===
The story was adapted by Edith Meiser as an episode of the American radio series &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. The episode aired on 2 February 1931, with Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson.

Meiser also adapted the story for the American radio series &quot;The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; as an episode which aired on 27 November 1939 (as &quot;The Mystery of the Creeping Man&quot;). Another dramatisation of the story aired on 9 July 1943. Both episodes featured Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson. An adaptation of the story aired on 10 March 1947 with Tom Conway as Holmes and Bruce as Watson.

&quot;The Creeping Man&quot; was also dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 1994 by Robert Forrest as part of the 1989–1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson. It featured Robin Ellis as Professor Presbury and Annabel Mullion as Alice Murphy.

In 2010, the story was adapted for radio as an episode of &quot;The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, a series on the American radio show &quot;Imagination Theatre&quot;, with John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson.

In 2024, the podcast Sherlock&amp;Co adapted the story in a three-episodes adventure called &quot;The Creeping Man&quot;, starring Paul Waggot as Watson and Harry Attwell as Sherlock.

=== Television ===
The story was dramatised in 1991 in Granada TV&#x27;s &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;, starring Jeremy Brett as Holmes and Edward Hardwicke as Watson. The adaptation is relatively faithful to the plot, but includes a subplot involving Inspector Lestrade investigating the thefts of various primates from London&#x27;s zoos: these are later revealed by Holmes to be the sources from which the serum is obtained.

A 2001 episode of the animated television series &quot;Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century&quot; was adapted from the story.

== Sources ==
Lowenstein&#x27;s development of a &quot;rejuvenation serum&quot; derived from monkeys parallels actual treatments popularised in the early twentieth century, notably those of the Russian-born surgeon Serge Voronoff, who had experimented with injections of extracts from animal glands; in the 1920s, he popularised the transplantation into humans of tissue from monkey testicles.

<text>John Franklin Duncan (September 7, 1932 – July 15, 2000) was an American bluegrass and skiffle musician. He became popular in Britain in 1957 with &quot;Last Train to San Fernando&quot;, which reached number two in the UK Singles Chart.

==Biography==
Duncan was born in the Windrock coal-mining camp overlooking the town of Oliver Springs, Tennessee, United States. In his teens he moved to Texas where he learned guitar and mandolin, and played in a hillbilly trio. He served in the US Air Force, and in 1952 was garrisoned in Cambridgeshire, England, where he met and married a local girl, Betty, in 1953. When performing for American servicemen at Bushey, Hertfordshire, in 1956, he was seen by Dickie Bishop, banjoist in Chris Barber&#x27;s Dixieland jazz band. Barber was looking for a new vocalist to replace Lonnie Donegan, who had started a solo career, and Duncan took over the role for several months before leaving Barber&#x27;s band in early 1957.

Guided by record producer Denis Preston, Duncan then formed a new band, the Blue Grass Boys, with Donegan&#x27;s former guitarist Denny Wright together with drummer Lennie Hastings and bassist Jack Fallon. They began appearing regularly on a new BBC radio show, &quot;Saturday Skiffle Club&quot; (later &quot;Saturday Club&quot;). Their first recording was a commercially unsuccessful cover version of Hank Williams&#x27; &quot;Kaw-Liga&quot;. In 1957, their recording of a calypso called &quot;Last Train to San Fernando&quot; – originally co-written by Trinidadian musician Mighty Dictator (Kenneth St. Bernard) and recorded by The Duke of Iron, was personally disliked by Duncan. The track was arranged by Wright and Fallon, who gave the piece a strong &quot;country&quot; feel in the erroneous belief that San Fernando was in Texas or the Los Angeles, California suburb, rather than Trinidad, although Wright&#x27;s guitar solo has a strong Trinidadian feel to it.

Duncan briefly became a star in Britain, touring with Wee Willie Harris, Cliff Richard, and American singer Marvin Rainwater, and appearing regularly on BBC radio and the TV show &quot;Six-Five Special&quot;, produced by Jack Good. Duncan had two other entries in the UK Singles Chart in 1957, with &quot;Blue, Blue Heartaches&quot; (No. 27) and &quot;Footprints in the Snow&quot; (No. 22).

Although Duncan continued to record for a period of time, the skiffle fad faded and so did his success. Duncan lived in the United States in the 1960s, before returning to England where he recorded two albums in the 1970s. Following his divorce he emigrated to Australia, briefly returned to the United Kingdom, and then back to Australia where he married for a second time. He retired from the music industry and suffered from ill health, but made some further recordings in the 1990s after a revival of interest in his 1950s recordings.

He died of cancer in Australia, in 2000.

<text>Nico-Jos Theodoor Vaesen (born 28 September 1969) is a Belgian former footballer who played as a goalkeeper. He retired from football shortly after joining Lierse, but returned to the game in 2008 with K.F.C. Verbroedering Geel for one season where his contract wasn&#x27;t renewed.

==Career==
Born in Hasselt, Belgium, Vaesen spent his first professional season at Belgian sides Cercle Brugge and K.S.C. Eendracht Aalst, and on 21 May 1998 moved to English side Huddersfield Town. He was sent off on his debut, but went on to play 135 league games. During his first season for the club, he won the club&#x27;s Supporters&#x27; Player of the Year. After three years at Huddersfield, on 18 June 2001, he signed for Birmingham City.

He was given the first-choice goalkeeper role at Birmingham, helping the club win promotion to the Premier League via the play-offs in 2002. A memorable moment in the promotion season was saving a Gary Holt penalty in a 1–0 over Norwich City. Birmingham would go on to meet Norwich again in the play-off final and this time Vaesen saved from Philip Mulryne in the shootout. However a cruciate knee injury in March 2003 put him out of the game for nine months.
During this time Maik Taylor was brought in and established himself as first-choice goalkeeper. On Christmas Eve 2003, he was loaned to Gillingham for one and a half months, during which time he participated in five games. Spells at Bradford City and Crystal Palace, with whom he took part in another play-off final victory, followed in 2004. At the end of that season he signed a new two-year contract with Birmingham, intending to compete for a first-team place. He finally dislodged Taylor in late 2005, but a 4–1 defeat at Manchester City, in which he conceded a penalty and was later sent off, proved to be his last first-team appearance before he was released at the end of the 2005–06 season due to Birmingham&#x27;s relegation.

He then moved to Belgian side Lierse, but has since retired. In January 2008, he changed his mind and made a contract with K.F.C. Verbroedering Geel.

<text>Jonathan Stewart Vickers, (October 29, 1926 – July 10, 2015), known professionally as Jon Vickers, was a Canadian heldentenor.

Born in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, he was the sixth in a family of eight children. In 1950, he was awarded a scholarship to study opera at The Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto. In 1957 Vickers joined London’s Royal Opera House, Covent Garden company. In 1960 he joined the Metropolitan Opera. He became world-famous for a wide range of German, French, and Italian roles. Vickers&#x27; huge, powerful voice and solid technique met the demands of many French, German, and Italian roles. He was also highly regarded for his powerful stage presence and thoughtful characterizations. (Conversely, he was sometimes criticized for &quot;scooping&quot;—beginning a note below pitch and then sliding up to the correct pitch—and for &quot;crooning&quot;.)

In 1968 he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada. Vickers received the Governor General&#x27;s Performing Arts Award for Lifetime Artistic Achievement, Canada&#x27;s highest honour in the performing arts, in 1998.

==Career==
Vickers studied with George Lambert at The Royal Conservatory of Music and sang professionally in Canada from the early- to mid-1950s. In 1952 he won the &quot;Nos futures étoiles&quot; competition on CBC Radio. His international career began with his 1957 Covent Garden Riccardo in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot;. He continued to appear there into the 1980s, putting his personal stamp on the roles of Énée in Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;Les Troyens&quot;, Radamès in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Aida&quot; and the title role in his &quot;Don Carlos&quot;, Handel&#x27;s &quot;Samson&quot;, Florestan in Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Fidelio&quot;, Tristan in Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;, Canio in Leoncavallo&#x27;s &quot;Pagliacci&quot;, and the title role in Britten&#x27;s &quot;Peter Grimes&quot;. Some critics praised Vickers&#x27; Tristan as the best since Lauritz Melchior&#x27;s.

He debuted at the Bayreuth Festival in 1958 as Siegmund in &quot;Die Walküre&quot; and sang &quot;Parsifal&quot; there in 1964. Later negotiations with Wieland Wagner concerning appearances as Siegfried in &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot; ceased on Wieland&#x27;s death in 1966. His debut role at the Metropolitan Opera in 1960 was Canio in &quot;Pagliacci&quot;. He appeared at the Met for a period of 27 years in 280 performances of 17 roles, including Florestan in &quot;Fidelio&quot;, Siegmund in Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Die Walküre&quot;, Don Jose in Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot;, Radamès in &quot;Aida&quot;, Erik in Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Der fliegende Holländer&quot;, Herman in Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Queen of Spades&quot;, Samson in both Handel&#x27;s oratorio and Saint-Saëns&#x27; &quot;Samson et Dalila&quot;, the title role of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Otello&quot;, Don Alvaro in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;La forza del destino&quot;, &quot;Peter Grimes&quot;, &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;, Laca in Janáček&#x27;s &quot;Jenůfa&quot;, Vasek in Smetana&#x27;s &quot;The Bartered Bride&quot;, and the title role in Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Parsifal&quot;, giving his farewell in 1987.

Among Vickers&#x27; more notable recordings were &quot;Die Walküre&quot; in 1966 and &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; in 1972, both with Herbert von Karajan (Vickers became one of Karajan&#x27;s favourite singers at the lavish Salzburg Easter and Summer Festivals in &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot;, &quot;Carmen&quot;, &quot;Otello&quot;, &quot;Fidelio&quot; as well as &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;), &quot;Les Troyens&quot;, singing the part of Énée (Aeneas), with Sir Colin Davis in 1969, and a legendary and controversial 1959 recording of Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot; with Sir Thomas Beecham.

Although scheduled to sing Tannhäuser at Covent Garden in the late 1970s, Vickers dropped out, claiming he could not empathize with the character, and that the opera itself was blasphemous in nature. He sang Nerone in Monteverdi&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;incoronazione di Poppea&quot; at the Paris Opéra, and Alvaro in &quot;La forza del destino&quot; at the Met (1975). His roles also included Don Carlos, Andrea Chenier, Herod in &quot;Salome&quot;, Giasone in &quot;Medea&quot; (with Maria Callas in the title role), Pollione in &quot;Norma&quot; and rarely heard parts such as Cellini in Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;Benvenuto Cellini&quot;, Ratan-Sen in Roussel&#x27;s &quot;Padmavati&quot; and Sergei in Shostakovitch&#x27;s &quot;Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District&quot;. Many critics praised his interpretation of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Otello&quot;, which he recorded twice: in 1960 with Tullio Serafin and 1973 with Herbert von Karajan. Vickers also was a long time collaborator with American pianist Richard Woitach.

Vickers further sang at the &#x27;home&#x27; of Italian opera, Milan&#x27;s La Scala, as well as in the major opera houses of Chicago, San Francisco, Vienna, and at the Salzburg Festival. He retired in 1988.

==Personal life and death==
Vickers was born into the musical family of William, a teacher and school principal, and Myrle (née Mossop). As a youth he sang in his father&#x27;s church, and his initial intention was to study medicine. He worked on a neighbour&#x27;s farm and acquired the muscular stature that characterized him. During a semi-professional production his leading lady made a recording of his voice and sent it to The Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto. He auditioned there with Every Valley Shall be Exalted and was offered a scholarship.

In 1953 he married Henrietta (Hetti) Outerbridge. They had five children. After her death in 1991, he married Judith Stewart. Vickers died of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease on July 10, 2015, in Ontario.

==Religion==
He was a dedicated, outspoken Protestant; one writer referred to him as &quot;God&#x27;s tenor&quot; for this reason.

<text>&quot;The Adventure of the Veiled Lodger&quot; (1927), one of the 56 Sherlock Holmes short stories written by British author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is one of 12 stories in the cycle collected as &quot;The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes&quot;.

== Plot ==
Holmes is visited by Mrs Merrilow, a landlady from South Brixton who has an unusual lodger who never shows her face. She saw it once accidentally and it was hideously mutilated. This woman, formerly very quiet, has recently taken to cursing in the night, shouting &quot;Murder, murder!&quot; and &quot;You cruel beast! You monster!&quot; Also, her health has taken a turn for the worse, and she is wasting away. Mrs Merrilow has brought this case to Holmes&#x27;s attention as her tenant, Mrs Ronder, will not involve the clergy or the police in something that she would like to say. She has told her landlady to mention Abbas Parva, knowing that Holmes would understand the reference.

Indeed he does. It was a most tragic case in which a circus lion somehow got loose and savaged two people, one of whom was killed, and the other badly disfigured. The latter is apparently this lodger – the former was her husband. Holmes could make little of the case at the time, but perhaps if someone had actually hired him, the outcome would have been different. As it was, the inquest ruled that Mr Ronder was the victim of death by misadventure. Still, even the local police were a bit disturbed at the time by

some seeming inconsistencies in the accounts. For example, the lion was part of an act which Mr and Mrs Ronder performed right in its cage, and they were the ones who fed it. Why had it suddenly turned on its feeders? Why had it not tried to escape? Who was this man that several people heard screaming when supposedly Mr Ronder had already been killed?

Upon arriving at Brixton, Holmes and Watson are shown into Mrs Ronder&#x27;s room, which she seldom leaves. She is wearing her veil. Her purpose, it seems, is to make a clean breast of the matter before she dies. She tells Holmes and Watson that Mr Ronder was a terrible husband, cruel and violent in the extreme, even to the circus animals, but he didn&#x27;t care, even though he wound up in the dock for it several times. He was very rich and the fines meant nothing.

The circus strongman, Leonardo, was Mrs Ronder&#x27;s lover. He was always very supportive and encouraging to her, who, in turn, felt that Leonardo was the only man her husband feared. Eventually, Mrs Ronder and Leonardo realized that Mr Ronder was not fit to live, and formed a plan to kill him. As part of the plan, Leonardo made a club with five nails in it, which could deliver wounds that might be mistaken for those of a lion&#x27;s paw. Then, one night at Abbas Parva, a small village in Berkshire where the circus was camped for the night, Mrs Ronder and Leonardo carried out their plan. When Mrs Ronder and her husband went to the lion&#x27;s cage to feed it, Leonardo crept up behind them and smashed Mr Ronder&#x27;s head with the club, and Mrs Ronder released the lion to make it appear that it had broken free and done the deed. But the lion, having been driven into a feeding frenzy by the scent of Mr Ronder&#x27;s blood, turned and pounced on Mrs Ronder instead, badly chewing her face up in the process. At the sight of this, Leonardo started screaming and ran to get help from the other circus members. He could have saved his lover himself by using the club on the lion, but he was too cowardly.

Mrs Ronder could not bring herself to implicate Leonardo in her husband&#x27;s murder at the inquest, and is only now telling Holmes and Watson this story because she believes that she will soon die. She never saw or heard of Leonardo again, and later learned that he had drowned. Ever since the night of the incident, she has lived alone and veiled. Holmes can only offer advice in this situation; realising that Mrs Ronder is contemplating suicide, he reminds her that her life is worth something as an example of patient suffering in an impatient world. She responds to this by lifting her veil, and the sight is ghastly.

Nevertheless, Holmes receives a bottle of prussic acid from Mrs Ronder a day after.She was going to use it to kill herself, but upon considering what Holmes told her, she apparently thought better of it.

Meiser also adapted the story as episodes of the American radio series &quot;The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; that aired on 15 February 1942 (with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson) and 20 June 1948 (with John Stanley as Holmes and Alfred Shirley as Watson).

&quot;The Veiled Lodger&quot; was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 1994 by Roger Danes as part of the 1989–1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson. It featured Harriet Walter as Eugenia Ronder and Douglas Henshall as Leonardo.

In 2006, the story was adapted for radio as an episode of &quot;The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, a series on the American radio show &quot;Imagination Theatre&quot;, with John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson.

In 2025, the podcast &quot;Sherlock &amp; Co.&quot; adapted the story in a two-episodes adventure called &quot;The Veiled Lodger&quot;, starring Paul Waggot as Watson and Harry Attwell as Sherlock.

===Television===
The 1993 episode &quot;The Eligible Bachelor&quot; of the Grenada Television &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; series with Jeremy Brett as Holmes integrates the narrative device, borrowed from this story, of Holmes being contacted by a veiled woman mauled by a leopard, but changes the names, characters, and situation to make it a sub-element of a main plot based on &quot;The Adventure of the Noble Bachelor&quot;.

<text>&quot;The Adventure of Shoscombe Old Place&quot; is the last of the 56 Sherlock Holmes short stories by Arthur Conan Doyle. The story is part of the short story collection &quot;The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. It was first published in the US in &quot;Liberty&quot; in March 1927. It was published in the UK in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in April 1927. The original title &quot;The Adventure of the Black Spaniel&quot; was changed before publication.

==Plot==
Head trainer John Mason from Shoscombe Old Place, a racing stable in Berkshire, comes to Sherlock Holmes about his master, Sir Robert Norberton, Baronet. Mason thinks he has gone mad. Sir Robert&#x27;s sister, Lady Beatrice Falder, owns Shoscombe, but it will revert to her late husband&#x27;s brother when she dies. The stable has a horse, Shoscombe Prince, who Sir Robert hopes will win the Derby. He would be out of debt if that actually happened.

Mason is not quite sure what he wants Holmes to investigate, but a number of odd changes have happened at the stable:

*Why has Lady Beatrice suddenly forgone her usual habit of stopping to greet her favourite horse? Why does she just ride on by in her carriage?
*Why has Sir Robert become so wild-eyed lately?
*Why has he given his sister&#x27;s dog away to a neighbourhood innkeeper?
*Why does he go to the old crypt at night, and who is that man whom he meets there?
*Why have burnt human bones been found in the furnace at Shoscombe?

Holmes decides to investigate on the spot. He and Dr. Watson go to Berkshire posing as anglers and learn some interesting things. The keeper of the inn where they are staying is the one who now has Lady Beatrice&#x27;s dog, and it is quite an expensive breed, one that an innkeeper ordinarily could never afford.

With the innkeeper&#x27;s permission, Holmes takes the dog for a walk, and goes to Shoscombe, where he releases it as Lady Beatrice&#x27;s carriage comes out of the gate. The dog dashes forward enthusiastically at first, but then flees in terror. Then, even though a maid and Lady Beatrice are supposedly the only two people in the carriage, it is a male voice that yells &quot;Drive on!&quot;

Then there is the crypt. John Mason observes that a heap of bones there earlier is now gone. Holmes finds a coffin with a fresh, swathed body in it. Just then, Sir Robert arrives, catching Holmes and Watson in the act. After Holmes makes it plain that he has deduced most of the odd goings-on, Sir Robert invites him and Watson back to the house and explains everything.

About a week earlier, Lady Beatrice died of dropsy, and Sir Robert felt compelled to keep the fact secret so that the creditors would not swoop down on Shoscombe before he had a chance to win the Derby and pay off all his debts. Sir Robert and the maid&#x27;s husband transported his deceased sister to the crypt and hid the body in the coffin, but also found that they had to dispose of the coffin&#x27;s original body—in the furnace. The maid&#x27;s husband also dressed up in Lady Beatrice&#x27;s clothes and took her place in the carriage each day. The dog knew what had happened and might have given the game away if its barking protests had aroused suspicion, which is why Sir Robert had given away the dog to the innkeeper.

Holmes refers the matter to the police, but the story ends happily. Shoscombe Prince wins the Derby, Sir Robert escapes any major judicial penalty for what he did to his sister&#x27;s body, and he pays off all his debts with a great deal left over.

==Publication history==
&quot;The Adventure of Shoscombe Old Place&quot; was published in the US in &quot;Liberty&quot; in March 1927, and in the UK in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in April 1927. The story was published with seven illustrations by Frederic Dorr Steele in &quot;Liberty&quot;, and with five illustrations by Frank Wiles in the &quot;Strand&quot;. It was included in the short story collection &quot;The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, which was published in the UK and the US in June 1927.

==Adaptations==
===Radio and audio dramas===
The story was dramatised by Edith Meiser in 1931 as part of the American radio series &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. It aired on 30 March 1931 with Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson.

Other dramatisations of the story, also adapted by Meiser, aired on the American radio series &quot;The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; on 9 March 1941 (with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson) and 15 February 1948 (with John Stanley as Holmes and Alfred Shirley as Watson).

A radio adaptation of the story aired in 1959 on the BBC Light Programme, as part of the 1952–1969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Sherlock Holmes and Norman Shelley as Dr. Watson. It was adapted by Michael Hardwick, and featured Frederick Treves as John Mason and Ronald Baddiley as Josiah Barnes.

An audio drama based on the story was released on one side of a 1971 LP record in a series of recordings starring Robert Hardy as Holmes and Nigel Stock as Watson. It was dramatised and produced by Michael Hardwick (who adapted the 1959 BBC radio version of the same story) and Mollie Hardwick.

It featured Nicholas Le Prevost as John Mason, Donald Pickering as Sir Robert, and Desmond Llewelyn as Palfreyman.

In 2006, the story was adapted for radio by M. J. Elliott as an episode of &quot;The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, a series on the American radio show &quot;Imagination Theatre&quot;, with John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson.

In 2024, the podcast Sherlock&amp;Co adapted the story in a three-episodes adventure called &quot;Shoscombe Old Place&quot;, starring Paul Waggot as Watson and Harry Attwell as Sherlock.

===Television===
The story was adapted for the 1968 BBC series with Peter Cushing. The episode is now lost.

The story was also dramatised in 1991 in Granada TV&#x27;s &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;, starring Jeremy Brett. Jude Law, who later played Dr. Watson in the 2009 film &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;, plays Joe Barnes, the young man who impersonates Lady Beatrice.

<text>&quot;The Adventure of the Retired Colourman&quot; (1926), one of the 56 Sherlock Holmes short stories written by British author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is one of 12 stories in the cycle collected as &quot;The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes&quot;.

==Plot==
Sherlock Holmes is hired by a retired art supply dealer from Lewisham, Josiah Amberley, to look into his young wife&#x27;s disappearance. She has left with a neighbour, Dr Ray Ernest, taking a sizeable quantity of cash and securities. Amberley wants the two tracked down.

Holmes is too busy with another case at the moment, so he sends Dr Watson to Lewisham to observe what he can, although Watson is keenly aware that this is more Holmes&#x27;s province. He does his best, observing that Amberley is busy painting his house, which seems a bit odd. He even sees Amberley&#x27;s wife&#x27;s unused theatre ticket; she and her young man disappeared while Amberley went to the theatre alone after his wife complained of a headache. Watson notes the seat number.

Watson also sees Amberley&#x27;s strongroom from which his wife had taken the valuables. She, apparently, had a key of her own. He meets a lounger with a rather military appearance in the street, and later observes him running to catch the train at Blackheath Station as he is returning to 221B Baker Street. Holmes recognises the description; it is his rival in detection, Barker. It later turns out that Ray Ernest&#x27;s family has hired him to find the missing doctor.

A number of other things about Amberley are obvious. He is a miser, and as such is quite a jealous man. He is an avid chess player (indeed, so is Ernest, which is how they became acquainted), suggesting to Holmes that he also has a scheming mind.

Holmes suspects something, and so sends Watson and Amberley on a fool&#x27;s errand to the remote village of Little Purlington, near Frinton in Essex, just to keep Amberley out of the way while Holmes breaks into his house to investigate it. He is &quot;caught&quot; by Barker, but they decide to work together.

They reach a conclusion, and later Holmes confronts Amberley with the dramatic question &quot;What did you do with the bodies?&quot; Holmes manhandles Amberley just in time to stop him taking a poison pill. Amberley is obviously guilty.

Holmes explains how he reached his conclusion. Amberley&#x27;s alibi fell apart when Holmes discovered that his seat at the Haymarket Theatre had not been occupied on the night in question, its number deduced from the ticket that Watson had seen. Also, the painting was a clue. Holmes realised that it was being done to mask a smell, and he soon discovered what that was: gas. He found a gas pipe leading into the strongroom with a tap outside. Amberley had lured his wife and her lover—for so he had believed Dr Ernest to be—into the strongroom, locked them in, and turned the gas on, killing them out of jealousy. He had simply hidden the &quot;stolen&quot; valuables somewhere. In indelible pencil, one of the victims wrote &quot;We we…&quot;, perhaps meaning to write &quot;We were murdered.&quot; Amberley apparently had not noticed this, and hired Holmes out of &quot;pure swank&quot;, believing that no-one would ever find him out.

The bodies are found in a disused well in the garden, hidden under a dog kennel, just where Holmes suggested that the police look. Holmes believes that Amberley will likely end up at Broadmoor rather than on the scaffold, owing to his mental state.

==Publication history==
&quot;The Adventure of the Retired Colourman&quot; was first published in the US in &quot;Liberty&quot; in December 1926. It was published in the UK in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in January 1927. The story was published with four illustrations by Frederic Dorr Steele in &quot;Liberty&quot;, and with five illustrations by Frank Wiles in the &quot;Strand&quot;. It was included in &quot;The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes&quot;.

==Adaptations==
===Radio and audio dramas===
The story was adapted by Edith Meiser in 1931 as an episode of the American radio series &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. It aired on 6 April 1931, with Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr Watson.

Meiser was also a writer for the American radio series &quot;The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, which aired two episodes based on the story, on 11 March 1940 and 3 September 1943 respectively. Basil Rathbone played Holmes and Nigel Bruce played Watson.

A radio adaptation by Michael Hardwick of &quot;The Retired Colourman&quot; aired in 1964 on the BBC Light Programme, as part of the 1952–1969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Sherlock Holmes and Norman Shelley as Dr Watson.

&quot;The Retired Colourman&quot; was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 1994 by Bert Coules as part of the 1989–1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson. It featured Stephen Thorne as Inspector Lestrade, George Cole as Josiah Amberley, and Natasha Pyne as Mrs Amberley. In this version, Holmes is implied to have retired and left Baker Street unceremoniously immediately afterwards, feeling that he has lost a step and that it is &quot;time for the country, and for solitude, and for thought, and for my bees.&quot;

In 2009, the story was adapted for radio by M J Elliott as an episode of &quot;The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, a series on the American radio show &quot;Imagination Theatre&quot;, with John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson.

In 2024, the podcast Sherlock&amp;Co adapted the story in a two-episodes adventure called &quot;The retired Colourman&quot;, starring Paul Waggot as Watson and Harry Attwell as Sherlock.

===Television===
The story was adapted as an episode of the 1965 BBC television series &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; starring Douglas Wilmer as Holmes, Nigel Stock as Watson and Maurice Denham as Josiah Amberley. The only difference is that Inspector Mackinnon is replaced by Inspector Lestrade (Peter Madden).

<doc id="1338245" wikidata="Q435853" url="?curid=1338245" title="Thomas Cajetan">
<text>Thomas Cajetan (; 20 February 14699 August 1534), also known as Gaetanus, commonly Tommaso de Vioor Thomas de Vio, was an Italian philosopher, theologian, the Master of the Order of Preachers 1508 to 1518, and cardinal from 1517 until his death. He was a leading theologian of his day who is now best known as the spokesman for Catholic opposition to the teachings of Martin Luther and the Protestant Reformation while he was the Pope&#x27;s legate in Augsburg, and among Catholics for his extensive commentary on the &quot;Summa Theologica&quot; of Thomas Aquinas.

He is not to be confused with his contemporary Saint Cajetan, the founder of the Theatines.

==Life==
He was born in Gaeta, then part of the Kingdom of Naples, as Jacopo Vio. The name Tommaso was taken as his religious as a friar, while the surname Cajetan derives from his native city. At the age of fifteen, he entered the Dominican order and devoted himself to the study of the philosophy of St. Thomas Aquinas, becoming before the age of thirty a doctor of theology at Padua, and subsequently professor of metaphysics. A public disputation at Ferrara (1494) with Pico della Mirandola made his reputation as a theologian.

He became general procurator in 1507 and general of the Dominicans a year later in 1508.

In 1511 a group of dissident cardinals called the Conciliabulum of Pisa (1511–1512) against Pope Julius II, who had ignored the electoral capitulations he had accepted before being elected. Cajetan displayed vigorous support for the papacy in a series of publications. These were condemned by the Sorbonne and publicly burnt by order of King Louis XII.

At the Fifth Lateran Council (1512–17) which Pope Julius II set up in opposition to that of Pisa, De Vio played the leading role. During the second session of the council, in which he gave the opening oration, he obtained the approval of a decree recognizing the superiority of papal authority to that of councils.

Cajetan composed in defence of his position the &quot;Tractatus de Comparatione auctoritatis Papæ et conciliorum ad invicem&quot;. Jacques Almain answered this work, and Cajetan replied in his &quot;Apologia&quot;. Cajetan refused to accept Almain&#x27;s argument that the Church&#x27;s polity had to be similar to a lay regime, complete with limits on the ruler.

For his support of papal rights, Cajetan was made Bishop of Gaeta, and in 1517 would be made a cardinal and archbishop of Palermo by Pope Leo X.

In 1517, Leo X made him cardinal presbyter of San Sisto in Rome for his services. In the following year, he became Archbishop of Palermo. He resigned Palermo in 1519 to become Bishop of Gaeta, as granted him by the Emperor Charles V for whose election De Vio had laboured zealously. 
In 1518, Cajetan was sent as legate to the Diet of Augsburg and at the behest of the Frederick III, Elector of Saxony was entrusted with examining the teachings of Martin Luther. According to Hilaire Belloc, &quot;[Luther] had not been treated roughly by his opponents, the roughness had been on his side. But things had gone against him, and he had been made to look foolish; he had been cross-examined into denying, for instance, the authority of a General Council — which authority was the trump card to play against the Papacy.&quot;

In 1519, Cajetan helped in drawing up the bill of excommunication against Luther.

Having proved to be an able diplomat and administrator, Cajetan was employed in several other negotiations and transactions. In conjunction with Cardinal Giulio de&#x27; Medici in the conclave of 1521–1522, he secured the election of Adrian Boeyens, then Bishop of Tortosa, as Pope Adrian VI. He retained influence under Pope Clement VII, suffered a short term of imprisonment after the storming of Rome by the Constable of Bourbon and by Frundsberg (1527), retired to his diocese for a few years, and, returning to Rome in 1530, assumed his old position of influence with Pope Clement, on whose behalf he drafted the decision rejecting the petition made by Henry VIII of England for the annulment of his marriage to Catharine of Aragon. Appointed by Clement VII to the commission of cardinals assigned to report on the &quot;Nuremberg Recess&quot;, De Vio, in opposition to the majority, recommended certain concessions to the Lutherans, notably the marriage of the clergy as in the Greek Church and communion in both kinds according to the decision of the Council of Basel.

Cajetan died on August 9th in Rome in 1534.

==Views==
=== Religion and Philosophy ===
As a philosopher and logician, Cajetan defended the idea of analogy.

Though as a theologian Cajetan was a scholastic of the older Thomist type, his general position was that of the moderate reformers of the school to which Reginald Pole, later archbishop of Canterbury, also belonged; i.e.,  he desired to retain the best elements of the humanist revival in harmony with Catholic orthodoxy illumined by a revived appreciation of the Augustinian doctrine of justification. In the field of Thomistic philosophy, he showed striking independence of judgment, expressing liberal views on marriage and divorce, denying the existence of a material Hell and advocating the celebration of public prayers in the vernacular.

Some Dominicans regarded his views as too independent of those of Saint Thomas. The Sorbonne in Paris found some of these views heterodox, and in the 1570 edition of his celebrated commentary on Aquinas&#x27; &quot;Summa&quot;, the objectionable passages were expunged. In this spirit, he wrote commentaries upon portions of Aristotle and upon the &quot;Summa&quot; of Aquinas, and towards the end of his life made a careful translation of the Old and New Testaments, excepting Solomon&#x27;s Song, the Prophets and the Revelation of St John. Cajetan also wrote opinions on subjects of practical importance, such as the disposition of plundered goods whose ownership could not be determined.

Of the Reformation he remained a steadfast opponent, composing several works directed against Martin Luther, and taking an important part in shaping the policy of the papal delegates in Germany. Learned though he was in the scholastics, he recognized that to fight the reformers he would need a deeper knowledge of the Scriptures than he possessed. To this study he devoted himself with characteristic zeal, wrote commentaries on the greater part of the Old and the New Testament, and in the exposition of his text, which he treated critically, allowed himself considerable latitude in departing from literal and traditional interpretations.

Cajetan was a man of austere piety and fervent zeal. And from the standpoint of the Dominican idea of the supreme necessity of maintaining ecclesiastical discipline, he defended the rights of the papacy and proclaimed that the pope should be &quot;the mirror of God on earth.&quot;

===Views on papal authority===
Against the Council of Pisa&#x27;s advocacy of conciliarism, which placed the authority of a general council above the pope&#x27;s authority, Cajetan responded that a general council could only judge a pope if the pope had become a heretic. In the case of a wicked but non-heretical pope, Cajetan insisted that resistance is sufficient to reduce abuses, while deposition is inadmissible as a council convened without a pope would be &quot;headless&quot; (using the scriptural analogy of the relationship between sheep and their shepherd). In the case of heresy, however, Cajetan wrote that an exceptional general council could be convened to grant the reigning pope a fair hearing, and if he was judged to be in heresy, the council could act to sever the bond between the man holding the papacy and the office itself. However, he denied that this action constituted the council acting over the pope, which he regarded as theologically impossible. Rather, he considered that such an action merely indicated that the council could undo the election of that particular man to the office of the pope (since the election was also performed by human beings). Cajetan, building on similar discussions from John of Paris and Augustinus Triumphus regarding the removal of heretical popes, interpreted Titus 3:10 as saying that a heretical pope should be deposed after two admonitions.

=== Economic thoughts ===

In light of the contemporary economic development, Cajetan cogitated a lot about the morality of trade. More conservative than the future School of Salamanca, his reflections were nonetheless quite modern with utilisation of practical consideration outside of pure theorical thinking and some relevant ideas, like the formulation of the liquidity preference.

However his views on usury were still conservative, as showed by his condemnation of mounts of piety (that he tried unsuccessfully to ban during the Fifth Council of the Lateran), his disapproval of usury or his prohibition of &quot;contractum trinius&quot;.

==Modern assessment==
===On Aquinas===
In the mid-twentieth century, Cajetan&#x27;s thought came to be assessed negatively by certain Catholic commentators who, in reacting against neo-Thomist thought, portrayed Cajetan as the first person to make mistaken interpretations of the thought of Thomas Aquinas.

Fergus Kerr wrote a 2002 book, &quot;After Aquinas&quot;, attacking Cajetan on this. Among others, he cited Étienne Gilson, who was responding to arguments that &#x27;philosophy&#x27; and &#x27;Christianity&#x27; were incompatible disciplines, there existed in Hellenistic Judaism, patristic thought and the medieval period a way of thinking, animated by the ancient Greek quest for the cause of being, which could rightly be called &#x27;Christian philosophy&#x27;. In Gilson&#x27;s account, it was in Cajetan&#x27;s thought that this link was first broken, since Cajetan, influenced by Scotism, reduced Thomas Aquinas&#x27;s metaphysics of the existential act of being to an ontology of substance. Cajetan and his successors therefore, in Gilson&#x27;s account, represented Thomas as focused on the forms and essences of beings only, and not on the existence of all things as participation in the pure actuality which is God. Accordingly, for Gilson, &#x27;philosophy&#x27; and &#x27;Christianity&#x27; are only incompatible if Christian thought is understood in its tradition post-Cajetan—a tradition which is worse than the older, more distinguished tradition of Christian thought. Henri de Lubac wrote in &quot;Surnaturel&quot; (1946), an account of Aquinas’ views on the natural and the supernatural, that Cajetan&#x27;s interpretation of Aquinas, while influential, was incorrect. De Lubac argued that Cajetan treated Aquinas as an Aristotelian, working with a definition of nature from Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Physics&quot;, which effectively turned human nature into a reality essentially closed in on itself, with its own intrinsic powers, desires and goals. De Lubac did not think Aquinas was an Aristolean, and that subsequent Catholic thought produced mistaken readings of Thomas Aquinas&#x27;s account of the relationship between nature and grace.

In 2006, Ralph McInerny and other scholars challenged the negative assessment of Cajetan&#x27;s work made by De Lubac and Gilson. McInerny writes that the criticisms of Cajetan are not in fact supported by evidence from his works, and furthermore that it is not Cajetan but Gilson whose interpretation of Aquinas is a departure from the latter&#x27;s beliefs. 

===Other===
Bruce Metzger wrote that Cajetan&#x27;s biblical commentaries were surprisingly &quot;modern&quot;, anticipating biblical textual criticism. Notably, Cajetan revived earlier Christian doubts as to the apostolic authorship of the Epistles of James, Jude, 2 John, and 3 John, as well as opposing Pauline authorship of the Epistle to the Hebrews.

<text>The Andamanese are the various indigenous peoples of the Andaman Islands, part of India&#x27;s Andaman and Nicobar Islands, the union territory in the southeastern part of the Bay of Bengal. The Andamanese are a designated Scheduled Tribe in India&#x27;s constitution. 
The Andamanese peoples are among the various groups considered Negrito, owing to their dark skin and diminutive stature. All Andamanese traditionally lived a hunter-gatherer lifestyle, and appear to have lived in substantial isolation for thousands of years. It is suggested that the Andamanese settled in the Andaman Islands around the latest glacial maximum, around 26,000 years ago.

The Andamanese peoples included the Great Andamanese and Jarawas of the Great Andaman archipelago, the Jangil of Rutland Island, the Onge of Little Andaman, and the Sentinelese of North Sentinel Island. Among the Andamanese, a division of two groups can be made. One is more open to contact with civilization and the other is hostile and resistant to communicate with the outer world.

At the end of the 18th century, when they first came into sustained contact with outsiders, an estimated 7,000 Andamanese remained. In the next century, they experienced a massive population decline due to epidemics of outside diseases and loss of territory. Today, only roughly over 500 Andamanese remain, with the Jangil being extinct. Only the Jarawa and the Sentinelese maintain a steadfast independence, refusing most attempts at contact by outsiders.

==History==

Until the late 18th century, the Andamanese culture, language, and genetics were preserved from outside influences by their fierce reaction to visitors, which included killing any shipwrecked foreigners, and by the remoteness of the islands. The various tribes and their mutually unintelligible languages thus are believed to have evolved on their own over millennia.

Venetian explorer Marco Polo wrote of the Andamanese in 1294, in &quot;The Travels of Marco Polo:&quot;
===Origins===

The oldest archaeological evidence for the habitation of the islands dates to the 1st millennium BC. Genetic evidence suggests that the indigenous Andamanese peoples share a common origin, and that the islands were settled sometime after 26,000 years ago, possibly at the end of the Last Glacial Period, when sea levels were much lower reducing the distance between the Andaman Islands and the Asian mainland, with genetic estimates suggesting that the two main linguistic groups (Great Andamanese and Onge/Jarawa) diverged around 16,000 years ago.

It was previously assumed that the Andaman ancestors were part of the initial Great Coastal Migration (South-Eurasians or Australasians) that was the first expansion of humanity out of Africa, via the Arabian peninsula, along the coastal regions of the South Asia towards Insular Southeast Asia, and Oceania. The Andamanese were considered to be a pristine example of a hypothesized Negrito population, which showed similar physical characteristics, and was supposed to have existed throughout southeast Asia. The existence of a specific Negrito-population is nowadays doubted. Their commonalities could be the result of evolutionary convergence and/or a shared history. Recent genetic studies conclusively demonstrate Negrito groups do not share a common origin to the exclusion of other Asians.

===Colonial era===
The Andamanese&#x27;s protective isolation changed with the establishment of a British colonial presence on the islands. Lacking immunity against common infectious diseases of the Eurasian mainland, the large Jarawa habitats on the southeastern regions of South Andaman Island experienced a massive population decline due to disease within four years of the establishment of a colonial presence on the island in 1789. Epidemics of pneumonia, measles and influenza spread rapidly and exacted heavy tolls, as did alcoholism. In the 19th century, a measles epidemic killed 50% of the Andamanese population. By 1875, the Andamanese were already &quot;perilously close to extinction&quot;. In 1888, the British government set in place a policy of &quot;organized gift giving&quot; that continued in varying forms until the islands, as part of the British Raj, gained independence from the British Empire.

Tensions between the colonial administration and the Andamanese increased due to British officials introducing alcohol and opium to the Andamanese. During mid-19th century, the British government in India established penal colonies on the islands and an increasing number of Indian and Karen arrived, both as settlers and prisoners.

In 1867, the British launched the Andaman Islands expedition in order to rescue shipwrecked sailors from the &quot;Assam Valley&quot; on the Andamanese islands. The expedition was attacked by the Onge people upon their approach to the islands and were forced to withdraw. Four Victoria Crosses were awarded to members of the expedition.

In 1923, the British ornithologist and anthropologist Frank Finn, who visited the islands in the 1890s while working for the Indian Museum, described the Andamanese as &quot;The World&#x27;s Most Primitive People&quot;, writing:

In the 1940s, the Jarawa were attacked by imperial Japanese forces for their hostility. This Japanese attack was criticized as a war crime by many observers.

===Recent history===
In 1974, a film crew and anthropologist Triloknath Pandit attempted friendly contact by leaving a tethered pig, some pots and pans, some fruit, and toys on the beach at North Sentinel Island. One of the islanders shot the film director in the thigh with an arrow. The following year, European visitors were repulsed with arrows.

On 2 August 1981, the Hong Kong freighter ship &quot;Primrose&quot; grounded on the North Sentinel Island reef. A few days later, crewmen on the immobile vessel observed that small black men were carrying spears and arrows and building boats on the beach. The captain of the Primrose radioed for an urgent airdrop of firearms so the crew could defend themselves, but did not receive them. Heavy seas kept the islanders away from the ship. After a week, the crew were rescued by an Indian navy helicopter.

On 4 January 1991, Triloknath Pandit made the first known friendly contact with the Sentinelese.

Until 1996, the Jarawa met most visitors with flying arrows. From time to time, they attacked and killed poachers on the lands reserved to them by the Indian government. They also killed some workers building the Andaman Trunk Road (ATR), which traverses Jarawa lands. One of the earliest peaceful contacts with the Jarawa occurred in 1996. Settlers found a teenaged Jarawa boy named Enmei near Kadamtala town. The boy was immobilized with a broken foot. They took Enmei to a hospital, where he received good care. Over several weeks, Enmei learned a few words of Hindi before returning to his jungle home. The following year, Jarawa individuals and small groups began appearing along roadsides and occasionally venturing into settlements to steal food. The ATR may have interfered with traditional Jarawa food sources.

On 17 November 2018, a United States missionary, John Allen Chau, was killed when he tried to introduce Christianity to the Sentinelese tribe. The Sentinelese have been protected from contact with the outside world. Trips to the Island are prohibited by Indian law. Chau was brought near the island by local fishermen, who were later arrested during the investigation into his death. Indian authorities attempted to retrieve Chau&#x27;s remains without success.

==Tribes==

The four major groups of Andamanese are:

* Jarawa: 380 individuals as of the 2011 Indian census. They live in the ex-Great Andamanese homeland in the West Coast and central parts of South and Middle Andaman Islands. 
* Onge: 101 individuals as of the 2011 Indian census. They live on Little Andaman.
* Great Andamanese: 52 individuals in 2010. The tribal and linguistic distinctions have largely disappeared, many Great Andamanese were forced to learn Hindi. According to a 1995 report, all of the 37 persons identifying as Great Andamanese were of mixed Andamanese, Burmese and Indian ancestry. They live on Strait Island.
* Sentinelese: estimated to be 15 individuals in 2011 Indian census. They live in the North Sentinel Island.
By the end of the eighteenth century, there were an estimated 5,000 Great Andamanese living on Great Andaman. Altogether they comprised ten distinct tribes with different languages. The population quickly dwindled to 600 in 1901 and to 19 by 1961. It has increased slowly after that, following their move to a reservation on Strait Island. As of 2010, the population was 52, representing a mix of the former tribes.

The Jarawa originally inhabited southeastern Jarawa Island and have migrated to the west coast of Great Andaman in the wake of the Great Andamanese. The Onge once lived throughout Little Andaman and now are confined to two reservations on the island. The Jangil, who originally inhabited Rutland Island, were extinct by 1931; the last individual was sighted in 1907. Only the Sentinelese are still living in their original homeland on North Sentinel Island, largely undisturbed, and have fiercely resisted all attempts at contact.

== Languages ==

The Andamanese languages are considered to be the fifth language family of India, following the Indo-European, Dravidian, Austroasiatic, and Sino-Tibetan.

While some connections have been tentatively proposed with other language families, such as Austronesian, or the controversial Indo-Pacific family, the consensus view is currently that Andamanese languages form a separate language family – or rather, two unrelated linguistic families: &quot;Greater Andamanese&quot; and &quot;Ongan&quot;.

==Culture==

Until contact, the Andamanese were strict hunter-gatherers. They did not practice cultivation, and lived off hunting indigenous pigs, fishing, and gathering. Their only weapons were the bow, adzes, and wooden harpoons. The Andamanese knew of no method for making fire in the nineteenth century. They instead carefully preserved embers in hollowed-out trees from fires caused by lightning strikes.

The men wore girdles made of hibiscus fiber which carried useful tools and weapons for when they went hunting. The women on the other hand wore a tribal dress containing leaves that were held by a belt. A majority of them had painted bodies as well. They usually slept on leaves or mats and had either permanent or temporary habitation among the tribes. All habitations were man made.

Some of the tribe members were credited with having supernatural powers. They were called oko-pai-ad, which meant dreamer. They were thought to have an influence on the members of the tribe and would bring misfortune to those who did not believe in their abilities. Traditional knowledge practitioners were the ones who helped with healthcare. The medicine that was used to cure illnesses were herbal most of the time. Various types of medicinal plants were used by the islanders. 77 total traditional knowledge practitioners were identified and 132 medicinal plants were used. The members of the tribes found various ways to use leaves in their everyday lives including clothing, medicine, and to sleep on.

Anthropologist A.R. Radcliffe Brown argued that the Andamanese had no government and made decisions by group consensus.

=== Religion ===
The native Andamanese religion and belief system is a form of animism. Ancestor worship is an important element in the religious traditions of the Andaman islands. Andamanese Mythology held that humans emerged from split bamboo, whereas the women were fashioned from clay. One version found by Alfred Reginald Radcliffe-Brown held that the first man died and went to heaven, a pleasurable world, but this blissful period ended due to breaking a food taboo, specifically eating the forbidden vegetables in the Puluga&#x27;s garden. Thus Catastrophe ensued, and eventually the people grew overpopulated and didn&#x27;t follow Puluga&#x27;s laws, and hence there was a Great Flood that left four survivors, who lost their fire.

==Physical appearance==
=== Phenotype ===
Both male and female Andamanese average below 5 feet tall, with very dark skin. Their hair is described as &quot;peppercorn&quot;, growing in curled tufts with skin visible in between; this trait is shared with the Khoi people of Southern Africa. Similarly to other Negrito groups, the face is typically broad, with prominent cheek bones and a straight, broad nose. Andamanese women sometimes have steatopygia, where substantial levels of fat accumulate in the buttocks.
=== Dental morphology ===
Dental characteristics also group the Andamanese between Negrito and East-Asian samples.

When comparing dental morphology the focus is on overall size and tooth shape. To measure the size and shape, Penrose&#x27;s size and shape statistic is used. To calculate tooth size, the sum of the tooth area is taken. Factor analysis is applied to tooth size to achieve tooth shape. Results have shown that the dental morphology of Andaman Islanders resembles that of tribal populations of South Asia (Adivasi) the most, followed by Philippine Negrito groups, contemporary Southeast Asians, and East Asians. The tooth size of the Andamanese was found to be most similar to that of Han Chinese and Japanese.

==Genetics==
Genetic analysis, both of nuclear DNA and mitochondrial DNA provide information about the origins of the Andamanese. Genetic studies agree that Great Andamanese as well as Onge and Jawara, share a common origin to the exclusion of other Asians, and that they are highly genetically divergent from other Asian populations.

===Genetic variation===
The Andamanese show a very small genetic variation, which is indicative of populations that have experienced a population bottleneck and then developed in isolation for a long period.

An allele has been discovered among the Jarawas that is found nowhere else in the world. Blood samples of 116 Jarawas were collected and tested for Duffy blood group and malarial parasite infectivity. Results showed a total absence of both Fya and Fyb antigens in two areas (Kadamtala and R.K Nallah) and low prevalence of both Fya antigen in another two areas (Jirkatang and Tirur). There was an absence of malarial parasite &quot;Plasmodium vivax&quot; infection though &quot;Plasmodium falciparum&quot; infection was present in 27·59% of cases. A very high frequency of Fy (a–b–) in the Jarawa tribe from all the four jungle areas of Andaman Islands along with total absence of &quot;P. vivax&quot; infections suggests the selective advantage offered to Fy (a–b–) individuals against &quot;P. vivax&quot; infection.

===External genetic affinity===
Genetic studies have revealed that the Andamanese people display affinity to the indigenous South Asian hunter-gatherers, often termed &quot;Ancient Ancestral South Indians&quot; (AASI), as well as to Australasian populations (AA), such as Melanesians, and contemporary East/Southeast Asian peoples (ESEA). While the Andamanese are occasionally used as an imperfect proxy for the AASI component, they are genetically closer to the &#x27;Basal East Asian&#x27; Tianyuan man.

Phylogenetic data suggests that an early initial eastern lineage trifurcated, and gave rise to Australasians (Oceanians), the AASI, Andamanese, as well as East/Southeast Asians, although Papuans may have also received some geneflow from an earlier group (xOoA), around 2%, next to additional archaic admixture in the Sahul region. Concerning the use of Andamanese as proxy for AASI ancestry, Yelmen et al. (2019) deduced that the non West Eurasian component, termed &quot;S-component&quot;, extracted from South Asian samples would serve as a much better proxy for AASI ancestry, especially those extracted from Irula samples, than the Andamanese. Overall, the Malaysian Negritos (Semang), such as the Maniq people, Jahai people, and Batek people, are the closest modern living relatives of the Andamanese people.

When compared with ancient DNA samples, Andamanese peoples are closest to the pre-Neolithic Hoabinhians in Mainland Southeast Asia (covered by two samples from Malaysia and Laos), and display high genetic affinity to the Tianyuan man in Northern China, with both being basal to contemporary East Asians, forming a &quot;deep Asian&quot; ancestral lineage. Deep Asian ancestry (Tianyuan/Onge) contributed to the Peopling of Southeast Asia.


===Y-DNA===

The male Y-chromosome in humans is inherited exclusively through paternal descent. All sampled males of Onges (23/23) and Jarawas (4/4) belong to a sublineage of D-M174(D1a3). However, male Great Andamanese do not appear to carry these clades. A low resolution study suggests that they belong to haplogroups K, L, O and P1 (P-M45).

A 2017 study by Mondal et al. finds that the Y-chromosome of the Riang people (a Tibeto-Burmese population), sublineage D1a3 (D-M174*) and the Andamanese D1a3 (*D-Y34637) have their nearest related lineages in East Asia, splitting about 23,000 years ago from an East Asian-related population. The Jarawa and Onge shared this D1a3 lineage with each other within the last ~7,000 years, suggesting a bottleneck event. They further suggest that: “This strongly suggests that haplogroup D does not indicate a separate ancestry for Andamanese populations. Rather, haplogroup D was part of the standing variation carried by the OOA expansion, and later lost from most of the populations except in Andaman and partially in Japan and Tibet”. Other haplogroups found among Andamanese include haplogroup P, and L-M20.

Several studies (Hammer et al. 2006, Shinoda 2008, Matsumoto 2009, Cabrera et al. 2018) suggest that the paternal haplogroup D-M174 originated somewhere in Central Asia. According to Hammer et al., haplogroup D-M174 originated between Tibet and the Altai mountains. He suggests that there were multiple waves into Eastern Eurasia. In a 2019 study by Haber et al. showed that Haplogroup D-M174 originated in Central Asia and evolved as it migrated to different directions of the continent. One group of population migrated to Siberia, others to Japan and Tibet, and another group migrated to the Andaman islands.

===mt-DNA ===
Bulbeck (2013) shows the Andamanese maternal mtDNA is entirely mitochondrial Haplogroup M. Haplogroup M (mtDNA) is a descendant of haplogroup L3, typically found in Eurasia and parts of Africa. The mtDNA M is found in all Onge and most of the Great Andamanese samples. Analysis of mtDNA, which is inherited exclusively by maternal descent, confirms the above results. Haplogroup M is however also the single most common mtDNA haplogroup in Asia, where it represents 60% of all maternal lineages. Haplogroup M is also relatively common in Northeast Africa of Somalis, Oromo at over 20%. Also in the Tuareg in Mali and Burkina Faso at 18.42%.

===Archaic Admixture===
Unlike some Negrito populations of Southeast Asia, Andaman Islanders have not been found to have Denisovan ancestry. However, they are estimated, like all other non-African populations, to possess approximately 1-2% Neanderthal ancestry. A 2019 study concluded that all Asian and Australo-Papuan populations, including Andaman Islanders, also share between 2.6 and 3.4% of the genetic profile of a previously unknown hominin that was genetically roughly equidistant to Denisovans and Neanderthals.

<text>The Collins Kids were an American rockabilly duo featuring Lawrencine &quot;Lorrie&quot; Collins (May 7, 1942 – August 4, 2018) and her younger brother Lawrence &quot;Larry&quot; Collins (October 4, 1944 – January 5, 2024). Their hits in the 1950s as youngsters, such as &quot;Hop, Skip and Jump&quot;, &quot;Beetle Bug Bop&quot; and &quot;Hoy Hoy&quot;, were geared towards children, but their infectious singing and playing crossed over generations. Larry, a lightning-fingered guitar whiz at age ten, was known for playing a double-neck Mosrite guitar like his mentor, Joe Maphis.

==Career==
In 1955, the Collins Kids signed to Columbia Records. The Collins Kids became regular performers on &quot;Town Hall Party&quot; in 1954 and on the syndicated for television version of the show, Tex Ritter&#x27;s &quot;Ranch Party&quot;, which ran from 1957 to 1959. 

It was on &quot;Town Hall Party&quot; that Ricky Nelson first saw Lorrie Collins, and soon after they began dating. In a 1958 episode of &quot;The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet&quot;, Lorrie played both Ricky&#x27;s girlfriend and that girlfriend&#x27;s sister. Ricky unsuccessfully lobbied to make Lorrie a part of the show. 

In 1959, the Collins Kids were touring with Johnny Cash, when Lorrie met Cash&#x27;s manager and future husband Stu Carnall. 

The Collins siblings continued to perform together in the mid-1960s, appearing as regulars on the Canadian music program &quot;Star Route&quot; and making a guest appearance on the 8 September 1965, edition of &quot;Shindig!&quot;.

Larry wrote a number of well-known songs including &quot;Delta Dawn&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re the Reason God Made Oklahoma&quot;; some in partnership with songwriter Alexander Harvey.

=== Reunion ===
The duo reunited for a rockabilly revival concert in England in 1993 and performed together until Lorrie&#x27;s death in 2018. They appeared at Deke Dickerson&#x27;s Guitar Geek Festival in Anaheim, California on January 19, 2008 with their nephew Dakota Collins, who played upright bass as an addition to the Collins band.

<doc id="1338258" wikidata="Q2899541" url="?curid=1338258" title="North Shore (Chicago)">
<text>The North Shore consists of primarily affluent suburbs north of Chicago, Illinois, bordering the shores of Lake Michigan. These communities fall within suburban Cook County and Lake County. The primary constituents of the North Shore include Lake Bluff, Lake Forest, Highwood, Highland Park, Glencoe, Winnetka, Kenilworth, and Wilmette. The other communities generally considered to be apart of the North Shore include Deerfield, Riverwoods, Bannockburn, Northfield, Northbrook, Glenview, and Golf. The North Shore is known for its affluence, high level of education, proximity to Chicago, and top-rated public schools. Lake County, Illinois is among the wealthiest counties in the U.S. and several of the wealthiest zip codes are there.

== Communities and their years of settlement and incorporation ==

Source:

== History ==
Europeans settled the area sparsely after an 1833 treaty with local Native Americans. The region began to be developed into towns following the opening of Northwestern University in Evanston in 1855 and the founding of Lake Forest College two years later, and the construction and launch of railroads serving the colleges and their towns.

Electric rail lines were also run from Chicago, parallel to steam commuter lines, and streetcars flourished throughout the suburbs from Evanston on north. The North Shore today is noteworthy for being one of the few remaining agglomerations of streetcar suburbs in the United States.

This area became popular with the affluent wanting to escape urban life, beginning after the Great Chicago Fire, and grew rapidly before and just after World War II with a growing Jewish population migrating out of various neighborhoods in Chicago. The major Jewish suburban communities include Highland Park. Jews, however, were barred from living in Kenilworth and Lake Forest. The number of Jews in the north suburbs increased to 40% by the early 1960s.

In the 1960s, most of the northern suburbs were almost entirely white. One informal 1967 poll suggested that of 2,000 real estate listings, only 38 (around 2%) were open to African-Americans. 
===Origin and definition of term===
The term North Shore began to come into use in the early 1880s, and by 1889, with the creation of the North Shore Improvement Association, the name was officially established.

In 1890, Joseph Sears used the term several times in a brochure that was written to promote the newly-forming community of Kenilworth. It is believed to have come into widespread use following the establishment in 1891 of the Waukegan &amp; North Shore Rapid Transit Company, which in 1916 following reorganization was renamed the Chicago North Shore and Milwaukee Railroad (&quot;CNS&amp;M&quot;), popularly known as the North Shore Line. This railway ran along Lake Michigan&#x27;s western shore between Chicago and Milwaukee. The Shore Line route of the CNS&amp;M until 1955 served, from south to north, the Illinois communities of Chicago, Evanston, Wilmette, Kenilworth, Winnetka, Glencoe, Highland Park, Highwood, Fort Sheridan, Lake Forest, Lake Bluff, North Chicago, Waukegan, Zion, and Winthrop Harbor as well as Kenosha, Racine, and Milwaukee (the &quot;KRM&quot;) in Wisconsin. After 1924, the Skokie Valley line of the CNS&amp;M opened land further west to the North Shore.

Meanwhile, in 1906, the Sanitary District of Chicago platted the &quot;North Shore Channel&quot; of the sanitary canal from the Chicago River, through Evanston and Wilmette to Lake Michigan.

While the CNS&amp;M ran from Chicago all the way to Milwaukee, the term &quot;North Shore&quot; today typically refers only to the communities between Lake Bluff and Wilmette. Michael Ebner&#x27;s scholarly &quot;Creating Chicago&#x27;s North Shore: A Suburban History&quot;, one of the most thorough studies of the area, covers eight suburbs along the lake: Wilmette, Kenilworth, Winnetka, Glencoe, Highland Park, Highwood, Lake Forest, and Lake Bluff. In their &quot;North Shore Chicago: Houses of the Lakefront Suburbs, 1890-1940&quot;, Cohen and Benjamin include not only those eight suburbs but also &quot;the tiny city of Highwood&quot; which is slightly inland, just north of Highland Park.

==Socioeconomics and culture==

Today the North Shore remains one of the most affluent and highly educated areas in the United States. Seven of its communities are in the top quintile of U.S. household income, and five of those (Lake Forest, Glencoe, Kenilworth, Winnetka, Highland Park) are in the top 5 percent. The median household income is $127,000. 

The North Shore is also the home of the Ravinia Festival, a historic outdoor music theater in Highland Park, Illinois. The Ravinia Festival, originally conceived as a weekend destination on the CNS&amp;M line, is now a popular destination on the Metra Union Pacific North Line commuter rail, the North Shore Line&#x27;s former competitor. It hosts many concerts throughout the year that attract over 600,000 people. Highwood became home of the annual Pumpkin Festival which saw thousands of people every year flock to the small town for a week of music, food, community, and the lighting of 32,000 Jack o&#x27; Lanterns. The town used to hold the world record for most carved and lit Jack o&#x27; Lanterns but lost the title to Keene, New Hampshire. 

The abandoned right-of-way of the North Shore Line still serves Ravinia as the Green Bay Trail, a popular rails-to-trails bicycle path that begins in Wilmette and runs north all the way to the Illinois Beach State Park in Zion.

Despite being very nearly an enclave within Highland Park, Highwood has very different demographic characteristics than its neighbors. While its median income is close to the average for the state of Illinois, it has a much lower median income than neighboring municipalities. It is more densely populated, and is the only community on the North Shore where non-Hispanic whites do not constitute a majority of the population.

==Expansion of the definition==
It is becoming common for businesses in numerous nearby inland Chicago suburbs to name themselves as part of the &quot;North Shore&quot;. Real estate and other marketers notably use the term for Maine, New Trier, Niles, Northfield, and Norwood Townships, as well as those of southern Lake County and other nearby communities. The former &quot;North Shore&quot; magazine had special advertising editions not only for Evanston, Winnetka, Lake Forest, and Lake Bluff, but also for Skokie, Glenview, Northbrook, Barrington, Bannockburn, and Riverwoods.

Chicago&#x27;s North Shore Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau&#x27;s markets the City of Evanston and the Villages of Skokie, Glenview, Northbrook and Winnetka. More recently, a community newspaper known as &quot;What&#x27;s Happening&quot; began mailing out its publication to what it characterizes as the &quot;16 affluent North Shore suburbs&quot;: Bannockburn, Buffalo Grove, Deerfield, Fort Sheridan, Skokie, Glencoe, Glenview, Highland Park, Kenilworth, Libertyville, Lincolnshire, Northbrook, Northfield, Riverwoods, Vernon Hills, Wilmette, and Winnetka.

Overall, the general usage of the term &quot;North Shore&quot; is sometimes applied to the following suburbs: Bannockburn; Deerfield; Glenview; Golf; Green Oaks; Northbrook; Northfield; and Riverwoods. This definition favored by marketeers extends from Chicago&#x27;s northern boundary into central Lake County and from Lake Michigan to I-294.

==Education==
Mostly the Central Suburban League public high schools serve the North Shore. The Central Suburban League is an IHSA-recognized high school extracurricular conference comprising 12 public schools located in the northern suburbs of Chicago. Comprising 12 relatively large high schools, it is among the larger high school conferences (by student population) in Illinois. The Central Suburban League high schools include: Deerfield High School (Deerfield, IL), Evanston Township High School (Evanston, IL), Glenbrook North High School (Northbrook, IL), Glenbrook South High School (Glenview, IL), Highland Park High School (Highland Park, IL), Maine South High School (Park Ridge, IL), Maine East High School (Park Ridge, IL), Maine West High School (Des Plaines, IL), New Trier High School (Winnetka, IL), Niles West High School (Skokie, IL), Niles North High School (Skokie, IL), and Vernon Hills High School (Vernon Hills, IL).

Lake Forest High School, Libertyville High School, and Stevenson High School, are in the North Suburban Conference. The Lake Forest High School district serves Lake Forest and Lake Bluff, while the Stevenson High School district serves Lincolnshire and most of Buffalo Grove. Stevenson also takes in students from smaller parts of other North Shore suburbs such as Deerfield, Mettawa, Lake Forest, Riverwoods, Vernon Hills, as well as reaching into the far Northwest Suburbs such as Hawthorn Woods, Kildeer, Lake Zurich, Mundelein, and Long Grove.

Wheeling High School serves most of Wheeling, Illinois which is in the Mid-Suburban League.

A variety of private schools are found throughout the North Shore suburbs.

===Higher education===
Oakton College serves the same district as the Central Suburban League, with campuses in Des Plaines and Skokie. College of Lake County serves the Lake County suburbs of the North Shore, with its campus in Grayslake, Illinois. Harper College serves Wheeling with its campus in Palatine, Illinois.

==Films and television set or filmed on the North Shore==
This area received much exposure in the 1980s as the setting of many teen films, particularly those of writer/director John Hughes, who grew up in Northbrook and attended Glenbrook North High School. The most notable films through the years are:
* &quot;A Wedding&quot; (1978) was filmed at a house in Lake Forest.
* &quot;Ordinary People&quot; (1980) was filmed in Highwood, Highland Park, Lake Bluff, Lake Forest, Northbrook and Wilmette.
* &quot;Class&quot; (1983) was filmed at Lake Forest College in Lake Forest and other locations in Chicago.
* &quot;Risky Business&quot; (1983) was filmed in Deerfield, Highland Park, Skokie, Winnetka and Wilmette, in addition to Lake Shore Drive.

<text>Andrew Wilson Appel (born 1960) is the Eugene Higgins Professor of computer science at Princeton University. He is especially well known because of his compiler books, the &quot;Modern Compiler Implementation in ML&quot; () series, as well as &quot;Compiling With Continuations&quot; (). He is also a major contributor to the Standard ML of New Jersey compiler, along with David MacQueen, John H. Reppy, Matthias Blume and others and one of the authors of &quot;Rog-O-Matic&quot;.

== Biography ==
Andrew Appel is the son of mathematician Kenneth Appel, who proved the Four-Color Theorem in 1976. Appel graduated summa cum laude with an A.B. in physics from Princeton University in 1981 after completing a senior thesis, titled &quot;Investigation of galaxy clustering using an asymptotically fast N-body algorithm&quot;, under the supervision of Nobel laureate James Peebles. He later received a Ph.D. (computer science) at Carnegie Mellon University, in 1985. He became an ACM Fellow in 1998, due to his research of programming languages and compilers.

In 1981, Appel developed a better approach to the -body problem in linearithmic instead of quadratic time.

From July 2005 to July 2006, he was a visiting researcher at the &quot;Institut national de recherche en informatique et en automatique&quot; (INRIA), Rocquencourt, France, on sabbatical from Princeton University.

Andrew Appel campaigns on issues related to the interaction of law and computer technology. He testified in the penalty phase of the Microsoft antitrust case in 2002. He is opposed to the introduction of some computerized voting machines, which he deemed untrustworthy. In 2007, he received attention when he purchased a number of voting machines for the purpose of investigating their security. In 2024, he testified as an expert on voting machines in federal court hearings that led to a preliminary injunction disallowing New Jersey&#x27;s “county line” system that was alleged to provide an unfair advantage to candidates backed by county political party organizations.

<doc id="1338265" wikidata="Q7811918" url="?curid=1338265" title="Toby the Tram Engine">
<text>Toby the Tram Engine is a fictional anthropomorphic tram engine who debuted in &quot;The Railway Series&quot; by the Reverend Wilbert Awdry. Toby has cowcatchers and sideplates, and is the North Western Railway&#x27;s number 7. He works on the Ffarquhar Branch Line alongside Thomas the Tank Engine.

Toby first appeared in the seventh and eponymous book in &quot;The Railway Series&quot;, &quot;Toby the Tram Engine&quot;, in 1952, and appeared in several subsequent books. The second book focused on Toby was the sixth of Christopher Awdry&#x27;s books, &quot;Toby, Trucks and Trouble&quot;.

==Prototype and backstory==

Toby is based on a J70 tram engine from the Great Eastern Railway (GER Class C53). His cowcatchers and sideplates allow him to run on roadside tramways, which other engines are not allowed to do for safety reasons. J70s were used for light duties, such as branch line work and dock shunting.

Several J70s worked on the Wisbech and Upwell Tramway in East Anglia only from Awdry&#x27;s parish at Elsworth. Awdry published Toby the Tram Engine in 1952, shortly before he was transferred to Emneth. The Tramway ran through Emneth and it was well known to him. The inspiration for Toby came from the Awdrys watching J70 68221. Further inspiration was drawn soon after when Teddy Boston, then curate at Wisbech, arranged for Awdry to ride on the footplate of one of the last surviving steam tram engines on the Tramway. Fascinated by the unusual engines, Awdry sought a way to incorporate them in the stories. Research by Awdry&#x27;s brother, George, revealed that tramway regulations required the fitting of cowcatchers and sideplates for railway locomotives running on tracks alongside roads, and the story &quot;Thomas in Trouble&quot; (published in 1952, the year steam trams were replaced) evolved to provide a reason for Toby being summoned to Sodor. The story includes a description of Toby&#x27;s final journeys on the line:

This was a common occurrence during the closing of real railway lines; demand decreased to an unprofitable amount, but services were often full for the last workings of steam.
Christopher Awdry has said that Toby is his favourite character, partly because he was there when his father received the inspiration to create him, but also because as a child he had travelled in the cab of two J70s.

Awdry served as parish priest in two parishes in Cambridgeshire, the county associated with Toby. First, he was Rector of Elsworth with Knapwell from 1946 to 1953, then he was Vicar of Emneth from 1953 until 1965 when he retired from full-time ministry and moved to Stroud, Gloucestershire.

On Awdry&#x27;s model railway, Toby was represented by a Y6, an 0-4-0 locomotive similar to but smaller than the J70 and better suited to the 4-wheel motor bogie available to power the model. In 1961, Awdry wrote an article for &quot;Railway Modeller&quot; magazine on the construction of this locomotive.

==Biography==
===&quot;The Railway Series&quot;===
Toby is introduced in the seventh book in &quot;The Railway Series&quot;. The first story, &quot;Toby and the Stout Gentleman&quot;, describes the closure of his old tramway due to the lack of passengers and freight. Shortly before the line was going to close, a &quot;stout gentleman&quot; arrived on a holiday with his family; the children rode on Toby every day for a fortnight and the stout gentleman gave Toby&#x27;s crew a present. The day after the Tramway closed, ironically after an overcrowded final journey by Toby and Henrietta, a letter arrived from the stout gentleman which was to give Toby a reprieve.

In &quot;Thomas in Trouble&quot;, Thomas encounters an officious policeman, who says that, when running from the quarry, along public roads, engines who have the right to go on public roads must be fitted with cowcatchers and sideplates for safety to prevent people and animals from getting killed if they should have the right to stray onto the line. The Fat Controller, urgently needing to rectify this, is discussing the fitting of these, when Thomas remarks that &quot;everyone will laugh...they&#x27;ll say I look like a tram&quot;. The Fat Controller (the &quot;stout gentleman&quot;) remembers Toby immediately and arranges for him to come to Sodor. Toby arrives with his coach, Henrietta, and befriends Thomas after Toby rings his bell and frightens the policeman.

In &quot;Dirty Objects&quot;, James makes fun of Toby and Henrietta&#x27;s &quot;shabby&quot; appearance. James later has an accident with tar wagons. Toby and Percy help to clear up the mess and Toby is rewarded with a new coat of paint. His chosen livery of chocolate brown with blue sideplates replicates that which he would have worn on the Great Eastern Railway.

Toby has small water tanks, meaning he is unsuitable for long-distance work. In &quot;Double Header&quot; (in &quot;The Eight Famous Engines&quot;), Toby uses the Main Line to travel to the Works for servicing. Stopping at a water tower to refill his tanks, he is urged on to the next station by a new signalman who did not know about Toby&#x27;s small tanks. Toby tries to hurry to the next station but uses up the water and runs out of steam, leaving him marooned on the mainline, far away from the next station. Toby is pushed by James to the station, where some boys misunderstand the situation and suggest that James was unable to pull the Wild Nor&#x27; Wester, and Toby was needed to double-head the train.

In &quot;Tramway Engines&quot;, Toby tried to mentor a young diesel named Mavis to work at the quarry. However, Mavis was stubborn and after not listening to Toby, got stuck on a level crossing and halted traffic. This led her to get stuck in the yard shunting trucks. Mavis told the trucks to bump her at the level crossing so she could get out of the quarry without it seeming her fault. However, Toby was the next engine to take the trucks. The trucks carried out their plan regardless and Toby was left on a wrecked bridge dangling over a raging river. Mavis saved Toby and the trucks, and afterwards, they became friends. Toby arranged for Mavis to be allowed to take the trucks wherever she wanted.

In &quot;Thomas and Victoria&quot;, Toby is also associated with Furness Railway coach Victoria, who forms the &quot;Vintage Train&quot; with Henrietta that takes workers to and from the quarry.

===&quot;Thomas and the Magic Railroad&quot;===
In the 2000 film &quot;Thomas and the Magic Railroad&quot;, Toby is first seen reminding the other engines that they must not let Diesel 10 push them around. Later, after Diesel 10 overhears Thomas and Percy&#x27;s conversation about how Mr. Conductor travels to Sodor, Toby manages to stall Diesel 10 by ringing his bell. Diesel 10 tries to attack Toby with his claw, but instead fails and brings a shed down onto himself as well as his cronies.

Colm Feore provided the voice of Toby in the film, portraying the character with an old English dialect. While the movie itself has received polarising views from fans, Toby&#x27;s scene and portrayal throughout has generally been seen as one of its highlights.

==Henrietta==
Henrietta is Toby&#x27;s faithful coach, based on the Wisbech and Upwell Tramway non-articulated GER four-wheeled coach. She worked with Toby on their old railway, and when that line closed Toby could not bear to leave her behind. The stationmaster had wanted to turn her into a henhouse, but The Fat Controller agreed that &quot;that would never do.&quot; The two are inseparable, and whenever they are apart, they worry about each other:

Henrietta carries passengers and is used to bring quarry workers to and from work. In &quot;The Fat Controller&#x27;s Engines&quot; (&quot;The Eight Famous Engines&quot;), she is used as the Fat Controller&#x27;s private coach when the locomotives take a trip to The Other Railway.

Henrietta was the only named character not to be illustrated with a face in &quot;The Railway Series&quot; until book 41 of the series, &quot;Thomas and Victoria&quot;. In this book, Henrietta is depicted with a small rectangular face where a window on the end doors would be. It was the same colour as her cabin, like the other coaches. She would not be depicted with a visible face in the television series until the eighteenth series. Her face in this series is larger than in the &quot;Railway Series&quot;, and it completely replaces the door on one end, as well as the immediately adjoining window on both sides. The face is also whitish-grey, as are those of the engines and much of the rolling stock, as opposed to the same brown as her paintwork as she appears in the book.

Toby also has a baggage car named Elsie, mentioned in &quot;The Island of Sodor: Its People, History and Railways&quot; and the 1979 &quot;Thomas the Tank Engine Annual&quot;. However, she did not appear in any stories in &quot;The Railway Series&quot; or &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot;. According to the Rev. W. Awdry, she is based upon a Wisbech and Upwell Tramway luggage van and shares a shed with Henrietta.

==Heritage railways==
There are no surviving J70 trams; however, there is a replica based at the East Anglian Railway Museum, albeit it is a diesel-hydraulic 0-4-0 shunter with a metal casing over it. When this diesel was converted, a replica Henrietta was built from scratch. The underframe was taken from an old box van, but the body was a complete new build. Toby and Henrietta can be seen running on the museum&#x27;s &quot;Day Out with Thomas&quot; events.

A project to build a steam-powered replica of a GER Class G15 Wisbech and Upwell tram based on a Belgian Cockerill 0-4-0 tram engine has been underway for some time at the Nene Valley Railway. Named &quot;Toby&quot;, work on the project stalled following the deaths of the tram&#x27;s owners, but the project was sold in January 2011 with a view to recommencing work on the replica.

A project to build a J70 replica to resemble a tram engine based on the Wisbech and Upwell Tram Railway&#x27;s &quot;Toby the Tram Engine&quot; is under way at Mangapps Railway Museum near Burnham on Crouch in Essex. The engine is a Drewry – Vulcan industrial diesel locomotive &#x27;11104&#x27;.

She joined and edited the English language newspaper &quot;The Muslim&quot; in 1987, making her the first woman in Asia to edit a national daily newspaper. In 1990 she moved to become the founding editor of &quot;The News International&quot; where she remained until 1993 when she was appointed by Benazir Bhutto as the country&#x27;s envoy to the United States. She re-joined &quot;The News International&quot; 1997 as its chief editor and remained until 1999.

=== Ambassador to the United States ===

Dr. Lodhi became the Pakistani Ambassador to the United States under two different administrations: from 1993–1996 and then during 1999–2002 (in the process becoming Pakistan&#x27;s longest ever serving Ambassador to the US), before relinquishing her post on the completion of her second tour of duty. Since 2001, she has also served on the UN Secretary General&#x27;s Advisory Board on Disarmament Affairs (2001–2005) and continued to do so while holding the post of Pakistan&#x27;s High Commissioner to the United Kingdom (2003–2008).

According to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, During a trip of three U.S. senators to Islamabad, Benazir Bhutto introduced Lodhi by saying &quot;Meet Maleeha. She&#x27;s my strongest critic.&quot; The same source claims that she is said to have brokered Bhutto&#x27;s access to the late chief of army staff, Asif Nawaz, which helped pave the way for Bhutto&#x27;s return to power in 1993. In 1995, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published a letter from Lodhi critical of the time&#x27;s editorial suggesting cutting aid to Pakistan writing that the editorial is &quot;shocking as it echoes the argument of those who are least objective and rational on the issue.&quot;

During her time as Pakistan&#x27;s ambassador to the U.S she was present at the meeting on 12 September 2001, at the United States Department of State between Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage and Lieutenant General Mahmud Ahmed, the head of Pakistan&#x27;s Inter-Services Intelligence agency. The meeting served as pivotal in Pakistan&#x27;s role in War on Terror. In 2002, during an interview with CNN, she said that &#x27;We have to draw a distinction here between rooting out terrorism and the issue of self-determination of the Kashmiri people. These are two separate issues&#x27;.

A recipient of the 2002 Hilal-i-Imtiaz Presidential Award for Public Service, she is the author of two essay collections: &quot;Pakistan&#x27;s Encounter with Democracy&quot; and &quot;The External Challenge&quot; (Vanguard and Lahore Jang Publications, 1994). Her latest book, &quot;Pakistan: Beyond the Crisis State&quot;, was published in April 2011 (by C Hurst, Columbia University Press and Oxford University Press). In 1994, &quot;Time&quot; magazine cited Dr. Lodhi as one of 100 global pacesetters and leaders, who would define the 21st century and was the only person from Pakistan on that list.

=== High Commissioner to the United Kingdom ===
On 26 July 2003, Lodhi was appointed as the Pakistan&#x27;s envoy to the Court of St James&#x27;s, London by General Musharraf who sized power in the 1999 coup d&#x27;état. She served for 5-year, returning to Pakistan in 2008.

===Ambassador to the United Nations===

According to the &quot;Daily Times Pakistan&quot;, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif after extensive consultations with his close aide Sartaj Aziz, decided to appoint Lodhi in the UN. She succeeded Masood Khan in February 2015. Lodhi made her debut address at the United Nations on 6 February 2015 where she called for &#x27;addressing the underlying factors responsible for terrorism so as to formulate an effective and comprehensive response&#x27;.

Addressing the Catalytic Partnerships for Gender Equality in Education event in United Nations on 14 March 2015, Lodhi said Pakistan has launched innovative schemes and pilot projects for girls&#x27; education. Lodhi also said that the education voucher scheme launched in Punjab, as well as conditional grants that were given in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) have helped in promoting education in Pakistan. She also hosted a reception in honor of ambassadors and other prominent personalities at her residence.

Lodhi while addressing the United Nations Security Council debate on the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan she said that &quot;The new Afghan government has called for dialogue to resolve differences through political means. There are encouraging indications that the Taliban may be willing to negotiate with the National Unity Government,&quot; Lodhi urged that &quot;The Taliban will no doubt test the mettle of the Afghan National Security Force. It will need to demonstrate to them that a military solution is not possible,&quot;. 
After assuming charge as the President of executive board of UNICEF, Lodhi in an Op-Ed for CNN argued that &#x27;We must never accept a world in which humanitarian aid workers can be attacked and killed with impunity.&#x27; Under her leadership UNICEF has reaffirmed commitment to giving every child a fair chance in life. On 9 January 2016, she ended her year long tenure as UNICEF President. Anthony Lake thanked Lodhi for her contribution to achieving UNICEF&#x27;s goals in 2015. She oversaw adoption of 16 decisions for several UNICEF programmes and endeavours including an increase in the Emergency Programme Fund ceiling.

On 10 March 2016, Lodhi opposed adding new permanent members to the United Nations Security Council with or without a veto, adding that Pakistan supports expansion of the Security Council only in the non-permanent category in order to make the Council more democratic, accountable, effective and transparent.

On 29 August 2015, Lodhi rang the opening bell at the NASDAQ in New York to signal the ceremonial start of trading, saying Pakistan&#x27;s economy is on the upswing as it pursues liberal economic and investor-friendly policies. This was the first time the stock exchange has opened its doors to an ambassador from Pakistan to ring the opening bell to mark its Independence Day. On 24 April 2016, Lodhi invited Leonardo DiCaprio to Pakistan after a meeting with him at the UN.

On 30 May 2016, talking to the students at Harvard Kennedy School, Lodhi claimed that Pakistan&#x27;s massive military operation aimed at rooting out terrorism is in its final phase but the menace is not going to just go away unless there is peace on the other side of the border in strife-torn Afghanistan. On 6 January 2017, Lodhi provided a dossier on captured Indian spy Kulbhushan Yadav and evidence of attempted violation of maritime boundary by an Indian submarine to António Guterres. On 7th Febuaray 2017, Lodhi opposed the G4 nations submission on UN security reform saying that it is &quot;inconceivable&quot; to establish any institution that does not value &quot;principles of representation and accountability&quot; through periodic elections. In response to the United States recognition of Jerusalem as Israeli capital, Lodhi said Pakistan &quot;remained a steadfast supporter of the Palestinians despite the kind of threats we have received in recent days from the United States.&quot;

On 30 Sep 2019, she was replaced by Munir Akram, on orders of Prime Minister Imran Khan, as Pakistan&#x27;s Permanent Representative to the United Nations.

=== Global image ===
According to &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, &quot;Lodhi confounds every preconception about Pakistani women. She is sharp, funny, strong willed, articulate and a feminist who hates cooking&quot;. According to the &quot;New York Times&quot;, &quot;Lodhi presents herself as the paradigm of a modern self-made South Asian woman comes in part from her middle-class family heritage. Unlike Benazir Bhutto, whose roots are in the feudal landed gentry, Ms. Lodhi was the daughter of an oil executive and a journalist. She was sent to a convent run by nuns in Rawalpindi for schooling because that was the best education available, and a tolerant atmosphere prevailed. She learned to read the Koran as a child, but hers was a &quot;spiritual household&quot;, she said, rather than a strictly religious one.&quot;

=== Relationship with Robin Raphel ===

On 30 November, an exclusive report by &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; on Robin Raphel, a former Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs, who was a subject of a federal counterintelligence investigation, showcased close relationship between Lodhi and Raphel. According to report, Raphel and Lodhi turned to each other, on and off, for information and in 2014, the FBI became suspicious of their relationship leading to unsuccessful counterintelligence investigation. The report suggested that Lodhi and Raphel often met at The Ritz-Carlton, Washington, D.C. in the 1990s and worked together for the passage of an act by Senator Hank Brown easing sanctions on Pakistan. The report quoted U.S officials as seeing Lodhi as an &quot;influencer&quot; and saw her a trusted conduit for relaying messages to Pakistan&#x27;s senior military leadership in Rawalpindi.

=== Relationship with Pakistan Army ===
In February 2016, &quot;Pakistan Today&quot; reported that Hillary Clinton email&#x27;s revealed that Lodhi apparently acted as an informal messenger between the Obama Administration and then army chief General Ashfaq Pervez Kayani. In one of the emails by Vali Nasr to Clinton, Nasr wrote that &quot;I got a call from Maleeha Lodhi, who is in London. She gave a message from Kayani&quot;, The readout of Kayani&#x27;s message through Maleeha – running into two paragraphs was classified.

===Controversies ===
Lodhi was accused of religious bigotry after she deleted a tweet congratulating Mahershala Ali for his Best Supporting Actor Oscar win in 2017. Lodhi had initially congratulated Ali on being the first Muslim actor to win an Oscar. However, Lodhi deleted the tweet after other Twitter users &quot;pointed out&quot; that Ali is an [Ahmadiyya]- a member of an Islamic sect who are declared non-Muslims in Pakistani constitution.

Lodhi, while responding to Indian Minister of External Affairs Sushma Swaraj&#x27;s speech branding Pakistan an &quot;exporter of terrorism&quot;, in the midst of her &#x27;right to reply&#x27;, showed a photo of a woman whose face was peppered with wounds and said, &quot;This is the face of Indian democracy,&quot; when in actuality, the image depicted a Gazan Arab minor who had sustained bodily cephalic injury in a purported acid attack.

<text>Interstate 195 (I-195) is an auxiliary route of the Interstate Highway System located in the US state of New Jersey. Its western end is at I-295 and Route 29 just south of Trenton in Hamilton Township, Mercer County, while its eastern end is at the Garden State Parkway, Route 138, and Route 34 in Wall Township, Monmouth County. I-195 is in length. The route is mostly a four-lane highway that mainly runs through agrarian and wooded areas in Central Jersey. It has an interchange with the New Jersey Turnpike (I-95) in Robbinsville and serves as a main access road to New Jersey&#x27;s state capital of Trenton, the Horse Park of New Jersey, the Six Flags amusement park, and the Jersey Shore. I-195 is occasionally referred to as the Central Jersey Expressway. On April 6, 1988, President Ronald Reagan signed H.R. 4263 naming I-195 in New Jersey the James J. Howard Interstate Highway, in honor of the late James J. Howard.

The current I-195 was initially planned as a toll road called the Trenton–Asbury Park Expressway in the 1950s. In the 1960s, it became two proposed freeways Route 37 and Route 38 that were to cross the central part of the state. A compromise was reached for a single freeway between Trenton and Belmar which would get Interstate Highway funding as I-195. It was built in several stages during the 1970s and 1980s. There once existed a plan to extend the I-195 designation west to the interchange between the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-276) and I-95 in Bristol Township, Pennsylvania, but it was decided to extend the I-295 designation west and south, along existing I-95 instead.

The highway, along with the Route 138 extension, was built to also be an evacuation route in times of emergency, such as before Hurricane Sandy, when the eastbound lanes were reversed all the way from the coast to the New Jersey Turnpike (I-95) to accommodate for mass evacuations.

==Route description==
I-195&#x27;s western terminus is at a modified cloverleaf interchange with I-295 in Hamilton, Mercer County, located southeast of Trenton. From this end, the freeway continues north into Trenton as Route 29. I-195 serves as the southern continuation of Route 29, continuing east from I-295 as a six-lane expressway, passing between suburban neighborhoods to the north and Crosswicks Creek to the south. After the exit for U.S. Route 206 (US 206), the highway narrows to four lanes and turns northeast as it interchanges with South Broad Street (CR 524) and Arena Drive (CR 620). Following this, I-195 passes near more neighborhoods and runs to the northwest of Gropp Lake before turning more to the east. The route has a cloverleaf interchange with Yardville-Hamilton Square Road before passing near business parks and reaching a cloverleaf interchange with US 130. After US 130, the road enters Robbinsville as the settings start to become more rural, with a few areas of suburban development. In Robbinsville, there is a ramp that provides access to the New Jersey Turnpike (I-95). Shortly after passing over the New Jersey Turnpike, I-195 reaches the exit for CR 526. The highway runs to the north of Allentown before briefly forming the border between Robbinsville to the north and Upper Freehold, Monmouth County, to the south as it reaches the interchange with CR 524/CR 539.

Upon passing under CR 524/CR 539, I-195 fully enters Upper Freehold in Monmouth County and continues east through a mix of woodland and farmland. The next interchange the highway reaches is with Imlaystown-Hightstown Road (CR 43). Past this exit, the highway passes through more rural areas and crosses into Millstone Township. In this area, I-195 turns to the southeast and enters more forested areas as it comes to a cloverleaf interchange with CR 537. This exit off I-195 provides access to the Six Flags amusement park and the Jackson Premium Outlets. Due to the presence of Six Flags, this exit off I-195 can become busy during the summer months since it provides access to the park from both the New Jersey Turnpike and the Garden State Parkway, which lies just east of I-195&#x27;s eastern terminus. Upon crossing CR 537, the highway enters Jackson in Ocean County and continues east through heavy woods. The road comes to an exit with CR 527, where there is a park-and-ride lot for motorists. The median of I-195 widens past the interchange with CR 527 before narrowing as it comes to the interchange with CR 638. The road runs through more woodland, with nearby residential development increasing.

After crossing the North Branch of the Metedeconk River, I-195 continues into Howell, Monmouth County, and turns northeast, reaching a cloverleaf interchange with US 9. At this point, the road turns east again and soon heads back into dense woods, passing over the Southern Secondary railroad line operated by the Delaware and Raritan River Railroad. After crossing the Manasquan River, the expressway interchanges with CR 547, which provides access to CR 524 and CR 549. Shortly after CR 547, I-195 enters Wall Township and passes through Allaire State Park. The eastern end of I-195 is located at exit 35, its junction with Route 34 that has access to the southbound Garden State Parkway from the eastbound direction. At the exit for Route 34, I-195 ends and Route 138 begins, but the highway and exit numbering continue onto Route 138, marking the interchange with the Garden State Parkway as exit 36. Past this interchange, Route 138 continues east to Belmar on the Jersey Shore as an arterial boulevard, making connections with Route 18 and Route 35.

==History==

What would become I-195 was first proposed in the late 1950s as a toll road called the Trenton–Asbury Park Expressway that was to be operated by the New Jersey Highway Authority, the owner of the Garden State Parkway at the time. In 1965, this road would be incorporated into a planned Central Jersey Expressway System. The western portion would become a part of the Route 37 freeway that was to run from Trenton to Seaside Heights while the eastern portion would become a part of the Route 38 freeway that was to run from Camden to Belmar. The two freeways were to meet near Fort Dix. By 1967, plans for the Route 38 freeway were canceled, leaving Route 37 as the only planned east–west freeway through central New Jersey. The routing of this freeway, which was to be called the Central Jersey Expressway, was changed to run from the Trenton area east to Wall Township In addition, officials pushed for Interstate Highway funding for the freeway, with funds to be diverted from the canceled I-278 in Union County. The proposed freeway would cost $60 million (equivalent to $ in ).
By 1970, construction took place on the route between CR 539 near Allentown and CR 527 in Jackson Township. The portion of I-195 between the New Jersey Turnpike and CR 527 was opened by 1973 and construction on the section between White Horse and the New Jersey Turnpike began. In 1979, I-195 was completed east to Howell. By 1983, the length of I-195 was completed.

When it was planned, I-195 did not intersect I-95 at all; it instead connected to I-295 at its west end. When I-95 was rerouted to the New Jersey Turnpike after the cancelation of the Somerset Freeway, I-195 was connected to I-95. Previously, I-95 abruptly ended at I-295 and US 1 in Lawrence and motorists had to take I-295 southbound to I-195 east in order to access the New Jersey Turnpike (I-95). This is no longer necessary as a result of the Pennsylvania Turnpike/Interstate 95 Interchange Project which opened to traffic on September 22, 2018, completing the full length of I-95 from Miami, Florida, to Houlton, Maine.

On April 6, 1988, President Ronald Reagan signed H.R. 4263 naming I-195 in New Jersey the James J. Howard Interstate Highway, in honor of the late James J. Howard, a US Representative from New Jersey who advocated improving the highways of the US.

In 1997, separate ramps were added from I-195 to westbound and eastbound CR 537, and the westbound ramp was expanded to two lanes for Six Flags traffic.
I-195, like many other highways in New Jersey, once had solar-powered emergency callboxes every . With the advent of cellphones, the callboxes saw limited use. To save on maintenance costs, the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) removed the callboxes in 2005.

On April 30, 2010, NJDOT started a project to repave the expressway both eastbound and westbound from just east of the turnpike overpasses near exit 7 in Robbinsville to exit 11 in Upper Freehold. This was completed in late 2010.

From July 2009 until November 2014, the New Jersey Turnpike (I-95) was widened with the construction of new outer roadways (&quot;truck lanes&quot;) that extended the &quot;dual-dual&quot; roadways south to exit 6 in Mansfield Township from its former end at Exit 8A in Monroe Township. As part of this project, the overpasses carrying I-195 over the turnpike were reconstructed, the exit 7A toll gate was widened, and all the ramps connecting directly to the mainline of the turnpike were rebuilt which included building a new high-speed ramp over I-195 to enter the northbound lanes of the turnpike.
For about a decade, there was a plan to extend the designation of I-195 to the west in tandem with the rerouting of I-95 planned as part of the Pennsylvania Turnpike/Interstate 95 Interchange Project. Beginning in 2005, plans were made to extend I-195 west from its present-day western terminus along I-295 and I-95, continuing counterclockwise to the north, west, and south around Trenton to the new interchange. I-295 would have been truncated to the current interchange with I-195. Officials from New Jersey and Pennsylvania had agreed to submit the I-195 request to American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), as no route designation is official until approved by them. Had it been approved, approximately would have been added to I-195. Interchange renumbering would have also taken place in concert with the future I-195 designation in Pennsylvania and both the planned and current I-195 designation in New Jersey. This proposal had received conditional approval from AASHTO. However, on May 20, 2015, the original plan of extending I-295 west and south into Pennsylvania to the new interchange was approved instead, leaving the western terminus of I-195 at its current location.

In 2018, the exit numbers at the interchanges for I-295 (exits 60A–B) and US 206 (exits 1A–B) were renumbered to exits 1A–B and exits 1C–D, respectively. This change was done as part of the I-95/I-295 redesignation project to match the milemarkers along I-195.

==Future==
In the late 1990s, NJDOT considered the possibility of widening I-195 to six lanes between the New Jersey Turnpike and CR 537 in order to accommodate traffic going to Six Flags. NJDOT has revived the possibility, and has studied proposals to widen I-195 between CR 537 and the New Jersey Turnpike from four to six total lanes, eliminating the grass median in the process.

<text>The Birdy is a folding bicycle designed by Riese und Müller in Germany and produced by Pacific Cycles in Taiwan. As of 2010 over 100,000 had been sold. Three distinct models have been marketed, in addition to some specialist variations, with the third (Mk3) introduced in July 2015.

First released in 1995, it was the first fully suspended folding bike. The ride is regarded by some as more sporty than the Brompton, thanks in part to a stiff single-piece aluminium frame with road bike rider geometry and no hinge. Some prefer its stiff suspended ride and rapid acceleration to that of a full-sized bike.

==Specifications==
 

Markus Riese had the basic idea for the Birdy in 1992. The first prototype was quickly welded together from two old bicycles in his parents&#x27; garage (photos and German article here). After a year, Markus Riese and Heiko Muller built a prototype out of aluminium and won the “Hessian Innovation Prize”. The prototype was shown at two trade shows, Intercycle in Cologne and Eurobike in Friedrichshafen, and caused a stir. The first Birdy bikes were sold in late 1995 as a &#x27;de luxe&#x27; folder, the first with full suspension. It had a high price tag, usually over US$1,000.

Several specifications were available, most with dérailleur gears but including one model with a rubber belt drive. All had only one front chainring, and a range of gearing options on the rear wheel from 6 to 14 gears. There was a short period in 1996-1997 when a stock of blue frames entered the USA and were built up and sold with inferior 6 speed components, branded as &#x27;Jeep Renegade&#x27;. 
The Birdy&#x27;s dimensions are small enough to take into offices, on buses, and to pack for travelling. It is the second smallest of the quality folding bikes (behind the Brompton), and is similar in size to the Mezzo performance folder:
Width: 
Height: 
Length: 

The front suspension is unique among bikes currently on the market. The leading arm design provides anti-dive suspension, unlike trailing arm designs. The hinged rear swingarm is suspended by a urethane bush, that can also be replaced with a gas-filled unit. The bike has always offered standard rear dropout spacing, which allows a wide range of gearing options and disc brakes. Standard options currently include: 8-speed hub gear, 8-speed dérailleur, 24-speed SRAM Dual Drive hybrid gearing system, and the Rohloff Speedhub 14-speed hub gear. The more expensive models are now fitted with disc brakes.

Wheels are 18&quot; but conversions can easily be made to the more readily available 16&quot; size used by Brompton. For a long time there were no decent 18&quot; tyres. Some owners have fitted 20-inch wheels to the bike (a 10th anniversary limited edition had 20&quot; wheels as standard ).

For folding, the rear suspension tucks under the frame, the front suspension is unclipped and hinges back under the frame, and the seat post is collapsed. Lastly the handlebars hinge downward. The front wheel can be left unfolded if the package is to be wheeled, for example when boarding public transport. Folding is relatively more complicated than for a Brompton and takes slightly longer.

Available accessories are mudguards, front and rear folding racks, bags, lighting sets and some upmarket extra components sold in Singapore and Hong Kong, like gas suspension units and upgraded chain tensioners for folding. Two optional rear racks are available, the &quot;SL Carrier&quot; and the &quot;Expedition Carrier&quot;. The former mounts directly to the swingarm, and allows only the use of a rack-top bag. The latter is a folding 16mm tubular rack mounted on pivots on both the main frame and the swingarm, which allows use of small panniers (e.g. Ortlieb Front Roller) when mudguards (fenders) are fitted. The mounting pivots for this rack have only been fitted to frames since 2003. Both racks are available with rollers which allows the Birdy to roll when folded.

A slightly lighter Mark 2 monocoque frame, with greater support for the seatpost (top picture), was introduced in 2006 along with new component choices. The Mark 1 continued to appear with a slightly updated frame on some models, notably the World Comfort (7 speed Nexus, and the &#x27;Birdy Classic&#x27; of 2020. Mark 1 frames were available in Asia from a third party, badged as Rhine and produced in China or the Philippines.

The standard Mark 2 weighed (2013). Some riders have reduced the Birdy&#x27;s weight to 8 kg using racing components, but this was only on the Mark 1 frames. Stock bikes ranged from (for the Birdy Speed with Tune and Shimano Ultegra road components) to over , depending on the setup. The heavier bikes tend to have 3x8 gearing systems, involving an internally geared rear hub and an external derailleur. The Birdy Race () was introduced in 2013 and had dropped handlebars, and Shimano 20-speed gears with two front chainrings.

A smaller version of the Birdy, the Frog, was introduced in the 2000s, then withdrawn due to poor sales, and was back on the market again briefly from 2010. It is now a collector&#x27;s item.

A mark 3 design was released in July 2015. The frame looks the same as a Mk2, but the fold is smaller, the bike is slightly lighter, components have again been strengthened, and the front fork redesigned. The confusing number of models has been reduced to four.

==Average price==
Equipment set up differs greatly from country to country. In the US, entry-level bikes cost approximately $1,500 and are equipped with low-mid range Shimano Alivio components. The Birdy monocoque frameset costs approximately US$1,000 without parts. Prices for the Mk 2 rose to the electric model with a 250watt motor in the rear wheel (£3258/US$5068, 2013)

In the UK, the entry-level model (World Sport) cost £939 (in 2013) to permit purchase under cycle-to-work schemes. High-end titanium models (rare outside Japan and Taiwan) can cost over US$4,500. Japan, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan and China are the biggest markets for these bikes and customised spares are available from companies like Colorplus and Ridea. In Japan, the bike is distributed as the Bianchi Fretta (OEM) and BD-1. The cheapest model in Australia was A$1,400 in 2015 and around A$2000 in 2021.

The Birdy is distributed in Europe by Riese und Müller, in Japan by Pacific Cycles Japan, in North America through dealers B-Fold. and in Australia by St.Kilda Cycles (until 2013, then again from 2015). Some distributors make custom modifications to the bicycle including better suspension dampers and wheels.

==Uses and advantages==
With its wide range of gearing options, stiff frame and basic suspension, the Birdy is suitable not only for commuting but also for longer distance touring.

The combination of smooth but stiff ride, fold, and quirky looks have created a fetish for the Birdy in Japan and other parts of Asia. It also has a large following in the UK, Europe, the US, and Australia. The Birdy&#x27;s folded size is similar to the 20-inch Dahon folders: larger than a Brompton, but significantly smaller than a Bike Friday (including the Tikit).

The Birdy&#x27;s advantages over conventional bicycles and other folding ones are:

*It folds quickly into a small package. Thus, it can be taken into stores, onto trains, and into the office, yet can also be used for cross-country touring or fast group rides. It is much easier to fit in a suitcase than comparable Bike Friday or Airnimal models, but less easy to pack than a Brompton. The only other hinge-free performance bicycle that is small enough to serve as a multi-mode commuter or that fits into an airline legal suitcase with minimal disassembly is the (unsuspended) Mezzo folding bike.
*A Birdy can fit into a standard airline-legal 29-inch suitcase, but this requires the pedals, wheels, and rear rack to be removed. Some Birdy owners have had difficulty fitting both the bike and the rear rack into a standard suitcase, and recommend the larger 31-inch format. When fitted with thin racing tires and removable pedals, the bike can fit in a suitcase with less disassembly. With a larger case (designed specifically for the Birdy), no disassembly is required. A standard slipcase must be used on some trains and buses.
*The suspension allows for a smooth ride on small wheels. The anti-dive suspension has minimal impact on pedalling efficiency due to its stiffness, while improving rolling resistance on rough surfaces. The suspension can be adjusted using different elastomers (small pieces of rubber that serve as suspension, but gas filled alternatives are available).
*The Birdy has no frame hinge, with both the front and the back points of contact serving as latches and shock absorbers. Thus, the downward force of the rider holds the bike together in such a way that the latches cannot fail while providing shock absorption.
*The bike has a sportier ride than the Brompton and has a wide range of gears.

In sum it is a versatile bike, offering high performance, and sturdiness and luggage capacity for loaded long-distance touring using a variety of racks and panniers supplied by R&amp;M and other manufacturers. Reviews, for example those by the reputable alternative bike magazine AtoB, point to the great speed and comfort of the Mark 2, but the folding is not always quick if you miss a step, and the tyres available for 18&quot; rims were limited for some years. Tire selection is now adequate, and Kevlar-beaded tires, which can be folded for carriage in panniers, are available including the Schwalbe Marathon Racer.

==Disadvantages==

The main criticisms are:

*The Birdy is expensive, with some models costing as much as custom made bikes. Nonetheless, secondhand Birdys can be bought on eBay or from specialist listing like AtoB for as little as US$500 for a Mark 1 model, and more commonly up to $700. 
*The 100% aluminium components used to get stress fractures in the early years, particularly when ridden by heavier riders or very energetically. New models have much stronger components. 
*The Birdy uses 18 inch (355mm ETRTO) wheels. This allows for a compact folded size but makes finding replacement wheels, tubes and tires more difficult. 
*Gears and brake components are standard. But the availability of some spare parts for the Birdy is rare, even in places in which sell folding bicycles, due to their unique design. For example: The Birdy uses a unique rear rack, a &quot;spoon&quot; clip to hold the rear in place, and unique front suspension bearings. Mudguards, however, can be made from any plastic equivalent and are a cheaper option than the Birdy models.

Criticisms noticed by some riders:
*Component selection on the Mk 2 sometimes seemed illogical, with lower level Capreo components on the top-of-the-line monocoque frame, and higher quality SRAM X7 components on the less expensive model. However, the Capreo groupset was specifically designed for small-wheel bicycles as its smallest 9-tooth sprocket compensates for the small wheel size.
*The unique front folding mechanism - while popular and distinctive - is long, weaker, and more flexible than a standard design; the tolerance of linkages amplifies the flex, causing the leading arms to wander up to the Mk2 design (now much strengthened); thus an old Birdy may be unstable at speed. Bushes on the front suspension can be replaced.
*The Birdy, like most folders, has a long seatpost and stem. Thousands of km of use can damage the headset or weaken the stem mount - old models could experience cracking after about ten years. The longer handlebar stem limits the extent to which the rider can pull on the handlebars, but a stronger adjustable version was introduced in the early 2000s that is more sturdy, and a further improvement in 2015. The larger head tube on the Moulton gives it better hill climbing and sprinting abilities. However, with proper cycling shoes, Birdy riders can be found in non-UCI racing events and in pacelines of fast group rides.
*The back folding mechanism, which folds beneath the frame, doesn&#x27;t retain chain tension when folded if dérailleur gears are fitted (unlike the Brompton for example). Again, this has been solved on the Mk 3.

<text>Irish Bob Murphy (July 22, 1922 – August 17, 1961) was an Irish-American light heavyweight boxer who fought from 1945 to 1954. He was born Edwin Lee Conarty in Flagler, Colorado, but fought out of San Diego, California. Murphy, who was a southpaw, was a top light heavyweight contender, and in 2003 made the Ring Magazine&#x27;s list of 100 greatest punchers of all time.

==Early life==
Edward Lee Conarty was born in Flagler, Colorado, on July 22, 1922, to Della Mae (Curtis) and John Patrick Conarty. He joined the Navy at the age of 18 in Salt Lake City, Utah, on March 18, 1941, and was assigned aboard the U.S.S. &quot;Lexington&quot;.

After the U.S.S. &quot;Lexington&quot; went down in the Battle of Coral Sea on May 8, 1942, Conarty was among the many Lexington survivors that were assigned to the U.S.S. &quot;Alabama&quot; (BB-60) to put it into commission. Conarty was known for his boxing skill and was a member of both the &quot;Lexington&quot; and &quot;Alabama&quot; boxing teams. Nicknamed &quot;Jack&quot; Conarty during his service aboard the &quot;Mighty A,&quot; he was known as an exciting boxer who &quot;packed a blockbuster in his left (southpaw) and would take anything his opponent could hand out just long enough to unload one of his bombs.&quot; It is said that he never lost a single boxing match in his entire service aboard BB-60.

==Pro career==
Under the new professional name Irish Bob Murphy, he unsuccessfully challenged Joey Maxim for the light heavyweight championship on August 22, 1951. Although Murphy entered the ring as the favorite, Maxim clearly outboxed him and won a unanimous 15-round decision.

Murphy&#x27;s biggest win came on June 27, 1951, against former middleweight champion Jake LaMotta, who had moved up to the light heavyweight division after losing his crown to Sugar Ray Robinson. LaMotta appeared poorly prepared for the bout, weighing a career-high 175½ lbs. The match stopped when LaMotta could not answer the bell for the eighth round. Murphy and LaMotta fought a rematch on June 11, 1952, and LaMotta won the decision.

Murphy retired in 1954 with a 65-11-1 record and 57 knockout wins.

==Death==
Murphy was killed in a road accident in Boston, when he crashed his motorcycle and broke his neck on August 1, 1961.

<doc id="1338292" wikidata="Q631359" url="?curid=1338292" title="Brake fluid">
<text>Brake fluid is a type of hydraulic fluid used in hydraulic brake and hydraulic clutch applications in automobiles, motorcycles, light trucks, and some bicycles. It is used to transfer force into pressure, and to amplify braking force. It works because liquids are not appreciably compressible.

Most brake fluids used today are glycol-ether based, but mineral oil (&quot;Citroën/Rolls-Royce liquide hydraulique minéral&quot; (LHM)) and silicone-based (DOT 5) fluids are also available.

The origins of modern braking systems date back to an event more than a century ago - in 1917, Scotsman Malcolm Lockheed patented a hydraulic actuated braking system. Initially, vegetable oil was used as a working fluid. But it did not meet the most basic requirements, and in the process of evolution, special brake fluids were created, which consist of a base and a package of additives (thickeners, anti-corrosion additives, colorants).

==Standards==
Most Brake fluids are manufactured to meet standards set by international, national, or local organizations or government agencies.

===International===
The International Standards Organisation has published its standard ISO 4925, defining classes 3, 4, and 5, as well as class 5.1, class 6 and class 7 reflecting progressively higher performance for brake fluids.

===SAE===
The Society of Automotive Engineers SAE has published standards J1703, J1704, and J1705, reflecting progressively higher performance for brake fluids. These have counterparts in the international standard, ISO 4925.

===United States===
The Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) under FMVSS Standard No. 116 defines grades DOT 3, DOT 4, DOT 5 and DOT 5.1, where DOT refers to the U.S. Department of Transportation. These are widely used in other countries. Their classifications broadly reflect the SAE&#x27;s specifications, DOT 3 is equivalent to SAE J1703 and ISO class 3, DOT 4 to SAE J1704 and ISO class 4, etc.

All DOT compliant fluids must be colorless or amber, except for DOT 5 silicone, which must be purple. FMVSS Standard No. 116&#x27;s scope is limited to fluid &#x27;for use&#x27;. Brake fluid &#x27;in use&#x27;, or not labeled DOT compliant, is found in any color.

==== DOT 4 ====
While a vehicle that uses DOT 3 may also use DOT 4 or 5.1 (a temperature upgrade) if the elastomers in the system accept the borate compounds that raise the boiling point, a vehicle that requires DOT 4 might boil the brake fluid if a DOT 3 (a temperature downgrade) is used. Additionally, these polyglycol-ether-based fluids cannot be mixed with DOT 5.0, which is silicone based.

==== DOT 5 ====
DOT 5 is a silicone-based fluid and is separate from the series of DOT 2, 3, 4, 5.1. It is immiscible with water, and with other brake fluids, and must not be mixed with them. Systems can change fluid only after a complete system changeover, such as a total restoration.

It contains at least 70% by weight of a diorgano polysiloxane. Unlike polyethylene glycol based fluids, DOT 5 is hydrophobic. An advantage over other forms of brake fluid is that silicone has a more stable viscosity index over a wider temperature range. Another property is that it does not damage paint.

DOT 5 brake fluid is not compatible with anti-lock braking systems. DOT 5 fluid can aerate when the anti-lock brake system is activated. DOT 5 brake fluid absorbs a small amount of air requiring care when bleeding the system of air.

==== DOT 5.1 ====
Lack of acceptance of silicone-based fluids led to the development of DOT 5.1, a fluid giving the performance advantages of silicone, whilst retaining some familiarity and compatibility with the glycol ether fluids. DOT 5.1 is the non-silicone version of DOT 5, defined by FMVSS 116 as being less than 70% silicone. Above that threshold makes it DOT 5.

==Characteristics==
Brake fluids must have certain characteristics and meet certain quality standards for the braking system to work properly.

===Viscosity===
For reliable, consistent brake system operation, brake fluid must maintain a constant viscosity under a wide range of temperatures, including extreme cold. This is especially important in systems with an anti-lock braking system (ABS), traction control, and stability control (ESP), as these systems often use micro-valves and require very rapid activation. DOT 5.1 fluids are specified with low viscosity over a wide range of temperatures, although not all cars fitted with ABS or ESP specify DOT 5.1 brake fluid.
For a faster reaction of the ABS and ESP systems, DOT 4 and DOT 5.1 brake fluids exist with low viscosity meeting the maximum 750 /s viscosity at requirement of ISO 4925 class 6. These are often named DOT 4+ or Super DOT 4 and DOT 5.1 ESP.

===Boiling point===
Brake fluid is subjected to very high temperatures, especially in the wheel cylinders of drum brakes and disk brake calipers. It must have a high boiling point to avoid vaporizing in the lines. This vaporization creates a problem because vapor is highly compressible relative to liquid, and therefore negates the hydraulic transfer of braking force - so the brakes will fail to stop the vehicle.

Quality standards refer to a brake fluid&#x27;s &quot;dry&quot; and &quot;wet&quot; boiling points. The wet boiling point, which is usually much lower (although above most normal service temperatures), refers to the fluid&#x27;s boiling point after absorbing a certain amount of moisture. This is several (single digit) percent, varying from formulation to formulation. Glycol-ether (DOT 3, 4, and 5.1) brake fluids are hygroscopic (water absorbing), which means they absorb moisture from the atmosphere under normal humidity levels. Non-hygroscopic fluids (e.g. silicone/DOT 5 and mineral oil based formulations), are hydrophobic, and can maintain an acceptable boiling point over the fluid&#x27;s service life.

Silicone based fluid is more compressible than glycol based fluid, leading to brakes with a &quot;spongy&quot; feeling. It can potentially suffer phase separation/water pooling and freezing/boiling in the system over time - the main reason single phase hygroscopic fluids are used.


===Corrosion===
Brake fluids must not corrode the metals used inside components such as calipers, wheel cylinders, master cylinders and ABS control valves. They must also protect against corrosion as moisture enters the system. Additives (corrosion inhibitors) are added to the base fluid to accomplish this. Silicone is less corrosive to paintwork than glycol-ether based DOT fluids.

The advantage of the Citroën LHM mineral oil based brake fluid is the absence of corrosion. Seals may wear out at high mileages but otherwise these systems have exceptional longevity. It cannot be used as a substitute without changing seals due to incompatibility with the rubber.

===Compressibility===
Brake fluids must maintain a low level of compressibility, even with varying temperatures to accommodate different environmental conditions. This is important to ensure consistent brake pedal feel. As compressibility increases, more brake pedal travel is necessary for the same amount of brake caliper piston force.

== Functions ==
When the driver depresses the brake pedal, pressure is transmitted to the brake master cylinder. The brake cylinder piston pressurizes a system of hydraulic tubes, each of which leads to a different wheel. The brake fluid in the tubes, in turn, pressurizes the brake slave cylinders, which are on each wheel. The slave cylinder pistons press down the brake pads. They encompass and compress the brake disk, and the rotation of the wheels slows down. 

In addition to transmitting pressure, brake fluid also keeps the brake system working optimally. It helps to regulate temperature, ensuring that components are resistant to the heat generated during braking. Proper maintenance of the brake fluid level is critical, as low levels or contaminated fluid can lead to reduced braking performance and, in extreme cases, brake failure.

Brake fluid is mainly used on brake systems, but is also widely used for hydraulically controlled clutches. 

Depending on the application, the fluid is subjected to different pressures: in the case of motorcycles, it has pressure peaks that range from 8 to 15 bar, while in Formula 1 cars it exceeds 75 bar.

==Service and maintenance==

Glycol-ether (DOT 3, 4, and 5.1) brake fluids are hygroscopic (water absorbing), which means they absorb moisture from the atmosphere under normal humidity levels. Non-hygroscopic fluids (e.g. silicone/DOT 5 and mineral oil based formulations), are hydrophobic, and can maintain an acceptable boiling point over the fluid&#x27;s service life. Ideally, silicone fluid should be used only to fill non-ABS systems that have not been previously filled with glycol based fluid. Any system that has used glycol-based fluid (DOT 3/4/5.1) will contain moisture; glycol fluid disperses the moisture throughout the system and contains corrosion inhibitors. Silicone fluid does not allow moisture to enter the system, but does not disperse any that is already there, either. A system filled from dry with silicone fluid does not require the fluid to be changed at intervals, only when the system has been disturbed for a component repair or renewal. The United States armed forces have standardised on silicone brake fluid since the 1990s. Silicone fluid is used extensively in cold climates, particularly in Russia and Finland.

Brake fluids with different DOT ratings can not always be mixed. DOT 5 should not be mixed with any of the others as mixing of glycol with silicone fluid may cause corrosion because of trapped moisture. DOT 2 should not be mixed with any of the others. DOT 3, DOT 4, and DOT 5.1 are all based on glycol esters and can be mixed, although it is preferable to completely replace existing fluids with fresh to obtain the specified performance.

Brake fluid is toxic and can damage painted surfaces.

<doc id="1338293" wikidata="Q164102" url="?curid=1338293" title="Italian battleship Vittorio Veneto">
<text>Vittorio Veneto was the second member of the that served in the Italian &quot;Regia Marina&quot; (Royal Navy) during World War II. The ship&#x27;s keel was laid down in October 1934, launched in July 1937, and readied for service with the Italian fleet by August 1940. She was named after the Italian victory at Vittorio Veneto during World War I, and she had three sister ships: , , and , though only &quot;Littorio&quot; and &quot;Roma&quot; were completed during the war. She was armed with a main battery of nine guns in three triple turrets, and could steam at a speed of .

&quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot; saw extensive service during the war. The ship escaped undamaged during the British raid on Taranto in November 1940. Early in the war, she participated in the Battle of Cape Spartivento in November 1940 and the Battle of Cape Matapan in March 1941 where she was damaged by a torpedo bomber, and then she was torpedoed by the British submarine in December 1941. She spent 1941 and early 1942 attempting to attack British convoys to Malta, but crippling fuel shortages in the Italian fleet curtailed activity thereafter. &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot; was among the Italian ships that were surrendered to the Allies in September 1943 after Italy withdrew from the war, and &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot; with the rest of the Italian fleet was taken into internment, spending the following three years under British control in Egypt. After the war, she was allocated as a war prize to Britain and subsequently broken up for scrap.

==Description==

&quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot; was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of . She was designed with a standard displacement of , a violation of the restriction of the Washington Naval Treaty; at full combat loading, she displaced . The ship was powered by four Belluzo geared steam turbines rated at . Steam was provided by eight oil-fired Yarrow boilers. The engines provided a top speed of and a range of at . &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot; had a crew of 1,830 to 1,950 over the course of her career.

&quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot;″s main armament consisted of nine 50-caliber Model 1934 guns in three triple turrets; two turrets were placed forward in a superfiring arrangement and the third was located aft. Her secondary anti-surface armament consisted of twelve /55 Model 1934/35 guns in four triple turrets placed at the corners of the superstructure. These were supplemented by four /40 Model 1891/92 guns in single mounts; these guns were old weapons and were primarily intended to fire star shells. &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot; was equipped with an anti-aircraft battery that comprised twelve /53 Model 1939 guns in single mounts, twenty  /54 guns in eight twin and four single mounts, and sixteen  /65 guns in eight twin mounts. EC 3 ter Gufo radar, which could detect surface targets at a range of and aircraft at , was installed in July 1943.

The ship was protected by a main armor belt that was with a second layer of steel that was thick. The main deck was thick in the central area of the ship and reduced to in less critical areas. The main battery turrets were thick and the lower turret structure was housed in barbettes that were also 350 mm thick. The secondary turrets had 280 mm thick faces and the conning tower had thick sides. &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot; was fitted with a catapult on her stern and equipped with three IMAM Ro.43 reconnaissance float planes or Reggiane Re.2000 fighters.

==Service history==

===Construction===
&quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot; was ordered under the 1934 construction program, and was named for the Battle of Vittorio Veneto, a decisive Italian victory over the Austro-Hungarian Empire in October–November 1918 during World War I. Her keel was laid down on 28 October 1934 at &quot;Cantieri Riuniti dell&#x27;Adriatico&quot; in Trieste, the same day as her sister ship . &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot; was launched on 25 July 1937, and major construction was completed by October 1939. The fitting-out process was greatly delayed due to repeated changes to the design and shortages of heavy armor plate. Before she could begin sea trials, &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot; was moved to Venice on 4 October to have her bottom cleaned of the fouling that had accumulated during the long fitting-out period, since the Venice Arsenal had the only drydock in Italy long enough to accommodate a ship the size of the &quot;Littorio&quot; class.

On 17 October, with the cleaning completed, the dockyard personnel flooded the drydock to conduct stability tests. The new battleship moved to Trieste on 19 October, and her trials began on 23 October. The trials, which also included tests for the ship&#x27;s weaponry, lasted until March 1940, after which some additional fitting-out work was completed. She was delivered on 28 April, though she was not yet complete. On 1 May, &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot; was sent to La Spezia for final fitting-out work, escorted by the destroyers and . On 6 May, she was loaded with shells for her main battery; the loading work for the main and secondary guns lasted until 20 May. Later that day, she was transferred to Taranto, escorted by the destroyers and , where she joined the 9th Division of the Italian fleet. The following month, Italy joined the war against Britain and France, though it wasn&#x27;t until 2 August that &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot; and &quot;Littorio&quot; were formally declared operational.

===World War II===

On 31 August – 2 September 1940, &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot; sortied as part of an Italian force of five battleships, ten cruisers, and thirty-four destroyers to intercept British naval forces taking part in Operation Hats and Convoy MB.3, but contact was not made with either group due to poor aerial reconnaissance and no action occurred. In addition, British aerial reconnaissance detected the oncoming Italian fleet and was able to escape. On 6 September, the fleet sortied again to attack a British force that had been reported leaving Gibraltar, but the British ships instead steamed south into the Atlantic. A similar outcome resulted from the movement against British Operation &quot;MB.5&quot; on 29 September - 1 October; &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot;, four other battleships, eleven cruisers, and twenty-three destroyers had attempted to intercept the convoy carrying troops to Malta. In this operation, the Italian &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; (Royal Air Force) did locate the convoy, but the British were able to evade the Italian fleet.

On the night of 10–11 November, the British Mediterranean Fleet launched an air raid on the harbor in Taranto. Twenty-one Swordfish torpedo bombers launched from the aircraft carrier attacked the Italian fleet in two waves. The Italian base was defended by twenty-one 90 mm anti-aircraft guns and dozens of smaller 37 mm and 20 mm guns, along with twenty-seven barrage balloons. The defenders did not possess radar, however, and so were caught by surprise when the Swordfish arrived. The first wave struck at 20:35, followed by the second about an hour later. &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot; was undamaged in the attack, but three other battleships were hit, two of which were severely damaged. The morning after the Taranto raid, &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot; led the Italian fleet to Naples. There, she took over the role of fleet flagship, under the command of Admiral Inigo Campioni.

====Battle of Cape Spartivento====
On 17 November, &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot; and —the only operational Italian battleships—participated in an attempt to intercept the British Operation White convoy to Malta, though the forces made no contact. On 26 November, the Italian fleet made another attempt to attack a British convoy, Operation Collar, which resulted in the Battle of Cape Spartivento (known as the Battle of Cape Teulada to the Italians). &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot;, &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot;, six cruisers, and fourteen destroyers attempted to catch a convoy steaming to Malta. The British escort included the aircraft carrier , the battleship , and the battlecruiser ; Italian aerial reconnaissance detected the escorts but exaggerated their strength and Campioni, under orders to not risk his two operational battleships against equal or stronger opponents, broke off the engagement shortly after it began. &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot; briefly engaged several British cruisers at the extreme range 27,000 metres (17 miles). &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot; fired 19 rounds in seven salvos from long range and slightly damaged the light cruiser &quot;Manchester&quot;; that was enough for the now outgunned British cruisers, which turned back at the fourth salvo. During the engagement, &quot;Ark Royal&quot; launched torpedo bombers against &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot;, but the latter successfully evaded the torpedoes.

Repeated British air attacks on Naples, one of which damaged the cruiser , prompted the high command to move &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot; and the rest of the major warships of the fleet to Sardinia on 14 December. They were returned to Naples six days later, however, after the high command concluded that removing the fleet to Sardinia would allow British convoys from Alexandria to reach Malta with relative ease. On the night of 8–9 January 1941, the British launched an air raid with Vickers Wellington bombers on the Italian fleet in Naples, but the aircraft again failed to hit &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot;; &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot; was slightly damaged by several near misses. Both ships were moved to La Spezia the next day, with &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot; providing cover for &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot;. &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot; was now the only operational battleship in the fleet. &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot; was back in service by early February, as was . The three battleships, along with eight destroyers, attempted to intercept Force H on 8 February, which was en route to bombard Genoa. The two forces did not encounter each other, and the Italian fleet returned to La Spezia.

====Battle of Cape Matapan====

&quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot; returned to Naples on 22 March, and four days later led an attempt to attack British shipping off Greece, in company with eight cruisers and nine destroyers. The fleet would be supported by the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; and the German &quot;Fliegerkorps X&quot; (10th Air Corps). This operation resulted in the Battle of Cape Matapan; the engagement began when the Italian 3rd Division—comprising the two heavy cruisers and and commanded by Vice Admiral Luigi Sansonetti—encountered the British 15th Cruiser Squadron. Iachino attempted to maneuver &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot; to the east of the British cruisers while they were distracted with Sansonetti&#x27;s cruisers, but spotted the battleship before she could close the trap. &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot; immediately opened fire and quickly found the range, but only inflicted splinter damage on &quot;Orion&quot;, which fled to the south, back toward the main British fleet. Misfires in &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot;″s forward-most turret forced her to cease firing temporarily. The Italian gunners quickly returned the guns to action, however, and resumed their bombardment of the British cruisers. Poor visibility and smokescreens hampered the accuracy of &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot;″s gunners and they scored no hits, though they straddled the cruisers several times. In the course of this phase of the battle, she had fired 92 rounds from her main battery.
During this period of the battle, torpedo bombers from the carrier arrived on the scene and their attack forced &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot; to break off the engagement with the British cruisers to take evasive action. She evaded the torpedoes, but the attack convinced Iachino that the Mediterranean Fleet was at sea, which prompted him to end the operation and return to port. The British launched several air attacks against the Italian fleet in an attempt to slow down &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot;, including land-based Blenheim bombers from Greece and Crete. Later in the afternoon &quot;Formidable&quot; launched a second strike, and at 15:10 one of her Swordfish hit &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot; on her port side, aft. The Italian anti-aircraft gunners shot the plane down after it launched its torpedo. The hit sheared off the port side propeller, damaged the shaft, jammed the port rudder, and disabled the aft port pumps. It also caused severe flooding—some of water entered the ship—which gave her a 4–4.5 degree list to port, and forced her to stop for about ten minutes. While she was immobilized, a Blenheim bomber dropped a bomb that landed near her stern; the blast caused further, minor damage to the stern.

The damage control parties had great difficulty in controlling and reducing the flooding, as they could use only emergency hand pumps. Some forward and starboard voids were counter-flooded to reduce the list. In the meantime, engine room personnel were able to restart the starboard shafts and steering could be effected with the backup hand-steering gear. After she got back underway, she was able to slowly increase her speed to using only her starboard shafts. While the Italian fleet was withdrawing, &quot;Formidable&quot; launched another air strike of nine Swordfish in an attempt to slow &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot; down. But instead of hitting the Italian battleship, they struck the cruiser &quot;Pola&quot;, leaving her dead in the water. &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot; returned to port while two cruisers and several destroyers were detached to protect &quot;Pola&quot;; all three cruisers and two destroyers were sunk in a furious night action at very close range with the battleships , , and . &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot; meanwhile reached Taranto on 29 March, where repairs lasted until July. She was not fully operational again until August.

====Later operations====

&quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot; and &quot;Littorio&quot; participated in an unsuccessful sortie to intercept British forces on 22–25 August. The British had intended to mine Livorno and launch an air raid on northern Sardinia, but Italian agents in Spain warned the &quot;Regia Marina&quot; of the British operation when it departed Gibraltar. The Italian fleet positioned itself too far to the south, however, and aerial reconnaissance failed to locate the British. A month later, &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot; led the attack on the Allied convoy in Operation Halberd on 27 September 1941, in company with &quot;Littorio&quot;, five cruisers, and fourteen destroyers. The British had hoped to lure out the Italian fleet and attack it with a powerful convoy escort centered on the battleships , , and . It too ended without contact with the British fleet; neither side located the other, but Italian torpedo bombers hit &quot;Nelson&quot;. At 14:00, Iachino cancelled the operation and ordered the fleet to return to port.

On 13 December, she participated in another operation to escort a convoy to North Africa, but the attempt was broken off after a British radio deception effort convinced the Italians that the British fleet was in the area. While returning to port the following day, &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot; was torpedoed by the British submarine in the Straits of Messina. &quot;Urge&quot; fired a spread of three torpedoes, but only one hit on her port side. The torpedo tore a hole long and caused over of water to flood the ship, though the ship&#x27;s Pugliese torpedo defense system successfully contained the explosion. &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot; took on a 3.5 degree list to port and was down by by the stern. Some counter flooding of a compartment on the starboard side abreast of the forward-most turret reduced the list by a degree, and she was able to steam under her own power back to port. She returned to Taranto for repairs, which lasted until early 1942.

On 14 June, &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot; participated in the interception of the Operation Vigorous convoy to Malta from Alexandria. &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot;, &quot;Littorio&quot;, four cruisers and twelve destroyers were sent to attack the convoy. The British quickly located the approaching Italian fleet and launched several air strikes early on 15 June with Wellington and Bristol Beaufort bombers in an attempt to prevent them from reaching the convoy. The aircraft scored no hits on the battleships, but they did disable the cruiser , which was later sunk by a British submarine. Later that morning another air attack, this time B-24 Liberators from the USAAF, occurred. The high-level bombers scored one hit on &quot;Littorio&quot; and several near misses around her and &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot;, but neither ship was seriously damaged. Another British strike with Beauforts arrived shortly thereafter, but Italian and German fighters had since arrived and they shot down two Beauforts and damaged five others. By the afternoon, Iachino had concluded that he would not reach the convoy before dark, and so he broke off the operation; by then, however, the threat from the Italian battleships had led to the failure of the British operation, as the convoy had been ordered back to Alexandria, and did not reach Malta. On the return voyage, another British air attack succeeded in torpedoing &quot;Littorio&quot;.

===Fate===

On 12 November, &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot; was moved to Naples from Taranto in response to the Allied invasion of North Africa. While en route, the British submarine unsuccessfully attacked &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot;. An American air raid on the harbor on 4 December prompted the Italians to withdraw the fleet to La Spezia, where it remained for the rest of Italy&#x27;s active participation in the war. On 5 June 1943, &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot; was badly damaged by an American air raid on La Spezia; she was hit by two large bombs toward the bow, though only one detonated. That bomb passed through the ship and exploded under the hull, causing serious structural damage. The damage forced her to be transferred to Genoa for repair work, since the dockyard in La Spezia had also been damaged by the attack. On 3 September, Italy signed an armistice with the Allies, ending her active participation in World War II. Six days later, &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot; and the rest of the Italian fleet sailed for Malta, where they would be taken into internment for the remainder of the war. While en route, the German &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; (Air Force) attacked the Italian fleet using Dornier Do 217s armed with Fritz X radio-controlled bombs. &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot; was undamaged but &quot;Littorio&quot;—by now renamed &quot;Italia&quot;—was hit and damaged and her sister was sunk in the attack.

&quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot; remained in Malta until 14 September, when she and &quot;Italia&quot; were moved to Alexandria, Egypt and then to the Great Bitter Lake in the Suez Canal on 17 October. The two battleships remained there until 6 October 1946, when they were permitted to return to Italy. &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot; went to Augusta, Sicily before moving to La Spezia on 14 October. In the Treaty of Peace with Italy, signed on 10 February 1947, &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot; was allocated as a war prize to Britain. She was paid off on 3 January 1948, stricken from the naval register on 1 February, and subsequently broken up for scrap.

&quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot; had been the most active Italian battleship of the war, having participated in eleven offensive operations. Twelve 90 mm anti-aircraft guns taken from &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot; were reused by the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army (JNA) as armament of its Žirje Island coastal artillery battery. The battery surrendered without resistance to the Croatian National Guard on 14 September 1991, during the Croatian War of Independence, and played a pivotal role in 16–22 September Battle of Šibenik, helping defend the city of Šibenik against the JNA and bottling up in harbor 34 Yugoslav Navy&#x27;s patrol boats and minesweepers, one-fourth of the Yugoslav fleet, which were eventually seized by Croatian forces.

<text>A privacy policy is a statement or legal document (in privacy law) that discloses some or all of the ways a party gathers, uses, discloses, and manages a customer or client&#x27;s data. Personal information can be anything that can be used to identify an individual, not limited to the person&#x27;s name, address, date of birth, marital status, contact information, ID issue, and expiry date, financial records, credit information, medical history, where one travels, and intentions to acquire goods and services. In the case of a business, it is often a statement that declares a party&#x27;s policy on how it collects, stores, and releases personal information it collects. It informs the client what specific information is collected, and whether it is kept confidential, shared with partners, or sold to other firms or enterprises. Privacy policies typically represent a broader, more generalized treatment, as opposed to data use statements, which tend to be more detailed and specific.

The exact contents of a certain privacy policy will depend upon the applicable law and may need to address requirements across geographical boundaries and legal jurisdictions. Most countries have own legislation and guidelines of who is covered, what information can be collected, and what it can be used for. In general, data protection laws in Europe cover the private sector, as well as the public sector. Their privacy laws apply not only to government operations but also to private enterprises and commercial transactions.

== History ==

In 1968, the Council of Europe began to study the effects of technology on human rights, recognizing the new threats posed by computer technology that could link and transmit in ways not widely available before. In 1969 the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) began to examine the implications of personal information leaving the country. All this led the council to recommend that policy be developed to protect personal data held by both the private and public sectors, leading to Convention 108. In 1981, Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data (Convention 108) was introduced. One of the first privacy laws ever enacted was the Swedish Data Act in 1973, followed by the West German Data Protection Act in 1977 and the French Law on Informatics, Data Banks and Freedoms in 1978.

In the United States, concern over privacy policy starting around the late 1960s and 1970s led to the passage of the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Although this act was not designed to be a privacy law, the act gave consumers the opportunity to examine their credit files and correct errors. It also placed restrictions on the use of information in credit records. Several congressional study groups in the late 1960s examined the growing ease with which automated personal information could be gathered and matched with other information. One such group was an advisory committee of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, which in 1973 drafted a code of principles called the Fair Information Practices. The work of the advisory committee led to the Privacy Act in 1974. The United States signed the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development guidelines in 1980.

In Canada, a Privacy Commissioner of Canada was established under the Canadian Human Rights Act in 1977. In 1982, the appointment of a Privacy Commissioner was part of the new Privacy Act. Canada signed the OECD guidelines in 1984.

== Fair information practice ==

There are significant differences between the EU data protection and US data privacy laws. These standards must be met not only by businesses operating in the EU but also by any organization that transfers personal information collected concerning citizens of the EU. In 2001 the United States Department of Commerce worked to ensure legal compliance for US organizations under an opt-in Safe Harbor Program. The FTC has approved eTRUST to certify streamlined compliance with the US-EU Safe Harbor.

== Current enforcement ==

In 1995 the European Union (EU) introduced the Data Protection Directive for its member states. As a result, many organizations doing business within the EU began to draft policies to comply with this Directive. In the same year, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) published the Fair Information Principles which provided a set of non-binding governing principles for the commercial use of personal information. While not mandating policy, these principles provided guidance of the developing concerns of how to draft privacy policies.

The United States does not have a specific federal regulation establishing universal implementation of privacy policies. Congress has, at times, considered comprehensive laws regulating the collection of information online, such as the Consumer Internet Privacy Enhancement Act and the Online Privacy Protection Act of 2001, but none have been enacted. In 2001, the FTC stated an express preference for &quot;more law enforcement, not more laws&quot; and promoted continued focus on industry self-regulation.

In many cases, the FTC enforces the terms of privacy policies as promises made to consumers using the authority granted by Section 5 of the FTC Act which prohibits unfair or deceptive marketing practices. The FTC&#x27;s powers are statutorily restricted in some cases; for example, airlines are subject to the authority of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and cell phone carriers are subject to the authority of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).

In some cases, private parties enforce the terms of privacy policies by filing class action lawsuits, which may result in settlements or judgments. However, such lawsuits are often not an option, due to arbitration clauses in the privacy policies or other terms of service agreements.

== Applicable law ==

=== United States ===

While no generally applicable law exists, some federal laws govern privacy policies in specific circumstances, such as:
* The Children&#x27;s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) affects websites that knowingly collect information about or targeted at children under the age of 13. Any such websites must post a privacy policy and adhere to enumerated information-sharing restrictions COPPA includes a &quot;safe harbor&quot; provision to promote Industry self-regulation. 
* The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires institutions &quot;significantly engaged&quot; in financial activities give &quot;clear, conspicuous, and accurate statements&quot; of their information-sharing practices. The Act also restricts use and sharing of financial information.
* The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) privacy rules requires notice in writing of the privacy practices of health care services, and this requirement also applies if the health service is electronic.
*The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) gives consumers more control over the personal information that businesses collect about them and the CCPA regulations provide guidance on how to implement the law. 
*The California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (CPRA) expands the privacy and information security obligations of most employers doing business in California.

Some states have implemented more stringent regulations for privacy policies. The California &quot;Online Privacy Protection Act of 2003 – Business and Professions Code sections 22575-22579&quot; requires &quot;any commercial websites or online services that collect personal information on California residents through a web site to conspicuously post a privacy policy on the site&quot;. Both Nebraska and Pennsylvania have laws treating misleading statements in privacy policies published on websites as deceptive or fraudulent business practices.

=== Canada ===

Canada&#x27;s federal Privacy Law applicable to the private sector is formally referred to as Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA). The purpose of the act is to establish rules to govern the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information by commercial organizations. The organization is allowed to collect, disclose and use the amount of information for the purposes that a reasonable person would consider appropriate in the circumstance.

The Act establishes the Privacy Commissioner of Canada as the Ombudsman for addressing any complaints that are filed against organizations. The Commissioner works to resolve problems through voluntary compliance, rather than heavy-handed enforcement. The Commissioner investigates complaints, conducts audits, promotes awareness of and undertakes research about privacy matters.

=== European Union ===

The right to privacy is a highly developed area of law in Europe. All the member states of the European Union (EU) are also signatories of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). Article 8 of the ECHR provides a right to respect for one&#x27;s &quot;private and family life, his home and his correspondence&quot;, subject to certain restrictions. The European Court of Human Rights has given this article a very broad interpretation in its jurisprudence.

In 1980, in an effort to create a comprehensive data protection system throughout Europe, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) issued its &quot;Recommendations of the Council Concerning Guidelines Governing the Protection of Privacy and Trans-Border Flows of Personal Data&quot;. The seven principles governing the OECD’s recommendations for protection of personal data were:
# Notice—data subjects should be given notice when their data is being collected;
# Purpose—data should only be used for the purpose stated and not for any other purposes;
# Consent—data should not be disclosed without the data subject&#x27;s consent;
# Security—collected data should be kept secure from any potential abuses;
# Disclosure—data subjects should be informed as to who is collecting their data;
# Access—data subjects should be allowed to access their data and make corrections to any inaccurate data; and
# Accountability—data subjects should have a method available to them to hold data collectors accountable for not following the above principles.
The OECD guidelines, however, were nonbinding, and data privacy laws still varied widely across Europe. The US, while endorsing the OECD’s recommendations, did nothing to implement them within the United States. However, all seven principles were incorporated into the EU Directive.

In 1995, the EU adopted the Data Protection Directive, which regulates the processing of personal data within the EU. There were significant differences between the EU data protection and equivalent U.S. data privacy laws. These standards must be met not only by businesses operating in the EU but also by any organization that transfers personal information collected concerning a citizen of the EU. In 2001 the United States Department of Commerce worked to ensure legal compliance for US organizations under an opt-in Safe Harbor Program. The FTC has approved a number of US providers to certify compliance with the US-EU Safe Harbor. Since 2010 Safe Harbor is criticised especially by German publicly appointed privacy protectors because the FTC&#x27;s will to assert the defined rules hadn&#x27;t been implemented in a proper even after revealing disharmonies.

Effective 25 May 2018, the Data Protection Directive is superseded by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which harmonizes privacy rules across all EU member states. GDPR imposes more stringent rules on the collection of personal information belonging to EU data subjects, including a requirement for privacy policies to be more concise, clearly-worded, and transparent in their disclosure of any collection, processing, storage, or transfer of personally identifiable information. Data controllers must also provide the opportunity for their data to be made portable in a common format, and for it to be erased under certain circumstances.

=== Australia ===

The Privacy Act 1988 provides the legal framework for privacy in Australia. It includes a number of national privacy principles. There are thirteen privacy principles under the Privacy Act. It oversees and regulates the collection, use and disclosure of people&#x27;s private information, makes sure who is responsible if there is a violation, and the rights of individuals to access their information.

=== India ===
The Information Technology (Amendment) Act, 2008 made significant changes to the Information Technology Act, 2000, introducing Section 43A. This section provides compensation in the case where a corporate body is negligent in implementing and maintaining reasonable security practices and procedures and thereby causes wrongful loss or wrongful gain to any person. This applies when a corporate body possesses, deals or handles any sensitive personal data or information in a computer resource that it owns, controls or operates.

In 2011, the Government of India prescribed the Information Technology (Reasonable security practices and procedures and sensitive personal data or information) Rules, 2011 by publishing it in the Official Gazette. These rules require a body corporate to provide a privacy policy for handling of or dealing in personal information including sensitive personal data or information. Such a privacy policy should consist of the following information in accordance with the rules:

# Clear and easily accessible statements of its practices and policies;
# Type of personal or sensitive personal data or information collected;
# Purpose of collection and usage of such information;
# Disclosure of information including sensitive personal data or information;
# Reasonable security practices and procedures.

The privacy policy should be published on the website of the body corporate, and be made available for view by providers of information who have provided personal information under lawful contract.

== Online privacy certification programs ==
Online certification or &quot;seal&quot; programs are an example of industry self-regulation of privacy policies. Seal programs usually require implementation of fair information practices as determined by the certification program and may require continued compliance monitoring. TRUSTArc (formerly TRUSTe), the first online privacy seal program, included more than 1,800 members by 2007. Other online seal programs include the Trust Guard Privacy Verified program, , and Webtrust.

== Technical implementation ==

Some websites also define their privacy policies using P3P or Internet Content Rating Association (ICRA), allowing browsers to automatically assess the level of privacy offered by the site, and allowing access only when the site&#x27;s privacy practices are in line with the user&#x27;s privacy settings. However, these technical solutions do not guarantee websites actually follows the claimed privacy policies. These implementations also require users to have a minimum level of technical knowledge to configure their own browser privacy settings. These automated privacy policies have not been popular either with websites or their users. To reduce the burden of interpreting individual privacy policies, re-usable, certified policies available from a policy server have been proposed by Jøsang, Fritsch and Mahler.

== Criticism ==
Many critics have attacked the efficacy and legitimacy of privacy policies found on the Internet.
Concerns exist about the effectiveness of industry-regulated privacy policies. For example, a 2000 FTC report Privacy Online: Fair Information Practices in the Electronic Marketplace found that while the vast majority of websites surveyed had some manner of privacy disclosure, most did not meet the standard set in the FTC Principles. In addition, many organizations reserve the express right to unilaterally change the terms of their policies. In June 2009 the EFF website TOSback began tracking such changes on 56 popular internet services, including monitoring the privacy policies of Amazon, Google and Facebook.

There are also questions about whether consumers understand privacy policies and whether they help consumers make more informed decisions. A 2002 report from the Stanford Persuasive Technology Lab contended that a website&#x27;s visual designs had more influence than the website&#x27;s privacy policy when consumers assessed the website&#x27;s credibility. A 2007 study by Carnegie Mellon University claimed &quot;when not presented with prominent privacy information...&quot; consumers were &quot;…likely to make purchases from the vendor with the lowest price, regardless of that site&#x27;s privacy policies&quot;. However, the same study also showed that when information about privacy practices is clearly presented, consumers prefer retailers who better protect their privacy and some are willing to &quot;pay a premium to purchase from more privacy protective websites&quot;. Furthermore, a 2007 study at the University of California, Berkeley found that &quot;75% of consumers think as long as a site has a privacy policy it means it won&#x27;t share data with third parties,&quot; confusing the existence of a privacy policy with extensive privacy protection. Based on the common nature of this misunderstanding, researcher Joseph Turow argued to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission that the term &quot;privacy policy&quot; thus constitutes a deceptive trade practice and that alternative phrasing like &quot;how we use your information&quot; should be used instead.

Privacy policies suffer generally from a lack of precision, especially when compared with the emerging form of the Data Use Statement. Where privacy statements provide a more general overview of data collection and use, data use statements represent a much more specific treatment. As a result, privacy policies may not meet the increased demand for transparency that data use statements provide.

Critics also question if consumers even read privacy policies or can understand what they read. A 2001 study by the Privacy Leadership Initiative claimed only 3% of consumers read privacy policies carefully, and 64% briefly glanced at, or never read privacy policies. The average website user once having read a privacy statement may have more uncertainty about the trustworthiness of the website than before. One possible issue is length and complexity of policies. According to a 2008 Carnegie Mellon study, the average length of a privacy policy is 2,500 words and requires an average of 10 minutes to read. The study cited that &quot;Privacy policies are hard to read&quot; and, as a result, &quot;read infrequently&quot;. However, any efforts to make the information more presentable simplify the information to the point that it does not convey the extent to which users&#x27; data is being shared and sold. This is known as the &quot;transparency paradox&quot;.

There have been many studies carried out by researchers to evaluate the privacy policies of the websites of companies. One study uses natural language processing and deep learning as a proposed solution to automatically assess the efficiency of companies&#x27; privacy policies, in order to help the users become more aware.

<doc id="1338318" wikidata="Q5750337" url="?curid=1338318" title="Hi (magazine)">
<text>Hi (), also known as Hi International, was a glossy, teen lifestyle publication targeted at Middle Eastern and Muslim youth. Like Alhurra and Radio Sawa, the magazine was a tool of public diplomacy, produced by the United States State Department in conjunction with The Magazine Group, an external publishing company.

The magazine was distributed monthly. The targeted audience ranged from ages 18 to 35. According to some reports, the price per issue was $2 United States dollars, and others stated that the price range was $1.50-3.00. Each issue had 72 pages. It was to be distributed to Algeria, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Syria, and 17 other countries, with printing occurring in the Philippines.

The government stated that the magazine would not discuss politics nor would it discuss controversial issues, such as Al Qaeda, the Arab–Israeli conflict, the 2003 invasion of Iraq, or Afghanistan.

==History==
Gavin Daly launched &quot;Hi International&quot; in July 2003 with a $4.2 million yearly budget. It featured celebrity interviews, music reviews, lifestyle stories, advertisements for hip gadgets, and other morsels of Americana with Conor McCutcheon serving as the first editor/Hi Wizard. The State Department hired The Magazine Group, professional magazine publishers who also publish titles such as &quot;Package Machinery Today&quot; and &quot;Diabetes Forecast&quot;, to produce &quot;Hi International&quot;. Its initial issue, in Arabic, appeared on newsstands in the Middle East in July 2003; a website followed soon thereafter. The magazine cost less than two dollars and was also available for subscription. &quot;Hi&quot;&#x27;s writers were American, generally of Middle Eastern or Muslim descent, and wrote in Arabic. In the summer of 2004, about a year after its initial launch, &quot;Hi&quot; made its English language debut on the web. It also debuted around a similar time when Radio Sawa was launched, a broadcast aimed at younger people in Arabic.

On December 22, 2005, the magazine was suspended by the US Department of State so it can be assessed as to whether it meets its objectives correctly or whether it is unacceptable.

==Purpose==
&quot;Hi International&quot; was an instrument of public diplomacy—the attempt to promote U.S. national interests by informing, engaging, and influencing people around the world. The State Department produced &quot;Hi&quot; with the explicit goal of informing the youth of the Middle East and Muslim world about American culture. The project was based on the supposition that if this demographic had a clearer understanding of what America is really like, then some of their hostility could be assuaged. Consequently, the publication attempted to characterize America as a beautiful, multicultural sanctuary for technology and innovation. Political issues were largely ignored.

==Reception==
Jon Carroll of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; stated that &quot;Hi sounds a little jaunty under the circumstances&quot; as it was distributed during the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003.

The &quot;Indian Express&quot; posted an editorial arguing that it would be incorrect to characterize the magazine as &quot;subtle&quot; and that &quot;Perhaps Colin Powell&#x27;s deputies are so engrossed in their current project to defeat anti-Americanism that they forget another project that&#x27;s moved apace: Globalisation.&quot;

<text>Sir Malik Feroz Khan Noon (7 May 18939 December 1970) , best known as Feroze Khan, was a Pakistani politician who served as the seventh prime minister of Pakistan from 16 December 1957, until being removed when the President Iskandar Ali Mirza imposed martial law, though he himself got ousted in the 1958 Pakistani military coup.

Trained as a barrister in England, Noon served as High Commissioner of India to the United Kingdom before serving as a military adviser, over issues pertaining to the British Indian Army, to Prime Minister Winston Churchill&#x27;s war ministry from the India Office.

Noon was one of the Founding Fathers of Pakistan who helped to negotiate and establish the Federation of Pakistan as a nation-state on 14 August 1947, resulting from the successful constitutional movement led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah.

==Early life and education==

Feroz Khan Noon was born in the village of Hamoka, located in Khushab District, Punjab in the then British India on 7 May 1893 into a Punjabi family. He came from an aristocratic landowning Rajput family that were known for their wealth and reputation in social circles. The family traces its roots back to a Rajput prince named Raja Ganj and has provided political elite and military officials from the times of Ranjit Singh, Noon&#x27;s ancestors having served in Ranjit Singh&#x27;s army. His father Nawab Malik Sir Muhammad Hayat Khan Noon was a nominated member of the Council of State from 1935 to 1937 while his cousin Malik Sardar Khan Noon was a politician as well.

After his initial schooling, Noon attended Aitchison College in Lahore before being sent to England in 1912. The India Office arranged for him to stay with the family of a Reverend Lloyd in Ticknall, South Derbyshire. From there he applied to study at Oxford University, initially being rejected by Balliol College, he was then accepted by Wadham College. Noon stayed with Lloyd&#x27;s family until 1913, and had a close relationship with them until going to Oxford.

Noon graduated from Wadham College with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in history in 1916. He was a keen soccer player and played collegiate field hockey for Isis Club.

He interacted with very few Indian students while at university, heeding his father&#x27;s advice to learn English culture, and lacked time to attend any Indian cultural festivals because he was concentrating on his studies. His sojourn in Britain left in him a lifelong admiration for Britain and during his career within the Pakistani state, he was always known to be an Anglophile.

After graduation, Noon moved to London to sit the law examination. He qualified as a barrister-at-law from the Inner Temple in 1917 before returning to India.

==Political career==

===Law practice and legislative career in India===

Noon returned to India in September 1917, and in January 1918 began practising law at the District Court in Sargodha. He later moved to the Lahore High Court, establishing his reputation in civil law until 1927.

In 1920–21, Noon entered national politics and was elected to the Punjab Legislative Assembly on the platform of the Unionist Party. During this time, he formed a close acquaintance with Jogendra Singh. From 1927 until 1931, he joined the cabinet of the Governor of Punjab, Malcolm Hailey and held the portfolio of provincial Ministry of Local Government until 1930.

Between 1931 and 1936, Noon was in the cabinets of Governors Geoffrey Fitzhervey de Montmorency, Sir Sikandar Hyat, and Herbert William Emerson where he held provincial portfolios of Ministries of Health and Education.

In December 1932, Noon was appointed as an Officer of the Venerable Order of Saint John. In 1933, Noon was knighted in the 1933 New Year Honours List. He was appointed as Knight Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire (KCIE) in the 1937 Coronation Honours List and appointed as Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of India (KCSI) in October 1941.

===Diplomatic career: World War II and Pakistan Movement===

In 1936, Noon resigned from his public service in Punjab when he was appointed as the High Commissioner of India to the United Kingdom.

Over the issue of the Immigration Act of 1924 in the United States, the British Government directed Noon to Washington D.C. He was accompanied by Nevile Butler of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in 1941 to address issues of American exploration in Baluchistan, and the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status between the United States and the United Kingdom, in light of the Anglo-American Trade Agreement signed in 1938. Noon showed great reluctance to grant American petroleum companies access to Baluchistan due to the Indian government&#x27;s difficulty maintaining control in remote areas adjacent to Iran and Afghanistan, especially when Indians were being barred from entering the United States.

After the start of World War II in 1939, Noon, who had pro-British views, supported British efforts against the Axis powers, lobbying for deployment of the British Indian Army in Africa and the Middle East. In 1940, he strongly supported Egyptian plans to establish the grand mosque in London. During the height of the anti-British Quit India Movement in India, Noon played a crucial role by convincing Prime Minister Winston Churchill of the support of Indian Muslims for continued British rule there.

Khan later joined the Viceroy&#x27;s Executive Council&#x27;s cabinet as a labour minister, and played a crucial role in advising against the Independence of India, without addressing the push of Muhammad Ali Jinnah and other leaders for the Muslim question.

In 1944–45, Churchill appointed Noon to the War Department, leading his own department alongside Sir Arcot Ramasamy Mudaliar that provided representation for British India in the Pacific War Council. In 1945, he was appointed as Permanent Representative of India to the United Nations, attending the first UN session in San Francisco, California.

By late 1945, it became clear that the new Labour government in Britain intended to transfer power and leave India. The impending loss of their British allies weakened the Unionist Party, and Noon joined others in defecting to the Muslim League. His departure was an important one, and encouraged more members to switch parties. The bolstered Muslim League won the 1945-46 Indian general election by a landslide in the Punjab.

===Governorship of East Bengal and Chief Minister of Punjab===

In 1947, Noon retained his constituency and became a Member of the National Assembly of Pakistan (MNA) of the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan, following the establishment of Pakistan as a result of the Partition of India.

In October 1947, Jinnah, now Governor-General of Pakistan, appointed Noon as a special envoy and dispatched him to Saudi Arabia and the Islamic world to introduce Pakistan and explain the reasons for its creation, to familiarize the Muslim countries with its internal problems, and to get moral and financial support from the brother countries. Noon performed the role assigned to him in a successful manner.

In 1950, Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan removed Feroz Noon from the Foreign Ministry, appointing him as the Governor of East Bengal. However, he was less interested in the politics of East Bengal and focused towards the provincial politics of Punjab in Pakistan, contesting with Mumtaz Daultana for the post of Chief Minister. He had little interest in strengthening the political program of the Muslim League in Bengal and offered no political action when the popular Bengali Language Movement took place in 1950–51. On 25 July 1952, he returned to Punjab in Pakistan and left the post to Abdur Rahman Siddiqui, returning to his post on 10  November 1952. Noon left Dhaka to become the Chief Minister of Punjab on 26 March 1953.

After the 1953 religious riots in Lahore that resulted in Daultana&#x27;s resignation, Noon was appointed Chief Minister of Punjab.

===Foreign ministry in coalition administration===

In 1955, Noon parted from the Muslim League when he helped to establish the Republican Party, supporting the cause of the One Unit programme that laid establishment of West and East wings of Pakistan. He took over the presidency of the Republican Party, and joined the coalition of the three-party government composed of, the Awami League, the Muslim League, and the Republican Party that endorsed Iskander Mirza for the presidency. Noon had been ideologically very close to Mirza and was appointed in the coalition cabinet of Prime Minister Huseyn Suhrawardy.

In 1956–57, Noon attempted to hold talks with India over the Kashmir issue, and insurgency in Eastern India, but was unable to make any breakthrough.

===Prime Minister of Pakistan (1957-58)===

After the resignations of the Awami League&#x27;s Huseyn Suhrawardy and the Muslim League&#x27;s I. I. Chundrigar, Noon was the last candidate from the three-party coalition government, and started his support for the premiership on a conservative-Republican Party agenda.

Noon successfully forged an alliance with the Awami League, the National Awami Party, the Krishak Sramik Party, and the parliamentary groups in the National Assembly that allowed him to form the government as its Prime Minister. 
====Negotiation for Gwadar====

On 16 December 1957, Noon took an oath from Chief Justice M. Munir and formed a coalition government. During this time, Noon entered into complicated but successful negotiations with the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman for the cession of Gwadar, which was taken into the Federation of Pakistan on 8 September 1958, for the price of .

Noon&#x27;s ability to get Gwadar into the Federation, and settlement of political issues in the country generally, threatened President Mirza who saw him as an obstacle to Mirza obtaining absolute power. Noon tried to obtain a compromise with India regarding the Kashmir problem.

In his memoirs, &quot;From Memory&quot;, Noon writes, &quot;With Gwadar in foreign hands, I had felt we were living in a house in which the back room with another door, was occupied by a stranger who could, at any time, sell us out to a power inimical to Pakistan…&quot;. The wife of Feroz Khan Noon, Viqar-un-Nisa Noon, also played a large role in the accession of Gwadar to Pakistan. She visited London in 1956 to see the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and to lobby the British Parliament for their protectorate of Muscat and Oman to give custody of &#x27;Gwadar Port&#x27; to Pakistan, and get approval from the House of Lords.

Noon had not endorsed the presidential re-election of Mirza as the three-party coalition had been negotiating their own president to replace Mirza in 1958. At midnight on 7/8 October 1958, Mirza imposed martial law in a coup d&#x27;état against his own party&#x27;s government, effectively dismissing his own appointed Prime Minister to usurp all political power into his own hands.

==Later and personal life, and death==

After the 1958 Pakistani coup d&#x27;état, Noon retired from national politics and became a political writer. He authored five books on the history of India and issues pertaining to law and politics in Pakistan.

Noon was married to Viqar-un-Nisa Noon, an Austrian, who was a prominent politician and a social worker by profession. He died on 7 December 1970 in his ancestral village of Nurpur Noon, Sargodha District, where he is buried.

<text>Riese &amp; Müller is a bicycle manufacturer in Mühltal, Germany. Founded by Markus Riese and Heiko Müller, it designs and makes suspended bicycles. Frames are produced by companies such as Triangle&#x27;s, Portugal. All of their bikes are assembled by hand in Germany.

== History==
===Founding and first model: 1993-1996===
The company was officially founded in 1993. It was founded by Markus Riese and Heiko Müller, who had met studying mechanical engineering in Darmstadt in 1988. After a 1991 cycle trip to Tunisia, they decided they had a shared interest in developing bicycles. In 1992, they started working on the design for a folding bike with the pivot points acting as suspension, but which rode like a normal bike, which hadn&#x27;t been done before. According to &quot;Wired Magazine,&quot; the two German mechanical engineers in 1992 &quot;realized that if you give a bike full suspension, those points of suspension can double as points of rotation for a folding bike. Less than a year later, Müller read about the Hesse Innovation Prize and built an aluminum prototype in ten days (and nights).&quot; In 1993, they submitted their bike for the 1993 Hesse Innovation Award, and the Birdy won the Special Award.

The Birdy was showcased under the company name riese und müller at Intercycle in Cologne and Eurobike in Friedrichshafen in 1993 and 1994. They company also showcased other products, including an invention to keep ears warm under bike helmets. They received little interest until George Lin, a businessperson from Taiwan, wanted to build the Birdy. George Lin had founded Pacific Cycles, an original equipment manufacturer (OEM). In 1994 and 1995, the Birdy was built into a production-ready prototype, with the founders raising the funds to have 250 Birdys initially produced in Taiwan. The company headquarters was an old dairy farm in Darmstadt. Pacific Cycles began manufacturing the Birdy. The Birdy sold well in 1995 and 1996, and was also sold in the United States and Japan.

Riese &amp; Müller was founded in 1993 to sell &quot;Hot Ears&quot;, earmuffs to keep the ears warm while wearing a helmet. The first bicycle, the folding bicycle known as the Birdy, started in the garage of Heiko Müller&#x27;s parents as a university project. In 2006 it started selling Zwei bike bags.

===Other models and e-bikes: 1997-2024===
In 1997, the company began creating new bikes for urban riding and touring. In 2008, the company began incorporating motors, including electric versions of the Birdy and their Delite model. Their Jetstream electric model won the Eurobike Green Award. The company subsequently focused on electric bikes, with all model ranges except the Birdy converted solely to pedelecs. The company&#x27;s new Packster 40 cargo bike was presented at Eurobike 2017 and won a Eurobike Award. Riese &amp; Müller had a revenue of €76 million a year.

Economist Sandra Wolf became a third CEO in 2019. In 2022, it had sales of 350 million euros. The company&#x27;s Carrie cargo bike, released in 2024, was priced at £5,469. The aluminum frame was manufactured in Portugal. The Birdy P40 bike is still produced by Pacific Cycles. The company currently has a campus in Mühltal, Germany. Wolf remains CEO.

<doc id="1338332" wikidata="Q213159" url="?curid=1338332" title="Archimandrite">
<text>The title archimandrite (; ), used in Eastern Christianity, originally referred to a superior abbot (&quot;hegumenos&quot;, , present participle of the verb meaning &quot;to lead&quot;) whom a bishop appointed to supervise several &quot;ordinary&quot; abbots and monasteries, or as the abbot of some especially great and important monastery.

In the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Eastern Catholic Churches, &quot;archimandrite&quot; is most often used purely as a title of honor (with no connection to any actual monastery) and is bestowed on a hieromonk as a mark of respect or gratitude for service to the Church. This title is only given to those priests who have been tonsured monks, while distinguished non-monastic (typically married) priests would be given the title of protopresbyter. In history, some women were able to obtain that title, notably when cross-dressing as male monks, such as Susanna the Deaconess.

== History ==

The term &quot;&quot; derives from the Greek: the first element from &quot;archi-&quot; meaning &quot;highest&quot; or from &quot;archon&quot; &quot;ruler&quot;; and the second root from &quot;mandra&quot; meaning &quot;enclosure&quot; or &quot;corral&quot;, &quot;pen&quot; and denoting a &quot;monastery&quot; (compare the usage of &quot;flock&quot; for &quot;congregation&quot;).

The title has been in common use since the 5th century, but is mentioned for the first time in a letter to Epiphanius, prefixed to his &quot;Panarium&quot; (), but the &quot;Lausiac History&quot; of Palladius may evidence its common use in the 4th century as applied to Saint Pachomius.

When the supervision of monasteries passed to another episcopal official—the Great Sakellarios (&quot;sacristan&quot;)—the title of archimandrite became an honorary one for abbots of important monasteries (compared to an ordinary abbot, a hegumenos).

== Byzantine usage ==

The Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine Catholic churches commonly select their bishops from the ranks of the archimandrites.

As abbots, the duties of both a hegumen and an archimandrite are the same; however, during the Divine Service, a hegumen wears a simple mantle, while the mantle of an archimandrite is decorated with sacral texts; an archimandrite also bears a pastoral staff (&quot;pateritsa&quot;).

===Kiev Metropolis===
Initially, in some cases it served as an extra title: for example, manuscripts of 1174 mention Hegumen Polikarp of Kiev Cave Monastery as &quot;Hegumen Archimandrite&quot;.

=== Russian usage ===
In 1764, the Russian Orthodox Church organized its monasteries and ranked them in one of three classes, awarding only the abbots at the head of monasteries of the second or first class the title of archimandrite. Abbots of third class monasteries were to be styled &quot;hegumen&quot;.

In the Russian tradition, an archimandrite wears a mitre.

===Greek usage===
Churches under the spiritual jurisdiction of the four ancient Eastern Orthodox Patriarchates generally require that such a monastic priest possess a university degree in theology before he is elevated to the rank of archimandrite. Sometimes, the requirement is waived if the priest can show outstanding achievement in other academic fields, such as the humanities or science.

==Western usage==

An archimandrite who does not function as an abbot has the style &quot;The Very Reverend Archimandrite&quot; whilst one with abbatial duties uses the style &quot;The Right Reverend Archimandrite&quot;.

The word occurs in the &quot;Regula Columbani&quot; (c. 7), and du Cange gives a few other cases of its use in Latin documents, but it never came into vogue in the West; yet, owing to intercourse with Greek and Slavonic Christianity, the title sometimes appears in southern Italy and Sicily, and in Croatia, Hungary and Poland. From 1979, there is at least one exemplar in Britain.

<text>The Boyne Viaduct (), a railway bridge, or viaduct, that crosses the River Boyne in Drogheda, carrying the main Dublin–Belfast railway line.

==History==
The viaduct was designed by the Irish civil engineer Sir John Benjamin Macneill using new mathematical stress analysis developed just a few years before by William Bindon Blood at Queen&#x27;s College, Galway. Construction began on the bridge in 1853 and was completed in 1855. It was the seventh bridge of its kind in the world when built, and considered one of the wonders of the age.

Before its construction, railway passengers had to make their way through the town of Drogheda from the stations on either side of the River Boyne until the construction of a temporary wooden bridge, which allowed trains to cross the river from May 1853 until the completion of the viaduct.

During World War II, the viaduct was identified by the British as being of great strategic importance as part of the British plans for a counter-attack following a German invasion of Ireland.

2005 marked the 150th anniversary of the viaduct, and Iarnród Éireann and the Railway Preservation Society of Ireland ran a special service operated by a steam locomotive between Drogheda railway station and Dundalk.

==Description== 

The viaduct comprises twelve stone arches on the south side and a further three on the north. It is located near a tight curve, which necessitates the slowing of trains as they approach. The central Pratt truss bridge was originally made of three iron spans that originally carried two tracks.

When the bridge was refurbished in the 1930s, new steel girders replacing the ironworks were constructed inside the original bridge before the iron structure was removed. This allowed trains to continue running throughout the renewal process; however, the new bridge was no longer wide enough to carry two tracks. The northbound and southbound tracks were interlaced so that one rail lay between the tracks in the opposite direction, as points and a single track would have required a signal cabin on the north side of the viaduct.

In 1932, the three spans over the river were replaced with the current iron trusses. These were built by the &quot;Motherwell Bridge Engineering Company&quot; with G.B. Howden as the chief engineer.

When the tracks were relaid in the 1990s, singling was introduced, and the interlaced tracks were replaced with a single track over the viaduct and points at each side.

The structure has been listed by the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage as a heritage structure.

==Refurbishment==
Over €6.1m was awarded for the refurbishment of the Boyne Viaduct financed through the European Union&#x27;s INTERREG IVA Programme. The project involved several essential refurbishment activities, including steel repairs and full repainting, renewal of work over the viaduct, waterproofing of the deck, and installation of a new drainage system. The project was officially completed on 7 December 2015.

<text>DV8 is a comic book published by Wildstorm. The series revolves around the lives of a group of Gen-Active people (Called DV8, or referred to as &quot;The Deviants&quot;), initially living in New York City under the supervision of Ivana Baiul, who sends them on life-threatening black ops assignments.

==Publication history==

The series lasted 32 issues. The story including most DV8 members continued in the pages of &quot;Gen-Active&quot;, an anthology series featuring various Wildstorm characters. &quot;Gen-Active,&quot; lasted 6 issues.

Writer Micah Ian Wright pitched a relaunch to WildStorm in 2003, but it was not picked up by the publisher. The artist in the book would have been Mark Robinson.

The title returned in June 2010 as an eight-issue limited series called &quot;DV8: Gods and Monsters&quot;, written by Brian Wood with art by Rebekah Isaacs. The project is something Wood had been trying to get commissioned for years:

* Threshold (Matthew Callahan) - Field commander of the Deviants until he betrayed the team and went rogue. He has psionic powers and is very powerful and extremely psychotic. Until going rogue, he was Ivana&#x27;s romance, then occasionally to Bliss, and later to a sex toy. He is also a half-brother of Sarah Rainmaker.
* Sublime (Rachel Goldman) - Has the ability to alter the density of her body from intangible to rock-hard. Generally, she is tough and does not take crap from anyone.
* Bliss (Nicole Callahan) - Has the ability to stimulate human senses to the point of cardiac arrest and some psychic abilities. Generally, she is immoral and very capable of getting men to give her what she wants. She even was able to seduce her older brother, Threshold (Matthew Callahan). She may be very dangerous, though the Deviants are unaware of that.
* Frostbite (Leon Carver) - Has the ability to absorb heat from any source and leave it ice-cold. Generally, he is the least screwed-up member of the Deviants. After Threshold went rogue, Frostbite was appointed to the team leader, but he was banished by Ivana after losing his powers. Later he faked his death to get off Ivana&#x27;s radar.

Due to an earlier incident, she has four split personalities in addition to her normal persona, as evidenced by a change in the word-balloon font. When ex-team-leader Threshold betrayed the Deviants, he altered Gem&#x27;s mind and isolated Gem&#x27;s main personality, preventing the real Gem Antonelli from ever speaking, leaving Gem&#x27;s body to be occupied only by her other split personalities.
** Soldier (tough)
** Nihilist (rebellious)
** Spy (methodical)
** Little Gemma (cowardly and sweet)
*** At the end of the series, it is revealed that Bliss was the actual cause of Copycat&#x27;s multiple personalities, and whilst in a feedback loop from Freeway, she emerged without them.
* Evo (Michael Heller) - Has the ability to change into forms similar to a wolf, bat, or amphibian. Generally, he is very insensitive and otherwise dark in demeanor.
* Freestyle (Jocelyn Davis) - Has the ability to affect probability by psionically choosing the most favorable course of action based on a number of timelines. She is also very acrobatic and flexible.She was originally frozen in a cryogenic tube for the first few issues. Generally, she is upbeat and not unstable like the others.
* Sideways Bob - Guardian of the group. He has no powers and is psychotic and dangerous. He&#x27;s missing an eye and lacks hair, and he carries around a disembodied mannequin head he calls Lucille. He told Sublime that she could be his &quot;special awake friend&quot;. She didn&#x27;t know if that was good or not.

<doc id="1338374" wikidata="Q6859894" url="?curid=1338374" title="Millmount Fort">
<text>Millmount is a large fortified complex situated on a great mound on the South bank of the River Boyne located in Drogheda, County Louth, Ireland. The fort has played a crucial part in Drogheda&#x27;s history and has been a dominant feature from Norman settlement, to Cromwell&#x27;s invasion to the more recent Civil War in 1922, in which the famous Martello tower was shelled and all but destroyed. Today the complex houses the Millmount Museum which houses a wide variety of artifacts of local and national importance. The complex is Drogheda&#x27;s most dominant feature, clearly visible from all parts of the town. The Martello tower is affectionately known as &quot;The Cup and Saucer&quot; by locals. The whole fort is a national monument and has been designated as Drogheda&#x27;s Cultural Quarter.

==History==

It has been fortified in historical times since the early 12th Century CE when the invading Normans built a motte and bailey on what was probably originally a neolithic passage grave similar to Newgrange. In Irish cosmology, it is often assumed to be the burial place of Amhairgin mac Míled, whose name (&quot;Amhair&quot; = singing; &quot;gin&quot; = give birth) indicates that in ancient Irish mythology he was regarded as the originator of the arts of song, poetry and music. The shamanistic Early Irish poem &quot;The Song of Amhairgin&quot;, uttered by him in the story of his entry into Ireland by the River Boyne, was therefore conventionally regarded as the first Irish poem.

Hugh De Lacy, one of the Normans who came to Ireland after Strongbow, built the original fort circa 1172, having been granted the Kingdom of Meath by Henry II. Later a stone castle was built on the site. This castle formed part of the defences of the town during the siege of Drogheda during the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland in 1649. The fort&#x27;s English defenders attempted to surrender to Parliamentarian troops under Oliver Cromwell but were massacred when they gave themselves up on 11 September 1649.

The complex was later called Richmond Barracks. Some of the present buildings, in the courtyard, were built circa 1714. After the unrest and rebellions of the 1790s and the Act of Union in 1800 the complex was re-fortified and the present tower built. The fort suffered considerable damage during the Irish Civil War. It was occupied by Anti-Treaty forces and on 4 July 1922, it became the target of shelling by the army of the Irish Free State. The Free State Forces under Michael Collins had been given extensive support by the British Army at the express wish of Winston Churchill who insisted that the Republican Forces be crushed. Using the same British Army 18-pounder artillery piece which had shelled the Republican H.Q. in the Four Courts in Dublin some days earlier the Free State Forces bombarded Millmount fort for several hours before the Republican garrison retreated. It has been restored in 2000 and is now open to the public as a military museum.

==Museum==

The Museum houses a wide variety of artifacts of local and national importance. Chief amongst the attractions is the unique collection of Guild and Trade Banners. This collection is recognised by Ireland&#x27;s National Museum as being of special significance and includes the only remaining guild banners in Ireland. Popular exhibits at the Millmount Museum include an authentic 18th century Irish folk kitchen, dairy and laundry, and the Irish History Room which details the major events in Ireland&#x27;s history.

<text>Cambozola is a cow&#x27;s milk cheese that is a combination in style of a French soft-ripened triple cream cheese and Italian Gorgonzola.

== History ==
Cambozola was patented and industrially produced for the global market by the German company Hofmeister-Champignon. The cheese has been sold since 1983 and is still produced by Champignon. In English-speaking countries, Cambozola is often marketed as blue brie.

It is made from a combination of &quot;Penicillium camemberti&quot; and the same blue &quot;Penicillium roqueforti&quot; mould used to make Gorgonzola, Roquefort, and Stilton. Extra cream is added to the milk, giving Cambozola a rich consistency characteristic of triple crèmes, while the edible bloomy rind is similar to that of Camembert. Cambozola is considerably milder than Gorgonzola piccante and features a smooth, creamy texture with a subdued blue flavour.

The cheese&#x27;s name is a combination of the names Camembert and Gorgonzola. It also refers to Cambodunum, the Roman name of Kempten, the city where Champignon is located.

<doc id="1338378" wikidata="Q1062233" url="?curid=1338378" title="Channel-associated signaling">
<text>Channel-associated signaling (CAS), also known as &quot;per-trunk signaling&quot; (PTS), is a form of digital communication signaling. As with most telecommunication signaling methods, it uses routing information to direct the payload of voice or data to its destination. With CAS, this routing information is encoded and transmitted in the same channel as the payload itself. This information can be transmitted in the same band (in-band signaling) or a separate band (out-of-band signaling) to the payload. Call setup will be comparatively slower since signaling channels are shared thus congestion can be faced.

CAS potentially results in lower available bandwidth for the payload. For example, in the PSTN the use of out-of-band signaling within a fixed bandwidth reduces a 64 kbit/s DS0 to 56 kbit/s. Because of this, and the inherent security benefits of separating the control lines from the payload, telephone systems introduced since the 1960s rely more on common-channel signaling (CCS).

The most common implementation of CAS is robbed-bit signaling.

<text>Deborah Anne Dyer (born 3 August 1967), known mononymously by the stage name Skin and often erroneously as the name of her band Skunk Anansie, is a British singer, musician and songwriter. She is the lead vocalist of Skunk Anansie, who are often grouped as part of the Britrock movement in the UK, and has gained attention for her powerful, wide-ranging soprano voice and striking look.

In 2015, Skin joined the judging panel of the Italian version of the talent show &quot;The X Factor&quot; for one season, and in 2016 she was on the cover of the UK lesbian magazine &quot;Diva&quot;. After releasing new music and touring with Skunk Anansie, in 2018 Skin was featured as one of the cover stars of &quot;Classic Rock&quot; magazine&#x27;s special &quot;She Rocks&quot; issue and was honoured with the Inspirational Artist Award at the Music Week Awards ahead of celebrating 25 years of Skunk Anansie. She also appeared on the cover of &quot;Kerrang!&quot; magazine in November 2018.

Mavis Bayton, author of &quot;Frock Rock&quot;, stated that &quot;women like Skin, Natacha Atlas, Yolanda Charles, and Debbie Smith are now acting as crucial role models for future generations of black women&quot;.

== Early life ==
Deborah Ann Dyer was born on 3 August 1967 in Brixton, London, to Jamaican parents. Her father was in the Royal Air Force and later worked on oil rigs. Her mother was a nurse before taking a government position in the environmental department. She describes her parents as &quot;very strict, very Jamaican&quot;. At the age of 6, she moved into a two-up two-down in Acre Lane, with her grandfather, who ran a nightclub in the basement, in which she mentions there was &quot;always music and rum&quot; and posters of Bob Marley and Muhammad Ali, which inspired her. As a child, she wanted to be a pianist. At the age of 14, she read &quot;Macbeth&quot;, later stating that she loved the &quot;intricacy and complexity of Shakespeare&#x27;s play&quot;.

== Skunk Anansie ==

The band formed in 1994, releasing three albums, &quot;Paranoid &amp; Sunburnt&quot;, &quot;Stoosh&quot; and &quot;Post Orgasmic Chill&quot;. They sold more than five million records worldwide. Their biggest hit was the single &quot;Weak&quot;. They disbanded in 2001, after which Skin embarked on a solo career, and reformed in 2009. As of 2024 the band have released six studio albums and toured with David Bowie, U2, and Lenny Kravitz.

== Solo career ==

After Skunk Anansie split, Skin released her debut solo album &quot;Fleshwounds&quot;. The album was toned down from her Skunk Anansie days and did not gain the same acclaim from Skunk Anansie fans. She even ditched her trademark bald look and grew her hair into a boyish crop. While the album was not a massive success in the UK, two singles were released from it: &quot;Trashed&quot; and &quot;Faithfulness&quot;. &quot;Lost&quot;, a double A-side with &quot;Getting Away with It&quot;. Skin felt that her record company didn&#x27;t put any money or effort into promoting the album in England. She felt they did better in Europe with the album selling over half a million copies.

After releasing &quot;Fleshwounds&quot;, Skin went on to perform various solo gigs around Europe. She was also support for the European leg of Robbie Williams&#x27; and Placebo&#x27;s world tours.

Soon after touring she began to record her second album, &quot;Fake Chemical State&quot;, which was released for sale on 20 March 2006, preceded by new single &quot;Just Let the Sun&quot; two weeks earlier. The first single actually issued from this album was &quot;Alone in My Room&quot;, a download-only track released on 7 November 2005. &quot;Alone in My Room&quot; was also the name given to Skin&#x27;s first solo tour in two years, which commenced in Berlin in November 2005. For this album she shaved her head bald again, returning to the look she had in her Skunk Anansie days.

Skin&#x27;s next solo outing was a small promotional &quot;Fake Chemical State&quot; tour. It started in Glasgow on 17 March 2006. She went on to perform many festivals around Europe including Rock Werchter in Belgium and the Southside/Hurricane festivals in Germany. She performed on the main stage at most of these festivals.

In February 2008, she announced that she was working with Timo Maas and Martin Buttrich on a side project called &quot;Format-3&quot;. Her 2008 song &quot;Tear Down These Houses&quot; was released as a part of the soundtrack to &quot;Parlami d&#x27;Amore&quot;, directed by Silvio Muccino.

She sings in the opening musical piece &quot;Renaissance&quot;, in &quot;&quot;, a Netflix original series released in October 2016.

Skin has always had a love of electronic music and she moved into the genre when her friend Damian Lazarus gave her a mixer in 2009. Going under the moniker D-Dyer she made her first steps into the DJ world which she has now been doing for the past decade. She plays Techno, Tech House and Minimal all over the world at classic venues such as Output in New York, Sound Nightclub in LA and Fabric in London.

In 2015 Skin collaborated with techno icon Nicole Moudaber and they released the Breed EP on Nicole&#x27;s Mood Records. It features five tracks including &quot;Don&#x27;t Talk To Me I&#x27;m Dancing&quot;. In 2016 she DJ-ed at Carl Cox&#x27;s Revolution in Ibiza, Coachella and also released Techno music under the guise of Juvenal through Mood Records.

In 2020, Skin participated in the UK version of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot;, appearing as Duck. Her identity was revealed in episode six, when she was eliminated. A memoir, &quot;It Takes Blood and Guts&quot;, co-written with Lucy O&#x27;Brien, was published by Simon &amp; Schuster in September 2020. On 18 October 2020, Skin began presenting a Sunday-night radio show titled &quot;The Skin Show&quot; on Absolute Radio.

==Personal life==
Skin graduated with a BA (Hons) degree in Interior Architecture &amp; Design from Teesside Polytechnic in 1989 and received an honorary Master of Arts degree from Teesside University in 2000.
Skin is openly queer. In 2013, she entered into a civil partnership with Christiana Wyly, daughter of American billionaire Sam Wyly. The relationship ended in 2015. In September 2020, Skin announced her engagement to Rayne Baron. They have a daughter, born in 2021.

In January 2021, Skin assumed the role of Chancellor at Leeds Arts University in Leeds, England.

Since the United Kingdom European Union membership referendum in 2016, Skin has talked against Brexit and its effect in terms of rise in racism, labour shortage and impoverishment of British culture in numerous interviews.

She was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2021 Birthday Honours for services to music.

After the results of the 2022 Italian election were announced, Skin said that she was disappointed that the Italian people voted for Giorgia Meloni and said that Italy was &quot;sinking towards fascism&quot; once again.

<doc id="1338388" wikidata="Q1365552" url="?curid=1338388" title="Sacristan">
<text>A sacristan is an officer charged with care of the sacristy, the church, and their contents.

In ancient times, many duties of the sacrist were performed by the doorkeepers (ostiarii), and later by the treasurers and mansionarii. The Decretals of Gregory IX speak of the sacristan as if he had an honourable office attached to a certain benefice, and say that his duty was to care for the sacred vessels, vestments, lights, etc. Nowadays the sacristan is elected or appointed. The &quot;Cæremoniale Episcoporum&quot; prescribed that in cathedral and collegiate churches the sacristan should be a priest, and describes his duties in regard to the sacristy, the Blessed Eucharist, the baptismal font, the holy oils, the sacred relics, the decoration of the church for the different seasons and feasts, the preparation of what is necessary for the various ceremonies, the pregustation in pontifical Mass, the ringing of the church bells, the preservation of order in the church, and the distribution of Masses; finally it suggests that one or two canons be appointed each year to supervise the work of the sacrist and his assistants.

In the Old Testament, the office and duties of the sacristan are assigned to the Levites. 1 Chronicles 23-26 describes how David assigned them duties such as temple doorkeepers, guardians, singers and musicians.

==Custos==

The under-sacristan is also mentioned in the Decretals. He was the assistant of the sacristan, was subject to the archdeacon and discharged duties very similar to those of the sacristan. By the early twentieth century, the office was hardly ever attached to a benefice and so usually a salaried position. The Council of Trent desired that according to the old canons, clerics should hold such offices; but in most churches, on account of the difficulty or impossibility of obtaining clerics, laymen perform many of the duties of the sacristan and under-sacristan.

In some European medieval contexts, a &quot;custos&quot; was given the more important roles of keeping the safety of the church, its relics, its treasure, and its archives, but was also responsible for the perception of &quot;capitationes&quot;, symbolic head-taxes that associated freemen with a religious institution.

==Altar societies==
Altar societies were once commonly organised within most Catholic parish churches. Member duties vary according to circumstances, and in some instances include tasks that ordinarily fall within the sacristan&#x27;s province, such as the vestments and altar vessels, making ready for the priest&#x27;s Mass. In general, they consist of the payment of yearly dues into a fund for maintenance and repair of accessories used in Church ceremonies, and usually also include a certain amount of labour for this purpose. Altar societies differ from tabernacle societies in that they work for the benefit of the church they are attached to while tabernacle societies work for the benefit of many different poor churches.

==Eastern Churches==
In the Eastern Churches, the sacristan is known as the &quot;ecclesiarch&quot;, particularly in monasteries. In large monasteries he may be assigned an assistant known as the &quot;paraecclesiarch&quot;. An analogous office is that of the &quot;skeuophylax&quot;. In parishes, however, the sacristan is called sexton. In addition to the tasks and responsibilities mentioned above, if an individual has a message for the priest while serving in the sanctuary, it is given to the sexton to give to the priest or deacon.

==Academia==
Many Christian-faith schools appoint sacristans as members of their prefect bodies, particularly in public schools and institutions founded on the English model. For instance, the in Sewanee, Tennessee, an Episcopal university, hosts a student Sacristans Guild. Sacristans aid the school&#x27;s chaplain in the day-to-day running of the chapel and promotion of a Christian ethos in the school. In terms of seniority, they are often regarded as second only to the school captains.

<doc id="1338390" wikidata="Q6682058" url="?curid=1338390" title="Los Angeles General Medical Center">
<text>Los Angeles General Medical Center (also known as LA General and formerly known as Los Angeles County+USC Medical Center, County/USC, County General or by the abbreviation LAC+USC) is a 600-bed public teaching hospital located at 2051 Marengo Street in the Boyle Heights neighborhood of Los Angeles, California, and one of the largest academic medical centers in the United States. The hospital facility is owned by Los Angeles County and operated by the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services. Doctors are faculty of the Keck School of Medicine of USC, who oversee more than 1,000 medical residents being trained by the faculty. Additionally, the United States Navy sends doctors, nurses and corpsmen to train at the hospital, working alongside staff in the trauma center.

The facility is one of two adult Level I trauma centers (providing the highest level of surgical care to trauma patients) operated by Los Angeles County; the other is Harbor–UCLA Medical Center.

The hospital was renamed in 2023 to a name resembling its original name, due to confusion with the privately operated Keck Hospital of USC located a half mile away.

== Operations ==
Los Angeles General Medical Center is one of the largest public hospitals and medical training centers in the United States, and the largest single provider of healthcare in Los Angeles County. It provides healthcare services for the region&#x27;s medically underserved, is a Level I trauma center and treats over 28 percent of the region&#x27;s trauma victims (2005). It provides care for half of all sickle-cell anemia patients and those people living with AIDS in Southern California.
Los Angeles General Medical Center provides a full spectrum of emergency, inpatient and outpatient services to all including indigent and Medi-Cal only recipients. These include medical, surgical, emergency/trauma, obstetrical, gynecological and pediatric services as well as psychiatric services for adults, adolescents and children.

Los Angeles General Medical Center is one of the busiest public hospitals in the Western United States, with nearly 39,000 inpatients discharged, and one million ambulatory care patient visits each year. The Emergency Department is one of the world&#x27;s busiest, with more than 150,000 visits per year. LA General operates one of only three burn centers in Los Angeles County and one of the few Level III Neonatal Intensive Care Units in Southern California. LA General is also the home of the Los Angeles County College of Nursing and Allied Health, which has prepared registered nurses for professional practice since its founding in 1895.

Los Angeles General Medical Center also serves as the host facility for the Navy Trauma Training Center, allowing uniformed medical professionals valuable exposure to trauma cases during 30 day clinical rotations that prepare them to treat battlefield injury on the front lines with the United States Marine Corps, at sea with the United States Navy, or ashore at Fleet Hospitals and Shock Trauma Platoons.

In 2013, American Cancer Society awarded Los Angeles General Medical Center with the Harold P. Freeman Award in recognition of the hospital&#x27;s achievements to reduce cancer disparities among medically underserved populations.

== New facility ==

The original hospital, located at 1200 North State Street, opened in 1933. Designed by the coalition of architects Allied Architects Association, its Art-Deco construction earned it the nickname the &quot;Great Stone Mother&quot; and had 3,000 patient beds. The 1994 Northridge earthquake on January 17, 1994, renewed concerns about building safety codes, and specifically those for hospitals. The California Hospital Seismic Safety Law was signed into law on September 21, 1994. The new law took the 1200 State Street building out of compliance of earthquake and fire safety codes.

To address the problem, a new modern facility was proposed and constructed nearby, at 2051 Marengo Street. Designed by a joint venture of HOK and LBL Associated Architects, the new $1 billion hospital consists of three linked buildings: a clinic tower, a diagnostic and treatment tower, and an inpatient tower, in total supporting 600 patient beds. The new facility has a larger number of intensive care beds to handle patients in the aftermath of disasters.

The new facility was ready by 2010, and on July 23 of that year, the new hospital was opened. Transfer of all inpatients from Women&#x27;s and Children&#x27;s Hospital and the 1200 State Street building made the retirement of the original hospital complex official. 

The old building at 1200 State Street still stands. The Wellness Center, on the first floor of the old building, was opened in 2014. It is open to the public and includes offices for nonprofit organizations, community outreach and classes for wellness activities, a dance studio, a small YMCA on State Street, and extensive new landscaping. While this building no longer meets the California Hospital Seismic Safety Law, it does meet current seismic standards for non-hospital use.

In 2020, the original pediatrics and obstetrics ward was torn down in order to be replaced by affordable housing.

== History ==
The Los Angeles County Hospital and the University of Southern California Medical School were first affiliated in 1885, five years after USC was founded. It was originally established as a 100-bed hospital with 47 patients. The present-day LA General complex is adjacent to the University of Southern California Health Sciences Campus, which includes the USC Keck School of Medicine, USC School of Pharmacy, Keck Hospital of USC, and the USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center and Hospital.

== Transportation ==
The LA General Medical Center station on the El Monte Busway for the Metro J Line and Foothill Transit Silver Streak is located within walking distance from LA General. Additionally, Metro lines 78, 106, 251, 605 serve the hospital.

<doc id="1338396" wikidata="Q2630562" url="?curid=1338396" title="Rebirth of Mothra III">
<text>is a 1998 Japanese &quot;kaiju&quot; film directed by Okihiro Yoneda, written by Masumi Suetani, and produced by Shōgo Tomiyama. Produced and distributed by Toho Studios, it is the final film in the &quot;Rebirth of Mothra&quot; trilogy, following the previous year&#x27;s &quot;Rebirth of Mothra II&quot;.

&quot;Rebirth of Mothra III&quot; stars Megumi Kobayashi, Misato Tate, Aki Hano, Atsushi Ohnita, and Miyuki Matsuda, and features the giant monster characters Rainbow Mothra and King Ghidorah. The film was released theatrically in Japan on December 12, 1998, and was released in the United States as a Sci-Fi Channel TV premiere on May 31, 2003. However, despite its predecessors being released on DVD in 2000, the film did not receive a North American home media release until 2014, when all three films were released on a Blu-ray bundle by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment.

==Plot==

The Elias sisters, Moll and Lora, attempt to stop their vengeful sister, Belvera from seeking the secret power of the Elias Triangle, three power units that can transform the sisters&#x27; daggers into powerful swords. Belvera succeeds, but is thwarted by her sisters&#x27; pet, Fairy, and fails to retrieve the proper unit for her dagger while Moll and Lora end up with one for the former.

The next day, preteen Shota ditches school to investigate a meteor that recently landed in Aoki Forest, while children from across the city mysteriously vanish. Upon examining the meteor&#x27;s remains, Moll and Lora deduce King Ghidorah, a three-headed space dragon who had invaded Earth and killed the dinosaurs, has returned to capture the children and placed them in an organic dome to feed upon. The pair summon their ally, Rainbow Mothra, to fight Ghidorah, but after a brief battle, the dragon overpowers Mothra and hypnotizes Lora, forcing her to attack Moll before attempting to drag them both into the dome. Lora falls inside but Moll is rescued by Fairy. Intrigued by Ghidorah&#x27;s arrival, Belvera investigates, but gets dragged into the dome as well.

While regrouping with Mothra, Moll befriends Shota, who learned his siblings Shuehei and Tamako were among those captured. Moll tells Shota about Ghidorah&#x27;s plan to feed on the children&#x27;s life force. After the two encounter Mothra, Moll and Mothra devise a plan where Mothra travels back in time to confront a younger Ghidorah, with Moll using all of her powers to send Mothra there. Afterward, Moll gives Shota her dagger and asks him to enter the dome to find Lora and convince her to help Mothra battle Ghidorah. After Shota reluctantly agrees, Moll collapses and falls into a state of suspended animation. In the dome, Belvera encounters Lora and informs her of Ghidorah&#x27;s plans to destroy Earth. Still under the monster&#x27;s spell, Lora takes Belvera&#x27;s unit, transforms her dagger, and engages her sister in combat. 

Belvera begs Lora to see reason and work with her, but to no avail. Shota, letting himself get sent inside the dome, soon finds Lora and urges her to help Mothra; however, she attacks him. Belvera stops Lora and Shota helps her break free of Ghidorah&#x27;s spell. As Lora passes out, her dagger combines with Moll&#x27;s. Realizing the Elias Triangle represents her and her sisters, Belvera uses her dagger and unit to merge with the other swords, transforming into one super sword and uses it in attempts to break the dome.

At Shota&#x27;s urging, Lora sends her powers to Mothra, allowing her to immobilize Ghidorah, defeating him by dropping him in a volcano, but unaware a severed piece of the dragon&#x27;s tail burrowed underground. Grievously injured during the fight and burnt from the volcano, Mothra crashes to the ground. However, three ancient Mothra larvae appear and encase Mothra in a silk cocoon, allowing her to rest and recover from her injuries.

In the present, Ghidorah and the dome disappear, freeing the captives. Shota reunites with his siblings and join Belvera and Lora as they stand vigil over Moll. Suddenly, Ghidorah, having regenerated from the severed tail, reemerges and recaptures the children. Belvera and Lora join forces to fight Ghidorah and Mothra emerges from her cocoon as Armor Mothra. Using her new powers, she combats and disintegrates Ghidorah into ashes, saving everyone from his wrath. Afterward, she evolves into Eternal Mothra and tells Belvera and Lora to channel their powers through their sword to revive Moll. After they do so, the sword disappears, and Moll revives. After a brief touching reunion of all three Elias sisters, Belvera flies off. As the children are released once more and reunite with their parents, Shota and his family watch as Moll, Lora, Fairy, and Mothra fly off into the sunset.
