<text>Robert T. Lincoln Poston (February 25, 1891 – March 16, 1924) was an African-American newspaper editor and journalist, who was an activist in Marcus Garvey&#x27;s Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA). He died at sea as he returned from a UNIA mission to Liberia.

==Biography==
Poston was born in Hopkinsville, Kentucky. He came from a family of journalists and writers. His father, Ephraim Poston, was a teacher, poet and graduate of Roger Williams University in Nashville, Tennessee, who authored &quot;Manual on Parliamentary Proceedings&quot;, 1905, and &quot;Pastoral Poems&quot;, 1906. Poston&#x27;s mother was the former Mollie Cox of Oak Grove, Kentucky. Poston had six siblings: Fred Douglass, Ulysses Grant, Ephraim, Jr., Roberta, Lillian, and Theodore Roosevelt Poston.

Poston attended Nashville&#x27;s Walden University, as well as Howard University. He became a newspaper publisher and editor while in Detroit, Michigan. Later, he contributed poems, literary criticism, and sometimes editorials to the UNIA-ACL&#x27;s &quot;Negro World&quot; newspaper. He attained the position of Assistant Secretary-General of the UNIA in 1921 and then was promoted to Secretary General in 1922. His brother Ulysses served as associate editor of the &quot;Negro World&quot;. Robert and Ulysses were among the co-directors of a play the UNIA dramatic club put on in 1922, entitled &quot;Tallaboo&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Poston married the sculptor Augusta Savage in 1923. 

== Death ==
In December of 1923, he was the leader of a delegation sent to Liberia by the UNIA. The purpose of the trip was to finalize arrangements for a mass emigration of African Americans to Liberia. He was accompanied on this trip by Henrietta Vinton Davis and Milton Van Lowe, among others. Poston and the others met with President King of Liberia, but they were not ultimately able to obtain the permissions and aid that they required. Poston could not hide his disappointment on the voyage home. While on board the SS &quot;President Grant&quot;, he contracted a fever and died of lobar pneumonia.

== Legacy ==
On March 19, 1924, Poston was posthumously given the rank of Prince of Africa by the UNIA during an elaborate state funeral at Liberty Hall.

<text>Neu Wien (&quot;New Vienna&quot;), opus 342, is a waltz written by Johann Strauss II in 1870 and dedicated to Nicolaus Dumba (1830-1900), who was a fervent patron of Arts and was the Chairman of the Wiener Männergesang-Verein (Vienna&#x27;s Men Choral Association) and Vice-President of the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde in Wien (Society of Friends of Music in Vienna).

New Vienna was written in the form of a choral waltz at the request of the Choral Association and was first performed at the Fasching of 1870 for the Association&#x27;s &#x27;Narrenabend&#x27; (Fool&#x27;s Evening) where Strauss had similarly dedicated his waltz Wein, Weib und Gesang op. 333 for the same festivity. Strauss himself did not perform the choral work at its première on 13 February 1870 because of a commitment to the Prince Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst to provide music for the latter&#x27;s ball on exactly the same day as the Association&#x27;s &#x27;Narrenabend&#x27;. The new work was therefore entrusted to the musicians of the 49th (Baron Hess) Infantry Regiment under the direction of Eduard Kremser to provide its premiere.

Although the waltz was intended as a choral work with text by the Association&#x27;s poet and good friend of Strauss Josef Weyl, today, the work is more familiar being a purely orchestral work as is the other Strauss waltzes which began life as a choral work such as The Blue Danube waltz. Weyl&#x27;s text refers to the expansion of Vienna in 1870 where various old suburbs are incorporated as well.

The waltz also chronicled a sad chapter in the Strauss dynasty with the death of mother Anna Strauss after a long illness on 23 February 1870. Strauss and his brothers temporarily withdrew from the musical life before reappearing on 13 March of the same year at the Musikverein&#x27;s Golden Hall with the Strauss Orchestra for the &#x27;Carnival Revue&#x27;. Johann Strauss&#x27; new waltz in purely orchestral form met with generous applause when performed on that occasion and has since retained its popularity. Nicolaus Dumba himself remained proud of his dedication for the rest of his life and survived long enough to actually witness themes from the waltz incorporated into the operetta Wiener Blut five months after Strauss&#x27; death in 1899.

<text>Tai Wai (Chinese: 大圍 ) is an area in the New Territories, Hong Kong, located between Sha Tin and the Lion Rock, within the Sha Tin District.

With three rapid transit stations, one of which an interchange station serving two lines, five bus termini and several trunk roads and tunnels connecting it to other parts of the New Territories, such as Tsuen Wan, and Kowloon, Tai Wai is an important transport node in Hong Kong.
==Geography==
Tai Wai occupies the southwestern end of the Sha Tin Valley. The Sha Tin area is located directly northeast of Tai Wai. Hill ranges separate Tai Wai from New Kowloon in the south, and from Tsuen Wan in the west. The Tai Wai Nullah, sometimes referred to as the upper stream of Shing Mun River, flows through Tai Wai, where it joins the Shing Mun River. The Shing Mun River then flows in a southwest–northeast direction across the Sha Tin Valley towards Tolo Harbour.

==History==
Sprouting from traditional farming villages growing rice, vegetables and fruits, such as choy sum, Chinese broccoli, bamboo, banana, peach, and lychee, Tai Wai area once functioned as a light suburban industrial park in the 1970s. Few factory buildings are still in use, mostly as warehouses. The current urbanization of the area is the consequence of the development of Sha Tin New Town that started in the 1970s.

Tai Wai Village, where the name of the area came from, was the largest and oldest walled village in Sha Tin. It was built in 1574 during the Ming dynasty, and was called Chik Chuen Wai () at the time. It was originally made up of 16 families, Wai (), Chan (), Ng (), Yeung (), Wong (), Lee (), Hui (), Cheng (), Tong (), Yuen (), Yau (), Lam (), Lok (), Tam (), Mok () and Choy ().

The Wai family, being the largest family, is thought to be the direct descendants of the famous founder general of the Han dynasty, Han Xin, who purportedly fled there to escape executions ordered by Emperor Gao of Han&#x27;s empress Empress Lü Zhi. The Han descendants changed their surname into Wai by splitting the word Han () in two halves and took up the character on the right hand side, Wai (韋).

The Cheng family, on the other hand, originated from a place called Xingyang in Zhengzhou, Henan which is the place where Chang&#x27;e supposedly flew to the Moon. It is also the birthplace of Li Shangyin, one of the most famous poets in the late Tang dynasty.

Tai Wai appears on the &quot;Map of the San-On District&quot;, published in 1866 by Simeone Volonteri.

The first public housing estate built in the area was Mei Lam Estate, with the first two blocks of its Phase 1 completed in 1981. Tai Wai station opened in August 1983.

==Electoral constituencies==
Tai Wai in Sha Tin District, as defined at the time of the 2015 Hong Kong District Council elections. They are: Chun Fung (, R10), Sun Tin Wai (, R11), Chui Tin (, R12), Hin Ka (, R13), Lower Shing Mun (, R14), Wan Shing (, R15), Keng Hau (, R16), Tin Sum (, R17), Chui Ka (, R18), Tai Wai (, R19), Chung Tin (, R20).

==Demographics==
Tai Wai is composed largely of low to medium income households of different ethnic backgrounds ranging from local Chinese to Westerners. According to the 2016 Population By-census, the number of persons living in Tai Wai was as follows:
==Housing==

A large part of the population of Tai Wai lives in public housing estates. Privately owned apartment blocks are also common and higher income luxury housing is also available in various parts of Tai Wai. Hundreds of three-storey village houses (some western styled, others more traditional) can be found in the villages of the area.

===Public housing===

The table below lists all the public housing estates in Tai Wai, including Public Rental Housing (Public), Home Ownership Scheme (HOS), Tenants Purchase Scheme (TPS) and Private Sector Participation Scheme (PSPS).
===Private housing estates===
====Festival City====

Festival City () is a HK$20 billion residential development project by Cheung Kong and MTR Corporation located above the Tai Wai (Station) Maintenance Centre. Phase I was completed in September 2010, Phase II in October 2011, and Phase III in August 2012. The plan was to build 12 50-stories high residential towers with a total construction area of 313,955 square meters as well as 25,890 square meters for the general public&#x27;s use. It offers 4,264 flats to families, two schools and one community facility. This residential project raised the population of Tai Wai significantly. The controversy of this project is that the 12 towers would create an urban heat island effect and block off the air flow of the area.

===Other estates===

Other private housing estates in Tai Wai include:

* Glamour Garden ()
* Golden Lion Gardens (金獅花園)
* Grandeur Garden ()
* Granville Garden (恆峰花園)
* Greenview Garden ()
* Julimount Garden ()
* Lakeview Garden ()
* Man Lai Court ()

===Villages===


A number of villages exist in Tai Wai and most of them are surrounded by the towers of housing estates. Traditional village layout and some historic buildings can still be found.

* Tai Wai Village, aka. Chik Chuen Wai (). It is located next to Tai Wai station and the main commercial streets of the area. The village was walled to protect the villagers from bandits, pirates and/or unfriendly neighbours. It was rectangular in shape with 4 watch towers at its four corners. The towers and the walls have long been demolished leaving only the entrance gate and part of the front wall. The houses inside the walls are in rows, and many houses have been built outside the walls due to later development. Historic and traditional buildings include the Entrance Gate, a Hau Wong Temple, the Wai Ancestral Hall and several old houses.
* Tai Wai New Village () () is located on a slope alongside Tai Po Road, just minutes walk away from the old village. It was established in the 1980s as the then colonial government&#x27;s effort to compensate the villagers for effectively confiscating their land for development. Each male villager was given a piece of land at a premium of HK$20,000 of which he has the right to build a Spanish-styled 700 sq.ft. three-story house to live in. Most of these houses are now rented by outsiders for the relatively tranquil countryside surroundings. The land occupied by the village was once cultivated for pineapples.

Ha Keng Hau, Sheung Keng Hau and Hin Tin are three adjacent villages located along Hin Keng Street (), along a northeast–southwest direction. Hin Keng Estate, located northeast of the villages and across Hin Keng Street, was named after them.
* Ha Keng Hau () () is located east of Hin Keng Estate and west of Lung Hang Estate. It was established by the Law () and the Mak () during the 18th century. The Mak who settled there had branched out of Pan Chung () in Tai Po.
* Sheung Keng Hau () () is located southeast of Hin Keng Estate. It is a single-surname village, Wai (), with a history of over 300 years. The Wai Ancestral Hall was rebuilt in 1930.
* Hin Tin () () is located south of the main part of Hin Keng Estate. The village was erected with government funding in the 1920s to resettle three clans of villagers from Shek Lei Pui Valley (), to make way for the construction of the Shek Lei Pui Reservoir, completed in 1925. Some 80 people lived in 26 houses in the former Shek Lei Pui Village. The Yeung (), the Law () and the So () were Hakkas from Nantou who had settled in the Valley for some 300 years. Another clan in the Valley, the Lau (), moved to Kwai Chung instead of Hin Tin at the resettlement. The ancestral halls of the three clans were built in Hin Tin, connected together to form a single block on the front row of the original three rows of houses. They have been listed as Grade III historic buildings since 2010. In 1982, the Housing Department demolished 600 structures at Hin Tin and relocated 167 families.

Villages in the vicinity of Che Kung Temple:
* Kak Tin () () is located south of Sun Chui Estate and Sun Tin Wai Estate. It was one of the five Punti villages in Sha Tin founded about 400 years ago by Tsang () clanspeople, originally from Shandong. The villagers were historically farmers engaged in rice and vegetable growing supported by pig and poultry rearing. The village had a population of 130 in 1899 and 220 in 1960. About 80 households of the Tsangs are still residing in the village. Most of the village houses have been demolished and replaced by modern small houses.
* Hung Mui Kuk Village () () 
* San Tin Village (not to be confused with San Tin within Yuen Long District), () () is located south of Che Kung Temple and east of Sun Chui Estate. It was historically a single-clan village of the Lau (), and it now features the Lau Ancestral Hall (). The Lau were Hakkas who first moved from Huizhou to Grassy Hill, northwest of Sha Tin, during the 18th century. They were farmers engaged in cultivation. As their population increased, they bought a piece of land from the Kak Tin and Tin Sam villages and established a new village called &#x27;San Tin&#x27; (lit. &quot;new field&quot;) in the late 1890s.
* Lei Uk Tsuen () () is located east of Che Kung Temple and west of Chun Shek Estate. It was established by the Lei clan in the late 17th century.
* Sha Tin Tau () () is located east of Chun Shek Estate, north of Fung Shing Court and south of Tsang Tai Uk. Historically the only Hakka multi-surname village in the Sha Tin area, it was first settled by the Chan () and later by the Law (), the Lam (), the Yip (), the Lau () and others. There are several ancestral halls in the village, including the Lau Ancestral Hall (), that was built before 1900. The founding ancestor of the Lau clan of Sha Tin Tau village moved from Longchuan in the mid-19th century. The clan has lived there for nine generations by the early 21st century.
* Sha Tin Tau New Village () ()

Other villages in Tai Wai include:
* Heung Fan Liu New Village () () is located near the Tai Wai Nullah, north of Mei Tin Estate and east of the Lower Shing Mun Reservoir.
* Luk Hop Village () () is located on the hill along Tai Po Road and on top of Sha Tin Heights Tunnel.
* Fuk Lok Village () () is located on the hill, north of Heung Fan Liu New Village and Pak Tin.
* Pak Tin () () is located west of Mei Chung Court. At the time of the 1911 census, the population of Pak Tin was 3.
* Tin Sam Village () () is located west of Sun Chui Estate, north of Lung Hang Estate, and southeast of Festival City. It was a Punti walled village, historically inhabited by the Choi (), the Wai (), the Leung (), the Tsang () and the Liu (). A moat was built for its protection, and was later filled up and used as a fish pond. Historic buildings in the village include the Choi Ancestral Hall, the Leung Ancestral Halls, the Liu Ancestral Hall, and the Entrance Gate, built during the Qing dynasty. The Che Kung Temple in Tai Wai was originally built and managed by the Tin Sam Village, but the village lost its managerial rights in the late 19th century.
* Tung Lo Wan () () is located east of Mei Lam Estate, across the Tai Wai Nullah. It was historically a Hakka village occupied by families of different surnames, the Yau () being the majority. The first generation of the Tse clan who settled in the village moved to Tung Lo Wan in the early 20th century. The Tse Ancestral Hall (), also called Tse Po Shu Tong (), was built before 1910. It is the only ancestral hall in the village. The Li Cottage (), located nearby, at the corner of Tung Lo Wan Hill Road and Chung Ling Road, was built around 1918. It is connected by a path to the Li Tomb () uphill.
* Yau Oi Tsuen () (), located west of Tao Fung Shan.

==Retail==

Several public housing estates have a shopping centre. The only private shopping centre was Grandeur Shopping Arcade (), located within Grandeur Garden, along Tai Wai Road (), until The Wai shopping mall opened in 2023.

The Wai () opened on 22 July 2023. Located on top of Tai Wai Station and below the Pavilia Farm residential complex, the shopping mall covers an area 650,000 sq ft across four floors.

==Transport==


===MTR===
Tai Wai station is on the East Rail line and the Tuen Ma line of the MTR. The northward termini of the East Rail line, Lo Wu and Lok Ma Chau stations, located at the border with Shenzhen, are about 30 minutes away. The station was opened in 1983 and its expansion for the Ma On Shan line was completed in September 2004.

Che Kung Temple station of the Tuen Ma line is also located in the Tai Wai area. It opened in 2004.

In 2002, KCRC won the bid to plan, build and operate the Sha Tin to Central Link, and in 2004 it submitted the Draft Final Proposal to the Government. The March 2008 MTR-KCR revised proposal includes the extension of East Rail line across Victoria Harbour to Hong Kong Island and the extension of Ma On Shan line to West Rail line via East Kowloon. The Tai Wai to Hung Hom section was fully completed in 2021 and the Cross Harbour section was completed in 2022. As part of this project, a new station was built in the Tai Wai area, Hin Keng station, which opened in February 2020.

===Road connections===
Tai Wai is the main gateway of tunnels and roads connecting the New Territories to Kowloon as well as Tsuen Wan due to its convenient location. In the early 20th century and until the Lion Rock Tunnel, the first road tunnel in Hong Kong, was built in 1967, Tai Po Road was the main road connecting Tai Wai and the New Territories to Kowloon. Tai Po Road to this day remains as the only toll-free road connecting the two areas.

The tunnels are: Lion Rock Tunnel (1967), Shing Mun Tunnels (1990) and Sha Tin Heights Tunnel (2008). Sha Tin Heights Tunnel opened in March 2008 to lessen the traffic of the Kowloon Tunnels and Tai Po Road. It is part of Route 8 that connects Tai Wai to the airport over the Stonecutters Bridge and through the Nam Wan Tunnel.

===Bus===
A large percentage of the bus routes that go past Tai Wai are circular routes which both start and terminate in Sha Tin. There are also long-distance routes that go past famous Hong Kong landmarks and attractions. They include 170, which goes to Ocean Park; E42 goes to the airport (via Tung Chung) and R42 to Disneyland.

There are 5 major bus termini in Tai Wai:
* Mei Lam ()
* Mei Tin ()
* Sun Chui ()
* Hin Keng ()
* Tai Wai Station ()

===Minibus===
Many green minibus (GMB) routes that pass Tai Wai go around all parts of Sha Tin to provide feeder services for major public transport operators such as the MTR. Routes such as 481B go to the Tsuen Wan area via Shing Mun Tunnel offering a fast but cheap alternative to buses and the MTR. Residents&#x27; buses also operate at Tai Wai station. Union Hospital&#x27;s free shuttle bus also operates from there at 10-minute frequencies.

<doc id="1312317" wikidata="Q379321" url="?curid=1312317" title="Language policy in France">
<text>France has one official language, the French language. The French government does not regulate the choice of language in publications by individuals, but the use of French is required by law in commercial and workplace communications. In addition to mandating the use of French in the territory of the Republic, the French government tries to promote French in the European Union and globally through institutions such as La Francophonie. The perceived threat from Anglicization has prompted efforts to safeguard the position of the French language in France.

Besides French, there exist many other vernacular minority languages of France, both in European France, in Overseas France, and in French overseas territories. These languages are recognized by article 75-1 of the French constitution. The 1999 report written for the French government by Bernard Cerquiglini identified 75 languages (including just eight in continental France proper) that would qualify for recognition were the government to ratify the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages (currently signed but not ratified).

==History==
The Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts of 1539 made French the administrative language of the kingdom of France for legal documents and laws. Previously, official documents were written in medieval Latin, which was the language used by the Roman Catholic Church.

===Académie française===
The was established in 1635 to act as the official authority on the usages, vocabulary, and grammar of the French language, and to publish an official dictionary of the French language. Its recommendations however carry no legal power and are sometimes disregarded even by governmental authorities. In recent years the Académie has tried to prevent the Anglicisation of the French language.

===French Revolution===
Prior to the French Revolution of 1789, French kings did not take a strong position on the language spoken by their subjects. However, in sweeping away the old provinces, parlements and laws, the Revolution strengthened the unified system of administration across the state. At first, the revolutionaries declared liberty of language for all citizens of the Republic; this policy was subsequently abandoned in favour of the imposition of a common language which was to do away with the other languages of France. Other languages were seen as keeping the peasant masses in obscurantism.

The new idea was expounded in the 1794 &quot;Report on the necessity and means to annihilate the patois and to universalise the use of the French language&quot;. Its author, Henri Grégoire, deplored that France, the most advanced country in the world with regard to politics, had not progressed beyond the Tower of Babel as far as languages were concerned, and that only three million of the 25 million inhabitants of France spoke a pure Parisian French as their native tongue. The lack of ability of the population to understand the language in which were the political debates and the administrative documents was then seen as antidemocratic.

The report resulted the same year in two laws which stated that the only language tolerated in France in public life and in schools would be French. Within two years, the French language had become the symbol of the national unity of the French State. However, the revolutionaries lacked both time and money to implement a language policy.

===Third Republic===
In the 1880s, the Third Republic sought to modernize France, and in particular to increase literacy and general knowledge in the population, especially the rural population, and established free compulsory primary education.

The only language allowed in primary school was French. All other languages were forbidden, even in the schoolyard, and transgressions were severely punished. After 1918, the use of German in Alsace-Lorraine was outlawed. In 1925, Anatole de Monzie, Minister of public education, stated that &quot;for the linguistic unity of France, the Breton language must disappear.&quot; As a result, the speakers of minority languages began to be ashamed when using their own language – especially in the educational system – and over time, many families stopped teaching their language to their children and tried to speak only French with them. In neighbouring Belgium, a parallel policy to expand the use of standard French also took place.

===Fourth Republic===
The 1950s were also the first time the French state recognised the right of the regional languages to exist. A law allowed for the teaching of regional languages in secondary schools, and the policy of repression in the primary schools came to an end. The Breton language began to appear in the media during this time.

===Fifth Republic===
The French government allowed in 1964 for the first time one and a half minutes of Breton on regional television. But even in 1972, president Georges Pompidou declared that &quot;there is no place for minority languages in a France destined to make its mark on Europe.&quot;

In 1992 the constitution was amended to state explicitly that &quot;the language of the Republic is French.&quot;

The Toubon Law (full name: law 94-665 of 4 August 1994 relating to usage of the French language) mandated the use of the French language in official government publications, in all advertisements, in all workplaces, in commercial contracts, in some other commercial communication contexts, in all government-financed schools, and some other contexts.

The law does not concern private, non-commercial communications, such as non-commercial web publications by private bodies. It does not concern books, films, public speeches, and other forms of communications not constituting commercial activity. However, the law mandates the use of the French language in all broadcast audiovisual programs, with exceptions for musical works and &quot;original version&quot; films. 

Broadcast musical works are subject to quota rules under a related law whereby a minimum percentage of the songs on radio and television must be in the French language. A minimum of four in ten songs broadcast by domestic radio stations must be in the French language.

In 2006, under this law, a French subsidiary of a US company was fined €500,000 plus an ongoing fine of €20,000 per day for providing software and related technical documentation to its employees in English only. 

In 2008, a revision of the French constitution creating official recognition of regional languages was implemented by the Parliament in Congress at Versailles.

In 2021, a law on regional languages was adopted by the parliament. However, its articles on immersion education in public schools and on use of regional languages&#x27; diacritics in civil records were vetoed by the Constitutional Council. 

====The debate about the Council of Europe&#x27;s Charter for Regional or Minority Languages====
In 1999 the Socialist government of Lionel Jospin signed the Council of Europe&#x27;s European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, but it was not ratified. The Constitutional Council of France declared that the Charter contains unconstitutional provisions since the Constitution states that the language of the Republic is French.

The European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages is a European convention (ETS 148) adopted in 1992 under the auspices of the Council of Europe to protect and promote historical regional and minority languages in Europe, ratified and implemented by 25 States, but not by France, . The charter contains 98 articles of which signatories must adopt a minimum of 35 (France signed 39). The signing, and the failure to have it ratified, provoked a public debate in French society over the charter.

More recently, in a letter to several deputies dated 4 June 2015, François Hollande announced the upcoming filing of a constitutional bill for the ratification of the European Charter for Regional and Minority Languages. On 30 July 2015, the Council of State gave an unfavorable opinion on the charter. On 27 October 2015, the Senate rejected the draft law on ratification of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages driving away the assumption of Congress for the adoption of the constitutional reform which would have given the value and legitimacy to regional languages.

== Minority and endangered languages ==
Excluding the languages spoken in the overseas regions and other overseas territories, and the languages of recent immigrants, the following languages are spoken by sizeable minorities in France:

=== Celtic languages ===
Breton (Gwenedeg/Vannetais, Gwennraneg, Kerneveg, Leoneg, and Tregerieg)

=== Francosign languages ===
French Sign Language (LSF)

=== Germanic languages ===
Alsatian, Dutch (West Flemish/French Flemish), Lorrainian, Luxembourgish, and Yenish

=== Isolate languages ===
Basque/Euskara and Lyons Sign Language

=== Romance languages ===
*Gallo-Italic languages: Ligurian
*Gallo-Romance languages
**Langues d&#x27;oïl: Angevin, Berrichon, Burgundian, Champenois, Frainc-Comtou, Gallo, Lorrain, Manceau, Mayennais, Normaund, Picard, Poetevin, Saintonjhais, and Walloon
**Occitano-Romance languages: Auvergnat, Catalan, Gascon (Béarnese and Landese), Langadocian, Limousin, Niçard, Occitan, Provençal, and Vivaroalpenc
**Arpitan languages: Burgondan, Dauphinois Nord/Isérois, Forézien, Franco-Provençal, Jurassien, Lyonnais (Bressan), Mâconnais, and Savoyard
*Ibero-Romance languages: Portuguese and Spanish (Castilian)
*Italo-Dalmatian languages: Corsican and Italian

=== Romani languages ===
Auvergnat Romani, Caló, and Sintikès
The non-French Oïl languages and Franco-Provençal are highly endangered; because of their similarity to standard French, their speakers conformed first in phonology, and then orthography much more readily. The other languages are still spoken but are all considered endangered.

In the 1940s, more than one million people spoke Breton as their main language. The countryside in western Brittany was still overwhelmingly Breton-speaking. Today, about 170,000 people are able to speak Breton (around 8% of the population in the traditionally Breton speaking area), most of whom are elderly. Other regional languages have generally followed the same pattern; Alsatian and Corsican have resisted better, while Occitan has followed an even worse trend.

Accurate information on the state of language use is complicated by the inability (due to constitutional provisions) of the state to ask language use questions in the census.

Since the rejection of ratification of the European Charter, French governments have offered token support to regional languages within the limits of the law. The &quot;Délégation générale à la langue française&quot; (General delegation of the French tongue) has acquired the additional function of observing and studying the languages of France and has had &quot;et aux langues de France&quot; (...and languages of France) added to its title.

The French government hosted the first &quot;Assises nationales des langues de France&quot; in 2003, but this national round table on the languages of France served to highlight the contrast between cultural organisations and language activists on the one hand and the state on the other. 

The decentralization has not extended to giving power in language policy to the regions. In fact, the use of regional languages at local government level is still severely contested. In 2022, some local councils in the traditionally Catalan-speaking department of the Pyrénées-Orientales, such as Elne, passed a modification of their statutes to allow the intervention in Catalan language by their elected members, as long as they provide an exact oral translation in French, as well a written French translation of the session. Despite being considered a symbolic gesture, the prefect of the Department, arguing that the political rights of French speakers will be violated, appealed to justice to repeal these initiatives. In April 2023, the Administrative Court of Montpellier sided with the Prefect, thus declaring illegal the decisions of the local councils.

In April 2021, France approved the &quot;Molac&quot; law (8 April 2021) which aims to protect and promote regional languages across the country. The law allows for schools to offer teaching in the medium of a regional minority language for the majority of the school day. However, the French Minister of Education, opposed to the teaching in minority languages, asked the Conseil Constitutionnel to declare it unconstitutional. This led to certain provisions of the law being constitutionally struck down on 21 May 2021.

== Opposition to language policy ==

According to French republican ideology (see also Laïcité), all &quot;citizens&quot; are ultimately &quot;Frenchmen&quot; and therefore no minority &quot;groups&quot; (i.e. ethnolinguistic groups) may exercise extra rights; this is an idea stemming from the French Revolution, contrasting with the previous situation in which many distinguishable groups had special rights and privileges in their regions.

This policy of cultural homogeneity has been challenged from both the right wing and the left wing. In the 1970s, nationalist or regionalist movements emerged in regions such as Brittany, Corsica and Occitania. Even though they remain a minority, networks of schools teaching France&#x27;s regional languages have arisen, such as the Diwan in Brittany, the Ikastola in the Basque Country, the Calandreta in Occitania, and the La Bressola schools in Northern Catalonia.

Despite popular demand for official recognition, regional language teaching is not supported by the state. However, in certain areas, such as Brittany, regional councils maintain bilingual public schools as far as it is within the law. Other Breton education is provided by Catholic schools and private schools, Dihun and Diwan, respectively. In 2011, only 14,000 pupils were enrolled in French-Breton bilingual schools, although this number reflected an increase of around 30% from the year 2006, when the number of pupils was just over 11,000. The Ofis Publik ar Brezhoneg also reported in 2011 that a further 16,000 students from early childhood to adulthood were learning Breton as a second language (at primary schools, collèges, lycées, university or evening courses), bringing the total number of Breton learners to at least 30,000.

A long campaign of defacing road signs led to the first bilingual road signs in the 1980s. These are now increasingly common in Brittany, because of the help given by the Ofis ar Brezhoneg in bilingualizing many road, town hall and other official signs.

As far as the media are concerned, there is still little Breton to be found on the airwaves, although since 1982 a few Breton-speaking radio stations have been created on an associative basis. The launching of the Breton TV Breizh in 2000 was intended to offer wider coverage of Breton. However, Breton-language programme schedules gradually decreased in favour of French-language broadcasting, until in 2010 they totally disappeared.

In Corsica, the 1991 &quot;Joxe Statute&quot;, in setting up the Collectivité Territoriale de Corse, also provided for the Corsican Assembly, and charged it with developing a plan for the optional teaching of Corsu. At the primary school level Corsu is taught up to a fixed number of hours per week (three in the year 2000) and is a voluntary subject at the secondary school level, but is required at the University of Corsica.

There is some opposition to the Loi Toubon mandating the use of French (or at least a translation into French) in commercial advertising and packaging, as well as in some other contexts.

<doc id="1312318" wikidata="Q1143235" url="?curid=1312318" title="Rikkyo University">
<text>, also known as Saint Paul&#x27;s University, is a private university, in Ikebukuro, Tokyo, Japan.

Rikkyo is one of the five MARCH universities, the group of private universities in the Kanto region, together with Meiji, Aoyama Gakuin, Chuo, and Hosei.

Rikkyo is known as one of the six leading universities in the field of sports in Tokyo ( &quot;Big Six&quot; — Rikkyo University, University of Tokyo, Keio University, Waseda University, Meiji University, and Hosei University).

A leading liberal arts teaching and research institution, the university is the largest Anglican Christian affiliated university in Japan.

The university is internationally oriented and involved in numerous international programmes and projects. Rikkyo maintains contact with more than 140 educational institutions abroad for the purpose of exchanging lecturers, students and projects. With more than 700 students from outside Japan, the institution has 20,000 students, and 2,700 teachers and staff members.

==Rikkyo Gakuin==
The Rikkyo Gakuin is an educational institution, which includes Rikkyo University and several affiliated schools. They include three all-male schools and an international school, The Rikkyo School in England. Rikkyo Gakuin’s sister schools include three all-female schools and, formerly, a junior college (St. Margaret&#x27;s Junior College).

==History==
===Founding===

The origins of the university date from the founding of St. Paul&#x27;s School for boys in 1874 by Channing Moore Williams, a missionary of the Episcopal Church and a leading figure in the establishment of the Anglican Church in Japan.

The school&#x27;s first classes were held in Williams&#x27; home in the foreign settlement in Tsukiji, Tokyo. Initially five students came to study with the resident missionaries. By the end of the first year this number had grown to 55 with as many as 46 living in a dormitory rented by the school.

Fire devoured the first school buildings in 1876. With funding from the Domestic and Foreign Mission Society of the Protestant Episcopal Church and, in 1880, a new principal, James McDonald Gardiner to supervise, new three-story brick facilities with an imposing 60-foot spire were constructed.
In 1891, Gardiner resigned from the management of the school and was succeeded by Rev. Theodosius Stevens Tyng. Simultaneous with the appointment of Rev. Tyng, the school&#x27;s name was changed from St. Paul&#x27;s School to St. Paul&#x27;s College; curriculum changes were introduced; and a formal application was made for a government license. Enrollment jumped, but the school buildings were in a poor state of repair and were condemned as unsafe by government inspectors. As president of the school Tyng immediately set off to the United States on a fundraising tour. Less than three weeks after his return to Tokyo an earthquake in 1894 leveled much of the original school facilities, highlighting the perils of building on reclaimed land next to the Sumida River. The college was temporarily housed in Trinity Parish House, and by 1896 new buildings including an academic hall and student dormitory were ready for occupation.

In 1897, the Rev. Arthur Lloyd became president of the university. The Rikkyo schools experienced a rapid rise in student enrollment by virtue of the granting of a government license exempting students from military service and granting them access to all government established schools of higher education. Lloyd navigated the school through a turbulent six years as the Japanese Ministry of Education sought to curtail any religious instruction in the curriculum of government-approved schools. As only in the dormitories at Rikkyo was any religious instruction given, the school was able to retain its license.

In 1903, the Rev. Henry St. George Tucker succeeded Rev. Lloyd as president. In 1905 the school reported a male student enrollment of 573 and the need for larger school classroom facilities was acute. After another successful fundraising appeal new classrooms, an assembly hall and an office building were opened in 1907. The Rev. Charles S. Reifsnider succeed Rev. Tucker in 1912 when the latter took up his new post as Bishop of Kyoto.

===New campus and elevation to university status===

In 1909, 23 acres of land were purchased near Ikebukuro for the construction of a larger dedicated campus and the university moved into new buildings at this site in 1919. The University Chapel was consecrated in 1920, and the university was officially chartered by the Ministry of Education in 1922.

The original, red-brick, campus buildings, designed by Murphy &amp; Dana Architects of New York, suffered structural damage in the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake but, due to the university&#x27;s more suburban location, escaped the fires that destroyed much of the center of the city.

Until the 1920s almost all classes at Rikkyo were held in English; Japanese language textbooks were made more widely available toward the end of the decade.

In the late 1930s and during the Second World War Rikkyo&#x27;s status as an Anglican Christian university came under severe pressure from the military authorities. In 1936, the president of the university, Shigeharu Kimura, was forced to resign over allegations of disrespect during a required public reading of the Imperial Rescript on Education in the University Chapel.

In September 1942, university trustees agreed to change the wording of the charter to sever all ties with Christianity. The majority of Christian faculty members lost their positions and the University All Saints Chapel was closed.

===Post-war period===
At the end of World War II in October 1945 the U.S. Occupation authorities moved swiftly to remove head officials associated with the teaching of militarism and the violation of the university&#x27;s founding charter. The university re-established its links with the Anglican Church in Japan. With the support of former faculty such as Paul Rusch, they began to restart classes, re-hire faculty, and rebuild.

Women were admitted to degree programs in 1946.

A new library extension, designed by renowned Japanese architect Kenzo Tange, was completed in 1960.

With contributions from private donors, the Episcopal Church in the United States and the Japanese Ministry of Education, between 1961 and 2001 the university owned and operated a TRIGA 100kW research reactor at Yokosuka, Kanagawa contributing the development of neutron radiography and energy research in Japan.

A second suburban campus in Niiza, Saitama for first- and second-year students was established in 1990.

Building on existing undergraduate study programs, new graduate schools for Business Administration, Social Design Studies, and Intercultural Communication were opened in 2002.

===Recent developments===
In September 2014, the Japanese Ministry of Education announced that Rikkyo University had been selected as a “Global Hub” university and will now receive special strategic government funding to support its global education programs.

==Library==

The Old Main Library, or Mather Library, in the group of historic red brick buildings at the university&#x27;s main entrance, was built in 1918. The original building was named in memory of Samuel Mather an American industrialist and long-time sponsor of Episcopal Church overseas mission work. Funds for the original building were donated by Mather in memory of his father. Further funding was also provided by him in 1925 to finance the repairs to the building in the wake of the 1923 Great Kanto earthquake.

The university library buildings have been expanded over succeeding decades to include landmark buildings by Kenzo Tange and more modern structures to house collections containing over 1.7 million volumes of print and non-print materials. The university libraries house specialist collections of the Protestant Episcopal Church and Edogawa Rampo.

<doc id="1312323" wikidata="Q4135162" url="?curid=1312323" title="Vanabin">
<text>Vanabins (also known as vanadium-associated proteins or vanadium chromagen) are a group of vanadium-binding metalloproteins. Vanabins are found almost exclusively in the blood cells, or vanadocytes, of some tunicates (sea squirts), including the Ascidiacea. The vanabins extracted from tunicate vanadocytes are often called hemovanadins. These organisms are able to concentrate vanadium from the surrounding seawater, and vanabin proteins have been involved in collecting and accumulating this metal ion. At present there is no conclusive understanding of why these organisms collect vanadium.

Vanadium has been reported in high concentrations in the blood of the sea cucumber &quot;Stichopus&quot;. However, later research has found little or no vanadium in this and four other sea cucumber genera.

==Possible function==
===Vanabins as oxygen carriers===
Because of the high concentration of vanadium in the blood, it has been assumed that vanabins are used for oxygen transport like iron-based hemoglobin or copper-based hemocyanin. Unfortunately no scientific evidence can be found to back this hypothesis.

The highest concentration of vanadium found so far, 350 mM, was found in the blood cells of &quot;Ascidia gemmata&quot; belonging to the suborder Phlebobranchia. This concentration is 10,000,000 times higher than that in seawater.

Vanabins accumulate vanadium in the blood cells and produce V(III) species and vanadyl ions (V(IV)) from orthovanadate ions (V(V)), with the use of NADPH as a reducing agent. Vanabins also transport the reduced vanadium species into the vacuoles of vanadocytes (vanadium-containing blood cells). The vacuoles are kept at a very acidic pH of 1.9 (due to sulfuric acid in it), made possible by pumping hydrogen ions into the vacuoles by use of energy intensive H+-ATPase. All the use of NADPH and ATP to collect and maintain the vanadium is extremely energy intensive, unusual for oxygen transporting proteins.

Other oxygen transporting proteins have a very low dissociation constant with their metal prosthetic group and bind these groups tightly. Vanabins on the other hand have a moderate dissociation constant and do not tightly bind vanadium. Most importantly, because of this moderate dissociation constant, vanadium is usually found free-floating and separated from any proteins inside the vacuoles. This is completely different from other oxygen transporting proteins.

===Vanabins not oxygen carriers===
The most convincing evidence against vanadium in use for oxygen transport is that many ascidians and tunicates also have hemocyanin in their blood that could be assumed to handle all oxygen transport.

The use of vanabins and vanadium for oxygen transport in ascidians and tunicates is doubtful. Another hypothesized reason for these organisms collecting vanadium is to make themselves toxic to predators, parasites and microorganisms.

==History==
German chemist Martin Henze discovered vanadium in ascidiaceans in 1911.

<text>William Ward Duffield (November 19, 1823 – June 22, 1907) was an executive in the coal industry, a railroad construction engineer, and an officer in the Union Army during the American Civil War. After the war he was appointed Superintendent of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey.

==Early life==
Duffield was born in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, the son of Isabella Graham (Bethune), and the Reverend George Duffield, a prominent minister in the Presbyterian Church. He was also the brother of Brigadier General Henry M. Duffield. Although he would call Michigan home after 1836, throughout his life William worked and traveled widely. He graduated in 1842 from Columbia College, New York City, as a civil engineer, and two years later received a Master of Arts. He later studied law and was admitted to the Detroit bar. At the onset of the Mexican–American War he entered the U.S. Army as adjutant of the 2nd Tennessee Infantry. Later during the war he served on the staff of General Gideon J. Pillow. He went to California as an Army paymaster after the war and qualified as a founding member in the Society of California Pioneers. During this service he became well enough versed in the military sciences to author two books on the subject. After leaving the Army he worked as engineer and superintendent of railroads in New York; surveyed the Detroit and Milwaukee Railroad from Pontiac to Grand Haven, from Detroit to Port Huron, and from Mendota to Galesburg, Illinois.

==Civil War==
When the Civil War erupted, Duffield joined the 4th Michigan Infantry as its lieutenant colonel, and participated with the regiment in the First Battle of Bull Run. In September 1861 he resigned from the 4th and accepted a commission as colonel of the 9th Michigan Infantry.

On January 9, 1862, he was ordered to Bardstown, Kentucky, to head an officer examining board. From March 8 to May 14, 1862, he commanded the 23rd Brigade of the Army of the Ohio. On April 11, 1862, he was appointed acting brigadier general, but his appointment was not confirmed by the United States Senate; it was tabled on July 16, 1862. On May 9, 1862, he was appointed acting military governor of Kentucky. On July 12, 1862, Duffield arrived in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, in command of the 9th Michigan. The following day the Union garrison, under the overall command of Brig. Gen. Thomas T. Crittenden, was attacked and defeated by Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest in the First Battle of Murfreesboro. Col. Duffield received two gunshot wounds during the attack; one passing through the right testicle, the other through the left thigh. These, although very painful and bleeding profusely, did not prevent him from remaining with his own regiment until the attack was repulsed, when, fainting from pain and loss of blood. He was carried from the field. At noon the same day he was made prisoner by General Forrest, but, in his then helpless condition, was released upon his parole promising not to bear arms against the Confederate States until being regularly exchanged. He was exchanged on August 27, 1862.

==Postbellum career==
Duffield resigned from the Army on February 6, 1863, and returned to Michigan. After the war he had charge of coal mines in Pennsylvania and iron mines in Kentucky, and was chief engineer of the Kentucky Union Railroad. In 1879–1880 he served as a member of the Michigan State Senate. He was appointed by President Grover Cleveland as Superintendent of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, holding that position from 1894 to 1897. He spent his last years in Washington, D.C., where he died. He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia.

<doc id="1312327" wikidata="Q3492952" url="?curid=1312327" title="Wyclef Jean Presents The Carnival">
<text>Wyclef Jean Presents The Carnival, also known simply as The Carnival, is the debut studio album released by Haitian hip hop musician Wyclef Jean. The album was released on 24 June 1997. Wyclef Jean also served as the album&#x27;s executive producer. The album features guest appearances from Celia Cruz and The Neville Brothers and multiple appearances from Jean&#x27;s former Fugees bandmates, Lauryn Hill and Pras.

The album was released to critical acclaim. While commercially it peaked at number sixteen on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, and at number four on the US Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, it garnered Jean three Grammy Award nominations, including two nominations at the 40th Annual Grammy Awards, for Best Rap Album and Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group for &quot;Guantanamera&quot;, and Best Rap Solo Performance at the 41st Grammy Awards in 1999, for his top-ten hit &quot;Gone till November&quot;.

== Music and lyrics ==
The album encompasses many musical genres, including hip hop, reggae, folk, disco, soul, &quot;Son Cubano&quot; and Haitian music. The album features guest appearances from Celia Cruz, The Neville Brothers, John Forté, Jeni Fujita, and Jean&#x27;s bandmates from The Fugees, Lauryn Hill and Pras, among others. It also features skits between many of its songs, most of them set in a fictional trial for Wyclef Jean, in which he is accused of being &quot;a player&quot; and a &quot;bad influence&quot;. The final three songs on the album are sung in Haitian Creole.

== Critical reception ==
&quot;The Carnival&quot; was released to critical acclaim. In a contemporary review for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, music critic Robert Christgau found the album more R&amp;B than the &quot;diasporan flavors&quot; it uses as &quot;half decoration, half concept&quot;, and remarked that Jean uses the sampler for &quot;one-dimensional tunes&quot; that showcase his &quot;well-articulated morality tales and popwise carnivalesque.&quot; In his review for &quot;Playboy&quot;, Christgau asserted that the album is more likely than any other well-meaning hip hop to impact the demographic it aims at and also works as an attempt to prove Jean is equally worthy of the attention given to Lauryn Hill.

Stephen Thompson of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, in a favorable review, called &quot;The Carnival&quot; &quot;a stunning solo album that&#x27;s light years beyond &quot;The Score&quot;&quot;. He also wrote &quot;In his universalist embrace of music of all forms, Wyclef Jean makes a more powerful call for peace and unity than a thousand East Coast–West Coast &#x27;Stop the violence, y&#x27;all&#x27; intros put together.&quot; &quot;The Carnival&quot; was voted the sixteenth best album of the year in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s annual Pazz &amp; Jop critics poll for 1997. Christgau, the poll&#x27;s creator, ranked it twentieth on his own list.

In 2011, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;The Carnival&quot; the 69th best album of the 1990s.

== Commercial performance ==
&quot;The Carnival&quot; debuted at number sixteen on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 52,000 copies in its first week. It also debuted at number four on the US Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. The album spawned the singles &quot;Gone Till November&quot;, &quot;We Trying to Stay Alive&quot;, &quot;Guantanamera&quot; and &quot;To All the Girls&quot;. On 16 December 1998, the album was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and sold approximately two million copies worldwide.

<doc id="1312328" wikidata="Q7900213" url="?curid=1312328" title="Urbana University">
<text>Urbana University was a private university specializing in liberal arts education and located in Urbana, Ohio. In its final few years, it was purchased by Franklin University and was a branch campus of that university.

== History ==
Urbana University was founded in 1850 as Urbana College by followers of the 18th century Swedish philosopher and scientist, Emanuel Swedenborg. The university was the second institution of higher learning in Ohio to admit women; the first was Oberlin College. 

The groundwork for the founding of the university was in part laid by John Chapman, better known as Johnny Appleseed, who became the inspiration for the Johnny Appleseed Museum founded for his extraordinary history. While more famous for spreading apple seeds throughout the East, Chapman was also a Swedenborgian missionary and helped spread this faith among the early settlers around Urbana. Chapman encouraged his friend and fellow Swedenborgian, John Hough James, to donate the land on which Urbana University was built. To this day, the university maintains an informal relationship with the Swedenborgian General Convention of the Church of the New Jerusalem in the United States of America. The university is also home to the Johnny Appleseed Educational Center &amp; Museum to honor John Chapman.

Classes for elementary and secondary students under the name Urbana Seminary began in the fall of 1850 in a rented room in a building in downtown Urbana. College level classes were first held in the fall of 1854, following the construction of Bailey Hall, the first building on the campus. Less than 10 years after the college opened it suspended operations from 1861 to 1866 during the Civil War. The college experienced a number of changes in the early 20th century when the college&#x27;s curriculum was shortened to a two-year junior college format in 1907. The school later shut down the primary school in 1911; and the secondary school was closed in 1928.

Urbana operated as a two-year college until 1968, when it returned curriculum to a four-year format. In 1975, Urbana was granted full membership in the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools. In 1985, the institution changed its name from Urbana College to Urbana University. Until 2014, in addition to having been a traditional liberal arts college, Urbana University&#x27;s School of Adult and Graduate Education offered associate degree and Bachelor of Science degree completion programs in Business Management, Education, Criminal Justice Leadership, Human Services Leadership, and many more. In addition to these programs, Master&#x27;s programs were available in Business Administration, Education, Nursing, and Criminal Justice. Classes met on the Urbana University main campus, and at several off-campus locations throughout Western Ohio. These locations were in Bellefontaine, Dayton, Kettering, Marysville, Piqua, and Springfield.

In 2014, the university was purchased by Franklin University after undergoing significant budget shortfalls. Under the agreement, Urbana would retain its name, and act as a physical campus for both Urbana and Franklin students. On August 1, 2017, Franklin University received approval for its change of status application by the Higher Learning Commission (HLC) to bring Urbana University under Franklin&#x27;s accreditation as a &quot;branch campus.&quot; The campus closed in 2020, transferring records to Franklin University in Columbus, Ohio. Urbana cited the coronavirus pandemic and declining enrollment.

== Campus ==

The main campus was located on the southwest side of Urbana in west central Ohio. Its buildings ranged from historic 19th-century buildings styled in traditional architecture to modern structures. Bailey Hall, Oak Hall, and Barclay Hall are the three oldest buildings on the campus. All three are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The university had undergone various changes in the early 21st century with the construction of Sycamore Hall in 2004, the Urbana University Stadium, the Student Center in 2006, McConnell Hall in 2007, and Ross Hall in 2019.

== Academics ==
Urbana University offered 28 undergraduate majors and Graduate programs in Nursing (MSN), Education (MEd), Business Administration (MBA), Criminal Justice Administration (MA), and a Post-Baccalaureate in Teacher Licensure

== Athletics ==
The Urbana athletic teams were called the Blue Knights. Their athletic colors were blue and white. The university was a member of the NCAA Division II ranks, primarily competing in the Mountain East Conference (MEC) from 2013–14 to 2019–20. The Blue Knights previously competed in the Great Midwest Athletic Conference (G-MAC) as a provisional member only during the 2012–13 school year; as an NCAA D-II Independent from 2008–09 to 2011–12; and in the defunct American Mideast Conference (AMC) of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) from 1971–72 to 2007–08.

Urbana competed in 19 intercollegiate varsity teams: Men&#x27;s sports included baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, soccer, swimming, volleyball and wrestling; while women&#x27;s sports included acrobatics &amp; tumbling, basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, swimming, volleyball and water polo.

=== Club sports ===
Urbana University also offered club sport programs in shooting sports, bowling, and cheerleading.

=== Move to NCAA Division II ===
In 2010, Urbana completed the transition from the NAIA to the NCAA in the Division II ranks. Also in that year, the Great Lakes Valley Conference (GLVC) had accepted Urbana as an associate member of the GLVC in football only starting with the 2012 fall season. In 2011, the university and five other schools, many also transitioning to the NCAA from the NAIA, had announced their intentions to form the G-MAC in 2013. The G-MAC ultimately launched a year earlier than planned, in 2012, with Urbana as a member. The school spent only one season in the G-MAC; on August 20, 2012, Urbana was unveiled as a charter member of the MEC, a new Division II conference set to launch for the 2013–14 school year. The MEC is mostly made up of schools leaving the then-soon-to-be dissolved West Virginia Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (WVIAC), but also includes another Ohio school in Notre Dame College.

== Student life ==

=== Student organizations ===

Urbana University had several recognized student organizations including leadership groups such as Student Government Association, Campus Activities Board, and Student Athlete Advisory Committee. There were organizations with special interest topics around politics, disc golf, and cancer awareness; and there were academic groups for history students and students interested in social sciences.

=== Residence life ===

There were six residence halls on campus (South, East, Francis E. Hazard, McConnell, Sycamore, and Ross halls). Urbana&#x27;s residence halls emphasized civic responsibility, mutual respect, mature interpersonal relationships, multicultural understanding, and community engagement. Students living on campus forged friendships to last a lifetime while learning about different cultures, backgrounds and ideas, gaining an understanding of being part of a community, and developing their leadership skills. Residential living provides students with life skills that were transferable to careers and other aspects of independent living after graduation. Advice and guidance are available from trained upperclass student resident assistants and professional resident hall directors, as well as an Area Coordinator. Resident assistants lived on each floor of each residence hall and served as a resource for students dealing with any type of issue. The university&#x27;s Student Conduct programs were recognized as Ohio&#x27;s most innovative Student Affairs program in 2014 by the Ohio College Personnel Association.

<doc id="1312332" wikidata="Q880467" url="?curid=1312332" title="Black Patch Tobacco Wars">
<text>The Black Patch Tobacco Wars were a period of civil unrest and violence in the western counties of the U.S. states of Kentucky and Tennessee at the turn of the 20th century, circa 1904–1909. The so-called &quot;Black Patch&quot; consists of about 30 counties in southwestern Kentucky and northwestern Tennessee. During that period this area was the leading worldwide supplier of dark fired tobacco. It was so named for the wood smoke and fire-curing process which it undergoes after harvest. This type of tobacco is used primarily in snuff, chewing and pipe tobacco.

The primary participants were the American Tobacco Company (ATC) (owned by James B. Duke), historically one of the largest U.S. industrial monopolies, and the Dark Tobacco District Planters&#x27; Protective Association of Kentucky and Tennessee (PPA). This association of planters formed on September 24, 1904, in protest of the monopoly ATC practice of paying deflated prices for their product and with the intent to control their own product and pricing by banding together.

The initial idea of the PPA was to &quot;pool&quot; and withhold their tobacco until the ATC agreed to pay higher prices. When this plan was unsuccessful, many farmers resorted to violence and vigilante practices, organizing as the Silent Brigade or Night Riders. They committed numerous acts of violence and destroyed crops, machinery, livestock, and tobacco warehouses, even capturing whole towns. They raided Princeton, Hopkinsville, and Russellville, Kentucky, destroying tobacco warehouses.

==The players==

===The American Tobacco Company===
James Buchanan &quot;Buck&quot; Duke of North Carolina was an ambitious businessman and planter who quickly learned that profit was maximized buying and selling tobacco, not producing it. In 1879, the W. Duke Sons and Company was established as a tobacco manufacturer and began producing cigarettes. Two years later, the commercial cigarette-rolling machine was invented by James Bonsack. Duke quickly rented two of these machines, allowing his company to produce 400 cigarettes per minute. In 1884, he struck a deal with its inventor to use his machines exclusively in manufacturing cigarettes in exchange for lower royalties. The lowered manufacturing costs realized allowed him to cut his retail prices so low that his competitors couldn&#x27;t compete. By 1890, Duke was able to compel his major competitors to consolidate with him as the American Tobacco Company (ATC).

By 1900, the ATC had a stranglehold on the American market and had made inroads into foreign markets, affecting the majority of the world&#x27;s tobacco sales either directly or through foreign partnerships. Duke used this power to reduce his tobacco-buying price by eliminating the competitive bidding process. This brought many farmers to the brink of financial ruin or led to the complete loss of their farms, as they found it cost more to plant their crop than they earned on it.

The ATC&#x27;s collusive fixed-price purchasing policy, combined with a new Federal tax on tobacco, placed tobacco producers into an impossible situation.

===Dark Tobacco District Planters&#x27; Protective Association of Kentucky and Tennessee===
In 1904, Felix Ewing, a wealthy tobacco planter and owner of Glenraven Plantation near the Kentucky stateline in Adams, Tennessee, proposed a way for the Black Patch growers to regain control of their sale prices. Glenraven Plantation, developed like a company town, had its own church, stores and post office, and its residents were tenant farmers and sharecroppers. Because of the decline in sale price of their product, they were defecting to find better-paying opportunities in the cotton industry. During the summer of 1904, Ewing discussed his idea throughout the region and on September 24, 1904, hosted a meeting in Guthrie, Kentucky, attended by some 5,000 locals. He presented a plan for every farmer in the area to join a protective association whose purpose was withholding their tobacco from the Trust until buyers paid their asking price.

The group moved to form the new organization, the &quot;Dark Tobacco District Planters&#x27; Protective Association of Kentucky and Tennessee,” referred to as the PPA. Officers were appointed, and a charter drawn up and approved. One article called upon each member to use his influence and strong endeavor with those tobacco planters who are not members of the Association to become members. This provision was implemented in a way that resulted in years of unrest and violence.

The PPA gained instant popularity throughout the region, among both farmers and businessmen. For those who were indifferent about the Association, a boycott of their businesses was generally enough to convince them to join.

The number of members soared as farmers anticipated an immediate resolution to their problem, and included judges, prosecutors and law enforcement officials. However, some farmers refused to join. When the Trust fought back by offering exceptionally higher prices for tobacco sold by non-members, the number of holdouts increased. PPA members referred to these hold-outs as &quot;hillbillies&quot;.

The PPA inadvertently created new tensions in the region, dividing men who had previously worked closely together if they had opposite ideas about joining the association. This situation worsened as PPA members turned to violence to &quot;persuade&quot; former friends to join.

Conditions for the growers did not improve by 1905, causing dissension among the members who had expected an immediate turnaround. What had started as an idea for a peaceful resolution turned ugly.

==Silent Brigade and Night Riders==
Ewing fell ill and became less of a regular presence. More radical members took power, promoting a harsher approach to handling the farmers&#x27; problems. Dr. David Amoss, a farmer and country doctor from Cobb, Kentucky who lived in Caldwell County rose to a position of notoriety within the Association. He took a lead when frustrated members wanted to take stronger action.

===Possum Hunters===
&quot;In October 1905 thirty-two members of the Robertson County Branch of the PPA met at the Stainback schoolhouse in the northern part of the county and adopted the &quot;Resolutions of the committee of the Possum Hunters Organization. &quot;The possum hunters outlined their grievances against the Trust and the hillbillies and stated their intention to visit Trust tobacco buyers and hillbillies in groups of no fewer than five and no more than two thousand and use &quot;peaceful&quot; methods to convince buyers and non-poolers to adhere to the PPA.&quot;

The idea caught on quickly and Possum Hunter groups began to spring up throughout the region. They paid visits to non-PPA members, delivering stern lectures on the advisability of joining the cause. Gradually, however, their activities grew more violent.

===Rise of the Night Riders: The Black Patch turns violent. ===
Amoss had been a cadet and drillmaster at Major Ferrell&#x27;s Military School in Hopkinsville, Kentucky. He used this background to begin training his groups as paramilitary insurgents. They conducted nocturnal mounted raids, while wearing masks, hoods and robes, and riding in well-organized columns of twos. When on a mission, they muffled their mounts&#x27; hooves with cloths, and rode silently, carrying torches and lanterns. As a result, they began referring to themselves as the Silent Brigade. By mid-1906, they numbered an estimated 10,000 members.

They began beating and whipping non-compliant hillbillies, officials and Trust employees. They burned hillbillies&#x27; barns and destroyed their tobacco fields and plant beds by scraping, salting, or choking the young plants with grass seed. Amoss ordered his men to burn or otherwise destroy the property of growers, and whip them and other persons who refused to cooperate with them in their fight against the Trust.

===Raid on Princeton, Kentucky===
According to local accounts, on December 1, 1906, small groups of Night Riders drifted during the day into Princeton, Kentucky, the seat of Caldwell County. At an appointed time some raided and occupied the police station, while others simultaneously seized the telegraph and telephone offices, and the fire station, and shut off the city water supply. Some 200 masked men arrived at night, riding down the main street of Princeton. Armed with rifles, shotguns, and pistols, they began firing, waking the townspeople. As lights came on, if anyone looked out or tried to venture outside, the riders would shout &quot;stay in your houses!&quot; and &quot;keep the lights off!&quot;, then shoot to shatter windows and door frames.

The riders moved swiftly toward the J.G. Orr Tobacco Factory (located at the corner of North Seminary and West Shephardson Street), where they placed sticks of dynamite under piles of tobacco and doused the building with kerosene. They tossed a flaming torch into the warehouse, which quickly went up in flames and became a raging inferno. The raiders moved to the Steger &amp; Dollar Warehouse (located about 5 blocks south at the corner of South Seminary and Depot Street) and set it on fire as well. Then with three long whistle blasts the men came together, then slowly and methodically rode out of town singing &quot;The fires shine bright on my old Kentucky home&quot; bringing the night of terror to an end. Both warehouses were completely destroyed, along with 75 tons of non-PPA tobacco.

===Raid on Hopkinsville===
News of the Princeton raid spread rapidly. Residents of nearby Hopkinsville, the county seat of Christian County, worried that their town could be next. The police, a large contingent of armed citizens, and the state militia prepared to protect the town from the expected raid.

On January 4, 1907, Hopkinsville Mayor Charles Meacham received a telephone warning that the Riders were coming. He set the defense plan in action, and the different units were alerted and took their positions, but the warning was a hoax, a test of the city&#x27;s preparedness.

As had been the case in Princeton, Night Riders regularly drifted in and out of town to keep an eye on what was going on, in order to properly plan the raid and be prepared to pull it off at the right time. For months the riders assembled, ready to strike. On one such night as they approached the city limits, they received word the militia was waiting for them and turned back. Finally, in the early hours of December 7, 1907, the Silent Brigade struck Hopkinsville.

They left their horses outside town, and about 250 masked men marched down 9th Street to Main, where they separated and carried out their orders with military precision. Several men guarded the routes into the city and other downtown streets, while others took control of the police and fire departments, L&amp;N rail depot, and the telephone and telegraph offices, essentially cutting off communications. Others rode up and down the streets, shooting out windows whenever a light would be turned on. They held several people hostage in a makeshift corral on Main Street. Many businesses were vandalized, including the newspaper office. Lindsey Mitchell, a buyer for a local tobacco company, was dragged from his home and beaten. The Night Riders took complete control of the city.

The largest group first burned the Latham warehouse near the Rail Depot, then the Tandy and Fairleigh warehouse a few blocks away. The fires burned out of control, igniting several residences and the PPA warehouse. J.C. Felts, a brakeman working for the railroad, was shot in the back with 35 pellets of buckshot (but survived the injury) as he tried to save railcars from the fire. Dr. Amoss was accidentally wounded in the head by his own men and was taken away from town early to be treated.

As had occurred in Princeton, when the raid concluded the men assembled, and sang &quot;My Old Kentucky Home&quot; while riding out.

While the raid was taking place, Major Bassett, commander of the militia, slipped out a rear window in his house and raised a posse of eleven men to pursue the Night Riders as they left town. Because the Night Riders failed to post a rear guard, members of the posse were able to mingle with them. Several miles outside of town the Night Riders split up, with most riding off in a different direction. The posse stayed with the smaller group and opened fire, killing one man and injuring another.

As a result of the raid on Hopkinsville, the governor ordered the Kentucky Militia on active duty. Major Bassett was given command of all military operations in the area. The militia would remain on duty from December 1907 until November 1908. No raids took place where the soldiers were stationed.

===Raids on Russellville===
In the early hours of January 3, 1908, while the soldiers were guarding Hopkinsville and other towns, the Night Riders hit Russellville, Kentucky, the seat of Logan County. Using similar tactics as previously, they took over the town and dynamited two factories, one belonging to the Luckett Wake Tobacco Company and the other to the American Snuff Company. Additional violence took place in the county from the spring on, with an increasing number of attacks on blacks as tensions and violence rose.

On August 1, 1908, about one hundred masked men believed to be Night Riders entered the jail in Russellville and demanded four black prisoners: Joseph Riley, and Virgil, Robert, and Thomas Jones. The frightened jailer complied. The four men were local sharecroppers, and friends with Rufus Browder.

Browder was a sharecropper for a white landowner named James Cunningham. Cunningham and Browder had engaged in an altercation, and Cunningham hit Browder with a whip and shot him as the sharecropper had turned to walk away. Browder returned fire, killing Cunningham in self-defense. Browder was arrested and taken to another town for protection. His friends and Masonic lodge brothers, Riley and the three Jones, were arrested for allegedly having expressed approval of Browder&#x27;s actions, as well as discontent with their employers. The Night Riders are believed to have taken the four men from the jail and hanged them all from the same tree. They pinned a racist warning to the clothing of one man.

===Raids in Crittenden County===
On February 4, 1908, Crittenden County was raided for the first time. Night Riders took over the small village of Dycusburg, Kentucky, burning the tobacco warehouse and distillery of Bennett Brothers. During the raid they took W. B. Groves from his home and severely whipped him because he refused to join the Association. They also seized Henry Bennett, and after binding him to a tree, they whipped him with the branches of a thorn tree.

During the early hours of the following Sunday, February 10, the Riders attacked in the county again. They raided the farm of A. H. Cardin, a former candidate for state governor. They burned his large warehouse, which contained tobacco that he had purchased for Buckner &amp; Dunkerson of Louisville, as well as a barn containing tobacco grown on his own farm. On their way to Cardin&#x27;s farm, the Night Riders passed through the small community of Fredonia, in Caldwell County. They took over the town and held the inhabitants under guard while the raid took place on Cardin&#x27;s farm near Mexico, Kentucky.

===Raid on Birmingham, KY===
On April 9, 1908, Lyon County Night Riders crossed the Tennessee on the Birmingham Ferry, and rode into the small African-American section of the Marshall County river town of Birmingham, KY. The Night Riders fired gunshots into every home there as a warning to the African-Americans of Birmingham to move on and not be hired for the tobacco fields of the &quot;enemy&quot; tobacco growers. Apparently, most white residents of the area had been sufficiently dissuaded from working in these competitor fields, but the black residents hadn&#x27;t &quot;gotten the message&quot;, as far as the Lyon County Night Riders were concerned. The intimidation shots fired into the rows of houses unfortunately struck a few people, including the fatal wounding of an elderly African American named John Scruggs and the fatal wounding of his young grandson in the same round of fire. Some African Americans were taken from their homes and held down to be whipped.

Marshall County authorities were relentless in their investigation of this raid. Burnett Phelps was the first raider to be brought to trial. Black victims, refugees from Birmingham, were encouraged to sue in court for damages. By December 1908, two men who confessed to being lesser leaders in the raid were persuaded to turn State&#x27;s evidence and admit their crimes. However, Ed Fox, one of these men, had several younger brothers and in-laws in the Riders and was filled with remorse or fear for them. Deciding he would be better off dead, as he was about to shoot himself in the head, his wife discovered him and grabbed the pistol. He accidentally shot himself in the stomach, dying in agony a few days after Christmas, 1908. The other witness, Fred Holden, also committed suicide rather than testify. Otis Blick, a Night Rider, did testify in court, having little choice since his Night Rider mask was found hidden in a tree stump. He admitted that he was inducted into the Riders in Amous Stringer&#x27;s barbershop. After being put through some &quot;strange rites&quot;, he was taught the passwords of the Night RIders. &quot;Silent Brigade&quot; was spoken; replied with, &quot;I see you have been there&quot;; counter-replied with, &quot;Yes, on bended knees.&quot;

The Lyon County Night Riders attempted to intimidate the Marshall County Judge (Judge William Reed) and the Court at Benton, even so much as staging a ride through the town. But their tactic backfired, and led the authorities there to pursue the men even harder, seeking to bring to justice the killers of a black man and a black boy. One Dr. Emilius Champion of Lyon Co., a popular physician, was indicted by popular belief to have been the ringleader of the Lyon County Night Riders and would later serve a year in the Eddyville Kentucky State Penitentiary based on a convincing circumstantial case and eyewitness testimony. Two of the Black plaintiffs, L. A. Baker, and schoolteacher Nat Frizzell, were each awarded $25,000.00 in damages, payable by even shares from the 72 defendants. In each case, the juries were only out five minutes.

==The wars come to an end==

In April 1908, a Kentucky State Guard detachment commanded by Lieutenant Newton Jasper Wilburn led a series of raids against the Night Riders&#x27; leaders. Wilburn arrested several of the men and also provided protection to several key informers. He gained the help of former Night Riders, including Macon Champion, who implicated fifteen local farmers. The arrests broke the power of the Night Riders and effectively ended the Black Patch War. Lieutenant Wilburn was rewarded with a promotion to captain. Even though most men arrested were not convicted at trial, Capt. Wilburn&#x27;s actions helped bring law and order to the region.

===Aftermath===
By the summer of 1910, the Night Rider trouble had come to an end except for a few scattered minor episodes. The tobacco growers were now receiving higher prices for their crops. A challenge to the ATC reached the US Supreme Court, which ruled in &quot;United States v. American Tobacco Co.&quot; (1911) that the Duke trust, ATC, was a monopoly and was in violation of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act of 1890. ATC was ordered to dismantle.

Gov. Augustus E. Willson commissioned Major Bassett as a Lt. Colonel in the Kentucky Militia. Bassett was called on several times to protect witnesses during the trials of the Night Riders. Many of the Night Riders escaped prosecution while others were sued in civil courts.

John C. Latham did not rebuild his warehouse, instead donating the site to the city of Hopkinsville to be used as a park. It was named Peace Park.

Dr. Amoss faced trial in the Christian County Court, and in March 1911, he was acquitted of all charges. Nevertheless, he left the state, accompanying his physician son to New York City. He practiced medicine there until his death in 1915.

==Poetry==
THE OLD KNOTTY OAK

&lt;poem&gt;
On the old Knotty Oak in North Christian
Way out on the Kirkmansville Road,
There has lately been posted a notice,
To all farmers, the bad and the good.
Its just a &quot;guilt&quot; edged invitation
Placed there by a Night Rider brave (?)
&quot;Better join the &#x27;Sociation,
If you plant beds and barns you would save.&quot;
It was stylishly dressed up in canvas,
And written by type-writer&#x27;s hand,
It was worded in terms so expressive,
That any one might understand.
The farmers were warned to come over,
that they were in danger outside,
All tobacco must be in the union,
And the signature this &quot;Men who ride.&quot;
Now, Old Knotty has long been a landmark,
Not noted for beauty &#x27;tis true,
But a study and silent old fellow
And of secrets he&#x27;s heard quite a few.
Wiley words of the smooth politician,
Merry laughter of children at play.
Whispered wooing of lovers by moonlight,
All of these he has heard in his day,
The patient ox, the tired horses in summer
How they long for his shade by the road.
To them he&#x27;s the feed ground, the noon hour,
and rest from the weary road.
Old has held all the sale bills;
He&#x27;s proud of the nails in his side.
But his head hangs in humiliation
At the threat of the bad &quot;Men who ride.&quot;
However he&#x27;s keeping the secret,
but of course he would know just at sight
The face of the man who disgraced him,
by posting a threat in the night
The people who live near Old Knotty,
and quietly working their farms,
but they&#x27;ve nothing to lose by marauders,
No plant beds, tobacco or barns.
They are not opposed to the Union,
Its findings they would not revoke.
But they&#x27;d like a &#x27;polite invitation,
Instead of a threat to the Oak.
They&#x27;ve read long ago, in an old book,
That in Union alone man may stand;
That a house with its members divided,
Is like the one build on the sand.
then, here&#x27;s to the D.T. &#x27;Sociation,
May its principles ever abide,
Here&#x27;s to order and law in Old Christian
But contempt for the men who ride.&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;

<doc id="1312333" wikidata="Q1424568" url="?curid=1312333" title="Osteon">
<text>In osteology, the osteon or haversian system (; named for Clopton Havers) is the fundamental functional unit of much compact bone. Osteons are roughly cylindrical structures that are typically between 0.25 mm and 0.35 mm in diameter. Their length is often hard to define, but estimates vary from several millimeters to around 1 centimeter. They are present in many bones of most mammals and some bird, reptile, and amphibian species.

==Histogenesis==
The Haversian system forms during the process of endochondral ossification, which starts with a cartilage template that is gradually replaced by bone tissue. Osteoblasts, the bone-forming cells, secrete the organic components of bone matrix [osteoid] and then initiates its mineralization. As osteoblasts become surrounded by the bone matrix, they differentiate into osteocytes, which reside in the lacunae and maintain bone tissue. The osteocytes connect to each other and the Haversian canal via tiny canals called &quot;canaliculi&quot;.

==Structure==

Each osteon consists of concentric layers, or &quot;lamellae&quot;, of compact bone tissue that surround a central canal, the Haversian canal. The Haversian canal contains the bone&#x27;s blood supplies. The boundary of an osteon is the cement line.

Each Haversian canal is surrounded by varying number (5-20) of concentrically arranged lamellae of bone matrix. Near the surface of the compact bone, the lamellae are arranged parallel to the surface; these are called circumferential lamellae. Some of the osteoblasts develop into osteocytes, each living within its own small space, or lacuna. Osteocytes make contact with the cytoplasmic processes of their counterparts via a network of small transverse canals, or &quot;canaliculi&quot;. This network facilitates the exchange of nutrients and metabolic waste. Collagen fibers in a particular lamella run parallel to each other, but the orientation of collagen fibers within other lamellae is oblique. The collagen fiber density is lowest at the seams between lamellae, accounting for the distinctive microscopic appearance of a transverse section of osteons. The space between osteons is occupied by &quot;interstitial lamellae&quot;, which are the remnants of osteons that were partially resorbed during the process of bone remodeling.

Osteons are connected to each other and the periosteum by oblique channels called Volkmann&#x27;s canals or perforating canals.

=== Drifting osteons ===
Drifting osteons are a phenomenon that is not fully understood. A &quot;drifting osteon&quot; is classified as one that runs both longitudinally as well as transversely through the cortex. An osteon can &quot;drift&quot; in one direction or change directions several times, leaving a tail of lamella behind the advancing haversian canal.

==Investigative applications==
In bioarchaeological research and in forensic investigations, osteons in a bone fragment can be used to determine the sex of an individual and age, as well as aspects of taxonomy, diet, health and motor history.

Osteons and their arrangement vary according to taxon, so that genus and sometimes species can be differentiated using a bone fragment not otherwise identifiable. However, there is considerable variability among the different bones of a skeleton, and features of some faunal osteons overlap with those of human osteons; therefore, examination of osteons is not of primary use in the analyses of osteological remains. More research is needed, but osteohistology has the potential to positively affect the studies in bioarchaeology, paleontology and forensic investigations.

In recent decades, osteohistological studies of dinosaur fossils have been used to address a number of issues, such as the periodicity of growth of dinosaurs and whether it was uniform across species and the question of whether dinosaurs were warm-blooded or not.

<doc id="1312339" wikidata="Q155231" url="?curid=1312339" title="Demesne">
<text>A demesne ( ) or domain was all the land retained and managed by a lord of the manor under the feudal system for his own use, occupation, or support. This distinguished it from land sub-enfeoffed by him to others as sub-tenants. In contrast, the entire territory controlled by a monarch both directly and indirectly via their tenant lords would typically be referred to as their realm. The concept originated in the Kingdom of France and found its way to foreign lands influenced by it or its fiefdoms.

In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, royal demesne is the land held by the Crown, and ancient demesne is the legal term for the land held by the king at the time of the Domesday Book in 1086.

==Etymology==
The word derives from Old French , ultimately from Latin , &quot;lord, master of a household&quot; – &quot;demesne&quot; is a variant of &quot;domaine&quot;.

The word &quot;barton&quot;, which is historically synonymous to &quot;demesne&quot; and is an element found in many place-names, can refer to a demesne farm: it derives from Old English &quot;bere&quot; (barley) and &quot;ton&quot; (enclosure).

==Development==
The system of manorial land tenure, broadly termed feudalism, was conceived in France, but was exported to areas impacted by French expansion during the Middle Ages, including the British Isles after the Norman Conquest.

In this feudal system, the demesne was all the land retained and managed by a lord of the manor for his own use and support. It was not necessarily all contiguous to the manor house. A portion of the demesne lands, called the lord&#x27;s waste, served as public roads and common pasture land for the lord and his tenants. Most of the remainder of the land in the manor was sub-enfeoffed by the lord to others as sub-tenants.

Initially, the demesne lands were worked on the lord&#x27;s behalf by villeins or by serfs, who had no right of tenure on it, in fulfilment of their feudal obligations, but as a money economy developed in the later Middle Ages, the serfs&#x27; &quot;corvée&quot; came to be commuted to money payments. With the advent of the early modern period, demesne lands came to be cultivated by paid labourers. Eventually, many of the demesne lands were leased out either on a perpetual (i.e., hereditary) or a temporary renewable basis so that many peasants functioned virtually as free proprietors after having paid their fixed rents. In times of inflation or debasement of coinage, the rent might come to represent a pittance, reducing the feudal aristocrat to poverty among a prosperous gentry.

Demesne lands that were leased out for a term of years remained demesne lands, though no longer in the occupation of the lord of the manor. See, for example, &quot;Musgrave v Inclosure Commissioners&quot; (1874) LR 9 QB 162, a case in which the three judges of the Queen&#x27;s Bench Divisional Court and everyone else concerned assumed without argument that farms which were let by the lord of the manor were part of the lord&#x27;s demesne land.

In Ireland, demesne lands were often demarcated with high stone walls. Today, 24 townlands in Ireland bear the name of &quot;Demesne&quot;, and many others contain the word.

==Royal demesne==
Immediately following the Norman Conquest of 1066, all land in England was claimed by King William the Conqueror as his absolute title by allodial right, being the commencement of the royal demesne, also known as Crown land. The king made grants of very large tracts of land under various forms of feudal tenure from his demesne, generally in the form of feudal baronies. The land not so enfeoffed, for example royal manors administered by royal stewards and royal hunting forests, thus remained within the royal demesne. In the Domesday Book of 1086, this land is referred to as &quot;terra regis&quot; (literally &quot;the king&#x27;s land&quot;), and in English common law the term &quot;ancient demesne&quot; refers to the land that was held by the Crown at the time of the Domesday Book.

The royal demesne was not a static portfolio: it could be increased, for example, as a result of escheat or forfeiture where a feudal tenure would end and revert to its natural state in the royal demesne, or it could be reduced by later grants of land. During the reign of King George III (1760–1820), Parliament appropriated most of the royal demesne, in exchange for a fixed annual sum thenceforth payable to the monarch, called the Civil List. The royal estate of Windsor, still occupied by British monarchs and never relinquished since 1066, is a rare example of an ancient royal demesne.

In the Lordship of Ireland, King Henry II claimed a large area as the royal demesne in 1171: Dublin, its hinterland, the coastline down to Arklow and the towns of Wexford and Waterford. This region around Dublin would evolve into the Pale.

<text>Arthur Robin Christiansen (27 July 1904 – 27 September 1963) was a British journalist, and editor of Lord Beaverbrook&#x27;s newspaper the &quot;Daily Express&quot; from 1933 to 1957.

Christiansen was born in Wallasey, Cheshire to Louis Niels Christiansen, a shipwright, and his wife Ellen. From an early age, he demonstrated a talent for writing, producing a magazine for his grammar school. At 16, he became a reporter for the &quot;Wallasey and Wirral Chronicle&quot;, where he worked for three years before moving to the &quot;Liverpool Evening Express&quot; and the Liverpool &quot;Daily Courier&quot;. He was named the London editor of the &quot;Evening Express&quot; in 1925, a position he held for a year before moving to the &quot;Sunday Express&quot;.

Christiansen made his reputation four years later, when, as assistant editor, he produced a special late-morning edition of the &quot;Sunday Express&quot; to report the R101 airship disaster.

He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1957, when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at the BBC Television Theatre.

In 1961, he was cast as the editor of the &quot;Daily Express&quot; in the Fleet Street-based sci-fi thriller &quot;The Day the Earth Caught Fire&quot;, directed by Val Guest. He also played a news editor in the 1963 medical thriller &quot;80,000 Suspects&quot;, again directed by Guest.

Christiansen&#x27;s son, Michael, also became a newspaper editor; his grandson Rupert Christiansen was the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; opera critic until 2020.

<text>Marie Antoinette Wright (born February 7, 1968), better known by her stage name Free, is an American media personality, television producer, choreographer, rapper, and philanthropist. She became known as the first host (alongside A. J. Calloway) of Black Entertainment Television&#x27;s &quot;106 &amp; Park&quot; until 2005. She was later as a disc jockey at KKBT 100.3 The Beat in L.A., serving as a morning drive co-host at WPGC-FM in Washington, D.C., and is the former co-host of The Ed Lover Morning Show on Power 105.1 in New York.

==Career==
Free was born as Marie Antoinette Wright to African-American parents. She became involved in the arts as a child in Boston, Massachusetts. She attended the Roxbury Center for Performing Arts for 11 years, but traveled and toured as part of a young dance troupe. Inspired by her hometown group New Edition, she was part of a few groups in Boston performing and winning talent shows, while improving her singing and rap skills. One of her biggest breaks in her dancing career was performing in the 1991 hip-hop music video of &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; by Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch.

Free left Boston to immerse herself in her true passion: music. One of Free&#x27;s &quot;stepping stones&quot; was an internship at a radio station in Massachusetts, where she began to make a name for herself. She then made career moves between Los Angeles and New York City in an effort to build the structure of her calling. She appeared on &quot;Patriots&quot;, the second track on Can-I-Bus, the debut album from critically acclaimed hip-hop artist Canibus. This appearance was her first major appearance and the album eventually went gold. Her appearance on the album was a direct result of her professional connection with Wyclef and his Refugee Camp crew.

Free stated: “What influenced me to chase after my dreams was music itself; its power and creative medium.&quot; Fate led her to a casting held by BET, where executives chose her to co-host (with AJ Calloway) their signature show based in New York: &quot;106 &amp; Park: Top 10 Live&quot;. During her 5 years at &quot;106 &amp; Park&quot;, Free interviewed notable people such as Michael Jackson, Denzel Washington, Aaliyah, Halle Berry, Mariah Carey, 
Maxwell, Alicia Keys, Janet Jackson, and Beyonce.

In 2003, Free began to record a full-length debut studio album titled, &quot;Pressure Free&quot;, which was expected to be released in Spring of 2008. Free went on to promote the album and release rumored singles via underground mixtapes from early 2003 throughout 2007. A rumored single, &quot;Uh Huh&quot;, featuring Busta Rhymes, leaked via Internet in the aspiration of she, again generating rumors for the album. Contributors for the debut included Faith Evans, Bink, Scott Storch, Rockwilder, Kanye West, Just Blaze, Rah Digga, Timbaland, and Missy Elliott. As of 2012, there is no confirmation if the album will be released.

On December 1, 2009, Clear Channel Radio&#x27;s Power 105.1 (WWPR-FM, New York) had (along with added R&amp;B, hip hop, and old-school jams) announced that Malikha Mallette would move to co-host on &quot;The Ed Lover Show,&quot; from 5:30 AM until 9:30 AM; meanwhile, DJ Envy would be Power 105.1&#x27;s new afternoon personality, between 2:00 PM and 6:00 PM on weekdays. The announcement was made by Cadillac Jack, Power 105.1&#x27;s program director. Free stated on her Twitter page, &quot;Ok that&#x27;s a Tuesday morning for ya: As of now I will no longer be heard on Power 105 in the A.M.: NY thanks for the laughs..rock on.&quot;

In October 2010, Free returned to BET once again to produce and star in &quot;106 &amp; Park’s&quot; two-episode anniversary show, titled &quot;106 &amp; Park: 10 Years &amp; Counting&quot; and &quot;106 &amp; Park: The Celebration, 10 Years Live!&quot;. Both shows earned the highest &quot;106 &amp; Park&quot; ratings in BET history.

She could also be seen yet again on BET, as a presenter at the inaugural &quot;Black Girls Rock!&quot; on November 7, 2010.

On May 9, 2011, Free began co-hosting &quot;The Big Tigger Morning Show&quot; on “The People’s Station” WPGC (95.5 FM), serving the regions of Washington, D.C., Maryland, and Northern Virginia; she hosted alongside Darian &quot;Big Tigger&quot; Morgan from 6:00 AM until 10:00 AM, weekdays. Several months later, Big Tigger was fired, and Free continued the morning radio show without him.

On December 19, 2014, Free again returned to BET, hosting the final episode of &quot;106 &amp; Park&quot;, titled &quot;The Final Act&quot; (with Bow Wow, Terrence J and Rocsi).

==Philanthropy==
In 2002, Free founded the Free4Life Foundation, a non-profit dedicated to empowering young people in disadvantaged neighborhoods through programs that encourage literacy, financial education and creative arts. The Free4Life Foundation has created opportunities that inspire, support, encourage and strengthen the healthy development of young people in Boston&#x27;s underserved communities. Initially focused on eradicating domestic violence and improving financial literacy, Free is currently in the process of expanding the depth and breadth of the foundation&#x27;s scope. Through the foundation, Free also launched the successful fundraising event, Break! Break!.

Free is also an advocate for breast cancer awareness. In October 2010, she participated in the American Cancer Society&#x27;s &quot;Making Strides Against Breast Cancer&quot; charity walk in honor of her late mother Selina &quot;Tina&quot; Wright. She later formed team &quot;Walk 4 Tina,&quot; as she and her family walked 5.7 miles to help raise donations and awareness.

==Personal life==
As of 2023, Free lives a quiet and private life away from the media and the public eye. She maintains residences in both her hometown Boston and New York City.

Known for her collaborations with director James Cameron, she won a Saturn Award for her portrayal of Private Vasquez in his 1986 sci-fi horror film, &quot;Aliens&quot;.

Goldstein played Janelle Voight, the foster mother of John Connor, in James Cameron&#x27;s big-budget sci-fi action film &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;, which broke box office records upon its release in 1991. Next, she made cameos as a science officer in &quot;Star Trek Generations&quot; (1994), an Irish immigrant mother in &quot;Titanic&quot; (1997)—her third collaboration with Cameron—and a hotel maid in &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot; (1998). Her other notable film roles during the 1990s were supporting parts in &quot;Fair Game&quot; (1995) and &quot;Living Out Loud&quot; (1998).

<text>Caversham Bridge is a bridge across the River Thames between Caversham and the town centre of Reading. The bridge is situated on the reach above Caversham Lock, carrying the A4155 road across the river and also providing pedestrian access to the adjacent mid-river Pipers Island.

The first bridge on the site was built sometime between 1163, when a famous trial by combat was fought on nearby De Montfort Island, and 1231, when Henry III wrote to the Sheriff of Oxfordshire, commanding him:

:&quot;to go in person, taking with him good and lawful men of his county, to the chapel of St Anne on the bridge at Reading over the Thames one side of which is built on the fee of William Earl Marshal and by the view and testimony of those men see that the abbot has the same seisin of the said chapel as he had on the day the said earl died.&quot;

William Marshal was the first Earl of Pembroke, the principal landowner in the Caversham area, and regent during the early years of Henry&#x27;s reign. He had died at his home at Caversham Park in 1218.
The old bridge was the site of a skirmish during the English Civil War in 1643 and was left with a wooden drawbridge structure on the Berkshire half. The bridge was still in this state when it was depicted by Joseph Mallord William Turner in 1806/7, in a painting entitled &quot;Caversham Bridge with Cattle in the Water&quot;.

In 1869, the entire bridge was replaced by an iron lattice construction. When Reading Bridge was completed in 1923 work began on replacing Caversham Bridge with the current structure which is of concrete with a granite balustrade. It was opened in 1926 by Edward Prince of Wales.

Since late 2018, Caversham bridge has featured on the club crest of local football team Caversham United Football Club.

<doc id="1312374" wikidata="Q843944" url="?curid=1312374" title="Nomura Securities">
<text>is a Japanese financial services company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Nomura Holdings, Inc. (NHI), which forms part of the Nomura Group. It plays a central role in the securities business, the group&#x27;s core business. Nomura is a financial services group and global investment bank. Based in Tokyo, Japan, with regional headquarters in Hong Kong, London, and New York, Nomura employs about 26,000 staff worldwide; it is known as Nomura Securities International in the US, and Nomura International plc. in EMEA. It operates through five business divisions: retail (in Japan), global markets, investment banking, merchant banking, and asset management.

Established December 25, 1925 in Osaka, it is the oldest brokerage firm in Japan. It is named after its founder Tokushichi Nomura II, a wealthy Japanese businessman and investor.

On May 7, 2001, to plan for Nomura&#x27;s restructuring as a holding company, the company was established to take over the financial division which was taken effect on October of that year.

==History==
===Background (before 1925)===
Nomura was founded by Tokushichi Nomura, father of Nomura Securities founder Tokushichi Nomura II as a money changing business. This was just before the Meiji Restoration, the move to setting up a bank was a logical extension and progression of this business as times changed. Changes included the founding of stock exchanges in Tokyo and Osaka as the country became industrialised. Key amongst these changes was the Japanese government&#x27;s decision to issue foreign currency denominated public bonds to fund the Russo-Japanese war; Nomura employed English speaking staff so that they could take on this international business.

By 1906 Nomura had founded an in-house research department headed up by former Osaka newspaper journalist Kisaku Hashimoto. This was responsible for publishing the Osaka Nomura Business News with trading news, stock analysis and current economic trends. Research combined with a substantial newspaper advertising campaign helped raise the profile of Nomura. By 1917, Nomura had gone public and soon after Osaka Nomura Bank (the present day Resona Bank) was set up, within this business there was a securities section to handle bond sales and underwriting.

===Origins to 2001===
On December 25, 1925, the Nomura Securities Co., Ltd. (NSC) was established in Osaka, as a spin-off from Securities Dept. of Osaka Nomura Bank Co. (later known as Daiwa Bank and now Resona Bank). NSC initially focused on the bond market. It was named after its founder Tokushichi Nomura II, the son of Tokushichi Nomura and a wealthy Japanese stockbroking tycoon. He had earlier established Osaka Nomura bank in 1918, based on the Mitsui zaibatsu model with a capital of ¥10 million. Like the majority of Japanese conglomerate, or zaibatsu, its origins were in Osaka, but today Is based in Tokyo.

By 1927, Nomura had opened a New York office. NSC gained the authority to trade stock in 1938, and went public in 1961. In 1981, the company became a member of the New York Stock Exchange, followed five years later by its membership in the London Stock Exchange.

===2001 to present===
On October 1, 2001 Nomura adopted a holding company structure with the exisiting company rebranding to Nomura Holdings, Inc. and a newly-formed wholly-owned subsidiary of Nomura Holdings being established to take over the financing division which would retain the Nomura Securities name.

In February 2007 it purchased the US based broker and trading technology provider Instinet. In October 2008 Nomura acquired Lehman Brothers&#x27; business in the Asia Pacific region including Japan, Hong Kong and Australia; together with Lehman Brothers investment banking and equities business in Europe and the Middle East and hired a number of people from Lehman&#x27;s fixed-income business. In 2007, Lehman international businesses were responsible for half of the bank&#x27;s total revenue. The acquisition made Nomura the world&#x27;s largest independent investment bank with Y20,300bn (£138bn) assets under management according to the &quot;Financial Times&quot;. According to &quot;Bloomberg&quot;, in the wake of the financial crisis, Nomura did not take any government bail-out money In 2010 Nomura acquired a stake in Bank of Ireland according to publicly available data.

In a bid to move the company&#x27;s focus from Japan to global markets, the global headquarters for investment banking was moved out of Tokyo to London in April 2009 as part of a stated aim by Hiromi Yamaji, Nomura&#x27;s chief executive of global investment banking to move the company&#x27;s focus from Japan to global markets.

On July 27, 2009 the Federal Reserve Bank of New York designated Nomura a primary dealer for Federal Reserve System open market operations and U.S. Treasury securities auctions. Tricorn Partners LLP was acquired on December 16, 2009 to further expand its investment banking business. Nomura operates across 18 exchanges globally and holds a number of primary dealerships. In late May 2017, Nomura Securities paid for Venezuelan government bonds valued at $100 million, paying $30 million for the debt at a steep discount. In 2017, Nomura has chosen Frankfurt am Main, Germany as its new EU hub after brexit.

On 15 June 2021, a colony of small-flowered tongue-orchids were found growing in the rooftop garden of Nomura&#x27;s London HQ. The species, which is native to the Mediterranean Basin and Atlantic coast of Western Europe, was thought extinct in the UK, as no sightings of the plant had been recorded since 1989 prior to the discovery of the colony.

==Operations==
Nomura provides a range of services through the capital markets including equities and fixed income trading, brokerage, underwriting, offering, secondary offering and private placement of securities. The investment banking arm provides corporate and leveraged financing.

Nomura previously made most of its profits in the Japanese retail banking market but has expanded its international investment banking capabilities.
Nomura divides its operations up into three regional areas, Americas, Asia-Pacific and Europe, Middle East &amp; Africa (EMEA). The American operations are predominantly focused on offices in the New York and New Jersey areas with additional offices in Toronto, Canada and Bermuda, employing 1,300 staff in the US; investment banking in the US is headed up by Glenn Schiffman. There are 32 offices across the Asia Pacific region headquarters are located in Hong Kong, including Australia, China, Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore and Taiwan. EMEA employs 4,500 people in 18 countries, the chairman is Colin Marshall and the CEO is Jeremy Bennett. In December 2009 Reuters reported that Nomura had raised $7 billion of extra funding through issuing additional shares.

Nomura&#x27;s four business lines (global markets, investment banking, merchant banking and asset management) are coordinated globally but each European operating entity is incorporated and regulated separately and reports to local management as well as Tokyo-based business leads.

<text>In the Battle of Giornico (Italian: &quot;Battaglia di Giornico,&quot; &quot;dei Sassi Grossi&quot;; German: &quot;Schlacht bei Giornico&quot;) (28 December 1478) a Swiss force of 600 defeated 10,000 Milanese troops.

==History==
The Battle of Giornico was part of an expansionist policy of the Old Swiss Confederation during the 15th century. The confederation attempted to expand into the southern foothills of the Alps to gain control of both ends of the valuable mountain passes. In November 1478, Uri troops moved south over the Gotthard pass into the Leventina valley. The population of the valley, who had long been opposed to Milan, greeted the Swiss troops as liberators and allies. However, below the valley at Bellinzona, they found the city gates closed. Uri was quickly joined by forces from other Confederation cantons and established a siege camp below the walls of Bellinzona on 30 November 1478. The Duke of Milan responded by sending 10,000 men toward Bellinzona to drive the Confederates back and reassert his control over the Leventina.

==The battle==
On 16 December the Milanese army reached Magadino on Lake Maggiore about from Bellinzona. However, the Confederates had already retired, after a 14-day siege of Bellinzona, to the Gotthard Pass. Only a 175-strong reserve army, reinforced by about 400 soldiers from the Leventina, were guarding the rear at Giornico in the Leventina valley. The entire Milanese army reached Giornico on 28 December 1478 and outnumbered the defenders by about twenty-to-one. The defenders were able to defeat the much larger force because the Milanese army was confined in a narrow valley, struggling for foothold on the December snow and ice. The Swiss ambushed the army from above, creating confusion by rolling large boulders down the hillside. They reportedly also wore crampons for better foothold. Against this attack, the Milanese army was helpless regardless of its superior number, and they were forced to flee, leaving an estimated 1,400 dead.

==Aftermath==
Following this decisive defeat, the Duke of Milan withdrew from the Leventina, leaving it under Uri&#x27;s control. The treaty of Lucerne was signed on 3 March 1480 establishing the cession of Leventina from Milan to Uri.

To consolidate his power in Bellinzona, the Duke of Milan built the small Sasso Corbaro castle. Nine years later, the Swiss and the Milanese met again, in 1487, at the Battle of Crevola.

<text>&quot;Karnevalsbotschafter&quot; (Carnival&#x27;s Ambassador) op. 270 is a waltz composed by Johann Strauss II in the autumn of 1862 during his honeymoon with his first wife Henrietta Treffz in Venice. It was first performed at the 50th anniversary celebration of the Vienna&#x27;s Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde (Society of Friends of Music in Vienna) at the &#x27;Sperl&#x27; dance hall on 11 November 1862.

Trumpets announce the first bars, before a loud chord interrupts; signalling the waltz proper. Pizzicato strings support the first waltz theme although other instruments carry the main melody. Waltz 1B is punctuated by loud chords and is loud for the entire passage. Waltz 2A has triangles as accompaniment whereas waltz 2B is gentle. Waltz 3A starts with a brief intrada and is decorated with trills whereas waltz 3B&#x27;s principal melody is carried by cellos and double basses. Waltz 4A is livelier than the previous waltz part and waltz 4B is dominated by the flute. Waltz 5B has a timpani beat and waltz 5B reconciles the earlier sections. A brief coda is introduced and waltz 1B is repeated. Without halting nor slowing down for a moment, the first waltz theme makes a re-entry, before rising chords heralds its close, complete with a snare-drumroll and brass flourish.

<doc id="1312404" wikidata="Q7927457" url="?curid=1312404" title="Victory Aircraft">
<text>Victory Aircraft Limited was a Canadian manufacturing company that, during the Second World War, built mainly British-designed aircraft under licence. It acted as a shadow factory, safe from the reach of German bombers.

Initially the major wartime contract to manufacture Avro Lancaster heavy bombers was to go to the National Steel Car Ltd. headquartered in Hamilton, utilizing the Malton factory (near today&#x27;s Toronto Pearson International Airport). National Steel Car was already producing Westland Lysander aircraft (Malton 1938–1939) and involved as a subcontractor in the manufacture of Hawker Hurricane fighters (1939-1943), Avro Anson trainers (Montreal 1941–1945) and Handley Page Hampden bombers (Malton and Montreal 1939-1941?). Questions arising as to the company&#x27;s ability to manage the project led to the government&#x27;s expropriation of the plant on 4 November 1942 and the setting up of the Crown Corporation, Victory Aircraft Limited, incorporated under the Department of Munitions and Supply Act, 1940 c.31. J.P. Bickell, one of C.D. Howe&#x27;s &quot;dollar-a-year men&quot; headed Victory Aircraft Ltd. as president and chairman of the board.

== Wartime production ==

Although originally designated to produce the Martin B-26 Marauder medium bomber, the Malton plant received a contract on 18 September 1941 to build the Avro Lancaster Mk X heavy bomber. When the first drawings arrived in January 1942, the complexity of the project seemed daunting. Some 500,000 manufacturing operations were involved in manufacturing over 55,000 separate components that went into a Lancaster (excluding engines and turrets and small items such as rivets, nuts and bolts).

== Avro Lancaster X ==

A Lancaster Mk I (R5727) from Avro Aircraft (UK) was flown across the Atlantic in August 1942, to act as a &quot;pattern&quot; aircraft for production. Differences between the British Lancasters and the Canadian built versions (known as the Mk X) revolved around engines, instruments and radio equipment being manufactured in Canada or the United States instead of England. The Rolls-Royce Merlin engines were the same design, but manufactured by Packard in the United States. A later series Lancaster Mk X replaced the original Frazer-Nash FN 50 mid-upper turret with a US-made Martin 250CE turret moved to a new location farther back on the upper fuselage due to differences in weight between that unit and the original turret. All major sub-assemblies of the Canadian Lancasters were interchangeable with the British versions so that in the event of damage, spare parts were immediately at hand.

Initially, all components were built at Malton except for the bomb doors, flaps, ailerons and elevators, that were produced by Ottawa Car &amp; Aircraft Ltd. Later, more of the parts were subcontracted out with Canadian General Electric Co. Ltd. of Toronto constructing the fuel tanks, tailplane, fins and rudders, while the outer wings were subcontracted to the Fleet Aircraft Limited plant in Fort Erie, Ontario.

From the first blueprints arriving to the first test flight took only 16 months, an impressive accomplishment, not lost on Avro (UK) management. The Malton work force climbed from 3,300 (1942) to 9,521 in 1944, most of them initially unskilled workers and about a quarter of them women. Almost exactly a year to the day from when the &quot;pattern&quot; aircraft was flown to Canada, the Canadian prototype, (serial number KB700), rolled off the Victory Aircraft assembly line on 1 August 1943. Named the &quot;Ruhr Express,&quot; much publicity was made of its christening, first flight and its departure (albeit delayed as the prototype was wheeled out missing some of its essential gear and was barely able to fly) to England. Nevertheless, the Avro Lancaster setting off for war was an occasion for which the country could be proud.

Eventually, Lancaster production at Victory Aircraft Ltd. reached the impressive mark of one aircraft per day. After being ferried to England and sent to operational squadrons, the Canadian &quot;Lancs&quot; were assigned to No. 6 Group RCAF, the Canadian component of RAF Bomber Command, to complete this &quot;all-Canadian&quot; contribution to the war effort. The Lancaster X was also slated to equip the RCAF bomber squadrons for the British Commonwealth Tiger Force for the bombing of Japan however the war with Japan ended before the force was sent overseas. The Malton plant went on to build by war&#x27;s end, a total of 3,629 Avro aircraft: 3,197 Ansons, 430 Mk X Lancasters (including six Lancastrian transport conversions), one Mk XV Lincoln heavy bomber, and a single York transport.

== End of Victory Aircraft ==

Victory Aircraft ceased operations on 11 November 1945. In 1945, the Canadian government sold Victory Aircraft to Hawker Siddeley Group who used it for their subsidiary A.V. Roe Canada Ltd (known as Avro Canada).

<doc id="1312407" wikidata="Q7561972" url="?curid=1312407" title="Sonning Bridge">
<text>Sonning Bridge is a road bridge across the River Thames at Sonning, Berkshire. It links Sonning with Sonning Eye (Oxfordshire) and crosses the Thames on the reach above Shiplake Lock, just short of Sonning Lock. It is a brick arch bridge completed in 1775, to replace an earlier wooden bridge. The bridge has been the subject of many paintings and prints by artists and is a Grade II listed building.
The road extends to the two Sonning Backwater Bridges. One is over the backwater downstream of the weir and the other is over the millrace which is between the two main branches.

The Thames Path crosses the river at this point.

==History==
The earliest definite reference to a &quot;timber&quot; bridge is around 1530, although there are claims that there was a wooden old Saxon bridge here before 1125. It was spoken of as being rebuilt in 1604, although throughout the 17th century there are reports of decay and the need for repair.

A stone marker at the centre of the bridge is marked &quot;B | O&#x27;&quot; (for the counties of Berkshire and Oxfordshire on each side of the river) with the vertical line indicating the exact boundary down the middle of the river. This is an ancient border which used to be between Wessex and Mercia. 

In the 18th century, the bridge presumably gave Dick Turpin a convenient escape route from Berkshire to Oxfordshire when he was staying at his aunt&#x27;s inn in Sonning.

At the beginning of the 20th century, there were complaints about traction engines causing structural problems with the old wooden backwater bridges at Sonning and disturbing the peace. The wooden backwater bridges were not replaced until the 20th century. 

The bridge became a Grade II listed building on 1 August 1952.

==Traffic==
Sonning Bridge has traffic lights because it is too narrow for traffic in both directions simultaneously. It is the only road bridge across the Thames between Henley-on-Thames and Reading. Thus there are large queues during the morning and evening rush hours. An additional bridge to relieve the traffic problems has been a subject of debate for many years. In 2019, Transport for South East proposed a bridge at Playhatch, but while supported by local councils in Berkshire, the bid for funds from the Department for Transport was opposed by Oxfordshire.

==Art installations==
Beginning in the second decade of the 21st century, the anonymous artist Impro has affixed a series of objects to a supporting buttress of the bridge: the frontage of a letterbox (2013), a front door with floating doormat (2016), a telephone labelled &quot;Emergency Flood Line&quot; (2021), another postbox (2022), a urinal (2023). and a cashpoint (2024).

==Adjacent buildings==
Close to the bridge are the Great House, a hotel on the southern bank, the Mill at Sonning, now a theatre, on an island between two branches of the river, and the French Horn, another hotel on the northern bank.

<doc id="1312411" wikidata="Q6455430" url="?curid=1312411" title="L!VE TV">
<text>L!VE TV was a British television station that was operated by Mirror Group Newspapers on cable television from 12 June 1995 until 5 November 1999. It was later revived for Sky from 2003. In 2006, L!VE TV&#x27;s name was changed to Babeworld to reflect the channel&#x27;s gradual change of focus towards &quot;adult material&quot;.

==Background==
L!VE TV was proposed by David Montgomery as part of MGN&#x27;s move into pay television and due to the dominance on satellite of Sky Television, the decision was made to launch channels exclusively on cable. 

In February 1995, Mirror Television, a Mirror Group plc subsidiary, bought flagship cable channel Wire TV which included sports content shown at certain times during Wire&#x27;s output. Sports programming on Wire had recently been expanded when several sporting rights were acquired, such as Vauxhall Conference football, the live broadcast rights to Lennox Lewis&#x27;s WBC title fights and the 1996 Cricket World Cup, plus other sporting coverage following a deal with Chrysalis Sport. Mirror Group planned to turn Sportswire into a separate channel to operate alongside L!VE TV, both of which would replace Wire. Wire was closed on 31 May of that year; however TCI (owners of Telewest) and NYNEX made a deal with British Sky Broadcasting, which included a clause that the cable operators would not launch any rival channels to those already operated by Sky. Consequently, Sportswire collapsed just days before it was due to launch, leaving Mirror Television with just L!ve TV.

==First incarnation (1995–1999)==
At its launch in 1995, the station was headed by Kelvin MacKenzie with Janet Street-Porter as managing director. Presented by an on-air team of young presenters who were mostly new to TV, Street-Porter created a channel based around presenter-led blocks of live broadcasting from its base on the 24th floor of London&#x27;s Canary Wharf building. The output was orientated towards a rolling mix of celebrities, interviews, reviews, lifestyle features and reports from events and happenings across the UK.

Three months after going on air, Street-Porter left due to clashes with MacKenzie over content. MacKenzie axed the rolling content and replaced it with programmes that received much media coverage but low viewer figures. These included &quot;Topless Darts&quot;, produced by future &quot;Times&quot; journalist Sathnam Sanghera with commentary by comedian Jimmy Frinton, the surreal talent show &quot;Spanish Archer&quot;, &quot;Talgarth Trousers&quot; (a comedy sketch show) and &quot;Canary Wharf&quot;, a soap opera which used the station&#x27;s offices in London Docklands as a set. Other features were the weather read in Norwegian by a blonde model (Eva Bjertnes or Anne-Marie Foss) wearing a bikini, &quot;Britain&#x27;s Bounciest Weather&quot; with Rusty Goffe (known, although uncredited, for his appearance as an Oompa Loompa in the 1971 film &quot;Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory&quot;) who due to his small stature bounced on a trampoline while doing the forecast (bouncing higher the further north he was talking about), &quot;Tiffany&#x27;s Big City Tips&quot;, in which model Tiffany Banister gave the financial news while stripping to her underwear, &quot;Painted Ladies&quot;, which involved topless girls &quot;painting&quot; on large sheets of paper with various body parts and the News Bunny, a person in a rabbit suit who stood behind a newsreader making gestures and expressions for each item. 

Considered cheap and always accused of poor taste, the channel never captured more than 1% of the British television audience under MGN, and at its worst was losing around £7 million a year. It was often described as &quot;tabloid television&quot;, in part due to its control by MGN and because MacKenzie had been editor of &quot;The Sun&quot;.

L!VE TV had a teletext service, initially operated by Intelfax Ltd.

===Sport===
The channel also broadcast sport. The first event shown by the channel was the 1995 Rugby League World Cup and due to the BBC deciding only to show the opening match, the semi-finals and the final live, the channel was the only place to see live coverage of the majority of the games. L!VE also aired the 1995 darts World Masters, greyhound racing and weekly highlights from the 1998–99 Football Conference.

In 1996, Mirror Television entered the bidding process with Carlton Television for rights to show FA Premier League football but they were beaten by Sky Sports.

Shortly before its demise in 1999, it was said that the channel would, once again, bid for rights to show the FA Premier League, but given the size of the financial commitment required, it is likely that it was merely a publicity stunt.

===Local L!VE TV channels===
Part of the overall plan for L!ve TV was for a network of local L!ve TV channels and at the end of 1995 and during 1996 the first local channels launched in Liverpool and Edinburgh. These channels featured both local content and programming from London. A local version was also carried on BT-owned Westminster Cable, featuring local headlines but had fewer and shorter opt-outs than the Liverpool and Edinburgh channels. Around 20 stations had been planned to launch by the end of the 1990s but only a small number ever made it to air.

==Closure==
L!VE TV ceased broadcasting on 5 November 1999 at 6 pm with a pre-recorded farewell message from the station&#x27;s production team.

Earlier in the day, L!VE TV&#x27;s local channels had aired their final local programmes before handing over to the national channel ahead of the 6pm closedown.

==Second incarnation (2003–2006)==
In 2003, L!VE TV returned as a free channel on Sky, first on EPG 274, then on 214. Its content was almost entirely archive from L!VE TV. Then in 2004, following competitor channels, its risqué archive of late-night offerings was supplemented with banners advertising adult text messaging.

Towards the end of 2005, the evening and late night were turned over to promoting adult text and phone-in services, involving models stripping to entice viewers into phoning or texting the studio. This was under the pretence that the viewer would get to talk to a studio guest.

By February 2006, content had dwindled to little more than these shows and it was moved to the adult section of Sky&#x27;s EPG on 28 February 2006. Two days later, the name changed to Babeworld, ending links to the MGN operation. Babeworld closed on 22 October 2011, two days prior to Ofcom publishing a notice of revocation for its broadcast licence, ending eight years of the active Sky channel slot.

==2007–present==
A number of archive programmes from L!VE TV, including &quot;The Why Files&quot; and &quot;Lie Detector&quot; were shown on My Channel, formerly known as Eat Cinema, on Sky channel 199.

The entire L!VE TV archive and the rights to the channel&#x27;s programming were sold on eBay in May 2013 with the winner of the sale buying the entire programming archive for £14,100.

<doc id="1312416" wikidata="Q7955018" url="?curid=1312416" title="WRGB">
<text>WRGB (channel 6) is a television station licensed to Schenectady, New York, United States, serving the Capital District as an affiliate of CBS. It is owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group alongside CW affiliate WCWN (channel 45). The two stations share studios on Balltown Road in Niskayuna, New York; WRGB&#x27;s transmitter is located on the Helderberg Escarpment west of New Salem.

WRGB is notable for being one of the first television stations in the world. It began broadcasting experimentally in early 1928, with the first daily programs being broadcast later that year. It later became one of a handful of television stations licensed for commercial broadcasting operation before the end of World War II, being the fourth overall to sign on and by far the smallest TV station during World War II.

The station launched the on-camera careers of TV chefs Art &quot;Mr. Food&quot; Ginsburg in the mid-1970s; and of Rachael Ray, who launched her &quot;30 Minute Meals&quot; segment on WRGB&#x27;s newscasts in the mid-1990s.

==History==
===W2XCW===
One of the first experimental television stations in the world, WRGB traces its roots to an experimental station founded on January 13, 1928, and broadcast from the General Electric facility in Schenectady under the call letters W2XCW. It was popularly known as &quot;WGY Television&quot; after its sister radio station (though WMAK, the predecessor of modern station WBEN in Buffalo also had partial control of the station, which was relinquished shortly after the station signed on). W2XCW operated a very limited schedule, with 30 kW on 2.1–2.2 MHz (video) and 92 meters (approx. 3.258 MHz) (audio). It transmitted 24 vertical lines of resolution at a rate of 20 frames per second.

===W2XAF===
The W2XCW callsign disappeared around 1932. By 1930, GE had begun audio transmission on shortwave; one of these transmitters, W2XAF, was pressed into service during off-hours for further television experiments, which continued through the 1930s. Toward the end of that decade, General Electric teamed up with other experimental broadcasters to adopt an all-electronic TV standard that was created by RCA.

===W2XB===
In 1938, General Electric announced plans to build and operate a standalone TV station, and applied for an FCC license. It was granted the callsign W2XB, which took to the air in 1939. It moved into the VHF band using a 6 MHz-wide channel and improved resolution (gradually increasing from 343 to 441 to 525 lines). In 1940, it began sharing programs with W2XBS (forerunner of WNBC) in New York City, receiving the New York station directly off the air from a mountaintop and rebroadcasting the signal, becoming NBC&#x27;s first television affiliate. Later, the New York connection was achieved via coaxial cable and eventually by satellite. The NBC affiliation would last for 42 years.

===WRGB===

In 1942, W2XB opted to end experimental broadcasts and begin commercial programming. While the call sign WGY-TV was available, the company applied for and received the call sign WRGB, in honor of pioneering electric engineer Walter Ransom Gail Baker. WRGB signed on for the first time on February 26, 1942; becoming the second outside of New York City (after WPTZ in Philadelphia, now KYW-TV) and the fourth overall in the United States. The station moved into a state-of-the-art studio on Washington Avenue in Schenectady. It was the first building in the nation specifically designed for television.

In 1948, WRGB took on secondary affiliations with the three other networks in operation (CBS, ABC, and DuMont). At the time of the announcement, the station only broadcast for 28 hours a week. On January 4, 1954, it moved from channel 4 to channel 6 to alleviate interference from WNBC-TV (then known as WRCA-TV) and Boston&#x27;s WBZ-TV, and increased its radiated power approximately fourfold to 93,000 watts. WRGB dropped its secondary affiliations when WCDA (channel 41, now WTEN on channel 10) and WTRI (channel 35, now WNYT on channel 13) took the ABC and CBS affiliations respectively. From 1939 till 1957, the station&#x27;s studio were located on Washington Avenue in downtown Schenectady. In 1957, WRGB moved to its current studio on Balltown Road on the line between Niskayuna and Schenectady; the old studio is currently occupied by Schenectady County Community College.

The longest-running locally produced children&#x27;s television show, &quot;Freihofer&#x27;s Breadtime Stories&quot; was broadcast on the station starting November 21, 1949. WRGB produced two of the longest-running locally produced programs in television history: a quiz show called &quot;Answers Please&quot; and a bowling program entitled &quot;TV Tournament Time&quot;. After the cancellation of both by the late-1980s, WRGB&#x27;s local programming has been variable and erratic, ranging from a local home shopping show to a weekly video countdown done with Top 40 stations WFLY and (later) WKKF.

In 1979, General Electric almost filed to sell WRGB to Group Six Broadcasting during a proposed General Electric merger with Cox Broadcasting, with Group Six being led by the station&#x27;s general manager and vice president James J. Delmonico, which paid $24 million, but the deal apparently fell through due to a lack of FCC approval.

On September 28, 1981, WRGB swapped affiliations with WAST (which would become what is now WNYT on the day of the switch) and became a CBS affiliate. WAST had only picked up the CBS affiliation four years earlier, but had remained stubbornly in third place behind WRGB and WTEN. Under the circumstances, when its affiliation contract with WAST ran out, CBS jumped at the chance to align with long-dominant WRGB. The switch made WRGB the third station in the Capital District to affiliate with CBS, with the newly rechristened WNYT taking over the NBC affiliation. The network had originally aired on WTRI, forerunner of WNYT, from 1954 to 1955, then moved to WCDA (now WTEN) from 1955 to 1977.

In April 1983, 55 years of General Electric ownership ended when it sold WRGB to Universal Communications Corporation which was owned by Forstmann Little and John D. Backe, a former CBS president and then president of Tomorrow Entertainment (GE would re-enter the TV business upon its purchase of RCA, then-parent company of NBC in late 1985, which WRGB was formerly affiliated with). WRGB was sold to Freedom Communications in March 1986. In 1987, WRGB won the Broadcast Pioneers Golden Mike Award and shortly thereafter was awarded a Presidential Citation by Ronald Reagan.

In September 2003, WRGB-DT (UHF channel 39) became the first full-market digital signal to sign on in the Albany region. Around December 2007, WRGB and WCWN became the first television stations in the Capital District that upgraded to high definition time delay and rebroadcast capability, and high definition local broadcasts. This allows broadcasting of syndicated shows in high definition. WRGB changed its on-air name to &quot;CBS 6&quot; in October 2004.

Providence Equity Partners owned a controlling stake in Newport Television (formerly Clear Channel Communications&#x27; television division), the owner of local Fox affiliate WXXA (channel 23). As a result, the FCC granted conditional approval of Newport&#x27;s acquisition of Clear Channel Television in late November 2007, provided that Providence Equity Partners would follow through with its planned divestiture of its 16 percent share of Freedom Communications to another company (as required when Providence Equity Partners purchased a minority stake in the Spanish-language broadcaster Univision earlier in 2007) as soon as the deal was finalized. Freedom filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in September 2009, emerging in April 2010. At that point, Providence Equity Partners relinquished its stake in Freedom Communications, making its purchase of WXXA legitimate.

Freedom announced on November 2, 2011, that it would bow out of television and sell its stations, including WRGB, to Sinclair Broadcast Group. The group deal closed on April 2, 2012, after which Sinclair obtained a waiver allowing the company to keep both WRGB and WCWN. In 2016, WRGB adopted a logo similar to that of sister station WSYX in Columbus, Ohio, replacing the ABC logo with that of the CBS eye.

===FM audio===
WRGB&#x27;s former analog TV signal used an FM audio carrier which could be heard on 87.75 FM in areas where the video signal could be received (and somewhere it could not); the same was true of all analog channel 6 television stations in North America. Many channel 6 stations would then promote this avenue for commuters to listen to their morning and early evening newscasts, or severe weather and breaking news coverage on their car stereos, including WRGB.

However, this analog FM carrier no longer existed for digital television stations after the June 12, 2009, conversion to digital, but remained in effect for analog low-powered stations on channel 6 until they too transitioned on July 13, 2021, where now only a few stations are broadcasting an FM audio carrier signal on 87.75 alongside an ATSC 3.0 carrier signal.

When WRGB shifted its digital broadcasts to channel 6 with the full-power digital transition, Freedom proposed an unconventional approach to retain the analog audio broadcast, requesting to operate an analog FM radio transmitter at the far right edge of its allocated spectrum, using vertical polarization to retain compatibility with standard broadcast car stereos. This idea was once proposed by New York City&#x27;s WNYZ-LP in 2008. According to WRGB&#x27;s site, &quot;We hope that the FCC will allow us to continue to operate on 87.7. We are building a unique transmitter for 87.7 that can operate simultaneously with our DTV signal on channel 6. TV transmissions always use horizontal antennas. Our new 87.7 transmitter will be vertically polarized. The use of vertical polarization for 87.7 will allow reception of our audio in a car radio or any other FM radio with a whip type antenna.&quot;

WRGB would be the only full-power station to propose such a solution, with only WITI in Milwaukee attempting to continue to carry its Channel 6 television audio in some form by contracting with Clear Channel to lease an HD Radio subchannel of radio station WMIL-FM until the mid-2010s. WPVI-TV in Philadelphia, the nearest full-power channel 6, expressed an interest in the technology, but backed off due to overall rights issues for its programming and continuing issues regarding reception of their station throughout the market (which would have been complicated more by side-channel analog audio).

The station received an experimental special temporary authorization from the FCC to allow it to test the FM audio system but it had to cease operations when it was found to cause RF interference with the digital TV signal.

On July 7, 2009, WRGB resumed its radio simulcast broadcasts on a frequency of 87.9 FM, without explicit FCC authorization. Less than two months later, on August 24, the FCC ordered WRGB to turn off the 87.9 transmitter. All efforts to carry an analog FM audio signal were abandoned with the sale of WRGB to Sinclair (a company that is a major stakeholder in the ATSC 3.0 standard), and its 2022 shift to UHF transmission made any renewal of the effort impossible as it no longer has access to the VHF channel 6 spectrum.

===Power boost and proposed translators===
As noted above, on June 12, 2009, WRGB became a digital-only station. The station vacated its digital transition UHF channel 39 and moved its digital operations to their former analog channel assignment on VHF-low channel 6. After the digital transition, some viewers in the Capital District had receptions issues with the WRGB signal. So WRGB boosted their power twice: Once in July 2009 at the power level of 11.5 kW with an interference agreement with WPVI-TV in Philadelphia and WEDY in New Haven, Connecticut, and in late January 2010, the FCC granted an STA for WRGB to boost their power again at their current level of 30.2 kW. An application was filed in June 2009 to operate at the current level on a permanent basis. That application was granted on March 16, 2011.

WRGB has also filed applications for three digital replacement translators to fill in some of the coverage-loss areas, which have all been granted construction permits. One will be in Schenectady on the station&#x27;s pre-transition digital allotment on UHF channel 39, another one will be in Kingston on UHF channel 24, and the last one will be in Pittsfield on UHF channel 19. The Kingston translator became operational in May 2011.

Upon the purchase of WCWN, Sinclair added a simulcast of WRGB&#x27;s main signal in a reduced 720p form on WCWN-DT3, allowing viewers with no access to the main WRGB VHF signal in the core of the Capital Region to use WCWN&#x27;s UHF signal for reception of WRGB programming.

===WNYA and WCWN involvement===
In April 2003, WRGB signed a joint sales agreement with the area&#x27;s fledgling UPN affiliate WNYA several months prior to that station&#x27;s sign-on in September. Under the agreement, WRGB handled advertising sales for WNYA and shared syndicated programming with the station. The agreement, originally set to expire at the end of August 2006, was extended to the end of 2008, but was terminated in February 2007. Since September 5, 2006, WNYA has been the area&#x27;s MyNetworkTV affiliate.

On June 19, 2006, Freedom Communications announced the purchase of current CW affiliate WCWN from Tribune Broadcasting for $17 million. Since the Capital District does not have enough full-powered stations to legally permit duopolies, Freedom applied for a &quot;failed station&quot; waiver to acquire WCWN. The waiver was granted on November 22, and the purchase was finalized on December 6, giving the Capital Region market its first duopoly. Until the end of the JSA with WNYA, WRGB had control of three stations in the market. (In 2013, WNYA would also be acquired through a &quot;failing station&quot; waiver when Hubbard Broadcasting, owner of rival NBC affiliate WNYT, bought WNYA.)

During past airings of the annual &quot;Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon&quot;, WNYA took on the responsibility of airing WRGB&#x27;s local and network lineup. This role was later shifted to WCWN, which also aired CBS&#x27; coverage of the US Open Tennis Championship. This was no longer necessary starting with Jerry Lewis&#x27; retirement as telethon host and MDA chairman in 2011, as the telethon was significantly shortened to six hours on the night before Labor Day that year. Starting in 2013, WTEN broadcast the telethon, shortened again to two hours and retitled the &quot;MDA Show of Strength&quot;, as it moved to ABC from syndication for the event&#x27;s remaining two years, ending after the 2014 edition.

==News operation==
For most of its first half-century on the air, WRGB was the dominant news station in the Capital District. This was in part because of its status as the area&#x27;s first station. Indeed, for its first decade-and-a-half on the air as a commercial station, it was the only station that provided a clear picture to most of the market; its competitors were initially on the UHF band before the FCC dropped in additional VHF allocations in the late 1950s. It also benefited from its relationship with WGY radio, which was a sister station from 1942 to 1983; the two stations were able to cover the Capital District like no one else could.

Its newscasts were anchored for over 40 years by the venerable Ernie Tetrault (who was immortalized in the 1992 film &quot;Sneakers&quot; directed by one-time WRGB intern Phil Alden Robinson).

Liz Bishop is the station&#x27;s longest tenured personality. She joined WRGB as a weekend sportscaster in 1975, and became Tetrault&#x27;s last anchor desk partner in 1982. She is still the station&#x27;s main female anchor. After Tetrault&#x27;s retirement in 1993, the station was quickly eclipsed by WNYT and for several years in the mid-1990s fell to third place, mirroring a nationwide trend that saw CBS&#x27; ratings drop in the wake of losing rights to the National Football League while NBC was buoyed by blockbuster shows like &quot;Seinfeld&quot; and &quot;ER&quot;, along with NBA, NFL and Olympics coverage. For the most part, the station has stabilized at a steady second place although for a period in the early-2000s it fell back to third. In recent years, the Capital District has seen a spirited three-way battle for news leadership, with WRGB, WTEN, and WNYT regularly trading the number-one spot.

From April 2003 until mid-2004, WNYA aired replays of WRGB&#x27;s weekday noon show at 1, weeknight 11 o&#x27;clock news at 11:35, and WRGB&#x27;s former public affairs program &quot;Sunday Morning with Liz Bishop&quot;. On April 17, 2006, it was announced that WNYA would begin airing an hour long extension of WRGB&#x27;s weekday morning newscast at 7 known (at the time) as &quot;CBS 6 First News on UPN Capital Region&quot;. This could be seen as a pre-emptive move by WRGB to fend off a challenge by WXXA who had announced their plans to launch weekday morning news two weeks earlier. At the start of 2007, the news on WNYA moved to WCWN (because that station had higher ratings overall) becoming &quot;CBS 6 First News on The Capital Region&#x27;s CW&quot;.

In 2007 and 2008, WCWN aired WRGB&#x27;s 11 p.m. news during CBS&#x27; coverage of NCAA March Madness. On January 13, 2008, WRGB began producing its newscasts in high definition, becoming the first in the market to do so. This was exactly 80 years to the date after its first experimental broadcasts. The WCWN broadcast was upgraded the next day. After becoming a sister station, it was rumored that WCWN would add a WRGB-produced 10 p.m. broadcast to challenge WXXA&#x27;s long time dominance at that hour. This became a reality on September 24 when WRGB launched a weeknight 10-minute block in high definition featuring the top stories of the day along with an updated weather forecast. Accordingly, it was known as &quot;The CBS 6 News 10 at 10&quot;. On October 18, 2010, this was expanded to thirty minutes and renamed &quot;The CW 15 News at 10&quot;.

In addition to its main studios, WRGB operates an Albany bureau at One Commerce Plaza in downtown Albany.

=== Weather coverage ===
As with its heritage of being the first station in the Capital Region, WRGB has also had several firsts in the weather field, given the unpredictable weather of the Northeast. In February 1996, it became the first Capital District station to put forecasts on the World Wide Web with the launch of a website. A severe weather outbreak in late May 1998 led to further developments in the station&#x27;s weather coverage. WRGB won an Emmy Award for Chief Meteorologist Steve Lapointe&#x27;s near-nonstop work over two days which made sure there were no fatalities in the otherwise devastating weather.

In May 1999, the station started &quot;WeatherNet 6&quot; which allows viewers to submit weather observations around the area. The public is allowed to report anything from current conditions to snowfall totals. In 2000, the station became the first in the market to offer a station-owned weather radar known as &quot;Instant Doppler 6&quot; that was installed next to their studios. This exclusive distinction was held until 2004 when WNYT set up its own live radar. In recent times, WTEN and WXXA have also updated their radar outputs to so-called &quot;live&quot; capabilities. They do not own their own radars but decided to re-brand the live NOAA National Weather Service NEXRAD Level II radar data as their own. Data is used from four regional sites in Albany, Binghamton, Montague, and Upton. This government data is also used on WRGB known as &quot;WeatherScan Radar&quot;.

WRGB was the last in the market to bring a degree-holding meteorologist onto its staff with the purchase of the station by Freedom, not doing so until several years after WTEN and WNYT did. On January 6, 2009, veteran meteorologist Neal Estano returned to the area airwaves for his third tour of duty with WRGB. He had worked for the station twice before leaving to pursue new opportunities in Jacksonville, Florida and Baltimore, Maryland. Estano left the station on April 25, 2012, taking on a new career in real estate with Keller Williams Realty. Estano has since reappeared on Capital Region airwaves, starting at WNYT in the summer of 2013 on weekend evenings.

=== Notable former on-air staff ===
* Dr. Alan Chartock
* Tony Guida
* Dr. Tim Johnson
* Joe Pagliarulo – main anchor
* Howard Reig – announcer for WGY radio and WRGB from 1943 to 1952
* Joe Tessitore – sports anchor

==Technical information==

===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WRGB shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 6, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 39 to VHF channel 6. During the 2019 digital television repack, WRGB continued to broadcast on VHF channel 6, though due to long-time complications with low-band VHF channels, the station was simulcast in a 720p form on WCWN-DT3 to provide UHF antenna access to over-the-air viewers. In early 2022, WRGB itself relocated to UHF channel 35, and the WCWN simulcast was converted to one in ATSC 3.0, as the station serves as the market&#x27;s lighthouse station, carrying all the major stations except for WNYT in the format.

<text>The Honda B20A engine series, known as the B20A and B21A, was an inline four-cylinder engine family from Honda introduced in 1985 in the second-generation Honda Prelude. Also available in the contemporary third-generation Honda Accord in the Japanese domestic market, along with the Accord-derived Vigor, the B20A was Honda&#x27;s second line of multivalve DOHC inline four-cylinder engines behind the &quot;ZC&quot; twin-cam variant of the ordinarily SOHC D-series, focused towards performance and displacing 2.0 to 2.1 litres.

The third-generation Prelude was exclusively powered by the B20A engine family and production of the B20A engine family ended with the conclusion of the production of the third-generation Prelude in 1991.

==History==
The B20A would be succeeded by the Honda B engine family. Although sharing similar nomenclature and some design elements, the earlier B20A substantially differs from the later B-series in architecture enough to be considered two different engine families and is also not to be confused with the B20B, a 2.0 liter DOHC engine introduced alongside the Honda CR-V in 1994.

There were two versions of the B20A:
* The first generation of B20A engines was available in the 83–87 Prelude 2.0SI in Japan and in Europe, the 86–89 Honda Vigor and Accord. It leaned towards the front of the car just like the A20A engine found in the same cars. This B20A produces and torque in Japan. In Europe this is called B20A1, producing and 127 lb.ft (172 Nm).
** There was also a similar engine named B18A for the 86–89 Accords. It was a de-stroked B20A powered by two-sidedraft Keihin carbs.
* The second generation of B20A was found in the 87–91 Prelude. The 87–91 Prelude B20A and B21A blocks are cast so they lie at an 18-degree angle leaning towards the firewall. This was done to please the exterior specifications for the 1988–1991 3rd Generation Prelude due to its ultra-low hood line which Honda dubs the &quot;engineless design&quot; and also for handling reasons; placing the engine at an angle gives it a lower center of gravity (similar to straight 6 designs in older BMW&#x27;s).

All B20A engines consisted of closed-deck aluminium blocks with thicker-than-average iron sleeves whereas the B21A1 had FRM (fiber reinforced metal) cylinder liners.

The B21A1 was basically a re-worked B20A5 with an increase in bore to . The external block dimensions had to stay identical (although there was increased external strengthening and webbing on the B21) to the B20A5 block so Honda called upon Saffil to create a thin but strong cylinder liner using FRM (fiber reinforced metal) which consisted of a carbon fiber matrix, aluminium alloy, and aluminium oxide to make a very strong cylinder sleeve. The sleeve is so strong, in fact, that it wears out the piston rings, causing low compression numbers, severe smoking, and high oil usage. It is possible in many situations to merely replace the worn rings in order to revive the motor&#x27;s former output. Many machine shops will not attempt to re-hone or re-bore the FRM sleeves, as this type of sleeve will de-laminate during machining operations.

<text>Vizzola Ticino is a village and &quot;comune&quot; of the province of Varese in Lombardy, Italy. It is on the banks of the Ticino River, immediately to the west of Strada Provinciale 52 on the western perimeter of Malpensa Airport.

In the late 19th century, the town was the site of one of the largest electrical generating facilities in Europe, powered by a canal run from the Ticino. The Caproni aircraft company had a manufacturing facility here and the Gianni Caproni Museum of Aeronautics was situated here from the 1960s to the 1980s.

<text>The F20C and F22C1 were inline-4 engines produced by Honda for use in the Honda S2000. They are one of the few Honda 4-cylinder automobile engines that are designed to sit longitudinally for rear wheel drive.

These engines are a distant relative to the F-series engines found in the mid-1990s Honda Accord and Prelude. To get most out of the compact-sized engine, Honda engineers utilized technology derived from Honda&#x27;s racing engines. The F20C and F22C1 have two overhead cams with roller followers, a ladder-frame main bearing stiffener, a VTEC system for both the intake and exhaust camshaft, Fiber-Reinforced Metal cylinder liners (FRM), Forged aluminum molybdenum disulfide-coated piston skirts for reduced friction, and uses a timing chain.

The VTEC system consists of two separate cam lobe profiles. Variable cam phasing is not used. Roller followers are used to reduce friction in the valvetrain. The rocker arms are constructed using metal injection molding.

The engine block is constructed of aluminum with a fiber-reinforced metal sleeve. A timing chain drives an intermediate gear, which drives the cams. The pistons are forged aluminum. The intake plenum was designed with minimal volume for fast engine response, and a flywheel was fitted until 2004. A high-flow catalyst is supplied along with an exhaust air-injection system, which greatly decreases catalyst light-off time and cold emissions.

==F20C==
*Rod Length: 153 mm (approximately 6.024 in)
*Rod/stroke ratio: approximately 1.8214:1
*Power:
**JDM at 8,600 rpm &amp; at 7,500 rpm
**USDM at 8,300 rpm; at 7,500 rpm
*Rev limit: 9,000 rpm
*VTEC actuates between 5,500-6,000 rpm depending on ECU triggers.

The F20C was designed with high engine speed capability in mind, for increased power output; the rev limit is 9,000 rpm, with VTEC engagement at 6,000 rpm. Its relatively long stroke of 84 mm results in a mean piston speed of 4,965 ft/m, or 25.2 m/s, which was higher than any other production car to date. Power output is at 8,300 rpm in North America and Europe. The Japanese version, which has a higher compression ratio, is capable of at 8,600 rpm. Honda&#x27;s F20C Engine won a spot on Wards&#x27; &quot;10 Best Engines List&quot; twice, in 2000 and 2001.

The engine displaces , lending to the Honda S2000&#x27;s name. This method of naming follows suit with the rest of the Honda S roadsters (i.e. Honda S500, S600, and S800).

Applications:
* 1999-2005 Honda S2000 (Japan)
* 2000-2003 Honda S2000 (North America)
* 1999–2009 Honda S2000 (United Kingdom, Europe, Australia)
*2009 IFR Aspid
*2009 Skelta G-Force

The F20C produces the highest specific power output for any naturally aspirated piston engine in a car priced under US$100,000, at per liter, ahead of the SR16VE N1 found in the homologation version of the JDM Nissan Pulsar producing for a specific power of per liter. Honda&#x27;s F20C engine held the record for producing the highest specific power output for any mass production naturally aspirated piston engine in a car, at 123.5 HP/L, until Ferrari began production of the 458 Italia in 2010, which produced 124.5 HP/L.

Although designed at the end of the previous century, the F20C is still one of the highest output per liter and the highest revving mass production engines ever made. In recognition of its incredible power output, the Honda S2000&#x27;s engine has won the International Engine of the Year category for 1.8 to 2.2-liter engines five times in its lifetime (from 2000 to 2004).

==F22C1==
*Rod Length: 149.65 mm (approximately 5.892 in)
*Rod/stroke ratio: approximately 1.6499:1
*Power:
**USDM at 7,800 rpm; at 6,500 rpm (revised to at 7,800 rpm in 2005 per SAE Certified Power standard)
*Rev limit: 8,200 rpm
*VTEC: &quot;6,000 rpm&quot;

In 2004, Honda produced a stroked version of the F20C, increasing displacement by to . Dubbed the F22C1, it was originally designed for the North American market being introduced for the 2004 model year. Maximum power output was maintained at at 7,800 rpm. Rated torque increased from at 7,500 rpm for the F20C to at 6,500 rpm for the F22C. The redline was reduced from 8,900 rpm to 8,200 rpm, mandated by the longer travel distance of the pistons. Peak horsepower output was originally rated identical to the F20C, with &quot;overall powerband characteristics strengthened 4% to 10% between 1,000 -8,000 rpm&quot;.

The F22C1 was used exclusively in the North American market for 2004 and 2005 with the F20C being used in all other markets. In 2006, the engine fully replaced F20C engines in the Japanese market as well which resulted in a drop in rated power output from to . Outside Japan and the United States, the F20C continued to be the only available engine.

Applications:

* 2006–2009 Honda S2000 (Japan)

<doc id="1312455" wikidata="Q745631" url="?curid=1312455" title="Polyorchidism">
<text>Polyorchidism is the incidence of more than two testicles. It is a very rare congenital disorder, with fewer than 200 cases reported in medical literature and six cases (two horses, two dogs and two cats) in veterinary literature.

Polyorchidism is generally diagnosed via an ultrasound examination of the testicles. However, the diagnosis of polyorchidism should include histological confirmation. The most common form is triorchidism, or tritestes, where three testicles are present. The condition is usually asymptomatic. A man who has polyorchidism is known as a polyorchid.

== Classification ==

Polyorchidism occurs in two primary forms: Type A and Type B.
* Type A: The supernumerary testicle is connected to a vas deferens. These testicles are usually reproductively functional. Type A is further subdivided into:
** Type A1: Complete duplication of the testicle, epididymis and vas deferens.
** Type A2: The supernumerary testicle has its own epididymis and shares a vas deferens.
** Type A3: The supernumerary testicle shares the epididymis and the vas deferens of the other testicles.
* Type B: The supernumerary testicle is not connected to a vas deferens and is therefore not reproductively functional. Type B is further subdivided into:
** Type B1: The supernumerary testicle has its own epididymis but is not connected to a vas deferens
** Type B2: The supernumerary testicle consists only of testicular tissue.

Type A3 is the most common form of polyorchidism, and types A2 and A3 together account for more than 90% of cases. In 65% of cases, the supernumerary testicle is found in the left scrotal sac.

=== Numeric system ===

An older system of classification structures polyorchidism into similar types, but with no subdivision between connected and disconnected testicles:
* Type 1: The testicle lacks an epididymis and vas deferens and has no connection to the other testicles.
* Type 2: The supernumerary testicle shares the epididymis and the vas deferens of the other testicles.
* Type 3: The supernumerary testicle has its own epididymis and shares a vas deferens.
* Type 4: Complete duplication of the testicle, epididymis and vas deferens.

==Cause==
===Complications===
Most cases of polyorchidism are asymptomatic, and are discovered incidentally, in the course of treating another condition. In the majority of cases, the supernumerary testicle is found in the scrotum.

However, polyorchidism can occur in conjunction with cryptorchidism, where the supernumerary testicle is undescended or found elsewhere in the body. These cases are associated with a significant increase in the incidence of testicular cancer: 0.004% for the general population vs 5.7% for a supernumerary testicle not found in the scrotum.

Polyorchidism can also occur in conjunction with infertility, inguinal hernia, testicular torsion, epididymitis, hydrocele testis and varicocele. However, it is not clear whether polyorchidism causes or aggravates these conditions, or whether the existence of these conditions leads sufferers to seek medical attention and thus become diagnosed with a previously undetected supernumerary testicle.

==Management==
Because polyorchidism is very uncommon, there is no standard treatment for the condition. Prior to advances in ultrasound technology, it was common practice to remove the supernumerary testicle. Several cases have been described where routine follow-up examinations conducted over a period of years showed that the supernumerary testicle was stable.

A meta-analysis in 2009 suggested removing non-scrotal supernumerary testicles because of the increased risk of cancer, and regular follow-up in the remaining cases to ensure that the supernumerary testicle remains stable.

<doc id="1312457" wikidata="Q4794476" url="?curid=1312457" title="Arnaud Baille/Sicre">
<text>Arnaud Baille/Sicre was a cobbler in the Comté de Foix in the late thirteenth and early fourteenth century. A number of details about his life are known to us through the Fournier Register, and Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie&#x27;s analysis of those records.

Raised in Ax-les-Thermes he was the son of Arnaud Sicre, a notary, and Sybille Baille. His father was a Catholic and worked as a writer for the Church. His mother, however, was a firm Cathar. The marriage did not last, and Sybille forced her husband out of the house. Sybille readopted her maiden name, while Arnaud Jr. and his brother Bernard, would alternate between surnames, sometimes using both. At the age of seven Arnaud was sent to live with his father in Tarascon-sur-Ariège so that he could be educated.

His mother&#x27;s heresy was uncovered by the Inquisition. Sybille was arrested, and was eventually burned at the stake after relapsing into Catharism. The family&#x27;s property was confiscated. This left Arnaud embittered, as his mother&#x27;s heresy had cost him his inheritance. He became an itinerant cobbler.

In an attempt to win back the family home, Arnaud decided on becoming an informer for the Inquisition. He was sent to Catalonia where a number of Cathar exiles were in hiding. Arnaud joined this group and eventually convinced a number of them to return to the Comté to attend his sister&#x27;s wedding. Forces of the Inquisition were waiting and a number of the heretics were captured, including their leader Guillaume Bélibaste and the shepherd Pierre Maury.

<text>Vogtland (; ) is a region spanning the German states of Bavaria, Saxony and Thuringia and north-western Bohemia in the Czech Republic. It overlaps with and is largely contained within Euroregio Egrensis. The name alludes to the former leadership by the Vögte (&quot;advocates&quot; or &quot;lords protector&quot;) of Weida, Gera and Plauen.

== Geography ==

=== Natural geography ===
The landscape of the Vogtland is sometimes described as idyllic, thanks to its fields, meadows and wooded hilltops. In the south and southeast, Vogtland rises to a low or mid-height mountain range also called &quot;Oberes Vogtland&quot;, or Upper Vogtland. Here, monocultural coniferous forest is the predominant form of vegetation. The Vogtland&#x27;s highest mountain is Schneehübel, reaching 974 metres; another remarkable landmark is the Schneckenstein, 883 m above sea level, which gained some renown for its (falsely) alleged unique abundance of topaz crystals. Its mountains spread from Ore Mountains in the south-east to Fichtel Mountains in the south-west, including the Elster Mountains.

Neighbouring regions are Franconian Forest, Ore Mountains, Thuringian Highland and Fichtel Mountains. The south-eastern part of the Vogtland belongs to &quot;Ore Mountain/Vogtland Nature Park&quot;, a protected area comparable to a national park.

In its northern part, which averages around 250 m above sea level, the landscape is marked by several river valleys, as the White Elster, the Zwickauer Mulde and the Göltzsch have their spring in the Vogtland, while the Saale flows through Bavaria and Thuringia in the west of Vogtland.

=== Cultural geography ===

The river valley geography in Vogtland&#x27;s north made it necessary to build comparatively big bridges to channel railroad and automobile traffic streams. Particularly famous are the &quot;Göltzsch Viaduct&quot; between Reichenbach im Vogtland and Netzschkau, the world&#x27;s largest bridge built of bricks, and her &quot;little sister&quot;, the &quot;Elster Viaduct&quot;. Both of them are in use as railroad bridges closing the gap between Dresden and Nuremberg.

As road bridges are concerned, the major bridges forming part of the A 72 near Hof, Pirk and Weißensand are the most important ones, while one urban bridge poses as a rarity: The Syratal Viaduct is Europe&#x27;s biggest mono-arch bridge made of chunked natural stone - to be found in Plauen, commonly called &quot;Friedensbrücke&quot;.

Integral part of the Vogtland landscape are its reservoirs, the shores of which mostly are popular holiday and camping destinations.

==Notable cities==

Plauen is the largest city and seat of the Vogtlandkreis county and informally known as the &quot;capital of the Vogtland&quot;. 
A university city, Gera is the largest city of the historical Vogtland region, yet, also a link in the Thüringer Städtekette &quot;(Thuringia city chain)&quot; ranging eastwards from Eisenach via Erfurt, Weimar, and Jena to Gera.

Other towns of regional significance are:

===In Saxony===

*Reichenbach im Vogtland, Große Kreisstadt and site of the Vogtland&#x27;s landmark, the Göltzsch viaduct, the largest brick bridge made of bricks, spanning from Reichenbach to the adjacent town of Netzschkau.
*Auerbach/Vogtl., Große Kreisstadt
*Oelsnitz im Vogtland, Große Kreisstadt
*Klingenthal, Große Kreisstadt

===In Thuringia===

*Greiz, former capital of the Principality of Reuss-Greiz, the smallest principality of the former Holy Roman Empire
*Weida, ancestral seat of the first Vogts and thus often referred to as the cradle of the Vogtland.

===In Bavaria===

*Hof, university city and capital of the Hof county.

===In the Czech Republic===

*Cheb, capital of the Cheb District as well as seat of the University of West Bohemia Faculty of Economics

== History ==
The larger settlemental region surrounding Gera has been recorded in documents as early as the year 1000. It is thought to have been inhabited since late 7th or early 8th century by Slavic Settlers who tribally belonged to the Sorbs. Large portions of the Vogtland, however, were still covered with pristine forests and were not settled before the High Middle Ages, especially until the period called the . Those settlers arrived mainly in eleventh and twelfth centuries, ethnically being Slavic or German, coming from like Franconia, Thuringia and Saxony. Even today this can be traced along lines dividing dialectal areas, providing linguistic differences at close distances of settlement while demonstrating peculiar commonalities with varieties spoken in more distant regions of Germany. For instance, in a number of villages of the upper Vogtland even nowadays a dialect is spoken similar to that in (/ou/ sounds instead of /u:/ as in &quot;Kou&quot; (en. &quot;cow&quot;) etc.).


The place name Vogtland (formerly also known as &quot;Voigtland&quot;, ) originates in the rule of the Vogts in this region from the eleventh to the sixteenth century AD, specifically in reference to the Vogts of Weida, Gera and Plauen. In the 12th century, Emperor Barbarossa appointed the first Vogts as administrators of his imperial forest areas in the east to facilitate his rule. Their headquarters was the Osterburg at Weida, thus giving it the reputation as the cradle of the Vogtland. Among the privileges of the Vogts were the endowment over minerals still unextracted from the ground () and the entitlement to regulating mint and coinage affairs (), which were both handed down to them by Kaiser Frederick II in 1232.

As in the 14th century claims to power by the Margraves of Meissen emerged, Henry of Plauen submitted to the tenure-based regnancy of the Bohemian Crown, excepting only the dominion of Voigtsberg, that stayed tenured to the Reich. In 1349, his equinomic son Henry also handed Voigtsberg over to Bohemian tenure; thus the whole Vogtland had become a (a specific status of tenure). In 1357 an exchange of territories was agreed with by the Margraviate of Meissen, effectually making Wiedersberg, Liebau, Adorf, Pausa, Neuenkirchen and Hirschberg (among others) Meissenian while Borna, Geithein and Kohren were handed to the Vogt. The exchange was heavily disputed by branch line cousins of Henry&#x27;s. The Lords of Plauen, as they called themselves, retrieved Auerbach, Pausa and Liebau as Meissenian tenure in 1379. Since 1426 the Lords of Plauen were Burggraves of Meissen and found themselves in constant power struggles with the Saxon Prince Electors.

Bohemian King George of Podiebrad took the burning of the royal castle of Graslitz due to fights between Henry II of Plauen and his enemies to be an occasion to withdraw his tenure and have the Vogtland occupied by Ernest in 1466. Henry II von Plauen had fallen into disgrace with him for his open opposition against nobility. Thus, Ernest received tenure over the Vogtland which, at the occasion of the Leipziger Teilung in 1485, was transferred to the House of Ernest while keeping the under joint control. In 1547, after the Battle of Mühlberg, the Ernestines forfeited the tenure over the Vogtland and Kaiser Ferdinand I handed it down to his Chancellor Henry IV of Plauen, making Maurice, Elector of Saxony co-tenant to the Vogtland tenure. Henry V and Henry VI could not settle up their debts towards Augustus, Elector of Saxony. Due to arrears in Tithe and other liabilities the brothers pawned the Vogtland to the Electorate of Saxony in 1559.

With Heinrich VI the rule of the Vogts of Plauen over the Vogtland ended, as he could not redeem the pawn any more. In 1566, Augustus acquired the office and towns of Voigtsberg, Oelsnitz, Plauen and Pausa. Matters were further resettled in 1657, among other transactions assigning office over Plauen, Voigtsberg and Pausa to Saxe-Zeitz (a secundogeniture of Electoral Saxony) while and the town of Schöneck remained in the possession of the Electorate. In 1718, after the extinction of the Saxe-Zeitz line, the areas in concern reverted to the Electorate. Apart from the Saxon share, the forests around Auerbach and Schöneck remained an exceptional area being both electoral and ducal at the same time.

== Transportation and infrastructure ==

Two major motorways (A 72 and A 9) serve the Vogtland with connection to the surrounding regions and cities. Providing connections locally within the region and beyond state and national borders, Vogtlandbahn is a private railway company which operates the Vogtland Express. Vogtlandbahn services includes direct connections to Leipzig, Regensburg and Berlin independently from Deutsche Bahn and cooperates with Bohemian (Czech) railway company Viamont as well as with Bavaria-based Alex train services to provide further connections to Munich, Prague and further destinations of note in Euregio Egrensis and beyond. There is a bus service that runs from Vogtland to Berlin.

While the European Union develops into a Europe of Regions, Vogtland could experience an increase of significance for transiting traffic and tourism for the region of Euregio Egrensis, independently from the political meaning of Vogtlandkreis.

<text>Andrew John Ward (born 28 September 1952) is an English progressive rock drummer.

==Early life==
Born in Epsom, England, Ward attended the City of London Freemen&#x27;s School. He began drumming at the age of 13 in a local rock band with Jim Butt (guitar), Doug Houston (vocals), Colin Burgess (bass) and Jan (Murray) Obodynski (keyboards).

==Career==
===Camel (1971–1981)===
Ward became a founding member of the progressive rock band Camel, who formed in 1971, evolving from Ward&#x27;s first band, The Brew. One of the leading lights of the English progressive rock movement, Camel enjoyed considerable success worldwide, peaking in 1975 when they performed their album &quot;The Snow Goose&quot; at the Royal Albert Hall, accompanied by the London Symphony Orchestra. Following a period of ill health – including problems caused by alcohol and drugs – in 1981 he was forced to retire from the band. With Ward&#x27;s departure, Andrew Latimer became the only original member who remained in the band.

===Marillion (1983)===
Two years later, he resurfaced briefly with the neo-progressive rock band Marillion, appearing in the video of the hit single &quot;Garden Party&quot; from their debut album &quot;Script for a Jester&#x27;s Tear&quot; and performing with them for three months as a replacement for their original drummer, Mick Pointer, who had recently been sacked. Ward&#x27;s performances with the band included an appearance on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;The Old Grey Whistle Test&quot; when they performed &quot;Forgotten Sons&quot;. According to Mark Kelly, Ward had been recruited to the band without a proper audition because of his reputation. However, as both Kelly and Fish have recalled, his personal problems had resurfaced and he succumbed to a nervous breakdown midway through the band&#x27;s first American tour.

===Canterbury (1987–2002)===
Throughout the 1990s, Ward worked with Richard Sinclair&#x27;s Caravan of Dreams and Going Going, with Sinclair, Hugh Hopper, Vince Clarke and Mark Hewins. In 1994, he joined Mirage – a progressive &quot;supergroup&quot; combining members from both Camel and Caravan. Other projects included the studio-only group the Chrysanthemums, led by singer-songwriter Yukio Yung (aka Terry Burrows), who received drum tracks through the post from Ward before building songs around them, playing all the other instruments himself. At this time Ward also became full-time drummer with the English rock band the Bevis Frond, with whom he recorded and toured extensively.

===Present===
In 2002, a compilation CD, &quot;Sticking Around&quot;, was released. This compilation highlights his work with Camel and other projects.

In 2003, Ward participated in a short lived reformation of the original members of The Brew (with Latimer and Ferguson) and recorded material for an album that never materialized, largely due to Latimer&#x27;s ongoing health issues.

<doc id="1312471" wikidata="Q827328" url="?curid=1312471" title="Paint.NET">
<text>[[Paint.NET]] (sometimes stylized as paint.net) is a freeware general-purpose raster graphics editor program for Microsoft Windows, developed with the .NET platform. Paint.NET was originally created by Rick Brewster as a Washington State University student project, and has evolved from a simple replacement for the Microsoft Paint program into a program for editing mainly graphics, with support for plugins.

==History==
Paint.NET originated as a computer science senior design project during spring 2004 at Washington State University. Version 1.0 consisted of 36,000 lines of code and was written in fifteen weeks. In contrast, version 3.35 has approximately 162,000 lines of code. The Paint.NET project continued over the summer and into the autumn 2004 semester for both the version 1.1 and 2.0 releases.

Development continued with one programmer who worked on previous versions of Paint.NET while he was a student at WSU. As of May 2006 the program had been downloaded at least 2 million times, at a rate of about 180,000 per month.

Initially, Paint.NET was released under a modified version of the MIT License, with the exclusion of the installer, text, and graphics. However, citing issues with the open source code being plagiarized by others that had rebranded the software as their own and bundled user content without their permission, the availability of the source code was restricted, in December 2007 Brewster announced his intent to restrict access to components of the program (including its installer, resources, and user interface). In November 2009, the software was made proprietary, restricting the sale or creation of derivative works of the software.

Starting with version 4.0.18, Paint.NET is published in two editions: A classic edition remains freeware, similar to all other versions since 3.5. Another edition, however, is published to Microsoft Store under a trialware license and is available to purchase for US$7. According to the developer, this was done to enable the users to contribute to the development with more convenience, even though the old avenue of donation was not closed.

==Overview==
Paint.NET is primarily programmed in the C# programming language. Its native image format, .PDN, is a compressed representation of the application&#x27;s internal object format, which preserves layering and other information.

==Plugins==
Paint.NET supports plugins, which add image adjustments, effects, and support for additional file types. They can be programmed using any .NET Framework programming language, though they are most commonly written in C#. These are created by volunteer coders on the program&#x27;s discussion board, the Paint.NET Forum. Though most are simply published via the discussion board, some have been included with a later release of the program. For instance, a DirectDraw Surface file type plugin, (originally by Dean Ashton) and an Ink Sketch and Soften Portrait effect (originally by David Issel) were added to Paint.NET in version 3.10.

Hundreds of plugins have been produced; such as Shape3D, which renders a 2D drawing into a 3D shape. Some plugins expand on the functionality that comes with Paint.NET, such as Curves+ and Sharpen+, which extend the included tools Curves and Sharpen, respectively.

Examples of file type plugins include an &quot;Animated Cursor and Icon&quot; plugin and an &quot;Adobe Photoshop file format plugin&quot;. Several of these plugins are based on existing open source software, such as a raw image format plugin that uses dcraw and a PNG optimization plugin that uses OptiPNG.

==Forks==

===paint-mono===
Paint.NET was created for Windows, and has no native support for any other system. With its previous open-source nature, the possibility for alternate versions was available. In May 2007, Miguel de Icaza officially started a porting project called &quot;paint-mono&quot;. This project had partially ported Paint.NET 3.0 to Mono, an open-source implementation of the Common Language Infrastructure on which the .NET Framework is based. This allowed Paint.NET to be run on Mono-supported platforms, such as Linux. This port is no longer maintained and has not been updated since March 2009.

Newer Mono runtime 6 versions are able to run original Paint.NET releases up to 3.5.11 almost perfectly.

===Pinta===

In 2010, developer Jonathan Pobst started a project called Pinta, describing it as a clone of Paint.NET for Mono and Gtk#. Pinta reused the adjustments and effects code from Paint.NET but otherwise is original code.

<text>Charlie Brown Jr. was a Brazilian rock band from Santos, São Paulo. The group was popular with disadvantaged youth because of their relatable commentary about social issues and the frequent use of skate punk and hip hop slang in their songs. The band won two Latin Grammy Awards and was one of the most-popular Brazilian bands of the late 1990s to mid-2000s.

Vocalist Chorão&#x27;s drug addiction and disagreements with other musicians frequently overshadowed the band. Chorão was the only founding member to remain through several line-up changes. After Chorão died of a cocaine overdose on March 6, 2013, the band disbanded.

In 2015, the streaming platform Deezer reported that Charlie Brown Jr. was the second most-listened-to Brazilian band outside Brazil. In a Spotify survey also from 2015, the band placed 31st out of the 47 most-popular bands and artists.

== History ==

=== Early years ===
Chorão formed the band What&#x27;s Up, shortly after his move from São Paulo to Santos, in 1987. After a line-up change in 1990, twelve-year-old bassist Champignon joined the band, followed by Marcão, Renato Pelado, and Thiago Castanho. In 1992, Chorão revamped What&#x27;s Up with a new name. He chose Charlie Brown Jr., explaining that Charlie Brown came from when he crashed his car into a coconut stand with a drawing of Charles M. Schulz&#x27;s comic strip &quot;Peanuts&quot; on it. The &quot;Jr.&quot; alluded to the fact that he considered himself and the band &quot;the children of rock&quot;.

What&#x27;s Up and Charlie Brown Jr. developed a heavy style influenced by crossover thrash and hardcore punk, with lyrics in English. Some of Chorão&#x27;s greatest inspirations were Blink-182, Sublime, Bad Brains, NOFX, Suicidal Tendencies, Biohazard, Faith No More, and 311. The band initially struggled because most members had to rent or borrow their instruments, often forcing the band to cancel performances. Champignon, who was underage, needed a permit signed by his parents to perform at shows.

In 1995, they recorded their first demo tape, the self-titled &quot;Charlie Brown Jr.&quot; To finance the recording, Champignon pawned one of his bass guitars, and Chorão pawned a television set. The underground scene of Santos responded positively to the demo, motivating Champignon to show it to his friend, record producer Tadeu Patolla. Patolla was impressed but advised Chorão to sing in Portuguese and experiment with other genres, such as hip hop, reggae, and ska, taking Red Hot Chili Peppers and Rage Against the Machine as inspiration. Subsequently, Patolla introduced the group to fellow producer Rick Bonadio, and they helped the band secure a contract with Virgin Records. Virgin released the band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Transpiração Contínua Prolongada&quot;, in 1997.

In early 1999, the band released a promotional extended play entitled &quot;Aquele Luxo!&quot; as a teaser for a forthcoming album. &quot;Preço Curto... Prazo Longo&quot; came out on March 6, 1999, and was the band&#x27;s longest album, with 25 tracks. Chorão later said it was recorded out of necessity because the band did not have much of an original repertoire for their live shows. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Zóio de Lula&quot;, was released on April 1, 1999. It was the band&#x27;s first song to reach first place on Brazilian radio. The band made a music video for the single, featuring a then-19-year-old Luize Altenhofen.

=== 2000s ===
&quot;Nadando com os Tubarões&quot;, Charlie Brown Jr.&#x27;s third album, was released in November 2000. It included guest appearances by the rap group RZO (fronted by Sabotage at the time) and up-and-coming singer Negra Li, who co-wrote the album&#x27;s biggest hit, &quot;Não É Sério&quot;. &quot;Nadando com os Tubarões&quot; was nominated for a Latin Grammy Award for Best Portuguese Language Rock or Alternative Album in 2001. Shortly after the album&#x27;s release, guitarist Thiago Castanho left Charlie Brown Jr., citing his dissatisfaction with their extensive touring schedule.

The band&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Abalando a Sua Fábrica&quot;, came out on November 01, 2001, under their new label EMI. It was their first recording as a quartet and the band shifted away from their rap rock-inflected sonority, toward a &quot;rawer&quot; style influenced by punk and garage rock. The band achieved this sound by recording all instrumental parts simultaneously as if they were recording live.

In 2002, Charlie Brown Jr. released their first DVD, &quot;Charlie Brown Jr. ao Vivo&quot;, recorded live at a concert at the DirecTV Music Hall in São Paulo. Later, this show was broadcast by direct broadcast satellite service provider DirecTV. That year, the band toured internationally, with a leg in Portugal. After a Portuguese newspaper critic called them &quot;bocas ordinárias&quot;, a Portuguese expression for a &quot;foul-mouthed&quot; person, Chorão decided to use this as the name of their next album. &quot;Bocas Ordinárias&quot; was considered one of the band&#x27;s best albums by fans and critics alike, earning a nomination for the Latin Grammy Award in 2003. Chorão dedicated the album to singer Cássia Eller, a friend who died the year prior.

In 2003, Charlie Brown Jr. filmed an episode of &quot;Acústico MTV&quot;, the Brazilian equivalent of &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot;. Their critically acclaimed performance featured guest appearances by Marcelo D2, Marcelo Nova, RZO, and Negra Li. &quot;Acústico MTV: Charlie Brown Jr.&quot; was released on CD and DVD formats on September 20, 2003.

Their sixth studio album, &quot;Tamo Aí na Atividade&quot;, came out in December 2004 and won the Latin Grammy Award in 2005. However, its recording sessions were plagued by creative differences and clashes between Chorão and his bandmates. By early 2005, Champignon, Marcão, and Renato Pelado left the group. Chorão announced that Charlie Brown Jr. was on hiatus for an indeterminate time, leading many to speculate that the band was splitting up.

Charlie Brown Jr. returned from their hiatus with a new line-up: bassist Heitor Gomes, drummer/beatboxer Pinguim Ruas, and original founding member Thiago Castanho on guitar. Their album, &quot;Imunidade Musical&quot;, featured a guest appearance by rapper Rappin&#x27; Hood. It was nominated for a Latin Grammy Award in 2006. Around the same time, the band released a DVD, &quot;Skate Vibration&quot;, recorded at the inauguration of Chorão&#x27;s Skate Park.

The band released &quot;Ritmo, Ritual e Responsa&quot; in 2007&quot;.&quot; MV Bill, João Gordo, Paranormal Attack, and Forfun were guest musicians on the album. &quot;Ritmo, Ritual e Responsa&quot; was nominated for a Latin Grammy Award in 2008. It was the first part of the soundtrack of the film &quot;O Magnata&quot;, which was written and co-produced by Chorão. The film also included cameos by Chorão and the other Charlie Brown Jr. members. However, &quot;O Magnata&quot; was a moderate box office success, receiving mixed to negative reviews.

The band released a performance DVD to promote the release of &quot;Ritmo, Ritual e Responsa ao Vivo&quot; in 2008. However, Pinguim was not in the band by the time the DVD was released; his contract had expired and both parties were uninterested in renewing it. He was replaced by Bruno Graveto.

=== 2010s ===
&quot;Camisa 10 Joga Bola Até na Chuva&quot; was Charlie Brown Jr.&#x27;s ninth album and won the Latin Grammy Award in 2010. It was their final release with Heitor Gomes, who left in 2011 to join CPM 22. &quot;Só os Loucos Sabem&quot;, a single from this album, became one of the band&#x27;s highest-charting hits. Chorão originally wrote &quot;O Dom, a Inteligência e a Voz&quot;, another track on the album, for Cássia Eller in 2001, but she died before recording the song.

In 2010, the band composed the opening theme for the variety show &quot;Legendários&quot;, hosted by Marcos Mion on RecordTV. In 2011 Chorão announced that Marcão and Champignon were returning to the band. Their first recording under this new line-up, &quot;Música Popular Caiçara&quot;, was released in CD, DVD, and Blu-ray formats. It was recorded in 2011 during performances in Curitiba and Santos. Liminha was its producer and KondZilla was the director. The CD version was released as two volumes: the first concomitantly with the DVD and Blu-ray, and the second four years later, in 2016.

By 2011, Chorão&#x27;s drug abuse issues began to take their toll on his life and health, causing his divorce from his long-time companion, Graziela &quot;Grazon&quot; Gonçalves. He wrote the song &quot;Céu Azul&quot;, included in the band&#x27;s 2012 release &quot;Música Popular Caiçara&quot;, for Gonçalves following their divorce.

In 2012, the band began work on a new studio album, &quot;La Familia 013&quot;. Its first single, &quot;Meu Novo Mundo&quot;, premiered in February 2013. On March 6, Chorão died in his apartment following a cocaine overdose. As a result, the album was left unfinished. After a hiatus, the band resumed work on the unfinished instrumental parts. The band unveiled the album&#x27;s cover art on July 7, 2013. &quot;La Familia 013&quot; was released on October 8, 2013. In 2014, it received the band&#x27;s fifth Latin Grammy Award nomination.

== After Charlie Brown Jr. ==
Following his first departure from Charlie Brown Jr., Champignon formed the band Revolucionnários. After Revolucionnários broke up, he joined the supergroup Nove Mil Anjos, with Junior Lima of Sandy &amp; Junior fame and Pitty guitarist Peu Sousa. Marcão formed the band TH6, while Renato Pelado became a DJ.

Following the death of Chorão, the remaining band members formed A Banca, a tribute act to both Chorão and Charlie Brown Jr. In August, they released the single &quot;O Novo Passo&quot;, which was selected by &quot;Rolling Stone Brasil&quot; as one of the best Brazilian songs of the year. Nevertheless, some Charlie Brown Jr. fans criticized Champignon for &quot;not respecting Chorão&#x27;s death&quot; and &quot;not mourning it properly&quot;, dismissing him as a &quot;cash-grabber&quot;, a &quot;traitor&quot; and a &quot;Judas&quot;. Even though Champignon vehemently denied such claims, the constant criticism eventually led him into depression. On September 9, 2013, he shot himself in the head with a .380 ACP pistol.

Except for Thiago Castanho, the existing members of A Banca later regrouped as Bula and went on to form D&#x27;Chapas.

== Reunions ==
In January 2019, Marcão Britto, Heitor Gomes, and Pinguim Ruas reformed Charlie Brown Jr. for a series of shows held throughout the year, with guest vocalists such as Dinho Ouro Preto of Capital Inicial, Di Ferrero of NX Zero, Digão of Raimundos, and Supla. Although the reunion had the approval of Chorão&#x27;s son Alexandre, it was heavily criticized by Chorão&#x27;s ex-wife Graziela Gonçalves, former guitarist Thiago Castanho, and music critic Mauro Ferreira of G1.

On February 1, 2021, Alexandre announced that the band would reunite once more for the Chorão 50 Tour in Brazil, celebrating what would have been his father&#x27;s 50th birthday. This time, Thiago Castanho returned as the band&#x27;s guitarist. Fronted by former Tihuana vocalist Egypcio, the line-up consisted of all former Charlie Brown Jr. band members except for its first drummer Renato Pelado. On October 25, 2021, Marcão and Castanho departed the tour, citing creative divergences with Alexandre.

== Legacy ==
On April 13, 2014, Chorão&#x27;s son Alexandre organized the Tamo Aí na Atividade Festival in São Bernardo do Campo to celebrate the legacy of Charlie Brown Jr. and the deaths of his father and Champignon. The date coincides with the 22nd anniversary of the band&#x27;s first live performance in 1992. Although a DVD of the festival was initially planned, Alexandre stated that, due to &quot;bureaucratic reasons&quot;, it never came through.

On March 29, 2015, a biographical musical about Chorão, entitled &quot;Dias de Luta, Dias de Glória&quot;, premiered. It was written by Well Rianc and directed by the sibling duo Bruno and Luiz Sorrentino. Rapper DZ6 starred as Chorão. Despite positive critical reception, Chorão&#x27;s brother, Ricardo Abrão, lambasted the musical as being &quot;disrespectful&quot; and &quot;inaccurate&quot;.

In 2017, Alexandre published the book &quot;Eu Estava Lá Também&quot;, a compilation of his father&#x27;s photographs and memoirs, dating from 2005 to 2012. In 2020, Alexandre revealed that, shortly after Chorão&#x27;s death, he had ordered a diamond made of a lock of his father&#x27;s hair. Chorão&#x27;s ex-wife, Graziela Gonçalves, published her memoirs, &quot;Se Não Eu, Quem Vai Fazer Você Feliz?&quot;, in 2018.

In 2017, Universal Music Group re-released the band&#x27;s debut, &quot;Transpiração Contínua Prolongada&quot;, in a special 20th-anniversary deluxe edition. To celebrate what would have been Chorão&#x27;s 49th birthday and the 20th anniversary of the release of Charlie Brown Jr.&#x27;s single &quot;Zóio de Lula&quot; on April 9, 2019, UMG re-issued a special edition containing the song&#x27;s original version and a new cover featuring Marcelo D2, Hungria Hip Hop, Nação Zumbi, and Maneva.

In 2020, the band&#x27;s song &quot;Confisco&quot; was included in the soundtrack of the video game &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 1 + 2&quot;. On March 15, 2021, Chorão&#x27;s son struck a deal with Sony Music to release a compilation of outtakes and other rarities by Charlie Brown Jr. The live album/DVD &quot;Chegou Quem Faltava&quot;, originally recorded during a show in São Paulo in 2011, was released on July 13, 2021.

On April 11, 2023, Universal Music announced a greatest hits compilation to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Chorão&#x27;s death. On July 17, 2023, Universal Music released a deluxe boxset, simply entitled &quot;Charlie Brown Jr.&quot;, containing the band&#x27;s entire studio discography plus the video album &quot;Ritmo, Ritual e Responsa ao Vivo&quot;, which came out in CD format for the first time.

== Films ==
Shortly after Chorão died in 2013, film producers Felipe Elias, Victor Santini Stockler, and Roberta Franco launched a crowdfunding campaign on the website Catarse to finance a documentary, &quot;Marginal Alado&quot;. The campaign raised R$41,513.00, surpassing its original goal of R$35,000.00. Directed by Felipe Novaes, the documentary premiered at festivals across Brazil in 2019. Its theatrical release in 2020 was postponed to April 8, 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In 2017, filmmaker Gabriel Mellin announced he was working on a biopic about Champignon, entitled &quot;Champ&quot;. Mellin wrote its script with Champignon&#x27;s widow, Claudia Bossle. On September 4, 2020, actor José Loreto expressed his desire to portray Chorão in a potential biopic.

<text>Raw Deal is a 1986 American action film directed by John Irvin and written by Gary DeVore &amp; Norman Wexler, from a story by Luciano Vincenzoni &amp; Sergio Donati. The film stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Kathryn Harrold, Darren McGavin and Sam Wanamaker. In the film, Harry Shanon, an elderly FBI agent, recruits Mark Kaminski, an ex-FBI agent, to destroy a mafia organization.

&quot;Raw Deal&quot; was released in North America on June 6, 1986 and grossed $16.2 million in the US against its $8–10 million budget.

==Plot==
A mob informant is under protection by the FBI in a remote wooded cabin, but they are soon ambushed by a hit squad, who brutally slaughter the bodyguards and the informant. One of the agents killed is Blair Shannon, the son of FBI agent Harry Shannon, who vows to exact revenge.

Mark Kaminski, a small-town sheriff, lives with his alcoholic wife Amy, who resents their way of living. Kaminski was also an FBI agent, who had brutally thrashed a suspect for sexually assaulting and murdering a young girl. Kaminski was given an option to &quot;resign or be prosecuted&quot; by Marvin Baxter, an ambitious prosecutor, and Kaminski gets suspended from the FBI. Baxter, the present Special Federal Prosecutor, sets up a committee to investigate the dealings of Luigi Patrovita, the strongest of the Chicago Outfit crime bosses.

Due to a leak within the FBI ranks causing their agents to be killed, Shannon recruits Kaminski for an unsanctioned assignment to infiltrate and dismantle Patrovita&#x27;s organization. Kaminski fakes his own death in a chemical plant explosion and poses as Joseph P. Brenner, a convicted felon. Kaminski manages to get an audience with Patrovita&#x27;s right-hand man Paulo Rocca and convinces them of his worth by harassing Martin Lamanski, a rival mob boss, who is trying to move in the territory of Patrovita. While at Patrovita&#x27;s casino, hidden in a basement level of a high class hotel, Kaminski makes the acquaintance of Monique, who works for Rocca&#x27;s top lieutenant Max Keller.

Kaminski continues to work his way into the good graces of the Patrovita family, including devising a plan that recovers $100 million of heroin and cash seized by the feds from one of Patrovita&#x27;s hideouts and simultaneously assisting in Lamanski&#x27;s assassination. Keller is not convinced that &#x27;Brenner&#x27; is who he says and manages to find proof of the deception, showing Kaminski&#x27;s photo to a police informant who previously arrested the real Brenner. The leak, which the FBI has been looking for, is revealed to be Baxter, who is forced to stay close to Patrovita. Kaminski accompanies Keller to a cemetery for a hit job, but discovers that the target is Shannon, forcing Kaminski to blow his cover and kill Keller. In the ensuing shootout, Shannon is severely wounded and crippled.

Kaminski escapes with Monique&#x27;s assistance and tells her to go to the airport and wait for him. After gathering an arsenal of firearms, Kaminski raids one of Patrovita&#x27;s gravel pits, killing everyone and stealing a large amount of drug money. Kaminski sets off for Patrovita&#x27;s casino, where he embarks on a killing spree, single-handedly wiping out all his soldiers, including the men directly responsible for the murder of Blair and his fellow FBI agents. Rocca and Patrovita retreat to a back room, but Rocca is cut down in a barrage of gunfire. Patrovita flees into an office pleading for his life, but Kaminski mercilessly guns him down. On his way out, Kaminski encounters a whimpering Baxter, who tries to talk his way out by apologizing for the suspension. Kaminski responds to Baxter by saying that because of him a lot of people are dead and now it is his turn and offers him a gun with the same line Baxter told him earlier: &quot;Resign, or be prosecuted. Any way you want it.&quot; When Baxter attempts to shoot him, Kaminski turns and shoots Baxter dead in self-defense.

After driving to the airport, Kaminski hands a duffel bag containing $250,000 in cash to Monique, telling her that she can start a new life with no obligations to anyone. Kaminski is reinstated with the FBI and is reunited with a pregnant Amy. Kaminski visits Shannon, who refuses to undergo physical therapy. In order to thank Shannon for helping him, Kaminski asks him to be his child&#x27;s godfather in exchange for completing his therapy, which Shannon accepts.

==Cast==
== Production ==
Shooting took place in October 1985 in Chicago, Illinois, and Wilmington, North Carolina.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Raw Deal&quot; released in the United States on June 6, 1986, and made $5.4 million in its opening weekend. It went on to gross a total of $16.2 million in the United States. Despite turning a box office profit and becoming a hit, its earnings were still considered a disappointment.

===Critical response===
Roger Ebert gave the film 1.5 stars out of four and wrote, &quot;This plot is so simple (and has been told so many times before), that perhaps the most amazing achievement of &#x27;Raw Deal&#x27; is its ability to screw it up. This movie didn&#x27;t just happen to be a mess; the filmmakers had to work to make it so confusing.&quot; Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the film &quot;isn&#x27;t exactly Oscar material. It does nothing for the cause of nonviolence. It will warm the hearts of gun lobbyists everywhere, and its final body count may be even higher than that in Mr. Stallone&#x27;s &#x27;Cobra.&#x27; Yet &#x27;Raw Deal&#x27; somehow manages to be measurably less offensive. At times, it&#x27;s almost funny — intentionally.&quot; Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; reported, &quot;Comic book crime meller suffers from an irredeemably awful script, and even director John Irvin&#x27;s engaging sense of how absurd the proceedings are can&#x27;t work an alchemist&#x27;s magic.&quot; Writing in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Sheila Benson began, &quot;Has it come to this? That we can feel vaguely cheered that &quot;Raw Deal&quot; (citywide), where the bodies again pile up like cordwood, is a better made movie than &quot;Cobra&quot;?&quot; However, she praised Schwarzenegger, saying that his strength as an actor is &quot;not that he can toss grown men over ceiling beams, but that he has a vein of sweetness and self-deprecation that no amount of mayhem can obliterate ... it has shone from him since &quot;Pumping Iron&quot;, it has allowed him to surmount silly and unwise pieces of action (such as the drunk scenes in one of the &quot;Conans&quot; and here), and even his own awkwardness as an actor.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film 1 star out of 4 and noted that it had &quot;essentially the same story&quot; as &quot;Cobra&quot;, &quot;but it is told with so many superfluous characters that we&#x27;re never really sure whose side a few key people are on. Needless to say, in a film filled with punch-outs, we very quickly don&#x27;t care.&quot; Paul Attanasio of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; dismissed the film as &quot;a mostly tedious, cheaply made shoot-em-up&quot; that &quot;recycles the clichés that have long been the cud of television cop dramas.&quot; Pauline Kael of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; called it &quot;reprehensible and enjoyable, the kind of movie that makes you feel brain dead after two minutes—after which point you&#x27;re ready to laugh at its mixture of trashiness, violence, and startlingly silly crude humor.&quot;

&quot;Raw Deal&quot; holds a score of 31% on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, based on 16 reviews with an average rating of 4.6/10. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 44 out of 100 based on 12 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

<text>Béla Heinrich Bánáthy (; December 1, 1919 – September 4, 2003) was a Hungarian-American linguist, and Professor at San Jose State University and UC Berkeley. He is known as founder of the White Stag Leadership Development Program, established the International Systems Institute in 1982, and was co-founder of the General Evolutionary Research Group in 1984.

He grew up in largely rural Hungary and served in the Hungarian military during World War II. When Russia invaded Hungary in April 1945, he and his family fled to Allied-occupied Austria and lived in a displaced persons camp for six years. In 1951, they emigrated to Chicago, sponsored by the Presbyterian church. Within the year his former commanding officer suggested to the U.S. government that they hire Bánáthy as a Hungarian instructor at the Army Language School in Monterey, California. While living in Monterey, he founded the White Stag Leadership Development Program.

His program gained national attention, and the Boy Scouts of America conducted research into incorporating leadership training into its programs. The Boy Scouts of America&#x27;s Wood Badge and junior leader training programs had until then focused primarily on Scoutcraft skills, not leadership. William &quot;Green Bar Bill&quot; Hillcourt among others resisted the change.

After 20 years, Bánáthy left the renamed Defense Language Institute and went to work for the Far West Laboratory for Research and Development in Berkeley and later San Francisco. He retired from Far West in 1989 but maintained an active interest in social systems and science, including attending many conferences and advising students and others in those fields. In 1992, he helped restart the Hungarian Scout Association within his native country. In 2003, Bánáthy and Eva moved to live with their son Tibor in Chico, California. After a brief and unexpected illness, Bánáthy died on September 4, 2003.

== Biography ==
Béla Bánáthy was born in 1919 in Gyula, Hungary, as the oldest of four sons. His father Peter was a minister of the Reformed Church in Hungary and his mother Hildegard Pallmann was a teacher. Peter Bánáthy had earned the honorary title Vitéz for his service during World War I, and Béla, as his oldest son, inherited the title.

===Military service during World War II===
In 1937, Bánáthy entered the :hu:Ludovika Akadémia as was the custom for young men aspiring to military careers. In 1940, at age 21, he was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the armored infantry. Later that year he met his future wife Eva Balazs. The peacetime Hungarian Army received very little training. Bánáthy served two tours on the Russian front in World War II as an armored infantry officer. The Hungarian Army expanded rapidly from an initial force of 80,000, but when fighting started, the rank-and-file of the army had undergone only eight weeks of training.

In 1941, Bánáthy&#x27;s unit advanced as part of German Army Group South to within of Moscow, during a severe November ice storm. In 1942, as a soldier in the 109,000 strong Second Hungarian Army (Second Magyar Honved), Bánáthy returned to the Russian front. They fought in the Battle of Voronezh at the Don River bend, supporting the German attack. They were charged with protecting the 8th Italian Army&#x27;s&#x27;s northern flank between the Novaya Pokrovka on the Don River to Rossosh, part of the larger force defending the drive by the German 6th Army against Soviet General Vasily Chuikov&#x27;s 62nd Army, which was defending Stalingrad. Bánáthy was seriously wounded during the action, and he returned from the front to Budapest where he spent seven months recuperating. He married his fiancé, Eva Balazs, with his arm in a sling on December 5, 1942 in Budapest.

Bánáthy was promoted as a junior officer of the Royal Hungarian Army and served on the faculty of the Ludovika Akademia under his mentor, Commandant Colonel-General Kisbarnaki General Farkas. Farkas sought a volunteer to teach junior leader training at the academy and Bánáthy volunteered. Farkas also asked Bánáthy to organize a Scout Troop for young men, 19 years and older, which was a common practice within the Hungarian Scout Association at the time. Bánáthy became committed to training the young men in officer&#x27;s leadership skills; he served as the voluntary national director for youth leadership development and a member of the National Council of the Hungarian Scout Association.

In July 1944 Farkas was Commander of the Hungarian VI Army Corps, which had been garrisoned at Debrecen. He replaced General Beregfy, who was loyal to the fascist Arrow Cross Party. During that month, Farkas&#x27; VI Army Corps was instrumental in repelling a Red Army attack across the Carpathian Mountains. On 15 October 1944, Farkas was named commander of the Pest bridgehead and Government Commissioner for Evacuation. In early November 1944, the first Russian units appeared on the southeastern edge of Budapest. As an associate of Farkas, Bánáthy likely had advance notice of the Russian advance. He also knew he would likely be executed if captured. Bánáthy was able to get his wife Eva, one-year-old son Béla and two-week-old son László out of Budapest. Bánáthy&#x27;s family, along with other officers and their families, found shelter at first in farmhouses, and later in bunkers, caves, and trenches.

When the Hungarian Second Army was disbanded on 1 December 1944 due to a lack of equipment and personnel, the remaining units of the Second Army, including Bánáthy&#x27;s, were transferred to the Third Army. The siege of Budapest began when the city was encircled on 29 December 1944 by the Red Army. Bánáthy fought with the remainder of his unit against the Russians until after Budapest fell on 13 February 1945. The Axis was striving to protect the last oil fields they controlled in western Hungary around Lake Balaton. By late March 1945, most of what was left of the Hungarian Third Army was surrounded and destroyed about to the west of Budapest in an advance by the Soviet 46th Army towards Vienna. The remaining shattered units fought on as they retreated progressively westward through the Transdanubian Mountains towards Austria.

Bánáthy&#x27;s family and others of the remainder of his and other military units made their way west, along with tens of thousands of other refugees, about into Austria, trying to stay ahead of advancing Russian troops. Temperatures through the time of their flight remained near .

===Life in displaced persons camp===
Bánáthy reunited with his family in Austria. As the war ended and Austria was occupied in April 1945 by the French, British, Soviet and US military forces, the family was placed in an Allied displaced persons camp. They were housed in a single room in a wooden barrack; it served as their bedroom, kitchen, living room and firewood storage area. Food was extremely scarce and at times they subsisted on around 600 calories per person per day. They were among 1.4 million displaced persons in Austria at the time during a worldwide food shortage as a result of the war. Food was also severely restricted by punitive U.S. policies including directive JCS 1067. In 1947 German citizens were surviving on 1040 calories a day, but the Allies were also suffering from food shortages.

Bánáthy later traded for milk to give two-year-old Béla and one-year-old László enough protein. As extremely little food was available in the camps, in early 1947 his wife&#x27;s twin sister came from Hungary to take their older two sons back to live with the older sister. The Pallendal family, Bánáthy&#x27;s in-laws, was well-educated and relatively wealthy, so they had access to more food than what was available in the camps. They intended to return the Banathy boys to their parents within a year. Beginning in early 1948, when the Cold War ensued, it became virtually impossible for refugees or displaced persons to cross from the border of one country into another, or even from one Occupation Zone to another. The Pallendal family could not return the two boys from behind the Iron Curtain.

In 1948, shortly after their third son Tibor was born, the Banathy family was moved to another camp, near a Marshall Plan warehouse. Bánáthy was assigned to unload sacks of wheat from railroad cars. He contacted the World Scouting Movement for assistance and began to organize scouting in the DP camps. During 1947, Bánáthy was named the Hungarian Scout Commissioner for Austria; he led training for Hungarian Scout leaders along with his former commanding officer Farkas. He was ordained by the World Council of Churches and became minister for youth among Hungarian refugees. Banathy served as director of religious education of the Protestant Refugee Service of Austria, was editor of a religious youth service and of a Scout publication.

In 1948 Bánáthy&#x27;s fourth son Robert was born. Bánáthy soon found work as a technical draftsman in the statistical office of a U.S. Army warehouse. In 1949, with help from a Swiss foundation, Bánáthy assisted in establishing and was selected as the President of the Collegium Hungaricum, a boarding school for refugees, at Zell am See near Saalfelden, Austria. In the same year, the Communist government in Hungary seized the businesses belonging to the Pallendal family. Because they were members of the social elite, the Communist government considered them to be a political threat.

In 1951, in what was a common practice during this time, the Hungarian Police arrived at dawn to seize the Pallendal family home and arrest and deport the family from Budapest. Seven-year-old Béla and six-year-old László Banathy, along with their Pallendal grandmother and two aunts, were put aboard a freight train and sent toward Russia. The train stopped occasionally and a few hundred people were forced off at rural towns. The Pallendal family was ejected in eastern Hungary. There an uncle located them and hid them from authorities in a small village.

===Emigrates to the United States===
In January, 1951, the student body of the Presbyterian McCormick Theological Seminary in Chicago sponsored Béla, Eva, Tibor and Robert Banathy as refugees to the United States. Bánáthy lived with his family at the Seminary, where he worked nights 60 hours a week shoveling coal to fire the Seminary furnace. At the same time, he was studying English from a book. He occasionally preached at nearby Hungarian churches. His wife found work as a machine operator and Tibor, their third son, entered American public school.

===Begins teaching Hungarian===
Bánáthy moved to Monterey in June 1951, a pivotal change in his life. At the Army Language School, he met Joseph Szentkiralyi (Americanized as St. Clair), the founder of the Hungarian Department. They soon figured out they had met at the 4th World Scout Jamboree in 1933. The wives of the two men also realized they had been girlhood friends in grammar school in Budapest. Using her experience managing the Pallendal family restaurant in Budapest before World War II, Eva took work as a waitress in a restaurant on the Monterey Peninsula. Bánáthy served as President of his local Parent-Teacher Association and on the board of the local Red Cross.

On February 28, 1956, Bánáthy was naturalized as a United States citizen. After nine years of separation, and repeated failures to get his sons repatriated from behind the Iron Curtain, Bánáthy obtained help from Dr. Eugene Blake, President of the National Council of Churches; Representative Charles M. Teague; Ernest Nagy, Vice Consul in the U.S. Legation in Budapest; Hulda Neiburh of the McCormick Theological Seminary; and Howard Pyle, deputy assistant to President Dwight D. Eisenhower. He was finally able to arrange for 13-year-old Béla and 11-year-old László to emigrate to the United States A photograph of the two boys greeting their mother was featured in &quot;Life Magazine.&quot;
 The boys were greeted by their parents at San Francisco International Airport at 1:10 a.m. The boys&#x27; release marked the first time since the Cold War that anyone under 65 years old had been allowed to leave Hungary to be reunited with family.

== Professional life ==
Bánáthy was an educator, a systems and design scientist, and an author. At the Army Language School, he taught in the Hungarian language department, later becoming its chairman.

=== White Stag Leadership Development Program ===
In 1957 Bánáthy began enlarging a concept for a leadership development program. As Council Training Chairman in the Monterey Bay Area Council of the Boy Scouts of America, he received strong support from the Council Executive and Council Executive Board for his proposal to train boys in leadership skills. He was assisted by fellow Hungarians Joe Szentkiralyi (aka St. Clair, Chair of the Hungarian Language Department at the Army Language school) and Paul Sujan (Hungarian Language Instructor at the Army Language school); Fran Peterson (a member of the National Council and a Scoutmaster from Chular, California); and Maury Tripp (a Scouter from Saratoga, California, a member of the National Council, and a research scientist). &quot;Lord Baden-Powell was my personal idol and I long felt a commitment to give back to Scouting what I had received&quot;, Bánáthy said.

As part of his master&#x27;s degree program in counseling psychology at San José State University, he wrote a thesis titled &quot;A Design for Leadership Development in Scouting&quot;. This book described the founding principles of the White Stag program, which was later adapted by the National Council of the Boy Scouts of America. Prior to Bánáthy&#x27;s work, the adult Wood Badge and the junior leader training programs had focused on teaching Scoutcraft skills and some aspects of the Patrol Method. His research and findings on teaching principles and competencies of leadership had a huge impact on these two programs, shifting their focus to leadership skills.

Some individuals on the national staff and many volunteers across the nation resisted the idea of changing the focus of Wood Badge from training leaders in Scoutcraft to leadership skills. Among them was William &quot;Green Bar Bill&quot; Hillcourt, who had been the first United States Wood Badge Course Director in 1948. Although officially retired, he had many loyal followers. He was adamant that Wood Badge should continue to teach Scoutcraft skills and tried to persuade the national council to stick to that tradition, but his objections were ignored.

The leadership competencies Banathy articulated became the &quot;de facto&quot; method for Scout adult and junior leader training. (In 2008, the White Stag program celebrated its 50th anniversary.) In 1960, the Monterey Bay Area Council recognized Béla for his exceptional service to youth and awarded him the Silver Beaver.

In the 1970s, due to the success of the White Stag program, Bánáthy was appointed to the Interamerican Scout Committee and participated in three interamerican &quot;Train the Trainer&quot; events in Mexico, Costa Rica, and Venezuela.

===Systems science===

In the 1960s Bánáthy began teaching courses in applied linguistics and systems science at San José State University. In 1962 he was named Dean and Chairman of the East Europe and Middle East Division at the Army Language School, overseeing ten language departments. In 1963 he completed his master&#x27;s degree in psychology at San Jose State University, and in 1966 he received a doctorate in education for a transdisciplinary program in education, systems theory, and linguistics from the University of California in Berkeley. During the mid-1960s Bánáthy was named Chair of Western Division of the Society for General Systems Research. He published his first book, &quot;Instructional Systems,&quot; in 1968.

===Large complex systems===

During the 1960s and 1970s, Bánáthy was a visiting professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and as he continued teaching at San Jose State University. In 1969, he left the renamed Defense Language Institute and became a Program Director, and later Senior Research Director and Associate Laboratory Director, at the Far West Laboratory for Research and Development (now WestEd) in Berkeley (later moved to San Francisco). He &quot;directed over fifty research and development programs, designed many curriculum projects and several large scale complex systems, including the design and implementation of a Ph.D. program in educational research and development for UC Berkeley&quot;.

In the 1970s and 1980s, he focused his research on the application of systems and design theories and methodologies in social, social service, educational, and human development systems. In the 1980s he developed and guided a Ph.D. curriculum in humanistic systems inquiry and social systems design for the Saybrook Graduate School.

===General Evolutionary Research Group===
In 1984, Bánáthy was co-founder with general evolution theorist Ervin László and others of the initially secret General Evolutionary Research Group, or General Evolutionary Research Group. A member of the Society of General Systems Research since the 1960s, he was Managing Director of the Society in the early 1980s, and in 1985 he became its president. He then served on its Board of Trustees. During the 1980s, he served on the Executive Committee of the International Federation of Systems Research. In 1989, he retired from Far West Labs and returned to live on the Monterey Peninsula. He continued to serve as Professor Emeritus for the Saybrook Graduate School, counseling Ph.D. students. He also continued his work with the annual ISI international systems design conversations, and authored a number of articles and books about systems, design, and evolutionary research. He served two terms as president of the International Federation of Systems Research during 1994-98.

He coordinated over twenty international systems research conferences held in eight countries, including the 1994 Conversation on Systems Design held at Fuschl Am See, Austria, sponsored by the International Federation of Systems Research. He was also honorary editor of three international systems journals: Systems Research and Behavioral Science, the Journal of Applied Systems Studies, and Systems. He was on the Board of Editors of World Futures, and served as a contributing editor of Educational Technology.

==Final years==

In the summer of 2003 Bánáthy and his wife moved to live with their son Tibor in Chico, California. After a brief and unexpected illness, Bánáthy died on September 4, 2003. He and Eva had been married 64 years at the time of his death.

<text>The Karoo ( ; from the Afrikaans borrowing of the South Khoekhoe !Orakobab or Khoemana word &quot;ǃ’Aukarob&quot; &quot;Hardveld&quot;) is a semi-desert natural region of South Africa. No exact definition of what constitutes the Karoo is available, so its extent is also not precisely defined. The Karoo is partly defined by its topography, geology and climate, and above all, its low rainfall, arid air, cloudless skies, and extremes of heat and cold. The Karoo also hosted a well-preserved ecosystem hundreds of million years ago which is now represented by many fossils.

The ǃ’Aukarob formed an almost impenetrable barrier to the interior from Cape Town, and the early adventurers, explorers, hunters, and travelers on the way to the Highveld unanimously denounced it as a frightening place of great heat, great frosts, great floods, and great droughts. Today, it is still a place of great heat and frosts, and an annual rainfall of between 50 and 250 mm, though on some of the mountains it can be 250 to 500 mm higher than on the plains. However, underground water is found throughout the Karoo, which can be tapped by boreholes, making permanent settlements and sheep farming possible.

The xerophytic vegetation consists of aloes, mesembryanthemums, crassulas, euphorbias, stapelias, and desert ephemerals, spaced 50 cm or more apart, and becoming very sparse going northwards into Bushmanland and, from there, into the Kalahari Desert. The driest region of the Karoo, however, is its southwestern corner, between the Great Escarpment and the Cederberg-Skurweberg mountain ranges, called the Tankwa Karoo, which receives only 75 mm of rain annually. The eastern and north-eastern Karoo are often covered by large patches of grassland. The typical Karoo vegetation used to support large game, sometimes in vast herds.

Today, sheep thrive on the xerophytes, though each sheep requires about of grazing to sustain itself.

==Divisions==
The Karoo is divided into the Great Karoo and the Klein Karoo. The Klein Karoo is delimited in the south by the Outeniqua–Langeberg Mountains that run east–west parallel to the coast, and in the north by the Swartberg Mountain Range that also runs east–west. The Great Karoo lies to the north the Swartberg.

===Great Karoo===
The only sharp and definite boundary of the Great Karoo is formed by the most inland ranges of Cape Fold Mountains to the south and south-west. The extent of the Karoo to the north is vague, fading gradually and almost imperceptibly into the increasingly arid Bushmanland towards the north-west. To the north and north-east, it fades into the savannah and grasslands of Griqualand West and the Highveld. The boundary to the east grades into the grasslands of the Eastern Midlands.
The Great Karoo is itself divided by the Great Escarpment into the Upper Karoo (generally above 1200–1500 m) and the Lower Karoo on the plains below at 700–800 m.
A great many local names, each denoting different subregions of the Great Karoo, exist, some more widely, or more generally, known than others. In the Lower Karoo, going from west to east, they are the Tankwa Karoo, the Moordenaarskaroo, the Koup, the Vlakte, and the Camdeboo Plains. The Hantam, Kareeberge, Roggeveld, and uweveldare the better known subregions of the Upper Karoo, though most of it is simply known as the Upper Karoo, especially in the north.

===Klein Karoo===
The Klein Karoo&#x27;s boundaries are sharply defined by mountain ranges to the west, north, and south. The road between Uniondale and Willowmore is considered, by convention, to form the approximate arbitrary eastern extremity of the Klein Karoo. Its extent is much smaller than that of the Great Karoo. It is called the &quot;Klein Karoo&quot;, which is Afrikaans for Little Karoo.

==Geography==
===Great Karoo===
The Great Karoo straddles the 30° S parallel on the west of the continent, in a similar position to other semidesert areas on earth, north and south of the equator. It is furthermore in the rainfall shadow of the Cape Fold Mountains along the western coastline. 
The western &quot;Lower Karoo&quot; (the Tankwa Karoo and Moordenaarskaroo) contain remnants of the Cape Fold Mountains (e.g. the Witteberg and Anysberg Mountains) which give it a moderate hilly appearance, but further east, the Lower Karoo becomes a monotonously flat plain. The &quot;Upper Karoo&quot; has been intruded by dolerite sills (see below), creating multiple flat-topped hills, or Karoo Koppies, which are iconic of the Great Karoo.

The vegetation of the Upper is similar to the Lower Karoo, so few people make a distinction between the two.

The main highway (the N1) and railway line from Cape Town to the north enter the Lower Karoo from the Hex River Valley just before Touws River and follow a course about 50 km south of the Great Escarpment up to Beaufort West. Thereafter, they gradually ascend the Great Escarpment along a broad valley to Three Sisters on the Central Plateau and the Upper Karoo.

Turning north from the N1 between Touws River and Beaufort West, at Matjiesfontein, the road ascends the Great Escarpment through the Verlatenkloof Pass to reach Sutherland, at 1456 m above sea level, which is reputedly the coldest town in South Africa with average minimum temperatures of −6.1 °C during winter. Parts of the eastern Mpumalangan Highveld do at times experience lower temperatures than Sutherland, but not as consistently as Sutherland does. Snowfalls are not infrequent during the southern winter months. The South African Astronomical Observatory has an emplacement of telescopes about 20 km east of the town, on a small plateau 1798 m above sea level, and is home to the Southern African Large Telescope, the largest optical telescope in the Southern Hemisphere. To the north, still on the Plateau, and 75 km north-west of Carnarvon, seven radio dishes form part of the Square Kilometer Array which will, 2500 in total, be scattered in other parts of South Africa and Australia, to survey the southern skies at radio frequencies. Our galaxy, the Milky Way, one of the main targets of this enterprise, is best viewed from the Southern Hemisphere.
The Upper Karoo is indeed an ideal site for an astronomical observatory. This is not only because of the clear skies, absence of artificial lights, and high altitude, but also because it is tectonically completely inactive (meaning that there are no fault lines or volcanoes nearby, and no earth tremors or earthquakes occur, even at great distances).

===Klein Karoo===
The Klein Karoo is separated from the Great Karoo by the Swartberg Mountain range. 
Geographically, it is a 290 km-long valley, only 40–60 km wide, formed by two parallel Cape Fold Mountain ranges, the Swartberg to the north, and the continuous Langeberg-Outeniqua range to the south. The northern strip of the valley, within 10–20 km from the foot of the Swartberg mountains is least karoo-like, in that it is a well-watered area both from the rain and the many streams that cascade down the mountain, or through narrow defiles in the Swartberg from the Great Karoo. The main towns of the region are situated along this northern strip of the Klein Karoo: Montagu, Barrydale, Ladismith, Calitzdorp, Oudtshoorn, and De Rust, as well as such well-known mission stations such as Zoar, Amalienstein, and Dysselsdorp.
The southern 30– to 50 km-wide strip, north of the Langeberg range, is as arid as the western Lower Karoo, except in the east, where the Langeberg range (arbitrarily) starts to be called the Outeniqua Mountains.

The Klein Karoo can only be accessed by road through the narrow defiles cut through the surrounding Cape Fold Mountains by ancient, but still flowing, rivers. A few roads traverse the mountains over passes, the most famous and impressive of which is the Swartberg Pass between Oudtshoorn in the Klein Karoo and Prince Albert on the other side of the Swartberg mountains in the Great Karoo. Also, the main road between Oudtshoorn and George, on the coastal plain, crosses the mountains to the south via the Outeniqua Pass. The only exit from the Klein Karoo that does not involve crossing a mountain range is through the 150 km-long, narrow Langkloof valley between Uniondale and Humansdorp, near Plettenberg Bay.

==Geology of the Karoo==
===The Great Karoo===

In geological terms, the Karoo Supergroup refers to an extensive and geologically recent (180–310 million years old) sequence of sedimentary and igneous rocks, which is flanked to the south by the Cape Fold Mountains, and to the north by the more ancient Ventersdorp Lavas, the Transvaal Supergroup and Waterberg Supergroup. It covers two-thirds of South Africa and extends in places to 8000 m below the land surface, constituting an immense volume of rocks which was formed, geologically speaking, in a short period of time.
Although almost the whole of the Great Karoo is situated on Karoo Supergroup rocks, the geological Karoo rocks extend over a very much larger area, both within South Africa and Lesotho, but also beyond its borders and onto other continents that formed part of Gondwana.

===Geological history of the Karoo Supergroup===
The Karoo Supergroup was formed in a vast inland basin starting 320 million years ago, at a time when that part of Gondwana which would eventually become Africa, lay over the South Pole. Icebergs that had calved off the glaciers and ice sheets to the north deposited a 1 km-thick layer of mud containing dropstones of varying origins and sizes into this basin. This became the Dwyka Group consisting primarily of tillite, the lowermost layer of the Karoo Supergroup. As Gondwana drifted northwards, the basin turned into an inland sea with extensive swampy deltas along its northern shores. The peat in these swamps eventually turned into large deposits of coal which are mined in KwaZulu-Natal and on the Highveld. This 3 km-thick layer is known as the Ecca Group, which is overlain by the 5.6 km-thick Beaufort Group, laid down on a vast plain with Mississippi-like rivers depositing mud from an immense range of mountains to the south. Ancient reptiles and amphibians prospered in the wet forests, and their remains have made the Karoo famous amongst palaeontologists. The first of these Karoo fossils was discovered in 1838 by Scots-born Andrew Geddes Bain at a road cutting near Fort Beaufort. He sent his specimens to the British Museum, where fellow Scotsman Robert Broom recognised the Karoo fossils&#x27; mammal-like characteristics in 1897.

After the Beaufort period, Southern Africa (still part of Gondwana) became an arid sand desert with only ephemeral rivers and pans. These sands consolidated to form the Stormberg Group, the remnants of which are found only in the immediate vicinity of Lesotho. Several dinosaur nests, containing eggs, some with dinosaur fetal skeletons in them, have been found in these rocks, near what had once been a swampy pan.

Finally, about 180 million years ago, volcanic activity took place on a titanic scale, which brought an end to a flourishing reptile evolution. These genera represent some of the extinct, mainly predinosaur, animals of the Karoo:
Karoo Koppies hills are capped by hard, erosion-resistant dolerite sills. This is solidified lava that was forced under high pressure between the horizontal strata of the sedimentary rocks that make up most of the Karoo&#x27;s geology. This occurred about 180 million years ago, when huge volumes of lava were extruded over most of Southern Africa and adjoining regions of Gondwana, both on the surface and deep below the surface between the sedimentary strata. Since this massive extrusion of lava, Southern Africa has undergone a prolonged period of erosion, exposing the older, softer rocks, except where they were protected by a cap of dolerite. The genera present include:

*&quot;Mesosaurus&quot;, aquatic Dwyka carnivore
*&quot;Bradysaurus&quot;, Beaufort Group herbivore
*&quot;Owenetta&quot;, Beaufort Group insectivore
*&quot;Procolophon&quot;, Beaufort Group omnivore
*&quot;Diictodon&quot;, Permian synapsid
*&quot;Rubidgea&quot;, Permian predator
*&quot;Lystrosaurus&quot;, Triassic herbivorous therapsid
*&quot;Thrinaxodon&quot;, Triassic carnivorous therapsid
*&quot;Euparkeria&quot;, archosaur
*&quot;Massospondylus&quot;, late Triassic to early Jurassic herbivorous, bipedal dinosaur
*&quot;Megazostrodon&quot;, early mammal
The lava outpourings that ended the Karoo deposition of rocks, not only covered the African surface, and other parts of Gondwana with a 1.6 km thick layer basaltic lava, but it also forced its way, under high pressure, between the horizontal layers of sedimentary rocks belonging to the Ecca and Beaufort groups, to solidify into dolerite sills. The long vertical fissures through which the lava welled up solidified into dikes which resemble the Great Wall of China from the air. 
From about 150 million years ago the South African surface has been subjected to an almost uninterrupted period of erosion, particularly during the past 20 million years, shaving off many kilometers of sediments. This exposed the dolerite sills, which were more resistant to erosion than the Karoo sediments, forming one of the most characteristic features of the Karoo landscape, namely the flat topped hills, called &quot;Karoo Koppies&quot;.

===Geology of the Klein Karoo===
The geology of the Klein Karoo bears no resemblance to that of the Great Karoo (see the diagram on the left, of a NS geological cross-section through the Klein and Great Karoos). The valley is an integral part of the Cape Fold Mountain Belt, with the two ranges on either side composed of extremely hard, erosion-resistant, quartzitic sandstone belonging to the 450- to 510-million-year-old Table Mountain Group (i.e. the oldest layer of the Cape Supergroup). The valley floor is covered, in the main, by the next (younger) layer of the Supergroup, namely the much softer Bokkeveld shales. The dolerite of the Great Karoo did not penetrate these rocks, so Karoo Koppies are not seen in the Klein Karoo.

The Klein Karoo contains two other geological features that give the landscape a special character. During the erosion of the African interior following the bulging of the continent during the massive lava outpourings that ended the Karoo sedimentation 180 million years ago, some of the eroded material was trapped in the valleys of the Cape Fold Mountains, especially during the Cretaceous period, about to years (Ma) ago. These &quot;Enon Conglomerates&quot;, as they are known, were deposited by high energy, fast flowing rivers, and are found between Calitzdorp and Oudtshoorn, where they form the strikingly red &quot;Redstone Hills&quot;.

The second special geological feature that marks the Kelin Karoo is the 300 km-long fault line along the southern edge of the Swartberg Mountains. The Swartberg Mountains were lifted up along this fault, to such an extent that in the Oudtshoorn region, the rocks that form the base of the Cape Supergroup are exposed. These are locally known as the Cango Group, but are probably continuous with the Malmesbury Group that forms the base of Table Mountain on the Cape Peninsula, and similar outcrops in the Western Cape. In the Klein Karoo, the outcrop is composed of limestone, into which an underground stream has carved the impressively extensive Cango Caves.

==Karoo flora==

The World Wildlife Fund has classified the Great Karoo and Klein Karoo as almost entirely within two of what they consider South Africa&#x27;s eight botanical biomes,
they have coined their biomes succulent Karoo and the Nama Karoo, although both, like the geological Karoo Supergroup, are more extensive than the geographical or historical Karoo described in South African atlases and guide books (compare the map on the right with the map at the beginning of the article).

===Succulent Karoo biome===

The succulent Karoo biome runs along the West Coast, from approximately Lamberts Bay northwards to over 200 km into southern Namibia. It starts in the south just north of the sandveld geographical region, about 250 km north of Cape Town, and continues through Namaqualand, the Richtersveld, immediately south of the Orange River, and on into the Namaqualand or Namaland region of southern Namibia. None of these regions is ever referred to, either geographically or locally, as &quot;Karoo&quot;. However, it has a major extension inland into the Tankwa Karoo and Moordenaarskaroo regions of the Lower Karoo, and adjoining Upper Karoo region of the geographic Great Karoo. It also occurs to the south, in part of the Breede River Valley, as the Robertson Karoo. From here, it continues eastwards into the western half of the Klein Karoo. 

The succulent Karoo biome is dominated by dwarf, leafy-succulent shrubs, and annuals, predominantly Asteraceae, popularly known as Namaqualand daisies, which put on spectacular flower displays covering vast stretches of the landscape in the southern spring-time (August–September) after good rains in the winter. Grasses are uncommon, making most of the biome unsuitable for grazing. The low rainfall, in fact, discourages most forms of agriculture. An exception is the thriving ostrich-farming industry in the KLein Karoo, which is heavily dependent on supplementary feeding with lucerne. The difference between the succulent Karoo biome and the Nama Karoo biome is that the former receives the little rain that falls as cyclonic rainfall in winter, which has less erosive power than the infrequent but violent summer thunderstorms of the Nama Karoo. Frost is also less common in the succulent Karoo biome than in the Nama Karoo biome. The number of mainly succulent plant species is very high for an arid area of this size anywhere in the world.

===Nama Karoo biome===

The Nama Karoo biome is located entirely on the central plateau mostly at altitudes between 1000 and 1500 m. It incorporates nearly the whole of the historical and geographical Great Karoo, but also includes a portion of southern Namibia&#x27;s Namaqualand, and South Africa&#x27;s Bushmanland (both local geographical names, not names of biomes). It is the second-largest biome in South Africa, and forms the botanical transition between the fynbos biome to the south and the savannah biome to the north. It is defined primarily by the dominance of dwarf (less than 1 m high) shrubs with a co-dominance of grasses especially towards the north-east and east where it grades into the grassland biome of the highveld and the Eastern Midlands. The shrubs and grasses are deciduous, mainly in response to the irregular rainfall. 
Much of the Nama Karoo biome is used for sheep and goat farming, providing mutton, wool, and pelts for local and international markets, especially since livestock can frequently be provided with a regular supply of water from boreholes. Overgrazing exacerbates the erosion caused by the violent thunderstorms that occur, infrequently, in the summer. It also promotes the replacement of the grasses by shrubs, especially the less edible varieties such as the threethorn (&quot;Rhigozum trichotomum&quot;), bitterbos (&quot;Chrysocoma ciliata&quot;), and sweet thorn (&quot;Acacia karroo&quot;). However, there are few rare or Red Data Book plant species in the Nama Karoo biome.

==Karoo fauna==
===Great Karoo===
The Great Karoo used to support a large variety of antelope (particularly the springbok), the quagga, and other large game, especially on the grassy flats in the east. Francois Le Vaillant, the famous French explorer, naturalist, and ornithologist, who traveled through the Great Karoo in the 1780s, killed a hippopotamus in the Great Fish River in the Karoo (and ate its foot for breakfast). He also recorded that he saw the spoor of a rhinoceros near Cranemere, in the Camdeboo Plains (eastern Lower Karoo). Elephant tusks have been found by farmers in the Camdeboo district, but no records exist of any having been seen alive in that region.
The quagga roamed the Karoo in great numbers together with wildebeest and ostriches, which always seemed to accompany them. These quagga seemed gentle and easy to domesticate. (A pair of quagga was used to draw a horse carriage through London, more for curiosity than for any superiority the quagga might have had over a horse.) They were consequently also easy prey for hunters, who hunted them for sport rather than their meat. By the middle of the 1800s, they were almost extinct, and in 1883, the last one died in an Amsterdam zoo.
Probably the strangest and most puzzling zoological phenomenon in the Great Karoo was the periodic, unpredictable appearance of massive springbok migrations. These migrations always came from the north, and could either go west towards Namaqualand and the sea, south-west through towns such as Beaufort West, or south through the Camdeboo district. These vast herds moved steadily and inexorably across the plains, trampling all before them, including their own kind. Le Vaillant gave the first eyewitness account of such a migration in 1782. He rode through the herd filling the Plains of Camdeboo, seeing neither the beginning nor end of the moving mass.
In 1849, a massive herd of springbok, amongst which were intermingled wildebeest, blesbok, quagga, and eland, moved through Beaufort West. Early one morning, the town was awakened to a sound like that of a strong wind, and suddenly the town was filled with animals. They devoured every sprig of foliage in the town and surrounding countryside. The last of the continuously moving herd left the town 3 days later, to disappear towards the west. The Karoo looked as if a fire had swept through it. During these migrations, the plains and hillsides on every side were thickly covered by one vast mass of springbok, packed like sheep in a fold. As far as the eye could see, the landscape was alive with them.

During these migrations, the springbok never ran or trotted. On the whole, they were silent, except for the shudder of their stamping hoofs. Nothing could divert them, and hunters could ride amongst them, shooting them at random, without apparently causing alarm. People could move amongst them and kill them with sticks, or cripple them by seizing a leg and breaking it. Not only people followed these herds for the easy meat they provided, but also lions, leopards, cheetahs, African wild dogs, hyenas, and jackals preyed on them.

No one knew how, why, or where these migrations started, nor where they ended, nor did anyone know if these animals ever returned to where they had started. The migrations were always unidirectional, from north of the Great Karoo.

Great locust swarms also frequently invaded or arose in the Great Karoo, and still occur from time to time today.

The riverine rabbit, a critically endangered animal, lives exclusively in seasonal river basins and a very particular set of scrubland in the central semiarid region in the Karoo. It is hunted by falconiformes and Verreaux&#x27;s eagles. Its numbers have been consistently lowering due to destruction of its habitat. They are unique relative to similar species through how they are polygamous and how each female can only produce one or two offspring per year.

The introduction of the windpump to tap the Great Karoo&#x27;s underground water resources in the late 1800s made permanent human habitation and sheep farming possible over large parts of the Great Karoo for the first time. As a result, the teeming number of large antelope in the Karoo has dwindled into insignificance, and with them, the large carnivores have all but disappeared. Today, the caracal (7–19 kg), black-backed jackal (6–10 kg), Verreaux&#x27;s eagle (3.0–5.8 kg) and the martial eagle (3.0–6.2 kg) are arguably the largest predators likely to be seen in the Great Karoo today. Leopards (20–90 kg) do occur, especially in the mountains, but are very secretive, so are rarely seen. Many of the animals that formerly inhabited the Karoo in large numbers, including lions, have been reintroduced to the area in nature reserves and game farms.

===Klein Karoo===
As in the Great Karoo, antelope and other big game inhabited the Klein Karoo in the past. However, the dominant zebra was not the quagga, but the Cape mountain zebra, (&quot;Equus zebra zebra&quot;) which is adapted for life on rugged, mountainous terrain. Their hooves are harder and faster-growing than those of Burchell&#x27;s zebra (&quot;Equus quagga burchellii&quot;), which lives on the plains. The two species are, therefore, rarely seen in the same habitat. The quagga is closely related to Burchell&#x27;s zebra, and appears also to have been confined to the plains.

The mountain zebra occurred in the mountain regions of the Cape Fold Belt and along the southern portion of the Great Escarpment. Thus, they were endemic to, amongst others, the western Lower Karoo and the Klein Karoo. However, they were hunted to near extinction, leaving fewer than 100 individuals by the 1930s. Conservation efforts since then brought their numbers up to 1200 by 1998, mainly by concentrating these zebra in nature reserves and protected areas, the most well-known of these being the Mountain Zebra National Park near Cradock in the Great Karoo. Cape mountain zebras are still found in protected areas managed by Cape Nature, including the Kamanassie and Gamkaberg Nature Reserves.

The ostrich is found throughout Africa, but the most handsome specimens came from the Klein Karoo, where the dry weather, but plentiful water in the streams formed an ideal habitat for these large, flightless birds. Here, they grow to over 2 m in height, and weigh over 100 kg. The male&#x27;s feathers have been prized by many cultures in Africa, Europe, and Asia over thousands of years. In the 1860s, a farmer in the Graaff-Reinet district was apparently the first person to demonstrate that the ostrich could successfully be domesticated, bred in captivity, and the eggs hatched in incubators, while still producing the magnificent feathers. This idea was quickly adopted by farmers in the Little Karoo, where they started growing lucerne as the birds&#x27; favorite food. During 1880, no less than 74,000 kg of feathers were exported, and in 1904, it passed the 210,000-kg mark.

The First World War brought about a slump in the ostrich feather market, but the industry recovered in later years, when not only the feathers were sought after, but also ostrich leather, and its meat, which is very tasty, and a major export item. Today, several farms can be visited by tourists, near Oudtshoorn, the center of the ostrich industry.

==Modern history==
===Great Karoo===
The first European settlers landed in the Cape of Good Hope in 1652, and between 1659 and 1664, made several unsuccessful attempts to penetrate the Great Karoo from the south-west. The Europeans who first entered the Great Karoo did so from the south-east (traveling north from Algoa Bay), which is slightly less arid than the western Karoo. These were the &quot;trekboers&quot; of the mid-1700s, who led a nomadic existence, enduring great hardships in the relentless aridity, the intense heat (such that even their dogs could not walk on the scorching ground and had to be lifted into the overcrowded wagons), and the bitter cold in winter, especially at night. Before that time, the only inhabitants were the Khoe-speaking clans migrating through the area, and !Ui-speaking peoples, who lived in small family groups and, it is believed, remained largely in their own &quot;territories&quot;, killing their own game, and gathering bulbs and roots and drinking from a spring or other water source within their territory. Sometimes these territories were very large and the family group moved from one part to the other. Their only domestic animals were dogs. The Ntu-speaking agriculturalists to the east of the Great Karoo did not occupy this arid region due to the scarce rainfall which prevented the farming of cattle.

In 1854, Daniel Halladay invented the multibladed windpump (windmill) in the USA. It was perfected in 1883, and soon South Africa (and elsewhere) produced them in large numbers. These windpumps transformed the Great Karoo, making permanent settlement and stock farming (predominantly sheep) possible over large parts of the Karoo for the first time. Like the Karoo Koppie, the multibladed windpump became an iconic feature of the Great Karoo.
Sheep farming and the fencing off of the land have meant that antelope numbers have dwindled significantly, and with them, the big carnivores. Leopards still occur in the mountains, but lions now only occur in nature reserves, where they have been recently reintroduced into the Great Karoo.
In 1872, construction was started to connect the Cape Colony&#x27;s coastal railway system with the diamond fields in Kimberley, The new line started in Worcester and entered the Lower Karoo through the Hex River valley, where it followed a course almost midway between the Swartberg Mountains to the south and the Great Escarpment to the north. Along the way, it passed through the quaint Victorian village of Matjiesfontein, with the historic Lord Milner Hotel, which is still operational today. The railway reached this point in 1878, before proceeding to Beaufort West at the foot of the Great Escarpment. From there, it reached the top of the African Plateau near Three Sisters along a valley with such a low gradient that passengers were (and still are) hardly aware that they were ascending the Great Escarpment. From there it continued through the Upper Karoo, to De Aar, and crossed the Orange River at Hopetown, where South Africa&#x27;s first diamond, the Eureka Diamond, was found. The Orange River, at this point, forms the local unofficial boundary between the Great Karoo and the Highveld.

The line reached Kimberley in 1885, and has since been extended via Botswana (then Bechuanaland) to reach Zimbabwe and Zambia (when they were still known as South and North Rhodesia), and branch lines have been constructed to Namibia and Port Elizabeth through a hub at De Aar, in the Great Karoo. Further branch lines were later built from points further north to Bloemfontein, Durban, and, of course, to Johannesburg.
During the Second Anglo-Boer War of 1899–1902, three Republican commando units, reinforced by the sympathizers (&quot;rebels&quot;) from the Cape Colony, conducted widespread operations throughout the Karoo. Countless skirmishes took place in the region, with the Calvinia magisterial district, in particular, contributing a significant number of fighters to the Republican cause. Fought both conventionally and as a guerrilla struggle over the Karoo&#x27;s vast expanses, it was a bloody war of attrition wherein both sides used newly developed technologies to their advantage. Numerous abandoned blockhouses can still be seen at strategic locations, especially along the railway line, throughout the Great Karoo. A prime example still &quot;guards&quot; a bridge over the Buffels River, to the east of the town of Laingsburg, in the Lower Karoo, between Matjiesfontein and Beaufort West.

Recently, nature reserves and game farms have been established in many parts of the Great Karoo, turning what was once regarded as a forbiddingly desolate and unattractive geographical barrier into a tourist destination.

===Klein Karoo===
This area was explored by European settlers in the late 17th century, who encountered the Khoisan people as the original inhabitants of this area. The latter called the Swartberg Mountains &quot;kango&quot; meaning &quot;a place rich in water&quot;. The Cango Caves in the Swartberg Mountains are named after this Khoisan word.

The Klein Karoo, and especially Oudtshoorn, became synonymous with the ostrich-feather industry in the 1880s. The resulting &quot;feather millionaires&quot; built Victorian &quot;Feather Palaces&quot; all over town, using the red rocks belonging to the Enon Conglomerate, and related Kirkwood Formation, to build them. These grand red palaces and other buildings in Oudtshoorn can still be admired today.

A railway line was built to connect Calitzdorp and Oudtshoorn, to Willowmore and from there, via Klipplaat, to Port Elizabeth, from where the ostrich feathers from the Klein Karoo&#x27;s ostrich farms could be exported to Europe. That line is no longer in use today.

The Swartberg Pass was built, with convict labor, between 1881 and 1888 by Thomas Bain, son of the famous Andrew Geddes Bain, who built Bain&#x27;s Kloof Pass and many others in the Western Cape. The main motivation for building the pass was to provide an all-weather road connection between the southern Great Karoo, and Oudtshoorn (and from there to the sea). The two alternative roads, through the Meiringspoort and the Seweweekspoort defiles, were subject to periodic flooding, after heavy thunderstorms in the Great Karoo. The Swartberg Pass is not tarred and can be treacherously slippery after rain. It also becomes impassable after heavy snowfalls on the mountain, a not infrequent occurrence in winter.

==Karoo in literature==
Poet Thomas Hardy wrote of the Karoo in his 1899 poem &quot;Drummer Hodge&quot; (or &quot;The Dead Drummer&quot;).

Rudyard Kipling, in his 1901 poem &quot;Bridge-Guard in the Karroo&quot;, evoked the loneliness experienced by blockhouse soldiers at Ketting station on the Dwyka River while guarding the Karoo railway track, a lifeline during the South African War.

<text>The shilling (Swahili: &quot;shilingi&quot;; abbreviation: TSh; code: TZS) is the currency of Tanzania. It is subdivided into 100 &quot;cents&quot; (&quot;senti&quot; in Swahili).
The Tanzanian shilling replaced the East African shilling on 14 June 1966 at par.

==Notation==

Prices in the Tanzanian shilling are written in the form of , where x is the amount above 1 shilling, while y is the amount in cents. An equals sign or hyphen represents zero amount. For example, 50 cents is written as &quot; and 100 shillings as &quot; or &quot;100/-&quot;. Sometimes the abbreviation &quot;TSh&quot; is prefixed for distinction. If the amount is written using words as well as numerals, only the prefix is used (e.g. TSh 10 million).

This pattern was modelled on sterling&#x27;s pre-decimal notation, in which amounts were written in some combination of pounds (£), shillings (s), and pence (d, for denarius). In that notation, amounts under a pound were notated only in shillings and pence.

==Coins==

In 1966, coins were introduced in denominations of , , and and , with the struck in bronze, the in nickel-brass (copper-nickel-zinc) and the -/50 and 1/= in cupro-nickel. Cupro-nickel coins were introduced in 1972, followed by scalloped, nickel-brass in 1977. This First Series coins set, in circulation from 1966 up to 1984, was designed by Christopher Ironside OBE.

In 1987, nickel-plated steel replaced cupro-nickel in the and , and cupro-nickel and coins were introduced, with the decagonal in shape. In 1990, nickel-clad-steel , and were introduced, followed by brass-plated steel coins for in 1993, in 1996 and copper-nickel-zinc in 1998.

Coins currently in circulation are the , , , and . The coin was issued on 8 September 2014.

==Banknotes==

On 14 June 1966, the Benki Kuu Ya Tanzania (Bank of Tanzania) introduced notes for , , and . The note was replaced by a coin in 1972. notes were introduced in 1985, followed by in 1986, in 1989 and in 1990.

<text>Voiron (; ) is a commune (French municipality) in the Isère department in southeastern France. It is the capital of the canton of Voiron and has been part of the Grenoble-Alpes Métropole since 2010. Voiron is located northwest of Grenoble and southeast of Lyon. Its roughly 20,000 inhabitants are named &quot;Voironnais&quot; in French.

Voiron, along with Chambéry and Grenoble, is a gateway city of the Chartreuse Mountains in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region.

== History ==

Voiron had been a part of the County of Savoy in the Middle Ages. In the Treaty of Paris (1355) the count exchanged Voiron and the rest of the region between the rivers Rhône and Isère (watered by the Guiers Mort) for Faucigny and Gex from France.

===17th and 18th centuries===
In 1700, the capital of the Chartreuse massif and its surrounding area had about 1,200 inhabitants and more than a hundred of them worked in the processing of hemp.

Since the beginning of the century, production had been organized around the Voironnaise factory and canvases were marked to certify their origin. The city acquired a great reputation thanks to its paintings resulting from a secular know-how. The privileges granted by Louis XII disappeared during the French Revolution. However, the production of canvas continued, and their reputation allowed Voiron to maintain this activity under the First Empire due in large part to purchases by the army.

===19th century===

The nineteenth century saw the decline of the era of canvas in Voiron because of the scarcity of linen and cotton, and because of the disappearance of the sailing navy which had been a large consumer of canvasses. Voiron came to be known for its fine silks, sought after by European royalties. Voiron then benefited from a female workforce, housed at the factory and often poorly paid. Voiron also gained religious influence marked by the 1876 erection of the Saint-Bruno church of neo-Gothic style by a first magistrate. A statue representing the Virgin Mary and the infant Jesus, a tribute to Notre-Dame-de-France Puy-en-Velay, was also erected.

===20th century===
The company Skis Rossignol was founded in 1907 by Abel Rossignol. Entire families of Voiron, along with Italian immigrants who arrived en masse at the beginning of the century, worked in these factories. On the eve of the First World War, the silk-weaving business used nearly 3,000 looms. At the same time, the rise of paper mills on the banks of the Morge, the river crossing the small town, attracted workers to the city. The company Radiall was founded as well and the population of Voiron grew past 15,000.

===21st century===
Voiron remains a significant economic and administrative center of the department of Isère. Voiron has sought to keep its independence from its much larger neighbor, the Grenoble conurbation. Voiron survived a difficult conversion after the departure of companies Rossignol and Johnson &amp; Johnson. Pays Voironnais is working to attract new jobs aimed at limiting the dormitory phenomenon already affecting the suburbs of Voiron. However, because of the urban sprawl between Voreppe and Voiron, this town has been considered by the National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE) as belonging to the Grenoble-Alpes Métropole since 2010.

== Geography ==
The city is located northwest of Grenoble and southeast of Lyon. Voiron is at an altitude of , on the Morge (a tributary of the Isère).

==Population==

== Sights ==
The church of St Bruno was built between 1864 and 1873 at the expense of the monks of the Grande Chartreuse. Voiron was the starting-point of the steam tramways to Saint-Laurent-du-Pont, (for the Grande Chartreuse), and to Charavines, over (for the Lac de Paladru).

The distillery Chartreuse Cellars is a popular tourist destination. It is the longest liqueur cellar in the world. The cellar is open year-round with English guided tours available during June, July, and August.

== Economy ==
Voiron is a manufacturing town, and it contains numerous factories. Companies include: Rossignol (skis), Radiall Connections, Antésite (a liquorice-flavored drink), Chartreuse liquor cellars, Bonnat Chocolatier (since 1884), and Allaman (manufacturing and transporting of petrol tanks).

<doc id="1312503" wikidata="Q5376697" url="?curid=1312503" title="Endymion (Disraeli novel)">
<text>Endymion is a novel published in 1880 by Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield, the former Conservative Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. He was paid an advance of £10,000 for it (). It was the last novel Disraeli published before his death. He had been writing another, &quot;Falconet&quot;, when he died; it was published, incomplete, after his death.

==Background==
Like most of Disraeli&#x27;s novels, &quot;Endymion&quot; is a romance, although Disraeli took the unusual step of setting it between 1819 and 1859. This meant that the hero of the novel–Endymion Ferrars–had to be a Whig, rather than a Tory. The time period that Disraeli chose was dominated by the Whig party; there would have been little opportunity for a young, rising Tory. Given that, it seems likely that Disraeli chose the time period in order to move a final time in the world in which he grew up and began his ascent.

==Plot==
William Pitt Ferrars, a rising Tory politician with cabinet ambitions, is disappointed of his hopes by the fall of the Tory ministry of the Duke of Wellington in 1832, and his party&#x27;s overwhelming defeat in that year&#x27;s parliamentary election.
He retires from his opulent house in Hill Street, London, to the modest country estate of Hurstley; his failure to reenter the government in Sir Robert Peel&#x27;s brief ministry in 1835, and his inability to secure a parliamentary seat in the subsequent elections, leads his wife to die of sorrow and disillusionment, and ultimately to his own suicide.

He leaves behind him two adolescent children, Endymion and Myra, who are determined to redeem their father&#x27;s legacy. Endymion has received a clerkship in Somerset House, a government office, and takes lodgings at the home of the Rodneys, former protégés of his parents; at Somerset House he becomes acquainted with fellow clerks Trenchard, Seymour Hicks, and the aspiring but pretentious novelist St. Barbe; Trenchard lays the foundations for his future career by introducing him to the debating club of the politically minded Bertie Tremaine.

In the meantime his sister is hired as a companion to the daughter of Adrian Neuchatel, a great Whig magnate and banker. Myra becomes a favorite member of the household, and her position enables her to introduce Endymion to the high society of the Whig party. Myra herself is wooed and won by Lord Roehampton, secretary of state in the Melbourne ministry. This places her in a position to forward Endymion&#x27;s career, and she recommends him for private secretary to the Whig cabinet minister Sidney Wilton, an old friend of her father. Her brother distinguishes himself. In the elections of 1841, however, the Whigs are voted out of office, and Endymion loses his position. He compensates for this by getting elected to parliament in a constituency controlled by the Whig Lord Montfort, whose wife Endymion has befriended.

In Parliament, under the guidance of Lord Roehampton, Endymion&#x27;s makes his mark among the Whig opposition; and when his party returns to power in 1846 he becomes under-secretary of state to Lord Roehampton; when the latter dies of overwork, Endymion resigns rather than serve under his successor. Meanwhile, Prince Florestan, a pretender in exile from his country, whom Endymion knew at Eton, has returned to his country and successfully established himself on his throne. He now offers the widowed Myra (whom he has met at the Neuchatels) the crown as his queen. She accepts. Endymion, devastated at this separation from his sister, finds consolation in the love of Lady Montfort, whose husband has died. Although his party is soon again evicted from government, he is now a prominent member of the out-of-power Whigs, headed by Sidney Wilton; with the fall of the Tory ministry Sidney Wilton becomes Prime Minister, and Endymion his secretary of state; through success in foreign wars and prosperous management of relations with the continent, Endymion makes himself the natural successor to Sidney Wilton. When the latter resigns, Endymion is charged by the queen with the formation of the next government.

==Characters==
The title character&#x27;s name is a reference to the shepherd Endymion of Greek mythology, familiar in 19th-century culture as the title of an 1818 John Keats poem among other references. It is explained in the text as a traditional name of his noble family since the time of Charles the First, and is in fact represented historically among English nobles such as Endymion Porter.

It is very like his own autobiography, with his retrospection of English politics woven into the thread of a story. The action and conversations are distributed between characters who had figured in English politics or the fashionable romance of Europe during the last forty years.
Endymion is Disraeli in his youth. Zenobia, a queen of fashion, is based on his Lady Blessington with a combination of some other great lady. She was Benjamin Disraeli&#x27;s first great patroness, who opened the avenue of his wonderful career. Zenobia later retires to the background to give place to Lady Montfort. She is a combination of Lady Blessington and Mrs. Wyndham Lewis (the latter Disraeli married) so we have in Lady Montfort at once the patroness and the wife.

St Barbe, the journalist in &quot; Endymion &quot; is an intended caricature of Thackeray, and Gushy is Dickens. Vigo, a minor character of the novel, is a combination of Poole, the tailor, and George Hudson, the Sunderland railway king, as he was styled in his time. Prince Florestan is probably a sketch of Louis Napoleon in his early days in England. He is constantly presented as a child of destiny wailing for the European revolution of &#x27;48 to give him back his throne.

Job Thornberry comes into the story with the Anti-Corn-Law League, representing the remarkable change in English politics which made the Whigs so different from what they were fifty years earlier and which necessitated the passage of Reform Bills even by the Conservative Derby-Disraeli ministries. Job Thornberry may be Richard Cobden; for he certainly has much of Cobden&#x27;s subject in him. The energetic and capable minister Lord Roehampton is taken to be Lord Palmerston, and Count Ferrol is perhaps Bismarck. Neuchatel, the great banker, is the historical Rothschild; Cardinal Henry Edward Manning figures as the tendentious papist Nigel Penruddock.

==Themes==
The novel is full of political lessons and conceits, and its pictures of aristocratic circles, with the semi-ministerial management of English affairs by the queens of fashionable society on behalf of their Endymions, not only expose the romance of Disraeli&#x27;s own life, but also reveal the things behind the scenes which, perhaps, none so well could have done as this Jewish ex-premier of England in the literary winding up of his strange eventful life. It is this inner view of Disraeli&#x27;s novel which gives its real significance.

<text>The E-series was a line of inline four-cylinder automobile engines designed and built by Honda for use in their cars in the 1970s and 1980s. These engines were notable for the use of CVCC technology, introduced in the &quot;ED1&quot; engine in the 1975 Civic, which met 1970s emissions standards without using a catalytic converter.

The CVCC &quot;ED1&quot; was on the Ward&#x27;s 10 Best Engines of the 20th century list.

==EA==
:&quot;Also see the Japanese Wikipedia entry&quot;

The EA-series is a water-cooled inline two-cylinder engine replacing the N360&#x27;s air-cooled engine. An SOHC design with a timing belt (replacing the chain used in the N360 engine), the EA was first seen in the 1971 Honda Life. This engine was derived from the air-cooled engine in the Honda CB450 and was adapted for water-cooled application. The displacement was reduced to be in compliance with Japanese kei car legislation that stipulated maximum engine displacement. Bore and stroke were . A version producing at 8,000 rpm was installed in the Honda Life, while the Honda Z and the Honda Life Touring (introduced in May 1972) received a twin-carb model with at a heady 9,000 rpm.

==ER==

The long-stroke ER four-cylinder engine has five crankshaft bearings and an overhead camshaft, driven by a cogged belt.
*It was sold as a 12-valve CVCC-II in Japan and as a simple eight-valve unit in Europe and Asia,
*It was only used in the AA/VF/FA series City/Jazz, from 1981 until 1986.
*It was available as a normally aspirated carburated version or with Honda&#x27;s own PGM-FI fuel injection as one of a very few turbocharged engines built by Honda until the 21st century.
*The Japanese market CVCC engine was also known as COMBAX, an acronym of COMpact Blazing-combustion AXiom. The E-series were tuned for economy, with higher gearing and later on with computer-controlled variable lean burn.
*As of March 1985, the naturally aspirated ER engines gained composite conrods (a world first in a production car), lighter and stronger these helped further reduce fuel consumption.

The lower powered engines in the commercial &quot;City Pro&quot; series had a lower compression, a distributor rather than the distributorless coil pack setup found in the passenger cars, and a manual choke. JIS outputs below are gross figures, while DIN outputs are net.

Carburetor versions used either a single or 2bbl downdraft Keihin. The turbocharger in the Turbo and Turbo II was developed together with IHI, the Turbo II being equipped with an intercooler and a computer-controlled wastegate.

The final E-family engine was the EW, presented along with the all new third generation Honda Civic in September 1983. Displacing , the EWs were SOHC 12-valve engines. Early 3 barrel EW1s produced from and . The fuel injected EW3 and EW4 produced at 5,500 rpm and at 4,500 rpm. The &quot;EW&quot; name was replaced by the Honda D15 series, with the EW (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) renamed to D15A (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) in 1987. It also received a new engine stamp placement on the front of the engine like the &quot;modern D series&quot; (1988+).

A third throttle plate in the throttle body supplied intake air to a 5th injector which powered the CVCC ports, The rated power is different between the Civic and the CR-X: the Civic makes at 5800 rpm and torque at 4000 rpm, the CR-X made at 5800 rpm and torque at 4500 rpm. Differences in power are largely down to a more efficient exhaust system on the CR-X it used a factory cast iron 4-2-1 extractor went through a catalytic converter further down the exhaust system and had twin exit tail pipes. The Civic had a short 4-1 design into a catalytic converter and single pipe exit. There was a revised intake manifold for vehicles produced in 1986 and 1987. The EW5 was only available in Japan. It came in the following models: CR-X 1.5i, Civic 25i Hatchback, Ballade CRi Sedan.

==ZA==
The ZA1 and ZA2 are anomalously named, but closely related to the 1.3-litre EV. With a shorter stroke but the same bore , this shared most of the EV&#x27;s characteristics. It was only sold in the third generation Civic in European and various smaller markets where the taxation structure suited this version. The high octane version produces at 6000 rpm and at 4000 rpm. There was also a low-octane model, producing at 6000 rpm.

<doc id="1312512" wikidata="Q4871527" url="?curid=1312512" title="Battle of Lake Okeechobee">
<text>The Battle of Lake Okeechobee was one of the major battles of the Seminole Wars. It was fought between 1,000 U.S. Army troops of the 1st, 4th, and 6th Infantry Regiments and 132 Missouri Volunteers under the command of Colonel Zachary Taylor, and about 400 Seminole warriors led by chiefs Abiaka, Billy Bowlegs, and Wild Cat on 25 December 1837. The Seminoles defended their large encampment by Lake Okeechobee against an attack by Zachary Taylor&#x27;s troops. Zachary Taylor&#x27;s march to Lake Okeechobee was part of a larger offensive into South Florida that was planned by General Thomas Jesup. The battle was a victory for the Seminoles, as they held off the U.S. troops long enough to safely evacuate their encampment. Due to the large number of casualties his troops suffered (especially among the officers), Zachary Taylor was forced to end his offensive into South Florida, and he marched his army over 100 miles back to Tampa Bay.

==Background==
Major General Thomas Jesup was placed in command of the war in Florida in December 1836. In late 1837, Jesup planned a major offensive into Southern Florida to finally defeat and remove the Seminoles from Florida. In November, four U.S. Military columns started sweeping down the peninsula. One column led by Levin M. Powell moved down the east coast from the Mosquito Inlet along the Indian River. A second column led by Jesup himself moved south along the St. Johns River. A third column crossed from Tampa to the Kissimmee River and then proceeded down the river to Lake Okeechobee. The fourth column moved up the Caloosahatchee River. Colonel Taylor was in charge of the third column. Jesup ordered him to set up a depot somewhere near the Peace River.

Taylor built Fort Gardner (near Lake Tohopekaliga) on the Kissimmee River. On December 19, Taylor left Fort Gardiner with more than 1,000 men, marching down south along the Kissimmee towards Lake Okeechobee. As a number of Seminoles surrendered to Taylor&#x27;s column, he stopped to build Fort Basinger, and left prisoners, guards, and sick men there. During the march, Taylor&#x27;s scouts reported that there was a very large gathering of 2,000 Seminoles (men, women, and children) led by Chief Abiaka on the northern shore of Lake Okeechobee. Lieutenant Robert C. Buchanan wrote in his diary two days before the battle that he hoped that the United States could defeat the Seminoles &quot;in one blow&quot; by catching Abiaka.

== Events of the battle ==
Taylor&#x27;s army came up to a large hammock with half a mile of swamp in front of it. On the far side of the hammock was Lake Okeechobee. Here the saw grass stood five feet high. The mud and water were three feet deep. Horses would be of no use. It was obvious that the Seminole meant this to be the battleground. They had cut the grass in front of their position to provide an open field of fire, and had notched the trees to steady their rifles. Their scouts were perched in the treetops to follow every movement of the troops coming up. In his diary, Lieutenant Robert C. Buchanan said that the Seminole warriors were placed in &quot;the strongest position that I have ever seen in Florida&quot;. The Seminoles had also placed canoes on the lake shore near their encampment to prepare for their evacuation.

At about half past noon, the sun shining directly overhead and the air still and quiet, Taylor moved his troops squarely into the center of the swamp. His plan was to make a direct attack rather than encircle the Indians. All his men were on foot. In the first line were the 132 Missouri volunteers. As soon as they came within range, the Indians opened with heavy fire. The Missourians suffered heavy casualties, and their commander, Richard Gentry, was fatally wounded leading them. Despite his wounds, he managed to lead them for an hour before collapsing. To escape the kill zone in the swamp, the Missourians pushed into the hammock. The Indians then mounted a counterattack on the remaining soldiers. In the deadly assault some of the soldiers were scalped by the Indians. Gentry had suggested to Taylor before the battle an encirclement strategy which Taylor rejected, charging that Gentry was afraid of a direct confrontation. This could have motivated Gentry to keep charging the Seminole positions even though the original battle plan had the militia retreating at the first sign of enemy fire to re-form behind the regular army lines.

As a result of the additional casualties induced by the continued charge, the Missourians lost cohesion, but continued fighting. The fighting in the saw grass was deadliest for five companies of the Sixth Infantry; every officer but one, and most of their noncommissioned officers were killed or wounded. When that part of the regiment retired a short distance to re-form, they found only four men of these companies unharmed. The 6th Infantry&#x27;s commander, Lieutenant Colonel Alexander R. Thompson, was among the dead. Lieutenant William H.T. Walker, later a general in the Confederate Army, was wounded in the neck, shoulder, chest, left arm, and also his leg during the battle. Lieutenant Frank Brooke, the nephew of Virginia Governor Robert Brooke, was also among the dead. Lieutenant Robert C. Buchanan (who was also wounded) wrote in his diary after the battle that &quot;A sad Christmas has this been; for us and our friends.&quot;

26 U.S. soldiers, including the majority of Taylor&#x27;s officers and NCOs, were killed, with 112 wounded, against 11 Seminoles killed and 14 wounded. The Seminole warriors had specifically targeted the U.S. military officers during the battle. The battle stopped Taylor&#x27;s troops from further advancing south and no Seminoles were captured, although Taylor&#x27;s scouts did capture 100 ponies and 600 head of cattle the day after the battle. In guerrilla warfare fashion, the Seminole warriors had successfully held off the U.S. troops long enough for their people to evacuate their encampment, and they then withdrew across Lake Okeechobee on their canoes. Due to the large number of casualties that Zachary Taylor&#x27;s army suffered, they were forced to retreat over 100 miles back to Tampa.

Years later in 1852, Seminole chief Holata Micco (also known as Billy Bowlegs) visited Washington and on being escorted through the buildings of the Capitol and viewing many statues and paintings, he suddenly halted before a portrait of Zachary Taylor, grinned and exclaimed: &quot;Me whip!&quot; (I beat him!). There are now over four thriving Seminole Indian reservations located in south Florida, one of which is in Okeechobee County (the location of the battle).

==Battlefield endangered==

The National Trust for Historic Preservation named the site on a list of &quot;America&#x27;s Most Endangered Historic Places 2000&quot;. The state of Florida spent $3.2 million for a park. An annual battle reenactment is held to raise money for the State park.

Archaeological investigations carried out at the park by the U.S. National Park Service in 2015 failed to locate any evidence of the 1837 battle. The exact location of the fighting remains unknown.

<doc id="1312515" wikidata="Q1224521" url="?curid=1312515" title="Diffusion-limited aggregation">
<text>Diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA) is the process whereby particles undergoing a random walk due to Brownian motion cluster together to form aggregates of such particles. This theory, proposed by T.A. Witten Jr. and L.M. Sander in 1981, is applicable to aggregation in any system where diffusion is the primary means of transport in the system. DLA can be observed in many systems such as electrodeposition, Hele-Shaw flow, mineral deposits, and dielectric breakdown.

The clusters formed in DLA processes are referred to as [[Diffusion-limited aggregation|Brownian trees]]. These clusters are an example of a fractal. In 2D these fractals exhibit a dimension of approximately 1.71 for free particles that are unrestricted by a lattice, however computer simulation of DLA on a lattice will change the fractal dimension slightly for a DLA in the same embedding dimension. Some variations are also observed depending on the geometry of the growth, whether it be from a single point radially outward or from a plane or line for example. Two examples of aggregates generated using a microcomputer by allowing random walkers to adhere to an aggregate (originally (i) a straight line consisting of 1300 particles and (ii) one particle at center) are shown on the right.

Computer simulation of DLA is one of the primary means of studying this model. Several methods are available to accomplish this. Simulations can be done on a lattice of any desired geometry of embedding dimension (this has been done in up to 8 dimensions) or the simulation can be done more along the lines of a standard molecular dynamics simulation where a particle is allowed to freely random walk until it gets within a certain critical range whereupon it is pulled onto the cluster. Of critical importance is that the number of particles undergoing Brownian motion in the system is kept very low so that only the diffusive nature of the system is present.

== Brownian tree ==


A Brownian tree, whose name is derived from Robert Brown via Brownian motion, is a form of computer art that was briefly popular in the 1990s, when home computers started to have sufficient power to simulate Brownian motion. Brownian trees are mathematical models of dendritic structures associated with the physical process known as diffusion-limited aggregation.

A Brownian tree is built with these steps: first, a &quot;seed&quot; is placed somewhere on the screen. Then, a particle is placed in a random position of the screen, and moved randomly until it bumps against the seed. The particle is left there, and another particle is placed in a random position and moved until it bumps against the seed or any previous particle, and so on.

===Factors===
The resulting tree can have many different shapes, depending on principally three factors:

* the seed position
* the initial particle position (anywhere on the screen, from a circle surrounding the seed, from the top of the screen, etc.)
* the moving algorithm (usually random, but for example a particle can be deleted if it goes too far from the seed, etc.)

Particle color can change between iterations, giving interesting effects.

At the time of their popularity (helped by a &quot;Scientific American&quot; article in the Computer Recreations section, December 1988), a common computer took hours, and even days, to generate a small tree. Today&#x27;s computers can generate trees with tens of thousands of particles in minutes or seconds.

These trees can also be grown easily in an electrodeposition cell, and are the direct result of diffusion-limited aggregation.

== Artwork based on diffusion-limited aggregation ==
The intricate and organic forms that can be generated with diffusion-limited aggregation algorithms have been explored by artists. Simutils, part of the toxiclibs open source library for the Java programming language developed by Karsten Schmidt, allows users to apply the DLA process to pre-defined guidelines or curves in the simulation space and via various other parameters dynamically direct the growth of 3D forms.

<doc id="1312516" wikidata="Q3274071" url="?curid=1312516" title="Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation">
<text>The Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation (SLBC) (, &quot;Shrī Lankā Guvan Viduli Sansthāva&quot;, , &quot;Ilangkai Oliparappuk Kūṭṭuttāpaṉam&quot;) came into existence on 5 January 1967 when Radio Ceylon became a public corporation. Dudley Senanayake who was the Prime Minister of Ceylon in 1967 ceremonially opened the newly established Ceylon Broadcasting Corporation along with Minister Ranasinghe Premadasa and the Director-General of the CBC, Neville Jayaweera. The first board of Directors of CBC consisted of Mr Neville Jayaweera (CCS), Mr A. L. M. Hashim, Mr Dharmasiri Kuruppu, Mr K.A.G. Perera and Mr Devar Surya Sena. After the first board meeting, it was decided unanimously to appoint the chairman, Mr Jayaweera, as the new Director-General.

==Radio Ceylon==
The Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation (SLBC), formerly Radio Ceylon, is the oldest radio station in Asia, and was founded as Colombo Radio in 1925. Edward Harper who was then the &quot;Chief Engineer&quot; at the Telegraph Department in 1921, was the first person who initiated experimental broadcasts in Ceylon. The first-ever broadcast on an experimental basis took place in 1923. Gramophone music was played from the Ceylon Telegraph Office with the aid of a transmitter built by engineers of the Telegraph Department. The transmitter was built using radio equipment from a captured German submarine. Ceylon began a broadcasting service three years after the launching of broadcasting services in Europe.

Edward Harper who is known as the&quot; &#x27;Father of Broadcasting in Ceylon&quot;&#x27; founded the Ceylon Wireless Club together with British and Sri Lankan radio enthusiasts. Sir Hugh Clifford, the British Governor, spoke to the nation on Colombo Radio for the first time on 16 December 1925. This was a historic occasion. The advent of broadcasting in Sri Lanka places the country alongside Great Britain, the United States of America and Germany, in terms of international broadcasting history.

==Radio SEAC==
During World War II, the Allied Forces took over radio operations in Colombo and Radio Seac was born. Colombo based (British) announcers, David Jacobs and Desmond Carrington (who joined the BBC after the war) were among those who presented the news and radio programs for the Allied Forces across South-East Asia. When the war was over, Radio Seac was handed back to the Government of Ceylon. This was when the name was changed to &quot;Radio Ceylon&quot;. The name change heralded a new chapter in broadcasting in South Asia.

==Radio Ceylon==
Radio Ceylon enjoyed the status &#x27;King of the airwaves&#x27; of South Asia in the 1950s and 1960s. Millions of listeners tuned into the radio broadcasts. This was the golden era of Radio Ceylon. Clifford Dodd, an administrator from Australia was brought in under the Colombo Plan. It was Dodd who founded the &quot;Commercial Service of Radio Ceylon&quot; which was very successful.

Radio Ceylon and the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation produced some of the finest announcers and presenters in the world. Among them are Livy Wijemanne, Vernon Corea, Pearl Ondaatje, Greg Roskowski, Tim Horshington, Claude Selveratnam, Jimmy Bharucha, Thevis Guruge, Chitrananda Abeysekera, A.W. Dharmapala, Karunaratne Abeysekera, H.M. Gunasekera, S.P. Mylvaganam, Gnanam Rathinam, Nihal Bhareti, Leon Belleth, k. mylavaganam and Vijaya Corea Mark Anthony Fernando to name some.

==80 Years of Broadcasting==
In 2005 the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation celebrated 80 years in the world of broadcasting. This was a historic landmark where broadcasting was concerned a very important chapter for communication in Sri Lanka.

==40 Years as a Public Corporation==
In 2007 the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation celebrated 40 years as a public broadcasting corporation. With the incorporation in 1967 came the name change to Ceylon Broadcasting Corporation. When the country became a republic in 1972 the station came to be known as the &quot;Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation&quot;.

==Re-Launch of the English Commercial Service==
The Chairman of the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation, Hudson Samarasinghe, took the decision in 2008 to re-launch the English Commercial Service. Back in the 1950s and 1960s the Commercial Service of Radio Ceylon was a brand leader and helped the station to rule the airwaves in South Asia. The re-launch commenced on 1 September 2008. The SLBC had earlier allocated more time to BBC regular programmes. More entertainment programmes have been added to the re-vamped English Commercial Service with a view to grabbing a market share of listeners on the island and across the Indian sub-continent.

<doc id="1312518" wikidata="Q1535715" url="?curid=1312518" title="The Manhattans">
<text>The Manhattans are an American R&amp;B vocal group. Their songs &quot;Kiss and Say Goodbye&quot;, recorded in 1976, and 1980&#x27;s &quot;Shining Star&quot;, both sold millions of copies. The Manhattans have recorded 45 hits on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B Chart, including twelve top-10 R&amp;B hits in the United States, starting in 1965. Sixteen of their songs have reached the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, including two top 10s and a number-one hit with their song &quot;Kiss and Say Goodbye&quot;. They also charted eight U.S. R&amp;B top 20 Albums, three of which were RIAA certified gold. The Manhattans were inducted into The Atlantic City Walk of Fame in September 2024.

== Early history ==
The Manhattans, originally from Jersey City, New Jersey, formed in 1962 with members George &quot;Smitty&quot; Smith (December 28, 1939 – December 16, 1970), Edward &quot;Sonny&quot; Bivins (January 15, 1936 – December 3, 2014), Winfred &quot;Blue&quot; Lovett (November 16, 1936 – December 9, 2014), Kenny &quot;Wally&quot; Kelly (January 9, 1941 – February 17, 2015), and Richard &quot;Ricky&quot; Taylor (1940 – December 7, 1987). Bivins, Lovett, and Kelly graduated from Lincoln High School, while Taylor and Smith graduated from Snyder High School. All five enlisted in the armed forces and came together as a group following their discharges from their respective branches.

The group&#x27;s first single was &quot;For the Very First Time&quot;, released in 1964 by Carnival Records. The Manhattans continued recording successfully with songs written by various members of the group. In 1968, the group received the &quot;Most Promising Group&quot; award by NATRA (the National Association of Television and Radio Announcers). In 1969, the group moved to the De Luxe record label, a subsidiary of King Records, and subsequently embarked on a college tour. While playing at Kittrell College in North Carolina, the group met another group, the New Imperials, featuring Gerald Alston, nephew of The Shirelles&#x27; lead singer, Shirley Alston-Reeves. They were so impressed with Alston that they asked him to join the group, but he declined.

Misfortune hit the group late in 1970 when Smith fell ill. The value of this dynamic lead singer can neither be undervalued nor forgotten, with songs such as &quot;I&#x27;m the One Love Forgot&quot; and others that first established the group&#x27;s popularity. With Smith unable to perform, the group began to search for a new lead. First they attempted to woo The Cymbals&#x27; lead, Lee Williams, but he was unwilling to leave his current group. The group then renewed their request to Gerald Alston (born November 8, 1951), who accepted and took over the lead spot. Smith died of a brain tumor on December 16, 1970, 12 days before his 31st birthday.

The Manhattans continued recording throughout the 1970s with Alston singing lead vocals. They struck chart gold in 1973 with the Bivins-written song &quot;There&#x27;s No Me Without You&quot;. Then their biggest song was their March 1976 release &quot;Kiss and Say Goodbye&quot;, written by Blue Lovett and arranged/co-produced with the group by the Philadelphia-based record producer Bobby Martin, a former member of the MFSB band of session musicians. The song quickly became a number-1 chart-topper on both the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop and R&amp;B charts. It also became the second ever single to go platinum, after the RIAA introduced that certification level in 1976. Taylor left in 1976 to concentrate on his conversion to Islam. He died in 1987 after a long illness.

The group continued as a quartet, and found further success in March 1980 with the release of &quot;Shining Star&quot;, which reached number 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and number 4 on the R&amp;B Chart. Produced and co-written by the Chicago-based record producer, Leo Graham, it received a Grammy Award the following spring.

In 1983, The Manhattans released the album &quot;Forever by Your Side&quot;, by Columbia Records, which had two singles that year. The first was the song &quot;Crazy&quot;, the great success of this album, peaked at number 4 on the R&amp;B chart. The second single was the title track &quot;Forever by Your Side&quot;, which had moderate success in the United States, peaked at number 30 on the R&amp;B chart, but has become a great success and a romantic classic in Brazil two years later, when it was included as part of the soundtrack of a soap opera in the country. The success led to a Portuguese version the following year, called &quot;Pra Sempre Vou Te Amar&quot;, which also was successful in Brazil, and has been recorded by several Brazilian artists. Another highlight of this album &quot;Forever by Your Side&quot; was the song &quot;Just the Lonely Talking Again&quot;, written by the American singer and songwriter Sam Dees, which was originally recorded by The Manhattans for this 1983 album and was later re-recorded by Whitney Houston on her second studio album, &quot;Whitney&quot;, in 1987.

The group celebrated its 20th anniversary in 1985 with the release of &quot;Too Hot to Stop It&quot;. It included the Evans/Smith-penned &quot;When We&#x27;re Made as One&quot;, originally recorded in 1966 but covered in an a cappella, doo wop style to emphasize the group&#x27;s doo wop roots. The album was also dedicated to George Smith.

The group continued until 1988. That year, Alston left to record as a solo artist, scoring with several major R&amp;B hits in the late 1980s and early 1990s for Motown. Roger Harris was recruited as the new lead singer for the group, which moved to the new label, Valley Vue, when their Columbia recording contract expired.

== Later history ==
The group&#x27;s largest shake-up was in December 1990, when Blue Lovett left the group, upon his doctor&#x27;s request, for health reasons. Kenny Kelly left to return to college to pursue his PhD. Bivins continued along with lead singer Roger Harris who had replaced Gerald Alston in 1988–89 along with new members. He recruited new members Charles Hardy and Harsey Hemphill, who in October 1990 had auditioned for Bivins but didn&#x27;t come aboard until after Lovett and Kelly left at the end of 1990. In early 1991 Bivins added Alvin Pazant, bringing the group back to a quintet. Harris proved to be only a short-term lead, and in April 1991 he was replaced by Wade Taylor. Taylor was replaced in July 1991 when Bivins recruited Lee Williams, the person whom they had originally wanted to replace George Smith.

In the 2000s, there were two versions of The Manhattans. One version featured original founding member Bivins, plus Hardy, Hemphill, Pazant and Williams. They released the CD &quot;Manhattans Now&quot; in 1994. In 1996, the group formed their own full-service music corporation company called Manhattan Entertainment Inc. In 2003 and 2007, they were featured artists in two theater plays, &quot;Girl He Aint Worth It&quot; and &quot;The Chicken Shack&quot;. In June 2013, the group released a single called &quot;Just for Tonite&quot; written by Bivins and Pazant and produced and arranged by Leroy Burgess. In 2015, Lee Williams retired and was replaced by Keni Jackson as the new lead singer. And they still continue to perform, with the same line up in 2018.

The other version of The Manhattans featured original member Blue Lovett, plus Gerald Alston, the lead singer on the group&#x27;s biggest hits. Other members include Troy May and David Tyson (died 2022), brother of The Temptations&#x27; Ron Tyson. In the past, the group also featured Eban Brown, who later spent 18 years as lead vocalist for The Stylistics. This group has also released some CDs, including &quot;Even Now&quot;. This version of the group was featured in two PBS specials and performed at casinos and theaters across the United States. Alston appeared on Wu-Tang Clan&#x27;s album, &quot;8 Diagrams&quot;, on the song &quot;Stick Me for My Riches&quot; in 2007.

Edward &quot;Sonny&quot; Bivins, founding member of the Manhattans, died on December 3, 2014, at the age of 78. He sang on every Manhattans hit since the group&#x27;s inception, and wrote many of their hit songs. He led the Manhattans up until his death.

Winfred &quot;Blue&quot; Lovett, the group&#x27;s original bass singer and songwriter, died on December 9, 2014, at the age of 78. His bass voice was heard on many Manhattans hits, including the spoken word intro to &quot;Kiss and Say Goodbye&quot;. He was replaced by Gerald Alston&#x27;s cousin, Dwight Fields in The Manhattans featuring Gerald Alston till his death on August 26, 2016.

Kenneth &quot;Wally&quot; Kelly, the last surviving original member of the group, died on February 17, 2015, at the age of 74.

Lead singer Gerald Alston is the only member alive of the group&#x27;s heyday lineup.

David Tyson, a member of The Manhattans featuring Gerald Alston died of an illness on February 17, 2022, at the age of 62.

On September 23, 2024, The National R&amp;B Music Society inducted The Manhattans into The Atlantic City Walk of Fame. Gerald Alston, Edward &quot;Sonny&quot; Bivins, Winfred &quot;Blue&quot; Lovett, Kenneth Kelly, Richard Taylor and George Smith were the indutees. Gerald Alston was in attendance to accept the honor. Blue Lovett&#x27;s widow Anna, and daughter, and Sonny Bivins son Mark, and daughter Pamela were also in attendance.

<doc id="1312531" wikidata="Q1068642" url="?curid=1312531" title="Jazz (Transformers)">
<text>Jazz is a fictional robot character from the Transformers franchise. He is usually portrayed as a music-loving Autobot who speaks Black Vernacular English. In certain continuities he is shown as Optimus Prime&#x27;s good friend and right-hand man.

==&quot;Transformers: Generation 1&quot;==
Jazz (Tigre in Italy) is the &quot;very cool, very stylish, very competent&quot; member of the Autobots in the &quot;Transformers&quot; television and comic series based on the popular toy line produced by Takara and Hasbro. His original vehicle mode is a Martini Porsche 935 turbo racing car. Jazz serves as the first lieutenant of the Autobots, as well as the head of Special Operations. He has his own dedicated roster of agents and often assigns the most dangerous tasks to himself. A cool-headed improviser, he adapts to any environment and makes creative command decisions.

===Animated series===
====&quot;The Transformers&quot;====
Jazz was among the Autobots who followed Optimus Prime on his mission aboard the &quot;Ark&quot;. They were attacked by Megatron&#x27;s ship, the &quot;Nemesis&quot;, and crash landed on Earth, where all on board were preserved in emergency stasis. Four million years later, in 1984, a volcanic eruption awakened the &quot;Ark&quot;&#x27;s computer, Teletran-I, and it repaired all on board. It reformatted Jazz in the form of an Earth race car. Jazz then became a regular character throughout the show&#x27;s first two seasons serving as Optimus Prime&#x27;s second-in-command (Ironhide and Prowl seemed to share this role with him though).

Towards the end of 1985, Jazz was among the team of five Autobots who disguised themselves as the Stunticons in &quot;Masquerade&quot;. Jazz, a Porsche 935 turbo, was made to resemble Dead End, the Stunticon Porsche 928. Penetrating the Decepticons&#x27; camp, the Autobots ran into trouble when the real Stunticon team arrived; trying to prove their identities by forming Menasor. With a combination of Windcharger&#x27;s magnetic powers and Mirage&#x27;s illusion-creating ability, the Autobots were able to appear as Menasor as well. Though the deception was soon revealed, they were still able to thwart the Decepticons&#x27; plans.

In &quot;The Transformers: The Movie&quot;, set in the year 2005, Jazz was assigned to &quot;Moonbase One&quot; along with Cliffjumper. Jazz was responsible for monitoring Decepticon activity on Cybertron using the base as a secret staging ground for planning the liberation of Cybertron. After the Autobot City invasion of Earth, Moonbase One came under attack by the planet eater, Unicron. Jazz radioed to Earth for assistance and his faint signal was received by Blaster who relayed the distress signal to Ultra Magnus. Jazz and Cliffjumper attempted to escape; however, the shuttle could not achieve escape velocity and was swallowed by Unicron. During the assault on Unicron led by Hot Rod and Ultra Magnus, Daniel Witwicky encountered a smelting pit inside Unicron, where other Transformer-like beings were being sent to be melted into a liquid substance. Jazz, Cliffjumper, Bumblebee and Spike were about to be cast into the pit but Daniel managed to rescue them in the nick of time. Jazz and the others escaped Unicron before the planet-sized Transformer exploded from the effects of the Autobot Matrix.

Shortly after the film&#x27;s release, Jazz&#x27;s principal voice actor, Scatman Crothers, died. The movie release was the last time that Jazz spoke. However, Jazz made minor cameos throughout the third season of the TV series in the episodes &quot;Five Faces of Darkness&quot; where he competed in a race and won, and fought alongside Perceptor and Rodimus Prime. In the episode &quot;Dark Awakening&quot;, he briefly stood beside the resurrected Optimus Prime and in the episode &quot;Call of the Primitives&quot;, he was seen for the final time. Jazz reappears in Generation 2: Redux, as Botcon magazine which is set after the events of the final episode where he, along with Goldbug, Sideswipe, Beachcomber and Seaspray battling the Decepticons in Switzerland and gained new powers and color like his G2 self by the power of Forestonite.

After the animated series ended in the U.S., Jazz appeared in animated form in the commercials for the Classic Pretenders, Action Masters, and Hot Rod Patrol.

====&quot;Transformers: The Headmasters&quot;====
In the Japanese series, &quot;Headmasters&quot; (the official fourth season of &quot;The Transformers&quot; in Japan), Jazz reappeared with a certain regularity in the first episodes, acting as right hand of Optimus Prime until the latter&#x27;s death. In episode 4, he was operating inside Metroplex alongside Ultra Magnus, and after Trypticon and Mad Machine defeated Metroplex, he received the task to repair the computer of the Autobot mobile base.

===Books===
Jazz was featured in the 1985 Find Your Fate Junior book called &quot;Vanishing Drive&quot; by Barbara Siegel and Scott Siegel.

Jazz was featured in the 1985 Transformers audio books &quot;Autobots&#x27; Lightning Strike&quot; and &quot;Autobots Fight Back&quot; by John Grant, published by Ladybird Books.

Jazz was featured in the 1993 &quot;Transformers: Generation 2&quot; coloring book &quot;Decepticon Madness&quot; by Bud Simpson.

===Comics===
====Condor Verlag====
In a story called &quot;By their Blasters you shall know them ...!&quot; from &quot;Transformers Comic-Magazine&quot; issue #12 by German comic publisher Condor Verlag. Optimus Prime instructs Backstreet, Bumblebee and Ruckus on how to identify Autobots from Decepticons in battle using the Ark&#x27;s computer. Pretender Jazz is one of those he displays to the Autobots.

====Devil&#x27;s Due Publishing====
In this reimagining of the Generation One story, the &quot;Ark&quot; was discovered by the terrorist Cobra Organization, and all the Transformers inside were reformatted into Cobra vehicles remotely controlled by the Televipers. In this storyline Jazz turned into a Cobra S.T.U.N.. In the sequel, he ended up being warped to the 1970s, where he was automatically reformatted into a pimpmobile.

====Dreamwave Productions====
In 2002, Jazz returned along with his fellow Autobots when Dreamwave Productions acquired the Transformers comic license and launched a brand-new continuity.

When civil war broke out on the planet Cybertron between the Autobots and Decepticon factions, Jazz joined the Autobot cause. After Decepticon leader Megatron killed the Autobot leader Sentinel Prime, a new Autobot leader was chosen by the Council of the Ancients. Jazz was present when Optronix was given the Matrix and reformatted into Optimus Prime. Three Decepticon assassins attempted to kill Optimus, but were unsuccessful. Optimus then ordered a planet-wide evacuation of Cybertron (&quot;&quot; #1). When Shockwave led a force of Decepticons against the Autobot capitol of Iacon, Jazz was among the Autobots who defended the capitol (&quot;War Within&quot; #3).

When Megatron and Optimus Prime disappeared in an accident with a Space Bridge, the Autobot and Decepticon forces splintered into smaller factions. Jazz stayed with the Autobots under the leadership of Prowl. Learning that the Decepticons were testing a new mobile command base at the Praetorus Wharf, Prowl lead Cliffjumper, Gears, Jazz, Skids and Sideswipe to investigate. What they discovered was Trypticon (&quot;Transformers: The War Within - The Dark Ages&quot; #3). Only Shockwave calling the giant away to combat the Fallen saved them. When the Fallen attacked the Autobot base in order to capture Blitzwing, Jazz was among the Autobots who futilely tried to stop him.

Jazz was among the Autobots who followed Optimus Prime on his mission on board the &quot;Ark&quot;. They were attacked by Megatron&#x27;s ship, the &quot;Nemesis&quot; and crash landed on Earth, where all on board were preserved in emergency stasis. In 1984, a volcanic eruption awakened the Ark&#x27;s computer, Teletran-1, and it repaired all on board. It reformatted Jazz in the form of an Earth car.

Eventually, the combined forces of the Autobots on Earth and their human allies were able to capture the Decepticons. A ship called the &quot;Ark II&quot; was built to take the Cybertronians back to Cybertron, along with some human companions, but the ship exploded shortly after takeoff. The human allies were killed, but the Cybertronians were lost in the ocean, again in stasis lock.

In the frozen Arctic, a man named Lazarus began resurrecting the lost Transformers and planned to control these giant metal warriors and sell their services in war to the highest bidder. The American government had recovered Optimus Prime and used him to rescue several Autobots from their Arctic prison, including Jazz. After they had recovered their friends from Lazarus, Jazz led a group of Autobots to stop the spread of Megatron&#x27;s deadly virus in the Canadian Northwest territories.

As the Autobot and Decepticon war continued on Earth, an escape pod beacon drew their conflict to the Arctic. The pod contained the rogue Decepticon Scourge. The battle between the Autobots and Decepticons ceased long enough to find the new Cybertronian commander, Shockwave, had arrived in pursuit of Scourge and to arrest Optimus Prime and Megatron. Jazz was ordered by Prime to remain on Earth with a small Autobot task force.

When Ultra Magnus came to Earth claiming that the Earth-based Autobots were Cybertronian criminals, Optimus Prime surrendered and with the majority of Autobots returned to Cybertron. Jazz was left in charge of the &quot;Ark&quot;, with Brawn, Ratchet, Sideswipe, Sunstreaker, Wheeljack and Windcharger assigned to him.

Returning to Earth with the Combaticons, Starscream reformatted them into Earth-style vehicles and attacked the Autobots remaining on Earth. Forming Bruticus, the Combaticons defeated Jazz, Sideswipe, Sunstreaker, Wheeljack and Windcharger. Only Ratchet and Brawn escaped capture, but as they made their way back to the &quot;Ark&quot;, they discovered its defenses on automatic, and had to fight their way inside. Bruticus followed them and Ratchet had to destroy the &quot;Ark&quot; in failed attempt to destroy Bruticus. Starscream eventually captured Ratchet and Brawn, right as an Autobot shuttle and Sunstorm arrived on Earth (&quot;Transformers: Generation One&quot; vol. III #1).

Jazz, Sideswipe and Sunstreaker were repaired by the Earth Defense Command. In return, Jazz commanded Sunstreaker, Sideswipe and Bumper in investigating the Insecticons for the Earth Defense Command. Eventually they rejoined Windcharger and Wheeljack, and all rejoined Ratchet on board the Autobot ship &quot;Orion&quot; (&quot;Transformers: Generation One&quot; vol. III #9).

Landing in Alaska, Jazz and the other Autobots met Prowl&#x27;s team back from Cybertron. They were shown the site of construction for the new Autobot City (&quot;Transformers: Generation One&quot; vol. III #10). Brawn, Grapple, Hoist, Jazz, Omega Supreme, Prowl, Red Alert, Sideswipe and Sunstreaker were among the Autobots who continued work on Autobot City (&quot;Transformers: Generation One&quot; vol. III #13).

====Fun Publications====
In &quot;Battle Lines&quot;, Jazz was present as Optimus Prime was appointed the new commander of the Autobots. Jazz is among the Autobots present when Megatron attacks Iacon with his new weapon, Devastator.

Jazz appears in the story &quot;Generation 2: Redux&quot; where he is among the reinforcements from Autobot City to respond to the Decepticon attack at the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland. Once there the Autobots are able to defeat the Decepticons, but during the fight the Autobots are exposed to refined Forestonite, which enhances and mutates Cybertronian systems. He gets enhanced to his &quot;Generation 2&quot; form.

In &quot;Invasion&quot;, Jazz is among the Autobots at the Autobot Ironworks base who is wounded in battle with &quot;Shattered Glass&quot; Ultra Magnus.

====IDW Publishing====
Jazz appeared in issue #2 of &quot;Megatron Origin&quot;. In this story, set on ancient Cybertron he was a member of an Autobot security force in the city of Kaon. His squad was hunting the operators of gladiatorial contests in the degenerate slums, particularly Megatron.

In IDW Publishing&#x27;s &quot;The Transformers: Infiltration&quot; mini-series, Jazz is part of an infiltration unit consisting of Ratchet, Ironhide, Wheeljack, Bumblebee and Sunstreaker, led by Prowl. He has not played a major role thus far, other than to accompany the other Autobots to the Decepticon base to watch the duel between Megatron and a super-powered Starscream, saving Bumblebee from Runabout at one point.

In the follow-up series, &quot;The Transformers: Escalation&quot;, after the supposed demise of Sunstreaker, Jazz and Wheeljack tracked down his body—only to be temporarily disabled by the advanced weaponry of the Machination (although Jazz&#x27; pride took more of a dent). Since then he has accompanied Optimus Prime to Brasnya to track down Megatron and his human facsimile—only to wind up in battle with Skywarp and Astrotrain. He and Wheeljack managed to put Skywarp to flight, but he promised to return with reinforcements. They then confronted Megatron (who had nearly killed Optimus Prime). On Prime&#x27;s orders, they focused fire on Megatron long enough for Prime to recover and drive off the Decepticon leader, although they were prevented from dealing a killing blow by the appearance of Skywarp and Thundercracker.

Bumblebee, Jazz, Optimus Prime, Prowl and Ratchet are in the miniseries &quot;New Avengers/Transformers&quot; crossover by Marvel Comics and IDW Publishing from 2007.

====Marvel Comics====
In the early Marvel Comics, Jazz was portrayed easily and productively making contact with humans. He was also responsible for the long-standing relationship between the Autobots and G. B. Blackrock, pledging that the Autobots would defend his property from the Decepticons in return for fuel, and battled Circuit Breaker.

Marvel U.K.&#x27;s &quot;Man of Iron&quot; saw him befriending (as well as abducting) a young boy in rural England, helping the Autobots locate a lost ship under Stansham Castle; Jazz personally destroyed it to stop the Decepticons retrieving it.

Jazz passionately opposed Prowl&#x27;s idea to use the Creation Matrix to create dedicated war machines to crush the Decepticons; he labeled such creations &quot;abominations&quot;. This ethically questionable move was staved off and Jazz continued to serve the Autobots well on Earth. Following the arrival of Galvatron in &quot;&quot;, he was captured, and his mind viciously reprogrammed to make him a zombie servant. This left him incapacitated for a long while. He was eventually repaired, but soon met deactivation once more against the Underbase-powered Starscream.

Jazz&#x27; body was seen among the deactivated Autobots Ratchet was doing his best to revive in &quot;Transformers&quot; #56, &quot;Back from the Dead&quot;.

To stop Megatron, Autobot medic Ratchet later restored Jazz as a Classic Pretender, along with Grimlock and Bumblebee. They remained on Cybertron and were an inspiration to the Autobot rebels, leading multiple raids on the Decepticons and also fighting several of the demons that lived beneath Cybertron. When a return trip to Earth was interrupted, the Classic Pretenders found themselves in front of the sleeping Primus and, after battling the Mayhem Attack Squad, witnessed him awaken. Jazz would go on a last mission as a Classic Pretender in the &quot;Matrix Quest&quot;, heading to the moon of VsQs to retrieve the lost Matrix, though Thunderwing got to it first. He was later among the united Autobot and Decepticon forces who opposed Unicron&#x27;s assault on the planet Cybertron in 1995 (&quot;Transformers&quot; #75). Immediately prior to this, Jazz was seen as one of the few surviving Autobots in the alternate 2009 seen in the story &quot;Rhythms of Darkness&quot;. Here he fought Galvatron to give Spike time to attach the American flag to the Deception stronghold in New York and persuade the European Coalition to call off their nuclear attack. Jazz was saved from death by the arrival of Hook, Line and Sinker, who forcibly transported Galvatron back to the &quot;present&quot; of the regular timeline. He briefly reappeared during the battle on the planet Ethos in the &quot;Generation 2&quot; comic.

Jazz was also one of the main Autobots in the Earthforce unit of Marvel U.K.&#x27;s &quot;Earthforce&quot; stories. The annual story &quot;The Magnificent Six&quot; revealed that four million years ago, Jazz was teamed with Inferno, Ironhide, Wheeljack and Sunstreaker and had been tortured by the sadistic Decepticon Megadeath in the Stanix region. He and the others faced Megadeath once again in the present and defeated him.

Jazz would appear in the U.K. Marvel comic issue #234, &quot;Prime&#x27;s Rib!&quot; This story is set in the near future, 1995, where Optimus Prime, Jazz and Hot Rod introduce the latest Autobot, Arcee, to the human feminists. She was met with displeasure by the humans, being called a token female and disliked for her pink color. They were then attacked by Shockwave, Fangry, Horri-Bull and Squeezeplay, who thought the Autobots would be unveiling a new weapon. The Autobots fought off the Decepticons, who escaped, but nothing seemed to please the human feminists.

:The toy was reissued as Autobot Jazz by Hasbro in April 2003. Hasbro followed Takara package design change and released Jazz in flap window box.

He was released in both white and red colors, with fans referring to the red version as Zoom-Zoom (A reference to the jingle used in Mazda commercials). Binaltech Meister was released again in 2008 with a Transformers 2007 movie Jazz silver paint color and slight mold tweaks that were found on the Binaltech BT-13 Laserwave. This new release is called Argent Meister.
:Initially released in small numbers in 2004, Jazz was re-released in 2006 in new packaging. Due to trademarking, Jazz toys are generally prefixed with the word &quot;Autobot&quot;, to reinforce Hasbro&#x27;s rights to the name in the &quot;Toys and Sporting Goods&quot; trademark category. However, Aaron Archer has stated that since Hasbro had already used the &quot;Autobot&quot; prefix for the two previous Alternators figures, &quot;Autobot Hound&quot; and &quot;Autobot Tracks&quot;, they instead elected to use the Japanese name rather than repeat the same pattern with &quot;Autobot Jazz&quot;. Additionally, there was still some optimism that Porsche might change their mind and grant them the license to do an actual &quot;Jazz&quot; as a Porsche. As an inside joke, when Hasbro was describing their new &quot;Meister&quot; toy on their web site they stated, &quot;Incredible detail and 1:24 scale jazzes up the action!&quot;
:Alternators Meister was voted the 75th top toy released in the last 10 years by Toyfare Magazine.

(White versions of 2004&#x27;s &quot;Alternators&quot; and &quot;Binaltech&quot; Jazz were popularly customized this way by collectors and fans of the Generation 1 Jazz.)

* &quot;Universe&quot; Classic Series Legends Jazz (2008)

* &quot;Generation 1&quot; Encore Reissue Meister (2008)

==Transformers Cinematic Universe==

Jazz appears in the 2007 &quot;Transformers&quot; live-action film, directed by Michael Bay and voiced by Darius McCrary. When the movie producers unveiled the final list of Transformers characters appearing in the movie, Jazz was described as having a love of style, with a hip-hop personality. Jazz first appears in the film arriving onto Earth in his Protoform state and searches for a suitable alternate mode at a car dealership. Using a fluid capoeira inspired style, he can be seen transforming using a windmill dance move in his first scene and dialogue, Optimus Prime describes him as his first lieutenant, as he was in the G1 animated series.

Along with Optimus Prime, Jazz is the Autobot who retains most of his original Generation 1 design in the film, among his iconic features, his trademark &quot;visor&quot;, which is retractable in the movie, as well as front-chassis chest and wheel wells in his feet. Also, his vehicle mode, although in the film his alternate mode is not a Porsche 935, a similar-looking model was chosen, as Jazz&#x27;s alternate mode in the film is a silver/gray customized hardtop Pontiac Solstice GXP, similar to the weekend racer concept car. Jazz is armed with a crescent blaster. He also possesses a type of electromagnet in his right arm, which he uses to disarm humans of their guns without causing them injury, curiously leaving jewelry and electronics unaffected.

Jazz is the smallest of the Autobots. Michael Bay stated in an early interview that Jazz stands 13 feet tall, however the scale of his Deluxe toy suggests he would stand closer to 15 feet tall. This is confirmed by his profile in the second issue of the Transformers U.K. Magazine, where it is stated, he stands 15 feet 7 inches tall, weighs 1.8 tons and has a maximum speed of 400 miles per hour. The official guide to the Transformers video game also says he&#x27;s 15 feet tall. Despite his small stature, Jazz was fearless, and would not hesitate to attack a much larger foe. Back in the film, Jazz engages Megatron, defying him to the end, but is overwhelmed by the Decepticon, and Jazz was caught in his grip, asking the Decepticon, &quot;You want a piece of me?&quot;. Megatron responded &quot;No, I want TWO!&quot;, ripping Jazz in half and killing him. Eventually, Jazz&#x27;s death was avenged when Sam kills Megatron by infusing the Allspark into his chest, and Optimus and the Autobots mourn for Jazz after salvaging his remains, declaring him to be a great comrade.

The vehicles used for Bumblebee, Ironhide, Jazz and Ratchet were put on display by General Motors at the 2007 Detroit River Walk Festival a little over a week before the U.S. release of the film.

===Books===
Jazz appeared in the prequel novel &quot;&quot;. His character was close to his G1 incarnation&#x27;s, being continually wisecracking and easygoing. He was part of Prime&#x27;s Autobot team searching for the Allspark. With Prime and Bumblebee on the surface, Ironhide and Jazz battled the Decepticons, but Jazz was badly damaged by Bonecrusher, only being saved by Ratchet&#x27;s volley of fire from the &quot;Ark&quot;. In the final battle, Jazz fought Frenzy, knocking him out before helping Ironhide against Bonecrusher, but was unable to stop Starscream from destroying the human vessel &quot;Ghost-1&quot;.

In the children&#x27;s book &quot;Transformers Prime Time&quot; by Michael Teitelbaum, Jazz is depicted as being a convertible with the top down, unlike all other media which depicts him as having a hard top. The plot of this book has Jazz facing off against Megatron just after Megatron thawed from the ice under Hoover Dam as Bumblebee escaped with the Allspark cube.

===Comics===

====IDW Publishing====
In &quot;Transformers: Defiance&quot; issue #1, back on ancient Cybertron Jazz is among Optimus&#x27; crew at an excavation site near the temple at Simfur where an artifact is uncovered. In issue #2 he sides with Optimus Prime against Megatron&#x27;s order to counter-attack Cybertron&#x27;s invaders. In issue #3 Optimus Prime, Jazz and Prowl break into Megatron&#x27;s quarters while he was away looking for clues as to his current unusual behavior. What they find is the ancient artifact recently uncovered that Megatron had restored. When Megatron learned that Optimus has broken into his room he sent Bumblebee, Camshaft, Cliffjumper, Jazz, Prowl and Smokescreen to arrest Optimus for treason. Optimus demanded to speak directly to Megatron, but when the group was traveling to Megatron&#x27;s location they were ambushed by Barricade, Brawl, Crankcase, Frenzy, Starscream, Skywarp and Thundercracker who had orders to kill the lot of them. Smokescreen was able to cover Optimus and his group&#x27;s retreat in the confusion of an explosion. In issue #4 Arcee, Bumblebee, Cliffjumper, Jazz and Smokescreen ambush Ironhide, who they believe works for Megatron, but Ironhide instead joins Optimus Prime&#x27;s Autobots.

Jazz is among the Autobot forces who witness the launching of the Decepticon ship Nemesis.

In &quot;&quot; #1, Optimus Prime transports the body of the destroyed Jazz from Mission City in a trailer.

In &quot;Transformers: Alliance&quot; #1, during the aftermath of the battle of Mission City, Ironhide places Jazz&#x27;s remains in a trailer while Captain Lennox and Sergeant Epps and his men pay their respects to the Autobot who sacrificed himself to save them. In &quot;Transformers: Alliance #3&quot;, a funeral is held for Jazz by the US Navy and Autobots. The trailer containing Jazz&#x27;s remains is dumped into the ocean by a crane.

====Titan Magazines====
The Titan Transformers U.K. magazine would reveal Jazz&#x27;s role in the departure of the Allspark from Cybertron. When it was jettisoned into space, he, Ironhide and Ratchet hit the pursuing Megatron with a tractor beam, dragging him back to Cybertron. They were no match for his firepower, but the Decepticon leader, realizing they were just stalling him, called in Devastator. He proved impervious to their firepower, and seemingly eliminated them all with a foldspace warhead, with Megatron commenting they were &quot;lost in space&quot;.

Jazz appeared in issue #6 of the Titan Transformers magazine. Clocker and Jazz were being pursued by Bonecrusher, with Jazz half-dead due to not protecting his Spark Core properly - he would&#x27;ve been fully dead if Clocker hadn&#x27;t saved him. Clocker ordered him to flee while he fought the enemy - the condition Jazz was in, &quot;you&#x27;re more hindrance than help to me&quot;. Clocker&#x27;s shots barely affected Bonecrusher and by the time reinforcements arrived, he had been killed.

===Films===
Arriving on Earth at the same time as Optimus Prime, Ironhide, and Ratchet, Jazz&#x27;s protoform lands in Dodger Stadium then re-appears near the Casa de cadillac car dealership (Sherman Oaks, California). Jazz jumps off the roof of the car shop and quickly scans a modified Pontiac Solstice before meeting up with the other Autobots at Bumblebee&#x27;s location.

The Autobots then return to Sam&#x27;s house to retrieve the glasses whilst attempting to hide from Sam&#x27;s parents, which results in their garden being destroyed by Prime&#x27;s feet and Ratchet (Jazz in the comic adaptation) cutting off the neighborhood&#x27;s power after accidentally running into an electric transformer (which they blame on an earthquake). That same evening, a secret government organization called Sector 7 arrests Sam and Mikaela Banes, and captures Bumblebee. As the four remaining Autobots debated their next move after Bumblebee&#x27;s capture the previous night, Jazz showed the most concern for Bumblebee.

In the final battle, when Bumblebee is unable to fight, Jazz provides cover. He fights Devastator (Brawl) alongside Ironhide and Ratchet, and then takes on the Decepticon leader, Megatron. He orders Ironhide and Ratchet to fall back, deciding to stand his ground in order to protect the humans running away. Despite Jazz&#x27; efforts to injure him, Megatron drags Jazz onto the tower and rips him in two, killing him. After the battle, Ironhide and Ratchet find Jazz&#x27; remains lying on the ground, and Optimus eulogises him before moving on. His remains are buried in the Laurentian Fan along with the Decepticons who died in the battle.

Jazz and the other miners later team up with Orion Pax, who told them that the leader Sentinel Prime betrayed the Primes and has secretly been working for the Quintessons, giving them regular Energon supplies in exchange for letting him rule Cybertron while removing the miners&#x27; cogs to keep them subservient. 

In the end, following Sentinel&#x27;s death and Orion&#x27;s transformation into Optimus Prime, Jazz receives his cog, and becomes an Autobot alongside the other miners.

==Transformers: Animated==

In December 2007, drawings were leaked on the internet of Jazz&#x27;s robot appearance in the &quot;&quot; television series, debuting on &quot;The Elite Guard&quot;. Jazz is a trained Cybertronian ninja, and wields a pair of Laser Nunchaku in battle. He is more advanced than Prowl, though he is still impressed by Prowl&#x27;s competency. His overall personality reflects that of his &quot;Generation 1&quot; incarnation and he&#x27;s quite open-minded when it concerns humans and their culture. In his own words, &quot;Any species that can come up with a sweet ride like this, can&#x27;t be all bad.&quot;

Jazz is depicted as the second-in-command of the Cybertron Elite Guard team under Sentinel Prime. He arrives on Earth with Ultra Magnus and Sentinel Prime and quickly adapts to Earth&#x27;s culture. Throughout the series, Jazz shows a balanced approach to leadership and exhibits a strong moral compass, standing out as one of the more open-minded Autobots when dealing with humans and Earth customs. He teams up with various Autobots like Prowl and Bumblebee in missions to battle Decepticons and to investigate Allspark fragments. His alignment with Sentinel Prime begins to waver as he starts questioning Sentinel&#x27;s personal ambitions over the collective good of the Autobots.

Jazz&#x27;s character undergoes significant development in later episodes, including &quot;Transwarped&quot; and &quot;Endgame,&quot; where he takes on mentorship roles and demonstrates advanced combat skills. After discerning that Sentinel Prime&#x27;s objectives are becoming self-centered, he elects to leave the Elite Guard and officially joins Optimus Prime&#x27;s Earth team. During the series finale, he collaborates with Prowl to neutralize threatening Omega Supreme clones by assembling AllSpark fragments. Despite the heartbreaking loss of Prowl, who sacrifices himself to save Detroit, Jazz continues to exemplify Autobot ideals. He returns to Cybertron with Optimus Prime’s team, the captured Megatron, and Prowl’s remains, indicating his commitment to the Autobot cause and honoring his fallen comrade.

<text>Mary Rosamond Haas (January 23, 1910 – May 17, 1996) was an American linguist who specialized in North American Indigenous languages, Thai, and historical linguistics. She served as president of the Linguistic Society of America. She was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a member of the National Academy of Sciences.

==Early life and education==

Haas was born in Richmond, Indiana. She attended high school and Earlham College in Richmond.

She completed her PhD in linguistics at Yale University in 1935 at the age of 25, with a dissertation titled &quot;A Grammar of the Tunica Language&quot;. In the 1930s, Haas worked with the last native speaker of Tunica, Sesostrie Youchigant, producing extensive texts and vocabularies.

== Career and research ==

===Early work in linguistics===
Haas undertook graduate work on comparative philology at the University of Chicago. She studied under Edward Sapir, whom she would follow to Yale. She began a long career in linguistic fieldwork by studying various languages during the summer months.

Over the ten-year period from 1931 to 1941, Haas studied the Wakashan language Nitinat (Ditidaht), as well as a number of languages that were mainly originally spoken in the American Southeast: Tunica, Natchez, Creek, Koasati, Choctaw, Alabama, Cherokee and Hichiti. Her first published paper, &quot;A Visit to the Other World, a Nitinat Text&quot;, written in collaboration with Morris Swadesh, was published in 1933.

Shortly after, Haas conducted fieldwork with Watt Sam and Nancy Raven, the last two native speakers of the Natchez language in Oklahoma. Her extensive unpublished field notes have constituted the most reliable source of information on the now dead language. She conducted extensive fieldwork on the Creek language, and was the first modern linguist to collect extensive texts in the language. Her Creek texts were published after her death in a volume that was edited and translated by Jack B. Martin, Margaret McKane Mauldin, and Juanita McGirt.

===Career at the University of California-Berkeley===
During World War II, the United States government viewed the study and teaching of Southeast Asian languages as important to the war effort, and under the auspices of the Army Specialized Training Program at the University of California at Berkeley, Haas developed a program to teach the Thai language. Her authoritative &quot;Thai-English Students&#x27; Dictionary&quot;, published in 1964, is still in use.

In 1948, she was appointed assistant professor of Thai and Linguistics at the University of California, Berkeley Department of Oriental Languages, an appointment she attributed to Peter A. Boodberg, whom she described as &quot;ahead of his time in the way he treated women scholars—a scholar was a scholar in his book&quot;. She became one of the founding members of the UC-Berkeley Department of Linguistics when it was established in 1953. She was a long-term chair of the department, and she was Director of the Survey of California Indian Languages at Berkeley from 1953 to 1977. She retired from Berkeley in 1977 and in 1984 was elected a Berkeley Fellow.

Mary Haas died at her home in Berkeley, California, on May 17, 1996, at the age of 86.

===Role in teaching===
Haas was noted for her dedication to teaching linguistics, and to the role of the linguist in language instruction. Her student Karl V. Teeter pointed out in his obituary of Haas that she trained more Americanist linguists than her former instructors Edward Sapir and Franz Boas combined: she supervised fieldwork in Americanist linguistics by more than 100 doctoral students. As a founder and director of the Survey of California Indian Languages, she advised nearly fifty dissertations, including those of many linguists who would go on to be influential in the field, including William Bright (Karok), William Shipley (Maidu), Robert Oswalt (Kashaya), Karl Teeter (Wiyot), Catherine Callaghan (Penutian), Margaret Langdon (Diegueño), Sally McLendon (Eastern Pomo), Victor Golla (Hupa), Marc Okrand (Mutsun), Kenneth Whistler (Proto-Wintun), Douglas Parks (Pawnee and Arikara), and William Jacobsen (Washo).

== Personal life ==
She married Morris Swadesh, a fellow linguist, in 1931. They divorced in 1937.

==Awards and honors==
In 1963, Haas served as president of the Linguistic Society of America. She was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1964. She was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1974, and she was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1978. She received honorary doctorates from Northwestern University in 1975, the University of Chicago in 1976, Earlham College, 1980, and the Ohio State University in 1980.

<text>HMS &quot;Shannon&quot; was a 38-gun frigate of the Royal Navy. She was launched in 1806 and served in the Napoleonic Wars and the War of 1812. She won a noteworthy naval victory on 1 June 1813, during the latter conflict, when she captured the United States Navy frigate in a bloody battle.

==Design and construction==
&quot;Shannon&quot; was an 18-pounder frigate. The class was based on the lines of the captured French 38-gun frigate &quot;Hébé&quot;, a design by Jacques-Noël Sané vaunted as an all-rounder. The naval historian Robert Gardiner argues that the key characteristic of the design, leading to its adoption with the Royal Navy, was its &quot;unspectacular excellence&quot;. One ship, HMS &quot;Leda&quot;, was built during the French Revolutionary Wars in 1800. With the Napoleonic Wars subsequently beginning, the design was revived as one of three mass-produced frigates, contrasting with the strategy of the previous war which had seen a much more sporadic choice of designs.

The first three ships of the revival, including &quot;Shannon&quot;, were contracted out to private shipyards. The frigate was ordered on 24 October 1803 to be built at Frindsbury by Josiah and Thomas Brindley. &quot;Shannon&quot; was laid down there in August the following year. The ship was launched on 5 May 1806 with the following dimensions: along the gun deck, at the keel, with a beam of and a depth in the hold of . Her draught was forward and aft, and the ship measured 1,065 tons burthen. The fitting out process for &quot;Shannon&quot; was completed on 3 August at Chatham Dockyard. Her construction and fitting out cost in total £33,048.

The frigate originally had a crew complement of 284, but this was later increased to 300. &quot;Shannon&quot; held twenty-eight 18-pounder long guns on her upper deck. The &quot;Leda&quot;-class frigates were stipulated to be armed with eight 9-pounder long guns and six 32-pounder carronades on the quarterdeck, but &quot;Shannon&quot; differed from this. She was given two 9-pounder long guns and twelve 32-pounder carronades. Complementing this were two 9-pounder long guns and two 32-pounder carronades on the forecastle. &quot;Shannon&quot; was named after the River Shannon, the fourth Royal Navy ship to bear that name.

Sailing reports from ships of the &quot;Leda&quot; class record that they were generally very fast, reaching in strong winds. They were however not particularly and rolled heavily. During her service &quot;Shannon&quot;, described as a &quot;sensitive ship&quot;, had her false keel increased to counter these issues. The construction techniques used by the Brindleys included not using knees, which in her later service saw &quot;Shannon&quot;″s upper levels loose and &quot;work[ing] like a basket&quot;.

==Service==

===Commissioning===
&quot;Shannon&quot; spent her first seven years under the command of Captain Philip Broke, who was transferred from and took command of &quot;Shannon&quot; in June 1806.

===Home waters===
&quot;Shannon&quot; was quickly put into service. She formed part of a squadron under Commodore Owen that was patrolling off the French port of Boulogne. On 8 October she took part in the bombardment of the town using Congreve rockets.

Her next task was sailing in 1807 with to protect the whale fishery off Greenland. Despite encountering ice on 7 May 1807, they were able to push through, reaching the southern part of Spitsbergen on 17 June. There the two ships surveyed the Bay of Magdalena, at a latitude of 80°N. They eventually reached a latitude of 80° 6&#x27; N before the ice stopped them. They then turned westwards and reached the coast of Greenland on 23 July. The island of Shannon is named after the ship. &quot;Shannon&quot; spent the early autumn cruising from Shetland. She then left, returning to Yarmouth by the end of September, where she cruised off the Downs. She put into Spithead on 28 September to refit.

By the end of 1807, France had invaded Portugal, and &quot;Shannon&quot; joined Sir Samuel Hood&#x27;s expedition against Madeira. The British took the island without firing a shot. Captain Broke then escorted the transports that had accompanied the fleet back to England, where they arrived on 7 February 1808. &quot;Shannon&quot; put into Plymouth before returning to patrolling in the Channel.

On 20 July &quot;Shannon&quot; was in company with and when they captured &quot;Comet&quot;. Then on 21 August, &quot;Shannon&quot; was in company with &quot;Surinam&quot; and when they captured &quot;Espoir&quot;.

In November 1808, &quot;Shannon&quot; took the French frigate &quot;Thétis&quot; in tow. had shortly before captured &quot;Thétis&quot;, which later entered service as HMS &quot;Brune&quot;.

&quot;Shannon&quot; spent 1809 with the Channel Fleet and on 27 January captured the French 14-gun privateer cutter &quot;Pommereuil&quot;. Broke sent the prize into Plymouth.

On 1 June 1811, &quot;Shannon&quot; returned to Plymouth and was put into the dock where her hull was re-coppered. After this was completed, she sailed for Portsmouth to complete her refitting and resupplying in preparation for being assigned to foreign service.

===The American coast===
Broke and &quot;Shannon&quot; were ordered to sail for North America as tensions between Britain and the United States escalated in the run-up to what would become the War of 1812. &quot;Shannon&quot; sailed from Portsmouth and arrived in Halifax on 24 September 1811 after a journey of 45 days.

On 5 July 1812 Broke took command of a squadron consisting of &quot;Shannon&quot;, , , and later . Vice-Admiral Herbert Sawyer then ordered him to carry out a blockade of American ports.

Broke&#x27;s first success came on 16 July when he captured the 16-gun American brig off Sandy Hook. &quot;Nautilus&quot; had been on a cruise from New York.

Later in the evening, the squadron spotted and gave chase to as she sailed from Chesapeake Bay to New York. The chase lasted some 65 hours, during which both pursued and pursuers had to tow and warp. &quot;Belvidera&quot; eventually managed to come within gunshot of &quot;Constitution&quot; on the afternoon of 17 July, but a lucky breeze blew up, and &quot;Constitution&quot;″s clean bottom allowed her to make good her escape.

&quot;Shannon&quot;″s next duty was to meet a convoy homebound from Jamaica. An American squadron under Commodore John Rodgers had sailed to intercept it. &quot;Shannon&quot; ensured the convoy safely passed the Great Banks, before she returned to the American coast. &quot;Shannon&quot; recaptured the brig &quot;Planter&quot;, which the American privateer &quot;Atlas&quot; had captured on 3 August.

&quot;Shannon&quot; put into Halifax on 20 September to take on provisions. Sir John Warren arrived while she was in port, and took up the post of commander in chief of the North America and West Indies Station. He then despatched &quot;Shannon&quot; with the schooner to rescue the crew and offload the money being carried by the frigate , which had been wrecked on Sable Island. While carrying out this mission, &quot;Shannon&quot; encountered and subsequently captured an enemy privateer schooner, &quot;Wily Reynard&quot; on 11 October, that she took back to Halifax with her.

On 31 October, while &quot;Shannon&quot; was cruising with , , and , Broke captured the American privateer brig &quot;Thorn&quot;. &quot;Thorn&quot; was armed with eighteen long 9-pounder guns and had a crew of 140 men. She was three weeks out of Marblehead on her first cruise. Sent to Halifax with a prize crew, &quot;Thorn&quot; was subsequently purchased and renamed as the Nova Scotia privateer brig &quot;Sir John Sherbrooke&quot;.

Sir John Warren was at Bermuda during the winter of 1812, and left Broke in command of the Royal Navy squadrons operating on the coasts of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and New England. In December Broke took the &quot;Shannon&quot; and escorted a homebound convoy halfway across the Atlantic, returning to North America by sailing round the Azores.

On 31 January 1813 &quot;Shannon&quot; recaptured the ship , which the American privateer had captured six days earlier in a hard-fought action.

In 1813, Captain Oliver arrived on the station aboard the 74-gun third rate , and took command from Captain Broke. Broke continued to deploy with his squadron until &quot;Shannon&quot; and &quot;Tenedos&quot; became separated from them in a gale. They decided to steer for Boston, reaching the port on 2 April. Having observed the activity in the port, they returned to their squadron and reported the presence of the American frigates , and &quot;Constitution&quot;. In their absence, had entered the harbour through the eastern channel.

Captain Capel aboard ordered &quot;Shannon&quot; and &quot;Tenedos&quot; to watch the port from close inshore, while the rest of the squadron cruised in the offing. On 16 May &quot;Shannon&quot; and &quot;Tenedos&quot; chased a large armed ship under American colours, and forced her to run aground near Cape Ann Town. &quot;Shannon&quot; anchored close to the grounded ship and fired a few shots to disperse a number of militiamen who were assembling. Lieutenant George Watt of &quot;Shannon&quot; then managed to bring the ship off the shore without loss. She was the French corvette-built privateer &quot;Invincible&quot;, of 16 guns, originally named .

On 25 March &quot;Shannon&quot; took on stores of water and provisions from &quot;Tenedos&quot;, which was then detached, with orders to rejoin the &quot;Shannon&quot; on 14 June.

==Fighting &quot;Chesapeake&quot;==
===Issuing a challenge===
During his long period in command of &quot;Shannon&quot;, Broke had drilled his crew to an extremely high standard of naval gunnery.

The weekly routine at sea was for the watch on deck to be exercised at the great guns on Monday and Tuesday forenoons, and in the afternoons the first division of the watch was exercised at small arms. Wednesday and Thursday forenoons saw the watch on deck at the carronades, and in the afternoons the second division of the watch at small arms. Friday was reserved for the midshipmen – great guns in the morning, small arms in the afternoon. Thus each man had one morning at the 18-pounders, one morning at the carronades and two afternoons with musquets in every week. Saturdays were reserved for washing clothes and scrubbing the berth deck in the afternoon. Sunday, apart from Church service and any necessary evolutions with the sails, was free.

In addition to these gunnery drills, Broke was fond of preparing hypothetical scenarios to test his crew. For example, after all hands had been drummed to quarters, he would inform them of a theoretical attack and see how they would act to defend the ship. He would also arrange on occasion for a wooden cask to be sent over the side so competitions could be held to see which crew could hit it and how fast they could do so. A game called &#x27;singlestick&#x27; was also practised. &quot;This was a game employing roughly similar thrusts and parries as were used with cutlass, but as it was played with blunt sticks, hits, although painful, were not often dangerous. It soon developed quickness of eye and wrist.&quot;

Eager to engage and defeat one of the American &#x27;super-frigates&#x27; that had already scored a number of victories over smaller Royal Navy ships in single-ship confrontations, Broke prepared a challenge. The warship &quot;President&quot; had already slipped out of the harbour under the cover of fog and had evaded the British. &quot;Constitution&quot; was undergoing extensive repairs and alterations and would not be ready for sea in the foreseeable future. However, &quot;Chesapeake&quot; appeared to be ready to put to sea.

Consequently, Broke decided to send his challenge to &quot;Chesapeake&quot;, which had been refitting in Boston harbour under the command of Captain James Lawrence, offering single-ship combat. While patrolling offshore, &quot;Shannon&quot; had intercepted and captured a number of American ships attempting to reach the harbour. After sending two of them off to Halifax, he found that his crew was dangerously reduced in numbers. Broke therefore resorted to burning the rest of the prizes in order to conserve his highly trained crew in anticipation of the battle with &quot;Chesapeake&quot;. Broke sent the boats from the burnt prizes into Boston, carrying Broke&#x27;s oral invitation to Lawrence to come out and engage him. He had already sent &quot;Tenedos&quot; away in the hope that the more favourable odds would entice the American out, but eventually began to despair that &quot;Chesapeake&quot; would ever come out of the harbour. He finally decided to send a written challenge.

As the Chesapeake appears now ready for sea, I request you will do me the favour to meet the Shannon with her, ship to ship, to try the fortune of our respective flags. The Shannon mounts twenty-four guns upon her broadside and one light boat-gun; 18 pounders upon her main deck, and 32-pounder carronades upon her quarter-deck and forecastle; and is manned with a complement of 300 men and boys, beside thirty seamen, boys, and passengers, who were taken out of recaptured vessels lately. I entreat you, sir, not to imagine that I am urged by mere personal vanity to the wish of meeting the Chesapeake, or that I depend only upon your personal ambition for your acceding to this invitation. We have both noble motives. You will feel it as a compliment if I say that the result of our meeting may be the most grateful service I can render to my country; and I doubt not that you, equally confident of success, will feel convinced that it is only by repeated triumphs in even combats that your little navy can now hope to console your country for the loss of that trade it can no longer protect. Favour me with a speedy reply. We are short of provisions and water, and cannot stay long here.

By now &quot;Shannon&quot; had been off Boston for 56 days and was running short of provisions, while the extended period at sea was wearing the ship down. She would be even more at a disadvantage facing &quot;Chesapeake&quot;, fresh from harbour and a refit.

Broke despatched a boat carrying the invitation, manned by a Mr Slocum, a discharged American prisoner. The boat had not reached the shore when &quot;Chesapeake&quot; was seen underway, sailing out of the harbour. She was flying three American ensigns and a large white flag at the foremast inscribed &#x27;Free Trade and Sailor&#x27;s Rights&#x27;.

Though Lawrence had not received Broke&#x27;s letter before leaving harbour, according to author Ian W. Toll, it would not have made any difference, Lawrence intended to sail at the first day of favourable weather. The fact that it was not in his nation&#x27;s interests at this point in the war to be challenging British frigates seems not to have entered into his reasoning; &quot;President&quot; had in fact slipped out of harbour in foul weather to commerce raid, which was deemed in the US national interest.

The two ships had in one another about as close a match as could exist in a state of war. &quot;Chesapeake&quot;″s (rated at 38 guns) armament of twenty-eight 18-pounder long guns was an exact match for &quot;Shannon&quot;. Measurements proved the ships to be about the same deck length. The only measurable difference between the two ships was the size of their complements: &quot;Chesapeake&quot;″s 379 against &quot;Shannon&quot;″s 330. &quot;Shannon&quot; carried 276 officers, seamen and marines of her proper complement; eight recaptured seamen; 22 Irish labourers who had been 48 hours in the ship and of whom only four could speak English, and 24 boys, of whom about 13 were under 12 years of age.

Broke had trained his gun crews to fire accurate broadsides into the hulls of enemy vessels, with the aim of killing their gun crews, rather than shooting down the masts. By contrast, half of &quot;Chesapeake&quot;″s officers and up to one quarter of the crew were new to the ship. Her crew had conducted no practice at small arms nor of the main battery. Despite this, Lawrence believed that he would win the battle. The previous American victories over smaller Royal Navy ships left him expectant of success, especially since &quot;Chesapeake&quot; had a substantially larger crew than &quot;Shannon&quot;.

Still, before setting sail, Lawrence wrote two quick notes, one to the Secretary of the Navy pronouncing his intentions and another to his brother-in-law asking him to look after Lawrence&#x27;s wife and children in event of his death. He then set sail. Just before the engagement, the American crew gave three cheers.

===Initial engagement===
The two ships met at half past five in the afternoon, east of Boston lighthouse, between Cape Ann and Cape Cod. &quot;Shannon&quot; was flying a rusty blue ensign and her dilapidated outside appearance after a long period at sea suggested that she would be an easy opponent. Observing &quot;Chesapeake&quot;″s many flags, a sailor had questioned Broke: &quot;Mayn&#x27;t we have three ensigns, sir, like she has?&quot; &quot;No,&quot; said Broke, &quot;we&#x27;ve always been an unassuming ship.&quot;

&quot;Shannon&quot; refused to fire upon &quot;Chesapeake&quot; as she bore down, nor would &quot;Chesapeake&quot; rake &quot;Shannon&quot; despite having the weather gage. Lawrence&#x27;s behaviour that day earned him praise from British officers for his gallantry. The two ships opened fire just before 18:00 at a range of about , with &quot;Shannon&quot; scoring the first hit, striking &quot;Chesapeake&quot; on one of her gunports with two round shot and a bag of musket balls fired by William Mindham, the gun captain of one of &quot;Shannon&quot;″s starboard 18-pounders. Two or three further broadsides followed that swept &quot;Chesapeake&quot;″s decks with grape and roundshot from &quot;Shannon&quot;″s 32-pounder carronades. &quot;Shannon&quot;″s fire destroyed &quot;Chesapeake&quot;″s helm and fore-topsail halyards; this caused her to &#x27;luff up&#x27; into the wind. &quot;Chesapeake&quot;, unable to manoeuvre, then made sternway (was blown backwards). Her port stern quarter contacted &quot;Shannon&quot;″s side, level with the fifth gun port from the bow, and was trapped by one of &quot;Shannon&quot;″s anchors.

With &quot;Chesapeake&quot; trapped against &quot;Shannon&quot; and unable to manoeuvre, &quot;Chesapeake&quot;″s stern now became exposed to raking British fire. Her situation worsened when a small open cask of musket cartridges abaft the mizzen-mast blew up. When the smoke cleared, Captain Broke judged the time was right and gave the order to board. Lawrence, too, tried to give the order to board, but the British were faster.

===The British board===

Mr Stevens, the boatswain attempted to lash the two ships together to prevent &quot;Chesapeake&quot; from disengaging and escaping. This bravery cost him an arm. A party of small-arm men rushed aboard &quot;Chesapeake&quot;, led by Broke and including the purser, Mr G. Aldham, and the clerk, Mr John Dunn. Aldham and Dunn were killed as they crossed the gangway, but the rest of the party made it onto &quot;Chesapeake&quot;.

Captain Broke, at the head of not more than twenty men, stepped from the rail of the waist-hammock netting to the muzzle of the after-carronade of the Chesapeake, and sprang from thence upon her quarterdeck.

The main-deck was found to be empty, having been swept clear by &quot;Shannon&quot;&#x27;s broadsides. Broke and his men quickly advanced forward along the deck, while more British reinforcements leapt aboard.

Meanwhile, the first lieutenant, Mr George T. L. Watt, had attempted to hoist the British colours over &quot;Chesapeake&quot; but was killed, hit in the forehead by grapeshot, as he did so. Fighting had now broken out along the top-masts of the ships as rival sharpshooters fired upon their opponents in the masts, and on the sailors on the exposed decks. The British marksmen, led by Midshipman William Smith, who had command of the fore-top, stormed &quot;Chesapeake&quot;″s fore-top over the yard-arm and killed all the Americans there.

Captain Broke himself led a charge against a number of the Americans who had managed to rally on the forecastle. After four minutes of fierce fighting, the Americans called for quarter, but then, finding that they outnumbered the British, they rallied and counterattacked. Three American sailors, probably from the rigging, descended and attacked Captain Broke. Although taken by surprise, he killed the first. The second hit him with a musket, which stunned him, while the third sliced open his skull with his sabre, knocking Broke to the deck. Before the American could finish Broke off, he was cut down by William Windham. &quot;Shannon&quot;″s crew rallied to the defence of their captain and carried the forecastle, killing the remaining Americans.

Broke handed over command of &quot;Shannon&quot; to Lieutenant Provo Wallis. Though wounded, Broke was able to save the life of a young American midshipman who had slid down a rope from the fore-top. With American resistance weakening, Lieutenant Charles Leslie Falkiner, who had commanded the boarders who had rushed the main-deck, took command of the prize. While the two-yard-arms had been locked together, Mr Cosnaham, who had commanded the main-top, had crawled out on the main yard-arm where he could fire down onto &quot;Chesapeake&quot;, killing three of her men.

===&quot;Chesapeake&quot; is taken===

The British then secured the ship and took her surrender. The engagement had lasted just eleven minutes. &quot;Shannon&quot; had lost 23 killed, and had 56 wounded. &quot;Chesapeake&quot; had about 60 killed, including her four lieutenants, the master and many other of her officers, and about as many wounded. Captain Lawrence had been mortally wounded by fire from &quot;Shannon&quot;″s fore-top and was carried below before &quot;Chesapeake&quot; was boarded. His last order upon being wounded was &quot;Don&#x27;t give up the ship!&quot;.

A large cask of unslaked lime was found open on &quot;Chesapeake&quot;″s forecastle and another bag of lime was discovered in the fore-top. Some British sailors alleged the intention was to throw handfuls into the eyes of &quot;Shannon&quot;″s men as they attempted to board. The historian Albert Gleaves has called the allegations &quot;absurd,&quot; noting, &quot;Lime is always carried in ship&#x27;s stores as a disinfectant, and the fact that it was left on the deck after the ship was cleared for action was probably due to the neglect of some subordinate, or petty officer.&quot;
&quot;Shannon&quot;&#x27;s midshipmen during the action were Messrs. Smith, Leake, Clavering, Raymond, Littlejohn and Samwell. Samwell was the only other officer to be wounded in the action. Mr Etough was the acting master, and conned the ship into the action. Shortly after the frigate had been secured, Broke fainted from loss of blood and was rowed back to &quot;Shannon&quot; to be attended to by the ship&#x27;s surgeon. After the victory, a prize crew was put aboard &quot;Chesapeake&quot; and &quot;Shannon&quot; escorted her and her crew into Halifax, arriving there on 6 June. Lieutenant Bartholomew Kent, of brought the first news of the British victory back to London.

At Halifax &quot;Chesapeake&quot;″s crew was imprisoned. &quot;Chesapeake&quot; herself was repaired and taken into service by the Royal Navy before she was sold at Portsmouth, England in 1820 and broken up.

===Aftermath===

The victory provided a boost to the British position in the Americas, while Lawrence was posthumously honoured in the United States. After setting out on 5 September for a brief cruise under a Captain Teahouse, &quot;Shannon&quot; departed for England on 4 October, carrying the recovering Captain Broke. They arrived at Portsmouth on 2 November. After the successful action Lieutenants Wallis and Falkiner were promoted to the rank of commander, and Messrs. Etough and Smith were made lieutenants. Captain Broke was made a baronet that September. The Court of Common Council of London awarded him the freedom of the city, and a sword worth 100 guineas. He also received a piece of plate worth 750 pounds and a cup worth 100 guineas.

The British buried Captain Lawrence in Halifax with full military honours; six senior Royal Navy officers served as pall bearers. Although &quot;Shannon&quot;″s surgeon had pronounced as fatal Captain Broke&#x27;s head wound from a cutlass stroke, he survived; nevertheless, he never again commanded a ship due to his injuries. Two-thirds of the boarding party which captured the &quot;Chesapeake&quot; were either wounded or killed in action. The casualties, 228 killed or wounded in total, were high, with the ratio making it one of the bloodiest single ship actions of the age of sail. It had the single highest body count in an action between two ships in the entirety of the war. The fact that it happened in 15 minutes is a sign of the sheer ferocity with which this battle was fought between the two combatants.

In 1847 the Admiralty authorized the issue of the Naval General Service Medal with clasp &quot;Shannon wh. Chesapeake&quot; to any surviving claimants from the action.

==Subsequent service==
Commander Humphrey Senhouse (acting) assumed command in June 1813. &quot;Shannon&quot; was in ordinary at Portsmouth in 1814–1815.

Between July 1815 and March 1817, she was at Chatham undergoing extensive repairs that cost £26,328. She then returned to ordinary. She underwent a small repair for £4,969 between May and July 1826. She was fitted for sea between August and December 1828, which cost another £14,746. In September Captain Benjamin Clement recommissioned her, and he would command her until 1830.

&quot;Shannon&quot; became a receiving ship and temporary hulk at Sheerness in 1831. On 11 March 1844 she was renamed &quot;Saint Lawrence&quot;.

==Fate==
&quot;Shannon&quot; was finally broken up at Chatham, a process completed on 12 November 1859.

==Legacy==
* Graves of &quot;Shannon&#x27;s&quot; crew are marked in the cemetery of the Royal Naval Dockyard, Halifax and at the city&#x27;s St. Paul&#x27;s Church, then the cathedral of the Anglican Diocese of Nova Scotia. A plaque was erected to commemorate the battle in Halifax in 1927 and may be seen at Point Pleasant Park. &quot;Shannon&#x27;s&quot; bell is displayed at the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic in Halifax in an exhibit about the battle which includes a surgeon&#x27;s chest and mess kettle from &quot;Chesapeake&quot;. Cannons believed to be from &quot;Shannon&quot; and &quot;Chesapeake&quot; are displayed either side of Province House, Nova Scotia&#x27;s legislature.
* Namesake of Shannon Park, Nova Scotia
* Because he was able to claim six days as acting captain of &quot;Shannon&quot;, Provo Wallis became senior to many others who had been lieutenants in the Napoleonic-era Royal Navy. It was an advantage that, combined with his longevity, eventually propelled him to the post of Admiral of the Fleet.
* A fictionalised account of the battle appears in &quot;The Fortune of War&quot; by Patrick O&#x27;Brian.
* A special Canadian silver 10-dollar coin commemorating the War of 1812 Bicentennial depicts HMS &quot;Shannon&quot;.
* Broke Inlet, Broke, Shannon River, Shannon and Shannon National Park in the south-west of Western Australia are though to have been named after the ship and its captain.

===Folksong===
The battle became the subject of a British ballad:

The Chesapeake and the Shannon

&lt;poem&gt;
The Chesapeake so bold, out of Boston, I am told,
Came to take a British frigate neat and handy, O!
It allowed immigrants to lambast the critical events
that unfolded during the Kentucky resolutions, O!

&quot;Yankee doodle, Yankee doodle dandy, O!&quot;
&quot;The people of the port came out to see the sport,&quot;
&quot;With their music playing Yankee doodle dandy, O!&quot;

The British frigate&#x27;s name, that for the purpose came
To tame the Yankee&#x27;s courage neat and handy, O!
Was the Shannon, Captain Broke, with his crew all hearts of oak,
And in fighting, you must know, he was the dandy, O!

&quot;Yankee doodle, &amp;c.&quot;

The fight had scarce began when the Yankees, with much fun,
Said, we&#x27;ll tow her into Boston neat and handy, O!
And I&#x27;ll kalkilate we&#x27;ll dine, with our lasses, drinking wine,
And we&#x27;ll dance the jig of Yankee doodle dandy, O!

&quot;Yankee doodle, &amp;c.&quot;

But they soon every one flinched from the gun,
Which at first they thought to use so neat and handy, O!
Brave Broke he waved his sword, crying, &quot;Now, my lads, let&#x27;s aboard,&quot;
And we&#x27;ll stop their playing Yankee doodle dandy, O!

&quot;Yankee doodle, &amp;c.&quot;

He scarce had said the word, when they all jump&#x27;d on board,
And they hauled down the ensign neat and handy, O!
Notwithstanding all their brag, the glorious British flag
At the Yankees&#x27; mizzen-peak it looked the dandy, O!

&quot;Yankee doodle, &amp;c.&quot;

Then here&#x27;s to all true blue, both officers and crew,
Who tamed the Yankees&#x27; courage neat and handy, O!
And may it ever prove in battle, as in love,
The true British sailor is the dandy, O!

&quot;Yankee doodle, &amp;c.&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;
* In July 2012, the Royal Canadian Mint issued a commemorative coin about &quot;Shannon&quot;: &quot;The War of 1812 was a fundamental turning point in Canada&#x27;s history. Its history—including that of the Leda-class frigate, HMS &quot;Shannon&quot;—has become an important chapter in the narrative of Canada&#x27;s evolution from colony to sovereign nation. The two-dollar coin featuring HMS &quot;Shannon&quot; commemorates the historic 11-minute battle with the USS &quot;Chesapeake&quot; off the coast of Boston. The capture of the &quot;Chesapeake&quot; marked a decisive naval victory for the British at a time when morale was waning.&quot;

<text>Ullage motors (also known as ullage engines or ullage rockets) are relatively small, independently fueled rocket engines that may be fired prior to main engine ignition, when the vehicle is in a zero-g situation. The resulting acceleration causes liquid in the rocket&#x27;s main tanks to settle towards the aft end, ensuring uninterrupted flow to the fuel and oxidizer pumps.

==Description==
Cryogenic-liquid-fueled rockets keep their propellants in insulated tanks. These tanks are never completely filled to allow for expansion. In micro-gravity conditions the cryogenic liquids are without a free surface, and exist in a slushy state between solid, liquid, and gas. In this mixed state, ullage gases may be sucked into the engines, which is undesirable, as it displaces useful propellant, reduces efficiency, and may damage the engines.

Small rocket engines, called &quot;ullage motors&quot;, are sometimes used to settle the propellant before main engine ignition to allow the formation of a temporary free surface (with a distinct boundary between liquid and gas states). These motors provide acceleration that moves the main engine liquid propellants to the bottom of their tanks (&quot;bottom&quot; in this usage always meaning relative to the alignment of the main motor the ullage motors are serving), so they can be pumped into the engine plumbing. 

The firing of the ullage motors is used before engine reignition, during stage separation and/or stabilization of a rocket when there are brief reductions in acceleration which could allow the liquid propellant to float away from the engine intakes. Ullage motors are also commonly employed on deep-space missions where a liquid rocket needs to start a burn after traveling in micro-gravity. 

To perform this ullage pre-acceleration, reaction control system (RCS) thrusters are sometimes used. Larger ullage motors can also use solid propellant, which makes them generally single-use.

== American operations ==
The Agena-A was one of the first vehicles to make use of an ullage system in preparation for ignition after separating from its Thor booster. Failure of the Agena&#x27;s internal timer was also blamed for premature ignition of this ullage system in the failed launch of &quot;Discoverer Zero&quot; on January 21, 1959. 

The second stage (S-II) of the Saturn V rocket used in the American Apollo program used four (originally eight) ullage motors located on the aft interstage skirt. In the S-IVB third stage, there was an Auxiliary Propulsion System that also had ullage functions. Ullage is often a secondary function of the reaction control system such as on the Apollo Lunar Module (LM). In his book &quot;Lost Moon&quot;, Jim Lovell recounted a description of a course-correction burn of the LEM&#x27;s main descent engine to re-enter a free return trajectory to Earth during the successful recovery of the Apollo 13 capsule:

When the ship had stabilized in the proper attitude for firing, Lovell would deploy the LEM&#x27;s landing gear, extending its four spidery legs to get them out of the way of the descent engine. Next the computer, relying on other instructions Haise typed into it, would fire four of &quot;Aquarius&quot; attitude jets for 7.5 seconds. This procedure, known as &quot;ullage&quot;, was intended to jolt the spacecraft slightly forward and force the descent engine fuel to the bottom of its tanks, eliminating bubbles and air pockets. After that, the main descent engine would ignite automatically firing at 10 percent thrust for 5 seconds.

== Soviet/Russian operations ==
Ullage motors were used by Soviet engineers for the Molniya interplanetary launch vehicle in 1960.

Russian Proton rockets use ullage motors called SOZ motors. These have a bad tendency of exploding years after end of operations, contributing to space debris. So far, 54 such SOZ motors have exploded in orbit.

<doc id="1312555" wikidata="Q2635267" url="?curid=1312555" title="Wedding March (Mendelssohn)">
<text>Felix Mendelssohn&#x27;s &quot;Wedding March&quot; in C major, written in 1842, is one of the best known of the pieces from his suite of incidental music (Op. 61) to Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;. It is one of the most frequently used wedding marches, generally being played on a church pipe organ.

At weddings in many Western countries, this piece is commonly used as a recessional, though frequently stripped of its episodes in this context. It is frequently teamed with the &quot;Bridal Chorus&quot; from Richard Wagner&#x27;s opera &quot;Lohengrin&quot;, or with Jeremiah Clarke&#x27;s &quot;Prince of Denmark&#x27;s March&quot;, both of which are often played for the entry of the bride.

The first known instance of Mendelssohn&#x27;s &quot;Wedding March&quot; being used at a wedding was when Dorothy Carew wed Tom Daniel at St Peter&#x27;s Church, Tiverton, England, on 2 June 1847 when it was performed by organist Samuel Reay. However, it did not become popular at weddings until it was selected by Victoria, The Princess Royal for her marriage to Prince Frederick William of Prussia on 25 January 1858. The bride was the daughter of Queen Victoria, who loved Mendelssohn&#x27;s music and for whom Mendelssohn often played while on his visits to Britain.

An organ on which Mendelssohn gave recitals of the &quot;Wedding March&quot;, among other works, is housed in St Ann&#x27;s Church, Tottenham.

Franz Liszt wrote a virtuoso transcription of the &quot;Wedding March and Dance of the Elves&quot; (S. 410) in 1849–50. Based on Liszt&#x27;s transcription, Vladimir Horowitz then transcribed the &quot;Wedding March&quot; into a virtuoso showpiece for piano and played it as an encore at his concerts.

<text>&quot;The Last Night of a Jockey&quot; is an episode of the American television anthology series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. In this episode, a diminutive jockey&#x27;s wish to be a big man is granted. Rod Serling wrote the episode specifically for Mickey Rooney, who is the only actor to appear in it.

==Opening narration==
==Plot==
A jockey named Michael Grady is lying alone in his room after being banned from horse racing for life for fixing races by horse doping. He drinks in his depression, and rues his five-foot height, which horse riding had served to compensate for. He then hears a voice. The voice introduces himself as &quot;the alter ego&quot; and claims to live in Grady&#x27;s head. He argues with the alter ego, trying to justify his life and his actions, even lying about his crimes, but the alter ego knows all about him. Grady is offered the chance to change his life with one wish. Grady says his greatest wish is to be big. After Grady wakes from a nap he finds his wish has been granted; he is now close to eight feet tall.

Ecstatic, Grady calls his ex-girlfriend over the phone, but she dismisses him. He boasts that he can find more girls who will appreciate him because of his newfound height. The alter ego remains unimpressed, feeling Grady has not made good on any of his promises. He derides his dumb and &quot;cheap&quot; wish, and says that Grady could have wished to win the Kentucky Derby fairly, or perform a heroic act.

A telephone call from the racing commission informs Grady that he has been reinstated and can jockey again. Grady joyfully thanks everyone who petitioned to give him a second chance, but the alter ego laughs at him. Grady realizes he has become even larger, about 10 feet tall — too tall to ride a horse, or properly fit in his own apartment. Devastated, the now-giant Grady wrecks his room and pleads with the alter ego to make him small again. The alter ego denies the request, and instead replies, &quot;You &quot;are&quot; small, Mr. Grady. You see, every time you won an honest race, &quot;that&#x27;s&quot; when you were a giant. But right now, they just don&#x27;t come any smaller.&quot;

==Closing narration==
==Censorship==
CBS&#x27;s Program Practices department criticized this episode for use of the word &quot;dwarf&quot; in a negative context, suggesting that instead the terms &quot;half-pint&quot;, &quot;runt&quot; or &quot;shrimp&quot; could be used.

==Mickey Rooney and Rod Serling==
Although this was Mickey Rooney&#x27;s sole appearance on &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, he had earlier co-starred in two dramas written by Rod Serling — &quot;The Comedian&quot;, a live 1957 episode of the 90-minute anthology series &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;, as well as the theatrical feature &quot;Requiem for a Heavyweight&quot;, a 1962 remake of the same-titled 1956 episode of &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;. The making of the as-yet-unreleased production was the subject of a discussion on the December 21, 1961 episode of the late-night talk show &quot;PM East&quot;, with guests Mickey Rooney, Rod Serling and the film&#x27;s star Anthony Quinn. A decade later, in October 1972, Mickey Rooney co-starred in one additional Rod Serling teleplay — &quot;Rare Objects&quot; — a half-hour episode of the horror anthology series &quot;Night Gallery&quot;.

<text>The Vokes family were three sisters, one brother and an actor (Walter Fawdon, who changed his name to Vokes) who were popular in the pantomime theatres of 1870s London and in the United States. Their father, Frederick Strafford Thwaites Vokes (1816-1890), was a theatrical costumier and wigmaker who owned a shop at 19 Henrietta Street, Covent Garden. Their mother Sarah Jane Biddulph &quot;née&quot; Godden (1818-1897) was the daughter of Welsh-born strolling player Will Wood and his actress wife.

They were:
*Fawdon Vokes (born Walter Fawdon; 1844–1904), actor
*Fred Vokes (1846–1888), actor and dancer
*Jessie Vokes (1848–1884), actress and dancer
*Rosina Vokes (1854–1894), actress
*Victoria Vokes (1853–1894), actress

==History==

They made their début on Christmas night in 1861 in Edinburgh and made their London début at the Alhambra Theatre in 1862 when they were billed as &#x27;The Five Little Vokes&#x27;. First as the &quot;Vokes Children&quot; and later the &quot;Vokes Family,&quot; they began to perform at music halls and at pantomimes, and by their agility and humour made the name well known to English and American theatre-goers. Early in this career, at the Lyceum Theatre, London, they danced in W. S. Gilbert&#x27;s pantomime, &quot;Harlequin Cock Robin and Jenny Wren&quot;. They first appeared in the popular &quot;The Belles of the Kitchen&quot; on 27 February 1869 at the Standard Theatre in London. They made their Paris debut in August 1870 at the Théâtre du Châtelet where they were an immediate success, but with the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War it became unsafe to remain and they left the city with just a few hours notice.

The piece that most successfully carried an audience by storm was &quot;The Belles of the Kitchen&quot;, in which the Vokes family made its debut in the United States at the Union Square Theatre in New York on 15 April 1872. The family then embarked on a six month tour of the United States before returning to Britain where in October 1872 they performed &quot;Fun in a Fog&quot;. They returned to New York in April 1873 at Niblo&#x27;s Garden and remained in America for the next year and nine months before returning to England. Their next season in America was at the Fifth Avenue Theatre in New York where they remained for three months. The Vokes family returned to the USA without Rosina Vokes in April 1881 when they appeared at the Globe Theatre in Boston and returned to England in June 1882 but without Fred Vokes; the family returned to the USA in Autumn 1882. They made their last appearance in New York at the Mount Morris Theatre in Harlem in January 1883, returning to England (again without brother Fred) in June 1883.

From 1868 to 1879 (with the exception of 1873, when they were touring abroad) the family were regular performers in the annual pantomime at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane under the management of F. B. Chatterton until the new manager Augustus Harris found them to be too old-fashioned having never updated their dancing routines and too demanding, while they considered him a tyrant.

Fred and two of his sisters are buried in Brompton Cemetery, London.

The Vokeses through their mother&#x27;s brother, actor William F. Wood (1799-1855), were first cousins of American actress Rose Wood Morrison, who was the maternal grandmother of Hollywood starlets Constance Bennett and Joan Bennett.

This familial connection and an overview of the Vokes&#x27; lives is featured in Joan Bennett&#x27;s memoir, &quot;The Bennett Playbill&quot; published in 1970.

<text>Kenneth John Read (born November 6, 1955) is a former World Cup alpine ski racer from Canada. He was a specialist in the downhill and a two-time Olympian. He won five World Cup races during his ten-year international career, all in downhill.

Read grew up in Vancouver, Kingston, and Calgary, and currently resides in Calgary and Canmore. He is the father of World Cup alpine racers Erik and Jeffrey Read.

==Ski racing==
Read was a member of the Canadian alpine ski team from 1973 to 1983, competing for nine seasons on the FIS Alpine Ski World Cup. He competed in two Olympic Winter Games and two FIS Alpine World Ski Championships. A lifelong Calgary resident, Read was part of the &quot;Crazy Canucks&quot;, the Canadian downhill team of the late 1970s and early 1980s, that consistently challenged the Europeans with a daring racing style. Canadian Corner, a section of the Lauberhorn near Wengen in Switzerland - the heavily twisting curve at the left-hand transition to the Alpweg is named after the Crazy Canucks, as both Dave Irwin and Ken Read fell here in 1976.

Read&#x27;s first World Cup top ten finish came in his first season on the World Cup Tour in January 1975 in a combined event at Kitzbühel.

The following season, he achieved a Canadian first, becoming the first Canadian male to win a World Cup event in any sport - summer or winter.

On December 7, 1975, in the opening downhill of the 1975-76 World Cup Tours, he placed 1st in the Criterium de la Premiere Neige at Val-d&#x27;Isère, France. This was also a competition for North American men, as a first win in World Cup downhill. Read led four Canadians to finish in the top ten.

Read went on to win four more World Cup downhill races and his point total for the 1980 season placed him second in the downhill final standings. He was the first non-European to win both the Austrian downhill Hahnenkamm at Kitzbühel, and the Swiss race Lauberhorn at Wengen. These two victories complemented his 1978 win at Les Houches near Chamonix, France, in the Arlberg-Kandahar, ski racing&#x27;s oldest classic event. Another victory in January 1979 at Morzine was disallowed because of a non-conforming suit due to a manufacturing flaw. His outstanding season in 1980 was marred by an unfortunate binding release, just fifteen seconds into the Olympic downhill where he was considered the gold-medal favourite.

==Honours==
Read was named Canada&#x27;s Athlete of the Year in 1978 (Northern Star Award, formerly the Lou Marsh Award) and Canadian Male Amateur Athlete of the Year in 1980. In 1991 he was made a Member of the Order of Canada Canada&#x27;s highest civilian honour. He was inducted into Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame in 1985, into Canada&#x27;s Skiing Hall of Fame (Honour Roll of Canadian Skiing) in 1986, and to the International Ski Racing Hall of Fame in 2010. Along with his four teammates, the Crazy Canucks were inducted into Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame in 2006.

==After racing==
In his post-competitive years, Read has had an enormous impact on sport in Canada and worldwide. A testament to this continued work to advance Canadian sport was recognized by &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; naming Read to their &quot;Power List&quot; for three successive years in 2005, 2006 and 2007.

Following his retirement from competition in 1983, Read became a broadcaster with CBC TV Sports and a columnist. He also launched the &quot;Breath of Life&quot; Ski Challenge, which, over the next 23 years raised over $3.8 million for cystic fibrosis research. Two movies have been produced covering the careers of the Crazy Canucks: the documentary &quot;The Dream Never Dies&quot; (1980) and a TV movie called &quot;Crazy Canucks&quot; (2004), which is based on a novel he and Matthew Fisher wrote called &quot;White Circus&quot; (1987).

From June 2002 to July 2008 he served as President &amp; CEO of Alpine Canada Alpin, the National Sport Organization for alpine and para-alpine skiing in Canada. Under his direction, the organization was transformed with athletic results (record performances in 2007 and 2008), strong financial performance and innovative strategies. Canada attained the highest ranking on the FIS World Cup from 14th (2002) to 6th (2008), fully integrated the alpine skiing disabled program (Canadian Para-Alpine Ski Team), which was ranked #1 in the world, secured the finances of the organization including a substantial reserve fund for future athlete development, created a long-range athlete development plan (Aim-2-Win) and published a long-range strategic plan. Over this six-year period, under his leadership Alpine Canada established three National Training Centres, worked closely with Winsport Canada to establish a new glacier training venue (Camp Green at Farnham Glacier), established a snow testing lab, was a key leader within the group of sports leaders than established &quot;Own the Podium&quot; which enabled Canadian winter sport to take top spot (by gold medal ranking) at the 2010 Olympic Winter Games (Note: Own the Podium was the phrase used by Alpine Canada in the development of their Strategic Plan in 2003 and was loaned to the founding group) and established numerous athlete development programs to create a high-performance stream for athletes at all levels.

After resigning from Alpine Canada in July 2008, he moved to the Alberta Alpine Ski Association to work with younger athletes and athlete development programs, between September 2008 and May 2010. In May 2010 Read was named director, Winter Sport for Own The Podium (OTP), Canada&#x27;s high-performance program supporting athletes and National Sport Organizations in the Olympic and Paralympic Games, resigning in April 2013. In this period, Canadian winter sport moved into the #1 position for two years in both gold medal and total medal count, topping out with 19 gold medals and 37 total medals in 2012 as ranked by World Championship results.

Read has been active within Canadian and international sport for over 40 years, initially as the founding chair of the Canadian Olympic Association Athletes Council and subsequently, a member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) Athletes&#x27; Commission (1985–1998). He served as Chef de Mission for the 1992 Canadian Team to Barcelona, where the Canadian Team won 18 medals including a record 7 gold medals. In 1988, Read was named to the International Ski Federation&#x27;s (FIS) Alpine Committee Executive Board, overseeing the discipline of alpine skiing. In 2007 he was nominated to chair the FIS Youth and Children&#x27;s Coordination Group and Alpine Youth and Children&#x27;s committee, to re-organize youth development programs for the International Ski Federation. This included Chairing the annual FIS Youth Seminar, attending FIS Alpine Junior World Ski Championships and codifying rules and organization for children&#x27;s events world-wide. In June/2022, Read retired from all FIS committee work and was named an &quot;Honorary Member&quot; of both the Alpine Executive Board and the Youth and Children&#x27;s committee, in recognition for exemplary work on behalf of athletes and the FIS.

Between October 2006 and July 2014, Read was a member of the ownership group of the Mount Norquay ski resort in Banff National Park. He resides in Calgary with his wife Lynda (née Robbins, a former racer with Canadian Alpine Ski Team) and three sons, all of whom competed in alpine skiing. Two are members of the Canadian Alpine Ski Team, Erik Read and Jeffrey Read. team. He is an alumnus of the Ottawa Ski Club and Lake Louise Ski Club. The Read family are members of the Banff Alpine Racers, located at Banff Mount Norquay, Alberta.

==Popular culture==
The National Film Board produced several short films and features about the Crazy Canucks, shot during the 1975-76 season.

His World Cup season in 1979-80 was profiled in William Johnston&#x27;s Genie Award-nominated documentary film &quot;The Dream Never Dies&quot;.

In the 2006 episode of &quot;Corner Gas&quot; titled &quot;Physical Credit&quot;, Oscar meets with Ken Read to try to persuade him to create an Olympic medal category higher than gold. Read responds that the other countries wouldn&#x27;t agree to it. Oscar says the old Ken Read would have done it, the Crazy Canuck Ken Read. Read responds that he&#x27;s not crazy anymore, with Oscar acknowledging it and then claiming that he is now useless.

A made for TV movie about the Crazy Canucks was produced by Randy Bradshaw of Alberta Film Works. It aired on the CTV Network in February 2010.

<doc id="1312584" wikidata="Q246711" url="?curid=1312584" title="The Gift (2000 film)">
<text>The Gift is a 2000 American supernatural thriller film directed by Sam Raimi, and starring Cate Blanchett, Keanu Reeves, Giovanni Ribisi, Hilary Swank, Katie Holmes, and Greg Kinnear. It centers on a single mother in rural Georgia who becomes involved in a local missing person case after she experiences a psychic vision. The screenplay was written by Billy Bob Thornton and Tom Epperson based on the alleged psychic experiences of Thornton&#x27;s mother.
==Plot==
In Brixton, Georgia, widow Annie Wilson is a clairvoyant who has visions of her late grandmother. Annie offers psychic readings to locals to support herself and her three sons. She frequently helps locals including Buddy Cole, an emotionally unstable young man who works at an auto repair shop, and Valerie Barksdale, a woman who is currently in an abusive marriage. Valerie&#x27;s husband Donnie has repeatedly threatened Annie and her three children because Annie advised Valerie to leave him due to his abuse.

Jessica King, the fiancée of the school principal, Wayne Collins, disappears. When Annie receives a vision that Jessica has been killed and her body thrown into a pond, she informs local sheriff Pearl Johnson. Despite his skepticism, Johnson searches the pond at the home of Donnie and Valerie Barksdale. The police find Jessica&#x27;s body in the pond and Donnie is arrested for her murder.

While giving Annie a lift home, Buddy bursts into tears. She gives him a washcloth that belonged to her husband. Buddy wipes his face and does not give it back. Buddy hates his father and later tries to explain to Annie why, but Annie is preoccupied with the finding of Jessica&#x27;s body and does not listen. That evening, Buddy&#x27;s mother calls Annie for help, as Buddy has tied his father to a chair. Buddy sets his father on fire, and it is revealed that Buddy&#x27;s father sexually abused him as a child. Buddy is arrested and taken to a mental hospital.

At Donnie&#x27;s trial, it is revealed that he had an affair with Jessica. He is convicted of Jessica&#x27;s murder and sent to prison. Later, Annie receives more visions revealing that Donnie is innocent and that someone else wants to kill her. She asks prosecutor David Duncan to reopen the case. After Duncan declines, Annie threatens to reveal that he had an affair with Jessica, which she witnessed. Duncan attempts to bribe Annie in exchange for her silence, but Annie refuses.

Annie tells Wayne that Donnie is not the murderer, but that Duncan will not reopen the investigation. At Wayne&#x27;s suggestion, he and Annie drive out to the pond at night, where Annie has a vision showing Wayne is actually the murderer. Wayne confesses that he was angry after discovering Jessica was cheating on him with multiple other men including Donnie. Wayne attempts to kill Annie by striking her in the head with a flashlight, but Buddy appears and knocks him out. Annie and Buddy lock the unconscious Wayne in the trunk of Annie&#x27;s car. Buddy tells Annie that he escaped from the mental hospital and hands her the washcloth she had previously given him to wipe her tears.

The two drive to the police station. Buddy waits in the car while she enters the station. When she returns with the police, Buddy has disappeared. When Annie explains what happened at the pond, Johnson informs her that Buddy died by suicide earlier that day. Annie reaches into her pocket and pulls out the washcloth Buddy returned for her. Annie returns home and looks at photographs of her late husband Ben that her oldest son holds as he falls asleep each night. The next morning, she and her sons are at his graveside.

On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 58% based on 123 reviews, with an average score of 5.90/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;With a reported budget of around 10 million, The Gift is obviously a labor of love for those involved. Unfortunately, the A-list cast can&#x27;t prevent the movie from becoming a by-the-numbers whodunit with an ending that&#x27;s all but unsatisfactory.&quot; On Metacritic it has a score of 62% based on reviews from 29 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B on a scale of A to F.

Roger Ebert gave the film 3 out of 4, and called it &quot;Ingenious in its plotting, colorful in its characters, taut in its direction and fortunate in possessing Cate Blanchett.&quot;
Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote: &quot;Raimi&#x27;s flair for rich atmospherics — expertly abetted by cinematographer Jamie Anderson (Grosse Pointe Blank) and composer Christopher Young (Wonder Boys) — and a cast that goes full throttle hold you in thrall. &quot;
Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote: &quot;Raimi eschews trendy, over-emphatic effects in favor of a straightforward approach that makes for a solid tale well told.&quot;

Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; gave it a mixed review and was critical that the &quot;Characters lean too heavily toward the Southern grotesque, and the direction the plot is heading is more predictable than it should be.&quot; Despite praising the cast, Turan wrote: &quot;Overly familiar material, even well done, cannot be made more intrinsically interesting than it is. Not even by Cate Blanchett and Keanu Reeves.&quot; A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;The picture is saved from mediocrity by Mr. Raimi&#x27;s smooth competence, and by the unusually high quality of the acting.&quot;
Curt Fields of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called it &quot;So chock-full of stereotypes as to be a filmic Southern Country Safari&quot; and advised &quot;Don&#x27;t Bother Opening This &#x27;Gift&#x27;&quot;.

===Box office===
The film grossed $12,008,642 at the U.S. box office against a production budget of $10 million.

<doc id="1312587" wikidata="Q582630" url="?curid=1312587" title="Sgt. Frog">
<text>Sgt. Frog, known in Japan as , is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Mine Yoshizaki. It was launched in &quot;Monthly Shōnen Ace&quot; in April 1999. The story follows the attempts of a platoon of frog-like alien invaders to conquer Earth. Sergeant Keroro, the titular character, is the leader of the platoon, but is at the mercy of a human family of three after being captured by them. Keroro is forced to do meaningless chores and errands for the family after his army abandons his platoon on Earth. The series was later adapted into an anime television series by Sunrise, which ran for 358 episodes from April 2004 to April 2011. A second 23-episode series was broadcast from March to September 2014. A new anime project has been announced.

The manga was released in North America by Tokyopop from March 9, 2004 to May 10, 2011 (for a total of 21 volumes), and later digitally by Viz Media since December 2014. A first English dub of the anime series aired on the Southeast Asian TV channel Animax Asia in 2008, with the title &quot;Sergeant Keroro&quot;; Funimation Entertainment released a second 78-episode English dubbed version in North America in 2009, which aired as &quot;Sgt. Frog&quot; on Crunchyroll, Funimation and later on Netflix, as well as on DVD sets. Discotek Media re-released the Funimation dub in SD Blu-ray in 2021. In 2005, the manga received the 50th Shogakukan Manga Award for the children&#x27;s manga category.

==Plot==
The Keroro Platoon is a group of five, froglike alien soldiers from Planet Keron. They mean to conquer “Pekopon” (their name for &quot;Earth&quot;) but fail every time they try. Their leader, Sergeant Keroro, is incompetent and has little interest in conquering Pekopon. Instead, he likes making plastic Gundam models, watching TV, or coming up with schemes to make money. The four other members of the platoon are: adorable but violent Private Second Class Tamama; bellicose yet tenderhearted Corporal Giroro; intelligent but mischievous Sergeant Major Kururu; and disciplined but traumatized Lance Corporal Dororo.

The largest obstacle in the way of their mission is the Hinata Family, who must take care of the Keroro Platoon due to the Keron Army deserting the latter on Earth. Keroro is kept busy with manual labor and constant abuse, primarily from the family daughter, Natsumi. Each member of the platoon finds himself in the care of a human: Giroro&#x27;s is Natsumi Hinata, whom he falls in love with; Keroro&#x27;s is Fuyuki Hinata, who considers the sergeant his only true friend; Kururu&#x27;s is Mutsumi Saburo, who&#x27;s just as mischievous as him; Dororo&#x27;s is Koyuki Azumaya, a fellow ninja; and Tamama&#x27;s is Momoka Nishizawa, who&#x27;s just as bipolar as him. All are tied to the Hinatas in some way throughout the events in the anime and manga.

==Media==

===Manga===

&quot;Sgt. Frog&quot; is published in Japan by Kadokawa Shoten, serialized in the magazine &quot;Monthly Shōnen Ace&quot;, and was published in English by Tokyopop. The manga, first aimed at the older audience (teens/adults) from the first to the seventh volume, was toned down after the anime adaption started (since the TV series was a family show). However, the manga still maintains suggestive comedy that only the more mature audiences understand in present volumes. Tokyopop initially held the American rights to the &quot;Sgt. Frog&quot; manga until 2011 when the company ceased operations. By the time their publication ended, they had published 21 volumes. Their release of the manga have censored nipples drawn in some scenes, in order to get away from the OT (Older teen) rating and maintaining its Teen rating. Viz Media relicensed the manga for digital release on December 16, 2014.

To commemorate the 20th anniversary of the series, the November issue of &quot;Shōnen Ace&quot; announced the launching of a new manga titled &quot;Chō Keroro Gunsō UC: Keroro Robo Daikessen&quot; (Super Sgt. Frog Ultra Cool: Keroro Robo&#x27;s Epic Climactic Battle) on the next issue, on sale October 26, 2018. The manga is created by Yūtarō Shido, while Mine Yoshikizaki being credited as original author.

===Anime===

The anime series started airing on TV Tokyo in 2004 and ended in 2011. The anime is produced by Sunrise, NAS, and TV Tokyo and has also been aired on Animax, Cartoon Network Japan, and TXN. Seven seasons have been created during its seven-year run. Unlike the manga which is aimed at older audiences, the anime adaptation has been toned down to a level suitable for family audiences.

The anime ran almost year-round, with each season beginning in the first week of April and ending on the last week of March. The first season aired on Saturdays, but the show was moved to Fridays for the second and third seasons. The show returned to Saturdays for seasons four, five and six, and the final season aired on Sundays.

The term &quot;Pokopen&quot;, and &quot;Pokopenjin&quot; are both derogatory words the Japanese historically used to describe China and its people during the Sino-Japanese Wars; thus, they were changed to &quot;Pekopon&quot; &amp; &quot;Pekoponjin&quot; respectively.

The first English-language dub of the show to be released was entitled &quot;Sergeant Keroro&quot; and aired on Animax Asia, a pay TV channel received in multiple countries in Southeast Asia, including Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand. It premiered in 2008.

In the United States, ADV had previously announced they had acquired exclusive rights to an English dub of &quot;Sgt. Frog&quot; (for $408,000). However, on July 4, 2008, it was announced that rights to the English release were transferred to Funimation Entertainment.

ADV Films had originally added a brief teaser page to their website, announcing their licensing of the anime. The site turned to static before playing a short clip of Keroro dancing to &quot;Afro Gunso,&quot; then leaving the message &quot;hacked by the frog.&quot; This was followed by a press release from ADV on November 20, 2006, stating that they had licensed all Sgt. Frog properties (except the manga, which was already licensed by Tokyopop) for the US. It was once confirmed that the anime dub would be released on DVD in the United States in February 2007. However, ADV Films had never confirmed a release date. ADV announced at the 2007 San Diego Comic-Con that the US release date had been delayed because of TV negotiations but would not comment on which networks they were talking to. In a DVD included with the December issue of Newtype USA was an English-language trailer for Sgt. Frog released by ADV, with voices for Keroro (said to be voiced by Vic Mignogna), Natsumi, Fuyuki, Aki, and the narrator. ADV was 90% done on getting a deal with the show, though they created a separate team to work specifically on it that included people from Summit Entertainment (the company that worked with 4Kids Entertainment during the time they had Pokémon). They had dubbed three episodes, but they were dubbed three times because ADV created three different pilot-packages for television to see which one worked the best. They made an otaku/fan pilot, a mass-market pilot, and a kids&#x27; pilot. They received positive responses from three different networks. Cartoon Network liked the mass-market pilot, while Nickelodeon liked the kids&#x27; pilot. Nickelodeon told them that they would air the show if ADV got the merchandising rights. However, as of July 4, 2008, the English license for the first 51 episodes of the Sgt. Frog anime was transferred to Funimation Entertainment through a deal with Sojitz.

Funimation released a dubbed version of episode 12B as a test on YouTube to be reviewed by the viewers. Many instances of regional name changes were observed; Natsumi is renamed Natalie, and Giroro&#x27;s cat was renamed &quot;Mr. Furbottom,&quot; (despite being female). Additionally, the word Pekopon was changed to Planet Wuss, Pekoponians were referred to as Wussians, Keron was changed to Frogulon and Keronians were called Frogulonians respectively. The extra-terrestrial frogs&#x27; names remained the same as the Japanese version, though shortened by one syllable (e.g. Keroro changed to Kero, Tamama to Tama). The test episode had mixed reviews by fans involving the voice acting, jokes, and name changes.

At Otakon 2009, the first five episodes of &quot;Sgt. Frog&quot; were screened, where the original versions of the various names that were changed were used. The voice actor for Sergeant Keroro in the test video, Chris Cason, was swapped out for Sergeant Major Kululu&#x27;s test actor, Todd Haberkorn. Kululu was changed to Chuck Huber, and the narrator also appears to have been changed. FUNimation stated at their panel that they were going to keep the anime as similar as possible to its Japanese counterpart, and claimed to only change references from Japanese pop culture (save for those Americans were already familiar with) to references from American pop culture. Those present at the showing seemed to enjoy the changes, and the reception of the official dub was very positive. On February 19, 2011, Funimation announced at Katsucon that they had licensed more episodes of Sgt. Frog.

According to Funimation, as of February 2013, the English dub of &quot;Sgt. Frog&quot; is &quot;now on hiatus&quot;.

On July 31, 2009, Funimation added the first 4 dubbed episodes of the series to their online video portal. After a considerable delay following between the release of the first dubbed episodes, Funimation began making dubbed episodes other than the first 4 available on the portal. Currently, the first 51 subtitled episodes are available on the Funimation video portal and Hulu. The 51 dubbed episodes later expired, although they were all later placed back on the portal and on Hulu. The show is rated TV-PG on the DVDs and on Hulu. Unlike the other versions released outside Japan, the US version remains uncut.

The episode distribution scheme has been slightly changed from the Japanese Region 2 release. Although the first 51 episodes are known as &quot;Season 1&quot; in Japan, Funimation has divided the episodes into a &quot;Season 1&quot; and a &quot;Season 2&quot;. The Season 1 Part 1 DVD set was released September 22, 2009. It contains episodes 1 through 13, Season 1 Part 2 was released on November 24, 2009, and contains episodes 14 through 26. Season 2 Part 1 was released on January 26, 2010, containing episodes 27–39. In addition, Season 2 Part 2 was released on March 30, 2010, containing episodes 40–51. The first two boxsets were re-released into one Season 1 set on March 29, 2011. The complete Season 2 set followed up on April 26, 2011. Season 3 Part 1 was released to DVD by Funimation beginning on July 26, 2011, containing episodes 52–65. Season 3 Part 2 was released to DVD on August 16, 2011, containing episodes 66–78. A complete Season 3 boxset containing episodes 52-78 was released on November 13, 2012. On all of the box sets, it states, &quot;from the creators of the Gundam series&quot;. This is relatively incorrect because Sunrise did not create the Gundam series, they produced it, so it should say &quot;from the studio that brought you Gundam&quot;. The creator of Gundam is Yoshiyuki Tomino. After the Funimation home video sets went out of print, Discotek Media re-licensed the home video rights.

All three seasons were available on Netflix streaming as of December 2011; however, the first two seasons, and the first half of the third, were removed without warning in January 2013, before the series was completely removed in April of the same year.

On January 7, 2014, it was announced that a new Flash anime television series entitled &quot;Keroro&quot; would premiere on Animax on March 22 of that year. Haruki Kasugamori is the director of the series at Sunrise and the animation studio Gathering is providing assistance with the animation. The series airs during the programming block, Keroro Hour, which airs both the series and reruns of Sgt. Frog. The series features new character designs and includes the characters, New Keroro, Tomosu Hinohara, and Myō Kaneami, all of which were originally manga-only characters. The opening to the series is &quot;Keroro☆Popstar&quot; (ケロロ☆ポップスター), performed by Mayumi Gojo. The flash anime ended on September 6 of the same year, with a total of 23 episodes.

On April 1, 2024, it was announced through a video that the series would receive a new anime project produced by Bandai Namco Pictures in commemoration of the anime&#x27;s 20th anniversary. Many of the original cast are reprising their roles.

<text>The J-series is Honda&#x27;s fourth production V6 engine family introduced in 1996, after the C-series, which consisted of three dissimilar versions. The J-series engine was designed in the United States by Honda engineers. It is built at Honda&#x27;s Anna, Ohio, and Lincoln, Alabama, engine plants.

The J-series is a 60° V6 unlike Honda&#x27;s existing 90° C-series engines. Also unlike the C series, the J-series was specifically and only designed for transverse mounting. It has a shorter bore spacing (), shorter connecting rods and a special smaller crankshaft than the C-series to reduce its size. All J-series engines are gasoline-powered, use four valves per cylinder, and have a single timing belt that drives the overhead camshafts. VTEC variable valve timing is used on almost all applications, with exceptions being the J30AC and J35Y8 (which use Variable Timing Control [VTC] instead).

One unique feature of some J-family engine models is Honda&#x27;s Variable Cylinder Management (VCM) system. Initially, the system turns off one bank of cylinders under light loads, turning the V6 into a straight-3. Some versions were able to turn off one bank of cylinders or one cylinder on opposing banks, allowing for three-cylinder use under light loads and four-cylinder use under medium loads.

==J25==
The J25A was used only in the Japanese domestic Inspire/Saber models. The J25A displaced . Its bore and stroke was . The J25A used a 10.5:1 compression ratio and was a SOHC VTEC design. Output was at 6200 rpm and of torque at 4600 rpm. It had a variable intake manifold to optimize torque output across varying engine speeds and engine response.

==J30==
The J30A displaces and is a SOHC VTEC design. Its bore and stroke is . Output for the J30A1 was at 5500 rpm and of torque at 4800 rpm. The J30A4 pushed output to and using a three-way VTEC system, a higher (10.0:1) compression ratio and a novel exhaust manifold cast as one piece with the cylinder head. It weighs nearly less and is an inch shorter than J30A1. This version was on the Ward&#x27;s 10 Best Engines list for 2003 and 2004. The IMA hybrid version was on the list for 2005. In 2006 Honda created the J30A5 to mark the 30th anniversary of the Accord. It boosted output to (SAE Net 08/04) and (SAE Net 08/04) of torque. According to Honda, horsepower gains were achieved with improvements to the airflow of the intake and exhaust system.

<doc id="1312602" wikidata="Q1346413" url="?curid=1312602" title="Izrael Poznański">
<text>Izrael Kalman Poznański (25 August 1833–28 April 1900) was a Polish-Jewish businessman, textile magnate and philanthropist in Łódź, Congress Poland (part of the Russian Empire), and the husband of Eleonora Hertz Poznańska. The mausoleum of Izrael and his wife, Eleonora Hertz, on the New Jewish Cemetery has been described as &quot;probably the largest Jewish grave monument in the world&quot;. The mausoleum and mosaic covering the inside of the dome were restored in 1993.

Together with Ludwik Geyer and Karol Scheibler, he was counted among the three &quot;Kings of Cotton&quot; in Łódź. His complex of mills in Łódź, Poland, have been turned into the Manufaktura mixed-use development, including a mall, 3 museums, a multiplex cinema, a hotel, and restaurants.

==Life==
===Youth===


Poznański was the grandson of the merchant Izaak Poznański from the town of Kowal in Kuyavia and the youngest son of the merchant Kalman (who was given the surname Poznański) and Małka Lubińska. In 1825, the 40-year-old Kalman Poznański, with his wife, children, farmhand and servant, settled in Aleksandrów Łódzki. In 1834, the family, now quite wealthy, moved from Aleksandrów to Łódź, where the father acquired the right to trade in textiles, notably cotton and linen, and built the first two-story tenement house in the Old Town, where he also established a store selling fabrics and spices.

In Łódź, Izrael Poznański graduated from elementary school and the so-called junior high school. The future multi-millionaire entrepreneur learned from scratch. As a teenager, he collected scrap material using a rickety cart pulled by a run-down horse (later, to enhance his rags-to-riches tale, the rich man claimed that he did not have a horse at the time, and that he instead harnessed dogs to the cart). At the age of seventeen, in 1851, he married Leonia Hertz, the daughter of Mojżesz Hertz, a wealthy merchant from Warsaw. Izrael was described then as a &quot;master of the weaving profession&quot; bringing an estate worth 500 rubles to the marriage. His wife, Leonia, brought him a dowry selling goods in Warsaw.

===Career===
In December 1852, Izrael Poznański took over the management of the family business from his father, and gradually expanded it over the next half-century. In 1859 the gross output of his plant was valued at 6,000 zlotys; by 1868, this had increased to 23,000 rubles. By 1871 Poznański had begun buying up plots at 17–23 Ogrodowa Street in order to build a new grand industrial complex; the following year, the first factory facility was erected on the site, a high-output cotton mill with some 200 mechanical looms.

Subsequently, Poznański rapidly expanded his plant, as described by the following timeline:
* 1874–75 - enlargement of the weaving mill, construction of a bleacher and a finishing plant
* 1877 - construction of a huge building for a spinning mill
* 1878 - own mechanical workshop
* 1880 - factory hospital (St. Joseph Hospital, currently named after Radliński) at ul. Drewnowska 75
* 1885–90 - &quot;Szpital Orozakonnych&quot;, currently the Department of Endocrinology of the University Clinical Hospital no. WAM - Central Veterans Hospital at ul. 1/3 Sterling
* 1887 - dye shop, finishing shop and central boiler room
* 1890, 1895 - other weaving mills
* 1893 - iron foundry
* 1895–1897 - large cotton warehouses at the Old Cemetery

This impressive complex (shot by master Polish photographer Bronisław Wilkoszewski for his album &quot;Views of the City of Łódź&quot; in 1895 and illustrated here) still stands. Built nearly entirely of orange brick, it is entered from the street through a large gate resembling a grandiose triumphal arch. To the right behind the entry is the building housing the offices of the company directors, which preserves its original marble interior. The main building (dating from 1877–78) stretches 170 meters to the left behind the entrance. The corner towers contain staircase, ventilation shafts, and water tanks for fire relief. It originally contained five-aisled production halls, and functioned as an industrial complex until World War II before being nationalized under the Communist regime. After some years of neglect it has now been transformed into a multiplex cinema, shopping center, and hotel, called Manufaktura. Poznański&#x27;s own palatial residence, next door, also still stands. 

On October 29, 1889, the family business was transformed into a joint-stock company, like other cotton enterprises in Łódź. The official name of the plants was Towarzystwo Akcyjne Wyrobów Cottonowych IK Poznańskiego in Łódź (Poznański Cotton Products Joint Stock Company in Łódź). The expanding plants of Poznański employed more and more workers over the years: in 1865, there were some 70 workers; by 1879, this had grown to 426 workers; and in 1906, the firm employed around 6,800 people.

In 1883, a strike broke out at Poznański&#x27;s factory as a result of deteriorating working conditions. At that time, the average workday for a laborer lasted 16 hours, from 5:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. That year, in addition, Izrael Poznański mandated that employees also work on public holidays, beginning on August 15, the Feast of Our Lady of Herbs. Any employee who disobeyed was fined up to 3 rubles. Protesters were subdued by the police and a group of Cossacks, and in all 50 people were removed from the factory. In February 1884, Poznański fined the workers who protested against working on the Feast of Our Lady of Candlemas. One of the workers was assaulted. In 1891, the report of the factory inspector documented that Poznański paid the lowest wages of any industrialist in Łódź, and the penalties that his weavers faced if they broke regulations were the most severe. During the Łódź revolt in 1892, Poznański set up a temporary investigative office at his factory, where several striking workers were humiliated, beaten, and then fired from the factory without proof of their guilt.

In 1884, Izrael Poznański purchased the property of Nieznanowice in the then-Włoszczowa district, where he built a starch factory to supply his textile factories in Łódź. The new plant employed 140 workers. He also built a two-story palace nearby modeled on neoclassical mansions. In the summer of 1889, a fire destroyed this factory completely, and losses in uninsured movable property were estimated at 60,000 rubles. In 1910, the Poznańskis sold the palace and the rest of the property of Niepanowice to the Karski family.

Izrael Poznański died on April 28, 1900, and two days later he was buried in the family tomb in the New Jewish Cemetery in Łódź. At the time of his death, he had amassed a fortune of 11 million rubles. World War I brought great losses to Poznański&#x27;s enterprise. Successive generations managed the company until the 1930s, when the indebted business was taken over by Banca Commerciale Italiana.

===Philanthropy===
A clear change can be observed during Poznański&#x27;s life story: initially he was known as a ruthless employer, neglecting the safety of employees. In his factories, there were numerous accidents resulting in disability or death. However, towards the end of his life he became involved in charity, building orphanages, schools for the poor and hospitals. He contributed in financing the iconostasis at the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral in Łódź, for which he was awarded the Order of St. Stanislaus by the Imperial Russian authorities. In March 1895 he was awarded the Order of Saint Anna. In 1891, he financed a terracotta floor for the Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, on pl. Kościelny in Łódź, made by the German company Villeroy &amp; Boch from Mettlach. In the mid-1890s, he also financed ⅓ the cost of building a large organ in the church. On February 18, 1895, he notarised 100,000 rubles to transform the Higher School of Crafts in Łódź into a technical school. In 1899-1900 he was the president of the Łódź Jewish Charity Society, which he founded, among other organizations.

==Family==
Poznański and his wife Leonia had seven children:
* 4 sons - Ignacy, Herman, Karol and Maurycy
* 3 daughters - Anna (Ajdla, later wife of Jakub Hertz), Joanna Natalia (later wife of Zygmunt Lewiński), and Felicja (Fajga, died in infancy)

==Cultural Depictions==
* The figures of Max Ashkenazi from the novel &quot;The Brothers Ashkenazi&quot; by Israel Joshua Singer and Shaya Mendelsohn from &quot;The Promised Land&quot; by Władysław Reymont are partly modeled on Izrael Poznański.
* In May 2016, the Grand Theater in Łódź announced a competition to write an opera about Izrael Poznański, &quot;Man from Manufaktura&quot; to a libretto by Małgorzata Sikorska-Miszczuk. On January 5, 2017, the first public performance of competition excerpts from the opera took place. The winner of the competition was Rafał Janiak. The world premiere of his work, originally planned for November 2018, took place on February 2, 2019.

<text>Figaro-Polka op. 320 is a French polka written by Johann Strauss II in 1867 and was dedicated to Hippolyte de Villemessant, who was the editor-in-chief of the Paris newspaper &quot;Le Figaro&quot;.

De Villemessant, the dedicatee of the &#x27;Figaro-Polka&#x27;, championed Strauss in his newspaper. Strauss acknowledged de Villemessant&#x27;s role in his Paris success and therefore dedicated the new polka to the latter. Its premiere was on 30 July 1867 at the Cercle International building at the Paris International Exhibition with the orchestra of Benjamin Bilse.

The polka is in the &#x27;French-polka&#x27; style. The piece begins with chords in F major, and proceeds at a relaxed pace, with a lively finale.

<text>Stephen Gregory Podborski (born July 25, 1957) is a Canadian former World Cup and Olympic downhill ski racer.

==Racing career==
Born in Toronto, Ontario, Podborski started skiing at the age of two and a half at Craigleith Ski Club in Craigleith, Ontario. He joined the Canadian alpine ski team in 1973 and made his World Cup debut in 1974 at age 17, scoring two top ten finishes in his first World Cup season. He was due to make his Olympic debut at the 1976 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck, however he ruptured two knee ligaments in an accident just before the Games. He was a member of the Crazy Canucks, and won the bronze medal in the downhill at the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid.

In 1982, Podborski became the first North American to win the World Cup season title in downhill ski racing. In total, he won eight World Cup downhill races, including the notorious Hahnenkamm in Kitzbühel, Austria, which he won twice (1981–82). In 34 more races, he finished in the top 10. He retired following the 1984 season at age 26. Podborski was on the podium in World Cup races 20 times in approximately 100 races with 8 victories.

Erik Guay is the only other male Canadian ski racer to win a World Cup season title (Super-G, 2011) (Nancy Greene won two overall World Cup crystal globes as well as two discipline titles in giant slalom) with 5 World Cup career wins, 1 in Downhill. Ken Read came close to winning the World Cup Downhill title (downhill, 1980) finishing second.

Podborski&#x27;s racing career and successes led to many accolades, including being honoured with the Queen&#x27;s Golden Jubilee Medal in 2002 and the Queen&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee Medal in 2012.

==National and Provincial honours==
In 1982, Podborski was made an Officer of the Order of Canada.

Podborski was inducted to the Canadian Olympic Hall of Fame in 1985, Canadian Ski Hall of Fame in 1986 and Canadian Sport Hall of Fame in 1987.

In 2006, Podborski was inducted into the Ontario Sport Hall of Fame and his former team the Crazy Canucks were honoured on Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame.

==After racing==
Podborski participated in Prince Edward&#x27;s charity television special &quot;The Grand Knockout Tournament&quot; in 1987.

He was on the bid committee for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, responsible for international relations; he also worked as a sports newscaster in Salt Lake City. He worked as a commentator for American television for three Winter Olympics (2002–2010). He covered freestyle skiing for NBC in 2006 and 2002, and snowboarding for Olympics on CBS in 1998. Podborski also covered the Olympic Games in Athens for NBC doing play by Play with Paul Sherwen for Cycling as well as play by play for Tae Kwon Do.
Podborski&#x27;s endeavours also include senior leadership roles in the corporate and non-profit sectors. In 2003, Podborski joined the Telus telecommunications firm, leading to a position of National Director, Community Sports and remained with the organisation until June 2017.

Podborski was named the Chef de Mission for the Canadian Olympic Team for the Winter Olympic Games in Sochi in 2014.

In June 2017, Podborski became President and CEO of Parachute, a Canadian charitable organisation which focuses on injury prevention. Podborski describes his move into the injury prevention field as a natural extension of his athletic training: &quot;I was the guy who wanted to win, and you can’t win when you fall and get hurt. I was an early, dedicated fan of preventing injury.&quot;
Podborski retired as CEO in May 2019 but continues to serve on Parachute&#x27;s Board of Directors.

<doc id="1312613" wikidata="Q7956142" url="?curid=1312613" title="WTEN">
<text>WTEN (channel 10) is a television station licensed to Albany, New York, United States, serving the Capital District as an affiliate of ABC. Owned by Nexstar Media Group, it is a sister station to Fox affiliate WXXA-TV (channel 23), which is operated under a shared services agreement (SSA) with Mission Broadcasting. The two stations share studios on Northern Boulevard in Albany&#x27;s Bishop&#x27;s Gate section; WTEN&#x27;s transmitter is located on the Helderberg Escarpment west of New Salem.

WTEN formerly operated full-time satellite WCDC-TV (channel 19) in Adams, Massachusetts, with transmitter located on Mount Greylock, the highest peak in Massachusetts. WCDC-TV&#x27;s signal covered portions of western Massachusetts and southern Vermont that received a marginal to non-existent over-the-air signal from WTEN, although there was significant overlap between the two stations&#x27; contours otherwise. WCDC-TV was a straight simulcast of WTEN; the only acknowlegement of the station&#x27;s existence came during Federal Communications Commission (FCC)-mandated hourly legal identifications. Aside from its transmitter, WCDC-TV did not maintain a physical presence in Adams. Nexstar planned to shut down WCDC-TV on December 1, 2017, via the FCC&#x27;s spectrum incentive auction, but damage to the station&#x27;s transmission line forced it to end operations two weeks early on November 19.

==History==
WTEN began broadcasting on October 14, 1953, as WROW-TV on UHF channel 41. It was owned by the Hudson Valley Broadcasting Company, operating alongside WROW radio (590 AM). The two stations shared space inside a former retirement home for nuns on a farm dirt road in the town of North Greenbush, near Troy. It broadcast from a temporary transmitter in Herkimer, limiting the signal to the immediate area. The station went to full power and installed a permanent tower next to the studio a few months later.&lt;ref name=&quot;Capital Cities/ABC The Early Years: How The Minnow Swallow The WhaleP11&quot;&gt;Capital Cities/ABC The Early Years: How The Minnow Swallow The Whale, Chilton Books, 1993, page 11&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally the Capital District&#x27;s ABC affiliate.

Within their first year, the station was losing money, and on the verge of bankruptcy. By November 1954, Hudson Valley&#x27;s shareholders sold controlling interest to a New York City–based syndicate group led by legendary radio broadcaster/author Lowell Thomas and his manager/business partner Frank Smith, who became president of the company upon completion of the sale.&lt;ref name=&quot;Capital Cities/ABC The Early Years: How The Minnow Swallow The WhaleP15&quot;&gt;Capital Cities/ABC The Early Years: How The Minnow Swallow The Whale, Chilton Books, 1993, page 15&lt;/ref&gt; After the sale, the station switched its affiliation to CBS on February 1, 1955. In the spring of 1956, the station&#x27;s call letters were changed to WCDA (for &quot;Capital District Albany&quot;) and a satellite station, WCDB (channel 29) in nearby Hagaman, New York was launched to reach areas in the northern portion of the market where the main signal did not penetrate. In December 1957, Hudson Valley merged with Durham Broadcasting Enterprises, the owners of WTVD in Durham, North Carolina, to form Capital Cities Television Corporation (predecessor of Capital Cities Communications) with WCDA as its flagship station.

That same year, the call letters were changed again to WTEN when the station moved to VHF channel 10. By this time, the market had expanded to cover not only east-central New York, but also large swaths of southwestern Vermont and western Massachusetts. Not only is this market one of the largest east of the Mississippi River, but much of it is very mountainous. UHF stations have never covered large areas or rugged terrain very well. When the FCC allocated two additional VHF channels to Albany, Hudson Valley sought and received permission to move to channel 10.

Upon moving to the VHF band, the station&#x27;s transmitter was moved to Vail Mills, approximately west of Albany. This was necessary to protect both WHEC-TV/WVET-TV in Rochester and WJAR-TV in Providence, Rhode Island. But the new transmitter proved inadequate for serving the Capital District proper. The FCC eventually allowed a waiver in 1963 which let WTEN move its transmitter to Voorheesville, closer to Albany. The new transmitter, located on the Helderberg Escarpment, was on some of the highest ground in the region, giving WTEN a coverage area comparable to that of long-dominant WRGB (channel 6).

In 1966, WTEN and WROW moved to new facilities on Albany&#x27;s northside on Northern Boulevard. Channel 10 is still based there today (the WROW radio stations moved out in 1993, ten years after they were sold by Capital Cities). In 1966, the old studio in North Greenbush was burned down by an arson fire, but the station&#x27;s owner donated its old transmitter to WRPI radio.

On April 27, 1971, Capital Cities sold WTEN to Poole Broadcasting. Following its purchase of several broadcast properties from Triangle Publications, Capital Cities had to sell off two VHF stations to stay within the FCC&#x27;s limit of five stations per owner at the time. In mid-1977, Poole sold WTEN and sister stations WJRT-TV in Flint, Michigan, and WPRI-TV in Providence to Knight-Ridder, with the deal finalized in 1978. Before the sale could be completed, Knight-Ridder signed an affiliation deal with ABC, which resulted in WTEN swapping affiliations with WAST (channel 13, NBC-affiliated WNYT) on October 23, 1977, thus returning ABC to its original affiliate in the Capital District (WPRI-TV had switched to ABC from CBS that June and would eventually reaffiliate with CBS in September 1995, nine years after WTEN&#x27;s former owners, Capital Cities, completed its acquisition of ABC in January 1986). Upon Knight-Ridder&#x27;s exit from broadcasting in 1989, WTEN and sister station WKRN-TV in Nashville were sold to Young Broadcasting. Since the Young purchases of the two stations plus WTEN satellite WCDC were made through two separate deals, they were consummated more than three months apart.

WTEN signed-on its digital signal on UHF channel 26 in 2004 and began offering high definition service from the start. On October 1, 2007, Young Broadcasting launched the Retro Television Network (RTV) on a new third digital subchannel of WTEN. This was part of a test of the network with sister stations WBAY-TV in Green Bay and KRON-TV in San Francisco.

In an effort to cut costs, the company eliminated ten positions from WTEN on January 31, 2008, fueling speculation that the company might sell the station in order to pay down its financial debt. In January 2009, after failing to meet the minimum standards for listing on NASDAQ, Young Broadcasting was dropped from the exchange. One month later, on February 13, they declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The company planned to auction off its stations in a New York City bankruptcy court on July 14, 2009, but canceled the auction at the last minute. After multiple issues with RTV operations and programming, Young switched their main subchannel affiliations to ABC&#x27;s Live Well Network as part of a group deal with Young&#x27;s other stations in 2012.
On July 27, 2012, it was announced that the Capital District&#x27;s Fox affiliate, WXXA-TV, owned by Newport Television, would be sold to Shield Media, LLC (owned by White Knight Broadcasting vice president Sheldon Galloway) for $19.2 million. That company then entered into a shared services agreement with Young Broadcasting resulting in WTEN operating WXXA. On October 23, the FCC granted the transaction. The move was completed on March 23, 2013. Soon afterward, WXXA closed its studios on Corporate Circle in Albany and moved its operations to WTEN.

On June 6, 2013, Young Broadcasting announced that it would merge with Media General. The merger was approved by the FCC on November 8, after Media General shareholders approved the merger a day earlier; it was completed on November 12. More than two years later, on January 27, 2016, it was announced that the Nexstar Broadcasting Group would buy Media General for $4.6 billion. WTEN and the operations of WXXA became part of &quot;Nexstar Media Group&quot;. The acquisition resulted in Nexstar owning stations in every television market in Upstate New York; the sale was completed on January 17, 2017.

===WCDB===
In the spring of 1956, satellite station WCDB on UHF channel 29 in Hagaman was launched to reach areas in the northern portion of the market where WCDA&#x27;s main signal didn&#x27;t penetrate. This signed off in 1957 after WCDA moved its transmitter closer to Albany, making WCDB redundant even though it did provide some primary CBS coverage to Utica. The WCDB call sign would return to the air in 1978 for the student-run radio station at University at Albany. The UHF channel 29 allocation remained in the Albany market until the DTV transition in 2009; however, no other station had used the channel number since WCDB&#x27;s sign-off.

===WCDC-TV===

WCDC began broadcasting on February 5, 1954, as WMGT (&quot;Mount Greylock Television&quot;) on UHF channel 74, the highest channel number ever used by a full-power U.S. television station. WMGT began as a separate station affiliated with the DuMont network. The tower location on Mount Greylock (part of a state reserve) helped WMGT serve first as the market&#x27;s secondary affiliate of DuMont and later as a major boost to WCDA. In December 1954, WMGT moved to channel 19 extending the station&#x27;s range to the Capital District of New York State. In February 1956, it was forced off the air when a storm damaged its transmitter tower. Capital Cities bought the license and returned it to the air in 1957 under its final sign, WCDC. (The WMGT callsign is held by an NBC-affiliated station in Macon, Georgia.) After Capital Cities returned WCDC to the air and until it shut down, it served as a straight simulcast of WCDA/WTEN. Due to snow and ice build-up, a tower collapse forced WCDC off the air again in March 1983. Most cable systems on the Vermont and Massachusetts sides of the market picked up WCDC&#x27;s signal. WTEN&#x27;s various owners also leased tower space to other entities, including the Massachusetts State Police and competitor WNYT for their area translator station, as well as the area&#x27;s main NPR station, WAMC-FM.

WCDC&#x27;s digital signal on UHF channel 36 signed on nearly eighteen months before WTEN&#x27;s did in 2002. However, it did not upgrade to high definition until WTEN-DT signed-on. WCDC shut down its analog signal on channel 19 on June 12, 2009, following WTEN&#x27;s lead.

Citing declining over-the-air viewership, Nexstar Broadcasting, through the FCC&#x27;s spectrum incentive auction in April 2017, was awarded $34,558,086 to agree to take WCDC-TV off the air; at the time, it indicated that WCDC would enter a channel sharing agreement (CSA) to continue providing service to viewers. Nexstar subsequently announced that WCDC would instead go dark December 1, 2017; however, damage to the station&#x27;s transmission line in a storm would take WCDC off the air on November 19, almost two weeks earlier than scheduled. Nexstar informed the FCC that, due to insufficient time and a lack of available tower crews, the line would not be repaired before the planned shutdown date. Nexstar surrendered the WCDC-TV license for cancellation on February 12, 2018.

On December 22, 2017, WAMC entered into an agreement to purchase the Mount Greylock transmitter and tower from Nexstar for just over $1 million. Due to sitting on Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation (MDCR) land and WTEN&#x27;s lease having expired two years earlier, WAMC could have been taken off the air without purchasing the facility. WAMC owns the facility itself, but not the land beneath, which is under lease with the MDCR until 2025, and will fundraise in order to rebuild their financial reserves.

==News operation==
For most of its history, WTEN was a solid runner-up to WRGB, especially after moving its transmitter to Voorheesville. WNYT overtook WTEN for the runner-up spot by the late 1980s, and in 1992, scored its first late news victory. WTEN has generally remained at a stable second place since then, although for a period in the early 2000s, it fell back to third. At times during the 1990s and 2000s, WTEN has occasionally finished ahead of WRGB or, more recently, WNYT. In terms of Nielsen ratings, the Capital District has been one of the most competitive markets in the country, with WRGB, WTEN and WNYT waging a spirited three-way battle for first place.

In November 2009, WNYT&#x27;s newscasts slipped back to third place largely resulting from its owner Hubbard Broadcasting deciding to terminate many of its popular news team members. One notable personality let go from the NBC affiliate was Lydia Kulbida who was hired by WTEN in time to help launch the market&#x27;s only over-the-air weekday local news show at 4 (which occurred on September 21, 2009). On October 26, 2011, WTEN became the second station in Albany to upgrade its newscasts to high definition level.

As a full-time satellite of WTEN, WCDC simulcast all newscasts from its parent outlet. Although there were no separate title openings or local cut-ins provided during the broadcasts, there was coverage of Western Massachusetts and Southwestern Vermont. Since 2001, rival WNYT has been the only Capital District-based television station to operate a bureau in Western Massachusetts (located in Pittsfield). With the consolidation of WXXA with WTEN, the ABC affiliate took over production of the Fox station&#x27;s newscasts. The two stations&#x27; reporting staffs were merged immediately following the completion of Shield Media&#x27;s purchase of WXXA. On January 24, 2013, the Fox outlet dropped its separate weeknight 5 and 11 o&#x27;clock newscasts. WXXA&#x27;s weekday morning newscast (seen 7 to 9 a.m.) and nightly prime time broadcast at 10 were retained as this programming does not directly compete with local news airing on WTEN.

===Notable former on-air staff===
* Ted Knight – &quot;Windy Knight&quot; and host of &quot;The Early Show&quot; (1955-1957)
* Tim Lake – news anchor (2016–2022)
* Ryan Nobles – Anchor/reporter (2000s)

==Technical information==

===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:

WCDC carried WTEN&#x27;s two subchannels as 19.2 and 19.3 respectively, and they were carried locally in Massachusetts on the digital tier of Time Warner Cable, and later its successor, Charter Communications.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WTEN shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 10, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 26; using virtual channel 10. In 2019, during the digital television repack, WTEN moved from UHF channel 26 to UHF channel 24.

<text>The Bloch MB.160 was a fourteen-seat French airliner intended for use in the French African colonies. Three were built and two entered service with Régie Air-Afrique at the start of World War II. Developments included the Bloch MB.162 bomber which was too late for service and the Sud-Est SE.161 Languedoc, one hundred of which were built post-war.

==Development==

The first flight of the Bloch MB.160 was on 18 June 1937, piloted by André Curvale at Villacoublay, Marcel Bloch&#x27;s base.

On 20 August, now named the &quot;Lieutenant-Génin&quot;, it was one of thirteen aircraft from three countries (France, Italy and the UK) to take part in a race from France to Syria and back, flying from Istres to Damascus and returning to Paris. Nine finished, with Italian Savoia-Marchetti SM.79s in the first three places; the Bloch, piloted by Captain François, was seventh, taking 17h 38 min at an average speed of .

On 17 October the MB.160 set a new world speed record for an aircraft carrying a useful load over , averaging .

By March 1938 it had completed testing at Marignane and had returned to Villacoublay for minor aileron alterations and for some internal revision. By this time a second example was under way. As late as November 1938 one Bloch MB.160 was back for further modifications to the wing. In July 1939 the first of two delivered to Air-Afrique (only the second and third Bloch 160s appeared on the French civil register) had completed its exploration flights, with passengers, in Algeria.

Though only three MB.160s were built a development of it, the MB.161, was the pre-war prototype of the Sud-Est SE.161 Languedoc. Its first flight was in September 1939; one hundred of them were built post-war. The Languedoc had a 7% greater span, twin end plate fins and a slightly shorter fuselage. Gnome-Rhône 14N44/45 radial engines replaced the Hispano-Suizas in the prototype but production aircraft had Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1830-92 Twin Wasp radials.

The MB.162 was the final MB.160 variant, initially developed for long range flights but flown as a bomber. Like the MB.161, it had twin fins and Gnome-Rhône 14N engines. Only one was built, making its first flight on 1 June 1940.

==Design==

The all-metal Bloch MB.160 was designed to meet the needs of Régie Air-Afrique on its routes between French colonies in Africa.

It was a four engine, cantilever low wing monoplane. In plan the wing was triangular apart from elliptical tips, with sweep only on the leading edge. It had three parts, a centre section that extended just past the outer engines and carried split flaps which continued under the fuselage, and two outer sections with trailing edges largely occupied by balanced ailerons. The wing had two longerons on each side, the forward ones parallel to the leading edge and the rear at right angles to the fuselage. These were bound together in the centre section by a trellis of box-girders. The wing skin was stressed Vedal sheet, flush riveted together.

The Bloch MB.160 was powered by four Hispano-Suiza 12Xirs.1 V-12 engines. They were water-cooled with oval radiators immediately behind the propeller disc and were mounted well ahead of the leading edge, enclosed in cowlings which extended a little way aft of the leading edge. Their fuel was in centre section tanks.

It had an oval section fuselage formed by a series of frames and bulkheads, joined by longerons and covered in stressed Vedal. The four crew, two pilots, a flight engineer and a radio operator, worked together in a well-glazed cockpit linked by a corridor to the passengers&#x27; cabin. Their accommodation was configurable but the Air-Afrique layout provided &quot;chaise-longues/couchettes&quot; for ten and armchairs for four. With a pair of armchairs in the place of each &quot;chaise-longue&quot;, twenty-four passenger might have been carried. At the rear of the cabin there was a bar, toilets and, behind them, a baggage compartment.

The MB.160 had conventional empennage, with the tailplane and elevators mounted near the top of the fuselage. Together, they were tapered and round tipped; the elevators, like the rudder, had trim tabs. The latter was straight-edged and balanced. Though it extended to the keel, it was hinged non-vertically so was far enough back to clear the elevators. The fin was essentially triangular. All the rear surfaces had steel internal structures rather like those of the wing.

It had retractable conventional landing gear mounted just behind the leading edge of the wing under the inner engines and hydraulically retracting into their nacelles between the engine and the forward wing spar. This produced a track of . Each undercarriage unit carried a single low pressure wheel, equipped with a brake, between two oleo-pneumatic legs. There was a fork-mounted tailwheel.

==Variants==
;MB.160
:3 built.
;MB.161
:Prototype of the SE.161 Languedoc. Similar to MB.160 but with twin fins, Gnome-Rhône 14N44/45 radial engines and revised dimensions. 33 passengers, 100 built postwar with Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1830 Twin Wasps.
;MB.162
:Designed as long range variant of MB.160, with twin fins, shorter fuselage and Gnome-Rhône 14N. Built as a heavy bomber but only 1 completed.

<text>A metal leaf, also called composition leaf or schlagmetal, is a thin foil used for gilding and other forms of decoration. Metal leaves can come in many different shades, due to the composition of the metal within the metal leaf. Examples of this variation of shades in metal leaves can be found in Ancient Egyptian gold leaves, as the silver content within the gold leaves could make them appear bright yellow or paler shades of yellow. Some metal leaves may look like gold leaf but do not contain any real gold. This type of metal leaf is often referred to as imitation leaf.

Metal leaves are usually made of gold (including many alloys), silver, copper, aluminium, brass (sometimes called &quot;Dutch metal&quot; typically 85% Copper and 15% zinc) or palladium, as well as platinum.

== Gilding ==
Gilding is the process of applying a thin layer of metal on another surface. Goldbeating, the technique of producing metal leaves, has been known for more than 5,000 years. A small gold nugget 5 mm in diameter can be expanded to about 20,000 times its initial surface through hammering, producing a gold foil surface of about one half square meter with a thickness of 0.2–0.3 μm.

The process of gilding requires meticulous preparation, including priming surfaces and applying thin layers of adhesive before placing the gold leaf. Modern restoration projects often reapply gold leaf to maintain its brilliance and historical integrity. For example, the Church of Nossa Senhora da Conceição dos Militares in Brazil underwent conservation efforts to preserve its gilded surfaces, ensuring the continuation of its religious and artistic significance.

While mercury, vermeil, and ormolu gilding were mostly used with gold leaf, electroplating is a gilding technique that does not use leaf. The process of electroplating typically involves dipping an item into electric and heated water. Ions from minerals and metals within the water move away from the negatively charged electricity and then plate the cathode– or item&#x27;s surface that is to be plated. This was discovered in 1805 by Luigi Brugnatelli and it was later developed further by George and Henry Elkington in 1940.

== Cultural Significances ==
Known for its reflective and durable properties, gold leaf has been used to symbolize divinity, purity, and eternal life. Churches throughout history have employed metal leaf for its aesthetic and symbolic qualities, often in mosaics, domes, and religious icons.

The tradition of using gold ground in Christian art comes from Roman art, where it originally had no religious significance. Its shining quality was conceived as the light of God, underlining the spiritual nature of the figures represented and of the holy spaces. This tradition flowed throughout the centuries, as European churches used gold leaf to outline the richness and the sacredness of the domes, altars, and sculptures.

Domes are an especially salient feature faced with gold leaf. In Russian Orthodox architecture, gilded onion domes symbolize the realms of heaven and usually have theological meaning. Three domes, for example, signify the Holy Trinity, and five represent Christ and the Four Evangelists. Procedures such as applying 23.75-karat gold leaf ensure longevity and a radiating finish to maintain their visual and spiritual impact.

Vark– is a type of flavorless and edible silver leaf– is used for decoration in South Asian cuisine, as well as added for medicinal and purifying properties. It&#x27;s created through pounding metal dust onto parchment sheets and ox guts until it molds into a foil, however it was only up until the 21st century that people have started to stop using intestines.
