<text>Newry City Football Club was a Northern Irish football club founded in 1918 and dissolved in 2012. It was based in Newry, County Down and played its home matches at the Showgrounds. Club colours were blue and white. The club was relegated from the IFA Premiership in the 2010–11 season, and after narrowly missing out on promotion back to the top tier the following season, was dissolved in September 2012, when a winding up petition brought against the club by former player and manager Gerry Flynn was granted, and the club decided not to appeal the decision.

The formation of a new club called Newry City AFC was finalised in March 2013, with the club starting life in the Mid-Ulster Football League for the 2013–14 season, reaching the NIFL Championship for the 2017–18 season.

==History==
The club was originally known as Newry Town – it was renamed in 2004, two years after Newry obtained city status.

The club was formed in the autumn of 1918 and played its first season in the Newry and District League, winning its first trophy in May 1919 by beating Damolly Rovers in the final of the Newell Cup. The following season, Newry finished second in the league and joined the &#x27;more competitive and higher standard&#x27; Portadown and District League in 1921. In 1923, the club applied to join the Irish League and on 20 July 1923 the club was admitted on a unanimous vote, thus acquiring senior status.

The club played originally at the Marshes until the 1946–47 season, when a factory was built on the site and the club was compensated with £5,000. The club used this money to develop a new ground – the Showgrounds – adjacent to the Marshes, which opened at the start of the 1948–49 season.

The Irish League was suspended because of the Second World War in 1940, and Newry was not included in the temporary Northern Regional League that took its place. When the Irish League resumed in 1947, it was with twelve rather than fourteen members, Newry and Larne losing their places. Newry played instead in the Irish Intermediate League until 1954, when the league folded due to the loss of members to the Irish League B Division. Newry, along with Dundela and Carrick Rangers failed to be accepted as B Division members and instead joined the Irish Alliance League. Newry were Alliance champions for the following three seasons, before eventually securing admission to the B Division in 1957.

In 1957–58, the Intermediate Cup was won for the first time, a feat repeated in 1966–67, and the B Division championship in 1959–60. In 1963, Pat Jennings was sold to Watford for £5,600. Newry won the Southern section of the B Division in 1974–75, but lost to Carrick Rangers in the championship play-off. A &quot;double&quot; was achieved in 1980–81, when Town won the B Division and the Intermediate Cup.

On the back of this success, the club applied to join the Irish League in 1981, but was initially turned down. In 1983, however, the League decided to extend its membership to fourteen clubs and Newry, along with Carrick Rangers, were admitted to membership, restoring senior status for the first time in some forty years.

The club&#x27;s most successful period was the late 1990s. After winning the First Division in the 1997–98 season, the club managed to finish fourth in the Premier Division, thus qualifying for the Intertoto Cup. In this, their first ever appearance in European competition, Newry Town (as they were then known) were drawn against the Croatian side Hrvatski Dragovoljac. A 1–0 defeat in Croatia was followed by an historic 2–0 win at home to send the club into the second round. There they met Bundesliga side MSV Duisburg. Again, Newry were drawn away in the first leg, coming away with a respectable 2–0 defeat to the German professionals. A 1–0 win at home was not enough to force extra time but the side had exceeded expectations in the tournament.

Since the 1999–2000 season, the club went into decline, culminating in a last-place finish in the league in 2002–03. However, thanks to the restructuring of the Irish Football League they were given the chance to avoid relegation, with a play-off against Bangor over two legs. A 0–0 away draw and a 2–1 home win kept the club in the top flight.

In the 2006–07 season, big things were expected of Roy Coyle&#x27;s team, with the manager seen as the most successful manager in the history of the Irish league, however poor results resulted in Coyle leaving the club. He was replaced by former player Gerry Flynn at the start of 2007. In the 2007–08 season, Flynn&#x27;s first full season in charge, he and his assistant Peter Murray steered the club to 8th position in the final league table. In September 2009, after a 2–1 victory over Coleraine, Flynn resigned.

Shortly after, former Newry player-manager John McDonnell was given the job. On 13 March 2010, after an uncharacteristically unsuccessful spell McDonnell resigned as First team manager and Gerry Flynn once again took the reins. On 26 April 2011, the club lost 4–0 to Glenavon and were relegated to IFA Championship 1. Prior to this, Gerry Flynn was sacked as manager and former club captain Robbie Casey took charge on a temporary basis. Despite speculation that Roddy Collins was to get the job, former Manchester United player Pat McGibbon later took over as first team coach.

Under McGibbon&#x27;s leadership Newry were unlucky not to achieve promotion after only one season in the IFA Championship. The club finished as runners-up in the league behind Ballinamallard United and lost the two-legged promotion play-off 3–2 on aggregate to Lisburn Distillery. The club also reached the semi-finals of the Irish Cup, being beaten 7–0 by eventual winners Linfield. In July 2012, McGibbon stepped down from his post as first team coach, citing personal reasons for doing so.

==Dissolution==
In early 2012, former manager Gerry Flynn took legal action against the club for wrongful dismissal and breach of contract regarding his sacking in 2011. The court found in his favour and ordered the club to pay Flynn £25,050 in damages. However, on 10 August 2012, the club (&quot;Newry City FC Ltd&quot;) was the subject of a winding up petition brought by Flynn, after he had not received settlement. As a result, the IFA postponed the club&#x27;s opening fixture of the 2012–13 IFA Championship season, but after the club gave assurances to the IFA, the governing body allowed Newry to fulfil the upcoming fixtures. However, on 21 September 2012, the winding up petition was granted at a High Court hearing. The IFA then suspended the club&#x27;s membership, preventing any team affiliated with the club from playing any fixtures. Ultimately, the club decided not to appeal against the ruling, which meant dissolution after 89 years of existence. This left the IFA with no option but to terminate the club&#x27;s membership immediately, expunging all of its results from the season so far.

Many of the former players left to join neighbouring club Warrenpoint Town F.C. With the backing of the dissolved club&#x27;s fans, the formation of a new phoenix club called Newry City AFC with similar colours and badges, but with no legal or corporate link, to the former side was finalised in March 2013, with the new club starting life in the Mid-Ulster Football League for the 2013–14 season, reaching the NIFL Championship for the 2017–18 season.

<doc id="1343540" wikidata="Q873168" url="?curid=1343540" title="Shunsuke Kazama">
<text>is a Japanese actor and television personality.

==Career==
In 1997, when Kazama was in his second year of junior high school, he entered Johnny &amp; Associates and started activities as a trainee. He made his debut on stage that same year in a Shonentai stage play.

In 1999, he played Kenjiro Kanesue in &quot;Kinpachi-sensei&quot;. His performance earned him the Nikkan Sports Drama Grand Prix award for Best Newcomer.

In 2002, Kazama was member of unit &quot;FOURTOPS&quot; with fellow trainees Tomohisa Yamashita, Toma Ikuta, and Jun Hasegawa. The quartet hosted Shounen Club, a Johnny&#x27;s Jr. variety show. In September 2003, Yamashita was chosen to be a member of a new unit, News. FOURTOPS was dissolved with News&#x27; debut, and the remaining members would focus on acting. They reunited in 2018 for Fuji Television&#x27;s Year-End show &quot;Johnny&#x27;s Countdown&quot; as back dancers for duo Tackey &amp; Tsubasa, just as they did in the group&#x27;s original days, for the duo&#x27;s final appearance on the show.

In 2011, Kazama won a Television Drama Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.

He was a member of TU→YU in 2008, along with V6&#x27;s Hiroshi Nagano, NEWS&#x27;s Takahisa Masuda, Hey! Say! JUMP&#x27;s Hikaru Yaotome and actor Tatsuya Takeda.

He starred in the feature-length film &quot;Maebashi Visual Kei&quot;, as a young farmer who tries to make it big in a visual kei band.

When fellow Johnny Kazunari Ninomiya from Arashi, with whom Kazama has a close friendship, opened Twitter in 2023, he included a link to Kazama&#x27;s Johnny&#x27;s Web profile as if it were his own, much to the amusement of both their fans.

Mostly known as an actor, Kazama&#x27;s musical career is basically non-existent, except for a few units at the beginning. So he was happy to receive a present from fellow Johnny and long time friend (Arashi&#x27;s) Masaki Aiba. On 28 September 2023, at the last airing of the program VS Damashii in which both appeared, Aiba as &quot;captain&quot; and he as &quot;assistant captain&quot;. Aiba gifted Kazama (and all the Damashii members) a CD copy of the show&#x27;s theme song &quot;New Again! Again and again!&quot; saying, &quot;Congratulations on your CD debut, Kazama-kun&quot;, to what Kazama responded, &quot;This is the first CD that includes my voice in 26 years (of my entertainment career).&quot;

It was announced on 16 December 2023 that Kazama would be leaving the agency by year&#x27;s end, to work as a freelance actor.

==Personal life==
Kazama married a non-celebrity woman in 2013, after dating for ten years. According to some gossip sites and fan blogs, Kazama&#x27;s wife is former actress Kazuna Kawamura. Kawamura and Kazama met in 2004 during the performance of the play &quot;Claudia&quot;, a first for Kawamura, who relied in the experience that Kazama had at that time. According to those sites, the pair started dating when the play ended. When it came time to get married, months before, Kawamura announced her retirement from the industry. When Kazama reported the marriage, he named her as a non-celebrity woman, to keep prying eyes from their private life.

Kazama and his wife are parents of a boy, born around 2016. His existence was unknown until the child was 3 years old. According to people who have worked with him, Kazama is a very private person, and it isn&#x27;t his intention to keep hidden his private life, just that he rarely speaks about it.

On December 22, 2020, Kazama&#x27;s talent agency announced that he had tested positive for COVID-19. He made a full recovery on January 4.

<text>Lieutenant-Colonel Edward Arthur Butler (4 July 1843 – 16 April 1916) was an English ornithologist and British Army officer. He is commemorated in the scientific specific name for the Omani owl, &quot;Strix butleri&quot;.

Butler was born at Coton House, Churchover, Warwickshire and studied at Eton. He joined the army at the age of 21, and served in Gibraltar, India and South Africa with the 83rd (County of Dublin) Regiment of Foot. He retired in 1884 as a lieutenant-colonel in the Royal Irish Rifles.

He married Clara Francis Butler in 1872 and had three sons, Charles Edward, Harry Francis, and Arthur Lennox.
His son Arthur Lennox Butler was also an ornithologist, and had four species of reptiles named in his honor, including the Australian venomous snake, &quot;Chilorhinophis butleri&quot;.

Butler was a keen bird collector and taxidermist. His collections were acquired by the Natural History Museum in part directly and also through the collections of Allan Octavian Hume, Lord Rothschild and others.

Butler was found dead in his garden at Winsford Hall Stokesby nr Great Yarmouth 16 April 1916. A coroners court held at Winsford Hall returned a verdict of “Suicide during temporary insanity”, Butler was 72 years old.

<doc id="1343550" wikidata="Q1208908" url="?curid=1343550" title="P wave">
<text>A P wave (primary wave or pressure wave) is one of the two main types of elastic body waves, called seismic waves in seismology. P waves travel faster than other seismic waves and hence are the first signal from an earthquake to arrive at any affected location or at a seismograph. P waves may be transmitted through gases, liquids, or solids.

==Nomenclature==
The name &quot;P wave&quot; can stand for either pressure wave (as it is formed from alternating compressions and rarefactions) or primary wave (as it has high velocity and is therefore the first wave to be recorded by a seismograph). The name &quot;S wave&quot; represents another seismic wave propagation mode, standing for secondary or shear wave, a usually more destructive wave than the primary wave.

==Seismic waves in the Earth==

Primary and secondary waves are body waves that travel within the Earth. The motion and behavior of both P and S waves in the Earth are monitored to probe the interior structure of the Earth. Discontinuities in velocity as a function of depth are indicative of changes in phase or composition. Differences in arrival times of waves originating in a seismic event like an earthquake as a result of waves taking different paths allow mapping of the Earth&#x27;s inner structure.

===P wave shadow zone===

Almost all the information available on the structure of the Earth&#x27;s deep interior is derived from observations of the travel times, reflections, refractions and phase transitions of seismic body waves, or normal modes. P waves travel through the fluid layers of the Earth&#x27;s interior, and yet they are refracted slightly when they pass through the transition between the semisolid mantle and the liquid outer core. As a result, there is a P wave &quot;shadow zone&quot; between 103° and 142° from the earthquake&#x27;s focus, where the initial P waves are not registered on seismometers. In contrast, S waves do not travel through liquids.

===As an earthquake warning===

Advance earthquake warning is possible by detecting the nondestructive primary waves that travel more quickly through the Earth&#x27;s crust than do the destructive secondary and Rayleigh waves.

The amount of warning depends on the delay between the arrival of the P wave and other destructive waves, generally on the order of seconds up to about 60 to 90 seconds for deep, distant, large quakes such as the 2011 Tohoku earthquake. The effectiveness of a warning depends on accurate detection of the P waves and rejection of ground vibrations caused by local activity (such as trucks or construction). Earthquake early warning systems can be automated to allow for immediate safety actions, such as issuing alerts, stopping elevators at the nearest floors, and switching off utilities.

==Propagation==

===Velocity===
In isotropic and homogeneous solids, a P wave travels in a straight line longitudinally; thus, the particles in the solid vibrate along the axis of propagation (the direction of motion) of the wave energy. The velocity of P waves in that kind of medium is given by
formula_1
where is the bulk modulus (the modulus of incompressibility), is the shear modulus (modulus of rigidity, sometimes denoted as and also called the second Lamé parameter), is the density of the material through which the wave propagates, and is the first Lamé parameter.

In typical situations in the interior of the Earth, the density usually varies much less than or , so the velocity is mostly &quot;controlled&quot; by these two parameters.

The elastic moduli P wave modulus, formula_2, is defined so that formula_3 and thereby
formula_4

Typical values for P wave velocity in earthquakes are in the range 5 to 8 km/s. The precise speed varies according to the region of the Earth&#x27;s interior, from less than 6 km/s in the Earth&#x27;s crust to 13.5 km/s in the lower mantle, and 11 km/s through the inner core.

Geologist Francis Birch discovered a relationship between the velocity of P waves and the density of the material the waves are traveling in:
formula_5
which later became known as Birch&#x27;s law. (The symbol is an empirically tabulated function, and is a constant.)

<doc id="1343554" wikidata="Q1361000" url="?curid=1343554" title="Stade Français">
<text>Stade Français Paris (known commonly as Stade Français, ) is a French professional rugby union club based in the 16th arrondissement of Paris. The club plays in the Top 14 domestic league in France and is one of the most successful French clubs of the modern era. The original Stade Français was founded in 1883. In its current form, the club was founded in 1995 with the merger of the rugby sections of the Stade Français and Club Athlétique des Sports Généraux (CASG).

Its traditional home is Stade Jean-Bouin, though the club has recently played some home games at the 80,000-seat Stade de France, taking anywhere from two to five matches to the larger venue each season since 2005–06. From 2010 to 2013, the team played temporarily at the 20,000-capacity Stade Charléty in Paris to allow a new stadium to be built at the Jean-Bouin site.

The team participated in the first French championship final in 1892, and went on to win numerous titles during the early 1900s. Stade Français spent about 50 years in the lower divisions of French rugby, until entrepreneur Max Guazzini took over in 1992, overseeing a rise to prominence, which saw the team returning to the elite division in just five seasons, and capture four French championships in seven years. After a financial crisis plagued the club in 2011, Guazzini sold a majority stake and stepped down as club president.
From 2009 to 2015, the team struggles, failing to reach the final phases. 2015 marked a rebirth for them, as the team reached the final phases and won three games in row, against Racing Métro, Toulon and Clermont and won also Top 14.

== History ==

Stade Français was established in 1883 by a group of students in Paris. On 20 March 1892 the USFSA organised the first ever French rugby union championship, a one-off game between Racing Club de France and Stade Français. The game was refereed by Pierre de Coubertin and saw Racing win 4–3.
However the club were able to make up for the loss the next season when the two teams met again in the final, with Stade Français winning 7 points to 3. The team quickly became a powerful side in the competition, featuring in every championship in succession until 1899, successful in 1894, 1895, 1897 and 1898.

From 1899 through to the 1908 season Stade Français would contest the championship final on seven occasions against Stade Bordelais, winning in 1901 and again in 1908. Stade Français also defeated SOE Toulouse in the 1903 season in Toulouse. Following a vast amount of success during the early years of the domestic league, after 1908 Stade Français would not make another final appearance until the 1927 season, when they were defeated by Toulouse 19 points to 9 in Toulouse. Stade Français would then go onto spend over fifty years in the lower divisions of French rugby.

While in the third division of the French leagues, entrepreneur Max Guazzini took over the club in 1992 with the goal of bringing back top class rugby to the city of Paris. Stade Français CASG was born in 1995 through the merger of the existing Stade Français club and another Parisian side, Club Athlétique des Sports Généraux (CASG). The team returned to the top division in 1995 which coincided with the appointment of head coach Bernard Laporte. By 1998 the team had reached the championship final, and captured their first title since 1908, defeating Perpignan 34 points to 7 at Stade de France. Laporte left the club to coach the national team, he was replaced by Georges Coste who was in turn replaced by John Connolly in 2000.

Connolly took the club to their first Heineken Cup final in May 2001, where they were defeated by the Leicester Tigers 34 points to 30 at Parc des Princes. Connolly left in 2002 and was replaced by South African Nick Mallet. Stade Français won the domestic league again in both 2003 and 2004. During the 2004–05 season Stade Français went close to winning both the French league and the Heineken Cup, but lost both finals; beaten by Biarritz domestically and by Toulouse in the European Heineken Cup after extra time in Scotland. Mallett soon returned home to South Africa and former Stade Français player and national captain Fabien Galthié was appointed head coach. Stade won the 2006–07 championship, defeating Clermont 23 points to 18 at Stade de France.

The club faced serious financial issues during the 2010–11 season due to the failure of an affiliated advertising company. In early June 2011, Stade Français temporarily avoided an administrative relegation to the amateur Fédérale 1 league when Guazzini announced a deal by which an unnamed investor, working through a Canada-based foundation, would purchase a majority stake in the club. However, the deal collapsed in scandal, with at least three people linked to the deal arrested. On the deadline set by France&#x27;s professional league for a resolution of the club&#x27;s situation, Guazzini announced a new deal, in which Jean-Pierre Savare, chairman of French security systems company Oberthur Technologies, purchased a controlling stake in the club. Guazzini stepped down as president in favour of Savare&#x27;s son Thomas, remaining with the club as honorary president.

After six years of presidency, Thomas Savare officially handed over the position to Hans-Peter Wild. The arrival of the Swiss businessman put an end to a long story in Paris marked by the aborted merger with rival Racing 92 in March 2017. Upon his arrival, Dr. Hans-Peter Wild presented a 5-year project to the media, with the training of young French players as a priority.

==The modern era: fan support, stadiums and communication==
===The Max Guazzini era===
With the understanding that Parisians are reluctant to show loyalty, Max Guazzini first tried a new pricing approach in order to draw in regular spectators. In 1996, while Stade were still in the Group A2, he opened up Jean-Bouin free of charge. 7,000 people attended matches against Lourdes and Valence-d’Agen. After that, women had free entry for some of the matches. At the time, he stated: &quot;In Paris, no club has ever had so many spectators. Even when Racing were French Champions, or about to be. I&#x27;d rather have 7,000 happy punters in our stadium than 200 with a fistful of francs. It&#x27;s a question of philosophy.&quot; &quot;Île-de-France is where more than 20% of our rugby fans live, and I think it&#x27;s abnormal that the stadiums are empty. It can&#x27;t go on!&quot;.

At the same time as the question of prices, Guazzini envisaged the match as the main event in a family outing, and worked on activities before, during and after the matches: cheerleaders, music, jingles when points were scored, bells signalling the end of each half, a remote-controlled car bringing the tee to the kicker, the club&#x27;s anthem, (I Will Survive by Gloria Gaynor (long before it was adopted by the France national football team)), etc. A professional showman, he enrolled Mathilda May, Madonna and Naomi Campbell as sponsors. This strategy was openly aimed at women and families, and it worked, with the number of women and children attending the matches increasing.

The Dieux du Stade (Gods of the Stadium) calendar, which had famous players posing nude for black-and-white photos, made the news when it first appeared in 2001. The club has promoted the Stade Français brand through a line of clothing and spin-off products.
Since 2005, the star of the collection has been the pink jersey, in a colour considered the opposite of rugby virility, somewhat disconcerting the rugby world in September 2005, when the club&#x27;s first-team players donned it for a league match in Perpignan. Despite the on-pitch defeat, Stade Français had scored a phenomenal commercial success. 20,000 of the jerseys, manufactured by Adidas, were sold in 2005–06. The following year, two new designs by Adidas were added: one of them pink, the other navy blue decorated with pink lilies (and not fleurs-de-lis, as in heraldry). The lily design was added to a mobile phone case. The club&#x27;s objective for 2006–07 was to sell a total of 100,000 jerseys.

In response to criticism that he was perverting rugby with such &quot;provocation&quot; and against his insistence on communication, including to those who declared they were defending the traditional spirit of the sport, Guazzini replied that if rugby was to become a genuinely popular and national sport, it needed to look beyond its natural audience: &quot;The communication campaign is not aimed at long-time fans. They&#x27;re not the ones we&#x27;re chatting up - it&#x27;s the others. We need to get the attention of everyone who isn&#x27;t familiar with rugby. Or only knows it a bit… Or not enough… So we need an outside perspective. [...] Rugby is no longer an amateur sport. [...] We have to be creative. (…) Preaching to the converted doesn&#x27;t really work for me. ”Speaking of post-match reception, he took a swipe in passing at the keepers of the South West France flame: &quot;The eternal temple, with its fanfare, foie gras and saucisson, is a bit outdated. We can&#x27;t restrict ourselves to the culture of the South West, which doesn&#x27;t represent all of France.&quot;

Guazzini nonetheless remained attached to certain traditions. Thus, from his arrival in 1992, he required players to wear the club&#x27;s official blazer and tie. &quot;I won&#x27;t tolerate any sloppiness. Rugby tradition is jacket-tie, and I think that&#x27;s a good thing.&quot;»
It took about ten years for the club to finally establish itself with fans. Almost all of Stade&#x27;s home matches were sold out. Faced with the size limits of Stade Jean-Bouin (room for about 10,000 people), and still wishing to develop the club&#x27;s popularity until they could find a new, bigger home, Guazzini set his sights higher. In April 2005, he wanted to play the quarter-final match of the European Champions Cup, against Newcastle, at Parc des Princes, located across from Stade Jean-Bouin. It was a complete success: the match was sold out (about 48,000 attended).

Logically, therefore, Guazzini sought to repeat the success for a league match against Toulouse and a European Champions Cup match against Leicester in the autumn. But this time, the directors of Paris Saint-Germain were against the idea, fearing the rugby players would damage the pitch. Guazzini, annoyed and shocked by the lack of solidarity on the part of Stade Français&#x27;s neighbours, stated that he would fill Stade de France. Using an aggressive sales strategy (half of the seats were available for €5 or 10, sponsors were actively approached) and effective communication, he did: on 15 October 2005, Stade Français Paris beat the world attendance record for a regular season rugby union league match (79,502 spectators). He would repeat this feat three times: against Biarritz (4 March 2006, 79,604 spectators), then against Biarritz again (14 October 2006, 79,619 spectators) and finally against Toulouse (27 January 2007, 79,741 spectators).
In addition to the pricing policy, there was additional entertainment on display at Stade de France: thousands of blue and pink flags placed on the seats, famous singers and musicians (Les Tambours du Bronx 15 October 2005, Michel Delpech 27 January 2007), circus performers, giant karaoke, a parade of children from rugby schools in the Paris region (27 January 2007) each time the ball would arrive in a different and spectacular way, once in a chariot drawn by two horses (15 October 2005), once by Miss France 2006 emerging from a giant egg in the middle of the pitch (27 January 2007), dancers from the Moulin Rouge, wrestling bouts, the Gipsy Kings (13 May 2007), fireworks after the match, etc. Each match was an excuse to come up with new, original ideas.

Detractors observed that it isn&#x27;t hard to fill Stade de France with such low ticket prices. Pierre Blayau, President of Paris Saint-Germain, which refused to loan out the Parc des Princes in 2005, stated: &quot;I find their communication [...] a bit excessive. [...] I don&#x27;t know how many people would have tried to buy tickets if we had sold them for a PSG-Lyon match at three, five or seven Euros. Maybe 400,000&quot;.
The new Paris Saint-Germain management nonetheless agreed to welcome Stade Français again, for a European Champions Cup match against the Sale Sharks, on 10 December 2006 (44,112 spectators). And in the end, the European Champions Cup match against Leicester was played at Stade Charléty. Stade Roi-Baudouin in Brussels and Stade Félix-Bollaert in Lens had offered their services, but the Mayor of Paris Bertrand Delanoë, a close friend of Guazzini and one of the club&#x27;s financial backers, vetoed the idea, stating that Stade Français was a Parisian club and therefore should play in Paris.

Since 2004–2005, Stade Français Paris played ten league matches outside of Jean-Bouin, including five times at Stade de France and four times at Parc des Princes, in addition to the 2010–2011 season, almost entirely played at Stade Charléty. Three more matches were to be played at Stade de France during the 2007–2008 season against Clermont, Toulouse and Biarritz. Nonetheless, these gala matches could only be organised two or three times per year and couldn&#x27;t hide what Max Guazzini considers to be Stade Français Paris&#x27;s main problem: the absence of a real stadium entirely devoted to rugby, which was indispensable if the club was to develop in a serious way; a stadium capable of receiving the public with reasonably comfortable conditions was needed. For years, Guazzini canvassed the city of Paris with this goal in mind, asserting that the club risked dropping down to the Pro D2 again and threatening to resign if the city didn&#x27;t agree. After repeated discussions and submissions, the planned new stadium was finally accepted by Paris City Hall on 29 March 2010. The building permit was granted on 12 May and demolition of the former stadium began as soon as the 2009/2010 season came to an end. With a 20,000 seat capacity, the new Jean Bouin was inaugurated on 30 August 2013, hosting a comfortable victory (38–3) over Biarritz Olympique.

In April 2011, the magazine Le 10 Sport announced that the owner, Max Guazzin, had put the club up for sale9. The club was suffering from serious financial difficulty, in particular due to the liquidation of Sportys, its advertising manager and minority shareholder.

===The Thomas Savare era===

At this time, Thomas Savare, managing director of the new shareholder, the Oberthur Fiduciaire group, took over as President of the club, replacing Max Guazzini. He invested 11 million Euros in the club, saying goodbye to Bernard Laporte and choosing the former third row of the Paris club, Richard Pool-Jones, as vice-president. During the European campaign of the 2012–13 season, Stade Français increased the number of matches it played elsewhere for the European Challenge Cup matches, playing at the Stade Océane in Le Havre, the MMArena in Le Mans and the Stade du Hainaut in Valenciennes. Furthermore, on 30 March 2013, they played a league match against Toulon at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy in Lille.
The next few financial years saw Stade Français remain in the red, leading its main shareholder to re-inject cash. This situation led to significant tension within the Oberthur Fiduciaire shareholding family. In September 2014, Thomas Savare sisters, Marie and Emmanuelle, who were also shareholders in the Oberthur Fiduciaire group and who opposed the investment, decided to publicise their opposition to the investment, which they considered economically pointless and a bottomless pit. For his part, Thomas Savare spoke of an &quot;investment out of passion&quot; and stated that he would continue to work towards the club becoming financially self-sufficient12.

====Abortive merger with Racing 92====
On Monday, 13 March 2017, the club President, Thomas Savare, announced the planned merger of the club with its neighbour, Racing 92 for the 2017-2018 season13. The next day, the Stade Français players held a team meeting and decided to give provisional notice of a strike to last an undetermined period of time, in order to demand the cancellation of the merger. They refused to take part in either training or matches14. Faced with such strong opposition, the two Presidents decided to cancel the planned merger a few days later. On 19 March, Jacky Lorenzetti and Thomas Savare issued a press release in which each explained their decision15,16.

===The Hans-Peter Wild era===
On 14 May 2017, Thomas Savare announced he had selected the German-Swiss entrepreneur, Hans-Peter Wild, to take charge of the French capital&#x27;s club, and handed over the keys. Savare preferred the business magnate&#x27;s offer to that made by a group of former players and investors. Dr. Wild, the founder of Capri-Sun, was a big fan of both rugby and Paris, and he announced his desire to remain at the head of the Parisian club in the long term. He is seeking to develop the club both nationally and internationally.
To do so, he appointed Hubert Patricot, the former President of the European division of Coca-Cola Enterprises, as club President, and Fabien Grobon as managing director.

====The re-build====
As soon as the purchase of the club was complete, Dr. Wild asked Robert Mohr to lead the new re-build. From the middle of the 2017–2018 season, starting with the teams and players already in place or available on the transfer market, many changes were instituted: starting in April, the new sport project was developed around Heyneke Meyer, former manager of the South African national team. He initiated an influx of acknowledged technical skills ( Pieter de Villiers, Mike Prendergast and Paul O&#x27;Connell, the Irish second row player who had earned 108 caps with the Irish team). He also reinforced the professional staff, with the arrival of new recruits for 2018–2019, including internationals Gaël Fickou, Yoann Maestri and Nicolás Sánchez.
Under the guidance of Pascal Papé, a former player with Stade Français Paris and former captain of the France national team, the club adopted a cross-team approach to youth and professional development (from 14 years of age to career change: a cross-club approach with the teams, feedback, long-term monitoring). Players&#x27; career development was re-analysed in the search for systematic performance, with more discipline and more expected on a daily basis. Preparation for the 2018–2019 season marked a clear-cut change, especially in players&#x27; physical preparation and the implementation of a new game plan.

====Brand repositioning and new logo====
Another one of Dr. Wild&#x27;s priorities was to reposition the brand and redesign the club logo to mark the transition and open up a new chapter in the club&#x27;s history. To crystallise the 135-year old love story with Paris, Stade Français Paris added &quot;Paris&quot; to its crest, while keeping the shape. The colour pink was kept, as a symbol of the difference between the club and its creativity; the lightning bolts, representing the club&#x27;s roots, were changed, and now symbolise dynamism and reconquest.
The new sport project and the new logo were both an homage to the club&#x27;s prestigious past and a call for new ambition: the (R)evolution was presented at Stade Jean-Bouin on 16 May 2018, the anniversary of the first Top 14 title win in the Guazzini era (in 1998, versus Perpignan). During the event, which brought together several thousand people, former Stade Français Paris players were honoured and the club&#x27;s new goals for the coming 5 years were presented.

== Name, logo and colours ==

In the 1880s, many emerging sports clubs were modelled after English institutions and took on English names (Racing Club, Standard, Sporting, Daring, etc.). The name &quot;Stade&quot; was chosen by the young students as a reminder of Ancient Greece, for the &quot;Stadium&quot; (Stade) was where the athletes performed their feats. &quot;Français&quot; came later. Ironically, it was probably given by British players, against whom the &quot;Stadistes&quot; played early on, to differentiate them from their own Paris associations as rugby was very much an expatriates&#x27; game in the late 1880s. In those years, France also lived with the memory of the war lost to Germany in 1871.

The patriotic appeal of &quot;la revanche&quot; (&quot;the revenge&quot;) is probably behind the choice of the blue, white and red colours of the French national flag, and of the name Stade Français (written with a lower-case &quot;f&quot; in French: &quot;Stade français&quot;). Blue and red are also the colours of the city of Paris, which has provided support since 1994 (Bertrand Delanoë, mayor of Paris from 2001 to 2014, is a loyal supporter and a close friend of former Stade chairman Max Guazzini, who served as Delanoë&#x27;s legal counsel in the late 1970s and early 1980s).
The traditional colours of Stade Français are royal blue jerseys, red shorts and white stockings. The club&#x27;s old logo featured the letters S and F (the club&#x27;s initials) in white on a red and blue halved shield. The twelve blue stars represent the twelve championship wins. The team&#x27;s current colours are dark blue and pink. The current logo is a blue shield with the letters S and F and three flashes of lightning in pink.
President Guazzini wanted to create identifiable jerseys. He first decided to include three flashes of lightning, which are now the club&#x27;s emblem, and to have a new shirt every year. In 2005, Guazzini went further and chose to shock the &quot;macho&quot; world of rugby by introducing a pink away jersey, pink being one of the rarest colours used by sports teams. Stade Français played their first match in the new colours at Perpignan in September 2005 and lost (12–16). They then used it regularly. On 15 April 2006, SF played at Toulouse and asked permission to don their pink jersey. The referee refused because, he said, pink would clash with Toulouse&#x27;s red.

The club sold 20,000 pink replica jerseys in 2005–06. Guazzini also had more than 10,000 pink flags manufactured, which were scattered on the seats at the Stade de France for the two games against Toulouse and Biarritz. Two new jerseys were introduced at the beginning of the 2006–07 season. A pink one, designed by fashion designer Kenzo, was used for Stade&#x27;s home debut against Montpellier on 19 August 2006. A new navy blue one was used for the second home game against Bayonne on 9 September 2006, and has raised questions as it sports big pink lilies, green flashes and green numbers in the back (green is not a club colour). It had been officially presented to the players a few minutes before the game and received by them with cheers and claps. Only wing Christophe Dominici had been allowed to see it beforehand. The radio-controlled car used to bring the tee to the kicker was painted in pink for the 2006–07 season.

==Home grounds==

The team&#x27;s home stadium is Stade Jean-Bouin which has a capacity of 20,000. Before expansion in 2011, the capacity was 12,000, seen as too small for some major European games during the first decade of the new millennium. Then Club President Guazzini made a decision to take a European quarter final match against Newcastle to the significantly larger Parc des Princes, which is literally across the street from Stade Jean-Bouin. Guazzini booked the national stadium of France, the 80,000 Stade de France for a Top 14 fixture against Toulouse. The move was successful, with 79,502 officially turning up for the game, smashing the regular season attendance record in France. At the end of the match, Guazzini announced that he had booked the venue for the Biarritz match – a rematch of the 2004–05 final. Stade Français drew an even larger crowd to the game (79,604), toppling the previous record set that same season.

After a period of much speculation, the match was taken to the Stade Charléty, remaining in Paris. On 14 October 2006, the record was broken for the third time in a row (79,619) for a championship tie against Biarritz. Stade Français booked Parc des Princes for a Heineken Cup showdown with the Sale Sharks on 10 December 2006 and drew 44,100 to see Stade win 27–16. On 27 January 2007, Stade Français set yet another French attendance record by drawing 79,741 to Stade de France for their 22–20 win over Toulouse. Stade Français played their opening match of the 2007–08 season at Stade de France against Clermont; they failed to set a national attendance record this time, but still drew 75,620. On 22 March 2008, they played their home match against Toulouse at Stade de France for the third straight season, and set yet another record with 79,779 in attendance. The 2007–08 season marked the first time that Stade Français played a third regular-season match at Stade de France, as they booked the venue for their 7 June match with Biarritz; they drew 79,544 for that match.

In 2008–09, they played four home matches at Stade de France—their Top 14 home fixtures against Toulouse, Perpignan and Clermont, plus a Heineken Cup pool match against Harlequins. They scheduled five Top 14 matches at Stade de France in 2009–10—Perpignan, Bayonne, Biarritz, Toulouse, and Clermont. In the upcoming 2010–11 season, the number of Top 14 matches at Stade de France will return to three, namely Toulon, Toulouse, and Clermont.

In the 2000s Stade Français has also taken some matches to another Paris ground, Stade Charléty, whose capacity of 20,000 was larger than that of Jean-Bouin at the time. In 2009–10, they played their home leg of the Paris derby with Racing Métro there, and made that stadium their regular home for the 2010–11 season while Jean-Bouin was being renovated.

Stade Français also planned to take their home 2009–10 Heineken Cup pool match against Ulster to Belgium at King Baudouin Stadium in Brussels, but heavy snowfall on the intended matchday forced the fixture to be moved to Stade Jean-Bouin.

Max Guazzini, a media man, wanted to develop the club as a modern business and use marketing methods. He never hesitates when it comes to promoting his club and creating a buzz. As a result, the club has been attracting an equal number of cheers and criticisms. The first objective was to offer a nice show to people who would then become regular paying fans. Guazzini also introduced female cheerleaders, music before kick-off, the sound of bells to mark the end of each half (instead of a more traditional siren), fireworks at the end of evening matches and a radio-controlled car to bring the tee to the kicker when he takes a penalty or a conversion kick.

His successful radio station NRJ (he helped develop it when he joined it in 1982, a year after it was founded) was a generous sponsor too. His contacts in show business allowed him to bring superstars Madonna and Naomi Campbell to some games, making them the official club&#x27;s &quot;godmothers&quot;. The club&#x27;s official anthem was Gloria Gaynor&#x27;s &quot;I Will Survive&quot;, long before France used it as theirs in the 1998 FIFA World Cup.

Guazzini&#x27;s latest moves include renting the Parc des Princes, Stade de France, and most recently King Baudouin Stadium for big games, and using pink jerseys. Stade Français are heavily criticised by old-timers, especially in France&#x27;s rugby bastions in the south, for their innovative spirit which tends to hurt traditional image and values of rugby such as humility and seriousness. Some people are wary of the club&#x27;s relation to the world of media and show business (players are regularly invited as TV show guests). The critiques can also be explained by the historic &quot;Paris vs provinces&quot; divide and some form of acrimony in the rest of the country for everything that comes from the capital. Others consider it is good for rugby in its quest to maintain itself as France&#x27;s second most popular sport after Association football and shed its image as a gross rural south-western form of fistfight.

===Dieux du Stade===

In 2001, Guazzini initiated a calendar called Dieux du Stade&#x27;, i.e. &quot;The Gods of Stade (Français)&quot;, a play on the word &quot;stade&quot; which also means &quot;stadium&quot;. In French, &quot;The Gods of the Stadium&quot; is a metaphor for athletes in general, especially those who perform in athletics. It includes black-and-white pictures of the team&#x27;s players, naked, adopting postures of athletes of the classical Greco-Roman athletes and hiding their private parts. A new one has been made every year since, with guest stars on several occasions, such as Frédéric Michalak and Olivier Magne in 2003. Profits partly go to charities. A DVD covering the making of the calendar has been released each year since the 2004 edition. All have been extremely successful with women and the gay community.

==Rivalries==

Today, Stade Français has no established local rival, although Racing 92 may fill that role if it consolidates its current top-flight status. The &quot;Paris versus the provinces&quot; rhetoric is alive and kicking so that wherever Stade goes, it is met with traditional jeers people in the provinces throw at Parisians. Since its 1990s revival, its traditional foes have thus been all clubs not playing in Paris.

===Racing 92===
Paris was the cradle of French rugby union. Stade Français and Racing Club de France, two Paris-based outfits, played the first ever club match in France in May 1891, won by Stade 3–0, and were the only two clubs to take part in the first ever championship the following year. In fact, the first seven championships were fought exclusively between Parisian teams. Though they played Olympique de Paris in two finals, Stade&#x27;s main foe became Racing Club de France whom they came up against in the first two finals, in play-off matches in the following years, as well as in several Championnat de Paris matches. Racing was a more aristocratic club and Stade a more popular one. The Stade-Racing rivalry will be renewed in 2009–10 with the promotion of Racing Club&#x27;s successor, Racing Métro, to the Top 14.

===Bordeaux===
Another rivalry, with Stade Bordelais, took its place, when clubs from outside Paris were finally allowed to play in 1899. The teams were going to meet in 7 of the next 10 finals, with Bordeaux winning 5 of them. Yet the most heated one was the first Stade won in 1901. Bordeaux won the match 3–0 on a hotly debated try. Afterwards, Stade accused Bordeaux of fielding three ineligible players: earlier in the year, Stade Bordelais had merged with Bordeaux Université Club to become Stade Bordelais Université Club, but three of those new players had not been with the club for at least three months as the rules dictated. The USFSA ordered a replay, but Bordeaux claimed their honour and honesty were at stake and refused it. Stade Français were declared the winners and this was how their sixth title was won.

Bordeaux had to wait three years to get their revenge in one of the dirtiest finals, in which the whistle was held by a very quiet and &quot;blasé&quot; Englishman, Billy Williams (who, four years later was to get the English RFU to buy some land for Twickenham). Kicks in the shins succeeded blows in the face. Spectators joined in and booed the kickers in a very poor and sad match. A reporter appalled at what he saw commented: &quot;I’ve never seen thug fights in the seediest parts of town, but that is probably what it looks like.&quot; Bordeaux won the next three finals, all against Stade. The rivalry was enhanced by the huge number of France players on the pitch. When France battled New Zealand for its first ever international match in 1906, it had 5 Stade Français and 4 Stade Bordelais players, the highest tallies for any club. The First World War put an end to the rivalry as neither of the two Stades regained their past glory.

===Toulouse===
Naturally the fight for the top spots means that the most significant rivalries are with the other Top 14 big guns, Toulouse and Biarritz Olympique. Stade Français has been seen as the rising threat by the all-powerful Toulousains who had won four consecutive titles (1994–97), before Paris won the next one. The clubs alternated for four years, winning two titles each until 2001, though they never met in the final. When they finally did, Stade Français walked over Toulouse for a victory (32–18) in 2003. Toulouse got their revenge in 2005, when they won a tight Heineken Cup final in overtime (18–12 a.e.t.) at Murrayfield. The clubs often fight it out in the press, but there have never been any real tensions on the pitch, largely because many players have been playing together for France. Regular season games are rarely spectacular. In October 2005, Toulouse was the guest for the first ever regular season match at the Stade de France, but coach Guy Novès chose to leave key regular starters at home, so the Stade Français 29–15 victory was maybe not as significant.

===Biarritz===
Stade Français games against Biarritz are another notable rivalry. The Red and White established themselves as another powerhouse in 2002 when they won the title, their first since 1939. Stade&#x27;s Heineken Cup semi-final victory in April 2005 probably did a lot to create tension between the two clubs, as Christophe Dominici scored the winning try after nine minutes of injury time at the Parc des Princes. Biarritz felt it had been done an injustice. A month later, the two clubs fought it out in the Top 14 final, which went down as the most physical and the most tense ever. Biarritz&#x27;s overtime victory in the highest scoring final ever (37–34) crowned a final on the &quot;edge&quot;.

Five months later, the two met again in Biarritz in a regular season match. A massive fistfight, in which almost all players were involved broke out after just 5 minutes, after a scrum went up and the first rows exploded. The referee handed two yellows and two reds to Stade&#x27;s Arnaud Marchois and BO&#x27;s Imanol Harinordoquy. The rest was extremely rough, full of scuffles and insults. Stade went on to win 14–7. As can be expected, everyone condemned the other camp after the match. Biarritz coach Patrice Lagisquet assured Paris had assaulted his players to destabilise them, while the Parisians acknowledged that the overtime loss in the Top 14 final had been hard to swallow, especially as they had the impression that Biarritz had overemphasised the physical side. Ever since, the matches between the two teams have been relatively quiet.

<doc id="1343556" wikidata="Q2279804" url="?curid=1343556" title="Shoofly pie">
<text>Shoofly pie is a type of American pie made with molasses associated with Pennsylvania Dutch cuisine. While shoo-fly pie has been a staple of Moravian, Mennonite, and Amish foodways, there is scant evidence concerning its origins, and most of the folktales concerning the pie are apocryphal, including the persistent legend that the name comes from flies being attracted to the sweet filling. 

The name &quot;shoo-fly&quot; was borrowed from a brand of molasses that was popular in parts of the U.S. during the late 19th century. Possibly related to the Jenny Lind pie (a soft gingerbread pie), it may have originated among the Pennsylvania Dutch in the 1880s as molasses crumb cake, and is sometimes called &quot;molasses crumb pie&quot;. Traditionally it was not served as a dessert pie, but instead as a breakfast food with hot coffee. The modern form of shoo-fly pie as a crumb cake served in pie crust was a post-Civil War innovation, when cast iron cookware and stoves made pie crust more feasible for home cooks.

== Description ==

Shoo-fly pie has been described as a crumb cake baked in a pie crust. The primary ingredients of the filling are molasses, brown sugar, and water. Serving the cake in pie crust made it easier for people to eat it with their hands in the 19th century. 

It comes in two different versions: &quot;wet-bottom&quot; and &quot;dry-bottom&quot;. The dry-bottom version is baked until fully set and results in a more cake-like consistency throughout. The wet-bottom version is set like cake at the top where it was mixed in with the crumbs, but the very bottom is a stickier, gooier custard-like consistency. Different recipes for the wet and dry versions appeared in the early 20th century – the dry version was suitable for dunking in a cup of coffee.

== History ==
Shoo-fly pie began as a crust-less molasses cake called &quot;centennial cake&quot; in 1876, to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence in Philadelphia. There is no evidence of it being made before the American Civil War. In the 1880s, home bakers added a crust to make it easier to eat alongside a cup of coffee in the morning, without plates and forks. Precursors include Jenny Lind pie, a type of gingerbread cake that was named for the famed Swedish opera star, Jenny Lind, after her tour of America in the 1850s. Because shoo-fly pie traditionally contains molasses but no eggs, historians conclude that it was typically baked during the winter, when chickens laid fewer eggs and molasses could be stored in the cold weather without fear of it fermenting. The use of baking powder places its invention firmly after the Civil War and in the 1870s, when Pennsylvania Dutch bakers began using baking powder.

== Variations ==

A Montgomery pie is similar to a shoo-fly pie, except lemon juice is used in the bottom layer. Treacle tart is a pie with a filling made from light treacle.

== Name ==
The modern name comes from a particular brand of molasses from Philadelphia, &quot;Shoo-fly Molasses&quot;. The name &quot;shoo-fly pie&quot; was used in the 1880s, but its first appearance in print was after World War I. The &quot;Shoo-fly Molasses&quot; brand was named after a popular circus animal that toured in Pennsylvania in the 19th century, &quot;Shoo-fly the Boxing Mule&quot;. The mule, in turn, may have been named after a song that became popular half a century before: &quot;Shoo Fly, Don&#x27;t Bother Me&quot;. The pie is mentioned in the song &quot;Shoo-Fly Pie and Apple Pan Dowdy&quot;, popularized by Dinah Shore in the 1940s.

In the Pennsylvania Dutch language, &quot;shoo-fly pie&quot; is called Melassich Riwwelboi or Melassichriwwelkuche (molasses crumb cake). Before its modern name became popular during the 20th century, it was &quot;molasses crumb pie&quot; or &quot;soda rivvel cake&quot; (&quot;rivels&quot; are lumps of food).

<doc id="1343567" wikidata="Q152362" url="?curid=1343567" title="Mihai Răzvan Ungureanu">
<text>Mihai Răzvan Ungureanu (; born 22 September 1968) is a Romanian historian, politician who served as Prime Minister of Romania in 2012. He was the foreign minister of Romania from 28 December 2004 to 12 March 2007, and he was appointed as Director of the Foreign Intelligence Service later in 2007. Following the resignation of the Emil Boc government he was appointed prime minister serving through April 2012 when his cabinet was dismissed following a parliamentary vote of no-confidence. He was confirmed by the Parliament for a second term as Director of the Foreign Intelligence Service, after President Klaus Iohannis nominated him in June 2015 but he resigned in September 2016, citing health issues.

==Education==
Ungureanu studied Maths and Physics at the Costache Negruzzi High School in Iași, where he graduated valedictorian in 1987. Ungureanu later studied History and Philosophy at the Alexandru Ioan Cuza University where he graduated in 1992. From 1985 to 1989, Ungureanu was an alternate member of the Union of Communist Youth Central Committee, while between 1990 and 1992 he was a member of the university senate as a student representative. In 1993, Ungureanu obtained a master&#x27;s degree at the Oxford Centre for Hebrew and Jewish Studies, an affiliated programme of St Cross College at the University of Oxford. In March 2004 he received a PhD degree from the Alexandru Ioan Cuza University after submitting a thesis on the &quot;Conversion and integration in the Romanian society in the early-modern era&quot;.

==Professional career==
Ungureanu was an assistant professor at the Alexandru Ioan Cuza University when he was recruited to the diplomatic service in 1998. He subsequently served as State Secretary in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (1998–2000), and was a Vienna-based representative of the Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe (2000–2004).

A member of the National Liberal Party (PNL), part of the Justice and Truth Alliance (DA), Ungureanu became foreign minister after the candidate supported by the alliance, Traian Băsescu, won the presidential election. On February 2, 2007, Prime Minister Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu requested Ungureanu&#x27;s resignation because Ungureanu had failed to inform the government about the detention of two Romanian workers by coalition forces in Iraq. On February 4, Ungureanu confirmed his resignation, Popescu-Tăriceanu said that Ungureanu would continue to act as foreign minister until the swearing in of a successor. On March 12, President Traian Băsescu signed a decree removing Ungureanu from his position.

===Foreign Information Service tenure===
On November 27, 2007, Băsescu nominated Ungureanu to head the Foreign Information Service (SIE), the directorship of which had been vacant since Claudiu Săftoiu&#x27;s March 19 resignation, related to the same scandal in Iraq. A joint session of Parliament confirmed Ungureanu in his new position on December 5, with 295 of 318 MPs present voting in favour.

===Prime minister===
On February 6, 2012, Ungureanu was given a mandate by President Traian Băsescu to form a new government, which the Romanian parliament approved on February 9, 2012. Ungureanu vowed to continue reforms and promote Romania&#x27;s economic and political stability amid the country&#x27;s political crisis. As prime minister, Ungureanu had become the Democratic Liberal Party&#x27;s probable candidate for the presidency when Băsescu&#x27;s term expired in 2014, senior party members said, a move echoing Russia&#x27;s President Boris Yeltsin&#x27;s choice and promotion of Vladimir Putin. After two and a half months, Ungureanu&#x27;s cabinet failed to pass a no-confidence vote introduced by the Social Liberal Union. Opposition leader Victor Ponta on 7 May 2012 replaced him as prime minister.

===After prime ministership===
The political activity of Ungureanu after the premiership was intensive. In July 2012, he founded the non-governmental organization of Center-Right Civic Initiative (ICCD), together with PDL leaders Cristian Preda and Monica Macovei. He spoke about a political and electoral forces, without PNL. The alliance was founded in late August 2012 and include Democratic Liberal Party (PDL), Christian Democratic National Peasants&#x27; Party (PNȚCD), New Republic Party and Center-Right Civic Initiative. On 31 August, Ungureanu joined Civic Force (FC).

===Civic Force leadership===
Ungureanu was elected the Head of the party during The Civic Force party congress in September 2012. Civic Force Party (PFC) became the &quot;electoral vehicle&quot; of ICCD and replaced the ONG in Right Romania Alliance (ARD) membership. After the election, Ungureanu started a European tournee for the accession of PFC to European People&#x27;s Party (EPP). On 11 September, he met with the Italian deputy and member of The People of Freedom (PdL), Claudio Scajola, the Mayor of Rome and Giovanni Battista Re, secretary of Holy See. They welcomed the formation of &quot;an alliance of right in the opposition of left attacks&quot;.

Ungureanu reorganized the party, founding new branches of the PFC around the country. He has held discussions with the former Italian Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi, the President of EPP, Wilfried Martens, the Secretary-General of PdL, Angelino Alfano, the Secretary-General of Union for a Popular Movement, Jean-François Copé, and the leader of EPP europarliamentary group, Joseph Daul on the accession of Civic Force at EPP. According to him, the accession folder of the party was accepted and FC started the accession process.

Ungureanu won a seat in the Senate on ARD&#x27;s party list in the 2012 elections.

==Personal life==
Ungureanu is married and has one son. He is fluent in three foreign languages (English, French, and German) and he also reads Hungarian.

<doc id="1343569" wikidata="Q7669631" url="?curid=1343569" title="TCBY">
<text>TCBY (The Country&#x27;s Best Yogurt) is an American chain of frozen yogurt stores. It is one of the largest U.S. retailers of soft-serve frozen yogurt.

==History==
In 1981, Frank D. Hickingbotham opened the first TCBY in Little Rock, Arkansas. TCBY began franchising the following year, and by 1984 there were over 100 stores.

Prior to 1984, the company&#x27;s name was &quot;This Can&#x27;t Be Yogurt,&quot; but a lawsuit from a competitor, I Can&#x27;t Believe It&#x27;s Yogurt!, forced TCBY to create a new name from its initials, eventually using &quot;The Country&#x27;s Best Yogurt&quot;. TCBY began co-branding with Taco Bell, McDonald&#x27;s, Subway, and Burger King in 1995.

In 1991 TCBY moved into the tallest building in Mississippi, the seven-story Simmons Tower located in downtown Little Rock, and the building was renamed The TCBY Tower until 2000 when TCBY vacated.

Mrs. Fields acquired TCBY in early 2000 and became Mrs. Fields Famous Brands. The combined company relocated headquarters to Broomfield, Colorado in 2012.

TCBY was also present in Honduras, Costa Rica and Nicaragua for several years, but closed all of its branches.
In 2001, there were 1,777 TCBY locations across the country. By 2011, after several waves of closings, there were 405.

==Products and promotions==
TCBY offers frozen yogurt in a variety of flavors. The chain typically serves hard scooped and soft serve yogurt, while newer concept stores only offer soft serve. The new concept stores follow a self-service model, with customers being charged by weight. Soft serve yogurt comes in Golden Vanilla, Chocolate, and White Chocolate Mousse flavors, in addition to various rotating flavors. TCBY also serves drinks such as Berriyo yogurt smoothies and Frappe Chillers.

In September 2010, TCBY announced the test launch of breakfast and lunch meal replacement bowls, parfaits and smoothies made from non-frozen &quot;fresh&quot; yogurt called Yovana-Simply Yogurt in two self-service company stores in its headquarters of Salt Lake City.

2010 also saw the opening of a prototype store in Salt Lake City, operating under a different business model. Instead of customers ordering and being served in a traditional fashion, they serve themselves using any combination of available yogurt flavors, add their own mix of fruit or candy toppings, and pay by the ounce.

In May 2011, TCBY launched Super Fro-Yo, a reformulated version of its yogurt with a more nutrient-rich profile. The company brought down the fat content of its yogurt to below 2 percent, so it can be labeled low fat. On January 10, 2012, TCBY launched a Greek frozen yogurt product. TCBY is the first frozen yogurt chain to offer Greek frozen yogurt.

Every year, TCBY offers mothers across the nation a free frozen yogurt on Mother&#x27;s Day, and fathers a free frozen yogurt on Father&#x27;s Day.

===Store giveaway===
In October 2009, TCBY launched the &quot;This Could Be Yours: The Great TCBY Store Giveaway,&quot; a contest that rewarded one person with their own TCBY store. To enter, contestants submitted a video, no longer than two minutes, explaining why they should be the recipient of their very own TCBY, why their town is the perfect location, and what they have to offer the brand. Submissions were judged on creativity, a sense of business acumen and originality. Originally, videos were accepted until November 30, 2009, but the deadline was extended until March 31, 2010. On May 26, 2010, it was announced that the winners of the contest were Jared and Sarah Greer of Fayetteville, Arkansas. The Greers opened their store in April 2011 in Rogers, Arkansas with TCBY&#x27;s new self-serve prototype and store design.

<doc id="1343577" wikidata="Q5151357" url="?curid=1343577" title="Come to My Window">
<text>&quot;Come to My Window&quot; is a song by American singer-songwriter Melissa Etheridge, released in 1993 as the second single from her fourth studio album, &quot;Yes I Am&quot; (1993). This was the first song to become a hit after Etheridge publicly announced that she was a lesbian. With the driving force of gay rights, the song gained substantial airplay on radio stations, mostly through call-in requests.

&quot;Come to My Window&quot; reached number 25 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart and stayed on the chart for 44 weeks. The song also charted in Canada, reaching number 13 on the &quot;RPM&quot; Top Singles chart. It was the second song from Etheridge that earned her a Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance. In 2019, &quot;Billboard&quot; included &quot;Come to My Window&quot; in its list of the &quot;30 Lesbian Love Songs&quot;.

==Song information==
When the song was being promoted, a portion of the song&#x27;s beginning was omitted. This was to help accommodate some radio stations that wanted an instrumental beginning rather than a vocal one. The song&#x27;s lyrics describes the intense love that Etheridge has for another person. It describes situations that she is willing to endure and how happy the other person makes her feel. In addition, the song implicitly alludes to the singer&#x27;s sexual orientation and activism by the lyrics:

:&quot;I don&#x27;t care what they think.
:I don&#x27;t care what they say.
:What do they know about this love, anyway?&quot;

Etheridge tells both in her autobiography and during the interview on the bonus DVD of her greatest hits album that out of all songs she has written, &quot;Come to My Window&quot; is the one that surprises her the most, and that she almost did not put it on the album. She states that while she wrote the song, she did not realize what she was actually writing and that it was not before meeting Tammy Lynn Michaels that she understood what this song means to other people. She also says that it has the best musical bridge part of all her songs.

The sound effect at the beginning was created by Mauricio Fritz Lewak who put coins inside of a pair of clash cymbals. This song was also about her girlfriend at the time.

==Reaction==
===Critical reception===
Dave Sholin from the &quot;Gavin Report&quot; wrote &quot;Singer/songwriter extraordinaire, Melissa Etheridge is never short on provocative imagery in any of her songs. She delivers one of her most powerful yet, which is supported by an equally riveting video.&quot; Sam Wood from &quot;Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; felt &quot;Come to My Window&quot; &quot;features the same annoying strummed tag line that seems to infect too much of what is called women&#x27;s music. Etheridge may have intended to pay homage to her ghettoized sisters, but flaunting the contrived, amateurish chordal figure does nothing to add to the authenticity of the song. It just sinks it.&quot;

===Accolades===
==Music video==
The black-and-white music video for &quot;Come to My Window&quot;, directed by Samuel Bayer, cuts between a mental patient (Juliette Lewis) and Etheridge playing her guitar and singing. The video also features &quot;child-like&quot; drawings in certain scenes. According to an episode of VH1&#x27;s &quot;Pop Up Video&quot;, these drawings were created by a crew member&#x27;s five-year-old daughter. Additionally, the video was to have included an appearance by a little girl; the mental patient&#x27;s &quot;lost childhood&quot;. While the appearance was filmed, it got lost during editing.

==Live performances==
Etheridge performed &quot;Come to My Window&quot; during The Concert for New York City, the benefit concert following the September 11, 2001 attacks. 
The song was played by the World Wrestling Federation in the background of a tribute to wrestler Owen Hart who died during a match.

Etheridge also appeared on an episode of &quot;The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills&quot;, singing &quot;Come to My Window&quot; at a fundraiser for Homeless Not Toothless at Dorit and Paul Kemsley&#x27;s home.

<doc id="1343581" wikidata="Q12963584" url="?curid=1343581" title="Egghead (DC Comics)">
<text>Egghead (Edgar Heed) is a fictional character created for the 1960s &quot;Batman&quot; television series. Played by Vincent Price, the character was identifiable by his pale bald head and white and yellow suit. He believes himself to be &quot;the world&#x27;s smartest criminal&quot;, and his crimes usually have an egg motif to them; he also includes egg-related puns in his speech and uses various egg-themed weapons. Additionally, Egghead used deductive reasoning to deduce Batman&#x27;s secret identity.

==Background==
Egghead was one of several characters created specifically for the TV series, alongside King Tut, Shame, the Siren, Chandell, the Bookworm. Egghead would go on to appear on &quot;Batman&quot; comic books and other media, just as Harley Quinn later first appeared in &quot;&quot; before being introduced to the comics.

There had been several minor characters known as Egghead, but they were bald secondary gangsters that had little to do with the TV series character. The first, spelled Egg-Head, was an associate, along with bespectacled Fish-Eyes, of jewel thief Michael Baffle in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #63 (May 1942). Another Egghead was in Mike Optik&#x27;s gang in &quot;Dick Grayson, Telegraph Boy!&quot; in &quot;Batman&quot; #22 (April-May 1944). He was not very intelligent, and Professor Hendricks tricked him into thinking he was on a rocket in outer space to get him to reveal the location of Optik&#x27;s hideout.

Marvel Comics&#x27; Egghead debuted in December 1962&#x27;s &quot;Tales to Astonish&quot; #38.

==Fictional character biography==
===Batman (1966)===

Introduced in the second season consecutive episodes &quot;An Egg Grows in Gotham&quot; and &quot;The Yegg Foes in Gotham&quot;, Egghead joins forces with Chief Screaming Chicken (Edward Everett Horton) of the Mohican Indian tribe to revert control of Gotham City to the chief&#x27;s people in exchange for governing the city allowing the criminal underground to run amok, only to be foiled by Batman and Robin.

In the third season, Egghead is joined by his new partner and love interest Olga, Queen of the Cossacks (Anne Baxter), as they attempt to hatch an egg containing a &quot;Neosaurus&quot; and feed Robin and Batgirl to it and steal the Sword of Bulbul and the Egg of Ogg, only to be foiled by Batman on both occasions. In &quot;The Entrancing Dr. Cassandra&quot;, the titular Cassandra Spellcraft and her husband Cabala free Egghead, among other criminals, from prison to help them take over Gotham, giving them camouflage pills to better facilitate their crime spree and promising Egghead control of Gotham&#x27;s poultry farms.

===Comics===

Egghead first comic appearance was an unnamed cameo in &quot;&quot; #3-4. He appears as an inmate of Arkham Asylum before he is freed by Jeremiah Arkham and fights Batman.

Egghead&#x27;s first named appearance was in the 2010 issue of &quot;&quot; #16. Here he has teamed up with an egg-shaped villain named Ygg&#x27;Phu Soggoth. This comic is the first to give Egghead the name Edgar Heed.

<doc id="1343586" wikidata="Q2690025" url="?curid=1343586" title="Tell Qasile">
<text>Tell Qasile is an archaeological site near the Yarkon River in Tel Aviv, Israel. Over 3,000 years old, the site contains the remains of a port city founded by the Philistines in the 12th century BC. 

Prior to 1948, it was on the village lands of Al-Shaykh Muwannis, which was depopulated in the 1948 war. While the war was still ongoing, in late 1948, the site was given the first archaeological permit by the newly declared of state of Israel. Today it is located on the grounds of the Eretz Israel Museum, which was built in 1953.

Prior to these first excavations, two important ostraca were discovered at the site in 1945-96, by Jacob Kaplan and Robert Hoff.

== Identification suggestions ==
At first it was suggested to identify Tell Qasila with &quot;Glil Yam&quot;, a place mentioned on an inscription of Tiglath-Pileser III. A later suggestion was to identify it with the phrase from the Book of Joshua &quot;Mi Yarkon&quot;, stating it is a city and not a stream.

Archeologist Dr. Dror Ben-Yosef suggested identifying the site as &quot;Beit Haran&quot; based on the two 7th century BCE ostraca found at the site as they read: &quot;Gold of Ophir to Beit Haran, 30 shekels&quot;. He claimed that this was a shipment destinated to Beith Haran, located in that area.

==Excavation history==

In 1815, after excavating the ruins of ancient Ashkelon, Lady Hester Stanhope proposed a dig at a site called el-Khurby located 12 miles northeast of Jaffa on the banks of the Awgy River (today the Yarkon River). Stanhope&#x27;s companion observed that “there were many proofs that this district was once highly populous.”

In 1946 the Tell was rediscovered by Jacob Kaplan who found two Ostraca written in Hebrew dating to the First Temple period. Both of them were shipping certificates, On the first was a description if the weight of thirty Shekels of Ophir gold being sent to Bethoron. The second mentioned one thousand one hundred units of oil being sent to the king. The second Ostracone was signed but all left of the signature were the letters: &quot;חיהו&quot; 

Benjamin Mazar received the first archaeological exploration permit issued by the state of Israel to excavate there in 1948 and continued excavating the site in 1949 and 1950. He directed subsequent excavation at the site in 1971 to 1974 and again from 1982 to 1990. In 1955 a Byzantine grave was found by chance which led to another excavation at the Tell. In 1957 another excavation was conducted by Jacob Kaplan who uncovered two Hasmonean rock cut tombs. Further excavation were held in 1959. Between the years 1970-1974 and from 1982 to the 90&#x27;s, further excavations were done which uncovered the Philistine temples.The excavations revealed the gradual development of the Philistine city over 150 years, from its founding (Level XII) to the peak of its growth (Level X) at the end of the 11th century BC. 

==Archaeological findings==

The sacred area of the Philistine city was unearthed to reveal three temples, built one on top of the other. The temples were constructed with walls of sun-dried mud bricks covered with light-colored plaster. Low benches were built along the length of the walls. Many offering and cult vessels were found on the floors, concentrated mainly around the &quot;bamah&quot; and in the storage alcoves of the temples. A residential block was found on the north side of the street, while in the south side workshops and storehouses were unearthed. The houses were built to a standard plan - they were square, with an area of approximately 100 square meters per apartment. Each apartment comprised two rectangular rooms with a courtyard separating them.

== History ==

=== Bronze Age ===
Based on potsherds found at the site there was a temporary settlement during the Middle Bronze Age II A. Parallel to the arrival of the Philistines to the Land of Canaan in 12th century BC, a permanent settlement begins at the site. As the Tel is closer to the Yarkon estuary and located on a Kurkar ridge, the Philistines choose to establish an inner harbor on the river banks.

The settlement layout was of a temple located at its center and a dense core round it. The residential houses were built around it. The small temple building had a single hall and a large courtyard. Next to the temple was another building known as &quot;Beit HaAch&quot;, Known at that period from places like Ashkelon, Ashdod and several regions of the Aegean world

From the 11th century BC the Tell Qasila settlement began to grow evident in the larger structures, thicker and stronger stone walls. In the temple&#x27;s courtyard a pit was dug and various cult objects were found in it. As Tell Qasila reached its peak in the middle of the 11th century BC, the temple was enlarged and a room was built to store treasures of worship. A protective wall was built round the courtyard that now had an altar. The importance of the temple&#x27;s development was written: &quot;At the site, the remains of three temples were discovered that were built one on top of the other, and each of them was an extension of the previous one, which probably indicates an increase in the number of residents in the city&quot;.A secondary smaller temple was built next to the main one. South of the temples were the residential houses of about 100 sqm, built in the Four-room house design. Many of the findings in the Tell and temple, like clay jugs for oil and wine, bronze vessels and seals. These finds testify for the Philistine and Aegean influence on the Land of Israel as well as the lifestyle and trade relations with Tyre, Sidon, ancient Egypt and Cyprus. On this it is written: &quot;The Philistine culture, as it is revealed to our eyes from the excavations at Tell Qasila and other Philistine sites, is a developed urban culture. At Tell Qasila you can see the signs of careful urban planning... This developed culture existed at a time when many Canaanite cities, such as Hazor in the Galilee and Kish in the Lowlands, were in ruins , and the tribes of Israel lived in the mountain areas and the interior lowlands in agricultural villages and in a tribal framework, before the establishment of the monarchy&quot;.

==== The Iron Age ====
During this period a small settlement was built on the Tell, most likely by Philistines as the temple was rebuilt. By the end of the 10th century the place was abandoned and renewed only at the end of the 7th century BC, probably due to the expansion of the Kingdom of Judah westwards at the time of king Joshia. The two ostraca are assumed to be from this period. The Latter findings include a building from the end of the 6th century BC (Return to Zion), next to it a square well, a coin from the time of Alexander the Great and a number of relics from the Hellenistic and the Roman period, as well as winepress from the Roman period. During the Byzantine period there was a sparse rural settlement around Tell Qasila. To the north east was a 6th-century Samaritan Synagogue with a mosaic floor that is today at the museum. The floor shows Three inscriptions, one in Samaritan and two in Greek two of them indicate the names of donors and the wording of the third is:

&quot;Blessings and peace on Israel and on this place. Amen&quot;.

During the early Muslim period in the Land of Israel there was a Khan on the Tell and that is the latest building documented. The latest structure known to stand on the mound is the khan that lived there during the early Muslim period in the Land of Israel. After it was destroyed, the mound was not inhabited again, except during the First World War, when the mound was used as a pillar in the western part of the line of the two Aujas, along which the Ottoman army forces that were arrayed against the Egyptian expeditionary force stationed south of Yarkon dug in. The Turks dug trenches in the mound, and fragments of British shells were also discovered there.

===== Caravanserai =====
Excavations in the 1980s revealed a large courtyard building, dating from the Abbasid era. The building has been dated by its excavators to a period between the ninth and eleventh century, though both earlier (Umayyad) and later (Crusader) occupations of the site were found.
The design of the building and its position (at a river crossing point), indicate that it was a caravanserai.

Only the northern part of the building was excavated, the rest only visible as robber trenches. From the excavated parts, it is estimated that the building was 28 meters square. A paved entrance in the middle of the north wall led to a courtyard, paved with gravel. The courtyard had arcades on the east and west sides, supported by columns. In the northwest corner of the courtyard were the remains of a staircase. Several small rooms lining the courtyard were exposed.

<text>Kulottunga Chola I (&#x27;; [[Middle Tamil]]: Kulōttuṅka Cōḻaṉ; [[Classical Sanskrit]]: Kulottuṅgā Cōḷa; 1025–1122) also speltKulothunga(), bornRajendra Chalukya (Telugu: Rājēndra Cāḷukyuḍu), was a Chola Emperor who reigned from 1070 to 1122 succeeding his cousin Athirajendra Chola. He also served as the Eastern Chalukya monarch from 1061 to 1118, succeeding his father Rajaraja Narendra. He is related to the Chola dynasty through his mother&#x27;s side and the Eastern Chalukyas through his father&#x27;s side. His mother, Ammangaidevi, was a Chola princess and the daughter of emperor Rajendra Chola I. His father was king Rajaraja Narendra of the Eastern Chalukya dynasty who was the nephew of Rajendra and maternal grandson of Rajaraja Chola I. According to historian Sailendra Nath Sen, his accession marked the beginning of a new era and ushered in a period of internal peace and benevolent administration. He was succeeded by his son Vikrama Chola

Kulottunga had diplomatic relations with the northern Indian city Kannauj and also with distant countries like Cambodia, Srivijaya, Khmer, Pagan (Burma) and China. He established Chola overlordship over the Srivijayan province of Kedah in Malay Peninsula. An inscription in a Taoist temple in Guangzhou, dated to 1079, declares Kulottunga, king of Chulien (Chola) to be the supreme chief of the Land of San-fo-tsi (Srivijaya). According to Tan Yeok Seong, the editor of the inscription, Kulottunga ruled both the Chola and Srivijayan kingdoms. In the small Leyden grant that is dated to 1090, the king of Kadaram (Srivijaya) is mentioned as a vassal of Kulottunga. Like his predecessors, Kulottunga was a patron of arts and literature and the much celebrated Tamil poem Kalingattuparani was composed during his rule by poet Jayamkondaan who lived in his court. His records also testify to the highly organised system of fiscal and local administration. During his reign Kulottunga carried out a massive land survey that formed the basis for taxation.

Kulottunga died around 1122 around the age of 97, although this is disputed. This makes him one of the longest living monarchs in the Middle Ages. He was succeeded by his son Vikrama Chola. According to historian Nilakanta Sastri, Kulottunga avoided unnecessary wars and evinced a true regard for the well-being of his subjects. He had a long and prosperous reign characterized by unparalleled success that laid the foundation for the well being of the empire for the next 150 years.

==Birth and early life==

Kulottunga was born under the star of Pusya around 1025. The details of the king&#x27;s family and parentage are available from a number of grants and plates like the one from Chelluru (a village in Rayavaram Mandalam of Konaseema district) that was issued by his son, prince Vira Chola, and from literary works, such as the famous poem Kalingattupparani. Kulottunga was the maternal grandson of Emperor Rajendra Chola I through the latter&#x27;s daughter Ammangadevi. His father was the Eastern Chalukya king Rajaraja Narendra who himself was the son of Kundavai, the younger sister of Rajendra Chola I and the daughter of Rajaraja I. Rajaraja Narendra married princess Ammangadevi, the daughter of his maternal uncle, Rajendra Chola I of the solar ra. The latter is described as &quot;the ornament of the race of the sun&quot; in the Chellur plates of Vira Chola. The poem Kalingattuparani gives the details of Kulottunga&#x27;s birth in the canto &quot;Avataram&quot; (incarnation), wherein his mother is described as belonging to the solar race and his father to the lunar ra. Kulottunga is described as an avatar of the Hindu god Vishnu in the canto. An excerpt from the poem reads:

Vishnu appeared again in the royal womb of the queen of him of the race of the moon which dispels all darkness, ... Rajaraja&#x27;s gracious Lakshmi (queen) who was of the rival race of the sun.

As a Chola prince he conquered the Sri Vijaya province Kedah and Chakrakota province (Bastar-Kalahandi district-Koraput region) on behalf of his maternal uncle, emperor Virarajendra Chola, in the 11th century.

==Accession==
According to the Tamil poem Kalingattuparani, Kulottunga was brought up in the court of Rajendra Chola I in Gangaikondacholapuram. During his youth, Kulottunga participated in many wars, serving alongside both Rajendra Chola I and his successors, Rajadhiraja I, Rajendra Chola II and Virarajendra Chola. During this period, he engaged in the northern campaigns of the empire in and around Sakkarakottam and Vayiragaram where he secured several victories and proved his mettle in warfare. The Sakkarakottam area is identified with the present day Bastar-Kalahandi district-Koraput region which together formed the Chakrakota province back in medieval times. According to Kalingattuparani, it was around this time that Mannar-Mannavan, that is, the &quot;king of kings&quot;, suddenly died and the empire was thrown into a state of anarchy until Abhaya, that is Kulottunga, returned and restored order.

The Teki, Chellur and Pithapuram grants of Kulottunga&#x27;s sons, dated in the 17th, 21st and 23rd years of the king&#x27;s reign, state that in the absence of the king&#x27;s father, Rajaraja Narendra, Kulottunga was first crowned as the lord of Vengi where he obtained great fame. As per the plates. the king was later crowned in the Chola Rajya, a position said to be not less exalted than Devendra (Indra). These events are narrated as a flashback story in the Chellur grant, wherein Kulottunga explains to his son, prince Vira Chola, that he left Vengi to his (Kulottunga&#x27;s) paternal uncle (Vijayaditya) as he (Kulottunga) desired the Chola kingdom.

Other sources like Vikramankadevacharita, a work on the western Chalukya Vikramaditya VI by his court poet Bilhana, and Vikraman Solan Ula, a work on Kulottunga&#x27;s son and successor Vikrama Chola by poet Ottakoothar, corroborate these events more or less and both works agree that there was a king between Virarajendra Chola and Kulottunga. This king has been identified with Adhirajendra and it is after the death of this Chola king that the kingdom was thrown into a state of anarchy. According to Vikramankadevacharita, Kulottunga got dislodged from Vengi due to some confusion in the Chola kingdom after the death of Virarajendra Chola. Even during the time of Virarajendra Chola, Vikramaditya VI and the Eastern Ganga king Rajaraja Devendravarman both supported Vijayaditya, the paternal uncle of Kulottunga, in his claim to the Vengi kingdom. Kulottunga is then said to have marched south to the Chola capital. Bilhana goes on to state that his patron, Vikramaditya VI, tried stopping Kulottunga from ascending the Chola throne by instead installing Adhirajendra (Vikramaditya&#x27;s brother-in-law) as king. However this arrangement was short-lived and Kulottunga eventually succeeded in capturing the throne. Historian Nilakanta Sastri argues against the theories proposed by Fleet and other similar historians, about a hostile invasion of the Chola empire by Kulottunga. In Sastri&#x27;s words, &quot;the work Vikramankadevacarita does not contain the remotest suggestion that Kulottunga put his rivals out of the way by secret murder or even by open fighting&quot;.

Ottakoothar&#x27;s &quot;Vikrama Cholan Ula&quot; mentions Kulottunga&#x27;s reign:

Kulottunga&#x27;s own inscriptions also speak of the lack of leadership in the Chola country before ascension and in his records the king claims that he rightfully inherited the excellent crown of the Cholas. The king&#x27;s epigraphs poetically claim that he ascended the throne to prevent the goddess Lakshmi of Southern region from becoming common property (an allusion to the illegitimate claims to the throne and meddling of affairs by kings of rival kingdoms), and to remove the loneliness of the goddess of the Chola country adorned by river Ponni (an allusion to the power vacuum in the empire). Thus it was under these circumstances that Kulottunga ascended the Chola throne in 1070 and established himself by soon overcoming the threats to the Chola empire. According to Sastri, Kulottunga was in his teens or barely into his twenties when he ascended the throne. Military campaigns

=== Sakkarakottam ===

When Kulottunga was still a prince, he participated in many of the northern campaigns of his predecessor Virarajendra Chola. In the fifth year of his reign Virarajendra Chola dispatched his army to Kalinga and beyond it to Sakkarakottam. These expeditions appear to have been led by Kulottunga, who in his inscriptions claims that while he was still heir-apparent, he overcame the treachery of his enemies and by the strength of his arm and sword captured herds of elephants at Vayiragaram, conquered Sakkarakottam and graciously took tribute from the king of Dhara. Vayiragaram is identified with Wairagarh, a few miles off Bastar in the Chanda district and Sakkarakottam is the area in and around Bastar-Kalahandi-Koraput region which was called as the Chakrakota mandala in medieval times. Dhara is the Nagavanshi king Dharavarsha who was the ruler of Sakkarakottam during this period. The &quot;treachery&quot; that Kulottunga speaks of is an allusion to the internal politics of the empire and the schemes of his rivals who sought to deny him his rightful inheritan. According to Sastri, in spite of these setbacks, Kulottunga was successful in carving out a small principality for himself, north of Vengi, for Kulottunga claims that he gently raised the goddess of the earth residing in the &quot;Land of the rising sun&quot; and placed her under the shade of his parasol just like god Vishnu, who in his Varaha avatar lifted the earth.

== Conflict on Southern India ==

===Western Chalukya conflicts===
The western Chalukya-Chola rivalry goes back to the beginning of the 10th century. The Western Chalukyas waged many wars with the Chola emperors and on each occasion the wars ended with the Cholas chasing their rivals, the Chalukyas, out of the battlefield, occupying their capital, with death of their generals or feudatories and levying tribute. Tailapa II and his son Satyashraya, who were opponents of Raja Raja Chola I and Rajendra Chola I, ended up being defeated at Annigeri and at Kogali respectively, Jayasimha was defeated in Kadambalige, Ahavamalla Someshwara I suffered defeats many a time at the hands of Rajadhiraja Chola, and lost his brother Jayasingan in battle with Rajendra Chola II.

After Rajadhiraja Chola I and Rajendra Chola II, their brother Virarajendra Chola defeated Ahavamalla Someshwara I on not less than five occasions. Virarajendra Chola also put to flight the latter&#x27;s two sons, Vikkalan (Vikramaditya VI) and Singanan (Jayasimha III), multiple times in the battles of Kudala sangama. Virarajendra Chola also defeated the eldest son of Ahavamalla Someshwara I, and crown-prince Someshwara II in Kampili, and spoiled his coronation ceremony. Ahavamalla Someshwara I seems to have died in the reign of Virarajendra Chola as there is no mention of him in Kulottunga&#x27;s records. This is evident from a record of Virarajendra Chola, who in his fifth year states that unable to bear the disgrace of his earlier defeats, Ahavamalla Someshwara I wrote a letter to the Chola calling for war, but in the end never showed up and instead fled and plunged himself into the ocean. This is conceded in Bilhana&#x27;s Vikramankadevacharita, a work on the life of Vikramaditya VI who claims that Ahavamalla Someshwara I died around this time by committing ritual suicide by drowning himself in the Tungabhadra. Upon his father&#x27;s death, Vikramaditya VI approached Virarajendra and sued for peace and the Chola agreed as he saw in him an ally to counter and nullify the crown-prince Someshvara II. Accordingly, the Chola offered his daughter&#x27;s hand in marriage, bestowed upon him the Rattapadi-seven-and-a-half-lakh country and made him the Vallabha (Chalukyan king). Vikramaditya readily accepted the deal for he had his own plans to overthrow his elder brother, which he would eventually accomplish and then usurp the throne. There was also another contender, Vijayaditya, on whom Virarajendra had bestowed Vengi towards the end of his reign. Some historians identify this Vijayaditya with the Eastern Chalukyan prince and half-brother of Rajaraja Narendra while others like Venkayya suggest that this person was yet another younger brother of Vikramaditya VI. That this Vijayaditya was an ally of Vikramaditya VI is evident from an inscription of Rajadhiraja Chola I. So at the end of Virarajendra reign, Kulottunga found himself facing Vikkalan (Vikramaditya VI), the latter&#x27;s younger brother Singanan (Jayasimha), their elder brother Someshwara II and their younger brother or ally Vijayaditya.

It was clear from the time Kulottunga ascended the throne that a confrontation with the Western Chalukyas was imminent as Vikramaditya VI could never accept the union of the Chola and Vengi kingdoms under the same ruler, let alone Kulottunga accession, for it simply meant an enemy too powerful. Kulottunga knew this from the very beginning and accordingly made preparations for the showdown. In 1075-76, the war began with the incursion of the Chalukyan forces into the Chola territories and the two armies met in the Kolar district. What followed was the Chola counter-attack popularly known as the Nangili episode. In the ensuing battle, the Chalukyan army was completely routed and chased by the Chola forces from the rocky roads of Nangili all the way to the Tungabhadra via Manalur. Vikramaditya is said to have retreated hastily and fled, leaving behind the corpses of his dead elephants along the way. Kulottunga captured a thousand elephants at Navilai and conquered two provinces the Gangamandalam (the province of the Western Ganga dynasty) and Singanam as a direct result of this war. Navilai has been identified with Navale-nadu in the Mysore district, and Singanam referred to the region of Jayasimha, the younger brother of Vikramaditya VI. The word Konkana desam (country of Konkan) is substituted for the word Singanam in some of the records. Kulottunga, in his records, claims that at the end of this war, he broke the pride of Vikramaditya VI and that Vikkalan (Vikramaditya VI) and Singanan (Jayasimha) had nowhere to retreat except to plunge into the western ocean. Some other records of Kulottunga state that Vikramaditya VI fled back to his own dominion (north of the Tungabhadra), his pride broken, and that he (Vikramaditya VI) was happy to be there as the Chalukya did not go to war with the Chola for a long time. This is conceded by Bilhana in the Vikramankadevacarita, wherein he states that after these initial wars, there was a long period of peace (about half a century) between the two kingdoms.

===Pandya campaign===
&quot;Corrections by M. G. S. Narayanan on K. A. Nilakanta Sastri are employed.&quot;Once he finished dealing with Vikramaditya VI, Kulottunga turned his attention to the south and first took up the cause of bringing the ancient Pandimandalam, the country of the Pandyas, into his fold. The Pandya country never reconciled to the Chola overlordship and its rulers were a constant source of trouble for the Chola emperors. The Pandyas made use of the confusion in the Chola country during the accession of Kulottunga and tried once again to reassert their independence.

Back in the days of Rajendra Chola I, the Pandya country was ruled over by Chola-Pandya viceroys, but by the time of Kulottunga, this system had ceased to exist and &quot;Five Pandya&quot; princes from the old line rose against the king. Kulottunga could not take this situation lightly as the loss of the Pandya territories meant a serious threat to the existence of the Chola kingdom itself. As soon as the Chalukyan war ended, Kulottunga turned all his energy to the suppression of the revolts in the Pandya territory (c. 1077-1081 AD). According to the Cholapuram inscription (1100 AD) the Cholas marched south with a huge army, conquered the Pandya country, the forests were the Five Pandya entered as refugees, the Pearl Fisheries, the Podiyil and Sahya Mountains, and Kanya Kumari and fixed the boundaries of the South Country (the Pandya country) at Kottar. Another inscription of his, in Sanskrit (undated) from Chidambaram, gives a similar account, where the king is said to have overcome the Five Pandyas with the help of a huge army, burnt down the fort at Kottar, and erected a pillar of victory at Kanya Kumari (and thus &quot;making the rebel vassal kings obedient&quot;).

Kulottunga&#x27;s Kerala campaign is now dated c. 1097 (it was initially assumed that the 1077-81 campaign also covered the rebelling Keralas). The Chera Perumal kings, who like their Pandyan neighbours, had followed suit and rebelled against their Chola overlords. Naralokavira Kalinga Rayan, a commander of the Pandya-Chola forces, lead a Chola thrust into Kerala and captured the port of Quilon. It seems that the Chera Perumals tried to recover the port Quilon soon afterwards. The eventual southern boundary of the Chola influence was located at Kottar.

By c. 1100, Kulottunga had successfully subjugated rebelling southern regions as far as the Pandya country, annexed the Pearl Fishery Coast, the ancient Podiyil mountains (in present-day Tirunelveli), and &quot;fixed his southern boundary&quot; at Kottar. He did away with the old system of appointing Chola-Pandya viceroys and instead built multiple cantonments as far south as Kottar, and heavily garrisoned the strategically important locations of the southern dominions. These units were in charge of protecting his interests and collecting tribute but did not interfere with the internal administration of the conquered territories, a responsibility which he left to the native chiefs and feudatories. His inscriptions belonging to this period are found in Cholapuram, Agastheeswaram, Suchindram, Variyur, Kanyakumari and Kottar.

The Vengi kingdom was a bone of contention between the Cholas, the Western Chalukyas of Kalyani and the Eastern Gangas from the times of Rajaraja Chola I. It was a site for proxy war during the times of Virarajendra Chola, who managed to wrest control of it from the Western Chalukyas and bestowed it on Vijayaditya, the paternal uncle of Kulottunga. It is unclear as to why Kulottunga was overlooked in the accession of Vengi as he would have been the rightful heir. On the other hand, it is of interest to note that Vijayaditya had briefly sided with Rajaraja Devendravarman of the Eastern Gangas. So, Virarajendra Chola agreed to bestow the Vengi kingdom on Kulottunga&#x27;s paternal uncle Vijayaditya to avoid fighting wars on two fronts, that is, to avoid engaging both the Western Chalukyas and the Eastern Gangas. In any case, Kulottunga was generous enough to let his paternal uncle, the usurper Vijayaditya, to rule over Vengi even after he ascended the Chola throne. During this period in 1073, the Vengi kingdom was invaded by the Kalachuri king Yakshakarna of Tripuri. However, this was merely a raid in search of riches rather than an invasion for territorial gains, and the intruders were repulsed by Vijayaditya.

After the death of Vijayaditya in 1077, Kulottunga brought the Vengi province directly under his control and appointed his sons to rule over it. Rajaraja Chodaganga, the eldest son of Kulottunga, was first appointed as viceroy but as per inscriptions, the prince did not feel at home and returned to the Chola dominions in the south within a year. According to the Teki plates of Rajaraja Chodaganga, the Vengi province under him lay between Manneru in the Nellore district in the south and Mahendragiri in Ganjam district in the north. Rajaraja Chodaganga was followed by his brother Vira Chola who ruled for six years until 1084. The Chellur plates of Vira Chola state that he was crowned in the city of Jagannatha (Jagannatha-nagari). The two princes once again governed the Vengi province alternately for a period of five years and four years respectively. They were then followed by their brother Vikrama Chola who ruled over the region until he was made heir apparent in 1118. According to the Pithapuram pillar inscription of Mallapadeva, dated 1202, the Vengi province became devoid of a ruler and fell into a state of anarchy when Vikrama Chola left for the Chola dominions in the south towards the end of Kulottunga&#x27;s reign. Vikramaditya VI used this opportunity to occupy Vengi during this period. However, this invasion was short lived and Vikrama Chola recaptured the province and annexed it to the Chola empire as soon as he ascended the throne.

&lt;/mapframe&gt;
The kingdom of Kalinga was not a single region but rather three distinct countries called Utkala or Odra (north and north-eastern parts of Odisha), Kosala or Dakshina Kosala (south-west Odisha and Chhattisgarh) and Kalinga proper. This region comprised the whole of present-day Odisha and northern part of Andhra Pradesh. These three regions together were referred to as &quot;Trikalinga&quot;. The Kalinga kingdom bordered the northern part of Vengi and therefore it was only natural for the different rulers of Kalinga to try and expand into the Eastern Chalukya territory or in the case of Kulottunga, the northern-eastern part of the Chola dominions. During the 11th century, the Kalinga kingdom was ruled by the Eastern Ganga dynasty who invariably became involved in Vengi and thereby indirectly in the Chola politics.

The records of Kulottunga contain descriptions of two Kalinga wars. Prior to these wars, Kulottunga&#x27;s forces was decimated by Rajaraja Deva of the Eastern Ganga dynasty and Kulottunga was forced to marry his daughter (or sister) to Rajaraja Deva. Kulottunga was also forced to put his sons as the Viceroy of Kalinga. Rajaraja Deva died in 1078 and Kulottunga&#x27;s sons were in-charge of the adolescent Anantavarman Chodaganga, Rajaraja Deva&#x27;s son. 
The first war seems to have occurred before 1096 as Kulottunga first claims to have conquered Kalinga in a record dated in the 26th year of his reign. The first Kalinga war seems to have been brought about by Kalinga&#x27;s aggression against Vengi. The war resulted in the annexation of the southern part of Kalinga to the Chola kingdom. This is evident from the Teki plates of Kulottunga&#x27;s son, Rajaraja Chodaganga, whose dominions included the region up to Mahendragiri in the Ganjam district in the north.

The second invasion took place a few years later, sometime before the 33rd year of the king&#x27;s reign, and is the subject of the Kalingattuparani. This expedition was led by his general Karunakara Tondaiman who defeated the Kalinga ruler Anantavarman Chodaganga of the Eastern Ganga dynasty. Anantavarman was the son of Rajaraja Devendravarman and Chola princess Rajasundari, described as the daughter of Rajendra Chola. The identification of Anantavarman&#x27;s maternal grandfather is a controversial topic. Some historians like Sastri identify this Rajendra Chola with Virarajendra Chola while others like Kielhorn identify this king as Kulottunga. According to the poem Kalingattuparani, this relationship did not stop Kulottunga from invading Kalinga and causing Anantavarman to flee. The Chola army is said to have returned with vast booty from this campaign. This fact is also borne out by an inscription of the king from the Bhimeswara temple in Draksharama. It is dated in the 33rd year of the king&#x27;s reign and states that an officer of the king, titled variously as Pallavaraja and Vanduvaraja, reduced the whole of Kalinga to ashes, destroyed the Ganga Devendravarman in battle with the aid of the Kosala army, and planted a pillar of victory in the Odra frontier so as to raise aloft the fame of his king, Kulottunga Chola. This chief is none other than Karunakara Tondaiman as he is said to be from Thirunaraiyur nadu and the lord of Vandai as in the poem. His personal name is given as Thiruvarangan and is said to be the son of Sirilango of Vandalanjeri in Thirunaraiyur nadu. He is described as a sad-vaishnava (good vaishnavite) and is said to have built a Vishnu temple made of black stone in Alavely.

According to the poem, the reason for the second war was a response to the default of Kalinga in its payment of annual tributes to Kulottunga by Anantavarman. Another view, by some historians like Venkayya is that, Kulottunga took up the expedition in order to help his relative Anantavarman against North Kalinga rebels. Yet another view is that, Devendravarman belonged to a collateral line of the Eastern Ganga dynasty and had opposed the accession of Kulottunga&#x27;s relative Anantavarman. There is an inscription of Kulottunga from the Bhimeswara temple in Godavari district that describes a gift by the son of Anantavarmadeva. So it would seem that the latter was a vassal or at least in friendly terms with Kulottunga for sometime.

== Revolt in Sri Lanka ==
According to the Mahavamsa, the Cholas were driven out of Lanka in the 15th year of Vijayabahu which coincides with the accession date of Kulottunga. Therefore, it would seem that the Sinhalese king took the opportunity to attack the Chola forces in the island nation at a time when the kingdom under Kulottunga was dealing with multiple revolts and attacks in the mainland. In 1070, Vijayabahu attacked the Chola forces from his enclave in the Rohana district and defeated them. He sent two armies, one from Mahanagakula via Dakkinadesa, and the other via the well known route along Mahavali-Ganga. These armies defeated the Chola forces or what was left of them and captured Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa. After his victory over the Cholas, Vijayabahu got himself anointed in Anuradhapura. A few months later he moved to Polonnaruwa, renamed it as Vijayarajapura, made it his capital, and declared himself king of the island nation.

Unlike the epigraphs of his predecessors, like Rajaraja Chola I, Rajendra Chola I and Rajadhiraja Chola I, that describe the details of their expeditions to the island nation, Kulottunga&#x27;s inscriptions are generally silent in regards to Lanka or with regards to any campaigns or wars against the Sinhalese rulers. According to Sastri, Kulottunga was content with keeping the Chola empire from disintegrating on the mainland and was not that affected with the loss of the island nation.

It is of interest to note that Vijayabahu married Lilavati, the daughter of Jagatipala, a former ruler of Rohana, after she escaped from the Cholas and returned to the island kingdom. Jagatipala was originally a prince of Ayodhya who had migrated to Lanka and become ruler of Rohana. He was slain on the battlefield during the Lankan expeditions of Kulottunga&#x27;s predecessor, Rajadhiraja Chola I, when the Sinhalese kingdom lost four crowns in quick succession. At that time, this princess along with her aunt or mother was taken captive by the Chola forces. These events are described in great detail in the Mahavamsa and in an inscription of Rajadhiraja Chola I.

==Overseas trade==

Kulottunga maintained overseas contacts with kingdoms of Sri Vijaya, China and Khmer Empire. The renaming of the famous harbor of Visakhapattanam in Andhra Pradesh as Kulottungacolapattanam also indicates his interest in trade with foreign countries across the Bay of Bengal. In 1077, king Chulien (Chola) Ti-hua-kialo sent an embassy to Chinese court for promoting trade. Sastri identifies this Chola ruler with Kulottunga. This trading venture seems to have ended profitably for the Cholas and they returned with over 81,000 strings of copper cash and many more valuables. The Khmer king Suryavarman II, builder of the famous Angkor Wat, sent a mission to the Chola dynasty and presented a precious stone to Kulottunga in 1114. According to Burmese accounts, Kyanzittha, the ruler of Pagan (Burma) met with the Chola royal family by sending an ambassador to the Chola emperor. In an inscription in Pagan, he even claims to have converted the Chola to Buddhism through a personal letter written on gold foils.

There is also evidence to suggest that Kulottunga, in his youth (1063 CE), was in Sri Vijaya, restoring order and maintaining Chola influence in that area. Virarajendra Chola states in his inscription, dated in the 7th year of his reign, that he conquered Kadaram and gave it back to its king who came and worshiped his feet. These expeditions were led by Kulottunga to help the Sailendra king who had sought the help of Virarajendra Chola. An inscription of Canton mentions Ti-hua-kialo as the ruler of Sri Vijaya. According to historians, this ruler is the same as the Chola ruler Ti-hua-kialo (identified with Kulottunga) mentioned in the Song annals and who sent an embassy to China. According to Tan Yeok Song, the editor of the Sri Vijayan inscription of Canton, Kulottunga stayed in Kadaram after the naval expedition of 1067 and reinstalled its king before returning to South India and ascending the throne.

Trade relations and cultural contacts established during the reigns of Rajaraja Chola I and Rajendra Chola I were actively maintained by Kulottunga and his successors. In 1089, the ruler of Sri Vijaya sent two ambassadors to Kulottunga&#x27;s court, requesting him to renew the old grants to the Buddhist monastery (Chudamani Vihara) in Nagapattinam that was built during the period of Rajaraja Chola I.

==Extent of the empire==

The Chola kingdom remained formidable under Kulottunga in his 45th regnal year (c. 1115 CE). Except for the loose hold over Lanka, the rest of the empire remained intact. The boundary between the Cholas and the Western Chalukyas was as always the Tungabhadra river. The hold over Vengi was quite firm, and Dakkina Kosala (south-west Kalinga) and some parts of Kalinga (proper) including the capital Kalinganagara, the modern Mukhalingam in the Srikakulam district, was under the Chola rule. Port Quilon, on the Malabar Coast, was recovered by prince Vikrama Chola sometime between c. 1102 and c. 1118.

Towards the end of Kulottunga&#x27;s reign, when his son Vikrama Chola, the viceroy of Vengi left south for the latter&#x27;s coronation, the northern half of the Vengi kingdom seems to have slipped from his hands and gone to the Western Chalukya empire under Vikramaditya VI. According to some historians, during this period, Kulottunga also lost the province of Gangavadi, the province of the Western Gangas, to Hoysala Vishnuvardhana. The latter seems to have attacked and defeated the Chola Viceroy, Adigaiman, the controller of the Kongu and Kannada country.

== Administration ==

Kulottunga&#x27;s capital was Gangaikondacholapuram. Kanchi was next in importance and had a palace and an &quot;abhisheka mandapam&quot; (royal bathing hall) from where the king issued many of his charters. The king&#x27;s inscriptions speak of a highly organized form of fiscal and local administration. He carried out a massive land survey which formed the basis for taxation. He promoted free trade by abolishing tolls or transit duties and came to be known as &quot;Sungamtavirrton&quot;, that is, &quot;one who abolished tolls&quot;. Kulottunga did away with the old system of appointing Chola-Pandya viceroys in the southern territories. The king, instead built military cantonments that were in charge of protecting his interests and collecting tribute, but did not interfere with the internal administration of the conquered territories, a responsibility which he left to the native chiefs and feudatories.

Kulottunga was ably assisted in his campaigns and internal administration by his officials some of whom were; Karunakara Tondaiman, described as the minister and warrior of Abhaya; Solakon who distinguished himself in the campaigns in the west against the Kongos, Gangas and Mahrattas; the Brahmin Kannan of great fortress; Vanan (possibly the Bana Vanavaraiyan also called Suttamallan Mudikondan) who is said to be dexterous in the use of his beautiful bow in battle; the general Naralokaviran alias Kalingar-kon who distinguished himself in the Pandya and south Kerala wars; Kadava: Vailava, the lord of Chedi (Malayaman) country; Senapati (General) Anantapala; the Irungovel chieftain, Adavallan Gangaikonda Cholan alias Irungolan; the royal secretary (&quot;Tirumandira-olai&quot;), Arumoli-Vilupparaiyar; and the accountant, Arumoli-Porkari. Gonka I, a vassal from the Velanati Chodas family was greatly responsible for the political stability of the Chola power in the Vengi region. In appreciation of his services, the emperor conferred on Gonka I the lordship over 6000 villages on the southern bank of the Krishna River.

==Family and personal life==








=== Royal House ===

Kulottunga&#x27;s chief queen was Dinachintamani, others being Elisaivallabhi and Thiyagavalli. Copper-plate grants state that Kulottunga married Madurantaki, the daughter of Rajendradeva of the Solar ra, and had by her seven sons. According to some historians, she is identical with Dinachintamani. She seems to have died sometime before the thirtieth year of Kulottunga. Thiyagavalli took the place of the chief queen upon Dinachintamani&#x27;s demise. The poem Kalingattupparani mentions Thiyagavalli together with Elisai Vallabhi (also known as Elulagudayal). It also states that Thiyagavalli enjoyed equal authority with the king. Another queen, called Solakulavalliyār, is also mentioned in inscriptions. She was instrumental in renewing the grant of Anaimangalam in favour of the Buddhist Chulamani Vihara at Nagapattinam. He also seems to have married a Pallava princess called Kadavan-Mahadevi. Epigraphs mention three of his sons, Rajaraja Chodaganga, Vira Chola and Vikrama Chola, of which Rajaraja was the eldest. A younger sister of the king is known to us from a very old inscription in the Nataraja temple at Chidambaram. The inscription gives the king three names, namely Kulottunga, Jayadhara and Rajendra. The epigraph states that Rajarajan-Kundavai-Alvar, the younger sister of Kulottunga gilded the Nataraja shrine and gifted a gold vessel, a mirror and made arrangements for the ablutions of the deity (&quot;Abishekam&quot;). It further states that the king of Kamboja exhibited a stone before the glorious Chola king and by the king&#x27;s order the stone was placed in front of the main deity of the Nataraja temple. A daughter of Kulottunga I called Ammangai-Alvar and as Periya Nachiyar is known to us from an inscription of Kulottunga Chola III (referred to in the inscription as Virarajendradeva).

==Religious attitude==
The empire under Kulottunga encouraged both Saivism and Vaishnavism. The king and his family members continued to make endowments to the Nataraja Temple in Chidambaram. He was tolerant towards other religions, like Buddhism, and renewed the grants made to the Chudamani Vihara, the Buddhist monastery at Nagapattinam.

Historians dispute the identification of Krimikanta Chola, the persecutor of Vaishnavite acharya Ramanuja, with Kulottunga. One of the reasons for this disagreement is because, Ramanuja is said to have returned to the Chola kingdom from Hoysala Vishnuvardhana&#x27;s court after an exile of 12 years (upon the Chola king&#x27;s death), whereas Kulottunga ruled for 52 years. Some scholars are of the opinion that Kulottunga was secular through his early and middle years and persecuted Vaishnavites towards the end of his reign, succumbing to Saivite pressure. There is reason to believe that the king encouraged Vaishnavism during the later years as his records mention him giving gifts to the Vishnu shrines. For example, he visited the Ulagalandaperumal temple in Kanchipuram with his two queens, Tribuhavanamudaiyal and Solakulavalli, and made benefactions in the 40th year of his reign.
== Art and architecture ==
Kulottunga was a patron of arts and architecture. The poet-laureate Jayamkondar is said to have adorned his court. The composition of the famous poem Kalingattuparani is attributed to him. Some scholars consider the poet Kambar to be a contemporary of Kulottunga I and the Ramavataram is said to have been composed during his rule. Others place him during the reign of Kulottunga II or III. Likewise a few believe that Ottakoothar, the author of the three &quot;Ulas&quot; namely the Kulothunga Cholan Ula, Vikraman Chola Ula and Rajaraja Cholan Ula, lived during his reign while others place him during the reign of his successors viz. Vikrama Chola, Kulottunga II and Rajaraja II.
Kulothunga I and his son expanded the Chidambaram Nataraja Temple expanse sixfold.

The construction of the Amritaghateswarar Shiva temple in Melakadambur was also attributed to the reign of Kulothunga. It is called as Karakkoil, and is perhaps the earliest shrine built in the shape of a chariot with wheels, and drawn by spirited horses. The temple contains an inscription of the king, dated in the 43rd year of his reign, corresponding to 1113. During his time, Kulottunga Chozhapuram, now called Thungapuram, was a site of intense religious activity. The streets in the city are laid out like Madurai (square shape), hence it is called as Siru (small) Madurai. Kulottunga constructed two temples in Siru Madurai, one called Sokkanathar temple for Lord Siva, and the other, a Vishnu shrine called Lord Vinava Perumal Temple or Varadaraja perumal temple.

Kulottunga was also on friendly terms with the Gahadavala kings of central India, who had Lord Surya for their tutelary deity. Later, inspired by his visits to the Gahadavala kingdom, Kulottunga built several temples dedicated to the Sun God, especially the Suryanar temples at Pudukkottai and Nagapattinam.

== Inscriptions ==

Kulottunga&#x27;s inscriptions mostly begin with the introduction &quot;pugal madu vilanga&quot; or &quot;pugal sunda punari&quot;. The former gives details about his conquest over Cheras, Pandyas and Vikramaditya VI while the latter is even more detailed and includes the details of his early life, viz., his heroics in Chakrakotta and Vayiragram and how he came about to wear the excellent crown of jewels of the Chola country. An inscription from Kanchi beginning with the introduction &quot;Pugal madu&quot; mentions his birth star as Pushya. Another inscription of the king, from the Tripurantakesvara temple in Chingleput district, mentions the resale of some lands that were bought in the second year of Virarajendra Chola.

In his early years, the king styled himself as Rajakesarivarman alias Rajendracholadeva. We have an inscription of the king from Kolar dated in the second year of his reign. He is called Rajakesarivarman alias Rajendra Chola deva and it mentions his heroics in Sakkarakottam and Vayiragaram. It states that an officer of the king called Virasikhamani Muvendavelar inspected a temple in Kuvalala nadu, a district of Vijayarajendra-mandalam and appointed a committee. There is another inscription from the Brahmapurisvara Temple in Tiruvottiyur, dated in the third year of his reign, wherein he is styled as Rajakesarivarman alias &quot;Rajendracholadeva&quot;. It states that Muvendavelar, an officer of the king, and a native of Aridayamangalam in Mudichonadu, a sub-division of &quot;Kalyanapuramkonda-sola-valanadu&quot;, bought some lands and donated them for feeding a Brahmana and a Sivayogin. The names Vijayarajendra-mandalam and Kalyanapuramgonda-sola-valanadu are significant and evidently named after Kulottunga&#x27;s predecessor, Rajadhiraja Chola I, who sacked the Western Chalukya capital Kalyanapuram towards the end of his reign. Rajadhiraja Chola I then assumed the title &quot;Vijayarajendra&quot; after performing the &quot;Virabhiseka&quot; (anointment of heroes).

<text>France Anne-Dominic Córdova (born August 5, 1947) is an American astrophysicist and administrator who was the fourteenth director of the National Science Foundation. Previously, she was the eleventh President of Purdue University from 2007 to 2012. She now serves as President of the Science Philanthropy Alliance.

==Early years== 
Córdova was born in Paris, France, the eldest of twelve children. Her mother was Irish-American and her father was a Mexican-American West Point graduate and businessman. She attended high school at Bishop Amat High School in La Puente, California, east of Los Angeles and went on to Stanford University, where she graduated &quot;cum laude&quot; with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in English and conducted anthropological field work in a Zapotec Indian pueblo in Oaxaca, Mexico. She earned a PhD in Physics from the California Institute of Technology in 1979.

==Career==
Córdova worked at the Space Astronomy and Astrophysics Group at the Los Alamos National Laboratory from 1979 to 1989, where she also served as Deputy Group Leader. She headed the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics at Pennsylvania State University from 1989 to 1993. In 1993, Córdova became a NASA Chief Scientist.

Córdova then went to the University of California, Santa Barbara where she was Vice-Chancellor for Research and a Professor of Physics. In 2002 she was appointed Chancellor of the University of California, Riverside, where she was also a Distinguished Professor of Physics and Astronomy. Córdova led the initial steps toward establishing the UC Riverside School of Medicine.

Córdova became the eleventh president of Purdue University in 2007 and promoted student success and the commercialization of interdisciplinary research. Her administration oversaw the establishment of Purdue&#x27;s College of Health and Human Sciences and its Global Policy Research Institute. At the end of her term, Purdue&#x27;s trustees credited her with leading the school to record levels of research funding, reputational rankings, and student retention rates.

Córdova&#x27;s scientific career contributions have been in the areas of observational and experimental astrophysics, multi-spectral research on x-ray and gamma ray sources, and space-borne instrumentation. She has published more than 150 scientific papers, most recently in 2007. In September 2007, she was appointed to the board of directors of BioCrossroads, Indiana&#x27;s initiative to grow the life sciences through a public-private collaboration that supports the region&#x27;s research and corporate strengths while encouraging new business development.

American president Barack Obama appointed Córdova to the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution in 2009, and she served until 2014. She was chair of the Board of Regents from 2012 to 2014.

In 2014, Córdova was nominated by Obama and confirmed by the United States Senate as the 14th head of the National Science Foundation.

After her retirement from NSF, Córdova was elected to the Caltech Board of Trustees in June 2020. In May 2021, she was also named as President of the Science Philanthropy Alliance.

==Personal life==
Córdova is married to science educator Christian J. Foster, with whom she has two children, Anne-Catherine and Stephen. One of her hobbies is rock climbing, a hobby where she met her husband. In a Physics Today article she talks about how she turned down an offer from her advisor to be nominated as an astronaut, preferring instead to focus on research. In an interview with the American Institute of Physics, she describes her career decisions and life path in greater detail. She said that being a physicist influenced her leadership style, that she is optimistic about the future and that one never knows when they will use the knowledge they learn.

==Honors and awards==
In 1996, she received NASA&#x27;s highest honor, the NASA Distinguished Service Medal. She was recognized as a 2000 Kilby Laureate, for &quot;contributions to society through science, technology, innovation, invention, and education.&quot; She was named one of the 80 Elite Hispanic Women by &quot;Hispanic Business Magazine&quot; in 2002. In 2008, Córdova was nominated to the Stanford University Multicultural Alumni Hall of Fame by El Centro Chicano, Stanford&#x27;s Chicano and Latino organization. She was appointed by President George W. Bush to the National Science Board in 2008. In 2012, she received the Women in Space Science Award from the Adler Planetarium.

Purdue University&#x27;s France A. Córdova Recreational Sports Center was named for her in 2012. A 98-million-dollar renovation of the 55-year-old facility was approved during her presidency. The building was one of 10 recreation facilities to receive a Facility of Merit Award for 2014 from Athletic Business.

Córdova is a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), the Association for Women in Science (AWIS), and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and is a National Associate of the National Academies. She is an honorary member of the Royal Irish Academy. She has received numerous honorary doctorates, including from Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles (1997), Ben Gurion University of the Negev (2011), Purdue University (2012), Duke University (2015), the University of Connecticut (2016), Rochester Institute of Technology (2016), and Yale University (2023).

<text>The is a national expressway on the island of Honshū in Japan. It is operated by Central Nippon Expressway Company. The expressway is designated as E1 under the &quot;2016 Proposal for Realization of Expressway Numbering&quot;, because it parallels National Route 1. It is a part of the Asian Highway Network. 

==Naming==
The word Tōmei is an acronym consisting of two kanji characters. The first character refers to and the second refers to , which are the two major urban areas linked by the expressway.

Officially the expressway is designated as the First Tōkai Expressway. A second Tōkai Expressway (operating as the Shin-Tōmei Expressway) is under construction parallel to the existing route, and is intended to alleviate congestion problems in the near term.

The expressway is also a part of Route AH1 of the Asian Highway Network.

== Overview ==
The Tōmei Expressway is an important roadway linking Tokyo and Nagoya. It is the most heavily travelled roadway operated by Central Nippon Expressway Company, with some sections used by more than 100,000 vehicles a day.

The first sections were opened to traffic in 1968 and the entire route was completed in 1969.

From the origin in western Tokyo the expressway follows a westerly route through Kanagawa Prefecture, paralleling National Route 246 and passing to the north of Yokohama. The route continues west into Shizuoka Prefecture, passing to the south of Mount Fuji and along the coastline of Suruga Bay, paralleling National Route 1 and the historic Tōkaidō highway before reaching the city of Shizuoka. The expressway continues west, passing Lake Hamana in western Shizuoka Prefecture, and crosses into Aichi Prefecture. The expressway then heads northwest, passing to the east of the city of Nagoya and meeting the terminus of the Chūō Expressway before terminating at an interchange in the city of Komaki to the north of Nagoya. Although the Tōmei Expressway ends at this point, the roadway continues as the Meishin Expressway towards Kyoto, Osaka, and Kobe.

== List of interchanges and features ==
* IC - interchange, SIC - smart interchange, JCT - junction, SA - service area, PA - parking area, BS - bus stop, TN - tunnel, TB - toll gate, BR - bridge

* Sections with left and right routes formerly carried 2 lanes of traffic in each direction. An additional roadway (carrying 3 lanes of traffic in one direction only) has been constructed parallel to the existing 4 lanes to alleviate congestion. The original 4 lanes are then converted for the use of traffic in the opposite direction.

<text>Electrical energy is the energy transferred as electric charges move between points with different electric potential, that is, as they move across a potential difference. As electric potential is lost or gained, work is done changing the energy of some system. The amount of work in joules is given by the product of the charge that has moved, in coulombs, and the potential difference that has been crossed, in volts.

Electrical energy is usually sold by the kilowatt hour (1 kW·h = 3.6 MJ) which is the product of the power in kilowatts multiplied by running time in hours. Electric utilities measure energy using an electricity meter, which keeps a running total of the electrical energy delivered to a customer.

Electric heating is an example of converting electrical energy into thermal energy. The simplest and most common type of electric heater uses electrical resistance to convert the energy. There are other ways to use electrical energy. Electric charges moves as a current the heater element which has a potential difference between the ends: energy is transferred from the charges to the element, increasing the element&#x27;s temperature and thermal energy as the charges lose potential energy.

== Electricity generation ==

Electricity generation is the process of generating electrical energy from other forms of energy.

The fundamental principle of electricity generation was discovered during the 1820s and early 1830s by the British scientist Michael Faraday. His basic method is still used today: electric current is generated by the movement of a loop of wire, or disc of copper between the poles of a magnet.

For electrical utilities, it is the first step in the delivery of electricity to consumers. The other processes, electricity transmission, distribution, and electrical energy storage and recovery using pumped-storage methods are normally carried out by the electric power industry.

Electricity is most often generated at a power station by electromechanical generators, primarily driven by heat engines fueled by chemical combustion or nuclear fission but also by other means such as the kinetic energy of flowing water and wind. There are many other technologies that can be and are used to generate electricity such as solar photovoltaics and geothermal power.

<text>Dennis McDougal (born November 25, 1947) is an American author and newspaper journalist. He has been called &quot;L.A.&#x27;s No. 1 muckraker.&quot; His book, &quot;Privileged Son&quot;, was described as &quot;illuminating reading for anyone interested in 20th-century Los Angeles or modern-day newspapering&quot; by &quot;The New York Times&quot;. A native of Southern California, he lives near Memphis, Tennessee.

== Early life and education ==

McDougal is originally from Pasadena, California. After attending public school in the Los Angeles suburb of Lynwood, he received a bachelor of arts degree in English from University of California, Los Angeles, where he later earned a master&#x27;s degree in journalism.

== Military service ==

From 1967 to 1969, McDougal was on active duty with the Naval Reserves. He served aboard the U.S.S. Annapolis in the South China Sea. In an interview with blogger Luke Ford, McDougal recalls his experience, much of which formed the basis for his first fiction novel &quot;The Candlestickmaker&quot;, published in 2011:

== Career ==

Before turning his attention full-time to writing books in 1993, McDougal reported on the glitzy and occasionally corrupt aspects of Hollywood as a staff writer for ten years at the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, while previously working as a staff writer for &quot;The Riverside Press-Enterprise&quot; (1973–77) and &quot;The Long Beach Press-Telegram&quot; (1977–1981). From 2002 to 2006, he worked as a contributor for &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

In 2007, the controversy surrounding his book &quot;Privileged Son: Otis Chandler And The Rise And Fall Of The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; Dynasty&quot;—the newspaper McDougal once worked for—was discussed in an interview with McDougal on NPR&#x27;s &quot;Morning Edition&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; in a review called McDougal&#x27;s book &quot;illuminating reading for anyone interested in 20th-century Los Angeles or modern-day newspapering.&quot;

Between books, McDougal was a producer for CNN during the O.J. Simpson trial, where he was responsible for tracking down witnesses, relatives, and acquaintances for interviews as well as documents and public records for use on camera as the trial unfolded.

A longtime contributor to &quot;TV Guide&quot;, McDougal&#x27;s last piece covered the murderous saga of actor Robert Blake and Bonny Lee Bakley.

In 2014, Turner Publishing Co. released McDougal&#x27;s biography of Bob Dylan, &quot;Dylan: The Biography&quot;. &quot;Perfect Sound Forever&quot; magazine wrote that &quot;McDougal answers many questions about Dylan&#x27;s life and times and provides insight about it.

=== Awards ===

In 1982, McDougal was awarded a John S. Knight Fellowship at Stanford University and spent a year teaching and studying in Japan and Canada, as well as at the Palo Alto campus.

He has earned more than 50 honors, including a 1984 National Headliner Award and several Associated Press awards.

=== Books ===

<text>Faa Sāmoa, the &#x27;Samoan Way&#x27;, is the traditional/customary way of life in Samoan culture.

==Concept==

&quot;Faa Sāmoa&quot; consists of the Samoan language, customs of relationships, and culture, that constitute the traditional and continuing Polynesian lifestyle on Samoa and in the Samoan diaspora. It embraces an all-encompassing system of behavior and of responsibilities that spells out all Samoans&#x27; relationships to one another and to persons holding positions of authority. This is how Samoans are raised and live, and provides support and direction to individuals within family and political structures. Central to the organisation of Samoan society is the culture&#x27;s &quot;faamatai&quot;, the traditional system of social organisation.
Hosts have responsibility for the actions of their guests, and may incur a fine from the village authorities for infractions of local customs.

&quot;Faa Sāmoa&quot; includes the way one stands, walks and speaks, for example by saying &quot;tulou&quot; when one walks in front of someone who is seated. Likewise, it is extremely disrespectful to eat or drink when walking through a village.

As another example, most Samoan villages enforce a period of prayer in the early evening, signified by ringing a bell or by blowing a conch shell. During this brief curfew (the &quot;sa&quot;) one should not stop in the village if passing through. Appointed guardians, or &quot;aumaga&quot;, may stand by the road to ensure that travelers do not enter.

In addition to the set familial relationships, which extend to one&#x27;s entire extended family (the &quot;‘aiga&quot;) with its familial chief (the &quot;matai&quot;), Samoans show respect to persons in positions of authority, and reverently observe customs of long standing which have rather more force than mere etiquette.

==History==

When missionaries arrived from Europe in 1830, they found ways to associate Samoan cultural beliefs with Christianity, which contributed to the spread of Christianity in 19th-century Samoa. An example of these purportedly shared beliefs is the respect of one&#x27;s elders. In &quot;faa Sāmoa&quot;, the young respect older generations, especially their parents and grandparents.

<text>In the Red is a 1989 black comedy-crime novel by Mark Tavener, featuring fictional BBC Reporter George Cragge and fictional Police Officer Frank Jefferson, investigating a series of murders of London bank managers, a small political party contesting a by-election, and a plan to overthrow the Director-General of the BBC.

The novel&#x27;s setting in the worlds of finance (from which it draws ), politics and media, was inspired by the writer&#x27;s early experiences working for the BBC and the Liberal Party.

The novel was released (BBC Books, 1998) following the production of a television adaptation of the same name (BBC Two, 1998).

==Adaptations==
The seven-part radio adaptation of the same name (BBC Radio Four, 1995) by Tavener and Peter Baynham, starring Michael Williams and Barry Foster in the lead roles, was followed by three six-part sequels (BBC Radio Four, 1997–1999).

The three-part television adaptation of the same name (BBC Two, 1998) by Malcolm Bradbury stars Warren Clarke and Alun Armstrong in the lead roles.

The characters of Charles Prentis and Martin McCabe introduced in the novel were featured in their own spin-off series &quot;Absolute Power&quot; (BBC Radio 4, 2000-2006/BBC Two, 2003–2005), which was also created and written by Tavener.

<doc id="1343611" wikidata="Q367197" url="?curid=1343611" title="John Cudahy">
<text>John Clarence Cudahy ( ); December 10, 1887 – September 6, 1943) was an American real estate developer and diplomat. In the years leading up to World War II, Cudahy served as United States ambassador to Poland and Belgium, and as United States minister to Luxembourg and the Irish Free State.

==Early life==
Cudahy was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the son of Anna (Madden) and Patrick Cudahy, a meat packing industrialist. He graduated from Harvard University in 1910 and from the University of Wisconsin Law School in 1913.

Cudahy served during World War I as a lieutenant in Company B of the U.S. Army&#x27;s 339th Infantry Regiment. This regiment was part of the Polar Bear Expedition, which was sent to north Russia to intervene on behalf of the anti-communist forces in the Russian Civil War. On November 14, 1918, Cudahy led a counter-attack that succeeded in breaking through and routing the 1,000 Bolshevik troops that on November 11 (Armistice Day) had encircled and attacked the 600 American, Canadian, and Royal Scots soldiers who were holding the village of Tulgas on the Northern Dvina. However, his eventual disillusionment with the campaign in north Russia led him to write (under a pseudonym) the book &quot;Archangel: The American War with Russia&quot;.

Back in the United States, Cudahy headed his family&#x27;s real estate company, building the Cudahy Tower Apartments on the shore of Lake Michigan in Milwaukee.

==Diplomatic service==
Between 1933 and 1940, Cudahy served the United States as minister to several European nations.

From September 6, 1933, until April 23, 1937, Cudahy served as the American ambassador to Poland. His time in Poland was marked by a militarily backed government under Józef Piłsudski and continued tensions between Poland and Nazi Germany under Adolf Hitler.

From August 23, 1937, Cudahy served as minister to the Irish Free State, which became the Republic of Ireland in December 1937. His official title was Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary, and he served until January 15, 1940.

In January 1940, Cudahy became both the ambassador to Belgium and the minister to Luxembourg. He was forced to leave these posts after Germany occupied Luxembourg and Belgium in May 1940, and the nations set up governments-in-exile. A close friend of King Leopold III, he publicly denounced Britain, France and the U.S. for a failure to plan an adequate defense. He became an embarrassment to Washington, which was officially neutral.

In 1941, &quot;Life&quot; magazine commissioned Cudahy to interview Hitler, which he did at Berghof. Cudahy later authored the book &quot;The Armies March&quot;, recounting his experiences in Europe leading up to the war, including the Battle of Belgium and his meeting with Hitler.

==Death and descendants==
Cudahy died in September 1943, when he was thrown from a horse on his Brown Deer estate north of Milwaukee. Cudahy&#x27;s son, Michael Cudahy, founded Marquette Electronics and became a major philanthropist in the city of Milwaukee. Cudahy&#x27;s daughter, Mary Keogh-Stringer (born Mary Toulgas Cudahy), was a successful artist; the dedication of &quot;The Armies March&quot; reads;

<text>La Julia Rhea (March 16, 1898 – July 5, 1992) was an American operatic soprano.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Rhea was born and raised in Louisville, Kentucky and began singing publicly at the Hill Street Baptist Church of that city, where she was a member of the children&#x27;s choir. In 1925, she went to Chicago and became a member of the R. Nathaniel Dett Club of Music and Allied Arts and attended and graduated from Chicago Musical College. Her professional debut was at Chicago&#x27;s Kimball Hall in 1929, and she continued to make regular concert performances across the United States as she studied operatic roles in a period that lasted more than two decades.

===Notable appearances===
After a performance of &quot;O Don Fatale&quot; from Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Don Carlos&quot; for the Dett Club Scholarship Fund at Pittsburgh&#x27;s Grace Presbyterian Church in 1927 , the columnist Sylvester Russell had this to say, &quot;As a vocalist... Madam Rhea is a genuine contralto of wonderful range and power, hardly excelled in richness and as the star of the occasion she occupies a place among the greatest human voices produced.&quot; In the early 1930s, Rhea toured the country with Ethel Waters in the stage production of &quot;Rhapsody in Black&quot;, and was for a time the feature soloist of the Cecil Mack Choir.

At a time when black performers found it difficult to appeal to a wider audience, Rhea was presented by her teacher Romano Romani to the executive staff of the Metropolitan Opera where in 1934, she became the &quot;first person of her race to be granted an audition at the famous opera house.&quot; Although she was &quot;highly praised for her artistic presentation,&quot; the Met would wait until 1955 when Marian Anderson would become its first black star.

After her performance on May 13, 1935 as the character Josephine in Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s H.M.S. Pinafore, Rhea won over 6,000 votes from the audience and became the first black winner of an audition of the Major Bowes Amateur Hour, and toured with the group under the name Rea Parada.

Her experience at the Met notwithstanding, Rhea became the first black performer to star in &quot;the title role of a major opera company&quot; when in Chicago on December 27, 1937 she appeared in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Aida&quot; with William Franklin as Amonasro in a performance of the Chicago Civic Opera Company. In attendance for the performance was the drama critic for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; Cecil Smith, who commented: &quot;A musical event without parallel in grand opera in America took place at the Civic Opera House last night when two colored singers, La Julia Rhea and William Franklin, sang the Ethiopian roles of Aida and Amonasro in a special performance of &quot;Aida&quot; ... Both singers won a goodly success and were warmly applauded.&quot; The costume Rhea wore for that performance was a gift from her teacher and mentor, the internationally renowned opera star Rosa Raisa, who had herself worn it at her debut performance of &quot;Aida&quot; in 1914. Both Rhea and Franklin appeared in productions of the National Negro Opera Company (NNOC), as well as in operettas by Gilbert and Sullivan. The production of &quot;Aida&quot; in which Rhea made the inaugural performance of the National Negro Opera Company in 1941, was organized by the NNOC Guild as part of Pittsburgh&#x27;s National Association of Negro Musicians annual meeting. Mary Cardwell Dawson was the one who organized the event.

In 1942, she appeared with Chicago Mayor Edward J. Kelly, Olivia de Havilland, Marian Anderson, Oscar G. Mayer, Sr. and other presenters at the International Amphitheatre in Chicago to sell bonds during World War II under the auspices of the Chicago Musical War Rally.

===Later life===
After she no longer gave public performances, Rhea continued her involvement in the world of opera by giving private lessons to young opera hopefuls at her home in Blue Island, Illinois where she was known for her annual lawn parties that were attended by musicians from across the country. She also appeared from time to time over the public airwaves.

<text>Don&#x27;t Move () is a 2004 Italian film directed by Sergio Castellitto. It stars Penélope Cruz, Claudia Gerini, Angela Finocchiaro and the director himself. Both Castellitto and Cruz received critical praise for their performances, as well as several awards, including the prestigious David di Donatello. It was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival.

== Plot ==
Timoteo, a surgeon, gets the shocking news that his fifteen-year-old daughter Angela has been seriously injured in a motorcycle accident. As she is operated upon, Timoteo looks out of a window to see (or imagines seeing) a woman, her back facing him, proceeding to sit down on a chair in the rain outside. He notices her prominent red heels and turns away in disbelief, indicating he was familiar with them. His subsequent reminiscences about an old affair comprise the remainder of the film.

A subsequent scene shows Timoteo sitting in a bar in an unfamiliar location on a hot day. Italia, a woman of Albanian origin working at the bar and wearing red heels, offers to let him make a seemingly important call from her home. The inebriated Timoteo, having entered her flat, rapes Italia and subsequently pretends to fall in love with her. He learns from her, among other things, she was sexually abused in her childhood by a dress salesman (who is later revealed to be her father). He decides to leave his wife Elsa and conveys this to Italia but, just as he is about to come clean, he discovers that Elsa is pregnant. Meanwhile, Italia also becomes pregnant with his child. Timoteo, now in a real dilemma, cannot gather the courage to confront Elsa in her condition. Italia, unaware of this, interprets Timoteo&#x27;s hesitation as a lack of commitment on his part and is heartbroken by this perceived betrayal. Later, Timoteo encounters a seemingly unstable Italia dancing frenziedly outside her house. On his chiding her, Italia tells him agitatedly that she has had their child aborted at a nearby gypsy&#x27;s, adding bitterly it was for the best as she would not have made a good mother anyway. Greatly disturbed by this development, Timoteo leaves and goes home to his pregnant wife.

Some months later, Timoteo, shopping with his wife who is about to deliver, spots Italia in a crowd and rushes after her in the rain. After catching up with her, he profusely apologises to Italia, asking her forgiveness for all the pain he caused. After reacting violently initially, Italia tells him that she knew now why he could not leave his wife and that she understood. He also learns from her that she would be moving to another town shortly.

Next morning, Timoteo offers to drive Italia down to her new town. During the journey, his feelings for Italia grow stronger and he confesses his desire to marry and settle down with her in the new town. While having dinner, Timoteo marries himself off to Italia and refers to her as &quot;my wife&quot; while speaking to a waitress. That night, he is woken by Italia&#x27;s screams as she is gripped by unbearable pain in her abdomen. She is rushed to the local hospital, where an ultrasound reveals her belly to be full of blood, indicating a botched abortion. A desperate Timoteo then proceeds to operate on Italia. She dies soon after briefly regaining consciousness.

His recollections are interrupted by a nurse who informs him that his daughter&#x27;s condition has stabilised. He then visits her with his wife. The lady who was shown in the beginning, sitting with her back towards Timoteo is reflected in her hand mirror. She appears to be smiling and has resemblance to Italia.

In the final act, a relieved Timoteo takes out Italia&#x27;s red shoe, which she had lost on the way to the hospital the day she died, and that the funeral company had refused to put in the closed coffin, and which he had carefully preserved, and kisses it as a gesture of thanks. He takes the single shoe out of his locker room and places it on the exact spot where he had imagined seeing the woman resembling Italia, as if he is returning Italia&#x27;s shoes to her.

<text>William Franklin (born 1906, date of death unknown) was a baritone opera singer who was considered to be a pioneering African American in the Chicago music scene. He has been described as the best baritone of his day, with some performances that &quot;will long be remembered for [their] intensity of musical feeling.&quot; He was known for his leading roles in a revival of George Gershwin&#x27;s Porgy and Bess in 1944, and in Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;The Mikado.&quot;

== Biography ==
Franklin was born in a farm near Shaw, Tennessee, and raised in Chicago, Illinois. He went to the Wendell Phillips High School, where he was trained by Mildred Bryant-Jones, and played in various bands. He took up trombone and singing in jazz groups after completing high school. From 1925 to 1935, Franklin played with some of the great jazz names of the time, such as Clarence Jones, Dave Peyton, Stanley &quot;Fess&quot; Williams and Earl &quot;Fatha&quot; Hines.

After a traffic accident, he focused on singing and enrolled at the Chicago Conservatory of Music. He made his operatic debut as Amonastro in a 1937 production of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Aida&quot; at the Chicago Civic Opera, with La Julia Rhea. This role paved the way for many other opera and musical appearances. He often played with Mary Caldwell Dawson&#x27;s National Negro Opera Company, and in the operetta performances of Gilbert and Sullivan works.

<doc id="1343651" wikidata="Q12061524" url="?curid=1343651" title="Maylands, South Australia">
<text>Maylands is a suburb of Adelaide located within the City of Norwood Payneham St Peters, and bounded by the main roads Portrush Road and Magill Road.

== History ==
Maylands was named by William Wadham (who married Jane Cooper circa 1852 in Adelaide) and Luke M Cullen, early settlers who sold the land that made up the original town in 1876. There is a Mayland in the English county of Essex from whence the Cooper family emigrated.

Maylands consists of mostly medium density residential properties, predominantly in an east–west elevation with most streets in the suburb oriented north–south. Many of its houses having been built in the late 19th century and early 20th century, there are South Australian examples of colonial, Federation and some art deco architecture. Unlike Stepney, to Maylands&#x27; west, the dwellings are usually larger with some remaining homes attached to small market gardens. There are few &quot;workers cottages&quot;, but most are found in the north-western section of the suburb.

Some heritage preservation has occurred in the suburb. The then Metropolitan Tramways Trust (or MTT) was converted into a set of unit accommodation by the South Australian Housing Trust. The suburb is also known for the antique stores along Magill Road.

== Landmarks ==
One of the most notable landmarks includes the &quot;Maylands Hotel&quot;, which is located opposite &quot;Cruickshank Reserve&quot; on the south eastern corner of the Phillis and Clifton Streets intersection. The hotel remains whereas the Tip-Top Bakery site on the south-western corner of the same intersection was demolished and replaced by townhouses.

The &quot;Maylands Hotel&quot; has become a popular eatery, with it arguably being off the beaten track and hidden in leafy suburbia. Up until the 1990s, the hotel had a beer garden. With the introduction of poker machines into South Australia, this beer garden was replaced by an extended dining area and poker machine area.

== Politics ==
Maylands is represented in the Dunstan electorate in the Parliament of South Australia, and within the Division of Sturt in the Australian House of Representatives.

<doc id="1343660" wikidata="Q2620299" url="?curid=1343660" title="Independence Hall (Israel)">
<text>Independence Hall, originally the Dizengoff House () is the site of the signing of Israel&#x27;s Declaration of Independence. It is located on the historic Rothschild Boulevard in Tel Aviv, Israel.

It was originally built as the home of Meir Dizengoff and his wife, Zina. Dizengoff later entrusted architect Carl Rubin to redesign the building in the international style. He gifted the building to the Tel Aviv-Yafo Municipality and it housed Tel Aviv Museum of Art from 1932 to 1971. It is currently a museum dedicated to the signing of the Israeli Declaration of Independence and the history of Tel Aviv.

==History==
===Dizengoff===
At the vicinity of where Independence Hall now stands, sixty-six families gathered on April 11, 1909, to conduct a lottery for plots of land in a new Jewish neighborhood, to be known as Ahuzat Bayit. Meir and Zina Dizengoff acquired plot number 43, on which they built their home. It was originally a simple and symmetrical house, built of kurkar stone.

Meir Dizengoff served as the head of the new neighborhood council. In 1910, at a general meeting, the residents of Ahuzat Bayit, inspired by Theodor Herzl&#x27;s &quot;Altneuland&quot; (English: Old-New Land), unanimously decided to rename their neighborhood Tel Aviv. As the neighborhood grew and became a city, Dizengoff became its first mayor. Zina was a socialite and hosted European-style salon gatherings at the home. 

Dizengoff made several renovations to the property, including the addition of a rear wing where the declaration of independence took place. Dizengoff hired the architect, Carl Rubin, who redesigned the building in the international style. 

===Tel Aviv Museum of Art===

In 1930, after the death of his wife, Dizengoff donated his house to his beloved city of Tel Aviv and requested that it be turned into a museum. The house underwent extensive renovations and became the Tel Aviv Museum of Art in 1932. In 1933, the museum hired the art historian, Dr. Karl Schwarz to head the burgeoning museum. Schwarz immigrated to Mandatory Palestine to take up the position, leaving behind his role as head of Berlin&#x27;s first Jewish museum. At the time of his appointment he wrote a guest column for &quot;Haaretz&quot; newspaper, setting out his vision for the museum: &quot;A nurturing institution, from which education will emerge, reflecting the artistic development in other countries; where one can study the works of the country&#x27;s great artists; [and] which fosters and provides for artists living and working in the country — a place where new ideas are given impetus. That is what the Tel Aviv Museum should be.” He stayed on with the museum until 1947, enhancing the art collection, preparing exhibitions and creating a library for the history of art and cinema.The museum moved to its current location at 27 Shaul Hamelech Blvd, in 1971. The larger, purpose-built building was more appropriate and allowed the museum to expand.

=== Independence declaration===

In the main hall of the building, at 4 PM on May 14, 1948 (5 Iyar 5708), in the presence of the members of the Vaad Leumi (Jewish National Council) and the leaders of the Yishuv, David Ben-Gurion proclaimed the establishment of the State of Israel, eight hours before the British Mandate of Palestine was due to end.
After Ben-Gurion read the Declaration of Independence, Rabbi Fischman (Maimon) recited the Shehecheyanu blessing, and the Declaration was signed. The ceremony concluded with the singing of Hatikvah, now Israel&#x27;s national anthem. 

In the 24 hours prior to the ceremony, considerable efforts were made to prepare the hall. A $200 budget was allocated for the decor and decorations, and Israeli flags were loaned from the Jewish National Fund. Seating for the audiences was also provided by nearby cafes. A small stage was also constructed, made from timber purchases at a thrift store. A portrait of Theodor Herzl was also hung in a central position above the stage. Art works portraying nudity were covered, carpets were laid on the floors and windows were darkened over fears of an air raid. The invited guests were sworn to secrecy and the art museum was closed to the public during these preparations. In spite of the pact of secrecy, a crowd formed outside the building at noon on the day of the ceremony. The declaration and celebrations were photographed by Rudi Weissenstein.

===Recent history===
By the 1970s, the building was in a neglected physical state, crumbling and with mice problems. In 1978, the hall was restored to resemble its appearance at the time of the declaration of independence and opened to the public. It has since been a museum dedicated to the signing of the declaration and the history of Tel Aviv-Yafo. The upper floors of the building have housed a Bible museum, featuring archaeological artifacts and works of art with biblical themes.

However, as the surrounding Rothschild Boulevard underwent a revival, and neighboring properties were restored, the hall appeared shabby and rundown in the 1990s and 2000s. In 2009, the &quot;Independence House Law&quot; was enacted to &quot;restore and preserve the building [...] as it is of national and historical importance in the history of the people and the state.&quot; Urgent renovations on the building were undertaken by architect Uri Glazer in 2012. During these works, a ceramic relief by German-born Israeli artist, Chava Samuel was discovered behind a board. 

In 2013, it was revealed that the building was earmarked for a major renovation project in the coming years, creating an &quot;innovative museum&quot; in the space. The building is currently closed to the public as it undergoes these extensive renovations. Glazer and Gal &amp; Matsliah Architects won a design competition to restore the building and are being assisted by the engineer, Moshe Kazes.

<text>Frederick Luther Fane, (27 April 1875 – 27 November 1960) played cricket for the England cricket team in 14 Test matches. He also played for Essex, Oxford University and London County.

Fane was born at Curragh Camp in County Kildare, Ireland, where his father Frederick John Fane, an officer in the British Army, was stationed with the 61st (South Gloucestershire) Regiment of Foot. He was a great-grandson of John Fane, a politician, of the family of the Earls of Westmorland. He was educated at Charterhouse School and Magdalen College, Oxford.

Fane captained the England cricket team on five occasions: three times when he took over from the injured Arthur Jones, and twice when he took over from H. D. G. Leveson Gower. He won two and lost three of these games.

He was the first Irish-born player to score a century in a Test match for England and remained the only one for over a hundred years, until Eoin Morgan repeated the feat against Pakistan at Trent Bridge in July 2010.

During the First World War Fane was commissioned in the West Yorkshire Regiment. He was awarded the Military Cross in 1917 &quot;for conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty while commanding a patrol. Having obtained valuable information, he withdrew his men from a difficult position under heavy machine gun fire. He displayed the greatest coolness and determination.&quot;

<doc id="1343665" wikidata="Q1497328" url="?curid=1343665" title="Sign singing">
<text>Sign singing or Karaoke signing is singing using sign language. Typically a song is played, and the performer expressively performs a sign language version of the lyrics. Whereas vocal singing uses pitch and tone to convey expressions, sign singing relies on the performer&#x27;s hands, body, and facial expressions.

Choirs can perform sign singing and have gathered popularity in recent years as accessibility for the Deaf community and interest in signing languages have risen. Competitions in which sign choirs can compete include the National Signing Choir Competition in the UK.

Well-known sign singers include the Japanese Tomoko Nakayama, a follower of Nichiren Buddhism, and the bawdy Australian duo Dislabelled. In London in 2003, a series of &quot;Deaf Idol&quot; events were held where deaf participants competed in karaoke singing, dance etc., in a similar format to the TV show Pop Idol.
Sign language can be used to express extremely nuanced feeling, and so sign singing is an important creative input for the deaf.

Sign singing is featured in the movie &quot;Napoleon Dynamite&quot; during a scene when two members of the &quot;happy hands club&quot; perform a song titled &quot;The Rose&quot; written by Bette Midler, entirely in sign. The signing club depicted in the film was largely inspired by a sign singing club that was previously established at Preston High School (Idaho), where the movie was filmed. The film brought wider attention to the club, originally called the &quot;Good hands club,&quot; which was founded by educator Dan Robertson, who conceived the idea for the group while studying ASL at Brigham Young University. In 2013 the troupe performed on stages at Disneyland, in the Tabernacle in Salt Lake City with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, and flew to Orlando for the convention of a large corporation.

A sign language interpretation by the late Kimberly Rae Schaefer during Pearl Jam&#x27;s 2000 tour for &quot;Given to Fly&quot; garnered public attention for the passionate and emotional signing.

The national anthem was sung and signed in British Sign Language at the Opening Ceremony of the 2012 Olympics
by The Kaos Signing Choir for Deaf and Hearing Children. 

The 2015 Broadway musical theater production of &quot;Spring Awakening&quot; integrated American sign language within the choreography of dance moves, while also utilizing a mixture of hearing and deaf performers.

<doc id="1343681" wikidata="Q1953538" url="?curid=1343681" title="Elections in Afghanistan">
<text>Though Afghanistan has had democratic elections throughout the 20th century, the electoral institutions have varied as changes in the political regime have disrupted political continuity. Elections were last held under the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, which was deposed by the Taliban in August 2021. The Taliban dissolved the Elections Commission in December 2021. In May 2022, when asked if the Taliban would hold elections, First Deputy Leader Sirajuddin Haqqani said the question was &quot;premature&quot;. All political parties have been banned since August 2023.

==Kingdom of Afghanistan==
===1949===
In 1949, Afghan Prime Minister Shah Mahmud Khan allowed relatively free national assembly elections, and the resulting seventh Afghan Parliament (1949–1951), which has become known as the &quot;Liberal Parliament&quot;, gave voice to criticism of the government and traditional institutions, allowed opposition political groups to come to life, and enacted some liberal reforms, including laws providing for a free press. This being the seventh parliament, six must have been elected from 1924 to around 1945.

===1952===
The Afghan parliamentary election in 1952 was considered a step backward from the one in 1949. It occurred in the wake of a government crackdown in 1951.

===1964===

In 1964, King Mohammed Zahir Shah ordered the convening of a Loya jirga - a national gathering that included the members of the National Assembly, the Senate, the Supreme Court, and both constitutional commissions - to draft and approve a new Afghan constitution. This was the first election where women participated, since women&#x27;s suffrage was introduced in Afghanistan in 1964.

167 members of the assembly were elected by the provinces, and 34 members were appointed directly by the king. Although most of the 452 people (including six women) assembled were predominantly officials who could be expected to support the royal line, the Loya Jirga of September 1964 also included members elected from the entire nation. While the government did screen out many potential dissidents, &quot;on the whole ... delegates to the Loya Jirgah appeared to represent the full range of social, political, and religious opinion.&quot;

===1965===

Most observers described the 1965 election as remarkably fair despite difficulties such as widespread illiteracy, low voter turnout, lack of political parties, and attempts by some government officials to influence the results. The 216-member Wolesi Jirga, the lower house of parliament, included representation by anti-royalists, supporters of the king, Pashtun nationalists, both the left and right of the political spectrum, entrepreneurs and industrialists, political liberals, a small leftist group, as well as conservative Muslim leaders who still opposed secularization. This was Afghanistan&#x27;s 12th parliament, so there must have been three more National Assembly elections in 1955–62.

===1969===
The 1969 parliamentary elections, with voter turnout not much higher than in 1965, produced a parliament that more or less reflected the distribution of power and population of rural Afghanistan - conservative landowners and businessmen predominated, and many more non-Pashtuns were elected than in the previous legislature. Most of the urban liberals and all female delegates lost their seats. Few leftists were in the new 13th parliament, although Babrak Karmal and Hafizullah Amin (a mathematics teacher educated in the United States) were elected from districts in and near the capital Kabul.

==Republic of Afghanistan (1973–1978)==


==Democratic Republic of Afghanistan (1978-1992)==

===1987===
In 1987, the Soviet-backed Afghan communist government introduced a law permitting the formation of other political parties, announced that it would be prepared to share power with representatives of opposition groups in the event of a coalition government, and issued a new constitution providing for a new bicameral National Assembly (Meli Shura), consisting of a Senate (Sena) and a House of Representatives (Wolesi Jirga), and a president to be indirectly elected to a 7-year term.

Local elections were held throughout the country in August 1987, with a considerable number of the elected representatives reported to be non-PDPA members. On 30 September, Mohammad Najibullah was unanimously elected as President of the Revolutionary Council. In November 1987, a Loya jirga unanimously elected Najibullah as President of the State.

===1988===
In April 1988, elections were held for both houses of the new National Assembly. The People&#x27;s Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) won 46 seats in the House of Representatives and controlled the government with support from the National Front, which won 45 seats, and from various newly recognized left-wing parties, which had won a total of 24 seats. Although the election was boycotted by the Mujahideen, the government left 50 of the 234 seats in the House of Representatives, as well as a small number of seats in the Senate, vacant in the hope that the guerrillas would end their armed struggle and participate in the government.

==Islamic State of Afghanistan==

===1992===

Following the withdrawal of Soviet troops and the ouster of the communist government in April 1992, an indirect election for president took place in December 1992. An interim government, headed by a prime minister, was formed in June 1993.

==Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (2003-2021)==
Due to the largely illiterate nature of Afghan society, ballots during the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan-era displayed images of the candidates, each of whom was also represented by a symbol of their choosing. Conservative Pashtun districts used a &quot;proxy&quot; system to register women voters, which was particularly susceptible to fraud.

===2004===
Under the 2001 Bonn Agreement, Afghanistan was scheduled to hold presidential and parliamentary elections in 2004 in order to replace the transitional government led by American-backed Hamid Karzai since his appointment in December 2001. Presidential elections were held in 2004, but parliamentary elections were not held until mid-September 2005. Hamid Karzai won the election with 55.4% of the votes and three times more votes than any other candidate.

===2005===

Afghanistan held parliamentary and provincial council elections on 18 September 2005. Final results were delayed by accusations of election fraud, and were finally announced on 12 November 2005.

Former warlords and their followers gained the majority of seats in both the lower house and the provincial council (which elects the members of the upper house). Women won 28% of the seats in the lower house, six more than the 25% guaranteed in the 2004 Constitution.

Turnout was estimated at 50%, substantially lower than at the presidential election in October 2004. This was blamed on the lack of identifiable party lists as a result of Afghanistan&#x27;s new electoral law, which left voters in many cases unclear on who they were voting for.

===2009===
The Afghan presidential and provincial council elections held on 20 August 2009 were widely characterized as marred by lack of security, violence, extremely low voter turnout, and widespread ballot stuffing, intimidation, and other electoral fraud. Over 2,800 complaints were received by the Election Complaints Commission, with the largest proportion concerning irregularities at the poll, including ballot box stuffing and voter intimidation. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;fraud was so pervasive that nearly a quarter of all votes were thrown out.&quot; According to an article by &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;some 1.26 million recorded votes were excluded from an election that cost the international community more than $300 million.&quot; and another estimate placed the cost at $500 million.

Official election monitors and the UN placed voter turnout in the August 20 first round of the election at only around 30-33%.

On October 20, 2009, under heavy U.S. and ally pressure, President Hamid Karzai announced his acquiescence to a run-off vote between himself and his main rival, Abdullah Abdullah, to be held on 7 November. Finally on 1 November, however, Abdullah announced that he would no longer be participating in the run-off because his demands for changes in the electoral commission had not been met, and a &quot;transparent election is not possible.&quot; A day later, on 2 November 2009, officials of the very same election commission cancelled the run-off and declared Hamid Karzai as President of Afghanistan for another 5-year term. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the Afghan election commission and Karzai had been under intense pressure from the United States and its allies to cancel the run-off. Abdullah said the appointment had &quot;no legal basis&quot; and Afghans deserved a better government.

===2010===

The next parliamentary elections were held on 18 September 2010. In July 2010, Staffan de Mistura, the U.N. secretary-general&#x27;s special representative for Afghanistan and head of the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), described these as the &quot;mother of all issues&quot; elections. &quot;They will not be Swiss elections, they are going to be Afghan elections,&quot; he said, suggesting the event might not fit the Western definition of democracy. More than 2,600 candidates, including more than 400 women, are running for office.

During the run-up to the elections in September 2010, the Taliban intimidated villagers in certain areas from voting. People in the villages would not vote because the Taliban left night letters warning they will cut off the finger of anyone if they find it marked with the indelible ink used to prevent multiple voting.

In late November 2010, Afghanistan&#x27;s election commission disqualified 21 candidates from the 18 September parliamentary elections for alleged fraudulent activities, a spokesman said. 19 of the candidates were winning or leading their races, according to partial election results, while two others had failed to win seats.

===2014===

A presidential election was held in Afghanistan on 5 April 2014. Incumbent president Hamid Karzai was not eligible to run due to term limits. An initial field of 27 candidates was whittled down to 8 with front runners Abdullah Abdullah and Ashraf Ghani. Fraud allegations tainting the final result resulted in a recount of votes at 1,900 of the 23,000 polling stations. Ghani was eventually declared the winner in September 2014.

===2018===

Parliamentary elections were held on 20 October 2018 to elect members of the House of the People. They had originally been scheduled for 15 October 2016, but were initially postponed to 7 July 2018, and then again to 20 October. Much of the prelude to the elections focused on the debate over reforming the country&#x27;s electoral laws. The new Parliament was later inaugurated on 26 April 2019.

<doc id="1343687" wikidata="Q3083604" url="?curid=1343687" title="H. D. G. Leveson Gower">
<text>Sir Henry Dudley Gresham Leveson Gower ( ; 8 May 1873 – 1 February 1954) was an English cricketer from the Leveson-Gower family. He played first-class cricket for Oxford University and Surrey and captained England in Test cricket. His school nickname &quot;Shrimp&quot; remained with him through his life, but few cricket sources refer to him by anything other than his initials. He was a selector for the England cricket team, and a cricketing knight.

==Early life==
Leveson Gower was born in Titsey Place near Oxted in Surrey, the seventh of twelve sons of Granville William Gresham Leveson-Gower JP DL FSA, by his wife The Honourable Sophia Leveson Gower LJStJ (née Leigh). His father was a great-great grandson of John Leveson-Gower, 1st Earl Gower (descending from his youngest son, John), and served as Liberal MP for two years for Reigate from 1863 to 1865. His mother was the daughter of Chandos Leigh, 1st Baron Leigh and sister of Sir Edward Chandos Leigh QC and James Wentworth Leigh. His uncles, and brothers Frederick Leveson-Gower and Evelyn Marmaduke Gresham Leveson-Gower, also played first-class cricket.

He was educated at Winchester College, where he played cricket for the school first eleven for three years from 1890, and in 1892 he captained the school team to its first victory against Eton College for 10 years, scoring 99 runs and taking 8 wickets for 33 runs in the match. The school team also included Jack Mason, who later played first-class cricket for Kent.

He attended Magdalen College, Oxford, and played cricket for Oxford for four years, receiving his blue in 1893 and captaining the Oxford team in 1896. He hit 73 runs and took 7–84 in the match against Cambridge in 1895. He did not receive a degree.

==Cricket career==
He started to play for Surrey as an amateur in 1895. He played his last match for Surrey in 1920, but continued to play occasional first-class cricket until 1931. In all, he played in 277 first-class matches, scoring 7,638 runs at a batting average of 23.72, including 4 centuries, and took 46 wickets at an average of 29.95, including 5 wickets on three occasions. His highest first-class score, 155, was reached playing for Sussex against Oxford in 1899. As captain of Surrey from 1908 to 1910, he led the team to 3rd, 5th and 2nd in the County Championship. He was treasurer of Surrey from 1926 to 1928, and the club&#x27;s president from 1929 to 1939. He was an outstanding fielder, and took 103 catches.

He toured the West Indies with Lord Hawke in 1896–97, and North America with Pelham Warner in 1897. He joined the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) tours to South Africa in 1905–6, but did not play in the Tests. He returned to South Africa in 1909–10, and captained England in all three of the Test matches he played, winning one and losing two against South Africa in 1909/10, with Frederick Fane captaining the other two Test matches of the series.

He played for the Gentlemen against the Players on several occasions. For fifty years he played a major role in organising the Scarborough Festival which takes place at the end of each English cricket season. Touring Test teams would play annually against H. D. G. Leveson Gower&#x27;s XI. He became a Freeman of the Borough of Scarborough in 1950.

Leveson Gower became an England Test selector in 1909, and was chairman of selectors in 1924 and from 1927 to 1930. In 1925, he published a book called &quot;Cricket Personalities&quot;, which included profiles on well-known cricketers such as Jack Hobbs, Percy Fender and Frank Woolley. He was knighted for his services to cricket in 1953 and in the same year he published a book of reminiscences entitled &quot;Off and on the Field&quot;.

==Other activities==
Outside cricket, Leveson Gower was a stockbroker. He married Enid Mary Hammond-Chambers in 1908. They had no children.

He served as a major in the Royal Army Service Corps in the First World War, and was mentioned in dispatches.

He died in Kensington, survived by his wife.

==Nickname==
Leveson Gower was nicknamed &quot;Shrimp&quot; at school, probably due to his shortness and slight physique, but few cricket sources refer to him by anything other than his initials. During a tour of America in 1897 organised by Plum Warner that Leveson Gower took part in, the Philadelphian journalist Ralph D. Paine published the following piece of humorous verse concerning the pronunciation of his surname:

:&quot;At one end stocky Jessop frowned,&quot;
:&quot;The human catapult&quot;
:&quot;Who wrecks the roofs of distant towns&quot;
:&quot;When set in his assault.&quot;
:&quot;His mate was that perplexing man&quot;
:&quot;We know as &quot;Looshun-Gore&quot;,&quot;
:&quot;It isn’t spelt at all that way,&quot;
:&quot;We don’t know what it&#x27;s for.&quot;

:&quot;But as with Cholmondeley and St. John&quot;
:&quot;The alphabet is mixed,&quot;
:&quot;And Yankees cannot help but ask -&quot;
:&quot;Why don&#x27;t you get it fixed?&quot;

<doc id="1343696" wikidata="Q1754336" url="?curid=1343696" title="Haemonchus contortus">
<text>Haemonchus contortus, also known as the barber&#x27;s pole worm, is a very common parasite and one of the most pathogenic nematodes of ruminants. Adult worms attach to abomasal mucosa and feed on the blood. This parasite is responsible for anemia, oedema, and death of infected sheep and goats, mainly during summer in warm, humid climates.

Females may lay over 10,000 eggs a day, which pass from the host animal in the faeces. After hatching from their eggs, &quot;H. contortus&quot; larvae molt several times, resulting in an L3 form that is infectious for the animals. The host ingests these larvae when grazing. The L4 larvae, formed after another molt, and adult worms suck blood in the abomasum of the animal, potentially giving rise to anaemia and oedema, which eventually can lead to death.

The infection, called haemonchosis, causes large economic losses for farmers around the world, especially for those living in warmer climates. Anthelminthics are used to prevent and treat these, and other, worm infections, but resistance of the parasites against these chemicals is growing. Some breeds, such as the West African Dwarf goat and N&#x27;Dama cattle, are more resistant than other breeds to &quot;H. contortus&quot; (haemonchotolerance).

==Morphology==

The ova is yellowish in color. The egg is about 70–85 μm long by 44 μm wide, and the early stages of cleavage contain between 16 and 32 cells. The adult female is long and is easily recognized by its trademark &quot;barber pole&quot; coloration. The red and white appearance is because &quot;H. contortus&quot; is a blood feeder, and the white ovaries can be seen coiled around the blood-filled intestine. The male adult worm is much smaller at long, and displays the distinct feature of a well-developed copulatory bursa, containing an asymmetrical dorsal lobe and a Y-shaped dorsal ray.

==Life cycle==
The adult female worm can release between 5,000 and 10,000 eggs, which are passed out in the faeces. Eggs then develop in moist conditions in the faeces and continue to develop into the L1 (rhabditiform), and L2 juvenile stages by feeding on bacteria in the dung. The L1 stage usually occurs within four to six days under the optimal conditions of . The L2 rhabditform sheds its cuticle and then develops into the L3 filiariform infective larvae. The L3 form has a protective cuticle, but under dry, hot conditions, survival is reduced.
Sheep, goats, and other ruminants become infected when they graze and ingest the L3 infective larvae. The infective larvae pass through the first three stomach chambers to reach the abomasum. There, the L3 shed their cuticles and burrow into the internal layer of the abomasum, where they develop into L4, usually within 48 hours, or preadult larvae. The L4 larvae then molt and develop into the L5 adult form. The male and female adults mate and live in the abomasum, where they feed on blood.

== Genetics ==
The &quot;H. contortus&quot; draft genome was published in 2013. Further work to complete the reference genome is underway at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in collaboration with the University of Calgary, the University of Glasgow, and the Moredun Research Institute. Developing genetic and genomic resources for this parasite will facilitate the identification of the genetic changes conferring anthelmintic resistance and may help design new drugs or vaccines to combat disease and improve animal health.

The &quot;H. contortus&quot; reference genome was published at chromosome-scale in 2020. 5 autosomes and one X chromosome were assembled. Quite remarkably, each chromosome had a very similar gene content compared to the corresponding chromosome in &quot;C. elegans&quot;, yet there was little conservation of gene order. This genome is the fourth version from Wellcome Sanger.

==Pathogenicity==

Clinical signs are largely due to blood loss. Sudden death may be the only observation in acute infection, while other common clinical signs include pallor, anemia, oedema, ill thrift, lethargy, and depression. The accumulation of fluid in the submandibular tissue, a phenomenon commonly called &quot;bottle jaw&quot;, may be seen. Growth and production are significantly reduced.

==Prevention and treatment==
Prophylactic anthelmintic treatment necessary to prevent infection in endemic regions, but wherever possible, a reduction on reliance on chemical treatment is warranted given the rapid rise of anthelmintic resistance.
A commercial vaccine known as Barbervax in Australia or Wirevax in South Africa has become available in recent years. This works mainly by reducing egg output and hence pasture contamination. The vaccine contains proteins from the lining of the intestines of the Barber&#x27;s Pole worm. The animal produces antibodies against the protein which circulate in the blood. When the Barber&#x27;s pole worm drinks the blood the antibodies attach to its stomach lining, preventing digestion and starving the animal. Following this, the worm produces fewer eggs and eventually dies off.

Targeted selective treatment methods such as the FAMACHA method may be valuable in reducing the number of dosing intervals, thus reducing the percentage of surviving parasites that are resistant to anthelmintics. Faecal egg counts are used to track parasite infestation levels, individual animals&#x27; susceptibility, and anthelmintic effectiveness.

Other management strategies include selective breeding for more parasite-resistant sheep or goats (e.g. by culling the most susceptible animals or by introducing parasite-resistant breeds such as Gulf Coast Native sheep); careful pasture management, such as managed intensive rotational grazing, especially during peak parasite season; and &quot;cleaning&quot; infested pastures by haying, tilling, or grazing with a nonsusceptible species (e.g. swine or poultry).

Recent research has also shown that the use of hair sheep breeds, such as Katahdins, Dorpers, and St. Croix, can be chosen for resistance to internal parasites for economical standards; additionally, the hair breeds provide resistance without showing any significant effect growth performance of their progeny.

One of the riskiest methods that can be used for treatments is the use of copper oxide wire particles (COWP) to aid in the destruction of the parasites inside the gut without the use of organic chemicals. However, in sheep, the dosing would need to be monitored extremely closely because if they are administered too high of a dose, then they will slip into copper toxicity. For the COWP, the lowest recommended dose would need to be administered to remain safe for sheep. The study conducted found that treatment with the COWP reduced faecal egg counts by &gt;85%. Treatment with the copper oxide wire particles could lead to less reliance on anthelmintics because the COWP allows for the reduction in establishment of parasitic infections, especially if the producer is trying to reduce the larval population on their pastures.

Recent research shows fugal lectins are able to inhibit larval development. These fungal lectins are Corprinopsis cinerea lectins - CCL2, CGL2; Aleuria aurantia lectin - AAL; and Marasmius oreades agglutinin - MOA. These four toxic lectins bind to specific glycan structures found in &quot;H. controtus&quot;. Some of these glycan structures might represent antigens which are not exposed to host immune system, and thus have potential for vaccine or drug development.

<text>Master of the hunt (Polish: &quot;łowczy&quot;; Lithuanian: &quot;medžioklis&quot;; Latin: &quot;venator&quot;) was a Polish royal court official from the 13th century with responsibility for organising hunts and guarding royal forests against poachers. Masters of the Hunt also served at the regional courts of magnates in various provinces.

From the 15th century, &quot;Master of the Hunt&quot; was an honorary court title and a district office in the Kingdom of Poland and in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and later in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

* Łowczy wielki koronny - Crown Grand Master of the Hunt

* Łowczy wojewódzki - Voivodship Master of the Hunt
* Łowczy ziemski - District Master of the Hunt
* Łowczy nadworny - Court Master of the Hunt
* Podłowczy - Deputy Master of the Hunt

== Inherited and marital hunting titles ==
The children of hunt masters were entitled to carry on in the paternal office. In the case of sons they would be termed, &quot;łowczyc&quot;. In the case of daughters, the equivalent title was &quot;łowczanka&quot;. The wife of a &quot;Łowczy&quot; had the right to call herself, &quot;łowczyna&quot;.

<doc id="1343709" wikidata="Q3350655" url="?curid=1343709" title="Oliver Heywood">
<text>Oliver Heywood (9 September 1825 – 1892) was an English banker and philanthropist.

Born in Irlam O&#x27;Th&#x27; Height, Lancashire, the son of Benjamin Heywood, and educated at Eton College, Heywood joined the family business, Heywood&#x27;s Bank in the 1840s.

Heywood sponsored many philanthropic causes, including Manchester Mechanics&#x27; Institute, Chetham&#x27;s Hospital, Manchester Grammar School and Owens College. He was selected as High Sheriff of Lancashire for 1888.

He married Eleanor Barton, daughter of Richard Watson Barton, on 7 September 1847; they had no children.

==Life==
On 9 September 1825, Oliver Heywood was born in Irlams O&#x27; Th&#x27; Height near Manchester, England to the prominent English banker and well known philanthropist Sir Benjamin Heywood and his wife Sophia Ann Robinson. Located in St. Ann&#x27;s Square, the Heywood bank was one of the more recognisable bank names in Manchester but had suffered some tarnishing of its image from the 1700s.

Heywood was educated in Liverpool at St. Domingo House, at the time, a boarding school for boys that was housed by a large mansion. He then was educated at Mr. Mertz&#x27;s School in Manchester and then at Eton College for his higher education. Heywood followed the finishing of his formal education by travelling abroad before beginning his very promising career in the family banking business.

On 7 September 1847, Heywood married Eleanor Barton, the daughter of a merchant from Pendlebury named Richard Watson Barton. The couple first lived in Acresfield in the house where Heywood had been born in Irlams O&#x27; Th&#x27; Height near Manchester. However, after the death of Sir Benjamin Heywood in 1865, the couple moved into his house in nearby Claremont. Eleanor died childless in September 1877.

===Slavery===
The Heywood family fortune had ties to the trans-Atlantic slave trade. Oliver Heywood&#x27;s great-grandfather, Benjamin Heywood, was one of the family that had lived in Liverpool, where they owned a shipping company in the 1700s. This transported goods made in Manchester to West Africa, where they were traded for African slaves who were then taken to Barbados. There the slaves were traded in turn for sugar and cotton, which were landed in Liverpool on the ships&#x27; return voyage. The slave trade was lucrative but eventually recognised as unscrupulous. It was from this activity that Benjamin Heywood had been able to establish the family bank in Manchester in 1788.

===Business===
In 1845, Heywood joined his father&#x27;s banking company, called Sir Benjamin Heywood &amp; Co.. In 1847, he was made a partner in the company, as also later were his three younger brothers. In 1860, upon the retirement of his father, Oliver became the senior partner of the bank, which was then renamed as Heywood Brothers &amp; Co.

Under Oliver Heywood&#x27;s leadership, the bank fulfilled his father&#x27;s legacy within the business; the bank kept its reputation that it had earned for reliability and prudence. These two particular qualities would prove to be both tested, then after reaffirmed, to be defining for the bank&#x27;s survival during the financial crisis of 1866, which was spurred by the collapse of an old and prestigious banking firm &quot;Overend, Gurney &amp; Co.&quot;; this major bankruptcy caused a serious panic within the English banking sector.

Oliver Heywood was in London at the time when the crisis first struck. He witnessed all the panic that had ensued after the bankruptcy of Overend, Gurney &amp; Co.; the entire banking sector in London was in chaos. Heywood&#x27;s first instinct was to hurry home to Manchester to check on the firm: luckily everything at the firm had been copacetic, just how he left it. The firm&#x27;s well-weathering of the financial crisis of 1866 is largely given credit to how Heywood managed his company, he was reliable and prudent. Never taking a risk that was too dangerous or that would over-extend the firm financially.

In 1876, Oliver Heywood would remain the senior partner of Heywood Brothers &amp; Co. until the firm was acquired by Manchester &amp; Salford Bank. As part of the agreement made in the acquisition, there was an arrangement that Heywood and his three younger brothers would continue to hold high ranking positions in Manchester &amp; Salford Bank. The arrangement made Heywood and his brothers directors in the new firm.

In 1878, Heywood had retired all his obligations, beyond being a shareholder, to the Manchester &amp; Salford Bank. This virtually meant that he stopped attending the board meetings that were required of a member of the Board of Directors; and in turn was not re-elected to the firm&#x27;s board. Heywood&#x27;s reasoning for no longer attending the board meetings came from a place of disapproval with the firm&#x27;s general manager Thomas Read Wilkinson&#x27;s recent acquisition. Wilkinson had made the decision to purchase Hardcastle, Cross &amp; Co., the bank that was located in Bolton.

===Philanthropy===
Oliver Heywood&#x27;s family bank was very successful during the Victorian era. The prosperity from the Heywood Bank rewarded the family handsomely, the amount of wealth Heywood was receiving allowed him to have more time and focus on charitable and philanthropic work. These righteous pursuits also included but were not only limited to liberal causes in Salford and Manchester. Heywood&#x27;s philanthropic interests had a particular focus in education. He started off supporting and financing for projects to erect and establish working men&#x27;s colleges. Heywood even assisted his resources to help erect and establish the Owens College, which eventually became a forerunner of the University of Manchester. Heywood&#x27;s philanthropic pursuits were looked at as very admirable considering that many of his contemporaries were uninterested in public duties. His contemporaries, or other people with substantial wealth, were moving out of the grimy cities to the more desirable country manor or suburban areas. Since a large portion of the wealthy were no longer living in the cities, this meant that consequently this sect of the wealthy was also less interested in providing charity for a community that they no longer inhabited. Heywood, deciding to stay in Manchester, and with his very generous inclinations, was very prone to provide a little extra to his community&#x27;s needs.

Some of Heywood&#x27;s contributions and support he led to education were mainly in Manchester and included: Victoria University, Owens College, Manchester Grammar School, Manchester High School for Girls, Hulme Grammar School, Manchester Technical School, Manchester School Board, Salford School Board, and the Association for the Promotion of Technical Education in the Manchester District.

Heywood also provided his support and contributed to the healthcare organisations and facilities of Manchester, these include: Hospital for Sick Children, St Mary&#x27;s Hospital, Manchester Royal Infirmary, Salford Royal Hospital, the Royal Eye Hospital Manchester, the Royal Asylum, and the Provident Dispensaries Association.

Heywood was passionate and often locally involved to the best of his capacity towards, what was then considered, &quot;Progressive Causes&quot;. He was a staunch supporter of the Anti-Slavery movement in England, and in turn, the world. It was not considered rare or bizarre to find Heywood at local Anti-Slavery meetings in Manchester. One of the more notable meetings, held in November 1872, recorded Heywood in attendance; it was focused on the stopping of the African slave trade that was being carried out in East Africa.

Heywood&#x27;s father, Sir Benjamin Heywood, was a parliamentary representative during the 1830s. Despite Heywood&#x27;s father&#x27;s political legacy and his own public record of charity and public service, Heywood never took a career in politics seriously.

===Legacy===
In 1888, Heywood&#x27;s public work and sacrifice was acknowledged by the city of Manchester making him the city&#x27;s first Honorary Freeman. On 17 March 1892, he died in his home. He was buried at St. John&#x27;s church in Pendlebury. The funeral ceremony was vast and impressive: The bishops of Guildford and Manchester both conducted the service where thousands of people showed up to pay their respects and 150 carriages were used. On the afternoon of Heywood&#x27;s funeral, shops in Irlams O&#x27; Th&#x27; Height and Pendlebury closed in his honour.

It was decided to erect a marble statue in commemoration and to place it in Albert Square, Manchester. The commission was given to Albert Bruce-Joy, with the £2600 cost being met by contributions from 332 donors. Bruce-Joy had previously sculpted a statue of John Bright in Albert Square and the committee overseeing the Heywood memorial believed that his statue of Heywood would complement that of Bright. It was unveiled in December 1894 and bears the inscription that his life was one &quot;devoted to the public good&quot;.

<doc id="1343710" wikidata="Q5354606" url="?curid=1343710" title="Elections in Albania">
<text>Regular elections in Albania are mandated by the Constitution and legislation enacted by Parliament. The Parliament (&quot;Kuvendi&quot;) has 140 members elected for four-year terms. The electoral system is open list proportional representation. There are 12 multi-member constituencies corresponding to the country&#x27;s 12 administrative regions. Within any constituency, parties must meet a threshold of 3 percent of votes, and pre-election coalitions must meet a threshold of 5 percent of votes.

This electoral system replaced a mixed-member system in November 2008. Under the old system, 100 members were elected directly in single member constituencies with approximately equal numbers of voters. 40 were elected from multi-name lists of parties or party coalitions according to their ranking. The total number of deputies of a party or a party coalition was to be, to the closest possible extent, proportional to the valid votes won by that party or coalition on the national scale in the first round of elections. Parties that received less than 2.5% and coalitions that received less than 4% of the valid votes on the national scale in the first round of elections did not benefit from the respective multi-name list.

The change was criticised by the smaller parties, but supported by the two main parties. It was considered an important step towards Albania&#x27;s European integration. Other changes included limiting the prosecutor general&#x27;s term to five years, forcing an early election in case of a no-confidence vote and reducing the majority required to elect the president from three-fifths to half the MPs.

The president is elected by parliament.

Albania has a multi-party system, with two or three strong parties and several other parties that are electorally successful.

== History ==

On 31 March 1991, the first pluralist elections were held in the country. The elections were conducted with a clean majority system in 250 constituencies. 98.2% of voters took part in the voting. The participating parties registered a total of 1,074 candidates while 17 of the candidates were independent. The final election results declared the Labor Party the winner with 56.17% of the vote. The Democratic Party won 38.71% of the vote, the Republican Party 1.77%, the Omonia Organization 0.73%, the Agrarian Party 0.07% and the Veterans Committee 0.28%. With a 250-seat parliament, the results were translated into 169 deputies for the Labor Party, the Democratic Party 75 deputies, Omonia 5 deputies and the Veterans Committee 1 deputy. The Democratic Party achieved high results and received a larger number of deputies compared to the Labor Party in the main cities such as: Durrës (13 deputies out of 19 in total), Shkodër (16 out of 19 in total), Tirana (19 out of 29). Whereas in Krujë and Vlorë the number of deputies of the two major parties was equal. This was considered a great victory for the DP given that the communist party that had ruled the country for about 50 years still continued to have strong control over the population, especially in those living in rural areas and still doubting that the dictatorship would fall.

On 8 May 2000, the Albanian Parliament approved the Electoral Code only with the votes of the Socialists, which had an overwhelming majority in the assembly that emerged from the 1997 elections. The Democratic Party rejected the Electoral Code in its entirety due to the composition of the Central Election Commission (&quot;KQZ or CEC&quot;) of 6 members. They boycotted his approval in parliament even though he had attended most of the roundtables organized for the debate over the Electoral Code. According to the new Electoral Code, voting in Albania would be based on a mixed, majority-proportional electoral system. From where 100 deputies, in the 140-seat parliament, would be elected by majority vote from single-member constituencies, while 40 seats were filled by national multi-member lists of political parties in order to achieve a proportional approach between nationally received votes and deputies which represented a political party in the assembly. To win a proportional mandate, political parties had to cross the 2.5% electoral threshold, while coalitions had to cross the 4% threshold.

== Presidential elections ==
The election of the president of Albania is regulated by the constitution of Albania, particularly outlined in the fourth part, comprising articles 86 to 94. To be eligible for candidacy, individuals must fulfill several criteria as delineated in the constitution: they must be Albanian citizens by birth, have resided in Albania for no less than the past 10 years, be at least 40 years of age, and possess the right to vote. The constitution mandates that the president shall not occupy any other public office, be affiliated with any political party, or engage in private business activities. The electoral process commences with the parliament of Albania, which is responsible for scheduling elections at least 30 days prior to the expiration of the incumbent term of the president. Candidates are nominated through a formal process in which a group of at least 20 members of the total 140 members of the parliament may propose an individual for the presidency.

The election is conducted by the parliament through a secret ballot without debate, requiring a candidate to secure a majority of three-fifths of all members of the parliament. If this majority is not achieved in the first ballot, a second ballot is held within seven days, followed by a third ballot if necessary. If no candidate receives the required majority after the third ballot, a fourth ballot occurs within seven days, limited to the two candidates with the highest votes from the previous round. If neither candidate secures the necessary majority in the fourth ballot, a fifth ballot is conducted. If, after the fifth ballot, neither candidate achieves the required majority, the parliament is dissolved, necessitating subsequent parliamentary elections within 60 days. The successive elected parliament is then responsible for electing the president according to the procedures regulated in the constitution. Further, if the parliament fails to elect a president, it correspondingly will be dissolved, requiring another round of general elections within the same period.

The president begins their duties after taking an oath before the parliament, affirming their commitment to uphold the constitution and laws of Albania, respect the rights and freedoms of citizens, protect the independence of the nation, and serve the general interest and progress of the Albanians. The term of office for the president is defined at five years, with the possibility of re-election for a maximum of two consecutive terms. In the event that a president resigns before the end of their term, they are prohibited from being a candidate in the subsequent presidential election. When the president is temporarily unable to exercise their functions or if the office becomes vacant, the speaker of the parliament of Albania assumes the responsibilities of the president. If the president is unable to fulfill their duties for more than 60 days, the parliament must decide, by a two-thirds majority, whether to refer the issue to the constitutional court. The court determines the incapacity of the president, and if incapacity is confirmed, the election of a successive president must commence within 10 days of such determination.

<text>PFC Krylia Sovetov Samara () is a Russian professional football club based in Samara. It returned to the Russian Premier League for the 2021–22 season. In 2004, they finished third in the Russian Premier League.

==History==
Krylia Sovetov was founded in Kuybyshev (now Samara) in 1942. On 21 April 1946 the team played its first match in the highest division in the USSR in Alma-Ata, in which they lost 1–2 to Zenit Leningrad. Krylia Sovetov participated in 48 seasons of the Soviet Top League and 13 in the Russian Premier League, as well as 43 USSR Cups and 13 Russian Cups.

On 6 July 2002, Krylia Sovetov first played in a European competition, in the second round of the UEFA Intertoto Cup. They won this game with Dinaburg (Daugavpils, Latvia) played in Metallurg Stadium, by a score of 3–0. The goals were scored by Andrei Karyaka, Robertas Poškus and Rogério Gaúcho. In 2005, the team played in 2005–06 UEFA Cup and defeated BATE Borisov in the 2nd qualifying round (2–0, 2–0), but in the 1st round lost to AZ Alkmaar (5–3, 1–3). In 2009, they were eliminated in the Europa League 3rd qualifying round by St Patrick&#x27;s Athletic.

===2010 licensing controversy===
Krylia Sovetov Samara, who were scheduled to pass licensing on 4 February 2010, asked Russian Football Union to postpone their licensing until 15 February of the same year due to financial problems and debts to players. The club was reported to be close to liquidation due to shortage of financing.

It later asked to postpone the licensing again to 19 February, but the RFU only postponed it until 17 February. On 17 February it was decided to postpone the licensing until 19 February after all. Krylia Sovetov finally received their license on 19 February after agreeing on new contracts with several companies to sponsor them, some of which might become partial owners of the club.

As the first matchday arrived, Krylia Sovetov were still banned from registering new players because of debts outstanding on old contracts. They could only register 11 players over 21 years old and several more players from the youth team that were registered for them in 2009. The transfer deadline had to be extended from 11 March to 8 April to accommodate Krylia Sovetov in hope they will pay their outstanding debts shortly. With injuries on top of that and only 16 players available for both their main squad and the reserve team, their reserve team had to finish their first game with 9 players on the field as they only had a goalkeeper on the bench after two players were injured, and the main squad had to play against Zenit St. Petersburg with a heavily diluted roster, so even the loss with the score 0–1 was saluted by the Krylia&#x27;s fans. The transfer ban was confirmed again on 16 March, and was to remain in place until Krylia paid back their debts to their former players Jan Koller and Jiří Jarošík. Krylia lost the second game with the diluted roster 0–3 to Lokomotiv Moscow. The ban was finally lifted on 26 March.

<doc id="1343728" wikidata="Q3815551" url="?curid=1343728" title="Sphingomonas">
<text>Sphingomonas was defined in 1990 as a group of Gram-negative, rod-shaped, chemoheterotrophic, strictly aerobic bacteria. They possess ubiquinone 10 as their major respiratory quinone, contain glycosphingolipids (GSLs), specifically ceramide, instead of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in their cell envelopes, and typically produce yellow-pigmented colonies. The GSL serves to protect the bacteria from antibacterial substances. Unlike most Gram-negative bacteria, &quot;Sphingomonas&quot; cannot carry endotoxins due to the lack of lipopolysaccharides, and has a hydrophobic surface characterized by the short nature of the GSL&#x27;s carbohydrate portion.

By 2001, the genus included more than 20 species that were quite diverse in terms of their phylogenetic, ecological, and physiological properties. As a result, &quot;Sphingomonas&quot; was subdivided into different genera: &quot;Sphingomonas&quot;, &quot;Sphingobium&quot;, &quot;Novosphingobium&quot;, &quot;Sphingosinicella&quot;, and &quot;Sphingopyxis&quot;. These genera are commonly referred to collectively as sphingomonads. Distinct from other sphingomonads, &quot;Sphingomonas&quot; genomic structure includes a unique lipid formation, major 2-OH fatty acids, homospermidine as the primary polyamine, and signature nucleotide bases within the 16S rRNA gene. The bacteria holds 3914 proteins, 70 organizational RNA, and 3,948,000 base pairs (incomplete observation).

== Habitat ==
The sphingomonads are widely distributed in nature, having been isolated from many different land and water habitats, as well as from plant root systems, clinical specimens, and other sources; this is due to their ability to survive in low concentrations of nutrients, as well as to metabolize a wide variety of carbon sources. Numerous strains have been isolated from environments contaminated with toxic compounds, where they display the ability to use the contaminants as nutrients.

== Role in disease ==
Some of the sphingomonads (especially &quot;Sphingomonas paucimobilis&quot;) also play a role in human disease, primarily by causing a range of mostly nosocomial, non-life-threatening infections that typically are easily treated by antibiotic therapy. In contrast, the seed-endophytic strain &quot;Sphingomonas melonis&quot; ZJ26 that can be naturally enriched in certain rice cultivars, confers diseases resistance against a bacterial pathogen and is vertically transmitted among plant generations via their seeds.

== Applications ==

=== Biotechnological utilization ===
Due to their biodegradative and biosynthetic capabilities, sphingomonads have been used for a wide range of biotechnological applications, from bioremediation of environmental contaminants to production of extracellular polymers such as sphingans (e.g., gellan, welan, and rhamsan) used extensively in the food and other industries. The shorter carbohydrate moiety of GSL compared to that of LPS results in the cell surface being more hydrophobic than that of other Gram-negative bacteria, probably accounting for both &quot;Sphingomonas&quot;&#x27; sensitivity to hydrophobic antibiotics and its ability to degrade hydrophobic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. One strain, &quot;Sphingomonas&quot; sp. 2MPII, can degrade 2-methylphenanthrene. In May 2008, Daniel Burd, a 16-year-old Canadian, won the Canada-Wide Science Fair in Ottawa after discovering that &quot;Sphingomonas&quot; can degrade over 40% of the weight of plastic bags (polyethylene) in less than three months.

A &quot;Sphingomonas&quot; sp. strain BSAR-1 expressing a high activity alkaline phosphatase (PhoK) has also been applied for bioprecipitation of uranium from alkaline solutions. The precipitation ability was enhanced by overexpressing PhoK protein in &quot;E. coli&quot;. This is the first report of bioprecipitation of uranium under alkaline conditions.

=== Wine fermentation ===
Wine, developed through the alcoholic fermentation of grapes, is an alcoholic beverage that is sensorially characterized by micro-bacteria and a host of other environmental factors. While historic variables such as location, temperature, soil quality, and winemaking practices play a role in altering the taste of a wine, microbial biogeography plays a significant role in the quality of wine. A &quot;terroir&quot;, comprising the aforementioned characteristics, influences the quality of the wine grapes based on the unique vineyard region that it originates from. The bacterial diversity of the grapes anticipates a wine’s chemical structure. The management of these microbial factors, within the fermentation process, allows producers to control the prevalence of desirable regional attributes.

While most microbiota cannot survive the wine fermentation process, &quot;Sphingomonas&quot;, found in soil, grape leaves, and on fermentation surfaces, can survive this process. The pigmentation, stress resistance levels, unique restorative DNA system, and low nutrient necessity allows further growth in the phyllosphere. As the grape matures, the microbial count increases due to nutrient availability and expansion of its surface area. Researchers at the University of California, Davis observed an increase in abundance of the &quot;Sphingomonas&quot; bacteria from finished wines cultivated within Napa and Sonoma Counties, California. This indicates that &quot;Sphingomonas&quot; is a biomarker for the chemical composition of wine. &quot;Sphingomonas&quot; is found throughout the wine fermentation process indicating a relationship between the bacteria and microbial terroir of the wines.

<text>Sir Thomas FitzAlan (died 1430) of Betchworth Castle in Surrey was a medieval English knight.

He was the 2nd son of John FitzAlan, 2nd Baron Arundel and Elizabeth le Despenser of Betchworth. Thomas was the younger brother of John Fitzalan, 3rd Baron Arundel who was eventually made 6th Earl of Arundel. Thomas also had a younger brother, Edward Fitzalan, and was a grandson of John FitzAlan (D&#x27;Arundel) and Eleanor Maltravers. Thomas was Lord of Betchworth Castle, also known as Beechworth.

Sir Thomas married Joan Moyns, and they were parents of Eleanor FitzAlan. She was married to Sir Thomas Browne. They had four sons and a daughter. 

They are ancestors of many famous English families. As well as the poet, Percy Bysshe Shelley. Another descendant is the American Abolitionist, John Brown.

Thomas FitzAlan sold Betchworth Castle to his son-in-law, Sir Thomas Browne, and upon FitzAlan&#x27;s death, the castle passed from the FitzAlans to the Brownes, who occupied it until 1690.

<text>The White Towns of Andalusia, or Pueblos Blancos, are a series of whitewashed towns and large villages in the northern part of the provinces of Cádiz and Málaga in southern Spain, mostly within the Sierra de Grazalema Natural Park.

== History and description ==
The area has been settled since prehistoric times, and some of the local caves have ancient rock paintings. Iberian people, Roman, Visigoths and Berbers are some of the settlers before the Modern Era that left their print. It was precisely during Roman times that whitewashing was introduced, but it was later during the pandemic plague waves during 14th and later centuries when whitewashing exterior but also interior walls of houses and churches - the latter often visited by disease-affected inhabitants - became predominant. 
These villages punctuate or are close to natural parks in the south of the Iberian Peninsula, including Sierra de Grazalema Natural Park that is listed as a biosphere reserve and is the highest rainfall area in Spain, or Los Alcornocales Natural Park with its cork oak protected landscape.

All of the villages are characterised by whitewashed walls and red or brown tiled roofs. They also commonly present narrow alleyways, steep hills, lookouts, and town squares with a church and town hall. Often local institutions manage archeological museums with Roman or Arab artifacts, as well as others dedicated to local customs, crafts or trades.

<doc id="1343734" wikidata="Q4711262" url="?curid=1343734" title="Albert Square, Manchester">
<text>Albert Square is a public square in the centre of Manchester, England. It is dominated by its largest building, the Grade I listed Manchester Town Hall, a Victorian Gothic building by Alfred Waterhouse. Other smaller buildings from the same period surround it, many of which are listed (the buildings on the north side are in Princess Street).

The square contains a number of monuments and statues, the largest of which is the Albert Memorial, a monument to Prince Albert, Prince Consort of Queen Victoria. The square, named after the Prince, was laid out to provide a space for the memorial in 1863–67. Work on the town hall began in 1868 and was completed in 1877.

==History==
The area in which the square is situated was once derelict land and an area of dense housing near the Town Yard and the River Tib (named Longworth&#x27;s Folly).

The square&#x27;s creation arose out of a project by Manchester Corporation&#x27;s Monuments Committee to erect a memorial to Prince Albert who had died of typhoid in 1861. After initial proposals to create a memorial library, museum or botanical gardens, the committee decided to erect a statue in a decorated canopy. It was originally planned to place the monument in front of the Royal Infirmary building at Piccadilly, between the statues of Wellington and Peel. However it was felt that its ornate Gothic design was not in keeping with the neoclassical infirmary. In 1863, land was offered by the Corporation which was cleared to make way for a public space.

The project won much public support; the Manchester Bricklayers&#x27; Protection Society donated 50,000 bricks towards the monument&#x27;s construction, &quot;as an expression of sympathy towards our beloved Queen&quot;. When construction problems arose (the site was found to be riddled with drains and culverts) and the bricks were used up on the foundations alone, a public subscription was launched in 1865 and a further £6,249 was raised, in spite of the hardships of the Cotton Famine.

Clearing the site began in 1864, and required the demolition of over 100 buildings, including the Engraver&#x27;s Arms pub, a coffee roasting works, a smithy, a coal yard and various warehouses. The project was encouraged by the visit of the Prince and Princess of Wales to open the Albert Monument in 1869.

It was decided to construct a new town hall for Manchester, as the old building in King Street had become too small. Following an architectural competition, Gothic designs for a building with a high bell tower by Sir Alfred Waterhouse were selected, and the Town Hall was begun in 1868 and completed in 1877.

In the early 1970s, there was a plan to build an underground station under Albert Square and neighbouring St Peter&#x27;s Square, as part of the ill-fated Picc-Vic tunnel project. The project was eventually cancelled and the station was not built.

In April 1972, the area around Albert Square was designated a conservation area, and in 1981 to include the neighbouring, newly created Lincoln Square. (The creation of Lincoln Square completed a &quot;procesional way&quot; from the Law Courts through Spinningfields and Lincoln Square to the Town Hall.)

The centre of Albert Square was originally laid out in the form of a traffic circle and a group of bus stops occupied the western part. In 1987 the square was redesigned and the eastern side in front of the town hall was pedestrianised. The square was laid with fan-shaped granite setts, York stone paving and &#x27;heritage&#x27;-style cast-iron street furniture.

==Monuments==

===Albert Memorial===

Albert Square&#x27;s largest monument is the Grade I listed Albert Memorial, commemorating the Prince Consort. It features a marble statue of Albert standing on a plinth and facing west, designed by Matthew Noble (1862–1867). The figure is placed within a large Medieval-style ciborium which was designed by the architect Thomas Worthington. Noble was commissioned by the then mayor, Thomas Goadsby, to sculpt the Prince&#x27;s likeness, and the designs were personally approved by Queen Victoria.

Worthington himself had, at the age of 18, been presented with the Royal Society of Arts&#x27; Isis Gold Medal by Prince Albert for a design for a Gothic-style chancel. His Medieval-style design for the Albert Memorial was inspired by the Church of Santa Maria della Spina in Pisa. Although his design was unusual for its time, commentators have suggested he may have been influenced by George Kemp&#x27;s Scott Monument in Princes Street, Edinburgh, built 20 years earlier.

The memorial is topped with an ornate spire, and on each side a crocketed gable with canopied pinnacles on colonettes. Within the canopies stand symbolic figures representing art, commerce, science and agriculture. Below these stand secondary figures representing particular disciplines:
*The Four Arts: painting, architecture, music, sculpture
*Commerce: the Four Continents
*The Four Sciences: chemistry, astronomy, mechanics, mathematics
*Agriculture: the Four Seasons

The coloured sett paving which was laid around the memorial in 1987 depicts floral representations of the Four Home Nations of England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales.

Proposals to move or demolish the Albert Memorial have been made; a plan to replace Prince Albert with a war memorial following the First World War was defeated; and when the Albert Memorial had fallen into disrepair, it was proposed that it should be demolished. It was rescued from destruction several times by campaigners, and was finally restored with help from Robert Ernest Shapley in 1976–77. The Albert Memorial Restoration Committee, chaired by J. L. Womersley, raised £50,000 to repair the memorial through public appeal, a fact that is noted in an inscription at its base. 

====London Albert Memorial====
Manchester&#x27;s Albert Memorial, completed in 1865, was the first of several Albert Memorials around the United Kingdom, and it bears a noticeable similarity to the Albert Memorial in Kensington Gardens, London, which was completed some seven years after the Mancunian monument. Claims that Worthington&#x27;s design influenced George Gilbert Scott in his London monument are disputed. Scott, writing in his &quot;Recollections&quot;, stated that his idea of building a medieval canopy was original, &quot;so new as to provoke much opposition&quot;.

===Other monuments===
Within the square are several other monuments:

* Bishop James Fraser by Thomas Woolner (1887), Grade II listed 
* John Bright by Albert Bruce-Joy (1891), Grade II listed 
* Oliver Heywood by Albert Bruce-Joy (1894), Grade II listed
* William Ewart Gladstone by Mario Raggi (1901), Grade II listed
* A fountain (also designed by Thomas Worthington) erected for the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria (1897). This was returned to the square in 1997 having been kept in storage for a period before that.

====Gallery====
====Lincoln Square====
Neighbouring Lincoln Square, created in 1981, features:
* A fountain commemorating the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer in 1981 (since converted into a flower bed)
* A statue of Abraham Lincoln (1809–1865), 16th President of the United States, by George Gray Barnard in the eponymous Lincoln Square was presented to the city by Mr. and Mrs. Charles Phelps Taft of Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1919 to mark the part that Lancashire played in the cotton famine and American Civil War of 1861–1865. The Lincoln statue was originally located in Platt Fields Park and was moved to the square in 1986.

==Notable buildings==

Albert Square is bounded by a varied selection of listed Victorian buildings, the largest being the town hall. Only the western side of the square (facing the town hall) has lost its original buildings and is now occupied by brick and glass office blocks erected during the 1980s. Buildings in Albert Square include:
* Manchester Town Hall (1868–77) – neo-Gothic sandstone ashlar local governmental building on a triangular site, with a bell tower, housing a carillon of 23 bells, designed by Alfred Waterhouse for Manchester Corporation. Contains mural paintings by Ford Madox Brown.
* the Abbey National building (c.1900), Grade II listed – Neoclassical Portland stone bank by Percy Worthington with semicircular front.
* Albert Chambers, 16 Albert Square (1873), Grade II listed – Venetian-style sandstone ashlar offices designed by Clegg and Knowles for Manchester Corporation Gasworks.
* Carlton House (formerly Bridgewater Buildings), 17–18 Albert Square (1872), Grade II listed – Venetian Gothic-style sandstone ashlar office buildings by Clegg and Knowles.
* St Andrew&#x27;s Chambers, 20–21 Albert Square (1874), Grade II listed – Neo-Gothic sandstone corner building designed by George T. Redmayne for the Scottish Widows Fund Life Assurance Society.
*The Memorial Hall, by architect Thomas Worthington for the Unitarian Church (1866), Grade II* listed, Southmill Street corner.

<doc id="1343742" wikidata="Q5980798" url="?curid=1343742" title="Ian Athfield">
<text>Sir Ian Charles Athfield (known as Ath) (15 July 1940 – 16 January 2015) was a New Zealand architect who designed distinctive and innovative houses that challenged suburban norms, as well as celebrated commercial, public and institutional projects. He was born in Christchurch and graduated from the University of Auckland in 1963 with a Diploma of Architecture. That same year he joined Structon Group Architects, and he became a partner in 1965. In 1968 he was a principal partner in setting up Athfield Architects with Ian Dickson and Graeme John Boucher. 

== Projects ==

In 1965 Athfield started work on his first major project, Athfield House, for his family and a studio. Located in Khandallah, Wellington, this distinctive group of structures stands out amongst neighbouring conventional suburban houses. His early projects were constructed with a broad palette of materials including corrugated iron, plaster, stainless steel and fibre glass. As a reaction to much of the bland &quot;Modern&quot; architecture of the period, Athfield built in a deliberately vernacular style using features harking back to colonial buildings. His designs incorporated finials, steeply pitched roofs, timber weatherboards, verandahs and double hung windows. He was also inspired by the architecture of the Greek Islands with their exterior envelopes of continuous plaster and small windows. Conversely, he also much admired the buildings of Mies van der Rohe with their precise and refined detailing of industrial materials.

Yet another area of influence for Athfield was the geometric massing of the Japanese Metabolists. Athfield combined all these disparate elements into a highly eclectic and personal style. During the 1970s Athfield built and renovated numerous domestic houses and buildings, developing a distinctive and highly personal design approach based on the repetition of small scale elements and complex massing. Critical opposition to these &#x27;cartoon houses&#x27; did not bother him. Another criticism of Athfield&#x27;s houses were that they were built for charm and not practicality. Athfield believed, however, that &quot;in a house, you should get a surprise every time you turn a corner and look up&quot;.

Athfield&#x27;s practice expanded during the 1980s from mainly residential work to a wider variety of community and commercial buildings. As well as continuing to work on small-scale projects, his portfolio includes churches, pubs, council flats, stadiums and commercial high-rise buildings. Athfield&#x27;s best known works include Telecom Towers, Civic Square and Wellington Central Library, Jade Stadium in Christchurch and work on the design of the Bangkok rapid transport system.

He was a President of the New Zealand Institute of Architects, judged many design competitions and was a keynote speaker at many overseas conferences. His firm&#x27;s later projects included Chews Lane Precinct, the Wellington Overseas Passenger Terminal redevelopment and the Wellington Marine Education Centre.

A documentary on Athfield, &quot;Architect of Dreams&quot;, was produced for the NZ Documentary Festival.

Following the Canterbury earthquakes of 2010 and 2011, Athfield was appointed as an Architectural Ambassador to Christchurch. In 2012, architectural historian Julia Gatley published a book called &quot;Athfield Architects&quot;, about Athfield and his firm, following an exhibition she curated at the City Gallery Wellington.

==Awards and honours==
Athfield won over 60 national and international architecture and design awards. In 1976 he won first prize in the International Competition for the Urban Environment of Developing Countries. In 1978 he was placed first equal in a Low Cost Housing Design Competition in Fiji. He won 13 NZIA Supreme Awards for his outstanding architectural projects. In 2004 he won the New Zealand Institute of Architects&#x27; highest honour, the Gold Medal. Athfield was the first New Zealand architect to register as an APEC architect.

Athfield was awarded the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal. In the 1996 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, he was appointed a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to architecture, and in the 2015 New Year Honours he was promoted to Knight Companion of the same order.

He received a Distinguished Alumni Award in 1997 from the University of Auckland, and in 2000 he was awarded an honorary LitD by Victoria University of Wellington. Accepting his honorary doctorate on 18 April, Athfield stated:

I accept this on behalf of architects, designers, plumbers and gas fitters. We have suffered at the hands of accountants and engineers for too long. (Ian Athfield, 2000)

== Personal life ==
Athfield married Clare Cookson in Kawakawa on 22 December 1962. They had two sons. Clare, an interior designer, played an important role in many projects at Athfield Architects and her work was a significant reason for the firm&#x27;s success. Athfield died in 2015 due to complications from a routine procedure which resulted in pneumonia, at the Wellington Hospital, where he was being treated for prostate cancer.

<text>A Kommando (, &quot;unit&quot; or &quot;command&quot;) is a general term for special police and military forces in German, Dutch, and Afrikaans speaking nations.

It was also the term in the World War II era &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; for special units used to test new aircraft for combat readiness (as &quot;Erprobungskommando&quot; units) and examples existed that only used the &quot;Kommando&quot; name, such as the Luftwaffe &quot;Gruppe&quot;-sized &quot;Kommando Nowotny&quot;. In the winter/spring 1945 period, single-plane &quot;Kommando&quot;-designated units that used the Arado Ar 234 &quot;Blitz&quot; jet powered reconnaissance-bomber operated from hidden, forest-lined runways in eastern Germany.

Before and during World War II, the basic unit of organization of forced labourers in Nazi concentration camps, equivalent to a detail or detachment were referred to as &quot;Kommandos&quot;.

Among the most notable of such units were the Sonderkommandos (), carrying out the Final Solution by guarding the newly arrived inmates, escorting them to gas chambers, searching the bodies and burning them. &quot;Außenkommandos&quot; were external work details that were set up, either leaving from the concentration camp or from outside the camp boundary.

In &quot;Auschwitz: A Doctor&#x27;s Eyewitness Account&quot;, concentration camp survivor Dr. Miklós Nyiszli (who served on Dr. Josef Mengele&#x27;s medical kommando) describes the &quot;tooth-pulling kommando&quot;. These teams of eight, all &quot;fine stomatologists and dental surgeons&quot; equipped &quot;in one hand with a lever, and in the other a pair of pliers for extracting teeth&quot;, worked in the crematoria. Stationed in front of the ovens, their job was to pry open the mouths of prisoners who had been gassed and extract, or break off, &quot;all gold teeth, as well as any gold bridgework and fillings&quot;.

Other kommandos depended on the job they were assigned to, such as woodcutting kommandos, factory kommandos or kitchen kommandos.

<text>A transition radiation detector (TRD) is a particle detector using the formula_1-dependent threshold of transition radiation in a stratified material. It contains many layers of materials with different indices of refraction. At each interface between materials, the probability of transition radiation increases with the relativistic gamma factor. Thus particles with large formula_1 give off many photons, and small formula_1 give off few. For a given energy, this allows a discrimination between a lighter particle (which has a high formula_1 and therefore radiates) and a heavier particle (which has a low formula_1 and radiates much less).

The passage of the particle is observed through many thin layers of material put in air or gas. The radiated photon gives energy deposition by photoelectric effect, and the signal is detected as ionization. Usually materials with low formula_6 are preferred (formula_7, formula_8) for the radiator, while for photons materials with high formula_6 are used to get a high cross section for photoelectric effect (ex. formula_10). 

TRD detectors are used in ALICE and ATLAS experiment at Large Hadron Collider. The ALICE TRD operates together with a big TPC (Time Projection Chamber) and TOF (Time of Flight counter) to do particle identification in ion collisions. The ATLAS TRD is called TRT (Transition Radiation Tracker) which serves also as a tracker measuring particles&#x27; trajectory simultaneously.</text><links>

<doc id="1343753" wikidata="Q2732820" url="?curid=1343753" title="Government (linguistics)">
<text>In grammar and theoretical linguistics, government or rection refers to the relationship between a word and its dependents. One can discern between at least three concepts of government: the traditional notion of case government, the highly specialized definition of government in some generative models of syntax, and a much broader notion in dependency grammars.

==Traditional case government==

In traditional Latin and Greek (and other) grammars, government is the control by verbs and prepositions of the selection of grammatical features of other words. Most commonly, a verb or preposition is said to &quot;govern&quot; a specific grammatical case if its complement must take that case in a grammatically correct structure (see: case government). For example, in Latin, most transitive verbs require their direct object to appear in the accusative case, while the dative case is reserved for indirect objects. Thus, the phrase &quot;I see you&quot; would be rendered as Te video&quot; in Latin, using the accusative form &quot;te&quot; for the second person pronoun, and &quot;I give a present to you&quot; would be rendered as Tibi donum do&quot;, using both an accusative (&quot;donum&quot;) for the direct and a dative (&quot;tibi&quot;; the dative of the second person pronoun) for the indirect object; the phrase &quot;I help you&quot;, however, would be rendered as Tibi faveo&quot;, using only the dative form &quot;tibi&quot;. The verb &quot;favere&quot; (to help), like many others, is an exception to this default government pattern: its one and only object must be in the dative. Although no direct object in the accusative is controlled by the specific verb, this object is traditionally considered to be an indirect one, mainly because passivization is unavailable except perhaps in an impersonal manner and for certain verbs of this type. A semantic alternation may also be achieved when different case constructions are available with a verb: Id credo&quot; (&quot;id&quot; is an accusative) means &quot;I believe this, I have this opinion&quot; and &quot;Ei credo&quot; (&quot;ei&quot; is a dative) means &quot;I trust this, I confide in this&quot;.

Prepositions (and postpositions and circumpositions, i.e. adpositions) are like verbs in their ability to govern the case of their complement, and like many verbs, many adpositions can govern more than one case, with distinct interpretations. For example &quot;in Italy&quot; would be &quot;in Italia, &quot;Italia&quot; being an ablative case form, but &quot;towards Italy&quot; would be &quot;in Italiam, &quot;Italiam&quot; being an accusative case form.

==In government and binding theory==
The abstract syntactic relation of government in government and binding theory, a phrase structure grammar, is an extension of the traditional notion of case government. Verbs govern their objects, and more generally, heads govern their dependents. &quot;A&quot; governs &quot;B&quot; if and only if:
* &quot;A&quot; is a governor (a lexical head),
* &quot;A&quot; m-commands &quot;B&quot;, and
* no barrier intervenes between &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;.

This definition is explained in more detail in the government section of the article on government and binding theory.

==Government broadly construed==
One sometimes encounters definitions of government that are much broader than the one just produced. Government is understood as the property that regulates which words can or must appear with the referenced word. This broader understanding of government is part of many dependency grammars. The notion is that many individual words in a given sentence can appear only by virtue of the fact that some other word appears in that sentence.

According to this definition, government occurs between any two words connected by a dependency, the dominant word opening slots for subordinate words. The dominant word is the &quot;governor&quot;, and the subordinates are its &quot;governees&quot;. The following dependency tree illustrates governors and governees:

The word &quot;has&quot; governs &quot;Fred&quot; and &quot;ordered&quot;; in other words, &quot;has&quot; is governor over its governees &quot;Fred&quot; and &quot;ordered&quot;. Similarly, &quot;ordered&quot; governs &quot;dish&quot; and &quot;for&quot;, that is, &quot;ordered&quot; is governor over its governees &quot;dish&quot; and &quot;for&quot;; etc. This understanding of government is widespread among dependency grammars.

==Governors vs. heads==
The distinction between the terms &quot;governor&quot; and &quot;head&quot; is a source of confusion, given the definitions of government produced above. Indeed, &quot;governor&quot; and &quot;head&quot; are overlapping concepts. The governor and the head of a given word will often be one and the same other word. The understanding of these concepts becomes difficult, however, when discontinuities are involved. The following example of a &quot;w&quot;-fronting discontinuity from German illustrates the difficulty:

Two of the criteria mentioned above for identifying governors (and governees) are applicable to the interrogative pronoun &quot;wem&quot; &#x27;whom&#x27;. This pronoun receives dative case from the verb &quot;geholfen&quot; &#x27;helped&#x27; (= case government) and it can appear by virtue of the fact that &quot;geholfen&quot; appears (= licensing). Given these observations, one can make a strong argument that &quot;geholfen&quot; is the governor of &quot;wem&quot;, even though the two words are separated from each other by the rest of the sentence. In such constellations, one sometimes distinguishes between &quot;head&quot; and &quot;governor&quot;. So while the governor of &quot;wem&quot; is &quot;geholfen&quot;, the head of &quot;wem&quot; is taken to be the finite verb &quot;denkst&quot; &#x27;think&#x27;. In other words, when a discontinuity occurs, one assumes that the governor and the head (of the relevant word) are distinct, otherwise they are the same word. Exactly how the terms &quot;head&quot; and &quot;governor&quot; are used can depend on the particular theory of syntax that is employed.

<doc id="1343760" wikidata="Q5354610" url="?curid=1343760" title="Elections in American Samoa">
<text>The American Samoan Legislature or Fono has two chambers, the House of Representatives and the Senate, which has a directly elected head of government, the Governor of American Samoa.

The House of Representatives has 21 members, all elected for a two-year term. Fourteen of them are from single-seat districts, six are from dual-seat districts, and one is elected by a public meeting on Swain Island. The Senate has 18 members, elected for a four-year term by and from the chiefs of the islands. The Governor and their deputy, the Lieutenant Governor, are elected to a four-year term with a limit of two terms as governor.

Although individuals can and do affiliate with political parties, elections are held on a non-partisan basis, and candidates run without party labels. The governor and lieutenant governor are elected on a shared ticket.

As a U.S. territory, American Samoa also votes to send a non-voting delegate to the US House of Representatives, from American Samoa&#x27;s at-large congressional district. The official head of state is the President of the United States. While American Samoans can vote in party primaries, they cannot vote in the general presidential election.

==Latest elections==
In 2020, incumbent delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives Amata Coleman Radewagen won re-election to a fourth term with 83.3 percent of the votes.

Also in 2020, Lieutenant Governor Lemanu Peleti Mauga was elected governor, replacing the term-limited Lolo Matalasi Moliga.

In 2018, a referendum seeking to amend the local constitution, and give the legislature the authority to override the governor&#x27;s veto instead of the U.S. Secretary of Interior as happens now, was defeated.

==Reform proposal==
In 2001, Congressman Eni Faleomavaega announced the introduction federal legislation to protect the voting rights of active duty military members whose home of residence is American Samoa. There have also been proposals to grant American Samoa a vote in the United States Congress, but these would likely face similar constitutional questions as proposals to grant the District of Columbia full representation in Congress.

<text>Monino () is an urban locality (a work settlement) in Shchyolkovsky District of Moscow Oblast, Russia, located east of Moscow. Population: 

==History==
Monino was founded in the Muninskaya Wasteland () on August 23, 1792. The name &quot;Monino&quot; or &quot;Munin&quot; can be translated from the Finno-Ugric languages as &quot;My farm&quot;.

It is alleged that the history of the settlement can be traced to a small farm, whose owner was a man of Monin. In 1926, an airfield for heavy aircraft was built, becoming the first to house a heavy bomber brigade. The subsequent history of the village is closely connected with aviation. The status of urban-type settlement was conferred in 1946.

Until 1965, it was part of the Noginsk District.

==Trivia==

The Central Air Force Museum in Monino is one of the world&#x27;s largest aviation museums, and the largest for Russian aircraft. 173 aircraft and 127 aircraft engines are on display, and the museum also features collections of weapons, instruments, uniforms, artwork, and other air-related items. A library containing books, films, and photos is also accessible to visitors. Tours are given by ex-pilots. The museum opened its doors in 1958.

Monino was the former home of the Gagarin Air Force Academy, which closed in 2011 and remains home to the Chernoi air base.

Monino is home to VVA-Podmoskovye, current champions of the Professional Rugby League, Russia&#x27;s national rugby union competition. VVA have won the title eight times, in 1993, 2003, 2004, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010. They were also nine-time winners of the Soviet Championship.

Monino can be reached from the Yaroslavsky Rail Terminal in central Moscow by the suburban &quot;elektrichka&quot; commuter train.

<doc id="1343766" wikidata="Q5354612" url="?curid=1343766" title="Elections in Andorra">
<text>There are two types of elections in Andorra: parliamentary elections and local elections. The 28 members of the General Council of the Valleys (&quot;Consell General de les Valls&quot;) are elected in parliamentary elections for a maximum term of four years. In the local elections, the council members of the seven parishes of Andorra are elected for a four-year term.

Elections in Andorra are regulated since the promulgation of the Nova Reforma in 1867.

==Election system==
The current electoral law was approved in 2014 and replaces the 1993 law.
Only people with Andorran nationality and over 18 years old are eligible to vote and to become a candidate.

===Parliamentary elections===
All 28 seats of the General Council are elected at the same time. Half of the seats are elected in two-member constituencies based on the seven parishes, with a plurality party block voting method. The remaining 14 are elected in a single nationwide constituency by proportional representation with closed lists. Seats are allocated using the largest remainder method with Hare quota.

Voters have two votes: one for the parish seats, and the other for the PR.

Following the election, the Head of Government (Prime Minister) and the Speaker are elected by the members of the parliament.

===Local elections===
The municipal councils (&quot;consells comunals&quot;), which is the legislature of the parish, must have 10, 12, 14 or 16 seats. The number of seats is determined by the municipal council.

The winning party takes one half of the seats. The other half of the seats are allocated with proportional representation using the largest remainder method, with Hare quota (including the winning party). Lists are closed. With this method, the largest party secures an absolute majority.

Following the election, the &quot;cònsol major&quot; (mayor) and &quot;cònsol menor&quot; (deputy mayor) are elected in each parish indirectly by the municipal councillors.

==Latest elections==

=== Parliamentary elections ===

=== Local elections ===

==History and past elections==
In 1866, a social revolution ended with the promulgation of the New Reform (&quot;Nova Reforma&quot;) by the Co-princes of Andorra. This decree changed the way the parliament and local councils were elected. Furthermore, a vote per home was granted.
The introduced election system was a two-round plurality-at-large voting system. This system remained until the approval of the new Constitution and Electoral Law in 1993.

In 1933, universal male suffrage was introduced. Women&#x27;s suffrage was introduced in 1970.

From 1867 until 1979, parliamentary and local elections were held every two years, but only one half of the seats were up for election.
Since 1981, parliamentary elections are held every four years and all members are up for election simultaneously. Same for local elections since 1983.
In 1982, a multi-option referendum was held in order to change the election system. Finally, no option had a majority, and the traditional system remained. An election law was made in 1987, and it included this system.

In 1993, with the adoption of the new Constitution, Andorra ceased to be a feudal country and a new electoral law was made. Parties were also legalised by then. This law combined the proportional and majority systems. The current law is a revision of the 1993 law made in 2014, and the system is the same.

<text>CGI.pm is a large and once widely used Perl module for programming Common Gateway Interface (CGI) web applications, providing a consistent API for receiving and processing user input. There are also functions for producing HTML or XHTML output, but these are now unmaintained and are to be avoided. CGI.pm was a core Perl module but has been removed as of v5.22 of Perl. The module was written by Lincoln Stein and is now maintained by Lee Johnson.

== Examples ==
Here is a simple CGI page, written in Perl using CGI.pm (in object-oriented style):
#!/usr/bin/env perl

use strict;
use warnings;

use CGI;

my $cgi = CGI-&gt;new;

print $cgi-&gt;header(&#x27;text/html&#x27;);

print « &quot;EndOfHTML&quot;;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
 &lt;head&gt;
 &lt;title&gt;A Simple CGI Page&lt;/title&gt;
 &lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot; content=&quot;text/html; charset=iso-8859-1&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;/head&gt;
 &lt;body&gt;
 &lt;h1&gt;A Simple CGI Page&lt;/h1&gt;
 &lt;form method=&quot;post&quot; enctype=&quot;multipart/form-data&quot;&gt;
 Name: &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;name&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 Age: &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;age&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; name=&quot;Submit!&quot; value=&quot;Submit!&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;/form&gt;
 &lt;hr /&gt;
EndOfHTML

if ( my $name = $cgi-&gt;param(&#x27;name&#x27;) ) {
 print &quot;Your name is $name.&lt;br /&gt;&quot;;

if ( my $age = $cgi-&gt;param(&#x27;age&#x27;) ) {
 print &quot;You are $age years old.&quot;;

print &#x27;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&#x27;;
This would print a very simple webform, asking for your name and age, and after having been submitted, redisplaying the form with the name and age displayed below it. This sample makes use of CGI.pm&#x27;s object-oriented abilities; it can also be done by calling functions directly, without the , however the necessary functions must be imported into the namespace of the script that requires access to those functions:
#!perl

use strict;
use warnings;
use CGI qw/ :standard /;

print header(&#x27;text/html&#x27;);

# ... HTML output same as above example

if ( my $name = param(&#x27;name&#x27;) ) {
 print &quot;Your name is $name.&lt;br /&gt;&quot;;

if ( my $age = param(&#x27;age&#x27;) ) {
 print &quot;You are $age years old.&quot;;

print &#x27;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&#x27;;
Note: in many examples , short for query, is used to store a CGI object.

<doc id="1343789" wikidata="Q376965" url="?curid=1343789" title="Dinosaur Cove">
<text>The Dinosaur Cove in Victoria, Australia is a fossil-bearing site in the south-east of the continent where the Otway Ranges meet the sea to the west of Cape Otway, adjacent to Great Otway National Park (&quot;map&quot;). The inaccessible ocean-front cliffs include fossil-bearing strata of the Eumeralla Formation that date back to about 106 million years ago and has provided discoveries important in the research of the natural history of dinosaurs in Australia and the Southern Hemisphere as a whole.

== Geological time-line ==
During the Early Cretaceous the location was a flood plain within a great rift valley that formed as Australia started to separate northward from Antarctica. Sand, mud and silt deposits covered and sometimes preserved the remains of dead animals and plants. As the rift valley sank, the deposits were overlaid by sediment, which turned to rock under pressure. In the last 30 million years the sediments have been uplifted to form the Otway Ranges and Strzelecki Ranges, bringing them near the surface again.

The richest find of petrified dinosaur bones is confined to narrow thin (up to 0.3 m) layers, most likely ancient stream beds serving as repositories of the bones of smaller animals.

=== History of discovery ===
In 1903, geologist William Hamilton Ferguson was mapping the rocky coastal outcrops a few kilometres west of Inverloch and uncovered the first dinosaur fossil ever discovered in Australia. 75 years later, the exploration and excavation of the Dinosaur Cove site was conducted by teams of volunteers overseen by Tom Rich and Patricia Rich. The dinosaur taxa, &quot;Leaellynasaura amicagraphica&quot; and &quot;Timimus hermani&quot;, are named for the children of the Riches&#x27;, Tim and Leaellyn. Heavy mining equipment and dynamite was used to blast away overlying strata to uncover the fossiliferous rock layers in the cliff face.

Over geological time since, the rock was pushed so deep that heat and pressure hardened it much, before it came again to the surface. As a result, a common way to look for fossils in it was to break each lump with a sledgehammer, and after each blow to examine all new broken surfaces for cross-sections of bone. Any pieces that showed bone were sent to the laboratory to extract the bone by careful preparation.

In the 1980s and 90s Dinosaur Cove yielded hypsilophodontid-like dinosaurs as &quot;Leaellynasaura amicagraphica&quot; and &quot;Atlascopcosaurus loadsi,&quot; and a Coelurosaur, as well as fragments of what may be a caenagnathid (relatives of the Oviraptors). One fossil from this diverse taxa, collectively called the &quot;polar dinosaurs of Australia&quot;, has been interpreted as showing possible adaptations to vision in low light conditions and possibly were warm-blooded; this has been suggested as an explanation for how some of these dinosaurs foraged for food during the polar winter months. Although these dinosaurs lived at polar latitudes, the Cretaceous climate was significantly milder than today, so temperatures within the Antarctic and Arctic Circles were vastly different from the climate at these latitudes today because the lopsided arrangements of the continents made sea currents and monsoon winds blow across the polar areas and not around them, and so stopped cold pools from developing around the poles.

<doc id="1343791" wikidata="Q1809292" url="?curid=1343791" title="Lawrence Winters">
<text>Lawrence Winters &quot;(né&quot; Lawrence Lafayette Whisonant; 15 November 1915 King&#x27;s Creek, South Carolina – 24 September 1965 Hamburg, Germany), bass-baritone, was an American opera singer who had an active international career from the mid-1940s through the mid-1960s. He was part of the first generation of black opera singers to achieve wide success and is viewed as part of an instrumental group of performers who helped break down the barriers of racial prejudice in the opera world. He began his opera career at the New York City Opera in 1946 during a time when the NYCO was one of the few American opera companies hiring black artists. He sang a varied repertoire there through 1955, after which his career was largely based in Europe until his death at the age of fifty.

==Biography==
Winters began to study singing privately in Salisbury, North Carolina, before entering Howard University in 1941, where he studied singing with Todd Duncan. In the summer of 1942, he was a soloist with the Naumburg Orchestral Concerts, in the Naumburg Bandshell, Central Park, in the summer series. This would have been the premiere public performance of his career. After graduating from Howard in 1944 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Music, he joined the Eva Jessye Choir. Shortly thereafter he sang the lead role in a concert production of Clarence Cameron White&#x27;s &quot;Ouanga&quot;. Following this he became musical director in the Special Services Division at Fort Huachuca as a member of the U.S. Armed Forces.

After the end of World War II, Winters moved to New York City in 1946 where he was almost immediately engaged for the Broadway musical revue &quot;Call Me Mister&quot;, portraying a variety of smaller roles. His official recital debut followed in 1947 at Town Hall in New York. Then, in 1948, he debuted as an opera singer in the New York City Opera (NYCO) in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Aida&quot; as Amonasro. He portrayed several more roles with the NYCO over the next seven years, including Dessalines in William Grant Still&#x27;s &quot;Troubled Island&quot; (1949), the four villains in Jacques Offenbach&#x27;s &quot;The Tales of Hoffmann&quot; (1949), Escamillo in Georges Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot; (1949), Tchelio in Sergei Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;The Love for Three Oranges&quot; (1950), Tonio in Ruggero Leoncavallo&#x27;s &quot;Pagliacci&quot; (1950), Timur in Giacomo Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Turandot&quot; (1950), Alfio in &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot; (1950), The Messenger in the world premiere of David Tamkin&#x27;s &quot;The Dybbuk&quot; (1951), the title role in Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Rigoletto&quot; (1951), King Balthazar in Gian Carlo Menotti&#x27;s &quot;Amahl and the Night Visitors&quot; (1952), Colline in Puccini&#x27;s &quot;La bohème&quot; (1952), the title role in Béla Bartók&#x27;s &quot;Bluebeard&#x27;s Castle&quot; (1953), Count Almaviva in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; (1954), Joe in &quot;Show Boat&quot; (1954), Germont in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;La Traviata&quot; (1955), and Diomede in the New York premiere of William Walton&#x27;s &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot; (1955) among others.

While working with the NYCO, Winters also toured as a concert artist and performed in operas with companies in Europe. In 1949 he came to Europe for the first time, drawing particular acclaim for a recital given in Berlin. He also gave concert tours in Central America and in the United States Virgin Islands. In 1950 he joined the roster of principal baritones at the Royal Swedish Opera where he sang a number of roles for two seasons. In 1951, he sang the role of Porgy opposite Camilla Williams&#x27;s Bess in the most complete recording of Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; made up to that time. He made his debut with the Hamburg State Opera in 1952 reprising his role in &quot;Aida&quot;, returning there frequently through 1957. He made his first appearance with the New York Philharmonic singing excerpts from operas in concert in 1957.

In 1957 Winters became a principal baritone on the roster at the Deutsche Oper Berlin where he spent most of his time performing in operas through 1961. He also sang in a number of roles with the Vienna State Opera and the San Francisco Opera during these years, including the title role in Carl Orff&#x27;s &quot;Die Kluge&quot;, Amonasro, Fritz Kothner in &quot;Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg&quot;, Tonio, and Wolfram in &quot;Tannhäuser&quot;. In February 1960 he returned to Broadway as Tyree Tucker in Ketti Frings&#x27;s play &quot;The Long Dream&quot;. One of the few non-singing roles he portrayed during his career, Winters garnered a Tony Award nomination for his performance. He returned for one last performance at the NYCO in 1962, portraying the role of Porgy. He returned to the Hamburg State Opera in 1961, working as a principal baritone with the company until his untimely death at the age of 50 in 1965. Winters is buried at the Ohlsdorf Cemetery.

== Family ==
Lawrence Whisonant married Aida C. Bearden (maiden; 1917–2007) on June 9, 1943, in Manhattan. She was a first cousin of artist Romare Bearden, who was the son of journalist and civic activist Bessye J. Bearden. Aida&#x27;s mother was Anna Elizabeth Miller (maiden; 1878–1972). By way of her mother&#x27;s first marriage to the Rev. Primus Priss Alston (1851–1910), Aida was a half-sister of the artist Charles Alston.

<text>IBM Consulting, rebranded in 2021 from IBM Global Business Services, is the professional services and consulting arm of IBM. It provides services to companies, global government organizations, non-profits and NGOs.

It has approximately 160,000 employees globally, with capabilities spanning strategy and management consulting, experience design, technology and systems integration, and operations.

==History==
IBM&#x27;s early involvement in IT services can be traced back to the mid-seventies and its Data Processing Support Services (DPSS) division. At the time, the company was under regulatory pressure to unbundle its support services from the sale of hardware. Additionally, with the launch of its early teleprocessing and database products, such as CICS and IMS, many customers could acquire the expertise needed to build their applications only through hiring consulting services directly from IBM.

Later, in 1989, Eastman Kodak Company and IBM completed an agreement by which IBM designed, built and managed a new state-of-the-art data center for Kodak in Rochester, New York under the brand name ISSC, Integrated Systems Solution Corporation.

Also in 1989, IBM introduced Business Recovery Services, an offering that enables a business to continue operations in the event of an unplanned outage or disaster.

In 1992, the company formed IBM Consulting Group, as a new management consulting organization with service lines in Business Transformation and IT Strategy Consulting. This initiative was led by Robert M. Howe, IBM vice-president and general manager of IBM Consulting Group. The group was rebranded to IBM Business Innovation Services in 2001, and then IBM Business Consulting Services. As the management consulting became more entangled with more technology delivery, the integrated organization became known as IBM Global Business Services.

In 2002, IBM acquired the management consulting and technology services arm of PricewaterhouseCoopers, around the same time some other Big Four accounting firms were selling off their consulting arms (this was in order to avoid conflicts of interest in light of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act). PwC&#x27;s consultancy business was sold to IBM for approximately US$3.9 billion in cash and stock. This nearly doubled the number of consultants within IBM Global Services, adding 30,000 consultants in 52 countries.

In 2016, IBM announced its planned acquisition of Promontory Financial Group in September 2016 and completed the transaction in November 2016.

In October 2021, IBM Global Business Services was renamed IBM Consulting after the spin-off of IBM&#x27;s Global Technology Services division into Kyndryl Holdings. 

==Organizational structure==
IBM Consulting has three main divisions:
* Business Transformation Services
* Cybersecurity Services
* Hybrid Cloud Services

==Acquisitions==
Over the years of its operating, IBM Consulting acquired numerous formerly independent consulting companies:
* PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) Consulting, 2002

<text>Camilla Ella Williams (October 18, 1919 – January 29, 2012) was an American operatic soprano who performed nationally and internationally. After studying with renowned teachers in New York City, she was the first African American to receive a regular contract with a major American opera company, the New York City Opera. She had earlier won honors in vocal competitions and the Marian Anderson Fellowship in 1943–44.

In 1954 she became the first African American to sing a major role with the Vienna State Opera. She later also performed as a soloist with numerous European orchestras. As a concert artist, she toured throughout the United States as well as Asia, Australia and New Zealand. In 1977, she was the first African American appointed as Professor of Voice at Indiana University, where she taught until 1997.

==Early life and education==
On October 18, 1919, Camilla Ella Williams was born in Danville, Virginia, to Fannie Carey Williams, a laundress, and Cornelius Booker Williams, a chauffeur. She was the youngest of four children. Her siblings were Mary, Helen, and Cornelius. Williams grew up in a poor neighborhood with music as an important part of her family. Even her grandfather, Alexander Carey, was a choir leader and singer. Her parents instilled an appreciation for music, church, and education during her childhood. By the age of eight, Camilla enjoyed playing the piano, and singing at school and Danville&#x27;s Calvary Baptist Church.

Williams trained at Virginia State College, now Virginia State University, and received her bachelor&#x27;s degree in music education. After her college education, she left her job as a third grade teacher to study music in Philadelphia with a prestigious voice instructor, Marion Szekely Freschl. To help Williams pay for her new studies, Tossie P. Whiting, former English teacher of hers at Virginia State College, founded the Camilla Williams fund. She earned a Marian Anderson Award in 1943 and 1944, and she continued to receive honors in vocal competitions.

==Career==
Beginning in 1944, Williams performed on the coast-to-coast RCA radio network. In 1946 she was the first African American to receive a regular contract with a major American opera company, making her debut with the New York City Opera in the title role in Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot;. Her performance was hailed by a critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;an instant and pronounced success.&quot; During her time at the New York City Opera, she performed Nedda in Leoncavallo&#x27;s &quot;Pagliacci&quot;, Mimi in Puccini&#x27;s &quot;La bohème,&quot; Marguerite in Gounod&#x27;s &quot;Faust,&quot; Micaela in Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot;, and the title role in Verdi&#x27;s&quot; Aida&quot;.

Williams sang throughout the United States and Europe with various other opera companies. In 1951 she sang Bess in the landmark, first complete recording of Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Porgy and Bess,&quot; alongside bass-baritone Lawrence Winters and conductor Lehman Engel. Though she enjoyed the recording experience, she believed strongly that the work ought to be restaged to better portray contemporary African American life, reflecting her decision to refrain from performing the work on stage.

In 1954 she became the first African American to sing a major role with the Vienna State Opera, and performed her signature role in &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot;. In August 1963, as part of the civil rights March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, she sang &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; at the White House and, when scheduled performer Marian Anderson was delayed trying to get through the gathered throngs, Williams sang the anthem before 250,000 people at the Lincoln Memorial, before Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech.

A noted concert artist, Williams toured throughout the United States, Latin America, in fourteen African countries, as well as numerous countries in Asia: Formosa, South Korea, China, Japan, Laos, South Vietnam, the Philippines, New Zealand and Australia. In addition, she was a soloist with the Royal Philharmonic, BBC Symphony, Berlin Philharmonic, Vienna Symphony, Chicago Symphony, Philadelphia Orchestra and the New York Philharmonic under the direction of Leopold Stokowski. In 1950 she recorded Mahler&#x27;s &quot;Symphony No. 8&quot; with Stokowski and the New York Philharmonic.

During the 1970s, Williams taught voice at many places, including Brooklyn College, Bronx College, Queens College, Talent Unlimited, and Danville Museum of Fine Arts.

Williams was the first African-American Professor of Voice appointed to the voice faculty of what is now known as the Indiana University Jacobs School of Music in 1977. In 1984 she became the first African-American instructor at the Central Conservatory of Music in Beijing, China. In 1997 Camilla Williams became a Professor Emerita of Voice at Indiana University Jacobs School of Music, but continued to teach privately.

==Marriage and family==
In 1950, Williams married Charles T. Beavers, a civil rights lawyer who worked closely with Malcolm X. He died in 1969.

From 2000 to 2011, she lived in companionship with her accompanist Boris Bazala, from Bulgaria.

<text>David Alexander Howell (born 23 June 1975) is an English professional golfer. His career peaked in 2006, when he won the BMW Championship and was ranked in the top 10 of the Official World Golf Ranking for a short time. He played in the Ryder Cup in 2004 and 2006. Howell holds the record for most starts on the European Tour.

==Career==
After training and competing at Broome Manor Golf Club, he became a professional golfer in 1995. He won the 1998 Australian PGA Championship, and the 1999 Dubai Desert Classic. He had no further wins for six years, but his form was nonetheless on a general upwards curve. He was tenth on the European Tour Order of Merit in 2004 and 2005 proved to be even better. In the spring he had back to back second places in The Daily Telegraph Dunlop Masters and the Nissan Irish Open, and in August, won the BMW International Open. By the autumn he reached the top 20 in the world rankings.

In November 2005, he won the inaugural HSBC Champions tournament, the first event of the 2006 European Tour season. The win took him to a career high of number 13 in the Official World Golf Ranking, making him the highest-ranked British player and the second highest-ranked European at that time. In May 2006, he won the BMW Championship and moved into the world top ten for the first time. In June he moved to a new high of ninth. After leading the Order of Merit for most of the 2006 season, he eventually finished in 3rd place; a back injury caused his form to suffer in the latter half of the season and limited his appearances through 2007.

In 2013, Howell had his first European Tour win in seven years at the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship, beating American Peter Uihlein in a playoff. Howell had previously gone 0–4 in European Tour playoffs.

In 2014, Howell became the second youngest player in history to reach 500 appearances on European Tour when he played at the Open de France.

Howell won the Beko Classic, a tournament sanctioned by the PGAs of Europe, by 5 shots after rounds of 70, 69 and 67 at the Montgomerie Maxx Royal in Turkey in 2015.

The season 2017 proved to be Howell&#x27;s most disappointing on tour and, speaking in December, said it had been &#x27;two years of hell&#x27;. His season was ravaged by back and wrist injuries and he made only five halfway cuts from 20 events, the fewest he has ever made in a whole season resulting in his worst ever Order of Merit ranking.

He suffered another injury setback in January 2018 with a shoulder injury forcing him to retire from the BMW South African Open.

At the Nordea Masters in August 2018, Howell became just the tenth player in the European Tour&#x27;s history to reach 600 career appearances.

Howell was a member of the winning European Ryder Cup teams in 2004 and 2006. As a member of the Great Britain &amp; Ireland team in the Seve Trophy he was on the losing side in 2000, but a winner in 2003. He has also represented Europe at the Royal Trophy twice in 2006 and 2013 and has been on the winning side on both occasions. He came from 3 down with 4 to play to win his singles match in 2013 against Kim Hyung-sung as Europe pulled off an impressive fightback.

In 2014, Howell was named as part of a five-man selection panel deciding Europe&#x27;s 2016 Ryder Cup captain. The panel unanimously appointed Darren Clarke to the role.

In January 2017, it was announced that Howell had been voted unanimously to succeed Thomas Bjørn as chairman of the European Tour&#x27;s Tournament Committee.

In August 2022 at the Cazoo Classic, Howell became just the third player, after Sam Torrence and Miguel Ángel Jiménez, to reach 700 career appearances on the European Tour and the youngest to ever do so. He surpassed Jiménez for most European Tour starts at the 2023 Alfred Dunhill Links Championship, Howell&#x27;s 722nd event. Howell ended the 2024 season with 726 European Tour starts.

Howell is represented by Octagon.

He also occasionally works for Sky Sports as a commentator and analyst as well as writing regular columns for The Golf Paper and Worldwide Golf. He is sponsored by Titleist and plays with the Titleist ProV1x ball. He was sponsored by Adams Golf for three years from May 2013 but has since returned to TaylorMade.

<text>Jutlandic, or Jutish (Danish: &quot;jysk&quot;; ), is the western variety of Danish, spoken on the peninsula of Jutland in Denmark.

Generally, Jutlandic can be divided into two different dialects: general or Northern Jutlandic (; further divided into western and eastern) and Southern Jutlandic (). However, the linguistic variation is considerably more complicated and well over 20 separate isoglosses exist throughout Jutland. There are major phonological differences between the dialects, but also very noteworthy morphological, syntactic, and semantic variations.

==Subdialects==
The different subdialects of Jutlandic differ somewhat from each other, and are generally grouped in three main dialects, where two of them are sometimes considered together.
 (South Jutlandic) is often seen as very difficult for other speakers of Danish, even other Jutlandic dialects to understand. Instead of the normal Danish , it has tonal accents like Swedish. Many of the phonemes are also different, including velar fricatives much like in German. It also has the definite article before the noun, as opposed to the standard Danish postclitic article.
 (East Jutlandic) is the closest to the standard of the three Jutlandic dialects, but still differs widely in the pronunciation of vowels and the voiced stops word initially or intervocalically. Some dialects of East Jutlandic also still have three genders, like the majority of Norwegian dialects.

===&quot;Vestjysk&quot;===
 (West Jutlandic) is also well known for this enclitic article as well as a complete lack of gender distinction. Phonetically, it is known for having for the phoneme in all positions, as opposed to only post-vocalically in standard Danish. It also can exhibit in slightly different environments from the standard.

==Phonology==

===Consonants===
Standard Danish phonology contains nasal, aspirated voiceless and devoiced plosives (labial, alveolar, and velar). Four voiceless fricatives () are present, as well as four approximants: . There are also four approximants, including three regular and one lateral: . Below is a table depicting the phonemic inventory of Danish and Jutlandic consonants, with phonemes only seen in the dialects of Jutland () in bold.

The most prevalent phonological process in Jutlandic consonants is lenition, which is the weakening of originally voiceless consonants in either the coda of a syllable or word as well as intervocalically. This process causes voicing as well as the reduction from a stop to a fricative and finally to a sonorant. The final step of lenition is then complete apocope.

This phenomenon can be seen in all its stages in the Jutlandic dialects, although it shows considerably more variability in the alveolars. The bilabials still have the approximant in one dialect, but no null phoneme and the velars have no sonorants, only a voiceless stop and fricative.

The stages of the lenition as well as which dialects they occur in can be seen in the table below. Multiple possibilities for the same stage are shown separated by a semicolon. In Maps 4.0 and 4.2 the spread of the pronunciation of and are shown. The represents the null or zero morpheme in the maps, the and are and respectively and is the devoiced velar stop while stands for the fricative . Vends and Læsø are regions usually belonging to the Northern Jutlandic dialectal region whereas Fjolds is the border region between Germany and Denmark, normally considered part of South Jutlandic ().

e.g. In Southern Jutlandic, Scandinavian post-vocalic &quot;p, k&quot; become word-finally, whereas Standard Danish has &quot;b, g&quot;, e.g. &quot;søge&quot; &#x27;to seek&#x27; = Standard Danish , &quot;tabe&quot; &#x27;lose&#x27; = Standard Danish . In the northern part of Southern Jutland, these sounds are voiced fricatives between vowels, i.e. : e.g. &quot;søger&quot; &#x27;seeks&#x27; = Standard Danish , &quot;taber&quot; &#x27;loses&#x27; = Standard Danish .

===Vowels===

Standard Danish has a large vowel inventory and contrasts length on many vowels. Vowels can also be glottalized where the so-called is present and many change their quality depending on whether or not they are preceded or followed by an (phonetically ).

Jutlandic exhibits many diphthongs not present in standard Danish. The long stressed mid vowels are diphthongised as respectively in central Jutland and the South Schleswig dialect, e.g. = Standard Danish &#x27;leg&#x27;, &#x27;farmer&#x27; = Standard Danish (&lt; &quot;bōndi&quot;).

South Jutlandic has the same vowel quality for these vowels, but exhibits a tonal distinction, which is present in place of the Danish . Northern Jutlandic raises them without diphthongising them to respectively. In Hards, a small area of Mid Western Jutland, the vowels become diphthongised with a glide much like in English, and are pronounced as .

In Northern Jutland, are also diphthongised in two syllable words with a glide. Northern Jutlandic always has the glide present () and North Western Jutlandic tends towards the glide, but it is not present for all speakers. Long and have been raised to and respectively in northern Jutlandic, e.g. &#x27;said&#x27; = Standard Danish , &#x27;go, walk&#x27; = Standard Danish .

Map 2.2 shows the different possible pronunciations for the standard Danish mid, stressed vowels which is further explained in the following table:


Outside of these diphthongs arising from changes in pronunciation from standard Danish long vowels, there are also the following diphthongs: , , , /, / and /. and are both present in Vends, North Western Jutlandic and Mid-Western Jutlandic but only one occurs in Østjysk, South Jutlandic and Southern Jutlandic. There is a tendency towards , but in Mid-Eastern Jutlandic can be found instead. The same sort of alternation is also seen with and . In Mid-Western Jutlandic, Northern Jutlandic and North Western Jutlandic both diphthongs exist. In Mid-Eastern Jutlandic there is an alternation between the two, but each speaker only has one. In Southern Jutlandic and South Jutlandic, only is found. is present as a diphthong in all of Jutland with the exception of the island of Fanø (off of South western Jutland), but has different pronunciations depending on length of the segments. The remaining diphthongs show a distribution based on rounding. In the majority of Jutland the unrounded diphthong is rounded. In South Eastern Jutland the rounded one is unrounded and only in certain parts of Sønderjylland are both diphthongs preserved. Map 2.7 shows the rounding alternation for the front, close diphthong /.

An interesting phenomenon in western South Jutlandic and Mid-Western Jutlandic, North Western Jutlandic as well as Northern Jutlandic is the so-called . The can be seen as a modified that only occurs on high vowels (). These long vowels are shortened and then followed by a , or plosive, or in some cases a spirant. (See Map 2.1) In Vends (Northern Jutlandic) and western South Jutlandic the three pronunciations become: , , and and they have the same pronunciation but followed by a schwa if not in the coda. An area in North Western Jutlandic designated on the map as Him-V has instead , and and in Mid-Western Jutlandic it is similar with the also containing a glide and in all three cases a schwa is inserted if it is not in the coda of the syllable. The rest of North Western Jutlandic along the coast has the schwa as well but a fricative instead of a stop, so the sounds are , , and . In the rest of the Jutlandic dialects the vowel quality is overall the same, with gliding in North Western Jutlandic (Han-V and Han-Ø) on the map and only unrounded front vowels in Djurs dialect.
As mentioned earlier, the is an alternative of the that occurs only with high vowels. In the other mainland Scandinavian languages as well as South Jutlandic, there are two different tonemes which distinguish between words that were originally one or two syllables. Tone 1 is a simple rising then falling tone in most dialects and tone 2 is more complex, e.g. &#x27;house&#x27; = Standard Danish ~ &#x27;houses&#x27; = Standard Danish . In standard Danish as well as Jutlandic, tone 1 is replaced with a nonsegmental glottalization and tone 2 disappears entirely. Glottalization can only occur on vowels or sonorants and only in one or two-syllable words and is realized in transcription as .

However, in two-syllable words the second syllable must be a derivational morpheme as the historical environment of tone 1 was one-syllable words and tone 2 only occurred on two-syllable words. Due to apocope and the morphology, both tones and the can now be found on one- and two-syllable words. There can be multiple segments per word, if the word is a compound, which separates its phonetically from the tonemes of Swedish, Norwegian and South Jutlandic, which can only occur once over the whole word. However, in contrast to the standard Danish , the Jutlandic does not usually occur in monosyllabic words with a sonorant + voiceless consonant. Only Djurs dialect and the city dialect of Aarhus have the in this environment.

As mentioned before, most of north west Jutland does not have a after short high vowels, and instead has the . The is still present on sonorants and mid and low vowels in the proper environment. Western Jutlandic also has a on the vowel in originally two-syllable words with a geminate voiceless consonant such as , , or e.g. &#x27;cats&#x27; = Standard Danish ; &#x27;not&#x27; = Standard Danish .

===Other phonological characteristics===
*Jutlandic also exhibits a strong tendency towards apocope, i.e. skipping the &quot;e&quot; often found in unstressed syllables, which is itself a weakening of an original North Germanic &quot;-i&quot;, &quot;-a&quot; or &quot;-u&quot;, which causes many words to be distinguished based purely on vowel length or the presence of the &quot;stød&quot;. Most unstressed syllables are dropped and in some cases final segments, often {r} e.g. &quot;kaste&quot; &#x27;throw&#x27; = Standard Danish (Swedish ).
*Jutlandic is further known for lacking the diphthong in the first person nominative pronoun . It is pronounced in the majority of Jutland as but in South Jutlandic and North Western Jutlandic as . The difference goes back to different forms in Proto-Norse, namely &quot;ek&quot; and &quot;eka&quot;, both found in early Runic inscriptions. The latter form has a regular breaking of &quot;e&quot; to &quot;ja&quot; before an &quot;a&quot; in the following syllable. The short form, without breaking, is also found in Norwegian, Faroese and Icelandic.
*In Northern Jutlandic &quot;v&quot; is a labiovelar approximant before back vowels (in the northernmost dialects also before front vowels), whereas it is a Labiodental approximant in Standard Danish, e.g. &quot;vaske&quot; &#x27;wash&#x27; = Standard Danish . The same dialects have voiceless variants of &quot;v&quot; and &quot;j&quot; in the initial combinations &quot;hj&quot; and &quot;hv&quot;, e.g. &quot;hvem&quot; &#x27;who&#x27; = Standard Danish , &quot;hjerte&quot; &#x27;heart&#x27; = Standard Danish .
*In most parts of Jutland, &quot;nd&quot; becomes , e.g. &quot;finde&quot; &#x27;find&#x27; = Standard Danish .

== Grammar ==

One of the hallmarks of the Scandinavian languages is the postclitic definite marker. For example: &quot;en mand&quot; &#x27;a man&#x27;, &quot;mand-en&quot; &#x27;the man&#x27;. In standard Danish this postclitic marker is only used when there is no adjective present, but if there is an adjective, a definite article is used instead: &quot;den store mand&quot; &#x27;the big man&#x27;. Further, standard Danish has a two gender system, distinguishing between the neuter (&quot;intetkøn, -et)&quot; and &quot;other&quot; (&quot;fælleskøn, -en&quot;) genders. In Jutland, however, very few dialects match the standard in these two aspects. There are dialects with one, two and three genders, as well as dialects lacking the postclitic definite marker entirely.

=== Gender ===

Originally the Scandinavian languages, like modern German as well as Icelandic, had three genders. These three genders, masculine, feminine, and neuter are still present in many dialects, notably most dialects of Norwegian. However, in all standard versions of the mainland Scandinavian languages, there are only two genders (Norwegian has three genders, but in Bokmål – one of two written standards – feminine nouns may be inflected like the masculine nouns, making it possible to use only two genders). The masculine and feminine fell together, taking the masculine article (or the feminine in Insular Danish), and the neuter stayed separate. Three genders remain in northern Jutland and far in the east, which could potentially be explained through dialect contact with both Norwegian and Swedish dialects which preserve all three genders. The loss of all gender distinction in the west, though, is unique to Jutlandic. Note though that West Jutlandic still has two noun classes, &quot;n&quot;- and &quot;t&quot;-words like standard Danish, they are just not genders. &quot;t&quot;-words in West Jutlandic are limited to mass nouns.

=== Article ===
The definite marker is also not consistent in the Jutlandic dialects. In the west, where only one gender is present, as well as in all of Southern Jutlandic and South Jutlandic, the definite marker is a free morpheme that comes before the noun. It is not, however, the same as the free morpheme found in standard Danish when an adjective precedes a noun. It is phonetically realised as [æ].

There are also small areas in Jutland where predicate adjectives, as well as adjectives in indefinite noun phrases, have gender congruence in the neuter form. In the dialects of South Schleswig, easternmost Djurs and the island of Samsø, adjectives take a -&quot;t&quot; ending which patterns with standard Danish: for example, &#x27;a green glass&#x27; and &#x27;the glass is green&#x27;. In Vends (Northern Jutlandic) there is no congruence on adjectives in indefinite noun phrases, but the -&quot;t&quot; is still present in predicate adjectives. The variability in the examples also reflects differences between number of genders, postclitic versus enclitic article and apocope: ; . In the rest of Jutland, as a result of apocope, the -&quot;t&quot; disappears completely: ; .

===Semantics===
The presence of a separate free morpheme definite marker in the western Jutlandic dialects has come to cause a contrastive semantic meaning difference with the standard Danish dem. Nouns that can be analyzed as mass nouns, as opposed to count nouns can take the article before an adjective. If the noun is, however, meant to be a count noun it uses the standard Danish plural article &quot;dem&quot;. An example of this would be &quot;dem små kartofler&quot; versus &quot;æ små kartofler&quot; &#x27;the small potatoes&#x27;. &quot;Dem små kartofler&quot; refers to the small potatoes in a set, i.e. those 5 small potatoes on the table. &quot;Æ små kartofler&quot; refers instead to a mass noun, meaning potatoes that are generally small. It is like saying &quot;the yellow potatoes&quot; in English. It can either mean yellow potatoes as a whole, a mass noun or the yellow potatoes sitting on the table, as opposed to the red ones.

There is also a tendency to use &quot;hans&quot; or &quot;hendes&quot; instead of the Standard Danish &quot;sin&quot; when referring to the subject of the sentence. This means there is no longer a distinction between whether the possessive pronoun refers to the subject of the sentence or a third person, however, use of a word like &quot;egen/t&quot; &#x27;own&#x27; can paraphrastically accomplish the same thing.

==Sociolinguistics==
Today the old dialects, tied as they were to the rural districts, are yielding to new regional standards based on Standard Danish. Several factors have contributed to this process. The dialects, especially in the northernmost, western and southern regions, are often hard to understand for people originating outside Jutland.

The dialects also enjoy little prestige both nationally (the population of Zealand like to believe that the Jutlanders are slower not only in speech but also in thought) and regionally (the dialect is associated with rural life).

The Danish cultural, media and business life revolves around Copenhagen, and Jutland has only in recent decades seen substantial economic growth. In the 20th century dialects were usually suppressed by media, state institutions, and schools. In recent decades, a more liberal attitude towards dialects has emerged, but since the number of speakers has decreased, and almost all of the remaining dialect speakers master a regional form of Standard Danish as well, dialects are still being ignored.

==Characteristics==
The new Jutlandic &quot;regiolects&quot; differ from the Copenhagen variety primarily by a distinct accent:

# a higher tendency of apocope of unstressed (cf. above).
# a higher pitch towards the end of a stressed syllable.
# a slightly different distribution of &quot;stød&quot;: &quot;vej&quot; &#x27;way&#x27; = Standard Danish ; &quot;hammer&quot; &#x27;hammer&#x27; = Standard Danish .
# the ending &quot;-et&quot; (definite article or passive participle) is pronounced instead of , e.g. &quot;hentet&quot; &#x27;fetched&#x27; = Standard Danish ; &quot;meget&quot; &#x27;very, much&#x27; = Standard Danish 
# postvocalic &quot;d&quot; is pronounced or, before &quot;i&quot;, in certain varieties of the regiolect: &quot;bade&quot; &#x27;bath&#x27; = Standard Danish , &quot;stadig&quot; &#x27;still&#x27; = Standard Danish . These pronunciations are not favored by younger speakers.
# &quot;or&quot; is pronounced in words where Standard Danish has (in closed syllables): &quot;torn&quot; &#x27;thorn&#x27; = Standard Danish . On the other hand, one also hears hypercorrect pronunciations like &quot;tårn&quot; &#x27;tower&#x27; = Standard Danish .
# the strong verbs have &quot;-en&quot; in the past participle not only in adjectival use, as in Standard Danish, but also in the compound perfect: &quot;han har funden&quot; for Standard Danish &quot;han har fundet den&quot;. Such forms belong to the low register of the Jutlandic regiolects.
# a frequent use of &quot;hans, hendes&quot; &#x27;his, her&#x27; instead of the reflexive pronoun &quot;sin&quot; to refer to the subject of the sentence: &quot;han kyssede hans kone&quot; &#x27;he kissed his wife&#x27; for Standard Danish &quot;han kyssede sin kone&quot; (the other sentence would mean that he kissed somebody else&#x27;s wife).
# a lack of distinction between transitive and intransitive forms of certain related verbs like &quot;ligge&quot; ~ &quot;lægge&quot; &#x27;lie, lay&#x27;: &quot;han lagde i sengen&quot; &#x27;he lay in the bed&#x27; for Standard Danish &quot;han lå i sengen&quot; (eastern speakers distinguish neither the present nor the infinitive of the verbs).
# remnants of a regional vocabulary such as &quot;træls&quot; &#x27;annoying&#x27; (for Standard Danish &quot;irriterende&quot; ), &quot;og&quot; &#x27;too&#x27; (for Standard Danish &quot;også&quot; ), &quot;ikke og&quot; or, in higher style, &quot;ikke også&quot; &#x27;isn&#x27;t it&#x27; (for Standard Danish &quot;ikke, ikke sandt&quot; ).

==Peter Skautrup Centre==
The Peter Skautrup Centre for Jutlandic Research is a research centre at Aarhus University and the main centre for Jutlandic dialectology in Denmark. It was established in 1932 (under the name &quot;Institut for Jysk Sprog- og Kulturforskning&quot;), originally privately funded by grants, and headed by professor Peter Skautrup. In 1973 it became part of Aarhus University, and currently it forms part of the Department of Scandinavian Studies and Experience Economy within the School of Communication and Culture.

From 1932 to 1978, the center published the journal &quot;Sprog og Kultur&quot; (&quot;Language and culture&quot;), and from 1982 onwards &quot;Ord &amp; Sag&quot; (&quot;Word and cause&quot;).

The primary work of the center is focused on building the &quot;Jysk Ordbog&quot; (&quot;Jutlandic Dictionary&quot;), based on 3 million index cards collected since the 1930s and approximately 1050 hours of audio recordings of dialects from all parts of Jutland. Since 2000, it has been published online, but is still not completely finished. The center estimates (in 2018) that there is 30 years of work left.

<doc id="1343821" wikidata="Q7037726" url="?curid=1343821" title="Yōga, Tokyo">
<text>is a neighborhood in Setagaya, Tokyo. Its name appears frequently in traffic reports because the junction between the Tōmei Expressway and the elevated Shibuya branch (#3) of the Metropolitan Expressway system is there. There is also a stop, Yōga Station, on the Tōkyū Den-en-toshi line here. There is also a bus services (Tokyu Bus) and possible access to the area with numbers of buses.

Two traffic cameras on top of the SBS tower overlook the junction, the Yōga toll gate, and other parts of the neighborhood.

==History==

In the Edo period, Yōga was a post-town on the Ōyama Kaidō, a road connecting Edo and Ōyama Mountain in Sagami Province.

==Derivation==

The name comes from Sanskrit root of the word &quot;yoga&quot;. The Buddhist temple Shinpuku-ji chose the Sanskrit-derived appellation Yuga-san. The Sanskrit is also the root of the word &quot;yoga&quot; (योग→瑜伽→用賀).

==Culture==

Yōga is home to Kinuta Park, a broad green space established in 1957. The park is located 10 minutes from the Yōga Station and covers . Kinuta Park has sports facilities, including baseball fields, a basketball court, and swimming pools (25m and 50m, also a small pool for kids and diving pool). The Setagaya Art Museum, est. 1986, is located on a corner of Kinuta Park. The museum has a permanent collection with an emphasis on photography, particularly the works of Kineo Kuwabara and Kōji Morooka.

Yōga is noted for its educational institutions, and is home to many primary, junior, and high schools. Perhaps the most significant of them all is Sakuramachi State Primary, which had biggest numbers of pupils in Setagaya-ku back in 1992–93 with more than 600 pupils.

==Neighbourhood==

Around the Yoga station is perhaps the most vibrant area of Yoga. It is a residential area after all and there are numbers of residential friendly facilities including large super markets (OK Store and Fuji supermarket) as well as smaller grocery stores, butcher, off-licence, fish shops, etc.

==Education==
Setagaya Board of Education operates public elementary and junior high schools.

1 and 2-chome are zoned to Sakuramachi Elementary School (桜町小学校). 3 and 4-chome are zoned to Kyosai Elementary School (京西小学校) and Yoga Junior High School (用賀中学校). Different parts of 1 and 2-chome are each zoned to Fukasawa Junior High School (深沢中学校) and Seta Junior High School (瀬田中学校).

<doc id="1343855" wikidata="Q5613380" url="?curid=1343855" title="British National (Overseas)">
<text>British National (Overseas), abbreviated as BN(O), is a class of British nationality associated with the former colony of Hong Kong. The status was acquired through voluntary registration by individuals with a connection to the territory who had been British Dependent Territories citizens (BDTCs) before the handover to China in 1997. Registration for BN(O) status was limited to the 10-year period preceding the transfer as a transitional arrangement for former BDTCs; current residents cannot newly acquire this nationality.

BN(O)s are British nationals and Commonwealth citizens, but not British citizens. They are subject to immigration controls when entering the United Kingdom and do not have automatic right of abode there or in Hong Kong, but all BN(O)s would have had permanent resident status in Hong Kong when they acquired this nationality. Following the Chinese government&#x27;s imposition of controversial national security law on Hong Kong in 2020, the UK has allowed BN(O)s and their dependent family members to apply for a renewable 5-year residence visa since 31 January 2021.

This nationality gives its holders favoured status when they are resident in the United Kingdom, conferring eligibility to vote, obtain citizenship under a simplified process, and serve in public office or government positions. There are an estimated 2.9 million BN(O)s; about 720,000 of them hold valid British passports with this status and enjoy consular protection when travelling abroad. However, the Chinese government does not recognise these passports as valid travel documents and restricts BN(O)s from accessing British consular protection from diplomatic missions located in Hong Kong and mainland China at the same year.

== Background ==
Hong Kong was a British colony from 1842 until its transfer to China in 1997. The territory initially consisted only of Hong Kong Island and was expanded to include Kowloon Peninsula and Stonecutters Island in 1860. All of these areas were ceded in perpetuity to the United Kingdom by the Qing dynasty after the Opium Wars. Britain negotiated a further expansion of the colony to include the New Territories in 1898, which were leased (rather than ceded) from Qing China for a period of 99 years.

As the end of the lease drew closer, Hong Kong&#x27;s future was uncertain. Because most of the territory&#x27;s industry was developed in the New Territories, separating the leased area and returning only that part of the colony to China was economically and logistically infeasible. The colonial government could not grant new land leases in the New Territories past 1997, causing concern among local businesses over the long-term viability of further real estate investment. By the time negotiations began over the future of the colony in the early 1980s, China had since become communist. Local residents were apprehensive about the prospect of being handed over to Chinese rule and overwhelmingly preferred that Hong Kong remain a British territory; contemporary opinion polls show that 85 per cent of residents favoured this option. The British government attempted to negotiate an extension of its administration of Hong Kong past 1997, but pivoted towards ensuring the city&#x27;s stability when it became clear that the Chinese authorities would not allow this.

The two governments agreed on the Sino-British Joint Declaration in 1984. The United Kingdom would transfer the entire territory of Hong Kong at the conclusion of the New Territories lease in 1997 to the People&#x27;s Republic of China, which promised to guarantee the continuation of the region&#x27;s existing economic and political systems for 50 years after the handover. Hong Kong would become a special administrative region governed under Chinese sovereignty with a high level of autonomy in local affairs and its residents were to retain civil liberties such as freedom of speech, assembly, and religion after the transfer.

=== Nationality arrangements for residents ===
Before 1983, all citizens of the British Empire, including Hongkongers, held a common nationality. &quot;Citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies&quot; (CUKCs) had the unrestricted right to enter and live in the UK, although non-white immigration was systemically discouraged. Immigration from the colonies and other Commonwealth countries was gradually restricted by Parliament from 1962 to 1971 amid decolonisation, when British subjects originating from outside of the British Islands first had immigration controls imposed on them when entering the UK. After passage of the British Nationality Act 1981, CUKCs were reclassified into different nationality groups based on their ancestry and birthplace, and the vast majority of British subjects in Hong Kong became British Dependent Territories citizens (BDTCs) with the right of abode only in Hong Kong. Only those reclassified as British citizens held an automatic right to live in the United Kingdom.

The British government issued a memorandum attached to the Joint Declaration that concerned transitional arrangements for the nationality of residents, which included a stipulation that a new nationality would be created for Hongkongers that did not confer right of abode in the United Kingdom. The Hong Kong Act 1985 created the British National (Overseas) status to fulfil this requirement. All BDTCs who did not have a connection with a remaining British Dependent Territory other than Hong Kong lost BDTC status on the day of the transfer in 1997. Ethnic Chinese Hongkongers became Chinese nationals and could only retain British nationality if they had registered as BN(O)s before the handover. Residents who were not ethnically Chinese, had not registered as BN(O)s, and would have been stateless on that date automatically became British Overseas citizens.

=== Debate over full citizenship rights ===
The deprivation of full passports and nationality rights for Hongkongers, and its reinforcement as part of the Joint Declaration, drew criticism for effectively making ethnicity the deciding factor in determining what rights British subjects were entitled to. Hong Kong residents and Legislative Council members, with some supporters in the British Parliament, believed that granting full British citizenship would have been more appropriate for instilling confidence in Hong Kong&#x27;s post-handover future and that residents should have been offered a choice to continue living under British rule. Proponents argued that giving Hongkongers the right of abode as an &quot;insurance policy&quot; to protect against a potential curbing of civil freedoms by communist authorities after the handover would encourage them to stay in the territory and help prevent a mounting brain drain. BDTCs in Gibraltar and the Falkland Islands were already given access to citizenship, and it was noted that asking for the same to be granted to Hong Kong residents was only requesting equal treatment. Legislative Councillors and their supporters in Parliament unfavourably compared these nationality arrangements to the situation in Macau, where residents were allowed to retain Portuguese citizenship and right of abode after that territory&#x27;s transfer to China in 1999.

A considerable number of residents began emigrating to other countries in the 1980s. While the number of annual departures remained steady for most of the decade and only started to increase towards its end, the outflow grew dramatically following the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. The brutality of the Chinese government&#x27;s response against demonstrations for democracy immediately dimmed local optimism in Hong Kong&#x27;s future, indicated by a sudden drop in stock market and property values. The crackdown caused a rush among residents to seek permanent residency or citizenship in other countries. Residents feared an erosion of civil rights, the rule of law, and quality of life after the transition to Chinese rule, suspicions that were only exacerbated by the Tiananmen incident. Over a half million people left Hong Kong during the peak migration period from 1987 to 1996. Skepticism in the Chinese government&#x27;s commitment to Hong Kong&#x27;s future autonomy was further reflected by high demand for BDTC naturalisation. Even though BDTC status would expire after the handover in 1997 and carried no entitlement to UK right of abode, over 54,000 people applied for it on the final registration date in 1996 because the status qualified them to register as BN(O)s.

Despite petitions from Governors David Wilson and Chris Patten asking for full citizenship to be conferred on the colony&#x27;s residents, Parliament ultimately refused to grant all Hongkongers right of abode in the United Kingdom, citing difficulty in absorbing a large number of new citizens and that doing so would contradict the Joint Declaration. Instead, it offered citizenship to only 50,000 qualified residents and their dependents, through the British Nationality Selection Scheme. Because many departing residents were well-educated and held critical positions in medicine, finance, and engineering, the intention of the plan was to convince people within this professional core of Hong Kong&#x27;s economy to remain in the territory after 1997. This limited grant of citizenship, along with the fact that the provision for nationality without UK right of abode was included in a memorandum of the Joint Declaration and not in the treaty text, has been used by proponents of conferring citizenship on BN(O)s to argue that granting it would not be a violation of that agreement. On the other hand, the Chinese government considers even these restricted grants to be a breach of the treaty and specifically disregards the British citizenship of those who obtained it under the BNSS. Legislative Councillors derided the Selection Scheme as a thinly veiled attempt by the British government to absorb only the wealthy and well-educated elite and accused the UK of abandoning the moral responsibility it had for subjects in the colony.

=== Post-handover developments ===
In the immediate years after the territory&#x27;s handover, Chinese oversight of Hong Kong was considered relatively benign and hands-off. Because virtually all BN(O)s are also entitled to Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) passports, the UK-issued passports were redundant for international travel. Some residents sold these documents to people smugglers, who used them to assist illegal mainland Chinese migrants in passing through border control when they entered Western countries. BN(O) passports at the time lacked sufficient anti-forgery measures and these documents were easily altered to match the details of other people. Passports issued since 2001 have been produced with digitised photos and signatures that mitigate counterfeiting issues.

While nearly 545,000 BN(O) passports were issued between 1997 and 2007, the rate of renewals for these documents dropped steadily during the immediate post-handover period. From a peak of 139,000 in 2001, just over 7,600 passports were issued in 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;FOICR 40691/16&quot;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The usage and renewals of BN(O) passports have decreased, potentially influenced by the expansion of visa-free regions offered by HKSAR passports. This trend of decline began to reverse in the mid-2010s amid political unrest following the 2014 Hong Kong protests; about 37,000 BN(O)s renewed their passports in 2016.&lt;ref name=&quot;FOICR 42613/17&quot;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Renewals increased sharply following the start of large-scale anti-government protests in 2019. Over 154,000 passports were issued in that year, nearly doubling the number of valid passports in circulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;FOICR 57241/20&quot;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The upward shift continued through the following year; 315,000 people opted for renewals in 2020.

=== Expanded access to UK citizenship ===
Substantive debate on expanding BN(O) rights was restarted in 2020, when the National People&#x27;s Congress (NPC) bypassed the Legislative Council and directly approved national security legislation for Hong Kong that severely penalises acts of secession and subversion against the state as a response to ongoing anti-government protests. This was done despite an explicit stipulation in the Hong Kong Basic Law stating the territory&#x27;s responsibility for enacting its own legislation in that area. Pro-democracy Legislative Councillors and activists denounced the direct application of national law without local consultation as a fundamental upheaval of the regional legal system, labelling it as the end of territory&#x27;s autonomy and &quot;one country, two systems&quot;. The United Kingdom, along with its EU, Five Eyes, and G7 allies, further condemned the legislation as a severe violation of the Joint Declaration that inherently undermines the system of self-government promised to Hong Kong and the fundamental rights of its residents.

The Home Office initially announced that the existing six-month stay limit on BN(O)s would be extended to renewable periods of 12 months with the right to work. When the national security law came into force, the British government declared a further extension of residence rights; BN(O)s would have leave to remain in the UK with rights to work and study, after 5 years they may apply for settled status. They would then be eligible for full citizenship after holding settled status for 12 months. This was implemented as the eponymously named &quot;British National (Overseas) visa&quot;, a residence permit that BN(O)s and their dependent family members have been able to apply for since 31 January 2021. BN(O)s and their dependents who arrived in the UK before the new immigration route became available were granted &quot;Leave Outside the Rules&quot; at the discretion of the Border Force to remain in the country for up to six months as a temporary measure. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, about 7,000 people had entered the UK under this scheme between July 2020 and January 2021. The BN(O) visa was granted to over 97,000 applicants in 2021; As of 31 August 2022, there were over 133,000 BN(O) visas granted since January 2021.

Countering the expanded access to UK citizenship, the Chinese and Hong Kong governments withdrew their recognition of BN(O) passports as valid travel documents for immigration clearance. The territorial government further requested 14 countries that they stop accepting BN(O) passports for issuing working holiday visas, although the documents remain valid for visa purposes in all of those nations. The NPC again directly legislated for the region in March 2021, approving a rework of local election laws that reduces the number of Legislative Council seats elected by the public and establishes a screening committee to scrutinise the political loyalty of candidates for public office. Since this decision, the UK has considered China to be in a &quot;state of ongoing non-compliance&quot; with the Joint Declaration.

== Acquisition and loss ==


Becoming a British National (Overseas) is no longer possible. Acquisition was not an automatic process and eligible residents had to have applied for the status between 1 July 1987 and the end of the registration period. Registration deadlines were assigned to applicants by their birth year. The last date on which eligible applicants could register was 31 December 1997, if they were born in that year and prior to the transfer of sovereignty. BN(O) nationality cannot be transferred by descent, and the number of living status holders will dwindle until there are none. The status was granted in addition to other British nationality classes; an individual can be both a British citizen and a British National (Overseas).

Applicants were required to be British Dependent Territories citizens who held that status solely by a connection with Hong Kong. Connection in this context generally means having acquired BDTC status by birth or naturalisation in the colony, or by birth to a parent who fulfilled these requirements. While about 3.4 million people acquired BN(O) nationality, 2.5 million non-BDTC residents (virtually all Chinese nationals) were ineligible. Those ineligible who wished to register as BN(O)s were required to have been naturalised as Hong Kong-connected BDTCs by 31 March 1996. Acquiring Hong Kong BDTC status other than by birth was no longer possible after that date.

Unlike other British nationalities, BN(O) holders are uniquely entitled to hold British passports in that status. Every BN(O) was directly issued a British National (Overseas) passport when they first obtained the status, while members of all other nationality classes are first given certificates of registration and do not receive passports automatically. All Hong Kong-connected British Dependent Territories citizens lost BDTC status on 1 July 1997. Individuals who did not acquire Chinese nationality (this generally only applied to those not ethnically Chinese) and would have been stateless at that date automatically became British Overseas citizens.

British National (Overseas) status can be relinquished by a declaration made to the Home Secretary provided that the declarant already possesses or intends to acquire another nationality. Prior to 1 July 1997, deprivation of this nationality was also tied to the loss of British Dependent Territories citizenship. Individuals who successfully registered as British citizens under the British Nationality Selection Scheme automatically lost BDTC status, and consequently also lost BN(O) nationality if they had acquired it. There is no path to restore BN(O) status once lost.

== Rights and privileges ==
British Nationals (Overseas) are exempted from obtaining visas or entry certificates when visiting the United Kingdom for less than six months. They and their dependent family members are eligible to apply for the &quot;British National (Overseas) visa&quot;, an indefinitely renewable residence permit valid for either a period of 30 months or 5 years. BN(O)s under the age of 30 are also eligible for two-year working holiday visas and do not face annual quotas or sponsorship requirements.

BN(O)s are not considered foreign nationals when residing in the UK and are entitled to certain rights as Commonwealth citizens. These include exemption from registration with local police, voting eligibility in UK elections, and the ability to enlist in the British Armed Forces. British Nationals (Overseas) are also eligible to serve in nearly all Civil Service posts (except for those in His Majesty&#x27;s Diplomatic Service and the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office), be granted British honours, receive peerages, and sit in the House of Lords. If given indefinite leave to remain (ILR), they are eligible to stand for election to the House of Commons and local government. About 2.9 million people retain BN(O) nationality, with about 720,000 of them holding valid British passports with the status as of 2025. When travelling in other countries, they may seek British consular protection. BN(O)s (as well as all other British nationals) who are in same-sex relationships may choose to register marriages under UK law at British diplomatic missions in countries where such unions would otherwise be illegal, subject to the approval of local authorities.

BN(O)s may become British citizens by registration, rather than naturalisation, after residing in the United Kingdom for 5 years and possessing ILR for a further 12 months. Registration confers citizenship &quot;otherwise than by descent&quot;, meaning that children born outside of the UK to those successfully registered will be British citizens &quot;by descent&quot;. Becoming a British citizen has no effect on BN(O) status, someone can concurrently possess a British citizen passport and a BN(O) passport. Alternatively, the British citizen passport can be issued upon request with the observation that states the holder&#x27;s right of abode in Hong Kong, and the British National (Overseas) status.

Prior to 1997, BN(O)s in qualified occupational classes were eligible to register as British citizens without UK residence requirements under the British Nationality Selection Scheme at the discretion of the Governor of Hong Kong. Additionally, BN(O)s who are not Chinese nationals and held no foreign nationality on 3 February 1997, who were ordinarily resident in Hong Kong on that date, and who continue to reside there are entitled to register as British citizens. Children born after that date who later became BN(O)s and fulfil the other requirements may also register for citizenship. Whether these applicants receive citizenship &quot;by descent&quot; or otherwise is dependent on how they obtained BDTC status. Remaining BN(O)s who held no other citizenship or nationality on or before 19 March 2009 are entitled to register as British citizens &quot;by descent&quot;. However, if a BN(O) acquires another citizenship or nationality and renounces it after either applicable date before applying to register as a British citizen, that person would not be eligible.

== Restrictions ==
Although British National (Overseas)s may travel using a BN(O) passport, because the status does not entitle its holders to the right of abode in either the United Kingdom or Hong Kong, they may face restrictions when travelling to either place and are not treated identically to British citizens when entering other countries. The Joint Declaration allows continued use of foreign passports as travel documents post-handover, but the Chinese and Hong Kong governments have not allowed BN(O) passports to be used for immigration clearance since 31 January 2021.

=== United Kingdom ===

British Nationals (Overseas) are subject to immigration controls and have neither the right of abode nor an automatic right to work in the United Kingdom. They are ineligible for the Registered Traveller service, which enables expedited clearance through British immigration, despite the eligibility of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region passport holders. BN(O)s are required to pay an immigration health surcharge to access National Health Service benefits when applying for a visa to remain in the UK for longer than six months and do not qualify for most welfare programmes.

=== Hong Kong and China ===
The vast majority of British Nationals (Overseas) are ethnically Chinese and were automatically granted Chinese nationality at the transfer of sovereignty in 1997. Individuals who hold Chinese nationality concurrently with any other nationality, including BN(O) status, are treated solely as Chinese nationals under Chinese nationality law. Consequently, most BN(O)s do not have access to British consular protection while in Hong Kong, Macau, or mainland China. Additionally, BN(O)s who are Chinese nationals must use a Mainland Travel Permit to enter mainland China.

Until 31 January 2021, BN(O)s were able to use their BN(O) passports for immigration clearance in Hong Kong and to seek consular protection from overseas Chinese diplomatic missions. Since that date, the Chinese and Hong Kong governments have prohibited the use of BN(O) passports as travel documents or proof of identity. BN(O)s who do not possess Chinese (or any other) nationality are required to use a Document of Identity for Visa Purposes for travel. This restriction disproportionally affects ease of travel for permanent residents of South Asian ethnicity, who were not granted Chinese nationality in 1997. As an additional consequence, Hongkongers seeking early pre-retirement withdrawals from the Mandatory Provident Fund pension scheme may not use BN(O) passports for identity verification.

BN(O)s are barred from registering same-sex marriages at the British Consulate-General, Hong Kong. Consular same-sex marriages under UK law are contingent on local authority approval, which the Hong Kong government has explicitly denied. Conversely, Chinese authorities have not prohibited these marriages from taking place in mainland China.

Although registration for BN(O) status was dependent on permanent residency, it is possible for holders of this status to lose right of abode in Hong Kong. Non-Chinese nationals who hold permanent residency or citizenship outside of Hong Kong and have not returned to the territory for more than three years at any time since the transfer of sovereignty automatically lose their right of abode. However, these individuals acquire the right to land, which is identical to the right of abode except that these persons can be subject to a deportation order. BN(O)s subject to a deportation order would lose the right to land and would become effectively stateless if their permanent residency in another country were to lapse or expire.

=== European Union ===
Before the United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union on 31 January 2020, full British citizens were European Union citizens.&lt;ref name=&quot;EU2019/592&quot;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; British Nationals (Overseas) have never been EU citizens and did not enjoy freedom of movement in other EU countries. They were, and continue to be, exempted from obtaining visas when visiting the Schengen Area.

Similarly, while full British citizens may continue to exercise freedom of movement in Ireland (part of the Common Travel Area with the UK), BN(O)s do not have this right.

<text>Faust – A German Folktale (German: ) is a 1926 silent fantasy film, produced by Ufa, directed by F. W. Murnau, starring Gösta Ekman as Faust, Emil Jannings as Mephisto, Camilla Horn as Gretchen/Marguerite, Frida Richard as her mother, Wilhelm Dieterle as her brother, and Yvette Guilbert as Marthe Schwerdtlein, her aunt. Murnau&#x27;s film draws on older traditions of the legendary tale of Faust as well as on Goethe&#x27;s classic 1808 version. Ufa wanted Ludwig Berger to direct &quot;Faust&quot;, as Murnau was engaged with &quot;Variety&quot;; Murnau pressured the producer and, backed by Jannings, eventually persuaded Erich Pommer to let him direct the film.

&quot;Faust&quot; was Murnau&#x27;s last German film, and directly afterward he moved to the United States under contract to William Fox to direct &quot;&quot; (1927); when the film premiered in the Ufa-Palast am Zoo in Berlin, Murnau was already shooting in Hollywood. &quot;Faust&quot; has been praised for its special effects and is regarded as an example of German Expressionist film.

==Plot==

The demon Mephisto has a bet with an Archangel that he can corrupt a righteous man&#x27;s soul and destroy in him what is divine. If he succeeds, the Devil will win dominion over earth.

The Devil delivers a plague to the village where Faust, an elderly alchemist, lives. Though he prays to stop the death and starvation, nothing happens. Disheartened, Faust throws his alchemy books in the fire, and then the Bible too. One book opens, showing how to have power and glory by making a pact with the Devil. He goes to a crossroads as described in the book&#x27;s procedure and conjures up the forces of evil. When Mephisto appears at the roadside, he induces Faust to make a trial, 24-hour bargain with the Devil. Faust will have Mephisto&#x27;s service till the sand runs out in an hourglass, at which time the Devil will rescind the pact. At first, Faust uses his new power to help the people of the village, but they shun him when they find out that he cannot face a cross. They stone him and he takes shelter in his home.

Faust then makes a further deal with Mephisto, who gives Faust back his youth and offers him earthly pleasures and a kingdom, in return for his immortal soul. Mephisto tempts Faust with the vision of a beautiful woman. He then takes him to a wedding feast in Parma, to meet the subject of his vision, an Italian Duchess. Faust departs with her, leaving the Devil to kill her groom. Just as Faust is making love to her the sands run out. He is obliged to seal the deal permanently in order to continue his love-making; he is Mephisto&#x27;s forever.

Faust soon grows weary of debauchery and yearns for &quot;home.&quot; Here Faust falls in love with an innocent girl, Gretchen, who is charmed into loving Faust by a golden chain left by the Devil.

Faust comes to Gretchen&#x27;s room. The devil rouses the mother who sees them and drops dead from shock. The devil then incites her soldier brother, Valentin, to run home to catch her lover. Valentin and Faust fight a duel. The Devil intervenes and stabs Valentin in the back. He then goes around town shouting &quot;murder&quot;. Faust and Mephisto flee on the back of a hellish steed.

Valentin condemns Faust for his murder and his sister as a harlot in his dying breath. She is put in the stocks and subjected to jeering. The girl has a child (by Faust) and ends up in the streets. In a blizzard she sees a vision of a warm cradle and lays her child down on the snow, where the child dies of exposure. Soldiers find her and she is sent to the stake as a murderess. Faust sees what is happening and demands Mephisto take him there. Faust arrives just as the fire has been started to burn his lover. Faust wishes he had never asked to have his youth back. Mephisto smashes the mirror with Faust&#x27;s reflection and he loses his youth. He runs through the assembled mob towards Gretchen; and it is as an old man that Faust throws himself onto the fire to be with his beloved.

Gretchen recognizes Faust and sees him in her heart as a young man again as the fire consumes them together. Their spirits rise to the heavens. The angel reveals to Mephisto that he has lost the bet because Love has triumphed over all.

==Production, release history and restoration==

===Production history===
Murnau&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot; was the most technically elaborate and expensive production undertaken by Ufa until it was surpassed by &quot;Metropolis&quot; the following year. Filming took six months, at a cost of (only half was recovered at the box office). According to film historians, &quot;Faust&quot; seriously affected studio shooting and special effects techniques. Murnau uses two cameras, both filming multiple shots; many scenes were filmed time and again. As an example, a short sequence of the contract being written on parchment in fire took an entire day to film.

===Intertitles===
The task of writing the intertitles was originally assigned to , a German novelist and playwright who had moved into screenwriting. He decided to combine various lines from the original folk tale, Christopher Marlowe&#x27;s Doctor Faustus and Goethe&#x27;s Faust, Part 1, as well as providing some of his own. However, his efforts were disliked by the Ufa production team, and Gerhart Hauptmann, one of Germany&#x27;s leading playwrights and winner of the Nobel prize for literature, was engaged instead. Hauptmann agreed to write his own completely new intertitles for , twice what Ufa had offered. Kyser found out, and there was an exchange of vituperative letters between the two writers.

The film received a pre-release showing with Hauptmann&#x27;s intertitles at the Ufa-Pavillon am Nollendorfplatz on 26 August 1926. Unfortunately, Ufa&#x27;s directors felt that Hauptmann&#x27;s titles were even worse: Ufa informed Hauptmann just a week before the premiere of &quot;unexpected difficulties&quot;, and in the end &quot;Faust&quot; opened with Kyser&#x27;s intertitles at the Ufa-Palast am Zoo on 14 October 1926. Hauptmann&#x27;s verses were separately printed as a brochure for sale in cinemas.

===Variant cuts===

There were several versions created of &quot;Faust&quot;, several of them prepared by Murnau himself. The versions are quite different from one another. Some scenes have variants on pace, others have actors with different costumes and some use different camera angles. For example, a scene with a bear was shot with both a person in costume and an actual bear. In some versions, the bear simply stands there. In one version, it actually strikes an actor.

Overall, five versions of &quot;Faust&quot; are known to exist out of the over thirty copies found across the globe: a German original version (of which the only surviving copy is in the Danish Film Institute), a French version, a late German version which exists in two copies, a bilingual version for Europe prepared by Ufa and a version prepared in July, 1926 by Murnau himself, for release in the US market by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.

===Restoration and versions known to exist===
The copy of the original German version lacks a number of scenes. With the copies available, a 106-minute reconstructed version has been released by Kino International with English intertitles on DVD. A commentary is also an optional extra on the DVD. The original intertitles have also been recovered.

The US version includes titles and scenes filmed especially by Murnau, where for example the scene in which Aunt Marthe offers Mephisto a drink that he rejects as causing heartburn: in the US version, Mephisto rejects the drink for having had alcohol, an ironic reference to Prohibition in the United States; again in the US version, Mephisto offers Marta a necklace, from the Great Khan of the Tartars, rather than the cousin from Lombardy, as Murnau believed the US audience would not have heard of Lombardy. One scene was done with a text juxtaposition, as again, Murnau believed the American audience would not grasp the imagery by itself. This is also the only version having the originally conceived finale of the ascension of Faust and Gretchen into Heaven. In all others, the scene is rather more conceptual. Books appearing in the film were labeled or any plans with text were shot twice, in German and in English.

The bilingual version was prepared to be shown aboard trans-Atlantic ships traveling from Hamburg to New York City. Therefore, they catered to both American and German audiences.

The French version is generally believed to represent the poorest choice of scenes, both including the largest number of filming errors (e.g., showing assistants holding doors, actors slipping, Gretchen stepping on her dress, showing the stage maquette). It does hold takes that do not exist in any other versions, however.

==Reception==
&quot;Faust&quot; was a &quot;financial flop&quot;. German critics disliked the adaptation from its source texts and Gösta Ekman&#x27;s performance.

In later years, the film has been called one of seven &quot;canonical examples of German Expressionist cinema&quot;. Film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 94%, based on , with a rating average of 8.59/10.

A 2006 review in &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;one of the most astonishing visual experiences the silent cinema has to offer.&quot; Japanese film director Shinji Aoyama listed &quot;Faust&quot; as one of ten greatest films of all time in 2012. He said, &quot;I always want to remember that movies are made out of the joy of the replica. The fascination of movies is not their realism, but how to enjoy the &quot;real&quot;. In that sense, I always have &quot;Faust&quot; in my mind as I face a movie, make a movie, and talk about a movie.&quot;

==Legacy==
The Readers Library Publishing Company published in 1926 a &quot;Readers Library Film Edition&quot;, an adaptation of the film plot to novel form written by Hayter Preston and Henry Savage.
The &quot;Bald Mountain&quot; scene served as the inspiration for the &quot;Night on Bald Mountain&quot; sequence in Walt Disney&#x27;s 1940 animated film &quot;Fantasia&quot;.

<text>Bethany Theological Seminary is the a seminary of the Church of the Brethren in Richmond, Indiana. It is accredited by the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada and the Higher Learning Commission.

==History==
The seminary was founded in 1905 as Bethany Biblical Seminary by A.C. Wieand and E. B. Hoff. While the two were traveling in the Holy Land overlooking the village of Bethany from the Mount of Olives in 1901–02, they decided to name the new Bible institute Bethany. Bethany moved from Chicago&#x27;s inner city to a new campus in Oak Brook, Il. in 1964. In 1994, the seminary moved from Oak Brook, Illinois, to Richmond, Indiana, to form a partnership with the Earlham School of Religion, a Christian theological school in the Quaker tradition.

==Academics==
Bethany offers students opportunities for a degree in ministry in the form of Master of Divinity and one in research through the Master of Arts degree. Students can further refine their field of study through a degree emphasis in Peace Studies or Ministry With Youth and Young Adults. Peace-related courses cover topics ranging from non-violence and the biblical story, to peace witness in the Anabaptist/Pietist tradition, to mediating conflict in families and churches, to peacemaking in national and international arenas. Master of Divinity students pursuing a degree emphasis in Ministry With Youth and Young Adults complete a practicum experience, and Master of Arts students focus their thesis on youth and young adult ministry.

Bethany emphasizes peace, service, simple living, and the importance of the faith community. Along with the Quakers and Mennonites, the Church of the Brethren is an historic peace church, conscientiously opposed to all war, and intentional about working with peacemaking and reconciliation concerns. Several Bethany professionals and graduates are also associated with a renewed interest in theopoetics.

Students in either the Master of Divinity or Master of Arts programs can enroll as residential or Connections students. Connections is designed for persons who cannot relocate to Richmond, and who can commit to taking a mix of classes online, offsite, and on campus as weekend or two-week intensives. One of the primary locations for off-site Bethany courses is the Susquehanna Valley Ministry Center, on the campus of Elizabethtown College in Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania.

Bethany partners with a wide circle of theological schools to further enhance graduate-level educational opportunities. These schools include Christian Theological Seminary in Indianapolis, IN; Payne Theological Seminary in Yellow Springs, OH; United Theological Seminary in Dayton, OH; and The University of Dayton Graduate School in Dayton, Ohio.

<text>Model-based testing is an application of model-based design for designing and optionally also executing artifacts to perform software testing or system testing. Models can be used to represent the desired behavior of a system under test (SUT), or to represent testing strategies and a test environment. The picture on the right depicts the former approach.

A model describing a SUT is usually an abstract, partial presentation of the SUT&#x27;s desired behavior.
Test cases derived from such a model are functional tests on the same level of abstraction as the model.
These test cases are collectively known as an abstract test suite.
An abstract test suite cannot be directly executed against an SUT because the suite is on the wrong level of abstraction.
An executable test suite needs to be derived from a corresponding abstract test suite.
The executable test suite can communicate directly with the system under test.
This is achieved by mapping the abstract test cases to 
concrete test cases suitable for execution. In some model-based testing environments, models contain enough information to generate executable test suites directly.
In others, elements in the abstract test suite must be mapped to specific statements or method calls in the software to create a concrete test suite. This is called solving the &quot;mapping problem&quot;.
In the case of online testing (see below), abstract test suites exist only conceptually but not as explicit artifacts.

Tests can be derived from models in different ways. Because testing is usually experimental and based on heuristics,
there is no known single best approach for test derivation.
It is common to consolidate all test derivation related parameters into a
package that is often known as &quot;test requirements&quot;, &quot;test purpose&quot; or even &quot;use case(s)&quot;.
This package can contain information about those parts of a model that should be focused on, or the conditions for finishing testing (test stopping criteria).

Because test suites are derived from models and not from source code, model-based testing is usually seen as one form of black-box testing.

Model-based testing for complex software systems is still an evolving field.

==Models==
Especially in Model Driven Engineering or in Object Management Group&#x27;s (OMG&#x27;s) model-driven architecture, models are built before or parallel with the corresponding systems. Models can also be constructed from completed systems. Typical modeling languages for test generation include UML, SysML, mainstream programming languages, finite machine notations, and mathematical formalisms such as Z, B (Event-B), Alloy or Coq.

==Deploying model-based testing==

There are various known ways to deploy model-based testing, which include online testing, offline generation of executable tests, and offline generation of manually deployable tests.

Online testing means that a model-based testing tool connects directly to an SUT and tests it dynamically.

Offline generation of executable tests means that a model-based testing tool generates test cases as computer-readable assets that can be later run automatically; for example, a collection of Python classes that embodies the generated testing logic.

Offline generation of manually deployable tests means that a model-based testing tool generates test cases as human-readable assets that can later assist in manual testing; for instance, a PDF document in a human language describing the generated test steps.

==Deriving tests algorithmically==
The effectiveness of model-based testing is primarily due to the potential for automation it offers. If a model is machine-readable and formal to the extent that it has a well-defined behavioral interpretation, test cases can in principle be derived mechanically.

===From finite-state machines===
Often the model is translated to or interpreted as a finite-state automaton or a state transition system. This automaton represents the possible configurations of the system under test. To find test cases, the automaton is searched for executable paths. A possible execution path can serve as a test case. This method works if the model is deterministic or can be transformed into a deterministic one. Valuable off-nominal test cases may be obtained by leveraging unspecified transitions in these models.

Depending on the complexity of the system under test and the corresponding model the number of paths can be very large, because of the huge amount of possible configurations of the system. To find test cases that can cover an appropriate, but finite, number of paths, test criteria are needed to guide the selection. This technique was first proposed by Offutt and Abdurazik in the paper that started model-based testing. Multiple techniques for test case generation have been developed and are surveyed by Rushby. Test criteria are described in terms of general graphs in the testing textbook.

===Theorem proving===
Theorem proving was originally used for automated proving of logical formulas. For model-based testing approaches, the system is modeled by a set of predicates, specifying the system&#x27;s behavior. To derive test cases, the model is partitioned into equivalence classes over the valid interpretation of the set of the predicates describing the system under test. Each class describes a certain system behavior, and, therefore, can serve as a test case. The simplest partitioning is with the disjunctive normal form approach wherein the logical expressions describing the system&#x27;s behavior are transformed into the disjunctive normal form.

===Constraint logic programming and symbolic execution===
Constraint programming can be used to select test cases satisfying specific constraints by solving a set of constraints over a set of variables. The system is described by the means of constraints. Solving the set of constraints can be done by Boolean solvers (e.g. SAT-solvers based on the Boolean satisfiability problem) or by numerical analysis, like the Gaussian elimination. A solution found by solving the set of constraints formulas can serve as a test cases for the corresponding system.

Constraint programming can be combined with symbolic execution. In this approach a system model is executed symbolically, i.e. collecting data constraints over different control paths, and then using the constraint programming method for solving the constraints and producing test cases.

===Model checking===
Model checkers can also be used for test case generation. Originally model checking was developed as a technique to check if a property of a specification is valid in a model. When used for testing, a model of the system under test, and a property to test is provided to the model checker. Within the procedure of proofing, if this property is valid in the model, the model checker detects witnesses and counterexamples. A witness is a path where the property is satisfied, whereas a counterexample is a path in the execution of the model where the property is violated. These paths can again be used as test cases.

===Test case generation by using a Markov chain test model===
Markov chains are an efficient way to handle Model-based Testing. Test models realized with Markov chains can be understood as a usage model: it is referred to as Usage/Statistical Model Based Testing. Usage models, so Markov chains, are mainly constructed of 2 artifacts : the finite-state machine (FSM) which represents all possible usage scenario of the tested system and the Operational Profiles (OP) which qualify the FSM to represent how the system is or will be used statistically. The first (FSM) helps to know what can be or has been tested and the second (OP) helps to derive operational test cases.
Usage/Statistical Model-based Testing starts from the facts that is not possible to exhaustively test a system and that failure can appear with a very low rate. This approach offers a pragmatic way to statically derive test cases which are focused on improving the reliability of the system under test. Usage/Statistical Model Based Testing was recently extended to be applicable to embedded software systems.

<text>Michael David Rudd (born 15 June 1945) is a New Zealand-born musician and composer who has been based in Australia since the mid 1960s, and who was the leader of Australian progressive rock bands Spectrum and Ariel in the 1970s.

==Biography==
Michael David Rudd was born in Christchurch, New Zealand. His first major group was the Chants R&amp;B. The group came to Australia and settled in Melbourne in 1966, but broke up soon afterwards. Rudd then joined The Party Machine led by Ross Wilson and Ross Hannaford, who later formed Daddy Cool.

After Party Machine split up in late 1969, Rudd formed his own group, Spectrum, one of Australia&#x27;s first progressive rock groups. This also marked the beginning of his long association with bassist Bill Putt. Spectrum released four LPs and several 7&quot; singles, including their national No. 1 hit single &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Gone&quot;, which has remained one of the best-known songs of the period, and the first Australian rock double album, &quot;Milesago&quot;. The group also worked under the pseudonym Indelible Murtceps and recorded one LP under that name.

After Spectrum split in April 1973, Rudd and Putt formed a new group, Ariel. Along with keyboard player John Mills they joined forces with two leading Sydney musicians, guitarist Tim Gaze and drummer Nigel Macara from the progressive band, Tamam Shud. They released one successful LP, &quot;A Strange Fantastic Dream&quot;, in December 1973, but Gaze and Macara left the band soon after it was recorded.

In early 1974, Rudd and Putt began work on an extended concept piece, &quot;The Jellabad Mutant&quot;, and began rehearsing the music with drummer John Lee, ex-The Dingoes. Lee then brought in a friend, lead guitarist Harvey James, and this arrangement eventually coalesced into the second line-up of Ariel. They recorded a full-length demo tape of the planned LP, called &quot;The Jellabad Mutant&quot;, and presented it to their record label EMI, but to their surprise it was rejected.

However, by this time the band had gained some critical praise in the United Kingdom, thanks in part to leading disc jockey John Peel, and this led EMI&#x27;s parent office in London to invite the group to record their next album at Abbey Road Studios. However, the rejection of the &quot;Mutant&quot; album left the band with no new material, and when they arrived in London they discovered that EMI were expecting the line-up that had recorded the first LP. Rudd hastily wrote a number of new songs, but to complete the LP they were forced to fall back on Rudd&#x27;s back-catalogue, recording new versions of several Spectrum/Murtceps songs. The resulting album, &quot;Rock&#x27;n&#x27;Roll Scars&quot;, was mixed by the EMI recording engineer Geoff Emerick, who had worked with The Beatles.

In January 1975, Ariel was expanded to a five-piece with the addition of New Zealand singer-songwriter-guitarist Glyn Mason. This line-up recorded only one single and lasted until early 1976. Lead guitarist Harvey James left to join chart-topping Australian pop band Sherbet in March, (he was replaced by keyboardist Tony Slavich) and drummer John Lee quit to join English band, Dirty Tricks, during Ariel&#x27;s second visit to the UK in April. He was briefly replaced by Nigel Macara, who quit again in October 1976, to be replaced by Iain McLennan.

Ariel continued to record and perform until July 1977, when they announced their break-up; they performed their farewell concert at the Dallas Brooks Hall in Melbourne on 31 August 1977; the show was recorded and later released on two LP&#x27;s: &quot;Aloha&quot;; then &quot;Ariel Live!!-More From Before&quot;.

After Ariel, Rudd moved into promotion and production for a time. He produced the debut album for Newcastle bands Daniel and Jab and demos for Jane Clifton (ex-Melbourne band Stiletto).

Rudd and Putt later formed a succession of groups, in the 1980s — Mike Rudd&#x27;s Instant Replay, Mike Rudd &amp; The Heaters (both also with Tony Slavich) and the more electronically oriented W.H.Y. (Weird Harold and You), a drummer-less trio comprising Rudd, Putt and John Moon and featuring Weird Harold, an early but cantankerous drum-machine—but none achieved the same level of success as Spectrum or Ariel.

Although Rudd was forced to withdraw from performing for several years due to the illness and subsequent death of his wife Helen, Rudd and Putt sustained an enduring musical partnership, including reunions of Spectrum during the 1980s, and a duo album in 1996, &quot;Living on a Volcano&quot;. A new three-piece incarnation of Spectrum, with drummer Peter &#x27;Robbo&#x27; Robertson, debuted in the late 1990s as Spectrum Play The Blues with a CD &quot;Spill&quot;, which took them back to their musical roots. Ariel also reformed for occasional gigs with varying line-ups, including a final reunion of the &#x27;Mark II&#x27; line-up with Harvey James and John Lee, which took place not long before Lee&#x27;s untimely death in July 1998.

Rudd, Putt and Robertson continued to perform and record as Spectrum, with occasional help from keyboardist Daryl Roberts, until Putt&#x27;s death in Strathewen on 7 August 2013, ending an enduring 44 year partnership. Spectrum now continued as Mike Rudd with Broc O&#x27;Connor (bass), Peter &#x27;Robbo&#x27; Robertson (percussion) and Daryl Roberts (keyboards).

Rudd&#x27;s entire back-catalogue was re-released on Spotify and iTunes in August 2015.

<doc id="1343882" wikidata="Q1266704" url="?curid=1343882" title="Durag">
<text>A durag () is a close-fitting cloth tied around the top of the head to protect the hair; similarly a wave cap is a close-fitting cap for the same purpose. Durags may be worn to accelerate the development of long curly/kinky hair, waves or locks in the hair; to maintain natural oils in hair (similar to a bonnet); to stop hair breakage; to manage hair in general; or to keep hair, wave patterns and braids from shifting while sleeping. Durags are also worn as an identity-making fashion choice, popular in Black culture and African-American culture.

== Spelling and etymology ==
Numerous alternative spellings exist for &quot;durag&quot;, including do-rag, dew-rag, and doo-rag, all of which may be spelled with a space instead of a hyphen, or with neither a hyphen nor a space. The simplest etymology for &quot;do-rag&quot; is that it is named as such because it is a &quot;rag&quot; worn to protect one&#x27;s hair&quot;do&quot;. However, one writer in &quot;The New York Times&quot; claims that the correct spelling of the word is &quot;durag&quot;. An alternative etymology claims that name should be spelled &quot;dew-rag&quot;, and &quot;dew&quot; is a euphemism for sweat.

===Early usage===
The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; dates the first published usage of &quot;do-rag&quot; to the 1964 Facing Reality pamphlet &quot;Negro Americans take the Lead&quot;, written by Martin Glaberman. The pamphlet noted that in the wake of the 1963 Detroit Walk to Freedom, &quot;the leading local newspaper announced it would feature a one-a-week column by a prominent local Negro. Trying to be a laborer worthy of his hire, the prominent local figure wrote a column denouncing &#x27;do-rags.&#x27; The common habit of wearing a silk stocking over the head, presumably to protect the setting, aroused his ire.&quot;

Other early published usages include:
* In the August 27, 1965, edition of &quot;LIFE&quot; magazine, a page 22 photo caption describes a man wearing a do-rag&#x27; on his new hair-do&quot;. 
* On June 4, 1966, the &quot;Akron Beacon Journal&quot; printed &quot;do rag ... a cloth band worn around the forehead as a sweatband or to keep hair in place&quot;.
* On September 2, 1966, the &quot;Dayton Daily News&quot; printed &quot;the man with the black dew rag... one with the black bandana&quot;.
* In late 1966, &quot;do rag ... processed hair done up in black rags&quot; appeared in &quot;Newsweek&quot;.

The Merriam-Webster online dictionary places the earliest usage of &quot;do-rag&quot; in 1968.

== History ==
In the 1930s, during the Harlem Renaissance and Great Depression, the durag was used to maintain hairstyles.

During the Black Pride movement of the 1960s and &#x27;70s, durags became a fashion statement. In the 1990s, durags were further popularized by rappers like Jay-Z, Nelly, and 50 Cent. The popularity of rappers such as A$AP Ferg and the waves hairstyle have re-popularized the use of durags.

==In popular culture ==

The 1974 song &quot;Uncle Remus,&quot; cowritten by Frank Zappa and George Duke, includes the lyric, &quot;I can&#x27;t wait till my Fro is full-grown / I&#x27;ll just throw &#x27;way my Doo-Rag at home.&quot;

American singer and bassist Thundercat&#x27;s album &quot;It Is What It Is&quot; features the song entitled &quot;Dragonball Durag&quot;&quot;.&quot; The lyrics references the headwear as the title piece to impress women. The durag referenced has a pattern taken from popular Japanese television cartoon &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;. 
Rapper Royce da 5&#x27;9&quot; has a song on the 2020 album &quot;The Allegory&quot; entitled &quot;Rhinestone Doo Rag&quot;.

Rihanna wore a durag on the cover of the British &quot;Vogue&quot;, which marked a milestone of durags as seen as a fashion symbol.

The character of Leon Black on &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot; is famous for wearing his durag on the show.

In 2021, contestant Symone wore an outfit with a durag, which extended to a train, on the thirteenth season of &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race&quot;.

The rapper Baby Keem, with a feature from Travis Scott, released a single in 2021 with the name &quot;durag activity&quot;.

Kvarforth, frontman of the Swedish depressive suicidal black metal band Shining, is known to wear a durag as part of his onstage look, in contrast to the corpse paint traditionally synonymous with black metal.

== Bans and controversy ==
In 1995, the National Football League (NFL) considered banning players from wearing &quot;bandanas, known as do-rags.&quot; League executive Gene Washington said durags were associated with crime and gang violence but insisted that the idea was &quot;driven largely by black people, not white people.&quot; Safety Merton Hanks said that he wore one because it made his helmet fit better and was therefore akin to safety equipment. Ultimately, the league decided to take no action. In 2001, however, the league owners voted 30–1 to ban players from wearing all headwear under helmets except for &quot;skull caps&quot; in what the league claimed was &quot;a matter of image.&quot; Although there were concerns that the move may have been racially biased, the league again framed the ban as being originated by black members of their competition committee, including Denny Green. Some players argued unsuccessfully that wearing durags under helmets helped them prevent hair loss.

During a preseason game in 2000, the National Basketball Association (NBA) told Indiana Pacers player Sam Perkins that he could not wear a durag because it was &quot;a safety hazard.&quot; In October 2005, the NBA issued a dress code which, among other changes, forbade players from wearing durags not just on the court but while engaged in any manner of team or league business.

Some United States high schools have attempted to ban the wearing of durags. When John Muir High School in Pasadena, California, banned durags as part of a school dress-code policy, the Black Student Union staged a peaceful walk-out in February 2019. Protesting students contended that school administrators banned the headwear because of its affiliation with gang culture, although the principal claimed that durags were banned because &quot;of values we have for how we present ourselves at school&quot;.

<text>Family Groove Company is an unsigned American four piece jam band based out of Chicago, Illinois. FGC tours heavily and as of June 2006, they have played in 28 states totaling over 400 shows.

==History==
Family Groove Company (FGC) started out in January 2001 when Adam Lewis (guitar) and Jordan Wilkow (keyboards) met Janis Wallin (bass) and Mattias Blanck (drums) while studying music at the Musician&#x27;s Institute in Los Angeles, California. It wasn&#x27;t long before they recorded their first demo recording and began performing throughout Southern California. The band began touring quite a bit throughout the Western U.S. with regular appearances in San Diego, San Francisco, and Portland, Oregon. In Spring 2002, the band released their 10-track debut album, &quot;Reachin&#x27;&quot;.

With the number of markets available to the band limited by the vast expanse of the American west, in the fall of 2002, FGC made the decision to relocate to Chicago, Illinois. Since then, the band has pursued an aggressive touring schedule that has included headlining performances, &quot;opening band&quot; exposure opportunities, and high-profile appearances at festivals like Summerfest, the 10,000 Lakes Festival, and Summer Camp Music Festival in Chillicothe, IL.

After playing almost 400 more shows and adding over 50 songs to their playlists since their first release, FGC released their second studio album, &quot;The Charmer&quot;, on April 25, 2006. &quot;The Charmer&quot; was recorded at Studio Chicago, in Chicago, Illinois in December 2005 with overdubs in January and February 2006. All that touring produced numerous songs. In all, fourteen songs made the cut and are on the album.

==The music==
Family Groove Company integrates the groove sensibility developed by James Brown and Herbie Hancock, with the more traditional song structure and consciousness of the hook revolutionized by the Beatles. FGC has avoided the jam band formula of the hip-hop/funk/rock groove combined with endless guitar solos. Their focus has been to supplement their passion for improvisation with an attentiveness to composition. FGC feels that compositional coherence and ingenuity are every bit as important as the &quot;jam&quot; that has come to be the namesake of their genre.

<text>Daniel Alexander Payne Murray (1852–1925) was an American bibliographer, author, politician, and historian. He also worked as an assistant librarian at the Library of Congress.

==Biography==
Murray was born in Baltimore, Maryland, on March 3, 1852 to free parents, George and Eliza Murray. Not much is known about his parents beyond his father being a Methodist preacher and his mother being of Native American descent. As a child, Murray attended both public and private schools, and was taught by prominent African American teachers, such as Alfred Newton Handy and James D. Lynch. He graduated from the Unitarian Seminary in 1869, and went on to study modern languages.

As a young man, he went to work at the United States Senate Restaurant managed by his brother who was also a caterer. He joined the professional staff of the Library of Congress in 1871. He was eighteen years old, and only the second Black American to work for the Library at a time when the Library of Congress. Murray became the full-time personal assistant to the Librarian of Congress, Ainsworth Rand Spofford in 1874.

In 1879, Murray married Anna Evans, a teacher educated at Oberlin College who was the niece of Lewis Sheridan Leary and cousin of John Anthony Copeland Jr., both of whom participated in John Brown&#x27;s raid on Harpers Ferry. The Murrays were very prominent in Washington D.C.&#x27;s civil and social life. They had seven children together.

By 1881, he had risen to become assistant librarian, a position he held for forty-one years. For a brief period in 1897, he was the chief of the periodical division. He was returned to his former post when other employees did not respect him due to his waste. Murray married educator Anna Jane Evans (1858–1955) on April 2, 1879, with whom he had seven children (five lived to adulthood); the couple became a major force in the social and civic life of the District of Columbia.

===Writings on African Americans===
Murray began to compile a collection of books and pamphlets authored by African Americans at the request of Herbert Putnam, the successor to Spofford. The collection of work by &quot;Negro Authors&quot; was to be a part of The Exhibit of American Negroes at the 1900 Paris Exposition. In 1900 Murray published a list of the collections&#x27; holdings to date and appealed for additions to the list through donations. After several months, his list had grown to eleven hundred titles. The Library of Congress&#x27;s &quot;Colored Authors&#x27; Collection&quot; originated from his efforts. Now known as the &quot;Daniel A. P. Murray Pamphlet Collection&quot;, it contains works dating from 1821 by such authors as Frederick Douglass, Booker T. Washington, Ida B. Wells-Barnett, Benjamin W. Arnett, and Alexander Crummell. Murray planned to expand his collection and create an encyclopedia of African-American achievement; unfortunately, the project never received sufficient support to become a reality.

Murray&#x27;s planned encyclopedia was never published, but the smaller pamphlet he composed for the Exhibit at the Paris Exposition was placed in the Library of Congress. This pamphlet, titled, &quot;Preliminary List of Books and Pamphlets by Negro Authors: For Paris Exposition and Library of Congress&quot; became the LOC&#x27;s first bibliography of African American literature.

===African American affairs===
Murray was widely acknowledged as an authority on African-American concerns. He was the first African-American member of the Washington Board of Trade, and he testified before the House of Representatives about Jim Crow laws and the migration of African-Americans from rural locations to urban areas. He was twice a delegate to the Republican National Convention and was a member of many other councils and organizations.

He was also a prolific author, and a frequent contributor to African American journals, in particular &quot;The Voice of the Negro&quot;. He was also well known for his writings on African American history, including his monumental but uncompleted &quot;Historical and Biographical Encyclopedia of the Colored Race&quot;. Murray&#x27;s personal library of African American works was bequeathed to the Library of Congress upon his death March 31, 1925.

<text>Target Games was a Swedish publisher of role-playing games active from 1980 until the year 1999 when they went into bankruptcy proceedings. Until the mid-1990s they published their Swedish roleplaying games under the brand name Äventyrsspel (meaning &quot;adventure games&quot;).

==Publications==
They published much of their early material in the form of stapled books in G5 (169 × 239 mm) format in a box together with dice. Until the mid-1990s Target Games published their Swedish role-playing games under the brand name (meaning &quot;adventure games&quot;).

Äventyrsspel released the role-playing games (1982), (1984) (with the later versions &quot;Mutant&quot; (1989), (1992) and &quot;Mutant Chronicles&quot;, (1991), (1985, a translation of &quot;Chill&quot;), (1986, a translation of &quot;Middle-earth Role Playing&quot;) and (1988, a translation of the WEG &quot;Star Wars&quot; role-playing game). Target Games also published the miniature wargames &quot;Warzone&quot; and &quot;Chronopia&quot;, and several collectible card games including &quot;Doomtrooper&quot;.

They also released three generic sourcebooks, (1987) (translated from the classic game supplement &quot;Grimtooth&#x27;s Traps&quot;), (1988) and (1988) as well as many adventures and sourcebooks for their games. Target Games was reconstructed in 1999 and ceased publication of all of its inventory and the intellectual property rights were transferred to the daughter company Paradox Entertainment, which later became an independent company. Some of the titles have since been licensed to new game companies.

Beside role-playing games, the company had its own store chain named , a trade magazine named , published translated gamebooks (the &quot;Lone Wolf&quot; series among others) as well as publishing family board games (under the Casper trademark) and translated fantasy novels (beginning with a Conan the Barbarian book). Target Games also published at least three computer games (including one game) before reconstruction.

==Original products==

The fantasy role-playing (first edition published in 1982) was &#x27;s best-selling series of games. The first editions were basically a translation into Swedish of Steve Perrin&#x27;s &quot;Basic Role-Playing&quot; (BRP). The various editions of the game all remained fundamentally BRP system games.The earlier editions did not include any campaign setting except for some information about generic fantasy creatures and so on. Over time, different writers created the &quot;Ereb Altor&quot; campaign setting piecemeal in adventures and source books. For the fifth edition, released in 1994, a new setting was created, dubbed &quot;Chronopia&quot;, that had a darker tone.

Today the brand is owned by Swedish company Free League Publishing.

===Mutant===
The name &quot;Mutant&quot; was used for a series of related science fiction themed role-playing games. The 1984 version was set in a post-apocalyptic world similar to the one in &quot;Gamma World&quot;. &quot;Mutant 2&quot; (1986) was an expansion module with more advanced rules. The 1989 version was a cyberpunk game while the later &quot;Mutant RYMD&quot; (1992) and &quot;Mutant Chronicles&quot; (first edition 1993) were science fantasy games set in the Solar System. These versions used variants of the same &quot;Basic Role-Playing&quot; rule system used in .

Later &quot;Mutant&quot; games include (&quot;Heirs to the Apocalypse&quot;) by Järnringen, and by Fria Ligan (who publishes the English-language version of that game, &quot;Mutant – Year Zero&quot;, as Free League).

===Mutant Chronicles===

An offshoot of &quot;Mutant&quot;, as an RPG set in a dystopic future solar system, &quot;Mutant Chronicles&quot; evolved into a brand of its own. The &quot;Mutant Chronicles&quot; brand later became so popular that it spawned multiple spin-offs as well, most notably the &quot;Doomtrooper&quot; collectible card game as well as the &quot;Warzone&quot; miniature wargame.

===Kult===

 is a contemporary horror-themed game that first released in 1991. The setting was inspired by Gnostic philosophy and horror films such as &quot;Hellraiser&quot;. The violent horror themes of the game made it a subject of controversy in Sweden on multiple occasions. This resulted in Swedish toy stores refusing to sell the game.

There were three editions based on the original ruleset published in Swedish, English and more by several companies.

2018 saw a brand-new edition &#x27;&quot;Divinity Lost&quot; by Helmgast, using a version of the &quot;Apocalypse World&quot; engine.

<text>The F-14&#x27;s Central Air Data Computer, also abbreviated as CADC, computes altitude, vertical speed, air speed, and mach number from sensor inputs such as pitot and static pressure and temperature. From 1968 to 1970, the first CADC to use custom digital integrated circuits was developed for the F-14. 

==History==
The CADC was a multi-chip integrated flight control system developed by Garrett AiResearch and used in early versions of the US Navy&#x27;s F-14 Tomcat fighter. It is notable for early use of MOS custom integrated circuits and has been claimed as the first microprocessor chipset. The first commercial microprocessor chip was the contemporary Intel 4004. The 4004 did not have nearly the computing power or interfacing capability required to perform the functions of the CADC. At the time, the best integrated circuit (chip) technology available lacked the scale (number of transistors per chip) necessary to build a single-chip microprocessor for a flight control system.

The CADC was designed and built by a team led by Steve Geller and Ray Holt, and supported by the startup American Microsystems. Design work started in 1968 and was completed in June 1970, beating a number of electromechanical systems that had also been designed for the F-14. It was classified by the Navy until 1998. Ray Holt&#x27;s story of this design and development is presented in his autobiography &quot;The Accidental Engineer&quot;.

In 1971, Holt wrote an article about the system for &quot;Computer Design&quot; magazine. The Navy classified it, and released it in 1998.

==Components==
The CADC consisted of an analog-to-digital converter, several quartz pressure sensors, and a number of MOS-based microchips. Inputs to the system included the primary flight controls, a number of switches, static and dynamic air pressure (for calculating stall points and aircraft speed) and a temperature gauge. The outputs controlled the wing sweep and the maneuver flaps and slats and limited allowable control inputs.

The CADC&#x27;s MP944 chip set ran at 375 kHz, executing 9375 instructions per second and was based on a 20-bit fixed-point-fraction two&#x27;s complement number system. The complete 28-chip system enabled by 74,442 transistors used the following 6 unique dual in-line package (DIP) chips:

The system arranges these chips into 3 modules. Each module consists of a set of ROMs which serially send microinstructions and constants to that module&#x27;s SLU, which routes data inputs to that module&#x27;s computation unit (either a PMU, a PDU, or a SLF), whose results are written into that module&#x27;s RAS and routed via the SLUs to any module. Each module forms its own pipeline and can be used without the others. This made it easy to expand the system with additional modules. Multiple pipelines worked at the same time, a parallel computing technique called &quot;pipeline concurrency&quot;. The ROM stores 128 words of 20-bits each. A register counter in ROM can be reset, step through the words in sequence, accept a retain address command and hold the present address, and accept a numerical input for address modifying or loading.

<text>The Treasure Coast is a region in the southeast of the U.S. state of Florida. It borders the Atlantic Ocean and comprises Indian River, Martin, and St. Lucie counties. The region, whose name refers to the Spanish Treasure Fleet that was lost in a 1715 hurricane, evidently emerged from residents&#x27; desire to distinguish themselves from the Gold Coast to the south (the coast along Palm Beach, Broward, and Miami-Dade counties).

The Treasure Coast area includes parts of two metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) designated by the Office of Management and Budget and used for statistical purposes by the Census Bureau and other agencies: the Port St. Lucie MSA (comprising St. Lucie and Martin counties) and the Sebastian–Vero Beach, Florida MSA (comprising Indian River County).

==History==
The area has long been inhabited, but like other of Florida&#x27;s vernacular regions, a popular identity for the area did not emerge until the area had its initial population boom in the 20th century. It is one of several &quot;coast&quot; regions in Florida, such as the Gold Coast and the First Coast. The term was coined by John J. Schumann Jr. and Harry J. Schultz of the &quot;Vero Beach Press Journal&quot; newspaper shortly after salvagers began recovering Spanish treasure off the coast in 1961. The discovery of treasure from the 1715 Treasure Fleet, lost in a hurricane near the Sebastian Inlet, was of major local importance and brought international attention to the area. &quot;Press Journal&quot; publisher Shumann and editor Schultz noted that there was no name for their area, which was between the well-known Gold Coast to the south (From Palm Beach County to Miami) and the Space Coast to the north (Brevard County). They started referring to their region as the &quot;Treasure Coast&quot; in the newspaper, and this use spread to the community.

==Media==

==Metropolitan areas==

The Treasure Coast includes two metropolitan statistical areas designated by the Office of Management and Budget and used for statistical purposes by the Census Bureau and other agencies. These are:

* The Port St. Lucie, Florida MSA consists of Martin and St. Lucie counties. Port St. Lucie is designated as the principal city. The two-county MSA was first defined in 1983 as the Fort Pierce MSA. In 1993, the MSA was renamed the Fort Pierce-Port St. Lucie MSA. In 2006, Fort Pierce was dropped as a principal city and the name was changed to its present form.
* The Sebastian – Vero Beach, Florida MSA is coextensive with Indian River County. Sebastian and Vero Beach are designated as the principal cities.

== Geography ==

All of the Treasure Coast is shielded from the Atlantic Ocean by narrow sandbars and barrier islands that protect the shallow lagoons, rivers, and bays. Immediately inland, pine and palmetto flatlands are abundant. Numerous lakes and rivers run through the Treasure Coast, notably the Indian River, a part of the Indian River Lagoon system. At certain seasons of the year, bridges may impede the red drift-algal flow, causing a &quot;rotten egg&quot; hydrogen sulfide odor in the area. The Treasure Coast is also bordered by the Atlantic portion of the Intracoastal Waterway, a stretch of closed water from Brownsville, Texas, to Boston, Massachusetts.
==Communities==
Much of the Treasure Coast&#x27;s population is made up of census-designated places (CDPs), with almost all of these in Martin and Indian River counties. Only one city on the Treasure Coast has a population greater than 100,000 inhabitants, which is Port St. Lucie in St. Lucie County. Here is the classification of the places of the Treasure Coast. C for city, T for town, and V for village.

==Transportation infrastructure==
===Airports===
Vero Beach Regional Airport offers commercial passenger service on Breeze Airways. Other commercial airports nearby include Melbourne&#x27;s Melbourne Orlando International Airport to the north (40 miles from Vero Beach), and West Palm Beach&#x27;s Palm Beach International Airport to the south (30 miles from Hobe Sound). Other small regional airports in the area include Treasure Coast International Airport in Fort Pierce, and Witham Field in Stuart.

===Marine transportation===

The Port of Fort Pierce, in Ft. Pierce, located along the Indian River across from the Fort Pierce Inlet, is one of Florida’s 14 deepwater ports and a locally significant port for imports and exports. The Intracoastal Waterway follows the Indian River as it passes through the Treasure Coast. The Okeechobee Waterway connects Stuart with Ft. Myers on the west coast, passing through Lake Okeechobee about halfway along the route.

===Highways===
Despite its large population, the Treasure Coast has only two major north–south highways running through the area: Florida&#x27;s Turnpike (a toll road) and Interstate 95. In the southern half of the Treasure Coast, both routes run generally parallel to each other (twice crossing each other), but are mostly located along the extreme western edges of the cities lining the coast. North of Ft. Pierce, the turnpike leaves the Treasure Coast, heading northwest towards Orlando, leaving 95 as the only north-south highway in the northern half of the area.

Much closer to the coast, U.S. 1 is the only main north–south roadway passing through the cities. Along the western banks of the Indian River, and often on the barrier island for the region (Hutchinson Island and Orchid Island), is Florida State Road A1A.

Beginning in Stuart, Florida State Road 76 runs west out of Stuart, passing Indiantown around halfway through before ending at an intersection with U.S. 98/441 in Port Mayaca. Shortly after leaving Stuart, the road parallels the St. Lucie Canal along its southern edge until both terminate along the eastern shore of Lake Okeechobee.

Florida State Road 70 runs east-west, beginning in Ft. Pierce, passing through Okeechobee before terminating in Bradenton, from Ft. Pierce.

Florida State Road 60 connects Vero Beach in the east with Clearwater to the west, away.

===Railroads===
The Florida East Coast Railway (FEC) operates freight service along the coast throughout the region. It also operates a rail yard just south of downtown Fort Pierce.

U.S. Sugar&#x27;s South Central Florida Express, Inc. (SCXF) leases tracks between Pahokee and Fort Pierce from the FEC, known as the Lake Harbor Branch (K Branch). Along with trackage rights into FEC&#x27;s Fort Pierce Yard, they also have a car haulage arrangement with FEC to Jacksonville to interchange with CSX and Norfolk Southern.

Up until 1963, long-distance passenger trains operated along the route. Among the most notable passenger trains were (main sponsors and destinations) the &quot;East Coast Champion&quot; (Atlantic Coast Line, New York City); &quot;City of Miami&quot; (Illinois Central, Chicago); &quot;Dixie Flyer&quot; (Louisville &amp; Nashville, Chicago); &quot;Florida Special&quot; (winter season only; Florida East Coast Railway, New York City); &quot;Havana Special&quot; (Florida East Coast Railway, New York City); &quot;South Wind&quot; (Louisville &amp; Nashville, Chicago). The Southern Railway&#x27;s &quot;Royal Palm&quot; from Cincinnati ended its service south of Jacksonville, along the Florida East Coast by 1958.

Amtrak and the Florida Department of Transportation had been discussing returning passenger service to the coast. In 2023, Brightline, an inter-city rail route that currently runs between Miami and Orlando, announced that it was looking for sites for a new station on the Treasure Coast. On March 4, 2024, Brightline officially announced that an infill station on the Treasure Coast would be built in Stuart, with service now projected to begin by 2028.

<text>A postulant (from , &quot;to ask&quot;) was originally one who makes a request or demand; hence, a candidate. The use of the term is now generally restricted to those asking for admission into a Christian monastery or a religious order for the period of time preceding their admission into the novitiate. 

The term is most commonly used in the Catholic Church, Lutheran Churches, and the Anglican Communion (which includes the Episcopal Church) to designate those who are seeking ordination to the diaconate or priesthood. In this respect, postulancy is generally considered the first formal step leading to candidacy (for ordination) and ordination. The Eastern Orthodox Church uses this term less frequently.

== Purpose, duration and formation ==

The length of time that a prospective candidate remains a postulant may vary depending on the institution, or the postulant&#x27;s individual situation. Among active religious institutions, it typically lasted 4–6 months. At present, many monasteries have a candidate spend 1–2 years in this stage. In the Catholic church the implementing instruction &quot;Cor orans&quot; determines that a postulancy in a contemplative community has a minimum duration of twelve months but it must not exceed two years. During this time, the postulant generally participates as fully as possible in the life of the community, joining the novices and professed members and living with the community. Usually, the postulant joins the formal education that is given to the novices. Some communities prefer the postulants to wear a specific garb (as this was rather common until the release of &quot;Perfectae Caritatis&quot;, the decree on the adaptation and renewal of religious life, in 1965) in other communities they wear own plain clothes until the formal investiture ceremony.

Since postulants, as novices, are not members of the institution at this stage, it is easier for a man or woman not fully certain about religious life to re-examine his or her intentions and commitment before making any vows. Likewise, should the person be determined to be unsuited to the life, he or she can be dismissed by an institution without the need for a formal procedure.

The term is also sometimes used to describe the ecclesiastical status of a person who has discerned a call to the priesthood or to the diaconate and has received parish and diocesan endorsement. The candidate retains postulant status throughout seminary, until ordination to the transitional diaconate takes place. The postulant who will not pursue ordination into the priesthood is ordained into the vocational diaconate.

== College fraternities ==
In college fraternities, the term &quot;postulant&quot; is also used to describe those who have yet to be initiated into the fraternity, while they are going through the process of becoming a brother or a sister.

<doc id="1343917" wikidata="Q1231708" url="?curid=1343917" title="Old Basing">
<text>Old Basing is a village in Hampshire, England, just east of Basingstoke. It was called &quot;Basengum&quot; in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle and &quot;Basinges&quot; in the Domesday Book.

==Etymology==
The name Basing comes from two Old English components: &quot;Basa&quot;, the name of an Anglo-Saxon tribal leader, and the suffix &quot;-ingas&quot;, meaning &quot;people of&quot;. This origin is shared with Basingstoke, which came from adding the additional component &quot;stoc&quot;, meaning &quot;secondary farm/settlement&quot;, reflecting that Basing was originally the larger settlement. The adjective &quot;Old&quot; was added officially in the latter half of the 20th century (between 1968 and 1986 according to OS maps); a 1911 local history referred to the village as Basing, with Old Basing listed as an alternative name.

== History ==
Old Basing was first settled in the sixth century by a proto-Anglo-Saxon tribe known as the &quot;Basingas&quot;. In the ninth century it was a royal estate and it was the site of the Battle of Basing on or about 22 January 871 AD, when a Viking army defeated King Æthelred of Wessex and his brother, the future King Alfred the Great. It is also mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 AD.

The centre of the village, &quot;The Street&quot;, contains many old houses, and St Mary&#x27;s Church. The River Loddon, whose source is in Worting to the west of Basingstoke, flows through the village. Old Basing is perhaps best known for the ruins of Basing House which was built between 1532 and 1561 on the site of a Norman castle. It was the home of the Marquesses of Winchester for several generations before being destroyed after a 24-week siege during the English Civil War. Many names in modern Old Basing allude to the war, such as &quot;Cavalier Road&quot; and &quot;Musket Copse&quot;, as well as several sites named after Oliver Cromwell including &quot;Oliver&#x27;s Battery and&quot; &quot;Cromwell Cottage.&quot; &quot;Oliver&#x27;s&quot;, a fish and chip takeaway and restaurant is named after Les Oliver who opened the restaurant in 1974.

The route of the former Basingstoke Canal also ran around Basing House and then through and around parts of Old Basing.

In the 1980s, the Lychpit estate was developed to the north of the village, within the boundaries of the civil parish. In 2006, the name of the civil parish was changed to &quot;Old Basing and Lychpit&quot;.

==Governance==
The village of Old Basing is part of the civil parish of Old Basing and Lychpit which in turn is part of the Basing ward of Basingstoke and Deane borough council. The borough council is a Non-metropolitan district of Hampshire County Council.

The Basing ward elects three councillors to Basingstoke and Deane Borough Council and is part of the Basingstoke constituency in elections to Parliament. The current Member of Parliament for Basingstoke is Luke Murphy (Labour) and the current councillors are Onnalee Cubitt (Independent), Stephen Marks (Conservative) and Sven Godesen (Conservative).
== Education ==
Old Basing provides both an infant school and a junior school. The junior school, named St Mary&#x27;s, is aided by the Church of England. A new primary school has recently opened in nearby Lychpit. There are a variety of secondary schools in the Basingstoke area.

== Sport ==
Basing Royals F.C., founded in 2018, is the local football team. The club plays their home games at Royals Park which is part of the wider Basingstoke Common and is situated next to the Old Basing British Legion. The Recreation Ground in Old Basing is used for a variety of sporting events as well as the Old Basing Carnival. There are football pitches which overlap a cricket ground in addition to five tennis courts, an archery area and a lawn bowling green.

== Literature ==
Edward Lear makes reference to Old Basing in his &quot;Book of Nonsense&quot;:

&quot;There was an Old Person of Basing,&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Whose presence of mind was amazing;&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;He purchased a steed,&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Which he rode at full speed,&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;And escaped from the people of Basing.&quot;

<text>Ralph Hartzler Fox (March 24, 1913 – December 23, 1973) was an American mathematician. As a professor at Princeton University, he taught and advised many of the contributors to the &quot;Golden Age of differential topology&quot;, and he played an important role in the modernization of knot theory and of bringing it into the mainstream.

==Biography==

Ralph Fox attended Swarthmore College for two years, while studying piano at the Leefson Conservatory of Music in Philadelphia. He earned a master&#x27;s degree from Johns Hopkins University, and a PhD degree from Princeton University in 1939. His doctoral dissertation, &quot;On the Lusternick–Schnirelmann Category&quot;, was directed by Solomon Lefschetz. (In later years he disclaimed all knowledge of the Lusternik–Schnirelmann category, and certainly never published on the subject again.) He directed 21 doctoral dissertations, including those of John Milnor, John Stallings, Francisco González-Acuña, Guillermo Torres-Diaz and Barry Mazur, and supervised Ken Perko&#x27;s undergraduate thesis.

He was an Invited Speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians held in 1950 in Cambridge, Massachusetts. His mathematical contributions include Fox &quot;n&quot;-coloring of knots, the Fox–Artin arc, and the free differential calculus. He also identified the compact-open topology on function spaces as being particularly appropriate for homotopy theory.

Aside from his strictly mathematical contributions, he was responsible for introducing several basic phrases to knot theory: the phrases &quot;slice knot&quot;, &quot;ribbon knot&quot;, and &quot;Seifert circle&quot; all appear in print for the first time under his name, and he also popularized (if he did not introduce) the phrase &quot;Seifert surface&quot;.

He popularized the playing of the game of Go at both Princeton and the Institute for Advanced Study.

<text>Maurício Oscar da Rocha e Silva (19 September 1910, Rio de Janeiro – 19 December 1983, Ribeirão Preto, Brazil) was a Brazilian physician, biomedical scientist and pharmacologist. He discovered bradykinin, an endogenous polypeptide involved in the physiology, pharmacology and pathology of blood pressure control and many other phenomena related to the contraction of smooth muscles.

==Life==

Rocha e Silva was the son of a psychiatrist, João Olavo da Rocha e Silva. He studied at the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Brazil (later Federal University of Rio de Janeiro), lecturing in high schools while he was a student in order to support himself. Shortly after graduation he moved in 1937 to São Paulo, and was hired by the Biological Institute, a state research institution. From 1940 to 1941, Rocha e Silva won a fellowship from the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation to go to London, England, where he studied and worked with Heinz Schild at the University College London. In 1942 he returned to the Biological Institute and continued his research line on the role of histamine in the effects of animal venoms. At the Institute, he was soon appointed as the chairman of the Section of Biochemistry and Pharmacodynamics, a position he held until 1957. In that year, Rocha e Silva was invited to be the chairman of the Department of Pharmacology of the recently created Faculty of Medicine of Ribeirão Preto of the University of São Paulo, in the city of Ribeirão Preto, state of São Paulo, a position he held until his mandatory retirement in 1980. His health condition worsened shortly thereafter, and he died on 19 December 1983, at the age of 73.

Rocha e Silva was one of the greatest scientific and academic leaders of recent history in Brazil. In 1948, with a group of fellow scientists, such as José Reis, Paulo Sawaya and Gastão Rosenfeld, he founded the Sociedade Brasileira para o Progresso da Ciência (SBPC – Brazilian Society of the Advancement of Science), similar in scope and philosophy to its British and American (AAAS) counterparts. He was to become three times president of SBPC and its lifetime honorary president. Rocha e Silva was also a founding member of the Brazilian Society of Physiology, in 1957; and of the Brazilian Society of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, in 1966 (to which he served as president from 1966 to 1981). In 1967 he won the &quot;Moinho Santista Award&quot; (the highest scientific decoration at the time in Brazil) as well as the National Award of Science and Technology from the National Research Council (CNPq). He was also a vice-president of the International Union of Pharmacology.

==Work==
Together with colleagues Wilson Teixeira Beraldo and Gastão Rosenfeld, Rocha e Silva discovered in 1948 the powerful hypotensive effects of bradykinin in animal preparations. Bradykinin was detected in the plasma of animals after the addition of venom of &quot;Bothrops jararaca&quot; (Brazilian lancehead snake), which was brought by Rosenfeld from the Butantan Institute, in São Paulo, Brazil. This discovery was part of a continuing study on circulatory shock and proteolytic enzymes related to the toxicology of snake bites, started by Rocha e Silva as early as 1939. Bradykinin was to be proved a new autopharmacological principle, i.e., a substance that is released in the body by a metabolic modification from precursors, which are pharmacologically active. According to B.J. Hagwood, Rocha e Silva&#x27;s biographer, &quot;The discovery of bradykinin has led to a new understanding of many physiological and pathological phenomena including circulatory shock induced by venoms and toxins.&quot;

The practical importance of the discovery of bradykinin became apparent when one of his collaborators at Ribeirão Preto, Sérgio Henrique Ferreira, discovered a bradykinin potentiating factor (BPF) in the bothropic venom which increases powerfully both the duration and magnitude of its effects on vasodilation and the consequent fall in blood pressure. On the basis of this finding, Squibb scientists developed the first of a new generation of highly-effective anti-hypertensive drugs, the so-called ACE inhibitors, such as captopril (trademarked Capoten), which have been saving many lives since.

Rocha e Silva had many interests besides scientific research and pharmacology. He was an accomplished amateur painter and a writer of fiction and non-fiction. He was interested in the public understanding of science, and wrote articles and books to the general public. He was also one of the founders of &quot;Ciência e Cultura&quot;, the science magazine of the Brazilian Society for the Advancement of Science (SBPC).

<doc id="1343920" wikidata="Q2603430" url="?curid=1343920" title="Bart on the Road">
<text>&quot;Bart on the Road&quot; is the twentieth episode of the seventh season of the American animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 31, 1996. In the episode, Bart makes his own fake driver&#x27;s license and takes Milhouse, Martin, and Nelson on a road trip that goes awry, and Lisa has to help them get back home after they become stranded far away from Springfield.

The episode was written by Richard Appel, and directed by Swinton O. Scott III. The idea of a road trip was &quot;so exciting&quot; that the writers immediately knew they wanted to write it. The episode features cultural references to the 1991 film &quot;Naked Lunch&quot;, American singer Andy Williams, and &quot;Look&quot; magazine.

Since airing, the episode has received positive reviews from television critics; &quot;Central Michigan Life&quot; named it the eighth-best episode of the series. It acquired a Nielsen rating of 7.2, and was the fifth-highest-rated show on the Fox network the week it aired.

==Plot==
After encountering administrative errors that will require him to begin his vacation one day earlier than expected, Principal Skinner abruptly changes the final day of the school semester to be a &quot;go to work with your parents day&quot; so he can close the school early. Lisa goes to the nuclear power plant with Homer, while Bart, after finding out he isn&#x27;t allowed to just stay at home and watch Marge do housework, instead goes with Patty and Selma to the Department of Motor Vehicles. Bart makes himself a fake driver&#x27;s license while at the DMV, and later uses it to rent a car and arrange a road trip with Nelson, Milhouse and Martin, paid for with money that Martin&#x27;s father helped him earn on the futures market.

The boys soon hit the road after each giving their parents an alibi concocted by Bart. At first, they travel aimlessly for a while and frivolously spend Martin&#x27;s money at multiple stops, before deciding to travel to the World&#x27;s Fair in Knoxville, Tennessee. It&#x27;s only upon arriving at World&#x27;s Fair Park that they realise the Fair ended fourteen years prior, and instead spend the last of Martin&#x27;s money on mediocre souvenirs. Nelson&#x27;s frustration boils over and he winds up accidentally toppling the Sunsphere, which in turn crushes the boys&#x27; rental car and leaves them stranded in Knoxville.

Bart places a collect call to Lisa, who has so far spent her entire spring break at the power plant with Homer, and asks her to help him return home while concealing the ordeal from their parents. On her advice, Bart becomes a courier, but he fails to earn enough money to get home and none of his assignments get him anywhere near Springfield (his first involving flying organ transplants to Hong Kong), so he again asks Lisa for help. After making Homer promise he will not get upset, Lisa reveals Bart&#x27;s predicament and asks Homer to help bring Bart home. Homer then deliberately destroys his workstation so that he can order a replacement unit from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and have it shipped via nearby Knoxville, with Bart as the courier and the other boys stowing away inside the shipment crate.

With Bart safely back in Springfield, Lisa and Homer quietly fume at him at the dinner table. However, Marge remains clueless about Bart&#x27;s misadventures, despite later receiving multiple confusing phone calls from Principal Skinner (who witnessed Bart in Hong Kong), the Tennessee State Police, and the courier service that Bart worked for.

==Production==

The episode was written by Richard Appel, who wanted to do an episode that had two things; a &quot;go to work with your parents day&quot; and Bart getting a driver&#x27;s license. The &quot;go to work with your parents day&quot; idea appealed to Appel because it was something he &quot;lost the right&quot; to do when he went from public school to private school as a child. Appel considered those days to be his favorites because he &quot;didn&#x27;t have to do anything&quot; at his parents&#x27; job. The idea of having a driver&#x27;s license was something that Appel dreamed about when he was younger.

The writing staff had never done a spring break episode before so they thought, &quot;What would Lisa and Bart do on spring break?&quot; and came up with the road trip plot. Bill Oakley, the show runner of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; at the time, said that road trips were something that the writers liked to write stories about. The idea of four children going on a road trip was &quot;so exciting&quot; that they immediately knew they wanted to write it. There was a debate over where the children would go, and Fort Lauderdale, Florida, was first suggested, but the writers eventually decided to have them go to a &quot;funny unlikely place&quot;. Oakley&#x27;s show runner partner, Josh Weinstein, said that the writers were always looking for combinations of characters that had not been done many times on the show. Homer and Lisa had not been done &quot;too often&quot; and they wanted the two characters to bond and get closer to each other.

The episode was directed by Swinton O. Scott III. It was difficult to animate because the animators had to draw completely new designs for the locations outside of Springfield, such as Knoxville. The car scenes were also difficult to animate. At the time, &quot;The Simpsons&quot; was using traditional animation without computers, but they had to get one for a scene where the camera spins around the car from above. The car was difficult to animate because it had to &quot;look real&quot; and not &quot;boxy like a truck&quot;. The car was based on a 1993 Oldsmobile car with rounded edges. &quot;The Simpsons&quot; animator David Silverman said that the episode was &quot;probably the most difficult one&quot; Scott had to direct on the show.

==Cultural references==
During his visit to the cracker factory as part of the &quot;go to work with your parents day&quot;, Milhouse and his father slide down poles like Batman and Robin in the 1960s &quot;Batman&quot; TV series. Bart and his friends use Bart&#x27;s fake license to see the R-rated 1991 film &quot;Naked Lunch&quot;, an adaptation of William Burroughs&#x27;s novel dealing with heroin addiction, homosexuality, and hallucinogens. While leaving the theater after viewing the film, Nelson Muntz remarks, &quot;I can think of at least two things wrong with that title&quot;. The boys also see an Andy Williams concert in Branson, Missouri, and the marquee advertising it outside reads &quot;Wow, he&#x27;s still got it – &quot;Look&quot; magazine&quot;, with &quot;Look&quot; having been out of business for 25 years when the episode first aired. On the road, the boys pick up a hitchhiker, who is based on the hitchhiker in the &quot;Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot; horror film series. Principal Skinner books a vacation with AmeriWestica, a parody of America West Airlines. &quot;Radar Love&quot; by Dutch rock band Golden Earring is also heard.

==Reception==
In its original broadcast, &quot;Bart on the Road&quot; finished 63rd in the ratings for the week of March 25 to March 31, 1996, with a Nielsen rating of 7.2. The episode was the fifth-highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following &quot;The X-Files&quot;, &quot;Cops&quot;, &quot;Party of Five&quot;, &quot;Martin&quot;, and &quot;Melrose Place&quot;.

Since airing, the episode has received positive reviews from television critics. The authors of the book &quot;I Can&#x27;t Believe It&#x27;s a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide&quot;, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, said that it &quot;contains some superb touching character scenes between Homer and Lisa, a fascinating glimpse of Marge&#x27;s insecurities, and some nice touches that take it above the show&#x27;s very high average.&quot;

Dave Foster of DVD Times said that &quot;Bart on the Road&quot; is an episode which is built upon a &quot;frankly ludicrous&quot; idea which if the writers were to &quot;stumble upon&quot; now, &quot;we&#x27;d simply see Bart happen upon a license and skip town without anyone noticing, but here they do give the setup a great deal of consideration both on and off the screen.&quot; He thought the story was &quot;partly believable, though the opportunity when Bart hits the road is largely wasted with only a few well-constructed jokes to speak of.&quot; Foster thinks, &quot;what saves the episode is the opportunity to see Lisa and Homer connect, once again displaying what a strong season this is for Lisa as we see the two share some wonderfully tender moments, alongside some genuinely laugh-out-loud moments.&quot;

DVD Movie Guide&#x27;s Colin Jacobson enjoyed the episode and said that he &quot;loves&quot; the children&#x27;s experiences at their parents&#x27; jobs, adding, &quot;and when they head out of town, the fun continues. Any episode that sends the kids to the site of the World&#x27;s Fair is OK by me.&quot;

Jennifer Malkowski of DVD Verdict considered the best part of the episode to be when Patty and Selma explain their job at the DMV: &quot;Somedays we don&#x27;t let the line move at all. We call those weekdays.&quot; Malkowski concluded her review by giving the episode a grade of B+. John Thorpe of &quot;Central Michigan Life&quot; named it the eighth-best episode of the series. Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode a score of 9.5 out of 10, calling it &quot;outstanding&quot; and summarizing his review with: &quot;&#x27;Bart on the Road&#x27; is a fun trip and very funny, but it&#x27;s the way everything comes together that really makes it memorable.&quot;

<text>The London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) introduced a number of railcars to service between 1933 and 1939. Most were single units but one was a three-car articulated set. 

==Leyland Single units==

The LMS bought three four-wheeled diesel railcars from Leyland Motors in 1933. These were allocated to LMS diagram D2132, although this may have been after they were delivered, and may have been required when modifications were made. They were numbered 29950–29952 in the multiple unit section of the LMS carriage number series. Each had 40 third class seats arranged 2+2 either side of a central gangway and were powered by a diesel engine. After trials between and they worked from to and and subsequently at in Lanarkshire. They passed to British Railways when the LMS was nationalised. BR withdrew them in 1951, so they never received TOPS classification.
==Articulated unit==
In 1937, the LMS decided to produce a more modern diesel train for itself. This was a three-car articulated railcar built to LMS diagram D1996 and outshopped from Derby Carriage and Wagon Works in 1939. The cars were numbered 80000, 80001 and 80002.

The streamlined three-car train was a single articulated unit; the two outer coaches were each long and rested on a centre coach that was long. The articulation was an idea that had been already taken up by Sir William Stanier for some locomotive hauled stock.

Mechanically, the train was a development of railcars that had entered service from 1933 on the LMS Northern Counties Committee&#x27;s (NCC) lines in Northern Ireland, using an identical arrangement of in-line powertrain as NCC railcars Nos. 2–4. Under each coach were two vertically mounted Leyland diesel engines driving the inner axle of each bogie through a Lysholm-Smith torque converter. There were six engines for the three-car set which gave a total power of . The whole unit weighed 73 long tons, so this yielded a power/weight ratio of slightly more than 10 bhp/ton which provided a main line standard of performance with a maximum speed of .

Accommodation in the end cars was split into two saloons with 26 seats in the outer saloon plus a lavatory, and 28 seats in the inner saloon, all seats being reversible and third class. Between the outer saloon and the driving cab was a small luggage and brake compartment. The centre car was a composite with a 30-seat third class saloon with a lavatory, and the other saloon having 24 first-class seats. All of the seats were arranged as 2+2. The cab was generously proportioned with the driver in a central position.

It entered revenue-earning service in 1939 based at Bedford, and worked first on the Varsity Line between and , and then on – services. 

A second unit may have been intended, and the diagram was marked that two units should be constructed although the order was for the one unit that was actually built. 80000–80001–80002 was withdrawn on the outbreak of World War II in 1939, stored, and never re-entered passenger service.

===Conversion for Overhead line maintenance===
In 1949, British Railways converted the articulated unit to a two-car set for overhead line maintenance. The centre car was removed and the number of engines in the set reduced to two. The driving cabs were given flat ends. To enable engineering staff to work on the overhead cables the roofs of the two coaches were flattened, creating a work space long and wide. Between the two cars a manually-operated lift was installed that could be raised to above roof level.

One coach was converted into a workshop with all passenger seats removed and workbench facilities installed. The other coach was converted into staff accommodation with lockers, cooking, washing facilities and a WC, and 12 seats with tables as a mess saloon. An old coach was converted to carry of overhead wire and attached to the unit as a trailer. Portable floodlights for night work were installed in the two coaches and in the trailer.

The unit worked on the Manchester – Altrincham line. It was moved to Longsight Depot in 1959 and taken out of service shortly afterwards. It still existed in a derelict state as late as 1967.

The design may be seen as a step in the development of post-war British Railways diesel multiple units (DMU) such as the Derby Lightweight units, at least as far the powertrain is concerned.
==Other single units==
An Armstrong Whitworth diesel-electric railcar operated a luxury 12-seat express service on the LMS for two weeks in 1933 between London and Castle Bromwich near Birmingham in connection with a British Industries Fair. This car, with body work by Cravens which incorporated a kitchen, was powered by a standard Armstrong-Saurer 250 bhp engine.

Between 1936 and 1937, the LMS trialled two experimental railcars built by Armstrong Siddeley to a French design, which had Michelin pneumatic tyres. These were tested on the Leamington to Nuneaton route. Despite proving popular with passengers and crew, no orders happened, and they were withdrawn in 1937.

<doc id="1343925" wikidata="Q735824" url="?curid=1343925" title="Johnny Douglas">
<text>John William Henry Tyler Douglas (3 September 1882 – 19 December 1930) was an English cricketer who was active in the early decades of the twentieth century. Douglas was an all-rounder who played for Essex County Cricket Club from 1901 to 1928 and captained the county from 1911 to 1928. He also played for England and captained the England team both before and after the First World War with markedly different success. As well as playing cricket, Douglas was a notable amateur boxer who won the middleweight gold medal at the 1908 Olympic Games.

==Early life==
Douglas was the son of successful timber merchant John Herbert Douglas (1853–1930) and Julia Ann (née Tyler) and was born at Stoke Newington, London in what is now Belfast Road. He was educated at Moulton Grammar School and Felsted School, where at school he was coached by the former first-class player T.N. Perkins, and joined his father&#x27;s wood-importing firm, which supported his amateur status in cricket and boxing. Douglas also played football once for the England amateur side (occasion unknown, through loss of records). He served in the Bedfordshire Regiment throughout World War I, eventually as major (acting lieutenant-colonel).

==Boxing career==
Douglas took up boxing while still a schoolboy, and won the Amateur Boxing Association 1905 middleweight title when boxing out of the Belsize ABC.

In 1908, Douglas won an Olympic gold medal as a middleweight boxer. All three of his bouts, including the final, described by The Times as &quot;one of the most brilliant exhibitions of skilful boxing, allied to tremendous hitting, ever seen.&quot;, were held on the same day. The silver medal winner, Snowy Baker, 44 years later falsely claimed that Douglas&#x27;s father was the sole judge and referee.

Baker never publicly contested the close points verdict which Douglas, who scored a second-round knockdown over him and won in their Olympic final. Yet, in a 1952 interview, he claimed that Douglas&#x27;s father had refereed the fight, leading to widespread suspicion of a dodgy decision. In reality, Douglas Senior was at ringside to present the medals in his role as president of the Amateur Boxing Association of England (ABA). The real referee was Eugene Corri, who did not have to give a casting vote as the two judges agreed that Douglas was a narrow winner. Douglas Jr, his father and his younger brother, Cecil (&#x27;Pickles&#x27;) were all prominent referees and officials in the ABA, the last also being the leading referee in the professional sport in the 1930s. Besides his Olympic gold, Douglas also won the 1905 ABA middleweight title.

=== Olympic results ===
* Defeated René Doudelle (France) KO round 1
* 2nd round bye
* Defeated Ruben Warnes (Great Britain) KO round 2
* Defeated Snowy Baker (Australia) Decision

==Cricket career==
Douglas was an untiring fast-medium bowler and obdurate batsman who was nicknamed with a play on his initials JWHT as &quot;Johnny Will Hit Today&quot; or conversely &quot;Johnny Won&#x27;t Hit Today&quot; by Australian hecklers. He captained the school teams at Felsted and was a member of Wanstead C.C. He made his Essex debut at the age of eighteen against Yorkshire and bagged a pair, with George Hirst dismissing him in both innings. He played in only two more matches that season and, in the 1902 season, did not appear at all in first-class cricket while working incessantly on his game in practice. He regained his place in the Essex side in the 1903 season, playing eleven matches &quot;but was still anything but a good player&quot;. The improvements in his game continued, and by 1905 he had become a strong county bowler, finishing top of the Essex bowling averages with 31 wickets at an average of just above 26, and taking the first of his three first-class hat-tricks, against Yorkshire at Leyton. In 1908, he passed 1000 runs in a season for the first time. He had matured into a leading all-rounder who took over the captaincy of Essex in 1911, a captaincy which he retained until 1928. He was unhappy about being removed from the captaincy, saying, &quot;The fact that I did not resign, but was kicked out of the captaincy, has created a delicate situation.&quot; He also complained that some of his players had not shown the loyalty he was due, on and off the field.

He played for England before and after the First World War. Douglas was named as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1915, but play was suspended during the war years. After the war, until 1923, he had to carry Essex&#x27;s bowling on his shoulders except when George Louden turned out. He took over 100 wickets in a season seven times, with a best of 147 in 1920. The following year against Derbyshire, he produced perhaps the most remarkable all-round performance in English first-class cricket history. After taking nine for 47, Douglas stopped a breakdown against Bill Bestwick with an unbeaten 210 that tired him so much he did not bowl until the end of Derbyshire&#x27;s second innings. He then took two for none, giving him a match record of eleven for 47.

Douglas captained England eighteen times, with a Test match record of won eight, lost eight, drawn two. Successful as stand-in captain in Australia in 1911, he won the series 4–1. On the 1920/21 tour of Australia, he led a depleted post-war side that suffered a 0–5 &#x27;whitewash&#x27;, a scoreline not repeated in an Ashes series until the 2006/7 England team lost by the same margin. Reappointed reluctantly by the M.C.C. in 1921, he lost the first two Tests at home to Warwick Armstrong&#x27;s side and was displaced as captain but retained in the XI. He captained England in one further Test match, against South Africa in July 1924, and played his final Test on the 1924/25 England tour of Australia.

==Later life==

Douglas married Evelyn Ruby (sister of two of his close wartime friends), the widow of Captain Thomas Elphinstone Case, of the Coldstream Guards, daughter of Adolphus Ferguson and Minnie Byron, on 25 December 1916. He had no children but one stepson, the actor Gerald Case.

Douglas drowned when the Finnish passenger ship , on which he and his father were sailing back to Britain after buying timber in Finland, sank in the Kattegat seven miles south of the Læsø Trindel Lightship, Denmark. Another ship of the same line, &quot;Arcturus&quot;, had rammed her in fog after the two captains, who were brothers, had tried to exchange Christmas greetings. According to a witness at the post mortem enquiry, Douglas may have been trying to save his father. He was aged 48.

<text>George William Davies (born 29 October 1941) is an English fashion designer and retailer.

Davies headed Next from its creation in the 1980s, before moving on to start the fashion label &#x27;George at Asda&#x27; in the 1990s. Leaving Asda in 2000 following their acquisition by Walmart, he launched the &quot;Per Una&quot; fashion collection at Marks &amp; Spencer.

In 2009, Davies launched his 4th brand (called GIVe) which saw 26 stores opening in selected towns and cities in the UK along with an e-commerce retailing.

Dubbed as a &quot;serial brand creator&quot;, the &quot;King of the High Street&quot; and &quot;the leading fashion visionary&quot; he was awarded the Drapers Record Life Time Achievement award in 2003 and the &quot;Designer of the Decade&quot; by Prima in 2004.

==Early life==
George William Davies was born in Crosby, Lancashire, on 29 October 1941 to sausage maker George Snr, and seamstress Mary Davies. Davies cites his mother as his motivation to succeed in life in fashion:

His grandparents lived on a farm in Thornton, Crosby, and his parents moved closer to the coast when he was 11, when his mother took over a post office and his father became a sausage factory manager. Davies attended Bootle Grammar School, where he enjoyed sports including golf, football and tennis.

Asked in 2009 by the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; if he had ever been &quot;hard up&quot; he responded &quot;&quot;No. When I got pocket money as a young boy, I would save it. Apart from a blip when I was first in business, I&#x27;ve always had money. From the age of 16, I worked as a milkman in my holidays and saved to buy my first car, a Mini van&quot;.&quot; In the same article, Davies was asked if he was better off than his parents had been. &quot;&quot;Financially, I am. But &quot;better off&quot; should be measured by more than finance. My parents were an amazingly happy couple and never wanted for anything. My father was the manager of a sausage factory and my mother bought and ran a post office in her fifties&quot;&quot;.

A passionate supporter of Liverpool F.C. through his father (nowadays he is frequently seen watching from the directors&#x27; box) Davies had trials for the club during the reign of Bill Shankly but was unsuccessful (in 1995 he told &quot;The Independent&quot; that as things as turned out, it was probably for the best). However, he did go on to play centre forward for Bangor City, and also represented England Universities and England Under 18s at football and scored twice against Scotland.

==Early business career==
After walking away from Birmingham University where he was studying to become a dentist in the early &#x27;60s, Davies returned to Liverpool and applied to work for the retailers Littlewoods whose head office was based in the city. He also applied to work for Pilkington, the glass manufacturer, but Littlewoods responded first. He started off as a graduate trainee before ending up in stock control and then as a buyer (ankle socks). Davies cites his experience at Littlewoods as being the cornerstone of one of his fundamental beliefs of successful retailing – &quot;the importance of effective stock control and the need for understanding local buying patterns&quot; – commonly known in retail as Trading. He also credits Littlewoods as offering him &quot;the most fantastic training&quot; environment which was to strongly contribute to his successes in the future.

In 2007, he told &quot;The Times&quot;: &quot;During the Whitsun holidays in Manchester, children dressed up in white and took part in the Whit Walks. Sales of white ankle socks went up by 200 dozen in the area and I had only sent 10. The manager of the store was soon on the phone shouting about what some stupid person had done. I had to drive to the supplier in Leicestershire and deliver the socks myself. It saved my job. Without that I don&#x27;t think I would be here now. It taught me that in retailing every store is different.&quot;

==First entrepreneurial steps==
In 1972 Davies launched his first business – &quot;Schoolcare&quot;, a mail order company specialising in the supply of children&#x27;s school uniforms. However &quot;Schoolcare&quot; experienced problems when their bank suffered financial difficulties. Whilst the demise of &quot;Schoolcare&quot; is no more than a tiny piece in the Davies business jigsaw, it is regarded as the birthplace of another Davies trademark legacy – the &quot;total look concept&quot;.

In 1973, he was invited to join a fast-growing home-based fashion retailer called Pippa Dee which operated in a similar trading style to Tupperware, counting on a self-employed sales force of over thirteen thousand women to organise house party plan sales across the UK. Davies initially joined as Product and Design Director but very quickly became the driving force behind the sales operation. In a move that was to be reflected in his later business life, Davies left Pippa Dee amid a boardroom struggle and broken promises from other directors.

===J Hepworth &amp; Son and &quot;NEXT&quot;===

In 1981, the chairman of Leeds based men&#x27;s retailer Hepworth&#x27;s, Sir Terence Conran, approached Davies to join the retail chain and revamp the concept to better combine their new purchase, the 70 stores of Kendall &amp; Sons Ltd.

Briefed to come up with a concept that would bring profitability to Kendall&#x27;s, Davies&#x27; response was a blueprint which became NEXT, now the third most successful high street chain in the UK after Marks &amp; Spencer and BHS/Arcadia Group.

The first NEXT shops opened on 12 February 1982, with the Kendall&#x27;s conversion complete by the end of 1983. Based around &quot;the total concept look,&quot; it encouraged customers to mix and match within a style, resulting in customers having both trend and buying more. The average NEXT customer would buy five items, not just the one they had entered the shop originally to buy.

Made Chief Executive in 1984, Davies then converted the 50 Hepworth&#x27;s stores to the NEXT format, extending the total concept look at the same time to cover menswear. In 1985, NEXT interiors was added to stores which were deemed in the &quot;right demographic areas.&quot; In 1986, Davies moved the group&#x27;s headquarters from Leeds to Leicester, to be closer to the main garment manufacturers.

In 1987, the group bought the Grattan catalogue company. Extending first to introduce NEXT childrenswear, he then introduced the NEXT Directory based around four key concepts:
*Directory: while a traditional catalogue was printed at a price and kept out of sight, NEXT Directory was hard backed and designed to be placed on a coffee table
*Editorial: the directory was photographed by top fashion and media photographers including Neil Kirk and Herb Ritts, and featuring Vogue models including Yasmin le Bon, Uma Thurman and Carla Bruni.
*Swatch sample: while traditional catalogues showed glossy paper pictures of models in the clothes, Davies added to the concept by including sample swatches of the actual materials (3&quot; x 3&quot; cut out and stuck-in squares)
*Service: while traditional catalogues often gave a 28-day from delivery service, NEXT Directory offered 48-hour delivery, allowed for by being directly next to the suppliers

At the same time, Davies launched the NEXT account card.

The pressures of ever-increasing growth and expansion demanded by the analysts in the city caused NEXT to go through turbulent times in 1988. Under new chairman Sir David Jones, Davies&#x27; expansion plans and diversification of the brand were cited as one of the causes for the share price dropping. In December 1988, Davies was sacked from Next by chairman Sir David Jones, who accused him of being egotistical and taking Next to the verge of bankruptcy.

===&quot;What Next?&quot;===
After leaving NEXT, Davies spent time writing his autobiography &quot;What Next?&quot;

In 1995, Davies founded Sporter, a sporting aligned clothing manufacturer. It supplies branded merchandise for sports clubs including Liverpool F.C. and Arsenal F.C. as well as Newcastle United F.C. and Rangers F.C. Sporter today employs over 100 staff, with offices in the UK, India, Sri Lanka and Italy.

===George at Asda===
Approached by UK supermarket chain Asda to create a new range of clothing, in the 1990s Davies produced his second household-name brand, George at Asda. Davies was positive about the approach, the shift of consumer spending moved from high street to out of town accessible development. Asda CEO Archie Norman commented that Davies grasped the fact that the line had to be based on value, and be a distinct brand name on its own.

The George brand and range was developed by Davies&#x27;s company Red Creative, set up to provide full clothing retail solutions through a team of designers and marketeers.

In 2000, Asda was bought by the world&#x27;s largest retailer, Wal-Mart of the United States. With the resultant resignation of the UK board, Davies also resigned his direct association. At the time of the takeover, the George brand was turning over £600M.

By 2002, Wal-Mart had rolled out George Clothing across the United States, and presently has annual global sales of £2bn. In October 2009, the BBC reported that George @ Asda brand had officially become the UK&#x27;s biggest selling clothing retailer, taking over from Marks &amp; Spencer, with a 10% UK market share.

===Marks &amp; Spencer===

As one of the top three recognised brands in the UK, Marks &amp; Spencer had a traditionally strong selling women&#x27;s clothing line. But in 2000 in light of developing fashion trends driven by distinct brands, needed to develop a new approach in their retail format.

Introduced to chairman Luc Vandevelde and CEO Roger Holmes through a mutual friend, Davies was given the brief to develop a high-touch and distinct brand/line of clothing which would appeal to a younger female market sector. Developed by Red Creative in three months as a joint venture with Marks &amp; Spencer, Per Una ( &quot;For one (woman)&quot;), had a logo of three hearts inspired by a postcard Davies picked up in Italy whilst looking for ideas for the new collection.

Within three years of launch, per una was creating an annual turnover in excess of £230M, which was over 10% of Marks &amp; Spencer womenswear sales. More importantly, Per Una was attracting a younger audience back into the store, which was having a positive knock on effect in other departments.

The &quot;Financial Times&quot; reported that it was Per Una that put Davies in the super-rich league (he sold the 5-year-old business to Marks &amp; Spencer in 2004 for £125 million) as part of the retailer&#x27;s efforts to block a potential takeover by entrepreneur Sir Philip Green.

“It (Per Una) was absolutely fundamental in the resurgence of the core appeal of womenswear,&quot; said Roger Holmes, the former chief executive of M&amp;S who signed Davies up in 2001 to bring the Per Una range to Marks. &quot;Put in the context of the value it created from saving the company as a whole, it was creating billions of profits for shareholders.&quot; Did it save the company? &quot;Yes, I don&#x27;t think that overstates the case.&quot;

Sir Stuart Rose saw through the acquisition of the Per Una brand and Davies stayed on with the company until 2008, which also saw the launch of his GD 25 range celebrating Davies&#x27; 25 anniversary in the fashion industry. According to many newspaper articles between 2005 and 2008, the relationship that Davies enjoyed with Rose was not as cordial as the one with his predecessors, Holmes and Vandevelde. However, in a recent article in the business section of &quot;The Guardian&quot;, it appeared the relationship was back on an even-keel. Davies stated: &quot;Stuart and I talk. We have a lot in common on a personal level and in truth, I couldn&#x27;t do what he does and he probably couldn&#x27;t do what I do.&quot;

Recently asked by the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; what his most lucrative piece of work has ever been, Davies responded: &quot;Building up Per Una and selling it on to Marks &amp; Spencer, without a doubt.&quot;

On Davies&#x27; departure from Per Una in December 2008, Rose commented in the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; that &quot;I&#x27;ll eat my hat if he wants to go and launch another business.&quot;

==GIVe==
On 13 June 2009 George Davies told the &quot;Financial Times&quot; that he was to launch his fourth fashion business under the name of GIVe as in George 1V – his fourth large fashion venture. The small &quot;e&quot; represents the e-commerce (internet element) of the company. The company has also been named GIVe because it is Davies&#x27; intention to donate part of the profits to charitable causes – he was quoted in the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; as expecting this figure to be up to 10% of the company&#x27;s profits.

In a recent article in the &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot;, the architect of Davies&#x27; sacking from Next, Sir David Jones, was cited as one of the motivations behind the decision to launch the current brand, GIVe. Davies said that it was an informal conversation over a drink with Jones in early 2009 that convinced him to launch GIVe when he was seriously considering whether it was a risk worth taking or not.

Sir David Jones confirmed the conversation: &quot;I remember the conversation well,&quot; &quot;Believe it or not, George Davies and I are very good friends after 25 years. George is an outstanding individual – he started Next, he did George at Asda – and he&#x27;s a passionate man. Life is too short to hold grudges and I wish him well.&quot;

GIVe opened its doors in 25 towns and cities across the UK in October 2009 and, according to the FT, provides Italian-inspired, high quality women&#x27;s fashion clothing at affordable prices. The move (in a recession) is typical of Davies who spots a niche, observes what the competition are doing and then does the opposite. In a June 2009 independent poll conducted by Drapers Online, 100% of the voters agreed that the new venture would be another success story for Davies.

Davies describes the range of Italian-inspired luxurious women&#x27;s wear as &quot;affordable luxury&quot; and the target sector as being women over the age of 30, although Davies recently commented that &quot;it&#x27;s not about age, it&#x27;s about attitude&quot;.

In July 2009, Drapers reported that Davies was in advanced discussions with House of Fraser and Dutch retail group Maxeda to take GIVe to a new dimension in terms of store coverage from spring 2010. It was suggested that the potential high-profile partnerships demonstrated the &quot;serial brand maker&#x27;s&quot; commitment to creating a fourth &quot;mega brand&quot; to shake up the fashion sector – Davies had been openly critical of the UK&#x27;s homogeneous high street in 2008.

In August 2009, &quot;Retail Week&quot; revealed the locations for GIVe&#x27;s first stores. Under the headline &quot;Fashion legend George Davies has secured a raft of shopping centre deals for his new venture Give&quot;, the magazine correctly confirmed GIVe&#x27;s first chosen store sites. In addition to Regent Street, Bluewater and Meadowhall stores, GIVe is opening in Liverpool, Cribbs Causeway, Kingston, Glasgow and Harrogate in October and November. Sixteen independent retailers (including 10 Beales shops) across the UK entered into joint venture agreements with GIVe to carry the range in a large concession-style deal which also opened in October 2009.

In the run-up to the brand&#x27;s launch Davies agreed an exclusive deal with women&#x27;s fashion magazine &quot;Grazia&quot;. Describing the brand GIVe &quot;as the most exciting story to come out of retail this year&quot; and &quot;from what we&#x27;ve seen it&#x27;s set to be a major new fixture on the British high street&quot;, Miller said that she and her Editor-in-Chief, Jane Bruton, had been given a preview of the new range which Davies kept very firmly under wraps prior to the brand&#x27;s launch in October 2009.

On 22 September, &quot;Grazia&quot; featured a 24-page promotion dedicated to GIVe and some of its clothing and accessory range. &quot;Grazia&quot; also highlighted that Emma Trayner (Davies&#x27; second daughter) has also played a large part in the selection and design input into GIVe&#x27;s collection.

In an interview with the Business section of the &quot;Sunday Times&quot;, Davies confirmed that he had invested over £20,000,000 of his own money in the new venture. He told the paper that he planned to donate up to 10% of the company&#x27;s profits to charitable causes. He also said that he was in discussions to take the brand global and that he would be disappointed if GIVe did not see sales of £50m-£60m.

Davies was described by &quot;The Week&quot; as being &quot;indefatigable&quot; – in other words &quot;incapable of being tired out; not yielding to fatigue; untiring.&quot; &quot;Elle&quot; magazine commented that &quot;the designs are still underwraps, but we hear we should expect chic women&#x27;s wear to rival the likes of Whistles and Karen Millen&quot;.

Davies believes that many large high street retailers have failed to react quickly enough and embrace the power of the internet and its impact on the consumer, including the use of social network sites such as Facebook and Twitter to get the message of new product into the public domain. In an interview in &quot;Retail Week&quot;, Davies said: &quot;I&#x27;ve had to understand a lot of new things like Twitter, Facebook and blogging because that&#x27;s the route consumers have gone. I feel the high street has left itself open to the rise of that sort of medium.&quot;

Davies also said the new GIVe stores include in-store internet kiosks giving customers real-time stock information as well as video content of the store&#x27;s garments on a catwalk (the shopper will scan a bar code into the system and get instant video feedback of what the chosen garment looks like on the catwalk). In addition the same in-store system will allow shoppers to order home delivery.

Speaking to the &quot;Financial Times&quot; in December 2009, Davies discussed his intentions of taking the GIVe brand overseas. It had been widely reported that he was in discussions with several different groups in India and the Middle East and was considering launching the brand outside of the UK in the second quarter of 2010.

GIVe was effectively closed for any further trading in early 2011 and the holding company that was its parent company, &quot;Sporter Ltd&quot; was put into receivership in September 2011.

==Personal life and charity support==
Davies is the father of seven children (five daughters and two sons) and has three former wives.

In 2008, it was reported that he had built a 7-hole golf course in his back garden.

Davies divides his time between his family, his business ventures and his seven chosen charities which includes helping the education of under-privileged children in Asia as well as making life more comfortable for British soldiers injured in combat overseas. In an interview with the Sunday Times, Davies revealed that he had decided to give his private yacht away to a charity called Sail 4 Cancer (a charity which provides families suffering from cancer with respite break sailing holidays). He also donated the use of his private jet to the &quot;Celebration of Life After Cancer&quot; charity who successfully auctioned the prize to raise funds for people who were living and coping with cancer.

In addition, Davies was a Governor of Malvern College and is the benefactor behind the George Davies Centre for Retail Excellence at Heriot-Watt University.

Davies is also a trustee of the Mvumi School Trust, which oversees the DCT Mvumi Secondary School in Tanzania.

Davies was found guilty of drink driving in June 2011 following a 5-mile police chase in May 2010.

In September 2017, Davies made a £5.15 million donation to the University of Leicester and hospitals associated with it. This was the university&#x27;s largest ever philanthropic gift from an individual, with the money largely supporting research into vascular limb disease. The university renamed its Centre for Medicine to the George Davies Centre in honour of this donation in November of that year, with Sir David Attenborough officially opening the building.

<text>Peter Wagner is a German social and political theorist. His research brings together social and political philosophy and theory with the comparative-historical sociology of modern societies in Europe, Latin America and southern Africa. He has done comparative research in the history of the social sciences and has contributed to debates about the so-called Axial Age, while his recent work has addressed questions of historical progress and social and political transformations. He is a former Professor of Social and Political Theory at the European University Institute, Florence, and a former Professor of Sociology at the University of Warwick. At present he is an ICREA Research Professor at the University of Barcelona.

He has also held visiting positions at the Université de Paris 8 (2011); the Université catholique de Louvain-la-neuve (2009–10); University of Cape Town (2009–10); the University of Bergen (2001); the Ecole des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales, Paris (1998; 2001); the University of California at Berkeley (1996; 1997); the Swedish Collegium for Advanced Study, Uppsala; the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton (1990–91); and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Paris (1994), among others. He was Principal Investigator of the European Research Council-funded Advanced Grant project “Trajectories of modernity: comparing non-European and European varieties”, and the Project Leader of the HERA (Humanities in the European Research Area) Joint Research Programme “Uses of the Past” on the project “The debt: historicizing Europe&#x27;s relations with the &#x27;South&#x27;”, with Axel Honneth, Simona Forti and Bo Stråth as Principal Investigators.

<doc id="1343934" wikidata="Q7658373" url="?curid=1343934" title="Swimming hole">
<text>A swimming hole is a place in a river, stream, creek, spring, or similar natural body of water, which is large enough and deep enough for a person to swim in. Common usage usually refers to fresh, moving water and thus not to oceans or lakes.

In the UK swimming at natural swimming holes has a long history and has recently become known as &quot;wild swimming&quot;, especially since the publication of bestselling books on the subject by Kate Rew and Daniel Start. In southern Australia, a compendium of swimming holes was first characterised by Brad Neal in his 2004 publication of the first edition of the Guide to Freshwater Swimming Holes in Victoria, Australia.

Nude swimming is a well-established tradition at some more remote swimming holes and is an attraction for many natural swimming fans, but in many parts of the world remains an illegal activity.

== History ==

In Europe, as the nineteenth century dawned, a new era of contemporary artists were rediscovering the appeal of the swimming hole. The waterfall, surrounded by trees and mountains, was now regarded as the quintessence of beauty. William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Thomas de Quincey spent much time bathing in the mountain pools of the Lake District. The study and search for the ‘picturesque’ and ‘sublime’ – an almost scientific measure of loveliness and proportion in the landscape – had reached epidemic proportions. The fashionable tours of Provence or Tuscany were replaced by trips to the valleys of Wales, and the dales of the UK&#x27;s Cumbria and Yorkshire, as Turner and Constable painted a prodigious flow of falls, tarns and ponds.

In southern Australia, swimming in natural swimming holes was popular until around the time of the 1956 Olympics in Melbourne. In the first half of the 20th century there were several swimming clubs along the Yarra River in Melbourne, such as at Deep Rock, for example. Numerous chlorinated, municipal swimming pools were built across Victoria in the lead up to the 1956 Olympics, which changed the community&#x27;s swimming preferences to the local pool, rather than the local river. The swimming clubs along the Yarra River closed in response to this change in preferences. Some of these pre-Olympic swimming pools still exist, such as at Hepburn Pool in central Victoria, and Seven Creeks in Euroa.

== Safety ==
Safety is a concern with swimming in natural settings. Typically there are no lifeguards. Currents can be swift and, in larger rivers, are often hidden beneath the surface. Diving or jumping is especially dangerous as the depth varies from season to season, and there may be hidden rocks below the surface resulting in broken necks or backs and paralysis or death. 
Alcohol consumption while swimming is especially dangerous, and contributes to at least 20% of deaths by drowning.

<doc id="1343942" wikidata="Q7971051" url="?curid=1343942" title="Warton, Fylde">
<text>Warton is a village in the civil parish of Bryning-with-Warton, on the Fylde, in the Fylde district, in the county of Lancashire, England.

The village is west of Preston and south-east of Blackpool. It is located on the banks of the River Ribble, close to its entry into the Irish Sea. It is best known for its airfield, Warton Aerodrome and the associated aircraft manufacturing plant of BAE Systems Military Air &amp; Information.

== History ==

The village is named Wartun or Wartuna in the Domesday Book, and the current spelling is first seen in 1227.

For probate purposes, prior to 1858, Warton was in the Archdeaconry of Richmond, in the Diocese of Chester.

Warton was formerly a township and chapelry in the parish of Kirkham, in 1866 Warton became a separate civil parish, on 1 April 1934 the parish was abolished to form &quot;Bryning with Warton&quot;, part also went to Freckleton. In 1931 the parish had a population of 585.

In his 1870 Gazetteer, Wilson reports that the chapelry of Warton also included the Freckleton township, and comprised 6,598 acres, with a population 1,325 and 270 houses. The property is described as being &quot;much subdivided&quot;. Cotton spinning and the manufacture of sacking, sailcloth, and cordage were the main occupations. There were two churches, both described as &quot;good&quot;. There were also two Methodist chapels.

Warton Post Mill, one of the last sunk post mills in England, was situated at the end of Mill Lane. All that remains of the former post mill is a circular wooden post that is stabilised by crossed timbers. The mill is thought to have been built in Lincolnshire in about 1695 before being moved to Rufford, Lancashire, in the early-mid 18th century and subsequently to Warton in 1771. It was last wind worked in about 1895. It then deteriorated and the ruin was left standing in the middle of a scrap yard. In June 1999 the substructure was excavated by the Chorley Archaeological Society. The buried cross-trees and the lower ends of the main post and quarterbars were all found to be rotten. In September 1999 three of the quarterbars were destroyed by vandals. The mill was consequently dismantled and stored in the nearby BAE Systems factory. Only the millstone and the old anvil are preserved at the former smithy. It was a Grade II listed building from 1996 until 2019. The mill is reflected in the name of the modern nearby street Post Lane.

==St Paul&#x27;s Church==

The first church, Holy Trinity on Church Road, was built in 1722 and consecrated in 1725. Originally built as a chapel of ease to Kirkham, it eventually became a parish church with its own vicar.

The present church has a sanctuary chair bearing the initials WS and MS and dated 1611. A William Shaw, who died in 1720, donated the land for the old church to be built on, and a local historian has suggested that the initials may be those of two of his ancestors.

In his 1870 Gazetteer, Wilson reports that the living was a vicarage in the diocese of Manchester with a value of £350, the patron being Christ Church in Oxford.

The present church, now dedicated to St Paul, was built in 1886. A selection of celebratory events took place for the 125th Anniversary of the church, over the weekend of 25 and 26 June 2011, including an organ recital. The church is linked with a Lutheran church in Timmerlah in the Diocese of Braunschweig in Northern Germany.

On 4 August 2014 the church hosted a photographic exhibition to mark the 100th anniversary of the start of World War I.

During the hours of darkness the church is floodlit. Since June 2018 the vicar has been Rev. Jane Greenhalgh. The curate is Rev. Fiona Haines. Greenhalgh was criticised, in 2018, for wearing a white poppy for the annual Remembrance Day service and for by including references to white supremacy, the Ku Klux Klan and the English Defence League in her sermon.

==Parish council==
Bryning-with-Warton Parish Council is one of fifteen such councils that serves the Borough of Fylde. The parish spans across Bryning to Warton hall.

==Air Training Corps==
Warton is home to the 967 (BAE Warton Squadron) Air Training Corps, nicknamed the Warton Wanderers. It is a member of the Cumbria and Lancashire Wing of the ATC.

==Education==
Bryning-with-Warton St Paul&#x27;s Church of England Primary School is located on Lytham Road (A584). St Paul&#x27;s was established in 1821 and is a Voluntary Aided Church of England primary school. Holy Family Catholic Primary School is also located on Lytham Road.

==Amenities==
Warton Library was situated at 156 Lytham Road The library premises closed in 2010 but has since been re-furbished and is used as staging point for police community support officers. On 8 February 2013 the premises re-opened as a community library offering a book exchange service every Wednesday and Saturday.

The village has two public houses. The Birley Arms is located on Bryning Lane. The Birley family were 19th century flax and cotton mill-owners in nearby Kirkham. In October 2012 the public house formerly named the Pickwick Tavern became the Clifton Arms at Warton. In addition to the two public houses there is a social club, the Chequers, located on Harbour Lane. There is also a Morrisons on Harbour Lane and a Tesco Express on Lytham Road. The village Post Office closed in July 2012 and the premises is now for sale. In June 2015 a Post Office counter was opened in McColl&#x27;s, which is open from 6am to 10pm daily. The village has a number of car sales outlets. The main garage in the village, J. Townsend and Son, was largely demolished in 2017 and reopened as a Spar, including butchers and delicatessen in 2018. Fuel is now sold on the new forecourt through the Spar counters but Townsends have retained their tyre and car repair business, sharing their space with Coastal Coaches. The village also attracts many tourists from the populous caravan and holiday parks in the area including Oaklands Caravan Park situated on Lytham Road which is owned by the U.K. Leisure Parks group.

==Sport==
National League football club AFC Fylde originally played home games at Kellamergh Park in the village, between 2006 and 2016, having previously played at the council-owned Coronation Road in Kirkham. They now play at a purpose-built stadium at the new £18m development Mill Farm Sports Village in Wesham.

<doc id="1343949" wikidata="Q1568346" url="?curid=1343949" title="Test case">
<text>In software engineering, a test case is a specification of the inputs, execution conditions, testing procedure, and expected results that define a single test to be executed to achieve a particular software testing objective, such as to exercise a particular program path or to verify compliance with a specific requirement. Test cases underlie testing that is methodical rather than haphazard. A battery of test cases can be built to produce the desired coverage of the software being tested. Formally defined test cases allow the same tests to be run repeatedly against successive versions of the software, allowing for effective and consistent regression testing.

== Formal test cases ==

In order to fully test that all the requirements of an application are met, there must be at least two test cases for each requirement: one positive test and one negative test. If a requirement has sub-requirements, each sub-requirement must have at least two test cases. Keeping track of the link between the requirement and the test is frequently done using a traceability matrix. Written test cases should include a description of the functionality to be tested, and the preparation required to ensure that the test can be conducted.

A formal written test case is characterized by a known input and by an expected output, which is worked out before the test is executed. The known input should test a precondition and the expected output should test a postcondition.

== Informal test cases ==

For applications or systems without formal requirements, test cases can be written based on the accepted normal operation of programs of a similar class. In some schools of testing, test cases are not written at all but the activities and results are reported after the tests have been run.

In scenario testing, hypothetical stories are used to help the tester think through a complex problem or system. These scenarios are usually not written down in any detail. They can be as simple as a diagram for a testing environment or they could be a description written in prose. The ideal scenario test is a story that is motivating, credible, complex, and easy to evaluate. They are usually different from test cases in that test cases are single steps while scenarios cover a number of steps of the key.

== Typical written test case format ==

A test case usually contains a single step or a sequence of steps to test the correct behavior/functionality and features of an application. An expected result or expected outcome is usually given.

Additional information that may be included:
*Test case ID - A unique identifier for the test case.
*Description/summary - The test case objective.
*Test steps - The exact steps to perform.
*Expected result - The expected outcome and how to determine whether it has been realized.
*Actual result
*Pre-requisites - Conditions that must exist or preparation required before test execution. 
*Test category
*Author - name of the tester.
*Automation - whether this test case is automated or not and, if so, how.
*Pass/fail 
*Remarks

Larger test cases may also contain prerequisite states or steps, and descriptions.

A written test case should also contain a place for the actual result.

These steps can be stored in a word processor document, spreadsheet, database or other common repository.

In a database system, you may also be able to see past test results and who generated the results and the system configuration used to generate those results. These past results would usually be stored in a separate table.

Test suites often also contain
* Test summary
* Configuration

Besides a description of the functionality to be tested, and the preparation required to ensure that the test can be conducted, the most time-consuming part in the test case is creating the tests and modifying them when the system changes.

Under special circumstances, there could be a need to run the test, produce results, and then a team of experts would evaluate if the results can be considered as a pass. This happens often on new products&#x27; performance number determination. The first test is taken as the base line for subsequent test and product release cycles.

Acceptance tests, which use a variation of a written test case, are commonly performed by a group of end-users or clients of the system to ensure the developed system meets the requirements specified or the contract. User acceptance tests are differentiated by the inclusion of happy path or positive test cases to the almost complete exclusion of negative test cases.

<doc id="1343951" wikidata="Q1554293" url="?curid=1343951" title="Seifert surface">
<text>In mathematics, a Seifert surface (named after German mathematician Herbert Seifert) is an orientable surface whose boundary is a given knot or link.

Such surfaces can be used to study the properties of the associated knot or link. For example, many knot invariants are most easily calculated using a Seifert surface. Seifert surfaces are also interesting in their own right, and the subject of considerable research.

Specifically, let &quot;L&quot; be a tame oriented knot or link in Euclidean 3-space (or in the 3-sphere). A Seifert surface is a compact, connected, oriented surface &quot;S&quot; embedded in 3-space whose boundary is &quot;L&quot; such that the orientation on &quot;L&quot; is just the induced orientation from &quot;S&quot;.

Note that any compact, connected, oriented surface with nonempty boundary in Euclidean 3-space is the Seifert surface associated to its boundary link. A single knot or link can have many different inequivalent Seifert surfaces. A Seifert surface must be oriented. It is possible to associate surfaces to knots which are not oriented nor orientable, as well.

==Examples==

The standard Möbius strip has the unknot for a boundary but is not a Seifert surface for the unknot because it is not orientable.

The &quot;checkerboard&quot; coloring of the usual minimal crossing projection of the trefoil knot gives a Mobius strip with three half twists. As with the previous example, this is not a Seifert surface as it is not orientable. Applying Seifert&#x27;s algorithm to this diagram, as expected, does produce a Seifert surface; in this case, it is a punctured torus of genus &quot;g&quot; = 1, and the Seifert matrix is
:formula_1

==Existence and Seifert matrix==

It is a theorem that any link always has an associated Seifert surface. This theorem was first published by Frankl and Pontryagin in 1930. A different proof was published in 1934 by Herbert Seifert and relies on what is now called the Seifert algorithm. The algorithm produces a Seifert surface formula_2, given a projection of the knot or link in question.

Suppose that link has &quot;m&quot; components ( for a knot), the diagram has &quot;d&quot; crossing points, and resolving the crossings (preserving the orientation of the knot) yields &quot;f&quot; circles. Then the surface formula_2 is constructed from &quot;f&quot; disjoint disks by attaching &quot;d&quot; bands. The homology group formula_4 is free abelian on 2&quot;g&quot; generators, where

:formula_5

is the genus of formula_2. The intersection form &quot;Q&quot; on formula_4 is skew-symmetric, and there is a basis of 2&quot;g&quot; cycles formula_8 with
formula_9 equal to a direct sum of the &quot;g&quot; copies of the matrix

:formula_10

The 2&quot;g&quot; × 2&quot;g&quot; integer Seifert matrix

:formula_11

has formula_12 the linking number in Euclidean 3-space (or in the 3-sphere) of &quot;a&quot;&quot;i&quot; and the &quot;pushoff&quot; of &quot;a&quot;&quot;j&quot; in the positive direction of formula_2. More precisely, recalling that Seifert surfaces are bicollared, meaning that we can extend the embedding of formula_2 to an embedding of formula_15, given some representative loop formula_16 which is homology generator in the interior of formula_2, the positive pushout is formula_18 and the negative pushout is formula_19.

With this, we have

:formula_20

where &quot;V&quot;∗ = (&quot;v&quot;(&quot;j&quot;, &quot;i&quot;)) the transpose matrix. Every integer 2&quot;g&quot; × 2&quot;g&quot; matrix formula_21 with formula_22 arises as the Seifert matrix of a knot with genus &quot;g&quot; Seifert surface.

The Alexander polynomial is computed from the Seifert matrix by formula_23 which is a polynomial of degree at most 2&quot;g&quot; in the indeterminate formula_24 The Alexander polynomial is independent of the choice of Seifert surface formula_25 and is an invariant of the knot or link.

The signature of a knot is the signature of the symmetric Seifert matrix formula_26 It is again an invariant of the knot or link.

==Genus of a knot==
Seifert surfaces are not at all unique: a Seifert surface &quot;S&quot; of genus &quot;g&quot; and Seifert matrix &quot;V&quot; can be modified by a topological surgery, resulting in a Seifert surface &quot;S&quot;′ of genus &quot;g&quot; + 1 and Seifert matrix

:formula_27

The genus of a knot &quot;K&quot; is the knot invariant defined by the minimal genus &quot;g&quot; of a Seifert surface for &quot;K&quot;.

For instance:
* An unknot—which is, by definition, the boundary of a disc—has genus zero. Moreover, the unknot is the knot with genus zero. 
* The trefoil knot has genus 1, as does the figure-eight knot.
* The genus of a (&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;)-torus knot is (&quot;p&quot; − 1)(&quot;q&quot; − 1)/2
* The degree of a knot&#x27;s Alexander polynomial is a lower bound on twice its genus.

A fundamental property of the genus is that it is additive with respect to the knot sum:
:formula_28

In general, the genus of a knot is difficult to compute, and the Seifert algorithm usually does not produce a Seifert surface of least genus. For this reason other related invariants are sometimes useful. The canonical genus formula_29 of a knot is the least genus of all Seifert surfaces that can be constructed by the Seifert algorithm, and the free genus formula_30 is the least genus of all Seifert surfaces whose complement in formula_31 is a handlebody. (The complement of a Seifert surface generated by the Seifert algorithm is always a handlebody.) For any knot the inequality formula_32 obviously holds, so in particular these invariants place upper bounds on the genus.

The knot genus is NP-complete by work of Ian Agol, Joel Hass and William Thurston.

It has been shown that there are Seifert surfaces of the same genus that do not become isotopic either topologically or smoothly in the 4-ball.

<text>The Coefficients was a monthly dining club founded in 1902 by the Fabian campaigners Sidney and Beatrice Webb as a forum for British socialist reformers and imperialists of the Edwardian era. The name of the dining club was a reflection of the group&#x27;s focus on &quot;efficiency&quot;.

==Membership==
The Webbs proposed that the club&#x27;s membership reflect the entire gamut of political beliefs, and &quot;proposed to collect politicians from each of the parties&quot;. Representing the Liberal Imperialists were Sir Edward Grey and Richard Burdon Haldane; the Tories were represented by economist William Hewins and editor of the &quot;National Review&quot; Leopold Maxse; and the British military was represented by Leo Amery, an &quot;expert on the conditions of the army&quot;, and Carlyon Bellairs, a naval officer.

The club&#x27;s membership included:

* Leo Amery, statesman and Conservative politician
* Richard Burdon Haldane, Liberal politician, lawyer, and philosopher
* Halford John Mackinder, geographer and politician
* Leopold Maxse, editor, &quot;National Review&quot; 
* Alfred Milner, statesman and colonial administrator
* Henry Newbolt, author and poet
* Carlyon Bellairs, naval commander and MP
* James Louis Garvin, journalist and editor
* William Hewins, economist
* William Pember Reeves, New Zealand statesman, historian, and poet
* Bertrand Russell, philosopher and mathematician
* Sir Clinton Edward Dawkins, businessman and civil servant
* Sir Henry Birchenough, businessman and civil servant
* Sir Edward Grey, Liberal politician
* H. G. Wells, novelist

Wells was recruited because he was deemed &quot;capable of original thoughts on every subject&quot; and proved to be &quot;an especially active member&quot;.

==History==
The Webbs came up with the idea of the dinner club as a forum for &quot;serious discussions and to formulate or propose political policy&quot;, but shortly after its founding the members &quot;abandoned immediate political goals&quot; but continued to meet and discuss issues of interest. Haldane hosted the first dinner at his home in December 1902.

In 1903 Bertrand Russell, who believed that the Entente cordiale policy would lead to war, resigned after Edward Grey espoused it in a speech. The group was further divided over the issue of Tariff Reform following Joseph Chamberlain&#x27;s resignation as Secretary of State for the Colonies and the increasing dominance of the pro-Unionist membership, which favoured Chamberlain and his tariff reform policies, contributed to the club&#x27;s dissolution in 1909. Amery would invite those Coefficients supporting reform to form a new club called &quot;The Compatriots&quot;.

Printed minutes of its meetings are held by the British Library of Political and Economic Science.
