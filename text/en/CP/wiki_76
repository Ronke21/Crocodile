<text>Liberty Heights is a 1999 American comedy-drama film written and directed by Barry Levinson. The film is a semi-autobiographical account of his childhood growing up in Baltimore in the 1950s. The film portrays the racial injustices experienced both by the Jewish and African-American populations. Both of Nate Kurtzman&#x27;s sons find women &quot;prohibited&quot; to them: for Van because he is Jewish, and for Ben because he is white. Their father goes to prison for running a burlesque show with Little Melvin, an African-American and known local drug dealer.

It is the fourth of Levinson&#x27;s &quot;Baltimore Films&quot;, set in his hometown during the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s; the first three are &quot;Diner&quot; (1982), &quot;Tin Men&quot; (1987) and &quot;Avalon&quot; (1990).

==Plot==
In the fall of 1954, the Kurtzmans, a Jewish family, live in Forest Park, a suburban neighborhood in northwest Baltimore. Nate, the father, runs a burlesque theater and engages in a numbers racket. His wife Ada is a homemaker. Van, the older son, attends the University of Baltimore, and Ben is in his senior year in high school.

Ben meets Sylvia, an African-American girl, who begins attending his school after the district is integrated. Despite his mother&#x27;s vocal disapproval, Ben starts to develop feelings for Sylvia and introduces himself. They become close based on a mutual love for Little Richard, James Brown, jazz, and black comedians. Sylvia&#x27;s father, an affluent doctor, disapproves of their relationship and forbids them to see one another.

On Halloween, Ben dresses up as Adolf Hitler, which shocks his parents greatly, and he is forbidden to go in public wearing the costume. Van and his friends head over to a party in a predominantly bourgeois, gentile section of town. He is attracted to a mysterious blonde woman. A fight between one of Van&#x27;s friends and a local erupts over his bigoted comments and Trey, one of the partygoers, drunkenly crashes his car into the house. Van must leave the mystery woman, who is revealed to be Trey&#x27;s girlfriend, Dubbie. He and his friends later drive around searching for her, but are unsuccessful.

Trey goes to court for the car crash. Van and his friends are there as witnesses, but they find ways to avoid testifying against him, winning Trey&#x27;s appreciation and friendship. After the hearing is over, Van asks Trey about the blonde woman he met. Trey realizes Van is asking about his own girlfriend, Dubbie, but says nothing.

Meanwhile, Nate&#x27;s burlesque theatre is in financial trouble, and in order to boost returns on the numbers game, an additional bonus number is added that will increase the pay-off. Little Melvin, a local drug dealer, makes a large bet and hits the number. Unable to pay out such a big win, Nate is forced to cut Melvin in on the racket. When Nate offers Melvin the numbers business instead, Melvin claims that Nate is trying to &quot;Jew&quot; him out of his money, and a fight breaks out between their bodyguards.

Sylvia invites Ben to see James Brown &amp; The Famous Flames in concert. There, Ben and his friend Sheldon are the only white patrons in the audience. Van and his friends head out to another party, where he again runs into Dubbie and learns she and Trey are dating.

Little Melvin spots Nate&#x27;s car off of Pennsylvania Avenue in the African-American neighborhood where James Brown is performing, and after seeing Ben and his friend inside, deduces that one of them must be Nate&#x27;s son. After the concert, Melvin abducts Ben, Sylvia, and their friends and holds them for ransom to force Nate to pay what he owes Melvin. Nate pays the ransom and becomes aware of Ben&#x27;s relationship with Sylvia.

Van discovers Trey is having surgery after another drunken car accident. He and Dubbie go to visit him at a hospital in Virginia. Trey breaks up with her, and on their way back to Maryland, she suggests they stop in a motel. They begin to be intimate, but the drunk Dubbie acts erratic, bursts into tears, and vomits in the toilet, and Van realizes she is emotionally disturbed and doesn&#x27;t return his feelings.

After a popular new burlesque performer takes her act too far, Nate and his associates from the nightclub are charged and booked with prostitution and racketeering. Before leaving for prison, Nate attends Ben and Sylvia&#x27;s high school graduation. She is attending Spelman College in Atlanta; he is staying to attend the University of Maryland. They kiss each other goodbye, shocking both their families.

Ben and his two friends tear down the segregation notice from the pool entrance and enter, remove their shirts to show all the patrons the letters &quot;J-E-W&quot; written on their chests, and defiantly sit enjoying their last summer before college. When Nate is sentenced to several years in prison, Van asks Trey to use his powerful father&#x27;s influence to allow Nate to attend a final service at their synagogue before going to prison. Before the service, Nate encourages his sons to finish their educations and pursue legitimate careers. At the synagogue, Nate walks out before the end of the service and blows a kiss to his wife as he leaves.

<text>The National Review was founded in 1883 by the English writers Alfred Austin and William Courthope.

It was launched as a platform for the views of the British Conservative Party. Its masthead incorporating a quotation of the former Conservative Prime Minister, Benjamin Disraeli, referring to him as Lord Beaconsfield: &quot;What is the Tory Party, unless it represents National feeling?&quot;

Frederick Maxse, a Liberal Unionist and Royal Navy officer, bought the National Review for his son Leopold Maxse in 1893. Leopold had taken the role of journalist and editor upon himself. When he died in 1932, his sister, Lady Violet Milner assumed those responsibilities. Lady Milner had been supporting the publication since 1928. As such, it was regarded as a family business.

Under editor Leopold Maxse, the &quot;National Review&quot; took an unfriendly attitude towards Imperial Germany in the years leading up to World War I.

The magazine was published by the Cecil Club, which became the United and Cecil Club in 1949. The magazine was renamed the National and English Review in 1950. It closed in 1960.

<doc id="1345171" wikidata="Q6591130" url="?curid=1345171" title="List of NFL franchise post-season droughts">
<text>This is a list of current and former National Football League (NFL) franchise droughts (multiple consecutive seasons of not reaching a certain achievement) related to the post-season and Super Bowl. The length of a drought is the number of seasons since the last time a franchise achieved a certain milestone. For a milestone that a franchise has never achieved, the length of the corresponding drought is equal to the number of seasons the franchise has been active.

All 32 active NFL teams have qualified for the playoffs and won at least one playoff game in their history. Of the 12 teams that have never won the Super Bowl, the seven who predate the institution of the game (the Cardinals, Lions, Oilers/Titans, Chargers, Browns, Bills, and Vikings) had all won an NFL or AFL championship prior to the AFL–NFL merger. In the case of the Vikings, however, the Super Bowl existed at the time they won their only league title (in 1969). Thus, the Vikings along with the other five teams (the Falcons, Bengals, Panthers, Jaguars and Texans, whose history is no older than the Super Bowl itself) are the only franchises to have never won the highest championship available to them. The Cardinals own the longest drought since a championship of any kind, at seasons.

Note that for continuity purposes, the Cleveland Browns are officially considered to have suspended operations for the 1996, 1997, and 1998 seasons. Since returning years ago, they have only made the playoffs three times, while the Baltimore Ravens are considered to be a separate team that began play in 1996. The Ravens, as a result of the Cleveland Browns relocation controversy, absorbed the Browns&#x27; personnel upon their suspension, but not their history.

The Bert Bell Benefit Bowl (aka the Playoff Bowl; 1960–1969) is considered an exhibition game for the purpose of this list.

<text>In Our Time is a BBC Radio 4 discussion series and podcast exploring a wide variety of historical, scientific and philosophical topics, presented by Melvyn Bragg, since 15 October 1998. It is one of Radio 4&#x27;s most successful discussion programmes, acknowledged to have &quot;transformed the landscape for serious ideas at peak listening time&quot;.

The series passed its 1,000th episode in September 2023 and attracts a weekly audience exceeding two million listeners.

==Programme==
The series, devised and produced by Olivia Seligman (with others) and currently produced by Simon Tillotson with Victoria Brignell, runs weekly throughout the year on BBC Radio 4, except for a summer break of approximately eight to ten weeks between July and September. Each programme covers a specific historical, philosophical, religious, cultural or scientific topic. In a November 2009 interview, Bragg described how he prepares for each show: &quot;It&#x27;s not easy, but I like reading. I enjoy what was called swotting in my day. I get the notes late Friday afternoon for the following Thursday morning. I find all the spare time I can for reading, get up very early on a Thursday morning, have a final two hours of nervousness, and away we go.&quot;

Bragg hosts discussion of the week&#x27;s subject featuring what he has characterised as &quot;three absolutely top-class academics&quot; on the subject. The programme is normally broadcast live and unedited on Thursday mornings at 9a.m., lasting around 42 minutes, and is then available online. He begins each episode with a short summary of the week&#x27;s topic, then introduces the three guests. He guides the discussion along a generally chronological route, then either concludes the programme himself or invites summation remarks from one of the specialists.

==History==

&quot;In Our Time&quot; was conceived for Bragg in 1998 after he was forced to quit his decade-long role as presenter for &quot;Start the Week&quot; due to a perceived conflict of interest arising from his appointment as a Labour life peer. He was offered the Thursday &quot;death-slot&quot; and decided he would &quot;do what [he] always wanted to do,&quot; and &quot;hastily battered out a simple idea&quot; with producer Olivia Seligman expecting the show would only last a few months. By September 1999, he had taken a time slot that was previously attracting an audience of 600,000 and grown it to 1.5 million. By 2000, the half-hour show was expanded to 45 minutes and to include three guest speakers. 

In 2004, the programme was made available as a podcast from the BBC website and iTunes for one week after broadcast. Until July 2014, listeners could also sign up for weekly email newsletters from Bragg, where he mentioned any additional information relating to the programme, along with snippets from his own personal and intellectual life. In 2009, selected transcripts of episodes from the programme were compiled in the book &quot;In Our Time: A Companion to the Radio 4 series&quot;, edited by Bragg. Since 2010, every episode of the programme has been available from its website as streaming audio, making it one of the first BBC programmes to have its entire archive released. Since 2011, the entire archive has been available to download as individual podcasts.
==Cultural impact==
The programme is considered one of the BBC&#x27;s most successful projects, acknowledged to have &quot;transformed the landscape for serious ideas at peak listening time&quot;. Frequent contributors to the programme since 1998 include Angie Hobbs, Simon Schaffer, Martin Palmer, Steve Jones , Paul Cartledge, Carolin Crawford, Edith Hall, A. C. Grayling, Patricia Fara, David Wootton, Jonathan Bate, and Karen O&#x27;Brien.

In 2005, listeners were invited to vote in a popularity contest for the &quot;greatest philosopher in history&quot; with the winner selected as the subject of the final programme before the summer break. With 30,000 votes cast, the contest was won by Karl Marx with 27.9% of the votes. Other shortlisted figures were David Hume (12.7%), Ludwig Wittgenstein (6.8%), Friedrich Nietzsche (6.5%), Plato (5.6%), Immanuel Kant (5.6%), Thomas Aquinas (4.8%), Socrates (4.8%), Aristotle (4.5%) and Karl Popper (4.2%). The poll was controversial but led to widespread reporting, and a boost in the programme&#x27;s overall listenership, as various UK celebrities and news outlets championed their favourites.

<text>The London International Mime Festival (LIMF) was a festival of contemporary visual theatre that operated from 1977 to 2023. The festival featured wordless and multi-disciplinary performances, including circus-theatre, puppetry/animation, object theatre, mime, live art and physical theatre.

LIMF began at the Cockpit Theatre, founded by mime performer Nola Rae MBE and producer Joseph Seelig OBE as a single event featuring British mimes, theatre clowns and other physical and visual theatre artists. The festival expanded to include international artists in 1978.

Helen Lannaghan became co-director alongside Seelig in 1987. Performances were held at various London venues, including Tate Modern, the Almeida, Barbican, Battersea Arts Centre, ICA, Jacksons Lane, Natural History Museum, Royal Opera House, Sadler&#x27;s Wells, Shoreditch Town Hall, Shunt Vaults, Soho Theatre, and Southbank Centre.

As of January 2024, the festival&#x27;s former directors have established a program called &#x27;MimeLondon&#x27; in partnership with London venues including the Barbican, Sadler&#x27;s Wells and the Southbank Centre, to continue presenting international visual theatre in London.

<text>Benjamin Huntington (April 19, 1736 – October 16, 1800) was an eighteenth-century American lawyer, jurist and politician from Connecticut and served as a delegate to the Second Continental Congress and as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives during the First United States Congress.

==Early life and career==
Huntington was born in Norwich in the Connecticut Colony, the only child of Daniel Huntington and his second wife Rachel (Wolcott) Huntington. He graduated from Yale College in 1761 and was appointed surveyor of lands for Windham County in October 1764. Huntington studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1765. He began the practice of law in Norwich. Yale College later bestowed an LL.D upon Huntington.

Huntington served as a member of the Connecticut House of Representatives from 1771 to 1780 and served as speaker of that body in 1778 and 1779. In 1775, he served on the committee of safety in the State House and was appointed to advise with Governor Jonathan Trumbull during the recess of the legislature. In 1778, Huntington was appointed a delegate to the Provincial Congress at New Haven.

From 1780 to 1784, and again in 1787 and 1788, Huntington was a member of the Continental Congress. He served on the Connecticut council of assistants from 1781 to 1789 and from 1791 to 1792. Huntington served as a member of the State Senate from 1781 to 1790 and from 1791 to 1793, also serving as a judge of the Connecticut Supreme Court of Errors from 1784 to 1790, and again from 1791 to 1793. When the new government went into operation in 1789, he was chosen to represent Connecticut in the First Congress of the United States as a Pro-Administration Party candidate, serving from March 4, 1789, to March 3, 1791.

On the incorporation of Norwich in 1784, he was elected its first Mayor, serving until his resignation in 1796. In 1793, he was appointed judge of the superior court of Connecticut, holding this office until 1798.

==Personal life==
Huntington married Anne Huntington, of Windham, Connecticut, on May 5, 1765. She died on October 6, 1790, in Norwich. Their son was named Benjamin Huntington.

==Death==
Huntington died on October 16, 1800, in Rome, New York, and is interred in the Old Colony Cemetery in Norwich.

<text>Universal Destinations &amp; Experiences (UDX), formerly Universal Parks &amp; Resorts, is the theme park unit of NBCUniversal, a subsidiary of Comcast.

The company, headquartered in Orlando, Florida, operates Universal theme parks and resort properties around the world. Universal Destinations &amp; Experiences is widely known for its wide range of attractions, themed lands, and other experiences that draw inspiration from popular classic and modern pop culture icons and intellectual properties in various media, both from NBCUniversal and third-party companies across all Universal parks.

It started as a touring attraction in the 1910s at the Universal Studios Lot in Universal City near Los Angeles, California, and in 1964 turned into a Universal Studios Hollywood theme park destination, where guests can look behind the scenes of motion pictures and television programs, produced by Universal Pictures and occasionally others, and ride attractions based on feature films and television shows. The popularity of Universal Studios Hollywood had led Universal to build parks in Florida and overseas.

In 2017, approximately 49,458,000 guests visited Universal Studios theme parks, making it the third-largest amusement park operator in the world. It is a major competitor of Disney Experiences, Six Flags, United Parks &amp; Resorts, LEGOLAND, Herschend Family Entertainment, Parques Reunidos/Palace Entertainment, and Merlin Entertainments. In August 2020, a report released by Deutsche Bank revealed that Universal Orlando Resort had surpassed Walt Disney World Resort in total attendance in the first months after both resorts reopened during the global COVID-19 pandemic. This came after Universal reopened its parks in June 2020 and Walt Disney World reopened in July 2020 with capacity modifications, according to the report.

On March 8, 2023, Universal Parks and Resorts CEO Mark Woodbury announced that they would be rebranding the division to &quot;Universal Destinations and Experiences&quot;.

==Current theme parks==
===Universal Studios Hollywood===

Universal Studios Hollywood became the first Universal Studios theme park when it opened its doors on July 15, 1964, long after it was originated as a studio tour in 1915, after the Universal original founder, Carl Laemmle, opened Universal City, California near Los Angeles. In May 1993, Universal CityWalk opened outside the gates of the theme park, featuring 65 entertainment-themed restaurants, nightclubs, shops, and entertainment spots. It also contains Universal Cinema operated by AMC Theatres, offering 19 screens including an IMAX Theatre and stadium-style seating. Approximately is within and around the surrounding area of Universal City, including its theme park and the film studio adjacent nearby.

===Universal Orlando Resort===

Universal Orlando Resort (formerly called Universal Studios Escape) opened to the public on June 7, 1990, in Orlando, Florida, starting at Universal Studios Florida. It features themed areas and attractions based on the film industry.

On May 28, 1999, the Universal Islands of Adventure theme park was opened, featuring various themed islands emphasizing adventures and characters embodied in the attractions, and expanded Universal Orlando into a family vacation resort. Simultaneously, Universal CityWalk was added to accommodate the guests within the resort leading to the two parks. Loews Portofino Bay Hotel opened at Universal Orlando Resort in September 1999, followed by Hard Rock Hotel in December 2000, Loews Royal Pacific Resort in February 2001, Universal&#x27;s Cabana Bay Beach Resort on March 31, 2014, Loews Sapphire Falls Resort on July 7, 2016, and Universal&#x27;s Aventura Hotel on August 16, 2018.

In 1998, Universal Orlando acquired Wet &#x27;n Wild Water Park (founded in 1977 by SeaWorld founder George Millay) and was the company&#x27;s main water park until it closed on December 31, 2016, where it was replaced by another water park Universal Volcano Bay, which opened on May 25, 2017. The new water park consists of 18 attractions, including slides, two lazy rivers and raft rides. The park includes two volcano themed rides: the Ko&#x27;okiri Body Plunge, a 70-degree-angle, 125-foot water slide; and the Krakatau Aqua Coaster, a canoe ride traveling among the peaks and valleys of the central volcano in the park. The park uses a virtual queuing system for most of the attractions, working off of a wristband each guest receives when they enter the park. On the former site of Wet &#x27;n Wild, Universal built two new hotels: Universal&#x27;s Endless Summer Resort – Dockside, and Universal&#x27;s Endless Summer Resort – Surfside.

In August 2019, Universal announced Universal Epic Universe, a third park to include lands such as Super Nintendo World, The Wizarding World of Harry Potter – Ministry of Magic, How to Train Your Dragon: Isle of Berk, and Dark Universe, based on the classic Universal Monsters. The park is scheduled to open on May 22, 2025.

The park will also focus more on wildlife and be more environmentally friendly. Talks are ongoing and there is no time frame as to when construction will begin.

==Cancelled and former parks==
===Cancelled===
*Universal Studios Europe, Melun-Sénart, Seine-et-Marne, France.

Following the establishment of Disney in Europe with the construction of Euro Disney Resort, Universal Studios Recreation Group considered construction of its own park in Europe between the late 1980s and early 1990s. The work was being considered for a site located in either Paris or London. The Rainham Marshes site in east London is abandoned, and later became the Rainham Marshes Nature Reserve. The French state was much more willing to offer tax advantages for the establishment of a park on its territory. A site in Melun-Sénart was chosen, the plans were drawn up, and the land was purchased at agricultural prices in 1971. They covered of arable land in Combs-la-Ville. The theme park&#x27;s construction was planned to commence in 1996, and consist of: a theme park mostly based on Universal Studios Florida, a water park, a golf course, and real estate and commercial areas. The setbacks and financial woes of Euro Disney Resort influenced the realization that this project would not succeed. The group preferred to be the buyer of an already established park, and Universal Studios bought 37% of Port Aventura&#x27;s shares in June 1998.

*Universal Studios, Manila, Philippines
*Universal Studios Dubailand, Dubai, United Arab Emirates (Broke ground 2008, no construction since 2009)
*Universal&#x27;s Hollywoodland, Krefeld, Germany
*Universal Studios Moscow
*Universal Studios South Korea, Hwaseong, South Korea 
Universal Studios was attached to the project in South Korea since 2005 with other competitors of MGM and Paramount. After a long delay, the dealing started in 2016 to open Universal Studios Korea in 2020, but the project was canceled in 2017 due to the several disagreements in dealing.

===Former===

*Universal Mediterránea, Salou, Spain (1998–2004)

Port Aventura opened in 1995. Tussauds Group had a 40.01% in the park while La Caixa had 33.19%, Anheuser-Busch had 19.9% and FECSA had 6.7%. In 1998, the majority of Tussauds Group&#x27; shares in Port Aventura (37%) were sold to Universal Parks &amp; Resorts and the park was rebranded as &#x27;Universal&#x27;s Port Aventura&#x27; in 1999, which made it the first Universal Studios Theme Park in Europe. In 2002, two hotels and a water park (&quot;Costa Caribe&quot;) were constructed, and the resort was rebranded as &#x27;Universal Mediterranea&#x27; the same year. In 2004, NBCUniversal (Universal Studios&#x27; parent) sold all interest in PortAventura to La Caixa. It is owned and operated by La Caixa banking group&#x27;s investment vehicle Criteria, but as of 2005 the Universal name has been dropped from the branding, and the resort was once again named &#x27;PortAventura&#x27; (the space in the name is deliberately left out for trademark reasons).

==Steven Spielberg&#x27;s relationship with Universal Destinations &amp; Experiences==
Director Steven Spielberg has a long-time collaboration with Universal Destinations &amp; Experiences due to his relationship with Universal Studios while working as a Universal intern staff in the late 1960s as well as the films he directed or produced for the studio, such as &quot;Jaws&quot;, &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;, &quot;Back to the Future&quot;, &quot;The Land Before Time&quot;, &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; and &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot;. In March 1987, Spielberg signed on to be a creative consultant for Universal theme parks when the Music Corporation of America (MCA)—then owner of Universal Studios—was planning to build its first full-fledged theme park in Orlando in an effort to compete with Walt Disney World. Universal Parks Chairman and CEO Thomas L. Williams stated in regards to praising the Universal Creative team and a few popular people for the new Florida park:

Since 1987, Spielberg has consulted on a dozen attractions, including E.T. Adventure, Jaws, Jurassic Park: The Ride, and The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man. In exchange, he receives 2% of all park ticket revenue and a portion of park concession receipts generated by Universal theme parks in Florida, Japan, and Singapore in perpetuity, valued at up to $30 to 50 million a year; the Universal Studios Hollywood theme park in Los Angeles is not covered under the Spielberg deal. The director also got the opportunity to trigger a June 2017 exit deal clause and collect a lump sum payment equal to the value of the contracts. Comcast, the current parent company of Universal, acknowledged that this payment could already be worth as much as $535 million. Some analysts predicted that the one-time payment could ultimately be $1 billion. The deal also prevents any film Spielberg worked as a director to go to any rival theme park but Universal; the exception is the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; movies, which Spielberg directed, but with the story entirely created, written, and held by his long-time friend George Lucas, who regularly worked with Disney Experiences as their creative consultant for attractions like Star Tours, &quot;Captain EO&quot;, Indiana Jones Adventure, and Extraterrorestrial Alien Encounter.

<doc id="1345187" wikidata="Q6818329" url="?curid=1345187" title="Mercersburg theology">
<text>Mercersburg theology was a German-American theological movement that began in the mid-19th century. It draws its name from Mercersburg, Pennsylvania, home of Marshall College from 1836 until its merger with Franklin College (Lancaster, Pennsylvania) in 1853, and also home to the seminary of the Reformed Church in the United States (RCUS) from 1837 until its relocation to Lancaster in 1871.

== History ==

Although the seminary existed prior to 1844, Mercersburg Theology began in earnest in that year with the hiring of Philip Schaff to join John Williamson Nevin on staff at the seminary. Schaff sparked off controversy with his inaugural address, which was later published as &quot;Principle of Protestantism&quot;. This led to a series of articles written against Professor Schaff’s view by fellow RCUS pastor Joseph Berg. Several other magazines attacked Schaff and Nevin over their controversial position concerning the relation of the Reformed churches to the Roman Catholic Church. The RCUS was divided on the issue, as the Philadelphia Classis condemned Schaff’s theology, while the East Pennsylvania Classis defended it. The Synod took up the issue in 1845 and cleared Schaff and &quot;Principle of Protestantism&quot; by a vote of 37 to 3. This marked the only time Schaff was brought before the Synod on heresy charges; the Synod ruled that further complaints had to be registered with the Board of Visitors (trustees) of the Mercersburg Seminary, which never allowed any more complaints to go before the Synod for trial.

The controversy did not end with the clearing of Professor Schaff, however. Professor Nevin published &quot;The Mystical Presence&quot;, a book about the Lord&#x27;s Supper, in 1846. Nevin argued for an objective efficacy in the sacrament and that the atonement is brought about by the person of Christ, rather than his work. This brought about many reactions both from inside and outside the church, with the most famous critiques made by Joseph Berg and later by Professor Charles Hodge of Princeton Seminary, the latter a confessional Presbyterian. Spokesmen for both sides in the debate claimed fidelity to, and continuation of, the Reformed tradition. Nevin and Schaff advanced the movement further when they began the &quot;Mercersburg Review&quot; periodical in 1849. The publication provoked the departure of several prominent RCUS ministers and churches, including Joseph Berg in 1851, as well as the Germantown Reformed Church and its pastor Jacob Helfenstein, and the entire North Carolina Classis, all in 1853.

During the 1850s the RCUS also fought over the use of a liturgy. In general the Mercersburg men favored the new liturgy, which they helped write with Nevin on the committee, and the &quot;Old Reformed Party&quot; (the opponents), rejected it as innovative and as contrary to Reformed doctrine. The controversy, which came perilously close to causing a schism between the factions, continued until 1878, when the General Synod established a peace commission. The General Synod of 1884 approved a liturgy that was approved by the required number of Classes (first-level judicatories, equivalent to presbyteries). The controversy between the two parties ended in a compromise liturgy, and with each side having its own educational institutions: Mercersburg Seminary and Franklin and Marshall College for the Mercersburg Movement, and Ursinus College for the Old Reformed Party.

In 1866 Samuel Miller wrote a defense of Mercersburg theology over and against Modernist theology, which he saw as a threat. He argued that Mercersburg theology assumes certain innate truths which apply to all people at all times in all places, while Modernist theology was rationalistic and depended on empirical and rationalist evidences to rest its foundational beliefs upon, which inevitably leads to infidelity.

By the early 20th century, though, much of the controversy had been rendered moot by three factors. First, the rise of the strongly Protestant neo-orthodox movement among scholars and some RCUS clergy gained ascendence over the romanticism and metaphysics on which Mercersburg was largely based. Second, the resistance to at least modest liturgical innovations by some Old Reformed parishes gradually disappeared under the influence of the ecumenical liturgical movement. Finally, the RCUS&#x27; merger with the Evangelical Synod of North America in 1934 brought a significant pietist constituency to the new denomination, as well as a more mediating approach to doctrine, thereby reducing the polemical style of past generations.

The seminary continues to this day (under the name Lancaster Theological Seminary), and its theology and influence still continue today, albeit in moderation, in congregations of the United Church of Christ descended from Reformed congregations which carried out the party&#x27;s platform.

== Theology ==

John Nevin summarized the Mercersburg Theology, or Movement, by saying, &quot;Its cardinal principle is the fact of the Incarnation.&quot; He explained that by adding, &quot;Christ saves the world, not ultimately by what He teaches or by what He does, but by what He is in the constitution of His own person.&quot; Nevin&#x27;s most popular work was &quot;The Mystical Presence,&quot; a study of the doctrine of the Lord&#x27;s Supper.

Another significant aspect of the Mercersburg Theology is the view of history and theology found in Philip Schaff&#x27;s &quot;Principle of Protestantism.&quot; In this work, Schaff takes a Hegelian model of history and applies it to the history of theology. Theology must come to one final synthesis, as Schaff expressed in his remark that &quot;the Reformation must be regarded as still incomplete. It needs yet its concluding act to unite what has fallen asunder, to bring the subjective to a reconciliation with the objective.&quot; By this, he proposes a reunion of the subjective doctrines of Protestantism with the objective character of the Roman Catholic Church. Thus, an outworking of this belief is a generous ecumenism extended toward all, especially toward Roman Catholics. Another contributor to the Hegelian approach of Mercersburg Theology was Friederich Augustus Rauch, especially through his work &quot;Psychology&quot;.

A more objective liturgy was advocated by both of these founding principles of Mercersburg Theology, and all the major adherents of the movement favored an altar-based liturgy as opposed to pulpit-centered worship, i.e., centered on a lengthy sermon. This included more formal prayers, an altar rather than a table for the Lord&#x27;s Supper, and a sacramental sensibility. These changes represent a movement in the direction of Lutheranism.

The Merscersburg Society was founded in 1983 to maintain the sacramental and ecclesial approach of the theology. It publishes &quot;The New Mercersburg Review&quot; and holds an annual summer convocation. In 2012 Wipf and Stock began publishing critical, annotated editions of major works of Schaff, Nevin and their associates in &quot;The Mercersburg Theology Study Series&quot;. Twelve volumes had been published by 2024.

== Characteristic ==

Most distinctive is the idealist hermeneutic which stood (and stands) in contrast to the common sense realism of Hodge and subsequent American Reformed theology, i.e. Nevin starts with the whole before the parts, and the whole is indeed greater than the sum of the parts. Within this hermeneutical context, Mercersburg also prioritizes the Incarnation as a theological lens which - as one might suppose - has vast theological implications. The result is a thoroughgoing ecclesiology and sacramentology that opposes a number of theological dualisms and heavily forensic soteriologies.

<doc id="1345188" wikidata="Q221081" url="?curid=1345188" title="Ar-Rum">
<text>Ar-Rum () is the 30th chapter (sūrah) of the Quran, consisting of 60 verses (āyāt). The term &quot;Rūm&quot; originated in the word &quot;Roman&quot;, and during the time of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, it referred to the Eastern Roman Empire; the title is also sometimes translated as &quot;The Greeks&quot; or &quot;The Byzantines&quot;.

The surah references the Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628 and specifically the Sasanian conquest of Jerusalem in 614. Both sides of that war would later become military opponents of the early Muslims. Within Muhammad&#x27;s own lifetime, Muslim and Byzantine forces would clash in the earliest battle of the Arab–Byzantine wars, and the Muslim conquest of Persia led to the downfall of the Sasanian Empire by the middle of the 7th century.

==Summary==
The chapter begins by noting the recent defeat of the Byzantine Empire to the Sasanian Empire in Jerusalem, near the Dead Sea. This defeat posed a significant theological and sociological problem for the early Muslim community because the Byzantines were Christians (considered to be &quot;People of the Book&quot; from the Islamic viewpoint) while the Sassanids who defeated them were Zoroastrians. Ar-Rum is in part a response to the non-Muslim Arab Meccans, who took the Sassanid victory as a sign that the traditional polytheistic practices would win out over the monotheism of the Abrahamic religions. In the third and fourth verses, the Muslim community is promised that the Byzantines will reverse their defeat into a victory and retake Jerusalem &quot;in a few years&#x27; time&quot;.

Muslims believe this prophecy was fulfilled with Heraclius&#x27; campaign of 622, a Byzantine military counter-offensive that resulted in a crushing defeat for the Sassanids in Anatolia, and cite it as an example of the miraculous nature of the Quran.

==Chronology==
Regarding the timing and contextual background of the revelation (&quot;asbāb al-nuzūl&quot;), it is an earlier &quot;Meccan surah&quot;, which means it is believed to have been revealed in Mecca, instead of later in Medina. Parts of Q30:38-50 are preserved in the Ṣan‘ā’1 lower text.

According to Theodor Nöldeke, the surah of ar-Rum was the second-to-last Meccan surah and the 84th surah chronologically; however, he argues its 17th ayah was revealed during the Medinan period. While the first ayah of the surah refers to the defeat of the Byzantine Empire at the hands of the Sasanian Empire near Damascus in the spring of 614. 

According to al-Tabari, it refers to the Battle of Adhri&#x27;at in 614, but this battle is ignored in other sources.

==Literary units==

In his tafsir, entitled &quot;In the Shade of the Qur&#x27;an&quot;, Sayyid Qutb divides the surah into two halves, verses 1–32 and verses 33–60. Each section begins with an assertion of God&#x27;s grace and mercy and ends with encouragement for Muhammad and his community.

;First Section: &quot;Signs to Reflect Upon&quot;
* &quot;The Natural Bond of Faith&quot; Notes the Byzantine defeat and prophesies a coming victory promised by God
* &quot;To Whom Power Belongs&quot; Declares the truth of the universe
* &quot;Invitation to Reflect&quot; Reminds the believers of the fates of other disobedient communities
* &quot;Two Divergent Wars&quot; Describes the Last Judgment
* &quot;Scene of God&#x27;s Glory&quot;, &quot;The Cycle of Life and Death&quot;, and &quot;Man and the Universe&quot; Offers praise for God and all His powers and signs
* &quot;Analogy Drawn from Human Life&quot; Uses a metaphor about slavery to condemn the sin of shirk
* &quot;Concluding Directive to Prophet&quot; Urges the listeners to turn to the truth and resist dividing into sects

;Second Section: &quot;Bringing Life out of the Dead&quot;
* &quot;Vacillating Conditions&quot; Reassures the Muslim community of God&#x27;s mercy and grace for true believers and offers suggestions for behavior like giving to the needy or avoiding usury
* &quot;Corruption and Pollution&quot; Reminds people of the promise of resurrection at the Last Judgment and the fates of polytheist communities
* &quot;Aspects of God&#x27;s Grace&quot; Emphasizes resurrection as one of signs of God&#x27;s mercy and grace when believers lose hope
* &quot;The Different Stages of Man&#x27;s Life&quot; Describes the weakness and folly of man and the fate of evildoers at the Last Judgment
* &quot;No Change of Position&quot; Decries the nonbelievers who refuse to listen to Muhammad but asserts that God leads astray who he wills
* Urges Muhammad and his community to persevere

==Major themes==
The main theme of this surah is the contrast between monotheism and polytheism. In addition to making logical arguments against ascribing partners to God, several verses outline the differing fate for idolaters and believers. The unity of God is also emphasized with descriptions of the glory of God through illustrations of His wondrous signs and His miraculous creation. This means that the main lessons of this surah is not to make partners to Allah, and to always have the fate of a believer.

==Sample verse==
Surah 30 includes a verse comparing the association of partners with God, which is the sin of shirk, to the relationship between a master and his slaves.

<text>The Hippodrome is a building on the corner of Cranbourn Street and Charing Cross Road in the City of Westminster, London. The name was used for many different theatres and music halls, of which the London Hippodrome is one of only a few survivors. &quot;&quot; is an archaic word referring to places that host horse races and other forms of equestrian entertainment.

==History==
===Hippodrome===
The London Hippodrome was opened in 1900. It was designed by Frank Matcham for Moss Empires chaired by Edward Moss and built for £250,000 as a hippodrome for circus and variety performances. The venue gave its first show on 15 January 1900, a music hall revue entitled &quot;Giddy Ostend&quot; with Little Tich. The conductor was Georges Jacobi.

Entry to the venue was through a bar, dressed as a ship&#x27;s saloon. The performance space featured both a proscenium stage and an arena that sank into a 230 ft, 100,000 gallon water tank (about 400 tons, when full) for aquatic spectacles. The tank featured eight central fountains, and a circle of fountains around the side. Entrances at the side of the auditorium could also be flooded, and used for the entry of boats. Shows included equestrian acts, elephants and polar bears, and acrobats would dive from a minstrels&#x27; gallery above a sliding roof, in the centre of the proscenium arch. The auditorium featured cantilevered galleries, removing the columns that often obstructed views in London theatres, the whole was covered by a painted glass retractable roof, that could be illuminated at night. The building included the headquarters of Moss Empires.

===Theatre 1909–1951===
In 1909, it was reconstructed by Matcham as a music-hall and variety theatre with 1340 seats in stalls, mezzanine, gallery and upper gallery levels. It was here that in 1910 Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Swan Lake&quot; received its English première in the form of Act 2 with Olga Preobajinska as the Swan Queen. The Albert de Courville revues were performed here from December 1912.

The Hippodrome hosted the first official jazz gig in the United Kingdom, by the Original Dixieland Jazz Band, in 1919.

Its reputation was for revue and musical comedy, among them &quot;The Five O&#x27;Clock Girl&quot;, the West End production of Vincent Youmans&#x27; hit Broadway musical &quot;Hit The Deck&quot; (1928) and also &quot;Mr. Cinders&quot;, both in 1929; Ivor Novello&#x27;s &quot;Perchance to Dream&quot; in 1945 with Margaret Rutherford; and the revue &quot;High Spirits&quot; in 1953 with Cyril Ritchard and Diana Churchill. Julie Andrews made her stage debut here at the age of 12. From 1949 to 1951 it was the London equivalent of the Folies Bergère.

===The Talk of the Town===
The original interior was demolished in 1958, and Bernard Delfont had the Hippodrome converted into the nightclub The Talk of the Town. It featured appearances by many of the popular artistes of the time, including Diana Ross &amp; The Supremes, Judy Garland, Eartha Kitt, Shirley Bassey, The Temptations, Frank Sinatra, Mel Torme, Sammy Davis Jr., Lena Horne, Sergio Franchi, Sophie Tucker, Engelbert Humperdinck, Dusty Springfield, Val Doonican, Lonnie Donegan, The Carpenters, John Denver, Ella Fitzgerald, Liza Minnelli, Tom Jones, Cleo Laine, The Jackson 5, Buddy Rich, Lulu, Danny La Rue, Cilla Black, Petula Clark, Paul Anka, Glen Campbell, Anne Murray, Sandie Shaw, Johnnie Ray, Matt Monro, The Andrews Sisters, Dolores Gray, Frankie Vaughan, Cliff Richard, The Shadows, Channing Pollock (magician), Dionne Warwick, Raphael, The Seekers, Stevie Wonder, Sacha Distel and Neil Sedaka.

In February 1964, Ethel Merman made her only British appearance in a season of cabaret. Dusty Springfield recorded a TV special at the venue, broadcast 15 February 1968 on BBC2 &quot;Show of the Week: Live at the Talk of the Town&quot;. The Seekers&#x27; final concert was recorded for the album &quot;The Seekers Live at The Talk of the Town&quot; in July 1968. Tony Bennett set his 1972 series for Thames Television, &quot;Tony Bennett at the Talk of the Town&quot;, there. This form of entertainment, in its turn, fell out of public favour, and the venue closed in 1982.

In 2009, the Hippodrome was named by the Brecon Jazz Festival as one of 12 venues which had made the most important contributions to jazz music in the United Kingdom.

The musical drama &quot;End of the Rainbow&quot;, nominated for a number of Olivier Awards in 2011 during its London run and Tony Awards in 2012 while on Broadway, is set at the Talk of The Town during a Judy Garland engagement there near the end of her life.

===The London Hippodrome===
Renovated yet again, the building was reopened as a nightclub/restaurant called The London Hippodrome by nightclub tycoon Peter Stringfellow in 1983. Some years later, Stringfellow sold it to a chain company called European Leisure. Under the stewardship of David Chipping the club went on to win many BEDA and DI awards, regularly attracting crowds in excess of 2,000. Following its sale to Luminar, the club soon went out of fashion. It was not until April 2004 that the Hippodrome regained its standing, when it was transformed into Cirque at the Hippodrome. The interior was taken back to hues of reds and golds, and burlesque was the theme. Cirque at the Hippodrome won the BEDA award for best UK nightclub in 2004.

It was reported in October 2005 that the club had lost its public drinks licence and would no longer be able to serve alcohol, as the local police did not want what they called &quot;vertical drinking&quot; (the majority of patrons standing rather than sitting) in Leicester Square. The police also shut down most of the venues in the local area. Following this, in December 2005, the club was eventually forced to close, following reports of violence involving rival gangs after they had left the building of the Hippodrome, which reflected on its closure later in Westminster licensing court.

===The Hippodrome Events Space &amp; Theatre ===
In January 2006, entrepreneur Charmaine Haig took over the lease of the Hippodrome building on a short term before a casino licence application could be secured for future use. Haig initially maintained and managed the empty venue on her own, and then changed the venue&#x27;s name back to the London Hippodrome from its previous name of Cirque.

Shortly afterward, Haig&#x27;s in-house events company, Hip Events, began running private events in the venue, but once again using the space to its full capacity as a variety venue with album launches, dance shows, gala dinners, awards ceremonies and Leicester Square film premiere after parties.

In 2008, Haig and her business partner acquired a theatre licence for the venue and subsequently turned the venue back into a theatre. The adult cabaret show &quot;La Clique&quot; was found at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in August 2008; by the beginning of October 2008, the show previewed at the London Hippodrome with great success, and stayed running until the end of Haig&#x27;s Hippodrome lease in June 2009. During this time, the show &quot;La Clique&quot; at the Hippodrome won an Olivier Award in 2009, in the &quot;Best Entertainment&quot; category.

===The Hippodrome Casino===
In 2009, the lease on the Hippodrome was acquired by Leicester-born father and son entrepreneurs Jimmy and Simon Thomas, who began an extensive restoration programme taking the Hippodrome back to Matcham&#x27;s original designs for use as a casino and entertainment venue. During the planning stage, the adjacent Cranbourn Mansions building became available and plans were redrafted to incorporate this former gentlemen&#x27;s apartment block into the design, doubling the eventual floorspace and linked using a new structure sited within the existing light well between the two buildings.

Investment in the building reportedly came to over £40 million, the funds being raised by the Thomas family from the sale of a number of bingo halls prior to the UK smoking ban, which made it illegal to smoke within an enclosed workplace, on 1 July 2007.

The Hippodrome Casino was opened on 13 July 2012 by Mayor of London Boris Johnson, who described it as &quot;yet another ringing endorsement of London as a great place to invest&quot;.

The venue on opening included four floors of gaming, including a Gold Room casino sited in the original basement with access directly into Chinatown to the rear of the building, Heliot restaurant, six bars, a smoking terrace and The Matcham Room cabaret theatre. The restoration and construction of the casino was followed on the blog of LBC presenter Steve Allen.

In January 2013 the casino was awarded Best Land-based Casino at the Totally Gaming Awards, which also gave Jimmy Thomas a Life Achievement award for his contribution to the gaming and entertainment industries.

On 4 March 2013, Simon Thomas announced the opening of PokerStars LIVE, a collaboration between the Hippodrome and PokerStars, the world&#x27;s largest online poker website. While initially on the fourth floor, in 2020 PokerStars LIVE moved to the third floor where it currently resides.

The Matcham Room at the Hippodrome Casino mounted a production of the wartime musical &quot;Miss Nightingale&quot; in 2018, and is currently the home of Magic Mike Live London (created and produced by Channing Tatum).

In 2020, construction was completed on an expansion of the fourth floor smoking area to include gaming, and the creation of &#x27;The Rooftop&#x27;, a new bar and dining space, on the fifth floor.

<doc id="1345191" wikidata="Q907177" url="?curid=1345191" title="Pseudoskepticism">
<text>Pseudoskepticism (also spelled as pseudoscepticism) is a philosophical or scientific position that appears to be that of skepticism or scientific skepticism but in reality is a form of dogmatism.

==Nineteenth and early twentieth centuries==
An early use of the word was in self-denigration: on 31 August 1869, Swiss philosopher Henri-Frédéric Amiel wrote in his diary:
It soon acquired its usual meaning where a claimed skeptic is accused of excessive sureness in turning initial doubts into certainties. In 1908 Henry Louis Mencken wrote on Friedrich Nietzsche&#x27;s criticism of philosopher David Strauss that:
Professor of Philosophy at the University of Illinois, Frederick L. Will used the term &quot;pseudo-skepticism&quot; in 1942. Alasdair MacIntyre writes:
Notre Dame Professor of English, John E. Sitter used the term in 1977 in a discussion of Alexander Pope: &quot;Pope&#x27;s intent, I believe, is to chasten the reader&#x27;s skepticism — the pseudo-skepticism of the overly confident &#x27;you&#x27; ... &quot;

==Truzzi==
In 1987, Marcello Truzzi revived the term specifically for arguments which use scientific-sounding language to disparage or refute given beliefs, theories, or claims, but which in fact fail to follow the precepts of conventional scientific skepticism. He argued that scientific skepticism is agnostic to new ideas, making no claims about them but waiting for them to satisfy a burden of proof before granting them validity. Pseudoskepticism, by contrast, involves &quot;negative hypotheses&quot;—theoretical assertions that some belief, theory, or claim is factually wrong—without satisfying the burden of proof that such negative theoretical assertions would require.

In 1987, while working as a professor of sociology at Eastern Michigan University, Truzzi gave the following description of pseudoskeptics in the journal &quot;Zetetic Scholar&quot; (which he founded):
Truzzi attributed the following characteristics to pseudoskeptics:
#Denying, when only doubt has been established
#Double standards in the application of criticism
#The tendency to discredit rather than investigate
#Presenting insufficient evidence or proof
#Assuming criticism requires no burden of proof
#Making unsubstantiated counter-claims
#Counter-claims based on plausibility rather than empirical evidence
#Suggesting that unconvincing evidence provides grounds for completely dismissing a claim

He characterized true skepticism as:
#Acceptance of doubt when neither assertion nor denial has been established
#No burden of proof to take an agnostic position
#Agreement that the corpus of established knowledge must be based on what is proved, but recognising its incompleteness
#Even-handedness in requirement for proofs, whatever their implication
#Accepting that a failure of a proof in itself proves nothing
#Continuing examination of the results of experiments even when flaws are found

== Subsequent usage ==
Susan Blackmore, who lost her initial belief in parapsychology and in 1991 became a CSICOP fellow, later described what she termed the &quot;worst kind of pseudoskepticism&quot;:
Hugo Anthony Meynell from the Department of Religious Studies at the University of Calgary, labels the &quot;extreme position that all significant evidence supporting paranormal phenomena is a result of deception or lies&quot; as pseudoskepticism.

While Truzzi&#x27;s characterization was aimed at the holders of majority views whom he considered were excessively impatient of minority opinions, the term has been used to describe advocates of minority intellectual positions who engage in pseudoskeptical behavior when they characterize themselves as &quot;skeptics&quot; despite cherry picking evidence that conforms to a preexisting belief. Thus according to Richard Cameron Wilson, some advocates of AIDS denial are indulging in &quot;bogus scepticism&quot; when they argue in this way. Wilson argues that the characteristic feature of false skepticism is that it &quot;centres not on an impartial search for the truth, but on the defence of a preconceived ideological position&quot;. Examples include climate change denial and Moon landing denial.

<doc id="1345200" wikidata="Q229842" url="?curid=1345200" title="As-Sajdah">
<text> (السجدة), is the 32nd chapter (&quot;sūrah&quot;) of the Quran with 30 verses (&quot;āyāt&quot;). The name of the chapter has been translated as ۩ &#x27;prostration&#x27; or &#x27;adoration&#x27; and is taken from the fifteenth verse, which mentions those who &quot;... fall prostrate and hymn the praise of their Lord&quot;.

Regarding the timing and contextual background of the believed revelation, it is an earlier &quot;Meccan surah&quot;, which means it is believed revealed in Mecca, instead of later in Medina. Theodor Nöldeke (d.1930), translator of Tabari (Arabic – German), estimated it as the 70th (Nöldeke chronology). The traditional Egyptian chronology puts the chapter as the 75th chapter by the order of revelation (after Quran 23).

==Summary==
The first half of the chapter covers some of Islam&#x27;s theological concepts, including revelation, God, creation of human beings, resurrection and the judgment day. The second half discusses the contrast between those who &quot;fall prostrate&quot; before God and those who &quot;turn away&quot; from God&#x27;s sign. The chapter then mentions the Children of Israel as an example of people who follow God&#x27;s guidance through Moses.

==Ayat (verses)==

* 22 To reject God&#x27;s signs a great sin
* 23 The Pentateuch given to Moses
* 24 Teachers chosen from among the Israelites to direct them in the way of God
* 25 God will settle their disputes in the Judgement Day
* 26 The people of Makkah warned by the fate of their predecessors
* 27 The resurrection typified in nature, but infidels do not understand
* 28-30 The infidels urge Muhammad to hasten the judgment-day 

== Quranic commentary==

A hadith, narrated in the Tafsir of ibn Kathir (d.1373), said that Muhammad often recited &quot;As-Sajda&quot; together with &quot;Al-Insan&quot; (Quran 76) for the early morning prayer (&quot;fajr&quot;) every Friday. al-Alusi (d.1854), amongst others confirmed another report stating that Muhammad often recited the chapter before going to sleep.

Al-Suyuti (d.1505) named the chapter “Sūrah of the Beds,” (&quot;sūrat al-maḍājiʿ&quot;) after a mention of those who &quot;shun [their] beds&quot; in order to worship God at night (&quot;tahajjud&quot;). Other names of the chapter include the choice of Al-Qurtubi (d.1274): &quot;Alif Lam Mim Tanzil&quot; (&quot;Alif, Lam, Mim, The Revelation&quot;) after the first words from verses 1 and 2.

According to the Islamic tradition, the chapter was revealed during the Meccan phase of Muhammad&#x27;s prophethood. Some scholars argue, based on attaching occasions of revelations (&quot;asbāb al-nuzūl&quot;), that several verses (some say verses 16–20, some say only 18–20, some say only 16) are from Medinan phase, but the arguments are not widely accepted. For example, Mahmud al-Alusi opines that the close connection between these verses and the preceding ones means that they are likely from the same period.

<doc id="1345201" wikidata="Q14864935" url="?curid=1345201" title="Clusterin">
<text>In humans, clusterin (CLU) is encoded by the &quot;CLU&quot; gene on chromosome 8. CLU is an extracellular molecular chaperone which binds to misfolded proteins in body fluids to neutralise their toxicity and mediate their cellular uptake by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Once internalised by cells, complexes between CLU and misfolded proteins are trafficked to lysosomes where they are degraded. CLU is involved in many diseases including neurodegenerative diseases, cancers, inflammatory diseases, and aging.

==Structure==

The &quot;CLU&quot; gene contains nine exons and a variety of mRNA isoforms can be detected, although most of these are only ever expressed at very low levels (&lt; 0.3% of the total). The full-length mRNA encoding the secreted isoform is by far the dominant species transcribed. Secreted CLU (apolipoprotein J) is an approximately 60 kDa disulfide-linked heterodimeric glycoprotein which migrates in SDS-PAGE with an apparent molecular mass of 75-80 kDa. Mature CLU is composed of disulfide-linked α- and β-chains. Although multiple previous publications proposed the existence of N-terminally truncated CLU protein isoforms in different cell compartments, recent work has highlighted the lack of direct evidence for this and shown that the full-length CLU polypeptide, with variable levels of glycosylation (and hence variable apparent mass), can translocate from the ER/Golgi to the cytosol and nucleus during stress. 

== Function ==

Clusterin was first identified in ram rete testis fluid where it was shown to elicit in vitro clustering of rat Sertoli cells and erythrocytes, hence its name.

CLU has functional similarities to members of the small heat shock protein family and is thus a molecular chaperone. Unlike most other chaperone proteins, which aid intracellular proteins, CLU is trafficked through the ER/Golgi before normally being secreted. Within the secretory system, CLU has been suggested to facilitate the folding of secreted proteins in an ATP-independent way. The gene is highly conserved in species, and the protein is widely distributed in many tissues and organs, where it been implicated in a number of biological processes, including lipid transport, membrane recycling, cell adhesion, programmed cell death, and complement-mediated cell lysis. Overexpression of secretory CLU can protect cells from apoptosis induced by cellular stress, such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or androgen/estrogen depletion. CLU has been suggested to promote cell survival by a number of means, including inhibition of BAX on the mitochondrial membrane, activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B pathway, modulation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 signaling and matrix metallopeptidase-9 expression, promotion of angiogenesis, and mediation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway. Meanwhile, its downregulation allows for p53 activation, which then skews the proapoptotic:antiapoptotic ratio of present Bcl-2 family members, resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death. p53 may also transcriptionally repress secretory CLU to further promote the proapoptotic cascade.

== Clinical associations ==
Two independent genome-wide association studies found a statistical association between a SNP within the clusterin gene and the risk of having Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Further studies have suggested that people who already have Alzheimer&#x27;s disease have more clusterin in their blood, and that clusterin levels in blood correlate with faster cognitive decline in individuals with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, but have not found that clusterin levels predicted the onset of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. In addition to Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, CLU may be involved in other neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington disease.

CLU may promote tumorigenesis by facilitating BAX-KLU70 binding and, consequently, preventing BAX from localizing to the outer mitochondrial membrane to stimulate cell death. In clear cell renal cell carcinoma, CLU functions to regulate ERK 1/2 signaling and matrix metallopeptidase-9 expression to promote tumor cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. In epithelial ovarian cancer, CLU has been observed to promote angiogenesis and chemoresistance. Other pathways CLU participates in to downplay apoptosis in tumor cells include the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and NF-κB pathway. Unlike most other cancers, which feature upregulated CLU levels to enhance tumor cell survival, testicular seminoma features downregulated CLU levels, allowing for increased sensitivity to chemotherapy treatments. Other cancers CLU has been implicated in include breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and melanoma.

As evident by its key roles in cancer development, CLU can serve as a therapeutic target for fighting tumor growth and chemoresistance. Studies revealed that inhibition of CLU resulted in increased effectiveness of chemotherapeutic agents to kill tumor cells. In particular, custirsen, an antisense oligonucleotide that blocks the CLU mRNA transcript, enhanced heat-shock protein 90 (HSP90) inhibitor activity by suppressing the heat-shock response in castrate-resistant prostate cancer, and was tested in phase III trials.

CLU activity is also involved in infectious diseases, such as hepatitis C. CLU is induced by the stress of hepatitis C viral infection, which disrupts glucose regulation. The chaperone protein then aids hepatitis C viral assembly by stabilizing its core and NS5A units. In addition to the above diseases, CLU has been linked to other conditions resulting from oxidative damage, including aging, glomerulonephritis, atherosclerosis, and myocardial infarction. 

== Interactions ==

CLU has been shown to interact with many different protein ligands and several cell receptors.

<doc id="1345203" wikidata="Q1622428" url="?curid=1345203" title="Queen Elizabeth Hall">
<text>The Queen Elizabeth Hall (QEH) is a music venue on the South Bank in London, England, that hosts classical, jazz, and avant-garde music, talks and dance performances. It was opened in 1967, with a concert conducted by Benjamin Britten.

The QEH was built along with the smaller Purcell Room as part of Southbank Centre arts complex. It stands alongside the Royal Festival Hall, which was built for the Festival of Britain of 1951, and the Hayward Gallery which opened in 1968.
==History==
The QEH stands on the site of a former shot tower, built as part of a lead works in 1826 and retained for the Festival of Britain. The QEH and the Purcell Room were built together by Higgs and Hill and opened in March 1967.

The venue was closed for two years of renovations in September 2015, and reopened in April 2018.

==Description==

The QEH has over 900 seats and the Purcell Room in the same building has 360 seats. The two auditoriums were designed by a team led by Hubert Bennett, head of the architects department of the Greater London Council, with Jack Whittle, F.G. West and Geoffrey Horsefall. They form part of the Southbank Centre arts complex along with the larger Royal Festival Hall (RFH) and an art gallery, the Hayward Gallery (opened in October 1968).

The sculpture &quot;Zemran&quot; in stainless steel (by William Pye, 1972) stands on the riverside terrace of the QEH.

== Architecture ==

=== Introduction ===
The design of the QEH was intended to show to a high degree the separate masses and elements of the building, to avoid competing with the scale and presence of the RFH. The QEH uses minimal decoration and was designed to allow circulation at multiple levels around the building. The focus is primarily on the internal spaces, which as originally designed had very limited fenestration except for the (deeply inset) sweep along the river frontage of the foyer building.

The original arrangements provided for circulation above and below the foyer (no longer allowed for security reasons, although the roof terrace has been opened for the Summer of Fun festival in 2011), right around the sides and rear of the two auditoriums, and also a bridge link to the Hayward Gallery. The powerful forms and austere materials are an example of brutalist architecture, and the design also highlights the plasticity of concrete.

=== Foyer ===

The foyer is at first-floor level, and the foyer building is supported on octagonal reinforced concrete columns, with an undercroft below, and is vee-shaped. The two arms of the vee-shape are linked to the QEH auditorium by cast concrete tubes, reminiscent of a spaceship&#x27;s docking arrangement. The provision of only two entrances to the auditorium causes congestion and slow exit for audiences. This is also a consequence of the decision to place all the foyer facilities on a single level, even though there is a significant descent to the auditorium entrance level, and steps are required up to the Purcell Room level. The foyer is an irregular shape to accommodate the angle between the axes of Waterloo Bridge and the north-east side of the RFH.

A notable feature of the QEH is the interior of the foyer building, with its intimate scale and subtle use of materials, and the terrace overlooking Queen&#x27;s Walk. The original 1960s cool of this area had been largely lost owing to the intrusion of artificial partitions, to provide smaller areas for various activities by day as well as in the evening, in the 2000s. The extensive foyer was restored during the renovation works of 2016-18, with better integration of access for persons of reduced mobility. The bar area was extended to the south onto part of the external terrace with new glazing to bring more light into the foyer.

The main entrance to the foyer is from walkway level near the north end of the terrace of the RFH. To see the intended effect this should be viewed head-on from the north corner of the RFH. The entrance, in brutalist style, is in the form of a horizontal slit in the concrete structure, with six pairs of cast aluminium doors.

A smaller entrance is provided at ground level, originally intended to be for visitors set down by car (circulation of traffic under the Waterloo Bridge approach was possible before the Museum of the Moving Image building was constructed in the 1980s) or coming from the car park under the Hayward Gallery. This entrance also appears to have led to the undercroft, but that access is now blocked off. An internal staircase leads to the foyer level from this lower entrance, past the original box office area. Lavatories take up the south-east wall of the foyer building, and are housed in a structure extending out towards the centre access road. 
The building&#x27;s appearance works best by night, especially when approached from the eastern one of Golden Jubilee Footbridges beside Hungerford Bridge.

After being closed for many years, the roof terrace and bridge to the Hayward Gallery were reopened in 2011, with the creation of a new external gallery and a roof garden and café, in partnership with the Eden Project in Cornwall. This reopened one of the most interesting pedestrian circulation possibilities of the original design. The roof terrace is reached by the external concrete staircase at the west corner on Queen&#x27;s Walk near Festival Pier, which also leads to the lower level and the route to Festival Square. A crude disabled ramp, constructed of breeze blocks and bricks, has been added to the walkway between the QEH entrance and the Hayward Gallery.

=== Auditorium ===
The QEH auditorium is a separate building from the foyer. The auditorium building is aligned with the rear of its stage parallel to Waterloo Bridge and the seating area cantilevered out towards the foyer, supported by a massive column containing the emergency escape staircases at the rear.

The north-west facade, by Waterloo Bridge, although stained by pollution and rainwater, is a good example of the massive concrete forms popular in 1960s brutalist architecture in Britain. A slightly raised area, resembling a low stage is provided facing Waterloo Bridge. This may have been intended for outdoor performances.

A great concrete &quot;prow&quot;, encasing the air conditioning ducting, protrudes towards the Thames along the side of the auditorium at roof level. The walkway area below this feature is on the roof of a utility building, and a branch of the restaurant chain Wahaca has been installed in a set of containers there, in 2012. Ventilation services are provided from a plant room on the roof of the Purcell Room via a massive concrete duct between the buildings leading into the QEH roof, and a concrete tower leading to the concrete duct on the north-east edge of the foyer building roof.

The acoustic properties of the Queen Elizabeth Hall are judged to be generally excellent. The acoustical properties of the Hall when examined in 1968 by music critics and engineers following a period of testing, trials and adjustment, were found to be of &quot;general excellence&quot; in the three key areas of: 
a) Reverberation Time, which in this Hall is mainly adjusted by opening and closing cavities in the vertical wood panels on both sides, b) Tone and Definition, by allowing diffusion with minimum use of deflectors over the seating area rather than the platform, and finally 
c) &#x27;Singing&#x27; Tone produced here as in all excellent halls by a substantial height of the auditorium which, in the QEH&#x27;s case, although the rear stalls are steeply raked, the ceiling is above the highest seats to the ceiling. (Trends in Concert-Hall Acoustics and the Elizabeth Hall C. L. S. Gilford &quot;The Musical Times&quot; Vol. 109 No 1499 Jan. 1968)

There have inevitably been many alterations and adaptation of the Hall, particularly in recent years, involving increasing the size of the platform and rigging extra specialised lighting arrays which allow the staging of dance and comedy productions. This had adversely impacted on the Hall&#x27;s acoustics, in particular in the area of tone and definition by increasing deflection in the platform area. As part of the refurbishment work of 2015-18, a retracting gantry was provided at ceiling level reducing this intrusion when not required.

=== The undercroft ===

The undercroft of the foyer building has been popular with skateboarders since the early 1970s and it is widely acknowledged to be London&#x27;s most distinctive and popular skateboarding area. Opened in 1967 as a pedestrian walkway, it was first used by skateboarders in 1973 as the architectural features were found to be perfect for skateboard tricks. Unlike skateparks which are designed specifically with skateboarding and BMX in mind, the undercroft is not a skatepark but a found space, and still considered by the users as a street spot. The area is now used by skateboarders, BMXers, graffiti artists, taggers, photographers, and performance artists, among others. A photographic archive of the graffiti can be found at The Graffiti Archaeology Project. Although this informal activity, social and arts scene is a distinctive feature of the Southbank Centre site, it was proposed that the area would be redeveloped. However a statement from the Prime Minister&#x27;s office (reported in &quot;Time Out&quot;, in August 2008) cited the importance of the undercroft for these uses.

The Southbank Centre, as part of its £120 million proposed Festival Wing development, sought to insert café and shop units in the Undercroft space partly to fund new performance spaces in the new buildings to be built above parts of the Queen Elizabeth Hall and to move the skate space to a new location under Hungerford Bridge about 120 metres away. This was opposed by the Long Live Southbank Campaign which gained the support of Mayor Boris Johnson in early 2014, leading to the suspension of the Festival Wing proposals.

Long Live Southbank and the Southbank Centre agreed a refurbishment programme for the Undercroft space which was subsequently carried out.

=== Roof ===

Since 2012, the temporary structure &quot;A Room for London&quot; has been located on top of the auditorium building. The structure, designed by architect David Kohn is described as &quot;a one-bedroom installation&quot; and is shaped to appear like a boat perched on top of a building.

==Recent developments==
In 2005–06, the South Bank Centre and Arts Council considered reconstruction or replacement of the QEH and Purcell Room by two new auditoriums, each of approximately 1,100 seats, one for classical music and one for amplified music and contemporary dance performances. This would have posed significant architectural challenges, given the constrained site and the close proximity of the Royal Festival Hall. In 2013, proposals were commissioned from Feilden Clegg Bradley for the Festival Wing scheme of the Southbank Centre, but this scheme did not proceed.

The whole 1960s complex including the Queen Elizabeth Hall, Purcell Room and Hayward Gallery, underwent complete internal refurbishment under the banner &quot;Let the Light In&quot; from 2015 to 2018, to designs by the architecture practice Feilden Clegg Bradley. The work does not cover any major cleaning or work to the exteriors. The Arts Council granted £10 million, the remainder being raised by sponsorship, such as seat-naming, and private donations.

Although none of these buildings are listed or protected the Southbank Centre has consistently opposed petitions to the government for listing so that it can maintain as much flexibility to make changes as part of future development of this area of the site in accordance with its masterplan in the future, the level and standard of restoration and renewal carried out was commensurate with the building&#x27;s significance and standing.

<doc id="1345212" wikidata="Q5914803" url="?curid=1345212" title="House of Chiefs (Fiji)">
<text>The House of Chiefs in Fiji consists of the Fijian nobility, composed of about seventy chiefs of various ranks, majority of which are related. It is not a formal political body and is not the same as the Great Council of Chiefs, a political body which had a prescribed role under the 1997 Constitution of Fiji, although the membership of the two bodies did overlap to a great extent.

== The social hierarchy ==

Fijian society is traditionally very stratified. A hierarchy of chiefs presides over villages &quot;(koro),&quot; sub-districts &quot;(tikina vou),&quot; districts &quot;(tikina cokavata),&quot; and provinces &quot;(yasana).&quot; These administrative divisions generally correspond roughly with the social units of the extended family &quot;(tokatoka),&quot; clan &quot;(mataqali),&quot; tribe &quot;(yavusa),&quot; and land &quot;(vanua).&quot; Each mataqali is presided over by a chief, styled &quot;Ratu&quot; if male or &quot;Adi&quot; (pronounced &quot;Ahn-di)&quot; if female. Chiefs presiding over units above the mataqali have other, more prestigious titles, although they, too, are typically addressed and referred to as &quot;Ratu&quot; or &quot;Adi,&quot; although there are regional variations. In Rewa, &quot;Ro&quot; is used instead of &quot;Ratu&quot; and &quot;Adi,&quot; while in the Lau Islands &quot;Roko&quot; is used. In Kadavu Group and in the west of Fiji, &quot;Bulou&quot; substitutes for &quot;Adi.&quot; The method of appointing chiefs is not uniform, although the position is generally held for life (with some exceptions) and there is a hereditary element, although the son of a chief does not automatically succeed to the position on his father&#x27;s death. A chief may hold more than one title, just as a peer may in the United Kingdom; the late Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, for example, was both &quot;Tui Nayau&quot; and &quot;Tui Lau&quot;.

== Provinces and confederacies ==

For administrative purposes, Fiji is divided into fourteen provinces, each of which has a Provincial Council in which the chiefs from the province are represented, along with commoners. Each Provincial Council is headed by a &quot;Roko Tui,&quot; whose appointment must be approved by the Fijian Affairs Board, a government department, which must also approve all bylaws passed and taxes levied by the Councils. (Titles can be deceptive: not every chief styled &quot;Roko Tui&quot; heads a Provincial Council). The Provincial Councils are significant in that they not only administer communally owned land (more than 80 percent of Fiji&#x27;s total land area), but also elected most of the representatives to the Great Council of Chiefs. Moreover, the Great Council of Chiefs, which was charged with choosing 14 of the 32 members of the Fijian Senate, the upper house of the Parliament, normally delegated that task to the fourteen Provincial Councils.

All of the chiefs also belong to one of three confederacies: Kubuna, Burebasaga, and Tovata. For the most part, the boundaries of the confederacies correspond to the boundaries of the provinces. An anomaly exists in the west of the country, where the provinces of Ba and Ra are split between the confederacies of Kubuna and Burebasaga. This does not affect administration, however, as the confederacies and the provinces fulfill different roles, the former being based on the relationship of chiefs and clans, and the latter being formal political entities.

The highest chiefly title, the Tui Viti (King of Fiji), has been vacant since 1874, when King Seru Epenisa Cakobau and other prominent chiefs ceded the islands to the United Kingdom. But the Tui Viti title was relatively new; it was never a traditional kingly title of Fiji, but came into being after the death of Tanoa Visawaqa and the rise of his son Seru Epenisa Cakobau who proclaimed himself Tui Viti after conquering much of Fiji and persuading his fellow-chiefs to recognize him as their overlord.

However the title has been recognised since that time and the British monarch has filled a similar role since; even since Fiji became a republic in 1987, the former Great Council of Chiefs continued to recognise Queen Elizabeth II as its most senior chief, even though she ceased to be Queen of Fiji after Sitiveni Rabuka&#x27;s two military coups in 1987, which overthrew the Dominion of Fiji and the 1970 Constitution of Fiji.

== List of Fijian chiefly titles ==
The following table depicts Fiji&#x27;s districts, sub-districts, and villages, with their chiefs. Each chief, if known, is named in italics under his or her full formal title, which is in bold. The majority of chiefs rule over a group of villages &quot;(koro)&quot; belonging to a &quot;Tikina Vou&quot; (sub-district); some &quot;Tikina Vou&quot; are subdivided into two or more groupings of villages, each with its own chief. In a few cases, two groups of villages, or even two sub-districts, share a single chief. This is more common in Naitasiri Province than elsewhere. In the table, this is indicated by backgrounding in the same colour the areas shared by a chief. The Lau Islands are an anomaly: unlike the other provinces, their districts are not divided into sub-districts. All the 14 provinces have their own paramount chief with exceptions to Kadavu. Kadavu Province has nine chiefs; all are paramount in their own districts.

The districts, sub-districts, and villages are arranged, not alphabetically, but in the order of precedence of their chiefs. This order is not without controversy, but protocol generally observes it.

<doc id="1345214" wikidata="Q5293560" url="?curid=1345214" title="Don Steele">
<text>Don Steele (born Donald Steele Revert; April 1, 1936 – August 5, 1997) was an American disc jockey and one of the most popular disc jockeys in the United States from the middle of the 1960s until his retirement for health reasons in May 1997. He was better known as &quot;The Real Don Steele,&quot; a name suggested by his program director, Steve Brown, at KOIL-AM in Omaha, Nebraska. Brown hoped the moniker would click with listeners and make him stand out from other radio personalities.

==Early career==
Born in Hollywood, California, Steele graduated from Hollywood High School, served in the United States Air Force and then studied at a local radio school, the Don Martin School of Broadcasting, where he also taught for a short time. Shortly thereafter, Steele began his radio career working outside of L.A. at a small station, KBUC in Corona, California, then moving on to KEPR Kennewick, KIMA Yakima and KXLY Spokane, all in Washington; KOIL Omaha, Nebraska; KISN Portland, Oregon, and KEWB Oakland/San Francisco before returning to Los Angeles to help kick off what would become one of the most influential radio stations in the country, 93/KHJ, Boss Radio, in April 1965.

==National prominence==
Steele became nationally known as a DJ on radio station KHJ in Los Angeles, where he helped to promote the &quot;ultrahip&quot; top-40 &quot;Boss Radio&quot; format which began at 3pm on April 27, 1965. He also appeared on TV as host of &quot;Boss City&quot; and &quot;The Real Don Steele TV Show&quot;, a show which ran from 1965 to 1975 on KHJ-TV channel 9 in Los Angeles. When the popularity of AM radio gave way to FM stereo in the 1970s, Steele continued to remain a popular personality at the station. Following the years at 93/KHJ, The Real Don Steele continued to be heard on Los Angeles radio stations, including KIQQ (K-100), KTNQ (Ten-Q), KRLA, KCBS-FM and KRTH-FM (K-Earth 101), until his death in August 1997.

In the book &quot;Los Angeles Radio People&quot;, Steele recalled the beginnings of Boss Radio in 1965: &quot;We were standing literally at ground zero, then (the radio format) became a huge giant. It was like a mushroom cloud that went up -- heavy on the mushroom.&quot;

Steele also gained additional notoriety due to an ill-fated promotion which KHJ undertook on behalf of his show during the summer of 1970. The promotion was dubbed a “Super Summer Spectacular” and involved Steele driving around the Los Angeles-area in a flashy red car. Throughout the day, KHJ would broadcast clues about Steele&#x27;s location, and listeners who successfully tracked him down would receive cash prizes of about $25, equal to $ today. On July 16, 1970, two teenagers attempting to track Steele by car at speeds of roughly forced another car into a highway center divider, causing the death of Ronald Weirum. Weirum&#x27;s family sued various parties, including KHJ, asserting that the tragedy was a foreseeable consequence of the recklessness inherent to the nature of the &quot;Super Summer Spectacular&quot; promotion. The family&#x27;s lawsuit eventually reached the Supreme Court of California, which held for the plaintiffs. The Court&#x27;s opinion in the case, Weirum v. RKO General, Inc., 15 Cal.3d 40 (1975) has since become a well-known holding on the subject of foreseeability in torts law, and is often studied in American law schools.

One of Steele&#x27;s ongoing on-air bits was the refrain, &quot;Tina Delgado is alive, alive!&quot; Legends grew as to the meaning of the phrase, but Steele never did reveal what it really meant, or who the girl was who uttered the words.

The Real Don Steele stayed at KHJ until June 1973, then moved on to L.A. radio stations KIQQ, KTNQ, KRLA, KODJ / KCBS and arrived at KRTH in July 1982. He recorded commercials and at one time had a successful, nationally syndicated radio show. He is also the DJ on Cheap Trick&#x27;s &quot;On the Radio&quot; (&quot;Heaven Tonight&quot;). His career took a dive in the mid-1980s, at which time a copywriter directing him as a voiceover for a Sea World radio spot introduced him to legendary voice actor Ernie Anderson. On hearing Steele in the booth, Anderson immediately connected Steele to his agent. Within weeks, Steele was back on top with a drive time slot at KRTH-FM in Los Angeles.

That show, &quot;Live From the 60&#x27;s&quot;, was created by Steele along with friend and contemporary M.G.&quot;Machine Gun&quot; Kelly, who followed Steele at KHJ-AM, then DJ&#x27;d with him in the &#x27;70s at 10Q. &quot;Live From the 60&#x27;s&quot; was a three-hour program that featured oldies exclusively from the 1960s. Each hour of the show profiled a certain year from that decade. It was written and performed in present tense, and peppered with audio clips of news events, presidential speeches and TV shows that correlated with that particular year. The show ran in syndication, and was marketed and picked up by over 200 radio stations with an &quot;Oldies&quot; format from 1988 until 1993. Repeats of earlier shows aired in some markets as late as 1996. In July 2015, &quot;Live From the 60&#x27;s with The Real Don Steele&quot; was placed back into three hour re-run syndication for AM/FM and Podcasting radio stations.

==Death==
Steele died of lung cancer on August 5, 1997, at the age of 61.

==Recognitions==
A poll seeking the top 10 disc jockeys in Los Angeles from 1957 to 1997 rated Steele second (behind Gary Owens) among the 232 personalities nominated. The ballot was printed by Don Barrett in his 1994 book, and results are published in the second volume of his book. Rick Dees said of Steele in Barrett&#x27;s book, &quot;Pure, raw energy and focus. And he still has it every day. That&#x27;s amazing!&quot;

Boyd R. Britton, who worked with Steele in the late 1970s at KTNQ said, &quot;He educated me in star quality, in energy and focus. He epitomized energy on the air.&quot; Reflecting on Steele&#x27;s habit of using very high headphone levels, Britton said, &quot;Very early on he was extremely hearing damaged. It was very difficult for him to hear in a group. That made his natural speaking voice almost as loud as his on-air voice.&quot;

In 1993, from KRTH, Steele told the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;: &quot;I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m any different now. I&#x27;ve never stopped. I&#x27;ve never changed. I never did anything else. This is the music of my life.&quot;

He received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on May 3, 1995. The star is located at 7080 Hollywood Boulevard near La Brea Avenue.

==Film and TV appearances==
For a decade, Steele hosted a weekly dance-party show on KHJ-TV. First billed as Boss City in 1965, the Saturday 6 p.m. program became The Real Don Steele Show from 1970 to 1975. He appeared in several films, many times playing a disc jockey, in films such as &quot;Death Race 2000&quot; (1975), &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; (1977), &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll High School&quot; (1979), &quot;Eating Raoul&quot; (1982), and &quot;Gremlins&quot; (1984). He also appeared as himself in &quot;KISS Meets the Phantom of the Park&quot; (1978). On prime-time TV, Steele had appearances in a 1966 episode of &quot;Bewitched,&quot; and in an episode of &quot;Here Come the Brides&quot; in 1970.

The Real Don Steele sound clips from KHJ airchecks are prominently featured in Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s &quot;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood&quot; (2019) and on its accompanying soundtrack album.

<text>Scipione Piattoli (; 10 November 1749 – 12 April 1809) was an Italian Catholic priest—a Piarist—an educator, writer, and political activist, and a major figure of the Enlightenment in Poland. After ten years as a professor at the University of Modena in Italy, he emigrated to the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, where he became associated with several magnate families—the Potockis, Lubomirskis, and Czartoryskis. He was a member of Duchess Dorothea von Medem&#x27;s court in Courland (Lithuania) and of King Stanisław August Poniatowski&#x27;s court.

Piattoli was politically active in Warsaw during and after the Four-Year Sejm (1788–1792). He served as intermediary between the reformist Patriotic Party and King Stanisław August Poniatowski, and as an aide to the King (1789–1793). He is best remembered for his participation in drafting the Constitution of 3 May 1791, a milestone in the history of Polish political legislation. He was an organizer of the 1794 Kościuszko Insurrection against Russian influence, which was the last armed struggle held under the banners of the Commonwealth. After the Third Partition of Poland (1795), Piattoli was interned by the Austrians for several years, together with another Polish activist of the Constitution movement, Hugo Kołłątaj. Freed in 1800, he worked several years with Polish and Russian statesman Prince Adam Jerzy Czartoryski in the service of Russia, before retiring to Courland.

Piattoli was an inspiration to Leo Tolstoy, who based the figure of Abbé Morio in &quot;War and Peace&quot; (1869) on him. He is also one of the figures immortalized in Jan Matejko&#x27;s 1891 painting, &quot;Constitution of 3 May 1791.&quot; In his 1980 ten-page entry on Piattoli in the &quot;Polish Biographical Dictionary&quot;, historian Emanuel Rostworowski notes that, &quot;despite two Italian monographs (by A.D. Ancon and G. Bozzolato)&quot;, Piattoli still awaits a definitive biography.

==Early life==
Scipione Piattoli was born in Florence on 10 November 1749 to a family of painters (father, Gaetano Piattoli; mother, Anna Bacherini Piattoli; brother, Giuseppe Piattoli).

In 1763 he joined the Piarist order, taking the name Urban. Some historians have questioned whether he ever took Holy Orders; in any case he was known for a rather secular lifestyle. He taught rhetoric in Piarist schools in Massa and Corregio, and got his doctorate from the University of Florence. From 1772 to 1782 he was a professor at the University of Modena, teaching religious history and Greek. Soon he became involved in political activism, and in 1774 he published (anonymously) a brochure titled &quot;Saggio intorno al luogo del seppellire&quot;, which focused on the issue of hygiene and burials near churches. Also in 1774 he received permission to leave the Piarists, and resumed using the name Scipione. He would, however, keep and use the title of &quot;the priest&quot; (&quot;l&#x27;abbé&quot;) for most of his life. By the turn of the decade, Piattoli found himself in a faction that was losing in the politics of Modena, and decided to move, giving up his professorship in 1782.

Piattoli arrived in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth that year, as a tutor for the sons of Piotr Potocki, a member of the magnate Potocki family. It was said in a contemporary account that his entire material wealth at that time was composed of a &quot;sizable library&quot;. Piattoli ended his service with the Potocki family around 1784 due to personal disagreements with Pelagia Potocka and Maria Radziwiłł. In the meantime, he became associated with the Lubomirski family—Izabela Lubomirska in particular—and through them befriended Stanisław Kostka Potocki and Grzegorz Piramowicz. Through Potocki and Piramowicz he became a member of the Society for Elementary Books in 1784. In the Society he was tasked with writing a textbook on the history of science. Around that time he was also active in Warsaw freemasonry.

Piattoli traveled through Europe in the retinue of the Lubomirski family, including Izabela, and as a tutor of young Henryk Lubomirski. During that time he developed extensive contacts at various European courts in Courland, Austria (Vienna), Italy (Turin) and France (Paris). During his three-year stay in the Lubomirskis&#x27; Parisian residence, he was in touch with many important men of the Age of Enlightenment. He met—often through another Florentinian, Filippo Mazzei—Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Thomas Jefferson, the Marquis de Lafayette, Luigi Landriani, Girolamo Lucchesini, and the Marquis de Condorcet. He also corresponded with J. G. Herder. In Poland, he developed close contacts with Ignacy Potocki and Julian Ursyn Niemcewicza. From 1787 he also tutored Adam Jerzy Czartoryski, later an important politician in the Russian Empire, on whom Piattoli would retain significant influence.

==Reformer and constitution drafter==

Piattoli developed contacts with notable figures on the Polish political scene, initially from the group opposed to the royal faction. By the end of his stay in Paris, he likely became a supporter of reforms in France and Poland, and begun taking his first serious steps in political activism, through the involvement in the Quattuowirat, a group of magnates planning a (never realized) confederacy. He became a foreign member of the Société des Amis des Noirs.

Through his freemason contacts with Pierre Maurice Glayre, Piattoli won the confidence of Poland&#x27;s King Stanisław August Poniatowski, becoming his agent in Paris and, by the end of 1789, his private secretary and librarian, although without any official title. Acting as a sort of cultural aide, Piattoli, who had strong ties to the reformist and often anti-royal opposition, became an important link between the reformers—Ignacy Potocki in particular—and the king. In the words of a Swedish diplomat, L. Engstrom, he was &quot;like a tireless spring&quot;, constantly mediating between the two factions.

Due to his association with the reformers, in conservative Rome he became infamous as a staunch supporter of revolutionary ideals and was accused of &quot;democratism&quot;. Vatican diplomats criticized the king for hiring such a &quot;revolutionary&quot;, but the king defended Piattoli quite vividly. In any case, many such claims were exaggerations or rumours spread by his political enemies: according to one such rumour, Piattoli was alleged to incite crowds in France to kill the king. In reality, Piattoli supported the &quot;Monarchiens&quot; of the French Revolution&#x27;s early stages, but more in the direction of peaceful transformation into a constitutional republic than the regicidal excesses.

Between 1790 and 1792, Piattoli was sent on several sensitive diplomatic missions for the king to Berlin and other places. He was involved in the negotiations of the Polish-Prussian alliance. He collaborated with Ignacy Potocki, helping draft many texts connected with Potocki&#x27;s work in the Sejm, the legislature of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. He was also an active supporter of Poniatowski&#x27;s plan for a hereditary succession.
Piattoli, as Poniatowski&#x27;s secretary and a resident of the Royal Castle in Warsaw, has been credited with winning the King over to the idea of social reforms and with playing a part in the drafting of the Constitution of 3 May 1791. The exact nature of Piattoli&#x27;s role in regard to the Constitution remains uncertain; modern historians disagree to what degree he was an executor, a mediator, or an initiator. He played a role in convincing the King to collaborate with the leaders of the Patriotic Party on drafting a constitution. He might have prepared or expanded drafts of the document, based on discussions among the principal authors, including the King, Hugo Kołłątaj (another politically active Roman Catholic priest) and Ignacy Potocki. At a minimum, he seems to have helped catalyze the process. Historian Emanuel Rostworowski describes him as a vital secretary-editor, who certainly participated in related discussions and influenced both Potocki and the king, and calls Piattoli&#x27;s quarters in the Royal Palace a &quot;creche&quot; of the constitution. Piattoli was, finally, involved in the final preparations for the vote that took place during the Sejm session on 3 May.

Later that month he became a founder of the Friends of the Constitution. He was active in various political causes and worked closely with other key figures in Poland such as Hugo Kołłątaj. He became a trusted adviser to Dorothea von Medem, Duchess of Courland. He supported reforms to improve the status of the burghers and Jews.

==Final years==
During the War in Defence of the Constitution in 1792, Piattoli found himself on another diplomatic mission to Dresden, where he stayed after the Commonwealth&#x27;s defeat at the hands of Imperial Russia resulted in the Second Partition of Poland. In Dresden and nearby Leipzig, Piattoli was active in the circles of Polish patriotic emigres, who included Potocki and Kolłątaj. In 1793 he officially parted ways with Poniatowski, receiving a letter in which he was discharged from his service. In 1794 he was involved in the preparations for the Kościuszko Insurrection against Russian influence, and in negotiations with the newly republican France, in which Polish reformists proposed an alliance with France, promising to turn Poland into a second republic in Europe. At the same time, he was involved in much more conservative negotiations with Russians.

In July 1794 he and several other activists were exiled from Leipzig, and Piattoli was soon arrested by the Austrian authorities. After the failure of the Kościuszko Insurrection later in 1794, many prisoners were set free, but Piattoli was kept imprisoned, together with Kołłątaj, as the Russian authorities insisted that the two were &quot;extremely dangerous&quot;. Hence, even after the final Partitions of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1795, Piattoli was kept interned in Prague by the Austrian Empire authorities until 1800, despite requests for his release from Poniatowski and even Napoleon Bonaparte. His release in 1800 seems to have been the result of efforts of the Czartoryski family and Duchess Dorothea.

After his release he returned to Dorothea&#x27;s Courland court, where he served as a tutor for her daughter. Around 1803 he began cooperating with Adam Jerzy Czartoryski, who was now working for the Russian authorities. Around that time, he and Czartoryski authored a plan for a European federal organization of states intended to prevent armed conflicts and to maintain perpetual peace. Piattoli, through Czartoryski, briefly worked in the diplomatic service and administration of the Russians, too. Like Czartoryski, Piattoli tried to push for a more lenient and friendly attitude towards Poland at the Russian court, but with little success.

In 1807 Scipione Piattoli returned to Courland. There he finally settled, abandoned the priesthood, and married one of the ladies of the court. In his final years in Courland he was involved with Courland&#x27;s educational system, and hoped to pursue some scientific studies, a lifelong dream for which he never found enough time. He died of a lung infection in Altenburg on 12 April 1809. He was buried in a park in Löbichau.

==Remembrance==
Piattoli was an inspiration to Leo Tolstoy, who based the figure of the Abbé Morio in &quot;War and Peace&quot; (1869) on him. He is also one of the figures immortalized in Jan Matejko&#x27;s 1891 painting, &quot;Constitution of 3 May 1791&quot;. In his 1980 ten-page entry on Piattoli in the &quot;Polish Biographical Dictionary&quot;, historian Emanuel Rostworowski notes that, &quot;despite two Italian monographs (by A.D. Ancon and G. Bozzolato)&quot;, Piattoli still awaits a definitive biography.

<doc id="1345217" wikidata="Q3620668" url="?curid=1345217" title="The Great and Secret Show">
<text>The Great and Secret Show is a fantasy novel by British author Clive Barker. It was released in 1989 and it is the first &quot;Book of the Art&quot; in a trilogy, known as &quot;The Art Trilogy&quot; by fans.

The novel is about the conflict between two highly evolved men – Randolph Jaffe and Richard Fletcher – over the mystical dream sea called Quiddity. Jaffe hopes to tap into Quiddity&#x27;s power while Fletcher wants to prevent it from being tainted. The conflict between the two men spills into the real world in a decades-long feud, distorting reality and affecting the entire human race.

Clive Barker has said in interviews that this novel was the hardest to write of all his books.

==Plot summary==
In 1969, while working in a dead letter office in Nebraska, disgruntled postal clerk Randolph Jaffe discovers hints to a mysterious society known as The Shoal, which ostensibly practises a form of magic only vaguely known as &quot;The Art&quot;. Jaffe&#x27;s search eventually brings him to a New Mexico town where he encounters Kissoon, who claims to be the last of the Shoal. Kissoon tells Jaffe of the mystical dream sea Quiddity and the islands within it known as the Ephemeris. Quiddity, as it turns out, is visible exactly three times to an ordinary human: The first time we ever sleep outside our mother&#x27;s womb, the first time we sleep beside the one we truly love and the last time we ever sleep before we die. However, this simply is not enough for the c Jaffe, who wishes to actually visit the dream sea in person and gain control of it. Jaffe flees when Kissoon tries to bargain for his body.

Jaffe later teams up with a scientist named Fletcher to develop a liquid called Nuncio, which can theoretically allow a human to evolve to a state that would enable him to physically reach Quiddity. Fletcher realises that Jaffe will only use Nuncio for evil and destroys his laboratory. Jaffe arrives and both are exposed to the Nuncio. After the two battle each other for a year, their spirits arrive in California and topple into a crack in the earth near the town of Palomo Grove. From there, they energize extreme sexual desires into four local teenage girls. The four girls seek out various partners in their community and become impregnated. One of the girls is infertile and fails to conceive while another kills herself and her child after giving birth. The third, Trudi Katz, moves away with her baby Howard, while the fourth, Joyce McGuire, gives birth to twins, Jo-Beth and Tommy Ray.

Eighteen years pass. Howard returns to California after the death of his mother. While Jaffe and Fletcher produced offspring to continue their battle, Howard and Jo-Beth instead fall in love after meeting. Fletcher and Jaffe are able to escape their captivity, locked into the crack in the earth. Jaffe is able to amass an army of creatures known as Terata using the minds of vulnerable people, and gets his son Tommy Ray on his side as well. Howard encounters Fletcher, who explains his heritage to him. Fletcher explains Quiddity to Howard, telling him that the Ephemeris contain the Great and Secret Show, but Howard refuses to align with his father. Meanwhile, a reporter named Grillo and his friend, Tesla, arrive in town. Fletcher is unable to amass his own army of hallucigenia from the mind of dreamers and instead kills himself through immolation, spreading his essence to the people of the town.

Having encountered Fletcher before his death, Tesla heads to the remnants of his laboratory to recover the remains of the Nuncio. Tommy Ray is sent by Jaffe. While there Tesla encounters Raul, an ape who had been evolved through the power of the Nuncio. Tommy Ray arrives and shoots Tesla, but the last remaining vial of Nuncio breaks, infecting both men. Tesla&#x27;s consciousness travels to a time loop in New Mexico where she encounters Kissoon. Kissoon explains to Tesla that the Shoal were dedicated to keeping Quiddity and the Art pure but with them all dead, Earth (known as the Cosm) could be dominated by the evil race Iad Uroboros, who live in the Metacosm on the opposite side of Quiddity. Tesla leaves when Kissoon tries to take over her body but agrees to find another body for him to inhabit. Leaving the time loop, Tesla encounters a woman named Mary Muralles, who reveals that it was Kissoon who murdered the Shoal and he is actually an agent of the Iad Uroboros. Kissoon kills Mary using snake-like creatures created by his excrement and semen (Lix), then captures Raul to take over his body.

Tommy Ray leads an army of the dead while the hallucigenia created by Fletcher&#x27;s death convince Howard to help them attack Jaffe. Jaffe manages to tear a hole through reality into Quiddity but realises it is too much power for him to deal with. As his Terata battle the hallucigenia many are dragged into Quiddity including Howard, Jo-Beth and Tommy Ray. Tesla, Grillo and Jaffe flee the house and attempt to close the vortex into Quiddity. Quiddity transforms Howard, Jo-Beth and Tommy Ray as they reach the Ephemeris, where they find that the Iad Uroboros are crossing Quiddity towards Earth.

The town starts to collapse and is sealed off by the authorities. Tesla recalls a word Kissoon had brought up, &quot;Trinity&quot;, which is the place where the first atomic bomb was detonated. Kissoon arrives, now occupying Raul&#x27;s body, but Jaffe is able to distract him as Tesla transports the vortex to Quiddity into Kissoon&#x27;s time loop. Howard, Jo-Beth and Tommy Ray, completely transformed from their experience in Quiddity, return from the vortex. Jaffe is able to kill Raul&#x27;s body and is reunited with Tommy Ray. Tesla finds that Raul has occupied Kissoon&#x27;s former body. By convincing Raul&#x27;s consciousness to enter her body, Kissoon&#x27;s body dies, which disintegrates the time loop, destroys the vortex to Quiddity and the Iad Uroboros who were arriving. Tesla and the others are able to escape the time loop just in time.

Jo-Beth and Howard meet supernatural investigator Harry D&#x27;Amour, who asks for their story. Tesla meets Grillo and tells him that the worshippers of the Iad Uroboros are still active and will try to summon them again.

==Adaptations==
===Comics===

It was also released as a 12-part comic book between March 2006 and May 2007 by IDW Publishing.

===Television===
In December 2016, filmmaker Josh Boone announced that he is adapting the novel as a television series with co-writer Owen King.

==Reception==
Critical reception for the book has been mixed.

Ken Tucker of &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave a mixed review of &quot;The Great and Secret Show&quot;, writing: &quot;From &quot;The Great and Secret Show&quot;, it is clear that Mr. Barker&#x27;s intention is to force the horror genre to encompass a kind of dread, an existential despair, that it hasn&#x27;t noticeably evinced until now. This is a tall order, one that this novel, which is skillful and funny but ultimately overwrought, doesn&#x27;t quite accomplish. But, having announced the intention of writing a trilogy about the Art and its mysteries, he may yet achieve his goal&quot;. Author David Foster Wallace was also mixed in his review as he heavily criticized the work as overly pretentious but commented that the novel was &quot;not without some cool sections&quot;. Publishers Weekly panned the work overall, stating: &quot;Though diverting, the novel is something of a potboiler, and despite its pervasive horrific imagery, it fails even to frighten us--or invite us to suspend disbelief&quot;.

<doc id="1345219" wikidata="Q7670568" url="?curid=1345219" title="TK Solver">
<text>TK Solver (originally TK!Solver) is a mathematical modeling and problem solving software system based on a declarative, rule-based language, commercialized by Universal Technical Systems, Inc.

==History==
Invented by Milos Konopasek in the late 1970s and initially developed in 1982 by Software Arts, the company behind VisiCalc, TK Solver was acquired by Universal Technical Systems in 1984 after Software Arts fell into financial difficulty and was sold to Lotus Software. Konopasek&#x27;s goal in inventing the TK Solver concept was to create a problem solving environment in which a given mathematical model built to solve a specific problem could be used to solve related problems (with a redistribution of input and output variables) with minimal or no additional programming required: once a user enters an equation, TK Solver can evaluate that equation as is—without isolating unknown variables on one side of the equals sign.

Software Arts also released a series of &quot;Solverpacks&quot; - &quot;ready-made versions of some of the formulas most commonly used in specific areas of application.&quot;

&quot;The New York Times&quot; described TK Solver as doing &quot;for science and engineering what word processing did for corporate communictions [sic] and calc packages did for finance.&quot;

===Universal Technical Systems===
Lotus, which had acquired Software Arts, including TK Solver, in 1984 sold its ownership of the software to Universal Technical Systems less than two years later. Release 5 was still considered &quot;one of the longest–standing mathematical equation solvers on the market today&quot; in 2012.

==Core technology==
TK Solver&#x27;s core technologies are a declarative programming language, algebraic equation solver, an iterative equation solver, and a structured, object-based interface, using a command structure. The interface comprises nine classes of objects that can be shared between and merged into other TK files:
* Rules: equations, formulas, function calls which may include logical conditions
* Variables: a listing of the variables that are used in the rules, along with values (numeric or non-numeric) that have been entered by the user or calculated by the software
* Units: all units conversion factors, in a single location, to allow automatic update of values when units are changed
* Lists: ranges of numeric and non-numeric values which can be associated with a variable or processed directly by procedure functions
* Tables: collections of lists displayed together
* Plots: line charts, scatterplots, bar charts, and pie charts
* Functions: rule-based, table look-up, and procedural programming components
* Formats: settings for displaying numeric and string values
* Comments: for explanation and documentation

Each class of object is listed and stored on its own worksheet—the Rule Sheet, Variable Sheet, Unit Sheet, etc. Within each worksheet, each object has properties summarized on subsheets or viewed in a property window. The interface uses toolbars and a hierarchal navigation bar that resembles the directory tree seen on the left side of the Windows Explorer.

The declarative programming structure is embodied in the rules, functions and variables that form the core of a mathematical model.

==Rules, variables and units==
All rules are entered in the Rule Sheet or in user-defined functions. Unlike a spreadsheet or imperative programming environment, the rules can be in any order or sequence and are not expressed as assignment statements. &quot;A + B = C / D&quot; is a valid rule in TK Solver and can be solved for any of its four variables. Rules can be added and removed as needed in the Rule Sheet without regard for their order and incorporated into other models. A TK Solver model can include up to 32,000 rules, and the library that ships with the current version includes utilities for higher mathematics, statistics, engineering and science, finances, and programming.

Variables in a rule are automatically posted to the Variable Sheet when the rule is entered and the rule is displayed in mathematical format in the MathLook View window at the bottom of the screen. Any variable can operate as an input or an output, and the model will be solved for the output variables depending on the choice of inputs.

A database of unit conversion factors also ships with TK Solver, and users can add, delete, or import unit conversions in a way similar to that for rules. Each variable is associated with a &quot;calculation&quot; unit, but variables can also be assigned &quot;display&quot; units and TK automatically converts the values. For example, rules may be based upon meters and kilograms, but units of inches and pounds can be used for input and output.

==Problem-solving==
TK Solver has three ways of solving systems of equations. The &quot;direct solver&quot; solves a system algebraically by the principle of consecutive substitution. When multiple rules contain multiple unknowns, the program can trigger an iterative solver which uses the Newton–Raphson algorithm to successively approximate based on initial guesses for one or more of the output variables. Procedure functions can also be used to solve systems of equations. Libraries of such procedures are included with the program and can be merged into files as needed. A list solver feature allows variables to be associated with ranges of data or probability distributions, solving for multiple values, which is useful for generating tables and plots and for running Monte Carlo simulations. The premium version now also includes a &quot;Solution Optimizer&quot; for direct setting of bounds and constraints in solving models for minimum, maximum, or specific conditions.

TK Solver includes roughly 150 built-in functions: mathematical, trigonometric, Boolean, numerical calculus, matrix operations, database access, and programming functions, including string handling and calls to externally compiled routines. Users may also define three types of functions: declarative rule functions; list functions, for table lookups and other operations involving pairs of lists; and procedure functions, for loops and other procedural operations which may also process or result in arrays (lists of lists). The complete NIST database of thermodynamic and transport properties is included, with built-in functions for accessing it. TK Solver is also the platform for engineering applications marketed by UTS, including Advanced Spring Design, Integrated Gear Software, Interactive Roark’s Formulas, Heat Transfer on TK, and Dynamics and Vibration Analysis.

==Data display and sharing==
Tables, plots, comments, and the MathLook notation display tool can be used to enrich TK Solver models. Models can be linked to other components with Microsoft Visual Basic and .NET tools, or they can be web-enabled using the RuleMaster product or linked with Excel spreadsheets using the Excel Toolkit product. There is also a DesignLink option linking TK Solver models with CAD drawings and solid models. In the premium version, standalone models can be shared with others who do not have a TK license, opening them in Excel or the free TK Player.

==Reception==
&quot;BYTE&quot;″s 1982 preview of TK Solver said that it was &quot;an interesting program that does for equation-solving what the pocket calculator does for arithmetic—replacees drudgery and the possibility of error with speed and accuracy&quot;. The magazine&#x27;s 1984 review stated that &quot;TK!Solver is superb for solving almost any kind of equation&quot;, but that it did not handle matrices, and that a programming language like Fortran or APL was superior for simultaneous solution of linear equations. The magazine concluded that despite limitations, it was a &quot;powerful tool, useful for scientists and engineers. No similar product exists&quot;. By version 5.0, &quot;TK Solver&quot; added Matrix handling functionality.

<text>The Centre for Indigenous Theatre is a non-profit theater educational institution located in Toronto, Ontario. It focuses on performance art from an Indigenous cultural foundation.

The goal of the Centre &quot;is to develop and implement educational programs that promote and foster an understanding of Indigenous Theatre while providing the highest caliber arts training to Indigenous students from across Canada.&quot;

==History==
James H. Buller founded the Centre in 1974 as the Native Theatre School with the Association for Native Development in the Performing and Visual Arts. Buller was a noted opera and musical comedy singer. 

Before founding the school, Buller served in the Royal Canadian Navy and competed as a popular boxer known as &quot;Gentleman Jim&quot;. He wanted to see Aboriginal actors, playwrights and directors flourish across Canada and create a network of Aboriginal theatre companies.

The school changed its name to the Centre for Indigenous Theatre in 1994. The Centre first offered a one-year program, which was later expanded to a two-year program. By 1998, the program offered an additional, optional third year.

==Funding==
All levels of government fund the Centre. The Miziwe Biik Aboriginal Management Board, The McLean Foundation, Molson Companies Donation Fund and the Toronto Blue Jays also provide monetary support to the Centre.

<doc id="1345230" wikidata="Q5417426" url="?curid=1345230" title="Everville">
<text>Everville is a 1994 fantasy novel by British author Clive Barker. The second in the &quot;Books of the Art&quot; series, it follows the 1989 novel &quot;The Great and Secret Show&quot;.

The story tells of the creation and transformation of the small town of Everville, including several characters from Quiddity, the vast universe or afterlife hinted previously in the series. Detective Harry D&#x27;Amour appears, as do the &#x27;Shu (small, squid-like beings described as &quot;pieces of God&quot;), Phoebe Cobb, a resident of the town who passionately loves Joe, a dark-skinned painter, and Seth, a gay teenager who can hear angels knocking from the other side of Heaven.

== Plot summary ==
In 1848, an Irish immigrant named Maeve O&#x27;Connell is traveling west with her father and a group of others. Her father seeks to found the town of Everville, being inspired by a mysterious man named Buddenbaum and having been given a medallion similar to the one possessed by Jaffe in the Great and Secret Show. Maeve&#x27;s father is scapegoated and murdered by the fanatics in the group but Maeve is saved by a winged creature named Coker. Disobeying his orders to not follow him, Maeve ends up disrupting a wedding ceremony of two warring families from Quiddity, leading to a large conflict and the death of most of the families. Coker and Maeve are about to head through a portal, called a neirica, which brought such beings to Earth from Quiddity, but the arrival of Buddenbaum disrupts things. As the neirica closes, Coker severs his wings to stay with Maeve. Only one of the beings from Quiddity remains, a creature named Noah.

The narrative then shifts to the present day, where Everville is about to hold its popular annual festival. A doctor&#x27;s receptionist named Phoebe Cobb carried on an affair with a black painter named Joe Flicker. When caught by Phoebe&#x27;s husband, a struggle ensues and her husband is accidentally killed, forcing Joe, who has a prior criminal record, to go on the run. Tesla Bombeck, whose head is also occupied by Raul, returns to Palomo Grove where she meets a young man named Lucien and his colleagues, who believe Fletcher has returned. Meanwhile, Grillo, who has been collecting strange stories from around the world in a database he calls &quot;The Reef&quot; comes across a report that makes him believe Tommy Ray is still alive. He reaches out to Howard and Jo-Beth, who are now married with a baby daughter, Amy. An attorney named Erwin Toothaker comes across a 30-year-old confession about the lynching of a strange family of three. His research leads him to the remains of the family&#x27;s home where he finds Fletcher. Tesla meets up with and makes love to Lucien but the two argue and split up, spurned primarily by Raul. Fletcher drains the life out of Erwin, killing him. Erwin&#x27;s spirit remains and sees him creating Lix, revealing that Fletcher is in fact Kissoon. Joe, fleeing to the hills near Everville, comes across Noah and the still present neirica to Quiddity. Noah convinces Joe to bring him through into Quiddity and promises him power. He introduces Joe to a squid-like creature called Zehraphushu (&quot;Shu&quot;) which is believed to be a god-like being possessing a hive mind. Erwin&#x27;s spirit is able to lead Tesla to his home where she meets and befriends Phoebe.

Buddenbaum returns to Everville and starts a relationship with local teenager Seth Lundy. Buddenbaum has brought spirits he calls avatars with him and is looking for what he calls the crossroads. Tesla and Phoebe return to Erwin&#x27;s house where they encounter Kissoon. Due to the arrival of Erwin and other spirits, as well as Kissoon&#x27;s weakened state, Tesla and Phoebe are able to escape. In a dream Phoebe is able to interact with Joe, but he is left for dead in the water by the enslaved beings on the ship he is traveling on. In New York, Harry D&#x27;Amour meets with his friend Ted, who has made a painting of Wyckoff Street, where years earlier D&#x27;Amour encountered a demon he calls Lazy Susan who killed a friend of his. With support from Ted and his psychic friend Norma, D&#x27;Amour infiltrates a ceremony of beings from Quiddity, but Kissoon arrives in a new body, killing them and sealing the neirica. D&#x27;Amour finds an old abode of Kissoon&#x27;s and pursues him across the country, eventually being led to Everville.

Tesla and Phoebe head to the mountains of Everville where they find some creatures from Quiddity and the bodies of Lucien and his colleagues, who have been crucified. By threatening one of the creatures, and due to the timely arrival of D&#x27;Amour, they are able to escape. Tesla and Phoebe split up as Phoebe heads through the neirica into Quiddity. Due to the close proximity to Quiddity, Raul&#x27;s spirit departs Tesla&#x27;s body. In Quiddity, Phoebe meets a creature named Musnakaff who brings her to a home in the recreated city of Liverpool where she meets the now elderly Maeve O&#x27;Connell. Meanwhile, Joe makes it to the island of Mem-e b&#x27;Kether Sabbat where he finds many fleeing the city in fear of the Iad Ourobourus who are continuing to make their way across Quiddity to the Earth. Buddenbaum and Seth reunite. As the annual parade takes place in Everville, Buddenbaum tries to dig up the medallion buried in the ground and starts using the Art, causing many strange things to happen. A girl, one of Buddenbaum&#x27;s avatars known as the jai wai, appears to Tesla, and are interested in her. D&#x27;Amour shoots Buddenbaum in the head which doesn&#x27;t kill him, but he stops his attempts at using the Art.

Speaking with Maeve, Phoebe learns that she, along with her husband Coker and child, were the three that were lynched many years ago as discovered by Erwin. Maeve wants to return to Everville and along the way her former lover, a being made of earth called King Texas, appears. Maeve refuses him but Phoebe falls in a chasm and is forced to remain with him. Joe reunites with Noah, who leads him to a temple where there is a giant Shu, the only thing holding back the Iad Ouroborus. Joe has a special bond with the Shu, but Noah wants him to kill it. When he refuses, he kills Joe then the giant Shu as well. Joe&#x27;s spirit departs his body and witnesses the Iad now heading across Quiddity. Grillo helps Howard and Jo-Beth flee from Tommy Ray, but he pursues them along with the numerous dead spirits that follow him which he is unable to control. In the attempt to stop Tommy Ray, Howard starts a fire, but this ends up claiming the life of both him and Jo-Beth. Grillo is also killed trying to save Amy, who he gives to Tesla. Tesla meets all of the jai wai. Meanwhile, Erwin meets the spirit of Coker and they follow D&#x27;Amour to the mountains. There D&#x27;Amour is captured by the same creatures from Quiddity that Tesla and Phoebe had encountered before. Kissoon reveals himself to D&#x27;Amour and says that he has sealed the neirica across the world such that the Iad would enter Earth via Everville. Raul, who has possessed the body of one of the creatures from Quiddity is able to free D&#x27;Amour.

Phoebe is able to free herself of King Texas, who is able to block a large portion of the Iad from heading through the neirica to Earth. However, a portion of the Iad still head through. Maeve meets D&#x27;Amour and Raul. She reveals to them the origins of Everville, that the town was founded through prostitution she had set up there, and of her husband Coker and son Clayton, who showed utter contempt for humanity. Hearing of him, D&#x27;Amour recognizes Clayton to be Kissoon, who is seeking revenge upon Everville. Seth reaches out to Tesla, trying to set up a meeting with her and Buddenbaum. The jai wai have decided to abandon Buddenbaum for Tesla and she meets with him. Her being there disrupted Buddenbaum&#x27;s previous attempt to use the Art and she agrees to bring the jai wai to him and leave him be. Tommy Ray arrives in Everville and is able to take Amy, whom he claims to be his daughter, away with him. Tesla meets with the jai wai and agrees to let them follow her, but wants them to tell Buddenbaum they are abandoning him. Buddenbaum, who is again attempting to use the Art, reacts to the news by causing a blaze in the area, killing Tesla and the jai wai. Light from the event envelops Maeve, causing her original whorehouse to appear again. D&#x27;Amour looks for and finds Kissoon, and Seth helps him escape from Buddenbaum. Kissoon confronts his mother in the whorehouse and kills her, but by doing so Tesla is resurrected and given the power of the Art. Maeve&#x27;s spirit is reunited with that of Coker&#x27;s. Kissoon and the Iad fade away into the darkness.

Time passes and the events in Everville hit the news. Buddenbaum, Seth, Kissoon and the Iad have all disappeared. Tesla heads to Omaha to see the Reef. Harry has one final confrontation with the Lazy Susan demon and kills him. He is summoned by Raul to come see Tesla, finding her in a non-responsive state. Despite her state, Tesla is able to show D&#x27;Amour visions of the stories gathered in the Reef and is looking for the origins of everything. In Quiddity, Phoebe returns to Maeve&#x27;s home. The spirit of Joe reaches the house where he partially comes into being while she is dreaming of him. Phoebe later is reunited with Joe by the shore, with the remains of his new body being created by the Shu.

==Reception==
Critical reception for &quot;Everville&quot; has been mixed. The &quot;Sun-Sentinel&quot; panned &quot;Everville&quot; as inconsistent and stated that they felt that like its predecessor, it contained too many characters and that &quot;when you weed out the subplots, you find there is no main plot&quot;.

In contrast outlets like the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; and &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; praised the work. The latter wrote: &quot;At times profoundly moving as flawed heroes and heroines martyr themselves to love or goodness, this novel confirms the author&#x27;s position not only as one of horror&#x27;s most potent and fertile minds but also as one of modern fiction&#x27;s premier metaphysicians&quot;.

<text>Merillat Industries was founded in Adrian, Michigan as an American manufacturer of kitchen cabinets in 1946 by Orville D. Merillat. Now retired, Richard Merillat, took over from his father as CEO and President.

The Merillat Industries corporate headquarters, still located in Adrian, are on US-223 just outside the Adrian city limits. They had 11 manufacturing plants and over 4,200 employees in 2004 and have operated as an independent unit of Masco Corporation, a Detroit building products conglomerate since 1985.

In 2004 Merillat and Duncanville, Texas based QualityCabinets joined to form the Masco Builder Cabinet Group. In late 2007 Merillat Industries dissolved and began going by this new moniker.

On September 22, 2008, Masco announced that it plans to close the Adrian plant in early 2009, stating the following as its reason of closure:

Approximately 300 people will be without jobs when the plant closes.
In February 2010, the company announced a merger of the Adrian, Michigan-based Masco Builder Cabinet Group, and the Middlefield, Ohio-based Masco Retail Cabinet Group. The Retail Cabinet Group was most noted for producing the Kraftmaid, and Mills Pride cabinet brands. The new company that was formed has come to be known as Masco Cabinetry.

This new company is headquartered in Ann Arbor, Michigan at 4600 Arrowhead Drive. The company legally adopted its new name on January 1, 2011.

<text>Steve Matchett (born 23 December 1962 in England) is a commentator for American TV network Fox Sports on its Formula E programming. He formerly co-hosted live Formula One practices, qualifying sessions, and races alongside David Hobbs and Bob Varsha.

As well as his live F1 duties, Matchett also co-presented with the same duo a pre-recorded show on Speed Channel called &quot;Formula One Debrief&quot;, reviewing the events of the preceding week&#x27;s grand prix.

Until the conclusion of the 2012 Formula One season, he was a commentator for the FOX owned American Speed Channel. For the 2013 Formula One season, he was signed to NBC Sports Network, alongside Speed TV veterans David Hobbs and Bob Varsha until broadcasts moved to ESPN for the 2018 season.

He was a columnist for the Speed Channel website and presented a series of web-based video &#x27;chalk-talk&#x27; features in which, with photographs and a telestrator, he explains F1 engineering and technical matters.

He was a regular contributor and columnist to &quot;F1 Racing&quot; magazine from 1996 to 2008. He was Technical Editor of the magazine from 1998 to 2008 (resigning his editorship when Matt Bishop resigned as Editor-in-Chief).

He has also published a semi-autobiographical trilogy based around his years in the F1 pit lane.

==Education==
Loughborough University (technical college) 1979–1982, City &amp; Guilds Mechanical Engineering Apprenticeship

==Early career==
In 1977, he started working as a mechanic for Howlett&#x27;s of Loughborough performing routine service for Mazda and Vauxhall vehicles. He joined Graypaul Motors in 1986, a UK Ferrari dealership; then to a BMW dealership from 1988 to 1989. In January 1989 he was employed at a Cooper-BMW dealership in Rothley near Loughborough for exactly one year. He began his F1 career in 1990.

==Formula One==
Employed by Nigel Stepney, Matchett worked as a race mechanic with the Benetton F1 team from 1 February 1990 through 13 February 1998. During this period Michael Schumacher won the Drivers&#x27; Championship in both 1994 and 1995 before leaving the team, moving to Ferrari the following year; while Matchett and his team won the Constructors&#x27; Championship in 1995.
Throughout his time with Benetton he worked with many key drivers and personalities of the era: Michael Schumacher, Nelson Piquet, Riccardo Patrese, Martin Brundle, Johnny Herbert, Gerhard Berger and Jean Alesi all drove F1 cars prepared by Matchett.

Herbert and Matchett both claimed their maiden Formula One wins in the 1995 British Grand Prix, a race perhaps made most famous for the fact that Michael Schumacher and Damon Hill crashed out of the race while battling for the lead. Although Matchett had by this time experienced many wins as part of the Benetton team, the win at Silverstone was significant as it was the first Benetton victory secured by a Matchett prepared car. Ten years later, in his closing remarks of the relevant episode of Formula 1 Decade Matchett described his feelings during the closing laps of that landmark race, and how much the win had meant to him. Said Matchett:Herbert and Matchett would team up for another Formula One win in at the 1995 Italian Grand Prix held at Monza, another race in which Schumacher and Hill crashed out together. His career as a mechanic was brought to an end by a back injury (from which he has since recovered) sustained while operating the rear jack on a car during a pre-race practice session.

Throughout his Benetton career Matchett formed a close working relationship with both Stepney and Ross Brawn who was then technical director of Benetton. Brawn and Matchett remained on amicable terms even after Brawn&#x27;s move to Ferrari at the end of 1996 and Matchett&#x27;s own move into television four years later. During the Speed Channel Formula One broadcasts Matchett often cites conversations he has had with Brawn – and indeed other leading F1 engineers – by way of explaining to his viewers the pressing technical issues of the day.

==Television==
He made his television debut for Speedvision in 2000 filling in as a substitute commentator during the Canadian GP weekend while regular analysts Sam Posey and David Hobbs were at Le Mans covering the 24 hour race. He joined the crew for two more races in 2000, then joined Speedvision&#x27;s F1 broadcast crew full-time in 2001. In late 2001 Speedvision was acquired by Fox Television, rebranded as Speed Channel and relocated to Charlotte, North Carolina. Matchett made the switch to Charlotte. Matchett remained with the network until the end of the 2012 season, at which point he joined his colleagues in moving to NBC and NBC Sports.

His broadcasting niche is one of giving priority to the teams&#x27; involvement, rather than to any specific driver. During the Speed Channel shows he has often stated that the Constructors Championship is of greater significance to him than the Drivers Championship. At the end of each race show, David Hobbs reads out the driver points; Matchett always reads out the team points.
Unlike his co-announcers, Matchett&#x27;s unique approach is to talk of the races from the perspective of the competing teams (the engineer&#x27;s view) rather than the driver&#x27;s perspective. He describes the track&#x27;s challenges to the various GP teams and describes how the mechanics prepare the &#x27;set up&#x27; of the race cars to try and win the race.

He is also credited with the ability to notice minor changes that the mechanics have made to the cars and for his ability to spot mechanical problems on the cars even while they are running on the circuit. In addition to his duties calling the racing action, Matchett also estimates when the cars will be visiting the pits for fuel and tires.

From 2003 to 2005, Matchett also hosted Speed Channel&#x27;s Formula 1 Decade.

On 2 April 2004, the show had the daunting task of airing the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix, showing the crash that claimed the life of three-time World Drivers&#x27; Champion and 41-time Grand Prix race winner Ayrton Senna. Matchett, a mechanic for Benetton-Ford that weekend, made these remarks at the beginning of the broadcast:

Since 2007, Matchett has hosted an annual series of technical features for SPEED called RPM - Racing Per Matchett in which he interviews key members of the Renault F1, Red Bull Racing and McLaren F1 teams, explaining to the viewers different features of modern race car design and ultra-exotic technology.

In January 2008 he also hosted the first visit to America by BMW Sauber&#x27;s popular Pit Lane Park Formula One show, supporting the prestigious Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. He also emceed the four-day event alongside Mark Goodman of Sirius Satellite Radio, one of MTV&#x27;s original VJs. Graham Rahal son of Indy 500 winner Bobby Rahal drove a BMW Sauber F1.06 car in a series of demonstration runs during the event.

In 2009 Matchett presented a thirty-minute show for Speed Channel called &quot;Always Ferrari&quot;, in which he visited the famous Italian marque&#x27;s Maranello factory, toured the road car restoration division, the Formula 1 racing headquarters and there interviewed F1 team members including drivers Felipe Massa and Kimi Räikkönen.

<doc id="1345236" wikidata="Q1190056" url="?curid=1345236" title="Truth (Jeff Beck album)">
<text>Truth is the debut studio album by English guitarist Jeff Beck, released on 29 July 1968 in the United States on Epic Records and on 4 October 1968 in the United Kingdom on Columbia Records. It introduced the talents of his backing band the Jeff Beck Group, specifically vocalist Rod Stewart and bassist/guitarist Ronnie Wood, to a larger audience, and peaked at number 15 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs chart. In retrospect, &quot;Truth&quot; has been widely hailed as classic of its era and one of the earliest examples of heavy metal music.

==Content and background==
After leaving the Yardbirds in late 1966, Jeff Beck had released three commercial singles, two in 1967 featuring himself on lead vocals, and one without vocals in 1968. All had been hits on the British singles chart, and all were characterized by songs aimed at the pop chart on the A-side at the behest of producer Mickie Most. Harder rock and blues-based numbers were featured on the B-sides, and for music on the album, Beck opted to pursue the latter course.

Recording sessions for the album took place over four days, 14–15 May and 25–26 May 1968. Nine eclectic tracks were taken from these sessions, including covers of &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot; by Jerome Kern, the Tudor period melody &quot;Greensleeves&quot;, and Bonnie Dobson&#x27;s &quot;Morning Dew&quot;, a 1966 hit single for Tim Rose. Beck acknowledged two giants of Chicago blues in songs by Willie Dixon – Muddy Waters&#x27; &quot;You Shook Me&quot; and Howlin&#x27; Wolf&#x27;s &quot;I Ain&#x27;t Superstitious&quot;. 

The album starts with &quot;Shapes of Things&quot;, a song from Beck&#x27;s old band. Three originals were credited to &quot;Jeffrey Rod&quot;, a pseudonym for Beck and Stewart, all reworkings of existing blues songs: &quot;Let Me Love You&quot; by Buddy Guy; &quot;Rock My Plimsoul&quot; and &quot;Blues Deluxe&quot; which respectively derive from &quot;Rock Me Baby&quot; and &quot;Gambler&#x27;s Blues&quot; by B.B. King. For &quot;Blues Deluxe&quot;, Beck overdubbed audience reactions from a sound effects record to create a live atmosphere, a choice he later regretted.

&quot;Plimsoul&quot; had already been recorded for the B-side to the 1967 single &quot;Tallyman&quot;, and the tenth track, an instrumental featuring Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones, Keith Moon, and future Beck group pianist Nicky Hopkins, &quot;Beck&#x27;s Bolero&quot;, had been edited and remixed for stereo from the earlier B-side to &quot;Hi Ho Silver Lining&quot;. Due to contractual conflicts, Moon had been credited on the original album as &quot;You Know Who&quot;.

The cover art is a double exposure photograph of model Celia Hammond, who was dating Beck at the time, by photographer Stephen Goldblatt.

==Reception and legacy==

Reviewing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 1968, Al Kooper called &quot;Truth&quot; a &quot;classic&quot; and a contemporary version of the 1966 &quot;Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton&quot; LP, saying the Beck group &quot;swing like mad on this record.&quot;

&quot;Truth&quot; has since been regarded as a seminal work of heavy metal because of its use of blues toward a hard rock approach. According to Pete Prown and HP Newquist, &quot;although some have claimed that this disc was the first metal album, the sound actually leaned more towards a heavy brand of blues rock.&quot; &quot;Classic Rock&quot; magazine ranked &quot;Truth&quot; eighth on its list of the 30 greatest British blues rock albums; an accompanying blurb read, &quot;it was an album that not only helped establish the British blues rock sound, but featured many of its best exponents.&quot; Tom Scholz of Boston has listed it as his favorite album on Gibson&#x27;s online magazine, stating, &quot;I knew Jeff Beck&#x27;s &quot;Truth&quot; album inside out...&quot; Reviewing its historical significance, Sean Egan commented that the &quot;Truth&quot; line-up, if it had remained intact, could have produced &quot;a string of classic albums&quot;, but he also noted the large number of cover songs showed &quot;a lack of songwriting base&quot;.

Blues guitarist Joe Bonamassa recorded a studio version of &quot;Blues Deluxe&quot; on his 2003 album &quot;Blues Deluxe&quot; and recorded live versions on &quot;Live at Rockpalast&quot; (2005), and &quot;Live from the Royal Albert Hall&quot; (2009). Bonamassa also played &quot;Beck&#x27;s Bolero&quot;, &quot;Let Me Love You Baby&quot; (and &quot;Spanish Boots&quot; and &quot;Plynth (Water Down the Drain)&quot; from the &quot;Beck-Ola&quot; album) in his Salute to the British Blues Explosion tour featuring the music of Beck, Clapton and Page in July 2016.

On 10 October 2006, Legacy Recordings remastered and reissued the album for compact disc with eight bonus tracks. Included were two earlier takes of &quot;You Shook Me&quot; and &quot;Blues Deluxe&quot;, the latter without the overdubbed applause, and the six tracks making up the three singles by Beck. The B-side to the 1968 single &quot;Love Is Blue&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ve Been Drinking&quot;, was another &quot;Jeffrey Rod&quot; special, this time reconfiguring the Johnny Mercer song &quot;Drinking Again&quot;.

<doc id="1345240" wikidata="Q484534" url="?curid=1345240" title="Guus Hiddink">
<text>Guus Hiddink (; born 8 November 1946) is a Dutch former football manager and professional player. He enjoyed a long career playing as a midfielder in his native Netherlands. Retired as player in 1982, Hiddink went into management, leading both clubs and countries from across the globe to achieve various titles and feats. With PSV Eindhoven he won the European Champions Cup, the predecessor of the UEFA Champions League. With Real Madrid he won the Intercontinental Cup.

==Playing career==
Hiddink was born in Varsseveld and started his career as a player in the youth side of amateur club SC Varsseveld. He turned professional after signing on for Dutch club De Graafschap in 1967. Hiddink played at the Doetinchem club under manager Piet de Visser. In 1973, Hiddink and manager de Visser earned promotion to the Eredivisie, the top league in Dutch football. Ever since, the careers of the two Dutchmen have intersected: De Visser scouted numerous South American players, such as PSV players Ronaldo, Romário (who played under Hiddink at PSV from 1988 until 1990) and former Chelsea defender Alex, for Hiddink&#x27;s PSV. Also, De Visser, in his role as personal advisor to Roman Abramovich, was influential in bringing Hiddink to the Russia national team and later to Chelsea as caretaker manager following the dismissal of Brazilian Luiz Felipe Scolari. 

Hiddink spent most of his playing career at De Graafschap, including three years under de Visser, and remains a fan of the club. He joined PSV in 1970, but after failing to win a permanent position in the team, he rejoined De Graafschap after just one year and remained there until 1977. In 1981, he rejoined De Graafschap and retired a year later. He generally played as a midfielder during his playing days.

==Managerial career==

===Early club career===

Having honed his coaching skills as an assistant manager, Hiddink took over the managerial role at PSV Eindhoven in March 1987 after also holding the assistant manager position for the club from 1983 to March 1987. Hiddink took over in March 1987, whilst the team was trailing by three points behind Ajax with ten matches remaining in the league. PSV, however, managed to win the championship six points ahead of Ajax.

It was at PSV where he led the team to its first ever European Cup triumph in 1988 (and The Treble), affirming the Eindhoven club&#x27;s ranking as one of the three giants of Dutch football, alongside rivals Ajax and Feyenoord. He also won three Eredivisie titles with the club in between 1987 and 1990. &quot;Hiddink will never take all the credit for himself, he will also involve his staff in it. That adds to the strong sense of unity. Hiddink has final responsibility, but always shares it with the team around him. He is a real team player,&quot; said Berry van Aerle, who was coached by Hiddink in two separate periods with PSV.

Overall Hiddink&#x27;s PSV side won three consecutive Eredivisie titles, three consecutive KNVB Cups and the European Cup in the historic Treble-winning season of 1987–88.

Hiddink also had a coaching stint at Turkish club Fenerbahçe in 1990, but was dismissed after one year, later joining Spanish giants Valencia.

===Netherlands national team===
Hiddink faced his biggest managerial challenge when he took over the reins of the Netherlands national team on 1 January 1995, where he took charge of a team of talented individuals continually racked by internal arguments and disputes. His usual 4–4–2 tactic of deploying wingers backed-up by central midfielders resulted in goals from defensive midfielders such as Philip Cocu and Edgar Davids. Hiddink took a firm approach to the team, an example of which was demonstrated at UEFA Euro 1996 when Edgar Davids was sent home after an argument with Hiddink. The team finished in the quarter-finals during UEFA Euro 1996.

He was able to prevent further internal conflict in the 1998 FIFA World Cup where his team played some of the more entertaining football in that tournament. The team beat Argentina in the quarter-finals 2–1, then suffered a defeat at the hands of Brazil on penalties in the semi-final—later finishing fourth. This loss signalled an end of another era for Hiddink, as he resigned as Netherlands national coach soon after, where he was then appointed manager of Spanish giants Real Madrid.

===Real Madrid and Real Betis===
Hiddink became manager of Spanish La Liga side Real Madrid in the summer of 1998, replacing Jupp Heynckes, but poor league form and off-pitch remarks about the board and finances of the club prompted his termination in February 1999.

Hiddink then took over the reins at Spanish club Real Betis in 2000 for the rest of the season. His time at Real Betis ended badly, with Hiddink being sacked by May 2000.

In the summer of 2000, rumours were rife over his future, with Scottish club Celtic among the clubs named as a potential destination. The temptation to manage another World Cup-bound international team proved irresistible to him, however, as he agreed to coach the South Korea national team on 1 January 2001.

===South Korea===
Hiddink became manager of South Korea in January 2001. Success hardly came easy with a team that had appeared in five straight World Cups but had yet to win a single match. South Korea co-hosted the 2002 FIFA World Cup tournament with Japan. Both countries were expected to make the second round of the tournament and it was clearly expressed that Hiddink&#x27;s team was expected to perform to that standard as well.
Hiddink&#x27;s first year in charge was met with heavy criticism from the South Korean media, as he was often spotted together with his girlfriend when some felt he should instead have been busy working on the team. After a 2–1 loss to the United States Gold Cup team in January 2002, he was criticized again for not taking his job seriously. Nevertheless, the team he assembled was a cohesive unit. However, Hiddink began focusing on physical fitness for players during training in preparation for the World Cup later that year.

At the World Cup, Hiddink&#x27;s team achieved its first victory in the tournament&#x27;s history in a 2–0 group win over Poland. After a 1–1 draw with the U.S. and a 1–0 victory against the heavily favoured Portugal, South Korea advanced to the second round.

Their second-round opponents were Italy, whom they upset, 2–1, on a golden goal by Ahn Jung-hwan. The Korean public began to dream of a semifinal berth, something that came true after another upset, this time Spain, on penalties in the quarterfinal. This surpassed the feat of North Korean in the 36 years, when the North beat Italy to reach the quarterfinals.

South Korea&#x27;s miracle run finally ended after Germany under Rudi Völler, won, 1-0, in the semifinals. As with the Dutch team four years before in France, Hiddink led his team to fourth place after a 3–2 defeat to Turkey in the consolation game.

Prior to the tournament, football pundits and fans alike never expected this level of success. Many in South Korea were overjoyed with the semifinal berth. Hiddink became the first-ever person to be given honorary South Korean citizenship. In addition, other rewards soon followed — a private villa in Jeju-do island; free flights for life with Korean Air and Asiana Airlines, free taxi rides, among others. The Gwangju World Cup Stadium in Gwangju, where South Korea qualified for the semi-finals, was renamed Guus Hiddink Stadium in his honor shortly after the tournament. His hometown of Varsseveld, where a &quot;Guuseum&quot; was set up by his relatives in his honor, became a popular stop for South Koreans visiting the Netherlands.

===PSV===
Hiddink chose to return to his native country and took over the coaching duties at PSV Eindhoven in 2002. During his second spell with PSV, Hiddink won three Dutch league titles (2002–03, 2004–05, and 2005–06), the 2005 Dutch Cup and the 2003 Dutch Super Cup. In Europe, the 2004–05 Champions League led to PSV&#x27;s first ever appearance in the semi-final of the tournament since it adopted its current format in 1992–93 (PSV won the European Cup, the predecessor to the modern Champions League, in 1988, with Hiddink as coach). PSV narrowly lost the semi-final to Milan, on away goals.

In the 2005–06 Champions League season, PSV made it through the group stage, but was eliminated in the first knockout round, having lost five of its starting 11 (Park Ji-sung to Manchester United, Lee Young-pyo to Tottenham Hotspur, Mark van Bommel to Barcelona, Johann Vogel to Milan and Wilfred Bouma to Aston Villa) to transfers. This period at PSV made Hiddink the most successful Dutch coach in history, with six Dutch League titles and four Dutch Cups, surpassing the record of Rinus Michels. Hiddink left the club in June 2006.

===Australia===
On 22 July 2005, Hiddink became manager of the Australia national team. He announced he would manage both PSV and Australia at the same time.

In the play-offs held with Uruguay in Montevideo on 12 November and in Sydney on 16 November 2005, both home teams won 1–0. Australia went on to win 4–2 on penalties — the first time Australia had qualified for the finals in 32 years, and the first time that any team had qualified through winning a penalty shoot-out.

Hiddink was a popular figure in Australia and was referred to affectionately as &quot;Aussie Guus.&quot; A telling example of the public affection for him was the Socceroo fans chant of &quot;Goooooooooooos!&quot; during moments of play. Slogans for the Socceroos&#x27; 2006 World Cup campaign were &quot;No Guus, No Glory,&quot; &quot;Guus for P.M.&quot; and &quot;In Guus We Trust,&quot; as well as the play on words of the famous taunt &quot;Guus your Daddy?&quot;. During the World Cup, a Sydney newspaper started a humorous campaign to lure him away from Russia by proposing a national &quot;Guus tax&quot; to pay his wages. More seriously, his reputation was enhanced by his transformation of the national side, with pundits focusing on the improvement to Australia&#x27;s defence. He is credited with turning a team which conceded many goals under Frank Farina into a solid defensive unit which only conceded one goal away from home to both Uruguay and the Netherlands. Hiddink&#x27;s assistants at Australia were Dutch legend Johan Neeskens and former Australia international Graham Arnold.

The Socceroos defeated Japan 3–1 during their first game in the 2006 FIFA World Cup, with Tim Cahill scoring two goals (84&#x27;, 89&#x27;) and John Aloisi scoring one (92&#x27;) all in the last eight minutes to claim their first World Cup goals and victory ever. An early controversial call by the Egyptian referee that awarded a goal to the Japanese team, despite an apparent foul to Australia goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer, had the Australians playing catch up until the last eight minutes. After scoring the first goal, Cahill was lucky to get away with a potential foul when he tripped Japan&#x27;s Yūichi Komano, who had dribbled into the Australian penalty area. The referee missed the incident, and Cahill then broke to score the second on the counter. FIFA&#x27;s spokesman for refereeing Andreas Werz said that while Japan&#x27;s first goal was irregular, Egyptian referee Essam Abdel Fatah should also have given Japan a penalty.

Australia followed the match against Japan with a 2–0 loss to Brazil, leaving the Socceroos needed at least a draw against Croatia in their last group match to qualify for the knockout stages for the first time in its history. After a match fraught with controversy and erroneous decisions from referee Graham Poll, including an unprecedented three yellow cards given to the same Croatian player, ironically the Australian-born Josip Šimunić, the game ended 2–2, and the Socceroos had their draw thanks to a goal from Harry Kewell to level the game with minutes to spare.

In the second round, Italy beat Australia 1–0. After controversially sending off Italian defender Marco Materazzi in the 55th minute, Spanish referee Luis Medina Cantalejo awarded Italy&#x27;s Fabio Grosso a controversial penalty kick eight seconds from the end of normal time, which was converted by Francesco Totti. This put Australia out of the World Cup, marking the official end of Hiddink&#x27;s tenure as Australia&#x27;s national coach.

===Russia===
On 10 April 2006, Hiddink announced on Dutch television that he would take over as manager of the Russia national team. He signed a two-year contract in April 2006 worth €2 million a year. His duties for Russia started after managing Australia during the 2006 World Cup.

Russia&#x27;s Euro 2008 qualification hopes came into question after a 2–1 loss to Israel. However, after a win against Andorra, and England losing out to Croatia on the last match day, Russia and Hiddink secured qualification for the final stages of Euro 2008. At the tournament, the Russians managed to reach the semi-finals with victories against the Netherlands in the quarter-finals and defending champions Greece in the group stage.

Piet de Visser, a former head scout of Hiddink&#x27;s club PSV and now a personal assistant to Roman Abramovich at Chelsea, recommended Hiddink to the Chelsea owner, following the departure of Avram Grant at the end of the 2007–08 Premier League season. In March 2008, however, Hiddink had already chosen to exercise the two-year extension with Russia, keeping him in the national team&#x27;s head coaching role until 2010.

In November 2009, Russia was defeated by Slovenia in a 2010 World Cup qualifying play-off, casting doubt on future ambitions. On 13 February 2010, it was confirmed that Hiddink would leave the position when his contract expired on 30 June.

===Chelsea===
After the sacking of Chelsea&#x27;s manager, the Brazilian Luiz Felipe Scolari, during the 2008–09 Premier League season, Chelsea confirmed on 11 February 2009 that Hiddink would become Scolari&#x27;s replacement until the end of the season, whilst continuing his duties with Russia. Hiddink&#x27;s first game in charge was a 1–0 away victory against Aston Villa at Villa Park. His first game in charge at Stamford Bridge was a 1–0 victory over Juventus in the Champions League knockout stage. Success continued in the form of a 3–1 away victory against Liverpool—commentators stated that Hiddink had rejuvenated Chelsea following Scolari&#x27;s departure. After knocking Liverpool out of the competition, Hiddink went on to take Chelsea to the semi-finals of the Champions League, where the club was eliminated on the away goals rule to eventual winners Barcelona; a 93rd minute Barça goal in a 1–1 controversial draw at Stamford Bridge, preceded by a 0–0 at Camp Nou, sealed Chelsea&#x27;s fate.

Hiddink only lost once during his tenure as Chelsea manager, a 1–0 loss to Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane, where Luka Modrić scored the only goal of the match. As it turned out, even winning every league game in charge would not have been enough to see Hiddink secure the Premier League title. In the final home game of the season, in which Chelsea beat Blackburn Rovers 2–0, Chelsea home fans chanted Hiddink&#x27;s name throughout the match and called for Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich to &quot;sign him up&quot; on a permanent basis. Hiddink&#x27;s highly positive reception highlighted the Chelsea fans&#x27; appreciation of the manager. He marked an end to his Premier League campaign with a 3–2 away win over Sunderland.

In his last game as interim coach of Chelsea, he won the 2009 FA Cup by beating Everton 2–1 at Wembley. He was visibly pleased at winning the Cup, and in subsequent interviews said it was one of his biggest achievements. Even though throughout his tenure at Chelsea various players asked him to stay, including captain John Terry, Michael Ballack and Petr Čech, Hiddink always stated that he intended to return to his post with Russia. As a parting gift, the Chelsea players gave him an engraved watch and a shirt signed by all of the players.

===Turkey===
On 16 February 2010, Turkish Football Federation President Mahmut Özgener and Hiddink held talks in Amsterdam. Hiddink agreed to coach the Turkey national team after his contract with Russia expired on 30 June 2010. His contract with Turkey began on 1 August 2010, and his staff included assistant manager Oğuz Çetin and goalkeeping coach Engin İpekoğlu.

On 11 August 2010, Turkey defeated Romania, 2–0, in an international friendly in Istanbul. Emre Belözoğlu gave Turkey the lead in the 82nd minute after converting a spot kick, followed by Arda Turan doubling the scoreline after netting from 30 yards out. Hiddink resigned following Turkey&#x27;s failure to qualify for Euro 2012 after losing 3–0 on aggregate to Croatia in the playoffs.

===Anzhi Makhachkala===
On 17 February 2012, Hiddink agreed an 18-month deal to manage Russian club Anzhi Makhachkala, his first permanent club post in six years. In his second season, he led the team to the bronze medal in the Russian Premier League, and Anzhi made it to the round of 16 of the UEFA Europa League for the first time. In the quarter-finals of the same competition, having gone down to ten men 55 minutes into the second leg against Newcastle United, Anzhi came close to going through when Mbark Boussoufa&#x27;s free kick hit the post before Papiss Cissé headed home the winner in the last seconds of the tie, meaning the Magpies won 1–0 on aggregate. This was the second time that the English side have knocked out a team managed by Hiddink in the competition, having beaten his PSV side 3–2 on aggregate in the quarter-finals of the 2003–04 season. He announced his retirement at the end of the 2012–13 season on 28 November 2012, but later changed his mind.

On 11 June 2013, Hiddink decided to extend his contract by one more year at Anzhi. Just two games into the 2013–14 Russian Premier League season after a 2–1 defeat at Dynamo Moscow, however, he unexpectedly resigned on 22 July 2013. He said he left because he completed his mission, which he said was to develop Anzhi in a way that it could progress without him.

===Return to Netherlands national team===
On 28 March 2014, it was announced that Hiddink would return to manage the Dutch national team after Louis van Gaal would step down following the 2014 World Cup. Hiddink agreed to manage the team up to UEFA Euro 2016, with Danny Blind and Ruud van Nistelrooy assisting him and Blind to eventually replace him. His second spell in charge of the team began with a 2–0 defeat to Italy in a friendly on 4 September 2014, with both goals conceded and a red card received within the first ten minutes of the match. Five days later, the Dutch began their UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying campaign with a 2–1 defeat away to the Czech Republic, a 3–1 victory against Kazakhstan and a 2–0 defeat in the hands of Iceland a month later.

The 2015 calendar year began in March with a match against Turkey, ending in a 1–1 draw. On 29 June 2015, Hiddink left his position. Two days later, he was succeeded by his assistant, Danny Blind. It was unknown for a long time whether Hiddink was fired or left his position voluntarily, but on 21 November 2015, he said, whilst on vacation in France, that he was fired from the post.

===Return to Chelsea===
On 19 December 2015, Hiddink was appointed first-team manager of English side Chelsea until the end of the 2015–16 season, following the dismissal of José Mourinho; he joined the club in the same capacity he did back in 2009. After being made interim manager, Hiddink spoke, saying he was &quot;excited to return to Stamford Bridge&quot; and &quot;I am looking forward to working with the players and staff at this great club and especially renewing my wonderful relationship with the Chelsea fans.&quot; After the home draw against Stoke City, Hiddink set a new record for the longest unbeaten streak as a new manager in the Premier League with 12 games unbeaten.

Chelsea ended the season in tenth place in the Premier League, climbing six positions from 16th upon Hiddink&#x27;s arrival.

===China U21===
On 10 September 2018, Hiddink took over the China under-21 national team but was fired in September 2019 after a string of disappointing results, culminating with a 2–0 defeat against Vietnam under-22 men&#x27;s team. The coach of the Vietnamese team coincidentally was Park Hang-seo, assistant coach of South Korea&#x27;s national team in the 2002 World Cup under Hiddink.

===Curaçao and retirement from management===
On 21 August 2020, Hiddink was appointed manager of the Curaçao national team.

After failing to lead the nation to 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification, Hiddink contracted COVID-19 in 2021, prompting Patrick Kluivert to step in as interim manager of the team. On 9 September 2021, Hiddink officially stepped down as head coach of Curaçao and announced his managerial retirement at the age of 74.

Hiddink came out of retirement to assist his former Socceroos assistant, Graham Arnold, for Australia&#x27;s two-match friendly series against New Zealand, as regular assistant coach René Meulensteen was scouting the Socceroos&#x27; Qatar 2022 opponents in Europe.

The temporary arrangement formed part of the Socceroos&#x27; centenary celebrations. Hiddink was on the Australian bench for their 1–0 win in Brisbane on September 22, 2022, and in Auckland three days later.

==Tax evasion==
In February 2007, Hiddink was given a six-month suspended jail sentence and fined €45,000 after being found guilty of tax evasion by a Dutch court. Prosecutors had demanded a ten-month prison sentence for Hiddink, who was accused of evading €1.4 million in Dutch taxes by claiming to be a resident of Belgium from 2002 to 2003. The Dutch Tax Intelligence and Detection Service claimed that he had not spent enough nights at his Belgian house which he had stated was his primary address. Hiddink denied this accusation.

<text>The Thief of Always is a 1992 novel written and illustrated by Clive Barker. The plot concerns a 10-year-old boy who journeys to a magical house, only to discover its master uses the home to attract children and steal their youth to ensure his own immortality.

==Plot==
&quot;The Thief of Always&quot; follows the adventure of Harvey Swick, a bored and discontented young boy who is lured away by the enigmatic Mr. Hood to the Holiday House, a fantastical place promising endless fun and excitement. At first, Harvey is delighted by the wonders of the house, where every day is filled with new activities and adventures.

However, Harvey soon realizes that something is amiss. He notices that time seems to pass unusually quickly within the house, and he becomes suspicious of Mr. Hood and his intentions. With the help of other children trapped in the Holiday House, including Wendell, Lulu, and the mysterious Rictus, Harvey discovers the dark secret of the house: it feeds on the life force of its inhabitants, draining them of their vitality.

Determined to escape and save himself and the other children, Harvey embarks on a perilous journey to confront Mr. Hood and reclaim the stolen time. Along the way, he faces numerous challenges and dangers, including the monstrous inhabitants of the house and the seductive allure of its illusions.

In the end, Harvey confronts Mr. Hood in a climactic showdown and manages to defeat him, freeing himself and the other children from the Holiday House&#x27;s grasp. With the help of a magical creature named Jive, Harvey returns home, forever changed by his experiences but wiser and more appreciative of the value of time and the importance of cherishing the present moment.

==Reception==

<doc id="1345247" wikidata="Q1964467" url="?curid=1345247" title="Nancowry Island">
<text>Nancowry (Nancowry language: &quot;Mūöt&quot;, Hindi: नन्कोव्री &quot;Nankovrī&quot;) is an island in the central part of the Nicobar Islands chain, located in the northeast Indian Ocean between the Bay of Bengal and the Andaman Sea.

==History==
In 1755, the government of Denmark formally claimed sovereignty over Nicobars, under the name of &quot;Frederiksøerne&quot; (&quot;Frederik Islands&quot;) and encouraged a mission established by the Moravian Brethren of Herrnhut. The Danes established a short-lived colony on the island which they named &quot;Ny Sjælland&quot; (&quot;New Zealand&quot;).

Along with Kamorta Island, which lies just to the north, Nancowry Island forms the &quot;magnificent land-locked&quot; Nancowry Harbour, used by European sailors since at least the 17th century and described as &quot;one of the safest natural harbours in the world&quot; (). The harbour was apparently used as a base for piracy; in 1868, the British Navy entered the harbour in some force, destroying suspected pirate ships.

===2004 tsunami===
The island, like many others in the Nicobar and Andaman islands, was severely affected by tsunamis generated by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. According to reports from the Andaman and Nicobar Inspector General of Police, S.B. Deol, the Nancowry group of islands were among the worst-hit islands in the chain, with thousands missing and presumed dead. Post-tsunami satellite photos, and government situation reports indicate that while portions of Nancowry Island were affected, the adjoining islands of Katchall and Kamorta were more severely overrun. As of January 18, 2005, the government reported only 1 dead and 3 missing from Nancowry island, but 51 dead and 387 missing from Kamorta, and 345 dead and 4310 missing from Katchall.

==Geography==
Nancowry Island has an area of 47 km², and located 160 km south-southeast of Car Nicobar, the northernmost Nicobar island. Nancowry, like the Nicobar islands generally, is under the sovereignty of the nation of India. It is also part of the Nicobar and Andaman Tribal Reserve Area, which bars non-native people from visiting or conducting business on the island without permission in hopes of preserving the threatened native communities that live there.

== People, Culture and Religion ==
Nancowry Island, part of the southern islands in the central Nicobar group, holds significant importance. Its inhabitants, the Nicobarese, have a lifestyle deeply connected to nature. Their diet primarily includes sea fish, wild pigs, edible roots, coconuts, bananas, and pandanus. However, noticeable changes are taking place due to frequent contact with the mainlanders. The Andaman &amp; Nicobar Administration recently unveiled a development draft for Nancowry and nine other islands. These plans aim to preserve ecosystems while promoting sustainable tourism infrastructure, incorporating maps that designate areas for eco-tourism, conservation, and business activities.

The Nicobarese family on Nancowry Island typically consists of a husband, wife, and children, though extended family members like cousins and distant relatives are often part of the household. Each member plays a vital role in the community&#x27;s social and economic welfare. Traditionally, the Nicobarese practiced animism and held beliefs in spirits. However, exposure to Christianity and increased interaction with mainlanders have gradually influenced and transformed their ancestral beliefs.

== Climate ==
The island features undulating meadows and hilly, grass-covered terrain. Sea breezes help to moderate its tropical climate. The typical temperature ranges between 23°C and 30°C, or roughly 70°F and 80°F. An average of 3,000 to 3,800 mm of rain falls on the area each year; the monsoon seasons—the northeast monsoon from October to December and the southwest monsoon from May to September—bring more rainfall.

==Administration==
The island belongs to Nancowry tehsil of the township of Nancowry.

<doc id="1345250" wikidata="Q5110338" url="?curid=1345250" title="Materialism and Christianity">
<text>Some Christian theologians embrace a holistic combination of Christian theology with &quot;some&quot; ideas of (ontological) materialism, a belief that matter is a fundamental substance of the world and that mental phenomena result from matter.

==Historical background==

Throughout history, Christian thought has struggled with the ideas of flesh, world, and spirit, and their interplay in each person&#x27;s salvation. As Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (Pope Benedict XVI) said in &quot;What It Means To Be a Christian&quot; (2006), &quot;Christian theology... in the course of time turned the kingdom of God into a kingdom of heaven that is beyond this mortal life; the well-being of men became a salvation of souls, which again comes to pass beyond this life, after death.&quot;

This tendency of spiritualization, Ratzinger said, is not the message of Jesus Christ. &quot;For what is sublime in this message,&quot; he stated, &quot;is precisely that the Lord was talking not just about another life, not just about men&#x27;s souls, but was addressing the body, the whole man, in his embodied form, with his involvement in history and society; that he promised the kingdom of God to the man who lives bodily with other men in this history.&quot;

Christian materialism is a widely discussed position in contemporary analytic philosophy of religion, defended by figures such as Peter van Inwagen and Trenton Merricks.

Pope John Paul II&#x27;s &quot;Theology of the Body&quot; lectures asserted that &quot;The body, and it alone, is capable of making visible ... the spiritual and divine.&quot;

Christopher West, in reviewing the words of Pope John Paul II, asserted
Archbishop William Temple has remarked that Christianity is &quot;the most avowedly materialist of all the great religions.&quot;
===Rejection of &#x27;materialism&#x27;===
According to Constantin Gutberlet writing in &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; (1911), &quot;materialism&quot;, defined as &quot;a philosophical system which regards matter as the only reality in the world…denies the existence of God and the soul.&quot; In this view, materialism could be perceived incompatible with world religions that ascribe existence to immaterial objects. Materialism may be conflated with atheism; according to Friedrich A. Lange (1892), &quot;Diderot has not always in the Encyclopædia expressed his own individual opinion, but it is just as true that at its commencement he had not yet got as far as Atheism and Materialism.&quot;

Mary Baker Eddy, the founder of the Christian Science movement, denied the existence of matter on the basis of the allness of Mind (which she regarded as a synonym for God).

===Josemaría Escrivá and Opus Dei===

The most visible use of the term is found in the writings of Josemaría Escrivá, a Spanish Catholic saint of the twentieth century, who said that all temporal realities have a sanctifying power and Christians can find God in the most ordinary material things. As such, it is associated with the Roman Catholic prelature of Opus Dei which Escriva founded. It is an organization which teaches that everyone is called to holiness and that ordinary life, even the most material activity, is a path to sanctity.

Escriva criticized those who &quot;have tried to present the Christian way of life as something exclusively spiritual, proper to pure, extraordinary people, who remain aloof from the contemptible things of this world, or at most tolerate them as something necessarily attached to the spirit, while we live on this earth. When things are seen in this way, churches become the setting par excellence of the Christian life. And being a Christian means going to church, taking part in sacred ceremonies, being taken up with ecclesiastical matters, in a kind of segregated world, which is considered to be the ante-chamber of heaven, while the ordinary world follows its own separate path.&quot;

Instead, he affirmed the &quot;high value of the material.&quot; According to him, &quot;Authentic Christianity which professes the resurrection of all flesh, has always quite logically opposed &#x27;dis-incarnation,&#x27; without fear of being judged materialistic. We can, therefore, rightfully speak of a &quot;Christian materialism&quot;, which is boldly opposed to those materialisms which are blind to the spirit.&quot; (Italics and emphasis added)

In an address to a theological symposium, &quot;Holiness and the World&quot;, which studied the teachings of Josemaria Escriva, John Paul II referred to one of his homilies:

:There is nothing that is outside of the concern of Christ. Speaking with theological rigor ... one cannot say that there are things — good, noble or even indifferent — which are exclusively profane; for the Word of God has made his dwelling the sons of men, he was hungry and thirsty, worked with his hands, knew friendship and obedience, experienced sorrow and death.

In connection with this quote, John Paul II said that the Catholic Church today is &quot;conscious of serving a redemption that concerns every aspect of human existence,&quot; an awareness which was &quot;prepared by a gradual intellectual and spiritual development.&quot; He also said that the message of Escriva, which has contributed in this direction, stems &quot;from a unique grasp of the radiant, universal force of the Redeemer&#x27;s grace.&quot; He later called Escriva &quot;one of Christianity&#x27;s great witnesses.&quot;

==Relation with &quot;materialistic values&quot;==
The term &quot;materialistic&quot; is also used pejoratively in the sense of &quot;economic&quot; materialism. 

Rowan Williams, in a lecture to Welsh Centre for International Affairs, asserts that

Prosperity theology which has been criticised as &quot;materialistic&quot;.
Prosperity theology in the eyes of Simon Coleman (anthropologist) and Kate Bowler (2013) is influenced by New Thought. New Thought, to William James, has roots in idealist rather than materialist ontology.
==List==
=== Christianity and dialectical materialism ===
* Denys Turner, Catholic theologian and Marxist who remarked that the hylomorphism of Thomas Aquinas had materialistic traits and asserted &quot;strong compatibility&quot; between Marxist materialism and Christian Theism. Unlike many contemporary materialists, he uses &#x27;materialism&#x27; to &quot;argue for&quot;, rather than against, the resurrection and immortality of the body. He is an Opus Dei member. 
* Y. T. Wu and much of Sino-Christian theology
* Marxism and religion#Communism and Christianity
* Liberation theology, as claimed by Pope Benedict XVI

* Slavoj Žižek

=== Ontological-materialist Christian philosophers espousing Mechanism (philosophy) or Mechanical philosophy ===
* Thomas Hobbes
* Pierre Gassendi

=== Non-Nicene writers ===
* Joseph Priestley and Dissent

*Joseph Smith, the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, taught: &quot;There is no such thing as immaterial matter. All spirit is matter, but it is more fine or pure, and can only be discerned by purer eyes; We cannot see it; but when our bodies are purified we shall see that it is all matter.&quot; This spirit element is believed to always have existed and to be co-eternal with God.
*Parley P. Pratt stated that &quot;God, the father is material. Jesus Christ is material. Angels are material. Spirits are material. Men are material. The universe is material ... Nothing exists which is not material.&quot;

<doc id="1345251" wikidata="Q9456" url="?curid=1345251" title="Achterhoek">
<text>The Achterhoek (; ) is a cultural region and COROP area in the Eastern Netherlands.
Its name (meaning &quot;rear-corner&quot;) is geographically appropriate because the area lies in the easternmost part of the province of Gelderland and therefore in the east of the Netherlands, protruding into Germany. The Achterhoek lies at the east of the IJssel. On the other sides, it borders Germany to the southeast and the province of Overijssel to the northeast.

In 2015, the Achterhoek had a population of 389,682. The region is also called de Graafschap (Dutch for earldom, shire or county; namesake of VBV De Graafschap in Doetinchem) because it coincides with the historical County of Zutphen. The region is predominantly rural, with much open space, forests and farms. The area around the town of Winterswijk is regarded as noteworthy. A well-known beer originates from this region: Grolsch beer was first brewed in Groenlo in 1615.

==Language==
The original languages of the Achterhoek are Achterhooks and Kleverlandish, varieties of Low Saxon and South Guelderish (classified as Low Franconian dialects). The language can also differ per municipality or town, even in such a way that a person speaking the &#x27;Grols&#x27; variant (meaning the dialect of Groenlo) will pronounce words differently from a person from Winterswijk which is merely 10 km (6.2 mi) to the east, although they will probably understand each other.

The number of inhabitants whose sole language is Achterhooks has greatly declined since World War II. People in the Achterhoek are raised with Dutch at school and the dialect is only spoken (sometimes) at home. Partly due to immigration from outside the region and the effects of national policy, the Dutch language is having a significant impact on the dialect. Many old words have been forgotten and replaced by their Dutch-derived equivalents.

==Economy==

Export Products
*Export value of 20%: meat, dairy, fruits, and other crops.
*Potatoes, among others, by Aviko.
*Animal feeds, among others, by ForFarmers.
*Technological products (such as Nedap) with over 25% export value.

==Tourism==
The downsizing of agriculture has contributed to the emergence of rural tourism within the region. The area is popular among those seeking peace or an active vacation. Various activities such as cycling (such as the 80-year-war route, Arfgoodroute), hiking, horseback riding, nordic walking, carriage rides, canoeing, and hot air ballooning, as well as stays at recreation lakes, such as Stroombroek, Slingeplas, and Hilgelo, are popular among tourists. Doetinchem, Braamt, Bronkhorst and Zutphen
are the most popular tourist destinations.

The majority of tourists visiting the Achterhoek region are from other European countries, including Germany, Belgium, Denmark, and Ireland.

==Municipalities==
The largest cities in the Achterhoek are Doetinchem, Winterswijk and Zutphen. Doesburg and Zutphen are old Hanseatic cities. Both have centres with well-preserved historical buildings.

<doc id="1345253" wikidata="Q1446005" url="?curid=1345253" title="Weaveworld">
<text>Weaveworld is a 1987 dark fantasy novel by English writer Clive Barker. It is about a magical world that is hidden inside a tapestry, known as the Fugue, to safeguard it from both inquisitive humans and hostile supernatural foes. Two humans become embroiled in the fate of the Fugue, attempting to save it from those who seek to destroy it. The book was nominated in 1988 for the World Fantasy Award for Best Novel.

==Plot summary==
Decades prior to the book&#x27;s opening, a magical race known as the Seerkind combined all of their powers to create a secret world known as &quot;the Fugue&quot;, a carpet into which they wove their most beloved locations, animals, possessions and themselves as a safe haven. Their aim was to avoid persecution by humans (who call them demons and fairies) and eradication by a destructive being known as the Scourge. This creature&#x27;s nature is entirely unknown to the Seerkind, as no-one has survived to describe it. The Fugue, resembling an ordinary, albeit exquisitely woven, carpet is left in the care of a human woman, Mimi Laschenski, who married one of the Seerkind and resides in Liverpool, England.

Mimi reaches old age and is hospitalised following a stroke. A young man named Calhoun Mooney, chasing an escaped homing pigeon, accidentally glimpses the Fugue hidden in the carpet, which profoundly affects him. Simultaneously, Mimi&#x27;s granddaughter Suzanna Parrish arrives in the city at Mimi&#x27;s behest. The mystery surrounding Mimi and the full potential of the carpet brings Cal and Suzanna together and quickly into confrontation with the primary antagonists: Immacolata, an exiled and extremely powerful Seerkind bent on revenge; Shadwell, a human salesman with limitless ambition; and Hobart, a conscientious policeman.

Cal and Suzanna acquire new allies and abilities in their goal of protecting the Fugue from destruction, venturing into it themselves twice. When Shadwell&#x27;s actions result in the Fugue&#x27;s seemingly total obliteration, the surviving Seerkind scatter. In a last desperate attempt to finish them, Shadwell locates and awakens the Scourge, which begins systematically destroying any and all traces of magic it can find.

Cal, Suzanna and their remaining allies make a final stand against Shadwell by using his own tactics against him and convince the Scourge to abandon its cause and leave the planet in peace. In the aftermath, a severely traumatised Cal is cared for by Suzanna whilst their friends adjust to permanent life amongst humanity. Eventually, Cal emerges from his withdrawal with the knowledge of how the Fugue is still alive and can be restored to its full glory.

==Critical reception==
Reviewing &quot;Weaveworld&quot; in the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, Henry Mietkiewicz wrote that &quot;Barker proves to be far more accomplished and self-assured than in any of his previous work...&quot;Weaveworld&quot; depends upon a relatively intricate narrative structure and a host of finely crafted characters&quot;.

Dave Langford reviewed &quot;Weaveworld&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #96, and stated that &quot;&#x27;dark fantasy&#x27; is today&#x27;s posh word for &#x27;horror&#x27;; Barker&#x27;s considerable talents in this area lead to a few gobs of gratuitous nastiness and also some terrific creations&quot;.

==Comic book adaptation==
&quot;Weaveworld&quot; was made into a three-issue comic series in 1991 by Epic Comics. The series were written by Erik Saltzgaber and pencilled by Mike Manley. Clive Barker served as consultant.

==Mini-series adaptation==
Novelist and screenwriter Michael Marshall Smith completed a first draft of a script for an eight-hour mini-series in 1995. Smith was later asked to write a complete script, but the project has fallen into hiatus and he is no longer involved. In 2001, Barker stated in an interview that a Showtime six-hour mini-series was about to enter a two-year preproduction stage, directed by &quot;Queer as Folk&quot; director Russell Mulcahy, probably shot in Australia.

In 2005, Barker said that the book had been adapted into a mini-series, and later said that the mini-series adaptation was about to enter production.

In September 2015, CW network announced a TV series adaptation of the book, to be written and produced by &quot;Warehouse 13&quot;″s Jack Kenny and produced by Clive Barker.

<text>Richard Hutson (July 9, 1748 – April 12, 1795) was a Founding Father of the United States and an American lawyer, judge, politician, and planter from Charleston, South Carolina. He was born in June 1747 to Rev. William Hutson and Mary Hutson (née Woodward). His family moved to Charleston in 1756 when his father was the pastor at the Circular Congregational Church. After having been educated in Charleston as a child, he attended Princeton.

In 1778 and 1779 he represented South Carolina as a delegate to the Continental Congress, where he signed the Articles of Confederation. After the British captured Charleston in May 1780, he was held as a prisoner at St. Augustine, Florida until July 1781. After he returned home, he served as the eighth lieutenant governor of South Carolina under Governor John Mathews in 1782 and 1783. On September 11, 1783, Hutson was elected the first intendant (mayor) of Charleston. He was re-elected on September 13, 1784, winning against Alexander Gillon by a vote of 387 to 127. After his time as intendant of Charleston, he was one of the first three chancellors of the Court of Equity of South Carolina.

He is buried in a vault at the Independent Congregational (Circular) Churchyard in Charleston.

He is often considered by some Austrian historians to be one of the most adept naval officers of the 19th-century, due to his tactical inventiveness, sense of command, and inspirational leadership.

==Early life and career==
Tegetthoff was born in Marburg, Duchy of Styria in the Austrian Empire (now Maribor, Slovenia), on 23 December 1827. He was the son of Karl von Tegetthoff, an &quot;Oberstleutnant&quot; in the Austrian Army. On his mother&#x27;s side he was related to Johann Kaspar Freiherr von Seiller, mayor of Vienna from 1851 to 1861. Entering the &quot;Marinecollegium&quot; (naval academy) in Venice in 1840, Tegetthoff became a &quot;Seekadett&quot; on 23 July 1845 and witnessed the Venetian uprising in 1848/49. He received a commission upon his graduation on 16 April 1849 and took part in the blockade of Venice from May to August 1849. Tegetthoff was promoted to &quot;Fregattenleutnant&quot; on 16 June 1851 and &quot;Linienschiffsleutnant&quot; on 16 November 1852.

Tegetthoff received his first command, the naval schooner &quot;Elisabeth&quot;, in 1854. This was at the time of the Austrian Navy&#x27;s intensive conversion to steam power, of which he was an earnest advocate. In 1855 he was appointed commander of the paddle steamer &quot;Taurus&quot;, patrolling the Sulina mouth of the Danube during the Crimean War. This service brought him to the favorable notice of Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian of Austria, the &quot;Oberkommandant der Marine&quot; (High Commander of the Navy), with whom he had been acquainted since 1850. Promoted to &quot;Korvettenkapitän&quot; in 1857, Tegetthoff served on a semi-official scientific expedition to the Red Sea and to the island of Socotra. Having shown exceptional diplomatic and organizational ability, in December 1857 he was appointed a staff officer. He was named commander in 1858 of the new screw corvette on the coast of Morocco, then in a confused state of disorder.

The Italian campaign of 1859 saw the Austrians unable to challenge the French fleet for mastery of the Adriatic. With the return of peace, Tegetthoff accompanied Ferdinand Maximilian, who was to be the future Maximilian I of Mexico, on a voyage to Brazil to visit Emperor Pedro II during the winter of 1859/60. Promoted &quot;Fregattenkapitän&quot; on 27 April 1860 and &quot;Linienschiffskapitän&quot; on 23 November 1861, he was named commander of the Levant Squadron in 1862. In this capacity, he monitored the Greek revolution that deposed King Otto I and the anti-Western disturbances in Syria.

==Second Schleswig War==

During the Second Schleswig War, Tegetthoff as a &quot;Kommodore&quot; was given command, in February 1864, of a small Austrian squadron that sailed to the North Sea to support the weaker Prussian naval forces against the superior Danish navy which was blockading northern German ports. He was engaged by a Danish squadron commanded by Edouard Suenson at the Battle of Heligoland, in which Tegetthoff&#x27;s flagship, the screw frigate , caught fire in a close-range gunnery fight with the Danish frigates &quot;Niels Juel&quot; and &quot;Jylland&quot;. Although the action was a tactical defeat for Tegetthoff, he achieved his main objective since the Danish squadron was shortly thereafter recalled to Copenhagen, lifting the blockade of the Elbe and Weser ports. Tegetthoff&#x27;s telegraphic dispatch was answered by Emperor Franz Josef I with another on 12 May 1864 promoting him &quot;Kontreadmiral&quot; (Rear Admiral) and conferring upon him the Order of the Iron Crown.

==Seven Weeks&#x27; War==
Tegetthoff was appointed commander of the Austrian battle fleet on 9 May 1866, shortly before the Seven Weeks&#x27; War against Italy. Although the Italian fleet was larger and more powerful, Tegetthoff decided to engage it after a successful reconnaissance of the Italian base of Ancona on 27 June 1866. With their army suffering defeats against the Austrians during the first week of the war from 20 to 27 June 1866, the Italians sought a victory over the Austrian navy by sending their fleet against the Austrian naval base at Lissa, off the coast of Dalmatia near Spàlato (Split) on 16 July 1866. Encountering the Italian fleet early on the morning of 20 July 1866, Tegetthoff sailed straight for the center of the Italian fleet, hoping to ram the ships to make up for his own fleet&#x27;s lack of firepower (&quot;Rammstoßtaktik&quot;). The smoke from the Italian ships made visibility very poor, however, and the Austrians missed the Italian fleet completely. Swinging around, Tegetthoff again charged, this time setting two Italian armored ships on fire and damaging several more.

After Tegetthoff&#x27;s flagship, the , rammed and sank the armored Italian frigate &quot;Re d&#x27;Italia&quot;, the Italian fleet retreated the next day. Tegetthoff returned in triumph to his base at Pula. Nevertheless, his victory did not materially affect the outcome of the war, as Italy&#x27;s alliance with Prussia ensured an advantageous peace due to Prussian victory in the Austro-Prussian War. Tegetthoff was immediately promoted, by telegraph, to &quot;Vizeadmiral&quot; (Vice Admiral). He received congratulatory telegrams from Ferdinand Maximilian, by then the embattled Emperor of Mexico, and &quot;Vizeadmiral&quot; Hans Birch Dahlerup, former &quot;Oberkommandant der Marine&quot; (High Commandant of the Navy). Tegetthoff was decorated with the Commander&#x27;s Cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresa and made honorary citizen of Vienna.

Following the victory of Lissa, Tegetthoff urged Franz Josef to annex the hinterland of the Dalmatian coast, so as to protect the region for development of naval bases. This was in fact accomplished with the occupation (1878) and annexation (1908) of Bosnia and Herzegovina, though long after Tegetthoff&#x27;s death.

Tegetthoff undertook a journey of study to France, Britain and the United States in 1866/67. Upon the execution of Ferdinand Maximilian by the Mexican government of Benito Juárez, Tegetthoff was sent with the screw frigate &quot;Novara&quot; to bring his body home to Austria, arriving in the port of Trieste on 16 January 1868.

==Late years==
He received the post of &quot;Marinekommandant&quot;, as the chief administrative officer was named in 1865 in succession of Viceadmiral Ludwig von Fautz. In March 1868 Tegetthoff took also charge as &quot;Chef der Marinesektion&quot; (Chief of the Naval Section) of the War Ministry of the new dual monarchy. Despite considerable resistance from the General Staff, he vigorously pursued a complete reform of the Austro-Hungarian Navy; his reforms remained in force until the fall of the &quot;Donaumonarchie&quot; in 1918.

On 1 April 1868 Tegetthoff was made a &quot;Geheimrat&quot; and a member of the &quot;Herrenhaus&quot;. 
Tegetthoff died suddenly from pneumonia on 7 April 1871 in Vienna at the age of 43. His grave is located in the cemetery of St. Leonhard in Graz.

He was succeeded as head of the naval administration by Friedrich von Pöck.

== Memorials ==


Memorials to Tegetthoff were erected in Maribor, Vienna and Pula. The monument on Vienna&#x27;s Praterstern, the largest traffic junction of the city, consists of a column 11 meters high (by Karl Hasenauer), topped by a bronze statue of Tegetthoff, some 3.5 meters in height, by Carl Kundmann and was finished in 1886. The memorial at Pula, also by Kundmann, was erected in 1877 and consists of a bronze statue of Tegetthoff, with supporting bronze mythological figures. Pula passed to Italian sovereignty in 1919, and in 1935 the monument was moved to Graz, Austria.

Tegetthoff was pictured on an Austrian postage stamp in 1935 and on a 20-euro coin minted in 2004 (see below).
Ships named for Tegetthoff included:
* The arctic research ship SMS &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; (1872).
* The central battery ship – renamed SMS &quot;Mars&quot; in 1912.
* The dreadnought battleship .

Of these, the first was used in the 1872–74 arctic expedition of Julius von Payer and Karl Weyprecht which discovered Franz Josef Land in 1873. The expedition&#x27;s first discovery was named Cape Tegetthoff.

<text>Anggun Cipta Sasmi (; born 29 April 1974), known mononymously as Anggun, is an Indonesian-French singer, songwriter, and television personality. Born in Jakarta, she began performing at the age of seven and recorded a children&#x27;s album two years later. She rose to fame in 1989 as a teenage rock star and by 1993 she had released five Indonesian-language studio albums. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; listed her single &quot;Mimpi&quot; as one of the 150 Greatest Indonesian Songs of All Time.

Anggun left Indonesia for England in 1994 to pursue an international career. She later moved to France and recorded her first international album, &quot;Snow on the Sahara&quot; (1997). It was released in 33 countries by Sony Music and sold more than one million copies worldwide. Since then, Anggun has released another six studio albums—in English and French—and a soundtrack album to the Danish film &quot;Open Hearts&quot; (2002). Her singles &quot;Snow on the Sahara&quot;, &quot;What We Remember&quot;, &quot;The Good Is Back&quot;, and &quot;Perfect World&quot; entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts in the United States while &quot;In Your Mind&quot;, &quot;Saviour&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Alright&quot; charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; European Hot 100 Singles. She represented France in the Eurovision Song Contest 2012, with the song &quot;Echo (You and I)&quot;.

Anggun ventured into television, becoming the judge for the Indonesian versions of &quot;The X Factor&quot; (2013), &quot;Got Talent&quot; (2014), and &quot;The Voice&quot; (2018); the pancontinental &quot;Asia&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; (2015–2019); the French version of &quot;Masked Singer&quot; (2019–2022); and the Belgian version of &quot;StarMaker&quot; (2023). She was the leading actress in musical theater show &quot;Al Capone&quot; (2023) and played supporting roles in the film &quot;Coup de foudre à Bangkok&quot; (2020) and TV series &quot;Profession Comédien&quot; (2021). Aside from her career in entertainment, Anggun has been appointed as the global ambassador of the United Nations twice, first for the International Year of Microcredit in 2005 and then for the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in 2009.

Anggun is one of the best-selling Asian artists outside Asia, with her releases certified gold and platinum in some European countries. She is the first Indonesian artist to have success in European and American record charts. She has received accolades for her achievements, including the Chevalier des Arts et Lettres from the Government of France, the World Music Award for World&#x27;s Best-Selling Indonesian Artist, and the Asian Television Award for Outstanding Contribution to Asian Television Performing Arts. She became the first woman from Indonesia to be immortalized in wax by Madame Tussauds.

==Life and career==

===1974–1993: Early life and career in Indonesia===

Anggun was born in Jakarta on 29 April 1974. She is the second child of Darto Singo, a Javanese writer, and Dien Herdina, a housewife from the Yogyakarta royal family. Her full name means &quot;grace born of a dream&quot;. Despite being a Muslim, Anggun was sent to a Catholic school to receive a better elementary education. At the age of seven, Anggun began receiving daily strict instructions in singing and was given homework to write poems with the melodies that could become a song, aimed at triggering her songwriting skills, by her father. Even though her father was not a singer, he guided her to improve her vocal skill by following the instructions in a vocal practicing book written by Bina Vokalia vocal coach Pranadjaja. Her mother began serving as her manager. At the age of nine, Anggun started writing her own songs and recorded her debut album, which featured covers of songs by Indonesian country singer Ritta Rubby Hartland, titled &quot;Kepada Alam dan Pencintanya&quot; (1983). However, the album was not published until she gained recognition in the early 1990s.

In adolescence, Anggun was influenced by Western rock music and she began to choose her career as a rock singer. In 1986, she met Ian Antono, the guitarist and music producer of God Bless, and released her first commercial studio album, &quot;Dunia Aku Punya&quot;; however, it did not achieve commercial success. She rose to fame three years later, with the single &quot;Mimpi&quot;; it was ranked by &quot;Rolling Stone Indonesia&quot; as one of the 150 Greatest Indonesian Songs of All Time. In the early 1990s she released hit singles such as &quot;Tua Tua Keladi&quot;, &quot;Laba Laba&quot;, and &quot;Takut&quot;. She recorded the studio albums &quot;Anak Putih Abu Abu&quot; (1991) and &quot;Nocturno&quot; (1992). The former earned her the Most Popular Indonesian Artist 1990–1991 award.

In 1992, Anggun began a relationship with Michel Georgea, a French engineer. They married, despite a rumoured objection by Anggun&#x27;s family on the grounds that Anggun was too young. Georgea later became Anggun&#x27;s manager. The following year, Anggun became the youngest Indonesian singer to found her own record company, Bali Cipta Records, taking creative control over her work. She produced her fourth (fifth overall) Indonesian studio album, &quot;Anggun C. Sasmi... Lah!!!&quot; (1993), which yielded the hit song &quot;Kembalilah Kasih (Kita Harus Bicara)&quot;. By age nineteen, she had sold over four million albums in Indonesia. She was dissatisfied with her success in her country and began considering an international music career.

===1994–1999: International breakthrough with &quot;Snow on the Sahara&quot;===

==Artistry and legacy==

Anggun possesses a three-octave contralto voice, which has been described as &quot;husky&quot;, &quot;soulful&quot;, and &quot;distinctive&quot; by music critics. Chuck Taylor from &quot;Billboard&quot; commented: &quot;Vocally, Anggun is a fortress of power, easing from a delicate whisper into a brand of cloud-parting fortitude commonly associated with grade-A divas.&quot; John Everson from &quot;The SouthtownStar&quot; noted that &quot;Anggun is gifted with a warm, full voice that can tackle slight pop songs without overpowering them as well as swoop with depth and ease over heavier emotional numbers.&quot; Anggun received her first songwriting credit at the age of twelve on her debut album &quot;Dunia Aku Punya&quot; (1986). Anggun said, &quot;I was writing songs all the time, but my specialty was classical piano and singing.&quot;

Anggun started as a rock singer and given nickname as &quot;Lady Rocker&quot; in Indonesia, and was influenced by rock bands such as Guns N&#x27; Roses, Bon Jovi, and Megadeth. She was a big fan of Metallica. After her initial international success, she showed her versatility by changing her musical style for each album. Her later influences cover a wide range of styles from jazz to pop, extending from Joni Mitchell to Madonna. She told VOGUE Italia that she listened to wide range of artists from The Beatles to David Bowie, Billie Holiday to Leonard Cohen, up to Dave Grohl, P!nk and Bruno Mars. Anggun identified Nine Inch Nails&#x27;s &quot;The Fragile&quot; (1999) as &quot;the album that changed my life&quot; and the band&#x27;s frontman Trent Reznor as &quot;the man of my musical life.&quot; Her other musical influences include Tracy Chapman, Sheila Chandra and Sting. Anggun, who studied Balinese dance since childhood, uses the traditional art in her performances.

Anggun&#x27;s image has been compared to that of Pocahontas.

Anggun declined to be labeled an actress and said, &quot;I was born a singer. I won&#x27;t go into another profession, because I think there are still many people out there who were born to be movie stars or models. My calling is music.&quot; As for commercials, she tends to be selective when choosing products to promote.

Anggun&#x27;s success in Europe and America has been credited with helping other Asian singers such as Coco Lee, Hikaru Utada, and Tata Young.

==Exegesis==
This surah mentions what happened at the Battle of the Trench to remind believers of the mercy and power of Allah since Allah made the various tribes who attacked Medina leave.

Regarding the timing and contextual background of the believed revelation (&quot;asbāb al-nuzūl&quot;), Q33 is a later period &quot;Medinan surah&quot;. It contains instructions regarding the treatment of the Prophet and his wives and warns the hypocrites of their bad behavior. According to some scholars, Medinan verses are concerned with the legal matters in Islamic society. These suras generally contain rules and regulations for the believers to follow.

===5-6 Adopted and blood-related persons===
Verses 33:5-6 are concerned with the differences between adopted and blood-related persons. Verse 33:5 refers to adoption in Islam and verse 33:6 contains a reference to the term &quot;Mother of Believers&quot;, who was the Prophet&#x27;s wife. This perhaps suggests their elevated standing with the community and in the later verses, these women are described as &quot;unlike any other.&quot;

===7-8 Sincerity of the prophets===
Verses 33:7-8 show that God will test even the sincerity of the prophets. The beginning of the sura seems to be concerned with truthfulness. The sura reinforces that &quot;God is enough to trust...All this is written in the Scripture...God will question [even] the truthful about their sincerity, and for those who reject the truth He has prepared a painful torment...speak in a direct fashion.&quot; Truthfulness and trust seem to be emphasized for believers and Muhammad since he was dealing with hypocrites and betrayers in Medina, who spread lies, deserted the army during the battle, or supported the attackers.

===9-20 Battle of the Trench – aftermath===
Verses 33:9-27 are concerned with the believers&#x27; and hypocrites&#x27; reactions to the Battle of the Trench. The believers are those who remain steadfast in their belief and courage whereas the hypocrites try to run for safety, abandon the Muslim army, and doubt God and Prophet Muhammad.

===21 Prophet of Allah is an excellent model===

Verily you have in the Prophet of Allah an excellent model, for him who fears Allah and the Last Day and who remembers Allah much
&quot;Surely, in the Messenger of God, there is for you a fairer, good example for those whose hope had been in God and the Last Day and remembered God frequently.&quot;

 shows that it is an important principle to follow the Messenger of God in all his words and deeds.

===26 Siege of Banu Qurayza===
 contains a reference to the siege of the Banu Qurayza and consequent looting of their possessions.

===28–32 Wives of Muhammad ===

 contain a reference to Muhammad&#x27;s wives and tell the believers the proper conduct with Muhammad and his household. The prophet&#x27;s wives are called the Mothers of the Believers and thus have to follow certain rules and regulations as women who are &quot;unlike other women&quot;.

===33 purification===
===35-36 Forgiveness and reward ===
 show the characteristics of people who will be forgiven and rewarded by God. Some scholars take these verses to mean equal worth of women and men and thus reject claims that women are inferior to men.

===37-47 God to be trusted, obeyed, and glorified===
 reaffirm that God needs to be trusted, obeyed, and glorified. contains a reference to Finality of Prophethood.

===49-52 Who the prophet can marry ===
 detail who the prophet can marry or not. Verse 50 was revealed pertaining to Maymunah bint al-Harith.

===53-58 House rules===
 tell the believers how they should interact with Muhammad when visiting him and his household.

===59 Islam and gender segregation===

 uses the phrase &quot;adna al-jilbab&quot; which is sometimes understood as &#x27;wrap around&#x27; and is used to acknowledge women to cover themselves, as an act of modesty.

===60-73 Punishment for hypocrites and idolaters===
 explains the actions that God will take with the disbelievers and believers and will direct Muhammad to take against the hypocrites. The penultimate verse explains that mankind chose to be given free will.The last verse ends with the proclamation that God will punish both hypocrites and idolaters, whether they are men and women, and reward the believers of both genders. Both genders are presented as equal since they are both punished or redeemed without any differences when judged by God.

<doc id="1345270" wikidata="Q229959" url="?curid=1345270" title="Saba (surah)">
<text>Saba’ (, ) is the 34th chapter (sūrah) of the Qur&#x27;an with 54 verses (&quot;āyāt&quot;). It discusses the lives of Solomon and David, a story about the people of Sheba, challenges and warnings against the disbelievers as well as the promises related to the Day of Judgment.

Regarding the timing and contextual background of the asbāb al-nuzūl &quot;circumstances of revelation&quot;, it is an earlier Meccan surah, which means it was revealed in Mecca instead of later in Medina.

==Summary==

The chapter begins with the phrase &quot;Alhamdulillah&quot; (&quot;Praise be to God&quot;), one of five chapters to do so; the others are Al Fātiḥah, Al-An&#x27;am, Al-Kahf and Fatir. The first two verses assert God&#x27;s praiseworthiness and omnipotence. The following verses (3–9) criticized the disbelievers for their rejection of the resurrection, the Day of Judgement and of Muhammad&#x27;s message. The ninth verse also mentions the orderliness of the universe as evidence of God&#x27;s omnipotence. The following verses (10–14) briefly discuss David and Solomon, both of whom are among the prophets in Islam.

Verses 15–19 contain a story about the eponymous people of Sheba. The story is based on the ancient Sabaeans who lived in the central lowlands of Yemen. According to the verses, they were originally prosperous, but turned away from worship and giving thanks to God, and as a result suffered a flood. The story is presented as a warning against worldly pride and arrogance. Semitic philologist A. F. L. Beeston linked the story to the prosperous Sabeans of the Ma&#x27;rib oasis who settled on each side of the wadi (hence the reference to &quot;the garden of the right&quot; and &quot;of the left&quot; in verse 15. Beeston, CNRS researcher Jérémie Schiettecatte, as well as the Quranic commentary &quot;The Study Quran&quot; argued that the flood corresponds to the failure of the dam system that irrigated the community. The dams were mentioned in inscriptions dated from around 450–540 CE, and &quot;The Study Quran&quot; further argues that the phrase &quot;the flood of &#x27;Arim&quot; correspond to the triliteral root ʿ-r-m that appeared in the inscriptions to refer to the dam system.

The rest of the chapter discusses various topics, including the nature of Iblis (the Devil in the Islamic tradition), challenges to those who reject the message of Islam, warnings of the consequences which will come to them in the Day of Judgement, as well as the nature of Muhammad&#x27;s mission.

== Revelation history ==
The chapter was revealed during the Meccan period of Muhammad&#x27;s (May his mention be exalted) prophethood, therefore, a Meccan sura. Some commentators of the Quran, including Ahmad ibn Ajiba, Mahmud al-Alusi, Ibn al-Jawzi, and Al-Qurtubi opined that the sixth verse was an exception and was revealed in the Medinan period.

== Name ==
The name of the chapter refers to Sheba, a kingdom mentioned in the Quran and the Bible. Sheba is the subject of verses 15 to 21 of the chapter, although this passage likely does not refer to the kingdom under the famous Queen of Sheba, but rather about a group of people in the same region in a later period. Orientalist A. F. L. Beeston and Jérémie Schiettecatte identified the people in these verses to be the Sabaeans who lived in the Ma&#x27;rib valley.

<doc id="1345275" wikidata="Q229998" url="?curid=1345275" title="Fatir">
<text>Fatir (, ; Originator), also known as Al-Mala’ikah (, ; &quot;The Angels&quot;), is the 35th chapter (sūrah) of the Qur&#x27;an with 45 verses (āyāt). Parts of Q35:39-45 are preserved in the Ṣan‘ā’1 lower text.

Regarding the timing and contextual background of the believed revelation (&quot;asbāb al-nuzūl&quot;), it is an earlier &quot;Meccan surah&quot;, which means it is believed to have been revealed in Mecca, rather than later in Medina.

== References to Surah Fatir ==
This surah also refers to God&#x27;s abundant forgiveness. For example, we see in Surah Fatir verse 30: 
 
Translation: [They do all this] so that [God] will give them a full reward and increase their bounty; Indeed, He is Most Forgiving and Most Merciful to the little deed. (30)

And also in other verses:


Translation: And they say: All praises belong to God, who took away our sorrow; Undoubtedly, our Lord is very forgiving and bestowing against a small deed. (34)

==Exegesis==
Abu Hamza al-Thumal recorded from a parchment containing a speech on asceticism given by Imam Ali ibn Husayn Zayn al-Abidin in which the following verse from Surah Fatir was referenced: 
:۝ 35:28: &quot;Those truly fear Allah, among His Servants who have knowledge: for Allah is Exalted in Might, Oft-Forgiving.&quot;
Concerning this verse, Zayn al-Abidin comments that the knowledge, by Allah, and the deeds are nothing but two harmonious matters. The one who recognizes Allah fears him, and the fear urges him to the deeds in obedience to Allah; the heads of knowledge follow him, recognize Allah, and strive to do good deeds.

<doc id="1345281" wikidata="Q1987608" url="?curid=1345281" title="Belo Horizonte International Airport">
<text>Belo Horizonte/Confins–Tancredo Neves International Airport, formerly called Confins International Airport, is the primary international airport serving Belo Horizonte, located in the municipality of Confins, in the state of Minas Gerais. Since 2 September 1986, the airport is named after Tancredo de Almeida Neves (1910–1985), President-elect of Brazil.

It is operated by BH Airport S.A.

==History==
The airport was built by Infraero and inaugurated in 1984. Its purpose was to lessen the congestion at Pampulha Airport, which at the time was operating at 120% of its capacity of 1.3 million passengers per year. It was expected that by 1990, passenger movement at Confins would be nearly 2 million passengers per year. However, it surpassed the 1 million passenger mark only 22 years later. Presently its maximum operational capacity is 22 million passengers per year.

After its inauguration, just a small fraction of the capacity of Confins was used. This was partly due to its distance from downtown Belo Horizonte and, until recently, to the lack of satisfactory transportation alternatives for the pricey (about US$40) taxi rides. The over-crowded Pampulha Airport remained the airport of choice. In order to revert this scenario, in March 2005 the government of the state of Minas Gerais with the support of agencies of the Federal government decided to restrict Pampulha to operations of aircraft with capacity of up to 50 passengers. In the months thereafter, most operations were forced to move to Confins and the airport gained a new momentum. At that time, 130 flights were transferred from Pampulha to Confins, increasing annual passenger flow from 350,000 to around 3.0 million that year.

The problems related to the distance of Confins to downtown Belo Horizonte were lessened by recent projects such as the improvement of the highway that links the city center to the airport (MG-10 highway), part of a larger project called Linha Verde (&quot;Green Line&quot;), which seeks to reduce the time needed to reach the airport. Another project called the &quot;Industrial Airport&quot; is underway. In this project the government will exempt tax of businesses interested in settling their operations near the airport.

Its cargo facilities have a capacity of handling 18.000 tones (39.682.000 lb) and the warehouse has 6.400 m2 (68.889 ft²).

The main maintenance facilities of Gol Airlines are located at this airport.

Responding to critiques to the situation of its airports, on May 18, 2011, Infraero released a list evaluating some of its most important airports according to its saturation levels. According to the list, Confins was considered to be requiring attention, operating between 70% and 85% of its capacity.

On 26 April 2011, it was confirmed that in order to speed-up much needed renovation and upgrade works, private companies would be granted a concession to explore some Infraero airports - among them, in a later phase, Confins. The plan was confirmed on 31 May 2011 and it was added that Infraero would retain 49% of the shares of each privatized airport and that negotiations were expected to be concluded in the first half of 2012.

On 22 November 2013, the Brazilian Government had a bidding process to determine the operator of the airport from 2014 until 2044. The group Aerobrasil, also known as BH Airport, formed by the Brazilian investment company CCR (75%) and by the Swiss operator Flughafen Zürich AG (25%) won the bid.

On 16 September 2015, all international operations were transferred to a new provisional terminal - Terminal 3 while domestic operations remained in Terminal 1.

The construction of Terminal 2 - an extension of Terminal 1 - started in September 2015 and finished in December 2016. It increased the airports capacity to 22 million passengers per year. On 8 December 2016 Terminal 2 was opened for domestic operations and in January 2017 international operations were transferred from Terminal 3. With the transfer of operations, Terminal 3 was closed.

==Future developments==
On 31 August 2009, the previous concessionary, Infraero, unveiled a BRL342.3 million (US$180.3 million; EUR126.4 million) investment plan to upgrade Tancredo Neves International Airport, focusing on the preparations for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. The investment was supposed to be distributed as follows:
*Parking. Value 6.8. Completed: July 2010
*Extension of runway, enlargement of apron and cargo terminal, construction of further taxiways. Value 120.0. Completed.
*Renovation of the passenger terminal. Value 215.5.

As of March 2016, only the parking lot and the apron expansion works have been completed. After many successive postponements due to budget cuts and judicial disputes between the airport administration, Infraero, the federal government and the contractors, the lengthening of the runway to was completed in June 2016.

As part of the concession, BH Airport committed itself to construct a new parallel runway with a length of , connecting taxiways and service roads as well as a multi-storey car park until 2020.

==Statistics==
Following is the number of passenger, aircraft and cargo movements at the airport, according to Infraero (2007-July 2014) and BH Airport (August 2014-2023) reports:

==Accidents and incidents==
*15 September 2001: a TAM Airlines Fokker 100 registration PT-MRN operating the charter flight 9755, flying from Recife to Campinas-Viracopos, following an uncontrolled engine failure en route to Campinas had 3 cabin windows shattered by fragments of the engine and made an emergency landing at Belo Horizonte-Confins. One passenger was sucked out partly and held by another passenger until the aircraft landed. The passenger did not survive.

==Access==
The airport is located north of downtown Belo Horizonte. It is regularly served by buses, taxis and Executive Airport Shuttle Buses. When using buses, transfer to the Belo Horizonte metro is possible.

The focuses on establishing the Qur&#x27;an as a divine source, and it warns of the fate of those who mock Allah&#x27;s revelations and are stubborn. The tells of the punishments that plagued past generations of nonbelievers as a warning to present and future generations.

== Heart of the Quran ==

It has been proposed that is the &quot;heart of the Quran&quot;. The meaning of &quot;the heart&quot; has been the basis of much scholarly discussion. The eloquence of this is traditionally regarded as representative of the miraculous nature of the Qur&#x27;an. It presents the essential themes of the Qur&#x27;an, such as the sovereignty of Allah, the unlimited power of Allah as exemplified by his creations, Paradise, the ultimate punishment of nonbelievers, resurrection, the struggle of believers against polytheists and nonbelievers, and the reassurance that the believers are on the right path, among others. presents the message of the Qur&#x27;an in an efficient and powerful manner, with its quick and rhythmic verses. This asserts that Muhammad was not a poet, rather he was the greatest and the Last Messenger of Allah (the &quot;Seal of the Prophets&quot;).

== Virtues ==
It is reported in Sunan al-Darimi that Prophet Muhammad said, &quot;Whoever recites in the early morning, his needs for that day will be fulfilled.&quot; Although it is graded as weak (), a similar suspended () narration from Ibn Abbas states, &quot;Whoever recites in the morning, there will be ease for him until the evening, and whoever recites at night, there will be ease for him until the morning.&quot; It has been graded as either authentic () or good ().

== Sections and themes ==

There are three main themes of : the oneness of God (); , that Muhammad is a messenger sent by God to guide his creations through divine revelation; and the reality of , the Last Judgment. 36:70 &quot;This is a revelation, an illuminating Qur&#x27;an to warn anyone who is truly alive, so that God&#x27;s verdict may be passed against the disbelievers.&quot; The repeatedly warns of the consequences of not believing in the legitimacy or the revelation of Muhammad, and encourages believers to remain steadfast and resist the mockery, oppression, and ridicule they receive from polytheists and nonbelievers. The arguments arise in three forms: a historical parable, a reflection on the order in the universe, and lastly a discussion of resurrection and human accountability.

The chapter begins with an affirmation of the legitimacy of Muhammad. For example, verses 2–6, &quot;By the wise Qur&#x27;an, you [Muhammad] are truly one of the messengers sent of a straight path, with a revelation from the Almighty, the Lord of Mercy, to warn a people whose forefathers were not warned, and so they are unaware.&quot; The first passage, verses 1–12, focuses primarily with promoting the Qur&#x27;an as guidance and establishing that it is God&#x27;s sovereign choice who will believe and who will not. It is stated that regardless of a warning, the nonbelievers cannot be swayed to believe. 36:10 &quot;It is all the same to them whether you warn them or not: they will not believe.&quot;

 then proceeds to tell the tale of the messengers that were sent to warn nonbelievers, but who were rejected. Although the messengers proclaimed to be legitimate, they were accused of being ordinary men by the nonbelievers. 36:15–,17 &quot;They said, &#x27;Truly, we are messengers to you,&#x27; but they answered, &#x27;You are only men like ourselves. The Lord of Mercy has sent nothing; you are just lying.&quot; However, a man from amongst these people beseeched them to believe in the messengers. Upon his death, the man entered Paradise, and lamented the fate of the nonbelievers. 36:26 &quot;He was told, &#x27;Enter the Garden,&#x27; so he said, &#x27;If only my people knew how my Lord has forgiven me and set me among the highly honored.&quot; This is meant to warn the nonbelievers of the consequences of their denial. Verse 36:30 goes on to state: &quot;Alas for human beings! Whenever a messenger comes to them they ridicule him.&quot; Ultimately, it is God&#x27;s will who will be blind and who will see.

The following passage addresses the signs of God&#x27;s supremacy over nature. This is presented by the sign of revived land, the sign of day and night, the sign of the arc and the flood, and the sign of the sudden blast that arrives on the day of judgement. 36:33–37 The sign of revived land follows:
The disbelievers do not recognize God&#x27;s power in the natural world, although he is the one Creator.

The further addresses what will happen to those who reject the right path presented by Muhammad and refuse to believe in God. On the last day, the day of reckoning, the nonbelievers will be held accountable for their actions and will be punished accordingly. God warned the nonbelievers of Satan, and yet Satan led them astray. 36:60–63 &quot;Children of Adam, did I not command you not to serve Satan, for he was your sworn enemy, but to serve Me? This is the straight path. He has led great numbers of you astray. Did you not use your reason? So this is the fire that you were warned against.&quot; Although God warned them against following Satan, the nonbelievers were deaf, and so now they will suffer the consequences of their ill judgements. 36:63 &quot;So this is the Fire that you were warned against. Enter it today, because you went on ignoring [my commands].&quot;

The proceeds to address the clear nature of the revelation and assure that Muhammad is a legitimate prophet. 36:69 states, &quot;We have not taught the Prophet poetry, nor could he ever have been a poet.&quot; concludes by reaffirming God&#x27;s sovereignty and absolute power. 36:82_83 &quot;When He wills something to be, His way is to say, &#x27;Be&#x27;—and it is! So glory be to Him in whose Hand lies control over all things. It is to Him that you will all be brought back.&quot;
 It is to God, the one Creator who holds everything in his hands, that everything returns. The closing passage carries an essential message of the Qur&#x27;an.

<text>&quot;I Want to See the Light/Coboloid Race&quot; is the debut single by Rational Youth, released as a double A-side 12&quot; single in October 1981.

The two main tracks were re-released as bonus tracks on the 1997 CD of &quot;Cold War Night Life&quot;, and as a CD single in 2000, as part of the &quot;Early Singles&quot; box set. All CD releases use Tracy Howe&#x27;s 1997 edit of &quot;I Want to See the Light&quot;, which cuts some repetitive parts. (The instrumental version &quot;Light Instrumental&quot; has never been re-issued.)

&quot;Coboloid Race&quot; was remixed by Bill Vorn in 1998 for the &quot;3 Remixes for the New Cold War&quot; EP.

<text>As-Saffat (, , Those who rank themselves in Order, &quot;Ranged in Row&quot;, &quot;The Rangers&quot;) is the 37th chapter (sūrah) of the Qur&#x27;an with 182 verses (&quot;āyāt&quot;).

Regarding the timing and contextual background of the believed revelation (&quot;asbāb al-nuzūl&quot;), it is an earlier &quot;Meccan surah&quot;, which means it is believed to have been revealed in Mecca, rather than later in Medina.

==Chronology==
According to Egyptian chronology, it was the 56th &quot;sura&quot; to be revealed to Muhammad. Theodor Nöldeke presents a different classification putting it in the 50th position and most precisely revealed in the second &quot;Meccan&quot; period (&quot;see Meccan sura).&quot; That period is marked by increasing opposition of the Quraysh tribe against Muhammad and his followers and is distinguished by its focus on divine intervention and inspiration and also previous religious prophets. Although named Al-Saffat, the general theme of &quot;Sura&quot; 37 is the unity of God and His power to greatly reward and punish. We see in this &quot;Sura&quot; elaborations on the punishment of disbelievers and rewards of believers in the Day of Judgment but also God&#x27;s examples of how a true believer should be through enumerations of biblical figures. One aspect of the &quot;Sura&quot; which can be relevant to the title (Ranged in Row, the rangers) is that it is threatening the people who attribute offspring to God, especially the pagans who believed that the angels were the daughters of God. &quot;“The rangers”&quot; or &quot;“Ranged in Row”&quot; refers to the angel who will be lining up on the Day of Judgment and refuting the idea of them being daughters of God (see Quran 37:1-5).

Parts of Q37:15-33; 43–68; 82–103;&amp; 118-144 are preserved in the Ṣan‘ā’1 lower text.

== Structure and content ==
&quot;Sura&quot; 37 could be divided into three parts following one characteristic of Arabic Poetry widely known as tripartite division. The first part goes from verses 1 to 74, the second part from 75 to 148 and the last part from 149 to 182.

===37:1-74 Eschatological prophecy ===
The first part goes from verse 1 to 74 with eschatological prophecy as central theme but could be divided into two sub-parts: 1-10 and 11–74.

From verse 1 to 10, we have a snapshot of the setting of the Day of Judgment. From this description, you see that there will be angels ranged in row claiming the unity of God (&quot;37:1-6&quot;), a higher assembly quite exclusive (&quot;37:7-8&quot;) and disbelievers who will be driven away for their perpetual torment (&quot;37:9-10&quot;). This same setting is consistent with the one described in &quot;Sura&quot; 78:38 in the early &quot;Meccan&quot; period: &quot;“On the day when the spirit and the angels stand in rows, they will not speak except for those to whom the Lord of Mercy gives permission, and who will say only what is right”&quot;. However comparing this two verses, we see that the last one (&quot;37:1-6&quot;) has more details than the previous one (&quot;78:38&quot;). It almost seems that the latter is a continuation of the former. We can infer, from the combination of the two verses, that the angels ranged in row will vehemently refute what the pagans were putting forward about them (the angels) being the daughters of God (see Arabian mythology) and will claim the unity of God under his permission.

From 11 to 74, the verses reveal the description of the Day of Judgment including a depiction of its dynamic in its smallest details. At the beginning of this sub-part (&quot;11 to 39&quot;), we are exposed to a debate between the Prophet and the angels on one side, and the disbelievers on the other side. Debates are mainly characteristics of middle &quot;Meccan suras&quot;. In this particular section, one could sense a two-way discussion between both parties, putting more stress on the feelings of one party: the disbelievers. This section starts with how the disbelievers use to refute the message of God and continue with how their attitude will change when they will be faced with the truth of the Day of Judgment. The &quot;Sura&quot; portrays their surprise, their regrets for not believing in the word of God and makes it seem that it will be too late for them to be saved because in the Day of Judgment, no soul would be able to help another in any way, nor could their deeds be changed whatsoever. In addition, this section puts the Prophet in an intermediate position where he is made to transmit God&#x27;s answers to them on that specific day: &quot;“Say, yes indeed, and you will be humiliated” (37:18).&quot; 
Finally, throughout verses 11 to 74 we see an interesting juxtaposition structure which is very visible. The attitudes and experiences of people whose actions were good on earth and those whose actions were bad are explored back to back to make the contrast more visible but also to provide a picture of the scenery in the Day of Judgment with the two sides sitting not far away from each other. From verse 11 to 39, we have a description of the experience of the disbelievers on the D-day and follows, from verse 40 to 57, a contrasting experience of the believers where they comment on the fate of the disbelievers and how lucky they were not to be in their place: &quot;“By God, you almost brought me to ruin! Had it not been for the grace of my Lord, I too would have been taken to hell” (37:56).&quot; Finally we see again from verses 58 to 74 another description of the disbelievers’ experience. One specific detail that will be interesting to look at in this last part is the mention of a specific tree in verses 62 to 69: the tree of Zaqqum whose fruits will be forced to people in hell to intensify their torment. In Asbab al-nuzul, this tree is believed to be used to threaten the unbelievers among the Quraysh tribe.

===37:75-148 Earlier messengers of God ===
In the early &quot;Meccan suras&quot;, there was not any mention of the earlier messengers of God as present in the Bible but in the middle &quot;Meccan suras&quot; they are gradually brought in to translate their actions into great rewards in the Afterlife and therefore give good references to the common believers and unbelievers. This section particularly tackles some biblical figures with a snapshot of specific actions they took that translated into great rewards. It starts with Noah with a snapshot of the Noah&#x27;s Ark story in the Bible, putting a stress on how God helped him to save his people because he was a true believer. We also have a mention of the story of Jonah, &quot;Yunus&quot;, describing his fall in the ocean and how God saved him by making him be swallowed by a big fish. We therefore see a slightly different approach of the Quran from the Bible based on where the emphasis is put on in counting that story. We also see snapshots of stories about Abraham, Moses, Aaron, Elijah and Lot included in this section to serve the same purpose: stressing out God&#x27;s rewards to his true servants (37:121) instead of limiting oneself in counting these stories as they occurred, as the Bible does.

===149-182 Day of Judgment===

In this last section, we are taken back into the Day of Judgment where the Quran is addressing the disbelievers one more time but differently. Here it is no longer a debate but one way speech. We see a succession of rhetorical question about certain claims the disbelievers are making that God, through Muhammad, is asking. He then develops into saying that those claims are all false and the disbelievers will know when the Day of Judgment comes. This section closes with a few praises to God making a ring structure which is very noticeable. Indeed, as mentioned in the beginning, the angels were ranged in row praising God and we see here from 164 to 166 the same scenario and then from 180 to 182 we read again praises to God. The &quot;Sura&quot; therefore goes from one point and comes back to the same point at the end, making a ring.

<text>Charles Robert Scriver (November 7, 1930 – April 7, 2023) was a Canadian pediatrician and biochemical geneticist. His work focused on inborn errors of metabolism and led in establishing a Canada-wide newborn metabolic screening program.

== Early life and education ==
Born in Montreal, Quebec, Scriver graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1951 and from the Faculty of Medicine of McGill University in 1955. 

== Scientific career ==
Scriver was appointed to the Department of Paediatrics at McGill and as a Markle scholar in 1961, becoming a professor in pediatrics in 1969. He was the Samuel Rudin Distinguished Visiting Professorship at Columbia University from 1979 to 1980 and was the Alva professor Emeritus of Human Genetics in the Faculty of Medicine of McGill University. 

In 1969 he discovered that rickets could be caused by vitamin D deficiency among poorer children who drank bottled milk instead of infant formula. He persuaded Quebec suppliers to add vitamin D to their milk, leading to a decrease in the rate of rickets. 

Scriver played a critical role in developing scientific and ethical policies associated with the international Human Genome Project - created to decode more than three billion DNA base pairs and identify all human genes.

Scriver was co-editor of the authoritative multi-volume textbook entitled &quot;The Metabolic &amp; Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease&quot;, published by McGraw-Hill.

== Death ==
Scriver died in Montreal on April 7, 2023, at the age of 92.

==Honours==
* He was awarded the McLaughlin medal from the Royal Society of Canada in 1981.

* In 1995, he was awarded the Government of Quebec&#x27;s Prix Wilder-Penfield.
* In 1996 he was promoted to Companion of the Order of Canada
* He was the 1996 recipient of the Canadian Medical Association Medal of Service, awarded to a physician who has made &quot;an exceptional and outstanding contribution to the advancement of health care in Canada.&quot;
* In 1997 he was made a Grand Officer of the National Order of Quebec.

<text>Ṣad (, ; &quot;The Letter Sad&quot;) is the 38th chapter (sūrah) of the Qur&#x27;an with 88 verses (āyāt) and 1 sajdah ۩ (38:24). Sad (ص ) is the name of the eighteenth letter in the Arabic alphabet.

According to the traditional Islamic narrative, &quot;Saad&quot; was sent to Muhammad by Allah while he was coping with rejection from his tribe, the Quraysh. It recounts stories of previous prophets, describes the splendors of heaven, and warns of the monstrosities of hell.

Regarding the timing and contextual background of the believed revelation (&quot;asbāb al-nuzūl&quot;), it is an earlier &quot;Meccan surah&quot;, which means it is believed to have been revealed in Mecca, rather than later in Medina. The &quot;sura&quot; dates to the 2nd Meccan Period, meaning it was revealed only five or six years into the development of Islam.

== Historical context ==
&quot;Sura&quot; 38 substantiates Muhammad&#x27;s role as Prophet through concrete examples of previous messengers of God and the evils that have befallen the people who did not heed sacred messages. Angelika Neuwirth, a German Quranic scholar, terms these “retribution legends” (McAuliffe, 105). They “prove that divine justice is at work in history, the unjustly harassed being rewarded with salvation, the transgressors and unbelievers punished by annihilation” (McAuliffe, 106). Through regular reference to biblical characters and a self-assertive tone praising both Muhammad and God, the reader can attribute this &quot;sura&quot; to the 2nd Meccan Period, according to Noldeke&#x27;s chronology . The coherent text builds up to descriptions of both heaven and hell on the Day of Judgment. The wide scope of historical figures—ranging from Old Testament characters such as David, Solomon, and Job, to the devil of Islam, Iblis—were designed to resonate with a wide audience in the face of the disbelief among the Quaryash, Muhammad&#x27;s clan; as Ernst poignantly states, Muhammad was likely dealing with “religiously well-informed skeptics”. Like many contemporary passages, &quot;Sura&quot; 38 attempts to convert the reader to a monotheistic religion honoring Muhammad as Prophet by promising salvation for true believers on the Day of Judgment.

== General divisions of &quot;sura&quot; 38 ==

Most Middle and Late Meccan &quot;suras&quot; can be divided into three sections by content and style- a tripartite division. Examination of the structure of a &quot;sura&quot; can make what seems like an elliptical compilation of sentences far more comprehensible. Symmetrical structure, also known as ring composition, can help both the novice and experienced reader find the central message. &quot;Sura&quot; 38 can first be divided into three primary sections: the first from verses 1–11; the second, 12–64; the third, 66–88. The first and third sections, similar in length, remind the reader of the power of God and the Qur&#x27;an by describing destruction and hell, the third section going so far as to describe the creation of evil: the fall of Iblis, who becomes Satan.

The larger center section (12-64) gives examples of biblical figures like David, Solomon, and Job to Muhammad as Messengers who also faced adversity. In the middle portion of the &quot;sura&quot;, God concisely tells Muhammad to “Remember Our servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, all men of strength and vision. We caused them to be devoted to Us…with Us they will be among the elect, the truly good…This is a lesson” (Q38:45-49). The historical context of the &quot;sura&quot; confirms that this is indeed its central message: supposedly, Muhammad was struggling with rejection from his tribe, the Quraysh, so God sent this revelation to support and encourage him. As entrance to heaven is the final goal of Islam, nothing could serve as better inspiration to Muhammad to persevere in the face of adversity. Nevertheless, one must keep in mind that as Islam gained followers and adapted to continue its growth, the clear divisions within &quot;suras&quot; blur and texts slowly become lengthier and more expansive works; the reader cannot always find three, let alone two, clear-cut sections. Even within &quot;Sura&quot; 38, the subject and tone can shift every few verses from general descriptions of heaven and hell to short examples of specific prophets.

=== 1-11 comments made by nonbelievers ===

&quot;The surah opens with comments made by nonbelievers confused by the Prophet’s portents.&quot;

Verse 8: the nonbelievers do not try to understand warnings: they blatantly “doubt” (Q38:8). God warns that they “have not tasted My torment yet” (Q38.8). He tells Muhammad to “bear their words patiently” (Q38.17), given the historical context of disbelief among the Quaryash. verse 17 recounts stories of specific messengers to the Prophet.

=== 12-64 Transition to the Day of Judgment and hell===

&quot;Transition from general warnings to exemplar People of the Book and, later, a description of the Day of Judgment and hell.&quot;

====17 Patience ====
Patience (Verse 17): Muhammad is told to &#x27;bear their words patiently&#x27; (Q38.17) by God, “they” referring to the Quraysh, given the historical context of their disbelief. This marks the transition from generalizations about the disbelieving peoples of the past to stories of specific messengers.This is very true.

==== 17-26 Story of David and the Two Litigants ====
The tone and style of &quot;Sura&quot; 38 become more specific, both in examples of previous prophets and their stories. For example: verses 17-26 chronicle David as he errs during a test God gives him, but quickly “fell down on his knees, and repented” (Q38.24). Unlike those of the early Meccan Period, &quot;suras&quot; of the 2nd Meccan Period often reference biblical characters as Muhammad tried to convert the Judeo-Christian population to Islam by finding common ground between their faiths. Though there is no evidence to prove this, it is believed that Muhummad was illiterate. Muhummad&#x27;s inability to read supports the authenticity of his revelations from God as uninfluenced by any knowledge he could have gained from texts of the time. Muhummad&#x27;s biblical references could have been common knowledge, but their broad range and sufficient clarity point to an omnipotent source greater than Muhummad alone, a role that God fits.

The crowds to whom Muhammad spoke likely already knew the story of David. According to the Bible, the story of David and the Two Litigants was a test of God. The Qur&#x27;anic version of the story differs slightly from the biblical version, but the ultimate message is the same. In the Muslim tradition, though David already has many wives, he asks a man to divorce his only wife because David wants her for himself. Disapproving David&#x27;s selfishness, God sends two brothers, one with ninety-nine ewes, the other with only one, to David. He is asked to decide whether it is fair for the brother with ninety-nine ewes to take the only ewe of his brother, a clear parallel to David taking another man&#x27;s only wife. As David tells the men that it is wrong for the one with many ewes to take the only ewe of his brother, he realizes the error of his ways, referencing his relations with Bathsheba, the former wife of Uriah the Hittite, and begs God for forgiveness as referenced in 2 Samuel 12.

==== 30-40: Story of Solomon ====
The Qur&#x27;an also references Solomon, son of David, as a devoted Messenger who realizes the error of his ways and is forgiven by God. With further research, one uncovers the story referred to in &quot;Sura&quot; 38: Solomon is more devoted to his horses than to God, and misses prayer sessions while indulging in the hoofed creatures’ company. He justifies his obsession, saying, “My love of fine things is part of my remembering my Lord!” God knows this is not true, is displeased with the king and “[reduces] him to a mere skeleton on his throne” as punishment. Eventually Solomon realizes that God has been testing him. According to Muslim legend, Solomon slaughters all his horses to prove his devotion to God, and God forgives him, granting him great power over the earth.

Like the Qur&#x27;an does of David, Solomon&#x27;s positive attributes are emphasized, even though he too “yielded to certain temptations on the road to faith” (Tottoli, 35). However, Solomon was granted even greater powers by God than his father was. A particularly miraculous one was his over the wind, so that he could travel over his immense territory quickly. Solomon could speak to animals and was commander over a rank of jinn, or invisible spirits. The Torah even claims that God made Solomon so wise that kings from all over the land traveled to hear him speak. (2 Chronicles 9:14).

==== 55-64: The Day of Judgment ====
One does not have to be a prophet to have a fruitful afterlife. Through verse 49, the Qur&#x27;an repeats that the reward for devout followers “will be nearness to Us, and a good place to return to” (Q38.49). The reader is called by descriptions of heaven through verse 54, in which rich words like “bliss” and “abundant” are used. Such enticing information becomes particularly important when contrasted with a long description of Hell, lasting from verses 55–64, which includes a bone-chilling description of what hell tastes like: “a scalding, dark, foul fluid” (Q38.58). The Qur&#x27;an describes this Day of Judgment with increasingly vivid descriptions as Islam develops. This one is particularly scaring, arresting multiple senses and capturing the reader in a dark, seemingly inescapable cloud of perpetual agony.

==== Other Biblical characters ====
This Sura also references Noah, Job, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Ishmael, and Elijah. Of these only the story of Job is elaborated on, providing a third major example of overcoming “adversity” (Q 38:44) to become a noteworthy messenger of the past.

==== 63 Day of Reckoning====
In verse 63, God repeats to Muhammad that he must warn the masses against this Day of Reckoning, that God will forgive those who seek forgiveness but only if they heed the Prophet&#x27;s warnings.

===66-88 The holiness and validity of the Qur’an===
The Sura ends with three short verses maintaining the holiness and validity of the Qur’an, just as it begins with a verse saying “By the Qur’an with its reminding” (Q38.1).

==== 71-85: Story of Iblis and Hell ====

Humility is key to acceptance in heaven. God recounts the story of Iblis’ rejection from heaven and God’s generous compromise with him, giving him “respite till the Appointed Day”, when God will then “fill Hell with you and all those that follow you” (Q38.80-85).

However, there is a more interesting explanation for the creation of Satan. He exists to tempt us, and prove our true devotion to God. God warns humans that Satan will tempt them, lead them astray; and this test for the believer must be passed with the most strict devotion to God.

== Forgiveness ==
God is &quot;Oft-Forgiving&quot;; He is also Just, punishing those who have done wrong. In &quot;Sura&quot; 38, God speaks of entire civilizations wiped out because they did not believe (e.g. Q:38 10–17). However, the &quot;Sura&quot; suggests that God will forgive a believer if his faith is strong and true and he repents for his misdeeds. We, too, can be saved by God and given a place in heaven on the Day of Judgment.

However, &quot;Sura&quot; 38 is unique in the number of concrete examples it gives of biblical figures who have served God. Though Muhammad faces adversity among his own people, the tone of this &quot;Sura&quot; is more confident in the essential truth behind Islam than earlier &quot;Suras&quot;. This faith is exemplified by the emphasis on forgiveness for all, although the reader can have no doubt about God&#x27;s wrath on the disbeliever and His Absolute Power over all.

== Exegesis==
Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq, in a written letter to his companions, advises them to observe Taqiya when dealing with &quot;liars and hypocrites&quot; because the status of the &quot;people of falsehood&quot; is different to Allah than the status of the &quot;people of truth&quot;, hence he cites the following verse from Surah Sad in support of this:

<text>Theodore William King (born October 1, 1965) is an American actor, previously credited as T. W. King, best known for starring as Andy Trudeau on the hit-series &quot;Charmed&quot; during its first season.

==Career==
He was first known for playing Danny Roberts on the soap opera &quot;Loving&quot; and &quot;The City&quot;.

The next year he appeared as the major male leading co-star in the primetime series &quot;Charmed&quot; as detective Andy Trudeau and the burgeoning, soon-to-be-eight-year franchise around it as the series began its first season run chronicling the adventurous lives of the three Halliwell sister-witches, the &quot;Charmed Ones&quot;. King&#x27;s character Andy, with a background as their childhood friend, is an inspector who helps the sisters cover up complications of supernatural villains and magic&#x27;s side effects as their new-found witch powers grow and attract evil hoping to absorb their magical abilities. He was the first season&#x27;s major male love interest of the leading actress, Shannen Doherty (playing Prue Halliwell), from the October 1998 pilot to the May 1999 finale, where his character nobly sacrificed himself in the season finale to save his love and her sisters from an otherwise insoluble magical dilemma.

In 2002, King returned to soaps as Luis Alcazar on &quot;General Hospital&quot; until his character was killed off. However, he later returned to &quot;General Hospital&quot; as Luis&#x27; identical younger brother, Lorenzo Alcazar.

He has had guest-starring roles on such series as &quot;Frasier&quot;, &quot;Sex and the City&quot; and &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;, among many others.

His feature film credits include &quot;The X-Files&quot; movie and a role in the independent feature film “Hoodlum &amp; Son.”

King was born in Hollywood, California, and raised in both Los Angeles and Bethesda, Maryland. He received his college degree from The University of California, Santa Barbara, and went on to study film direction at the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University. He has worked in film editing and been involved in New York Theater over the past several years. King is credited with co-founding the Portal Theater Company, an off-Broadway repertory company, where he directed “Beggars in the House of Plenty,” written by John Patrick Shanley.

Off-screen King is active in various charitable organizations, including The Make-A-Wish Foundation.

In December 2008, King was cast as the mysterious character Downey on the hit series &quot;Prison Break&quot;, making his first appearance on December 22. The role lasted until the end of the season (May 2009).

In February 2011, King began the role of Tomás, long lost brother of Téa Delgado and romantic interest of Blair Cramer, on &quot;One Life to Live&quot; remaining until the soap&#x27;s cancellation in January 2012.

In April 2015, King played the role of Corporal Daniel Collins on the &quot;NCIS&quot; season 12 episode &quot;Lost in Translation&quot;.

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; exclusively reported on June 21, 2021, that King had been cast on his fifth soap opera &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; as Jack Finnegan in what will be the part of the development of his son&#x27;s John Finnegan&#x27;s (Tanner Novlan) &quot;very dramatic backstory&quot;. King&#x27;s first episodic appearance was on July 30 of that year. He won his first Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Performer in a Drama Series for his role as Jack in 2022.

==Personal life==
In September 2008 King married his girlfriend Maya Rodwell, with whom he became engaged the year before. The couple welcomed their second child, daughter Ava Celeste, on October 15, 2010.

<text>Az-Zumar (, ; &quot;The Troops, The Throngs&quot;) is the 39th chapter (&quot;surah&quot;) of the Qur&#x27;an, the central religious text of Islam. It contains 75 verses (ayat). This surah derives its name from the Arabic word &quot;zumar&quot; (troops) that occurs in verses 71 and 73. Regarding the timing and contextual background of the believed revelation (&quot;asbāb al-nuzūl&quot;), it is believed to have been revealed in the mid-Meccan period when persecutions of the Muslim believers by the polytheists had escalated.

The surah expounds the signs of God&#x27;s Oneness (tawhid) in the natural world and emphasizes the absurdity of associating partners with God. It also hints at emigration for the believers who were suffering great difficulties in worshiping God in their homeland. It also declares that there can be no reconciliation between believing in God&#x27;s Oneness and association partners with God. The chapter also reminds readers of the other world, where Muslims believe people will see the outcome of their own deeds.

== Exegesis (&quot;tafsir&quot;) ==
=== 9:5 He wraps the night over the day ===
According to Turkish writer Ali Ünal: the word &quot;wraps&quot; in this verse is a simile, which alludes both to the earth&#x27;s being rounded and to differences in the times of sunrise and sunset.

<doc id="1345308" wikidata="Q1426659" url="?curid=1345308" title="Online text-based role-playing game">
<text>An online text-based role playing game is a role-playing game played online using a solely text-based interface. Online text-based role playing games date to 1978, with the creation of &quot;MUD1&quot;, which began the MUD heritage that culminates in today&#x27;s MMORPGs. Some online-text based role playing games are video games, but some are organized and played entirely by humans through text-based communication. Over the years, games have used TELNET, internet forums, IRC, email and social networking websites as their media.

There are varied genres of online text-based roleplaying, including fantasy, drama, horror, anime, science fiction, and media-based fan role-play. Role-playing games based on popular media (for example, the Harry Potter series) are common, and the players involved tend to overlap with the relevant fandoms.

== Varieties ==
===MUDs===

Precursor to the now more popular MMORPGs of today are the branch of text-based games known as MUD, MOO, MUCK, MUSH et al., a broad family of server software tracing their origins back to MUD1 and being used to implement a variety of games and other services. Many of these platforms implement Turing-complete programming languages and can be used for any purpose, but various types of server have historical and traditional associations with particular uses: &quot;mainstream&quot; MUD servers like LPMud and DikuMUD are typically used to implement combat-focused games, while the TinyMUD family of servers, sometimes referred to by the term MU*, are more usually used to create &quot;social MUDs&quot; devoted to role-playing and socializing, or non-game services such as educational MUDs. While these are often seen as definitive boundaries, exceptions abound; many MUSHes have a software-supported combat system, while a &quot;Role-Playing Intensive MUD&quot; movement occurred primarily in the DikuMUD world, and both the first Internet talker (a type of &quot;purely&quot; social server) and the very popular talker software ew-too were based on LPMud code. Although interest in these games has suffered from the popularity of MMORPGs, a large number of them still operate.

===Play-by-post and PBEM===

Play-by-post role-playing games or PBP RPGs refer to another type of text-based gaming. Rather than following gameplay in real-time, such as in MUDs, players post messages on such media as bulletin boards, online forums, Chatrooms (such as like AOL, hangouts and Yahoo chat) and mailing lists to which their fellow players will post role-played responses without a real limit or timeframe. Of late such blogging tools and sites as LiveJournal have been utilized for this purpose. This includes such games as play-by-email (or PBEM) RPGs. The origins of this style of role-playing are unknown, but it most likely originated in some form during the mid-to-late 1980s when BBS systems began gaining in popularity.
Usually it is played through &#x27;Script&#x27; and &#x27;Story&#x27; format, both styles are interchangeable and work well but it depends on which the player prefers, or which the human administrator insists upon. Script format is a simple stating of what each character is saying, post by post, with little to no mention of said characters&#x27; actions, whereas Story format requires that the character&#x27;s actions be mentioned, including the surroundings and a general description of what is going on.

===Real-time human-moderated===

Some games rely entirely upon human moderators to dictate events, and physical print books for rules sets. Such games may use code dice-rollers, to generate random results, and may include databases for the purposes of maintaining character records. Interaction between characters is controlled by communication between individual players (with each other) and with moderators (who portray non-player characters). Communication software and database options vary, from the DigiChat front-end / character database back-end pairing pioneered by Conrad Hubbard at White Wolf Publishing, to the numerous AOL, hangouts and Yahoo chats with hosted character databases. Many games also choose to play on Internet Relay Chat on networks such as DarkMyst and SorceryNet. More robust options are available on many virtual tabletops. Some virtual tabletops include text chat in addition to map and image sharing, campaign management and more. Free-form games may even do away with database integration or dice-rollers entirely and rely upon individual players to keep their own records, with online community reputation dictating how other players react.
==Psychology of roleplaying==
Although an undeveloped field, there exists some research done on people who roleplay online. One interesting facet of roleplaying online is the instance of a roleplayer acting as a character of a different gender. One study was conducted in the Journal of Computer Game Culture, which discussed this phenomenon of cross-gendered play. In the study, it was found that roleplayers would create opposite gendered characters to revel in their own embodiment as alternative beings. This was a form of conscious adoption of the &#x27;bodies&#x27; that the player could not physically &#x27;own.&#x27; Although this creates a tension between the avatar of the character and the user, it is a tension that seems to not stand in the way of anything as players often show unselfconsciousness.

Additionally, research on online personalities has been done that could potentially extrapolate to the phenomena of online roleplaying. Researcher J. Suler found that, despite the various layers hiding the person behind the character, there is still a presence of the true personality of the roleplayer. Suler, in their study, highlighted several reasons for this extended emotional expression:

*Dissociative Anonymity in that the roleplayer tends to not see the similarity between their online self and their offline self, although they are but two sides of the same coin.
*Invisibility in that there is no worry about appearances when interacting online. This can lead to increased emotional expression as well.
*Asynchronicity in that users can respond when they have time to, and there is no pressure to respond emotionally. This allows a better procession of emotions and thus heightened expression of the player&#x27;s emotions.

<text>Dean Ivor Richards (9 June 1974 – 26 February 2011) was an English professional footballer who played as a defender. He began his career at hometown club Bradford City before a four-year stay with Wolverhampton Wanderers. He left to play Premier League football with Southampton and finally Tottenham Hotspur. He also made four appearances for England under-21s.

Richards retired from playing in 2005 due to health concerns, but later returned to the game as a coach at Bradford. He died six years later at the age of 36.

==Personal life==
Richards was born in Bradford on 9 June 1974. He attended Allerton Middle School and Rhodesway School in Bradford.

==Playing career==

===Bradford City===
As a central-defender, Richards started his career at his hometown club Bradford City as a youth trainee. He signed as a full-time professional in 1992 and made his debut aged 17 in October of the same year in a 3–1 victory over AFC Bournemouth in a game in which he scored. He played 86 league games for the Bantams, scoring four goals, and playing 102 games in all competitions.

===Wolverhampton Wanderers===
Richards moved on loan to promotion-chasing Wolverhampton Wanderers in March 1995, making his debut on 1 April in a 1–0 win at Southend. A permanent deal was quickly arranged for a fee which was initially £1.3 million but eventually rose to £1.8m once various clauses took effect.

Richards made four England under-21 appearances at the Toulon Tournament in 1995, making his debut as captain against Brazil. England reached the semi-final of the competition but lost to hosts France.

During the 1995–96 season he was elevated to the role of club captain but, in January 1996, he was in a car crash that initially seemed to only leave him with a bruised ankle but later revealed an injured knee and back issues. He subsequently missed much of the following two seasons due to persistent injuries. On the field, his performances earned the attention of the likes of Arsenal and Manchester United.

He remained with the club until his contract expired at the end of the 1998–99 season; ironically his final game saw his former club Bradford win promotion to the Premier League at Molineux while Wolves missed out on a play-off place.

===Southampton===
In July 1999, Richards reached the Premier League when he was signed for Southampton by Dave Jones on a free transfer. He settled quickly into the Southampton side despite replacing the popular Ken Monkou. He was voted the fans&#x27; Player of the Year at the end of his first season.

In the three seasons Richards was at the Saints, he made 79 appearances in all competitions and found the net seven times, before joining Tottenham Hotspur in September 2001.

===Tottenham Hotspur===
Richards impressed new manager Glenn Hoddle so much that, when Hoddle moved to Tottenham Hotspur in March 2001, he tried to take Richards with him. This led to a drawn-out battle of words between chairman Rupert Lowe and the Tottenham board, which ended when Spurs paid £8.1 million to persuade Lowe to release Richards from his contract which he had only signed a few months earlier. He scored on his debut in a 5–3 home defeat to Manchester United.

Richards never realised his full potential at Tottenham due to persistent injury problems, and never fulfilled his ambition to play for his country. At the time, his transfer fee to Tottenham was the highest amount ever paid by a club for a player who had not played internationally.

In March 2005, he announced his retirement from the game due to illness after receiving &quot;evidence that it would be harmful to his health to continue&quot;. A specialist told him that if he continued playing he could suffer from a brain haemorrhage. Richards said: &quot;I am obviously deeply disappointed to be giving up the sport I love, but it&#x27;s the only choice.&quot; He was suffering from frequent dizzy spells and headaches that were initially thought to be an inner-ear infection.

==Coach==

Having gained his coaching qualifications, Richards returned to Bradford City on 3 August 2007, when it was confirmed that he was taking a part-time role as youth coach. He also worked with a company in Spain.

== Death ==
Richards died at the age of 36 on the morning of 26 February 2011 at St. Gemma&#x27;s Hospice, Leeds after a long-term illness.

On 6 March 2011, two of his former clubs, Wolves and Tottenham, met in the Premier League. This fixture was designated as a tribute game, and as such featured several official and media tributes to Richards&#x27; career and life. Joining the teams in the centre circle at Molineux Stadium for a minute&#x27;s applause before kick-off were his widow Samantha and his two sons Rio and Jaden as well as representatives from his four former clubs (Ledley King for Tottenham, Claus Lundekvam for Southampton, Matt Murray for Wolves, and Mark Lawn for Bradford City), two of his former managers Graham Taylor and Dave Jones, and two former teammates, Don Goodman and James Beattie.

<text>The Baltic Exhibition () was held in Malmö, Sweden from 15 May to 4 October 1914. (The official closing date, September 30, was later extended by four days, as permitted in the general rules.)

==A Swedish world&#x27;s fair==
The event showcased the industry, art and culture of Sweden, Denmark, Germany and Russia — the four countries then bordering the Baltic Sea. The city itself has no beaches on the Baltic, but there is one nearby at Øresund.
The Baltic Games were held at the same time, and to this day, they were one of the largest sporting events ever held in Malmö. After the Olympics in Stockholm in 1912, interest in sports had rapidly increased in Sweden, and this was one of the reasons why the Baltic Games became so large. The games were divided into three competition periods: gymnastics (June 7-10), &quot;traditional&quot; competitive sports (June 28-July 12), and sailing (August 6-9). The swimming competitions, lasting for twelve days, attracted many internationally known athletes. 

For the occasion, many of Malmö&#x27;s parks were renovated and a large new park, Pildammsparken, was created. The Swedish architect Ferdinand Boberg designed several of the exhibition buildings, most of which were removed soon after the event closed. Remaining in Pildammsparken today is the Royal Pavilion, now called the Margareta Pavilion. The Åhléns Pavilion, relocated to the town of Insjön in Dalarna, was one of the few structures to survive. The songs &quot;Malmövalsen&quot; and &quot;Baltirullan&quot;, written to celebrate the fair, have lived on through recordings in both Sweden and the United States. The latter song can be found at video-sharing websites and digital download services in a recording from 2008.

World War I interrupted the exhibition when Germany and Russia entered the conflict on opposing sides. After the war, Russia no longer existed, and some of the Russian art displayed in Malmö remained and eventually became part of the city&#x27;s own collections.

<text>Edward Reynolds Pease (23 December 1857 – 5 January 1955) was an English writer and a founding member of the Fabian Society.

==Early life==
Pease was born near Bristol, the son of devout Quakers, Thomas Pease (1816–1884) and Susanna Ann Fry (1829–1917; sister of Edward Fry, the judge); he was the sixth of Thomas&#x27;s 15 children but Susanna&#x27;s first, Thomas having had five children by previous marriages. One of his sisters was the schoolteacher Marian Pease. His father had been a wool comber and his mother came from the Fry family known for manufacturing chocolate. Edward Pease was educated at home until he was 16, and soon after moved to London where he was taken under the wing of his brother in law Sir Thomas Hanbury. He was initially employed as a clerk in a business where Hanbury was a partner. In time Hanbury arranged for him to become a partner in a stock broking firm.

==Career==
In the early 1880s Pease became friends with Frank Podmore and husband and wife Edith Nesbit and Hubert Bland. On 4 January 1884, Podmore&#x27;s group founded the Fabian Society.

In 1886, the death of a wealthy relative meant Pease received a sizeable legacy allowing him to give up work at the London Stock Exchange and devote time to his socialist interests. In 1886, he moved to Newcastle-upon-Tyne, began working as a cabinet-maker and formed the National Labour Federation, a general union with a national scope. However, his attempts to convert the working class to socialism were unsuccessful so he returned to London. He travelled to United States with Sidney Webb in 1888, and on his return married Marjory Davidson, a young Scottish schoolteacher.

In 1890 Pease was appointed secretary of the Fabian Society. As well as managing the society&#x27;s administration, he edited &quot;Fabian News&quot; and wrote ten pamphlets, including tracts on liquor licensing (1899) and &quot;The History of the Fabian Society&quot; (1916).

With Sidney and Beatrice Webb, Pease was a trustee in the fund used to found the London School of Economics (LSE) in 1895.

Pease was also a member of the Independent Labour Party and in February 1900 he represented the Fabian Society at the meeting where it was decided to establish &quot;a distinct Labour group in Parliament&quot;, forming the Labour Representation Committee (LRC - the forerunner to the Labour Party) to which Pease was elected, serving on the Party&#x27;s executive committee for 14 years.

==Family==
Pease married Mary (Marjory) Gammell Davidson (1861–1950). They had two children: Michael S. Pease, the geneticist, and Nicholas Arthington Pease.

With his wife Marjory, Pease established the East Surrey Labour Party and both served on the local council. Their home at Limpsfield, The Pendicle, Pastens Road, became known as &#x27;Dostoevsky Corner&#x27;, because he housed so many Russian refugees who had been forced to leave their country because of their socialist beliefs.

<text>Subcircus were a Britpop band from London. They had two singles make an entry in the UK Singles Chart in 1997.

==Career==
Peter Bradley formed Subcircus in late 1994. The rest of the band was made up of Nikolaj Bloch (guitar), whom Bradley found through an advert in &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, the latter&#x27;s drumming friend and Danish compatriot Tommas Arnby, and George Brown (bass).

Their first concert was in York, England in 1995. By May 1996, Subcircus had played more than 150 shows throughout the UK, headlining two nightclub tours and opening for Echo &amp; the Bunnymen, Suede, Elvis Costello, Grant Lee Buffalo, Stereophonics and Ocean Colour Scene.

Their debut album, &quot;Carousel&quot;, was recorded in London at AIR Studios, and at Peter Gabriel&#x27;s Real World Studios in Bath, Somerset. It was issued in the UK by the independent Echo label in 1996, and drew critical raves from the UK press. Through 1997 the band released the singles &quot;86&#x27;d&quot; and &quot;U Love U&quot;. Later in the year, &quot;86&#x27;d&quot; was re-released along with the album which featured a new track sequence. &quot;I heard them on the Evening Session and I thought they sounded fantastic,&quot; remarked Radiohead&#x27;s Ed O&#x27;Brien. &quot;I&#x27;ve listened to the album a couple of times and I still can&#x27;t hear that they sound like us, not at all.&quot;

Subcircus was quiet for over two years but reappeared in 1999 with the single &quot;Do You Feel Loved&quot;. This was followed by support slots for label mates Feeder in October. In 2000, on Valentine&#x27;s Day, the band issued a new single, &quot;Sixty Second Love Affair&quot;. In March, their second full-length album, &quot;Are You Receiving?&quot; was released to lukewarm reviews.

<doc id="1345338" wikidata="Q978287" url="?curid=1345338" title="Frank Podmore">
<text>Frank Podmore (5 February 1856 – 14 August 1910) was an English author and founding member of the Fabian Society as well as an influential member of the Society for Psychical Research. He is known for his interest in spiritualism, which he eventually developed a sceptical attitude towards, specifically the claims of mediumship which he attacked in his history of mediumship, &quot;The New Spiritualism&quot; (1910). However, he defended other spiritualist beliefs such as telepathy and ghosts.

==Life==

Born at Elstree, Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, Podmore was the son of Thompson Podmore, an Anglican priest and the headmaster of Eastbourne College. He was educated at Haileybury and Pembroke College, Oxford (where he first became interested in Spiritualism and joined the Society for Psychical Research – this interest remained with him throughout his life). After graduating he went to work for the Post Office, where he worked for most of the rest of his life.

In October 1883, Podmore and Edward R. Pease joined a socialist debating group established by Edith Nesbit and Hubert Bland. Podmore suggested that the group should be named after the Roman General, Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus, who advocated weakening the opposition by harassing operations rather than becoming involved in pitched battles. In January 1884 the group became known as the Fabian Society, and Podmore&#x27;s home at 14 Dean&#x27;s Yard, Westminster, became the organisation&#x27;s first official headquarters.

He was a member of the Oxford Phasmatological Society which dissolved in 1885. In 1886 Podmore and Sidney Webb conducted a study into unemployment, eventually published as a Fabian Society pamphlet, &quot;The Government Organisation of Unemployed Labour&quot;. Podmore married Eleanore Bramwell in 1891, however, the marriage was a failure and they separated. They had no children.

His major work was a detailed study of the life and ideas of Robert Owen (1906). Podmore resigned from a senior post in the Post Office in 1907. Psychical researcher Alan Gauld wrote that he &quot;was compelled to resign without pension from the Post Office because of alleged homosexual involvements. He separated from his wife, and went to live with his brother Claude, rector of Broughton, near Kettering.&quot;

Podmore died by drowning at Malvern, Worcestershire, in August 1910.

Researcher Ronald Pearsall wrote that it was generally believed that Podmore was a homosexual and that it was &quot;very strange&quot; that his brother Claude, his wife or any member of the Society for Psychical Research did not attend his funeral.

==Psychical research==
Podmore at first was impressed by the claims of spiritualism after attending a seance of Henry Slade, and addressed the National Association of Spiritualists in 1880. He gave a report on a poltergeist case Worksop which he believed to be genuine, but reassessed the case in 1896 finding it fraudulent. This change may have resulted from an unsympathetic review of his work by H. G. Wells, which Historian Brian Inglis suggests embarrassed Podmore and made him more sceptical, wanting to be viewed as &quot;a detached, scientific, no-nonsense commentator on psychic affairs&quot;.

Podmore&#x27;s books, giving non-paranormal explanations from much of the psychical research that he studied, received positive reviews in science journals. His book &quot;Studies in Psychical Research&quot; received a positive review in the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; which described his debunking of fraudulent mediums as scientific and came to the conclusion the &quot;book is well worth reading, and it is agreeable reading, for the style is generally vigorous and not infrequently brilliant.&quot;

Podmore who considered most mediums fraudulent, was open minded about the telepathic hypothesis for Leonora Piper&#x27;s séances. However, Ivor Lloyd Tuckett had &quot;completely undermined&quot; this hypothesis for Mrs. Piper. Podmore was critical of Helena Blavatsky and her claims of Theosophy. He evaluated poltergeist cases and concluded they are best explained by deception and trickery.

Rationalist author Joseph McCabe stated that despite Podmore&#x27;s &quot;highly critical faculty&quot; he was misled in the Piper case by Richard Hodgson. This was based on a letter he saw in the 2nd edition &quot;Spiritualism and Oliver Lodge&quot; by Dr. Charles Arthur Mercier, from a cousin of George Pellew to Edward Clodd, alleging that Hodgson claimed that Professor Fiske from his séance with Piper was &quot;absolutely convinced&quot; Piper&#x27;s control was the real George Pellew, but that when Pellew&#x27;s brother contacted Fiske about it, he replied it was &quot;a lie&quot; as Piper had been &quot;silent or entirely wrong&quot; on all his questions. However, Alan Gauld, referring to this letter as published by Clodd, stated that it was &quot;wholly unreliable&quot;, noted that Hodgson in his original report wrote that Fiske had a negative attitude, and that Hodgson himself considered the Fiske sittings to be of no evidential value.

Podmore&#x27;s text &quot;Mesmerism and Christian Science: A Short History of Mental Healing&quot; received a positive review in the &quot;British Journal of Psychiatry&quot;, which referred to it as &quot;an excellent account of this interesting and important subject.&quot; His 1910 history of mediumship, &quot;The New Spiritualism&quot;, was deeply sceptical, in which every medium tested was dismissed as a charlatan.

Podmore defended the validity of telepathy and ghosts, the latter of which he believed to be &quot;telepathic hallucinations.&quot;

<text>William Francis Raborn, Jr., (June 8, 1905 – March 6, 1990) was the United States Director of Central Intelligence from April 28, 1965 until June 30, 1966. He was also a career United States Navy officer who led the project to develop the Polaris missile system and retired from the navy in 1963 as a vice admiral.

==Early life and naval career==
Born in Decatur, Texas, he graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1928. During World War II he directed the Gunnery Training Section at the Bureau of Aeronautics. He also served in the Pacific on aircraft carriers: Raborn was the executive officer of the carrier when her deck was damaged by a kamikaze attack. He had the deck repaired in four hours, allowing the ship&#x27;s aircraft (which had been airborne when the kamikaze struck) to land safely – for this Raborn was awarded the Silver Star. He later commanded the carriers and .

Raborn was a rear admiral when he was appointed, on November 8, 1955, as director of special projects at the Bureau of Weapons. His task was to develop a submarine-launched ballistic missile. He reported directly to Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Arleigh Burke and the Secretary of the Navy Charles Thomas. Raborn was told the new system had to achieve interim capability by early 1963 and full capability by early 1965. The , the first ballistic missile submarine, was commissioned December 30, 1959, fired its first test missile July 20, 1960, and departed on the navy&#x27;s first deterrent patrol on November 15, 1960. Raborn received the Distinguished Service Medal and was appointed Vice Admiral in 1960. The same year he was awarded the Collier Trophy for his work on Polaris.

Raborn had delivered Polaris three years ahead of schedule, due in part to his application of the PERT methodology. He became Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Development in 1962. Raborn retired from the navy in 1965 and on April 28 of that year, despite his having no intelligence experience, President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Raborn as the seventh director of Central Intelligence (DCI). As DCI, one of his primary responsibilities was to direct the Central Intelligence Agency.

&quot;Time&quot; magazine wrote that his organizational skills would be invaluable in a CIA that admitted it was in danger of being &quot;drowned in data&quot;, but his tenure was not successful: author David Barrett described Raborn as &quot;incompetent at CIA, not understanding the agency or the intelligence business&quot;, and even the CIA&#x27;s own historians said &quot;Raborn did not &#x27;take&#x27; to the DCI job&quot;. A later CIA director, William Colby, described Raborn as focused on intelligence technology and not sufficiently attuned to the cultural issues involved in dealing with foreign nationals and governments.

Raborn resigned on June 30, 1966, having served for only fourteen months as DCI. He was replaced by his deputy, Richard Helms.

He was involved, during his time at the CIA, in its early activities against &quot;Ramparts&quot; magazine and its editors.

Raborn is buried in the United States Naval Academy Cemetery in Annapolis, Maryland.

==Awards==


Raborn was also:
*Vice admiral (United States Navy)
*Director, U.S. Navy Special Projects Office
*Deputy Chief of Naval Operations 
*32° Mason (Ancient &amp; Accepted Scottish Rite Of Freemasonry)

==Other honors and recognition==
In 1962, Raborn received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.
