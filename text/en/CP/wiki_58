<doc id="1338891" wikidata="Q536204" url="?curid=1338891" title="Zilla (Godzilla)">
<text>is a fictional monster, or &quot;kaiju&quot;, in Toho Co., Ltd.&#x27;s &quot;Godzilla&quot; media franchise. The character first appeared in &quot;Godzilla&quot; (1998), released by TriStar Pictures. It was initially created as a reimagining of Godzilla but was later re-branded as a separate character appearing alongside Toho&#x27;s Godzilla. Patrick Tatopoulos designed it after iguanas with a slim theropod appearance rather than the thick, bipedal designs of Toho&#x27;s Godzilla. TriStar&#x27;s Godzilla, both the film and character, were negatively received by fans and critics. In 2004, it was featured in Toho&#x27;s &quot;&quot; as &quot;Zilla&quot;. Afterwards, Toho trademarked new incarnations as Zilla, with only the iterations from the 1998 film and animated series retaining the &quot;Godzilla&quot; copyright and trademark.

==Overview==
===Name===
Initially, during production of &quot;&quot;, director Ryuhei Kitamura asked producer Shōgo Tomiyama whether or not they were allowed to include TriStar&#x27;s Godzilla in the film; whereupon Tomiyama checked Toho&#x27;s contract with Sony and saw they were allowed to use it, Tomiyama stated: &quot;Kitamura asked me if it was possible for us to use the American Godzilla in Final Wars, so I checked our contract with Sony Pictures and found out we could use it. Since this was the 50th anniversary film, I thought ‘Why not include the American Godzilla?&#x27;&quot; This incarnation of TriStar&#x27;s Godzilla was named &quot;Zilla&quot;. This decision was made because they also felt that Emmerich&#x27;s film had taken the &quot;God&quot; out of &quot;Godzilla&quot; by portraying the character as a mere animal. The name &quot;Zilla&quot; was chosen for the character by Tomiyama as a satirical take on counterfeit Godzilla products that use &quot;Zilla&quot; as a suffix.

Toho had filed the &quot;Zilla&quot; name on July 21, 2006, and it was registered on April 20, 2007. This name change has been reflected in subsequent official products featuring the character since 2004, though &quot;Godzilla&quot; continues to be used on products that predate the name change, such as home media re-releases of the 1998 film and &quot;&quot;. Matt Frank (co-writer and illustrator of &quot;Godzilla: Rulers of Earth&quot;) further clarified the name change, stating, &quot;Toho makes zero distinction between &quot;Zilla&quot; and &quot;Godzilla 1998&quot; with the exception of title alone. Ever since 2004, Toho&#x27;s official stance has been that any future incarnations of the character be referred to hereafter as &#x27;Zilla&#x27;.&quot; Keith Aiken (co-editor of SciFi Japan) also clarified that &quot;Zilla is a variation of the 1998 Godzilla&quot; but stressed that only the incarnations from the 1998 film and the animated series retain the Godzilla copyright and trademark.

Toho had renewed the trademark on April 4, 2017, and is set to expire on April 20, 2027. In 2023, Spiral Studios licensed the character from Toho as &quot;Zilla&quot; for a 124 cm statue.

===Development===

During the production of the 1998 film, special effects artist Patrick Tatopoulos was contacted by director Roland Emmerich and asked to create a new design for the Godzilla character. According to Tatopoulos, the only specific instructions Emmerich gave him was that it should be able to run incredibly fast. Emmerich intended to depict the character as an animal rather than a monster. Godzilla was originally conceived by special effects director Eiji Tsubaraya, special effects designers Akira Wantanabe and Teizo Toshimitsu and producer Tomoyuki Tanaka as a robust, erect-standing, plantigrade reptilian sea monster, played by an actor in a rubber-latex full-body suit. Based on the instructions Emmerich gave him, Tatopoulos reimagined it as a lean, digitigrade bipedal iguana that stood with its back and tail parallel to the ground, rendered via computer animation. The monster&#x27;s distinctive facial features include a prominent lantern jaw, inspired by the fictional tiger Shere Khan from Disney&#x27;s animated adaptation of &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;.

TriStar&#x27;s Godzilla color scheme was designed to reflect and blend in with the urban environment. At one point, it was planned to use motion capture to create the movements of the computer-generated monster, but it ended up looking too much like a man in a suit. The Baby Godzilla scenes utilized a combination of CGI and purpose built costumes donned by actors. Kurt Carley portrayed the suitmation sequences for the adult Godzilla in the 1998 film while voice actor Frank Welker, foley artist Gary A. Hecker, and the film&#x27;s sound designer Scott Martin Gershin provided additional vocals for both Godzilla and its offspring. Upon pending approval for the design, at the time, Shōgo Tomiyama commented on the new look, saying &quot;It was so different we realized we couldn&#x27;t make small adjustments. That left the major question of whether to approve it or not.&quot; Though TriStar&#x27;s Godzilla was referred to by the film&#x27;s characters as a &quot;he&quot;, Patrick Tatopoulos stated on a DVD audio commentary that the effects crew sculpted female genitalia into the CG model of the creature.
In the 1998 film and animated series, TriStar&#x27;s Godzilla is portrayed as a territorial, piscivorous, tall mutated lizard. Atypical of Toho&#x27;s giant monster characters, TriStar&#x27;s Godzilla is not immune to conventional weaponry, and instead relies on its cunning and athleticism to outflank its enemies. It can travel long distances over land and sea, burrow underground and reproduce via parthenogenesis, and is able to lay over 200 eggs, unlike its offspring in the animated series which was unable to reproduce. It possesses an ignitable radioactive breath weapon called &quot;Power Breath&quot;, although its offspring could breathe a green atomic Power Breath in the animated series (where also the parent, resurrected as a cyborg called Cyber-Godzilla, possessed a blue version), in which it was pitted against a rogues gallery of original monsters, after the producers were unable to secure the rights to adapt Toho&#x27;s classic monsters. It was also featured in advertisements alongside the Taco Bell chihuahua.

TriStar&#x27;s Godzilla was featured in the 2004 Toho film &quot;&quot; as &quot;Zilla&quot;; this name would continue to be used and trademarked for later incarnations. A 3D scan of the Trendmasters &quot;Ultimate Godzilla&quot; toy was used as reference for Zilla. In the film, Zilla engages Toho&#x27;s Godzilla in a battle intended &quot;to show which Godzilla is stronger&quot;. Zilla would fight Godzilla again in a slightly longer battle, and even team up with Godzilla to fight other monsters, in the comic series by IDW Publishing titled &quot;Godzilla: Rulers of Earth&quot; running between 2013 and 2015.

===Reception===
The design and characterization of TriStar&#x27;s Godzilla was negatively received. Film critic Richard Pusateri of &quot;G-Fan Magazine&quot; coined the acronym GINO (&quot;Godzilla In Name Only&quot;) to distinguish it from Toho&#x27;s Godzilla. while other publications referred to it as the &quot;American Godzilla&quot;.

Tom Breihan from &quot;Deadspin&quot; stated that TriStar&#x27;s Godzilla &quot;wasn&#x27;t motherfucking Godzilla at all,&quot; elaborating that the character was treated like a &quot;tapped animal&quot;, lacked Godzilla&#x27;s signature blue atomic breath, ran and hid, caused less damage, and that Emmerich and Devlin had &quot;completely missed the entire point&quot; of Godzilla.

These sentiments were echoed by veteran &quot;Godzilla&quot; suit actors Haruo Nakajima and Kenpachiro Satsuma, and by Shusuke Kaneko, director of the &#x27;90s &quot;Gamera&quot; films. Nakajima ridiculed the character design, stating: &quot;Its face looks like an iguana and its body and limbs look like a frog&quot;. Satsuma walked out of the film, saying &quot;it&#x27;s not Godzilla, it doesn&#x27;t have his spirit&quot;. Kaneko opined &quot;[Americans] seem unable to accept a creature that cannot be put down by their arms&quot;, and later alluded to the character in his film &quot;Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack&quot; as a monster that Americans mistook for Godzilla. Thomas Tull (producer of Legendary&#x27;s &quot;Godzilla&quot; series) criticized the design of TriStar&#x27;s Godzilla, stating, &quot;I’m always puzzled as a fan when you take things so far it’s unrecognizable.&quot; Toho publicist Yosuke Ogura later called TriStar&#x27;s design a &quot;disaster.&quot;

The animated version of the character was more positively received than its live-action predecessor, due to being closer in line with the spirit of Toho&#x27;s Godzilla, possessing the ability to breathe atomic fire, battle monsters, and withstand attacks. However, the negative response to both Emmerich&#x27;s &quot;Godzilla&quot; as well as the Disney remake of &quot;Mighty Joe Young&quot; released that same year, had caused giant monster movies to fall out of vogue for several years after, with films such as Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;King Kong&quot; remake being postponed until 2005. Poor merchandise sales for the film led to a cancellation of a toy line based on &quot;Godzilla: The Series&quot;, and resulted in significant financial losses for toy manufacturer Trendmasters. Nicholas Raymond from &quot;Screen Rant&quot; described Toho&#x27;s subsequent treatment of TriStar&#x27;s Godzilla as &quot;a clear sign that Toho doesn&#x27;t regard the 1998 Godzilla as the King of the Monsters. It would appear that to them, he&#x27;s just a giant lizard.&quot;

==Appearances==
TriStar&#x27;s Godzilla has only made two film appearances in &quot;Godzilla&quot; (1998) and &quot;&quot; (2004) and was vaguely referenced in &quot;Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack&quot; (2001). TriStar originally planned to produce a trilogy, and Tab Murphy was commissioned by Emmerich and Devlin to write a story treatment for &quot;Godzilla 2&quot;. However, the sequels were cancelled due to the 1998 film&#x27;s poor reception and TriStar let their remake/sequel rights expire on May 20, 2003.

An animated television series, &quot;&quot;, was produced instead and served as a sequel to the 1998 film. It featured the surviving offspring from the 1998 film as the new Godzilla, as well as a reanimated cyborg version of its parent, named &quot;Cyber-Godzilla&quot;. For the video games &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;, developer Simon Strange decided not to include Zilla due to the character&#x27;s unpopularity among fans. Strange received criticism from fans for not including Zilla in &quot;Godzilla: Unleashed&quot;. In 2024, the children&#x27;s web series &quot;Godziban&quot; introduced a bright pink female Zilla character named &quot;Zillala&quot; as a co-host for its &quot;Go! Godzi Godzi BANBAN&quot; segment.

<doc id="1338894" wikidata="Q5621226" url="?curid=1338894" title="Gustav Stickley">
<text>Gustav Stickley (March 9, 1858 – April 15, 1942) was an American furniture manufacturer, design leader, publisher, and a leading voice in the American Arts and Crafts movement. Stickley&#x27;s design philosophy was a major influence on American Craftsman architecture.

==Early life==
One of eleven children of German émigrés Leopold and Barbara Schlager Stoeckel, Gustav Stickley was born Gustavus Stoeckel on March 9, 1858, in Osceola, Wisconsin. The eldest surviving son, Stickley experienced the rigors of life growing up on a small Midwestern farm, forgoing his formal education in 1870 to continue work in his father&#x27;s field of stonemasonry and help support his struggling family. By early 1876, Stickley&#x27;s mother and siblings moved to Brandt, Pennsylvania, where Gustav worked in his uncle&#x27;s chair factory – his first formal training in the furniture industry.

==Early career==
With his brothers Charles and Albert, Gustav formed Stickley Brothers &amp; Company in 1883, the same year he married Eda Ann Simmons. Within five years, the company was dissolved and Stickley&#x27;s ambitions led him to partner with Elgin Simonds, a salesman in the furniture trade, to form the firm Stickley &amp; Simonds in Binghamton, New York. During the 1890s, Stickley divided his efforts between his new enterprise and the Auburn State Prison. At the prison, he and his brother Leopold served as a foremen of furniture operations. In 1898, he orchestrated the removal of his business partner and formed the Gustave Stickley Company (he dropped the use of the &quot;e&quot; from his first name in 1903).

In the summer of 1900, he worked with Henry Wilkinson and, possibly, LaMont A. Warner (soon his first staff designer) to create his first Arts and Crafts works in an experimental line called the New Furniture. In 1901, he changed the name of his firm to the United Crafts, issued a new catalogue written by Syracuse University professor Irene Sargent, and began to offer middle class consumers a host of progressive furniture designs in ammonia fumed quartersawn white oak, as well as chestnut, mahogany, maple and other woods.

==The Craftsman==
In October 1901, Stickley published the first issue of &quot;The Craftsman&quot; magazine, an important vehicle for promoting Arts and Crafts philosophy as well as the products of his factory within the context of articles, reviews, and advertisements for a range of products of interest to the homemaker. Lead articles in the first two issues paid tribute to two influencers of Stickley and Sargent&#x27;s design philosophies: William Morris and John Ruskin.

Nearly all of the first three issues of &quot;The Craftsman&quot; were written by Sargent, who thereafter wrote each issue&#x27;s lead article, acted as the managing editor and designed the magazine&#x27;s layouts. The magazine also featured articles by libertarian socialists.

==Furniture design==

Stickley&#x27;s new furniture reflected his ideals of simplicity, honesty in construction, and truth to materials. Unadorned, plain surfaces were enlivened by the careful application of colorants so as not to obscure the grain of the wood. Mortise and tenon joinery was exposed to emphasize the structural qualities of the works. Hammered metal hardware, in armor-bright polished iron or patinated copper emphasized the handmade qualities of furniture which was fabricated using both hand working techniques and modern woodworking machinery within Stickley&#x27;s Eastwood, New York, factory (now a part of Syracuse, New York). Dyed leather, canvas, terry cloth and other upholstery materials complemented the designs.

Those ideals – simplicity, honesty, truth – were reflected in his trademark, which includes the Flemish phrase &quot;Als Ik Kan&quot; inside a joiner&#x27;s compass. The phrase is generally translated &#x27;to the best of my ability.&#x27;

His firm&#x27;s work, both nostalgic in its evocation of handicraft and the pre-industrial era and proto-modern in its functional simplicity, was popularly referred to as being in the Mission style, though Stickley despised the term as misleading. In 1903, he changed the name of his company again, to the Craftsman Workshops, and began a concerted effort to market his works – by then including furniture as well as textiles, lighting, and metalwork – as Craftsman products. Ultimately, over 100 retailers across the United States represented the Craftsman Workshops.

In 1902, the later world-renowned sculptor Jerome Connor was hired to head up Stickley&#x27;s metal work department. Architect E. G. W. Dietrich contributed his design and accompanying essay titled &quot;The Cottage Quality&quot; to the February and April 1903 editions of &quot;The Craftsman&quot; magazine. Then in May 1903, the magazine published the first &quot;Craftsman House&quot; designed by Dietrich in cooperation with Stickley. The article featured a house design and drawings by Dietrich including an exterior view, floor plans, and detailed interior views showcasing Stickley furniture.

In May 1903, Stickley hired Rochester architect Harvey Ellis. Although Ellis died only a few months later, in January 1904, he had an immediate and profound effect upon design of &quot;The Craftsman&quot; magazine, its architectural offerings, and the furnishings Stickley was producing, reinforcing the connections between Stickley&#x27;s work and that of English and Glaswegian designers. During this year, Stickley&#x27;s furniture evolved from solid, monumental forms to lighter shapes, relieved by arches, tapering legs, and – in a new experimental line – inlay as decoration. Within a year the inlay designs would be all but dropped from production save special orders, but the broader emphasis on less massive forms would remain. In keeping with this new emphasis, Stickley also began offering furniture in willow to complement the heavier oak designs.

Furthering the development of his concept of the Craftsman home, in late 1903 he announced the formation of the Craftsman Home Builders Club to provide architectural plans from &quot;The Craftsman&quot; to its subscribers. The homes were offered in a number of archetypes familiar to American public – the farmhouse, town house, cottage, and bungalow, among others. Natural materials and soft colors predominated and interiors were invariably prescribed to include simplified moldings, stained wood, and characteristic features such as built-in cabinets and fireplaces with inglenooks for seating. Although these homes were only rarely innovative in terms of progressive style, designs reflected current approaches to open floor plans, economy of function, and use of novel materials for walls, roofs, and surface treatments.

==Craftsman Farms==
Stickley moved his headquarters to New York City in 1905. By 1907, he began to acquire property to establish a boarding school for boys in Morris Plains, New Jersey (what is now Parsippany, New Jersey). Craftsman Farms was designed to include vegetable gardens, orchards, dairy cows and chickens. The main house there is constructed from chestnut logs and stone found on the property. As he wrote in &quot;The Craftsman&quot;:
There are elements of intrinsic beauty in the simplification of a house built on the log cabin idea. First, there is the bare beauty of the logs themselves with their long lines and firm curves. Then there is the open charm felt of the structural features which are not hidden under plaster and ornament, but are clearly revealed, a charm felt in Japanese architecture. ... The quiet rhythmic monotone of the wall of logs fills one with the rustic peace of a secluded nook in the woods.
Although the main house at Craftsman Farms was initially conceived of as a clubhouse for students, lack of interest in the school prompted Stickley to live there with his family instead. The planned school never became a reality. By 1913, changing tastes and the financial strain of his new twelve-story Craftsman Building in Manhattan, conceived as a department store, began to take their toll; in 1915 he filed for bankruptcy, stopping publication of &quot;The Craftsman&quot; in December 1916 and selling Craftsman Farms in 1917.

==Legacy==
Gustav Stickley died on April 21, 1942. He is buried in the Oakwood Cemetery in Syracuse, New York.

In recent decades, Stickley and his work have become popularly recognized once again. It is particularly his early furniture, produced between 1900 and 1904, that is often seen as appealing to collectors. In 1988, Barbra Streisand paid $363,000 for a Stickley sideboard from the Gustav Stickley House in Syracuse. An article written by the Associated Press stated that &quot;Streisand&#x27;s telephone bid on the 1903 sideboard set a record for a Stickley piece and for a single piece of American Arts and Crafts movement furniture.&quot; During an auction in 1999, Streisand sold that same sideboard for $540,000 to a then-unnamed buyer; the sideboard subsequently appeared within the collection of the Two Red Roses Foundation. An article written by CBS News stated that &quot;the winning bid set a [auction] record for a piece of furniture from the Arts and Crafts movement.&quot; Magazines such as &quot;Style 1900&quot; (out of print as of January 2013) and &quot;American Bungalow&quot; cater to those interested in the Arts and Crafts movement. A major touring exhibition organized by the Dallas Museum of Art, &quot;Gustav Stickley and the American Arts &amp; Crafts Movement&quot;, opened at the Newark Museum on September 15, 2010. The exhibition then opened at the Dallas Museum of Art on February 18, 2011, and remained on view until May 8, 2011, before opening at the San Diego Museum of Art on June 18, 2011, subsequently closing on September 11, 2011.

 Gustav&#x27;s brothers Leopold Stickley (Lee), Albert Stickley, Charles Stickley and John George Stickley also produced Arts and Crafts furniture. Albert Stickley and John George Stickley founded the &quot;Stickley Brothers Furniture Company of Grand Rapids&quot; in 1891. The Grand Rapids company ceased production in the 1950s. Although no longer held by the Stickley family, the successor firm to the L. &amp; J. G. Stickley Company continues to operate in Manlius, New York, producing a variety of styles, including many original Gustav Stickley Arts and Crafts designs. The Company operates a museum, located in the original L &amp; J. G. factory building. It features the work of the Stickley brothers and is located near its current factory site.

<doc id="1338900" wikidata="Q2344424" url="?curid=1338900" title="The Bachelor Girl">
<text>The Bachelor Girl () is a novel by Victor Margueritte first published in 1922. An English translation was first published in 1923 by Alfred A. Knopf. It deals with the life of a young woman who, upon learning that her fiancé is cheating on her, decides to live life freely and on her own terms. Amongst other things, this included having multiple sexual partners, both male and female. The title translates as The Tomboy. The title addresses the somewhat ambiguous realm between definite gender roles, e.g. where a Judeo-Christian patriarchal society might place a free-thinking, free-living woman in its social strata.

Although the theme is not particularly shocking in the present day, at the time it was considered quite scandalous; it even caused the author to lose his Legion of Honour. It has been adapted into a film four times, the most notably in 1936.

<doc id="1338908" wikidata="Q272037" url="?curid=1338908" title="1951 Atlantic hurricane season">
<text>The 1951 Atlantic hurricane season was the first hurricane season in which tropical cyclones were officially named by the United States Weather Bureau. The season officially started on June 15, when the United States Weather Bureau began its daily monitoring for tropical cyclone activity; the season officially ended on November 15. It was the first year since 1937 in which no hurricanes made landfall on the United States; as Hurricane How was the only tropical storm to hit the nation, the season had the least tropical cyclone damage in the United States since the 1939 season. As in the 1950 season, names from the Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet were used to name storms this season.

The first hurricane of the season, Able, formed prior to the official start of the season; before reanalysis in 2015, it was once listed as the earliest major hurricane on record in the Atlantic basin. It formed on May 16 and executed a counterclockwise loop over the Bahamas; later it brushed the North Carolina coastline. Hurricane Charlie was a powerful Category 4 hurricane that struck Jamaica as a major hurricane, killing hundreds and becoming the worst disaster in over 50 years. The hurricane later struck Mexico twice as a major hurricane, producing deadly flooding outside of Tampico, Tamaulipas. The strongest hurricane, Easy, spent its duration over the open Atlantic Ocean, briefly threatening Bermuda, and was formerly listed as one of a relatively few Category 5 hurricanes on record over the Atlantic Ocean. It briefly neared Category 5 status and interacted with Hurricane Fox, marking the first known instance of a hurricane affecting another&#x27;s path.

== Timeline ==


== Systems ==
=== Tropical Storm One ===
As the calendar entered the new year, cyclogenesis occurred with an extratropical frontal wave over the western North Atlantic Ocean due to a closed low forming in a mid-level trough, which eventually produced a low-pressure center at the surface by January 2. Ships recorded moderate gales up to in connection with the new surface low, which formed several hundred miles east-southeast of Bermuda. While initially lacking tropical attributes, the cyclone headed southeast for two days before curving southwestward. As it did so, the temperature of the system warmed in its lower levels, causing the cyclone to evolve into a more barotropic system. Late on January 4, the system shrank in size and began developing an inner core; reanalysis determined that the system became a tropical storm at this time, though it would have likely been considered subtropical beginning in the early 1970s.
=== Hurricane Able ===
The origins of the first hurricane of the season were from a trough that exited the East Coast of the United States on May 12. A low-pressure area developed on May 14, and two days later it developed into a tropical cyclone about south of Bermuda. It formed beneath an upper-level low, and initially was not fully tropical. The depression followed the low, initially toward the northwest and later the southwest. Moving over the Gulf Stream, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Able on May 16. The storm turned to the south, and Hurricane Hunters reported that Able strengthened to hurricane status on May 17 off the coast of Florida.

The outer rainbands of Able produced light rainfall and high seas along the Florida coastline. It later moved through the northern Bahamas early on May 18, where it produced hurricane-force winds of . The hurricane later turned to the north, gradually strengthening through May 21. Shortly thereafter, Able passed about east of Cape Hatteras before turning east and reaching its peak of early on May 22. Along the coast, the hurricane produced high tides but little damage. Able maintained hurricane intensity for two more days before weakening to a tropical storm early on May 24. Able rapidly dissipated that same day, though originally it was assessed as having evolved into an extratropical cyclone on May 23.

Until 2015, Able was listed as having peak winds of and was analyzed to have been the earliest major hurricane on record. Such a storm would be a Category 3 or greater on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, a system developed and introduced in the 1970s. Able was also the strongest hurricane outside of the current hurricane season (June 1 through November 30). However, reanalysis by scientists in 2015 determined that Able was in fact far weaker than originally listed in HURDAT, the official database containing information on storm tracks and intensities in the Atlantic and Eastern North Pacific regions. It also lost its distinction as the strongest preseason cyclone on record, the record being held by a Category 2 hurricane in March 1908. The hurricane was one of four North Atlantic hurricanes on record to exist during the month of May, the others occurring in 1889, 1908, and 1970.
=== Tropical Storm Baker ===

On August 2, an easterly wave spawned a tropical depression about northeast of Barbuda in the Lesser Antilles. It moved northwestward, quickly strengthening into Tropical Storm Baker. Early on August 3, the storm attained peak winds of , and the next day passed about east of Bermuda. At its peak intensity, the gale-force winds extended to the north of the center. After attaining its peak, Baker quickly weakened on August 4 and turned to the northeast. Early the next day, it regained some of its former strength before losing its identity. Baker never affected land.
=== Hurricane Charlie ===
The third tropical cyclone of the season developed on August 12 from a tropical wave, east-southeast of Barbados. After a few days without further development, the system intensified into Tropical Storm Charlie on August 14, and subsequently crossed through the Lesser Antilles a day later with winds of . Shortly after entering the Caribbean Sea, the storm intensified to hurricane status early on August 16. Passing south of Puerto Rico and Hispaniola, Charlie then underwent rapid deepening beginning late that day, its winds increasing in 24 hours. As it neared the island of Jamaica early on August 18, Charlie became a major hurricane and shortly afterward struck just south of Kingston with winds of —equivalent to a strong Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale, making Charlie, along with Hurricane Gilbert in 1988, the strongest ever to hit the island. On the island, the hurricane dropped heavy rainfall up to . The combination of strong winds and the rains left around $50 million (1951 USD, $380 million 2005 USD) in crop and property damage. Across the country there were 152 deaths, 2,000 injuries, and 25,000 people left homeless; as a result, it was considered the worst disaster in the country in the 20th century until Hurricane Gilbert produced even costlier damage, though with fewer reported fatalities.

After making landfall, Charlie weakened in its passage over the mountainous center of Jamaica, and by the time it left the island, its winds had diminished to . Charlie later passed south of the Cayman Islands, with Grand Cayman reporting peak wind gusts of . As it did so, the storm began to undergo yet another period of rapid intensification beginning on August 19. It regained major hurricane status late that day, and early on August 20 Charlie peaked at , equivalent to low-end Category 4 status. Maintaining its strength, the hurricane then made landfall on the southern tip of Cozumel and hit the Mexican mainland near Akumal on the Yucatán Peninsula. The strong winds destroyed 70% of the crops along its path, although no deaths were reported in the Yucatán Peninsula. Several homes were wrecked in the region. As it moved inland, Charlie weakened rapidly over land, reaching the Bay of Campeche as a minimal hurricane early on August 21. Once over water, it failed to re-intensify for a full day, but began doing so early on August 22. As it did so, it rapidly re-intensified for a third and final time, reaching peak winds of before striking near the city of Miramar, just north of Tampico. It dissipated on August 23. The hurricane dropped heavy rainfall in the region, flooding rivers and causing dams to burst. The hurricane killed 257 people in Mexico. Across Charlie&#x27;s entire path, damage was estimated at over $75 million (1951 USD). The outer fringes of the storm increased surf along the Texas coast.
=== Hurricane Dog ===

A tropical wave spawned a tropical depression on August 27 southwest of Cape Verde. It moved westward, eventually intensifying into a tropical storm early on August 31. The next day, the storm was first observed by Hurricane Hunters, several hundred miles east of Barbados, and it was named &quot;Dog&quot;. By that time, its winds were around , and the storm continued intensifying as it approached the Lesser Antilles. On September 2, Dog attained hurricane status, reaching its peak of as it passed between the islands of Saint Lucia and Martinique. The storm, then quite small in diameter, produced strong wind gusts of up to at the airport in Fort-de-France on Martinique. However, this peak was short-lived, for upon entering the eastern Caribbean Sea Dog began a slow but steady weakening trend. On September 4, Dog weakened to tropical storm status to the south of Hispaniola, and the next day dissipated in the western Caribbean.

In northern Saint Lucia, the combination of flooding and high winds destroyed 70% of the banana crop. Two sailing vessels were destroyed, and another one damaged. Across the island, Hurricane Dog killed two people from drownings. Damage was heavier on Martinique, located on the north side of the storm. The hurricane&#x27;s winds destroyed 1,000 homes and the roofs of several others. Downed trees blocked roads and disrupted power lines. The winds also destroyed 90% of the banana crop and 30% of the sugar cane. Throughout Martinique, Dog left $3 million in damage (1951 USD, $  USD) and killed five people from drownings. It was considered the &quot;most violent storm&quot; in Martinique in 20 years. Initially the hurricane was expected to strike Jamaica, prompting hurricane warnings for the country, as well as along the southern coast of Hispaniola. Jamaica was struck by Hurricane Charlie a few weeks prior, and the threat from Dog prompted coastal evacuations and the closure of an airport. Ultimately, Dog dissipated and produced only light rainfall on the island.
=== Hurricane Easy ===

Hurricane Easy, the strongest tropical cyclone of the season, was a powerful and long-lived Cape Verde-type hurricane that originated as a tropical depression on September 1 between the Lesser Antilles and Cape Verde. Moving generally west-northwestward, the depression deepened into a tropical storm late that day, and further to hurricane status by September 3. On September 5, the cyclone reached its first peak of , but failed to continue strengthening. Its winds fluctuated through the early morning on September 6, but then resumed strengthening, reaching major hurricane status by that evening. During this period, Hurricane Hunters flew into the hurricane to monitor its progress, recording a minimum pressure of on September 6 to the north of the Lesser Antilles. The next day, an aircraft was unable to penetrate the center, estimating winds of south of the eye. On this basis, Easy was once classified as a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale; A reanalysis in 2015 lowered the peak winds to on September 8. This was based on the Hurricane Hunters reporting a pressure of on the previous day, and a ship reporting winds of . By the time Easy attained peak intensity, it had turned to the north and northeast while beginning a steady weakening trend. It interacted with the small Hurricane Fox to the east; this was the first observed instance of a hurricane affecting another&#x27;s path. Easy then turned to the northeast, passing a short distance southeast of Bermuda on September 9 with winds of . Easy evolved into an extratropical cyclone late on September 11, while still maintaining hurricane-force winds. The remnants lost their hurricane-force winds on September 12, only to briefly regain them two days later. On September 14, Easy lost its identity over the northern Atlantic Ocean after it was absorbed by another extratropical storm to the north.

The Weather Bureau advised Bermuda to take precautionary measures in advance of the storm; tourists and residents &quot;worked feverishly&quot; to complete preparations, and the United States Air Force issued &quot;a formal warning at noon.&quot; Numerous hotels and homes were shuttered. Heavy traffic snarled evacuations, and 100 tourists were stranded on the island without &quot;roundtrip reservations.&quot; Air Force aircraft returned to the United States, and personnel secured various facilities at the island&#x27;s base. On Bermuda, the hurricane produced winds of only , which downed a few banana trees. In addition to affecting Bermuda, the strong winds of the hurricane damaged a few ships along its path.
=== Hurricane Fox ===

Around the same time as Easy was forming, a new tropical depression developed in the far eastern Atlantic Ocean. Moving generally westward, it passed south of the Cape Verde islands, quickly strengthening into Tropical Storm Fox early on September 3; by that time, its motion turned to the west-northwest. On September 5, Fox attained hurricane status, around the same time as it was first observed by ships. Two days later, Hurricane Hunters reported peak winds of , making it a major hurricane, albeit one of very small extent. Around that time, Fox interacted with Hurricane Easy to its northwest. After maintaining peak winds for 12 hours, Fox began a steady weakening trend, accelerating to the north and northeast ahead of Easy and passing to the east of Bermuda. On September 10, Fox, while still of hurricane force, became extratropical between the Azores and Greenland in the far north Atlantic. It turned towards the north and dissipated on September 11 off the southwest coast of Iceland. Although a few ships were affected by the hurricane&#x27;s winds, there were no reports of any damage.
=== Tropical Storm George ===

Tropical Storm George developed in the Bay of Campeche on September 19. Moving west-northwestward, it quickly attained peak winds of late on the next day, as reported by the Hurricane Hunters. George later made landfall on September 21 in Mexico about south of Tampico as a moderate tropical storm. Before it moved ashore, the storm spread rainfall along the coast and increased waves, causing one drowning death. George quickly dissipated upon making landfall, and there were no reports of damage.
=== Hurricane How ===

An easterly wave spawned a tropical depression in the western Caribbean Sea on September 29. It moved north-northwestward for a few days before turning eastward in the central Gulf of Mexico. Based on Hurricane Hunter reports, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm How late on September 30, and it continued to strengthen as it approached Southwest Florida. On October 2, How attained its first peak of just before making landfall near Boca Grande, and within the day it crossed southern Florida. At the time, the storm was not well organized, and its strongest winds were confined to squalls in the Florida Keys and the southeast coast. Wind damage was minor, although heavy rainfall was reported, peaking at near where it moved ashore. The precipitation caused significant street flooding, while about of tomato and bean fields were deluged.

The storm emerged into the Atlantic Ocean between Fort Pierce and Vero Beach, quickly intensifying to hurricane strength by October 3. Turning northeastward, How reached its second and strongest peak of on October 4 as it passed near the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Along the coast, the hurricane produced high tides and minor damage. Subsequently, the hurricane briefly weakened, only to recover its peak of on October 5. It passed southeast of Cape Cod before turning more to the east-northeast, causing road closures due to high tides. Offshore, the hurricane sank a ship, killing 17 people. While still of hurricane force, How became an extratropical storm on October 6, and a few days later it curved to the northeast. The extratropical cyclone later struck Iceland with hurricane-force winds on October 9. A couple of days later, the remnants of How dissipated in the far northern Atlantic. Overall, Hurricane How caused about $2 million (1951 USD, $  USD) in damage.
=== Tropical Storm Item ===

A tropical depression formed southwest of Jamaica on October 12. A small system, it moved northwestward and intensified into Tropical Storm Item on October 13. It turned toward the north, and the next day attained peak winds of after moving through the Cayman Islands. Based on observations from the Hurricane Hunters, Item was upgraded to hurricane status in real time, although a reanalysis in 2015 lowered the peak winds to . Item lost tropical storm status on October 16 as it drifted to the northwest. Continuing a slow weakening trend, it passed just east of the Isla de la Juventud before striking western Cuba as a tropical depression on October 17. Later that day it dissipated in the southeastern Gulf of Mexico.

The threat of the hurricane prompted precautions to be made in parts of Cuba. Additionally, storm warnings were posted in the Florida Keys, southern mainland Florida, as well as the Bahamas. However, no damage was reported.
=== Hurricane Jig ===

One of the last tropical cyclones of the season formed on October 15 just northeast of the Bahamas. Although listed as a tropical storm, it would have likely been classified as a subtropical cyclone beginning in the 1970s, but was unable to be classified as such given the lack of satellite imagery to prove its status. Given the name &quot;Jig&quot;, it moved northeastward, quickly attaining hurricane status with winds of , which it maintained for a full day. On October 16, Jig began a slow weakening trend, weakening below hurricane force and turning sharply northeastward. During this time, the storm made its closest approach to the southeastern United States while passing well southeast of Cape Hatteras. While offshore, the storm increased surf along the North Carolina and Virginia coastlines, prompting storm warnings. Early October 18, Jig became extratropical with winds of and began a counterclockwise loop over the western Atlantic. The next day it turned to the southeast before dissipating about south of Bermuda on October 20.
=== Hurricane Twelve ===

In early December, a cold front passed north of Bermuda. A disturbance along the front began rotating on December 2, developing into a small but powerful extratropical storm on the next day. By late on December 3, the storm attained hurricane-force winds, and it increasingly became the dominant system within the broad frontal region. A ridge to the east turned this storm to the southwest. The winds diminished below hurricane-intensity on December 5, and concurrently the inner structure became more tropical as the frontal features dissipated. During this time, ships in the region reported strong winds, mostly to the north. Increasing water temperatures fueled atmospheric instability, likely causing an increase in convection, and the system was potentially a subtropical cyclone on December 6, while located about east-northeast of Bermuda. A nearby ship recorded a minimum pressure of around that time. After the storm turned to the southeast, a ship in the region reported winds of near the center and a pressure of , while a weather station indicated that the system had a warm core. The data suggested that the system became a fully tropical hurricane by 12:00 UTC on December 7, and that it likely had evolved into a tropical storm six hours earlier. By 18:00 UTC that night, the hurricane attained peak winds of .

On December 8, the hurricane turned to the east and weakened into a tropical storm, steered by an approaching trough. Over the next day, the storm accelerated to the east-northeast toward the Azores. Late on December 10, the storm moved through the Azores as a tropical storm, although it was reverting to an extratropical storm at the time. By 06:00 UTC on December 11, the system was extratropical again after it rejoined with a nearby cold front. It likely merged with another nontropical storm to its east on December 12, although it is possible the former hurricane remained a distinct system. A building ridge near Spain forced the extratropical system to the southeast, eventually dissipating after coming ashore in Morocco on December 15.

<text>Paul Masson (February 14, 1859 – October 22, 1940) was a French-born American winemaker. He is considered an early pioneer of California viticulture known for his brand of Californian sparkling wine.

==Biography==
Masson was born as the second child to wealthy parents in Merceuil, a wine village outside of Beaune. Both his paternal and maternal families were prominent vintners local to Burgundy, with his mother&#x27;s side, the Boillot-Grozeliers, hailing from Volnay. In 1877, after finishing his secondary education, his parents arranged for his emigration to the United States, where he lived at the grape plantation of his uncle Louis Grozelier in San Jose, California.

In 1879, he became a student of Charles Lefranc (owner of the &quot;Almaden Vineyard and Wine Company)&quot;, one of a number of French immigrants who had expanded the viticulture introduced into the Santa Clara Valley by the Catholic mission fathers. Masson returned to France in 1880 to finish school at The Sorbonne. After college, he returned to San Jose, California due to the depression in the French wine industry caused by the Phylloxera plague and became the winemaker at Almaden. Masson became engaged to Charles&#x27; daughter Louise in 1886. After the death of Lefranc in 1887, Masson purchased 573 acres in Saratoga, California, which he named &quot;La Cresta&quot;. He set about to plant 60 acres, mainly Pinot Noir and Chardonnay with cuttings from Burgundy and re-named the new winery the Paul Masson Champagne Company, now known as The Mountain Winery, which he ran with his brother-in-law Henri Lefranc. According to the Paul Masson company web site, in 1892 Masson&#x27;s first sparkling wine under the name &quot;champagne&quot; was introduced at Almaden, and Masson eventually became known as the &quot;Champagne King of California&quot; after winning at the Paris Expo in 1900.

During the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, &quot;La Cresta&quot; sustained some damage, but had his home renovated by 1907.

He was appointed to California&#x27;s Board of State Viticultural Commissioners on August 30, 1913 and won a grand prize at the World&#x27;s Fair in 1915. With the ban on alcohol during Prohibition, Paul Masson Champagne Company suffered major financial difficulties and had to rework his business model to instead manufacture canned fruit. The company was, however, allowed to produce a small quantitiy of wine for sacramental use in Catholic churches, as well as bottles of &quot;medicinal champagne&quot;. Masson eventually sold his vineyard in 1930. In 1933, with no sons to take the reins of the business, Masson sold the winery and brand rights to his neighbor Martin Ray.

Throughout the remainder of 1930s, Masson frequently traveled back to France to visit family there. He died at his home in San Jose on October 22, 1940. Masson was cremated and his ashes scattered on his old estate by his daughter, but a mausoleum was set up at Oak Hill Memorial Park.

==Winery==

Masson shifted part of his production to the Santa Cruz Mountains above Saratoga, California and built his &quot;chateau&quot; on a knob overlooking the Santa Clara Valley in 1905. Now known as &quot;The Mountain Winery&quot;, the Paul Masson Mountain Winery is on the National Park Service&#x27;s National Register of Historic Places, though it ceased making wines in 1952. Instead, it serves as a conferencing and events venue - various events are held at the winery, such as concert series, weddings, and other special events. A chess tournament was held there annually in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Around 2000, the then-current owners of the site hired winemaker Jeffrey Patterson to restart winemaking on site. The vineyards were reestablished at the Mountain Winery in 2004.

==Advertising==
The Paul Masson brand is best remembered for its 1978–1981 marketing association with actor-director Orson Welles, who promised for Masson: &quot;We will sell no wine before its time.&quot; A widely circulated and much-parodied outtake for one commercial from the campaign features Welles attempting to deliver his lines while severely inebriated.

Welles was eventually fired as a spokesman for the brand in 1981, after answering a question about Paul Masson on a TV chat show, saying that he was now on a diet and so no longer drank wine; he was (briefly) replaced as spokesman by John Gielgud.

Despite the ads&#x27; success at the time, the Paul Masson brand has suffered from a long-term image problem, particularly since its founder&#x27;s death in 1940, in being synonymous with low-end wines. As &quot;The New York Times&quot; observed in 1990: &quot;While many consumers know them - who can forget Orson Welles&#x27;s breathy incantation of &#x27;We will sell no wine before its time&#x27; for Masson - they lack cachet.&quot;

==Paul Masson and NASA==
In the 1970s, NASA bought Masson Rare Cream Sherry for a Skylab mission and packaged some for testing on a &quot;zero-G&quot; aircraft. Unfortunately, the smell quickly permeated the cabin making astronauts physically sick, and public pressure over taking alcohol into space led NASA to abandon their plans.

==Ownership of Paul Masson wines==
===Martin Ray (1936–42)===
After the death of his wife, Louise Lefranc, in 1936, Masson placed the winery on the market. Mentored by Paul Masson, California wine pioneer Martin Ray purchased the winery and vineyards.

However, two years after Masson&#x27;s own death in 1940, Ray sold the winery, using the proceeds to buy land on the hilltop across from the old Paul Masson vineyards in Saratoga, where he used Burgundian cuttings of Pinot noir and Chardonnay from the Masson estate to craft a single varietal, region-specific wine from 1943 through 1972, in what is now known as Mount Eden Vineyards.

===Seagram Company (1942–87)===
Six years after buying the Paul Masson winery and brand, Martin Ray sold them to the Canadian-based Seagram Company, Ltd, the global wine and spirits conglomerate, which (along with minority share owners) owned the brand for the next 45 years, although as early as 1952 they closed Masson&#x27;s Saratoga winery as a working wine estate.

It was Seagram who, worried by the brand&#x27;s sagging sales in the 1970s, brought in first Orson Welles (1978–81) and then John Gielgud (1982–85) as advertising spokespersons for the wines. In the 1980s, Seagram also acquired the Taylor California Cellars brand (and production facilities) from Coca-Cola, based on the premise promoted by Seagram&#x27;s strategic planning head, Mary Cunningham, that the only way to succeed in the wine business was to approach Gallo&#x27;s massive sales volume. Over the next twenty years, the American wine industry would dramatically segment itself with, essentially, all the large volume brands falling by the wayside. Internal competition and resulting cannibalization dramatically reduced the combined sales of Paul Masson and Taylor (as it did with Almaden and Inglenook, also owned by a single parent company).

===Vintners International (1987–93)===
The above changes resulted in the Paul Masson brand being sold to Vintners International in 1987, although Vintners went bankrupt six years later.

===Centera (1993–2021); renamed Constellation Brands from 2000===
Vintners was in turn purchased by the Centera Wine Company (formerly &quot;Canandaigua&quot;) of New York in 1993, as part of Vintner&#x27;s bankruptcy proceedings. Canandaigua was then renamed Constellation Brands in 2000. Constellation Brands produced two main lines with the label: Paul Masson brandies, and Paul Masson wines.

In 2008, the Paul Masson wine line was sold by Constellation Brands, along with the Paul Masson winery, to the Wine Group. However, Constellation continued to produce Paul Masson brandies until 2021.

In 2019, Constellation Brands announced that it was engaging in a major restructuring which involved focussing on “power brands”, which it defined as commanding a retail price of over $11 a bottle. This meant discontinuing or selling off 40% of their production, including the low-cost Paul Masson brandies produced in New York. Although a buyer was found, the Federal Trade Commission did not approve the sale until 2021.

===Divestment of the wines and winery to Wine Group LLC (2008–18)===
In a $134 million deal in 2008, Wine Group LLC of San Francisco purchased the Paul Masson winery, which had ceased making wine in 1952, and now serves as a conferencing and events center. Wine Group LLC subsequently removed the Paul Masson name and renamed it &quot;The Mountain Winery&quot;.

As part of the deal, Wine Group LLC also purchased two California wine brands from Constellation Brands, including the Paul Masson table wine range, consisting of three types of bottle sold - white, red, and rosé, made from grapes grown elsewhere in California. The wines were sold in the company&#x27;s distinctive jam-jar top &quot;carafe&quot; bottles. Around 2018, the company quietly discontinued the sale of Paul Masson wines.

===Sale of the brandies to E. &amp; J. Gallo (2021–present)===
In 2019, E &amp; J Gallo Winery of Modesto, California began negotiations for the acquisition of the Paul Masson brandies from Constellation Brands. In 2021, it was announced that the Federal Trade Commission had approved the sale, allowing production of the brandies to return to California after 28 years of being made in New York. No one presently makes any Paul Masson wines, as the rights remain with the Wine Group LLC, which discontinued production in 2018. As of 2024, Paul Masson table wines are now listed as part of the Gallo portfolio.

<text>Blue Lake / Warwar (The Blue Lake) is a large, monomictic, crater lake located in a dormant volcanic maar associated with the Mount Gambier maar complex. The lake is situated near in the Limestone Coast region of South Australia, and is one of four volcanic crater lakes originally on Mount Gambier maar. Of the four lakes, only two remain, the other one being Valley Lake / Ketla Malpi; the other two, Leg of Mutton Lake / Yatton Loo and Brownes Lake / Kroweratwari, dried up as the water table dropped.

==History==
Conflicting dates have been estimated for the last eruption of the volcano: of 4,300 years ago, of 28,000 years ago, and a little before 6,000 years ago. If the youngest date is correct, this could be the most recent volcanic eruption on the Australian mainland.

The Boandik (or Bungandidj) people occupied the area before the colonisation of South Australia.

==Description==

Blue Lake / Warwar is one of four lakes in the Dormant volcano complex. Sites of cultural significance to the Boandik people were assigned dual names by the City of Mount Gambier in February 2022, and the renaming included the four lakes in the Bungandidj language. These are as follows:
*Blue Lake / Warwar, meaning &quot;crow country&quot;
*Leg of Mutton Lake / Yatton Loo
*Brownes Lake / Kroweratwari, meaning &quot;emus, [or] their tracks&quot;
*Valley Lake / Ketla Malpi, meaning &quot;sacred talking tree&quot;

Blue Lake is thought to be of an average depth of , but in places reaches deep (but some unconfirmed values mention a maximum depth due to a natural cave section). The crater rim measures , but the lake itself measures . The surface of the lake is below the level of the main street of the nearby town. The Blue Lake supplies the town with drinking water.

Browne&#x27;s Lake / Kroweratwari (sometimes spelt Browns Lake) dried up in the 1980s, and is now a picnic spot.

There is a road and walking track around the circumference of Blue Lake / Warwar, with an underpass between it and Leg of Mutton Lake / Yatton Loo.

== Annual colour change==
Each November, the lake turns to a deep turquoise colour, gradually returning to a duller blue colour in late February to March. The exact cause of this phenomenon is still a matter of conjecture, but likely it involves the warming of the surface layers of the lake during the summer to around , causing calcium carbonate to precipitate out of the solution and enabling microcrystallites of calcium carbonate to form. This results in scatter of the blue wavelengths of sunlight. During winter, the lake becomes well mixed, and recent research indicates that during this phase of the colour cycle, the lake is somewhat murkier due to the redistribution of tannins and calcium carbonate particles throughout the lake. Solar elevation has also been found to influence the perceived colour of the lake. The movement of planktonic life forms within the lake during the seasons and during the day may additionally play a part in the colour change.

==Studies==
Bathymetric surveys located the deepest point in the lake at in 1967. Major diving exploration of the lake first occurred in 1985. Cave diver Peter Horne conducted temperature and visibility studies and made discoveries of a freshwater sponge species and other invertebrates. This exploration also discovered the Stromatolite Field, a collection of hollow rock formations that are found along the north-eastern perimeter down to a depth of . In 2008, permission was granted by SA Water for another diving exploration of the central and deepest parts of the lake. On this dive, core samples from the calcite-silt covered lake bed were collected where water temperature drops to .

==Gordon&#x27;s leap==

In July 1865, Adam Lindsay Gordon performed the daring riding feat known as Gordon&#x27;s Leap on the edge of the Blue Lake. A commemorative obelisk erected there has an inscription which reads:
This obelisk was erected as a memorial to the famous Australian poet. From near this spot in July, 1865, Gordon made his famed leap on horseback over an old post and rail guard fence onto a narrow ledge overlooking the Blue Lake and jumped back again onto the roadway. The foundation stone of the Gordon Memorial Obelisk was laid on 8th July 1887

<text>The Kelowna Rockets are a Canadian major junior ice hockey team based in Kelowna, British Columbia. The team plays in the B.C Division of the Western Hockey League&#x27;s Western Conference, playing their home games at Prospera Place. The Rockets are the most successful WHL team in the twenty-first century, winning three regular season titles and four playoff championships. The team has also played in the Memorial Cup finals three times, winning once, in 2004, when Kelowna hosted the tournament.

== Franchise history ==

=== Foundations ===
The club was established in 1991 as the Tacoma Rockets, playing in Tacoma, Washington. The team played four seasons in Tacoma under head coach Marcel Comeau, who was named the league and the Canadian Hockey League&#x27;s coach-of-the-year for 1992–93, although the team won only one playoff round. With the Tacoma Dome offering poor sight lines for hockey and attendance low, the team was sold and relocated to Kelowna in 1995. In Kelowna, the team spent its first four seasons playing at Kelowna Memorial Arena while a new, purpose-built arena—Prospera Place—was being constructed; the team moved to the completed arena in 1999. 

=== Rise to prominence ===
Coached by Marc Habscheid and led on the ice by the likes of Jesse Schultz, Josh Gorges, Shea Weber, and goaltender Kelly Guard, the Rockets emerged as a contending team just after the turn of the century. In 2002–03, the team won its first Scotty Munro Memorial Trophy as regular season champions with a 51-win, 109-point season. In the playoffs, they defeated the Red Deer Rebels in the final to win their first President&#x27;s Cup as league champions. At the 2003 Memorial Cup, Kelowna advanced to the semi-final, which they lost 2–1 to the Hull Olympiques. In 2004, the Rockets repeated as regular season champions before losing the Western Conference final to the expansion Everett Silvertips. However, Kelowna was able to participate in the 2004 Memorial Cup by virtue of hosting the tournament. At the tournament, the Rockets surrendered only three goals in four games en route to the championship, avenging the previous year&#x27;s defeat to the Olympiques in the final, with Guard being named tournament MVP.

In 2004–05, the Rockets finished second overall in the standings to the Kootenay Ice, who they defeated in the Western Conference final to advance to championship series. There, the defeated the Brandon Wheat Kings for their second President&#x27;s Cup in three seasons, and a berth in their third straight Memorial Cup tournament. However, at the 2005 Memorial Cup, the Rockets dropped three straight games and were eliminated.

=== Continued success ===
The 2006–07 season saw the Rockets miss the playoffs for the first time in team history, but the team&#x27;s struggles would be short-lived. The 2008–09 season saw the Rockets, led by Tyler Myers, Jamie Benn, and Tyson Barrie, advance to their third league final, where they defeated the Calgary Hitmen. Benn led the 2009 Memorial Cup tournament in scoring, and the Rockets earned a spot in the final; however, they lost 4–1 to the Windsor Spitfires.

From 2013–14 to 2016–17, the Rockets advanced to four consecutive Western Conference finals. They won once, in 2015, moving on to defeat the Wheat Kings in the final. Led by tournament MVP Leon Draistaitl, the Rockets made a third finals appearance at the 2015 Memorial Cup, but lost 2–1 in overtime to the Oshawa Generals.

The Rockets missed the playoffs for a second time in 2018–19. The team was set to host the Memorial Cup for the second time in 2020; however, the tournament was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2023–24, led by Tij Iginla, the Rockets won their first playoff series in seven years, defeating the Wenatchee Wild before losing in the second round to the Prince George Cougars.

== Team uniforms ==
Since 2000, the Rockets&#x27; uniforms have featured a logo based on the legendary Okanagan Lake monster, Ogopogo. A third jersey design features the monster&#x27;s head, taken from their shoulder patch design. The team&#x27;s colours—carried over from their days in Tacoma—are teal, red, copper, black, and white. In 2009, their jerseys were slightly modified to fit the Reebok Edge system.

Founded in circa 1240 by a Diawando slave named Beydari Tamboura, Nioro attained its greatest height in the eighteenth century as the then-capital of the Bambara kingdom of Kaarta. The town became an important trading center between Upper Senegal and the Sudan.

In the early 1850s, the Toucouleur conqueror El Hadj Umar Tall invaded Kaarta, forcing the kingdom&#x27;s conversion to Islam; he built a great mosque in Nioro in 1854. Umar Tall&#x27;s son Ahmadu Tall took refuge in Nioro after the fall of his capital Segou to the French in 1890. His army, led by the Wolof king-in-exile Alboury Ndiaye, failed to defend the city against the advancing colonial army in January 1891.

The town has an airstrip at Nioro Airport.

<doc id="1338968" wikidata="Q1550784" url="?curid=1338968" title="Showa Station (Antarctica)">
<text>, sometimes alternately spelled Syowa Station, is a Japanese permanent research station on East Ongul Island in Queen Maud Land, Antarctica. Built in 1957, Showa Station is named for the era in the Japanese calendar during which it was established, the Shōwa period.

==Overview==

Showa Station serves as a research outpost for astronomy, meteorology, biology and earth sciences. It comprises over 60 separate buildings, large and small, including a 3-storey administration building, living quarters, power plant, sewage treatment facility, environmental science building, observatory, data processing facility, satellite building, ionospheric station, incinerator, earth science building, and radiosonde station. Also present are fuel tanks, water storage, solar panels, a heliport, water retention dam, and radio transmitter.

===PANSY Incoherent Scatter Radar ===
Showa station is home to the Program of the Antarctic Syowa Mesosphere–Stratosphere–Troposphere/Incoherent Scatter (PANSY) incoherent scatter radar, which took its first measurements in 2017.

==Legacy==
===1957 Expedition===
The station was founded by the inaugural Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition in 1957. This expedition was airlifted out after a storm (by a nearby American ship that had a helicopter). However there was no space for the dogs to get on. The storm made deploying the second team impossible in February 1958. In January 1959, the third team returned to the station and found that, of the 15 sled dogs that had been left by the first team at the base, two, Taro and Jiro, had survived.

===Historic monument===
A cairn and plaque at the station commemorate Shin Fukushima, a member of the 4th Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition, who died in October 1960 while carrying out his duties. The cairn, which contains some of his ashes, was erected on 11 January 1961 by his colleagues. It has been designated a Historic Site or Monument (HSM 2) following a proposal by Japan to the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting.

==In popular culture==
* Showa Station is the Antarctic destination of the protagonists of &quot;A Place Further than the Universe&quot;, a 2018 Japanese anime series.
* The monster Ghidorah is located on the base - called &quot;Outpost 32&quot; - in the 2019 film &quot;&quot;
* Showa Station is depicted in the 1983 film &quot;Antarctica&quot;.

==Climate==

The climate is classified as an Ice cap climate (Köppen: EF), since there are no months where the average temperature exceeds .

<doc id="1338970" wikidata="Q1251792" url="?curid=1338970" title="Throne room">
<text>A throne room or throne hall is the room, often rather a hall, in the official residence of the crown, either a palace or a fortified castle, where the throne of a senior figure (usually a monarch) is set up with elaborate pomp—usually raised, often with steps, and under a canopy, both of which are part of the original notion of the Greek word &quot;thronos&quot;.

==Function==

A throne room is an impressive setting for a monarch to preside &#x27;in majesty&#x27; over official ceremonies, to hold council, to grant audiences, to receive homage, to award high honors and offices, and to perform other official functions. Any of these could just as well be transferred, even on a permanent basis, to one or more other rooms, even outside the palace or ambulant. It can also be where the royal court can gather.

A common misconception is that kings and other ruling princes governed their lands seated on a throne for most of the working day. This may have been true in earlier times, for some rulers who actually presided over their council; yet often, another room was used, but only in peacetime.

Many others were almost constantly on the move with an ambulant court. It could even have been that the crown did not have an effective capital, as in England during most of the time before the Norman conquest. Or it could have been that the crown had, rather, a series of alternative residences, as did the Holy Roman Emperors. In their case, these developed into palatinates under the Habsburg dynasty when they also acquired extensive crown lands outside Germany and Austria, and their court often travelled on an almost continental scale.

Other monarchies frequently changed their capital, but then they would have used a mobile throne, possibly in addition to the permanent one used for enthronement and/or coronation. There are cases in Africa and Asia where the very name of the &#x27;capital&#x27; is not a fixed place, but was the place wherever a king settled for a few years. In some climates court migrated annually between a summer and a winter capital. It has also common to spend quite some time, without need for practical reason, in secondary residences, not in the least hunting lodges.

Even when their capitals were fixed, English and French Renaissance kings used to travel extensively, and maintained many royal castles, in addition to paying visits to grandees of the realm. Henry VIII&#x27;s most frequently used residence was, in fact, at Hampton Court, which was then outside London.

Even when in the main or only palace, the monarch often spent much time in other parts of the residence, such as the dining hall, the chapel, private quarters (for rest and family life), possibly a separate presence room, the council chamber, ballroom, gardens, court, theatre, and other recreational facilities.

Nowadays, throne rooms are only used for occasional grand ceremonies. Paperwork is done in an office, and most guests are received in a salon.

==Notable examples==
The following are notable throne rooms. Others are listed in the article on thrones.

===Austria===

====Hofburg====
Once the seat of the Holy Roman Empire and the Austrian Empire for over 600 years, the Hofburg Imperial Palace&#x27;s throne room now serves as a conference centre, used by the Austrian Congress and for other international events.

===Canada===
The chamber of the Senate of Canada in Centre Block, which takes many of its design cues from the chamber of the British House of Lords at the Palace of Westminster, contains three thrones at its head. These thrones are used for the annual Speech from the Throne, which can be seen as a form of royal audience for Parliament, and thus the Senate chamber can be seen as a throne room in the royal presence.

===China===

In the Forbidden City, China&#x27;s last imperial palace, the principal throne rooms are the three halls of the Outer Palace: the Hall of Supreme Harmony, the Hall of Central Harmony and the Hall of Preserving Harmony, of which the Hall of Supreme Harmony was the most important.

===Denmark===
====Rosenborg====

The throne in the throne room at Rosenborg Castle (now a museum) in Copenhagen was commissioned by King Frederik III in about 1663, and used by the absolutist kings of Denmark from 1671 to 1840 for the anointing ceremony. It was probably created by Bendix Grodtschilling. It was inspired by King Solomon&#x27;s throne which, according to the Bible, was made of ivory and had six steps with lion figures on each. Tooth of Narwhal was chosen as the material, both because it was found in Danish waters and owing to its mythical associations with the unicorn; twelve lions were also commissioned, three of which, in silver, have been preserved in the room.

====Christiansborg====
The throne room actually used for receiving ambassadors is at Christiansborg.
===France===
====Versailles====
The throne was commissioned by King Louis XIV and was in use until 1789. In 1837, the Château de Versailles became a national museum. As part of the greater Versailles museum, the room is open to the public. Compare: Lit de justice.

====Fontainebleau Palace====
Preferring Fontainebleau over Versailles, Emperor Napoléon I had King Louis XV&#x27;s bedroom converted into an Imperial throne room, and it was here that Napoléon abdicated. The palace was last used by Napoléon III; it was later declared a national monument in 1871, after the collapse of the French Empire.

===Monaco: Prince&#x27;s Palace,===
For over 700 years, the Grimaldi family have ruled Monaco, and it is in this throne room that many historic festivals and ceremonies have taken place since the 16th century. It is also where most civil marriages of the Princely Family occur, before then having a religious ceremony elsewhere.

===Germany===
====Residence of Munich====
The &quot;Residenz&quot; of the Wittelsbach monarchs of Bavaria has one celebration room, which was the former throne-room, but completely destroyed by the bombing of Munich during the Second World War. It is now reconstructed and again visitable; the (smaller) throne room was rebuilt in the classicism style of the 19th century. Once, bronze figures of twelve rulers of the house of Wittelsbach stood there, between corinthic columns on a rostrum. These were the honourable monarchs of Bavaria for centuries.

====Neuschwanstein====
Note that the throne room of this beautiful, dream-like castle, Neuschwanstein, does not have a throne in it - the reason being that Ludwig II of Bavaria, its commissioner, did not live to see Neuschwanstein&#x27;s completion, therefore one was never installed.

===Hawaii===
====ʻIolani Palace====
The throne room at ʻIolani Palace was used by King David Kalākaua, his wife Queen Kapiʻolani, and his successor Queen Liliuokalani. Kalākaua and his wife actually disliked sitting on the thrones, instead preferring to stand in front of them while receiving guests. King Kalākaua held formal audiences, diplomatic receptions, and state balls, receiving and entertaining guests from all walks of life, from royalty and diplomats to writers, entertainers, and sportsmen. Following her overthrow, the trial of Queen Liliʻuokalani also occurred in this room where she was found guilty and imprisoned within the palace by the Republic of Hawaii. The throne room, like the rest of the palace, is open to the public.

===Portugal===

====Ajuda Palace, Lisbon====
The Portuguese Throne room (pt. &quot;Sala do Trono&quot;) is in the Piano nobile of the Ajuda National Palace (Palácio Nacional da Ajuda) in Lisbon. The present decoration is from the 19th century, with walls covered with crimson velvet, gold gilded French mirrors and a major Tabriz carpet from the 18th century in the precious wood floor. The ceiling is covered with Máximo dos Reis allegorical fresco and a huge crystal chandelier.
The thrones are from Portuguese fabric, second half of the 18th century with the Portuguese coat of arms on the top handled by two angels. This fauteuils ware made to substitute the Juste-Aurèle Meissonnier’s throne made to John V of Portugal and destroyed in the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. This throne was in Silver-gilt, with winged dragons, the heraldic symbolf of the House of Braganza, and the arms of Portugal supported by two allegorical statues, Europe and America.
The Throne room is still used for state events of the Portuguese Republic.

===Russia===
====Peterhof====
Used by the Tsars of Russia, the dais and throne of the Peterhof Palace dominate the eastern wall with a large picture presenting Catherine II on her horse. The room also holds numerous oil paintings and eleven chandeliers.

====Winter Palace====
Regarded as &quot;the&quot; throne of Russia, the throne of St. George&#x27;s Hall (or large throne room) is set atop the seven-stepped dais with a proscenium arch above and the symbol of the imperial family behind (the two-headed eagle).

Peter I&#x27;s Room (the smaller throne room) is modest in comparison to the former. The throne was made for Empress Anna Ivanovna in London and the picture behind displays Peter the Great with Minerva.

===Spain===
====Royal Palace of Madrid====

The Royal Palace of Madrid was the official residence of the Spanish monarch. The throne room is unique, as it retains the original decor from the days of Charles III. The sumptuous room has gold garnishing with crimson-velvet wall coverings complemented by a Tiepolo ceiling, lit by a rock crystal chandelier. Adorning the room are huge mirrors made in the royal glass factory of La Granja.

The royal family does not reside in the palace, instead choosing a smaller, more modest palace, the Zarzuela Palace, on the outskirts of Madrid. However, the Royal Palace of Madrid remains the official residence of the Spanish monarchy and is used for state occasions.

===Sweden===
====Stockholm Palace====

The throne located in the Hall of State at the Stockholm Palace is called the Silver Throne and was commissioned for the coronation of Queen Kristina in 1650. It was last used by the present king, Carl XVI Gustaf, on his accession to the throne in 1973 and at the State Opening of Parliament in 1974.
For the coronation of king Adolf Frederick and Queen Louisa Ulrica in 1750 two coronation thrones were made. Both are placed at the Stockholm palace, and one is on display in the &quot;Lovisa Ulrica audience chamber&quot;.

===United Kingdom===
The United Kingdom monarchs almost always had their own personal throne constructed. Until 1900, each throne was usually given or melted down at the end of the monarch&#x27;s reign for the next throne. The thrones after 1900 were saved. The exact number of thrones in the United Kingdom is unknown, though there are at least more than five.
The United Kingdom differs from other countries as it has instead of one or two thrones, numerous thrones, some of which are 800 years old. The “throne” used for the anointing and crowning of the monarch during the Coronation of the British Monarch is called the Chair of St. Edward, or St. Edward’s Chair. The Chair, which is centuries old, is usually on display at Westminster Abbey.

====Buckingham Palace====
The Throne Room of Buckingham Palace, the official residence of the British monarch in London, is used for court gatherings and as a second dancing room. It is dominated by a proscenium arch supported by a pair of winged figures of &#x27;victory&#x27; holding garlands above the two Chairs of Estate, which were originally made for Queen Elizabeth II’s coronation in 1953 and were refurbished for King Charles III and Queen Camilla for their coronation in 2023 and embroidered with the cyphers of the new King and Queen.

It is in the throne room that the sovereign, on special occasions, receives loyal addresses. Another use of the throne room has been for formal wedding photographs. The throne room is usually not used for ambassadors&#x27; arrival, which is usually in the ambassadors room of Buckingham Palace.

Apart from the Thrones in the room actually named Throne Room, there is also a pair of Thrones in the Buckingham Palace Ballroom, that is a larger multi-purpose hall within the palace. The ballroom is also used for investiture ceremonies in the UK&#x27;s honours system.

There are also other thrones in the Throne Room. To the right of the sovereign&#x27;s throne is Queen Victoria&#x27;s throne and opposite that on the other side of the room is the throne chairs of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. There are also two further thrones in the room.

====St James&#x27;s Palace====
Although Buckingham Palace has been the primary official residence of the British monarchs since 1837, St James&#x27;s Palace remains the &quot;senior palace&quot; of the British monarchy. St James&#x27;s remains a busy working palace, and also retains an important ceremonial function: it still is the place where the Accession Council customarily meets to proclaim the new sovereign and to receive from them the required oath. This was last seen upon the accession of King Charles III. 

St James&#x27;s Throne Room is used for official occasions. For instance it is in this room that the lord mayor and councillors of the City of Westminster usually present an address of welcome to visiting heads of state on state visits.

While the Throne Room of Buckingham Palace has two thrones on the dias, one for the reigning monarch, and another for the monarch&#x27;s consort, the Throne Room at St James&#x27;s Palace contains only one throne, for the use of the sovereign. As in the case of Buckingham Palace, the throne is placed under a canopy.

The velvet cloth behind the throne is dominated by the coat of arms of the United Kingdom.

This room was more recently the setting for the announcement of the engagement of Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Catherine Middleton, and in September 2022, the Accession Council met to proclaim Charles III as King of the United Kingdom.

====Palace of Holyroodhouse====
The Throne Room of the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh, which has been the principal royal residence in Scotland since 1505, was originally the King&#x27;s Guard Chamber, but has been used as the throne room since the visit of George IV in 1822. The present pair of thrones were made in 1911 for George V and Mary of Teck, and sit upon the dais beneath the Royal Arms of Scotland. Following the death of Elizabeth II at Balmoral Castle in September 2022, her coffin was transported to the palace, where it lay in repose in the Throne Room, before being taken in procession to St Giles&#x27; Cathedral.

====Palace of Westminster====
Although the primary purpose and reputation of the Palace of Westminster is as the seat of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, it is also officially a royal residence. While the palace has no throne room &quot;per se&quot;, the Lords Chamber contains at its head a throne, used by the monarch for addressing Parliament in the Speech from the Throne, arguably making the Chamber something of a throne room.

Clerks and officers of the House of Lords bow to the throne when crossing the chamber.

The Palace of Westminster also has a second throne under a canopy in the Robing Room, a room of the palace that remains under the authority of the Crown (and not of either House of Parliament), under the direction of the Lord Great Chamberlain, and that is used by the monarch to robe and to unrobe before and after the State Opening of Parliament.

====Windsor Castle====
Windsor Castle has a throne room known as the &quot;Garter Throne Room&quot;, where a chapter meeting of the Order of the Garter, including, if necessary, the investiture of any new Knights and Ladies, takes place once a year. The room accommodates two rows of chairs for all Knights and Ladies of the Garter, with the sovereign&#x27;s Throne at the head. The current throne housed in the Garter Throne room is another personal throne of Queen Elizabeth II although sometimes the Indian Throne, a gift to Queen Victoria, is used.

====Colloquial usage====
In British English, &quot;throne room&quot; is also used as a euphemism for &quot;lavatory&quot;.

===Ireland===
====Dublin Castle====

Located in the State Apartments, the Throne Room in Dublin Castle is preserved intact from the period when Ireland was part of the United Kingdom, when both Lords Lieutenant and visiting monarchs from Britain would use the room during important ceremonies held in the Castle. These included the investing of a new Lord Lieutenant every five years, the presentation of débutantes to the Lord Lieutenant during the Castle Season held leading up to St. Patrick&#x27;s Day, and the presentation of subjects to visiting monarchs on official State visits to Ireland. The throne canopy dates to the late 18th century, while the throne was made for the visit of George IV to Ireland in 1821, and was last used by George V in 1911. The Throne Room no longer has any role in modern-day State ceremonial. However Dublin Castle still plays an important role in this respect, serving as the location for the inauguration of the President of Ireland every seven years. This takes place in the much larger and grander St. Patrick&#x27;s Hall, the 18th century ballroom of the Viceregal Court, positioned almost adjacent to the Throne Room.

===Malaysia===
Malaysia&#x27;s head of state, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong (commonly glossed as &quot;King&quot;), is a position rotated every five years among the nine royal houses of its nine hereditary states. Each has separate palaces and throne rooms for each of the individual states, while the King resides in the Istana Negara (National Palace) in Kuala Lumpur. This and the old palace both had throne rooms called the &quot;Balai Rong Seri&quot; (Royal Audience Hall), where several state ceremonies including the King&#x27;s Installation occur.

<doc id="1338973" wikidata="Q656434" url="?curid=1338973" title="La Belle Ferronnière">
<text> () is a portrait painting of a lady, by Leonardo da Vinci, in the Louvre. It is also known as &quot;Portrait of an Unknown Woman.&quot; The painting&#x27;s title, applied as early as the seventeenth century, identifying the sitter as the wife or daughter of an ironmonger (a ), was said to be discreetly alluding to a reputed mistress of Francis I of France, married to a certain Le Ferron. Later she was tentatively identified as Lucretia Crivelli, a married lady-in-waiting to Duchess Beatrice of Milan, who became another of the Duke&#x27;s mistresses.

Leonardo&#x27;s &quot;Lady with an Ermine&quot; has also been known by this name. This was once believed to be a portrait of Cecilia Gallerani, one of the mistresses of Ludovico Sforza, Duke of Milan. The narrative and the title were applied to &quot;Lady with an Ermine&quot; when it was in Princess Izabela Czartoryska&#x27;s collection, and became confused with by the presence of a , a type of accessory worn across the forehead, in the painting as well.

==Attribution==

Although the model of the painting is still shrouded in mystery, the landmark exhibition &quot;Leonardo Da Vinci: Painter at the Court of Milan&quot; (National Gallery, London, 9 Nov. 2011 – 5 Feb. 2012) listed the portrait as possibly depicting Beatrice d&#x27;Este, wife of Ludovico Sforza. This challenges an earlier identification of the sitter as Lucrezia Crivelli, a mistress of Ludovico. However, &quot;Ferronnière&quot; could be a reference to Beatrice Sforza&#x27;s birthplace, the Duchy of Ferrara.
Karl Morgenstern (1813) and other critics noted some similarities with the drawing number 209 preserved in the Uffizi, executed in lapis and watercolor but retouched a little hard everywhere by a hand of the sixteenth century, which was identified by Father Sebastiano Resta (XVII century) as a portrait of Beatrice d&#x27;Este and attributed to Leonardo da Vinci . So also Dalli Regoli (1985), who considered the drawing the copy from a lost original by Leonardo. The most notable similarities are in the clothing and the ornament. The necklace, with its alternating black beading, perhaps references the colors of an ermine and the three strands might reference her three pregnancies.

Bernard Berenson attributed this portrait to Bernardino de&#x27; Conti. Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio was suggested by Herbert Cook, who retracted his opinion, seeing Leonardo&#x27;s own hand, in 1904.

==Copies==
A later version of the painting, on canvas, had been offered to the Kansas City Art Institute as the original, but was identified as a copy, on the basis of a photograph, by Sir Joseph Duveen, who permitted his remarks to be published in the &quot;New York World&quot; in 1920; the owner, Mrs Andrée Lardoux Hahn, sued for defamation of property in a notorious court case, which involved many of the major connoisseurs of the day, inspecting the two paintings side by side at the Louvre; the case was eventually heard in New York before a jury selected for not knowing anything of Leonardo or Morellian connoisseurship, and settled for $60,000 plus court expenses, which were considerable. The owner&#x27;s account, Harry Hahn&#x27;s &quot;The Rape of La Belle&quot; (1946) is a classic of populist conspiracy theory applied to the art world. After decades in an Omaha vault, the Hahn La Belle was sold at auction by Sotheby&#x27;s on January 28, 2010 as &quot;by a follower of Leonardo, probably before 1750&quot;; it brought $1.5 million, a price three times higher than Sotheby&#x27;s pre-sale estimate. The buyer was an unidentified American collector.

A 19th-century copy of is conserved in the Musée des beaux-arts, Chambéry. The Louvre painting is identified in pre-Revolutionary inventories of the French royal collection.

<text>The Ford MEL is a big-block 90° V8 engine family produced in various configurations by the Ford Motor Company between 1958 and 1967 in displacements from , and used in Ford, Edsel, Mercury, and Lincoln vehicles.

The MEL (for Mercury-Edsel-Lincoln) began as the replacement for the Lincoln Y-block V8 engine for use in large passenger cars. These engines were produced in Lima, Ohio at Ford&#x27;s Lima Engine plant. The MEL was in turn replaced by the Ford 385 series engine.

==Overview==
All MEL engines had wedge-shaped combustion chambers formed between a flat head surface and an angle milled block deck (10 degrees off square with the bore axis), with the piston top determining the compression ratio and combustion chamber shape, similar to the Chevrolet Big-Block 348 combustion chamber, also introduced in 1958, and the later 409 and 427. Unlike the Chevrolet, which had staggered valves and scalloped or M-shaped valve covers, the MEL valves were inline with shaft mounted rocker arms like the FE model Ford engines which were introduced at the same time. As with the previous generation V8s, an open runner intake manifold was used, requiring the use of a stamped steel lifter valley cover similar to that of the Pontiac V8 engines. Also, the intake manifold provided no exhaust crossover passage to warm the air-fuel mixture. Further MEL engines employed two individual thermostats, aimed to improve the regulation of the engine&#x27;s coolant temperature. It was introduced the same year Chrysler phased out the Hemi V8 for the Chrysler B engine which was also a wedge-shaped combustion chamber.

The MEL bore some mechanical similarities with the Ford FE, using similar components such as the oiling system, bolt patterns, and valve stems; however, the MEL was a Lincoln-specific engine and was even larger in displacement capacity. The main bearings were , while the rod bearings were . The connecting rod beam had a unique triangular shape with the shoulders for the bolts sitting low toward the cap mating surface . There was one major difference between the MEL and FE engines besides their size and weight; the valves on MEL engines were arranged in alternating fashion (I-E-I-E-I-E-I-E) and not in the manner of the FE (E-I-E-I-I-E-I-E) where the &quot;I&quot; indicates an intake valve and the &quot;E&quot; indicates an exhaust valve.

The MEL was one of three new engine families introduced by Lincoln and Ford in 1958. The others were the FE (Ford Edsel) and SD (super duty), the latter being large and extra powerful, slow-revving engines engineered for heavy-duty work trucks. The FE engine saw its use in the Edsel, a model which was introduced to the vehicle lineup by Ford, described as a car which blended design features of the Ford and Mercury lines combining them with its own individual styling. Further several new Lincoln vehicles, such as the Continental luxury sedan and coupe, as well as the all-new four-seat Thunderbird of the same year, were brought to market with the new engines.

==383==
The &quot;Marauder&quot; was the smallest member of the family. Produced from 1958 through 1960, it was only used in Mercury vehicles. It used a bore and stroke. Output began at , both with a four-barrel carburetor. The was the only output for 1959, and power dropped to for the final year.

==410==
The MEL engine was the only engine offered in the 1958 Edsel Citation and Corsair models. It was rated at and . Bore and stroke were respectively. It was not an option on the Pacer, Ranger or station wagon models, which exclusively used the FE 361 engine. 

There were no other Ford Motor Company applications for this engine such as in Ford and Mercury cars and Ford Trucks. The MEL engine range also included 383 (exclusive to Mercury), 430 (Thunderbird, Mercury, Lincoln, Continental, and Lincoln Continental) and a engine that was exclusive to Lincoln Continentals. In 1965, Ford produced a 410 version of the FE engine that was exclusive to Mercury. Other than displacement, there is no relation between the two engines.

==430==
The engine was produced from 1958 through 1965, and used in Ford, Mercury, and Lincoln products. It was the standard engine on all 1958 to 1960 Lincolns and Continentals. Power was in 1958, in 1959, in 1960, in 1961 and in 1964. It was an optional engine on all Mercurys from 1958 to 1960 but Mercury models horsepower ratings were slightly less than the Lincolns and Continentals. The 430 was also an optional engine in 1959 and 1960 Ford Thunderbirds. It was commonly referred to as the Thunderbird 430 Special. The 1958 &quot;Super Marauder&quot; version used three Holley 2300 two-barrel carburetors to generate , the first American production car to reach this figure. It was an option on all 430 equipped 1958 Mercurys and all 1958 Lincolns and Continentals. The 430 had a bore (same as the 383) and shared the stroke of the 410.

The compression ratio started at 10.5:1 for , , and , but was reduced to 10.0:1 the following year. These 1959 engines produced , but power was down to for 1960.

Some 1958 Continental Mark IIIs came brand new with the Holley 4150 four-barrel carburetor. New pistons and a four-barrel carburetor were added for 1963; the 10.1:1 compression brought output back to .

One of the later installations of the 430 was in the fourth-generation 1961-65 Lincoln Continental. The subsequent bored and stroked 462 cu in MEL was installed in 1966-68 Continentals; however, during the 1968 run, Ford’s lighter new 385-series &quot;Lima&quot; engine was phased-in and replaced the MEL, which was discontinued entirely.

==462==
The 430 was replaced by the engine in 1966. Bore and stroke were entirely different at and the 462 MEL engine produced and as much as of torque. This engine was fitted with hydraulic lifters and a four-barrel Carter AFB carburetor. This large, torquey engine was used only in Lincoln Continentals, from 1966 until mid-year in 1968 when it was replaced by the new lighter weight Ford 385-series 460 V8. Production ended after 1968, and production facilities in Lima were converted to produce the new engine family.

==Applications==

* 1958: all Edsel Citation and Corsair models as standard equipment (410 only)
* 1958–1960: all Continental models Marks III, IV, V as standard equipment (430 only)
* 1958–1960: all Lincoln models as standard equipment (430 only)
* 1958–1960: all Mercury models as standard or optional equipment (383 and 430 only)

<text>The Gatineau Olympiques are a Canadian junior ice hockey team based in Gatineau, Quebec, that plays in the Quebec Maritimes Junior Hockey League (QMJHL). Starting with the 2021–22 season, the Olympiques play home games at Centre Slush Puppie, having previously played at the Robert Guertin Centre dating back to its beginnings in the Central Junior A Hockey League. The club, then known as the Hull Festivals, was granted membership in the QMJHL in 1973. The Olympiques have appeared in the Memorial Cup seven times, winning the 1997 Memorial Cup.

==History==
Before joining the QMJHL, the team was a member of the Central Junior A Hockey League, known originally as the Hull Blackhawks (&quot;Les Éperviers de Hull&quot;) but later as the Hull Beavers (&quot;Les Castors de Hull&quot;) and Hull-Volant Junior A. Originally Hull and the CJHL were eligible to compete for the Memorial Cup, the Major Junior crown, but were relegated to Tier II Junior &quot;A&quot; in 1970. The season before joining the QMJHL in 1973 they became the Hull Festivals, and in 1976, they became the Hull Olympiques; the team name was changed to the Gatineau Olympiques one year after the city of Hull was amalgamated into Gatineau in 2002.

The Olympiques share a junior hockey market with the Ottawa 67&#x27;s, across the Ottawa River. Pre-season games between the two teams were a regular occurrence from 1975 to 1986. The teams have played interleague regular-season home and home games in the 1999–2000, 2000–01, 2001–02, 2002–03 and 2009–10 seasons since.

The Olympiques have won the President&#x27;s Cup seven times, most recently in 2007–08. The team has been to four Memorial Cup finals, losing three (1986, 2003 and 2004) and winning the 1997 Memorial Cup, which they also hosted.

From 1985 until 1992, the Olympiques were owned by Wayne Gretzky; it was under his ownership that the team first adopted black, silver and white as their team colours, similar to those of the Los Angeles Kings, whom Gretzky played for in 1988.

On May 31, 2010, it was announced that former Olympiques coach Benoit Groulx, who had left the organization to coach the Rochester Americans would be returning to be the general manager and head coach.

For the 2011–12 season, the Olympiques returned to the colours of black, silver and white following an eight-year absence.
In 2016, coach Groulx left the Olympiques again to become the head coach of the Syracuse Crunch. He was replaced by Mario Duhamel who would only coach 47 games with a 19–24–4 record. Duhamel was replaced by assistant coach Éric Landry.

<text>&quot;Steel&quot; is an episode of the American television anthology series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. Set in the near future, its premise is that human professional boxing has been banned and replaced by android boxing. The story follows a once-famous human boxer who works as a manager for an antiquated android while struggling to come to grips with his career having been taken over by machines.

The episode is based on the short story of the same name by Richard Matheson first published in the May 1956 issue of &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot;.

==Opening narration==
==Plot==
In the near-future year of 1974, boxing between human fighters has been abolished and the sport is dominated by fighting robots. Former boxer Timothy &quot;Steel&quot; Kelly manages a robot called &quot;Battling Maxo&quot;, an older model that is no longer in demand. Kelly and his partner, Pole, have used the last of their money to get to the fight venue. They are being given this chance because one of the scheduled fighters was damaged in transport. Kelly has to assure fight promoter Nolan and his assistant Maxwell that Maxo will be able to fight. After they leave Nolan&#x27;s office, Kelly and Pole argue repeatedly over Maxo&#x27;s fitness. Kelly claims Maxo should be able to go through with the fight despite its age and condition. A spring in Maxo&#x27;s arm fails when they test it, leaving it unable to fight since the part has been discontinued and they do not have a spare.

Kelly decides he will disguise himself as Maxo to collect the money necessary for repairs. Despite a valiant effort, he is unable to damage Maynard Flash, an opponent of a more advanced model than Maxo, even when he lands an unblocked punch directly to the back of its head. He is nearly killed but manages to last the first round. The crowd jeers and boos at &quot;Maxo&#x27;s&quot; performance.

Afterward, the fight promoter pays Kelly only half of the agreed-on $500 fee due to poor performance. Kelly does not protest to prevent recognition. Badly bruised but stubborn as ever, he tells Pole they will use the money to repair Maxo and get him ready to fight again.

==Closing narration==
==Production==
This was the first episode sponsored by Procter &amp; Gamble (alternating sponsorship with American Tobacco), who usually &quot;pitched&quot; Crest toothpaste, Lilt Home Permanent, and Prell shampoo, among their other products. Serling was not required to endorse any of P&amp;G&#x27;s products at the end of their episodes.

Serling, in his narration, had predicted that professional boxing would be outlawed within five years of the episode&#x27;s airing; at the time, the sport was mired in controversy after Emile Griffith killed his opponent Benny Paret in a nationally televised and particularly brutal 1962 match. With Paret&#x27;s death at Griffith&#x27;s hands, as well as the death of Davey Moore from a neck injury sustained in a March 1963 contest, the specter of the sport being outlawed was a realistic possibility at the time &quot;Steel&quot; was broadcast. Serling&#x27;s prediction did not come to fruition; although boxing declined in popularity in the succeeding years, it has never been outlawed.

Each of the five credited cast members appeared in one other episode — Lee Marvin starred in &quot;The Grave&quot; (October 1961), Joe Mantell starred as &quot;Nervous Man in a Four Dollar Room&quot; (October 1960), Chuck Hicks had an uncredited bit part as a mover in &quot;Ninety Years Without Slumbering&quot; (December 1963, two months after this episode), Merritt Bohn was billed at the bottom of the cast list in a bit part as a truck driver in &quot;Twilight Zone&quot;&#x27;s second episode, &quot;One for the Angels&quot; (October 1959) and Frank London was billed third from the end in a bit part as a driver in &quot;&quot;A Penny for Your Thoughts&quot; (February 1961).

<doc id="1339011" wikidata="Q10563755" url="?curid=1339011" title="Flagon">
<text>A flagon () is a large leather, metal, glass, plastic or ceramic vessel, used for storing and pouring drink, whether this be water, ale, or another liquid. They are generally not intended to be drunk from directly, like a cup. A flagon is typically of about in volume, and it has either a handle (when strictly it is a jug), or (more usually) one or two rings at the neck. Sometimes the neck has a large flange at the top rather than rings. The neck itself may or may not be formed into one, two or three spouts. The name comes from the same origin as the word &quot;flask&quot;.

==Christian use==

As a Roman Catholic term of use, the flagon is the large vessel, usually glass and metal, that holds the wine. Before March 2002, a flagon may have also been used to hold the wine during the consecration of the Eucharist and then be poured into many chalices. This pouring of sacramental wine from flagon to chalice was eliminated. A smaller container called a cruet is used for the priest&#x27;s chalice, usually identical to the cruet of water, which is mingled with the wine before consecration. The cruets do not remain on the altar after the preparation of the gifts.

In the Anglican Church, the flagon is the vessel that contains the wine to be consecrated. If more than one chalice is used during the administration of Communion, the flagon (or an additional cruet filled with wine and water) is placed on the altar at the Offertory, and other chalices are brought to the altar after the Breaking of the Bread. There should be only one chalice on the altar during the Great Thanksgiving.

==New Zealand==

In New Zealand, a flagon refers to a glass vessel filled with beer available in public bars or bottle stores. Drinkers could take their own washed flagons or swap their empties for those pre-filled, corked, and ready for sale. The flagon was followed by the half-gallon (2.27 L) jar and was preceded by the square rigger and the bluey. These were commonly used during the period of six-o&#x27;clock closing of bars. A flagon can hold different volumes of beer or wine and is thought to have originated from an amendment to the licensing laws, which took effect in 1881. The amendment allowed winemakers to sell wine from their vineyards for off-license consumption, so long as the quantity was 2 gallons (9 liters) or more (hence the &quot;2 g&quot; flagon). Before this change winemakers could only sell wine from hotels. A half-gallon flagon was a common volume used for beer.

<doc id="1339020" wikidata="Q3027580" url="?curid=1339020" title="God Was Born in Exile">
<text>God Was Born in Exile (French: &quot;Dieu est né en exil&quot;) is a novel by Romanian author Vintilă Horia, for which he was awarded the Prix Goncourt in 1960, though he was never handed the prize following allegations that surfaced after his nomination that he had once been a member of the Iron Guard.

The novel&#x27;s narrator is Ovid, the Roman poet, and this apocryphal work is rather similar to Marguerite Yourcenar&#x27;s &quot;Mémoires d&#x27;Hadrien&quot; in which Yourcenar writes the Roman emperor Hadrian&#x27;s mémoires.

In &quot;God Was Born in Exile&quot;, &quot;Ovid&quot; covers the last eight years of his life, when he was exiled to Tomis, an Ancient Roman colony in Scythia Minor. This novel adopts the form of a diary, divided into eight chapters (each of which corresponds to a year of exile) that reveal the steps of a progressive &quot;maturation,&quot; or a conversion of sorts.

The novel&#x27;s universe is linked together around a primordial axis whose two poles are Roman society and the Dacian world, respectively. This dichotomy generates a rich range of metaphors, but perhaps this novel&#x27;s most important attribute is the way in which both worlds are constructed, and their importance as &quot;chronotopes&quot; in the narrative. Ovid&#x27;s spiritual journey resolves itself between both symbolic universes whose antagonistic characters become interwoven during a chiasm, in order to rise up again at the end of the radically metamorphized narration.

<doc id="1339045" wikidata="Q2685630" url="?curid=1339045" title="Federal Hill, Baltimore">
<text>Federal Hill is a neighborhood in Baltimore, Maryland, that lies just to the south of the city&#x27;s central business district. Many of the structures are included in the Federal Hill Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. Other structures are included in the Federal Hill South Historic District, listed in 2003.

==Location==
The neighborhood is named for the prominent hill that is easily viewed from the Inner Harbor area, to which the neighborhood forms the physical south boundary. The hillside is a lush green and serves as a community park. The neighborhood occupies the northwestern part of a peninsula that extends along two branches of the Patapsco River—the Northwest Branch (ending at the Inner Harbor) and the Middle Branch. This peninsula is generally referred to as the South Baltimore Peninsula, and includes the neighborhoods of Federal Hill, Locust Point, Riverside, South Baltimore, and Sharp-Leadenhall. While not physically a part of the peninsula, Otterbein is also included in the collection of neighborhoods which make up greater South Baltimore. Traditionally, Federal Hill was roughly triangular, bordered by Hanover Street to the west; Hughes Street, the harbor, and Key Highway to the north and east; and Cross Street to the south.

==Amenities==
The Cross Street Market, a historic marketplace built in the 19th century, continues to serve residents and is the primary social and commercial hub for the neighborhood. As of late 2016, the City of Baltimore has entered into an agreement with Caves Valley Partners to renovate Cross Street Market. The multimillion-dollar rebuild is anticipated to break ground during Spring 2017.

The primary business district is bounded by Montgomery, Ostend, Light, Charles and Hanover Streets, and is home to a large number of restaurants of a wide range of taste, quality, and price, and many small shops as well as a few larger, more practical stores. The neighborhood is a popular destination for tavern goers and music lovers, with street festivals several times a year. These are organized through a very active neighborhood organization and business organization, as is the annual Shakespeare on the Hill series of summer performances in the park atop the actual Federal Hill. The neighborhood is also home to the American Visionary Art Museum and Maryland Science Center.

Significant and historic houses of worship include Christ Lutheran Church, Church of the Advent-Episcopal, Ebenezer African Methodist Episcopal Church, Light Street Presbyterian Church, Lee Street Baptist Church, Holy Cross Roman Catholic Church, and St. Mary&#x27;s Star of the Sea Roman Catholic Church. Federal Hill is served by Federal Hill Elementary School, Thomas Johnson Elementary Middle School, Francis Scott Key Elementary and Middle School, and Digital Harbor High School. The public library is the Light Street Branch of the famous Enoch Pratt Free Library.

==Transportation==

Federal Hill is located conveniently to Interstate 95, Interstate 395, the Baltimore-Washington Parkway, and Charles and Light Streets, which provide the major north-south surface route through Baltimore. The western portions of the neighborhood are within walking distance of the Hamburg Street and Camden Yards stops on the Baltimore Light Rail. The Charm City Circulator is a free bus system that services central Baltimore and consists of four separate routes. Two of the routes, the Purple Route which runs from Penn Station to Federal Hill, and the Banner Route which runs from the Inner Harbor to Fort McHenry, service Federal Hill.

==Early history==

Early in the colonial period the area known as Federal Hill was the site of a paint pigment mining operation. The hill has several tunnels beneath its present parklike setting. On occasion a part of a tunnel will collapse causing the need to infill the area if the depression is near the surface of the edges of the hill.

From early in the history of the city, the hill was a public gathering place and civic treasure. The hill itself was given the name in 1789 after serving as the location for the end of a parade and a following civic celebration of the ratification of the new &quot;Federal&quot; constitution of the United States of America. For much of the early history of Baltimore, the hill was known as &quot;Signal Hill&quot; because it was home to a maritime observatory serving the merchant and shipping interests of the city by observing the sailing of ships up the Patapsco River and signalling their impending arrival to downtown businesspeople.

On the night of May 12, following the Baltimore riot of 1861, the hill was occupied in the middle of the night by a thousand Union troops and a battery under the command of General Benjamin F. Butler, who had entered the city, under cover of darkness and during a thunderstorm, from Annapolis via the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. During the night, Butler and his men erected a small fort, with cannon pointing towards the central business district. Their goal was to guarantee the allegiance of the city and the state of Maryland to the United States government (with the implicit threat of force, should it have been necessary). This fort and the Union army presence persisted for the duration of the Civil War. A large flag, a few cannons, and a small Grand Army of the Republic monument remain to testify to this period of the hill&#x27;s history.

==Recent history==

In the 20th century, Federal Hill was a working-class neighborhood, and by the late 1970s was yet another struggling Baltimore inner city neighborhood, with increasing crime, racial tension, depressed property values, and an aging and decaying housing stock. Many of the industrial jobs, particularly in the shipyards and factories along the south shore of the Patapsco River, which had long provided the main source of employment for neighborhood residents were in the process of disappearing. The Bethlehem Steel shipyards on the east side of the hill was one of the last to close, in the early 1980s. The nationally recognized urban homesteading program in nearby Otterbein, begun in 1975, helped spur interest among individuals and businesses in rehabilitating homes in Federal Hill, and it soon became a hotbed of investment and rehabilitation, particularly by young professional baby boomers who had grown up in the suburbs but worked downtown.

The investment and growth throughout downtown and especially at the Inner Harbor through the 1980s and 1990s only increased the popularity of Federal Hill living over the decades following the initial reinvestment period. A second period of intense investment and rising property values began in the mid 1990s. This second stage of neighborhood investment has included not just single-family home rehabilitation but increasingly large development projects on former industrial sites, particularly on the edges of the neighborhood around the water&#x27;s edge. Within the core of the neighborhood itself, there has been an influx of new restaurants and shops. The city&#x27;s population grew 0.6% in 2006 for the first time since the 1950s with much of the growth focused in Federal Hill. Streets that used to have vacant houses on every block have now been fully renovated. Many families have moved into these houses.
==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 2,400 people living in the neighborhood. The racial makeup of Federal Hill was 87.3% White, 9.0% African American, 0.2% Native American, 2.1% Asian, 0.6% from other races, and 1.3% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.3% of the population. 55.6% of occupied housing units were owner-occupied. 8.8% of housing units were vacant.

82.5% of the population is employed and 4.0% is unemployed, with the remainder not in the labor force. The median household income was $62,466. About 1.0% of families and 7.0% of the population were below the poverty line.

21.8% of Federal Hill residents walked to work.

<text>Bruno Huber (November 29, 1930 – November 3, 1999) was a Swiss astrologer and psychologist. In 1968, with his wife, Louise Huber, he founded Astrological Psychology Institute, which became an internationally renowned school of Astrology. It was run according to humanist and psychological principles, based on Dr. Roberto Assagioli&#x27;s theory of Psychosynthesis. The school initially offered personal teaching, and then professional Diploma training from 1973. Huber schools were subsequently established in UK and Spain. The Hubers’ teachings were gradually crystallised into books, which have subsequently been translated into many languages. Their holistic method of Astrological Psychology has a worldwide following.

==Early life and marriage==
The young Bruno Huber had a voracious interest in astrology, psychology and philosophy, but became disillusioned with the practice of astrology at that time. In 1952 he met astrologer and esotericist Louise, discovering an immediate common bond. They married a year later and lived in Zürich.

==Astrological career==
Source:

In 1956 they were involved for 2–3 years with setting up a branch of the Arcane School in Geneva.

In 1958, Huber was invited to Roberto Assagioli’s Psychosynthesis Institute in Florence, which led to the pair spending three years there assisting with running of the Institute and the documentation of Assagioli&#x27;s psychosynthesis. During this period Bruno was able to perform extensive research into the horoscopes and psychological profiles of Assagioli&#x27;s patients, and eventually he developed theories on horoscope interpretation that became the basis for Astrological Psychology, or Huber Astrology.

In 1963, the couple returned to Zürich. In 1968, Huber and his wife Louise began to give seminars on the results of their researches, and the Astrological Psychology Institute was founded. A following was soon established in the locality, and the teaching activities developed apace, going further afield in Switzerland and Germany, and then at international conferences, and in USA, UK, Spain and Brazil.

By the early 2000s tens of thousands of students had been through the courses, and equivalent courses were available through Huber Schools in Spain and in UK.

From 1981, the Hubers were also heavily involved in establishing, organising and presenting at three-yearly World Astrology Conferences in Switzerland.

== Health decline and death ==
In 1991 Bruno Huber had a heart attack, though he continued working. He died in 1999 and the teaching continued, led by his wife Louise.

== Published works ==
In 1974 Bruno and Louise Huber formed a publishing company, and a series of books gradually emerged; most have subsequently been published in English and in Spanish. Original German publication date and titles of the English translations are shown below. All books are jointly by Bruno &amp; Louise Huber and first published in German, except where indicated.

<text>The Medicine Hat Tigers are a Canadian major junior ice hockey team in the Western Hockey League (WHL) based in Medicine Hat, Alberta. Established in 1970, the team has won the second most Ed Chynoweth Cups as league champion with five, and has gone on to win two Memorial Cup titles. The Tigers also have seven Division titles. Since 2015, the Tigers play at Co-op Place after forty-five seasons at the Medicine Hat Arena.

== History ==
Medicine Hat was granted a team in the Western Canada Hockey League ahead of its fifth season, and the Tigers began play in 1970–71. Although the team struggled in its inaugural season, the Tigers rapidly improved, led by the scoring exploits of Tom Lysiak—who won league scoring titles in 1972 and 1973—Lanny McDonald. The team made the playoffs in its second season, and in its third made it to the championship final. In the final, they defeated the Saskatoon Blades to win their first title.

The Tigers&#x27; next significant run of success came in the latter half of the 1980s. In 1986, the team secured its first regular season title and advanced to its first of three consecutive league finals. Led by the likes of Trevor Linden, Wayne McBean, and Mark Pederson, the Tigers would capture back-to-back championships and Memorial Cup titles in 1987 and 1988. Because of their success, the championship Tigers&#x27; teams were inducted into the Alberta Sports Hall of Fame.

The Tigers won two more league titles in a four-year span between 2004 and 2007. In 2004, Medicine Hat put together the best record in the Eastern Conference and advanced to the final, where they swept the expansion Everett Silvertips. In 2005–06, the Tigers secured their second regular season title, before losing the Conference Final against the Moose Jaw Warriors. The following season, they would return to the championship series, where they faced the Vancouver Giants. Backstopped by goaltender Matt Keetley, the Tigers defeated the Giants in double-overtime of game seven to win the title. Because Vancouver was hosting the 2007 Memorial Cup, both teams advanced to the tournament. The Tigers again defeated the Giants in overtime during the preliminary round in order to advance directly to the final, which wound up being a re-match between the two rivals. In the final, the host Giants avenged their earlier losses, defeating the Tigers 3–1 at Pacific Coliseum.

Since their last title run in 2007, the Tigers have missed the playoffs only twice, but have failed to advance past the second round of the playoffs, even despite securing division titles in 2016–17 and 2017–18. In 2015, the team moved from the old Arena to the new Co-op Place. In 2024, Gavin McKenna became the fourth Tiger and the first since Neil Brady in 1986 to be named the winner of the Jim Piggott Memorial Trophy as WHL rookie of the year.

<doc id="1339086" wikidata="Q340034" url="?curid=1339086" title="Khao Lak">
<text>Khao Lak (, ) is a small village in Phang Nga province, located South of the main mountain. Tour operators like to use the popular name as location for a series of other villages, now tourist-oriented, mainly in the Takua Pa District of Phang Nga Province, Thailand.

The name &quot;Khao Lak&quot; literally translated means &#x27;Main Mountain&#x27;. This was one of the peaks used by ancient sea farers as a landmark to guide them into the safe harbor at Thaplamu. Lak mountain is one of the main peaks in the hilly small mountainous region (maximum height in Khao Lak-Lam Ru National Park.

The tiny village of Ban Khao Lak, the original beach, Hat Khao Lak, and the bay of Khao Lak (Ao Khao Lak) actually all lie in the Lam Kaen sub-district of Thai Mueang District. However the name Khao Lak has now grown to enclose many other villages in the area, mostly on the Northern side of the mountain in the Khukkhak sub-district of Takuapa district.

== Location ==
Khao Lak is a series of villages, now tourist-oriented, mainly in the Takua Pa District and partly in the Thai Mueang District of Phang Nga Province, Thailand. It is located on the Andaman Sea coastline, approximately 60 kilometers north of Phuket. The region is known for its tranquil beaches, lush tropical landscapes, and as a departure point for diving trips to the Similan Islands.

Distances to Other Thai Cities

Bangkok: Bangkok, the capital city of Thailand, is roughly 760 kilometers north of Khao Lak. Travel options include flights to Phuket followed by a road journey, or direct buses and trains to nearby areas with connecting transportation to Khao Lak.

Phuket: Being only 60 kilometers south of Khao Lak, Phuket is easily accessible by road. Regular bus services and taxis connect these two popular tourist destinations.

Samui: The island of Samui is located approximately 300 kilometers northeast of Khao Lak. Travel between these locations typically involves a combination of road and ferry travel, or a flight from or to Samui Airport.

Krabi: Krabi is around 150 kilometers to the southeast of Khao Lak. Regular bus services, taxis, and private car hires are available for this journey.

== Beaches ==
Beach boundaries are fluid, and vary with local prejudices, official government pronouncements, and the marketing efforts of local resorts. It is generally accepted that Khao Lak beaches include (from south to north):

* Tablamu Beach, Lam Kaen and Tablamu Navy Base
* Khao Lak Beach, south of the headland marking the southern boundary of the region
* Nang Thong Beach, in the village of Bang La On (frequently called—mistakenly—Khao Lak)
* Bang Niang, in the village of the same name some 2–3 km (1.5 to 2 miles) north of Bang La On
* Khuk Khak, in the village of the same name some 2–3 km (1.5 to 2 miles) north of Bang Niang
* Cape Pakarang, north of Khuk Khak
* Coconut Beach, north side of Cape Pakarang
* White Sand Beach, north side of Cape Pakarang
* Bang Sak, north of Cape Pakarang
* Bang Lud Beach, north of Laem Tantawan

Taken together, these beaches stretch for some along the Andaman Sea. All beaches are public, as are all beaches in Thailand.

== Economy ==
Since the tsunami, Khao Lak&#x27;s infrastructure and economy have bounced back. Coastal resorts have been reconstructed or repaired, and new ones have been built or are in the process of being built. In 2016, there were reportedly 7,822 hotel rooms at 104 registered accommodations. Occupancy rates range from 70 to 90 percent during the high season period (November–March).

Over time, the economy in the Khao Lak region has evolved and changed. In the past, the tin mining played a significant role as an economic sector. Today, other industries have come to the forefront. Shrimp farms contribute to food production, while fishing continues to be a source of income. Rubber plantations provide raw materials for various products, and palm oil plantations are also an important economic factor. Additionally, fruit plantations, especially for exotic fruits like mangosteen, rambutan, and durian, have become established.

Today, tourism has become the main source of income for the region, significantly shaping Khao Lak&#x27;s economic landscape. However, during the Covid pandemic, there was an increased focus on agriculture. This emphasis has helped stabilize the economy in a time of uncertainty and showcases the diversity and adaptability of the economic sectors in Khao Lak.

==History==
The lush area around Khao Lak was once called Takola. Artifacts dating back to 1,400 years show evidence it was a significant coastal town and trading post of the ancient Maritime Silk Route.

In 1987, over nine huts were found inside cashew nut trees of Khao Lak Resort, which are one of the most beautiful areas of forest where species of Thai wildlife are a common sight. Khao Lak was mentioned for the first time in 1988 in the second edition of Traveller Handbuch Thailand by Stefan Loose Verlag.

===2004 tsunami===

Khao Lak was the coastal area of Thailand hardest hit by the tsunami resulting from the 26 December 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. Many people died including many foreign tourists. The final death toll was over 4,000, with local unofficial estimates topping 10,000 due to the lack of accurate government censuses and the fact that much of the migrant Burmese population was not documented nor recognized as legal residents.

Most of the coastal landscape was destroyed by the tsunami. Some replanting programmes have been initiated and a great deal has been accomplished in the rejuvenation of surrounding foliage. Studies suggesting that coastal vegetation may have helped buffer the effects of the waves have ensured that replanting and maintenance of the coastal vegetation have become a priority in the reconstruction of the landscape.

The force of the tsunami washed &quot;Patrol Boat 813&quot; (&quot;Tor 813&quot;) almost inland from Bang Niang Beach. It was on patrol, guarding Bhumi Jensen, a grandson of the king, as he was jet skiing in front of La Flora Resort. Despite rescue efforts, he could not be saved. His mother, Princess Ubol Ratana, and sister survived by fleeing to an upper story of La Flora. &quot;Patrol Boat 813&quot; remains where it came to a stop after the waters receded, and has been preserved as a museum ship.

Others among the casualties were well-known Finnish musician and TV host Aki Sirkesalo and his family, and Imre von Polgar, guitarist for the Swedish rock band, The Watermelon Men. Almost four years old at the time, a young girl was swept away at Khao Lak and remained the subject of a media-covered intensive search despite being formally identified in August 2005 as a victim. Jane Holland (née Attenborough) the elder daughter of the film director and actor Richard Attenborough perished in the tsunami with several members of her family. Former President of Finland Sauli Niinistö and his adult son survived by clinging to a power pole. Since the 2004 tsunami, an early-warning system has been installed along the affected coastline. In April 2012, it received its most recent test following an earthquake off the coast of Sumatra. Audible warning sirens alerted the local population to the possibility of a tsunami roughly 2 hours before estimated landfall, allowing the populace to move to higher ground inland.

The 2012 film &quot;The Impossible&quot; is based on the true story of the family of María Belón, who survived the 2004 tsunami, and was also filmed in Khao Lak.

== Administration ==
The Khao Lak region falls almost entirely within the Khuk Khak Sub-district (&quot;tambon&quot;) of the Takua Pa District (&quot;amphoe&quot;) of Phang Nga Province. The Takua Pa District is divided into eight sub-districts. The village of Ban Khao Lak does not fall within the Khuk Khak sub-district, the area commonly thought of as &quot;Khao Lak&quot;. 
== Weather ==
The weather in Khao Lak can be separated into two distinct seasons. The dry season between November and April, and the monsoon season from May to October. Khao Lak is mostly warm all year round with temperatures averaging around 28 °C to 32 °C.

In the dry season it is not uncommon for Khao Lak to go without rain for around six weeks at a time. This is the main tourist season when the weather is more settled. During this time the wind generally comes from the East, meaning the town is sheltered by its position on the Western side of the mountains near the coast.

In the monsoon season however the wind changes direction and comes from the West where it reflects off of the mountains and causes strong winds, waves and storm like conditions in the area.

<text>St. Patrick&#x27;s High School, located in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, is a Catholic high school publicly funded under the Ontario school system as part of the Ottawa Catholic School Board. It was founded in 1929 by the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate.

==History==
In 1929, St. Patrick&#x27;s College High School 135 students and 7 teachers were housed in St. Joseph Parish Hall, a two-storey, red brick hall on Laurier Avenue East in Ottawa. St. Patrick&#x27;s High School has had a crest and motto since its founding in 1929. The school logo includes the name of the school, St. Patrick&#x27;s High School, and the motto “Religio Alit Artes.” The armorial bearings of St. Patrick&#x27;s High School in Ottawa was “entered in the Public Register of Arms, Flags and Badges of Canada” and presented to the school on Wednesday, March 6, 2002.

In 1930, St. Patrick&#x27;s College High School moved to join the new St. Patrick&#x27;s College at a joint campus of 392 students and a faculty of 22 facing Echo Drive and the Rideau Canal. The Echo Drive facility housed the school for almost four decades. Masses were held in the college chapel until the church was built in 1931. From 1930- 1964, St. Patrick&#x27;s College High School took in boarders from the Ottawa Valley area as well as from farther afield.

The Patrician, the first St. Patrick&#x27;s High School newspaper, was published in 1934.

The Oblates’ active involvement in the administration of the school from 1929 came to an end in 1973. The names of 155 Oblates of Mary Immaculate in St. Peter&#x27;s Province, who taught at St. Patrick&#x27;s High School during the period 1929-1973 are engraved on a plaque that was mounted on an Oblate cross and presented to the students and staff of St. Patrick&#x27;s High School on March 17, 1986.

The school was renamed St. Jude&#x27;s Junior High School for the 1972–73 school year. In 1973, the school was renamed St. Patrick&#x27;s Junior High School because the higher grades were no longer accommodated. The school was renamed St. Patrick&#x27;s High School, a full-fledged secondary school in 1986. St. Patrick&#x27;s High School remained at the 1485 Heron Road site until 1993, when it moved to 2525 Alta Vista Drive, then the location of École Secondaire Charlebois of the French Public School Board. During the 1993-94 school year, the building was shared by the two schools, after which Charlebois was closed and students transferred to other schools including De La Salle.

86 former students of St. Patrick&#x27;s were killed in World War II.

In 1968 St. Patrick&#x27;s College became affiliated with Carleton University. St. Patrick&#x27;s College High School relocated to the Campanile Campus at 1485 Heron Road, where St. Patrick&#x27;s shared the location with Notre Dame High School, run by the Sisters of the Congregation of Notre Dame. In 1968, the school change its name from St. Patrick&#x27;s College High School to St. Patrick&#x27;s High School.

== Athletics ==
The St Pat&#x27;s Irish play in the NCSSAA (National Capital Secondary Schools Athletic Association).

In September 1989, the “St. Pat’s Fighting Irish” hit the field for the first time since 1975, defeating Laurentian High School in the process. The school celebrated its 75th anniversary in 2004. To mark the occasion, a video was produced by Roy
Ketcheson.

<doc id="1339097" wikidata="Q6029727" url="?curid=1339097" title="Infinite-dimensional holomorphy">
<text>In mathematics, infinite-dimensional holomorphy is a branch of functional analysis. It is concerned with generalizations of the concept of holomorphic function to functions defined and taking values in complex Banach spaces (or Fréchet spaces more generally), typically of infinite dimension. It is one aspect of nonlinear functional analysis.

==Vector-valued holomorphic functions defined in the complex plane==
A first step in extending the theory of holomorphic functions beyond one complex dimension is considering so-called &quot;vector-valued holomorphic functions&quot;, which are still defined in the complex plane C, but take values in a Banach space. Such functions are important, for example, in constructing the holomorphic functional calculus for bounded linear operators.

Definition. A function &quot;f&quot; : &quot;U&quot; → &quot;X&quot;, where &quot;U&quot; ⊂ C is an open subset and &quot;X&quot; is a complex Banach space, is called &quot;holomorphic&quot; if it is complex-differentiable; that is, for each point &quot;z&quot; ∈ &quot;U&quot; the following limit exists:

:formula_1

One may define the line integral of a vector-valued holomorphic function &quot;f&quot; : &quot;U&quot; → &quot;X&quot; along a rectifiable curve γ : [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;] → &quot;U&quot; in the same way as for complex-valued holomorphic functions, as the limit of sums of the form

:formula_2

where &quot;a&quot; = &quot;t&quot;0 &lt; &quot;t&quot;1 &lt; ... &lt; &quot;t&quot;&quot;n&quot; = &quot;b&quot; is a subdivision of the interval [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;], as the lengths of the subdivision intervals approach zero.

It is a quick check that the Cauchy integral theorem also holds for vector-valued holomorphic functions. Indeed, if &quot;f&quot; : &quot;U&quot; → &quot;X&quot; is such a function and &quot;T&quot; : &quot;X&quot; → C a bounded linear functional, one can show that

:formula_3
Moreover, the composition &quot;T&quot; &quot;f&quot; : &quot;U&quot; → C is a complex-valued holomorphic function. Therefore, for γ a simple closed curve whose interior is contained in &quot;U&quot;, the integral on the right is zero, by the classical Cauchy integral theorem. Then, since &quot;T&quot; is arbitrary, it follows from the Hahn–Banach theorem that

:formula_4

which proves the Cauchy integral theorem in the vector-valued case.

Using this powerful tool one may then prove Cauchy&#x27;s integral formula, and, just like in the classical case, that any vector-valued holomorphic function is analytic.

A useful criterion for a function &quot;f&quot; : &quot;U&quot; → &quot;X&quot; to be holomorphic is that &quot;T&quot; &quot;f&quot; : &quot;U&quot; → C is a holomorphic complex-valued function for every continuous linear functional &quot;T&quot; : &quot;X&quot; → C. Such an &quot;f&quot; is weakly holomorphic. It can be shown that a function defined on an open subset of the complex plane with values in a Fréchet space is holomorphic if, and only if, it is weakly holomorphic.

==Holomorphic functions between Banach spaces==
More generally, given two complex Banach spaces &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; and an open set &quot;U&quot; ⊂ &quot;X&quot;, &quot;f&quot; : &quot;U&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; is called holomorphic if the Fréchet derivative of &quot;f&quot; exists at every point in &quot;U&quot;. One can show that, in this more general context, it is still true that a holomorphic function is analytic, that is, it can be locally expanded in a power series. It is no longer true however that if a function is defined and holomorphic in a ball, its power series around the center of the ball is convergent in the entire ball; for example, there exist holomorphic functions defined on the entire space which have a finite radius of convergence.

==Holomorphic functions between topological vector spaces==
In general, given two complex topological vector spaces &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; and an open set &quot;U&quot; ⊂ &quot;X&quot;, there are various ways of defining holomorphy of a function &quot;f&quot; : &quot;U&quot; → &quot;Y&quot;. Unlike the finite dimensional setting, when &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are infinite dimensional, the properties of holomorphic functions may depend on which definition is chosen. To restrict the number of possibilities we must consider, we shall only discuss holomorphy in the case when &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are locally convex.

This section presents a list of definitions, proceeding from the weakest notion to the strongest notion. It concludes with a discussion of some theorems relating these definitions when the spaces &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; satisfy some additional constraints.

===Gateaux holomorphy===
Gateaux holomorphy is the direct generalization of weak holomorphy to the fully infinite dimensional setting.

Let &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; be locally convex topological vector spaces, and &quot;U&quot; ⊂ &quot;X&quot; an open set. A function &quot;f&quot; : &quot;U&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; is said to be Gâteaux holomorphic if, for every &quot;a&quot; ∈ &quot;U&quot; and &quot;b&quot; ∈ &quot;X&quot;, and every continuous linear functional φ : &quot;Y&quot; → C, the function
:formula_5
is a holomorphic function of &quot;z&quot; in a neighborhood of the origin. The collection of Gâteaux holomorphic functions is denoted by HG(&quot;U&quot;,&quot;Y&quot;).

In the analysis of Gateaux holomorphic functions, any properties of finite-dimensional holomorphic functions hold on finite-dimensional subspaces of &quot;X&quot;. However, as usual in functional analysis, these properties may not piece together uniformly to yield any corresponding properties of these functions on full open sets.

====Examples====
*If &quot;f&quot; ∈ &quot;U&quot;, then &quot;f&quot; has Gateaux derivatives of all orders, since for &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;U&quot; and &quot;h&quot;1, ..., &quot;hk&quot; ∈ &quot;X&quot;, the &quot;k&quot;-th order Gateaux derivative &quot;Dkf&quot;(&quot;x&quot;){&quot;h&quot;1, ..., &quot;hk&quot;} involves only iterated directional derivatives in the span of the &quot;hi&quot;, which is a finite-dimensional space. In this case, the iterated Gateaux derivatives are multilinear in the &quot;hi&quot;, but will in general fail to be continuous when regarded over the whole space &quot;X&quot;.
*Furthermore, a version of Taylor&#x27;s theorem holds:
::formula_6 
:Here, formula_7 is the homogeneous polynomial of degree &quot;n&quot; in &quot;y&quot; associated with the multilinear operator &quot;Dnf&quot;(&quot;x&quot;). The convergence of this series is not uniform. More precisely, if &quot;V&quot; ⊂ &quot;X&quot; is a &quot;fixed&quot; finite-dimensional subspace, then the series converges uniformly on sufficiently small compact neighborhoods of 0 ∈ &quot;Y&quot;. However, if the subspace &quot;V&quot; is permitted to vary, then the convergence fails: it will in general fail to be uniform with respect to this variation. Note that this is in sharp contrast with the finite dimensional case.

*Hartog&#x27;s theorem holds for Gateaux holomorphic functions in the following sense:
If &quot;f&quot; : (&quot;U&quot; ⊂ &quot;X&quot;1) × (&quot;V&quot; ⊂ &quot;X&quot;2) → &quot;Y&quot; is a function which is &quot;separately&quot; Gateaux holomorphic in each of its arguments, then &quot;f&quot; is Gateaux holomorphic on the product space.

===Hypoanalyticity===
A function &quot;f&quot; : (&quot;U&quot; ⊂ &quot;X&quot;) → &quot;Y&quot; is hypoanalytic if &quot;f&quot; ∈ &quot;H&quot;G(&quot;U&quot;,&quot;Y&quot;) and in addition &quot;f&quot; is continuous on relatively compact subsets of &quot;U&quot;.

===Holomorphy===
A function &quot;f&quot; ∈ HG(U,&quot;Y&quot;) is holomorphic if, for every &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;U&quot;, the Taylor series expansion
:formula_6
(which is already guaranteed to exist by Gateaux holomorphy) converges and is continuous for &quot;y&quot; in a neighborhood of 0 ∈ &quot;X&quot;. Thus holomorphy combines the notion of weak holomorphy with the convergence of the power series expansion. The collection of holomorphic functions is denoted by H(&quot;U&quot;,&quot;Y&quot;).

===Locally bounded holomorphy===
A function &quot;f&quot; : (&quot;U&quot; ⊂ &quot;X&quot;) → &quot;Y&quot; is said to be locally bounded if each point of &quot;U&quot; has a neighborhood whose image under &quot;f&quot; is bounded in &quot;Y&quot;. If, in addition, &quot;f&quot; is Gateaux holomorphic on &quot;U&quot;, then &quot;f&quot; is locally bounded holomorphic. In this case, we write &quot;f&quot; ∈ HLB(&quot;U&quot;,&quot;Y&quot;).

<text>Thomas Percy, 7th Earl of Northumberland, 1st Baron Percy, KG (152822 August 1572), led the Rising of the North and was executed for treason. He was later beatified by the Catholic Church.

==Early life==
Percy was the eldest son of Sir Thomas Percy and Eleanor, daughter of Sir Guiscard Harbottal. He was the nephew of Henry Percy, 6th Earl of Northumberland, with whom Anne Boleyn had a romantic association before she became the wife of King Henry VIII. When Thomas was eight years old his father, Sir Thomas Percy, was executed at Tyburn (2 June 1537) for having taken a leading part in the Pilgrimage of Grace, and he also is considered a martyr by many. Thomas and his brother Henry were then removed from their mother&#x27;s keeping and entrusted to Sir Thomas Tempest.

In 1549, when Thomas Percy came of age, an Act was passed &quot;for the restitution in blood of Mr. Thomas Percy&quot;. Shortly afterwards he was knighted, and, three years later, in Queen Mary I&#x27;s reign, he regained his ancestral honours and lands. He was returned as Member of Parliament for Westmorland in the Parliament of England called in November 1554. Declared governor of Prudhoe Castle he besieged and took Scarborough Castle, which was seized by rebels in 1557. In reward he was granted the title of Earl of Northumberland and the Baronies of Percy, Poynings, Lucy, Bryan, and Fitzpane were restored to him, on 1 May 1557. He was installed at Whitehall with great pomp, and soon after was named Warden General of the Marches, in which capacity he fought and defeated the Scots.

==Life under Elizabeth&#x27;s Reign==
On Queen Elizabeth I&#x27;s accession the earl, whose loyalty to the Catholic Church was known, was kept in the North while the anti-Catholic measures of Elizabeth&#x27;s first Parliament were passed. Elizabeth continued to show him favour, and in 1563 gave him the Order of the Garter. He had then resigned the wardenship and was living in the South. But the systematic persecution of the Catholics rendered their position most difficult, and in the autumn of 1569 the Catholic gentry in the North, stirred up by rumours of the approaching excommunication of Elizabeth, were planning to liberate Mary, Queen of Scots, possibly with a view putting her on the English throne, and to obtain liberty of worship. Earl Thomas with the Earl of Westmorland wrote to the pope asking for advice, but before their letter reached Rome circumstances hurried them into action against their better judgment.

==Marriage and children==

In 1558 he married Anne Somerset, daughter of Henry Somerset, 2nd Earl of Worcester. Their children included:
*Thomas Percy, Baron Percy (died 1560), predeceased his father
*Elizabeth Percy, wife of Richard Woodroffe of Woolley, son of Francis Woodroffe.
*Joan Percy, wife of Lord Henry Seymour, a younger son of Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset by his wife Anne Stanhope.
*Lucy Percy, wife of Edward Stanley of Tong Castle, the son of Sir Thomas Stanley by his wife Margaret Vernon
*Mary Percy (11 June 15701643), a nun, founder of Benedictine Dames in Brussels from which nearly all the existing houses of Benedictine nuns in England are descended.

==Death==
===Capture and beheading===
After the Rising of the North failed, Thomas fled to Scotland, where he was captured by the Earl of Morton, one of the leading Scottish nobles. He was held at Lochleven Castle. Margaret Erskine wrote that her son, the Laird of Lochleven, was at Loch Leven, &quot;and it is all frozyn, quha (who) is at greitt charges by resoun of grett company in his houss daylie for the keiping of my Lord of Northumberland&quot;.

After three years, the Earl was sold to the English Government for two thousand pounds. He was conducted to York and on 22 August 1572 was beheaded at a public execution on Pavement, refusing an offer to save his life by renouncing Catholicism. His headless body was buried at the now demolished St Crux Church, York.

==Succession==
His wife survived him, as did four daughters who were his co-heirs. The baronies of Percy and of Poynings and the earldom of Northumberland of the older creation were forfeited, but owing to a clause in the patent the newer earldom of Northumberland and the other honours conferred in 1557 were not. As his only son had predeceased him without male issue, the earldom passed to his younger brother Henry Percy, 8th Earl of Northumberland.

==Beatification==
He was beatified by Pope Leo XIII on 13 May 1895 and his feastday was appointed to be observed in the Diocese of Hexham and Newcastle annually on 14 November.

<doc id="1339120" wikidata="Q2102923" url="?curid=1339120" title="Polymeal">
<text>The Polymeal is a diet-based approach to combatting heart disease, proposed in December 2004 by Oscar Franco, a Colombian public health scientist at the University Medical Centre in Rotterdam, Netherlands. Franco and his colleagues suggest the &quot;Polymeal&quot; as a natural alternative to the &quot;Polypill&quot;, a multi-drug-based strategy for reducing heart disease. The researchers used the same technique in the polypill paper: a statistical &quot;meta-analysis&quot; which combined the results of many previous studies. The paper, appearing in the BMJ&#x27;s traditionally light-hearted Christmas issue, may be regarded as somewhat satirical, as noted in responses in the journal.

==History==
The study claims that adherence to the polymeal diet would delay the average onset of heart attack by nine years among men and by eight years among women. Because cardiovascular disease is the #1 cause of mortality in first-world nations, this delay of heart failure would increase the average lifespan of men by six years and women by 5.5 years.

The researchers combined several food items:
* Red wine, which contains the antioxidant resveratrol, and alcohol, which some researchers think may help to reduce atherosclerosis by reducing clotting.
* Dark chocolate without dairy products
* Almonds
* Garlic
* Fish, particularly oily fish, which are sources of the Omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA.
* Fruits and vegetables

They suggest a person should consume, every day:
* 150 mL of red wine (about one glass)
* 100 g of dark chocolate
* 400 g of fruits and vegetables
* 2.7 g of garlic
* 68 g of almonds
as well as 118 g of fish per day four times each week.

Since the Polymeal is based on principles of combating inflammation, this diet could be extended to the following foods:
* fruits and vegetables (as the staple)
* ginger root
* potatoes
* fish (other than catfish and tilapia)
* grass-fed beef (as opposed to grain-fed)
* chicken and eggs
* herbs and spices
* olive oil
* butter (ghee)
* coconut oil
* nuts
* dark chocolate (at least 85% chocolate)
* much water
* green tea
* red wine (dry and aged)
* turmeric (Curcuma longa)

==Controversy about alcohol and health==
Alcohol&#x27;s overall effect on health is uncertain. In 2023, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that there is currently no conclusive evidence from studies that the potential benefits of moderate alcohol consumption for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes outweigh the increased cancer risk associated with these drinking levels for individual consumers.

<doc id="1339139" wikidata="Q5496770" url="?curid=1339139" title="Freddie Mitchell">
<text>Freddie Lee Mitchell II (born November 28, 1978) is an American former professional football player who was a wide receiver for four seasons with the Philadelphia Eagles of the National Football League (NFL). He was chosen as a consensus All-American in 2000 while playing college football for the UCLA Bruins. Philadelphia selected him in the first round of the 2001 NFL draft, and he spent four seasons as a member of the Eagles, culminating in an appearance in Super Bowl XXXIX following the 2004 NFL season.

A four-sport athlete at Kathleen High School, Mitchell committed to UCLA to play football for the Bruins. In his collegiate debut in 1998, he had four receptions for 108 yards, including a 79-yard touchdown from Cade McNown, as well as a 34-yard touchdown pass to Brian Poli-Dixon. Mitchell broke his femur the following week against Houston and missed most of the season. Limited by a knee cartilage injury throughout the 1999 season, he finished with 38 receptions for 533 yards. As a junior in 2000, Mitchell was a Fred Biletnikoff Award finalist and earned first-team All-Pacific-10 Conference (Pac-10) honors at the conclusion of the season. In the 2000 Sun Bowl, he had nine catches for a Sun Bowl record of 180 yards. He declared for the 2001 NFL Draft following the 2000 season and finished his college career with 77 catches for 1,494 yards and nine touchdowns.

Mitchell was drafted by the Eagles with the 25th selection in the first round of the 2001 NFL Draft. He began the 2001 season as the fourth wide receiver, but surpassed Na Brown to become the team&#x27;s slot receiver in week eight. When the Eagles signed Antonio Freeman before the 2002 season, Mitchell became the fourth receiver again and caught twelve passes the entire year. Mitchell became the slot receiver once again during the 2003 season, after Freeman left. In the NFC Divisional Playoff Game against the Green Bay Packers, with the Eagles facing a 4th and 26 situation, he caught a 28-yard pass from Donovan McNabb to help lead the team to a win in overtime. He finished the 2003 season with a career-high 35 catches for 498 yards and two touchdowns.

The presence of Terrell Owens in 2004 led to limited opportunities for Mitchell to catch passes and he showed his frustration on and off the field. When Owens went down with an ankle injury towards the end of the season, Mitchell replaced him as the starter and had a two-touchdown performance in the Divisional Playoff Game against the Minnesota Vikings. After the game, Mitchell said, &quot;I just want to thank my hands for being so great.&quot; In the week prior to Super Bowl XXXIX against the New England Patriots, he created controversy by offending members of the Patriots&#x27; secondary, including Rodney Harrison. He caught one pass for 11 yards in the Super Bowl and was released by the Eagles on May 6, 2005. The Kansas City Chiefs signed him shortly after, but he declined to have arthroscopic surgery on his injured knee and he was released before the start of the season. After his NFL career ended, Mitchell bought a barbecue restaurant in Lakeland in 2008, but the venue was closed in September 2009. Mitchell served time in prison for tax fraud from 2013 to 2016.

==Early years==
Mitchell grew up as the son of a pastor in Lakeland, Florida. He attended Kathleen High School in Lakeland, where he lettered in cross country, baseball, football, and basketball. In baseball, Mitchell was used as a pinch hitter and played outfielder. He played in the Polk County East–West Senior All-Star Game in 1997 for the West squad. He had a .388 batting average, three home runs, and eleven runs batted in (RBI). Mitchell was drafted by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in the 47th round of the 1997 Major League Baseball Draft after graduating from Kathleen. He had brief contract negotiations with the Devil Rays, but decided to attend college instead of signing with a professional team. He was a guard in basketball, and scored 11 points in the 1997 Class 4A boys&#x27; high school basketball state championship for Kathleen as the Red Devils won their first ever title. Mitchell, who had three steals in the game, was called for a technical foul after he went out-of-bounds and punched a cooler. In football, he contributed as a wide receiver, kick returner, punt returner, holder for kicker Paul Edinger, and defensive back. Mitchell earned &quot;The Ledger&quot; second-team all-Lakeland area honors as a utility player following the 1995 season.

Mitchell visited the University of Florida, Florida State University, the University of Miami, and Michigan State University before he committed to the University of California, Los Angeles to play football for the Bruins. He chose to play on the West Coast mainly because of the opportunities presented for his career after football.

==College career==
While attending the University of California, Los Angeles, Mitchell played for the UCLA Bruins football team from 1997 to 2000. He sat out the 1997 season by taking a redshirt and subsequently lengthening his college football eligibility. In his first game, a 49–31 win over Texas on September 12, 1998, Mitchell threw a 34-yard touchdown pass to Brian Poli-Dixon and had four catches for 108 yards and one touchdown pass (79 yards) from quarterback Cade McNown. He had one rushing attempt for 30 yards on a reverse, 78 yards on three kickoff returns, and 17 yards on three punt returns. He was named the Pacific-10 Conference Offensive Player of the Week for his efforts in the game. On September 19, Mitchell had surgery on his left femur after suffering a fracture at the end of a kickoff return in the first quarter of a 42–24 win over Houston the same day. Mitchell was expected to miss the rest of the season. However, after a &quot;remarkable&quot; recovery, according to a member of the UCLA medical staff, Mitchell was able to play for eleven snaps in the Rose Bowl on January 1, 1999. He threw a 61-yard touchdown pass to Durell Price on a flea flicker play in the first quarter of the loss to Wisconsin.

In the summer prior to the 1999 season, Mitchell and Poli-Dixon trained with Minnesota Vikings receivers Randy Moss and Cris Carter in Florida. Mitchell, Poli-Dixon, Danny Farmer, and the rest of the UCLA receiving corps called themselves &quot;The Birds&quot; for their ability to &quot;fly all over the field&quot;. Mitchell was hampered by a knee cartilage issue throughout his redshirt sophomore season. In his first career start, replacing the injured Farmer in the season-opener against Boise State, Mitchell had one catch for 11 yards from Drew Bennett, one kickoff return for 15 yards, and four punt returns for 33 yards. In the next week in a loss against the Ohio State Buckeyes, Mitchell again started in place of Farmer and gained 31 yards on two reverses, had four kickoff returns for 73 yards and completed a pass for 18 yards. In a 35–21 win over Fresno State on September 18, Mitchell, again starting in place of Farmer, caught nine passes for 149 yards, both career-highs. Mitchell caught 10 passes for 103 total yards in the next four games. He led the team in receiving for three consecutive weeks to follow: in his sixth start of the season, a 55–7 blowout loss to Oregon State, he caught five passes for 58 yards; in the Bruins&#x27; third-straight loss, this time to Arizona, he had 42 yards on four receptions; and in a 23–20 win in overtime against Washington, he successfully received four passes for 82 yards, including a 43-yard pass from Ryan McCann. In the final game of the season, against USC, Mitchell caught five passes for 88 yards. He had a total of 38 catches for 533 yards with no touchdowns and six starts in 1999, and finished 15th in the Pac-10 in receptions with 3.5 per game and 17th in receiving yards with 48.5 per game.

Mitchell played baseball for the Bruins in the offseason prior to the 2000 football season. He was teammates with future Philadelphia Phillies second baseman Chase Utley and introduced Utley to his future wife, Jennifer Cooper. Mitchell was drafted in the 2000 Major League Baseball Draft in the 50th round by the Chicago White Sox. Utley said of Mitchell&#x27;s decision not to play baseball professionally, &quot;he chose the right sport in football, that&#x27;s for sure. He was a good batting practice hitter—that&#x27;s about it. He wasn&#x27;t quite the same once the game got going.&quot; The Bruins earned the Pac-10 Conference Championship with Mitchell as a member in 2000.

Mitchell earned preseason first-team All-Pac-10 honors from &quot;The Sporting News&quot; and &quot;Lindy&#x27;s Sports&quot; before the 2000 season as he prepared to take over the starting wide receiver job following Farmer&#x27;s graduation. Mitchell, along with teammate Poli-Dixon, was named to the Fred Biletnikoff Award watchlist for the outstanding receiver in college football during the preseason. In the season-opener against third-ranked Alabama, Mitchell threw a 31-yard touchdown pass to Poli-Dixon on a trick play in the first quarter and made a 46-yard touchdown reception from McCann in the third quarter. He finished the game with four catches for 91 yards in the upset win. In the 24–21 win over Fresno State on September 9, Mitchell led the team in receiving with six receptions for 58 yards and a 20-yard touchdown pass from McCann. Mitchell&#x27;s catches went into the double-digits against third-ranked Michigan, as he had ten receptions for 137 yards in the 23–20 upset win on September 16. On September 23, in the third quarter of a 29–10 loss against Oregon, Mitchell caught what appeared to be a touchdown in the corner of the end zone, but was ruled out-of-bounds by the officials. The Bruins settled for a field goal on the drive and Mitchell explained after the game that &quot;I knew it was a touchdown, you knew it was a touchdown, everybody does. The ref[eree] knew it too because he looked at me like he was sorry.&quot; On the next series, however, Mitchell caught a 54-yard touchdown pass from backup quarterback Bennett. Mitchell finished the game with eight receptions for 158 yards. In a 38–31 comeback win over Arizona State on September 30, he caught two touchdown passes from Cory Paus in the third quarter, one of which was for 80 yards, and had four total catches for 125 yards in the game. On October 14, in a triple-overtime loss to California, Mitchell made eight receptions for 167 yards and caught a 35-yard touchdown from Paus in the fourth quarter.

Mitchell was named to the BCSfootball.com Midseason All-America team after posting 38 receptions for 736 yards and six touchdowns midway through the season. Over the next four games, Mitchell recorded 26 catches for 438 yards, including a seven-catch, 185-yard game against Stanford on November 4. He caught a 41-yard touchdown pass from Paus in the game. In a 38–35 loss to USC on November 18, Mitchell broke Farmer&#x27;s single-season record of 1,274 yards in 1998 with 1,314 yards. He made four receptions for 140 yards and a four-yard touchdown in the game, and threw a 45-yard touchdown pass to Poli-Dixon. Mitchell was named a semi-finalist for the Biletnikoff Award in late October. He was named a finalist for the award in late November alongside Antonio Bryant of Pittsburgh and Marvin Minnis of Florida State, but lost out to Bryant. Mitchell earned first-team All-America honors by the Walter Camp Football Foundation following the season, as well as first-team All-Pac-10 honors. He earned CNNSI.com honorable mention All-America honors. He was named a winner of UCLA&#x27;s Henry R. &quot;Red&quot; Sanders Award for Most Valuable Player, the winner of the George W. Dickerson Award for Outstanding Offensive Player against USC, and a winner of the Team Captain Award at the UCLA football award banquet.

In the 2000 Sun Bowl against Wisconsin on December 29, Mitchell made nine receptions for a Sun Bowl-record 180 yards, including a 64-yard touchdown catch. Though the Bruins lost the game 21–20, Mitchell said Badgers cornerback Jamar Fletcher &quot;couldn&#x27;t stop [him].&quot; Mitchell was called for two taunting penalties on Fletcher, but still won MVP honors following the game. Mitchell finished the season with 77 catches for 1,494 yards and nine touchdowns.

In October 2000, Mitchell told the &quot;Eugene Register-Guard&quot;, a newspaper in Eugene, Oregon, that he was &quot;definitely returning&quot; for his senior season. By mid-November, however, he told the Associated Press that he was &quot;leaning to staying, but nothing&#x27;s firm.&quot; Mitchell instead chose to forgo his senior year and entered the NFL Draft in early January 2001. He stated, &quot;I have had a great time, but it&#x27;s time for me to give something back to my family.&quot; Mitchell said he would be quieter in the NFL: &quot;You won&#x27;t hear no more trash talking from Freddie Mitchell, those are the big boys, I&#x27;m just a little kid again. I&#x27;m humble.&quot; He had 119 catches for 2,135 yards and 10 touchdowns in his career as a Bruin.

==Professional career==

===Pre-draft===
After Mitchell declared for the 2001 NFL draft, one NFL scout told the &quot;Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel&quot; in February, &quot;I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s as fast as people in the press try to say he is. He&#x27;s absolutely fearless over the middle but he prefers to trap the ball instead of to extend for it. I don&#x27;t think he has nearly the explosion to be considered a first.&quot; Mitchell was also criticized by scouts for his small frame and potential character issues. Draft analyst Mel Kiper, Jr. rated Mitchell as the 16th-best prospect in the draft following the NFL Scouting Combine in which he ran a 4.4-second 40-yard dash, and called him a player on the rise. Kiper also rated him as the fifth-best wide receiver in the draft and projected Mitchell to be drafted in the mid-first round following his performance at the Combine. In rating players several times leading up to the draft, Kiper re-watched game film of each player and adjusted their rankings accordingly. In his March 5 mock draft, Kiper projected Mitchell to be drafted by the Green Bay Packers with the tenth overall selection. He ranked Mitchell as the 18th-best player in the draft on March 30. NFLDraftScout.com projected Mitchell to be drafted in the second round and rated him as the eighth-best wide receiver in the draft. Kiper ranked him the fourth-best wide receiver in the draft on April 2. In his April 10 mock draft, Kiper projected Mitchell to be drafted by the Denver Broncos with the 24th overall selection. Ed Bouchette of the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; ranked Mitchell as the sixth-best wide receiver in the draft. Mitchell hired Tom Condon of IMG Football as his agent leading up to the draft.

===Philadelphia Eagles===
====2001 season====
Mitchell was selected by the Philadelphia Eagles in the first round (25th overall) of the 2001 NFL Draft. He was the fifth wide receiver taken in the draft. He worked out with his new quarterback Donovan McNabb in Arizona and Los Angeles before mini-camp started. Because of NCAA rules regarding graduation, Mitchell was unable to attend the Eagles&#x27; mini-camp until after UCLA&#x27;s senior class graduated. He studied the Eagles&#x27; playbook in the meantime. He asked the NFL for an exemption, but the league refused, and he arrived for his first practice on June 18, 2001. Mitchell signed a five-year, $5.5 million contract with the Eagles on July 26, in time for the start of training camp. During training camp, Mitchell practiced as a backup behind James Thrash and Todd Pinkston. Special teams coordinator John Harbaugh asked Mitchell if he was willing to practice as a kickoff returner in practice, but Mitchell declined, citing the fracture of his femur on a kickoff return in college. Nonetheless, he still practiced on the kickoff coverage team, and on the punt coverage team as a gunner. Mitchell suffered a hip pointer during the morning session on July 31, but returned for the afternoon session without limitation. A hamstring injury limited him at the end of training camp. Before the start of the 2001 season, head coach Andy Reid said, &quot;Mentally, [Mitchell is] right there. He&#x27;s picked everything up, he&#x27;s a smart kid. He&#x27;s wide-eyed, ready to learn. He&#x27;s done a nice job when he&#x27;s been in there.&quot;

Mitchell began the season as the team&#x27;s fourth wide receiver behind Thrash, Pinkston, and Na Brown. Mitchell&#x27;s difficulty in learning the complex playbook, as well as the lingering hamstring injury, limited him in the Eagles&#x27; first six games of the season. In his first career NFL game, a week one matchup against the St. Louis Rams on September 9, Mitchell played in a few snaps but was not thrown to. Mitchell was listed as &quot;questionable&quot; due to his hamstring injury before the start of the week two game against the Seattle Seahawks on September 23, and was not activated. Against the Dallas Cowboys in week three on September 30, Mitchell returned to the field and caught his first pass, which went for no gain. In weeks four and six, against the Arizona Cardinals and New York Giants, respectively, Mitchell recorded no catches. In week seven against the Oakland Raiders, he made a catch for 15 yards.

Due to Brown&#x27;s ineffective play, Mitchell replaced him as the Eagles&#x27; slot receiver in week eight against the Cardinals and had four receptions for 62 yards. In a week nine game against the Minnesota Vikings on November 11, Mitchell caught three passes for 38 yards and had one rushing attempt for 12 yards. He caught two passes for 15 yards and had one rush for a loss of 16 yards in week ten against the Cowboys. Mitchell was listed as &quot;probable&quot; on the team&#x27;s injury report due to a shoulder injury before a week eleven game against the Washington Redskins, but did not record any catches in the game. He made three receptions for 60 yards in a week twelve win over the Kansas City Chiefs on November 29, and Reid said, &quot;Every week we&#x27;re giving Freddie a little bit more responsibility and he&#x27;s coming along very well right now.&quot; In a week thirteen game against the San Diego Chargers, Mitchell caught one pass for five yards and attempted a pass off of a reverse that was knocked down. Against Washington in week 14, Mitchell caught his first career touchdown pass, a four-yard reception in the second quarter. He had two catches for 27 yards in the game. Mitchell caught two passes in each of the next two games for a total of 61 yards.

Mitchell made his first two career starts in week seventeen and in a wild card playoff game win against the Buccaneers. He did not record any receptions in either game. Against the Chicago Bears in a divisional playoff game win on January 19, Mitchell caught two passes for 14 yards. In the NFC Championship Game against the Rams on January 27, Mitchell caught one pass for two yards. A pass intended for him on a fourth-down play was intercepted by Rams defensive back Aeneas Williams to clinch the win for St. Louis. Mitchell finished the season with 21 receptions for 283 yards and one touchdown.

====2002 season====
After the Eagles signed Antonio Freeman to a one-year contract in August 2002, Mitchell was demoted to the fourth wide receiver behind Pinkston, Thrash, and Freeman. Mitchell mainly contributed on special teams for the Eagles throughout the 2002 season. In the first fifteen weeks of the season, Mitchell caught a total of six passes for 53 yards as a backup. Against the Cowboys in week sixteen, Pinkston left the game due to turf toe, and Mitchell caught two passes for 17 yards in his place. Mitchell started in place of Pinkston in the last regular season game against the Giants on December 28, and led the team in receiving with four catches for 35 yards.

Mitchell only caught twelve passes for 105 yards over the entire season. It was after this dismal performance, despite having the benefit of Pro Bowl quarterback Donovan McNabb passing to him, that Mitchell began to be labeled as a &quot;bust.&quot;

====2003 season====
Mitchell competed with rookie Billy McMullen for the third wide receiver position in 2003 after Freeman left the Eagles following the 2002 season. He eventually beat out McMullen for the slot receiver job. Eagles staff, players, and media called Mitchell one of the most improved players in training camp. Donovan McNabb commented that Mitchell&#x27;s &quot;offseason workouts as well as his mindset has been a whole lot different&quot;.

In the first four weeks of the season, Mitchell caught six passes for 55 yards. Mitchell had one catch for 29 yards against the Redskins on October 5, and he recovered a Redskins onside kick to clinch the win for the Eagles. He had one reception for 27 yards in a game against the Cowboys in week six. Mitchell started in week seven in place of Pinkston against the Giants but recorded no catches. Against the New York Jets in week eight, he had two catches for 29 yards. In week nine against the Atlanta Falcons, Mitchell caught a 37-yard touchdown pass from McNabb and finished with two catches for 43 yards. He made seven receptions in the next two games for 83 yards. Against the New Orleans Saints in week twelve, Mitchell started and made two receptions for 24 yards. In weeks thirteen and fourteen, he had a combined six catches for 98 yards. On December 15, in a week fifteen game against the Miami Dolphins, Mitchell threw his first touchdown pass, a 25-yard pass to Brian Westbrook, and caught two passes for 30 yards in the 34–27 win. Against the San Francisco 49ers in week sixteen on December 21, Mitchell made two catches for 23 yards and caught an eight-yard touchdown pass in the second quarter of a week seventeen game against the Redskins on December 27. He had four catches for 47 yards in the game.

Mitchell&#x27;s most significant play, according to Philadelphia media and fans, came on January 11, 2004, in the NFC Divisional Playoff Game against the Packers. Late in the game, with the Eagles losing by three points and facing a 4th and 26 situation, Mitchell caught a 28-yard pass for a first down. The Eagles tied the score on the same drive and won the game in overtime. Mitchell had another catch for nine yards in the game. In the NFC Championship Game on January 18 against the Carolina Panthers, he caught four passes for 38 yards in the loss. Mitchell had 35 catches for 498 yards and two touchdowns in 2003.

====2004 season====

With the Eagles&#x27; acquisition of wide receiver Terrell Owens and the departure of Thrash, Mitchell kept his role as the slot receiver in 2004. Peter King said Mitchell had &quot;a great training camp&quot; and that he &quot;might be having the best camp of any player I&#x27;ve seen this summer.&quot; He made seven receptions in the first four weeks of the season for a total of 118 yards receiving, including three catches for 71 yards against the Detroit Lions in week three. He started against the Panthers on October 17 in week six but did not record any catches. In the following three weeks, Mitchell only had two receptions for 31 yards, with both catches coming against the Cleveland Browns in week seven. His most notable catch of the season was a 60-yard reception during the Eagles&#x27; November 15, 2004, &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; game against the Cowboys. This catch is remembered primarily for the manner in which McNabb extended the play by eluding the Cowboys&#x27; pass rush for 14.1 seconds before eventually throwing to Mitchell. Over the subsequent four weeks, Mitchell had one reception in each game for a combined 54 yards. He began to openly voice his frustration over the limited role he continued to play in the Eagles&#x27; offense due to Owens&#x27; prominence. At one point during the season, after he made a catch, Mitchell would point to his wrist as if to say &quot;it&#x27;s about time.&quot; In a week fifteen game against the Cowboys, Owens suffered an ankle injury and was expected to miss the remainder of the season. Mitchell, who suffered a quad contusion during the game, did not make a catch against Dallas, but was named the starter in Owens&#x27; place opposite Pinkston. Against the Rams in week sixteen, Mitchell caught a seven-yard touchdown pass from McNabb in the first quarter and finished the game with two receptions for 28 yards. In the final game of the regular season against the Cincinnati Bengals, Mitchell had six receptions for 76 yards and a touchdown. He finished the season with only 22 catches.

In a divisional playoff game against the Vikings on January 16, 2005, Mitchell caught a two-yard touchdown pass in the first quarter and celebrated by feigning to pull his pants up, a reference to the touchdown celebration by Vikings&#x27; wide receiver Randy Moss, who pretended to pull his pants down to moon Green Bay fans the week before and was heavily criticized for doing so. Mitchell recovered an L. J. Smith fumble in the endzone for a touchdown in the second quarter, and finished the game with a team-high five receptions for 65 yards. In a press conference after the game, Mitchell said, &quot;I just want to thank my hands for being so great.&quot; He had two receptions for 20 yards against the Atlanta Falcons in the NFC Championship Game on January 23. In the game, Mitchell sported a well-publicized frohawk.

=====Super Bowl controversy=====
The Eagles finished the 2004 season with a 13–3 record and earned a trip to Super Bowl XXXIX, where they were to play the AFC champion New England Patriots. During the week leading up to the game, Mitchell sat for a short ESPN interview conducted by Dan Patrick. Asked to identify the members of the Patriots&#x27; secondary, Mitchell claimed he did not know them by name, only by number, and then deliberately stated each of their numbers incorrectly. Finally, he said he &quot;had something&quot; for safety Rodney Harrison. Harrison responded by calling Mitchell a &quot;jerk&quot;. The normally tight-lipped Patriots head coach Bill Belichick later said of Mitchell, &quot;[a]ll he does is talk. He&#x27;s terrible, and you can print that. I was happy when he was in the game.&quot; Mitchell caught only one pass for 11 yards in the 24–21 loss. After the Super Bowl, Mitchell continued to criticize the Patriots, as well as Belichick, saying that the way the Patriots reacted reminded him of &quot;little girls&quot;.

===Later career===
Mitchell held out from the Eagles&#x27; mini-camp in late April 2005, with Andy Reid stating, &quot;I did not want him here.&quot; Mitchell was released from the team on May 6. He finished his career with the Eagles with 90 receptions for 1,263 yards and five touchdowns.

Mitchell worked out for the Kansas City Chiefs on June 6, 2005, following his release from the Eagles. He signed with the Chiefs on June 17 after Az-Zahir Hakim decided against signing with the team. Mitchell did not receive a signing bonus. He began practicing with the team on the last day of mini-camps, June 18, and received extra practice with the coaches the following week. He suffered a knee injury during practice on July 30 and was scheduled to undergo arthroscopic surgery the following week, but declined to go through with it. He was released on September 2 due to concerns about his knee. Mitchell elected to have knee surgery on September 6 following his release.

Mitchell worked out for several teams after his release from the Chiefs, but did not sign a contract with any of them. He worked out for the Green Bay Packers on October 25, 2005, the Dallas Cowboys on August 6, 2006, the Cleveland Browns on October 11, 2006, the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League on February 11, 2007, the Tennessee Titans on July 26, 2007, and the Baltimore Ravens on May 29, 2008. The Philadelphia Soul of the Arena Football League expressed interest in signing Mitchell in January 2006, but president Ron Jaworski, a former Eagles quarterback, had difficulties contacting him.

==NFL career statistics==


==Personal==

Mitchell&#x27;s first cousin is former running back Rod Smart, who played on the Eagles with Mitchell in 2001. Mitchell enjoys country music. Mitchell had several nicknames during his tenure in Philadelphia. These included &quot;Fast Freddie,&quot; the &quot;Sultan of Slot,&quot; &quot;First Down Freddie,&quot; &quot;FredEx&quot; (claiming he &quot;always delivers&quot;), the &quot;People&#x27;s Champ,&quot; and &quot;Hollywood.&quot; While with the Eagles, Mitchell was a resident of Moorestown, New Jersey.

Mitchell appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; while on UCLA&#x27;s campus, deliberately answering questions incorrectly. He appeared on &quot;A Dating Story&quot;, a reality television show, in May 2002. In the episode, Mitchell took Tiffany Schmid, a model in the Philadelphia area, to Great Adventure Amusement Park for their date. Mitchell, as well as several other NFL players, received threatening hate mail in 2003, apparently due to his appearance on the reality show with Schmid as a mixed-race couple at the time. In January 2011, Mitchell appeared on Bravo&#x27;s &quot;The Millionaire Matchmaker&quot;, a dating show in which Patti Stanger sets millionaires up to find love. Mitchell&#x27;s fiancée left him after Super Bowl XXXIX in February 2005 after they had been together for two years.

In 2008, Mitchell returned to Lakeland and bought a local barbecue restaurant called &quot;Brothers&#x27; Bar-B-Que.&quot; In February 2009, Mitchell was under investigation when a package containing of marijuana was delivered to his business. Mitchell was briefly detained, but was not charged. The restaurant was closed briefly in June for violations, but reopened shortly thereafter. On September 3, 2009, the restaurant was closed and Mitchell was named in a suit for failure to make payments on the business. Mitchell officially lost the restaurant in September 2009 after a court ruling. In December 2009, Mitchell was pulled over for speeding in suburban Philadelphia. Due to an outstanding warrant for failure to pay child support, he was arrested on charges of being a fugitive from justice, and was later released on $250,000 bail.
Mitchell turned himself in to authorities on March 12, 2012, after being indicted on federal tax fraud charges. He was arraigned on March 22 on the charges, and a warrant for his arrest in Indiana for failure to pay child support led to his incarceration in Orange County, Florida. In May 2012, Mitchell filed a lawsuit against a married couple, who were defendants in his previous charges, citing fraud, breach of contract, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Mitchell pleaded guilty on March 8, 2013, to one count of conspiring to file a false tax claim with the federal government. At a hearing on October 24, 2013, in Orlando, Florida, he claimed that his crime stemmed from concussions he suffered during his career in the NFL, adding that he had headaches, insomnia, and memory loss. That memory loss was cited as a possible reason for his failing to pay child support in that case as well. His attorneys asked the judge in the case that Mitchell only be sentenced to community service and probation. On October 29, 2013, he was sentenced to serve 37 months in prison. He began his sentence on December 6, 2013.

On May 4, 2012, Mitchell participated in a charity golfing event to benefit the Palm Beach State College Foundation. He rang the ceremonial Liberty Bell in Philadelphia before the start of a National Basketball Association game between the Philadelphia 76ers and Toronto Raptors on December 22, 2018.

In September 2021, Mitchell was affected by Hurricane Ida, after his home was flooded.

<doc id="1339145" wikidata="Q7733165" url="?curid=1339145" title="The Falcon (fictional detective)">
<text>The Falcon is the nickname for two fictional detectives. Drexel Drake (real name Charles H. Huff) created Michael Waring, alias the Falcon, a freelance investigator and troubleshooter, in his 1936 novel, &quot;The Falcon&#x27;s Prey&quot;. It was followed by two more novels – &quot;The Falcon Cuts In&quot;, 1937, and &quot;The Falcon Meets a Lady&quot;, 1938 – and a 1938 short story. Michael Arlen created Gay Stanhope Falcon in 1940. This Falcon made his first appearance in Arlen&#x27;s short story &quot;Gay Falcon&quot; (aka &quot;A Man Called Falcon&quot;), which was originally published in 1940 in &quot;Town &amp; Country&quot; magazine. The story opens with the words &quot;Now of this man who called himself Gay Falcon many tales are told, and this is one of them.&quot; Arlen&#x27;s Falcon is characterized as a freelance adventurer and troubleshooter – a man who makes his living &quot;keeping his mouth shut and engaging in dangerous enterprises.&quot;

==Film appearances ==
Arlen&#x27;s Falcon was quickly brought to the screen by RKO Radio Pictures. The 1941 film &quot;The Gay Falcon&quot; redefined the character as a suave English gentleman detective with a weakness for beautiful women. Though Gay Falcon was the character&#x27;s name in Arlen&#x27;s original story, the character was renamed Gay Laurence for the film. (The surname was spelled &quot;Lawrence&quot; in subsequent films.) Thus &quot;The Falcon&quot; became an alias or nickname, à la &quot;The Saint.&quot; In later outings, in various media, the character had a variety of &quot;real names,&quot; still being known as The Falcon. Neither in films nor on radio was the nickname ever explained. 

&quot;The Gay Falcon&quot; was intended to establish a replacement character for Leslie Charteris&#x27;s The Saint (Simon Templar), who had appeared in a popular RKO film series. To that end, George Sanders, star of &quot;The Saint&quot; series, was cast in the Falcon role, with &quot;Saint&quot; love interest Wendy Barrie continuing opposite Sanders. In the Falcon movies, as in the Leslie Charteris &quot;Saint&quot; novels of the period, the hero is almost always accompanied in his travels by a wisecracking sidekick, portrayed variously by Allen Jenkins (in the first three Falcon films), Don Barclay, Cliff Edwards, Edward Brophy, and Vince Barnett. 

The new Falcon films followed the &quot;Saint&quot; pattern so closely that author Charteris sued RKO, charging unfair competition. Charteris told author David Zinman in 1971, &quot;RKO switched to The Falcon, a flagrant carbon copy of their version of The Saint, in my opinion with the single mercenary motive of saving the payments they had to make to me for the film rights.&quot; Charteris actually pokes fun at The Falcon in his 1943 novel &quot;The Saint Steps In&quot;, with a character making a metafictional reference to the Falcon being &quot;a bargain-basement imitation&quot; of The Saint.

George Sanders appeared in the first four Falcon features. When Sanders tired of B leads, he bowed out of the series in &quot;The Falcon&#x27;s Brother&quot; (1942). In the film, Gay Lawrence is killed by assassins, prompting his brother Tom, played by Sanders&#x27;s actual older brother, Tom Conway, to become the new Falcon. Producer Maurice Geraghty later revealed that RKO executives had recruited Conway simply as a way to induce Sanders to make one more Falcon picture, after which the series would end. &quot;So it was astonishing to them when Tom Conway caught on right away and carried the series on – even outgrossing the pictures George had made.&quot; After &quot;The Falcon&#x27;s Brother&quot;, Conway starred in nine more Falcon films through 1946. 

As with other series of B mystery films, the plot of a Falcon movie generally revolved around a particular locale that the detective was visiting. An oft-used gimmick in the Falcon series was to tack &quot;teaser&quot; epilogues onto the ends of films. In each teaser, a previously unseen woman would approach the Falcon, usually in desperation, and signal the title and locale of his next movie. A teaser rarely had anything to do with the plot of the upcoming film, since that film had not yet been produced. 

The Falcon was revived for three more films, all made in 1948, but these featured the earlier &quot;Michael Waring&quot; character as created by Drexel Drake. However, he was referred to as &quot;Watling&quot; and the credits still claimed he was based on a character created by Michael Arlen. Actor-magician John Calvert played &quot;The New Falcon&quot; in three low-budget features produced by Film Classics. The character went on to appear (as Michael Waring) in radio and television – Charles McGraw portrayed the Falcon in the 39-episode syndicated television series &quot;Adventures of the Falcon&quot; (1954–55).

<doc id="1339152" wikidata="Q272127" url="?curid=1339152" title="1952 Atlantic hurricane season">
<text>The 1952 Atlantic hurricane season was the last Atlantic hurricane season in which tropical cyclones were named using the Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet. It was a near normal Atlantic hurricane season, although it was the least active since 1946. The season officially started on June 15; however, a pre-season unnamed storm formed on Groundhog Day, becoming the only storm on record in the month of February. The other six tropical cyclones were named using the Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet, the first of which formed on August 18. The final storm of the season dissipated on October 28, two and a half weeks before the season officially ended on November 15.

Four of the tropical cyclones made landfall during the season, the first being the February tropical storm that crossed southern Florida. The first hurricane, named Able, struck South Carolina with winds of , causing heavy damage near the coast and widespread power outages. It moved up most of the East Coast of the United States, leaving 3 deaths and widespread damage. As a developing tropical cyclone, Hurricane Charlie caused damaging flooding and landslides in southwest Puerto Rico. The final and strongest of the season, Hurricane Fox, struck Cuba with winds of ; it killed 600 people and left heavy damage, particularly to the sugar crop, reaching $10 million (1952 USD, $  USD).

== Timeline ==


== Systems ==
=== Tropical Storm One ===
On February 2, a non-frontal low formed in the western Caribbean Sea two months after the end of the hurricane season. It moved quickly north-northwestward and acquired gale-force winds as it brushed the northern coast of Cuba. Early on February 3, the storm struck Cape Sable, Florida and quickly crossed the state. The Miami National Weather Service office recorded a wind gust of during its passage. The winds damaged windows and power lines, catching residents and tourists off-guard. The cyclone also dropped of precipitation along its path, causing crop damage in Miami-Dade County.

After leaving Florida, the storm briefly transitioned into a tropical storm on February 3, the only tropical or subtropical storm on record in the month. The storm continued rapidly northeastward, reaching peak winds of . On February 4 it evolved into an extratropical cyclone off the coast of North Carolina. Later that day, it passed over Cape Cod, and early on February 5 dissipated after crossing into Maine. The storm caused scattered power outages and gusty winds across New England.
=== Hurricane Able ===
Over six months after the previous storm dissipated, a tropical depression developed just off the west coast of Africa on August 18. It moved generally west- to west-northwestward for much of its duration, intensifying into a tropical storm on August 24 east of the Lesser Antilles. The next day, Hurricane Hunters confirmed the presence of Tropical Storm Able. Passing north of the islands, the storm attained hurricane status on August 27. On August 30, Able turned to the north-northwest due to an approaching cold front, and the next day made landfall near Beaufort, South Carolina as a Category 2 hurricane with peak winds of . The town was heavily damaged, and was briefly isolated after winds downed power and telephone lines. Across South Carolina, the hurricane caused two indirect deaths, as well as moderate damage totaling $2.2 million (1952 USD, $  USD).

As Able turned north and northeastward over land, the winds quickly weakened to tropical storm force, although it retained gale-force winds through North Carolina, Virginia, and Maryland; this was due to remaining over the flat terrain east of the Appalachian Mountains, as well as retaining a plume of tropical moisture from its south. It left light damage in North Carolina, some of it due to a tornado. In Maryland, heavy rainfall caused widespread flooding, which washed out the tracks of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad near Baltimore. In Ellicott City, Maryland, the rains flooded several houses, forcing families to evacuate. Two tornadoes were also reported in the region, and damage in the Washington, D.C. area reached $500,000 (1952 USD, $  USD). Further northeast, the storm continued to produce heavy rainfall, causing flooding, as well as one indirect death in Pennsylvania. After moving through New England, Able dissipated on September 2 near Portland, Maine.
=== Tropical Storm Three ===

A cold front was located north of the Bahamas on August 26, with a broad area of cyclonic turning located east of northern Florida. Atmospheric pressures were falling in the region, and gale-force winds were recorded by 12:00 UTC on August 27. Based on the structure, it is estimated that the frontal low developed into a tropical storm by 18:00 UTC that day. Ship reports in the region suggested peak winds of . There was very dry air on the west side of the system, unusual for August, and the radius of maximum winds was around , suggesting that the structure could have been akin to a subtropical cyclone. The storm continued to the northwest, making landfall very near Myrtle Beach, South Carolina at 02:00 UTC on August 28. It spread rainfall across the Carolinas, later enhanced by Hurricane Able just days later, while cities reported winds of around . The storm weakened over land and dissipated late on August 28 over eastern Kentucky.
=== Hurricane Baker ===

The third tropical cyclone of the season developed on August 31 a short distance east of the northern Lesser Antilles. Its presence was reported by a ship the next day that encountered rough seas and gale-force winds. As a result, the Weather Bureau sent the Hurricane Hunters to investigate the system, which reported a strengthening hurricane moving northwestward. Given the name Baker, the hurricane passed north of the Lesser Antilles, reaching peak winds of late on September 3. For several days, the Hurricane Hunters reported similar winds, along with gusts up to .

With a large anticyclone located over the Ohio Valley, Baker turned to the northeast on September 5, passing about halfway between Bermuda and North Carolina. The hurricane slowly weakened as it moved through the north Atlantic Ocean, just missing Newfoundland while maintaining winds of . Wind gusts on Avalon Peninsula reached , and heavy fishing damage was reported in Lower Island Cove. After affecting the island, Baker transitioned into an extratropical storm, which lasted another day before dissipating south of Greenland.
=== Tropical Storm Five ===

A dissipating cold front stalled across the northeastern Atlantic Ocean on September 7, northeast of the Azores. That day, a closed circulation developed and quickly became independent of the front. Based on a uniform thermal structure, as well as ship reports in the region of gale-force winds near the center, it is estimated that the system became a tropical storm early on September 8. Forming at a latitude of 42.0°N, this system is notable for being the northernmost forming tropical cyclone in the Atlantic hurricane database, dating back to 1851.

The system moved west-southwestward, atypical for cyclones in that region during September. On September 9, the storm turned to the southeast, reaching estimated peak winds of , based on ship observations. Moving slowly through the northern Azores, the storm produced winds of along Terceira Island. It slowly weakened, and by late on September 10 the system degraded into a tropical depression. By the next day, the system was interacting with an approaching cold front, indicating that the depression had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. Around 20:00 UTC, the storm moved ashore the southwestern tip of Portugal with gale-force winds. The storm turned to the northeast through the Iberian Peninsula, dissipating on September 14 over southwestern France.
=== Hurricane Charlie ===

On September 22, a tropical wave moved into the eastern Caribbean Sea, spawning a tropical depression near Hispaniola early on September 24. As it tracked west-northwestward, the low dropped heavy rainfall, peaking at in Christiansted, United States Virgin Islands, as well as in Garzas, Puerto Rico. In Puerto Rico, the rains caused landslides that affected seven towns, notably Ponce, the island&#x27;s second-largest city. There, at least 14 buildings were destroyed. The floods left more than 1,000 people homeless, 300 of whom took refuge in a Red Cross shelter. Overall, the flooding on the island killed four people and left moderate damage of around $1 million (1952 USD, $  USD).

After affecting Puerto Rico, the low continued to organize, and subsequently struck the Dominican Republic on September 23. The circulation became disrupted while crossing Hispaniola, although it reorganized near the Turks and Caicos Islands and became Tropical Storm Charlie before reaching those islands. On September 25, Charlie attained hurricane status, and due to its continued northwest motion, the Weather Bureau advised small craft to remain at port in the southeastern United States coast. However, the hurricane turned to the north and northeast on September 26, during which the Hurricane Hunters recorded peak winds of . It briefly threatened Bermuda, prompting the United States Air Force to evacuate its fleet of airplanes from Kindley Air Force Base. Charlie ultimately northwest of Bermuda, and later began weakening. On September 29 it turned eastward, and later that day transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. The remnants lasted two more days before dissipating southeast of Newfoundland.
=== Tropical Storm Dog ===

On September 18, a tropical wave exited the west coast of Africa, which spawned a tropical cyclone east of the Lesser Antilles on September 24. The system quickly intensified and was given the name &quot;Dog&quot;. The storm moved northwestward for its entire duration. On September 26, Hurricane Hunters observed winds of , with gusts to , although they were unable to locate a closed center of circulation. Operationally, Dog was upgraded to hurricane status, but a reanalysis in 2015 downgraded the storm to a peak intensity of , making it a strong tropical storm. Dog began weakening on September 27, and over the next few days the circulation lost its definition. On September 29, Dog weakened to a tropical depression, and dissipated the next day. The Weather Bureau advised ships to avoid the storm, but overall Dog did not affect land.

=== Tropical Storm Eight ===

On September 24, a tropical wave moved off the west coast of Africa. It is estimated that a closed circulation developed on the next day, suggesting the formation of a tropical depression. On September 26, the Cape Verdean island of Santiago recorded winds of as the system was passing to the southwest. A minimum pressure of and ship reports of winds indicate that the system reached peak winds of , or a minimal tropical storm. It turned to the north on September 27 and likely weakened, although observations were sparse. By September 30, the system lost its circulation and degenerated into an open trough.
=== Hurricane Easy ===

On October 6, a tropical depression formed about east of Antigua, near where Tropical Storm Dog developed a week prior. The depression proceeded northward, and was detected by the Hurricane Hunters on October 7 as a strengthening tropical storm. On that basis, the storm was named &quot;Easy&quot;. On October 8, the Hurricane Hunters observed a eye and wind gusts to . On that basis, Easy was upgraded to a hurricane with peak winds of . By that time, the hurricane had turned sharply to the east, and later began to move toward the south. As quickly as it strengthened, Easy began to weaken, and an aircraft reported winds of only on October 9. The storm headed southwest, ultimately dissipating on October 11 about southwest of where it formed. Easy never affected land.
=== Hurricane Fox ===
The strongest tropical cyclone of the season formed on October 20 in the Caribbean Sea off the northwest coast of Colombia, believed to have been from the Intertropical Convergence Zone. It moved northwestward, intensifying into a tropical storm on October 21 and a hurricane the following day. Fox subsequently turned to the north, intensifying to a major hurricane as it passed west of the Cayman Islands. Late on October 24, the cyclone struck the small island of Cayo Guano del Estes in the Archipelago de los Canarreos, south of Cienfuegos, Cuba. It struck the island with peak winds of , and the island reported a minimum pressure of . Shortly thereafter, Fox crossed the mainland coast of Cuba west of Cienfuegos, and it weakened while crossing the island.

Hurricane Fox crossed Cuba in a rural area dominated by sugar plantations, with heavy damage reported to 36 mills. In one town, the hurricane destroyed about 600 homes and damaged over 1,000 more. Across the island, the strongest winds downed large trees and washed a large freighter ashore. Heavy rainfall affected all but the extreme eastern and western end of the island, with a peak of near Havana. The rains flooded low-lying areas and caused rivers to exceed their banks. Throughout Cuba, Hurricane Fox killed 600 people, and left behind heavy damage totaling $10 million (1952 USD, $  USD). Fox was among the strongest hurricanes to strike the country.

After crossing Cuba, Fox emerged into the Atlantic Ocean with winds of , crossing central Andros and turning eastward though the Bahamas. On New Providence, the hurricane dropped of rainfall, Strong winds caused severe crop damage, leaving 30% of the tomato crop destroyed. After briefly restrengthening to a major hurricane, Fox began a steady weakening trend. It turned abruptly to the north-northwest, followed by another turn to the northeast. On October 28, Fox was absorbed by a cold front west-southwest of Bermuda.
=== Tropical Storm Eleven ===

A cold front stalled north of the Virgin Islands on November 23, spawning an extratropical storm the next day. The system strengthened while moving northward, attaining gale-force winds on November 25. It was a large system, and a ship in the vicinity reported a pressure of . The observation, within a warm environment and in concurrence with gale-force winds, suggested that the system became a tropical storm on November 26, although the system likely was a subtropical cyclone due to the structure. Turning to the west-northwest along a dissipating cold front, the storm reached peak winds of on November 27. Another front in the region steered the storm to the south and east in a counterclockwise circle. Weakening slightly, the system briefly transitioned into an extratropical storm on November 30 before dissipating later that day within the front.

<text>Samuel Morris Steward (July 23, 1909 – December 31, 1993), also known as Phil Andros, Phil Sparrow, was an American tattoo artist and pornographer.

Throughout his life, he kept extensive secret diaries, journals and statistics of his sex life. He lived most of his adult life in Chicago, where he tattooed sailor-trainees from the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Great Lakes Naval Training Station (as well as gang members and street people) out of a tattoo parlor on South State Street. He later moved to the San Francisco Bay area, where he spent the late 1960s as the official tattoo artist of the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club.

==Life and career==
Steward was born in Woodsfield, Ohio, and began attending Ohio State University in Columbus in 1927.

=== Teaching and writing ===
He taught English at OSU from 1932 until 1934 as a university fellow. His first year-long post was as an instructor of English in 1934 at Carroll College in Helena, Montana. In 1936 he was summarily dismissed from his second teaching position, at the State College of Washington (now Washington State University) at Pullman, as the result of his sympathetic portrayal of a prostitute in his well-reviewed comic novel &quot;Angels on the Bough&quot;. He subsequently moved to Chicago, where he taught at Loyola University until 1946. After leaving Loyola to help re-write the &quot;World Book Encyclopedia&quot;, he subsequently taught at DePaul University.

Born into a Methodist household, Steward converted to Catholicism during his university years, but had long since abandoned the Catholic Church by the time he accepted his teaching position at Loyola. From the mid-1930s until 1949 he was deeply alcoholic, but he managed to overcome his addiction to alcohol with the help of Alcoholics Anonymous.

Steward gained an introduction to Gertrude Stein in 1932 through his academic advisor Clarence Andrews, and so began a long correspondence with Stein which resulted in a warm friendship. He paid visits to her rented country home in France during the summers of 1937 and 1939. During the 1937 trip, he also met with many other literary figures, including Thornton Wilder, Lord Alfred Douglas (the lover of Oscar Wilde), Thomas Mann, and André Gide. He detailed these encounters, some of them sexual, in his brief memoir, &quot;Chapters from an Autobiography&quot;. He also described his friendship with Stein and Alice B. Toklas in his &quot;Dear Sammy: Letters from Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas&quot;.

=== Collaborations with Kinsey and others ===
Steward met sex researcher Alfred Kinsey in late 1949 and subsequently became an unofficial collaborator with Kinsey&#x27;s Institute for Sex Research. During his years of work with the Institute, Steward collected and donated sexually themed materials to the Kinsey archive, gave Kinsey access to his lifelong sexual records, introduced him to large numbers of sexually active men in the Chicago area, and provided him with large numbers of early Polaroid sex photographs which he took during the frequent all-male sex parties he held in his Chicago apartment. He also allowed Kinsey to take detailed photographs of that sexually-themed apartment. He ultimately donated large numbers of drawings, paintings and decorative objects that he himself had created to the Institute.

In spring of 1950, at Kinsey&#x27;s invitation, he was filmed engaging in BDSM sex with Mike Miksche, a New York-based erotic artist also known as Steve Masters. After Gertrude Stein, Kinsey was Steward&#x27;s most important mentor; he later described Kinsey not only &quot;as approachable as a park bench&quot; but also as a god-like bringer of enlightenment to humankind, thus giving him the nickname, &quot;Doctor Prometheus.&quot;

While making the transition from professor to tattoo artist during the 1950s, Steward befriended a number of gay artists and writers including Paul Cadmus, George Platt Lynes, Julien Green, Fritz Peters, and Glenway Wescott. At Kinsey&#x27;s specific request he also kept highly detailed journals and diaries of his daily sexual activities, and chronicled them in a secret card catalogue he referred to as his &quot;Stud File.&quot; Starting in 1957, he began contributing short stories based on his many sexual encounters to the Zürich-based homophile magazine &quot;Der Kreis&quot; (&quot;The Circle&quot;), to which he also contributed essays, reviews, and homophile journalism.

During his final years in Chicago, Steward befriended Chuck Renslow, co-owner of Kris Studio, and Renslow&#x27;s partner Dom Orejudos, the homoerotic illustrator also known as &quot;Stephen&quot; and &quot;Etienne.&quot; Renslow and Orejudos would later go on to open the Gold Coast, Chicago&#x27;s first leather bar, and to found International Mr. Leather, a yearly gathering of leathermen from around the world.

=== Pornography work ===
In the 1960s Steward began writing and publishing his erotica under the name of Phil Andros, initially doing so with the Danish magazine &quot;Eos/Amigo&quot;. Some of his early works described his fascination with rough trade and sadomasochistic sex; others focused on the power dynamics of interracial sexual encounters between men. In 1966, thanks to changes in American publishing laws, he was able to publish his story collection &quot;$TUD&quot; with Guild Press in the United States, under the pseudonym Phil Andros. By the late 1960s, Steward started writing a series of pulp pornographic novels featuring the hustler Phil Andros as narrator.

=== Tattooing ===
As a leading tattoo artist of the 1950s and &#x27;60s, Steward was mentored by Milwaukee-based master tattooist Amund Dietzel. Steward in turn mentored Cliff Ingram, aka Cliff Raven, and Don &quot;Ed&quot; Hardy, later known simply as Ed Hardy, encouraging both to practice the Japanese-style tattooing he himself most admired. Chuck Arnett was one of Steward&#x27;s tattoo clients. After retiring from tattooing in 1970, Steward wrote a social history of American tattooing during the 1950s and &#x27;60s, which was ultimately published as &quot;Bad Boys and Tough Tattoos&quot;.

==Death==
In his later years Steward&#x27;s abilities as a writer were compromised by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and a barbiturate addiction. He died at the age of 84 in Berkeley, California.

==Reception and scholarship==

In 1972, Jack Fritscher became the first openly gay writer to unearth and interview Steward; his Steward audiotapes were referenced in Justin Spring&#x27;s biography of Steward. The Leather Archives &amp; Museum in Chicago holds recordings of several interviews Steward sat for in the 1980s and 90s, as well as some of Steward&#x27;s writings, art, and stencils.

Starting in 2001, Justin Spring tracked down Steward&#x27;s archive and began writing the biography &quot;Secret Historian: The Life and Times of Samuel Steward, Professor, Tattoo Artist, and Sexual Renegade&quot;, which was ultimately published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux in 2010. The book was a finalist for the National Book Award. It received the National Leather Association’s Geoff Mains Non-fiction book award for 2011.

In 2018, Jeremy Mulderig edited &quot;The Lost Autobiography of Samuel Steward: Recollections of an Extraordinary Twentieth-Century Gay Life&quot;. (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 2018.)

In 2012, 2014, and 2018, Seth Eisen of Eye Zen Presents created the play &quot;Homo File&quot; depicting the life and times of Steward, as part of a project to unearth and spread gay history from when homosexuality &quot;could not speak its name&quot;.

==Honors==

In 2012 Steward was inducted into the Leather Hall of Fame.

Steward was honored in 2017 along with other notables, named on bronze bootprints, as part of San Francisco South of Market Leather History Alley.

<doc id="1339188" wikidata="Q941944" url="?curid=1339188" title="Popeye (film)">
<text>Popeye is a 1980 American musical comedy film directed by Robert Altman and produced by Paramount Pictures and Walt Disney Productions. It is based on E. C. Segar&#x27;s Popeye comics character. The script was written by Jules Feiffer, and stars Robin Williams as Popeye the Sailor Man and Shelley Duvall as Olive Oyl. Its story follows Popeye&#x27;s adventures as he arrives in the town of Sweethaven.

The film premiered December 6, 1980, in Los Angeles, California, and opened in the rest of the United States the following week, distributed by Paramount, with Disney handling international distribution through Buena Vista International. It grossed $6.3 million in its opening weekend, and $49.8 million worldwide, against a budget of $20 million. It received negative reviews from critics when it was first released, but has received improved reviews over time.

== Plot ==

Popeye, a gruff but good-hearted sailor, arrives at the small coastal town of Sweethaven while searching for his missing father. He rents a room at the Oyl family&#x27;s boarding house, where the Oyls plan to have their daughter, Olive, become engaged to Captain Bluto, a powerful, perpetually angry bully who manages the town in the name of the mysterious Commodore.

The night of the engagement party, Olive sneaks out after discovering that the only attribute that she can report for her bullying fiancé is size. She encounters Popeye, who has failed to fit in with the townsfolk at the party. The two eventually find an abandoned baby in a basket. Popeye and Olive adopt the child, naming him Swee&#x27;Pea, after the town Sweethaven, and the three return to the Oyls&#x27; home. Bluto, whom Olive has stood up, finds out about this encounter and, out of rage, beats up Popeye and imposes heavy taxes on the Oyls&#x27; property and possessions. A greedy taxman follows up on Bluto&#x27;s demand, but Popeye helps the Oyls&#x27; financial situation, winning a hefty prize by defeating a boxer named Oxblood Oxheart.

The next day, Popeye discovers that Swee&#x27;Pea can predict the future by whistling when he hears the correct answer to a question. J. Wellington Wimpy, the constantly hungry local mooch and petty gambler, also notices this, and asks Popeye and Olive if he can take Swee&#x27;Pea for a walk. He takes him to the horse races and wins two bets. Hearing of this, Olive and her family decide to get in on the action and use Swee&#x27;Pea to win, but an outraged Popeye takes Swee&#x27;Pea away.

After Popeye throws the taxman into the sea (thereby earning the town&#x27;s respect), Wimpy kidnaps the child at Bluto&#x27;s orders. That evening, when Olive checks in on Popeye privately, she overhears him lamenting that Swee&#x27;Pea deserves to have two parents, and that he regrets leaving the way he did. The next morning, Wimpy informs Popeye about the kidnapping after being threatened by Olive. Popeye goes to the Commodore&#x27;s ship, where he learns that the Commodore, who has been tied up by Bluto, is indeed Popeye&#x27;s father, Poopdeck Pappy, who accepts that Popeye is his son after exposing Popeye&#x27;s hatred of spinach. Meanwhile, Bluto kidnaps Olive, and sets sail with her and Swee&#x27;Pea to find the buried treasure promised by Pappy. Popeye, Pappy, Wimpy and the Oyl family board Pappy&#x27;s ship to chase Bluto to a desolate island in the middle of the ocean, called Scab Island.

Popeye catches up to Bluto and fights him, but is overpowered. During the fight, Pappy recovers his treasure, and opens the chest to reveal a collection of personal, sentimental items from Popeye&#x27;s infancy, including a few cans of spinach. Salty Sam, a gigantic octopus, awakens and attacks Olive from underwater after Pappy saves Swee&#x27;Pea from a similar fate. With Popeye in a choke hold, Pappy throws a can of spinach to him; recognizing Popeye&#x27;s dislike for spinach, Bluto force-feeds it to him before throwing him into the water. The spinach revitalizes Popeye and boosts his strength, helping him to defeat both Bluto and Salty Sam. Popeye celebrates his victory and his newfound appreciation of spinach while Bluto swims off, having literally turned .

== Cast ==
== Production ==

In his book, &quot;Fiasco: A History of Hollywood&#x27;s Iconic Flops&quot;, James Robert Parish says that the &quot;Popeye&quot; musical had its basis in the bidding war for the film adaptation of the Broadway musical, &quot;Annie&quot;, between the two major studios vying for the rights, Columbia and Paramount. When Robert Evans learned that Paramount had lost the bidding for &quot;Annie&quot;, he held an executive meeting with Charles Bluhdorn, head of Paramount&#x27;s parent company, Gulf+Western, and executives Barry Diller, Michael Eisner and Jeffrey Katzenberg, at which he asked about comic strip characters to which the studio held the rights, and which could be used to create a movie musical; one attendee said, &quot;Popeye&quot;.

At that time, although King Features Syndicate (a unit of Hearst Communications) retained the television rights to &quot;Popeye&quot; and related characters, with Hanna-Barbera producing the series &quot;The All-New Popeye Hour&quot; under license from King Features, Paramount had long held the theatrical rights to the Popeye character, due to the studio having released the Popeye cartoon shorts produced by Fleischer Studios and Famous Studios from 1932 to 1957.

Evans commissioned Jules Feiffer to write a script. In 1977, he said that he wanted Dustin Hoffman to play Popeye, opposite Lily Tomlin as Olive Oyl, with John Schlesinger directing. Hoffman dropped out due to creative differences with Feiffer. Gilda Radner was also considered for the Olive Oyl role. Radner&#x27;s manager, Bernie Brillstein, discouraged her from taking the part, due to his concerns about the quality of the script, and worries of her working for months on an isolated set with Evans and Altman, both known for erratic behavior and unorthodox creative methods.

In December 1979, Walt Disney Productions joined as part of a two-picture production deal (including &quot;Dragonslayer&quot;), with Paramount Pictures handling the North American distribution, and Buena Vista International at the international distribution.

Principal photography commenced on January 23, 1980. The film was shot in Malta. The elaborate Sweethaven set was constructed beyond what was needed for filming, adding to the cost and complexity of the production, along with a recording studio, editing facilities and other buildings, including living quarters. Filming wrapped on June 19, 1980, three weeks over schedule, due to bad weather. The set is a popular tourist attraction known as Popeye Village. Parish wrote that Robin Williams referred to this set as &quot;Stalag Altman&quot;.

Parish noted other production problems. Evans insisted that the screenplay reflect the comic-strip Popeye, and not the &quot;distorted&quot; cartoon version. Feiffer&#x27;s script went through several rewrites, and he expressed concern that too much screen time was being devoted to minor characters. Feiffer also disliked Harry Nilsson&#x27;s songs, saying that they were not right for the film. Popeye&#x27;s original muscle arms formed of silicone rubber were difficult for Williams to manipulate and remove after filming, so two Italian artisans were brought to Malta to remake them, and Altman had to juggle his shooting schedule. He also had the cast sing some musical numbers during filming, breaking with the traditional movie-musical practice of actors recording the songs in a studio first, and lip-synching. This reduced the sound quality, due to difficulties in accurately capturing the voices. Williams rerecorded much of his dialogue, due to trouble with his character&#x27;s mumbling style, partly as a byproduct of talking with a pipe in his mouth. His penchant for ad-libs led to clashes with the director. The final battle involving the octopus was complicated by the mechanical beast&#x27;s malfunction. After the production cost rose beyond $20 million, Paramount ordered Altman to wrap filming and return to California with what he had.

== Release ==
&quot;Popeye&quot; premiered at the Mann&#x27;s Chinese Theater in Los Angeles on December 6, 1980, two days before what would have been E. C. Segar&#x27;s 86th birthday.

=== Home media ===
&quot;Popeye&quot; has been released to several home media formats, including VHS, Betamax, CED, LaserDisc, DVD, and through digital streaming services in both standard and high definition video resolutions. Paramount Home Entertainment released the first Blu-ray edition of &quot;Popeye&quot; December 1, 2020, in honor of the film&#x27;s 40th anniversary.

== Reception ==

=== Box office ===
The film grossed $6 million on its opening weekend in the United States, and made $32,000,000 after 32 days. The film earned $49,823,037 at the United States box office — more than double the film&#x27;s budget — and a worldwide total of $60 million.

&quot;Film Comment&quot; wrote, &quot;Before the film&#x27;s release, industry wags were mocking producer Robert Evans by calling it &#x27;&quot;Evansgate&quot;&#x27;,&quot; but, &quot;Apparently the film has caught on solidly with young children.&quot;

Although the film&#x27;s gross was quite successful, especially considering the much lower price of theater tickets at the time, the film was not the mega-blockbuster that Paramount and Disney had expected, and thus some wrote it off as a disappointment. Altman, once critically admired, was shunned in Hollywood. His decade-long career decline included a move to Paris, where he directed low-budget film adaptations of stage plays.

=== Critical response ===
Reviews at the time were generally negative, but the film has been more positively reappraised over time. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 58%, based on reviews from 43 critics. The critical consensus states: &quot;Altman&#x27;s take on the iconic cartoon is messy and wildly uneven, but its robust humor and manic charm are hard to resist.&quot; On Metacritic, it has a score of 64 out of 100, based on reviews from 14 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film 3.5 stars out of 4, writing that Duvall was &quot;born to play&quot; Olive Oyl, and with &quot;Popeye&quot;, Altman had proved &quot;it is possible to take the broad strokes of a comic strip and turn them into sophisticated entertainment.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; awarded 3.5 out of 4, writing that the first 30 minutes were &quot;tedious and totally without a point of view&quot;, but once Swee&#x27;Pea was introduced the film &quot;then becomes quite entertaining and, in a few scenes, very special&quot;. Richard Combs of &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote, &quot;In its own idiosyncratic fashion, it works.&quot; Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;a thoroughly charming, immensely appealing mess of a movie, often high-spirited and witty, occasionally pretentious and flat, sometimes robustly funny and frequently unintelligible. It is, in short, a very mixed bag.&quot;

Other critics were unfavorable, such as Leonard Maltin, who described the picture as a bomb: &quot;E.C. Segar&#x27;s beloved sailorman boards a sinking ship in this astonishingly boring movie. A game cast does its best with an unfunny script, cluttered staging, and some alleged songs. Tune in a couple hours&#x27; worth of Max Fleischer cartoons instead; you&#x27;ll be much better off.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that all involved &quot;fail to bring the characters to life at the sacrifice of a large initial chunk of the film. It&#x27;s only when they allow the characters to fall back on their cartoon craziness that the picture works at all.&quot; Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote, &quot;While there &quot;are&quot; things to like in this elaborately stylized, exasperating musical slapstick fantasy ... they emerge haphazardly and flit in and out of a precarious setting.&quot; Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described the film as &quot;rarely uninteresting but seldom entirely satisfying&quot;, and thought that the adult tone of the dialogue left it &quot;uncertain what the film&#x27;s target audience is intended to be.&quot; TV Guide says, &quot;This film from director Robert Altman and scenarist Jules Feiffer adapts &#x27;Popeye&#x27; to feature length – a good idea gone down the drain under Altman&#x27;s spotty direction. Only in the last 50 minutes does &quot;Popeye&quot; create some excitement.&quot;

=== Legacy ===
Several authors have contrasted &quot;Popeye&quot; with subsequent comic book movies. One article calls it a &quot;road not taken&quot; in comic book adaptations. The author praised &quot;Popeye&quot;, &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; (1990), and &quot;Hulk&quot; (2003) for using comic techniques, such as &quot;masking, paneling, and page layout&quot; in ways that the DC Extended Universe and Marvel Cinematic Universe do not. An article for WBUR agreed that &quot;Popeye&quot; and &quot;Hulk&quot; were more &quot;artistic&quot; than modern comic movies, and said that &quot;Popeye&quot; has been &quot;mistakenly&quot; overlooked.

Filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson is a noted fan of the film, listing it as a favorite, even using Duvall&#x27;s song, &quot;He Needs Me&quot;, in his own film, &quot;Punch-Drunk Love&quot; and its soundtrack.

Director Phil Lord is also a fan of the film and has cited it as an inspiration: &quot;It comes from trying not to be vain about what you&#x27;re making on the surface. Like, who cares if [&quot;The Lego Movie&quot; is] based on a popular toy brand? It&#x27;s still an opportunity to make something really interesting. I think we&#x27;ve always approached these things as a way to express ourselves personally, which no one does! Maybe it comes from watching Robert Altman&#x27;s &quot;Popeye&quot; a lot.&quot;

== Accolades ==
The film won Worst Picture at the Stinkers Bad Movie Awards in its original ballot, and again in its expanded ballot in 2006. The film also received a Saturn Award nomination for Best Fantasy Film.

== Soundtrack ==
=== Original release ===
The soundtrack was composed by Harry Nilsson, who took a break from producing his album &quot;Flash Harry&quot; to score the film. He wrote all the original songs and co-produced the music with producer Bruce Robb at Cherokee Studios. The soundtrack in the film was unusual, for the actors sang some of the songs &quot;live&quot;. For that reason, the studio album did not quite match the tracks heard in the film. Van Dyke Parks is credited as music arranger.

The U.S. trailer contains the song &quot;I Yam What I Yam&quot; from the soundtrack album, not the film&#x27;s live performance.

&quot;I&#x27;m Popeye the Sailor Man&quot; was composed by Sammy Lerner for the original Max Fleischer cartoon, &quot;Popeye the Sailor&quot;.
The song &quot;Everything Is Food&quot; was not included on the album, and the song &quot;Din&#x27; We&quot; (which was cut from the film) was included. In 2016, a vinyl-only limited-edition version of the album was released with two bonus tracks by Varèse Sarabande, for Record Store Day Black Friday.

=== 2017 deluxe edition ===
In 2017, Varèse Sarabande released a deluxe edition that placed the songs in the original order of the film, reinstated &quot;Everything Is Food&quot;, and included a second disc of demo versions of the songs sung by Nilsson and the cast. In 2018, fourteen of the demos were released on vinyl as &quot;Music from the Motion Picture Popeye – The Harry Nilsson Demos&quot;.

<text>Walter Louis Garland (November 11, 1930 – December 27, 2004), known professionally as Hank Garland, was an American guitarist and songwriter. He started as a country musician, played rock and roll as it became popular in the 1950s, and released a jazz album in 1960. His career was cut short when a car accident in 1961 left him unable to perform.

The Hank Garland biopic &quot;Crazy&quot; was released in 2008.

==Biography==
Born in Cowpens, South Carolina, Garland began playing guitar at the age of six, and began to appear on local radio shows at 12. At 14 he moved to Spartanburg, South Carolina where he met Don Reno who gave him lessons, and worked with him on the WSPA-FM station in Spartanburg, both playing lead guitar. 

He moved to Nashville at age 16, staying in Ma Upchurch&#x27;s boarding house, where he roomed with Bob Moore and Dale Potter. At age 18, he recorded his million-selling hit &quot;Sugarfoot Rag&quot;. He appeared on the &quot;Jubilee&quot; program with Grady Martin&#x27;s band and on &quot;The Eddy Arnold Show&quot;. Garland is perhaps best known for his Nashville studio work with Elvis Presley from 1958 to 1961 which produced such rock hits as: &quot;I Need Your Love Tonight&quot;, &quot;A Big Hunk O&#x27; Love&quot;, &quot;A Fool Such As I&quot;, &quot;I Got Stung&quot;, &quot;Stuck on You&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Comin&#x27; Home&quot;, &quot;I Feel So Bad&quot;, &quot;Little Sister&quot; and &quot;(Marie&#x27;s the Name) His Latest Flame&quot;. He worked with many country music and rock and roll musicians of the late 1950s and early 1960s, such as Patsy Cline, Brenda Lee, Mel Tillis, Marty Robbins, The Everly Brothers, Boots Randolph, Roy Orbison, Conway Twitty, and Moon Mullican.

Garland&#x27;s guitar drove such classic recordings as Little Jimmy Dickens&#x27; &quot;I Got a Hole in My Pocket&quot;; Benny Joy&#x27;s &quot;Bundle of Love&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Move&quot;; Jimmy Lloyd&#x27;s (recorded under pseudonym of (Jimmie Logsdon) &quot;You&#x27;re Gone Baby&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Rocket in My Pocket&quot;; Lefty Frizzell&#x27;s &quot;You&#x27;re Humbuggin&#x27; Me&quot;; Simon Crum&#x27;s &quot;Stand Up, Sit Down, Shut Your Mouth&quot;; and Johnnie Strickland&#x27;s (1935-1994) &quot;She&#x27;s Mine&quot;; plus, seasonal staples &quot;Jingle Bell Rock&quot; with Bobby Helms, and Brenda Lee&#x27;s &quot;Rockin&#x27; Around the Christmas Tree&quot;. Don Gibson&#x27;s &quot;Sweet Sweet Girl&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me Your Troubles&quot;; Patsy Cline&#x27;s &quot;Let the Teardrops Fall&quot;; Ronnie Hawkins&#x27; &quot;Jambalaya&quot;; and Faron Young&#x27;s &quot;Alone with You&quot; spotlighted Garland&#x27;s guitar work.

He played with George Shearing and Charlie Parker in New York and went on to record &quot;Jazz Winds from a New Direction&quot; with Gary Burton on vibraphone, Joe Benjamin on double bass, and Joe Morello on drums. That session took place in Nashville in 1960. 

That same year, Garland, along with other members of the Nashville &quot;A-Team&quot; of session players, was invited to perform at the Newport Jazz Festival. For years, these musicians unwound by playing jazz after hours at Nashville&#x27;s Carousel Club. The group included Gary Burton on vibes, guitarist Chet Atkins, pianist Floyd Cramer, saxophonist Boots Randolph, bassist Bob Moore, drummer Buddy Harman and African-American violinist Brenton Banks, who played in the string sections that adorned many Nashville recordings. RCA Victor had a mobile recording unit there to record their performance, but when rioting prematurely ended the festival, the group performed (with the tapes rolling) on the porch of the mansion where they were staying. The album was released as &quot;After the Riot in Newport&quot;.

At the request of Gibson Guitar company president Ted McCarty, Garland and guitarist Billy Byrd influenced the design of the Byrdland guitar, which derived from the Gibson L-5, having a slimmer body and shorter scale for ease of playing.

In September 1961, a car crash left Garland in a coma. He regained consciousness and recovered with the help of his wife, Evelyn, and two daughters, but due to a brain injury sustained in the car accident, he was unable to return to the studios. After Evelyn died at the age of 38 in a car crash in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on December 2, 1965, Garland&#x27;s parents took care of him until their deaths. He then went to live with his brother, Billy and wife Amy. 

Garland suffered from constant ill health in his later years and died in Orange Park, Florida on December 27, 2004, of complications from a staph infection. He was 74 years old. He is interred in Jacksonville Memory Gardens in Orange Park.

<doc id="1339195" wikidata="Q930143" url="?curid=1339195" title="Susumu Hirasawa">
<text>is a Japanese musician and composer. He is well known for his work for the films of director Satoshi Kon and the animated adaptations of the &quot;Berserk&quot; manga series, alongside his work as a solo artist.

== Early life ==
Hirasawa was born on April 2, 1954, to his father , a firefighter as well as a calligrapher. Under the penname , he wrote the names of album and band for the cover art of the P-Model album &quot;Potpourri&quot;. Hirasawa lived with his older brother, artist , who goes by the moniker &quot;YOU1&quot;. He formed a stage effects team for Mandrake and appeared on the band&#x27;s final show, running on a treadmill. Yūichi was P-Model&#x27;s art director for the band&#x27;s first 9 years of existence, and has done occasional artwork for his brother from 2013 onwards. His only musical credits are for writing the lyrics of &quot;For Kids&quot; and &quot;Sunshine City&quot; (from &quot;In a Model Room&quot;), and for doing backing vocals on &quot;Rocket&quot; (from &quot;The Ghost in Science&quot;).

Since childhood, Hirasawa had an interest in machinery, and thought of himself as an engineer. He was an RC plane enthusiast, wanting to be a pilot, and repaired broken devices like radios and flashlights given to him by his parents. He studied in the electronics department of , where he was the first to finish the graduation project, the construction of a TV, despite the fact he did not fully understand the circuits. He also had motocross as a hobby.

He enrolled in the in 1972 and graduated &quot;cum laude&quot; in 1975 from the university&#x27;s interior design course. According to the &quot;Tokyo Designers&#x27; Gakuin College &#x27;75 Design Annual&quot;, his graduation project was a dome-shaped stage set hall for Tangerine Dream&#x27;s performances.

== Career ==
In his fifth year of elementary school, Hirasawa learned to play the electric guitar, inspired by the surf and instrumental rock bands he heard on the radio and on TV, later joining his junior high school&#x27;s band. In 1973 he formed Mandrake, a progressive rock band that incorporated elements from heavy metal and krautrock together. Being one of the few Japanese progressive rock bands of its time, Mandrake achieved little success and released no albums during its lifetime.

During the early days of Mandrake, he worked as a part-time carrier on a fruits and vegetables market during the morning and at a Pepsi warehouse during the night, alongside Mandrake co-founder Fumiyasu Abe. In 1978, Hirasawa applied for a part-time lecturer position at Yamaha Music Foundation, and got the job, as he was the only person who applied. He taught courses at the Yamaha Synthesizer School until 1983, and met various musicians that he would later collaborate with through these lectures. After leaving his position as teacher, he took to making commercial jingles for the rest of the decade to make ends meet.

After discovering punk rock and working on synthesizer-heavy projects, Hirasawa decided to change the band into the electronic rock band P-Model in 1979. Initially met with success, they changed to the unpopular post-punk and experimental rock genres after Hirasawa went through an adverse reaction to his fame. With Hirasawa at the forefront, the band went through various lineups and achieved some popularity in the Japanese independent music scene.

In 1989, Hirasawa launched his solo career with the release of the album Water in Time and Space. His music incorporated elements from other genres, alongside themes from philosophy and psychology. He continued to change his musical style while concurrently working with two different iterations of P-Model until the group was disbanded in 2000. He has actively been releasing new music since.

==Compositions==
Hirasawa&#x27;s music takes from such concepts as analytical psychology, advances in digital technology, the philosophies of yin and yang, and principles of nature versus machines. As an avid fan of science fiction novels since the 1970s and an eclectic reader overall, he&#x27;s been inspired by the works of Frank Herbert, Carl Jung, Hayao Kawai, Kenji Miyazawa, George Orwell, Wilhelm Reich, Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, Theodore Sturgeon, Nikola Tesla and Kurt Vonnegut.

A constant source of inspiration for his music has come from Thailand. On a 1994 trip to Phuket, Hirasawa went through a &quot;Thai shock&quot;, amazed by the country&#x27;s culture, namely its transgender cabaret performers, some of whom he would invite to be singers on his albums and guest performers in his concerts throughout his career. After many trips back to the country Hirasawa grew to be increasingly identified with the Thai trans community, incorporating their problems and experiences in society into his work.

On having his music categorized based on western trends, Hirasawa has said:

==Performances==
For every main solo album he releases, Hirasawa also stages an accompanying &quot;Interactive Live Show&quot;, an interactive concert that merges computer graphics with his music to tell a story. The flow of each show is determined by audience participation; for example, &quot;Interactive Live Show 2000 Philosopher&#x27;s Propeller&quot; was formatted as a maze, and the audience was asked to choose which direction to go in. Provided with phone numbers to four cellular phones during one song, the audience was allowed to call the numbers to have Hirasawa play the corresponding ringtones. This created an improvised harmony between the background music and the ringing phones. Since 1998, participation has been possible through the internet.

Hirasawa&#x27;s live music is built on samples he activates with various hand-crafted machines and pre-recorded tracks without vocals. For the &quot;Solar Live&quot; concerts, he used solar power and a power-generating wheel as the source of energy for his electronic equipment.

Hirasawa has worked since the start of his solo career to decrease the amount of performers around himself. Most of his solo albums from 1992 onwards feature no guest musicians, and live backing bands were relinquished in 1994. Since then, only a few select shows have had guest singers or backing instrumentalists.

==Equipment usage==
Hirasawa is known for his eclectic choice of instrumentation. Some of the instruments he built himself, being inspired by his background in engineering and machinery.

===Guitars===
Hirasawa has favored guitars designed specifically by Japanese instrument manufacturers. With a movement in the early &#x27;80s of electric guitar makers moving away from mass-producing copies of foreign designs and towards original ones, Hirasawa played many unique models. Over a five-year period, from Mandrake&#x27;s last days to the early P-Model phase, he used the H.S. Anderson Rider, Fernandes Art Wave and ESP Random Star, painting them in bright colors (burgundy, yellow, blue and white). In 1983 he settled on Tōkai Gakki&#x27;s aluminum guitars as his main ones, attracted by their unique material and design. He used multiple Tōkai Talbos over an eleven-year period, with the guitar becoming an integral part of his image.

After Tōkai discontinued production and customer support for the Talbo due to financial difficulties in the mid-&#x27;90s, Hirasawa requested Fernandes to make him a guitar of his design in 1994 called &quot;PHOTON&quot;, a Talbo-shaped guitar with a wooden body. In 2004, he requested TALBO Secret FACTORY, a manufacturer of Talbos run by other musicians who also liked the guitar and wanted to continue to use it, to build a Talbo of his own design, called &quot;ICE-9&quot; (named after the material of the same name from Kurt Vonnegut&#x27;s novel &quot;Cat&#x27;s Cradle&quot;). It became Hirasawa&#x27;s main guitar for the next eight years. To showcase it, he made an eponymous mini-album in 2005.

Hirasawa has continued to work with the TALBO Secret FACTORY, requesting the conversion of one of his early Tōkai models into a new design of his, the &quot;ASTRO&quot;, in 2011 and asking for the renewal of the &quot;PHOTON&quot; with new specifications after two decades of usage. In 2012, Secret FACTORY co-founder HISASHI gifted him a Talbo of his own design, the &quot;EVO 0101Z&quot;, which Hirasawa adopted as his new main guitar, owning standard copies as well as two equipped with single coil guitar pickups for selective usage.

Besides those, Hirasawa has also used different types of guitar for specific purposes, playing MIDI guitars like the Ibanez X-ING IMG-2010 and Casio MG500, various acoustic and classical models, classic surf ones like the Mosrite and the Jaguar, and the Aria AS-100C/SPL silent guitar.

===Electronics===
Hirasawa has used Amiga computers extensively in his work, starting out with CG production in 1987, and later on applying it on his albums and live shows, using applications such as Say, SCALA, Bars &amp; Pipes, SuperJAM! and OctaMED. He stopped using Amigas with the &quot;LIMBO-54&quot; shows of 2003 and the &quot;Byakkoya&quot;/&quot;Paprika&quot; albums of 2006, since &quot;maintaining an Amiga now is, like maintaining a classic car, costly&quot;.

In the &#x27;90s he started a gradual transition to Microsoft Windows (later on dabbling in Ubuntu for a time), using programs such as Delay Lama, Vocaloids, Bars&#x27;n&#x27;Pipes (an unofficial continuation of the Amiga program), Cakewalk Sonar and Synth1.

When choosing string tones Hirasawa aims to find ones with unstable pitches and a &quot;dark sound&quot;, which he finds harmonious, such as the Mellotron, Kurzweil synths and EASTWEST&#x27;s line of Symphonic sounds.

===Recording/production===
In the &#x27;90s, Hirasawa gradually moved his work from professional facilities to home, dubbing his workspace on various residences &quot;Studio WIRESELF&quot;. He finally moved completely to it by the recording of 2000&#x27;s &quot;Philosopher&#x27;s Propeller&quot;. The following year he undertook the sustainable energy project &quot;Hirasawa Energy Works&quot; and changed his lifestyle so that all his music would be recorded with solar energy. To reduce carbon emission, Studio WIRESELF was outfitted to be powered completely by a photovoltaic system of 2 solar panels, with 2 car batteries to store extra energy. Years later, Hirasawa added 2 more panels to the studio and retired the batteries.

Initially Studio WIRESELF operated on large pieces of equipment, both analog and digital. With the advances of technology and the streamlining of production under Hirasawa Energy Works, the working landscape transitioned to software synthesizers, with the physical elements of the studio reduced to one recording booth and two workstations, one for Hirasawa and the other for engineer Masanori Chinzei.

==Activism and charity==
In 1988, Hirasawa sold a at a flea market in Yoyogi for charity. It contained three original songs made specifically for the release and came with a thirty-six-page long booklet containing an analysis of his dreams and his current experience. All proceeds were donated to the volunteering welfare facility for the mentally ill in Gunma Prefecture, founded by the psychologist who gave Hirasawa counseling around the time he made the P-Model albums &quot;Scuba&quot; and &quot;Karkador&quot;.

In 2001, a pregnant stray cat appeared in Hirasawa&#x27;s studio. He took care of her and helped carry out four of her pregnancies from 2001 to 2002. Since he could not take care of all the kittens, Hirasawa created a temporary site to recruit possible adopters and keep up with the welfare of the various cats.

As Hirasawa objected to the American response after the September 11 attacks, which he believes involved excessive carnage, and the Japanese government&#x27;s aiding of such actions, he offered downloads of online banners and two of his songs for free, which he hoped would be used as tools of objection. One of them is a rerecording of 1994&#x27;s &quot;Love Song&quot;, which is about children in the battlefield; the other is &quot;High-Minded Castle&quot;, about a man who &quot;can not know the truth and true background through media, he tries to face the real tragedy on the other side of the world&quot;. The latter was taken from the &quot;Blue Limbo&quot; album, which displays a dystopian theme partly influenced by the American government&#x27;s retaliation.

To support freelance journalists, independent and citizen media, Hirasawa started a free music archive to be used by independent news as background music. He sent e-mails to various associates and members of P-Model requesting involvement, the only one to join was guitarist PEVO 1go. The files uploaded were instrumental mixes of songs by both musicians, including some from &quot;Vistoron&quot;, which revolves around the propagation of a false reality by mass media.

In the aftermath of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami and the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, Hirasawa started traveling around the country with a Geiger counter, measuring the radiation levels and reporting them in his Twitter account. In June 2011, a song was posted on his site, titled : A rerecording of the P-Model song &quot;Boat&quot; (from 1984&#x27;s &quot;Scuba&quot;) in the style of &quot;The Aggregated Past – Kangen Shugi 8760 Hours&quot; project, with the lyrics changed to protest against Japan&#x27;s use of nuclear power and to criticize the government and the media. The song, credited to &quot;Stealthman&quot;, was only available on the site for six days, but could be redistributed if unaltered and not for profit. An instrumental mix was posted on the site by Hirasawa after the original was taken down, following the same distribution guidelines. As these events occurred, Hirasawa told a story on Twitter of being assaulted and having his computer and website hacked by &quot;Stealthman&quot;. Through his tweets and the way the posts were worded on his website, Hirasawa effectively distanced himself from the track and disowned it. The song is available on the karaoke service provider Xing&#x27;s online song library, credited to &quot;Stealthman&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 2013, Yūichi opened the Gazio in Tsukuba. Although branded as a &quot;new wave&quot; café, the establishment was heavily themed around P-Model and Hirasawa&#x27;s discography; it contained various band related memorabilia, served original cocktails titled after his songs and often held special events and shows by members and associates of the band. Hirasawa made exclusive content for it and, as he gives his brother most things he has no need for at a given moment, many studio and stage objects were displayed in the café. Gazio ceased operations as an active restaurant in 2015 and rebranded as an art studio; Yūichi now holds twice monthly &quot;Café Gazio&quot; events in Kichijōji.

Hirasawa started smoking in 1979 and quit in 2001; he has since become an avid user of electronic cigarettes. He is also a teetotaler, since drinking more than one fifth of beer makes him feel like his head grow &quot;...five times bigger, then explode.&quot; Despite this, he previously drank wine before singing in order to preserve his voice; he has since replaced this with throat lozenges.

Hirasawa is a vegetarian, as he has remarked before, &quot;At any rate, meat is unappetizing and gross. Eating meat makes me tired and makes me throw up&quot;. He lives in a house in Tsukuba with his pet calico cat named . His house also has a garden, where he grows some of his food. He also cultivates bacteria to make soy yogurt.

While repeatedly incorporating various concepts from Shintoism and Buddhism in his themes, as well as ones from other Asian religions, Hirasawa has never specified what his beliefs are. However, at one point in time, he supported the return of the imperial cult of the Emperor of Japan as a psychological measure: &quot;I think His Majesty needs to recover his glorification. In this matter, I&#x27;m sort of right wing; the Emperor of Japan needs to regain his symbolic position as a God. But this is for the sake of a healthy process of collective consciousness, so please don&#x27;t lump my position in with all the militaristic talk&quot;.

<text>Will Rock is a first-person shooter developed by Saber Interactive and published by Ubisoft. Released in June 2003, it was the first game developed by Saber Interactive. It received mixed reviews, with critics comparing the game unfavorably to &quot;Serious Sam&quot;.

==Plot==
With the aid and powers of the titan Prometheus, Will Rock rampages through Lost Olympus, seeking the safe return of his love, Emma, and revenge for the murder of his mentor, Dr. Headstrong. Prometheus, fusing his spirit into Will&#x27;s able body, seeks to wage a bloody vendetta against the god Zeus, who robbed him of physical form long ago. Half mortal, half Titan, Will Rock will stop at nothing short of toppling the pillar of the gods to wreak vengeance of mythic proportions, and to save a terrified woman in the name of love. They don&#x27;t have much time, though on the eve of the next thunderstorm, Zeus will be able to take a new wife and this time his sights are set on a mortal: Emma Headstrong.

== Gameplay ==
The game is a first-person shooter, with the player having control over the main protagonist, Will Rock. The player can use 11 different weapons in combat. The single-player mode of the game has 10 levels, and there are different multiplayer modes in the game.

==Reception==
The game received &quot;mixed&quot; reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Chris Hudak of IGN gave the game a score of 7.2/10, praising the graphics and gameplay. GameSpot criticized the game for being a mindless knockoff of &quot;Serious Sam&quot; in a more negative review.

<text>Asociația Club Sportiv SR Municipal Brașov (), commonly known as SR Brașov or simply Brașov, is a Romanian football club based in the city of Brașov, Brașov County, which competes in the Liga III.

The team was created in 2017 by the supporters of the original FC Brașov, which was dissolved that year. &quot;SR&quot; stands for &quot;Steagul Roșu&quot; (&quot;the Red Flag&quot;) or &quot;Steagul Renaște&quot; (&quot;Steagul Reborn&quot;).

Meanwhile, another entity was founded in 2021 and gained permission to use the FC Brașov brand, although it has a continuity issue and enjoys lower fan support.

==History==
===Early modern football in Brașov===
Football in Brașov started between 1912 and 1914. In 1928, the unrelated Colțea Brașov won the national title and enjoyed a decade&#x27;s long rivalry with Braşovia, the city&#x27;s other major, which reached the semifinals of the Romanian National League in 1925.

Uzinele Astra Brașov made their debut in the Romanian league system in the 1939–1940 season, when it competed in the Braşov District Championship, finishing 3rd in Group 2. The club achieved promotion to Divizia B next season by winning the District Championship final, but the competition was postponed because of the Second World War. During the war championships (unofficial status), UAB battled for promotion in Divizia A at the end of the 1942–1943, losing the playoffs to Uzinele Metallurgice Cugir. The 1943–1944 season was halted midway because of the Allied bombing missions over Romania. The city of Braşov was, alongside Bucharest and Ploieşti, one of the main targets, and Uzinele Astra Braşov were bombed on two occasions, 16 April and 6 June 1944, sustaining major damages.

The club finished 4th în Group 1 of the District Championship of the 1945–1946 season, the first official post war competition, and 3rd in Divizia C 1946–1947, in which the starting XI was formed by: Moraru – Orghidan, Szurd – Nichita, Zelenak, Grosaru – Nagy, Antonescu, Herold, Caceavski, Vlad.

Uzinele Astra Braşov&#x27;s biggest rival during the 1940-1950 period were ACFR Braşov. In the 1941–1942 season, UAB lost top spot in the District Championship to ACFR by goal difference, were defeated 4–0 in the 1947 final for promotion in Divizia B, but won the 1950 District Championship Final with 3–0 on aggregate (3–0 home, 0–0 away).

===Insolvency and bankruptcy of FC Brașov===
In the spring of 2015 FC Brașov had financial problems and went into insolvency. In the summer of 2015 all the team&#x27;s players changed and the target was promotion to Liga I. But by the end of the season they were in 5th place, outside the promotion places.

In the summer of 2016 the team did not have the budget needed to participate in Liga II and financial problems continued to multiply. The situation was saved with a few weeks before the start of the new season when Alexandru Chipciu, a former player of the team, was sold by Steaua București to Anderlecht and FC Brașov received a stake in the transfer. Cornel Țălnar was named the new manager and the goal was still promotion, considered the only financial recovery solution of the club. The team started well, but finished the season in 7th place.
After the end of the championship, FC Brașov announced that the team will not join the new season of Liga II, and was declared bankrupt.

===Establishment of SR Brașov===
In the summer of 2017 The Flag-bearers Supporters League announced the establishment of AS SR (meaning: Asociația Sportivă Steagul Roșu – The Red Flag Sporting Association) Brașov, club set up by the model followed by FC Vaslui, Petrolul Ploiești, Oțelul Galați or Farul Constanța, big clubs in Romanian football which were also dissolved and brought back to life by their supporters.

In the summer of 2021, Corona Brașov merged with ACS Scotch Club (FC Brașov brand bearer) and established FC Brașov (2021). The supporters refused to support the new project.

==Stadium==

The club plays its home matches on Stadionul Silviu Ploeșteanu from Brașov, a stadium with a capacity of 8,800 seats, the biggest of Brașov County.

==Support==
SR Brașov has many supporters in Brașov County. The ultras groups of SR Brașov are organized in The Flag-bearers Supporters League and they have friendly relations with F.C. Universitatea Cluj supporters.

<doc id="1339210" wikidata="Q5249242" url="?curid=1339210" title="Decision model">
<text>A decision model in decision theory is the starting point for a decision method within a formal (axiomatic) system. Decision models contain at least one action axiom.

An action is in the form &quot;IF &lt;this&gt; is true, THEN do &lt;that&gt;&quot;. An action axiom tests a condition (antecedent) and, if the condition has been met, then (consequent) it suggests (mandates) an action: from knowledge to action. A decision model may also be a network of connected decisions, information and knowledge that represents a decision-making approach that can be used repeatedly (such as one developed using the Decision Model and Notation standard).

Excepting very simple situations, successful action axioms are used in an iterative manner. For example, for decision analysis, the sole action axiom occurs in the Evaluation stage of a four-step cycle: Formulate, Evaluate, Interpret/Appraise, Refine. Decision models are used both to model a decision being made once, as well as to model a repeatable decision-making approach that will be used over and over again.

==Formulation==
Formulation is the first and often most challenging stage in using formal decision methods (and in decision analysis in particular). The objective of the formulation stage is to develop a formal model of the given decision. This may be represented as a network of decision-making elements, as a decision tree or in other ways depending on the specific situation. The formulation may be conceptual or may include all the necessary decision logic (business rules) required to define the decision-making.

==Evaluation==
Evaluation is the second and most algorithmic stage in using formal decision methods. For a decision being made once, the objective of the evaluation stage is to produce a formal recommendation (and its associated sensitivities) from a formal model of the decision situation. For a repeatable decision evaluation occurs each time the decision is made by applying the decision model that has been developed.

==Appraisal==
Appraisal is the third and most insightful stage in using formal decision methods. The objective of the appraisal stage is for the decision maker to develop insight into the decision and determine a clear course of action. Much of the insight developed in this stage results from exploring the implications of the formal decision model developed during the formulation stage (i.e., from mining the model). Central to these implications is the formal recommendation for action calculated during the evaluation stage. Other implications include various forms of Sensitivity of the recommendation to various components of the decision model. Insight may also result from discussion of the key aspects of the reasoning that led to the formal decision model (i.e., by justifying the model). Possible actions following the appraisal stage include implementing the recommended course of action, revising the formal model and reevaluating it, or abandoning the analysis and doing something else.

Justifying a decision model entails exploring and explaining the reasoning that led to the formulation of particular aspects of the decision model.

Mining a decision model entails extracting information (e.g., sensitivity, value of prediction, and value of revelation) from a given decision model.

==Refinement==
Refinement is the fourth and most critical stage in using formal decision methods. The refinement stage responds to the insights obtained during the Appraisal stage. Effective refinement activities include opportunities to test possible decision model changes to see their implications and suggest better ways to modify the decision model.

<text>Zipcar is an American car-sharing company and a subsidiary of Avis Budget Group. Zipcar provides vehicle reservations to its members, billable by the minute, hour or day; members may have to pay a monthly or annual membership fee in addition to car reservations charges. Gas, maintenance, insurance options, and a dedicated parking spot are included. Zipcar was founded in 2000 by Antje Danielson and Robin Chase.

On March 14, 2013, Avis Budget Group acquired Zipcar for approximately million. Scott Griffith, who had run the company for the previous decade, resigned the day after the acquisition closed and passed the reins to a new company president, Mark Norman. In early 2014, Kaye Ceille took over as Zipcar&#x27;s North American president. In the summer of 2016, Ceille became a managing director of Avis Budget Group International and in 2017, Tracey Zhen was appointed as president. Angelo Adams was announced as the head of Zipcar in 2022.

In September 2016, Zipcar announced that it had 1 million members across 500 cities in nine countries, and offers nearly 10,000 vehicles.

Members can instantly join and reserve vehicles via Zipcar&#x27;s Android or iPhone mobile app or online and, once approved, immediately book Zipcars up to a year in advance. Zipcar members have 24/7 on-demand access to the cars by enabling Bluetooth on their Zipcar mobile app or, if needed, an access card which unlocks the door; the keys are already located inside. Members can also use Zipcar&#x27;s app to search, book and locate a Zipcar by honking its horn, extend, end and cancel a reservation. 

In the third quarter of 2007, Zipcar merged with Seattle-based rival Flexcar to create a nationwide car rental company. The company&#x27;s IPO was in April 2011. Zipcar common stock traded on NASDAQ under the ticker symbol &quot;ZIP&quot; until it was acquired by Avis in 2013.

==History==

Zipcar was co-founded by Antje Danielson and Robin Chase based on German and Swiss company precedents in January 2000. In June 2000, the first Zipcars hit the road around Boston, Massachusetts. In January 2001, Danielson was fired after Chase petitioned Zipcar&#x27;s board for the ability to make hiring and firing decisions without consulting them.

In September 2001, the Washington, D.C. office opened, with the branch in New York City following in February 2002. In February 2003, after difficulties in securing additional rounds of funding, the Zipcar board replaced Robin Chase as CEO with Scott Griffith. In July 2005, Zipcar secured $10 million in funding led by Benchmark Capital. In August 2005, San Francisco office opened. In May 2006, the Toronto office opened. In May 2006, General Electric&#x27;s Commercial Finance Fleet Services () gave Zipcar $20 million in lease line financing. In September 2006, the Toronto market was named the fastest growing new market in company history.

In November 2006, the London office opened. In April 2007, the Vancouver office opened. In October 2007, Zipcar and Flexcar executives announced a merger of the two companies, with the Zipcar brand and headquarters replacing that of Flexcar.

On 23 January 2008, the merged Zipcar/Flexcar canceled service for the Southern California cities of Los Angeles and San Diego without providing advance notice to customers in those areas, although Southern California college operations were left intact. On July 11, 2008, Zipcar announced it doubled membership in past year, including the Flexcar members it acquired, and now had 225,000 members. On August 28, 2008, Rice University announced its introduction into the program in their goal of achieving the lowest possible carbon footprint while providing additional transportation options for employees that carpool. In June 2009, the company announced an iPhone application at the Apple World Wide Developer Conference; the application is capable of honking the horn and unlocking some Zipcars.

Following impressive third-quarter results, previous CEO Scott Griffith announced that 2012 would mark Zipcar&#x27;s &quot;first full year of profitability on a US GAAP basis&quot;. Scott Griffith stepped down on March 15, 2013, following Avis Budget Group&#x27;s acquisition of Zipcar. Mark Norman remained as president until February 2014, when Avis Budget Group announced that Kaye Ceille was appointed president of Zipcar, and &quot;Mark Norman would step down in order to pursue another career opportunity.&quot; In July 2016, Kay Ceille stepped down as president of Zipcar to become the managing director of Avis Budget Group International, Australia. On January 5, 2017, Zipcar announced that after a 6-month search they appointed Tracey Zhen as its new president. Zhen came over from TripAdvisor where she had been a vice president and general manager. On September 27, 2020, Zipcar announced Angelo Adams as its new head of Zipcar.

Zipcar saw a significant swing in demand during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a falloff in demand in March 2020 and a surge in May. Having taken cars off the road, the company had trouble keeping up with demand, causing a backlog at the customer service center. Some customers arrived at the time of their reservation to find no car in the parking spot. Some customers reported being stranded without transportation and unable to reach customer service to complain or cancel their membership. President Tracey Zhen apologized in June, saying the company was adding cars and customer service employees. By that month, she reported membership applications in New York City 70% above June 2019. An anonymous employee told CNN that the problems were exacerbated by laying off more than 20% of its employees, and changing call centers.

== Membership ==

Members are able to view vehicle availability and reserve a self-service car via the internet, Android, and iPhone apps, or by telephone, in increments as short as 30 minutes. Members pay only for time they reserve. Zipcar vehicles report their positions to a control center using in-car technology. In the U.S., each reservation entitles members up to for a 24-hour period and then $0.45 per mile beyond 180 miles ($0.55 per mile for premium vehicles and cargo van rentals) will be charged within the 24 hour period. If the rental is longer than 24 hours, then the member is entitled to per 24 hours; then per additional hour of the reservation period until is reached. If the 180 mile limit based on hours is exceeded then $0.45 per mile will be charged ($0.55 per mile for premium vehicles and cargo van rentals). Canadian members receive up to with each reservation for the first 24 hours with $0.30 per kilometre (up to $0.45 per kilometre for premium vehicles and cargo van rentals) being charged if the 200 km limit is exceeded. If the rental reservation is longer than 24 hours, then is included per 24 hours period along with per each additional hour up to . If the 200 km limit based on hours is exceeded, then $0.30 per kilometre (up to $0.45 per kilometre for premium vehicles and cargo van rentals) will be charged. Individual members can sign up for one of two different plans, the &quot;Occasional Driving Plan&quot; and the &quot;Extra Value Plan&quot;.

Members are given an access card containing a wireless chip that will open the vehicle they have reserved only at the time they have reserved it. The reservation includes vehicle insurance, a gas card for the car. A member can reserve and use a Zipcar in any Zipcar city.

==Fees==

Zipcar was sued in 2009 and again in 2011 by customers alleging that they charged excessive or hidden fees. The suit cited several hidden charges, including a charge to talk to a customer service representative even when customers call to report a problem that cannot be handled through the website or automated phone system, additional fees on top of the cost of a parking ticket even if the ticket was overturned in court, late fees starting at $50, a fee to retrieve items left in cars, and an inactivity fee. According to the complaint, many customers may not even be aware of the charges because Zipcar does not send monthly statements. The lawsuit was dismissed in 2010, after U.S. District Judge Nathaniel M. Gorton found that every penalty except an inactive-user charge is legal. In August 2016, Zipcar agreed to settle a case involving allegations of charging New York consumers illegal damage fees for rental vehicles. According to New York Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman, New York State law mandates if rental car companies mean to pursue charges for damages to their vehicles, they must give consumers the opportunity to dispute the complaint. Schneiderman&#x27;s office alleges Zipcar failed to follow this requirement. The company sometimes purportedly charged consumers damage fees before notifying them of the charges. As a settlement, Zipcar will refund any damage charges assessed against consumers who disputed their responsibility for the damage. Additionally, the company will pay the Attorney General&#x27;s Office $35,000 for fees and costs. In addition, Zipcar is barred from charging customers for damage unless those customers agree they are liable or the company obtains a legal determination—for example, from a court—that the driver is responsible. As of September 25, 2018, the business is not accredited by the Better Business Bureau and averages a one-star review from the BBB from numerous complaints alleging deceptive business practices.

==University, organization and business partnerships==
Zipcar launched its Zipcar for Business program in early 2004 to provide companies with discounts on Monday-Friday driving. Since the launch of the program, Zipcar has signed 10,000 small, medium, and large sized businesses, as companies are increasingly adopting Zipcar&#x27;s on demand car rental model as a cost-saving alternative for employee travel. Zipcar has partnered with over 600 colleges and universities across North America.

==Zipcar fleet==

Zipcar offers more than 50 makes and models of vehicles. Each vehicle has a home location: a reserved parking space located on a street, driveway, or neighborhood parking lot in the member&#x27;s area, to which it must be returned at the end of the reservation. The locations of all Zipcars and models available at those locations are available at the Zipcar website. Zipcar currently (2019) has a fleet of 12,000+ vehicles. The makes and models of Zipcar vehicles available vary by location (for example, on college campuses, most Zipcar vehicles are economy, hybrid, and full-size cars), though members are able to choose the exact make and model of vehicle they wish from the list of available vehicles online or in the Zipcar smartphone application.

Most Zipcar vehicles will feature decals with the Zipcar logo. Each vehicle has a &quot;name&quot; that help the renter to identify their specific vehicle. Zipcar offers vehicles in different categories, such as economy cars, electric vehicles (EV&#x27;s), hybrid vehicles, full-size cars, luxury vehicles (such as those from Audi, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and other luxury manufacturers), SUV&#x27;s, pickup trucks, and cargo vans. A Zipcar vehicle will not unlock for the renter until their exact reservation time. Renters unlock their vehicle (both at the beginning of the reservation and throughout the rental) by either holding their Zipcar membership Radio Frequency Identification RFID card or smartphone against the upper corner of the vehicle&#x27;s windshield. The vehicle&#x27;s keys are always tied to the steering column of the vehicle, and stay inside the vehicle at all times. A Zipcar &quot;Copilot&quot; guide is located in the driver&#x27;s side sun visor, and includes a complimentary refueling card (gasoline card), insurance information, the vehicle registration card, and information about both the vehicle, as well as rental policies and procedures.

===Embedded technologies===

Zipcars have RFID readers located on the windshield that communicates with the card to lock and unlock the doors of the vehicle. Each vehicle records hours of usage and mileage, which is uploaded to a central computer via a wireless data link. The location of the vehicles is not tracked during a reservation for privacy reasons but is trackable, and all cars are equipped with a &quot;kill&quot; function that allows the company to prevent the car from starting in the event of theft. Zipcar also offers the embedded Information Technologies it has installed in its fleet as a fleet optimization service through its FastFleet service.

During a rental, a Zipcar member can interface with their rented vehicle using the Zipcar smartphone app, which includes the ability to locate the vehicle in a parking lot (including GPS location and the ability to sound the vehicle&#x27;s horn and flash the lights) and unlock or lock the vehicle.

===Clean fuel vehicles===
Among its fleet of fuel-efficient vehicles, and through an agreement between Honda and Zipcar, the program offers clean fuel and low-emission vehicles that include the Insight hybrid, Civic Hybrid, and Honda Fit EV all-electric car. Vehicles such as the Toyota Prius are also available.

===Zipcar Flex===
In the United Kingdom, some vehicles are branded &quot;Zipcar Flex&quot; which means that they can be left anywhere within a designated zone, rather than in a specific parking space. The remaining vehicles are branded &quot;Zipcar Roundtrip&quot;.

==Expansion==
On October 31, 2007, Zipcar and Flexcar announced their intentions to merge. The merged company retained the name &quot;Zipcar&quot; and was headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Zipcar&#x27;s chief executive, former Seattle-based Boeing engineer Scott Griffith, became Chairman and CO, while Flexcar CEO Mark Norman became president and Chief Operating Officer. The merger combined Zipcar&#x27;s fleet of 3,500 vehicles in 35 markets with Flexcar&#x27;s 1,500 cars in 15 markets.

In December 2009, Zipcar announced their participation in a round of financing with Avancar, the largest on-demand car rental company in Spain, based in Barcelona. Under the terms of the agreement, Zipcar acquired a minority interest in Avancar, a Zipcar executive joined Avancar&#x27;s board and Zipcar was given a year option to increase the company&#x27;s ownership stake. Later on in April 2010, Zipcar announced that it had acquired London-based car-sharing club Streetcar. In December 2010, Zipcar extended their option for another year through the end of 2011, and provided a monetary loan to Avancar, which is convertible into equity if Zipcar chooses to exercise the option. On October 17, 2012, Zipcar announced the completion of its Avancar integration. On January 22, 2019 Zipcar (Avancar) members received notification that the service would no longer be available as of midnight, February 28, 2019. On Facebook and Instagram, the company cited a decision made by Avis to discontinue the service in the Spanish city.

Since 2014, Zipcar has started services in cities in North America, Europe, and Asia.

==Insurance==

Zipcar provides liability coverage of $100,000 bodily injury per person, $300,000 bodily injury maximum, and $25,000 property damage per accident for members over 21 years of age who joined after March 1, 2015. Members at fault are responsible for the first $1,000 of costs related to the repair, recovery, and loss of use of any Zipcar vehicle. However, members can purchase no-liability insurance for an additional $79 a year. Members involved in accidents where fault is not determined (such as in a hit and run) must pay the first $1000 of these costs. For members under 21, Zipcar provides insurance coverage at state-mandated levels.

Zipcar has received some scrutiny for their low coverage limits.

Insurance coverage may vary depending on the region of use. For example, Canadian members in Toronto, Ontario, are provided with $1 million in liability coverage. Vancouver, BC members are provided with $2 million in liability coverage. Both regions in Canada also include comprehensive and collision coverage in addition to liability insurance. Previously, Zipcars traveling into Canada from the U.S. required members to obtain a special insurance card from Zipcar. As of February 2018, however, it appears that this is no longer the policy. Canadian Zipcars traveling into the U.S. do not need the extra insurance card.

Similar to members of Zipcar U.S., members of Zipcar London, UK, require a special &quot;vehicle on-hire&quot; certificate when traveling abroad, which can be obtained from Zipcar.

<text>Tashkurgan, historically known as Sarikol and Shitoucheng, is a town in the far west of China, close to the country&#x27;s border with Tajikistan. It is seat of Tashkurgan Tajik Autonomous County, in the autonomous region of Xinjiang. Tajiksethnic Pamiris who live in the Pamir Mountains of Xinjiangmake up a little over half of Tashkurgan&#x27;s population.

Tashkurgan was a significant stop on the Silk Road, with roads leading to major centers of trade such as Kashgar. It also served as the capital of a number of ancient and pre-modern kingdoms.

==Etymology==
The town is named after a stone fortress to its north; Tashkurgan accordingly means &quot;stone fortress&quot; in the Turkic languages. The official English spelling (per the Chinese government) of the name is &quot;Taxkorgan&quot;, while &quot;Tashkorgan&quot; appears occasionally in literature. The historical Chinese name for the town was &quot;Shitoucheng&quot; (), which literally means &quot;stone city&quot; in the context of a fortified city. The town was also historically known as &quot;Sarikol&quot; (, or ), after the Sarikol Range. The modern Uyghur name of the town is &quot;Tashqorghan&quot; ().

==History==

=== Ancient and pre-modern history ===
Tashkurgan has a long history as a stop on the Silk Road. Major caravan routes converged here leading to Kashgar in the north, Kargilik to the east, Badakhshan and Wakhan to the west, and Chitral and Hunza to the southwest (present-day Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan).

About 2,000 years ago, during the Han dynasty, Tashkurgan was the main centre of the Kingdom of Puli () mentioned in the &quot;Book of Han&quot; and the &quot;Book of the Later Han&quot;. Later it became known as &quot;Varshadeh&quot;. Mentions in the &quot;Weilüe&quot; of the Kingdom of Manli () probably also refer to Tashkurgan.

Some scholars believe that Tashkurgan is the &quot;Stone Tower&quot; mentioned by Ptolemy in his famous treatise &quot;Geography,&quot; which is said to have marked the midway point between Europe and China on the old Silk Road. Other scholars, however, disagree with this identification, though it remains one of the four most probable sites for the Stone Tower.

Centuries later Tashkurgan became the capital of the Sarikol Kingdom located in the Pamir Mountains, and later of Qiepantuo () under the Persian Empire. At the northeast corner of the town is a huge fortress known as the Tashkurgan Fort dating from the Yuan dynasty (1279–1368 CE) and the subject of many colourful local legends. A ruined fire temple is near the fortress.

The Buddhist monk Xuanzang passed through Tashkurgan around 649 CE, on his way to Khotan from Badakhshan, as did Song Yun around 500 CE. When British archaeologist Aurel Stein passed through the town in the early twentieth century he was pleased to find that Tashkurgan matched the descriptions left by those travellers: discussing Qiepantuo, Xuanzang recorded (in Samuel Beal&#x27;s translation): &quot;This country is about 200 li in circuit; the capital rests on a great rocky crag of the mountain, and is backed by the river Śitâ. It is about 20 li in circuit.&quot; Xuanzang&#x27;s discussion of Qiepantuo in book twelve of &quot;Great Tang Records on the Western Regions&quot; recounts a tale which might explain the name of Princess Castle, a tourist attraction near Tashkurgan: A Han Chinese princess on her way to marry a Persian king is placed on a high rock for safety during local unrest. She becomes pregnant from a mysterious stranger, ultimately giving birth to a powerful king and founding the royal line ruling at the time of Xuanzang&#x27;s visit. Stein records a version of this, current at the time of his visit, in which the princess is the daughter of the Persian king Naushīrvān. The Princess Castle is believed to be located south of the town near Chalachigu Valley.

Stein argued that, judging from the topography and remains found around Tashkurgan, the fort and associated settlements had clearly been central to the broader Sarikol area, controlling routes from the Oxus to the oases of southern Turkestan.

Xuanzang describes a substantial Buddhist site with tall towers, leading Stein to speculate as to whether the pilgrimage site dedicated to Shāh Auliya, several hundred yards to the northeast of the town site, and in use at the time of his visit, might have seen continuous but changing local use as a holy site down the centuries.

=== Modern history ===
During the Ili Rebellion from 1944 to 1949, Uyghur forces slaughtered the livestock of Tajiks as they advanced south.

In 1959, Tashkurgan Commune () was established.

In 1984, Tashkurgan Commune became Tashkurgan Town.

A number of residential communities have been added to and removed from Tashkurgan for census purposes. In 2010–2011, the residential communities of Bulakegale () and Xudong () were added to the town and Kuonabazha () and Yingshahai&#x27;er () were removed. In 2016–2017, the residential community Xingfu () was added to the town. In 2017–2018, the residential community Hongqi () was added to the town. In 2018–2019, the residential community Shajilin () was added to the town.

== Museum ==

In Tashkurgan there is a museum named the National Culture and Art Centre that houses a few local artifacts, a photographic display and, in the basement, two mummies – one of a young woman about 18 and another of a baby about three months old who was not hers. They are labelled as dating from the Bronze Age to the Warring States period (475–221 BCE). The mummies were discovered in the nearby Xiabandi Valley on the old caravan route to Yarkand. The valley has now been flooded for a hydro-electric project.

==Geography==

Tashkurgan is the seat of Tashkurgan Tajik Autonomous County. It is situated at an altitude of on the borders of both Afghanistan and Tajikistan, and close to the borders of Kyrgyzstan and Pakistan. Tashkurgan is a market town for sheep, wool and woollen goods, particularly carpets, and is surrounded by orchards. The majority population in the town are Tajiks (Pamiris). The majority of people in the region speak Sarikoli. There is also a village of Wakhi speakers. Mandarin Chinese and Uyghur are also spoken.

The Tashkurgan River begins just north of the Khunjerab Pass and flows north along the Karakoram Highway to Tashkurgan. Just north of Tashkurgan it turns east and flows through a gorge to the Tarim Basin where it joins the Yarkand River.

===Climate===
Tashkurgan has a cold desert climate (Köppen &quot;BWk&quot;), influenced by the high elevation, with long, very cold winters, and warm summers. Monthly daily average temperatures range from in January to in July, while the annual mean is . An average of only of precipitation falls per year.

==Administrative divisions==
, the town included six residential communities (&quot;Mandarin Chinese pinyin-derived names&quot;):
* Kashigale (), Bulakegale (), Xudong (), Xingfu (), Hongqi (), Shajilin ()

As of 2009, there were three residential communities:
* Kashigale (), Kuonabazha (), Yingshahai&#x27;er ()

== Transportation ==
As the area is remote from populated regions, it is served by Tashiku&#x27;ergan Hongqilafu Airport, which opened on 23 December 2022, with 3800 meter runway. It is China&#x27;s closest airport to Pakistan, Tajikistan, and Afghanistan. The airport offers one flight to Kashgar every day.

===Karakoram Highway===

Today Tashkurgan is on the Karakoram Highway which follows the old Silk Road route from China to Pakistan. Accommodation is available and it is a recommended overnight stop for road travellers from China to Pakistan, in order to have the best chance of crossing the snow-prone Khunjerab Pass in daylight. Special registration with the police must be made before entering Tashkurgan, and Chinese citizens must receive written permission from their local police department before entering the region.

Travelling from Xinjiang, it is about south of Kashgar and is the last town before the border with Pakistan. It is over the Khunjerab Pass from Sust, which is the Pakistani border town. Passenger road service between Tashkurgan and the Pakistani towns of Sust and Gilgit has existed for many years, and road service between Kashgar and Gilgit (via Tashkurgan and Sust) started in summer 2006. However, the border crossing between China and Pakistan at Khunjerab Pass (the highest border of the world) is open only between 1 May and 15 October. During winter, the roads are blocked by snow.

<text>Abner Linwood Holton Jr. (September 21, 1923October 28, 2021) was an American politician and attorney. He served as the 61st governor of Virginia, from 1970 to 1974, and was the first elected Republican governor of Virginia of the 20th century, as well as the first Republican governor since the Reconstruction era. He was known for supporting civil rights, integration, and public investment.

==Early life==
Abner Linwood Holton Jr. was born on September 21, 1923, in Big Stone Gap, Virginia, the son of Edith (Van Gorder), a homemaker, and Abner Linwood Holton, the executive of a small coal-hauling railroad. In his 2008 memoir, he wrote that could not remember a time as a youth when the goal of a Virginia governorship was not at the back of his mind. At his Stone Gap High School reunion in 1990, a childhood friend joked that he had sought the governorship since the 4th grade.

Holton entered Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia, in 1941. After the Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor, he enlisted in the United States Navy on July 4, 1942. He received a commission after graduating in 1944 with B.S. degree in commerce, cum laude, and served on active duty submarine service throughout World War II and in the reserves for more than two decades afterwards. He graduated from Harvard Law School in 1949.

Prior to entering politics, he was an attorney in Roanoke, Virginia.

==Political career==
Holton was active in the Republican Party when it barely existed in Virginia. He was one of the leading Republicans who fought the Byrd Organization during the three decades it dominated Virginia politics.

In 1965, Holton ran for governor as the Republican candidate and was defeated by Democrat Mills E. Godwin Jr. In 1969, Holton won 52.51% of the vote in the gubernatorial election, defeating Democrat William C. Battle, Virginia Conservative Beverly B. McDowell, American Independent William A. Pennington, and Independent George R. Walker. He became the first Republican governor of Virginia since 1869.

In 1970, when desegregation was an issue in Virginia, Holton voluntarily placed his children, including future First Lady Anne Holton, in the mostly-black Richmond Public Schools, garnering much publicity.

As governor, he increased employment of blacks and women in state government, created the Virginia Governor&#x27;s Schools Program in 1973, provided the first state funds for community mental health centers, and supported environmental efforts.

A moderate Republican, Holton was against welcoming conservative Byrd Democrats into the Virginia Republican Party. As the GOP moved increasingly rightward, it turned its back on Holton. When Harry F. Byrd Jr. broke ranks with the increasingly liberal national Democrats and ran as an independent for the Senate in 1970, Holton insisted on running a Republican candidate rather than endorsing an independent. That eventually led to the nomination of Ray Garland. Byrd went on to win the three-way election with an absolute majority.

Holton also encouraged a moderate Republican to run in the special election in 1971 to choose a successor for deceased Lieutenant Governor J. Sargeant Reynolds, an election that was won by another independent, populist Henry Howell.

Holton was not eligible to run in 1973, as Virginia does not allow governors to serve consecutive terms. In 1973, Mills Godwin, the conservative former Democrat who had defeated Holton in the 1965 election, was the Republican nominee. Godwin had supported massive resistance to racial integration and had first identified himself as a Republican in his speech accepting the Virginia Republican convention&#x27;s nomination for governor.

==Later life==
Following his term as governor, Holton served one year in the Nixon Administration as the Assistant Secretary of State for Congressional Relations. After leaving Washington, he practiced law as a shareholder at McCandlish Holton, P.C.

Holton later unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination for the United States Senate in 1978, finishing third in a race against Richard D. Obenshain, John Warner, and Nathan H. Miller. Warner subsequently became the nominee after Obenshain&#x27;s death in a plane crash.

Under Gov. Gerald Baliles (1987–1991), he served as interim president of the Center for Innovative Technology in Northern Virginia, where he guided it through managerial difficulties.

After his retirement, Holton supported moderate Republicans, including John Warner. As the Virginia Republican Party became more conservative, however, he found himself more in line with the state Democratic Party and endorsed several Democrats for statewide office, including his son-in-law, Governor Tim Kaine. Holton endorsed Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election.

The Holtons have four children: Tayloe, Anne, Woody, and Dwight. Anne is married to U.S. Senator and former Virginia Governor Tim Kaine, the nominee of the Democratic Party for Vice President of the United States in 2016. She was the first First Lady of Virginia to live in Virginia&#x27;s Executive Mansion both as a child and as a First Lady. In January 2014, Anne Holton was named Virginia Secretary of Education. Woody Holton (Abner Linwood Holton III) has published three books, including &quot;Unruly Americans and the Origins of the Constitution&quot; (2007), a finalist for the National Book Award, and &quot;Forced Founders: Indians, Debtors, Slaves and the Making of the American Revolution in Virginia&quot; (1999). His third book, a biography of Abigail Adams, won the Bancroft Prize in 2010. Dwight Holton served as acting U.S. Attorney for Oregon from 2010 to 2011. He later lost to Ellen Rosenblum in the May 2012 primary in the race for Oregon Attorney General.

In 1999, Linwood Holton Elementary School, in Richmond, Virginia, was named in his honor.

In November 2005, Holton underwent surgery for bladder cancer. In 2006, Holton, his wife Jinks, daughter Anne and son-in-law Tim Kaine opposed a proposed constitutional ban on same-sex marriage in Virginia.

The University of Virginia Press published his memoir, &quot;Opportunity Time&quot;, in March 2008. He was a long-time member of the Governing Council of the University of Virginia&#x27;s Miller Center of Public Affairs.

In 2017, the City of Roanoke hosted Holton for the dedication of a plaza named in his honor.

On the day of Ralph Northam&#x27;s inauguration in January 2018, Holton sat front and center for a photograph with Northam and nine other former governors who had followed Holton, including Bob McDonnell, Jim Gilmore, Tim Kaine, Terry McAuliffe, George Allen, Mark Warner, L. Douglas Wilder, Chuck Robb, and Gerald Baliles.

==Personal life==
Holton married Virginia &quot;Jinks&quot; Rogers on January 10, 1953. She was a CIA intelligence analyst and the daughter of a leading Roanoke Democratic Party figure. Together, they had four children, Anne, Tayloe, Woody, and Dwight. Anne is married to Tim Kaine, who served as governor of Virginia from 2006 through 2010, and has served as a United States Senator from Virginia since 2013. Kaine was the 2016 Democratic vice presidential nominee.

==Death, memorial, and legacy ==
Linwood Holton died of natural causes at his home in Kilmarnock on October 28, 2021, at age 98.

The memorial service for Holton in December 2021 at Second Presbyterian Church in Richmond included tributes to his belief in civil rights and school desegregation. In attendance were Gov. Ralph Northam, the other eight governors of the state, and Gov.-elect Glenn Youngkin. Ann Compton noted that when Holton took office, there were only 31 Republicans among the 141 members of the state legislature.

Holton&#x27;s tenure as governor ushered in a new era, bringing to seven Republican governors elected compared to seven Democratic governors.

<text>Henry Valerian George Wellesley, 6th Duke of Wellington (14 July 1912 – 16 September 1943), styled as Earl of Mornington between 1912 and 1934 and Marquess of Douro between 1934 and 1941, was a British peer and politician.

==Life and career==
He was the younger child and only son of Arthur Wellesley, 5th Duke of Wellington, and his wife, the Hon. Lilian Maud Glen Coats (elder daughter of George Coats, 1st Baron Glentanar). On 14 October 1933, he received a commission as a reserve second lieutenant in the Coldstream Guards, and he received a regular commission in the same rank in the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s Regiment on 13 November 1935.

He died, aged 31, on 16 September 1943, during the Second World War, from wounds received in action while leading a group of Commandos. He is buried in the British Salerno War Cemetery, Bivio Pratole, in the province of Salerno, Italy. At the time of his death, he was a captain in command of a troop in No. 2 Commando, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel &#x27;Mad&#x27; Jack Churchill.

Both No. 2 and 41 Commando were engaged at the Salerno landings, part of the Allied invasion of Italy. They switched from their initial battle area around Vietri sul Mare, west of Salerno, to a position two to three miles inland of Mercatello, then southeast of Salerno. The Germans held and were strengthening three high-ground positions. During the daytime of 16 September, No. 2 Commando moved back through a valley around the village of Piegolelle, dubbed &#x27;Pigoletti&#x27;, which had been cleared the night before, intending to capture a hill at the far end referred to as &#x27;Pimple Hill&#x27;. However, in the early hours, the Germans had sent light forces back into the valley and also strengthened &#x27;Pimple Hill&#x27;. On assaulting the hill two troops of commandos were exposed to well-positioned machine-gun fire. The Duke was among the fatalities: leading a charge against a machine-gun post he was hit by a sustained burst from an MG 42. His helmet was holed in three or four places. He was buried close to the place where he was killed.

His probates (one for his current and future-valued interest in the settled [entrusted] land, one for the rest) were resworn the next year at a total of .

As he died without issue and was the only son of his father, he was succeeded in the peerage by his uncle, Lord Gerald Wellesley. His sister, Lady Anne Rhys, succeeded him as 7th Duchess of Ciudad Rodrigo.

<text>Imagic ( ) was an American video game developer and publisher that created games initially for the Atari 2600. Founded in 1981 by corporate alumni of Atari, Inc. and Mattel, its best-selling titles were &quot;Atlantis&quot;, &quot;Cosmic Ark&quot;, and &quot;Demon Attack&quot;. Imagic also released games for Intellivision, ColecoVision, Atari 8-bit computers, TI-99/4A, IBM PCjr, VIC-20, Commodore 64, TRS-80 Color Computer, and Magnavox Odyssey². Their Odyssey² ports of &quot;Demon Attack&quot; and &quot;Atlantis&quot; were the only third-party releases for that system in America. The company never recovered from the video game crash of 1983 and was liquidated in 1986.

==History==
Imagic was the second third-party publisher for the Atari 2600, formed after Activision. Founders included Bill Grubb, Bob Smith, Rob Fulop, and Denis Koble from Atari, Inc., Jim Goldberger, Dave Durran and Brian Dougherty from Mattel as well as Pat Ransil and Gary Kato.
Grubb previously served as the vice president of sales and marketing for Atari for 18 months. Before that, he was with the marketing department at Black and Decker for 11 years. It was Grubb&#x27;s goal to take Imagic public and to eventually overtake Activision as the number one third-party video game publisher. Fulop, meanwhile, was previously a programmer at Atari, and claimed in a 2019 interview with &quot;Paleotronic Magazine&quot; that he left the company in favor of Imagic after being paid for developing the Atari 2600 port of &quot;Missile Command&quot; with a Safeway coupon for a free turkey rather than the monetary Christmas bonus he had expected.

Atari sued Imagic over &quot;Demon Attack&quot; because of its resemblance to &quot;Phoenix&quot;, to which Atari had the exclusive home-version rights. The case was settled out of court.

Despite initial success and sales greater than projections, the company&#x27;s fortunes reversed after the stock market dumped videogame stocks in late 1982, scuttling Imagic&#x27;s initial plan to become a publicly traded company.

==Fan club==
During its height, Imagic ran a fan club for their games, the Numb Thumb Club, which published an annual newsletter. Only two issues were published before Imagic&#x27;s demise in 1983.

==Decline==
Although Imagic grew quickly in its early years, it was irreparably harmed by the video game crash of 1983. It released 24 games before going out of business by 1986, but the exact time it disbanded is unknown. In 1983, the company laid off 40 of their 170 employees but appeared at the 1984 Consumer Electronics Show with plans for four IBM PCjr games. The rights to Imagic&#x27;s most popular titles have been owned by Activision since the late 1980s, and they have been re-released on several occasions.

==Games==

Imagic 2600 cartridges were distinct from both Activision and Atari cartridges with an extended ridge at the top of the cart. Packaging was distinctive due to the use of reflective silver on the boxes, with a tapered, ridged end intended for an easy grip. The years are for the original versions only, not subsequent ports.

<doc id="1339234" wikidata="Q5358425" url="?curid=1339234" title="Electronic skip protection">
<text>Electronic skip protection is a data buffer system used in some portable compact disc (CD) players and all MiniDisc (MD) units so that audio will not be disrupted if the disk cannot be read due to movement.

==Technology==
When the buffering circuitry is in operation, the compact disc is read at a fixed read speed or CAV and the content is buffered (with optional ADPCM compression) and fed to RAM within the player. The audio content is read from RAM, optionally decompressed, and then sent to the digital-to-analog converter. When the disc reading is interrupted, the player momentarily reads the data stored in RAM while the tracking circuitry finds the passage prior to the interruption on the CD.

Another method has the disc rotating at variable or CLV speed (the normal rotation method for a CD player), but at a slightly higher speed than with the buffer feature switched off. The buffer method is the same as before.

==History==
The technology surfaced around 1995 as a physically smaller alternative to the bulky rubber shock absorbers utilized in portable players at the time. It reduced the size of the hitherto bulky players designed for use in moving cars, in particular. Small rubber shock absorbers are still used, but are less effective than the larger pre-1995 ones.

When first introduced, 3 seconds was the maximum buffering time. In 2006, the time generally ranged from 10 seconds to &quot;skip-free&quot;, where the player will rarely skip due to a large buffer.

Due to the nature of the ATRAC compression scheme, and to ensure uninterrupted playback in the presence of fragmentation, all MD decks and portables buffered at least 10 seconds when the format was introduced in 1992. , MD units have much bigger buffers.

Flash-based MP3 players with no moving parts do not require electronic skip protection.

==Pros==
*Interruption-free playback.

==Cons==
*Audio quality may be slightly worsened due to compression artifacts when the system is in use. Quality is improved with uncompressed buffering.
*Battery life is shortened due to the fixed (CAV) read speed of the disc and power required by the memory.
**Older players (1992–1997) had at most half the battery life when the skip protection system was in use.
**Players from 1997 onward have more power-efficient skip protection.
*Portable players, more so portable CD players but also some portable DVD players, that invariably include an ASP feature (Anti-Skip-protection), struggle with CD-R/RW, DVD-R/RW and DVD+R/RW discs – due to the ASP feature being enabled. This is due to the limited read capability of such write-yourself media discs over retail pressed discs. It is widely believed that the buffer system of the ASP feature conflicts with the limited read capability of such discs. This conflict affects the re-writable formats more so than the write once formats, but can be prevalent with both. It is therefore advisable that if you use write-yourself media often, to look for a portable player that allows ASP to be enabled/disabled. As such read issues are invariably non-existent when the ASP feature is disabled. Using slow burning speeds and high-quality media also helps.

<text>The Taggerung is a fantasy novel by Brian Jacques, published in 2001. It is the 14th book in the &quot;Redwall&quot; series.

==Plot summary==
His birth was a long-awaited legend full of mystery and promise, among the outlaw Juska tribes along the western shore. Denoted by a unique mark on his right paw, the Taggerung is a fearsome fighter (In the story, the word &#x27;Taggerung&#x27; literally means a warrior of unbeatable strength, courage, and savagery), a warrior the likes of which has not been seen for many seasons.(Sawney Rath&#x27;s father was the most recent). When a seer from one tribe predicted his birth at Redwall Abbey, Sawney Rath the ferret, leader of the Juskarath, sets out to capture the Taggerung.

In Mossflower Woods, Rillflag, a European otter from Redwall is completing a birth ritual with his newborn son, Deyna, when Sawney Rath and his tribe of vermin ambush him. Vallug Bowbeast, a deadly ferret archer of the Juska Tribe murders Rillflag and captures the legendary infant. Sawney renames the young otter Zann Juskarath Taggerung or &quot;Tagg&quot; for short, determined to raise him as his own son, and to bring the Taggerung under his control.
As Tagg begins to grow older, he finds himself at odds with his fellow tribe members. He refuses to become violent and soon finds himself as the only member of the tribe who has never killed for fun, or at all. When Sawney orders him to skin a runaway red fox named Felch, Tagg refuses, enraging Sawney. Finding the roles reversed, Tagg flees and finds himself pursued by the ferret leader of the Juskarath.

Unfortunately for Rath, his chase is short-lived, as he is soon murdered by the ambitious stoat Antigra with a slingstone. Antigra hates Sawney Rath because she wishes her son, Gruven to be named as the Taggerung, and because of that, Sawney Rath had murdered her husband. Sawney&#x27;s death enables her bumbling son Gruven Zann to take control of the newly renamed Juskazann tribe. The vixen seer Grissoul tells Gruven he must hunt down the former Taggerung and bring back his head. Only then will some other ambitious Juska warriors accept him as their leader. To aid him in his quest, Gruven recruits a small band of vermin including Vallug Bowbeast, the deadly assassin, and Eefera, a high-ranking weasel, to continue the hunt for the Taggerung. Unfortunately for Gruven, his band of vermin would rather kill him than follow his orders, if only the opportunity presented itself. They are too accustomed to following Sawney&#x27;s orders to listen to the newly appointed chief.

Tagg runs away to find a pear tree, which he eats from and is reprimanded by two voles. They decide he won&#x27;t hurt them and invite him back to their home to eat stew and meet their nice friends. He enjoys this very much and would love to stay, but sadly, he knows that the Juskarath are chasing him. He bids them a bittersweet goodbye and sets off in a boat they give him.

In his travels, Tagg befriends a similarly mysterious (and, unlike Tagg, prone to telling lies) Eurasian harvest mouse named Nimbalo the Slayer, by saving him from a deadly snake from the mountains. Finding themselves in the company of a Eurasian pygmy shrew colony, they rest until they are attacked by Gruven and his slowly-diminishing band of vermin. Gruven and his band start a landslide, killing and burying many pygmy shrews. As Tagg chases the attackers of his newfound companions, the vermin scatter, leaving only one unfortunate member behind. Under the harsh gaze of Tagg, and the threat of being thrown to the pygmy shrews who lost loved ones in the landslide, the long-time member of Rath&#x27;s old tribe reveals all, including the name of Tagg&#x27;s true home: Redwall Abbey.

At the same time, Eefera the least weasel and Vallug Bowbeast, the most rebellious and intelligent vermin under Gruven&#x27;s command, decide to desert Gruven, deciding that he and the other two remaining hordebeasts would die in the mountain. They, being better trackers than Gruven, decide to follow the Taggerung and kill him, to bring his head back to the tribe and claim leadership over the Juskas. But they are both silently trying to find an opportunity to kill the other; Vallug is the more dangerous as a killer, but Eefera is a better tracker and more cunning.

When Tagg arrives at Redwall, he&#x27;s mistaken for one of the members of the band of Juska supposed to be hunting him, knocked out and locked up in the cellars. He&#x27;s then released on impulse by the assistant cook Broggle when the Juska, Eefara and Vallug, who have now captured Gruven and the other vermin, are threatening to kill Nimbalo, but then their plans go wrong. Tagg goes out to fight, and slays Vallug and Eefara, at the same time getting shot with an arrow by Vallug Bowbeast while Nimbalo goes after another rat. Then, Filorn, Tagg&#x27;s mother, recognises her son. Cregga Rose Eyes, the ancient blind badgermum, after being shot in the chest with an arrow, appoints Deyna&#x27;s sister, Mhera, as the new Abbess of Redwall, succeeding the now deceased Abbess Songbreeze, and then dies shortly after. Rukky Garge, a local otterfixer, manages to remove the distinguishing mark of the Taggerung from Deyna&#x27;s paw, remove his tattoos, and remove the arrow.

Deyna&#x27;s quest is not quite over, however, as the fox Ruggan Bor, now commanding the remnants of the Juskazann tribe as well as followers of his own, the Juskabor, shortly arrives to attack the stronghold of Redwall Abbey. Due to Gruven&#x27;s bragging on his return, they now believe the Taggerung is dead and seek to confirm this rumour. As chance may have it, however, the badger ruler of Salamandastron, Russano the Wise, arrives in time to fend off Bor&#x27;s attack, sending him and his vermin crew crawling on their bellies off into the sunset. Russano then takes a medal from around his neck and drapes it over Cregga Rose Eyes&#x27;s grave, as she was his adoptive mother many seasons before this terrible battle happened. This had been his reason for travelling to Redwall in the first place.

<text>Marlfox is a fantasy novel by Brian Jacques, published in 1998. It is the 11th book published and 13th chronologically in the &quot;Redwall&quot; series. Marlfoxes are an unusual breed of anthropomorphic foxes, which serve as the main antagonists in the book.

==Plot summary==
The wandering Noonvale companions travel to Redwall, where they wish to mount a show. On the way, however, they learn that the Marlfoxes will attempt to seize Redwall, and hasten onward to warn them, while Guosim from another part of Mossflower do the same.

The Marlfoxes consist of High Queen Silth and her brood. They are different from other foxes in their fur, which gives them the ability to blend into almost any surrounding, invisible to all but the keenest eye. This ability has given rise to the false rumour that the Marlfoxes are magic, which they are not. However, Marlfoxes are highly agile and skilled with axes.

Castle Marl, home of the Marlfoxes, is situated in the middle of an enormous inland sea, on the island that was once home to Badger Lord Urthwyte the Mighty. The Marlfoxes command a vast army of water rats, and they travel around the country seeking rare and priceless artifacts.
The Marlfoxes, backed by an army of water rats, mount a successful invasion of Redwall and steal the tapestry of the long dead hero, Martin the Warrior. The Marlfox Ziral is slain, however, and the remaining Marlfoxes swear revenge on the citizens of Redwall.

Mokkan, one of the Marlfoxes, escapes with the tapestry, leaving his siblings behind. Three young Redwallers, Songbreeze Swifteye, Dannflor Reguba, and a Guosim shrew named Dippler set out after Mokkan, trying to retrieve the tapestry. They meet Burble, a water vole, and have many adventures and meet many friends who help them on their journey, such as the gigantic hedgehog Sollertree, who lost his daughter Nettlebud to the Marlfoxes and water rats, and the Mighty Megraw, a large osprey who used to live by the Marlfox island but was driven away in an ambush by magpies.

Meanwhile, the remaining Marlfoxes lay siege to Redwall. After a series of battles, Songbreeze&#x27;s father Janglur Swifteye, Dannflor&#x27;s father Rusvul Reguba, Cregga Rose Eyes, and many others fight off the remaining army, killing the remaining Marlfoxes and restoring peace to Redwall. The surviving rats are divided into eight groups, with each group sent in a different direction.

Song, Dann, Dippler and Burble meet some new friends and set out into the great lake to the island. Mokkan finds that Silth has been killed by one of his sisters, Lantur. He promptly kills her by pushing her into the lake full of pike, proclaiming himself King. However, the companions arrive and overthrow the water rat army. Mokkan escapes in a boat, but an escaped slave, whom we find out is Nettlebud, throws a chain at him and knocks him into the lake, where he is eaten by pike.

The surviving water rats are left on the island to become peaceful creatures and farm the land, and the companions return home to Redwall, where Songbreeze Swifteye is named Abbess and Dannflor Reguba is named Abbey Champion by Cregga Rose Eyes, Redwall&#x27;s blind badgermum. Dippler is named Log-a-log, and Burble is named Chief of the Watervoles.

At the end of the novel is a note, stating that the entire tale was made into a drama, edited by one Florian Dugglewoof Wilffachop.

<doc id="1339242" wikidata="Q568790" url="?curid=1339242" title="Attack at Fromelles">
<text>The Attack at Fromelles ( (Battle of Fromelles, Battle of Fleurbaix or ) 19–20 July 1916, was a military operation on the Western Front during the First World War. The attack was carried out by British and Australian troops and was subsidiary to the Battle of the Somme. General Headquarters (GHQ) of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) had ordered the First Army (General Charles Munro) and Second Army (General Herbert Plumer) to prepare attacks to support the Fourth Army on the Somme, to the south, to exploit any weakening of the German defences opposite. The attack took place from Lille, between the Fauquissart–Trivelet road and Cordonnerie Farm, an area overlooked from Aubers Ridge to the south. The ground was low-lying and much of the defensive fortification by both sides consisted of building breastworks, rather than trenches.

The operation was conducted by XI Corps (Lieutenant-General Richard Haking) of the First Army with the 61st (2nd South Midland) Division and the 5th Australian Division of the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) against the 6th Bavarian Reserve Division, supported by the two flanking divisions of the German 6th Army. Preparations for the attack were rushed, the troops involved lacked experience in trench warfare and the power of the German defence was significantly underestimated, the attackers being . The advance took place in daylight, on a narrow front, against defences overlooked by Aubers Ridge, with German artillery on either side free to fire into the flanks of the attack. Another attack by the 61st (2nd South Midland) Division early on 20 July was cancelled, after it was realised that German counter-attacks had already forced a retirement by the Australian troops to the original front line.

On 19 July, General Erich von Falkenhayn, head of (OHL, the German army supreme headquarters) judged Fromelles to be the offensive he expected against the 6th Army. The attack gained no ground but inflicted some casualties; next day the failure was evident and a captured operation order from XI Corps revealed the limited nature of the operation. In 2012, a study of German records showed that none of the German divisions opposite XI Corps moved to the Somme until four to nine weeks later; Falkenhayn sent divisions from the Souchez–Vimy area, south instead, which has been misinterpreted in earlier accounts. The attack was the of the AIF on the Western Front and the Australian War Memorial described it as &quot;the worst 24 hours in Australia&#x27;s entire history&quot;. Of suffered by the 5th Australian Division; the Germans suffered and lost 
==Background==
On 5 July, during the Battle of the Somme November 1916) GHQ informed the three other British army commanders that the German defences on the Somme might soon fall. The First and Second army commanders were required to choose places to penetrate the German defences, if the attacks on the Somme continued to make progress. Gaps were to be widened to exploit weakness and disorganisation of the German defence. The Second Army commander, General Herbert Plumer, was occupied by preparations for an offensive at Messines Ridge but could spare a division for a joint attack with the First Army at the army boundary. On 8 July, General Charles Monro (First Army) ordered the XI Corps commander, Lieutenant General Richard Haking, to plan a two-division attack; Haking proposed to capture Aubers Ridge, Aubers and Fromelles but the next day Monro dropped Aubers Ridge from the attack, as he and Plumer thought that no great objective could be achieved with the troops available.

On 13 July, after receiving intelligence reports that the Germans had transferred about nine infantry battalions from the Lille area from 9 to 12 July, GHQ informed the two army commanders that a joint attack was to be carried out around 18 July, to exploit the depletion of the German defenders. Haking was ordered to begin a big preliminary bombardment to simulate a large offensive and conduct a local infantry attack on the German front line. On 16 July, discussions about the attack resumed, as the need for diversions to coincide with operations on the Somme had diminished when the Germans had not collapsed after the British success at the Battle of Bazentin Ridge (14 July 1916). Sir Douglas Haig, Commander-in-Chief of the BEF, did not want the attack unless it could succeed and Monro and Haking opposed a postponement or cancellation. The weather had been dull on 15 July and next day, soon after Monro and Haking made the decision to go ahead, it began to rain. Zero hour for the main bombardment was postponed because of the weather and at Haking delayed the attack for at least ; after having second thoughts, Monro postponed the operation until 19 July.

==Prelude==

===Offensive preparations===
The Second Army provided the 5th Australian Division (Major General James McCay), the artillery of the 4th Australian Division and heavy guns and trench mortars to XI Corps, for an attack from the Fauquissart–Trivelet road to La Boutillerie, with the 31st Division and 61st (2nd South Midland) Division. Lack of artillery, training and experience in the Australian divisional artilleries and some of the heavy batteries, led to the attack front being reduced to between the Fauquissart–Trivelet road and Delangre Farm. The ground was waterlogged, flat and visible from Aubers Ridge behind the German front to the south. The 39th Division and 31st Division moved their boundaries north as the 61st (2nd South Midland) Division concentrated along the Fauquissart–Trivelet road to Bond Street. The 20th (Light) Division moved its boundary south to Cordonnerie Farm on the left of the 5th Australian Division, which concentrated from Bond Street to Cordonnerie Farm. The twelve attacking battalions were supported by more artillery than the Battle of Aubers Ridge in May 1915, more ammunition was available and there were trench mortars for wire cutting. With support from First Army artillery to the south, guns and guns were ready, which gave a greater concentration of heavy artillery than that of the Fourth Army on the first day of the Somme. After several postponements for rain, visibility was better on 18 July and the artillery bombardment proceeded. The shelling of the German front at La Bassée was repeated and the German artillery retaliated.

===Plan===

The German salient at Fromelles contained some higher ground facing north-west, known as the Sugarloaf. The small size and height of the salient gave the Germans observation of no man&#x27;s land on either flank. The 5th Australian Division was to attack the left flank of the salient by advancing south as the 61st (2nd South Midland) Division attacked on the right flank from the west. Each division was to attack with three brigades in line, with two battalions from each brigade in the attack and the other two in reserve, ready to take over captured ground or to advance further. Haking issued the attack orders on 14 July, when wire cutting began along XI Corps&#x27; front. It was intended that the bombardment would inflict mass casualties on the German infantry, reducing them to a &quot;state of collapse&quot;. The British infantry were to assemble as close to the German lines as possible, no man&#x27;s land being wide, before the British artillery fire was lifted from the front line; the infantry would rush the surviving Germans while they were disorganised and advance to the German second line. Heavy artillery began registration and a slow bombardment on 16 July and two days of bombardment began either side of La Bassée canal as a diversion. The main bombardment was to begin at midnight on for seven hours (more rain forced a postponement). Over the final three hours, the artillery was to lift and the infantry show bayonets and dummy figures several times, to simulate an infantry advance, then the artillery was to resume bombardment of the front line to catch the German infantry out of cover.

===German preparations===
General Erich von Falkenhayn, the German Chief of the General Staff, had ordered a construction programme on the Western Front in January 1915, to make it capable of being defended indefinitely by a small force against superior numbers. An elaborate, carefully sited and fortified front position was built behind fields of barbed wire, with camouflaged concrete machine-gun nests and a second trench () close behind the front trench (), to shelter the trench garrison during bombardments. Communication trenches were built to evade Allied artillery-fire intended to obstruct the movement of reinforcements from the new rear defences. The front position was to be held at all costs as the main line of resistance but in May 1915, Falkenhayn ordered a reserve position to be built along the Western Front, behind the front position, out of range of enemy field artillery. To contain a breakthrough, the second position was to be occupied opposite a sector broken into and serve as a jumping-off point for counter-attacks. If the front line could not be recovered, the rear position could be connected to the remaining parts of the front line on either side to contain the break-in.

The construction programme was a huge undertaking and was completed in late 1915. The fortification programme had several opponents, notably the 6th Army commander Crown Prince Rupprecht, who claimed that a rear position would undermine the determination of soldiers to stand their ground. The front of the 6th Army had been quiet since the Battle of Loos (25 September – 14 October 1915) and in July 1916, the 6th Bavarian Reserve Division held a stretch of the front with four regiments, from east of Aubers village, north to a point near Bois-Grenier, each regiment having one battalion in the front line, one in support and one in reserve. On one regimental front there were with of concrete protection. After a British gas attack opposite Neuve Chapelle and Fauquissart late on 15 July, German artillery bombarded the British front line and a raid on the Australian lines by of Bavarian Reserve Infantry Regiment 21, caused nearly taking three prisoners, for a loss of 

==Attack==

===First Army===

Patrols during the night reported no movement in the German lines, which appeared to be weakly held. German covering parties stopped Australian raiders on the right flank of the 5th Australian Division front, where the wire appeared to be intact except on the left. It was hazy early on 19 July but the artillery zero hour was fixed for ready for the attack at A special heavy artillery bombardment began on the Sugarloaf at by which time a German counter-bombardment was falling all along the attack front, causing casualties to the Australians and the field gunners of the 61st (2nd South Midland) Division at Rue Tilleloy. Several ammunition dumps were exploded and the decoy lifts by the British artillery failed to deceive the Germans. The Australian and British infantry began to move into no man&#x27;s land at 

In the 61st (2nd South Midland) Division area, infantry of the 182nd Brigade on the right flank, began to move into no man&#x27;s land through sally ports but some were under German machine-gun fire and became death traps. Two companies of the right-hand battalion managed to get within of the German parapet, with few casualties, then rushed the breastwork as the artillery lifted, finding the wire cut and the Germans incapable of resistance. Uncut wire held up the advance to the second line and German machine-gun fire from the right flank caused many casualties as the survivors reached the objective. Reinforcements reached the front trench but German flanking fire caused many casualties and German artillery began to bombard the captured area. The left-hand battalion lost more men in no man&#x27;s land and then found that the wire at the Wick salient was uncut. The few infantry to get through the wire were shot down short of the front trench; reinforcements were also caught in no man&#x27;s land and pinned down.

In the centre, the 183rd Brigade was bombarded before the advance began and shrapnel shell-fire prevented the infantry from using the sally ports. After climbing the parapet, both battalions were shot down in no man&#x27;s land, only a few men got close to the German wire before being killed or wounded. On the left, the attacking battalions of the 184th Brigade had been in the front line under German artillery-fire all morning. On the right, the sally ports were under fire and only a few troops reached the German wire, finding that it was uncut, before falling back. The attack of the left-hand battalion towards the Sugarloaf salient (which was beyond trench-mortar range) was stopped by German fire on the sally ports; the British tried to exit along &quot;Rhondda Sap&quot;, which was under shrapnel bombardment. Most of the battalion was destroyed but some troops reached the north-east part of the salient and tried to enter the German breastwork; all became casualties.
On the 5th Australian Division&#x27;s front, the troops attacked over the parapet, suffering fewer casualties than the 61st (2nd South Midland) Division. The 15th (Victoria) Brigade advanced next to the British 183rd Brigade towards the junction of the German line and Layes Brook, which ran diagonally across no man&#x27;s land. The right battalion advance was stopped by machine-gun fire from the Sugarloaf after and the left hand battalion ran into uncut wire, both battalions suffered many casualties as the survivors dug in. In the Australian centre the 14th (NSW) Brigade had fewer casualties, reached the German front line and took a number of prisoners. When the Australians pressed on, they found only flat fields and ditches full of water. A line was selected for consolidation and ten machine guns were sent forward. The 8th Australian Brigade battalions attacked through machine gun fire from the front and flanks. A mine was blown on the outer flank to make a crater lip to screen the attacking infantry but when the Australians reached the German breastwork they kept going, finding the same terrain as the 14th Australian Brigade.

The 32nd Australian Battalion, on the eastern flank, suffered many casualties while attacking a German stronghold in the ruins of Delangre Farm and elements of the 14th Australian Brigade reached a main road south of the German line before withdrawing to the ditch. The 8th and 14th Australian brigades had gained their objectives, capturing about of the German front line. A line was selected for consolidation and a strong point built at the end of the , a German communication trench. Reinforcements with equipment and tools went forward and work began on a communication trench across no man&#x27;s land in the midst of a German artillery barrage and movement attracting machine-gun fire.

By accurate reports reached Major General Colin Mackenzie, commander of the 61st (2nd South Midland) Division, of the success on the right, along with erroneous reports of limited success in the centre and a small lodgement on the Sugarloaf on the left. At Haking ordered Mackenzie to attack the Sugarloaf again to assist the Australians, before it was discovered that the 184th Brigade had been held up short of its objective. The 15th Australian Brigade was asked to co-operate with the British attack and the 58th Australian Battalion was sent forward. A renewed bombardment continued as preparations were made to attack all along the front at when at Haking cancelled the attack and ordered that all troops were to be withdrawn after dark. Reinforcements for the 182nd Brigade received the order in time but the troops in the German line were overwhelmed, and only a few wounded and stragglers got away. Troops pinned down in no man&#x27;s land withdrew under cover of the bombardment and parties went out to rescue wounded. More discussion between Mackenzie and Haking led to the corps commander ordering the 184th Brigade to attack the Sugarloaf overnight, after a ten-minute hurricane bombardment; German shelling on the British front line then caused a postponement until the morning.
The postponement failed to reach the 58th Australian Battalion, which attacked with some of the 59th Australian Battalion and was stopped in no man&#x27;s land with many casualties, while survivors from three battalions found their way back after dark. Despite reinforcements, the situation of the 14th Australian Brigade in the German lines became desperate. Artillery fire and German counter-attacks from the open right flank forced a slow withdrawal in the dark. On the left flank, more troops were sent forward, with ammunition, to the 8th Australian Brigade at dusk and at every soldier who could be found was sent forward. Consolidation in the German lines was slow as the troops lacked experience, many officers had become casualties and there was no dry soil to fill sandbags, mud being a poor substitute. German counter-attacks on the front and flanks, with machine gun fire from Delangre Farm, De Mouquet Farm and the Tadpole, began at on 20 July, forcing a retirement to the German first line and then a withdrawal to the original front line; many Australians were cut off and captured.

News of the retirement by the 8th Australian Brigade reached McCay while at a meeting with Mackenzie, Haking and Monro, to plan the new attack by the 61st (2nd South Midland) Division. Monro ordered the 14th Australian Brigade to be withdrawn and at the artillery began a box-barrage around the brigade. At the order to retire arrived, although it was not received by some parties. German troops had got well behind the right flank and fired at every sign of movement, forcing the Australians to withdraw along the communication trench dug overnight. By the remnants of the 53rd, 54th and 55th Australian battalions had returned; many wounded were rescued but only four of the machine guns were recovered. Artillery-fire by both sides diminished and work began on either side of no man&#x27;s land to repair defences; a short truce was negotiated by the Germans and Australians to recover their wounded.

===Air operations===

From 14 July the Illies–Beaucamps road, behind the German front line, was kept under air observation by the Royal Flying Corps (RFC). On 16 July 16 Squadron joined 10 Squadron on the attack front along with a kite balloon section, bringing the I Brigade RFC squadrons supporting the attack up to three corps squadrons and two army squadrons. The corps aircraft photographed and reconnoitred the area before the attack and flew artillery-observation and contact patrols during the battle. Army squadrons flew further afield and denied German reconnaissance aircraft view of British troop movements, particularly behind the XI Corps front. On 19 July, aircraft from two squadrons patrolled the area towards Lille and had numerous air engagements, in which two Fokker E.Is and a British DH.2 were shot down. Bombing raids on German army billets, supply dumps and the railways from Lille to Lens, Douai, Cambrai and Valenciennes also took place.

===German 6th Army===
Opposite the British right, Bavarian Reserve Regiment 17 lost a switch trench facing Trivelet, a second line was overrun and the garrison was lost. Troops on the left of III Battalion to the south of the Trivelet road bombed to its right and part of I Battalion attacked frontally and from the right, taking On the Australian flank, III Battalion, Bavarian Reserve Regiment 21 was pushed back in the centre and on its right, forming a defensive flank at the and in front of Delangre Farm. The right flank of III Battalion, Bavarian Reserve Regiment 16 repulsed the 15th Australian Brigade and was then reinforced by the II Battalion from Rue Delaval, which joined with the left of III Battalion, Bavarian Reserve Regiment 21. A counter-attack ordered by the divisional commander at , fell into confusion in the dark, under British artillery-fire and an attack on the 8th Australian Brigade, by part of I Battalion, Bavarian Reserve Regiment 21 was stopped by Australian small-arms fire.
Later on, two other companies attacked up the as I Battalion, Bavarian Reserve Regiment 21 and half of Bavarian Reserve Regiment 20 attacked from the flank, reaching the old front line at on 20 July. The right flank of the 14th Australian Brigade was counter-attacked by most of I Battalion, Bavarian Reserve Regiment 16, which joined the II Battalion and recaptured the front line step-by-step until dawn, when a pause was ordered due to exhaustion and lack of ammunition and grenades. When the attack resumed, the troops met those of Bavarian Reserve Regiment 21 at around German artillery support was less extensive than that available to the attackers but managed to &quot;smother the British trenches with fire&quot; as the artillery of the 50th Reserve Division and 54th Reserve Division fired from the flanks &quot;thus the backbone of the British (sic) attack was broken before it left the trenches at &quot;.

==Aftermath==

===Analysis===

Neither division was well prepared for the attack; the 61st (2nd South Midland) Division had disembarked in France in late May 1916, after delays in training caused by equipment shortages and being milked for drafts to the 48th (South Midland) Division. The British entered the front line for the first time on 13 June and every man not due to participate in the attack spent from 16 to 19 July removing poison gas cylinders from the front line after the discharge planned for 15 July was suspended due to the wind falling; were removed before the work was stopped because the men were exhausted. The 5th Australian Division had arrived in France only days before the attack and had relieved the 4th Australian Division on the right flank of the Second Army by 12 July. The Australian divisional artillery and some of the heavy artillery had no experience of Western Front conditions and as I Anzac Corps prepared to move south to the Somme front, a considerable shuffling of divisions had taken place, which hampered preparations for the attack.

The limited nature of the attack quickly became obvious to the German commanders. A German report on 30 July, recorded that captured officers said that the Australians made a fundamental mistake in trying to hold the German second trench, rather than falling back to the front trench and consolidating. When the 15th Australian Brigade was pinned down in no man&#x27;s land, the continuity of the attack broke down and lost protection against flanking fire from the right, which enabled German troops to counter-attack, regain the first trench and cut off the Australian troops further forward. A German assessment of 16 December, called the attack &quot;operationally and tactically senseless&quot; and that prisoner interrogations revealed that the Australian troops were physically imposing but had &quot;virtually no military discipline&quot; and &quot;no interest in soldiering as it was understood in Europe&quot;.

A communiqué, released to the press by British GHQ, was not favourably received by the Australians. &quot;Yesterday evening, south of Armentières, we carried out some important raids on a front of two miles in which Australian troops took part. About prisoners were captured&quot;. Australian casualties and doubts about the judgement of higher commanders, damaged relations between the AIF and the British, with doubts about the reliability of British troops spreading in Australian units. In 2008, Jeffrey Grey wrote that McCay also made errors in judgement that contributed to the result, citing McCay&#x27;s order not to consolidate the initial gains and that poor planning, ineffective artillery support and Australian inexperience of Western Front conditions, contributed to the failure. A number of senior Australian officers were removed after the and the recuperation of the 5th Australian Division took until late summer, when it began trench-raiding. In October, the 6th Bavarian Reserve Division, with morale high after the defensive success at Fromelles, was sent to the Somme front and never recovered from the ordeal; Bavarian Reserve Regiment 16 spent ten days in the line and suffered .

In 2012, Michael Senior wrote that the objective of the attack was contained in the First Army Operational Order 100 (15 July),

Haking had ordered that the troops due to attack were to be told that

Senior wrote that historians generally judged the attack to have failed in its objective, to prevent German troops being transferred to the Somme. Wilfid Miles, the British official historian, wrote that the IX Reserve Corps and the Guard Reserve Corps had been moved to the Somme. Peter Pedersen wrote that the Germans knew that Fromelles was a decoy and sent reserves to the Somme; in the Australian official history Charles Bean wrote that the attack showed the Germans that they were free to withdraw troops. In 2007, Paul Cobb wrote that the Germans were not deterred from sending troops to the Somme. In his 2012 biography of Haking, Senior wrote that he had only consulted the official history volume &quot;Military Operations France and Belgium, 1916 part II&quot; for his earlier book and had changed his mind after studying German records. Senior wrote that there was evidence that the transfer of troops to the south was delayed by the attack on Fromelles. A German intelligence officer of the 6th Bavarian Reserve Division wrote on 20 July,

A Bavarian document discovered in 1923 contained information that

Charles Bean wrote in 1930 that the Bavarians might have been sceptical that the British would sacrifice as a decoy. The IX Reserve Corps and Guard Reserve Corps had been moved from the Souchez–Vimy area, from Fromelles, well outside the sector opposite the British XI Corps. Troops kept in the Loos–Armentières sector, opposite XI Corps, for four weeks after 19 July were held back as a precaution. German records showed that eight divisions were in the line between Loos and Armentières on 1 July and that two were sent to the Somme by 2 July, long before the Fromelles attack; the other six divisions stayed opposite XI Corps for five to nine weeks after 19 July. Had divisions moved earlier, the Battle of Pozières might have cost I Anzac Corps far more than the that it suffered. Senior concluded that because of the Attack at Fromelles, German troops had been retained opposite XI Corps as intended.

===Casualties===

The battle caused one of the greatest numbers of Australian deaths in action in 24 hours, surpassed only at the Battle of Bullecourt in 1917. The 5th Australian Division suffered in the 8th Australian Brigade, of the 15th Australian Brigade, in the 14th Australian Brigade and from the divisional engineers. Two battalions had so many casualties that they had to be rebuilt. Of from the 60th Australian Battalion, only one officer and ranks survived unwounded and the 32nd Australian Battalion suffered The 31st Australian Battalion had and the 32nd Australian Battalion lost The 61st (2nd South Midland) Division was understrength before the battle and contributed only half as many men as the 5th Australian Division and suffered The 6th Bavarian Reserve Division suffered casualties of Australian and British soldiers killed in the area that was re-taken by the Germans, were buried shortly after the battle. The burial pits were photographed from a British reconnaissance aircraft on 21 July but marked as dugouts or trench-mortar positions. On 22 July, the bodies were taken by narrow gauge trench railway and buried in eight pits.

==Commemoration==
===New cemetery===
Most war graves on the Western Front were discovered by official surveys during the 1920s; British and Empire dead were reburied in Imperial War Graves Commission cemeteries. Four hundred unidentified Australian soldiers killed in the Attack at Fromelles were re-buried at the V.C. Corner Australian Cemetery and Memorial, north-west of Fromelles (the only large exclusively Australian cemetery in France). Mortal remains of those killed in no man&#x27;s land were recovered after the war and buried at V.C. Corner British Cemetery. In 2002, Lambis Englezos was inspired by &quot;Don&#x27;t Forget Me Cobber&quot; (Corfield, 2000), to search for an unmarked mass grave near Fromelles. The site was found by Englezos and other researchers near Fromelles at , (Pheasant Copse/Pheasant Wood) (). The researchers believed that the pits had not been found after the war and gained support for an exploration of the site from the Australian Army and the British All Party Parliamentary War Graves and Battlefield Heritage Group.
In 2007, a geophysical survey was commissioned by the Australian government. The survey indicated that the pits had been undisturbed since the war and contained the remains of 337 soldiers. From 23 May to 13 June 2008, an exploratory dig found human remains, personal effects, webbing, brass fitments, uniform badges, buttons and .303 British ammunition in five of six pits, which were then refilled. Exhumations took place from May to September 2009, which recovered the mortal remains of approximately 173 being Australian, from whom DNA samples were taken.

The original burial site was unsuitable and a new CWGC war cemetery was built about away. On 30 January 2010, the first body was interred at Fromelles (Pheasant Wood) Military Cemetery and the remaining bodies were buried in individual ceremonies by the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers and the Australian Army. In March 2010, it was reported that soldiers killed at Fromelles had been identified from DNA. On 19 July 2010, the 94th anniversary of the battle, the last soldier (who remained unidentified) was buried. The cemetery was dedicated in a broadcast public ceremony.

===Memorials and museum===
There are several memorials in the Fromelles area commemorating the battle. The V.C. Corner Australian Cemetery and Memorial was built in the early 1920s, the Australian Memorial Park opened in 1998 and the Fromelles (Pheasant Wood) Military Cemetery was completed in 2010. There are other small cemeteries in the area with burials from the battle. In Fromelles Town Hall, there was a museum () run by the (ASBF). The plaque in it pays tribute to the pioneering work of Robin Corfield and Lambis Englezos in gaining wider attention to the battle and the loss of life of so many Australians, as well as British soldiers. To coincide with the unveiling of some new headstones, a new museum was opened in 2014 during an event at the cemetery to mark other soldiers whose remains have been identified.

===2016 memorial event controversy===

In 2016, plans to hold a memorial event at the Pheasant Wood military cemetery were announced with the controversial decision to exclude British attendees from the ceremony. The move provoked anger amongst some families of the approximately 1,500 British casualties,

The Australian Department of Veterans Affairs said that a decision has been made by the Australian Government to favour the Australians and French,

<doc id="1339248" wikidata="Q29328" url="?curid=1339248" title="Brie Larson">
<text>Brianne Sidonie Desaulniers (born October 1, 1989), known professionally as Brie Larson, is an American actress. She played supporting roles in comedies as a teenager, and has since expanded to leading roles in independent films and blockbusters. Her accolades include an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, and a Primetime Emmy Award. &quot;Time&quot; magazine named her one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2019.

At age six, Larson was the youngest student admitted to a training program at the American Conservatory Theater, and she began her acting career in 1998 with a comedy sketch on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;. She appeared as a regular in the 2001 sitcom &quot;Raising Dad&quot; and briefly dabbled with a music career, releasing the album &quot;Finally Out of P.E.&quot; in 2005. She subsequently had supporting roles in the comedy films &quot;Hoot&quot; (2006), &quot;Scott Pilgrim vs. the World&quot; (2010), and &quot;21 Jump Street&quot; (2012), and appeared as a sardonic teenager in the television series &quot;United States of Tara&quot; (2009–2011).

Her breakthrough came with a leading role in the independent drama &quot;Short Term 12&quot; (2013), and she continued to take on supporting parts in the romance &quot;The Spectacular Now&quot; (2013) and the comedy &quot;Trainwreck&quot; (2015). For playing a kidnapping victim in the drama &quot;Room&quot; (2015), she won the Academy Award for Best Actress. The 2017 adventure film &quot;&quot; marked her first big-budget release, after which she starred as Captain Marvel in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, beginning with &quot;Captain Marvel&quot; (2019). Larson has since starred in the miniseries &quot;Lessons in Chemistry&quot; (2023), for which she was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress.

Larson has co-written and co-directed two short films, and made her feature film directorial debut with the independent comedy-drama &quot;Unicorn Store&quot; (2017). For producing the virtual reality series &quot;The Messy Truth VR Experience&quot; (2020), she won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Interactive Program. A gender equality activist and an advocate for sexual assault survivors, Larson is vocal about social and political issues.

==Early life==
Brianne Sidonie Desaulniers was born on October 1, 1989, in Sacramento, California to Heather (née Edwards) and Sylvain Desaulniers, homeopathic chiropractors who ran a practice together. They have another daughter, Milaine. Her father is Franco-Manitoban; French was Larson&#x27;s first language. She holds dual citizenship of Canada and the United States. She was mostly home-schooled, which she believed allowed her to explore innovative and abstract experiences. Describing her early life, Larson has said she was &quot;strait-laced and square&quot;, and that she shared a close bond with her mother but was shy and had social anxiety. During the summer, she wrote and directed her own home movies in which she cast her cousins, filmed in her garage. At age six, she expressed interest in becoming an actress, later remarking that the &quot;creative arts was just something that was always in me&quot;. That same year, she auditioned for a training program at the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco, where she became its youngest student. She has said she wanted to become an actress after watching Jennifer Lopez in &quot;Selena&quot; (1997).

Larson&#x27;s parents divorced when she was aged seven. She had a dysfunctional relationship with her father, saying: &quot;As a kid I tried to understand him and understand the situation. But he didn&#x27;t do himself any favors. I don&#x27;t think he ever really wanted to be a parent.&quot; Soon after their separation, Heather relocated to Los Angeles with her two daughters to fulfill Larson&#x27;s acting ambition. They had limited financial means and lived in a small apartment near Hollywood studio lots at Burbank. Larson described the experience, &quot;We had a crappy one-room apartment where the bed came out of the wall and we each had three articles of clothing.&quot; Even so, she has recounted fond memories of this period and credits her mother for doing the best she could for them.

As her last name was difficult to pronounce, she adopted the stage name Larson from her Swedish great-grandmother, as well as an American Girl doll named Kirsten Larson that she received as a child. Her first job was performing a commercial parody for Barbie, named &quot;Malibu Mudslide Barbie&quot;, in a 1998 episode of &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;. She subsequently took on guest roles in several television series, including &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot; and &quot;Popular&quot;. In 2000, she was cast in the Fox sitcom &quot;Schimmel&quot;, which was canceled before airing when its star, Robert Schimmel, was diagnosed with cancer.

==Career==
===2001–2008: Early work and music career===
Larson&#x27;s first major role came as Emily, the younger daughter of Bob Saget&#x27;s character, in the WB sitcom &quot;Raising Dad&quot;, which aired for one season during the 2001–02 television schedule. Hal Boedeker of &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; criticized the program and wrote that its cast members were &quot;merrily joking through the show&quot;. She was next hired for the ABC sitcom &quot;Hope &amp; Faith&quot;, but she and some other cast members were replaced after an unaired pilot. In 2003, she starred alongside Beverley Mitchell in the Disney Channel film &quot;Right on Track&quot;, based on the junior drag race star sisters Erica and Courtney Enders, and played minor roles in the 2004 comedies &quot;Sleepover&quot; and &quot;13 Going on 30&quot;.

Larson developed an interest in music at age eleven when she learned to play the guitar. A music executive encouraged her to write her own songs, and she began self-recording and uploading tracks to her own website. After failing to get cast as Wendy Darling in the 2003 film &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, Larson wrote and recorded a song titled &quot;Invisible Girl&quot;, which received airplay on KIIS-FM. She soon signed a record deal with Tommy Mottola of Casablanca Records; she and Lindsay Lohan were the only artists signed by the label at the time. In 2005, she released the album &quot;Finally Out of P.E.&quot;, for which she also co-wrote songs with other songwriters, including Blair Daly, Pam Sheyne, Lindy Robbins, and Holly Brook. She titled it after a gym teacher she disliked and has said the songs she wrote were mostly about failed job opportunities. One of her singles, &quot;She Said&quot;, was featured on the MTV series &quot;Total Request Live&quot;, was listed by &quot;Billboard&quot; in their weekly listings of the most-played videos in the channel, and peaked at number 31 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Single Sales. Larson went on tour with Jesse McCartney for &quot;Teen People&quot;″s &quot;Rock in Shop&quot; mall concerts, opened for him during his Beautiful Soul tour, and also performed in New York City at the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade. Even so, the album was not a success, selling only 3,500 copies. Larson later admitted to being disillusioned with her music career, saying, &quot;I wanted to write all my own songs, and [the recording company] were afraid of that. I wanted to wear sneakers and play my guitarthey wanted heels and wind blown hair.&quot;

In 2006, Larson was cast alongside Logan Lerman and Cody Linley in the comedy film &quot;Hoot&quot;, about young vigilantes trying to save a group of owls. It received poor reviews, but Ruthe Stein of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; was appreciative of Larson and Linley for bringing &quot;a dash of Indiana Jones to their roles&quot;. She had a small part, the following year, in the Amber Heard-starring drama &quot;Remember the Daze&quot;, and she launched an arts and literature magazine, &quot;Bunnies and Traps&quot;, for which she wrote her own opinion columns and accepted submissions from other artists and writers. Larson has said she frequently considered quitting acting at that point, as she found it difficult to find much work, blaming it on filmmakers&#x27; inability to typecast her. She was particularly discouraged when she lost out on key roles in the films &quot;Thirteen&quot; (2003) and &quot;Juno&quot; (2007). To support herself, Larson worked as a club DJ.

===2009–2014: Independent films and breakthrough===
In 2009, Larson began playing Kate Gregson, the sardonic teenage daughter of Toni Collette&#x27;s character, coping with her mother&#x27;s dissociative identity disorder, in the Showtime comedy-drama series &quot;United States of Tara&quot;. Portia Doubleday was initially cast in the role but was replaced with Larson after filming the pilot episode. Reviewing the first season for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Alessandra Stanley took note of how well Larson played a &quot;real teenager&quot; and Tim Goodman of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; credited her for finding nuance in her role. Larson has said that her character&#x27;s journey to find meaning in life mirrored that of her own, and she was upset when the show was canceled after three seasons in 2011. Also in 2009, she starred alongside Rooney Mara in &quot;Tanner Hall&quot;, a coming-of-age film about four girls in boarding school. Despite disliking the film, Betsy Sharkey of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; commended Larson for providing &quot;one of the film&#x27;s funniest bits&quot;. In her two other film releases that year, she played a scatterbrained cheerleader in &quot;House Broken&quot; and a popular high schooler in &quot;Just Peck&quot;.

At the Williamstown Theatre Festival in 2010, Larson appeared in a stage production of Thornton Wilder&#x27;s play &quot;Our Town&quot;. Directed by Nicholas Martin, it featured her in the role of Emily Webb, a precocious young girl. Reviewing the play for &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, Louise Kennedy thought the production had glossed over the play&#x27;s darker themes and bemoaned the lack of tragic arc in Larson&#x27;s character. In film, she featured in Noah Baumbach&#x27;s comedy-drama &quot;Greenberg&quot; and Edgar Wright&#x27;s comedy &quot;Scott Pilgrim vs. the World&quot;. A journalist for &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; opined that these films helped raise her profile, and Larson has said the latter film, in which she played a rock star named Envy Adams, marked a turning point in her career. In it, Larson performed the song &quot;Black Sheep&quot; with the band Metric. Although it did not fare well commercially, &quot;Scott Pilgrim vs. the World&quot; has since developed a cult following. She next played the troubled daughter of a corrupt cop (played by Woody Harrelson) in the drama &quot;Rampart&quot; (2011), an emotionally intense part she found herself unable to detach from. A confrontation scene between Harrelson and her proved upsetting for her; the director was surprised by how well it turned out and tweaked the script to further explore the father-daughter relationship.

In 2012, Larson expanded into filmmaking by co-writing and co-directing the short film &quot;The Arm&quot; with Jessie Ennis and Sarah Ramos. The film, about societal expectations in the near future, won a special jury prize at the Sundance Film Festival. She featured as a seductive teenager in the critically panned drama &quot;The Trouble with Bliss&quot;, after which she played Molly, a high school student, in &quot;21 Jump Street&quot;, an adaptation of the 1980s police procedural television series, co-starring Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum. Larson found her acting style to be more rigid than Hill&#x27;s approach and was challenged by scenes that required her to improvise with him. Dana Stevens of &quot;Slate&quot; labeled Larson &quot;a find of major proportions&quot;, adding that &quot;she&#x27;s not only beautiful but funny, with a scratchy contralto voice, and unlike the usual female in a buddy movie, she comes across as a real person&quot;. With a worldwide gross of over $200 million, &quot;21 Jump Street&quot; proved to be Larson&#x27;s most widely seen film to that point.

Following an appearance in the sitcom &quot;Community&quot;, Larson collaborated with Dustin Bowser to co-write and co-direct &quot;Weighting&quot; (2013), a short film about a strained relationship, which was screened at South by Southwest. Larson&#x27;s breakthrough came in the same year when she starred in Destin Daniel Cretton&#x27;s critically acclaimed independent drama &quot;Short Term 12&quot;, which marked the first leading role of her career. Set in a group home for troubled teenagers, the film featured her as Grace, the emotionally distressed supervisor of the institution. To prepare, Larson interacted with staff in a children&#x27;s home and watched online interviews of people with similar jobs. The film had a production budget of under $1 million, and she was pleased with its intimate and collaborative work environment. Larson&#x27;s performance was acclaimed by critics. Manohla Dargis of &quot;The New York Times&quot; found her &quot;terrific&quot; and &quot;completely persuasive&quot;, and Ian Freer of &quot;Empire&quot; stated that she &quot;builds into a whirling dervish of a performance, making Grace strong but scarred, damaged but compassionate&quot;. Jenny McCartney of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; predicted that it would &quot;[mark] her out for a stellar career&quot;. Larson received a nomination for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Female Lead; she later remarked that the film prompted directors to offer her a wide variety of parts, but she turned down roles of the unidimensional love interest.

Also in 2013, Larson had supporting roles in two romantic dramas, &quot;Don Jon&quot; and &quot;The Spectacular Now&quot;. In the former, written and directed by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, she played the sister of Don Jon (played by Gordon-Levitt). Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; praised the film&#x27;s exploration of sexual themes and found Larson to be &quot;terrific&quot; in it. In &quot;The Spectacular Now&quot;, starring Miles Teller and Shailene Woodley, she played Cassidy, the ex-girlfriend of Teller&#x27;s character. Larson was drawn to the realism she found in the project&#x27;s depiction of high school experiences. Writing for &quot;New York&quot; magazine, David Edelstein called upon viewers to admire &quot;the shading and intelligence she brings to Cassidy&quot;. The 2014 crime drama &quot;The Gambler&quot;, based on the 1974 film of the same name, featured Larson as a literature student who has an affair with her professor (played by Mark Wahlberg), a gambling addict. The director Rupert Wyatt felt the role was underwritten and cast Larson to lend heft to it. Even so, Claudia Puig of &quot;USA Today&quot; wrote that the &quot;talented Larson is given little to do, other than react&quot;.

===2015–2019: Established actress===
Larson had three film releases in 2015. Her first appearance was in &quot;Digging for Fire&quot;, a largely improvised ensemble comedy-drama featuring Jake Johnson in the lead role. Filming took place without a script and Larson made several on-set decisions regarding her character&#x27;s choices, including the removal of a planned romantic subplot involving her and Johnson. She next played the sister of Amy Schumer&#x27;s character in the comedy &quot;Trainwreck&quot;, which was loosely based on Schumer&#x27;s own life. Larson modeled her role on Schumer&#x27;s sister, who served as an associate producer on the film. Tim Grierson of &quot;Screen International&quot; labeled the film &quot;a deft blend of laughs, romance and poignancy&quot; and found Larson to be &quot;lively, [but] slightly underused&quot;. &quot;Trainwreck&quot; grossed over $140 million against a $35 million budget.

Larson then starred in &quot;Room&quot;, a film adaptation of Emma Donoghue&#x27;s novel of the same name. It featured her as Ma, a young woman held in captivity, who bears a child of rape. The role proved physically and emotionally taxing for her, and she modeled it on her mother&#x27;s struggle as a single parent. A large portion of the film was shot inside a 10 ft × 10 ft shed created in a studio, and Larson prepared herself by spending a month isolated in her apartment. She interacted with specialists on sexual abuse and researched the lack of nutrition that a person in captivity would suffer. To achieve the look, she stayed away from sunlight, modified her diet, and exercised extensively to lose weight. Larson collaborated closely with co-star Jacob Tremblay, who played her son, and spent time performing activities that mirrored those of their characters. &quot;Room&quot; was critically acclaimed, with major emphasis on the performances of Larson and Tremblay. Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called her performance &quot;astonishing&quot;, stating that the &quot;reality and preternatural commitment she brings to Ma is piercingly honest from start to finish, as scaldingly emotional a performance as anyone could wish for&quot;. She won several awards, including the Academy Award for Best Actress, as well as a Golden Globe and BAFTA in the same category.

Following the success of &quot;Room&quot;, Larson played a leading role in &quot;Free Fire&quot; (2016), an action-comedy about a shootout in a warehouse. She agreed to the project to call attention to gun violence. Eric Kohn of IndieWire noted how different Larson&#x27;s role was from that in &quot;Room&quot; and added that her &quot;businesslike demeanor once again proves her ability to command a scene with a single glare&quot;. Commercially, the film failed to recoup its $7 million investment. She had filmed a part in Todd Solondz&#x27;s comedy &quot;Wiener-Dog&quot;, but her scenes were deleted from the final cut as Solondz found her character inessential to the story. The following year, Larson starred alongside Tom Hiddleston and Samuel L. Jackson in the second installment of the MonsterVerse franchise, entitled &quot;&quot;. Shot in Vietnam, the film featured her as a photojournalist in the 1970s. It marked her first mainstream big-budget release, and while she was glad to play a role not defined by her looks, she bemoaned the lack of female co-stars. Ann Hornaday of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; praised the film&#x27;s visual effects and remarked that &quot;Larson manages to hold her own with very little to do&quot;. &quot;Kong: Skull Island&quot; was a commercial success, grossing over $566 million worldwide.

Later in 2017, Larson portrayed Jeannette Walls in &quot;The Glass Castle&quot;, an adaptation of Walls&#x27; memoir, which reunited her with Destin Daniel Cretton. It tells the story of a young woman&#x27;s relationship with her nonconformist parents (played by Woody Harrelson and Naomi Watts). Larson was drawn to the complex depiction of a parent-child relationship and identified with its theme of forgiveness. She collaborated closely with Walls and her siblings and observed their mannerisms. Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; disliked the film&#x27;s sentimentality but noted that &quot;it is saved, just a little, by the robustness of Brie Larson&#x27;s presence&quot;. Also poorly received was the India-set musical romance &quot;Basmati Blues&quot;, a project she had filmed in 2013, which received criticism on social media for its white savior narrative. The 2017 Toronto International Film Festival marked the release of Larson&#x27;s feature film directorial debut, the comedy-drama &quot;Unicorn Store&quot;, in which she also starred. It was later picked for digital distribution by Netflix in 2019. She played a disillusioned art student fascinated with unicorns. Larson had unsuccessfully auditioned in 2012 to star in the film when Miguel Arteta was attached to direct. After the production was stalled, Larson was offered to direct and star in it. She was drawn to the fanciful narrative and found a connection between her character&#x27;s journey and her experience as a director. David Ehrlich of IndieWire disliked the film but took note of Larson&#x27;s potential as a filmmaker.

After a year-long absence from the screen, Larson starred as Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel in the Marvel Cinematic Universe superhero film &quot;Captain Marvel&quot; (2019), which marked Marvel Studios&#x27; first female-led film. She was initially skeptical about taking on such a high-profile role, but later accepted the part after viewing it as a platform to empower young women and found a connection with the character&#x27;s flaws and humanity. In preparation, she underwent nine months of judo, boxing and wrestling training, and interacted with service personnel at the Nellis Air Force Base. Stephanie Zacharek of &quot;Time&quot; wrote that &quot;Larson, a perceptive, low-key actor, carries the whole affair capably&quot; and took note of how much she stood out in the film&#x27;s quieter moments; David Sims of &quot;The Atlantic&quot; bemoaned the lack of depth in her role, but credited the actress for effectively portraying her character&#x27;s struggle for independence from authoritarian men. Larson reprised her role in &quot;&quot;, which she had filmed before &quot;Captain Marvel&quot;. &quot;Endgame&quot; grossed $2.79 billion worldwide to briefly become the highest-grossing film of all time, and &quot;Captain Marvel&quot; became the first female-led superhero film to gross over $1 billion worldwide.

Also in 2019, Larson teamed with Destin Daniel Cretton for the third time in &quot;Just Mercy&quot;, based on Bryan Stevenson&#x27;s memoir about death row inmate Walter McMillian&#x27;s wrongful conviction, starring Michael B. Jordan and Jamie Foxx. She agreed to take on the supporting part of Eva Ansley, an advocate for the Equal Justice Initiative, to lend her support to Cretton&#x27;s storytelling. Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Variety&quot; took note of how well she channeled her character&#x27;s &quot;antsy, cigarette-smoking defensiveness.&quot;

===2020–present: Brief hiatus and career expansion ===
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Larson took a break from acting, stating that the roles she was being offered were variations of the one she played in &quot;Room&quot;. Feeling the need to recalibrate, she instead focused on personal interests such as podcasting and vlogging. In 2020, she produced and appeared in an episode of &quot;The Messy Truth VR Experience&quot;, a virtual reality series created by Van Jones, for which they won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Original Interactive Program. In 2022, Larson reprised her role as Captain Marvel for the Disneyland Paris theme park ride &quot;Avengers Assemble: Flight Force&quot; and the Disney Wish cruise ship ride &quot;Avengers: Quantum Encounter&quot;. She collaborated with Disney+ on two projects. She created, directed and hosted the docuseries &quot;Growing Up&quot; and starred in the augmented reality short film &quot;Remembering&quot;. She also featured as the character Paradigm in the online video game &quot;Fortnite Battle Royale&quot;. At the 2023 Cannes Film Festival, Larson served as a jury member.

After a three-year hiatus, Larson returned to acting in the action film &quot;Fast X&quot; (2023), which marked the tenth installment of the &quot;Fast &amp; Furious&quot; series. &quot;Paste&quot; Kevin Fox Jr. opined that she &quot;shines when on screen, but feels wasted in a surprisingly small role&quot;. Larson once again played Captain Marvel in the superhero sequel &quot;The Marvels&quot;. It received mixed reviews from critics; its receipts were far less than those of &quot;Captain Marvel&quot;, and it emerged as a box-office bomb. She briefly voiced her role as Envy Adams in the animated series &quot;Scott Pilgrim Takes Off&quot;. Larson also served as the guest narrator at the 2023 Disney&#x27;s Candlelight Processional at Disneyland.

Larson hired producer Lee Eisenberg to develop &quot;Lessons in Chemistry&quot;, an adaptation of Bonnie Garmus&#x27;s novel of the same name. The miniseries, which released on Apple TV+ in 2023, is about chemist Elizabeth Zott who begins hosting a feminist cooking show in 1960s America. Serving as an executive producer, Larson spent two years working on the project, and was pleased by the rare opportunity to prepare for her character while the crew developed the show. &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; Ross McIndoe took note of Larson&#x27;s &quot;commanding presence&quot; and appreciated her ability to not turn Zott into a &quot;caricature&quot;. She received nominations for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress and Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Miniseries.
Larson made her West End debut in 2025 at the Duke of York&#x27;s Theatre in Anne Carson&#x27;s translation of the Sophocles play &quot;Elektra&quot;. To play the title role of the vengeful Elektra, she got a buzz cut. She said that she accepted the opportunity to engage with &quot;audiences who are not on their phones&quot;. &quot;Evening Standard&quot;″s Tim Bano dismissed the production as an &quot;impenetrable slog&quot;, but was appreciative of Larson for &quot;bringing layers of bitterness, resentment and desperation to the lines&quot;. Writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Houman Barekat was more critical, writing, &quot;Larson, for all her energy, has a weirdly perfunctory, one-note intensity&quot;.

==Advocacy==
Larson is a gender equality activist and an advocate for sexual assault survivors. She uses her celebrity to speak out on social and political issues, asserting in 2018, &quot;I&#x27;d put it all on the line and be an activist for the rest of my life because it doesn&#x27;t feel right to me to be quiet.&quot; By 2025, Larson became less assertive in expressing such opinions, declining to engage in these topics.

Following a performance by Lady Gaga at the 2016 Academy Awards, where several sexual abuse survivors appeared with the singer, Larson hugged all of them as they exited the stage. At the following year&#x27;s ceremony, she presented Casey Affleck with the award for Best Actor, but due to several accusations of sexual harassment made against him, she did not clap for him during a standing ovation from the audience. However, she did hug him; she later said her action &quot;spoke for itself&quot;. In 2018, Larson collaborated with 300 women in Hollywood to set up the Time&#x27;s Up initiative to protect women from harassment and discrimination. In the same year, she became one of the first actors to incorporate an inclusion rider provision in her film and press junket contracts. In a 2019 interview, she remarked upon diversity among film critics and journalists, finding them to be &quot;overwhelmingly white male&quot;, and supported diversity in the industry. This comment led to trolling and review bombing of the &quot;Captain Marvel&quot; page on Rotten Tomatoes.

In 2014, Larson teamed with Alia Penner to launch Women of Cinefamily, a monthly program to call attention to films directed by and starring women, for the nonprofit cinematheque Cinefamily, in which Larson served as an advisory board member. In the wake of sexual assault allegations against two of the company&#x27;s male executives, she released a statement in support of the victims and calling for action to be taken against the men. Larson joined the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 2016, and was later among the finalists for the organization&#x27;s board of governors. In 2017, she was one of several celebrities to raise funds for the Motion Picture &amp; Television Fund, a charity that offers assistance to elderly members of the industry, and co-hosted an event for the Women in Film organization, during which she urged filmmakers to be vocal against Donald Trump&#x27;s presidency. She took part in the Women&#x27;s March on Washington and condemned Trump&#x27;s policies on transgender rights. At the 2018 Women in Film Crystal + Lucy Awards, where she was honored, Larson bemoaned the lack of diversity among film reporters and called for better representation of minority voices in film criticism. She announced a twenty-percent quota for underrepresented journalists at the Sundance and Toronto International Film Festivals. In 2019, she guest-edited an issue of &quot;Stylist&quot; magazine and used the platform to bring attention to diversity and social inclusion. At the Women in the World Annual Summit, she spoke out against the gender pay gap in Hollywood. Also in 2019, &quot;Variety&quot; honored Larson for her work with the Equal Justice Initiative. In 2020, she endorsed the &quot;defund the police&quot; movement.

==Personal life and media image==
Larson is reticent to discuss her personal life, and refuses in interviews to answer questions that make her uncomfortable. On her desire to be private, she has said she fears being judged for her flaws, and that the privacy allows her to play a wide variety of roles without being typecast.

Larson began dating Alex Greenwald, lead singer of the band Phantom Planet, in 2013; the couple were engaged from 2016 to 2019. They had lived together in the Hollywood Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles. She credited Greenwald for creating a safe space for her and for empowering her to take risks in her work. In 2019, Larson was in a relationship with actor-filmmaker Elijah Allan-Blitz. In 2023, she stated that she was single, indicating that she and Allan-Blitz had broken-up.

Describing Larson&#x27;s off-screen persona, Holly Millea of &quot;Elle&quot; wrote in 2016 that she &quot;carries herself like an athlete, lean and solid, surefooted [and] yet her energy is warm and familial, literally embracing&quot;. The writer Anne Helen Petersen finds her to be &quot;incredibly warm&quot; and adds that she is &quot;a serious nerd, with the endlessly tunneling knowledge of a homeschooler&quot;. Jennifer Dickison of &quot;Porter&quot; states that Larson&#x27;s &quot;fully formed&quot; personality made it difficult to categorize her into a conventional slot. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; Claire Allfree wrote in 2025 that Larson can quickly transform from being friendly to &quot;prickly and unresponsive&quot;.

Larson has said she is interested in films that illustrate the &quot;human condition&quot; and which &quot;make people feel more connected to themselves [and] the rest of the world&quot;. She is drawn to roles that differ from her own personality and which involve themes of social activism. Fan Zhong of &quot;W&quot; magazine has identified a theme of &quot;sex appeal, inner torment, and a quick, playful wit&quot; in her characters, while Allfree believes that she specializes in roles that are &quot;marked by an unmistakable grit&quot;. Lenny Abrahamson, who directed Larson in &quot;Room&quot;, believes that her craft has &quot;none of that showy intensity that sometimes gets all the attention&quot; and has said that her &quot;awareness of tougher lives&quot; empowers her performances. Destin Daniel Cretton, who directed her in &quot;Short Term 12&quot; and &quot;The Glass Castle&quot;, has praised her ability to improvise, stating, &quot;I never know what&#x27;s going to happen, and often &quot;she&quot; doesn&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going to happen.&quot;

Larson maintains an active social media presence and uses it as a platform to share opinions and posts that she writes herself. In 2020, she started her own YouTube channel. She also hosted a podcast named &quot;Learning Lots&quot; alongside actress Jessie Ennis. Larson was featured by &quot;Forbes&quot; in their 30 Under 30 list of 2016 and was included by &quot;People&quot; in their annual beauty list in 2016 and 2019. In 2018, she was named among the best American actors under 30 by &quot;IndieWire&quot;. In 2019, Madame Tussauds New York unveiled a wax statue of Larson as Captain Marvel. In the same year, &quot;Time&quot; magazine named her one of the 100 most influential people in the world.

==Acting credits and awards==

According to the review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes, Larson&#x27;s most critically acclaimed films include &quot;Scott Pilgrim vs. the World&quot; (2010), &quot;21 Jump Street&quot; (2012), &quot;Short Term 12&quot; (2013), &quot;Don Jon&quot; (2013), &quot;The Spectacular Now&quot; (2013), &quot;Trainwreck&quot; (2015), &quot;Room&quot; (2015), &quot;&quot; (2017), &quot;Captain Marvel&quot; (2019), and &quot;&quot; (2019).

Larson has received an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award, and a British Academy Film Award, among other accolades, for her performance in &quot;Room&quot;. She also won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Original Interactive Program for producing the virtual reality series &quot;The Messy Truth VR Experience&quot; (2020).

<text>Mattimeo is a fantasy novel by Brian Jacques, published in 1989. It is the third book in the &quot;Redwall&quot; series. It is also one of the three &quot;Redwall&quot; novels to be made into a television series, alongside its self-titled novel (Season 1) and &quot;Martin the Warrior&quot; (Season 3).

==Plot summary==

===Slagar the Cruel===
&quot;Mattimeo&quot; is a direct sequel to &quot;Redwall &quot;and&quot; Mossflower&quot;, taking place eight seasons (two years) after the events of the first novel. The peaceful woodland creatures of Redwall Abbey are busy preparing for a feast during the summer equinox. Matthias and Cornflower have had a son named Mattimeo, who has been generally spoiled throughout his life by the inhabitants of Redwall. Meanwhile, the masked red fox Slagar the Cruel and his gang of rat and weasel slavers are planning to enter Redwall Abbey during one of their feasts. Slagar, a villainous fox craving revenge for a crime never committed against him, intends to capture slaves from Redwall and take them to an underground kingdom ruled by a mysterious, god-like figure named Malkariss to be sold as slaves. After drugging the Abbey residents, he kidnaps Mattimeo, Tim and Tess Churchmouse, Cynthia Bankvole, and Sam Squirrel. They meet Auma, (a young Eurasian badger maid) and Jube, (a common hedgehog), who were also kidnapped by Slagar the Cruel. Upon discovering the children missing, Matthias, Basil Stag Hare and Jess Squirrel with the help of a few friends, leave the Abbey to hunt down Slagar and return the children back home. They encounter Cheek, a European otter cub Matthias describes as &quot;Cheek both by name and by nature&quot;.
On their journey, they meet up with Orlando the Axe, the father of Auma, and Jabez Stump, the father of Jube. As they journey, they find the Guerrilla Union of Shrews in Mossflower (Guosim), and convince them to aid the travellers on their quest.

===General Ironbeak===
Meanwhile, at the Abbey, a horde of rooks, Eurasian magpies, and carrion crows led by the common raven known as General Ironbeak have come to conquer it. They instantly capture most of Redwall, starting from the top and working their way down. Then, Baby Rollo, Cornflower and Mrs. Churchmouse get kidnapped by the rooks, but the remaining Abbeydwellers manage to capture the Magpie brothers Quickbill, Diptail and Brightback with drugged strawberries, courtesy of Sister May. When the magpies went to forage for food for Ironbeak&#x27;s crew, they ate the strawberries. The two forces then negotiate a hostage exchange. After that, the Abbey&#x27;s residents take refuge in a basement called Cavern Hole, stocked with many supplies. Then Cornflower has an idea to dress up as a ghost and scare the rooks; they succeed, but General Ironbeak doesn&#x27;t fall for the trick. He traps Constance in the gatehouse, then slips his army through the barricade.

===Malkariss===
After a long journey up cliffs, fighting a horde of archer rats, and crossing a desert and a gorge, Matthias&#x27;s gang finally arrive at the underground kingdom of Malkariss, where Slagar has been trading his slaves. There, the heroes fight the massive army of rats, while Matthias frees the slaves held there and is reunited with his son. Then while they fight Matthias fights a large fiend called the Wearet and is thrown off a walkway into a pit where he confronts Malkariss who is revealed to be an ancient and somewhat repulsive European polecat. Malkariss is about to kill Matthias with his own sword when the tyrant&#x27;s slaves appear and destroy their master by pelting him with the stones and rocks which they had been using to build. Matthias frees the slaves and a great battle ensues during which Malkariss&#x27; kingdom is destroyed and his minions defeated. Later, Slagar reappears and kills Vitch, a rat slaver he worked with. Matthias and Orlando attempt to kill Slagar, who flees, only to plunge to his death down a well shaft.

The company return to Redwall after Stryk Redkite kills Ironbeak and his seer Mangiz and the woodlanders of Redwall send off the remaining ravens with iron collars around their necks.

The book ends with the residents of Redwall celebrating with a feast. Father Abbot declared the season Autumn of the Warriors&#x27; Return. The epilogue reveals that Tim had since become the abbey recorder (in an extract from his diary). Tess and Mattimeo had married, and Basil officially adopted Cheek (now bearing the title Cheek Stag Otter).

<doc id="1339265" wikidata="Q352820" url="?curid=1339265" title="Ray Wilkins">
<text>Raymond Colin Wilkins (14 September 1956 – 4 April 2018) was an English football player and coach.

Born into a footballing family with his father and three brothers involved in the game, Wilkins played as a midfielder. He began his career at Chelsea, where he was appointed captain at the age of 18, and later played for clubs including Manchester United, AC Milan, Queens Park Rangers and Rangers. He won 84 caps for the England national football team from 1976 to 1986, playing at UEFA Euro 1980 and the 1982 and 1986 FIFA World Cups.

After his playing career ended, he worked as a television pundit, and as a coach and manager with Queens Park Rangers, Fulham and Chelsea. He managed Jordan at the 2015 AFC Asian Cup and his last coaching job was as the assistant manager of Aston Villa later that year.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Born in Hillingdon, Middlesex, Wilkins started his career with the Sunday League team Senrab that play in Wanstead Flats, East London.

===Chelsea===
Wilkins made his name in the 1970s with boyhood club Chelsea, which he joined as an apprentice, progressing to his first team debut against Norwich City at the age of 17 on 26 October 1973 as a substitute in a 3–0 home league win.

In 1975, following the club&#x27;s relegation and the departure of many established players, an 18-year-old Wilkins was handed the captaincy of Chelsea by new manager Eddie McCreadie, taking it from long-time Blues captain John Hollins. He took to the role well, keeping it for four years. He emerged as Chelsea&#x27;s key player of that period, leading a team of mainly young players to promotion again in 1976–1977 and, in the next season, consolidation of their place in the First Division.

His elder brother, Graham Wilkins also played for Chelsea.

===Manchester United===
In 1979, after Chelsea were relegated, Wilkins signed for Manchester United for a fee of £825,000, the highest fee received for a Chelsea player at the time. He scored ten goals in his five years with the Red Devils, including a long-range strike in the 2–2 draw with Brighton &amp; Hove Albion in the 1983 FA Cup Final (United won the replay).

He was voted player of the year by the team&#x27;s supporters at the end of the 1983–1984 season. His midfield performances drew the attention of Milan, who made United a £1.5 million offer for the player.

===Milan, Paris and Rangers===
Wilkins signed with Milan in summer 1984. He later remarked that the most difficult part of adapting to the Italian game was the focus on fitness – the coaching staff made him work to reduce his body fat levels and Wilkins described the result as being in the best shape of his career. The Italian team was struggling during this period, having suffered relegation in the 1981–82 Serie A season, and Wilkins was joined by fellow Englishman Mark Hateley (himself replacing another compatriot — Luther Blissett). The only foreign players in the squad, the pair helped the team to victory over rivals Inter Milan in the Milan Derby that October, winning plaudits from Italian press and the club&#x27;s fans. In his first year there, Wilkins played 28 Serie A games to bring the team to fifth in the league and also won a runner-up medal in the Coppa Italia (having eliminated Inter in the semis).

The following season he remained a key player in Milan&#x27;s midfield, appearing in 29 league games and scoring two goals – one late goal to salvage a draw at Avellino and another goal the following game against Sampdoria. These were the only Serie A goals of his career. Overall, the team struggled for goals, with Pietro Paolo Virdis&#x27;s total of 13 making him the club&#x27;s only goalscorer in double figures that year. The club also suffered off the pitch, with owner Giuseppe Farina absconding to South Africa following accusations of bribery and theft.

In Wilkins&#x27; final season there (1986–1987), he fell out of the first team structure, following the signing of Roberto Donadoni and the continued presence of both Agostino Di Bartolomei and Alberigo Evani. The team finished fifth in the league, beating Inter twice, in Silvio Berlusconi&#x27;s first year as owner. Wilkins played 105 games (74 in Serie A) for Milan between 1984 and 1987. &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot; eulogised him as a &quot;serious and meticulous professional who was immediately appreciated for his long and precise passes&quot;.

Wilkins signed for Paris Saint-Germain in the middle of 1987, but this proved to be short-lived: he failed to break into the team ahead of Gabriel Calderón and Safet Sušić so he eagerly took the option to move to Scotland to sign for Rangers for £250,000 that November.

He made his debut for Rangers on 28 November 1987 in a 3–2 win over Hearts at Ibrox. He became an integral part of the team for the rest of the season, making twenty-nine appearances, which included both legs of the European Cup quarter-final against Steaua Bucharest. However, it would be the following season he would truly make his mark at Rangers. Reigning Scottish champions, and Old Firm rivals, Celtic played Rangers on 27 August 1988. With the score tied at 1–1, Wilkins scored a &quot;thunderous volley&quot; from the edge of the penalty box to put Rangers ahead, and his side eventually recorded an emphatic 5–1 win that day over their rivals. Rangers went on to win the league title that season, the first of their eventual nine-in-a-row. Wilkins also played in Rangers&#x27; win over Aberdeen in the 1988 Scottish League Cup Final. He remained an important team member into season 1988–89, playing in almost every game for the first half of the season, but his family wished to return to London. As such, he left Rangers in December 1989 to sign for Queens Park Rangers. Following his last appearance for Rangers, Wilkins received a standing ovation from the 40,000 crowd. Despite only playing two seasons for the Glasgow club, he was later inducted into their Hall of Fame.

===Later career===
The longest stint of his late career was at Queens Park Rangers, for whom he was a regular first team player from November 1989 to 1994, including the team&#x27;s first two Premier League seasons. He made his debut in the 3–0 away win versus Crystal Palace. Wilkins left QPR in the summer of 1994 on a free transfer to join Crystal Palace as a player-coach under manager Alan Smith, but only made one appearance due to breaking his left foot on his debut.

Wilkins re-joined QPR as player-manager on 15 November 1994, following the exit of Gerry Francis. The rest of that season was a success with the team finishing eighth in the Premiership. However the close season of 1995 saw the departure of Les Ferdinand to Newcastle and the following season the team struggled and were relegated. As player-manager, he appeared in a further 21 games for the club from 1994 to 1996. Wilkins left QPR by mutual agreement in September 1996 after the club was bought by media tycoon Chris Wright following their relegation from the FA Premier League.

Wilkins played for four clubs in the 1996–1997 season. He played one game at Wycombe Wanderers before moving to Hibernian for a 16-game stint. Toward the end of the season he played three times for Millwall in the Second Division and, finally, three Third Division games for Leyton Orient before retiring.

==International career==
Wilkins scored three goals in 84 games for England, captained the team on ten occasions, and played at the 1982 and 1986 World Cups. Wilkins was called up to play for England for the first time in 1976 by coach Don Revie, then made his debut on 28 May in a 3–2 win over Italy at the U.S.A. Bicentennial Cup Tournament in New York.

He achieved one of his career highs after helping England qualify for the 1980 European Championships in Italy — the first tournament England had reached for a decade. During a group game against Belgium, Wilkins scored a memorable goal when he lobbed the whole Belgian defence (thereby breaching the Belgians&#x27; obvious offside trap) and delivered a second lob, this time over the head of the goalkeeper and into the net to put England ahead. The Belgians swiftly equalised, however, and England failed to progress beyond the group stage.

Wilkins was a fixture in the England squad through a successful campaign to qualify for the 1982 World Cup in Spain, which England exited at the second group stage. Over the season 1983/84, Wilkins continued to play for England under new coach Bobby Robson but the team failed to qualify for the 1984 European Championships.

Wilkins remained an England regular during his spell at Milan and he was chosen for the squad which qualified for the 1986 World Cup in Mexico. He played in the opening defeat against Portugal. Wilkins became the first Englishman to be sent off at the World Cup in a goalless draw with Morocco in 1986, for throwing the ball at Gabriel González. The ball hit the referee having been thrown in protest at being deemed offside. He was suspended for the next two games and was not reinstated by the time the quarter-final against Argentina came round, a game which England lost 2–1.

Wilkins made his 84th and final England appearance in November 1986, against Yugoslavia.

==Coaching career==
===Early coaching career===
Wilkins was QPR manager from 1994 to 1996, and managed fellow West London club Fulham in 1997–1998. In March 1999, Wilkins was appointed Chelsea&#x27;s first-team coach after Graham Rix was jailed for child sex offences. Wilkins and Rix were Chelsea&#x27;s interim managers after the sacking of Gianluca Vialli at the start of the 2000–01 FA Premier League season, but both were sacked from the club on the orders of new manager Claudio Ranieri in November 2000.

When Vialli was hired by First Division club Watford, Wilkins again assisted him until their dismissal in June 2002. From 2003 to 2005, Wilkins assisted former Chelsea player Dennis Wise in his managing of Millwall, but announced his exit when he took exception at Dave Bassett being hired in the coaching staff.

===England U-21===
From 2004 on Wilkins was assistant coach to Peter Taylor with the England under-21s until Taylor left in early 2007. Wilkins was not retained by incoming head coach Stuart Pearce.

===Return to Chelsea===

In September 2008, Wilkins was appointed assistant first team coach to Luiz Felipe Scolari at Chelsea, following Steve Clarke&#x27;s departure to West Ham United. In February 2009, following Scolari&#x27;s shock sacking, Wilkins was appointed as Chelsea&#x27;s caretaker manager for the Fifth round FA Cup tie with Watford. Chelsea won the game 3–1, through a Nicolas Anelka hat-trick, with the club&#x27;s new manager Guus Hiddink watching from the stands.

On 11 November 2010, it was announced that Wilkins&#x27; contract with Chelsea &quot;would not be renewed&quot; and that he was to leave the club &quot;with immediate effect&quot;. On 1 December 2010, Wilkins reached what he described as a &quot;harmonious conclusion&quot; with Chelsea following his unexpected departure from Stamford Bridge. While appearing as a guest on Sky Sports Champions League coverage on 7 December 2010, Wilkins said that Chelsea still had not given him a reason for his sacking.

Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti, who was himself sacked at the end of the 2010–2011 season, wrote about Wilkins, in his autobiographical book &quot;The Beautiful Games of an Ordinary Genius&quot;: &quot;Ray is one of those select few, always present, noble in spirit, a real blue-blood, Chelsea flows in his veins ... without him we wouldn&#x27;t have won a thing.&quot;

===Later coaching career===
On 30 December 2013, Wilkins was appointed assistant head coach of Fulham. He and technical director Alan Curbishley were sacked on 17 February 2014 and the season ended with relegation.

On 3 September 2014, Wilkins was appointed as the new head coach of Jordan. He led Jordan at the 2015 AFC Asian Cup, where they were eliminated in the group-stages for the first time after two losses against Iraq and Japan and a win over Palestine.

On 25 June 2015, Aston Villa manager Tim Sherwood appointed Wilkins as his assistant manager. On 26 October 2015, Wilkins was sacked along with Tim Sherwood and the rest of the coaching team.

==Media==
In the 1990s Wilkins was part of the team that contributed to the Football Italia show that aired on Channel 4. Wilkins later appeared as a commentator for Sky Sports, particularly on their Champions League coverage. He also worked for Talksport. Wilkins was also featured as a commentator on the 1990s Tango soft drink commercials, &#x27;You know when you&#x27;ve been Tango&#x27;d&#x27;.

==Personal life==

The son of professional footballer George Wilkins, he had two sisters and three footballer brothers: Graham Wilkins (born 28 June 1955 in Hillingdon), a former professional, who played in the Football League as a full-back for Chelsea, Brentford, and Southend United; former Brighton &amp; Hove Albion manager and player Dean Wilkins; and Stephen Wilkins, who was signed by Chelsea and later made one appearance for Brentford, before playing for a number of non-League teams, including Dagenham and Hayes. Throughout his life, Wilkins was known by his childhood nickname of &quot;Butch&quot;.

Wilkins married Jackie (née Bygraves) in 1978. The couple had a son and a daughter.

He was a patron for the charity Cardiac Risk in the Young. In 1993, he was made an MBE.

In March 2013, he was stopped while driving and found to be &quot;nearly four times&quot; over the legal alcohol limit. In February 2014, he said that he had ulcerative colitis. In July 2016, Wilkins was given a four-year ban for drunk driving. In August 2016, he admitted he was an alcoholic.

==Death==
On 28 March 2018, Wilkins had a cardiac arrest, resulting in a fall, and was placed into an induced coma at St George&#x27;s Hospital in Tooting. He died at the age of 61 on 4 April 2018.

Hours after his death, Milan played rivals Inter Milan in the &quot;Derby della Madonnina&quot; at the San Siro. His former captain Franco Baresi laid a bouquet of flowers next to Wilkins&#x27; shirt by the side of the pitch. A section of Milan fans held aloft a banner which read &quot;Ciao Ray: Leggenda Rossonera&quot; (English: &quot;Goodbye Ray: Legend of the Red and Blacks&quot;). During Chelsea&#x27;s home game against West Ham United on 8 April, fans at Stamford Bridge gave a minute&#x27;s applause in the eighth minute to pay tribute to Wilkins. They also held a banner which read &quot;Ray was one those select few, he knew what it meant to be one of us a real blue blood. Chelsea flowed through his veins, may you rest in peace Ray.&quot;

A memorial service was held for Wilkins on 1 May at St Luke&#x27;s Church, Chelsea, attended by many figures from the world of football. His son made a speech about Wilkins&#x27; struggles with depression and alcoholism. On 19 May, his widow Jackie was the guest of honour at the FA Cup final between two of Wilkins&#x27; former clubs, Chelsea and Manchester United. Chelsea won the match 1–0 and she presented the trophy to Gary Cahill, the winning captain.

<text>Irit Linur (, born 1961) is an Israeli author.

==Biography==
Irit Linur was married to Alon Ben David, Senior Defense Correspondent for Israel Channel 10 and Middle East Correspondent for Jane&#x27;s Defence Weekly.

==Literary career==
Linur started her writing career as a satirical columnist in local newspapers. Her first full-length novel was &quot;The Siren&#x27;s Song&quot;, a best-selling romantic comedy set on the background of the Scud missile attacks on Tel Aviv during the Gulf War in 1991. In 1994, the book was adapted into a feature-length film directed by Eytan Fox. The title refers to the air-raid sirens which sounded almost every night during the six weeks of the war. It is the story of an assertive professional woman who experiences emotional growth and romance. At the same time, the book is critical of Tel Aviv&#x27;s superficial lifestyle.

Linur&#x27;s second novel, &quot;Two Snow Whites&quot;, is about a photographer who finds herself involved in a murder case. &quot;Sandler Ella&quot;, her third novel, depicts the glamorous life of media broadcasters. Her fourth novel, &quot;The Brown Girls&quot;, was adapted as a popular television mini-series. Linur has also published a book of humorous essays, &quot;The Secret Blonde&quot;.

Linur is a co-host on the radio show &quot;The Final Word&quot; on Galei Zahal, Israel&#x27;s Military Radio. The show would initially pair a liberal and a conservative who&#x27;d discuss current events, with Linur playing the liberal part. However, in recent years she has expressed views hostile to liberal groups and left-wing politicians in Israel. In 2002, during the Second Intifada, Linur wrote an open letter announcing that she had canceled her subscription to the Israeli newspaper &quot;Haaretz&quot;, criticizing the &quot;radical leftism&quot; and &quot;anti-Zionism&quot; of the newspaper as well as what she referred to as a &quot;pro-Palestinian bias&quot; on the part of &quot;Haaretz&quot; journalists Gideon Levy and Amira Hass.

In December 2017, Linur was suspended for seven days from her position as a commentator on Army Radio, after she criticized then-President Reuven Rivlin over his support for anti-corruption protests, referring to Rivlin as an &quot;insolent piece of work.&quot;

In April 2019, Linur apologized on the air after she and her co-host insinuated that a journalist&#x27;s wife, a public attorney, was the source behind his news reports concerning PM Netanyahu&#x27;s investigations.

In May 2019, referring to a protest that featured both Jewish and Muslim speakers, including Israeli Arab politician, MK Ayman Odeh, Linur commented on the air that the protest would have been better off, had Odeh been replaced by two gas station workers as the representatives of the Israeli Arab public.

In February 2022, speaking on the radio show &quot;The Final Word,&quot; Linur referred to Reform Judaism as &quot;an esoteric religious fringe movement that is unimportant, nonexistent, unpopular and unaccepted,&quot; comparing the Reform movement to Lev Tahor, an extremist Jewish sect. In response, a group of 150 Israel Defense Forces reserve officers, who were members of Reform congregations, sent a letter to then-Defense Minister Benny Gantz demanding Linur&#x27;s dismissal if she refused to apologize.

<text>John Henry Manley (July 21, 1907 – June 11, 1990) was an American physicist who worked with J. Robert Oppenheimer at the University of California, Berkeley before becoming a group leader during the Manhattan Project.

== Biography ==

He was born in 1907 in Harvard, Illinois. He graduated with a BS from the University of Illinois in 1929 and received his PhD in physics from the University of Michigan in 1934. He was a lecturer at Columbia University and later a professor at the University of Illinois from 1937 to 1942. He married Kathleen (Kay), and had two daughters Kim and Kathleen.

By the time World War II broke out, Manley was at the University of Chicago&#x27;s Metallurgical Laboratory. In 1942, his friend and colleague, J. Robert Oppenheimer, held a meeting with several leading theorists at UC Berkeley. The topic of the meeting: develop preliminary plans to design and build a nuclear weapon. Manley, one of the attendees, was tasked with learning more about the properties of fast neutrons.

Less than a year later, the center of the project had shifted to the Los Alamos Laboratory. Manley received a personal call from Leo Szilard to move to Los Alamos and on April 4, 1943, Manley arrived at the laboratory. Manley spent his first days in Los Alamos working with other newcomers on the construction of laboratory buildings. He also installed a Cockcroft–Walton generator, which he had brought with him from Urbana. Throughout the war Manley served as one of Oppenheimer&#x27;s principal aides, with particular responsibility for laboratory management. His wife Kay moved to Los Alamos in June 1943, following the birth of their second daughter. She was hired as a human computer in the T (Theoretical) Division but then quit after six months to focus on raising their children.

After the war, Manley left Los Alamos to serve as executive secretary of the general advisory committee for the Atomic Energy Commission, a federal agency charged with managing the nation&#x27;s atomic assets. After leaving the AEC, he returned to Los Alamos as assistant director for research. In 1946, Manley served as associate professor of physics at Washington University in St. Louis for a semester. From 1951 to 1957, Manley headed the physics department at the University of Washington. In 1959 he was named a senior technical advisor to the International Atomic Energy Agency. He retired in 1974, and died in 1990 in Los Alamos at age 82.

<doc id="1339280" wikidata="Q272410" url="?curid=1339280" title="1953 Atlantic hurricane season">
<text>The 1953 Atlantic hurricane season was an active season, with fourteen tropical storms, six of which developed into hurricanes; four of the hurricanes attained major hurricane status (Category 3 or greater on the Saffir-Simpson scale). This was the first season in which an official list of female names was used to name storms in the basin. The season officially began on June 15, and lasted until November 15, although activity occurred both before and after the season&#x27;s limits.

The strongest hurricane of the season was Carol, although by the time it struck Atlantic Canada it was much weaker. Both hurricanes Barbara and Florence struck the United States; the former crossed the Outer Banks and impacted much of the east coast, and Florence struck a sparsely populated region of the Florida Panhandle without causing much damage. Bermuda was threatened by three hurricanes within two weeks. In addition to the hurricanes, Tropical Storm Alice developed in late May and left several fatalities in Cuba. The final hurricane of the season, Hazel, produced additional rainfall in Florida after previous flooding conditions. The season&#x27;s last tropical storm, Irene, dissipated north of the Lesser Antilles on December 9.

== Timeline ==
== Systems ==
=== Tropical Storm Alice ===
A tropical storm developed east of Nicaragua on May 25, executing a counterclockwise loop over Central America. After weakening over land, Alice re-intensified over the western Caribbean, moving over western Cuba on May 21 with winds of 50 mph (80 km/h). On June 1, it entered the Gulf of Mexico, and later executed another loop off the northwest coast of Cuba. Alice quickly weakened due to a cold front, and advisories were discontinued by June 3. While near Cuba, Alice produced drought-breaking rainfall that caused flooding and several unofficial drowning deaths.

After passing near Cuba, Alice turned to the north and restrengthened to peak winds of , possibly even stronger to hurricane intensity. Alice again weakened before making landfall near Panama City Beach on June 6 as a minimal tropical storm, and dissipating shortly thereafter. Alice brought heavy rainfall to Florida, peaking at in Lake Placid. Near where it made landfall, the storm dropped light rainfall, and there were no reports of damage in the state. Alice was the first North Atlantic tropical cyclone to have a female name. It was also one of 22 tropical or subtropical cyclones on record in the month of May.
=== Tropical Storm Two ===

A tropical depression developed over southwestern Florida on July 11. It moved northeastward toward a trough across northern Florida. The depression intensified into a tropical storm on July 12 and reached peak winds of 45 mph (75 km/h). On July 15, the storm began interacting with a nearby cold front, signaling that it transitioned into an extratropical storm. On the next day, the storm brushed Nantucket with winds before the storm was absorbed by the front.
=== Hurricane Barbara ===
A tropical wave developed into Tropical Storm Barbara over the Bahamas on August 11. It intensified as it moved north-northwestward, becoming a hurricane by the next day, and reaching peak winds of 90 mph (150 km/h) just south of Cape Hatteras on August 13. Barbara moved over the Outer Banks, passing between Morehead City and Ocracoke, and it turned and accelerated to the northeast. Steadily weakening and losing tropical characteristics, the hurricane transitioned into an extratropical cyclone late on August 15. It turned northward, crossing eastern Nova Scotia and dissipating over Labrador on August 16.

Before Barbara struck the Outer Banks, officials ordered evacuations for a few islands, and several thousand tourists voluntarily left the region. Wind gusts reached at Hatteras and Nags Head. Torrential rainfall fell across the state and extended northward into Virginia, peaking at near Onley along the Eastern Shore of Virginia. Across the region, the hurricane left flooding and downed trees, some of which survived the Great Atlantic Hurricane of 1944. Monetary damage from Barbara was estimated around $1.3 million (1953 USD, $  USD), mostly from the crop damage. Newspaper reports indicated there were seven deaths in the country; two additional deaths occurred offshore Atlantic Canada when a dory sunk.
=== Hurricane Carol ===
On August 28, a tropical wave developed into a tropical depression near Cape Verde. After moving west-southwestward, it turned to the northwest, intensifying into a tropical storm on August 31 and into a hurricane on September 2. Passing northeast of the Lesser Antilles, Carol rapidly intensified to Category 5 intensity, reaching peak winds of 160 mph (260 km/h) on September 3, making it the strongest hurricane of the season. It gradually weakened, bypassing Bermuda on September 6 and producing high waves. Carol later turned to the north-northeast, brushing Cape Cod and causing boating accidents across New England. Four people were killed in the region. Fishing losses totaled around $1 million (1953 USD, $  USD).

After bypassing New England, Carol brushed western Nova Scotia before moving ashore near Saint John, New Brunswick as a minimal hurricane. As the storm moved ashore, it produced hurricane conditions in eastern Maine, one of only six Atlantic hurricanes to do so. In Nova Scotia, several boats were wrecked or washed ashore, with one drowning death reported. High seas caused coastal flooding, while strong winds downed large areas of trees. Heavy losses to the apple crop occurred in Annapolis Valley, totaling $1 million (1950 CAD, $  USD). Carol later dissipated southwest of Greenland on September 9.
=== Tropical Storm Five ===

On August 29, a tropical storm developed over southern Florida. While moving through the state, the storm dropped heavy rainfall, reaching at Fort Lauderdale Beach; similar rainfall was observed in the northern Bahamas. Described by one Weather Bureau forecaster as &quot;wide and flat&quot;, the storm gradually organized over the western Atlantic Ocean. On August 31, the storm turned to the northwest, with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (65 km/h). The system weakened to a tropical depression before moving ashore near Savannah, Georgia on September 1. It dissipated that day over land.
=== Hurricane Dolly ===

The origins of Dolly were from a tropical wave that moved through the eastern Caribbean Sea, producing in Saint Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The rains closed schools and government buildings around San Juan, Puerto Rico, and flooding was reported in Guayama, Yabucoa, and Patillas. On September 8, a tropical storm developed north of Puerto Rico, which moved slowly west-southwestward before turning to the north. It quickly intensified, and after Hurricane Hunters reported an eye, Dolly reached hurricane status on September 9. At that time, hurricane warnings were issued in the Bahamas, although the storm turned away from the archipelago. It intensified to peak winds of 75 mph (120 km/h) on September 10, as reported by aircraft.

Dolly weakened as it accelerated northeastward, although it still threatened to strike Bermuda with strong winds. As a result, the United States Air Force ordered all of the planes on the island to fly to the mainland. After continued weakening, Dolly passed over the island on September 11, producing only gale-force winds, rains, and little to no damage. It deteriorated into a tropical storm on September 12 and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone later that day. The remnants of Dolly later turned eastward, dissipating just west of Portugal on September 17.
=== Hurricane Edna ===

Shortly behind Dolly, another tropical wave spawned a tropical depression over the Lesser Antilles on September 15. As it moved through the region, it produced unsettled conditions across the northeast Caribbean. Edna quickly intensified as it tracked northwestward, attaining hurricane status on September 15 and peak winds of 115 mph (185 km/h) the next day. After peaking, the hurricane turned to the northeast and maintained most of its intensity for a few days. It passed just north of Bermuda early on September 18 with winds of 115 mph (185 km/h), before beginning a steady weakening trend as it accelerated. By September 19, Edna completed the transition into an extratropical cyclone, lasting another day before dissipating west of Ireland.

Before Edna struck Bermuda, the islanders were well-prepared due to being previously impacted by hurricanes Carol and Dolly, and they boarded up their homes. The hurricane caused &quot;considerable damage&quot;, with wind gusts reaching . The winds downed trees, blocking roads, and also caused disruptions to the power and water services. During its passage, Edna produced heavy rainfall and also damaged several roofs. There were three injuries on the island.
=== Tropical Storm Eight ===

A tropical depression formed in the central Gulf of Mexico on September 15 and moved northeastward. The storm produced heavy seas across the region, which damaged two small boats. The storm reached peak winds of 50 mph (75 km/h) while moving in a small clockwise loop southeast of Louisiana. The storm weakened into a tropical depression on September 17, but re-intensified to a tropical storm three days later. On September 20, the storm moved ashore in Taylor County, Florida and dissipated the next day over the state, bringing of rainfall to coastal areas.
=== Hurricane Florence ===
Florence developed on September 23 near Jamaica from a tropical wave. While passing that island, it produced heavy rainfall that blocked roads. It intensified to hurricane status on September 24 while passing through the Yucatán Channel, and while doing so left heavy damage in western Cuba. After turning north and entering the Gulf of Mexico, Florence quickly intensified to peak winds of 115 mph (185 km/h). It gradually weakened before making landfall on September 26 as a minimal hurricane in a sparsely populated region of the Florida Panhandle.

Before Florence hit the United States Gulf Coast, about 10,000 people evacuated Panama City, Florida, and the Weather Bureau issued timely warnings that was credited in preventing any deaths or major injuries. Winds reached at Eglin Air Force Base, and the heaviest rainfall was in Lockhart, Alabama. The combination of winds and heavy rainfall left crop damage in the Florida panhandle and southeastern Alabama, although coastal damage was not severe. Overall, 421 houses were damaged and another three were destroyed, with monetary damage estimated around $200,000 (1953 USD, $  USD). After landfall, Florence quickly transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, and as it continued across the southeastern United States it produced moderately heavy rainfall. It dissipated on September 28 southeast of New England.
=== Hurricane Gail ===

On October 2, a tropical wave spawned a tropical depression about 815 mi (1310 km) west-southwest of the Cape Verde islands. The depression quickly intensified into Tropical Storm Gail, and the next day, a ship encountered the storm, reporting a minimum pressure of 986 mbar (29.12 inHg). As the ship crossed through the center, it reported winds of 80 mph (130 km/h), indicating Gail attained hurricane status. Initially, the Weather Service believed that Gail dissipated and a new storm formed in the same region on October 5, but a reanalysis in 2015 indicated that they were the same storm. The confusion resulted from Gail turning to the northeast on October 4, steered by an approaching trough. On October 6, Gail turned back to the west-northwest, remaining a moderate tropical storm for several days. On October 11, the cold front that absorbed Hurricane Hazel turned Gail to the north, and absorbed it the next day in the central Atlantic.
=== Tropical Storm Eleven ===

On October 3, a tropical storm developed near the southern coast of Cuba. It moved northwestward, crossing the island before turning to the northeast. Early on October 5, the storm brushed southeastern Florida, producing gusty winds and rainfall. The threat of the storm prompted small craft warnings from the Florida Keys through South Carolina. As it accelerated northeastward, the storm strengthened slightly to maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (75 km/h), before becoming extratropical on October 6. Two days later, the remnants moved over Atlantic Canada with winds of 70 mph (120 km/h), producing flooding rainfall that washed out several roads. The storm caused two deaths after it wrecked a boat in Broad Cove, Nova Scotia. Later, the cyclone passed south of Greenland before dissipating southwest of Iceland on October 10.
=== Hurricane Hazel ===

The twelfth tropical storm and the final hurricane of the season formed in the Yucatán Channel on October 7. Given the name Hazel, the storm tracked north-northeastward, then northeastward through the Gulf of Mexico while gradually intensifying. On October 9, Hazel strengthened into a hurricane and made landfall just north of Fort Myers, Florida at its peak intensity of 85 mph (140 km/h). The storm crossed the state in about six hours, during which it weakened slightly back to a tropical storm. Over the western Atlantic Ocean, Hazel re-intensified to its peak winds, although by late on October 10 it transitioned into an extratropical storm between North Carolina and Bermuda. The remnants continued northeastward, dissipating southeast of Newfoundland on October 12. On Sable Island, the storm produced heavy winds and rain.

Due to the fairly light winds across Florida, damage from Hazel was minor, estimated around $250,000 (1953 USD, $  USD). During its passage, the storm spawned a tornado in St. James City that destroyed several homes, and there were indications of another tornado in Okeechobee City. The primary impact from Hazel was from its rainfall, peaking at in Daytona Beach. The rains added to previous flooding conditions across the state, causing a record flood stage along the St. Johns River that flooded of highway. Overall flooding damage was estimated up to $10 million (1953 USD, $  USD), but it was impossible to determine how much was due to Hazel.
=== Tropical Storm Thirteen ===

A tropical storm developed from a dissipating cold front on November 23, about 460 mi (740 km) northeast of Barbuda in the Lesser Antilles. It moved northeastward, strengthening to peak winds of 50 mph (85 km/h) on November 24. It later turned sharply to the west as it began a weakening trend, followed by a curve to the north. The cyclone dissipated on November 26 about 450 mi (725 km) east-northeast of Bermuda, without ever affecting land.
=== Tropical Storm Irene ===
The final tropical cyclone of the season developed on December 7 about 705 mi (1735 km) east-northeast of the Lesser Antilles, from the end of a dissipating cold front. Given the name &quot;Irene&quot;, the storm moved to the northwest and later to the west. Based on ship observations, it is estimated that Irene intensified to a peak of 65 mph (100 km/h) on December 8, before weakening the next day. Late on December 9, Irene dissipated about 270 mi (435 km) north of the Lesser Antilles.
== Storm names ==

The following list of names was used for named storms that formed in the North Atlantic in 1953. This was the first season in which systems that attained at least tropical storm status were given female names. This list was used again the following season, except for &quot;Gail&quot;, which was replaced with &quot;Gilda&quot;, due to the former name&#x27;s confusion with the term gale.

<doc id="1339341" wikidata="Q117482" url="?curid=1339341" title="Ingénue">
<text>The ingénue (, , ) is a stock character in literature, film and a role type in the theater, generally a girl or a young woman, who is endearingly innocent. &quot;Ingénue&quot; may also refer to a new young actress or one typecast in such roles. The term comes from the feminine form of the French adjective meaning &quot;ingenuous&quot; or innocent, virtuous and candid. The term may also imply a lack of sophistication and cunning.

Typically, the &quot;ingénue&quot; is beautiful, kind, gentle, sweet, virginal and often naïve; additionally, she is often in mental, emotional, or even physical danger—usually a target of the cad, whom she may have mistaken for the hero. The &quot;ingénue&quot; usually lives with her father, husband, or a father figure. The vamp (femme fatale) is often a foil for the &quot;ingénue&quot; (or the damsel in distress).

The &quot;ingénue&quot; is often accompanied by a romantic side plot. This romance is usually considered pure and harmless to both participants. In many cases, the male participant is as innocent as the &quot;ingénue&quot;. The &quot;ingénue&quot; is also similar to the girl-next-door stereotype.

In opera and musical theater, the &quot;ingénue&quot; is usually sung by a lyric soprano. The &quot;ingénue&quot; usually has the fawn-eyed innocence and sometimes subtle sexual appeal.

<doc id="1339343" wikidata="Q1226371" url="?curid=1339343" title="Ding Yuan">
<text>Ding Yuan () (died 26 September 189), courtesy name Jianyang, was a Chinese politician and warlord who lived during the late Eastern Han dynasty of China. In 189, both he and Dong Zhuo were summoned into the capital Luoyang with their individual troops to assist in the struggle against the powerful eunuch faction. However, Ding Yuan was eventually killed by his trusted aide Lü Bu, who had been bought over by Dong Zhuo.

==Life==
According to the &quot;Records of Heroes&quot; (英雄記) by Wang Can, Ding Yuan was born in a poor family. Uncouth but brave, he was adept in horse riding and archery. During his early career as a county magistrate, he never turned away from his responsibility no matter the adversity or risk. He always pitched himself in front during confrontations with fugitive criminals and bandits. In 188, the Chuge and their Southern Xiongnu allies rebelled in Bing province (并州; present-day Shanxi) and killed the provincial inspector, Zhang Yi (張懿). Ding Yuan was appointed the new Inspector of Bing province, and it was around this time when he met Lü Bu. The martial prowess of the young warrior greatly impressed Ding Yuan, who made him Chief Secretary and kept him close at side.

In May 189, Emperor Ling died. The General-in-Chief He Jin then summoned Ding Yuan into the capital Luoyang with his regional troops to assist in the power struggle against the eunuch faction. Before Ding Yuan arrived, however, the eunuchs assassinated He Jin. Dong Zhuo, a warlord from Liang Province (涼州; present-day western Gansu) who was also summoned by He Jin, arrived in Luoyang ahead of Ding Yuan and defeated the eunuchs, grasping military control of the capital.

After Ding Yuan arrived, Dong Zhuo managed to buy over Lü Bu, who killed Ding Yuan and presented the latter&#x27;s head to Dong Zhuo.

==In &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;==
The 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; is a romanticisation of the events that occurred before and during the Three Kingdoms period of China. In Chapter 3, Ding Yuan becomes a rival of Dong Zhuo after he opposes the latter&#x27;s plan to depose Emperor Shao in favour of Emperor Xian. However, Dong Zhuo refrains from killing Ding Yuan on the spot because Ding Yuan&#x27;s foster son, the formidable warrior Lü Bu, is protecting him.

Li Su, an official under Dong Zhuo who is from the same commandery as Lü Bu, then volunteers to persuade Lü Bu to defect to Dong Zhuo&#x27;s side. Bringing along a famous steed named Red Hare and other extravagant gifts, he meets Lü Bu at his camp outside the city. Attracted by the gifts and feeling convinced by Li Su, Lü Bu agrees to betray his foster father and defect to Dong Zhuo&#x27;s side. That very night, Lü Bu barges into Ding Yuan&#x27;s tent, decapitates him and brings his head as a present to Dong Zhuo the following day.

<text>Rodney Desborough Slater (born 8 November 1941 in Crowland, Lincolnshire) is a member of the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band, playing saxophones and other musical instruments (particularly winds).

== Career ==

=== Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band ===

He was a founder member of the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band. The band was officially formed on 25 September 1962, at Slater’s home at 164c Rosendale Road, West Dulwich, when Vivian Stanshall and Rodney met and quickly bonded, after being introduced by Slater&#x27;s flatmate Tom Parkinson. At the time, Slater was already playing in a traditional jazz band at college with Parkinson on sousaphone, and Chris Jennings on trombone. 

In the 2004 BBC Four documentary &quot;Vivian Stanshall: The Canyons of His Mind&quot;, Slater claims that the name was inspired by playing a Dadaist word game using cut-up technique, which involves writing words or phrases on paper, tearing the paper into strips and then randomly re-assembling the strips to form new phrases. One of the phrases created was &quot;Bonzo Dog Dada Band&quot;: Bonzo Dog after Bonzo the dog, a popular British cartoon character created by artist George Studdy in the 1920s, and Dada after the early 20th-century art movement. Vivian would then say shortly after that he wanted to form a band with Slater with that name, although sometime after, “Dada” changed to “Doo-Dah”. The “Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band” was formed by Stanshall, Slater, and Chris Jennings, to name a few.

He was a core member of the band, and performed on their top five hit &quot;I&#x27;m the Urban Spaceman&quot; and on all subsequent recordings except 1972&#x27;s Let&#x27;s Make Up And Be Friendly. The Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band appeared in the Beatles&#x27; 1967 TV film Magical Mystery Tour and also in the ground-breaking ITV television series &quot;Do Not Adjust Your Set&quot;, which featured future Monty Python members Eric Idle, Terry Jones and Michael Palin. At the time, Slater owned a pet parrot, a pet that Vivian adored, so, Stanshall wrote the song Mr. Slater&#x27;s Parrot, in 1970. 

Slater appeared with the band when they reformed in 2006 performing with them at various shows over the next few years. He was also active in a side project “Three Bonzos and a Piano” with fellow Bonzos Roger Ruskin Spear and Sam Spoons as well as keyboard player Dave Glasson, Andy Roberts on guitar and occasionally &#x27;Legs&#x27; Larry Smith.

=== &quot;Parrotopia!&quot; ===
In August 2017 Rodney Slater&#x27;s Parrots released his debut album &quot;Parrotopia!&quot;, which contained music, dialogue and recitations. The album contains his first works as a writer.

<text>The Minnesota Road Research Facility (also known as MnROAD, pronounced &quot;Min-road&quot;), is an outdoor research laboratory operated by the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) that specializes in testing different types of pavement. Said to be the largest such facility in the world, it is located northwest of Minneapolis-St. Paul near the town of Albertville along Interstate 94 (I-94). Minnesota is a good site for such a project, as the state experiences some of the largest seasonal swings in temperature in the United States, and has a spring freeze–thaw cycle that can heavily damage roadways. More than 4,500 sensors are embedded in and under the road surfaces to measure stresses while the test segments are in use. The facility was constructed from 1990 through 1993 at a cost of $25 million and opened in 1994. It earned an Award of Merit in the Federal Highway Administration&#x27;s 1996 &quot;Excellence in Highway Design&quot; competition.

A stretch of the Interstate is redirected onto test pavement at the site, and a test track simulating a low-volume rural roadway loops through the facility. Real highway traffic is used for this mainline test area, but traffic is simulated on the low-volume road by a semi-trailer truck. A bypass is available to shift traffic off the mainline testing area so researchers can closely examine the pavement without disrupting flow on the highway.

Many different organizations have partnered with Mn/DOT to conduct research at the facility, ranging from partners such as the University of Minnesota, Federal Highway Administration, and Wisconsin Department of Transportation to others like the National Road Administration of Finland.

<text>Garut Regency is a Regency in the West Java province of Indonesia. It covers an area of 3,065.19 km2 (1,186.91 mi2). Geographically, it lies between 6°5734 – 7°4457 South latitude and 107°2434 – 108°734 East longitude. The population at the 2010 census was 2,404,121, and at the 2020 census was 2,585,607; the official estimate as at mid 2023 was 2,683,665 (comprising 1,372,689 males and 1,310,976 females). South Tarogong (&quot;Tarogong Kidul&quot;) is the regency seat.

==Adjacent regencies==
It is bordered by: 
* Eastern side: Tasikmalaya Regency
* Western side: Cianjur Regency and Bandung Regency
* Northern side: Sumedang Regency
* Southern side: Indian Ocean

==Geography==
In general, Garut has a cool but tropical climate, with an average temperature of 24 °C (76 °F). Average annual rainfall is 2,590 mm (102 inches). This area includes valley territory surrounded by volcanoes (Mount Karacak: 1,838 m, Mount Cikuray: 2,821 m, Mount Guntur: 2,249 m, Mount Papandayan: 2,622 m) on the northern side, with average heights of 700–750 m above sea level. Streams of solidified lava are present on their slopes.

==Administrative districts==
Garut Regency is currently divided into 42 districts (&quot;kecamatan&quot;), listed below with their areas and populations at the 2010 and 2020 censuses, together with the official estimates as at mid 2023. The table also includes the locations of the district administrative centres, the number of villages in each district (totaling 421 rural &quot;desa&quot; and 21 urban &quot;kelurahan&quot;), and its post code. 

However, in 2013 the National Legislative Council approved a proposal to create a new Regency - South Garut Regency (&quot;Kabupaten Garut Selatan&quot;) - to include the 16 southernmost districts (those listed first in the table below) of the existing Garut Regency, with a combined population of 694,740 in mid 2023. The new Regency would thus inherit 63% of the land area of the existing regency, but only 26% of its population in mid 2023. As at 2024, this proposal has not yet been implemented, but for convenience the table below has been split to distinguish those districts in the proposed South Garut Regency.

Note: (a) comprising 5 urban &quot;kelurahan&quot; (Jayawaras, Pataruman, Sukagalih, Sukajaya and Sukakarya) and 7 rural &quot;desa&quot;. (b) including one &quot;kelurahan&quot; (Pananjung). &lt;br&gt;(c) comprising all 11 &quot;kelurahan&quot; (Cimuncang, Ciwalen, Kota Kulon, Kota Wetan, Margawati, Muara Sanding, Pakuwon, Paminggir, Regol, Sukamantri and Sukanegla). &lt;br&gt;(d) comprising 4 &quot;kelurahan&quot; (Karangmulya, Lebakjaya, Lengkongjaya and Sucikaler) and 16 &quot;desa&quot;. (e) except the &quot;desa&quot; of Cangkuang, which has a post code of 44119.

Administratively, the 42 districts are subdivided into 442 villages, comprising 421 rural &quot;desa&quot; and 21 urban &quot;kelurahan&quot;. Cibalong District is the largest district and covers 6.97% of the area of all Garut Regency districts, while the Kersamanah District is the smallest, with an area of 1,650 ha or 0.54%. Garut constitutes the buffer land and hinterland for the development of Bandung Raja&#x27;s territory. It has a strategic position and acts as the supplier for the needs of Bandung Municipality and Bandung Regency&#x27;s populations.

The Garut Regency has two distinct topographical areas:
*Northern Garut consists of highlands and mountainous terrain, which have the largest rice fields of Garut
*Southern Garut is mostly made out of downward sloping lands, along with twelve main rivers which flow south into the Java Trench, an area of oceanic crust near the southern coast of Java that is part of the larger Indian Ocean.

Tourist resorts are well-established in Garut Regency, with coastal views, and others with craters, waterfalls, lakes and a hot springs.

==History==

On March 2, 1811, the Balubur Limbangan Regency was defeated by Governor General Herman W. Daendels (of the Dutch Colonial Army), and Regent Tumenggung Wangsakusumah II resigned. Balubur Limbangan Regency then comprised 6 districts: Balubur, Malangbong, Wanaraja, Wanakerta, Cibeureum and Papandak.

On February 16, 1813, a new Limbangan Regency was founded by Lt. Governor Sir Stamford Raffles which became Garut Regency. R.A.A. Adiwijaya was the first Regent of Garut Regency. He governed from 1813 until 1821. He was well known for his call of Dalem Cipeujeuh.

==Localities==

*Garsela
*Sindangratu

==Local produce==
Land fertility varies greatly because of influence by mountains, rivers and coastal lowlands. As a result, agricultural businesses are primarily plantation-based, as well as subsistence farming and animal husbandry, followed by forest resources.

Some known products from Garut are:
* Garut Orange fruits (&quot;Jeruk Garut&quot;)
* Mangdogars Handycraft &quot;Mang Dogar&quot; as Garut Icon likes ornament, dolls, souvenir, clothes
* Garut Lamb (&quot;Domba Garut&quot;)
* Dodol Garut (a snack)
* Vetiver Root Oil (&quot;Andropogon zizanioides&quot;)
* Batik Tulis Garutan (hand painted clothes)
* Silk clothes
* Gemstones
* Leather crafts
* Bamboo crafts

==Tourism in Garut==
Garut is known as &quot;Zwitserse van Java&quot; (Switzerland of Java). It has so many tourist attractions divided into several tourism zone units (Indonesian: Satuan Kawasan Wisata (SKW)):
* Cangkuang TZU including Paragliding Mount Haruman, Cikembulan Zoo, Cimandi Racun Waterfall, Cangkuang Lake, Cangkuang, Jafar Umar Sidiq Tomb,

<doc id="1339356" wikidata="Q387297" url="?curid=1339356" title="African manatee">
<text>The African manatee (Trichechus senegalensis), also known as the West African manatee, is a species of manatee that inhabits much of Western Africa – from Senegal to Angola. It is the only manatee species to be found in the Old World.

==Taxonomy==
The African manatee was officially declared a species under the &quot;Trichechus senegalensis&quot; taxon in 1795 by naturalist Johann Heinrich Friedrich Link. No subspecies of this taxon are known. Although African manatees live in both coastal areas and isolated inland areas, genetic evidence suggests no significant differences between the two populations. The African manatee falls under the genus &quot;Trichechus&quot; with only two other species, the Amazonian manatee and the West Indian manatee, which are also sirenians.

==Range and habitat==
African manatees inhabit the widest ranges of habitats of any sirenian species, ranging from offshore islands in the Atlantic to rivers in the western Sahel, equatorial rainforest rivers, and so on. It has been reported that coastal populations ascend rivers during the rainy season and descend again during the dry season. The movement and habitat of the African manatee has been threatened by the building of agricultural and hydroelectric dams along rivers that isolate populations, such as the Akosombo Dam in Ghana. The Diama Dam has permanently isolated the Senegal River manatee population from the coast, as has the Felou Dam in Mali. 

African Manatees can be found in West African regions: Angola, Benin, Cameroon, Chad, the Republic of the Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Togo. Manatees are found in brackish waters to freshwater: in oceans, rivers, lakes, coastal estuaries, reservoirs, lagoons, and bays on the coast. African manatees rarely inhabit waters with a temperature below 

Manatees have been found as far as offshore, where there are shallow coastal flats and calm mangrove creeks filled with seagrass. Inland lakes where manatees dwell include Lake Volta, the Inner Niger River Delta in Mali, Lake Léré, and Lake de Tréné. Due to fluctuating flow rates and water levels in rivers, some of these permanent lakes serve as refuges for manatees in connecting rivers during the dry season. From north to south, the river systems that contain manatees include: the Senegal, Saloum, Gambia, Casamance, Cacheu, Mansôa, Geba, Buba, Tombali, Cacine, Kogon, Konkouré, Sierra Leone, Great Scarcies, Little Scarcies, Sherbro, Malem, Waanje, Sewa, Missunado, Cavalla, St. Paul, Morro, St. John, Bandama, Niouniourou, Sassandra, Comoé, Bia, Tano, Volta, Mono, Oueme, Niger, Mekrou, Benue, Cross, Katsena Ala, Bani, Akwayafe, Rio del Rey, Ngosso, Andokat, Mene, Munaya, Wouri, Sanaga, Faro, Chari, Bamaingui, Bahr-Kieta, Logoné, Mitémélé, Gabon, Ogooué, Lovanzi, Kouilou, Congo, Dande, Bengo, and Cuanza. Manatees move up these rivers until they are unable to proceed because of shallow waters or strong waterfalls.

The areas with the highest manatee populations are Guinea-Bissau, the lagoons of Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, the southern portions of the Niger River in Nigeria, the Sanaga River in Cameroon, the coastal lagoons in Gabon, and the lower parts of the Congo River. As part of a study completed in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire to assess where the majority of African manatees favor living, a sample of African manatees was radio-tagged and tracked. The tracking observed most of the sample in coastal lagoons, mangroves, and other herbaceous growths. They were also found in the grassy estuaries of big rivers with mangroves and in protected coastal spots with less than of water containing both mangroves and marine macrophytes.

==Diet==
Manatees are omnivores; and are known to occasionally eat clams, mollusks, and fish found in nets. The percentage of the diet that is composed of non-plant material varies based on location, with manatees living off the coast having a lifetime average of 50% non-plant material. The West African manatee is the only sirenian that seems to intentionally consume non-plant material. A majority of the African manatee&#x27;s diet is made up of a variety of flora found above or hanging over the water. African manatees that inhabit rivers mostly eat the overhanging plants growing on the river banks. The diet of African manatees living in estuaries consists solely of mangrove trees. Each day, the African manatee eats about four to nine percent of its body weight in wet vegetation. Microorganisms within the African manatee&#x27;s large intestine, which measures up to in length, aid it in digesting the large quantity and variety of vegetation that it consumes daily.

==Description==
The African manatee&#x27;s body is widest at the middle, and its tail resembles a paddle. The manatee is gray in color with small, colorless hairs that cover its body. However, algae and other tiny organisms often grow on an African manatee&#x27;s body, so its body sometimes appears brown or greenish in color. Calves are darker in color when they are very young. African manatees measure up to in length, and weigh about . African manatees are typically extremely slow, moving between 4.8 km and 8.0 km (3 and 5 mi) per hour, although when scared by predators they can travel at speeds of about per hour. The African manatee&#x27;s large forelimbs, or flippers, are used to paddle and to bring food to its mouth. Vegetation is then chewed by the manatee&#x27;s strong molars, which are its only teeth. When the manatee is born, each jaw has two vestigial incisors, which the manatee loses as it matures. If the African manatee&#x27;s molars happen to fall out, new molars grow in their place. The manatee&#x27;s flippers, which have nails, are also used to graze other manatees. The African manatee does not have any hind limbs. From the exterior, the African manatee looks very similar to the American manatee; however, the African manatee is different from the Amazonian manatee, which has characteristic white markings on its abdomen.

==Evolution and legends==
The West African manatee is a descendant of trichechids found in coastal South America during the Pliocene Epoch. Although they tend to stay in freshwater, theory suggests that, through transoceanic currents, the species reached West Africa during the late Pliocene. The West African manatee&#x27;s appearance is thought to be the result of these currents and species movement. The African manatee&#x27;s ancestors passed down advantageous migration and food traits. The African manatee is not restricted to a certain area, and does not have to rely heavily on only one ecosystem for support. This evolution of the African manatee&#x27;s diversity may be part of its key attribute to survival. They are more diverse than other manatees due to their ability to survive in salt water, although they do need access to fresh water for drinking purposes.

According to people of western Africa, &quot;Maame&quot; &quot;Water&quot; (also spelled &quot;Mami Wata&quot;), a recurring character in many coastal legends, is a goddess of the sea and a symbol of wealth and beauty. &quot;Maame&quot; &quot;Water&quot; also flips over canoes and entices their occupants to visit her kingdom. Scientists from the Institute of Aquatic Biology of the Centre for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and the Wildlife Department in Ghana have concluded that &quot;Maame&quot; &quot;Water&quot; is based on the West African manatee. According to Dr. Mamaa Entsua-Mensah, who performs research for CSIR, when female African manatees surface for air, they resemble goddesses. Entsua-Mensah explains that the female manatee&#x27;s breasts create the illusion of a woman-fish.

Among the Serer people of Senegal, the Gambia and Mauritania, the manatee is regarded as sacred and highly respected, because in the Serer creation myth, it is viewed as the guardian of the secrets of the future.

==Behavior==
The African manatee is nocturnal. They tend to travel silently, eat, and be active towards the end of the day and during the nighttime. During the daytime, the African manatee dozes in shallow (1 to 2 meter deep) water. In countries such as Sierra Leone, African manatees migrate upstream when flooding occurs in June and July. This flooding can lower the availability of food for the manatees as well as lower the salinity of waterways. African manatees live in groups of 1 to 6. They have very few natural predators, two of which are sharks and crocodiles. They are also very social, spending a majority of their day bonding by touch, verbal communication, and smell. This creates a deep bond between them. When it is time to migrate due to a weather change, manatees will travel in larger groups to find warmer water and food.

==Reproduction==
The sex of an individual African manatee can only be determined by close examination of the manatee&#x27;s underside. The only visible distinction between males and females is the genital openings. However, males tend to be smaller than females. Some female African manatees are sexually mature as young as 3 years of age, and they give birth every 3 to 5 years of their estimated 30-year lifespan. Males take a longer time to mature (about 9 to 10 years) and can rarely fertilize an egg at the age of 2 or 3 years. African manatees breed year-round. When males and females mate, it is not monogamous; multiple males will usually mate with one female. When the opportunity to mate with a female is at stake, males will fight with each other by pushing and shoving. Female African manatees give birth to one calf at a time after about a 13-month pregnancy. Calves can swim on their own at birth. Although the African manatee&#x27;s social organization is not well understood, research shows the most common and tightly knit bonds are between a mother and her calf.

==Threats==
The African manatee is a vulnerable species because of its meat, oil, bones, and skin, which can bring great wealth to poachers. Specifically they are used to make walking sticks and toy spinning tops. In some countries, such as Nigeria and Cameroon, African manatees are sold to zoos, aquariums, online as pets, and they are sometimes shipped internationally. Anyone visiting such countries will notice manatee meat being sold on the streets and in marketplaces, but the lack of law enforcement protects the poachers from punishment. Residents of countries such as Mali and Chad use the oil of the African manatee in belief that it can cure ailments such as ear infections, rheumatism, and skin conditions.

There are even more threats to the African manatees&#x27; habitat and life: urban and agricultural development, increased damming, and increased use of hydroelectric power in the rivers of countries like Côte d&#x27;Ivoire and Ghana. The building of dams has led to genetic isolation of some populations. There is little data to show if this has any negative long-term effects on the population as a whole. At several hydroelectric dams including the Kanji dam on the Niger River and the Akosombo dam on the Volta River manatees have been caught and killed in the turbines and intake valves. Thick congestion of boats in waterways may cause the manatees to have deadly run-ins with the vessels. However, even natural occurrences, such as droughts and tidal changes, can often strand manatees in unsuitable habitats. Some are killed accidentally by fishing trawls and in nets which are intended for catching sharks.

Some behaviors of African manatees provoke humans to hunt them. When manatees become tangled in fishing nets, they can damage them. People in countries such as Sierra Leone believe that killing the manatees to reduce the species size lowers the chances of the fishing nets requiring expensive repairs. In addition, African manatees can destroy rice crops by drifting into fields during the rainy season.

Many of the African manatees that venture up the Niger River starve to death. At certain times each year, the Niger River dries up due to the hot temperatures and lack of rain. Many manatees migrate there during the rainy season. When the water dries up the manatees are unable to get to other bodies of water.

Manatees do not have many true predators. Apart from humans, they are threatened by sharks, crocodiles, and alligators but this is rare because of a difference in habitat. In West Africa Crocodiles make up the majority of manatee predators besides humans.

==Conservation==

From November 2004 until December 2007, the West African Manatee Conservation Project completed Phase I. During this phase, residents of six African countries (Mauritania, Senegal, The Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, and Sierra Leone) created a database of previously unknown information about the species (such as population, economic value, and habitat range) by conducting surveys in their countries. Other African countries also contributed reports that broadened the collective knowledge of the African manatee. Because of the work done during this phase, the general public, young children, and experienced scientists alike are receiving better information than ever before as to how to protect the African manatees. Phase I also allowed for up-close examination of the African manatee&#x27;s way of life through field work.

Due to the large-scale success of Phase I, a Phase II is to be enacted by Wetlands International. During Phase II, the information collected in Phase I will be even more widely distributed around the areas in which the African manatee lives. Phase II will focus on furthering the existing research and adjusting legislation and education.

The African manatee is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), meaning international export or import is strictly regulated. Laws exist to protect the African manatee in every country in which it lives, but these laws are not well enforced. Due to this mass lack of enforcement and minimal education, the African manatee population is being steadily depleted.

<text>Bluefields is the capital of the South Caribbean Autonomous Region in Nicaragua. It was also the capital of the former Kingdom of Mosquitia, and later the Zelaya Department, which was divided into North and South Caribbean Coast Autonomous Regions. It is located on Bluefields Bay at the mouth of the Bluefields River in the municipality of the same name.

It was named after Abraham Blauvelt, a Dutch-Jewish pirate, privateer, and explorer of Central America and the western Caribbean. It has a population of 56,005 (2022 estimate) and its inhabitants are mostly Afro-descendant Creoles, Miskitu, Mestizo, as well as smaller communities of Garinagu, Chinese, Mayangna, and Rama. Bluefields is Nicaragua’s chief Caribbean port, from which hardwood, seafood, shrimp and lobster are exported. Bluefields was a for European buccaneers in the 16th and 17th century and became capital of the English protectorate of the Kingdom of Mosquitia in 1678.

During United States interventions (1912–15, 1926–33) in Nicaragua, US Marines were stationed there. In 1984, the United States mined the harbor (along with those of Corinto and Puerto Sandino) as part of the Nicaraguan Revolution. Bluefields was destroyed by Hurricane Joan in 1988 but was rebuilt.

==History==

The origin of the city of Bluefields is connected with the presence of European pirates on the Nicaraguan Caribbean coast, subjects of powers at the time hostile to Spain. These pirates used the Escondido River to rest, to repair damages and to be provisioned. By then, the territory of the present municipality was populated by the native towns of Kukra and Branch.

In 1602, a Dutch soldier of fortune named Abraham Blauvelt chose the bay of the Escondido River as his center of operations due to its tactical advantages. The name of the municipality is a literal but pluralized translation of his surname, &#x27;blau&#x27; (modern Dutch &#x27;blauw&#x27;) meaning &#x27;blue&#x27; and &#x27;velt&#x27; (modern Dutch &#x27;veld&#x27;) meaning &#x27;field&#x27;.

African slaves first appeared in the Caribbean coast in 1641, when a Portuguese ship that was transporting slaves wrecked in the Miskito Cays. English subjects started emigrating to the region in 1633. Beginning in 1666, they were organized into colonies and by 1705, governmental authorities had been established. In 1730, the Kingdom of Moskitia came to depend on the British administration in Jamaica. The British supplied the Miskito people with armaments which the Miskito used to fend off attacks by the other groups of the Caribbean coast, including the Afro-descendant Creoles and the indigenous tribes of Mayangnas, Ulwas, and Ramas.

In 1740, the Miskitos yielded to British sovereignty over the territory, and in 1744, a transfer of White colonists was organized from Jamaica to the Kingdom of Moskitia; they brought black slaves with them. French colonists also arrived at this time. The area was a British protectorate until 1796, when Britain, with an offer from the Spanish Monarch to extend the territory in the Yucatán Peninsula for the cutting of logwood for the British settlers, decided to remove all English settlers from the Kingdom of Moskitia; the British subjects also abandoned the islands, but the Spaniards did not take firm positions in them.

With the independence of the Viceroyalty of New Granada, the Kingdom of Moskitia became de jure part of Gran Colombia until its dissolution in 1831. Thereafter it became part of the Republic of New Granada, now Colombia, until, through the Esguerra-Bárcenas Treaty, the Colombian state formally ceded the territory to Nicaragua.

The Moravian Church was installed in 1847. In 1860, the Harrison-Altamirano Treaty, also known as the Treaty of Managua, created the Miskito Reserve from the territory of the Kingdom of Moskitia by an agreement between the British and Nicaraguan governments. The city of Bluefields was chosen as capital of the Reserve.

The &quot;Europeanization&quot; of the Indians was completed by the 1880s, when British and Americans expanded the production of bananas and wood, creating a prosperous enclave economy; by the 1880s, Bluefields was already a city of cosmopolitan character, with an intense commercial activity.

Economic growth also brought a marked process of social differentiation, by which the races and ethnic groups were distributed spatially and in terms of work: the white population represented the interests of the foreign businesses; those of mixed race worked as artisans and in working-class occupations; the darker-skinned Creoles had their niche in physical work, and the native population were employed as servants and for other smaller works. In 1894, the government of Nicaragua incorporated the Miskito Reserve into the national territory, extinguishing the Miskito monarchy, and on October 11, 1903, Bluefields was proclaimed capital of the Department of Zelaya.

Due in part to US Coast Guard patrols attempting to intercept Colombian drug smugglers, salvaging cocaine (often referred to locally as &quot;white lobster&quot;) has become an important part of the local economy. When threatened with potential boarding by US Coast Guard ships, cocaine smugglers try to dispose of their illegal cargo by throwing it overboard, simultaneously lightening their load for a faster escape and eliminating the evidence in case of capture. A percentage of the cocaine bales are carried by ocean currents into the lagoon around Bluefields. Residents may find the bales washed up on the beach or seek them by boat in the lagoon or at sea. In recent years, stricter legislation has led to a decrease in these activities.

Bluefields remains a deeply impoverished city with extremely high rates of unemployment.

== Climate ==
According to Köppen climate classification, Bluefields features a trade-wind tropical rainforest climate (Köppen &quot;Af&quot;). There is a drier period from February to April, but the trade winds ensure that unlike the Pacific coast of Nicaragua, rain still falls frequently during this period. For the rest of the year when tropical low pressure dominates rainfall is extremely heavy, helped by the coast being shaped in such a manner as to intercept winds from the south as prevail during the northern summer.

==Districts==
The city is located beside the eponymous bay; consisting of 17 neighborhoods including the port of El Bluff, located on a peninsula of the same name. Due to gradual erosion, the peninsula is becoming a true island that closes the Bay of Bluefields on the east side. El Bluff has an extension of 1.29 km2 and it is about 8 km from Bluefields.

Bluefields has several municipal headquarters and rural communities including:

==Education==
There are currently two universities in Bluefields. One is the Bluefields campus of the University of the Autonomous Regions of the Nicaraguan Caribbean Coast, and the other is the Bluefields Indian and Caribbean University (BICU).

==Transportation and infrastructure==
Until recently, there was no road access to Bluefields from the west coast of Nicaragua. There is now a highway from Nueva Guinea with regular bus service. The road was completed in May 2019, and was financed with loans from the Inter-American Development Bank and the World Bank. The road was formally declared open by President Daniel Ortega.

Visitors usually either fly in to Bluefields Airport or take a bus from Managua and other cities or take a Panga down the Rio Escondido from the city of El Rama, which itself is accessible from Managua by bus. In the town, taxis are readily available at a fixed price of 14 cordobas per person (2020) and work on a shared basis. The municipal wharf is the home of commercial boat traffic to Corn Island, LaBarra and many other locations which are only accessible by boat. Car ownership is very limited in Bluefields.

The municipal government does not provide all necessary services, so additional services related to water, energy, and sanitation are provided by non-governmental organization blueEnergy.

Bluefields also known as home of the British Armed Forces strategic operations zone (SOZ) which was built in 1936 with the initial goal was encountered the further Nazi Germany Atlantic invasion of Nicaragua during the World War II—recently used to blocking drug trafficking from Mexico to outside Nicaragua via Bluefields and temporary humanitarian aid storage if the country being raged by series of natural disasters.

<doc id="1339363" wikidata="Q458469" url="?curid=1339363" title="William P. Frye">
<text>William Pierce Frye (September 2, 1830 – August 8, 1911) was an American politician from Maine. A member of the Republican Party, Frye spent most of his political career as a legislator, serving in the Maine House of Representatives and then U.S. House of Representatives, before being elected to the U.S. Senate, where he served for 30 years before dying in office. Frye was a member of the Frye political family, and was the grandfather of Wallace H. White Jr., and the son of John March Frye. He was also a prominent member of the Peucinian Society tradition.

Fry was a leader of the &quot;Old Guard&quot; faction of conservative Republicans, exerting his weight on such important committees as Rules, Foreign Relations, Appropriations, and Commerce. He was best known for supporting the shipping industry, but repeatedly failed to obtain government subsidies. He also supported high tariffs, expansion that sought additional territory and the canal connecting the Atlantic and Pacific. He favored the annexation of Hawaii and the acquisition of the Philippine Islands in 1898. President William McKinley appointed him to the peace commission that negotiated the end of the Spanish-American war.

==Biography==
Frye was born in Lewiston, Maine, in Androscoggin County. He attended public schools there and graduated from Bowdoin College in Brunswick in 1850. Frye studied law and was later admitted to the bar. He began practicing in Rockland, Maine in 1853 but later returned to Lewiston, and practiced law there. While living in Rockland, he married Caroline Spear (1832 - 1900) in February 1853. Frye played a role in founding Bates College in Lewiston and served as a longtime trustee of the college. Frye received a LL.D. from Bates in 1881.

Frye was a presidential elector in 1864.

Frye served in the Maine House of Representatives from 1861 to 1862 and again in 1867. He was later elected as the mayor of Lewiston, holding that position from 1866 to 1867, when he became the state attorney general. Frye left the attorney general post in 1869. He was elected as a Republican in 1870 to the U.S. House of Representatives. Frye served in the 42nd Congress and the five succeeding Congresses from March 4, 1871, to March 17, 1881, when he resigned after being elected Senator to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of James G. Blaine, who was appointed by President Garfield to be Secretary of State. He served over 30 years in the Senate (March 18, 1881 – August 8, 1911), and was reelected in 1883, 1889, 1895, 1901, and 1907.

During his tenure in the Senate, Frye served as its President pro tempore from the 54th–62nd Congress. The Vice Presidency was vacant twice during that time: November 21, 1899 – March 4, 1901, following the death of Garret Hobart, and September 14, 1901 – March 4, 1905, after Theodore Roosevelt succeeded to the presidency. Frye resigned as president pro tempore due to ill health a couple of months before his death. Electing his successor proved difficult for the Senate, as the Republicans, then in the majority, were split between progressive and conservative factions, each promoting its own candidate. It took several months for a consensus way forward to emerge. At the time of his resignation he had served longer in that position then anyone else, 15 years, 2 months, 21 days.

Frye was also the chairman of the Rules Committee (47th–49th Congress). Frye also was a member of the Commerce Committee (50th–62nd Congress) and a member of the commission which met in Paris in September 1898 to adjust the Treaty of Paris between the United States and Spain, ending the Spanish–American War.

Senator Frye was a charter member of the District of Columbia Society of the Sons of the American Revolution when it was founded in 1890.

Frye died in Lewiston in 1911. He is interred in the Riverside Cemetery. The Sen. William P. Frye House near Bates College in Lewiston is on the National Historic Register.

<doc id="1339365" wikidata="Q2714018" url="?curid=1339365" title="Beet the Vandel Buster">
<text>is a Japanese manga series written by Riku Sanjo and illustrated by Koji Inada. The manga ran in Shueisha&#x27;s &quot;Monthly Shōnen Jump&quot; from 2002 to 2006. After a nearly ten-year hiatus, the series resumed in &quot;Jump SQ.Crown&quot; in 2016, before entering a short-term hiatus. It has been serialized in &quot;Jump SQ.Rise&quot; since 2018. 18 volumes volumes have been released as of October 2024. In North America, Viz Media licensed the manga for English release and published its first twelve volumes between 2004 and 2007.

The series takes place in a fantasy world where humans have been suffering from the attacks of the demon-like Vandels. Humans can fight back by becoming a Vandel Buster, a paid monster and Vandel assassin. Beet is a young boy who becomes a Vandel Buster to be like his heroes, the Zenon Warriors.

A 52-episode anime television series adaptation by Toei Animation was broadcast on TV Tokyo, followed by a sequel, &quot;Beet the Vandel Buster: Excellion&quot;, which ran for 25 episodes. The anime series was licensed in North America by Illumitoon Entertainment, who only released one DVD in 2007 before discontinuing it.

==Story==

Set in the Dark Ages, a term referring to the time since Vandels (a portmanteau of &quot;vampire and &quot;devil&quot;) appeared and started attacking humans. Beet is a boy who dreams of joining the &quot;Zenon Warriors&quot;, a group of &quot;Vandel Busters&quot; who are considered to be the strongest on the continent. When the group comes to protect his village from the Vandel, Beltorze, Beet tries to join them but is rejected. When Beltorze appears, the Zenon Warriors seem to have the upper hand until Beet cheers them on, causing the Vandel to notice his presence. Beltorze attacks Beet, and the Zenon Warriors are forced to break formation to help him. Beltorze uses that moment to attack again, which mortally wounds all of them. Hidden in the smoke, the Zenon Warriors decide to rescue Beet&#x27;s life by putting their life force into their “Saiga” and giving them to Beet. When Beet complains and asks them why they are doing this, it is revealed that Zenon is Beet&#x27;s brother. The now weaponless Zenon Warriors then emerge from the smoke and continue to attack Beltorze. When Beet regains consciousness, both Beltorze and the Zenon Warriors are gone. Guilt-ridden and sad, he cries and vows to destroy all the Vandels and end the Dark Ages. He then goes on a three-year training expedition. His childhood friend, Poala, later joins Beet and they form the “Beet Warriors”. As Beet continues his journey, more is learned about the fight between the Zenon Warriors and Beltorze and the fantasy world of Beet is expanded on.

<text> (1542 – November 17, 1600) was a naval commander during Japan&#x27;s Sengoku Period, under Oda Nobunaga, and later, Toyotomi Hideyoshi. He was also the ninth headmaster of the Kuki family&#x27;s school of martial arts, Kukishin-ryū and thus a very skilled warrior.

==Military life==
In the 1570s, Kuki allied himself with Oda Nobunaga, and commanded his fleet, supporting land-based attacks on the Ikkō-ikki at Ise Bay.

In 1574, his aid ensured a victory for Nobunaga in his third attempt to attack the Nagashima fortress.

In 1575, Nobunaga allowed Yoshitaka to seize Shima Province, forcing out other maritime clans, such the Mukai clan.

In 1576, he was defeated at Kizugawaguchi by the Mōri clan fleet, but 1578 brought victory in the second Battle of Kizugawaguchi, in which Kuki used iron-armored ships, , to repel the arrows and musket balls of the opposing Mōri clan&#x27;s ships.

In 1584, Yoshitaka along with Takigawa Kazumasu besieged Kanie castle, in Toyotomi Hideyoshi&#x27;s campaign to consolidate his power over the lands held by the Oda clan in Owari province.

In 1587, he led Toyotomi Hideyoshi&#x27;s fleet in a campaign in Kyūshū, alongside Konishi Yukinaga, Wakizaka Yasuharu and Katō Yoshiaki.

Three years later, along with Wakizaka Yasuharu and Kato Yoshiaki he went on to lead the Siege of Shimoda in the Odawara campaign 1590.

He continued in his role as commander of Hideyoshi&#x27;s fleet, launching an invasion of Korea in 1592 from his flagship &quot;Nipponmaru&quot;, but he was severely defeated in the Battle of Myeongryang in 1597.

==Death==
In 1600, in the Battle of Sekigahara, Kuki Yoshitaka fought alongside the Ishida Mitsunari forces, while his son Kuki Moritaka joined the opposing force, under Tokugawa Ieyasu.

Following Tokugawa&#x27;s victory, his son successfully guaranteed Yoshitaka&#x27;s safety from Ieyasu. In a turn of fate, Yoshitaka committed seppuku before the news from Moritaka reached him.

<text>The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is a division of the United States Department of Transportation that specializes in highway transportation. The agency&#x27;s major activities are grouped into two programs, the Federal-aid Highway Program and the Federal Lands Highway Program. Its role had previously been performed by the Office of Road Inquiry, Office of Public Roads and the Bureau of Public Roads.

==History==

===Background===

With the coming of the bicycle in the 1890s, interest grew regarding the improvement of streets and roads in America. The traditional method of putting the burden on maintaining roads on local landowners was increasingly inadequate. In 1893, the federal Office of Road Inquiry (ORI) was founded; in 1905, it was renamed the Office of Public Roads (OPR) and made a division of the United States Department of Agriculture.

Demands grew for local and state government to take charge. With the coming of the automobile, urgent efforts were made to upgrade and modernize dirt roads designed for horse-drawn wagon traffic. In 1910, the American Association for Highway Improvement was organized. Funding came from automobile registration, and taxes on motor fuels, as well as state aid. By 1914, there were 2.4 million miles of rural dirt rural roads; 100,000 miles had been improved with grading and gravel, and 3,000 miles were given high-quality surfacing. The rapidly increasing speed of automobiles, and especially trucks, made maintenance and repair high-priority items.

In 1915, OPR&#x27;s name was changed to the Bureau of Public Roads. The following year, federal aid was first made available to improve post roads and promote general commerce: $75 million over five years, issued through the BPR in cooperation with the state highway departments.

In 1939, BPR was renamed to the Public Roads Administration (PRA) and shifted to the Federal Works Agency. After the FWA was abolished in 1949, the organization was once again named the Bureau of Public Roads; it was placed under the Department of Commerce.

From 1917 through 1941, 261,000 miles of highways were built with $3.17 billion in federal aid and $2.14 billion in state and local funds.

===Creation===
The Federal Highway Administration was created on October 15, 1966, along with the Bureau of Motor Carrier Safety and the National Highway Safety Bureau (now known as National Highway Traffic Safety Administration), as part of the new U.S. Department of Transportation. The FHWA took over the functions of the Bureau of Public Roads the following year.

==Functions==
The FHWA&#x27;s role in the Federal-aid Highway Program is to oversee federal funds to build and maintain the National Highway System (primarily Interstate highways, U.S. highways and most state highways). This funding mostly comes from the federal gasoline tax and mostly goes to state departments of transportation. The FHWA oversees projects using these funds to ensure that federal requirements for project eligibility, contract administration and construction standards are adhered to.

Under the Federal Lands Highway Program (sometimes called &quot;direct fed&quot;), the FHWA provides highway design and construction services for various federal land-management agencies, such as the Forest Service and the National Park Service. The FLHP also jointly administers the Indian Reservation Roads Program.

In addition to these programs, the FHWA performs and sponsors research in the areas of roadway safety, congestion, highway materials and construction methods, and provides funding to local technical assistance program centers to disseminate research results to local highway agencies.

The FHWA also publishes the &quot;Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices&quot; (MUTCD), which is used by most highway agencies in the United States. The MUTCD provides such standards as the size, color and height of traffic signs, traffic signals and road surface markings.

==Programs==
=== Long-Term Pavement Performance Program ===

Long-Term Pavement Performance (LTPP) is a program supported by the FHWA to collect and analyse road data. The LTPP program was initiated by the Transportation Research Board (TRB) of the National Research Council (NRC) in the early 1980s. The FHWA with the cooperation of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) sponsored the program. As a result of this program, the FHWA has collected a huge database of road performance. The FHWA and the ASCE hold an annual contest known as LTPP International Data Analysis Contest, which is based on challenging researchers to answer a question based on the LTPP data.

=== Every Day Counts initiative ===
In 2010, FHWA launched the Every Day Counts (EDC) initiative to identify and deploy innovations to reduce project delivery time, enhance safety, and protect the environment. EDC is a state-based model that rapidly deploys proven, yet underutilized innovations. FHWA works with State transportation departments, local governments, tribes, private industry, and other stakeholders to identify a new collection of innovations to champion every two years that merit accelerated deployment. Among the approaches promoted by the EDC effort are: adaptive traffic control to reduce fuel consumption and improve travel time reliability; alternative intersection design; prefabricated bridge elements and systems; high-friction surface treatments; warm mix asphalt; ultra-high-performance concrete; virtual public involvement; and time-saving strategies such as rapid bridge replacement. Since the inception of EDC, each state has used 26 or more of the 57 innovations and some states have deployed more than 45. Many of these practices have become mainstream practices across the country.

==Organization==
The Federal Highway Administration is overseen by an administrator appointed by the President of the United States by and with the consent of the United States Senate. The administrator works under the direction of the Secretary of Transportation and Deputy Secretary of Transportation. The internal organization of the FHWA is as follows:
**Office of Administration
**Office of Chief Counsel
**Office of the Chief Financial Officer
**Office of Civil Rights
**Office of Federal Lands Highway
**Office of Infrastructure
**Office of Innovation and Workforce Solutions
**Office of Operations
**Office of Planning, Environment, and Realty

<doc id="1339415" wikidata="Q6830410" url="?curid=1339415" title="Michael Franzese">
<text>Michael Franzese Sr. () ( Grillo; born May 27, 1951) is an American former mobster who was a caporegime in the Colombo crime family in New York City, and son of former underboss Sonny Franzese. Franzese was enrolled in a pre-med program at Hofstra University, but dropped out to make money for his family after his father was sentenced to 50 years in prison for bank robbery in 1967. He eventually helped implement a scheme to defraud the federal government out of gasoline taxes in the early 1980s.

By the age of 35, in 1986, &quot;Fortune Magazine&quot; listed Franzese as number 18 on its list of the &quot;Fifty Most Wealthy and Powerful Mafia Bosses&quot;. Franzese claimed that at the height of his career, he generated up to $8 million per week. In 1986, he was sentenced to 10 years in prison on conspiracy charges, released in 1989, rearrested in 1991 for a parole violation, and ultimately released in 1994. During his time in prison, Franzese became a born-again Christian. Soon after being released, he walked away from the mob and retired to California, and became a motivational speaker, commentator, and writer.

== Early life ==
Franzese was born May 27, 1951, in Brooklyn, New York to John &quot;Sonny&quot; Franzese, a Colombo crime family underboss, and Cristina Capobianco-Franzese, although Michael had initially questioned who his actual biological father was. Franzese had initially believed that he had been adopted by John after his mother divorced Frank Grillo, whom Franzese thought to be his biological father. Michael says he had gone by the name &quot;Michael Grillo&quot; until he was 18 years old.

However, it was later discovered that John, already married with three children, had gotten the 16-year-old Capobianco, a cigarette girl at the Stork Club in Manhattan, pregnant with Michael, so Capobianco married Grillo to avoid having a scandal surrounding having a child out of wedlock. After the mob allowed John to divorce his first wife, Grillo disappeared, and John married Capobianco.

Franzese later moved to Long Island. His father originally did not want him to be involved in organized crime. However, in 1971, Franzese decided to drop out of college to help his family earn money when his father was sentenced to 50 years in prison for bank robbery in 1967.

Franzese became acquainted with his father&#x27;s friends such as Joseph Colombo, and according to Franzese, later became inducted as a made man on Halloween night 1975 under acting boss Tommy DiBella. As part of the ceremony Franzese took the blood oath and swore omerta. He took the oath alongside friend Jimmy Angelino, Joseph Peraino Jr., Salvatore Miciotta, Vito Guzzo Sr., and John Minerva — all of whom except Miciotta died violently over the next 20 years. Although Franzese recounts this ceremony had taken place in 1975, the membership books reportedly were not reopened until 1976. They had been closed since 1957.

Franzese was briefly mentored by Colombo soldier Joseph &quot;Joe-Joe&quot; Vitacco (1927–1980). During the late 1970s, Franzese met with future Gambino crime family boss John Gotti, who was then a soldier. Angelo Ruggiero was also present. Franzese was contacted by a flea market owner who complained that his partner was using and selling drugs at the market in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. Franzese agreed to frighten him and become the new partner. Franzese sent Colombo soldier-turned informant Anthony Sarivola and another member who remains unidentified. Gotti however claimed that the scared-off partner was an associate of his. Franzese later expressed admiration for Gotti, citing his strict mobster lifestyle and his overwhelming ego.

In 1980, Franzese had become a caporegime of a crew of 300.

== Gasoline bootlegging ==
In 1981, Franzese was contacted by Lawrence Salvatore Iorizzo, who had developed a scheme to defraud the federal government out of gasoline taxes in 1985. Iorizzo was being hassled by criminals in California and offered Franzese a percentage if he would defend and solve the issue. The pair set up 18 stock-bearer companies based in Panama. Under law at the time in Panama, gasoline could be sold tax-free from one wholesale company to the next. Franzese partnered with the Russian Mafia in Brooklyn in the gas scheme.

The wholesale gas was sold to one company, but shipped to another company, while a third company, a dummy company, sold the gasoline on paper, and would forge tax documents for the company that received the gasoline. Franzese&#x27;s crew was then able to collect and pocket the nine cents per gallon of gasoline in federal tax. Once enforcement agents attempt to collect the tax from the dummy company, it declares bankruptcy and the daisy chain would continue.

This gasoline supplied between one third and one half of all gasoline sold in the New York metropolitan area. According to officials, Franzese kept 75 percent of the profits, making $1.26 million per month, while Iorizzo made $45,000 per month. An associate later testified that Franzese personally made $1 million per week from the gas scheme.

Franzese had claimed that at the height of his career, he generated up to $8 million per week. Revenue officials estimated $250 million in gasoline tax was stolen in New York state per year, before moving on to Florida which was estimated to have lost $40 million to $250 million in stolen gasoline tax. Authorities believe the money was laundered through Franzese&#x27;s film production company, Miami Gold, to offshore bank accounts in Austria and Panama. Franzese bought a home in Delray Beach, Florida.

In 1986, &quot;Fortune Magazine&quot; listed Franzese as number 18 on its list of the &quot;Fifty Most Wealthy and Powerful Mafia Bosses&quot;. &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; cited him as one of the biggest money earners for the mafia since Al Capone. He was referred to as the &quot;Yuppie Don&quot; in the 1980s, and as &quot;Prince of the Mafia&quot;.

== Entertainment, sports management and other businesses ==
During the 1970s, he began to enter the world of legitimate business and by the mid-1980s Franzese had a stronghold on various businesses such as car dealerships, leasing companies, auto repair shops, restaurants, nightclubs, a contractor company, movie production and distribution companies, travel agencies and video stores.

By 1980, Franzese was a partner with booking agent Norby Walters in his firm. Franzese&#x27;s role was to intimidate existing and prospective clients. Franzese would later testify he provided the initial $50,000 to Walters to start his agency booking company with a 25% share of any profits. Additionally, Franzese would assist with any entertainers Walters had problems with by meeting their agents. In 1981, Franzese successfully extorted a role for Walters in the US tour by singer Michael Jackson and his brothers. In 1982, the manager for singer Dionne Warwick wanted to drop Walters as an agent; Franzese met with the manager and persuaded him to keep Walters.

In 1983, the FBI launched an investigation into boxing promoter Don King&#x27;s organized crime connections and targeted Franzese to introduce an FBI undercover agent, using the alias Victor Quintana, to King. Franzese, who had never met King, says he was introduced to him by civil rights leader Al Sharpton. Franzese claimed he first met Sharpton through the Genovese crime family mobster Daniel Pagano. Quintana was to give the impression that he was buying his way into the boxing world in order for King to reveal his criminal associations, however the investigation subsequently collapsed after Quintana failed to follow through with several hundred thousand dollars.

In 1985, Walters set up a sports management agency with Franzese as a silent partner. At a meeting he agreed to hand over $50,000 in return for a 25 percent interest from the sports agency.

Franzese was the president of Miami Gold, a film production company that produced the 1986 film &quot;Knights of the City&quot;.

== Indictment and prison ==
In April 1985, Franzese was acquitted of racketeering charges. In another case in December 1985, Franzese was charged in both Florida and New York in regards to counterfeiting and extortion from the gasoline bootlegging racket. In New York, Franzese was one of nine people indicted on 14 counts. In Florida, Franzese was one of 26 people indicted on 177 counts after a 16-month investigation in Florida called &quot;Operation Tiger Tail&quot;.

Iorizzo, who was already sentenced to five years and ordered to pay $1.7 million for his role in the theft of $1.1 million in gas taxes and placed in the witness protection program, began testifying against Franzese and others in their operation in March 1985. On March 21, 1986, Franzese pleaded guilty to one count of racketeering conspiracy and one count of tax conspiracy. Franzese was sentenced to 10 years in prison and ordered to pay $14.7 million in restitution on the federal charges, agreeing to sell his assets including a mansion in Old Brookville, New York, the Miami Gold production company, and use proceeds from the &quot;Knights of the City&quot; film. He then reached a plea agreement and was sentenced to nine years in prison for state racketeering charges in Florida which would run concurrently with his previous conviction. He also was ordered to pay an additional $3 million in restitution to the state of Florida.

Franzese was subpoenaed to testify at Walters&#x27; trial in March 1989, as Walters had invoked his name to frighten college athletes into signing management contracts, including Maurice Douglass. In exchange for his testimony, he was given immunity from prosecution in the Walters case. Walters was found guilty, fined $395,000 and given a sentence of 5 years with the judge in the case citing the importance of Franzese&#x27;s testimony. After Walters&#x27; conviction, Franzese was released from prison on parole after serving 43 months. In September 1990, Walters&#x27; conviction was overturned by the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals citing a technicality.

On December 27, 1991, Franzese was sentenced in New York to four years in federal prison for violating the probation requirements from his 1989 release. Franzese had been arrested in Los Angeles on a tax fraud accusation and was sent back to New York for the probation hearing. In court, prosecutors complained that Franzese had only started paying the balance of his court-ordered restitution payments earlier that year. &quot;Mr. Franzese has led the Government on a long, merry chase for a number of years,&quot; United States Attorney Andrew J. Maloney said after the court session. &quot;We essentially view him as a con man.&quot;
&quot; Prosecutors said that Franzese was no longer considered by the government to be a federal cooperating witness because of his parole violations.

In 1990, Franzese was portrayed by Joseph Bono in the Martin Scorsese film &quot;Goodfellas&quot; (1990). While imprisoned in 1991, Franzese became a born-again Christian after he was given a Bible by a prison guard. He also spent three years in solitary confinement.

In 1992, Franzese co-authored his first book, an autobiography, &quot;Quitting the Mob&quot;. In the book, Franzese discusses his criminal activities, life with his father, and meeting his second wife, Camille Garcia.

== After prison ==
Franzese was released on November 7, 1994, retiring from the mob in 1995 by moving to California with his wife and children; the relocation was also a result of receiving multiple death threats and contracts on his life, including one approved by his father.

Since his release in 1994, Franzese has publicly renounced and denounced the life of organized crime, stating &quot;I never glamorize my mob life. It&#x27;s an evil life&quot;, and &quot;I don&#x27;t know one family that&#x27;s part of that life [mob life] that hasn&#x27;t been totally devastated&quot;. He has since become a motivational speaker for youth, at schools, prisons, and other venues. He also speaks at Christian conferences and churches, including Willow Creek Community Church, in 2016.

On July 23, 2002, while appearing on the HBO television program &quot;Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel&quot;, Franzese stated that during the 1970s and 1980s, he persuaded New York Yankees players who owed money to Colombo loansharks to fix baseball games for betting purposes. The Yankees organization immediately denied Franzese&#x27;s accusations.

In April 2013, a documentary called &quot;The Definitive Guide to the Mob&quot; was released by Lionsgate, with Franzese as commentator. Later in 2013, he appeared in &quot;Inside the American Mob&quot;, a National Geographic documentary.

Franzese released an autobiographical biopic, &quot;God the Father&quot;, in 2014, which was released in theaters across 20 cities in the United States. The film uses a combination of stock footage, animated recreations, as well as interviews to tell his life story. It cites religion as the motivation for Franzese changing his life.

In March 2015, he appeared in a two-part documentary on the American Mafia with television presenter and reporter Trevor McDonald. He spoke about his wealth, but also the impact that being a member of the Colombo crime family had on his family, and that was why he turned away from organized crime.

In 2017, he played a reformed mobster in the Kevin Sorbo film &quot;Let There Be Light&quot;.

Franzese hosted a stage musical, &quot;A Mob Story&quot;, at the Plaza Hotel &amp; Casino in Las Vegas. The show opened in October 2018 and was created and directed by Jeff Kutash.

In 2019, Franzese became co-founder of a national franchise of pizza restaurants called &quot;Slices Pizza&quot;. Slices serves Sicilian-style square pizzas with ingredients sourced from Naples and Campania, with ovens from Venice. The franchise started in California, and included five branches across the country at its height. In 2022, Franzese founded Franzese Wines, a line of Armenian wines.

In July 2020, he appeared in the Netflix docuseries &quot;Fear City: New York vs The Mafia&quot;.

In June 2020, Franzese started a YouTube channel. On his channel he tells stories about his past life, makes interviews, and reviews mafia-related films, television shows and video games, and analyzes their accuracy. His subscriber count exceeded one million in January 2023.

Franzese appeared in the documentary series &quot;American Godfathers: The Five Families&quot; in 2024.

Franzese is the author of seven books: &quot;Quitting the Mob&quot; (1992), &quot;Blood Covenant&quot; (2003), &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Forgiven&quot; (2009), &quot;I&#x27;ll Make You an Offer You Can&#x27;t Refuse&quot; (2011), &quot;From the Godfather to God the Father&quot; (2014), &quot;Blood Covenant: The Story of the &quot;Mafia Prince&quot; Who Publicly Quit the Mob and Lived&quot; (2018) and &quot;Mafia Democracy&quot; (2022).

== Personal life ==
Franzese is a Christian. He has been married twice. He lives in Newport Beach, California with his wife, Camille Garcia, and their seven children. Franzese met his current wife in 1984, while shooting the film &quot;Knights of the City&quot; in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. His wife, a Christian, also influenced him in his decision to leave the mob.

In 2010, Franzese&#x27;s brother John Franzese Jr. testified against their father Sonny Franzese in a racketeering case after wearing a wire during conversations with him. Michael described his brother as a &quot;nobody in the mob life&quot;, and that his father &quot;felt sick&quot; that one of his sons had &quot;betrayed him like this&quot;. Sonny Franzese was sentenced to eight years in prison, and was released from prison in 2017 at the age of 100, dying three years later.
