<text>Technocracy is a form of government in which the decision-makers are selected based on their expertise in a given area of responsibility, particularly with regard to scientific or technical knowledge. Technocracy follows largely in the tradition of other meritocratic theories and assumes full state control over political and economic issues. 

This system explicitly contrasts with representative democracy, the notion that elected representatives should be the primary decision-makers in government, though it does not necessarily imply eliminating elected representatives. Decision-makers are selected based on specialized knowledge and performance rather than political affiliations, parliamentary skills, or popularity.

The term &quot;technocracy&quot; was initially used to signify the application of the scientific method to solving social problems. In its most extreme form, technocracy is an entire government running as a technical or engineering problem and is mostly hypothetical. In more practical use, technocracy is any portion of a bureaucracy run by technologists. A government in which elected officials appoint experts and professionals to administer individual government functions, and recommend legislation, can be considered technocratic. Some uses of the word refer to a form of meritocracy, where the ablest are in charge, ostensibly without the influence of special interest groups. Critics have suggested that a &quot;technocratic divide&quot; challenges more participatory models of democracy, describing these divides as &quot;efficacy gaps that persist between governing bodies employing technocratic principles and members of the general public aiming to contribute to government decision making&quot;.

==History of the term==
The term &quot;technocracy&quot; is derived from the Greek words τέχνη, &quot;tekhne&quot; meaning &quot;skill&quot; and κράτος, &quot;kratos&quot; meaning &quot;power&quot;, as in &quot;governance&quot;, or &quot;rule&quot;. William Henry Smyth, a California engineer, is usually credited with inventing the word &quot;technocracy&quot; in 1919 to describe &quot;the rule of the people made effective through the agency of their servants, the scientists and engineers&quot;, although the word had been used before on several occasions. Smyth used the term &quot;Technocracy&quot; in his 1919 article &quot;&#x27;Technocracy&#x27;—Ways and Means to Gain Industrial Democracy&quot; in the journal &quot;Industrial Management&quot; (57). Smyth&#x27;s usage referred to Industrial democracy: a movement to integrate workers into decision-making through existing firms or revolution.

In the 1930s, through the influence of Howard Scott and the technocracy movement he founded, the term technocracy came to mean &#x27;government by technical decision making&#x27;, using an energy metric of value. Scott proposed that money be replaced by energy certificates denominated in units such as ergs or joules, equivalent in total amount to an appropriate national net energy budget, and then distributed equally among the North American population, according to resource availability.

There is in common usage found the derivative term &quot;technocrat&quot;. The word &quot;technocrat&quot; can refer to someone exercising governmental authority because of their knowledge, &quot;a member of a powerful technical elite&quot;, or &quot;someone who advocates the supremacy of technical experts&quot;. McDonnell and Valbruzzi define a prime minister or minister as a technocrat if &quot;at the time of their appointment to government, they: have never held public office under the banner of a political party; are not a formal member of any party; and are said to possess recognized non-party political expertise which is directly relevant to the role occupied in government&quot;. In Russia, the President of Russia has often nominated ministers based on technical expertise from outside political circles, and these have been referred to as &quot;technocrats&quot;.

==Precursors==
Before the term &quot;technocracy&quot; was coined, technocratic or quasi-technocratic ideas involving governance by technical experts were promoted by various individuals, most notably early socialist theorists such as Henri de Saint-Simon. This was expressed by the belief in state ownership over the economy, with the state&#x27;s function being transformed from pure philosophical rule over men into a scientific administration of things and a direction of production processes under scientific management. According to Daniel Bell:
&quot;St.-Simon&#x27;s vision of industrial society, a vision of pure technocracy, was a system of planning and rational order in which society would specify its needs and organize the factors of production to achieve them.&quot; Citing the ideas of St.-Simon, Bell concludes that the &quot;administration of things&quot; by rational judgment is the hallmark of technocracy.

Alexander Bogdanov, a Russian scientist and social theorist, also anticipated a conception of technocratic process. Both Bogdanov&#x27;s fiction and his political writings, which were highly influential, suggest that he was concerned that a coming revolution against capitalism could lead to a technocratic society.

From 1913 until 1922, Bogdanov immersed himself in writing a lengthy philosophical treatise of original ideas, &quot;Tectology: Universal Organization Science&quot;. Tectology anticipated many basic ideas of systems analysis, later explored by cybernetics. In &quot;Tectology&quot;, Bogdanov proposed unifying all social, biological, and physical sciences by considering them as systems of relationships and seeking organizational principles that underlie all systems.

Arguably, the Platonic idea of philosopher-kings represents a sort of technocracy in which the state is run by those with specialist knowledge, in this case, knowledge of the Good rather than scientific knowledge. The Platonic claim is that those who best understand goodness should be empowered to lead the state, as they would lead it toward the path of happiness. Whilst knowledge of the Good differs from knowledge of science, rulers are here appointed based on a certain grasp of technical skill rather than democratic mandate.

==Characteristics==
Technocrats are individuals with technical training and occupations who perceive many important societal problems as being solvable with the applied use of technology and related applications. The administrative scientist Gunnar K. A. Njalsson theorizes that technocrats are primarily driven by their cognitive &quot;problem-solution mindsets&quot; and only in part by particular occupational group interests. Their activities and the increasing success of their ideas are thought to be a crucial factor behind the modern spread of technology and the largely ideological concept of the &quot;information society&quot;. Technocrats may be distinguished from &quot;econocrats&quot; and &quot;bureaucrats&quot; whose problem-solution mindsets differ from those of the technocrats.

===Examples===
The former government of the Soviet Union has been referred to as a technocracy. Soviet leaders like Leonid Brezhnev often had a technical background. In 1986, 89% of Politburo members were engineers.

Leaders of the Chinese Communist Party used to be mostly professional engineers. According to surveys of municipal governments of cities with a population of 1 million or more in China, it has been found that over 80% of government personnel had a technical education. Under the five-year plans of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, projects such as the National Trunk Highway System, the China high-speed rail system, and the Three Gorges Dam have been completed. During China&#x27;s 20th National Congress, a class of technocrats in finance and economics are replaced in favor of high-tech technocrats.

In 2013, a European Union library briefing on its legislative structure referred to the Commission as a &quot;technocratic authority&quot;, holding a &quot;legislative monopoly&quot; over the EU lawmaking process. The briefing suggests that this system, which elevates the European Parliament to a vetoing and amending body, was &quot;originally rooted in the mistrust of the political process in post-war Europe&quot;. This system is unusual since the Commission&#x27;s sole right of legislative initiative is a power usually associated with Parliaments.

Several governments in European parliamentary democracies have been labelled &#x27;technocratic&#x27; based on the participation of unelected experts (&#x27;technocrats&#x27;) in prominent positions. Since the 1990s, Italy has had several such governments (in Italian, &quot;governo tecnico&quot;) in times of economic or political crisis, including the formation in which economist Mario Monti presided over a cabinet of unelected professionals. The term &#x27;technocratic&#x27; has been applied to governments where a cabinet of elected professional politicians is led by an unelected prime minister, such as in the cases of the 2011-2012 Greek government led by economist Lucas Papademos and the Czech Republic&#x27;s 2009–2010 caretaker government presided over by the state&#x27;s chief statistician, Jan Fischer. In December 2013, in the framework of the national dialogue facilitated by the Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet, political parties in Tunisia agreed to install a technocratic government led by Mehdi Jomaa.

The Syrian Salvation Government, the predecessor to the Syrian transitional government, was characterized by observers as an authoritarian technocracy.

The article &quot;Technocrats: Minds Like Machines&quot; states that Singapore is perhaps the best advertisement for technocracy: the political and expert components of the governing system there seem to have merged completely. This was underlined in a 1993 article in &quot;Wired&quot; by Sandy Sandfort, where he describes the information technology system of the island even at that early date making it effectively intelligent.

===Engineering===
Following Samuel Haber, Donald Stabile argues that engineers were faced with a conflict between physical efficiency and cost efficiency in the new corporate capitalist enterprises of the late nineteenth-century United States. Because of their perceptions of market demand, the profit-conscious, non-technical managers of firms where the engineers work often impose limits on the projects that engineers desire to undertake.

The prices of all inputs vary with market forces, thereby upsetting the engineer&#x27;s careful calculations. As a result, the engineer loses control over projects and must continually revise plans. To maintain control over projects, the engineer must attempt to control these outside variables and transform them into constant factors.

==Technocracy movement==

The American economist and sociologist Thorstein Veblen was an early advocate of technocracy and was involved in the Technical Alliance, as were Howard Scott and M. King Hubbert (the latter of whom later developed the theory of peak oil). Veblen believed technological developments would eventually lead to a socialistic reorganization of economic affairs. Veblen saw socialism as one intermediate phase in an ongoing evolutionary process in society that would be brought about by the natural decay of the business enterprise system and the rise of the engineers. Daniel Bell sees an affinity between Veblen and the Technocracy movement.

In 1932, Howard Scott and Marion King Hubbert founded Technocracy Incorporated and proposed that money be replaced by energy certificates. The group argued that apolitical, rational engineers should be vested with the authority to guide an economy into a thermodynamically balanced load of production and consumption, thereby doing away with unemployment and debt.

The technocracy movement was briefly popular in the US in the early 1930s during the Great Depression. By the mid-1930s, interest in the movement was declining. Some historians have attributed the decline to the rise of Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal.

Historian William E. Akin rejects this conclusion. Instead, Akin argues that the movement declined in the mid-1930s due to the technocrats&#x27; failure to devise a &#x27;viable political theory for achieving change&#x27;. Akin postulates that many technocrats remained vocal, dissatisfied, and often sympathetic to anti-New Deal third-party efforts.

==Critiques==
Critics have suggested that a &quot;technocratic divide&quot; exists between a governing body controlled to varying extents by technocrats and members of the general public. Technocratic divides are &quot;efficacy gaps that persist between governing bodies employing technocratic principles and members of the general public aiming to contribute to government decision making.&quot; Technocracy privileges the opinions and viewpoints of technical experts, exalting them into a kind of aristocracy while marginalizing the opinions and viewpoints of the general public.

As major multinational technology corporations (e.g., FAANG) swell market caps and customer counts, critiques of technocratic government in the 21st century see its manifestation in American politics not as an &quot;authoritarian nightmare of oppression and violence&quot; but rather as an &quot;éminence grise&quot;: a democratic cabal directed by Mark Zuckerberg and the entire cohort of &quot;Big Tech&quot; executives. In his 1982 &quot;Technology and Culture&quot; journal article, &quot;The Technocratic Image and the Theory of Technocracy&quot;, John G. Gunnell writes: &quot;...politics is increasingly subject to the influence of technological change&quot;, with specific reference to the advent of The Long Boom and the genesis of the Internet, following the 1973–1975 recession. Gunnel goes on to add three levels of analysis that delineate technology&#x27;s political influence:

# &quot;Political power tends to gravitate towards technological elites&quot;.
# &quot;Technology has become autonomous&quot; and thus impenetrable by political structures.
# &quot;Technology (and science) constitute a new legitimizing ideology&quot;, as well as triumphing over &quot;tribalism, nationalism, the crusading spirit in religion, bigotry, censorship, racism, persecution, immigration and emigration restrictions, tariffs, and chauvinism&quot;.

In each of the three analytical levels, Gunnell foretells technology&#x27;s infiltration of political processes and suggests that the entanglement of the two (i.e. technology and politics) will inevitably produce power concentrations around those with advanced technological training, namely the technocrats. Forty years after the publication of Gunnell&#x27;s writings, technology and government have become, for better or for worse, increasingly intertwined. Facebook can be considered a technocratic microcosm, a &quot;technocratic nation-state&quot; with a cyberspatial population that surpasses any terrestrial nation. In a broader sense, critics fear that the rise of social media networks (e.g. Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, Pinterest), coupled with the &quot;decline in mainstream engagement&quot;, imperil the &quot;networked young citizen&quot; to inconspicuous coercion and indoctrination by algorithmic mechanisms, and, less insidiously, to the persuasion of particular candidates based predominantly on &quot;Social Media engagement&quot;.

In a 2022 article published in &quot;Boston Review&quot;, political scientist Matthew Cole highlights two problems with technocracy: that it creates &quot;unjust concentrations of power&quot; and that the concept itself is poorly defined. With respect to the first point, Cole argues that technocracy excludes citizens from policy-making processes while advantaging elites. With respect to the second, he argues that the value of expertise is overestimated in technocratic systems, and points to an alternative concept of &quot;smart democracy&quot; which enlists the knowledge of ordinary citizens.

<doc id="1325125" wikidata="Q645712" url="?curid=1325125" title="Club cell">
<text>Club cells, also known as bronchiolar exocrine cells, are low columnar/cuboidal cells with short microvilli, found in the small airways (bronchioles) of the lungs. They were formerly known as &quot;Clara cells&quot;.

Club cells are found in the ciliated simple epithelium. These cells may secrete glycosaminoglycans to protect the bronchiole lining. Bronchiolar cells gradually increase in number as the number of goblet cells decrease.

One of the main functions of club cells is to protect the bronchiolar epithelium. They do this by secreting a small variety of products, including club cell secretory protein uteroglobin, and a solution similar in composition to pulmonary surfactant. They are also responsible for detoxifying harmful substances inhaled into the lungs. Club cells accomplish this with cytochrome P450 enzymes found in their smooth endoplasmic reticulum. Club cells also act as a stem cell, multiplying and differentiating into ciliated cells to regenerate the bronchiolar epithelium.

==Function==
The respiratory bronchioles represent the transition from the conducting portion to the respiratory portion of the respiratory system. The narrow channels are usually less than 2 mm in diameter and they are lined by a simple cuboidal epithelium, consisting of ciliated cells and non-ciliated club cells, which are unique to bronchioles. In addition to being structurally diverse, club cells are also functionally variable. One major function they carry out is the synthesis and secretion of the material lining the bronchiolar lumen. This material includes glycosaminoglycans, proteins such as lysozymes, and conjugation of the secretory portion of IgA antibodies. These play an important defensive role, and they also contribute to the degradation of the mucus produced by the upper airways. The heterogeneous nature of the dense granules within the club cell&#x27;s cytoplasm suggests that they may not all have a secretory function. Some of them may contain lysosomal enzymes, which carry out a digestive role, either in defense: Club cells engulf airborne toxins and break them down via their cytochrome P-450 enzymes (particularly CYP4B1, which is only present in the club cells) present in their smooth endoplasmic reticulum; or in the recycling of secretory products. Club cells are mitotically active. They divide and differentiate to form both ciliated and non-ciliated epithelial cells.

==Clinical significance==
Club cells contain tryptase, which is believed to be responsible for cleaving the hemagglutinin surface protein of influenza A virus, thereby activating it and causing the symptoms of flu. When the l7Rn6 protein is disrupted in mice, these mice display severe emphysema at birth as a result of disorganization of the Golgi apparatus and formation of aberrant vesicular structures within club cells.
Malignant club cells are also seen in bronchioalveolar carcinoma of the lung.
Serum club cell proteins are used as a biomarker of lung permeability. Exposure to particulate air pollution may compromise the integrity of the lung epithelium and lead to rapid increase in epithelial barrier permeability, as reflected by increased serum club cell concentrations.

==History==
Club cells were previously called &quot;Clara cells&quot;, as they were first described by Max Clara (1899–1966), in 1937. Clara was an active member of the Nazi Party and used tissue taken from executed victims of Nazi Germany for his research—including the work that led to his discovery of Clara cells. 
In May 2012, the editorial boards of most of the major respiratory journals (including the journals of the American Thoracic Society, the European Respiratory Society and the American College of Chest Physicians) concluded that the continued use of Clara&#x27;s eponym would be equivalent to honoring him; they therefore introduced a name-change policy, which went into effect beginning January 1, 2013.
The term &quot;Clara&quot; was used parenthetically after &quot;club cell&quot; for a 2-year period, after which &quot;Clara cell&quot; and &quot;Clara cell secretory protein&quot; were conclusively replaced with &quot;club cell&quot; and &quot;club cell secretory protein&quot;, respectively.

<text>Deborah V. Ortiz (born March 19, 1957, in Sacramento) is an American politician from Sacramento, California. A Democrat, she served in both chambers of the California State Legislature. A then-member of Sacramento City Council, Ortiz was elected to the California State Assembly in 1996 and served a single two-year term representing the 9th Assembly district. In 1998, she was elected to the California State Senate from the 6th Senate district with 55% of the vote and won re-election in 2002 with 70.8% of the vote. Term limits prevented her from seeking a third Senate term in 2006; she instead ran unsuccessfully for Secretary of State.

==Sacramento City Council==

===Election===
Ortiz was first elected to public office in a special election in March 1993 when she was elected to the Sacramento City Council. In a field of six candidates, Ortiz received 36% of the vote and was elected to the seat of Joe Serna who had been elected Mayor of Sacramento in November 1992. Prior to that she had served as Chief of Staff to then State Assemblyman Richard Polanco and as a leader at the Latino Coalition for Fair Sacramento Redistricting.

Ortiz had also served on the Sacramento County Planning Commission, the Oak Park Project Area Committee and the UC Davis Medical Center Community Advisory Board.

===Accomplishments===
Ortiz was known as a major advocate for Oak Park, the neighborhood where she lived and was raised. Oak Park had a long history as one of the most blighted and crime ridden neighborhoods in the City of Sacramento. Ortiz authored ordinances to hold absentee landlords accountable by imposing penalties on neglected vacant properties and she established a cash reward program for reporting of illegal dumping in neighborhoods. Ortiz also authored an ordinance that required gun dealers to register with the police department and precluded them from locating near schools and day care centers. In 1995, Ortiz managed to have US Bank open the first new bank in Oak Park in thirty years.

==1996 Assembly bid==
After nearly four years on the city council, Ortiz decided to run for the Assembly seat that Phil Isenberg, a former Mayor of Sacramento was vacating due to term limits. In the Democratic primary, she faced County Supervisor Roger Dickinson and Bill Camp. In a three-way race, Ortiz defeated Dickinson and Camp by over 50%. Ortiz was easily elected in the November general election against token opposition.

==Legislative issues==
Ortiz focused on health and passed the first law in the nation protecting embryonic stem cell research. She was the first legislator to ban sodas from primary and middle schools when she passed SB 677 in 2003. Ortiz passed laws that created the California Biomonitoring Program, established the California Lead Abatement standards program, established the standards for Chromium 6 in drinking water, and created the California Department of Public Health. Ortiz also authored the historic Cal Grant Scholarship Program that guarantees college grants for poor and working class students who attend California schools.

Ortiz is well known for authoring the California Freedom of Access to Clinic and Church Entrances Act (or California FACE Act) and the Reproductive Rights Law Enforcement Act in 2001. Passed by the Legislature and signed into law by Governor Davis, the law protects reproductive health care clients, providers and assistants and also worshipers and places of worship. Motivated by attacks on abortion patients, providers, clinics, and clinic escorts, it targets crimes, not First Amendment-protected speech.

She also authored laws that required criminal background checks for school employees after the death of Michelle Montoya at Rio Linda High School. Michelle Montoya was brutally raped and murdered on a school campus by a janitor that had been released from prison for manslaughter. Montoya was the daughter of a friend of Ortiz.

Ortiz also passed laws to create funding for ovarian cancer research and laws to ensure access to emergency contraception.

Ortiz also authored SB 400 that allowed public employees to receive more generous pensions and provided local government the authority to vote to increase public employee pensions. Many argue that changes enacted by the bill have contributed to fiscal crisis in the State of California.

==2006 bid for Secretary of State==
Ortiz was termed out of office in 2006 having served two terms in the Senate. Thus, she decided to run for Secretary of State against incumbent Bruce McPherson. However, Ortiz lost the June 6, 2006 Democratic primary to fellow State Senator Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey) who ended up defeating McPherson in November.

==Personal==
Ortiz was born and raised in the Oak Park neighborhood of the City of Sacramento. Ortiz attended UC Davis for her undergraduate studies and received her Juris Doctor degree from McGeorge School of Law. Ortiz was elected to the Los Rios Community College Board of Trustees in 2010 and reelected in 2014.

<doc id="1325168" wikidata="Q13645463" url="?curid=1325168" title="M-10001">
<text>The Union Pacific Railroad&#x27;s M-10001 was a diesel-electric streamlined train built in 1934 by Pullman-Standard with a power system developed by General Motors Electro-Motive Corporation using a Winton 201A Diesel engine and General Electric generator, control equipment and traction motors. It was the UP&#x27;s second streamliner after the M-10000, their first equipped with a diesel engine and was a longer train (six cars) than its three-car predecessor. All cars were articulated—trucks were shared between each car. It was delivered on October 2, 1934, and was used for display, test and record-setting runs for the next two months before being returned to Pullman-Standard for an increase in power and capacity, following which it was placed into service as the &quot;City of Portland&quot; train. It has been nicknamed &quot;The Banana&quot;.

== Record-setting run ==
In October 1934 the M-10001, known as the &quot;Canary Bolt&quot; and still with its original engine, set an as-yet unbroken record of 57 hours from coast to coast of the United States, leaving Los Angeles at 10 PM on the 22nd and arriving Grand Central Terminal at 9:55 AM on the 25th. When placed in service as the &quot;City of Portland&quot; the train reduced the Chicago, Illinois to Portland, Oregon schedule from 58 hours to 40 hours without any upgrades to track or other facilities.

== Technical details ==

When built, the M-10001 was a fully articulated six-car train, in length, comprising a power car, a Railway Post Office/baggage car, three Pullman sleeping cars, and a rounded-tail coach/buffet/observation car. It was powered by a V12 version of the Winton 201-A engine, driving the first two trucks of the train. Pre-service testing revealed that the original engine was overtaxed, and that the truck design resulted in unstable oscillations at high speeds; in December 1934 the trainset was returned to Pullman to get a larger engine and lengthened trucks. Martin P. Blomberg carried that experience with truck design to the Electro-Motive Corporation, reflected in the design of their E series locomotives.

The rebuilding lengthened the train to and seven cars. The power car had added to accommodate a V16 Winton diesel engine. The RPO/baggage car was lengthened by to take a steam generator for train heating, and was followed by an added diner/lounge car.

The Winton Diesel engine was the most powerful Diesel engine used in a passenger train until the postwar era. It was installed in Union Pacific&#x27;s locomotive units built during 1935–36, after which twin engine designs became preferred.

== Service life ==
The rebuilt train was re-delivered on May 23, 1935, and after some test runs was dedicated as the first &quot;City of Portland&quot; on June 5 at the Portland Rose Festival, entering service between Portland and Chicago the following day. It remained in that service until 1938 when it was replaced by the M-10002 trainset, reassigned from the &quot;City of Los Angeles&quot;. After serving on the Portland-Seattle run it was retired in June 1939; the &quot;City of Denver&quot; trains needed more power and Union Pacific cannibalized M-10001 and M-10004. By December the diesel engine, generator, trucks, and the steam generator from the RPO/baggage car were removed and installed in a new carbody to become the third power unit on the CD-07 set for the &quot;City of Denver&quot;. Two sleeping cars were refurbished and added to the former M-10004 car set, which served as a spare &quot;City of Denver&quot; set, then in 1941 was assigned to service as &quot;City of Portland,&quot; powered by an EMC E3 locomotive set. The remainder of the train was stored until August 13, 1941, when it was sold for scrap.

<text>Thomas Allen Brown (May 24, 1937 – April 4, 2020), known also as Timothy Brown, Tim Brown, and Timmy Brown, was an American actor, singer, and professional football player. He played in the National Football League (NFL) as a running back and return specialist.

==Early life==
Born in Richmond, Indiana, Brown was raised in Knightstown, east of Indianapolis. Brown had six siblings, of which he was the second-oldest. When he was eight years old, Brown&#x27;s parents divorced, primarily due to his father&#x27;s drinking habits and time spent away from home in the Army. From there, he bounced between homes until he settled into a boarding school with his brother, John Brown Jr.

Brown is a 1955 graduate of Morton Memorial High School at the Indiana Soldiers&#x27; and Sailors&#x27; Children&#x27;s Home.
At the Soldiers&#x27; and Sailors&#x27; Home, Brown excelled as a star athlete in football, basketball, and track. He received around 15 scholarships to play collegiate basketball, and only one football scholarship to play for Michigan State. However, he had no interest in playing anywhere except Ball State--at the time an NAIA-level program--and decided to walk on to play football.

==Football career==
Brown played college football for the Ball State Cardinals. Although he had initially been recruited as a basketball player, he chose to play football instead. Despite a personal feud with head coach Jim Freeman which almost led to Brown quitting the team, he agreed to play as long as he would never have to speak with Freeman. Despite this, Brown excelled as a star running back and returner for the Cardinals. In his senior season, Brown led the Indiana Collegiate Conference in rushing and scoring, finished second in punting, and was selected to the All-ICC first team and the All-America second team. For his collegiate career, Brown set six Cardinal records: best rushing average for a single game (20.5), most net yards in a single game (164), best rushing average in a season (10.0), most rushing attempts in a game (21), most rushing attempts in a season (112), and most points scored in a single game (25—a record that still stands today). He also earned a varsity letter in track, participating in his junior and senior years.

Brown was selected by the Green Bay Packers in the 27th round of the 1959 NFL draft. Brown feuded with head coach Vince Lombardi and struggled early in the preseason with dropped passes. Brown was cut by Green Bay following a week one 9–6 victory over the Chicago Bears in which he fumbled a snap whilst holding for a field goal.

Brown then signed with the Philadelphia Eagles, where he would play eight seasons as a returner and running back. In his first year, the Eagles won the 1960 NFL Championship Game over his former team in what would be Lombardi&#x27;s only playoff loss. While playing for Philadelphia, Brown enlisted in the Army National Guard to make ends meet. Brown would have his greatest football moment on November 6, 1966 against the Dallas Cowboys, a 24–23 win in which he scored both a 90-yard and a 93-yard kickoff return (and almost a third if not for a trip-up with his own teammate after a 21-yard return). He is the only Eagle (and the first of nine NFL players ever) to return two kickoffs for touchdowns in the same game.

The Cowboys-Eagles rivalry can have much of its nucleus attributed to a hit Brown took in the December 10, 1967 matchup. In the second half, Brown was hit in the face by Lee Roy Jordan chasing an overthrown pass. Brown lost three teeth, fractured his jaw, and broke a permanent bridge in his mouth. Jordan&#x27;s hit—which Brown and his teammates claimed was both a late hit and an intentional elbow toward Brown&#x27;s mouth—sidelined him for the remainder of the season.

 After initially planning to retire, Brown would play one more season in 1968 for the Baltimore Colts. He scored the last touchdown in the 1968 NFL Championship Game and his final game was two weeks later in Super Bowl III with the Colts. He would finish with 80 return yards in the Colts&#x27; historic 16–7 loss to the New York Jets.

Brown went to the Pro Bowl in 1962, 1963, and 1965. He led the league twice in all-purpose yards, in 1962 and 1963 with 2,306 and 2,428 yards, respectively. He also led the league in kick returns and return yards twice, in 1961 and 1963.

He was inducted into the Philadelphia Eagles Hall of Fame in 1990. Then known as the Eagles Honor Roll, he was the only member to be inducted that year.

Brown also served as a color analyst for CBS NFL telecasts in 1973. In 1969, Brown was approached by Frank Gifford and Howard Cosell to be an on-air talent for ABC&#x27;s &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;, but declined the offer to pursue his career in acting.

==Acting career==
Brown used the name &quot;Timothy Brown&quot; as an actor, to more clearly distinguish himself from Jim Brown, the Cleveland Browns running back who also became an actor.

Brown&#x27;s acting career began while he was still an active player, with a guest appearance on the Season 3 premiere of &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot; as Clint Cartwheel in the episode titled &quot;The Night of the Bubbling Death&quot;, which originally aired on September 8, 1967.

After retiring from the NFL, he became a full-time actor, appearing in such films as &quot;MASH&quot; (1970), &quot;Sweet Sugar&quot; (1972), &quot;Black Gunn&quot; (1972), &quot;Bonnie&#x27;s Kids&quot; (1973), &quot;Girls Are for Loving&quot; (1973), &quot;Dynamite Brothers&quot; (1974), &quot;Nashville&quot; (1975), &quot;Zebra Force&quot; (1976), &quot;Black Heat&quot; (1976), &quot;Gus&quot; (1976) and &quot;Midnight Ride&quot; (1990). He also appeared in a half-dozen episodes of the first season of the &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; television series as Dr. Oliver Harmon &quot;Spearchucker&quot; Jones, but was dropped from the show. While it was reported that was due to the producers learning there were no African American surgeons serving in Korea during the Korean War, the producers said it was due to not feeling they could come up with meaningful stories involving that character when they were concentrating on writing stories about the characters Hawkeye and Trapper John. Along with Gary Burghoff, G. Wood, and Corey Fischer, he is one of only four actors who appeared in both the original &quot;MASH&quot; movie and the spin-off television series.

He made three guest appearances in the 1960s–1970s TV show &quot;Adam-12&quot; and appeared in a Season 1 episode of &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; with opposite guest star and previous &quot;MASH&quot; co-star John Schuck. Both played retired NFL players vying for a job as sportscaster.

==Music==

===1950s and 60s===
Brown began singing when he was attending Ball State. He performed in a band called &#x27;Timmy Brown and the Thunderbirds&#x27;. His band included three white students at a time when interracial bands were quite rare.

In 1962, Brown recorded with Imperial Records (Travis Music Co. &amp; Rittenhouse Music, Inc.) &quot;I Got Nothin&#x27; But Time&quot; and &quot;Silly Rumors&quot; while still in the NFL. The songs were written by N. Meade and V. McCoy and produced and arranged by Jerry Ragavoy.

In 1964, he headed a stage show at the Steel Pier in Atlantic City, New Jersey. When his part of the show came up, Brown backed by a nine piece orchestra started off with &quot;What&#x27;d I Say. Other songs he performed were &quot;Do You Want to Know a Secret&quot;, &quot;This Land Is Your Land&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot;. He made a guest appearance on &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret,&quot; during which he sang a song of the same name.

===1970s===
In addition to appearing in the 1975 film &quot;Nashville&quot;, his vocals appeared on the soundtrack.

==Later years==
Brown became a father in 1987 with the birth of his first and only son, Sean. In later years, Brown worked as a correctional officer in Los Angeles. In the 2000s, he had retired and was residing in Palm Springs, California. Brown died on April 4, 2020, of complications from dementia at the age of 82. Two years later, the biography &quot;Running Against the Grain&quot; by Roy Weaver, David Sullivan, and Shawn Sriver about Brown&#x27;s life was released. In 2024, Timmy Brown was celebrated by Ball State Athletics on Juneteenth with multiple tributes to his life.

<text>The New Railway Link through the Alps (NRLA; , , ), is a Swiss construction project for faster north–south rail links across the Swiss Alps. It consists of two axes with several improvements along these rails including three new base tunnels several hundred metres below the existing apex tunnels, the Gotthard Base Tunnel, the Lötschberg Base Tunnel, and the Ceneri Base Tunnel. Swiss Federal Railways subsidiary AlpTransit Gotthard AG and BLS AG subsidiary BLS Alp Transit AG (now BLS Netz AG) were founded for this project and built the tunnels.

The total projected cost of the project was CHF 12.189 billion at its 1998 start; in December 2015, its final cost was projected to be CHF 17.900 billion. The 1998 projected total cost of the Gotthard Base Tunnel was CHF 6.323 billion; in December 2015, its final cost was projected to be CHF 9.560 billion. It opened on 1 June 2016, and became operational on 11 December of that year. The Ceneri Base Tunnel was opened on 3 September 2020 and became fully operational in December 2020 and is an important feeder for the Gotthard Base Tunnel. A decision to fully complete the second tube of the Lötschberg Base Tunnel was made in early-2024, with an estimated cost of CHF 1.7 billion and construction expected to extend from 2026 to 2033.

== Political background ==

During late-1980s and early-1990s negotiations with the European Economic Community (the predecessor of the EU), Switzerland demanded a limitation on transalpine truck traffic. When the EEC refused, Swiss negotiators instead proposed a heavy-vehicle fee (HVF), a kilometre-based tax on freight vehicles, for all lorries above 3.5 tonnes and offered to build a high-speed rail link through the Alps for intermodal freight transport.

Swiss voters approved the rail link in a 27 September 1992 mandatory referendum. The EU accepted the Swiss offer in 2000, but requested that the extant 28-tonne weight limit for lorries be raised to 48 tonnes. The parties eventually compromised on a 40-tonne weight limit. The bilateral Land Transport Agreement with the European Union was signed, agreeing to an increase of the kilometer-based tax (HVF; , , ) on HGVs from 1.6 ct/tkm to 1.8 ct/tkm when the NRLA was completed. The condition was deemed fulfilled at the completion of the first track of the Lötschberg Base Tunnel in 2007.

Other relevant Swiss legislation includes the 1994 Alps initiative, which prohibits road-building in the Alps and encourages the transport of as many transalpine goods as possible by rail rather than road, and the 1998 Traffic Transfer Act, which sets an ideal maximum number of trucks crossing the Alps by road. Meeting this goal requires a fully functional NRLA rail link.

The original plans for the NRLA were to construct only one main base tunnel, but regional disputes prevented a choice between the two options and threatened to jeopardize the entire project. The Swiss Federal Council therefore decided in 1995 to build two base tunnels (Gotthard and Lötschberg) simultaneously.

In 1998, the total projected cost of the NRLA project was CHF 12.189 billion; in December 2015, the final cost was projected to be CHF 17.900 billion. The projected cost of its centerpiece, the Gotthard Base Tunnel, was CHF 6.323  billion in 1998; in December 2015, the tunnel&#x27;s cost was an estimated CHF 9.560 billion. The 1998 cost of the Lötschberg axis was an estimated CHF 3.214 billion; in December 2015, it was an estimated CHF 4.237 billion.

Swiss voters approved the NRLA project on 27 September 1992, with 63.6% support.

Two years later on 20 February 1994, the Swiss populace unexpectedly also accepted with 51.9% support the Alps protecting initiative, a federal popular initiative initiated by just a few private citizens. This was despite neither the Federal Council nor the two parliamentary chambers endorsing the initiative, and their not even considering providing a counterproposal to the populace.

Another mandatory referendum was held on 19 November 1998 about the creation of funds for four major public-transport projects (, , ), funding them with time-limited CHF 30 billion fund of which the NRLA would receive 13.6 billion. Another major project was the Bahn 2000 project regarding the modernization of the railways. The Federal Council&#x27;s request was approved with 63.5% support. The fund is replenished primarily by the previously mentioned kilometre-based tax on heavy-goods vehicles (HVF) and partially by taxes on gasoline originally intended for road-building, a small fraction of the VAT revenues, and funds from the general budget of the Swiss Confederation.

The bilateral agreements with the EU containing the 40-tonne limit and the implementation of the HVF were finally accepted by the Swiss populace on 21 May 2000 with 67.2% support in a federal optional referendum initiated by opposing political parties.

== Gotthard axis ==

The Gotthard axis consists of the Gotthard Base Tunnel (GBT), the partially operational Zimmerberg Base Tunnel, the Ceneri Base Tunnel (CBT), and surface connections. It was built by AlpTransit Gotthard under contract from the Swiss Federal Government. The axis is the first flat trans-alpine rail link, with a maximum elevation of above sea level.

This enables a high-speed link through the Alps with a top speed of , reducing travel time between Zürich and Milan from previously four hours to currently three-and-a-half hours.

The Gotthard Base Tunnel is the world&#x27;s longest and deepest traffic tunnel, as was the original Gotthard Tunnel at its completion in 1881. It consists of two parallel single-track tunnels, connected by 178 cross-connections. There are two emergency stations in each tunnel, each connected to the corresponding opposite-tunnel emergency station. These stations are equipped with water supplies to refill firefighter and rescue trains. One (Porta Alpina) was proposed as an 800m deep rail station, but that proposal was rejected on both economic and technical grounds. AlpTransit Gotthard handed the completed tunnel over to the Swiss government on 31 May 2016. It was formally opened in a ceremony the next day, during which the tunnel was conveyed to its operator: Swiss Federal Railways (SBB CFF FFS).

== Lötschberg axis ==
The Lötschberg axis, with the Lötschberg Base Tunnel (LBT) in the Bernese Alps, was built by BLS Alp Transit. It supports the western transit network via Basel, Olten, Bern, Brig, Domodossola and Milan. The tunnel replaces the existing higher-altitude 1913 Lötschberg Tunnel for most traffic. The base tunnel opened to traffic on 7 December 2007; it was the first part of the NRLA to be delivered, but is only partially completed. Because of NRLA cost overruns, funding for the axis was diverted to the Gotthard Base Tunnel and only one of the tunnel&#x27;s two bores has been completed and is fully equipped for rail use. 14 kilometers of the other bore are completed; 14 kilometers are excavated but not equipped, and 7 kilometers have not been excavated. High-speed switches allow the completed 40% of the second bore to be used as a passing track, but the of single track without passing loops complicates operations and greatly reduces the line capacity. Trains are scheduled by batches in each direction which are separated by long intervals; trains more than seven minutes late are routed via the old line or must wait for the next available timetable slot in their direction in the tunnel, causing major further delays. A planning contract for the completion of the second track of the LBT was awarded in 2016. The resulting plan was presented in Spring 2019, with options of either only fitting out the existing 14 km of unequipped tunnels or fully completing the second tube. In early-2024 the choice was made to go for the full option, with an estimated cost of CHF 1.7 billion and an expected delivery date of 2033. That choice is naturally more expensive and will take two years longer, but it provides a much higher capacity and avoids fully closing the line for eight months. 

The second part of the Lötschberg axis is the Simplon Tunnel, completed in 1905 as a single-track base tunnel and augmented with a second bore in 1921. It connects Upper Valais to Northern Italy&#x27;s Piedmont region.

<text>Hugh le Despenser, 1st [[Baron le Despenser]] (1223 – 4 August 1265) was an important ally of Simon de Montfort during the reign of Henry III. He served briefly as &quot;Justiciar&quot; of England in 1260 and as Constable of the Tower of London. 

Despenser first played an important part in 1258, when he was prominent on the baronial side in the Mad Parliament of Oxford. In 1260 the barons chose him to succeed Hugh Bigod as Justiciar, and in 1263 the king was further compelled to put the Tower of London in his hands.

He was the son of Hugh le Despenser and was summoned to Parliament by Simon de Montfort. Hugh was summoned as Baron le Despenser on 14 December 1264 and was Chief Justiciar of England and a leader of the baronial party, so he might be deemed a baron, though the legality of that assembly is doubtful. He remained allied with Montfort to the end, and was present at the Battle of Lewes. He was killed fighting on de Montfort&#x27;s side at the Battle of Evesham in August 1265. He was slain by Roger Mortimer, 1st Baron Wigmore; this caused a feud to begin between the Despenser and Mortimer families.

By his wife, Aline Basset, he was father of Hugh Despenser &#x27;the elder&#x27;, who became an advisor to Edward II and was made Earl of Winchester. Aline was the daughter of Philip Basset, who had also served as Justiciar. They also had a daughter named Eleanor le Despenser, who married Sir Hugh de Courtenay, feudal baron of Okehampton.

<text>Hugh le Despenser (1 March 126127 October 1326), sometimes referred to as &quot;the Elder Despenser&quot;, was for a time the chief adviser to King Edward II of England. He was created a baron in 1295 and Earl of Winchester in 1322. One day after being captured by forces loyal to Sir Roger Mortimer and Edward&#x27;s wife, Queen Isabella, who were leading a rebellion against Edward, he was hanged and then beheaded.

==Ancestry==
Despenser was the son of Hugh le Despencer (1223–1265, briefly Justiciar of England) and Aline Basset, only daughter and heiress of Philip Basset. His father was killed at the Battle of Evesham when Hugh was a boy, but Hugh&#x27;s patrimony was saved through the influence of his maternal grandfather, who had been loyal to the king.

==Life==

Despenser served Edward I on numerous occasions both in battle and as a diplomat, and was created a baron by writ of summons to Parliament in 1295. His son, Hugh Despenser the Younger, became a favourite of Edward II, in what was rumoured to be a homosexual relationship. Hugh the Elder was loyal to his son and the King, which worried the barons. Until that time, the highest office he had held was justice of the forests.

He was one of the few barons to remain loyal to Edward during the controversy regarding Piers Gaveston. Despenser became Edward&#x27;s loyal servant and chief administrator after Gaveston was executed in 1312, but the jealousy of other barons—and, more importantly, his own corruption and unjust behaviour—led to his being exiled along with his son in 1321, when Edmund of Woodstock, Earl of Kent replaced him as Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports.

Edward found it difficult to manage without them, and recalled them to England a year later, an action which enraged Queen Isabella, the more so when Despenser was created Earl of Winchester in 1322. Although his reputation was not as unsavoury as his son&#x27;s, Despenser the Elder was accused by a significant number of people of widespread criminality during the next few years, often involving false accusations of trespass or theft and the extortion of money or land.

==Death==
When Isabella, Queen of England, and Sir Roger Mortimer led a rebellion against her husband Edward, they captured both Despensers—first the elder, later the younger. Following Hugh the Elder&#x27;s capture at the Siege of Bristol, Isabella interceded for him, but his enemies, notably Mortimer and Henry, Earl of Lancaster, insisted that both father and son should face trial and execution.

One day after being captured, the elder Despenser was hanged in his armour at Bristol on 27 October 1326. He was then beheaded, after which his body was cut into pieces and fed to dogs. His head was sent to be displayed in Winchester, which had supported the king. Despenser&#x27;s Winchester title was forfeit, not to be revived until 1472. The younger Despenser was hanged, drawn and quartered at Hereford the following month.

After Despenser&#x27;s death, pardons were issued to thousands of people whom he had falsely accused.

==Marriage and issue==
He married Isabel de Beauchamp, a daughter of William de Beauchamp, 9th Earl of Warwick (–1298) by his wife Maud FitzJohn, and widow of Sir Patrick de Chaurces. By his wife he had two sons and several daughters, including: 
*Hugh Despenser the Younger;
*Philip le Despenser (grandfather of Philip le Despenser, 1st Baron le Despenser);
*Isabel le Despenser, second wife of John Hastings, 1st Baron Hastings and second wife of Ralph de Monthermer, 1st Baron Monthermer;
*Margaret le Despenser, wife of John de St Amand, 1st Baron Amand (1283/6–1330).

<text>Hugh Despenser, 1st Baron Despenser (1287/1289 – 24 November 1326), also referred to as &quot;the Younger Despenser&quot;, was the son and heir of Hugh Despenser, Earl of Winchester, (the Elder Despenser) and his wife Isabel Beauchamp, daughter of William Beauchamp, 9th Earl of Warwick. He rose to national prominence as royal chamberlain and a favourite of Edward II of England. Despenser made many enemies amongst the nobility of England. After the overthrow of Edward, he was eventually charged with high treason and ultimately hanged, drawn and quartered.

==Titles and possessions==
Despenser the Younger rose to become Chamberlain and a close advisor to King Edward II, much as Despenser the Elder had been. Despenser the Younger claimed the Lordship of Glamorgan in 1317 through his wife Eleanor de Clare. He then accumulated more lands in the Welsh Marches and in England. At various points he was a knight of Hanley Castle in Worcestershire, Constable of Odiham Castle, and the Keeper of Bristol Castle, Portchester Castle and Dryslwyn Castle plus their respective towns, and the region of Cantref Mawr in Carmarthenshire.

He was also Keeper of the castles, manor, and lands of Brecknock, Hay, Cantref Selyf, &quot;etc.&quot;, in County Brecon, and also Huntington, Herefordshire, in England.

He was additionally given Wallingford Castle in Berkshire, despite this having previously been given to Queen Isabella of France for life.

==Marriage==
In May 1306, Despenser was knighted at the Feast of the Swans at Westminster Abbey alongside Prince Edward, and in that summer he married Eleanor de Clare, daughter of powerful noble Gilbert de Clare, and Joan of Acre. Eleanor&#x27;s grandfather, Edward I, had owed the elder Despenser 2,000 marks, a debt which the marriage settled. When Eleanor&#x27;s brother, Gilbert, was killed in 1314 at the Battle of Bannockburn, she unexpectedly became one of the three co-heiresses to the rich Gloucester earldom, and in her right, Hugh inherited Glamorgan and other properties. In just a few years Hugh went from a landless knight to one of the wealthiest magnates in the kingdom.

Eleanor was also the niece of the new king, Edward II of England, and this connection brought Despenser closer to the English royal court. He joined the baronial opposition to Piers Gaveston, the king&#x27;s favourite (and Despenser&#x27;s brother-in-law, through Gaveston&#x27;s marriage to Eleanor&#x27;s sister Margaret). Eager for power and wealth, Despenser seized Tonbridge Castle in 1315, after his brother-in-law&#x27;s death under the misapprehension that it belonged to his mother-in-law; he relinquished it on discovering that the rightful owner was, in fact, the Archbishop of Canterbury. He was accused of having Llywelyn Bren, a Welsh hostage in his custody, hanged, drawn and quartered on his own authority in 1318, despite the fact that Llywelyn had been &quot;promised leniency&quot; by Roger Mortimer and the earl of Hereford. However, this may actually have been done &quot;at the command of the king himself&quot;, with Despenser being blamed because Mortimer and Hereford &quot;could not publicly demonstrate their anger at&quot; King Edward.

Eleanor and Hugh had nine children who survived infancy:

#Hugh le Despenser (c. 1308/9 – 8 February 1349), Baron le Despenser, who was summoned to Parliament in 1338. At his death without issue, his nephew Edward, son of his brother Edward, was created Baron le Despenser in 1357.
#Edward le Despenser (c. 1310 – 30 September 1342), soldier, killed at the siege of Vannes; father of Edward Despenser, Knight of the Garter, who became Baron le Despenser in a new creation of 1357
#Isabel le Despenser, Countess of Arundel (c. 1312 – aft. 1356), the first wife of Richard Fitzalan, 10th Earl of Arundel. The marriage was annulled and their child, Edmund, was disinherited.
#Joan le Despenser (c. 1314 – 15 November 1384), nun at Shaftesbury Abbey
#Gilbert le Despenser (c. 1316 – April 1382)
#John le Despenser (c. 1317 – June 1366)
#Eleanor le Despenser (c. 1319 – February 1351), nun at Sempringham Priory
#Margaret le Despenser (c. August 1323 – 1337), nun at Whatton Priory
#Elizabeth le Despenser (c. December 1325 – 13 July 1389), married Maurice de Berkeley, 4th Baron Berkeley.

==Political maneuverings==
Despenser became royal chamberlain in 1318. As a royal courtier, he manoeuvred into the affections of King Edward, displacing the previous favourite, Roger d&#x27;Amory. This came much to the dismay of the baronage as they saw him both taking their rightful places at court at best, and at worst being the new, worse Gaveston. By 1320 his greed was running free. He also supposedly vowed revenge on Roger Mortimer, because Mortimer&#x27;s grandfather had killed his own. By 1321, he had earned many enemies in every stratum of society, from Queen Isabella in France, to the barons, to the common people. There was even a plot to kill Despenser by sticking his wax likeness with pins.

Finally the barons took action against King Edward and, at the beseeching of Queen Isabella, forced Despenser and his father into exile in August 1321. However, Edward&#x27;s intent to summon them back to England was no secret. The king rallied support after an attack against Isabella&#x27;s party at Leeds Castle, an event possibly orchestrated. Early in the following year, with Mortimer&#x27;s barons busy putting down uprisings in their lands, the Despensers were able to return. Edward, with the Despensers backing him once more, was able to crush the rebellion, securing first Mortimer&#x27;s surrender and then that of the earl of Lancaster, who was subsequently executed.

King Edward quickly reinstated Despenser as royal favourite. The period from the Despensers&#x27; return from exile until the end of Edward II&#x27;s reign was a time of uncertainty in England. With the main baronial opposition leaderless and weak, having been defeated at the Battle of Boroughbridge, and Edward willing to let them do as they pleased, the Despensers were left unchecked. This maladministration caused hostile feeling for them and, by extension, Edward II. Ultimately, a year after his surrender and imprisonment, Mortimer escaped to France, where he began organizing a new rebellion.

==Criminality==
Like his father, the younger Despenser was accused of widespread criminality. Amongst other examples, Despenser seized the Welsh lands of his wife&#x27;s inheritance while ignoring the claims of his two brothers-in-law. He further cheated his sister-in-law Elizabeth de Clare out of Gower and Usk, and forced Alice de Lacy, 4th Countess of Lincoln, to give up her lands to him. Both he and his father were accused of murdering Llywelyn Bren in 1318 while the Welshman was being held hostage in what was characterised by contemporaries as an extrajudicial killing, &quot;conspiring together to exercise a jurisdiction which they could not lawfully have&quot;. During his exile, Despenser spent a period of time as a pirate in the English Channel, &quot;a sea monster, lying in wait for merchants as they crossed the sea&quot;. At his makeshift trial, he would be accused &quot;of robbing two great ships to the value of £60,000 &#x27;to the great dishonour of the king and the realm and to the great danger of English merchants in foreign countries&#x27;&quot;. He also had Sir William Cokerell &quot;arrested and imprisoned&quot; in the Tower of London and extorted £100 from him.

===Accusations of sodomy===
The 14th-century court historian Jean Froissart wrote that &quot;he was a sodomite&quot;, and Adam Orleton, the Bishop of Winchester, also levelled the accusation at him (although Orleton&#x27;s accusation came when he was defending himself from having claimed the same of King Edward). According to Froissart, Despenser&#x27;s penis was severed and burned at his execution as a punishment for his sodomy and heresy. In 1326, as Isabella and Mortimer invaded, Orleton gave a sermon in which he publicly denounced Edward, who had fled with Despenser, as a sodomite. The annals of Newenham Abbey in Devon recorded, &quot;the king and his husband&quot; fled to Wales.

==Relationship with Isabella and downfall==
Queen Isabella had a special dislike for Despenser. While Isabella was in France to negotiate between her husband and the French king, she formed an alliance with Roger Mortimer and began planning an invasion of England, which ultimately came to fruition in September 1326. Their forces numbered only about 1,500 mercenaries to begin with, but the majority of the nobility rallied to them throughout September and October, preferring to stand with them rather than Edward and the hated Despensers.

The Despensers fled west with the King, with a sizeable sum from the treasury; however, the escape was unsuccessful. Separated from the elder Despenser, the King and the younger Despenser were deserted by most of their followers and were captured near Neath in mid-November. King Edward was imprisoned and later forced to abdicate in favour of his son Edward III. The elder Despenser was hanged and then beheaded at Bristol on 27 October 1326, and the younger Despenser was brought to trial.

==Trial and execution==
Anticipating that he would receive no mercy, Despenser tried to starve himself before his trial, but he was unsuccessful. &quot;In order to legalise the process against him the tribunal that had sat in judgement on the elder Despenser was reconvened. Roger [Mortimer], the Earls of Lancaster, Kent and Norfolk, and Thomas Wake and William Trussell&quot; presided.

Despenser was tried on 24 November 1326, taken to the market square of Hereford, before Mortimer, Isabella and the Lancastrian lords. He was accompanied by former Lord Chancellor of England Robert Baldock, and by one of his vassals, Simon de Reading, &quot;who had been so presumptuous as to insult the queen and to take the lands of [Mortimer&#x27;s] follower John Wyard&quot;, with de Reading being &quot;tried alongside him&quot;. A large crowd of people &quot;had gathered with trumpets and drums, ready to pull Despenser apart with their bare hands if need be.&quot; The prisoners were crowned with nettles to symbolise the &quot;crime of accroaching royal power&quot;, while their surcoats bore &quot;their coats of arms reversed&quot;, to proclaim their &quot;treachery&quot;. Despenser&#x27;s &quot;tunic bore a Latin verse from the New Testament: &quot;Quid gloriaris in malicia qui potens est in iniquitate?&quot; (&#x27;Why do you glory in malice, you who are mighty in iniquity?&#x27;)&quot; He was dragged to the ground by the crowd, who &quot;stripped off his clothes and scrawled biblical slogans on his skin&quot; which denounced &quot;arrogance and evil&quot;.

The tribunal&#x27;s &quot;judgement was thorough, extensive and uncompromising. Only the sentence was in doubt. The Lancastrians wanted Despenser to be sentenced and beheaded at one of his own castles, in the same way that the earl of Lancaster had died at Pontefract in 1322.&quot; Historian Ian Mortimer argues that Mortimer, on the other hand, &quot;wanted to ensure that Despenser suffered a death every bit as horrific&quot; as that endured by Llywelyn Bren (although his role in Llywelyn&#x27;s execution was not mentioned in the extensive list of charges against him), while Queen Isabella &quot;wanted him executed in London. The number of aggrieved parties meant that Despenser was certain to be quartered: every lord wanted a piece to show their followers that they had exacted revenge.&quot;

Trussell declared that he had been &quot;ajudged a traitor and an enemy of the realm&quot;, and read out the &quot;exhaustingly long&quot; list of charges against him, including:

Despenser was condemned to death. For the crime of theft, he was sentenced to hanging, while his treason was to be punished by drawing and quartering. He was subsequently &quot;roped to four horses - not just the usual two - and dragged through the city to the walls of his own castle&quot; to &quot;a specially made 50-foot gallows, designed to make punishment visible to everyone in the town.&quot; There he was hanged, drawn and quartered in the presence of Isabella, Mortimer and their followers. Simon de Reading was also hanged, on a gibbet &quot;ten feet lower&quot; than Despenser&#x27;s. Robert Baldock, as an archdeacon, was able to claim benefit of clergy, and was &quot;handed over to his fellow clergymen for trial&quot;. However, after being taken to London, &quot;the mob broke into the house in which he was held, beat him almost to death, and threw him into Newgate prison, where he was soon finished off by the inmates.&quot;

In 14th century historian Jean Froissart&#x27;s account of his execution, Despenser was tied firmly to a ladder and his genitals sliced off and burned while he was still conscious. His entrails were slowly pulled out. Finally, his heart was cut out and thrown into a fire, &quot;because it had been false and traitorous&quot;. Froissart (or, rather, Jean le Bel&#x27;s chronicle, on which he relied) is the only source to mention this; other contemporary accounts state that Despenser was hanged, drawn and quartered, which did not usually involve emasculation.

Despenser&#x27;s corpse was decapitated &quot;to a chorus of ecstatic cheers&quot;, and the head sent to be displayed above the gates of London. The &quot;arms, torso and legs were likewise sent to be displayed above the gates of Newcastle, York, Dover and Bristol. Justice was very visibly and viscerally done.&quot;

==Remains==
Four years later, in December 1330, his widow was given permission to gather and bury Despenser&#x27;s remains at the family&#x27;s Gloucestershire estate, but only the head, a thigh bone and a few vertebrae were returned to her.

What may be the remains of Despenser were identified in February 2008 in the village of Abbey Hulton in Staffordshire, the former site of Hulton Abbey. The skeleton, which was first uncovered during archaeological work in the 1970s, appeared to be that of a victim of a drawing and quartering as it had been beheaded and chopped into several pieces with a sharp blade, suggesting a ritual killing. Furthermore, it lacked several body parts, including the ones given to Despenser&#x27;s wife. Radiocarbon analysis dated the body to between 1050 and 1385, and later tests suggested it to be that of a man over 34 years old; Despenser was 39 at the time of his execution. In addition, the abbey is located on lands that belonged to Hugh de Audley, Despenser&#x27;s brother-in-law, at the time.

==Legacy==
&quot;The Tyranny and Fall of Edward II: 1321–1326&quot; by historian Natalie Fryde is a study of Edward&#x27;s reign during the years that the Despensers&#x27; power was at its peak. Fryde pays particular attention to the subject of the Despensers&#x27; landholdings. The numerous accusations against the younger Despenser at the time of his execution have never been the subject of close critical scrutiny, although Roy Martin Haines called them &quot;ingenuous&quot; and noted their propagandistic nature.

Despenser is a minor character in Christopher Marlowe&#x27;s play &quot;Edward II&quot; (1592), where, as &quot;Spencer&quot;, he is little more than a substitute for the dead Gaveston. Despenser also appears as a character in Maurice Druon&#x27;s historical fiction series &quot;Les Rois maudits,&quot; along with its television adaptations. In 2006, he was selected by &quot;BBC History&quot; magazine as the 14th century&#x27;s worst Briton.

<text>The Daylesford Spa Country Railway (which is operated by the Central Highlands Tourist Railway) is a volunteer-operated gauge tourist railway located in Victoria, Australia. It operates on a section of the closed and dismantled Daylesford line, and currently runs services between Daylesford and the hamlet of Bullarto.

==History==

===Victorian Railways era===
The original line was opened in two stages, from the mainline junction at Carlsruhe to the town of Trentham, on 16 February 1880. The remainder of the line, from Trentham to Daylesford, was opened a month later on 17 March. The line initially had significant goods and passenger traffic, with 50,000 passengers travelling the line in 1884 alone. However, over the next seventy years, both traffic and the quality of line gradually degraded, until the last passenger service was replaced with a road coach in 1978.

===Reopening as a tourist railway===
The Central Highlands Tourist Railway was founded two years later, and set about restoring the railway to operating condition. After several years of restoration, trolley services commenced from Daylesford station to a temporary terminus located in the Wombat State Forest, a distance of 3.2 km, in the latter half of the 1980s. On 15 September 1990 rail services commenced between Daylesford and the nearby hamlet of Musk, a distance of 5.4 km. Another 3.8 km of line was opened on 17 March 1997, allowing services to operate as far as Bullarto, 9.2 km from Daylesford. As Bullarto station had been demolished, this required building a new platform and installing a portable station building.

In 2002, the organisation changed its trading name from the Central Highlands Tourist Railway to the Daylesford Spa Country Railway.

On the evening of 23 February 2009, bushfires in the Daylesford region destroyed 1.6 kilometres of track running through the Wombat State Forest, with about 2000 sleepers destroyed, rails buckled, and the last two broad-gauge cattle pits on a running railway in Victoria destroyed. As a result, services were truncated, running out of Daylesford on the 1.7 km of line which remained unaffected. The repairs were expected to cost $250,000.

In August 2010, services over the first 5.4 km from Daylesford to Musk were reinstated after repairs to the damaged section through the forest, and the rest of the line through to Bullarto was reopened in December 2013.

==Current operations and extension plans==
The railway operates every Sunday, with five return services to Bullarto and one to Musk on its regular time table. In 2017, the railway commenced operations on Wednesdays during the school holidays with three return services to Bullarto. On the first Saturday evening of each month, the railway operates the Silver Streak Food and Wine Train., although these have been suspended since March 2020 

The railway also runs the famous Daylesford Sunday Market within the station grounds, which has been an important part of the railway&#x27;s activities since the early 1980s.

In 2018 a new platform opened adjacent to the Passing Clouds winery at Musk, opening up new opportunities for passengers to enjoy the hospitality of the winery and travel there by vintage train.

For many years, there have been plans to re-open the line from Bullarto to Trentham, which is 9.7 km from Bullarto and 18.9 km from Daylesford. While these plans were on the back burner for some time, this re-opening is now in planning and is considered a priority project by Hepburn Shire Council. The project will see the reopening of the disused Lyonville and Trentham stations, and the construction of a new station at Wombat Forest. However no date has been set for when the Bullarto-Trentham section will reopen.

<text>Ammoperdix is a small genus in the pheasant family Phasianidae of the order Galliformes. 
==Species==
It contains two similar species:



The see-see partridge occurs in southwest Asia, and the sand partridge in Egypt and the Middle East. Both are resident breeders in dry, open country, often in hill areas.

Both partridges in this genus are long, rotund birds. They are mainly sandy brown, with wavy white and brown stripes on their flanks. The males have distinctively-patterned grey heads, but the females are very washed-out in comparison, and this lack of a distinctive head pattern makes it more difficult to distinguish their species.

When disturbed, &quot;Ammoperdix&quot; partridges prefer to run rather than take to the air, but if necessary they will fly a short distance on rounded wings.

<text>James Runciman (August, 1852 – 6 July 1891) was an English teacher, author and journalist.

He was born at Cresswell, a village near Morpeth in Northumberland, son of Walter Runciman, a coastguardman, and Jean Finlay. He was educated at Ellington school, and then for two years (1863–5) in the naval school at Greenwich, Kent, becoming afterwards a pupil-teacher at North Shields ragged school. After an interval spent at the British and Foreign School Society&#x27;s Training College for Teachers in the Borough Road (Borough Road College, which later moved to Isleworth), he entered the service of the London School Board, acting as master successively of schools at Hale Street, Deptford, at South Street, Greenwich and at Blackheath Hill.

While still a schoolmaster, he read for himself at night, and attempted journalism. He soon wrote regularly for &quot;The Teacher&quot;, &quot;The Schoolmaster&quot;, and &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;; of the last paper he became sub-editor in 1874. In January 1874, he matriculated at the University of London, and passed the first bachelor of science examination in 1876. About 1880, while continuing his school-work, he was sub-editor of &quot;London&quot;, a short-lived newspaper, edited by W. E. Henley.

Subsequently he confined himself solely to the profession of journalism. As a writer on social or ethical topics, he proved himself equally vigorous and versatile, but his best literary work described the life of the fishermen of the North Sea, with whom he spent many of his vacations.

A series of seafaring sketches, which he contributed to the &quot;St. James&#x27;s Gazette&quot;, was reprinted as &#x27;The Romance of the Coast&#x27;. He dedicated his &#x27;Dream of the North Sea&#x27;, a vivid account of the fishermen&#x27;s perils, to Queen Victoria, who accepted the dedication. He died prematurely, of overwork, at Tyneside, Minerva Road, Kingston upon Thames, Surrey.

<text>&quot;I&#x27;m Only Sleeping&quot; is a song by the English rock band the Beatles from their 1966 studio album &quot;Revolver&quot;. In the United States and Canada, it was one of the three tracks that Capitol Records cut from the album and instead included on &quot;Yesterday and Today&quot;, released two months before &quot;Revolver&quot;. Credited as a Lennon–McCartney song, it was written primarily by John Lennon.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fontenot/About&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The track includes a backwards lead guitar part played by George Harrison, the first time such a technique was used on a pop recording.&lt;ref name=&quot;McCormick/Tele&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the standardisation of the Beatles&#x27; catalogue for its international CD release in 1987, the song has appeared on &quot;Revolver&quot; in North America. The 1996 &quot;Anthology 2&quot; compilation includes outtakes of the song from the &quot;Revolver&quot; sessions, including an instrumental version that features the Beatles&#x27; first use of a vibraphone. In 2018, the music staff of &quot;Time Out London&quot; ranked &quot;I&#x27;m Only Sleeping&quot; at number 12 on their list of the best Beatles songs.

==Background and inspiration==
The first draft of Lennon&#x27;s lyrics for &quot;I&#x27;m Only Sleeping&quot;, written on the back of a letter from 1966, suggests that he was writing about the joys of staying in bed rather than any drug euphoria sometimes read into the lyrics. While not on tour, Lennon would usually spend his time sleeping, reading, writing or watching television, often under the influence of drugs, and would have to be woken by McCartney for their songwriting sessions. In a London &quot;Evening Standard&quot; article published on 4 March 1966, Maureen Cleave, a friend of Lennon, wrote: &quot;He can sleep almost indefinitely, is probably the laziest person in England. &#x27;Physically lazy,&#x27; he said. &#x27;I don&#x27;t mind writing or reading or watching or speaking, but sex is the only physical thing I can be bothered with any more.

==Recording==
The recording of the song began at EMI Studios on 27 April 1966 with eleven takes of the rhythm track, comprising two acoustic guitars, bass and drums. Five further takes of the song were recorded but they were not used. Take 11 was chosen as the master and two days later Lennon added his lead vocals. On 5 May, George Harrison wrote and recorded the double guitar part. The next day the recording was completed by Lennon, McCartney and Harrison&#x27;s backing vocals.

The song features the then-unique sound of a reversed guitar duet played by Harrison in a five-hour late-night recording session with producer George Martin. Harrison perfected the part with the tape running backwards so that, when reversed, it would fit the dreamlike mood. One guitar was recorded with fuzz effects, the other without. Engineer Geoff Emerick described the meticulous process as &quot;interminable&quot;. &quot;I can still picture George hunched over his guitar for hours on end&quot;, Emerick wrote in 2006, &quot;headphones clamped on, brows furrowed in concentration.&quot;

During the break before the second bridge, the sound of a yawn can be heard, preceded by Lennon saying to McCartney, &quot;Yawn, Paul.&quot;

==Release==
&quot;I&#x27;m Only Sleeping&quot; was first released on 20 June 1966 as the second track on the US album &quot;Yesterday and Today&quot; and on 5 August 1966 as the third track on &quot;Revolver&quot;, the album for which the song was originally intended. The US version of &quot;Revolver&quot; did not include the song as it had already been released: US Beatles releases frequently differed from the British versions.

The mono and stereo versions of &quot;I&#x27;m Only Sleeping&quot; differ in the positioning and length of the backwards guitar parts:

*US mono version (mixed on 12 May 1966): No backwards track during the second verse but a quick fragment is heard on the &quot;time&quot; in &quot;taking my time&quot; and &quot;ceiling&quot; in &quot;lying there and staring at the ceiling&quot;. The track is fully intact during the instrumental break and continues into the words &quot;please don&#x27;t&quot; in &quot;please don&#x27;t spoil my day&quot;. Near the end of the song the backwards track starts four beats after the last word &quot;sleeping&quot;.
*US rechannelled stereo version: This version was mixed from the US mono version of the song but has far more reverb. It was used only on the initial pressing of the &quot;Yesterday and Today&quot; album.
*US stereo version (20 May): Backwards track on &quot;running everywhere at such a speed&quot; and &quot;till they find there&#x27;s no need&quot;. The track fades in two bars into the solo but continues into the word &quot;please&quot; in &quot;please don&#x27;t spoil my day&quot;. At the end of the song, the track starts immediately after the word &quot;sleeping&quot;.
*UK mono version (6 June): Backwards track on &quot;where at such a speed&quot;, &quot;there&#x27;s no need&quot; and &quot;staring at the ceiling&quot;. The track stops at the end of the solo and at the end of the song, starts immediately after the word &quot;sleeping&quot;. Of the five mixes of &quot;I&#x27;m Only Sleeping&quot;, this version features the most extensive amount of backwards guitar.
*UK stereo version: Backwards track on &quot;everywhere at such a speed&quot; and &quot;find there&#x27;s no need&quot;. The track stops at the end of the solo and at the end of the song, starts immediately after the word &quot;sleeping&quot;.

The Beatles&#x27; pioneering studio effects on &quot;Revolver&quot; proved highly influential on other contemporary artists. Musicologist Walter Everett cites the inclusion of backwards guitar parts on Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash&#x27;s 1969 song &quot;Pre-Road Downs&quot; as an apparent &quot;homage&quot; to &quot;I&#x27;m Only Sleeping&quot;.

Since the release of the Beatles&#x27; music on CD in 1987, the UK stereo version of the album has become the standard version in the US. Part of an instrumental rehearsal of the song featuring a vibraphone and the first take of the song from 29 April 1966 were released on the 1996 album &quot;Anthology 2&quot;. The inclusion of the vibraphone part marked the Beatles&#x27; first use of this instrument and reflected the band&#x27;s experimentation with new sounds during the &quot;Revolver&quot; sessions. The UK mono version of &quot;I&#x27;m Only Sleeping&quot; was released on CD as part of the 2009 &quot;The Beatles in Mono&quot; remastered box set.

===Music video===

An official music video, directed by Em Cooper, was released to YouTube on 1 November 2022. It won the Grammy Award for Best Music Video at the 66th Annual Grammy Awards in 2024.

==Covers==
The Suggs version reached the Top Ten of the UK Singles Chart in 1995.

<text>Ramsey Kanaan is a Lebanese-Scottish publisher and distributor of anarchist literature. In 1987, he founded AK Press, named after his mother, Ann Kanaan. In 2007, he founded PM Press, where he remains the publisher.

Kanaan is one of the founders of the Bay Area Anarchist Book Fair and is a member of Bound Together Books in San Francisco, a collectively run anarchist bookstore.

In the 1980s he was the singer of the Scottish anarcho-punk band Political Asylum.

== Early life and career ==

Kanaan was born around 1966 and was raised in Stirling, Scotland. His family was apolitical but encouraged reading. His parents were supportive of Kanaan&#x27;s early politics; Kanaan&#x27;s father sewed the patches on his son&#x27;s jacket before his death when Kanaan was 15. In high school during the late 1970s, he had embraced punk rock and anarchist politics, the former via his younger brother. The punk community was a prominent subculture in his region, and Kanaan was attracted to the politics of its music as well as its anger, its ideas and its melody and harmony. He was particularly drawn to the anti-nuclear movements, and participated in the peace movement, anti-Poll Tax movement, and the Miner&#x27;s Strike. His closest friends did not share his politics or musical taste.

He entered Do-It-Yourself fanzine culture via his interest in reading and politics. He read books about anarchism via the United Kingdom&#x27;s interlibrary loan system, ordering from the bibliographies of books he received. Kanaan bought his first zine during a 1980 anti-nuclear march in west Scotland. In 1981, he met members of the independent London bookstore Housmans, who mentored him in publishing and distribution. Kanaan began to distribute fanzines with Political Asylum interviews and works co-published with Housmans people. His first catalog, in the early 1980s, had 300 items. He decided to name the distribution entity &quot;AK Press&quot; after his mother, Anne Kanaan.

Kanaan lived in Edinburgh for ten years, grew AK Press, and participated in activism. Friends from the anti-Poll Tax movement approached him about starting a radical bookstore in Edinburgh, which did not materialize but led Kanaan to expand AK Press into a three-person worker co-op. Kanaan tabled for AK Press at punk and folk music shows.

Kanaan was involved in bringing the London anarchist bookfair format to San Francisco, which he said was the first of its kind in North America.

He left AK Press with others in the 2000s to form PM Press with a focus on a wider variety of literature and propaganda. PM published materials that AK did not, such as fiction, DVDs, and CDs, mainly with the perspective of sharing their politics with a larger audience than nonfiction could reach alone.

<text>William Henry Smith (7 July 1792 – 28 July 1865) was an English entrepreneur whose business included both newsagents and book shops. He was born at Little Thurlow, Suffolk, but ran his business in London, where he died. The family business evolved into the chain W H Smith.

==Career==

Born the son of Henry Walton Smith and Anna Eastaugh, William Henry Smith was brought up by his mother following the death of his father when he was only a few weeks old. His parents established a news vendor in Little Grosvenor Street, London, the precursor of W H Smith in 1792.

In 1812, following the death of Zaccheus Coates, a business associate of his mother, he went into the family business in partnership with his mother and his brother. In 1816 his mother died and the business was equally divided between him and his brother Henry Edward Smith. William proved the more capable businessman of the two, and the firm became known as W H Smith. After his father&#x27;s death, the business was valued at £1,280 (about ~£ in 2012, adjusted by inflation).

In 1846, he admitted his son as a partner, and the firm became W H Smith &amp; Son. Book stalls at railway stations proved an especially successful endeavour.

He is buried at Kensal Green Cemetery, London.

==Family==
In 1817, William Henry married Mary Ann Cooper, a rigorous practitioner of Wesley&#x27;s Protestantism: they married at St George&#x27;s, Hanover Square and eventually they had eight children: seven girls, and one boy, who was also named William Henry Smith.

<text>William Henry Smith, FRS (24 June 1825 – 6 October 1891) was an English bookseller and newsagent of the family firm W H Smith, who expanded the firm and introduced the practice of selling books and newspapers at railway stations. He was elected a Member of Parliament in 1868 and rose to the position of First Lord of the Admiralty less than ten years thereafter. Because of his lack of naval experience, he was perceived as a model for the character Sir Joseph Porter in &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot;. In the mid-1880s, he was twice Secretary of State for War, and later First Lord of the Treasury and Leader of the House of Commons, among other posts.

==Background and business career==
The son of William Henry Smith (1792–1865), Smith was born in London. He was educated at Tavistock Grammar School before joining his father&#x27;s newsagent and book business in 1846, at which time the firm became W H Smith &amp; Son. Both men took advantage of the railway boom by opening news-stands on railway stations, starting with Euston in 1848.

In 1850 the firm opened depots in Birmingham, Manchester and Liverpool. The business became a household name (W H Smith), and Smith junior used the success of the firm as a springboard into politics.

In February 1878, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.

==Political career==
In 1868, Smith was elected Member of Parliament for Westminster as a Conservative after an initial attempt to get into Parliament as a &quot;Liberal-Conservative&quot; in 1865 as a supporter of Prime Minister Lord Palmerston. In 1874, Smith was appointed Financial Secretary to the Treasury when Disraeli returned as Prime Minister. In 1877, he became First Lord of the Admiralty even though he never went to sea throughout his life. It has been claimed that Smith&#x27;s appointment was the inspiration for the character of Sir Joseph Porter, KCB, in Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s 1878 comic opera, &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot;.

Gilbert had written to Sullivan in December 1877, &quot;The fact that the First Lord in the opera is a &quot;Radical&quot; of the most pronounced type will do away with any suspicion that W. H. Smith is intended&quot;. However, the character was seen as a reflection on Smith, and even Disraeli was overheard to refer to his First Lord as &quot;Pinafore Smith&quot;. It has been suggested that the Pinafore character was as much based on Smith&#x27;s controversial predecessor as First Lord, Hugh Childers, as on Smith himself. Smith held the office for three years until the Liberals returned to power.

In 1885, a redistribution of seats led to Smith now standing for the Strand division in Westminster, and he served as Chief Secretary for Ireland for a short period the following year. He was twice Secretary of State for War, the first time during Lord Salisbury&#x27;s brief ministry between 1885 and 1886, and the second when the Conservatives won the 1886 general election. He succeeded this appointment in 1887 as First Lord of the Treasury and Leader of the House of Commons and became Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports in 1891.

He died shortly afterwards at Walmer Castle, Kent, and his widow was created Viscountess Hambleden in his honour and took the title from the village close to the Smiths&#x27; country house of Greenlands, near Henley-on-Thames, Oxon. One of the few ministers personally close to Lord Salisbury (apart from the Salisbury&#x27;s nephew, Arthur Balfour), Smith was dubbed &quot;Old Morality&quot; because of his austere manner and conduct.

==Family==
Smith married Emily, daughter of Frederick Dawes Danvers, in 1858. They had two sons and four daughters:

* Mabel Danvers Smith (d. 1956; she married the 5th Earl of Harrowby)
*Emily Anna Smith (1859–1942; she married Admiral William Acland)
*Helen Smith (1860–1944)
*Beatrice Danvers Smith (1864–1942)
*Henry Walton Smith (1865–1866)
*William Frederick Danvers Smith (1868–1928)

He died in October 1891, aged 66. The following month, his widow was raised to the peerage in his honour as Viscountess Hambleden, of Hambleden in the County of Buckingham. She died in August 1913 and was succeeded by her and Smith&#x27;s only surviving son, Frederick.

<doc id="1325249" wikidata="Q1665188" url="?curid=1325249" title="Institutional investor">
<text>An institutional investor is an entity that pools money to purchase securities, real property, and other investment assets or originate loans. Institutional investors include commercial banks, central banks, credit unions, government-linked companies, insurers, pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, charities, hedge funds,  real estate investment trusts, investment advisors, endowments, and mutual funds. Operating companies which invest excess capital in these types of assets may also be included in the term. Activist institutional investors may also influence corporate governance by exercising voting rights in their investments. In 2019, the world&#x27;s top 500 asset managers collectively managed $104.4 trillion in Assets under Management (AuM).

Institutional investors appear to be more sophisticated than retail investors, but it remains unclear if professional active investment managers can reliably enhance risk-adjusted returns by an amount that exceeds fees and expenses of investment management because of issues with limiting agency costs. Lending credence to doubts about active investors&#x27; ability to &#x27;beat the market&#x27;, passive index funds have gained traction with the rise of passive investors: the three biggest US asset managers together owned an average of 18% in the S&amp;P 500 Index and together constituted the largest shareholder in 88% of the S&amp;P 500 by 2015. The potential of institutional investors in infrastructure markets is increasingly noted after the financial crises in the early twenty-first century.

==History==
===Ancient Rome and Islam===

Roman law ignored the concept of juristic person, yet at the time the practice of private evergetism (which dates to, at least, the 4th century BC in Greece) sometimes led to the creation of revenues-producing capital which may be interpreted as an early form of charitable institution. In some African colonies in particular, part of the city&#x27;s entertainment was financed by the revenue generated by shops and baking-ovens originally offered by a wealthy benefactor. In the south of Gaul, aqueducts were sometimes financed in a similar fashion.

The legal principle of juristic person might have appeared with the rise of monasteries in the early centuries of Christianity. The concept then might have been adopted by the emerging Islamic law. The waqf (charitable institution) became a cornerstone of the financing of education, waterworks, welfare and even the construction of monuments.
Alongside some Christian monasteries the waqfs created in the 10th century AD are amongst the longest standing charities in the world (see for instance the Imam Reza shrine).

===Pre-industrial Europe===
Following the spread of monasteries, almshouses and other hospitals, donating sometimes large sums of money to institutions became a common practice in medieval Western Europe. In the process, over the centuries those institutions acquired sizable estates and large fortunes in bullion. Following the collapse of the agrarian revenues, many of these institutions moved away from rural real estate to concentrate on bonds emitted by the local sovereign (the shift dates back to the 15th century for Venice, and the 17th century for France and the Dutch Republic). The importance of lay and religious institutional ownership in the pre-industrial European economy cannot be overstated, they commonly possessed 10 to 30% of a given region arable land.

In the 18th century, private investors pool their resources to pursue lottery tickets and tontine shares allowing them to spread risk and become some of the earliest speculative institutions known in the West.

===Before 1980===
Following several waves of dissolution (mostly during the Reformation and the Revolutionary period) the weight of the traditional charities in the economy collapsed; by 1800, institutions solely owned 2% of the arable land in England and Wales. New types of institutions emerged (banks, insurance companies), yet despite some success stories, they failed to attract a large share of the public&#x27;s savings and, for instance, by 1950, they owned 48% of US equities and certainly even less in other countries.

==Overview==

Because of their sophistication, institutional investors may be exempt from certain securities laws. For example, in the United States, institutional investors are generally eligible to purchase private placements under Rule 506 of Regulation D as &quot;accredited investors&quot;. Further, large US institutional investors may qualify to purchase certain securities generally restricted from retail investment under Rule 144A.

In Canada, companies selling to accredited investors can be exempted from regulatory reporting by each of the provincial Canadian Securities Administrators.

===Institutional investors as financial intermediaries===
As intermediaries between individual investors and companies, institutional investors are important sources of capital in financial markets. By pooling constituents&#x27; investments, institutional investors arguably reduce the cost of capital for entrepreneurs while diversifying constituents&#x27; portfolios. Their greater ability to influence corporate behaviour as well to select investors profiles may help diminish agency costs. Moreover, institutional investors&#x27; role as financial intermediaries means they operate under different organizational structures and regulatory frameworks compared to individual blockholders. This unique positioning allows them to leverage their size and expertise to enforce better corporate governance practices.

===Institutional investors as limited partners, asset owners, and asset managers===
Within the various types of institutional investors, the roles of limited partners (LPs), asset owners, and asset managers are often conflated. In practice, these types of institutional investors play very different roles in the investment industry. Limited partners and asset owners have legal ownership of their assets and make asset allocation decisions. That is, the primary control over strategic asset allocation decisions rests with limited partners and asset owners, often in consultation with institutional investment consultants. Institutional investors such as pensions, endowments, foundations, and sovereign wealth funds are examples of institutional LPs and asset owners. Limited partners and asset owners may manage their assets directly. Alternatively, they may outsource some or all management of their assets to external asset managers.

In contrast, asset managers act as agents on behalf of limited partners and asset owners. Asset managers generally have little or no discretion on broad, strategic asset allocation decisions. However, asset managers generally have significant discretion regarding portfolio management, security selection, and risk management decisions, subject to any restrictions placed on them by their LPs and asset owners. Asset managers often have a duty to act as a fiduciary to their limited partners and asset owners. Namely, they must place the interests of their LPs and asset owners ahead of their own interests.

For a wide variety of reasons, LPs and asset owners may change asset allocations periodically which can lead to a shift of money, known as asset flows, from one asset class to another, or from one asset manager to another. Traditional asset managers invest in publicly traded equities or fixed income. In contrast, alternative asset managers, such as hedge funds and private equity firms, may invest in both traditional investments and alternative investments. Asset managers maintain relationships with their institutional LPs and asset owners through the process of investor relations. For example, investor relations processes may include the asset manager regularly communicating investment performance, as well as important changes to the investment process, investment team, etc.

===Institutional investment consultants===
Institutional investment consultants play an important role in the allocation of assets. These consultants act as an intermediary in an advisory capacity to institutional investors. They generally do not have discretion to manage the assets. Rather, they provide advice as to how the assets may be managed. Namely, they work closely with pension funds and other institutional investors providing independent investment advice that is meant to complement the institutional investors&#x27; knowledge and expertise. For example, a consultant may be hired by pension fund to advise the fund on portfolio construction, asset allocation, investment policy statements, performance monitoring, fund manager selection, etc. Institutional investors may also use these consultants as an extra layer of legal protection for their investment committees and boards by conveying that they adhere to industry best practices in their investment processes.

In various countries different types of institutional investors may be more important. In oil-exporting countries sovereign wealth funds are very important, while in developed countries, pension funds may be more important.

===Canada===
Some examples of important Canadian institutional investors are:
* Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (C$420.4 billion [2019])
* Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (C$340.1 billion [2019])
* Ontario Teachers&#x27; Pension Plan (C$207.4 billion [2019])

* OPSEU Pension Trust (C$22 billion)
* Canadian Pacific (C$14.3 billion)
* Canadian National (C$19.4 billion)

===China===
China&#x27;s program to allow institutional investors to invest in its capital market is called Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (QWFII).

===India===
In India, the term Foreign Institutional Investor (FII) is used to refer to foreign companies investing in India&#x27;s capital markets.

Recently FIIs have invested a total of $23 billion in the Indian market under this. With this, Foreign-exchange reserves of India have reached a total of $584 billion and it has become a new record in the Indian market.

Also called Foreign direct investment or FDI, statutory agencies in India like SEBI have prescribed norms to register FIIs and also to regulate such investments flowing in through FIIs. In 2008, FIIs represented the largest institution investment category, with an estimated US$751.14 billion.

Recently, FIIs recorded a net withdrawal of USD 770.67 million in a single trading day, including USD 440.86 million from equities, USD 327.44 million from debt, and USD 2.31 million from hybrid investments. Despite such withdrawals, total FII inflows for 2024 have remained positive at USD 18.241 billion, with fiscal year 2025 inflows at USD 8.924 billion, according to an SBI research report.

===Japan===
Japan is home to the world&#x27;s largest pension fund (GPI) and is home to 63 of the top 300 pension funds worldwide (by Assets Under Management). These include:
* Government Pension Investment Fund ($1045.5 billion [2011])
* Local Government Officials ($165 billion [2004])
* Pension Fund Association ($117 billion [2004])

===United Kingdom===
In the UK, institutional investors may play a major role in economic affairs, and are highly concentrated in the City of London&#x27;s square mile. Their wealth accounts for around two-thirds of the equity in public listed companies. For any given company, the largest 25 investors would have to be able to muster over half of the votes.

===United States===
Some examples of important U.S. institutional investors are:
* Alaska Permanent Fund ($73 billion [2021])
* Ensign Peak Advisors ($100 billion [2019])
* CalPERS ($389 billion [2020])
* CalSTRS ($282 billion [2021])

* University of Pennsylvania endowment ($21 billion [2023])
* University of Notre Dame endowment ($18.9 billion [2023])
* Columbia University endowment ($13.6 billion [2023])
* Duke University endowment ($18 billion [2023])

The major investor associations are:

*The Association of Investment Trust Companies

The IMA, ABI, NAPF, and AITC, plus the British Merchant Banking and Securities House Association were also represented by the Institutional Shareholder Committee (ISC). As of August 2014 the ISC effectively became the Institutional Investors Committee (IIC), which comprises the Association of British Insurers, the Investment Management Association and the National Association of Pension Funds.

<text>Ali Soilih M&#x27;Tsashiwa (; 7 January 1937 – 29 May 1978) was a Comorian socialist revolutionary and political figure who served as the 7th, 8th and 9th and President of the Comoros from 3 January 1976 to 13 May 1978.

==Biography==
Soilih was born in Majunga, Madagascar on 7 January 1937. He spent much of his early life there, and was educated in Madagascar and France. During the early 1960s, he traveled to Comoros, where he worked in agriculture and economic development.

===Rise to power===
In 1967, Ali Soilih was elected to the National Assembly. In 1970, Ali Soilih entered politics as a supporter of Said Ibrahim, leader of the Democratic Assembly of the Comoran People, &quot;Rassemblement démocratique du Peuple Comorien&quot; (RDPC). He was appointed minister of equipment and tourism. He soon developed an ideology of hostility towards France as the former colonial power. His ideas were socialist, and he renounced his Islamic faith and became an atheist.

On 3 August 1975, less than a month after Comoros gained independence from France, Soilih overthrew President Said Mohamed Jaffar and became head of a revolutionary council that took over Comoros. Soilih, whose adherents were barely armed, hired French mercenary Bob Denard to overthrow Ahmed Abdallah. He officially became President of the revolutionary council in January 1976. He acquired extensive powers under the terms of a new constitution and implemented socialist economic policies. In 1977 he held a referendum on his presidency, with 56.63% of voters endorsing it.

===Revolutionary program===
Soilih embarked on a revolutionary program that was mainly directed against the country&#x27;s traditional Muslim society. His vision, based on a mixture of Maoism and Islamic philosophies, was to develop the Comoros as an economically self-sufficient and ideologically progressive modern 20th-century state.

Condemned as wasteful and cumbersome, certain inherited customs of Comorian culture were abolished, like the &#x27;Anda&#x27;, the traditional &quot;grand marriage&quot;, as well as traditional funerary ceremonies, which were criticized for being too costly. Soilih advanced the cause of the youth by allowing young people to take more power. In order to reach his goal, he lowered the voting age to fourteen and put teenagers in positions of responsibility. Among the most striking of his reforms were measures designed to gain the favor of the youth, like the legalization of cannabis and promoting the removal of the veil among the women of Comoros.

Soilih created the &#x27;Moissy&#x27;, a young revolutionary militia trained by Tanzanian military advisers. The Moissy was a Comorian version of Mao Zedong&#x27;s Red Guards, and its methods were similar to those that had been employed by their Chinese counterpart during the Cultural Revolution.

===Consequences===
Soilih&#x27;s confrontational policies led to France terminating all aid and technical assistance programs to the Comoros, while traditional leaders of the islands resented the progressive elimination of age-old traditions. The teenage Moissy, commanded by a 15-year-old chosen only for his loyalty to the president, behaved with outrageous arrogance, raping any women who resisted their advances and killing anyone who questioned their authority in the slightest. Hence, they were viewed by Comorians as a repressive force. Growing discontent promoted by the political opposition resulted in four unsuccessful coup attempts against the Soilih regime during its two-and-a-half-year existence.

===Coup d&#x27;état and assassination===
On 13 May 1978, Soilih was finally overthrown by a force of 50 mercenaries, the majority of them former French paratroopers hired by exiled former leader Ahmed Abdallah and led by French Colonel Bob Denard. Abdallah became president, Soilih&#x27;s policies were reversed, and the name of the country was changed to &quot;Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros&quot;. On 29 May Soilih was shot and killed; according to the government, he had attempted to escape from house arrest. He was 41 years old when he died.

==Aftermath==
More than 10 years later, in 1989, Soilih&#x27;s older half-brother, Said Mohamed Djohar, overthrew Abdallah, possibly with the help of Denard. He served as president of the Comoros until 1996.

The effects of the social policies of Ali Soilih are still apparent throughout the Comoros, particularly on Anjouan.

<doc id="1325262" wikidata="Q1207526" url="?curid=1325262" title="Dhakeshwari Temple">
<text>Dhakeshwari National Temple () is a Hindu temple in Old Dhaka, Bangladesh. It is state-owned, giving it the distinction of being Bangladesh&#x27;s &#x27;National Temple&#x27;. The name &quot;Dhakeshwari&quot; (ঢাকেশ্বরী &quot;Ðhakeshshori&quot;) means &quot;Goddess of Dhaka&quot;. Bangladesh is the only country (only Muslim majority country) in the world to have a National Hindu Temple. It&#x27;s one of the holiest Shakta pithas where the gem of Devi sati&#x27;s crown fell but the gem is lost long ago and the main ancient Vigraha or stone murti is relocated to Kumortuli West Bengal during the partition time by the chief priest due to increased attacks on Hindu temples in Bangladesh.

Since the destruction of Ramna Kali Mandir in 1971 by the Pakistan Army during the Bangladesh Liberation War, the Dhakeshwari Temple has assumed status as the most important Hindu place of worship in Bangladesh. It is also the largest Hindu temple in Bangladesh. It is one of the Shakta pithas, the goddess-centric shrines of the Indian Subcontinent.

== History ==
The Dhakeshwari (Durga) temple was built in the 12th century, 1100 A.D. by Ballal Sen, a king of the Sena dynasty, and it is said that the city Dhaka was named after the Goddess. The current architectural style of the temple cannot be dated to that period because of the numerous repairs, renovations, and rebuilding which have taken place over time. It is considered an essential part of Dhaka&#x27;s cultural heritage. It is one of the Shakta pithas, where the jewel from the crown of the Goddess Sati had fallen. For ages, the temple has been held in great importance. The original 900-year-old murti was taken to Kumartuli, Kolkata, West Bengal, India. During the partition of India, she was brought to Kolkata from Dhaka with millions of Bengali Hindu refugees from East Bengal (now Bangladesh) of Pakistan. The Partition of Bengal in 1947 was a part of the Partition of India in 1947. In 1947, the Bengal Legislative Assembly claimed separate East Bengal (joined Pakistan in 1947) and West Bengal (joined India in 1947) as the home state for the Bengali Muslims and the Bengali Hindus respectively. In 1971, the East Pakistan (East Bengal) Provincial Assembly claimed separate Bangladesh (Bengalination) as the home country for the Bengali Muslims (East Pakistan Provincial Assembly was against the imposition of Urdu language as the national language of Pakistan), and then East Pakistan (East Bengal) became Bangladesh.

By 1950, the businessman Debendranath Chaudhary built the temple of Goddess in Kumortuli area and established some of the Goddess&#x27; property for her daily services. The idol is 1.5 feet tall, has ten arms, mounted on her lion in the form of Katyani Mahishasurmardini &#x27;Durga&#x27;. On her two sides are Laxmi, Saraswati, Kartik and Ganesh. A Tiwari family from Azamgarh was appointed by the royal family for daily worship of the deity. In 1946, the descendants of that family came to Calcutta and were re-appointed, where they still serve the Goddess continuously.

Current presiding deity here in Dhakeshwari Temple is the replica of the original idol.

It is widely believed that the Queen, wife of King Bijoy Sen went to Langolbond for bathing. On her way back she gave birth to a son, known to historians as Ballal Sen. After ascending to the throne, Ballal Sen built this temple to glorify his birthplace. Legends say that Ballal Sen once dreamt of the deity covered under the jungle. Ballal Sen uncovered the deity from there and built a temple, named for Dhakeswari. Whatever the legends describe, Hindus consider Dhakeswari to be the presiding deity of Dhaka, which is an incarnation or form of Goddess Durga the Adi Shakti. The idol of Durga is called Dhakeswari .

== Structure ==
=== Exterior view ===

Within the premises of the Dhakeswari there are temples of two types of architecture. The ancient one is of the Poncharotna Goddess Durga&#x27;s which lost its actual look after the renovation work. Bradly Bird wrote this at the beginning of this century. Other than this there are four Shiv Temples. According to hearsay, in the 16th century King Mansing built these temples by laying four Shiv Lingas there. But this information seems to be unreliable. The fusion of Bangla chowchala and shikor temple is notice in the architecture of Dhakeshawri. Ratan Lal Chakraborti in an article mentioned that &quot; the structure and architecture of it is like a Buddhist Pagoda&quot;. From this he assumed that the temple was probably built in the 10th century.

How did Dhakeshari temple look like in the 19th century? Ridoynath Majumder described about the temple. At that time the temple was covered by jungle and in its north the Urdu road went westward towards Pilkhana and at its south west was Mirpur road. At its south there was a wood and Urdu bazar was at the east.

=== Interior view ===

The temple was panchoratno, at its front Natamandir and around it there is a row of rooms and a big pond and nahobottola gate through which elephants used to pass. To the east there are tombs of some saints who used to pray or meditate at the temple. Outside the temple there are 5–6 pagodas with a shib linga. The priest of Dhakeshawri temple used pray every day. The deity is doshvuja. It is believed that the representation of the deity is made of gold. At the left and right side of the deity there are some other murti. Like many ancient temples its inside is dark. To see the deity light is to be arranged. The temple is owned by many because it is bought by the new caretaker from the old caretakers. Jotindramohan bought it in 1901. Dhakeshawri is crowded but it is an abode of peace. The low sound of the tongue mixes with the evening light and tune of temple bell and make the peaceful environment a happy event.

== Declaration as National Temple of Bangladesh ==

In 1996, Dhakeshwari Temple was renamed Dhakeshwari Jatiya Mandir (National Temple) reflecting its position as the centre of Hindu culture and worship in Bangladesh. This was the culmination of a major campaign by Bangladeshi Hindu groups who had been demanding official recognition for the primary Hindu place of worship following the declaration of Islam as the state religion in 1988. As a result, the flag of Bangladesh is hoisted every morning outside the main temple premises, and it follows the National Flag Code rules such as rendering half-mast on nationally declared days of mourning.

As is the practice in other leading religious places of worship in Bangladesh, day-long prayers are common practice during important national holidays such as Independence Day, Language Martyrs&#x27; Day, Victory Day and birth and death anniversaries of former leaders such as Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and Ziaur Rahman.

== Threats to temple security ==

Historically, several of the temple custodians were tortured and killed by the Army though most, including the Head Priest, fled to their ancestral villages then to India and therefore escaped death.

A significant portion of the temple land has been lost due to the Vested Property Act and confiscation by the Bangladesh Government, and the current premises are considerably lower than the historic reach of the property. Muslim mobs have attacked the temple complex once, in December 1992 (likely in retaliation for the destruction of the Babri Masjid in India).

== Religious and socio-cultural activities ==

Dhakeshwari Temple is a hub of socio-cultural as well as religious activity. Each year, the largest celebration of Durga Puja (the most important event in the Bengali Hindu calendar) in Dhaka is held at the National Temple, and a stream of dignitaries (such as the Bangladeshi President, Prime Minister, Leader of Opposition, Members of Parliament and media celebrities) come to felicitate the Bangladeshi Hindu community from the temple premises. A &quot;Bijaya Sammelani&quot; (cultural program following Durga Puja) takes place in the adjoining parade ground a few days after Durga Puja is complete, and is also a major cultural event in the Dhaka calendar, regularly attracting some of the top performers from the Dhaka music and film industry.

One of the most important events of the year is the Janmashthami procession which starts from Dhakeshwari temple and then proceeds through the streets of Old Dhaka; this occurs on the day of Lord Krishna&#x27;s birthday, which is also a public holiday in Bangladesh and second only to Durga Puja in importance in the Bengali calendar. The procession dates back to 1902 but was stopped in 1948 following the establishment of Pakistan and subsequent attacks by Muslim mobs in Dhaka. The procession was resumed in 1989.

Concerts and charity drives (such as flood relief) are also a regular fixture within the temple throughout the year. Each year, Dhakeshwari Temple hosts major blood drives and inoculation programs which are open to all residents of Dhaka city.

At the old time, festivals happened on the month of Chaitra in temple complex of Dhakeswari. This place was crowded by various coloured shops. Virtous people used to visit the temple to gather religious merit and get back to their home. Millions of Hindu religious people would take bath at Langolbondon on the month of Choitra on Sukla Ostomi time to get rid of their sins. People in huge numbers used to come to Dhakeswari temple on foot from different roads to be blessed by the deity Durga. It was the best moment of their whole year. With great hope they would come out from their home, and it was reflected on their faces, to get rid of their sins by worshiping the Deity with exclusive devotion and bowing their head to meditation of Bhagaban. They forget about everything- hunger, sleep, restlessness – and they just believe that they will be blessed and they step up for the temple. All those people were divided into small groups with each group having ten to twenty people. The groups consisted of mainly women, only one man, who is the oldest of the village, was there for taking care of them. They came from very long distance by forming groups. People of different ages, including the oldest and skinniest, were also gathered with these groups. Young people from the nearest city to the temple volunteering for the people would come from long distance to be blessed by the Deity, with a great concentration, eagerness to the worship of the Deity and often bowing by shouting &quot;Oom Dhaka eswari&quot;.

In present days, each year, the largest celebration of Durga puja (the most important event in the Bengali Hindu calendar) in Dhaka is held at the National Temple, and a stream of dignitaries come to felicitate the Bangladeshi Hindu community from the temple premises. Several thousand worshippers and onlookers stream through the premises where they are offered prasad (food – usually rice and lentils). A Bijaya Sammilan (a cultural program following Durga Puja) takes place in the adjoining parade ground a few days after Durga Puja is complete, and is also a major cultural event in the Dhaka calendar. Durga Puja comes to an end after five days, through the celebration of Bijoya Dashami after performing the sacred rituals of Sashthi, Saptami, Ashtami and Navami. Bijoya Dashami will end with the idols of Durga and her four children Lakshmi, Saraswati, Kartik and Ganesha taken in processions for immersion in river or sea. A processions starts from the temple.

Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi prayed at the temple during his official visit to Bangladesh on 7 June 2015. He was given a model of the goddess Dhakeshwari by the temple authorities.

== Present condition ==

It was severely damaged during the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War, and over half of the temple&#x27;s buildings were destroyed. The main worship hall was taken over by the Pakistan Army and used as an ammunitions storage area.

In 2018, the Bangladesh prime minister Sheikh Hasina visited the Dhakeshwari Temple and announced gifting of adjacent land to the temple authorities. Previously, the temple lost a lot of its property to land grabbing.

<doc id="1325264" wikidata="Q1381817" url="?curid=1325264" title="Olivier Tébily">
<text>Olivier Tébily (born 19 December 1975) is a former professional footballer who played as a defender. A French citizen, he won 18 full international caps for his native Ivory Coast national team. He played in the top level league in four countries: for Châteauroux in Division 1, for Celtic in the Scottish Premier League, for Birmingham City in the English Premier League, and for Toronto FC in Major League Soccer.

==Early life==
Tébily was born in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, and raised in France. As a child, he was an Arsenal fan. He became a naturalised French citizen.

==Career==
Tébily began his career as a junior at Division 2 club Niort, where he spent several years. In January 1998, he moved to Châteauroux, promoted that season to Division 1. While his contribution failed to prevent their relegation, it clearly attracted favourable attention, because the following March, Steve Bruce signed him for English club Sheffield United for a fee of £200,000.

His Sheffield United career proved brief. His seventh game for the club was watched by Kenny Dalglish, and on Dalglish&#x27;s appointment as Director of Football at Celtic in June 1999, he was quick to bring Tébily to the club for a fee of £1.25 million. On 8 July, he became manager John Barnes&#x27; third signing.

===Celtic===
Tébily marked his first Celtic appearance, in a pre-season game against Leeds United, by scoring an own goal, an early indication of the sometimes erratic nature of his performances which earned him the nickname &quot;Bombscare&quot; from the Celtic fans. The next pre-season game, this time against Newcastle United, saw him redeem himself by scoring at the right end, and also by a good defensive performance against Alan Shearer.

He held down a regular starting spot until Christmas, when he joined up with the Ivory Coast national team for the 2000 African Cup of Nations. His return from his country&#x27;s unsuccessful campaign was delayed when the squad was detained in a military camp in the Ivory Coast, described by the authorities as a necessary move to ensure the players&#x27; safety in light of the public reaction to their failure to reach the knockout stage of the competition. Tébily and the remainder of the squad were able to make their way home following intervention from FIFA president Sepp Blatter.

His next appearance for Celtic was in the shock Scottish Cup defeat at home to Inverness Caledonian Thistle which provoked the &quot;Super Caley go ballistic, Celtic are atrocious&quot; headline in &quot;The Scottish Sun&quot; and resulted in the sacking of John Barnes. Dalglish took over as manager until the end of the season, during which time Tébily appeared irregularly.

In the 2000–01 season, new manager Martin O&#x27;Neill gave him only three first-team starts. He began the next season in the first team and playing well, but lost his place once Bobo Baldé regained fitness. He still made enough appearances to qualify for an SPL winners&#x27; medal and received an unlikely nomination for the 2001 African Footballer of the Year award.

Tébily wanted to play regularly, which was not going to happen at Celtic, so it was considered best for all parties if he was made available for transfer. On 22 March 2002, he resumed his association with manager Steve Bruce when he moved to Birmingham City, then playing in the Championship, for a fee of £700,000. Celtic clearly thought he had potential for improvement, as they had a sell-on clause included in the deal. He had scored twice during his spell at Celtic, once in a UEFA Cup tie with Cwmbran Town and another in the 8–0 thrashing of Stirling Albion in the League Cup.

===Birmingham City===
Bruce had taken over at Birmingham some three months previously and was in the process of rebuilding the team with a view to reaching the play-offs. He saw Tébily&#x27;s major attributes as his size, strength and pace; a quality which soon became apparent was his whole-hearted commitment to the cause, as exemplified by his performance in the play-off semifinal against Millwall. Playing in an unaccustomed central midfield position, he man-marked Tim Cahill, later of Everton and Australia, out of the game, and won the ball from Stuart Nethercott with a full-blooded tackle having earlier lost his boot. In that season, Tébily never finished on the losing side at club level, either for Celtic or for Birmingham.
Tébily played regularly in Birmingham&#x27;s first Premier League season until 21 December, when he damaged his medial knee ligaments in the first 20 minutes of the match against Charlton Athletic. In keeping with his &quot;hard-man&quot; image, he finished the game, but the injury proved serious enough to keep him out for the rest of the season.
Returning fit at the start of the 2003–04 Premier League season, Tébily found himself no longer first choice, though his versatility made him the manager&#x27;s preferred defensive substitute. For the next couple of years, he was used irregularly. Coach Mark Bowen cited a lack of confidence, and a long-standing problem with concentration, as leading to inconsistency of performance; though the player&#x27;s own determination to combat the problem led him to encourage the coaching staff to keep shouting at him during the game to maintain his concentration levels. In addition, he underwent laser eye surgery to deal with the problems caused by wearing contact lenses for football. He sometimes struggled badly against quick, tricky players, but always gave of his best when given an opportunity.

In September 2005, he signed a new three-year contract, reflecting his value to the squad despite not having been a first-choice player at any time since his injury in 2002. Restored to the starting lineup as a replacement for Mario Melchiot, his determination and enthusiasm, typified in a man-of-the-match performance against Chelsea, did much to lift the team and supporters during their ultimately unsuccessful fight against relegation. He began the 2006–07 season in the starting eleven, but Radhi Jaïdi, Bruno Ngotty, Martin Taylor and Stephen Kelly were all preferred, and Tébily made his final first-team appearance for Birmingham in October 2006. His contract, which was due to expire at the end of the season, was paid up on 14 January 2008, and he became a free agent after nearly six years at the club.

===Toronto FC===
After a period spent training with them, Tébily signed for Major League Soccer team Toronto FC on 24 April 2008. Head coach John Carver believed his team would be improved by the player&#x27;s versatility, as shown by his ability to play both in the centre of defence and on the right. He played four matches for the club, but an ankle injury disrupted his career, and he was released on 31 July 2008, because he wanted to be closer to his family in France.

==International career==
According to RSSSF, Tébily represented the France national under-21 football team (&quot;Les Espoirs&quot;) at the 1997 Mediterranean Games, being sent off in a 3–0 defeat by Greece. However &quot;Le Télégramme&quot; reported that Tébily had been withdrawn from the squad on the eve of the tournament, to be replaced by Stéphane Pichot of Laval.

==Personal life==
After retirement, Tébily decided to spend this second life to realize his long time dream to become the first African wine grower and to produce his own cognac &quot;Source deux vie&quot; as a tribute to his country.

<doc id="1325265" wikidata="Q370150" url="?curid=1325265" title="Headbutt">
<text>A headbutt or butt is a targeted strike with the head, typically involving the use of robust parts of the headbutter&#x27;s cranium as the area of impact. The most effective headbutts strike the most sensitive areas of an opponent, such as the nose, using the stronger bones in the forehead (frontal bone) or the back of the skull (occipital or parietal bone). The word is both a noun and a verb.

== Mechanics ==
Headbutts can be used from close range such as from the clinch, or on the ground. They are typically applied to the head of the opponent, since the head is often a readily available target and has several sensitive areas, but can be delivered to any part of the body. It is considered a quick, very effective but risky maneuver, as a misplaced strike can also cause injury to the person delivering the headbutt. 

An effective headbutt can be performed with a forward, rising, sideways or backwards motion; each being effective from different positions. Parts of the cranium with thick bone and high local curvature make for good weapon areas, and these include the forehead near the hairline, the outboard curved part of the parietal bone, and the occiput. Ideal targets are usually the fragile areas of the head, including the bridge of the nose, the cheekbones, the hinge area of the jaw, the temple, and the top edge of the eye socket. 

Hitting the opponent&#x27;s teeth or mouth is likely to cause mutual damage. The chin of the enemy is also a generally bad position to headbutt unless striking from below up into the bottom of the chin, similar to an uppercut. In the United Kingdom, a headbutt is sometimes referred to as a &quot;Glasgow kiss&quot;, a tongue-in-cheek reference to the city of Glasgow&#x27;s violent reputation.

== In fiction ==
The character Yosser Hughes in &quot;Boys from the Blackstuff&quot; was noted for headbutting people and inanimate objects. In one scene, his young daughter headbutts a social worker. Headbutts often feature in professional wrestling and fighting video games.

In &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot;, Evelyn O&#x27;Connell headbutts some opponents, which she learned from her husband Rick O&#x27;Connell.

== In nature ==

Rams are well known for butting with their heads and horns. From this, the terms battering ram and hydraulic ram are derived. Goats are also well-known for butting. Many males in various animal species employ butting during courtship to show off their strength to potential mates.

Cats engage in a gentle behavior that resembles headbutting, where they &quot;bunt&quot; a person or another animal with their forehead scent glands to mark their territory with pheromones.

== In sports ==
=== Contact sports ===
Headbutts are generally forbidden in most contact sports and, if performed, result in penalties and even disqualifications. However, it is a strike allowed in Burmese boxing, capoeira, muay boran, combat sambo, some full-contact karate rulesets/variants - namely Kūdō - and in the self-defence art of krav maga. In traditional boxing, official game style regulations are used if the headbutt is accidental. If a match does not reach halfway, it is no contest. If it reaches past the official match point, then scores will be calculated.

It is also the primary focus of the Eritrean martial art Testa. Headbutts were a commonly used technique in vale tudo and mixed martial arts before the introduction of the unified rules of MMA. Similarly, although the art itself forbids any kind of strikes, some masters of judo taught the use of headbutts under the name of &quot;atama ate waza&quot;, as demonstrated by Kyuzo Mifune and Mikinosuke Kawaishi.

===Association football===
Intentional headbutting is irregular in association football and even attempting one will warrant dismissal by a red card. Famously, during the 2006 FIFA World Cup Final between Italy and France, French team captain Zinedine Zidane headbutted Italian player Marco Materazzi, after an angry exchange. Zidane received a red card, and Italy won the match on penalties. It was his last professional game, and ended his career on a &quot;discordant&quot; note. This moment was later immortalized by a sculpture titled &quot;Headbutt&quot; by French artist Adel Abdessemed.

In February 2011, Gennaro Gattuso was suspended for four matches after confronting and headbutting Tottenham Hotspur assistant coach Joe Jordan at the conclusion of a UEFA Champions League match.

In 2016, Roy O&#x27;Donovan was handed an eight match ban, one of the longest bans in A-League Men history, after he headbutted Phoenix defender Manny Muscat.

In August 2022, Liverpool player Darwin Núñez received a red card for headbutting Crystal Palace player Joachim Andersen after several rough tackles between each other during the match.

===Ice hockey===
Headbutting is not allowed in ice hockey. In the National Hockey League even an unsuccessful attempt at headbutting warrants a double minor. An actual headbutt is a major penalty and a game misconduct, and a match penalty is mandatory if the referee rules that there was reckless endangerment.

===Handball===
On March 3, 2014, Milena Knežević headbutted Anita Görbicz during the last seconds of the game between ŽRK Budućnost and Győri ETO KC in the EHF Women&#x27;s Champions League group stage. Knežević was banned for the next two matches.

===Wrestling===
On April 9, 2017, Japanese wrestler Katsuyori Shibata headbutted Kazuchika Okada during their match at Sakura Genesis 2017. The headbutt was so hard that it caused Shibata to start bleeding from the forehead. After the match, Shibata collapsed backstage, from where he was taken to the hospital and diagnosed with a subdural hematoma.

Scottish wrestler Drew McIntyre uses a headbutt as part of his moveset that is called the Glasgow Kiss.

<text>The Blue Devils or the 410 (F) Squadron Aerobatic Team was a Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) aerobatic team that flew the de Havilland Vampire jet aircraft from 1949 to 1951. The unit was the RCAF&#x27;s first postwar aerobatic team, and belonged to the RCAF&#x27;s first operational jet fighter squadron, No. 410 Squadron.

==History==
The Blue Devils started as a team of three by World War II flying ace Flight Lieutenant Don C. Laubman. Later, a fourth member was added to provide a solo performance. The team gained official recognition from the Air Defence Group shortly after its first show at RCAF Station Rockcliffe on 11 June 1949.

Thereafter, the Blue Devils expanded to six aircraft, including a second solo, and went on to fly at airshows around Canada and the United States. Despite a training accident on 25 July 1949 in which Squadron Leader Robert Kipp was killed near St. Hubert, the team went on to become the de facto official RCAF aerobatic team. The team&#x27;s official name became the &quot;Air Defence Group Aerobatic Team&quot; in 1950.

==Disbandment==
The Blue Devils were disbanded in September 1950 as its members were posted to different squadrons and the Vampire was retired in favour of the F-86 Sabre. The team was temporarily reformed on 8 August 1951, however, because of an air show commitment. The last air show was flown on 19 August 1951 at the Michigan Air Fair in Detroit. During its three years of existence, the Blue Devils performed at 45 air shows in Canada and the United States.

<text>John Michael Bishop (born February 22, 1936) is an American immunologist and microbiologist who shared the 1989 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Harold E. Varmus. He serves as an active faculty member at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), where he also served as chancellor from 1998 to 2009.

== Education and early life ==
Bishop was born in York, Pennsylvania. He attended Gettysburg College as an undergraduate, where he was a brother of the Theta-Pi Zeta chapter of Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity. He later attended Harvard University Medical School, where he earned an MD in 1962.

==Career==
Bishop began his career working for the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, a part of the National Institutes of Health. He then spent a year working for the Heinrich Pette Institute in Hamburg, Germany before joining the faculty of the University of California, San Francisco in 1968. Bishop has remained on the school&#x27;s faculty since 1968, and was chancellor of the university from 1998 to 2009. He is director of the Bishop Lab.

He became the eighth chancellor of UCSF in 1998. He oversaw one of UCSF&#x27;s major transition and growth periods, including the expanding Mission Bay development and philanthropic support recruitment. During his tenure, he unveiled the first comprehensive, campus-wide, strategic plan to promote diversity and foster a supportive work environment. During this time, UCSF also adopted a new mission: &quot;advancing health worldwide&quot;™.

==Research==
Much of this work was conducted jointly with Harold Varmus in a notably long scientific partnership. Their best-known accomplishment was the identification of a cellular gene (c-src) that gave rise to the v-src oncogene of Rous Sarcoma Virus, a cancer-causing virus first isolated from a chicken sarcoma by Peyton Rous in 1910. Their discovery triggered the identification of many other cellular proto-oncogenes—progenitors of viral oncogenes and targets for mutations that drive human cancers.

==Awards and honors==
Bishop is best known for his Nobel-winning work on retroviral oncogenes. Working with Harold E. Varmus in the 1980s, he discovered the first human oncogene, c-Src. Their findings allowed the understanding of how malignant tumors are formed from changes to the normal genes of a cell. These changes can be produced by viruses, by radiation, or by exposure to some chemicals.

Bishop is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society.

Bishop is also a recipient of National Medal of Science in 2003. That same year, his book &quot;How to win the Nobel Prize: An Unexpected Life in Science&quot; was published. He was elected Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 2008.
In 2020, Bishop received from the UC Berkeley Academic Senate the Clark Kerr Award for distinguished leadership in higher education.

<text>The wild goat (Capra aegagrus) is a wild goat species, inhabiting forests, shrublands and rocky areas ranging from Turkey and the Caucasus in the west to Turkmenistan, Afghanistan and Pakistan in the east. It has been listed as near threatened on the IUCN Red List and is threatened by destruction and degradation of habitat.

It is thought to be the ancestor of the domestic goat (&quot;C. hircus&quot;).

&quot;Capra aegagrus&quot; was the first scientific name proposed by Johann Christian Polycarp Erxleben in 1777 for the wild goat populations of the Caucasus and Taurus Mountains. &quot;Capra blythi&quot; (proposed by Allan Octavian Hume in 1874) was given to wild goat horns found from Sindh.

The following wild goat subspecies are considered valid taxa:
*Bezoar ibex &quot;C. a. aegagrus&quot;
*Sindh ibex &quot;C. a. blythi&quot;
*Chiltan ibex &quot;C. a. chialtanensis&quot;
*Turkmen wild goat &quot;C. a. turcmenica&quot;

The Cretan goat (formerly &quot;C. a. pictus&quot;), or &quot;kri-kri&quot;, was once thought to be a subspecies of wild goat, but is now considered to be a feral descendant of the domestic goat (&quot;Capra hircus&quot;), now known as &quot;Capra hircus cretica&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==

In Turkey, the wild goat occurs in the Aegean, Mediterranean, Black Sea, Southeastern and the Eastern Anatolia Regions up to in the Taurus and Anti-Taurus Mountains.

In the Caucasus, it inhabits montane forests in the river basins of Andi Koysu and its tributaries in Dagestan, Chechnya and Georgia up to .

In Armenia, wild goats were recorded in the Zangezur Mountains, in Khosrov State Reserve, and in highlands of the Syunik Province during field surveys from 2006 to 2007.
In Azerbaijan, wild goats occur in Ordubad National Park, Daralayaz and Murovdag mountain areas in Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic.
In Iran&#x27;s Haftad Gholleh Protected Area, wild goat herds live foremost in west-facing areas with rocky substrates, water sources and steep slopes that are far from roads.
In Turkmenistan, wild goat populations inhabit the mountain ranges of Uly Balkan and Kopet Dag.
In Pakistan, wild goat herds occur in Kirthar National Park.

==Behaviour and ecology==
In Kirthar National Park, 283 wild goat groups were observed for 10 months in 1986. The group sizes ranged from two to 131 individuals but varied seasonally, with a mean ratio of two females per male.

In Dagestan, male wild goats start courting females in mid December. The rutting season lasts until the third week of January. Females give birth to between one and three kids in late June to mid July.

Older males drive younger males from the maternal herds. The gestation period averages 170 days. Kids are mobile almost immediately after birth. Kids are weaned after 6 months. Female goats reach sexual maturity at 1½–2½ years, males at 3½–4 years. The lifespan of a goat can be from 12 to 22 years.

== Threats ==
Wild goat populations are threatened foremost by poaching, habitat loss due to logging, and competition with domestic livestock for food resources.

<doc id="1325300" wikidata="Q7568961" url="?curid=1325300" title="South Woodford">
<text>South Woodford is an area of East London, England, within the London Borough of Redbridge. It adjoins Woodford Green to the north, Walthamstow to the west, Snaresbrook and Wanstead to the south and Redbridge to the east, and is north-east of Charing Cross. Epping Forest runs adjacent to South Woodford in the west of the area.

==History==
Historically part of the ancient parish of Woodford St Mary, in the Becontree hundred of Essex, the area was largely rural before developing rapidly in the 19th century. It became part of the Metropolitan Police District in 1840 and has been part of the London postal district since its inception in 1856, the same year that South Woodford station, now on the Central line of the London Underground, opened. South Woodford formed part of Woodford Urban District from 1894 to 1934, then part of the Wanstead and Woodford until 1965, when Greater London was created.

This area was until 2004 home to the student residences of Queen Mary, University of London, but the distinctive tower blocks were demolished in 2007 and replaced with lower-rise privately owned apartments, as well as some council housing, known as Queen Mary&#x27;s Gate.

==Amenities==
South Woodford&#x27;s retail and business area is centred on George Lane, the location of South Woodford tube station and Woodford Green High Road. There are several leading chain stores, such as Sainsbury&#x27;s, Marks &amp; Spencer, Waitrose and Boots and a number of smaller shops, bars, restaurants and cafes. British bakery Gails recently opened on George Lane.

There is a seven screen Odeon cinema, which opened in 1934 as a Majestic and is the only cinema in the area. Next door, The George pub, an 18th-century building on the site of an earlier inn, was originally a stopping point for stagecoaches, with several bars. The George once had a fine dining area on the first floor and then later a pizzeria in the basement, with a large spiral staircase between the floors. Other local amenities include a number of green areas, many of which form part of Epping Forest.

There are numerous churches and chapels representing various Christian denominations, several synagogues and a mosque.

The Redbridge Drama Centre, situated next to Churchfields Junior School, provides workshops for young children aged 5 and above and adults up until 65, drama education to local schools and culture to the surrounding area. It has an in-house theatre company named Vital Stages. There are shows at least once a week from touring companies.

South Woodford lies within the London Borough of Redbridge, covering the wards of Churchfields and South Woodford. Each ward has a team of Neighbourhood Police, each managed by one sergeant.

==Transport==
===Road===
South Woodford sits at the junction of the North Circular Road with the start of the M11 motorway, which begins at Charlie Brown&#x27;s Roundabout and is accessible from the Waterworks Corner roundabout. Charlie Brown&#x27;s Roundabout was enlarged in 1972 to accommodate the flyover and sliproads onto the newly constructed motorway.

South Woodford also offers easy access to the A1400, which merges into the A12, as well as access to the A12 from the Green Man roundabout and the A104 which is known as Lea Bridge Road and is a major link to areas of central London via Hackney.

===Train===
George Lane itself is split into two by the Central line rail track with the western part of the road containing the majority of shops and businesses. There was originally a level crossing at this point, but now a flyover (locally referred to as &quot;the Viaduct&quot;) carries traffic between the east and west sides of George Lane.

The area is served by South Woodford tube station in Travelcard Zone 4 on the Central line of the London Underground.

===Bus===

South Woodford is served by London Buses routes 20, 123, 179, SL2, W12, W13, W14 and N55.

==Education==

South Woodford has a good selection of schools including Nightingale Primary, Snaresbrook Primary, Churchfields and Oakdale which are both split into infants and juniors. There is also Snaresbrook Preparatory and Woodbridge Secondary School.

Forest School is an independent school, in close proximity to South Woodford, in that the playing fields are arguably in South Woodford.

<doc id="1325302" wikidata="Q930654" url="?curid=1325302" title="Radar detector">
<text>A radar detector is an electronic device used by motorists to detect if their speed is being monitored by police or law enforcement using a radar gun. Most radar detectors are used so the driver can reduce the car&#x27;s speed before being ticketed for speeding. In general sense, only emitting technologies, like doppler RADAR, or LIDAR can be detected. Visual speed estimating techniques, like ANPR or VASCAR can not be detected in daytime, but technically vulnerable to detection at night, when IR spotlight is used. There are no reports that piezo sensors can be detected. LIDAR devices require an optical-band sensor, although many modern detectors include LIDAR sensors. Most of today&#x27;s radar detectors detect signals across a variety of wavelength bands: usually X, K, and Ka. In Europe the Ku band is common as well. The past success of radar detectors was based on the fact that radio-wave beams can not be narrow-enough, so the detector usually senses stray and scattered radiation, giving the driver time to slow down. Based on a focused laser-beam, LIDAR technology does not suffer this shortcoming; however it requires precise aiming. Modern police radars incorporate formidable computing power, producing a minimum number of ultra-short pulses, reusing wide beams for multi-target measurement, which renders most detectors useless. But, mobile Internet allows GPS navigation devices to map police radar locations in real-time. These devices are also often called &quot;radar detectors&quot;, while not necessary carrying an RF sensor.

==Description==
One device law enforcement use to measure the expected speed of a moving vehicle is Doppler radar, which uses the Doppler effect to measure the relative speed of a vehicle. Doppler radar works by beaming a radio wave at a vehicle to then measure the expected change in frequency of the reflected wave (that bounces off the vehicle). Law enforcement often employs Doppler radar via hand-held radar guns, from vehicles, or from fixed objects such as traffic signals.

Radar detectors use a superheterodyne receiver to detect these electromagnetic emissions from the gun, and raise an alarm to notify the motorist when a transmission is detected. False alarms can occur however due to the large number of devices, such as automatic door openers (such as the ones at supermarkets and drug stores), speed signs, blind spot monitoring systems, poorly designed radar detectors and adaptive cruise control, that operate in the same part of the electromagnetic spectrum as radar guns.

In recent years, some radar detectors have added GPS technology. This allows users to manually store the locations where police frequently monitor traffic, with the detector sounding an alarm when approaching that location in the future (this is accomplished by pushing a button and does not require coordinates to be entered). These detectors also allow users to manually store the coordinates of sites of frequent false alarms, which the GPS enabled detector will then ignore. The detector can also be programmed to mute alerts when traveling below a preset speed, limiting unnecessary alerts. Some GPS enabled detectors can download the GPS coordinates of speed monitoring cameras and red-light cameras from the Internet, alerting the driver that they are approaching the camera.

==Counter technology==
Radar guns and detectors have evolved alternately over time to counter each other&#x27;s technology in a form of civilian electronic &quot;warfare&quot;. For example, as new frequencies have been introduced, radar detectors have initially been &quot;blind&quot; to them until their technology, too, has been updated. Similarly, the length of time and strength of the transmissions have been lowered to reduce the chance of detection, which in turn has resulted in more sensitive receivers and more sophisticated software counter technology. Lastly, radar detectors may combine other technologies, such as GPS-based technology with a point of interest database of known speed trapping locations, into a single device to improve their chances of success.

===Radar detector detectors===
The superheterodyne receiver in radar detectors has a local oscillator that radiates slightly, so it is possible to build a radar-detector detector, which detects such emissions (usually the frequency of the radar type being detected, plus about 10 MHz). The VG-2 Interceptor was the first device developed for this purpose, but has since been eclipsed by the Spectre III and Spectre Elite. This form of &quot;electronic warfare&quot; cuts both ways - since detector-detectors use a similar superheterodyne receiver, many early &quot;stealth&quot; radar detectors were equipped with a radar-detector-detector-detector circuit, which shuts down the main radar receiver when the detector-detector&#x27;s signal is sensed, thus preventing detection by such equipment. This technique borrows from ELINT surveillance countermeasures. In the early 1990s, BEL-Tronics, Inc. of Ontario, Canada (where radar detector use is prohibited in most provinces) found that the local oscillator frequency of the detector could be altered to be out of the range of the VG-2 Interceptor (probably by using two local oscillator stages such that neither is near the RF frequency). This resulted in detector manufacturers responding by changing their local oscillator frequency. The VG-2 is no longer in production and radar detectors immune to the Spectre Elite are available.

===Radar scrambling===

It is illegal in many countries to sell or possess any products that actively transmit radar signals intended to jam radar equipment. In the United States, actively transmitting on a frequency licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) without a licence is a violation of FCC regulations, which may be punishable by fines up to $10,000 and/or up to one year imprisonment.

==LIDAR detection==

Newer speed detection devices use pulsed laser light, commonly referred to as LIDAR, rather than radio waves. Radar detectors, which detect radio transmissions, are unable to detect the infrared light emitted by LIDAR guns, so a different type of device called a LIDAR detector is required. However, LIDAR detection is not nearly as effective as radar detection because the output beam is very focused. While radar&#x27;s radio waves can expand to across at from their source, LIDAR&#x27;s light beam diffuses to only about . A police officer targeting a car will most likely aim for the center mass or headlight of the vehicle and, because radar detectors are mounted on the windshield away from the beam&#x27;s aim, they may not alert at all. With such a focused beam, an officer using a LIDAR gun can target a single car in close proximity to others at ranges of up to . This has resulted in some manufacturers producing LIDAR jammers. Unlike those of radar, LIDAR&#x27;s frequencies and use are not controlled by the FCC. These jammers attempt to confuse police LIDAR into showing no speed on the display. They are often successful, and therefore many LIDAR manufacturers produce LIDAR guns that have &quot;jam codes&quot; that show when they are being jammed. They will work against some LIDAR jammers, but not all. In spite of this, police can often tell when they are being jammed when they see no reading on their LIDAR gun. Many jammer-equipped motorists try to counter this by reducing their speed to legal limits before turning off their jammer equipment, a technique known as &quot;kill the equipment&quot;, referred to as &quot;JTK&quot; or &quot;Jam to Kill.&quot; Officers can often detect this by observing that their LIDAR equipment is unable to lock in a speed properly, along with visual indication of sudden deceleration of the targeted vehicle. They will then pull the offending vehicle over and look for LIDAR jammers on the front of the vehicle, potentially ticketing the motorist with an obstruction of justice charge. Some states also have laws against jamming of police radar or LIDAR: California, Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Virginia. In these states, the penalties can be severe.

Despite the advent of LIDAR speed detection, radar remains more prevalent because of its lower price and the amount of radar equipment already in service. In addition, proper use of LIDAR equipment requires the officer to remain stationary in order to beam a very precise signal.

==Legality==

Using or possessing a radar detector or jammer is illegal in certain countries, and it may result in fines, seizure of the device, or both. These prohibitions generally are introduced under the premise that a driver who uses a radar detector will pose a greater risk of accident than a driver who does not.
The table below provides information about laws regarding radar detectors in particular nations. In 1967 devices to warn drivers of radar speed traps were being manufactured in the United Kingdom; they were deemed illegal under the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1949.

<text>Something Wicked This Way Comes is a 1962 dark fantasy novel by Ray Bradbury, and the second book in his &quot;Green Town Trilogy&quot;. It is about two 13-year-old best friends, Jim Nightshade and William Halloway, and their nightmarish experience with a traveling carnival that comes to their Midwestern home, Green Town, Illinois, on October 24. In dealing with the creepy figures of this carnival, the boys learn how to combat fear. The carnival&#x27;s leader is the mysterious &quot;Mr. Dark&quot;, who seemingly wields the power to grant the townspeople&#x27;s secret desires. In reality, Dark is a malevolent being who, like the carnival, lives off the life force of those it enslaves. Mr. Dark&#x27;s presence is countered by that of Will&#x27;s father, Charles Halloway, the janitor of the town library, who harbors his own secret fear of growing older because he feels he is too old to be Will&#x27;s dad.

The novel combines elements of fantasy and horror, analyzing the conflicting natures of good and evil that exist within all individuals. Unlike many of Bradbury&#x27;s other novel-length works, such as &quot;Dandelion Wine&quot; and &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot;, which are fix-ups, &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot; is a single, full-length narrative.

The title is taken from &quot;By the pricking of my thumbs, something wicked this way comes&quot;, a line said by the witches in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot;.

==Background==
One of the events in Ray Bradbury&#x27;s childhood that inspired him to become a writer was an encounter with a carnival leader named Mr. Electrico who commanded him to &quot;Live forever!&quot; The 12-year-old Bradbury, intrigued at the concept of eternal life, revisited Mr. Electrico, who spurred his passion for life by heralding him as the reincarnation of a friend lost in World War I. After that memorable day, Bradbury began writing nonstop.

The novel originated in 1955 when Bradbury suggested to his friend Gene Kelly that they collaborate on a movie for Kelly to direct. Kelly was encouraging of the idea, and Bradbury spent the next five weeks adapting his 1948 short story &quot;The Black Ferris&quot; into an 80-page treatment. Kelly shopped the project to various studios, but was unable to obtain financial backing for the film. Bradbury then gradually expanded the treatment into the novel over a five-year period. He converted the benign presence of Mr. Electrico into a more sinister one and incorporated several members he met at the same carnival with Mr. Electrico, including the Illustrated Man and the Skeleton Man.

The book&#x27;s autumnal setting was intended as a thematic sequel to Bradbury&#x27;s summer-tinged&quot; Dandelion Wine&quot;. Both works are set in the fictitious Green Town (based on Bradbury&#x27;s hometown, Waukegan, Illinois) but have different tones, with the seasons in which they are set reflecting different aspects of the transition from childhood to adulthood. While none of the characters in &quot;Dandelion Wine&quot; reappear in &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot;, Will Halloway and Jim Nightshade can be viewed as one-year older representations of &quot;Dandelion Wine&quot;&#x27;s Douglas Spaulding and John Huff, respectively. These two novels, coupled with Bradbury&#x27;s official 2006 sequel to &quot;Dandelion Wine&quot;, &quot;Farewell Summer&quot;, constitute what Bradbury has termed his &quot;Green Town Trilogy&quot;. The 2008 short story collection &quot;Summer Morning, Summer Night&quot; is also set almost entirely in Green Town.

Bradbury had previously published his books through either Ballantine Books or Doubleday, but switched to Simon &amp; Schuster for the publication of &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes.&quot; According to Simon &amp; Schuster editor Robert Gottlieb, Bradbury had grown frustrated with Doubleday&#x27;s lack of energy behind his newer ideas. 

==Plot summary==
The novel opens on an overcast October 23. Two friends – William &quot;Will&quot; Halloway and Jim Nightshade – both on the verge of their 14th birthdays, encounter a strange lightning rod salesman, Tom Fury. He announces that a storm is coming their way. The salesman gives Jim a lightning rod because he tells the boys that one of their houses is in danger. Throughout the night, Will and Jim meet up with townsfolk who also sense something in the air. Among the townspeople is Will&#x27;s 54-year-old father, Charles Halloway, who works in the local library. Both Mr. Halloway and the boys learn about the carnival that is to start the next day. Jim and Will are excited that a carnival has come so late in the year, but Charles has a bad feeling about it.

The boys run out to watch the carnival arrive at three in the morning. As the train pulls in, the smoke billows in circles and solidifies as the carnival. The boys go the next day to explore the carnival and encounter their 7th grade teacher, Miss Foley, who is dazed after visiting the Mirror Maze. Jim insists on coming back that night and Will agrees, but when they bump into the lightning-rod salesman&#x27;s abandoned bag, they realize that they must stay to learn what happens after dark. After investigating all of the rides, they go up to a carousel, which has an out-of-order sign. Mr. Cooger suddenly grabs Will and Jim after they climb up on horses and he informs them the merry-go-round is broken. Mr. Dark arrives and tells him to put them down. He pays attention only to Jim, who is enthralled by what he sees. The boys run away and then hide and wait. Both witness Mr. Cooger riding backwards on the carousel (as the music plays backwards), and when he steps off, to their shock, he is 12 years old.
They follow young Mr. Cooger to Miss Foley&#x27;s house, where he pretends to be the nephew she was expecting. Jim tries to talk with him, because he wants to ride the carousel, but Will stops him. Jim takes off in the direction of the carnival. When Will catches up, Mr. Cooger is riding the carousel growing older, and Jim is about to join him. Will knocks the switch on the carousel and it flies out of control, spinning rapidly forward. Mr. Cooger ages over 100 years before it stops, and Jim and Will take off. They return with the police, but Mr. Cooger is nowhere to be found. Inside the tents they find him all set up as a new act, &quot;Mr. Electrico&quot;, a man they run electricity through. Mr. Dark tells the boys to come back to the carnival the next day. Will tries to keep his father out of the situation, promising him that he will tell all soon. That night, the Dust Witch floats by in her balloon to find Jim and Will. She marks Jim&#x27;s roof with shiny slime, which the boys then remove with a hose. Will lures her to an abandoned house and destroys her balloon with a bow and arrow. They later both dream of a bizarre funeral for the balloon, featuring a giant, misshapen coffin.
The next day the boys find a girl crying under a tree and realize she is the former Miss Foley made young again but also totally blind. They leave the girl where she is, checking Miss Foley&#x27;s house to confirm the theory, but when they return for her, they&#x27;re cut off by a parade. The carnival is out searching the streets for the two boys and has now taken young Miss Foley with them. The boys hide, and Will&#x27;s father spots them hiding under a storm drain in front of the cigar store. The boys convince him to keep quiet. Mr. Dark later arrives to talk to him. Mr. Halloway pretends not to know the two boys, whose faces are tattooed on the man&#x27;s hand, but when the Witch comes and begins to sense the boys&#x27; presence, he blows cigar smoke at her, choking her and forcing her to leave. Mr. Dark then asks Charles Halloway for his name, and Will&#x27;s father tells him he is the town library&#x27;s janitor. That night Will and Jim meet him at the library where he has done research into his own father&#x27;s ministerial notes. The carnival arrives once a generation, and leaves in the midst of a giant storm. Mr. Dark appears, and the boys hide in the book stacks. He discovers both of them and crushes the janitor&#x27;s hand when Mr. Halloway attempts to fight him. The tarot witch casts spells on the boys to mesmerize them and also tries to stop Mr. Halloway&#x27;s heart. Just before he is about to die, Charles looks at the Witch and begins to laugh hysterically. His laughter wounds her deeply and drives her away. He then follows Mr. Dark to the carnival to rescue the boys.
At the carnival, Charles triumphs over Mr. Dark, finds his son in the mirror maze, kills the Witch with a smile on a bullet, and destroys all the mirrors by using laughter and cheer. Then he and Will search for Jim. Mr. Cooger turns to dust and blows away before he can be saved by the carousel. Jim runs to the merry-go-round and rides it forward. Will tries to stop him and grabs onto his leg. They both end up going for a ride before Will jumps off and rips Jim away from the machine. Jim falls into a stupor, close to death. A child comes begging them to help him, but Mr. Halloway recognizes the boy as Mr. Dark. He holds the boy tight and kills him with affection, because Mr. Dark cannot survive in such close contact with someone so happy. The carnival falls apart as Will tries to revive Jim. They save Jim by singing and dancing and laughing, their happiness bringing him back from the edge of death.

==Characters==
;William &quot;Will&quot; Halloway
:Born one minute before midnight on October 30, Will is described as having done &quot;only six years of staring&quot;. He is described as having white-blonde hair with eyes &quot;as clear as summer rain&quot;. Will is naturally obedient and wary of getting involved in difficult situations; nonetheless, he takes on an active role in fighting the carnival&#x27;s evil power.
;James &quot;Jim&quot; Nightshade
:Born one minute after midnight on October 31, Jim is brooding and brash, acting as a foil for Will&#x27;s cautiousness and practicality. He is described as having wild and tangled chestnut brown hair and eyes the color of &quot;green-glass fire&quot;. Jim yearns to become older, which makes him vulnerable to the carnival&#x27;s temptations, but he is ultimately saved by his friendship with Will.
;Charles Halloway
:A middle-aged man who starts out in the novel as quiet and unhappy. He&#x27;s not very close to his son, but eventually gains self-awareness and faith while up against the carnival (defeating the &quot;Dust Witch&quot; and &quot;Jed/Mr. Dark&quot;). He becomes a fighter in his own right by the end of the novel, along with gaining the admiration, love, and friendship of his son.
;G. M. Dark
:The main antagonist, he is a sinister man who bears tattoos all over his body, one for each person successfully tempted into joining the carnival. Mr. Dark initially holds sway over the other main characters, but his power weakens when Charles uses positive emotions against him, something he cannot comprehend or withstand. Dark&#x27;s background is a mystery, although when asked if he reads the Bible, he replies, &quot;I&#x27;ve had every page, line and word read at me, sir!&quot; This could refer to a possible Christian upbringing, or his victims quoting. 
;J. C. Cooger
:Dark&#x27;s partner in running the carnival, Mr. Cooger, is a fierce, red-headed man who is first seen repairing the carousel. He catches and terrifies Will and Jim until Mr. Dark intervenes. In the guise of her twelve-year-old nephew, he is able to persuade Miss Foley to come to the carnival. The tables are turned on him, however, when Will increases the speed of the carousel as Mr. Cooger is riding it, causing him to rapidly age to the point of decrepitude. At the climax of the book, he crumbles into dust and dies when the freaks accidentally drop him while carrying him back to the carousel. Like Mr. Dark, his origins are unknown.
;The Dust Witch
:A blind soothsayer possessing a sixth sense and the ability to perform many feats of magic, the Witch is portrayed as one of the carnival&#x27;s most dangerous members. However, her increased sensitivity to the presence and emotions of other people makes her vulnerable to positive feelings. Charles uses this weakness to kill her with a bullet carved with a smile. Her origins are unknown, but she is illustrated on Mr. Dark&#x27;s wrist as a &quot;black-nun blind woman&quot;. 
;Miss Foley
:A fifty-year-old schoolteacher of Will and Jim. Much like the other victims of the carnival, Miss Foley wished to become young. Her wish is granted, although she is transformed into a little girl with all her memories intact, unable to return to her former life and with no one to take care of her. It is not stated in the novel what happened to Miss Foley at the end.
;The Skeleton
:An extremely thin, skeleton-like creature who is one of the more frequently appearing freaks. Like all of the other freaks, he once desired to be younger and was eventually tricked into joining the carnival. The Skeleton appears to be one of the more loyal freaks as, near the book&#x27;s end, he takes the time to carry the recently deceased and young Mr. Dark with him after all the other freaks ran away. He is last seen walking away into the hills that border the town.
;Tom Fury/Dwarf
:A lightning rod salesman who, succumbing to his desire to see the Most Beautiful Woman in the World, is turned into an insane dwarf by the carnival and is recruited into it, with no memories of his former life.

==Themes==
As in &quot;Dandelion Wine&quot;, Bradbury infuses the novel with nostalgia for his childhood. However, &quot;Dandelion Wine&quot; embodies the idyllic memories of youth, whereas &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot; superimposes folk-tale and supernatural elements over a small-town Americana setting in order to explore the dark undercurrents that surround the transition to adulthood.

The novel also conveys the theme that the power that people, objects, and ideas have over to some individual depends on the power the individual instills in them with own mind. Because of this, the carnival is able to easily take advantage of the common human fears of aging, death, and loneliness which everyone has or relates to.

Self-centered desires and wishes are portrayed as the base of human malice and unhappiness because they blind people to the blessings of life with an unattainable dream. The novel&#x27;s main example of this is Miss Foley&#x27;s seduction by Cooger&#x27;s promise of youth that causes her to fail to see his deception as her &quot;nephew&quot; and lose her rightful place in society.

It is implied that the counter-force against this is acceptance of one&#x27;s faults and an enthusiastic pursuit of the everyday joys of life, signified by Charles&#x27;s spontaneous running with Jim and Will at the end of the novel. The fact that he is nearly forty years older than them pales in comparison to the pleasure he gains from simple human companionship.

==Reception==
Critics have praised &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot; as a classic of fantasy and horror, noting its masterful blending of both genres and Bradbury&#x27;s unusual and mesmerizing prose. The most referenced characteristic of the novel&#x27;s plot is its unusual subtlety and realism for its genres.

The magazine &quot;Science Fiction Weekly&quot; published a review of the novel; an excerpt of it follows:
&quot;Science Fiction Crowsnest&quot;, another science fiction magazine, reviewed it with high praise, referring to it as a &quot;Masterwork&quot; with &quot;a suitably fantastic and scary plot around colourful description ... with hidden meanings, mysteries and symbols adding to the layers of tension&quot;.

The &quot;Denver Rocky Mountain News&quot; said in 1999: &quot;If rational beings had created the 100 best books of the century list, this one would surely have been on it.&quot;

==Legacy and literary influence==
&quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot; has served as a direct influence on several fantasy and horror authors, including Neil Gaiman and Stephen King. Gaiman paid tribute to Bradbury&#x27;s influence on him and many of his peers in a 2012 &quot;The Guardian&quot; article following Bradbury&#x27;s death. King discusses this novel at length in his 1981 non-fiction book &quot;Danse Macabre&quot; and also in his 2022 fantasy book &quot;Fairy Tale&quot;.

The book influenced R. L. Stine, who said: &quot;Ray Bradbury is one of my favorite authors. I always tell people that the scariest book I ever read was one of his books—&quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot;&quot;. Clive Barker also placed the book fourth on his list of greatest books about good and evil, number one being &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;.

==Reference in other works==
The novel is referenced in the 2024 song &quot;I Can Never Say Goodbye&quot; by The Cure.

==Adaptations==
The novel was adapted for a low-budget 1972 British film, produced by the Forest Hill Film Unit &amp; Drama Troupe and directed by Colin Finbow.

The novel was made into the 1983 The Bryna Company-Walt Disney Productions film &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot;, with Bradbury as the screenwriter. The production had been in development since the mid-1970s and was originally meant to be financed and distributed by Paramount Pictures. In a later interview, Bradbury said that he considered the film one of the better adaptations of his works.

Bradbury&#x27;s Pandemonium Theatre Company performed a play based on the novel in Los Angeles on October 1, 2003, directed by Alan Neal Hubbs, also associated with the 1970 stage adaptation of Bradbury&#x27;s 1950 book &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot;. The main cast was Grady Hutt as Will Halloway, J. Skylar Testa as Jim Nightshade, Jay Gerber as Charles Halloway, and Mark Aaron as Mr. Dark. Critics gave the play generally favorable reviews, stating that it captured the lyricism and dark tone of the novel. They also praised its special effects, which included a carousel constructed of mirrors with actors as the horses, and Jay Gerber as Charles Halloway. Sharon Perlmutter of &quot;Talkin&#x27; Broadway&quot;, however, said that Hutt and Testa gave bland performances as the two lead characters.

&quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot; was produced as a full-cast radio play by the Colonial Radio Theatre on the Air, and released by Blackstone Audio on October 1, 2007. Ray Bradbury wrote the script, modified for audio from his stage play. The cast includes Jerry Robbins as Mr. Halloway, J.T. Turner as Mr. Dark, Anastas Varinos as Will Halloway, and Matthew Scott Robertson as Jim Nightshade. This production was directed by Nancy Curran Willis, with music by Jeffrey Gage and post-production by Chris Snyder.

Catherine Wheels adapted &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot; for the stage in coproduction with the National Theatre of Scotland in 2008. The production opened at the Byre Theatre, St Andrews on October 27, 2009, and toured the UK.

&quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot; was produced as a radio play for the BBC Radio 4 &quot;Saturday Play&quot; series and was broadcast on 29 October 2011. The production was adapted for radio by Diana Griffiths and produced/directed by Pauline Harris with music by David Paul Jones and sound by Paul Cargill. The cast included Theo Gregory as Will, Josef Lindsay as Jim, Henry Goodman as Charles Halloway, Gerard McDermott as Mr. Cooger/The Lightning Rod Salesman and Kenneth Cranham as Mr. Dark.

A musical adaptation of &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot; with Book by Brian Hill and music and lyrics by Neil Bartram was produced at the Delaware Theatre Company in 2017 and earned 11 Barrymore Award nominations.

<text>Lim Bo Seng (; 27 April 1909 – 29 June 1944) was a Chinese resistance fighter based in Singapore and Malaya during World War II. Prior to the outbreak of World War II, he was a prominent businessman among the overseas Chinese community in Singapore and Malaya. Following the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, he participated in fund-raising activities to assist the war effort in China and boycott Japanese goods. After Singapore fell to the Japanese in 1942, Lim went to India, where he joined Force 136, a Sino-British guerrilla task force backed by the Special Operations Executive, to carry out espionage, sabotage and reconnaissance operations in Japanese-occupied Malaya. In 1944, he was captured by Japanese forces in Malaya and ultimately died in prison due to torture and ill-treatment. After the war, his remains were transported back to Singapore and buried near MacRitchie Reservoir. He is remembered as a war hero in contemporary Singapore and the Lim Bo Seng Memorial at Esplanade Park was constructed in 1954 to commemorate him.

== Family background and early life ==
Lim was born in Houpu Village, Meilin Town, Nan&#x27;an County, Fujian Province (now Manshanhong Village, Shengxin Town, Nan&#x27;an, Fujian) towards the end of the Qing dynasty in China. His father, Lim Loh (; 1852–1929), owned businesses in various industries, including construction, rubber, brick manufacturing and biscuit production, as well as properties in China and Southeast Asia. Lim Loh had six wives and a total of 19 sons and nine daughters; his first ten sons and first two daughters were adopted by his first four wives, while his fifth wife bore him seven sons and six daughters, and his sixth wife bore him two sons and a daughter. Lim Bo Seng was born to Lim Loh&#x27;s fifth wife Png Bor Tan (; 1885–1930) and he was Lim Loh&#x27;s 11th son but the first biological son in the family.

Lim initially attended an English school (now part of the Fujian Xiamen No. 2 Middle School) in Gulangyu, Xiamen before he moved to Singapore at the age of 16 and studied at Raffles Institution. After graduating, he went on to pursue a degree in business at the University of Hong Kong.

== As a businessman ==
After his father died in 1929, Lim inherited the family businesses and continued running them with his brothers. He was also very active in the overseas Chinese business community in Singapore and Malaya, and had held key positions such as Chairman of the Singapore Building Industry Association, Board Member of the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and Executive Member and Education Director of the Singapore Hokkien Association.

== Anti-Japanese activism ==
On the Double Tenth Day in 1938, Tan Kah Kee and other Chinese business leaders in Singapore established a committee to raise funds to help Chinese refugees affected by the Second Sino-Japanese War. Lim served as the committee&#x27;s communications director and actively participated in anti-Japanese activities such as boycotting Japanese goods and fund-raising to support the war effort in China.

Towards the end of 1937, hundreds of overseas Chinese working in Japanese-owned industries in Malaya went on strike. At the time, the Japanese government owned an iron mine in Bukit Besi near Dungun, Terengganu, where about 3,000 workers were employed. The iron ore was shipped to Japan and used as raw material to manufacture weapons. Lim believed that if the workers in the Dungun mine went on strike, the Japanese would suffer a huge loss, so he planned to make the workers go on strike. Around February 1938, Lim travelled to Dungun with Chuang Hui Chuan () of the Anxi clan association to carry out their plan. Chuang went to the mine to persuade the workers to go on strike while Lim contacted the local police and gained their support. By early March, Lim and Chuang achieved success as many workers left the mine and followed them to Singapore. On 11 March 1938, Lim and the Singaporean Chinese community held a welcoming ceremony for the workers, who later resettled and found employment in Singapore.

In December 1941, Lim responded to the British colonial government&#x27;s call to mobilise Chinese volunteers to join Dalforce (part of the Straits Settlements Volunteer Force) and assist the British in resisting the invading Japanese forces. The volunteers put up a fierce fight against the Japanese during the Battle of Singapore in February 1942.

== Life in Force 136 ==
On 11 February 1942, Lim left Singapore for Sumatra and later travelled by sea to Calcutta, India before taking a flight to Chongqing, where the Chinese government was based during the war. The Chinese government sent him to India to assist the British military forces in logistical operations such as firefighting, medical support and supply transportation. Later, as part of the Allied cooperation between China and Britain, Lim was designated as the Chinese liaison of Force 136, a Sino-British guerrilla task force, and appointed as Force 136&#x27;s Malaya operations officer with the rank of colonel. Force 136 agents were trained by the British at Sinhagad, Poona, India.

=== Operation Gustavus ===
Operation Gustavus was aimed at establishing an espionage network in Malaya and Singapore to gather intelligence on Japanese activities, and thereby aid the British in Operation Zipper – the code name for their plan to take back Singapore from the Japanese.

On 24 May 1943, the first group of Force 136 agents, codenamed &quot;Gustavus I&quot; and led by Captain John Davis of the Special Operations Executive, departed the British naval base in Ceylon on board the Dutch submarine &quot;O 24&quot; and arrived in Perak, Malaya. The &quot;O 24&quot; would rendezvous with &quot;Gustavus I&quot; again in September and November 1943 to transfer supplies and personnel from &quot;Gustavus IV&quot; and &quot;Gustavus V&quot; respectively. Its sister ship, the &quot;O 23&quot; under Captain Richard Broome, transported &quot;Gustavus II&quot; and &quot;Gustavus III&quot; to Malaya on 25 June and 4 August 1943 respectively. Lim arrived in Perak on 2 November 1943 as part of &quot;Gustavus V&quot;. He travelled under the alias &quot;Tan Choon Lim&quot; () to avoid identification and claimed to be a businessman when he passed through checkpoints.

In Perak, Davis and Lim re-established contact with Major Freddie Chapman, who was part of a British unit that stayed behind after the Malayan Campaign and had been carrying out small-scale attacks against the Japanese in Malaya. They also met guerrilla fighters of the Malayan People&#x27;s Anti-Japanese Army (MPAJA), including the Malayan communists Chin Peng and Lai Teck. They reached an agreement that the resistance group would be placed under British command in exchange for weapons, supplies and training. Force 136&#x27;s head office and command centre was established on a hill in Bidor. One of the Chinese provision shops in Ipoh, Jian Yik Jan (), was used as an Allied espionage base. Communication between the agents was done through smuggling messages in empty toothpaste tubes, salted fish and diaries.

Operation Gustavus failed before the agents managed to achieve any results. A communist guerrilla who was captured by the Japanese in January 1944 revealed the existence of the Allied spy network operating on Pangkor Island. In response, the Japanese launched a full-scale counter-espionage operation on the island and by late March 1944, more than 200 Japanese soldiers were on the island. On 24 March, the Kempeitai arrested a fisherman, Chua Koon Eng (), at Teluk Murrek on the Perak coast. Chua was working on Pangkor Island when Li Han-kwong () of Force 136 approached him and requested to use his boat for their communications. Chua confessed and implicated Li in the spy ring. The Japanese laid a trap for Li and, using Chua as bait, captured him shortly after. Under torture, Li confirmed Chua&#x27;s story but managed to avoid revealing more than what the Japanese already knew. The Japanese took Li to Ipoh for further interrogation, but Li managed to escape on 26 March 1944 into the jungle, after which the Japanese started searching for Li and other Force 136 members. The entire spy network was destroyed by 31 March 1944 and was not reestablished until February 1945.

== Capture and death ==
Lim was captured by the Kempeitai under Major Ōnishi Satoru () at a roadblock in Gopeng, Perak around March or April 1944, and taken to the Kempeitai headquarters for interrogation. He refused to provide the Japanese with any information about Force 136 despite being subjected to torture, and protested against the ill treatment of his comrades in prison. He fell ill with dysentery and was bedridden by the end of May 1944. Lim died in the early hours of 29 June 1944 at the age of 35, and was buried behind the Batu Gajah prison compound in an unmarked spot. After the Japanese surrender, Gan Choo Neo was informed of her husband&#x27;s death by the priest of St. Andrew&#x27;s School. She went to Batu Gajah with her eldest son to bring her husband&#x27;s remains home.

Lim&#x27;s remains arrived at the Tanjong Pagar railway station in Singapore on 7 December 1945. Upon arrival, the hearse was sent off by a large procession of British officers and prominent businessmen from the station to Hock Ann Biscuit Factory in Upper Serangoon Road via Armenian Street. On the same day, a memorial service for Lim was held at the Tong Teh Library of the Kuomintang Association in Singapore.

A funeral service was held on 13 January 1946 at City Hall. Lim&#x27;s remains was transported in a coffin to a hill in MacRitchie Reservoir (coordinates: 1°20&#x27;31.76&quot;N 103°49&#x27;50.60&quot;E) for burial with full military honours. Lim was posthumously awarded the rank of &quot;shaojiang&quot; (major-general) by the Nationalist government of the Republic of China.

The Lim Bo Seng Memorial was unveiled at the Esplanade on 29 June 1954, the 10th anniversary of his death. There are also places named after Lim, such as Bo Seng Avenue in Thomson, Singapore, and Jalan Lim Bo Seng in Ipoh, Malaysia.

== Personal life ==
In 1930, Lim married Gan Choo Neo (), a Nyonya woman from the Lim clan association in Singapore, and converted to Christianity after their marriage. They had four sons and four daughters; one of their daughters died around the age of two. Gan died of cancer on 25 September 1979 at the age of 71.

Lim&#x27;s eldest son, Lim Leong Geok (; 1932–2004), was an executive director of the SMRT Corporation and a key figure in the development of the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) and Singapore&#x27;s public transport system. He was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Contribution award by the Land Transport Authority on 31 March 2010.

One of Lim&#x27;s grandsons, Lim Teck Yin, is a former brigadier general in the Singapore Armed Forces and chief executive officer of Sport Singapore.

== In popular culture ==
In 1998, Asiapac Books published a comic book () based on Lim&#x27;s life. It was written by Clara Show and illustrated by Chu Yi Min.

In 1997, Singapore&#x27;s Chinese-language television channel, TCS Channel 8, aired a television series, &quot;The Price of Peace&quot;, about the Japanese occupation of Singapore. Singaporean actor Rayson Tan portrayed Lim as a semi-fictional protagonist in the drama. In 1999, the English-language channel TCS Channel Five aired an English-dubbed version of &quot;The Price of Peace&quot;.

<doc id="1325327" wikidata="Q467100" url="?curid=1325327" title="Pierre Gemayel">
<text>Pierre Amine Gemayel, also spelled Jmayyel, Jemayyel or al-Jumayyil (; 6 November 1905 – 29 August 1984), was a Lebanese political leader. A Maronite Catholic, he is remembered as the founder of the Kataeb Party (also known as the Phalangist Party), as a parliamentary powerbroker, and as the father of Bachir Gemayel and Amine Gemayel, both of whom were elected to the presidency of the republic in his lifetime.

He opposed the French Mandate over Lebanon in the late 1930s and early 1940s, and advocated an independent state, free from foreign control. He was known for his deft political maneuvering, which led him to take positions which were seen by supporters as pragmatic, but by opponents as contradictory, or even hypocritical. Although publicly sympathetic to the Palestinian cause, he later changed his position due to Palestinian support of the Lebanese National Movement and its calls to end the National Pact and establish non-sectarian democracy.

Gemayel also had a career in football in the 1930s, captaining the Lebanon national team as a player. He also became the first Lebanese football referee to officiate matches internationally, and was the second president of the Lebanese Football Association, between 1935 and 1939.

==Early life and education==
Pierre Gemayel was born on 6 November 1905 in Bikfaya, Lebanon into a Maronite family. His father Amine Bachir Gemayel, known as Abou Ali, and his uncle were forced to flee to Egypt after being sentenced to death in 1914 for opposing Ottoman rule, returning to Lebanon only at the end of World War I.

Gemayel was educated at Jesuit school. He went on to study pharmacy at the French faculty of medicine in Beirut, where he later opened a pharmacy. He owned a pharmacy in Haifa, British Mandatory Palestine. The pharmacy was located in Sahat Al Hanatir (Carriage Square).

=== In association football ===

Gemayel also took an interest in sport, playing football. In 1935 he became president of the Lebanese Football Association (LFA); the same year he became Lebanon&#x27;s first referee to officiate internationally. As captain of the Lebanon national team, Gemayel attended the 1936 Olympic games in Berlin, alongside Hussein Sejaan, the former LFA president. After the games, he also visited various Central European countries. Gemayel remained president of the LFA until 1939.

==Foundation of Kataeb Party==
On his return to Lebanon from Europe, in 1936 Gemayel founded Al Kataeb Al Loubnaniyyah party (Kataeb Party) with Georges Naqqache, Charles Helou, Chafic Nassif and Hamid Franjieh, who was later replaced with Emile Yared, modelling the party after the Spanish and Italian Fascist parties he had observed there. 

At first, the goal of the party was to enhance people&#x27;s patriotism and civic-mindedness, but later on turned into a political resistance to the French authorities in the region. Gemayel was also influenced from the Sokol movement of Czechoslovakia during this visit to the Central Europe after the 1936 Olympic games, and employed the doctrine of this movement while founding the Kataeb party. Kataeb Party is described as a right-wing Christian Party.

The foundation of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party by Antun Saadeh in 1932 was the trigger for the establishment of the Kateb Party, since the former actively tried to influence Lebanon towards the Syrian interests, leading to direct challenge for Lebanese nationalists. The founders of the Kataeb Party were young, French-educated and middle-class professionals who committed to independent and Western-oriented Lebanon. 

Charles Helou, who later served as Lebanon&#x27;s president from 1964 to 1970, was one of the founders. By the time of his presidency, however, Helou was no longer a party member, and Gemayel unsuccessfully opposed him in the presidential election of 1964.

==Career==
In the years before and after Lebanon&#x27;s independence, Gemayel&#x27;s influence and that of the Kataeb Party was limited. It survived a French attempt to forcibly dissolve it in 1937 and took part in an uprising against the French Mandate in 1943, but despite its membership of 35,000, it operated on the fringes of Lebanese politics. 

In the Civil War of 1958, Gemayel emerged as a leader of the right-wing nationalist (mainly Christian) movement that opposed a Nasserist and Arab-nationalist inspired attempt to overthrow the government of president Camille Chamoun and supported the return of foreign troops to Lebanon. In the aftermath of the war, Gemayel was appointed a cabinet minister in a four-member Unity government. Two years later, Gemayel was elected to the National Assembly, from a Beirut constituency, a seat he held for the rest of his life. In 1958, Gemayel was appointed deputy to then prime minister Rashid Karami. 

By the end of the 1960s, the Kataeb Party held 9 seats in the National Assembly, making it one of the largest groupings in Lebanon&#x27;s notoriously fractured and sectarian parliament. Although his bids for the presidency in 1964 and 1970 were unsuccessful, Gemayel continued to hold cabinet posts intermittently throughout the remaining quarter-century of his life. For instance, he was minister of finance from 1960 to 1961 and in 1968, and the minister of public works in 1970. 
Lebanon has long been a battleground in the Israeli-Arab conflict, and Gemayel&#x27;s position was always solid and consistent advocating a Lebanon separated from the other Arab states and linked to France and the West. He opposed the presence of the Palestinian refugees. His supporters viewed this as a sign of strength and patriotism, while his detractors saw it as incoherent. 

Gemayel reluctantly signed the Cairo Agreement of 1969 under enormous pressure from the international community, which allowed Palestinian guerrillas to set up bases on Lebanese soil, from which to carry out actions against Israel. He later defended his actions, saying that Lebanon really had no choice. In the 1970s, he came to oppose the armed Palestinian presence in Lebanon. The Kataeb created a military Security Council led by William Hawi, which came to be commanded by Gemayel&#x27;s son Bachir upon the assassination of Hawi.

Gemayel was also to reverse his position on the Syrian intervention in the Lebanese Civil War of 1975 to 1990. He initially welcomed Syrian intervention on the side of the Christians and against the Lebanese National Movement, but he soon became convinced that Syria was occupying Lebanon for reasons of its own. 

In 1976, he joined other mainly Christian leaders, including former president Camille Chamoun, the diplomat Charles Malik, and the Guardians of the Cedars leader Étienne Saqr, to oppose the Syrians. On 11 October 1978, Gemayel bitterly denounced the Syrian military presence, and the Lebanese Front joined the Lebanese regular army in a successful &quot;Hundred Days War&quot; against the Syrian army.

On 4 June 1979, an attempt was made to assassinate Pierre Gemayel. The previous month, 13 May, Amine Gemayel also escaped an assassination attempt.

==Later years and death==

Gemayel saw his younger son, Bachir Gemayel, elected president of Lebanon on 23 August 1982, only to be assassinated on 14 September, nine days before his scheduled inauguration. Bachir&#x27;s older brother, Amine Gemayel was elected to replace him. Pierre Gemayel himself initially stayed out of Amine Gemayel&#x27;s government, but in early 1984, after participating in two conferences in Geneva and Lausanne, Switzerland, aimed at ending the civil war and the occupation of the country by Israeli troops in 1982, he agreed to serve in a cabinet of national unity that was formed by Rashid Karami in May 1984. He served as the minister of public health and communications in the cabinet led by then prime minister Karami.

Gemayel was still in office when he died of a heart attack in Bikfaya on 29 August 1984. He was at the age of 78. Gemayel&#x27;s body was buried next to Bashir Gemayel&#x27;s grave in Bikfaya on 30 August 1984.

==Personal life==

Gemayel was married to Genevieve Gemayel, and they celebrated the 50th anniversary of their marriage in August 1984. They had six children. His younger son, Bachir Gemayel was assassinated on 14 September 1982 after being elected to the presidency. His grandson Pierre Amine Gemayel, then industry minister, was similarly assassinated on 21 November 2006. Several other descendants of Pierre Gemayel, including two grandchildren, were also murdered during the civil war period.

<text>Jaime Lannister is a fictional character in the &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; series of fantasy novels by American author George R. R. Martin and its television adaptation &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;, where he is portrayed by Danish actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau. Jaime becomes a prominent point of view character in the novels beginning with &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot; (2000).

Introduced in &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; (1996), Jaime is a knight of the Kingsguard and one of the best swordsmen in the seven kingdoms. He is a member of House Lannister, the wealthiest and one of the most powerful families in the kingdom of Westeros. He is the elder son of Tywin Lannister, twin brother of Cersei, with whom he has a longstanding incestuous relationship, and brother of Tyrion. Although Jaime first appears unscrupulous and immoral, he later proves to be more complex, honorable, and sympathetic. His lengthy character development has been praised by critics of the novels and the television show.

Jaime is one of the most popular characters in both series versions. Coster-Waldau received critical praise for his portrayal and several award nominations, including a Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor on Television, a Critics&#x27; Choice Television Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Drama Series, People&#x27;s Choice Awards Favorite TV Anti-Hero, and two Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series nominations. He and the rest of the cast were nominated for five Screen Actors Guild Awards for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series.

==Character description==

In &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; (1996), Jaime is introduced as one of the Kingsguard, the royal security detail, the son of the wealthy and powerful Tywin Lannister (the former Hand of the King), and one of the greatest swordsmen in the Seven Kingdoms with few able to match him, such as Barristan Selmy, Garlan Tyrell, Loras Tyrell. Jaime&#x27;s twin is Cersei, the Queen of Westeros by her marriage to King Robert Baratheon. Jaime is derisively referred to as &quot;the Kingslayer&quot; because he killed the &quot;Mad King&quot; Aerys Targaryen in the coup that put Robert on the Iron Throne.

Eric Dodds of &quot;TIME&quot; described Jaime as &quot;handsome, an incomparably skilled fighter, and disarmingly witty&quot;. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; called the Lannisters &quot;a crowd of high-cheekboned beauties ... who form a family constellation so twisted, charismatic, and cruel that it rivals &quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot; for blond dysfunction&quot;. Lev Grossman wrote for &quot;TIME&quot; that while Jaime and Cersei&#x27;s younger brother Tyrion is a grotesque dwarf, &quot;the rest of the Lannisters are stunted too, but on the inside.&quot; The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called Jaime &quot;handsome and unscrupulous&quot;, though Dodds noted in 2014:

Darren Franich of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; noted that in the novels, &quot;[Jaime is] a vaguely villainous minor character in &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;, then is basically absent from &quot;Clash of Kings&quot;, and suddenly he becomes a tragic hero in &quot;Storm of Swords&quot;.&quot; In &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot;, Jaime is not only carrying on an incestuous affair with his twin sister, but he pushes a young Bran Stark out a high window to his likely death after the boy witnesses them in the act. Jaime admits these crimes to Catelyn Stark in &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot; (1998) and tells her a horrific story of Aerys Targaryen&#x27;s cruelty. In &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot; (2000), Jaime initially loathes the female warrior Brienne of Tarth, but both his honor and his reluctant respect for Brienne compel him to lie to their captors to prevent her from being raped. He later explains to Brienne that he killed Aerys because the king had planned to incinerate all of King&#x27;s Landing and its inhabitants rather than let it fall into Robert&#x27;s hands. When Jaime is released to be sent back to King&#x27;s Landing in deference to his father, he first saves Brienne, who has been thrown into a bear pit for the mercenaries&#x27; amusement. Martin told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 2014:

Specifically addressing Jaime&#x27;s attempted murder of Bran, Martin said:

==Storylines==
===&quot;A Game of Thrones&quot;===

Jaime Lannister accompanies the royal family to Winterfell, where King Robert Baratheon hopes to persuade his old friend Ned Stark to serve as Hand of the King. During the visit, Ned&#x27;s young son Bran inadvertently spies Jaime and Cersei having sex in a remote tower, at which point Jaime pushes the boy out a window, intending to kill Bran to keep their relationship secret. Bran survives, though crippled and with no recollection of the incident. When an assassin later tries to kill Bran, his mother, Catelyn Stark, accuses and arrests Tyrion. In revenge, Jaime instigates a brawl with Ned and his men in the streets of King&#x27;s Landing, killing many on both sides, including Jory Cassel, the Captain of Ned&#x27;s household guards. Ned later discovers that Robert&#x27;s three children are actually the products of Jaime and Cersei&#x27;s affair but is executed by the oldest child, Joffrey Baratheon, upon the latter&#x27;s ascension as king. Jaime then rides for the Riverlands to aid Tywin in his campaign against the Riverlands, taking command of half the Lannister host. He besieges the Riverlands&#x27; capital of Riverrun, but Robb Stark&#x27;s army waylays his army in the Battle of the Whispering Wood. Jaime is taken prisoner and incarcerated in Riverrun. In the meantime, Joffrey has named Jaime as commander of his Kingsguard.

Hillary Busis of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called the twist of Jaime and Cersei in the tower &quot;lurid and shocking, exactly what I needed to jolt me awake and make me start paying closer attention ... By the end of the chapter — &#x27;The things I do for love&#x27; — I was totally hooked on &quot;Thrones&quot;&quot;. Mikal Gilmore of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; noted in 2014 that the moment in which Jaime pushes Bran to his likely death &quot;grabs you by the throat&quot;. Martin commented in the interview:
===&quot;A Clash of Kings&quot;===

Tyrion makes several attempts to free Jaime, first by having disguised Lannister guards attempt to break him out and then by offering to swap Arya Stark and Sansa Stark for Jaime. After hearing of the supposed deaths of Bran and Rickon Stark, Catelyn interrogates Jaime. Jaime admits to pushing Bran out the tower window, to his incest with Cersei and to fathering her children. Jaime then mocks Ned for having tarnished his own honour by fathering a bastard, prompting Catelyn to call her bodyguard Brienne of Tarth for her sword.

===&quot;A Storm of Swords&quot;===

Jaime is freed by Catelyn and sent to King&#x27;s Landing to exchange for Sansa and Arya, escorted by Brienne of Tarth and Jaime&#x27;s cousin Ser Cleos Frey. Cleos is killed by bandits and Jaime and Brienne are captured by the Brave Companions, who were formerly in service to Tywin but have defected to Roose Bolton. Their leader, Vargo Hoat, cuts off Jaime&#x27;s sword hand in the hope that Tywin will blame Roose and prevent the Boltons defecting to the Lannisters. While held captive at Harrenhal, Jaime reveals to Brienne the circumstances surrounding his murder of King Aerys. Roose Bolton releases Jaime but keeps Brienne hostage. While returning to King&#x27;s Landing, Jaime has a dream about Brienne and decides to return to Harrenhal to rescue her from Hoat.

Continuing on to King&#x27;s Landing, Jaime and Brienne learn that Robb and Catelyn have been murdered at the Red Wedding, and that Joffrey has been poisoned, with Tyrion on trial for the murder; Jaime refuses to believe Tyrion is guilty. Tywin gifts Jaime with a Valyrian steel sword forged from House Stark&#x27;s ancestral sword Ice and reveals that he plans to have Jaime released from his vows to the Kingsguard, disowning him when Jaime declines. Jaime passes the sword on to Brienne and tasks her with finding and protecting the fugitive Sansa Stark. He then forces Varys into helping Tyrion escape, confessing to Tyrion that he owed him a debt for his role in Tysha&#x27;s fate. Outraged, Tyrion spitefully reveals to Jaime Cersei&#x27;s affairs during his imprisonment, swears vengeance on Jaime and the rest of House Lannister, and lies that he did indeed kill Joffrey, before killing Tywin.

===&quot;A Feast for Crows&quot;===

Jaime and Cersei&#x27;s relationship breaks down after he repeatedly declines her requests to become the new Hand of the King and he becomes more disturbed by Cersei&#x27;s arrogance and impulsive leadership. Jaime tries to reconcile Kevan and Cersei, in hopes that Kevan will take the role of Hand. Kevan rebuffs Jaime&#x27;s efforts, and implies that he knows of Jaime and Cersei&#x27;s incestuous relationship. Cersei orders Jaime to go to Riverrun and dislodge Ser Brynden &quot;Blackfish&quot; Tully. Before his leaving, Jaime has an armorer forge him a prosthetic hand. He takes the King&#x27;s Justice, Ser Ilyn Payne with him to teach him to fight with his left hand, using the lessons to confess to his numerous crimes. During the march, he encounters his cousin Lancel, who confesses to his affair with Cersei. Jaime persuades Edmure Tully to force the Blackfish&#x27;s surrender by threatening to sack the castle and kill Edmure&#x27;s child when it is born, though Edmure assists the Blackfish in escaping. Jaime later receives a letter from Cersei, who has been imprisoned by the High Sparrow and is awaiting trial and begs Jaime to be her champion in her trial by combat, but Jaime has the letter burned without reply.

===&quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot;===

Jaime travels to Raventree Hall and negotiates Lord Tytos Blackwood&#x27;s surrender, officially ending House Stark&#x27;s insurrection. In the aftermath, he is approached by Brienne, who claims that Sansa is in danger from Sandor &quot;The Hound&quot; Clegane. It is unknown how much of this is true, as Brienne was previously seen as a prisoner of Lady Stoneheart, the reanimated corpse of Catelyn Stark, and the anti-Lannister Brotherhood Without Banners.

===Family tree of House Lannister===
==TV adaptation==

Jaime is portrayed by Danish actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau in the HBO adaptation &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;. His casting was announced on August 20, 2009.

In October 2014, Coster-Waldau and several other key cast members, all contracted for six seasons of the series, renegotiated their deals to include a potential seventh season and salary increases for seasons five, six, and seven. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; called the raises &quot;huge&quot;, noting that the deal would make the performers &quot;among the highest-paid actors on cable TV&quot;. &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot; put the number for season five at &quot;close to $300,000 an episode&quot; for each actor, and &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; wrote in June 2016 that the performers would each be paid &quot;upward of $500,000 per episode&quot; for seasons seven and the potential eight. In 2017, he became one of the highest paid actors on television and earned £2 million per episode for the show.

Matt Fowler of IGN noted in 2013 that &quot;the people who do seem to get redemption arcs on this show are the villains&quot;. Over the course of the first three seasons, the series transitioned Jaime from an obvious villain to an antihero of sorts. Eric Dodds of &quot;Time&quot; wrote that Jaime had become &quot;a complex, bizarrely likable character&quot;. Andrew Romano of &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; explained:

Fowler wrote that Jaime&#x27;s adventure with Brienne was &quot;the best storyline of the season&quot; in Season 3, aside from the Red Wedding.

Jaime&#x27;s apparent rape of Cersei in the fourth season episode &quot;Breaker of Chains&quot; created controversy among fans and journalists, who debated the show&#x27;s depiction of sexual violence against women as well as Jaime&#x27;s character development. The showrunners never commented on what their intention with the scene actually was. The cast members involved initially gave only vague comments, but after the fourth season was released on Blu-ray and the showrunners avoided making any comment about the scene in it (it is conspicuously the only episode which has no commentary track), both Coster-Waldau and Headey publicly stated that the scene was never intended to portray rape at all – they were given no instructions to this effect (such as in the script) nor did they play it that way, and apparently the scene was just edited very confusingly.

In the source novel &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot;, the sex between Jaime and Cersei in the equivalent scene is consensual. Several critics argued that the TV series&#x27; change damaged Jaime&#x27;s redemption arc. Dodds noted that the episode &quot;irreparably changes the way we see Jaime Lannister&quot;. Alyssa Rosenberg of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote:

Coster-Waldau said, &quot;If you look closer there are those moments where she—well, I haven&#x27;t seen the finished edit, of course—but we tried to have it where she goes into it then she pulls away, she goes in then she pulls away, but of course he is forcing himself.&quot; Later he and his co-star Lena Headey (Cersei) spoke with &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; during the filming of season 5, admitting that they were never directed or intended to film a rape scene. Headey stated:

The Jaime-Cersei scene was subsequently ignored for the rest of Season 4 and the rest of the series. Writing on website TheMarySue.com, Rebecca Pahle claimed that not referring to the scene again, instead of as a long and developed subplot, trivialized rape—if, in fact, it was ever the actual intention to portray it as a rape scene. Pahle argued that in real life a woman would be traumatized by being raped, not act as if nothing had happened immediately afterwards. Pahle said that even if the show&#x27;s creators did not intend it as a rape scene, ignoring questions about the scene and hoping they would go away over time was insensitive to the audience.

In 2016, Christopher Hooton wrote for &quot;The Independent&quot;:
===Storylines===
====Season 1====
Jaime&#x27;s storyline in the first season remains, for the most part, identical to his book storyline, with only minor details altered. Introduced in the pilot, &quot;Winter is Coming&quot;, Jaime is established as queen Cersei Lannister&#x27;s brother and a knight of King Robert Baratheon&#x27;s Kingsguard. After being discovered by Brandon Stark to be having an affair with Cersei, Jaime pushes the boy to his presumed death, only for Bran to survive the fall, admittedly with life-changing injuries and little recollection of the event. As the season continues, Cersei expresses her concern to Jaime that Bran will one day remember being pushed and expose their incestuous affair, which has spawned all three of Cersei&#x27;s children. Jaime soon joins his father Tywin Lannister in the field as they face off against Robb Stark&#x27;s army following the imprisonment of Ned Stark in King&#x27;s Landing. At the Battle of Whispering Wood, Robb captures Jaime from the Lannister forces and uses him as a hostage. In the aftermath of Jaime&#x27;s capture, he confesses to Catelyn that he tried to kill Bran, but refuses to reveal why.

====Season 2====
Robb brings a captive Jaime with his camp as they march through the Westerlands, as Robb fears Tywin may coerce one of his bannerman into freeing Jaime. At one point Jaime attempts to escape by beating his cousin and fellow inmate Alton Lannister to death and strangling his guard Torrhen Karstark when he comes to investigate. Jaime is soon recaptured by Robb&#x27;s bannermen, but the anger of Torrhen&#x27;s father Rickard proves fatal for Robb&#x27;s campaign in the coming months. After Jaime goads Catelyn by mentioning Ned&#x27;s rumoured infidelity, she releases him and has Brienne of Tarth escort him to King&#x27;s Landing to trade for her daughters, Sansa and Arya.

====Season 3====
After spending several weeks on the road, Jaime attempts to free himself from Brienne&#x27;s escort and return home to King&#x27;s Landing by himself. During his attempts to do this, however, they are soon captured by a squad of soldiers sporting the banners of House Bolton. As their prisoner, Jaime manages to convince them not to rape Brienne, but their leader Locke takes umbrage when Jaime tries to use his status to secure his own release. He chops off Jaime&#x27;s sword hand. In the days following this incident, Jaime is shown to be weak and delirious, with his wound becoming increasingly infected. The two are taken to Harrenhal, where the former maester Qyburn treats Jaime&#x27;s wound. Jaime reveals to Brienne the truth about why he killed the Mad King Aerys during Robert&#x27;s Rebellion. Roose Bolton lets Jaime return to King&#x27;s Landing but insists on keeping Brienne prisoner for abetting treason, though Jaime ultimately returns to rescue Brienne from being killed by a bear for Locke&#x27;s amusement. The two return to King&#x27;s Landing and Jaime is reunited with Cersei.

====Season 4====
Tywin gifts Jaime a Valyrian steel sword forged from House Stark&#x27;s ancestral sword, Ice, and asks him to resign from the Kingsguard and rule Casterly Rock, disowning him when he refuses. Qyburn fits Jaime with a gilded steel hand, while Tyrion arranges for Jaime to have sword lessons with his bodyguard Bronn. After their son Joffrey is poisoned at his own wedding, Cersei initially refuses to resume their relationship. The two later proceed to having angry sex in front of Joffrey&#x27;s body. Jaime gifts Tywin&#x27;s sword to Brienne, as well as the services of Tyrion&#x27;s squire Podrick Payne. Jaime tasks her to find and protect Sansa Stark. With Tyrion accused of Joffrey&#x27;s murder, Jaime refuses to believe his brother is guilty. Jaime convinces Tywin to spare Tyrion in return for leaving the Kingsguard, though Tyrion later chooses trial by combat. Tyrion loses the trial and is sentenced to death, but Jaime releases him from his cell and helps him escape to Essos.

====Season 5====
Cersei guilts Jaime for releasing Tyrion, and Jaime later admits to Bronn that he intends to kill Tyrion the next time they meet. When a message arrives from Martells subtly threatening Myrcella as revenge for Prince Oberyn Martell&#x27;s death in Tyrion&#x27;s trial by combat, Jaime and Bronn travel to Dorne in secret to retrieve her. As they make their escape they are accosted by Oberyn&#x27;s bastard daughters, the Sand Snakes, and engage in a fight before all five are arrested by the Water Gardens&#x27; palace guards. Doran Martell realises that the message was sent by Oberyn&#x27;s paramour Ellaria Sand and decides to send Myrcella and his own son Trystane back to King&#x27;s Landing with Jaime as a peace offering between the two houses. As the ship sets sail, Myrcella admits to Jaime that she has always known he is her father, and that she feels happy knowing this. The two share a brief embrace before Myrcella suddenly collapses and dies, having been poisoned by Ellaria.

====Season 6====
Jaime returns to King&#x27;s Landing with Myrcella&#x27;s corpse. He orders Trystane to stay on the boat outside the city to protect him from Cersei&#x27;s wrath, and sends word to Doran naming Ellaria as Myrcella&#x27;s killer. After Doran receives this news, Ellaria promptly kills Doran, sends Obara and Nymeria to King&#x27;s Landing to kill Trystane, and seizes control of Dorne. At Myrcella&#x27;s funeral, Jaime confronts the religious leader, the High Sparrow, for having forced Cersei to walk naked through the streets of King&#x27;s Landing as punishment for adultery, but is forced to stand down at the arrival of the Faith Militant. Jaime enlists the Tyrell army to march on the Sept of Baelor to secure the release of Margaery and Loras Tyrell. However, they find that Margaery has seemingly become a follower of the High Sparrow and that Tommen has forged an alliance with the Faith Militant. As punishment for taking up arms against the Faith, Jaime is removed from the Kingsguard. He is sent to Riverrun with Bronn to assist House Frey in reclaiming the castle from Brynden &quot;Blackfish&quot; Tully and the occupying Tully forces. After a failed parlay, Brienne arrives and implores both Jaime and the Blackfish to end the siege without bloodshed, so the Tully rebels can help Sansa Stark retake Winterfell. Brienne fails in this task, therefore Jaime tries to peacefully persuade Edmure into surrendering the castle. Seeing that Edmure refuses to cooperate, he threatens that his son will be sent to him via catapult, which finally makes him agree to his terms of surrender. Edmure is released and promptly opens the gates to the Lannisters, and Jaime manages to resolve the siege without loss of life. Jaime sees Brienne and Podrick fleeing by boat from the castle walls, but only waves a discreet farewell and does not alert his men.

After traveling to House Frey&#x27;s fortress The Twins for a feast to celebrate their victory at Riverrun, Jaime returns to King&#x27;s Landing. Upon arrival, he is horrified to discover that the Great Sept of Baelor has been destroyed in a wildfire explosion, with the majority of House Tyrell and the entire Faith Militant killed in the attack. He returns to the Red Keep in time to witness Cersei being crowned as Queen of the Seven Kingdoms, immediately realizing that Cersei wiped out every high-ranking rival in the explosion in order to acquire her new power.

====Season 7====
Despite his discomfort at the circumstances leading to Cersei&#x27;s coronation, Jaime remains loyal to his sister, with Daenerys Targaryen and her forces sailing on Westeros. Cersei agrees to marry Euron Greyjoy after the war against Daenerys is won, but continues her relationship with Jaime, no longer attempting to hide their intimacy from their servants. Jaime negotiates with Randyll Tarly to pledge allegiance to the Lannisters, and with the help of House Tarly&#x27;s forces he leads the Lannister army to defeat the Tyrell army at Highgarden. The Tyrell family matriarch, Lady Olenna, had defected to Daenerys following Cersei&#x27;s role in the death of the other Tyrells. In the aftermath of the battle, Jaime allows Olenna a painless suicide-via-poison, rather than the torturous death Cersei had ordered. Before dying, Olenna reveals she was responsible for poisoning Joffrey.

As the Lannister forces return to King&#x27;s Landing via road, they are ambushed by Daenerys&#x27; Dothraki forces. Their army is nearly completely destroyed in the attack, until Bronn temporarily wounds Drogon with a scorpion ballista. Jaime attempts a desperate, horseback lance charge on the dismounted Daenerys, but only escapes being burnt to death when Bronn intervenes. The two men plunge into the Blackwater Rush, and are carried downstream, away from the carnage of Daenerys&#x27; victory. They return to King&#x27;s Landing, where Jaime warns Cersei of certain defeat should Daenerys escalate the conflict. Cersei is not entirely convinced of that or Olenna&#x27;s confession.

Bronn takes Jaime to the Red Keep cellars under the pretense of more training. However, Tyrion (now Hand to Daenerys after his journey in Essos) is there for a parley. Tyrion wants a truce between the two queens in order to form an alliance against the White Walkers, as well as a meeting between Daenerys and Cersei to present evidence of the danger. Jaime is convinced by Tyrion and relays the message to Cersei, who is skeptical, but remains adamant that the Lannisters will prevail against any foe. She also reveals that she is pregnant with Jaime&#x27;s child.

At the meeting in King&#x27;s Landing, Jon Snow and the Hound present an undead wight to Cersei&#x27;s court, and Jaime realizes the impending doom. After some persuasion from Tyrion, Cersei relents to sending the Lannister forces north against the Army of the Dead. However, Cersei reveals to Jaime that she had no intention of sending the Lannister army north to assist in the fight. Instead, she has ordered Euron Greyjoy to travel to Essos and retrieve the Golden Company, an army of sellswords, and wait for the Northern forces to be weakened (or eliminated). Upon learning this, Jaime decides to head North alone, and leaves King&#x27;s Landing as winter arrives.

====Season 8====
Jaime arrives in Winterfell and encounters Bran, who has been waiting for him in the courtyard. He is visibly shocked to see the Stark boy again. Brought before Daenerys and the Northern lords, Jaime justifies his actions against the Starks and Targaryens as being in service to House Lannister. Brienne vouches for Jaime, citing his protection of her from Roose Bolton&#x27;s soldiers, and Sansa and Jon Snow let him live. Afterwards, Jaime speaks to Bran alone in the Godswood and apologizes for trying to kill him; however, Bran holds no anger towards Jaime for his deeds. Jaime also speaks with Brienne and declares that he wishes to fight under her command in the upcoming battle against the White Walkers. Later, drinking with Brienne and others before battle, Jaime knights Brienne. Jaime fights the Army of the Dead in the Battle of Winterfell alongside Brienne and the others; both survive as the living win. After the battle, Jaime shares an intimate moment with Brienne.

After learning that Daenerys&#x27; army are planning to seize King&#x27;s Landing and execute Cersei, Jaime ignores Brienne&#x27;s pleas and leaves for King&#x27;s Landing to aid his sister. Daenerys&#x27; forces capture him on the road, but Tyrion frees him so that he can surrender on Cersei&#x27;s behalf and take her away from King&#x27;s Landing and Westeros. Jaime enters King&#x27;s Landing during the battle between Daenerys&#x27; and Cersei&#x27;s forces. As the city falls, Euron attacks and grievously wounds Jaime, but Jaime manages to kill him. Jaime reunites with Cersei in the Red Keep. The pair are then killed when the dungeon vaults of the castle collapse over them during the sacking of the city. In the series finale, titled &quot;The Iron Throne&quot;, Tyrion discovers Jaime and Cersei&#x27;s crushed bodies buried under the rubble in the crypt under the Red Keep and, in his grief, renounces his loyalty to Daenerys and persuades Jon Snow to kill her. Later on, Brienne records Jaime&#x27;s accomplishments and writes that he &quot;died protecting his queen.&quot;

===Reception and recognition===
Matt Roush wrote for &quot;TV Guide&quot; that Coster-Waldau plays &quot;dastardly&quot; Jaime &quot;with malevolent charisma&quot;, and Dodds noted that, despite the &quot;despicable things&quot; he has done, &quot;the Kingslayer remains one of &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;″ most popular characters&quot;. Matthew Gilbert of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; wrote:
Coster-Waldau received several nominations for his portrayal of Jaime, including the Critics&#x27; Choice Television Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Drama Series in 2013, the Satellite Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Series, Miniseries or Television Film in 2013, the People&#x27;s Choice Award for Favorite TV Anti-Hero in 2014, the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor on Television in 2014, the Zulu Award for Best Actor in 2017, and two Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series nominations.

<doc id="1325369" wikidata="Q11703515" url="?curid=1325369" title="Samwell Tarly">
<text>Samwell Tarly, or simply Sam, is a fictional character in the &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; series of fantasy novels by American author George R. R. Martin, and its television adaptation &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;, where the character is portrayed by English actor John Bradley.

Introduced in &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; (1996), Samwell is the elder son of Lord Randyll Tarly of Horn Hill and his wife Lady Melessa Florent. A self-professed coward with a love for books and songs, Samwell was forced by his father to abandon his birthright and join the Night&#x27;s Watch so that his younger brother could become heir to Horn Hill. While at the Wall, he meets Jon Snow and quickly becomes his closest friend and ally. Samwell subsequently appeared in the second book &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot; (1998) before becoming a point-of-view character in the third book &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot; (2000) and the fourth book &quot;A Feast for Crows&quot; (2005).

== Character ==
=== Description ===
Samwell Tarly is the elder son and firstborn child of Lord Randyll Tarly of Horn Hill and his wife Lady Melessa Florent, and has four siblings — younger sister Talla, two other unnamed sisters, and a younger brother Dickon. Through his mother, Samwell is also second cousin to Shireen Baratheon and Edric Storm, who were born to Melessa&#x27;s first cousins Selyse and Delena. He has dark hair, pale eyes and a large moon-shaped face, and is very obese. Jon Snow originally comments that Sam is the fattest boy he has ever seen, and estimates him to weigh .

A gentle young man, Samwell is fond of music and songs, and prefers books over weapons, and is afraid of blood and violence, which earned his father&#x27;s intense contempt. After being frustrated at Samwell for years, Randyll&#x27;s attentions turned to grooming his more promising younger son Dickon, who showed all of the physical vigor that Samwell lacked, and decided to have Dickon inherit the Tarly title. On Samwell&#x27;s fifteenth birthday, Randyll forces him to join the Night&#x27;s Watch and renounce his birthright of heir to Horn Hill, threatening death if he was to refuse. After arriving at Castle Black, Samwell was bullied for being overweight and unskilled in combat, and was often called &quot;Ser Piggy&quot; and &quot;Lord of Ham&quot;. However, his new-found friendship with a sympathetic Jon Snow allows his character to start unfolding positively, and earns him the position as the personal steward of Maester Aemon. While lacking his friends&#x27; fighting abilities and having self-professed cowardice, Samwell is highly intelligent, observant, resourceful and loyal, and eventually becomes Jon Snow&#x27;s most trusted sidekick. In the fourth book, Sam is sent by Jon to the Citadel at Oldtown and becomes accepted as a novice trainee supervised by Archmaester Marvyn and acolyte Alleras.
According to George R. R. Martin, the character Samwell Tarly is the most relatable to him. When asked why, Martin said in a 2014 interview: because Sam&#x27;s &quot;the fat kid who likes to read books and doesn&#x27;t like to go up a lot of stairs.&quot; Just like Tarly, George R. R. Martin both “had troubled relationships with their fathers and neither is a fighter at heart” (Barnes). George R. R. Martin refused to go to the Vietnam War, because he “believed it was stupid — a sentiment that is reflected throughout the entire Song of Ice and Fire oeuvre.” (Cian) If given the option, Samwell Tarly would choose not to fight, just like Martin.

== Storylines ==
===In the books===
Samwell Tarly is a background character in the first two novels of the series, and his actions and thoughts are interpreted through the eyes of Jon Snow. He then becomes a point of view character in the third novel &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot; and the fourth novel &quot;A Feast for Crows&quot;, with total of ten chapters told from his point of view.

====&quot;A Game of Thrones&quot;====
Upon arriving at the Wall, Sam is soon bullied by Ser Alliser Thorne and the fellow recruits for his weight, shyness and clumsiness in training. Jon Snow takes pity on Sam and defends him in arms training. Later on, Sam confesses his life story to Jon, who sympathizes with Sam and secretly uses his influence among the recruits (making violent threats when necessary) to protect Sam from harm. When Sam fails to progress in fight training and is not deemed worthy to join the Night&#x27;s Watch, Jon persuades Maester Aemon take in Sam as a personal steward assigned to help Aemon in the rookery and library.

Sam is the first person to notice something strange about the corpse of rangers Othor and Jafer Flowers (who are actually wights 
sent to assassinate Lord Commander Jeor Mormont). When Jon tries to abandon the Night&#x27;s Watch to join Robb Stark&#x27;s army and avenge the death of his father Eddard Stark, Sam alerts their fellow recruits, who catch up to Jon and convince him to not break his vows to the Night&#x27;s Watch.

====&quot;A Clash of Kings&quot;====
Sam takes part in the Great Ranging beyond the Wall, to take care of the ravens as Lord Commander Jeor Mormont&#x27;s aide. While stopping at Craster&#x27;s Keep, Sam befriends one of Craster&#x27;s daughter-wives, Gilly. Gilly is pregnant and fears that, if her child is a boy, Craster will sacrifice him to the Others. Sam is horrified, but unable to help. Later, at camp at the Fist of the First Men, Sam and Jon&#x27;s direwolf Ghost discover a cache of dragonglass daggers buried underground.

====&quot;A Storm of Swords&quot;====
The Night&#x27;s Watch&#x27;s camp at the Fist of the First Men comes under attack and is overrun by an army of wights sent by the Others, with Sam one of the survivors who manage to break out. The survivors then flee to Craster&#x27;s Keep, but Sam and two other brothers, Small Paul and Grenn, become separated from the main group. They are attacked by an Other who kills Paul before Sam stabs it with a dragonglass dagger in desperation, killing it instantly and earning him the nickname &quot;Sam the Slayer&quot;. Sam and Grenn then regroup with the other survivors at Craster&#x27;s Keep, where Gilly gives birth to a son. Soon after, a violent mutiny breaks out, and Mormont and Craster are among those killed in the fight. Sam flees with Gilly and her son, and are accosted by wights before being rescued by a mysterious man, Coldhands, who looks like a wight but is friendly and supposedly a former fellow Night&#x27;s Watchman. Coldhands takes them to the Nightfort and asks Sam to escort Bran Stark and his party through the Wall.

Having crossed the Wall safely, Sam and Gilly then encounter a group of Night&#x27;s Watchmen led by Denys Mallister and Bowen Marsh and join them on the march to Castle Black. They arrive to find that Stannis Baratheon has arrived to the Night&#x27;s Watch&#x27;s aid and defeated Mance Rayder&#x27;s Wildling army besieging Castle Black. Due to Lord Commander Mormont&#x27;s death, the Night&#x27;s Watch undergoes an election for a new Lord Commander. Mallister and Cotter Pyke are the leading candidates, but Janos Slynt, who Sam believes will be a corrupt and disastrous leader, is gaining popularity. When Stannis, frustrated by the Night&#x27;s Watch&#x27;s messy politics, threatens to dictate a Lord Commander himself if the Watch cannot decide on a leader within the next few days, Sam decides to approach Mallister and Pyke (who despise each other) independently, claiming that Stannis plans to name the other as Lord Commander, and suggesting that they both support Jon as a compromise candidate instead. Thanks to Sam&#x27;s machinations, both Mallister and Pyke offer their endorsements and Jon is elected the 998th Lord Commander with an overwhelming majority vote.

====&quot;A Feast for Crows&quot;====
Jon sends Sam to Oldtown to be trained as a Maester, accompanied by another brother Dareon (who is appointed as a recruiter), Maester Aemon (who Jon fears will be sacrificed by Melisandre for his royal blood) and Gilly and her baby. During the voyage to Braavos, Gilly grows despondent, and Sam realises that Jon had swapped Gilly&#x27;s baby with Mance Rayder&#x27;s newborn son lest he be sacrificed as well. Aemon falls ill during the voyage and they are forced to spend their money on a healer and lodging in Braavos. In Braavos, Sam also encounters a disguised Arya Stark, though he does not realise her identity. Aemon hears of his great-grandniece Daenerys Targaryen and her dragons, and comes to believe that she fulfills the prophecy of a &quot;prince that was promised&quot;, asking them to inform the Citadel. Dareon decides to desert, and Sam fights him before being thrown into a canal. He is rescued by a Summer Islander, Xhondo, who offers Sam and Gilly passage to Oldtown aboard his merchant ship. Aemon ultimately passes away in the journey, and Sam and Gilly briefly become lovers in their grief.

Sam plans to have Gilly sent to Horn Hill under his mother&#x27;s care, with the baby passed off as Sam&#x27;s bastard. Meanwhile, Sam arrives at Oldtown to meet with Archmaester Marwyn, telling him of Aemon&#x27;s request. Marwyn resolves to travel to Slaver&#x27;s Bay to meet with Daenerys, ordering Sam to keep his story secret from the other maesters, and entrusting Sam&#x27;s care in the hand of acolyte Alleras.

===In the show===
====Season 1====
Sam is quickly identified as being soft and weak by Castle Black&#x27;s master-at-arms Ser Alliser Thorne, and suffers in sword-training until Jon Snow convinces the other new recruits to go easy on him. Sam is assigned to the order of stewards, to serve Maester Aemon. When Jon tries to abandon the Night&#x27;s Watch after hearing of his father&#x27;s execution, Sam follows with Pyp and Grenn. They convince Jon to remain loyal to the Night&#x27;s Watch.

====Season 2====
Sam joins the Night&#x27;s Watch in the Great Ranging. Along the journey, the party rests at Craster&#x27;s Keep, where Sam encounters and falls in love with Craster&#x27;s pregnant daughter-wife Gilly. While camping at the Fist of the First Men, Sam discovers a cache of weapons made from dragonglass. While Sam is out collecting dung for fires, the White Walkers march on the Fist of the First Men. Sam is unable to outrun the army of the dead, but for unknown reasons their leader spares Sam.

====Season 3====
Sam and the survivors of the resulting massacre flee back to Craster&#x27;s Keep. Sam witnesses Gilly give birth to a baby boy, whose gender Sam and Gilly realize they must keep secret to prevent Craster from giving the baby to the White Walkers. A brawl later breaks out among Craster and the Night&#x27;s Watch, and Sam flees with Gilly and the baby. They are followed by a White Walker who tries to take the baby, but Sam kills it by stabbing it with a dragonglass dagger. Sam and Gilly pass through the Wall at the Nightfort, where they discover Jon&#x27;s half-brother Bran Stark and his party, headed beyond the Wall. Sam is unable to persuade them to come to Castle Black instead but promises not to tell Jon their destination.

Arriving back at Castle Black, Sam warns Aemon of the advancing White Walkers, and Aemon has Sam send the warning throughout the Seven Kingdoms. Later, Jon returns to Castle Black, gravely wounded and disguised as a Wildling. Sam recognises Jon and orders him to be attended to.

====Season 4====
Sam reveals to Jon that Bran is alive and headed beyond the Wall. Sam decides to send Gilly to Mole&#x27;s Town to work as a maid in the brothel, as he fears for her safety at Castle Black. Mole&#x27;s Town is attacked by the Wildlings, who slaughter the entire populace of the town. Sam is distraught, unaware that Gilly and her baby had been spared by Ygritte. Gilly later makes it to Castle Black moments before the Wildlings attack. Sam participates in the battle and manages to kill the Thenn warg.

====Season 5====
When the Night&#x27;s Watch convenes to choose their new Lord Commander, Sam speaks up to nominate Jon, who is ultimately elected. Sam spends his time researching the White Walkers&#x27; weaknesses and tending to the dying Maester Aemon, and he comforts Aemon in his final moments as he dies of old age. Later, Sam is beaten while defending Gilly from two Night&#x27;s Watchmen who attempt to rape her, but he and Gilly are saved by Jon&#x27;s direwolf Ghost. Gilly tends to Sam&#x27;s wounds, and the couple finally consummates their relationship. After Jon returns from Hardhome, Sam entreats him to send him to the Citadel in Oldtown in order to train as a Maester, while also taking Gilly and her baby to safety.

====Season 6====
As women are banned from the Citadel, Sam intends to leave Gilly and Little Sam at the Tarly seat, Horn Hill, although he warns Gilly to hide her Wildling heritage due to his father&#x27;s bigotry towards the Wildlings. At dinner with Sam&#x27;s family, Randyll insults Sam&#x27;s lack of fighting prowess. Gilly defends Sam by revealing that he killed a White Walker while traveling south toward the Wall, in doing so accidentally revealing that she is a Wildling. Although disgusted, Randyll acquiesces to Sam and Lady Tarly&#x27;s request to let Gilly and Little Sam stay at Horn Hill, but he says Gilly will be a servant, and he forbids Sam from ever returning to Horn Hill. Sam decides to take Gilly and Little Sam with him to the Citadel, and he steals House Tarly&#x27;s Valyrian steel sword Heartsbane. They travel on to Oldtown, where Sam is scheduled to explain events at Castle Black to the Archmaester. While Sam waits, he is permitted to peruse the Citadel&#x27;s library and is awestruck by the library&#x27;s expanse.

====Season 7====
During Sam&#x27;s early days at the Citadel, he is assigned to menial tasks. The only person who believes his account of the White Walkers&#x27; return is Archmaester Ebrose. However, Ebrose refuses to let Sam access forbidden textbooks to learn more about the White Walkers, as Ebrose does not consider them a threat serious enough to break with protocol. However, Sam steals a key to take the books back to his and Gilly&#x27;s quarters. In reading the books, he discovers the location of a large deposit of dragonglass in a map of Dragonstone and sends word to Jon, now King in the North, of its existence.

Sam encounters Jeor Mormont&#x27;s son Jorah, who is infected by the terminal disease greyscale. Sam discovers a cure for greyscale in an old medical text. Although Ebrose forbids him from attempting it, Sam treats Jorah anyway, out of gratitude for Jeor&#x27;s saving his life. Sam is successful in curing Jorah, who is discharged from the Citadel. Ebrose is grudgingly impressed, but as punishment for Sam&#x27;s disobedience tasks him to transcribe papers in danger of decomposing.

Sam overhears Ebrose and several other maesters discussing a warning sent by Bran about the White Walkers&#x27; march on the Wall, and is dismayed by the maesters&#x27; skepticism. While reading the papers in Sam&#x27;s quarters, Gilly discovers from a recently-deceased High Septon&#x27;s journal that Rhaegar Targaryen had his marriage to Elia Martell annulled and married Lyanna Stark in secret, but Sam does not realize the significance of this information due to Gilly&#x27;s having mispronounced Rhaegar. Annoyed at being unable to help in the battle against the White Walkers from the Citadel, Sam steals scrolls pertaining to the White Walkers and leaves Oldtown with Gilly and Little Sam.

Sam and his family arrive at Winterfell in the season finale, where Sam is reunited with Bran. When Bran tells Sam that Jon is the bastard son of his aunt Lyanna Stark with Rhaegar Targaryen, Sam recalls the record detailing the annulment Rhaegar received in order to marry another woman and tells Bran of his discovery. Bran uses his greenseeing abilities to witness the wedding, and discovers that Jon is the trueborn son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark, heir to the Iron Throne.

====Season 8====
Sam is approached by Daenerys Targaryen, who thanks him for saving Jorah&#x27;s life. However, Sam is grief-stricken when Daenerys reveals that she executed Randyll and Dickon for refusing to pledge fealty to her. Bran tells Sam to reveal to Jon his true parentage. As the preparations are being made for battle against the approaching army of White Walkers, Sam presents the Valyrian Steel sword of House Tarly, Heartsbane, to Jorah. Sam participates in the battle against the undead and is saved by Edd. After witnessing Edd being killed by a wight, Sam flees back into Winterfell. He ultimately survives the Long Night and participates in the funeral ceremony afterwards. When Jon travels south with Daenerys&#x27; army, Sam bids him farewell; it is revealed that Gilly is pregnant with Sam&#x27;s son.

Westeros is left without a ruler when, after Daenerys wrests control of King&#x27;s Landing from Cersei Lannister, she burns the surrendered populace of the city, during which Cersei is also killed. Jon fails to dissuade Daenerys from further destruction and ultimately assassinates her. Following Tyrion Lannister&#x27;s arrest and Jon&#x27;s imprisonment, Sam journeys south to participate in the council to determine the future of the Seven Kingdoms. Sam suggests holding an election where all the people of Westeros are permitted to vote for the next ruler, but the idea is mocked and dismissed. Tyrion suggests Bran as King and Sam is the first to agree to Bran&#x27;s crowning. Sam is appointed as Grand Maester in Bran&#x27;s Small Council.

== TV adaptation ==

Samwell Tarly is played by John Bradley in the television adaption of the book series. Samwell Tarly appeared for the first time in season 1 episode 4, as a new recruit of the Night&#x27;s Watch and a self-described coward. It was Bradley&#x27;s first professional appearance after graduating from The Manchester Metropolitan School of Theatre. The scene used in the auditions belonged to &quot;Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things,&quot; with Sam explaining to Jon how Sam&#x27;s father forced him to &quot;take the black&quot; (meaning join the Night&#x27;s Watch). According to author and executive producer George R. R. Martin, Bradley delivered &quot;a heartbreaking performance.&quot; When asked which character he personally would be on the show, Martin said of Samwell Tarly, &quot;I love Sam, too. He&#x27;s a great character - Tyrion might be who I want to be, but Sam is probably closer to who I actually am. The fat kid who likes to read books and doesn&#x27;t like to go up a lot of stairs.&quot;

Remarking on the character&#x27;s sex life with Gilly, Bradley said:

I think Sam would just happily accept more of the same. He&#x27;s not one of the people that tries to inject exotica into his sex life; Sam thinks about sex the way that most people think about space. It goes on. He has nothing to do with it. He&#x27;s fascinated by it in a childlike way.

<text>Mario Alinei (10 August 1926 – 9 August 2018) was an Italian linguist and professor emeritus at the University of Utrecht, where he taught from 1959 to 1987. He was founder and editor of &quot;Quaderni di semantica&quot;, a journal of theoretical and applied semantics. Until 1997, he was president of &quot;Atlas Linguarum Europae&quot; at UNESCO.

==Biography==
Alinei was born in Turin, Italy in August 1926. He authored hundreds of publications and was a prominent scholar in the field of dialectology. 
Alinei was a pioneer in the use of computers in linguistics. According to Pavle Ivić, &quot;Alinei is one of the not so numerous European linguists who already in the early sixties were willing and able to apply the results of technological innovations to the study of language.&quot;

After his retirement, beginning in 1996, Alinei also became known as a proponent of the Paleolithic continuity theory that Indo-European languages originated in Europe during the Upper Paleolithic. He died in Impruneta, Italy in August 2018, two days shy of his 92nd birthday.

Chosun University was founded by the Chosun College Founders&#x27; Association. The Association was formed in May 1946, and rapidly gained members throughout Chungcheong, Jeolla, and Jeju provinces. According to the school website, &quot;membership rose to more than 72,000 by the end of 1947.&quot; The first classes of the school, then called Kwangju Evening Academy, were held on September 29, 1946. It was renamed Chosun Academy shortly thereafter, and became a college in 1948. It became a university at the beginning of the 1953 school year, at which time the graduate school was also established.

==Sister schools==
Chosun University maintains sisterhood ties with a large number of institutions: 70 internationally, and 42 domestically. Countries involved include Australia, China, Colombia, Egypt, Germany, India, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, Nepal, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Russia, Taiwan, Thailand, the United States, Kenya and Vietnam.

== Annual event ==
Chosun University has a variety of annual events, including rose festivals and grand festivals. On May 23, 2003, a rose festival will be held every May in the name of the rose festival - the scent of white rose. During the ceremony, there will be celebration performances and experience events such as performances by famous singers, colleges and clubs, Making book with roses, and origami of roses are held, and digital photo contest and rose garden photo exhibition are held.

<doc id="1325388" wikidata="Q756720" url="?curid=1325388" title="Ambulatory">
<text>The ambulatory ( &#x27;walking place&#x27;) is the covered passage around a cloister or the processional way around the east end of a cathedral or large church and behind the high altar. The first ambulatory was in France in the 11th century but by the 13th century ambulatories had been introduced in England and many English cathedrals were extended to provide an ambulatory.

The same feature is often found in Indian architecture and Buddhist architecture generally, especially in older periods. Ritual circumambulation or parikrama around a stupa or cult image is important in Buddhism and Hinduism. Often the whole building was circumambulated, often many times. The Buddhist chaitya hall always allowed a path for this, and the Durga temple, Aihole (7th or 8th century) is a famous Hindu example.

The term is also used to describe a garden feature in the grounds of a country house. A typical example is the one shown, which stands in the grounds of Horton Court in Gloucestershire, England.

==Medical term==
Ambulatory is also an adjective used to describe
*patients who can walk despite their illness or injury.
*outpatients generally including those needing a wheelchair.
*medical staff providing outpatient care (see &quot;Ambulatory care nursing&quot;, &quot;Ambulatist&quot;).
*medical procedures that do not ordinarily require an overnight stay in hospital (see &quot;Ambulatory care&quot;).
*Canes or other walking aids can be called ambulatory assistive devices.

<doc id="1325400" wikidata="Q7392910" url="?curid=1325400" title="SR W class">
<text>The SR Class W were 3-cylinder 2-6-4T tank engines designed in 1929 by Richard Maunsell for use on the Southern Railway. They were introduced in 1932 and constructed at Eastleigh and Ashford. The class was intended for short distance, inter-company/regional freight traffic transfer in London, and were standardised with parts from the N, N1, U and U1 classes.

==Background==
From the 1920s London was surrounded by a number of large freight Marshalling yards, where long-distance freight trains were brought and re-organised into new trains for onward transmission to their destinations. Three of these yards, at Feltham, Norwood and Hither Green, were operated by the Southern Railway. The requirement for a fast freight transfer locomotive between these yards, and across London to other railway yards, provided a challenge for Richard Maunsell. The electrified suburban lines were busy with commuter traffic which took priority over freight workings, and the London network abounded with junctions and signal stops. The design brief called for a powerful locomotive with good acceleration and adhesion: one that was able to climb the steep gradients over the flying junctions that were to be found all over the Southern Railway&#x27;s London network. The ability to operate over tight curves and be able to pull away from a standstill on the aforementioned gradients were also key considerations that needed to be incorporated into the design. A tank locomotive design was also preferable since the journeys were relatively short, and the work would involve frequent changes in direction.

==Design==
The SR Z class was considered at first, but due to the specialist characteristics of the design as a yard engine for marshalling freight, they were not deemed fit for the purpose of hauling loads under the tight timings of London&#x27;s railway system. The solution was a smaller wheeled version of the ill-fated K1 &quot;River&quot; class tank engines, with three cylinders to allow for better acceleration and three sets of Walschaerts valve gear. The resultant W class was designed in 1929. 

As a result of the rebuilding of the K1 class following the Sevenoaks railway accident, surplus bogies and leading wheels were available for the new design. A Cartazzi axle was used for the leading pair of wheels rather than a swivelling pony truck. The 2-6-4 wheel arrangement was settled upon as being ideal for intensive suburban routes, and the use of parts from the K Class and the same boiler as used on the N, N1 and U1 classes enabled the standardisation of Southern locomotives to continue. The locomotives were provided with heavy braking equipment in order to handle the trains of freight wagons with or without continuous brakes that were in use at the time. With this in mind the class was (unusually) provided with extra braking on the bogie wheels.

== Construction history ==
An initial order was placed with Eastleigh railway works for ten locomotives, with the frames to be constructed at Ashford railway works and the boilers at Brighton railway works. However, by the time that Ashford had delivered the first five sets of frames in early 1930 a severe trade recession meant that they were no longer needed. The frames were stored and the boilers used as spares for the N and U class locomotives. By mid 1931 trade had recovered to allow construction of the initial five to be completed. These were delivered during January and February 1932. The components for the remaining five locomotives still on order were gathered at Eastleigh during 1932, but once again their construction was delayed pending a more sustained economic recovery, and the boilers were used elsewhere.
A second batch consisting of these five locomotives together with a further five ordered in March 1930 were eventually delivered between April 1935 and April 1936. Eastleigh works was then committed to the construction of the Schools class and so the order was transferred to Ashford.

===Variations===

The two batches differed from each other because the Eastleigh batch had gravity sanding capability and steam regulators on the right hand side, whilst the Ashford batch had steam sanding and regulators on the left, as was common on most other classes of Southern locomotives.

=== Modifications ===
The first batch was modified between 1959 and 1960 to incorporate steam sanding, as this was already present on the Ashford batch. The right hand driving, however, remained.

== Livery and numbering ==

=== Southern ===
The first batch was turned out in black livery with green lining, and were numbered 1911–1915 with &#x27;Southern&#x27; in yellow on the water tanks. The Ashford batch was outshopped in unlined black livery, and the initial batch were also converted to this new livery. These locomotives were numbered 1916–1925.

===Post-1948 (nationalisation)===
The locomotives retained their freight black liveries, and the BR crest was placed on the water tank sides. Numbering was per the BR standard numbering system, in the range 31911–31925.

== Operational details ==
The class was mainly used around London working from Hither Green, Norwood and Feltham yards. They were also used on inter-company/regional transfer freight duties over the West London Line to Old Oak Common, Willesden, Cricklewood and Ferme Park marshalling yards.

The class was generally well liked by their crews apart from the fact that the driver was on the right hand side of the Eastleigh batch, which made accurate stopping difficult when signalling was predominantly on the left on the Southern network. This would have meant that the fireman was frequently utilised as lookout on the left hand side.

In 1948 there was a chronic shortage of large passenger tank locomotives on the un-electrified lines of the former London Brighton and South Coast Railway. As a result, trials of the class were made with passenger stock between Victoria railway station and Tunbridge Wells West railway station via the Oxted Line. However, like the K and K1 classes the W class were found to be unstable at speed and were banned from use on passenger trains.

==Withdrawal==
The class began to be withdrawn from service in 1963, with the last removed from the books in 1964. No examples of this class of locomotive survived into preservation.

<text>Amélie-les-Bains-Palalda (; ) is a commune in the Pyrénées-Orientales department in southern France.

It is situated in the Tech valley, and combines the old and the new with a mix of narrow cobbled streets and modern accommodation. It has become a &#x27;station verte&#x27; meaning that it must strive at all times to ensure that tourists benefit from a calm and natural environment.

==Geography==

=== Location ===
Amélie-les-Bains-Palalda is located in the canton of Le Canigou and in the arrondissement of Céret. It sits at the confluence of the Mondony with the Tech, SSW of Perpignan by road. The town is situated at a height of and has both a winter and summer season.

=== Climate ===
In the winter season the average temperature is about 10 degrees Celsius, and in the summer it is roughly 29 degrees Celsius with the occasional thunderstorm late afternoon.

=== Springs ===
The town has numerous sulphur springs (20-60C.). They have been used as baths by those with rheumatism and illnesses of the lungs. By the end of the 19th century there were two bathing establishments, one of which preserved remains of Roman baths, and a large military thermal hospital.

== Toponymy ==
The town, formerly called &quot;Les-Bains-d&#x27;Arles&quot;, became &quot;Fort-les-Bains&quot; in 1670 after the construction of the new castle. It was renamed &quot;Amélie-les-Bains&quot; in 1840 after Queen Amelia wife of Louis Philippe. She finally visited the town in 1848, and subsequently promoted it. In Catalan it is still called &quot;Els banys d&#x27;Arles&quot;.

==History==

In 1942, the former communes of Amélie-les-Bains and Palalda were merged to form the new commune Amélie-les-Bains-Palalda.

== Government and politics ==

François Mefler, mayor of Amélie-les-Bains since October 1941, became the new mayor of Amélie-les-Bains-Palalda in October 1942, after Amélie-les-Bains and Palalda were united together.

<doc id="1325417" wikidata="Q4133147" url="?curid=1325417" title="King William's College">
<text>King William&#x27;s College () is a co-educational private school for pupils aged 3 to 18 near Castletown on the Isle of Man. It is a member of the International Baccalaureate and Headmasters&#x27; and Headmistresses&#x27; Conference organisations. The College operates at two sites: a main senior school campus on the shore of Castletown Bay, and a prep school (The Buchan School) in the Westhill part of Castletown. The College was originally for boys only, but became co-educational in the 1980s. It has roughly five hundred pupils.

The UK Department for Education categorises it as an Overseas British school.

==History==
The establishment of the College was funded principally by the Bishop Barrow Trust, originally set up in 1668 to provide education in the Isle of Man. When founded in 1833, the College opened its doors with only 46 boys. The shield in the centre of the College&#x27;s coat of arms is that of Bishop Isaac Barrow. The school was named after King William IV, who is said to have been asked for a financial contribution and to have offered the founders &quot;my most valuable possession, my name&quot;.

The school features, thinly disguised, in the Victorian schoolboy book &quot;Eric, or, Little by Little&quot; by Dean Farrar who had himself been a boy at the school. Though the school name was changed to Bishop’s College, it is the central location, too, in the book &#x27;The Zone&#x27; by Graham Hamer who was educated at King William&#x27;s College in the 1960s.

The college is also famous for its annual open water half-mile swim in Derbyhaven Bay, which usually takes place in late June, depending on tides and weather conditions. Around thirty pupils and staff take part each year. It is compulsory for all other students to watch the swim.

==General Knowledge Paper (GKP)==
Since 1904, the College has set an annual general knowledge test, known as the General Knowledge Paper (GKP). In the past pupils sat the test twice: once unseen on the day before the Christmas holidays, and again when they returned to school in the New Year, after spending the holiday researching the answers. The test is now voluntary. It is well known to be highly difficult, a common score for the unseen test is just two correct answers from the list (180 questions in 2018). The best scores are 40 to 50 for the unseen test and about 270 out of 360 for the second sitting. Traditionally, the best scorers were given a half day free from school, while anyone doing particularly badly was given a detention.

The quiz is always introduced with the following Latin motto: &quot;&quot;, which translates as: &quot;To know where you can find anything is, after all, the greatest part of erudition.&quot;

The quiz is popular with non-pupils. It appears on the school&#x27;s website, and has been published in &quot;The Guardian&quot; since 1951.

The current quizmaster is Dr Pat Cullen, a retired general practitioner, who has been setting the quiz since 1997. He reports that he now checks questions by typing them into Google and changing them if necessary to ensure the answers cannot be found immediately.

Today, the GKP is sent home to parents; there is a prize, presented at Founders&#x27; Day, for the winning family. There is great competition between the local Manx families over this test.

==Houses==
* Colbourne House – mixed boarding house
* Dickson House – mixed day house
* Walters House – mixed day house

The original house system was replaced in 2003–2004 with form centres. Whilst the house system was kept by name only, the main social function of the house system was lost. Many OKWs (Old King Williams) still refer to the original house names. Colbourne house was the boys boarding house with School house being the girls&#x27; boarding house. School house is situated in the main school, where the female boarders reside and are still referred to as the &quot;School house girls&quot;, but are now a part of Colbourne house.

Original houses
* Hunt house – day boys&#x27; house (now occupied by the 5th Form Centre)
* Raglan house – day boys&#x27; house (now occupied by the 6th Form Centre)
* Barrow house – day girls&#x27; house
* Wilson house – boarding boys&#x27; house
* Colbourne house – Boarding boys&#x27; house
* Dickson house – Boarding boys&#x27; house
* School house – Boarding boys&#x27; house

==Praepositors==
A praepositor is an equivalent of a prefect: a member of the Upper Sixth who has considerable responsibility within the school. The title Head of School is given to the most senior Praepositor. The Head of School can be either male or female. Depending on the gender of the Head of School, their subordinate colleague will be known as either the Head Boy or the Head Girl. The Head of School is a long-established post, with the first recorded appointment in 1846.

==Combined Cadet Force==
The King William&#x27;s College Combined Cadet Force (CCF) is a voluntary youth organisation sponsored by the UK Ministry of Defence. The College has a long and proud military history; its Officers&#x27; Training Corps (OTC) was the only contingent to see active service in the Great War, guarding prisoners of war at Douglas and providing the first recruits from the Island. 546 members of the College community served in the First World War with 45 killed and 45 wounded from the OTC alone. In the Second World War 696 served. Former cadets have won many honours in times of war, including 7 Distinguished Service Orders, 2 Distinguished Service Crosses, 25 Military Crosses, 2 Croix de Guerre, 3 Military Medals and 3 Distinguished Conduct Medals.

Established in 1911 by Lt K.A.R. Sugden, the OTC comprised two platoons. After the First World War, the OTC continued in its role of providing basic military training in the inter-war years. Notably, it mounted a guard of honour for the visit of King George V and Queen Mary to the Isle of Man in July 1920. This OTC unit later evolved into the Junior Training Corps (JTC) about a year before the beginning of the Second World War. Again in 1945 the JTC provided a guard of honour as the College welcomed King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, the first Royal guests to the College. In 1948 Field Marshal Viscount Montgomery visited the school. In that same year, the CCF was established as the JTC was integrated with the Air Training Corps (ATC) and Sea Cadet Corps (SCC) at King William&#x27;s College. Membership of the CCF was compulsory for all students in their 3rd, 4th and 5th years until 2005. From 2011 students from Castle Rushen High School have been invited to join the Force. To this day, the CCF provides a guard of honour on Tynwald Day.

Under the auspices of the CCF, King William&#x27;s College joined the Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Award scheme in 1966. Since 2007, however, the scheme has been run independently of the cadet force.

The modern-day CCF consists of three sections: Army, Royal Navy (RN) and Royal Air Force (RAF).

Cadets in the Army Section learn basic military skills, such as marksmanship and fieldcraft, in addition to expedition skills. Senior cadets are responsible for the development of the training programme and the instruction of junior cadets. The training programme follows the Army Proficiency Certificate (APC) syllabus and a practical approach is adopted together with integrated scenarios. At the end of each academic year, the cadets have the chance to participate in a week-long camp at a military establishment.

The RN Section provides cadets with the opportunity to experience different water-based activities, for example, sailing and kayaking. The Naval Proficiency Certificate syllabus is followed to develop seamanship knowledge and skills, such as rope work.

The RAF Section follows the prescribed Air Cadet Proficiency (ACP) syllabus, including airmanship and navigation. Essential qualities, like self-discipline, teamwork, and leadership, are developed through the conduction of practical leadership tasks and navigation activities.

The Cadet Vocational Qualifications Organisation (CVQO) has offered cadets the opportunity to receive internationally recognised BTEC Diploma qualifications. All cadets over the age of 16 may register for any of the qualifications on offer.

==Sports==
King Williams College has a long sporting history, the College&#x27;s unique site in Castletown allows for a variety of sports to be played, and its cricket pitches are used for international competitions, such as in July 2023 when the College&#x27;s grounds hosted Isle of Man vs Austria in the T20I. The College fields several competitive teams in a number of sports including Rugby, Football, Hockey, Cricket, Basketball, Netball, and Golf, among others.

The school&#x27;s most historic and prestigious fixture is the 1 XV Rugby match against Liverpool College a school in Liverpool, England. The match has been played since 1903, the current format consists of two legs, with the overall winner being awarded the Mark Richard Wheeler Memorial Cup, the cup is dedicated in memory of Mark Wheeler, who was a parent of a KWC 1XV player who passed away.

<doc id="1325445" wikidata="Q5532867" url="?curid=1325445" title="Genetic Savings &amp; Clone">
<text>Genetic Savings &amp; Clone, Inc. was a company headquartered in Sausalito, California that offered commercial pet gene banking and cloning services, between 2004 and 2006. The company was launched by billionaire John Sperling, the founder of University of Phoenix. Its Chief Executive Officer was Lou Hawthorne. 

==History==
The company was founded as a result of the efforts to clone Lou Hawthorne&#x27;s favorite family dog, Missy. The Missyplicity project generated enough interest that Lou Hawthorne decided to build a company devoted to dog and cat cloning.

The company opened for business in February 2000, funded production of the first cloned cat, CC, in 2001, and launched its pet cloning service in February 2004, operating a &quot;petbank&quot;, to which pet owners could send tissue samples for later use in cloning. The company delivered the world&#x27;s first commercially cloned cat, Little Nicky, in December 2004. Little Nicky was sold to a Texas woman for a reported US$50,000. He was a genetic twin of &quot;Nicky,&quot; a 17-year-old Maine Coon cat that had been kept as a pet. Musician Liam Lynch&#x27;s cat was cloned after its death, presumably making him the first celebrity to own a cloned pet. 

As well as their success in cloning cats, the company also made significant advances in dog cloning research, although the technology was not mature enough to sustain the business. The company closed in 2006. Letters to this effect were sent out to clients at the end of September 2006, informing them of this decision and offering to transfer any genetic material to another facility.

==Controversy==
The company spurred widespread debate regarding the ethics and morality of pet cloning especially in light of the fact that animals are euthanized by their owners every day. Though the topic lost currency with the closure of the company, divergent arguments about these issues can still be found on some web sites.

<doc id="1325450" wikidata="Q1969077" url="?curid=1325450" title="Shaft tomb">
<text>A shaft tomb or shaft grave is a type of deep rectangular burial structure, similar in shape to the much shallower cist grave, containing a floor of pebbles, walls of rubble masonry, and a roof constructed of wooden planks.

==Practice==
The practice of digging shaft tombs was a widespread phenomenon with prominent examples found in Mycenaean Greece; in Bronze Age China; and in Mesoamerican Western Mexico.

In the Neolithic period Epirus was populated by seafarers along the coast and by shepherds and hunters from the southwestern Balkans who brought with them the Proto-Greek language. These people buried their leaders in large mounds containing shaft graves. Similar burial chambers were subsequently used by the Mycenaean civilization, suggesting that the founders of Mycenae may have come from Epirus and central Albania. Epirus itself remained culturally backward during this time, but Mycenaean remains have been found at two religious shrines of great antiquity in the region: the Oracle of the Dead on the Acheron River, familiar to the heroes of Homer&#x27;s Odyssey, and the Oracle of Zeus at Dodona, to whom Achilles prayed in the Iliad.

===Mycenaean Greece===
Mycenaean shaft graves originated and evolved from rudimentary Middle Helladic cists, tumuli, and tholos tombs with features derived from Early Bronze Age traditions developed locally in mainland Bronze Age Greece 16th century BCE. Middle Helladic burials would ultimately serve as the basis for the royal Shaft Graves containing a variety of grave goods, which signified the elevation of a native Greek-speaking royal dynasty whose economic power depended on long-distance sea trade.

The depth of Mycenaean shaft tombs would range from with a mound constructed for each grave and stelae erected. Archaeological examples include Grave Circle A and Grave Circle B.

===Bronze Age China===
Shaft graves were used by elites from the Shang dynasty (or Yin dynasty) during the Bronze Age 1200 BCE of northern China.

===Mesoamerican Western Mexico===
The Western Mexico shaft tomb tradition or shaft tomb culture refers to a set of interlocked cultural traits found in the present day western Mexican states of Jalisco, Nayarit, and, to a lesser extent, Colima to its south, roughly dating to the period between 300 BCE and 400 CE. An example is the La Campana archaeological site of the Capacha and subsequent cultures.

<text>Guy Mouminoux (13 January 1927 – 11 January 2022), known by the pseudonym Guy Sajer, was a French writer and cartoonist who is best known as the author of the Second World War novel &quot;Le Soldat Oublié&quot; (1965, translated as &quot;The Forgotten Soldier&quot;), based on his experience serving in the Wehrmacht on the Eastern Front from 1942 to 1945, in the elite Großdeutschland Division. After the war, Mouminoux had a long career as a cartoonist, writing and illustrating under his real name, and also under the pen names Dimitri, and Dimitri Lahache.

==Early life==
Guy Mouminoux was born in Paris on 13 January 1927, the son of a French father and an Alsatian German mother whose maiden name was Sajer. He was raised in Alsace, which was effectively annexed by Germany in 1940 following the Fall of France. According to his autobiographical novel &quot;The Forgotten Soldier&quot;, Sajer joined the Wehrmacht in 1942, aged 16. &quot;My parents were country people, born hundreds of miles apart, a distance filled with difficulties. There were two flags for me to honour. I entered the service, dreamed and hoped. I also knew cold and fear in places never seen by Lili Marlene&quot;.

==World War II==
Mouminoux wrote about his experience on the Eastern Front during World War II in his book &quot;Le Soldat Oublié&quot; (&quot;The Forgotten Soldier&quot;), published in 1965, more than 20 years after the events it describes, under the pseudonym Guy Sajer. The author states that he was an inhabitant of Alsace drafted into the German Wehrmacht at age 16, in 1942, (the author is mistaken on this point as he would&#x27;ve been 15 at this time given that he was born on January 13, 1927) and that he fought in the elite Großdeutschland Division during World War II, taking his mother&#x27;s name so as to blend in better with his German comrades.

The accuracy and authenticity of the book have been disputed by some historians, who argue that the book is not a completely factual account, but rather a romanticised novel - a roman à clef. Some of the details in the book, such as the precise location of the division&#x27;s insignia, are incorrect, while others are impossible to verify due to the lack of surviving witnesses or official documents, most of which were destroyed during or after the war.

In a later interview, the author recalled: &quot;It&#x27;s a story... of a man forced to do things he did not want to do. When Alsace, where I lived, was annexed by Germany, I was 13 years old. From a youth camp in Strasbourg, I moved to a youth camp in Kehl, Germany. We dreamed of being real soldiers... I found myself in the Wehrmacht, the German army. What would you have me do? As a deserter, I would have been shot...We trailed in the mud, we did not sleep and we were afraid, it was terror. But I do not regret anything, I&#x27;m glad I knew it, even if it was very hard&quot;.

==Career as comic artist==
After the war, Mouminoux worked extensively in comics published for the Franco-Belgian market under his real name, and also a variety of pseudonyms: &quot;Lahache&quot;, &quot;Dimitri Lahache&quot; and just &quot;Dimitri&quot;. 
Mouminoux&#x27;s comics often include the theme of war and plenty of black humor.

He made his debut as a comic artist in 1946, working extensively in the 1950s and 1960s for the French magazine &quot;Cœurs Vaillants&quot; and its two spin-offs from Catholic publisher Fleurus, creating comics of a mostly historical nature, inspired by his predecessor Jijé.

For Fleurus, he co-illustrated two educational books together with younger colleague and future French comic great Jean Giraud, who was also employed at the publisher as comic artist in the period 1956-1958.

After a couple of early editorial illustrations, Mouminoux followed his colleague into the employ of publisher Dargaud in the 1960s, where he created several humoristic comics for its magazine &quot;Pilote&quot; aside from providing additional illustrations for the editorials. He also befriended his earlier role model Jijé, and became assistant on the adventure Jean Valhardi series.

The publication of &quot;The Forgotten Soldier&quot; in 1965 brought Mouminoux success as a writer, but also cost him his job as a comic artist. &quot;It allowed me to live for years. [But] If I chose to publish my novel under a pseudonym [it] was precisely not to mix everything... Now everyone knows it&#x27;s me, but at the time, I was furious. I got fired from &quot;Pilote&quot; because of that.&quot;

<text>The Feast of the Ascension of Jesus Christ (also called the Solemnity of the Ascension of the Lord, Ascension Day, Ascension Thursday, or sometimes Holy Thursday) commemorates the Christian belief of the bodily Ascension of Jesus into Heaven. It is one of the ecumenical (shared by multiple denominations) feasts of Christian churches, ranking with the feasts of the Passion and Pentecost. Following the account of that the risen Jesus appeared for 40 days prior to his Ascension, Ascension Day is traditionally celebrated on a Thursday, the fortieth day of Easter according to inclusive counting, although some Christian denominations have moved the observance to the following Sunday, sometimes called Ascension Sunday. The day of observance varies by ecclesiastical province in many Christian denominations, as with Methodists and Catholics, for example.

Ascensiontide refers to the ten-day period between the Feast of the Ascension and the Feast of Pentecost. The Sunday within that period may be referred to as the Seventh Sunday of Easter or the Sunday in Ascensiontide.

==History==
The observance of this feast is of great antiquity. Eusebius seems to hint at the celebration of it in the 4th century. At the beginning of the 5th century, Augustine of Hippo says that it is of Apostolic origin, and he speaks of it in a way that shows it was the universal observance of the Catholic Church long before his time. Frequent mention of it is made in the writings of John Chrysostom, Gregory of Nyssa, and in the &quot;Constitution of the Apostles&quot;. The &quot;Pilgrimage of Aetheria&quot; speaks of the vigil of this feast and of the feast itself, as they were kept in the church built over the grotto in Bethlehem in which Christ is traditionally regarded as having been born. It may be that prior to the 5th century the event narrated in the Gospels was commemorated in conjunction with the feast of Easter or Pentecost. Some believe that the much-disputed forty-third decree of the Synod of Elvira () condemning the practice of observing a feast on the fortieth day after Easter and neglecting to keep Pentecost on the fiftieth day, implies that the proper usage of the time was to commemorate the Ascension along with Pentecost. Representations of the mystery are found in diptychs and frescoes dating as early as the 5th century. Hymns for this feast are found in the Georgian Chantbook of Jerusalem, which contains material composed during the 5th century.

==In Western Christianity==
The Latin terms used for the feast, and, occasionally, , signify that Christ was raised up by his own powers, and it is from these terms that the holy day gets its name. In the Book of Common Prayer of the Anglican Communion, &quot;Holy Thursday&quot; is listed as another name for Ascension Day. William Blake&#x27;s poem &quot;Holy Thursday&quot; refers to Ascension Day; Thomas Pruen used the term to refer to Ascension Day in his &quot;Illustration of the Liturgy of the Church of England&quot;, published in 1820; however use of the term &quot;Holy Thursday&quot; to mean Ascension Day is rare, and the term is more generally applied by most Christian denominations to Maundy Thursday in Holy Week.

In Western Christianity, the earliest possible date is April 30 (as in 1818 and 2285), the latest possible date is June 3 (as in 1943 and 2038). In the Catholic Church, the Ascension of the Lord is ranked as a Solemnity and is a Holy Day of Obligation. In the Anglican Communion, Ascension Day is a Principal Feast.

The three days before Ascension Thursday are sometimes referred to as the Rogation days, and the previous Sunday—the Sixth Sunday of Easter (or the Fifth Sunday Easter)—as Rogation Sunday.

Ascension has a vigil and, since the 15th century, an octave, which is set apart for a novena of preparation for Pentecost.

In traditional Methodist usage, &quot;The Book of Worship for Church and Home&quot; (1965) provides the following Collect for Ascension Day, commonly called Holy Thursday: 

===Sunday observance===

Catholic parishes in a number of countries that do not observe the feast as a public holiday have obtained permission from the Vatican to move observance of the Feast of the Ascension from the traditional Thursday to the following Sunday, the Sunday before Pentecost. Similarly, the United Methodist Church allows the traditional celebration on Holy Thursday to be moved to Sunday. This is in keeping with a trend to move Holy Days of Obligation from weekdays to Sunday, to encourage more Christians to observe feasts considered important. The decision to move a feast is made by each Conference of Catholic Bishops with prior approval of the Apostolic See. In some cases the Conference may delegate the determination for specific feasts to the bishops of an ecclesiastical province within the conference, i.e. an archbishop and the neighbouring bishops.

The switch to Sunday was made in 1992 by the Conference of Catholic Bishops in Australia; before 1996 in parts of Europe; in 1997 in Ireland; before 1998 in Canada and parts of the western United States; in many other parts in the United States from 1999; and in England and Wales from 2007 to 2017, but in 2018 reinstated to Thursday. In the U.S., the determination of whether to move Ascension was delegated to the provinces by the USCCB, and the ecclesiastical provinces which retain Thursday observance in 2022 are Boston, Hartford, New York, Omaha, Philadelphia, and the Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of Saint Peter. When celebrated on Sunday, the earliest possible date is May 3, and the latest is June 6.

==In Eastern and Oriental Orthodox Christianity==
In the Eastern Church this feast is known in Greek as &quot;Analepsis&quot;, the &quot;taking up&quot;, and also as the &quot;Episozomene&quot;, the &quot;salvation from on high&quot;, denoting that by ascending into his glory Christ completed the work of our redemption. Ascension is one of the Twelve Great Feasts of the Orthodox liturgical year.

===Celebration===
The feast is always observed with an All-night vigil. The day before is the Apodosis (leave-taking) of Easter (i.e., the last day of the Feast of Easter). Before the Vigil, the Paschal Hours are said for the last time and the Paschal greeting is exchanged.

The &quot;Paroemia&quot; (Old Testament readings) at Vespers on the eve of the Feast are ; , ; and , . A Lity is celebrated. The troparion of the day is sung, which says:

During the Polyeleos at Matins, the Epitaphios, which was placed on the altar on Holy Saturday (either at Matins or the Midnight Office, depending on local custom) is taken from the altar and carried in procession around the church. It is then put in the place reserved for it. The Gospel is . The kontakion is sung, which announces:

The megalynarion and irmos from Ode IX of the Canon (also sung at liturgy) is:

At the Divine Liturgy, special antiphons are sung in place of Psalms 102 and 145 and the Beatitudes. The Epistle is , and the Gospel is .

===Observance===
Ascension Thursday also commemorates the Holy Georgian Martyrs of Persia (17th–18th centuries).

Ascension has an Afterfeast of eight days. The Sunday after Ascension is the Sunday of the Holy Fathers of the First Ecumenical Council at Nicaea. This council formulated the Nicene Creed up to the words, &quot;He (Jesus) ascended into heaven, and sits at the right hand of the Father; and shall come again, with glory, to judge the living and the dead; Whose kingdom shall have no end.&quot; The Afterfeast ends on the following Friday, the Friday before Pentecost. The next day is appropriately a Saturday of the Dead (general commemoration of all faithful departed).

The Eastern Orthodox Church uses a different method of calculating the date of Easter, so the Eastern Orthodox commemoration of Ascension will usually be after the western observance (either one week, or four weeks, or five weeks later; but occasionally on the same day). The earliest possible date for the feast is May 13 (of the Western calendar), and the latest possible date is June 16. Some of the Oriental Orthodox Churches, however, observe Ascension on the same date as the Western Churches.

==Music==
The feast has been associated with specific hymns and other church music. The oldest hymn in German related to the feast is the Leise &quot;Christ fuhr gen Himmel&quot;, first published in 1480. Johann Sebastian Bach composed several cantatas and the &quot;Ascension Oratorio&quot; to be performed in church services on the feast day. He first performed &quot;Wer da gläubet und getauft wird, BWV 37&quot;, on 18 May 1724, &quot;Auf Christi Himmelfahrt allein, BWV 128&quot;, on 10 May 1725, &quot;Gott fähret auf mit Jauchzen, BWV 43&quot;, on 30 May 1726 and the oratorio, &quot;Lobet Gott in seinen Reichen, BWV 11&quot;, on 19 May 1735.

Many Messianic psalms are used at the feast of Ascension including Psalm 24, Psalm 47 and Psalm 68. The dialogue &quot;Lift up your heads, O ye gates&quot; from Psalm 24 (verses 7–10) has inspired Handel&#x27;s setting in Part II of his &quot;Messiah&quot; in the scene &quot;Ascension&quot;, and Christoph Bernhard Verspoell&#x27;s 1810 hymn in German, &quot;&quot;. Phillip Moore&#x27;s anthem &quot;The Ascension&quot; sets words based on the same verses.

Olivier Messiaen wrote an orchestral suite, later partly transcribed for organ, called &quot;L&#x27;Ascension&quot; in the 1930s.

Settings of &quot;God is gone up&quot; have been composed by William Croft, Arthur Hutchings and Gerald Finzi (words by Edward Taylor). Other settings suitable for the occasion include William Matthias&#x27;s &quot;Lift up your heads&quot;. &quot;Im Himmel hoch verherrlicht ist&quot; (Highly gloryfied in Heaven) is a 1973 hymn in German for the occasion.

The RSCM has produced an extensive list of music (including hymns, anthems and organ music) suitable for Ascension.

<text>The Solemnity of Our Lord Jesus Christ, King of the Universe, commonly referred to as the Feast of Christ the King, Christ the King Sunday or Reign of Christ Sunday, is a feast in the liturgical year which emphasises the true kingship of Christ. The feast is a relatively recent addition to the liturgical calendar, instituted in 1925 by Pope Pius XI for the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church. In 1970, its Roman Rite observance was moved from October to the last Sunday of Ordinary Time and thus to the end of the liturgical year. The earliest date on which the Feast of Christ the King can occur is 20 November and the latest is 26 November. It typically marks the end of Ordinary Time, which continues up until Advent Sunday, the first day of Advent. Depending on the year, Saint Andrew&#x27;s Day, significant in some cultures, may fall prior to Advent Sunday. Thus, Christ the King is typically the last or second-to-last calendrical feast of the liturgical year.
The Lutheran, Anglican, Moravian, Methodist, Nazarene, Reformed and United Protestant churches also celebrate the Feast of Christ the King, which is contained in the Revised Common Lectionary; the Methodist, Anglican and Presbyterian Churches often observe this as part of the liturgical season of Kingdomtide, which runs between the Fourth Sunday before Advent and the Feast of Christ the King. It is also observed on the same computed date as the final Sunday of the ecclesiastical year, the Sunday before the First Sunday of Advent, by Western Rite parishes of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia. Roman Catholics adhering to the Extraordinary Form of the Roman Rite use the General Roman Calendar of 1960 and continue to observe the Solemnity on the date established in 1925, the final Sunday of October.

==Origin in patristics==

According to Cyril of Alexandria, Christ &quot;has dominion over all creatures, a dominion not seized by violence nor usurped, but his by essence and by nature. His kingship is founded upon the hypostatic union. From this it follows not only that Christ is to be adored by angels and men, but that to him as man angels and men are subject, and must recognize his empire; by reason of the hypostatic union Christ has power over all creatures.&quot;

The Feast of Christ the King has an eschatological dimension, pointing to the end of time when the kingdom of Jesus will be established in all its fullness to the ends of the earth.

==Observance==
=== Roman Catholic Church ===

Pope Pius XI instituted the Feast of Christ the King in his encyclical &quot;Quas primas&quot; of 1925, in response to growing secularism and secular ultra-nationalism, and in the context of the unresolved Roman Question.

In November 1926, Pope Pius XI gave his direct assent for the priest of a promising young parish in Mount Lookout, Cincinnati, to establish the first church dedicated to Christ under the title of King. In May 1927, a purpose-built sanctuary was consecrated. 1956 saw the construction of the current church, led by the architect Edward J. Schulte. The campus is an unapologetic love letter to its royal namesake, featuring a towering Byzantine mosaic of Christ, crowned and robed, above the high altar where Catholic practice usually expects a crucifix (most Protestant institutions simply employ symbolic crosses). This instance illustrates a marked change of tone that arose as a product of the Vatican&#x27;s endorsement of this feast and the associated devotional.

The title of the feast was &quot;Domini Nostri Jesu Christi Regis&quot; ([of] Our Lord Jesus Christ the King), and the date was established as &quot;the last Sunday of the month of October – the Sunday, that is, which immediately precedes the Feast of All Saints&quot;. 

In his motu proprio &quot;Mysterii Paschalis&quot; of 1969, Pope Paul VI amended the title of the Feast to &quot;Domini Nostri Iesu Christi universorum Regis&quot; (Our Lord Jesus Christ King of the Universe). He also moved it to the new date of the final Sunday of the liturgical year. Through this choice of date &quot;the eschatological importance of this Sunday is made clearer&quot;. The feast was assigned the highest rank of solemnity. The liturgical vestments for the day are white.

In the extraordinary form, as happens with all Sundays whose liturgies are replaced by those of important feasts, the prayers of the Sunday on which the celebration of the feast of Christ the King occurs are used on the ferias (weekdays) of the following week. The Sunday liturgy is thus not totally omitted.

Since 2021, the diocesan-level celebrations of World Youth Day have taken place on the Solemnity of Christ the King.

The most common breviary of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church, published by the Basilian Fathers, contains propers for the &quot;Feast of Christ the King&quot; which is &quot;celebrated on the last Sunday in October or on the fifth Sunday before the Nativity of our Lord.&quot;

=== Moravian Church ===
In the Moravian Church, Reign of Christ Sunday is the feast marking the end of Pentecostide. White is the liturgical colour associated with the Reign of Christ.

=== Lutheran Churches ===
In the Evangelical-Lutheran Church of Sweden and the Church of Finland, this day is referred to as Judgement Sunday, previously highlighting the final judgement, though after the Swedish Lectionary of 1983 the theme of the day was amended to the &quot;Return of Christ&quot;. A distinct season of Kingdomtide is or has been observed by a number of churches on the four Sundays before Advent, either officially or semi-officially.

In the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, this day is referred to as &quot;Christ the King Sunday,&quot; or, alternatively, the &quot;Realm of Christ/Reign of Christ&quot; Sunday, and is observed on the last Sunday of the liturgical year.

=== Anglican Churches ===

In the Church of England, the Feast of Christ the King falls on &quot;the Sunday next before Advent,&quot; when &quot;[t]he year that begins with the hope of the coming Messiah ends with the proclamation of his universal sovereignty.&quot;

In the Episcopal Church (United States), Christ the King Sunday &quot;is unofficially celebrated in some Episcopal parishes, but it is not mentioned in the Episcopal calendar of the church year.&quot; However, the collect for that Sunday, which mentions Jesus as &quot;King of kings and Lord of Lords&quot; indicates an affinity with the feast day, something that has led to its wider celebration within the Episcopal Church.

=== Reformed Churches ===
The Continental Reformed Churches, such as the Christian Reformed Churches, assign the following hymns to be used on the Feast of Christ the King: &quot;Crown Him with Many Crowns&quot;, &quot;Lo! He comes with clouds descending&quot;, and &quot;Rejoice, the Lord Is King&quot;.

In the Presbyterian Churches, such as the Presbyterian Church (USA), at the Feast of Christ the King (Feast of the Reign of Christ) &quot;the church gives thanks and praise for sovereignty of Christ, who is Lord of all creation and is coming again in glory to reign (see Revelation 1:4-8).&quot;

In the United Church of Christ, a Congregationalist denomination, the Feast of Christ the King is the last Sunday of the liturgical season known as the Time of the Church.

=== Methodist Churches ===
The Feast of Christ the King is observed in the Methodist Churches, such as the United Methodist Church, as the last Sunday of the liturgical season of Kingdomtide. The season of Kingdtomtide itself starts on Trinity Sunday and culminates in the Feast of Christ the King. Some Methodist parishes have been dedicated to Christ the King.

===United Protestant Churches===
In United Protestant Churches, such as the United Church of Canada, Uniting Church of Australia, Church of North India, Church of Pakistan and Church of South India, the Feast of Christ the King (Reign of Christ), is observed as the last Lord&#x27;s Day of the liturgical calendar.

<doc id="1325495" wikidata="Q332035" url="?curid=1325495" title="Facundo Cabral">
<text>Facundo Cabral (born Rodolfo Enrique Cabral Camiñas; May 22, 1937 – July 9, 2011) was an Argentine singer and songwriter.

He was best known as the composer of &quot;No soy de aquí ni soy de allá&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;m not from here and not from there&quot;), &quot;Pobrecito mi Patron&quot; (&quot;My Poor Boss&quot;), and many other compositions. His songs have been covered by multiple Spanish language performers such as Jorge Cafrune, Alberto Cortez, Juan Luis Guerra, and Joan Manuel Serrat. Cabral protested military dictatorships in Latin America through activism and art from the 1970s onward, and his music combined mysticism and spirituality with calls for social justice and equality.

After touring the world, Cabral enjoyed popularity in his home country during the early 1980s, when Argentine radio demanded local content after the Falklands War. He was popular throughout Latin America in his lifetime and still enjoys a sizeable posthumous legacy throughout the continent. For his advocacy for peace through his work, Facundo Cabral was named a UNESCO Messenger of Peace in 1996.

== Religious and political views ==
Facundo expressed that his spiritual views were influenced by a variety of figures, including Jesus, Laozi, Zhuang Zhou, Rajneesh, Jiddu Krishnamurti, Gautama Buddha, Schopenhauer, John the Baptist, Francis of Assisi, Gandhi and Mother Teresa. He also had admiration for the writings of Jorge Luis Borges (with whom he engaged in philosophical discussions) and of Walt Whitman.

He used to describe himself as &quot;violently pacifist&quot;, a &quot;first-class homeless person&quot; and a &quot;philosophical anarchist&quot;. On his view of anarchism, Cabral said: &quot;I&#x27;m an Anarchist, which is worse than a Communist. For that reason I have never voted, I have never got involved in politics because politics divides and I separate myself from all that which divides. No one, no politician is going to change our reality.&quot;

==Death==
Cabral was shot and killed during a tour in Guatemala City while en route to La Aurora International Airport on July 9, 2011.

Cabral was with his agent David Llanos and Henry Fariña, who were wounded. He was accompanied by a second vehicle carrying bodyguards, but they couldn&#x27;t protect the singer&#x27;s vehicle, which tried to flee the attackers by driving into a fire station. At least 20 bullet holes were seen in the Range Rover car he was in. The gunmen were in three late-model vehicles, one in front of Cabral&#x27;s car and two to the right and left. One of the attackers&#x27; vehicles was later found abandoned on the road to El Salvador. It was a brown Hyundai Santa Fe with bullet holes and containing bullet-proof vests and an AK-47 magazine. Early investigations indicated that the trajectory of the bullets were from right to left, toward the driver&#x27;s seat, indicating that the bullets were meant for the driver, Cabral&#x27;s Nicaraguan promoter Henry Fariña, possibly because of troubles with organized crime related to drugs. (Fariña was imprisoned for 30 years in 2012 for drug trafficking, organised crime, and money laundering.)

In March 2012, Colombian authorities announced the arrest of Alejandro Jiménez (a.k.a. &quot;El Palidejo&quot;), who is believed to have ordered the murder of Fariña as he was taking Cabral to the airport. In 2016 five men, including Jiménez, were sentenced to prison terms of 50 years or more for the murder.

<text>William Howard Frindall, (3 March 1939 – 30 January 2009) was an English cricket scorer and statistician, who was familiar to cricket followers as a member of the Test Match Special commentary team on BBC radio. He was nicknamed the Bearded Wonder (shortened to Bearders) by Brian Johnston for his ability to research the most obscure cricketing facts in moments, while continuing to keep perfect scorecards and because he had a beard. Angus Fraser described Frindall as &quot;the doyen of cricket scorers&quot; in his obituary in &quot;The Independent&quot;.

==Early life==
Frindall was born in Epsom, Surrey, and named after Victorian journalist William Howard Russell. He was educated at Tadworth county primary school and Reigate Grammar School and studied architecture at the Kingston School of Art.

A schoolmaster introduced Frindall to cricket scoring one rainy sports afternoon when he was a boy. After joining the RAF as a National Serviceman in 1958 (he called it &quot;training in advanced shirking&quot;), and rising to the rank of corporal, he was commissioned as an accountant officer in the secretarial branch in November 1963. Two of his six years&#x27; service were spent at NATO headquarters at Fontainebleau, outside Paris, and on leaving the RAF in 1965 he developed his handlebar moustache into a full beard.

==Cricket player==
Frindall was an enthusiastic cricketer from his early years and played cricket for the RAF. He later played one match for the Hampshire Second XI in 1972, against Gloucestershire&#x27;s Second XI, bowling six wicketless overs for 22 runs, and scoring one run in the second innings before he was caught and bowled. He continued as an effective fast bowler in club cricket for many years, particularly in charity matches, although his batting was somewhat agricultural. He ran a touring team, the Malta Maniacs, and also played for the Elvinos and the Lord&#x27;s Taverners.

==TMS scorer==
He became a freelance statistician in 1966, and took over the scoring for &quot;Test Match Special&quot; on 2 June 1966, at the First Test against West Indies at Old Trafford. He went on to become the longest-serving member of the &quot;TMS&quot; team, covering more than 350 Test matches, which he considered the only &quot;proper&quot; form of the game. 
He replaced the previous scorer, Arthur Wrigley, who had been the BBC scorer from 1934 up to his death in October 1965. Frindall speculatively wrote to the BBC, pointing out that they would need a new scorer, and secured the job. After a trial period, Frindall continued to score for the BBC until his death, watching all 246 Test matches in England from June 1966 to 2008. He covered 377 Tests for the BBC in all, forming a close working relationship with John Arlott and Brian Johnston, providing continuity with later commentators such as Jonathan Agnew. Frindall&#x27;s perfectionism clashed occasionally with Henry Blofeld&#x27;s more effusive – but error-prone – delivery.

Frindall was also known for producing scoring charts for many of his tours with England. He modified the linear scoring system invented by John Atkinson Pendlington and developed by Australian scorer Bill Ferguson into a version that is known as the Frindall system. Frindall met Ferguson in 1953, when he was 14 years old. The concentration needed to maintain such consistently high-quality work was immense, and Frindall believed it was his time in the RAF that prepared him for the task. Writing honed by his training to be an architect meant that each page was beautifully laid out and easy to read. Every scorecard, like the wagon-wheels he produced to show where a batsman scored his runs after playing a significant innings, was a work of art. Frindall&#x27;s work was so meticulously accurate that the commentators would habitually trust his figures if they differed from the official scoreboard.

It was a common boast of Frindall that he was born on the first day of the last &quot;Timeless Test&quot;, between England and South Africa, which became the longest Test ever played (the game was abandoned after nine days&#x27; play spread over 12 days). He last appeared for &quot;Test Match Special&quot; at England&#x27;s Test against India at Mohali in 2008. Given his love of such statistics, it is fitting that his funeral took place on 13 February 2009, the day of the shortest Test; the second Test between England and the West Indies was abandoned after just 10 balls.

==Opinions==
Frindall was known for staunchly defending his beliefs about cricket statistics. When the Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians attempted to revise the status of many 19th century and pre-war matches, which would have produced statistics that are different from the conventional, Frindall was among those who objected to their &quot;rewriting of history&quot;. As a result, until 2022, some ACS statistics were different from those in &quot;Wisden&quot;, which is regarded as the standard. For example, the ACS awarded Jack Hobbs 199 first-class hundreds (as recorded on Cricinfo), while &quot;Wisden&quot;, the generally accepted standard, gave Hobbs his &quot;traditional&quot; total of 197 centuries. Wisden aligned with the ACS in 2022.

More recently, when the International Cricket Council decided to award Test and One Day International status to the matches played for the tsunami benefit and the ICC Super Series between Australia and a Rest of the World team, Frindall, in common with many statisticians and historians, disputed the ruling. As a result, &quot;Playfair&quot; and other publications to which he supplied statistics did not classify those matches as official Tests or ODIs.

==Publications==
His autobiography, &quot;Bearders – My Life in Cricket&quot;, was published by Orion in June 2006. Other works include the &quot;Playfair Cricket Annual&quot;, which he edited for 23 years, from 1986 until his death; the &quot;Wisden Book of Test Cricket&quot;; the &quot;Wisden Book of Cricket Records&quot;; the &quot;Guinness Book of Cricket – Facts and Feats&quot;; and the &#x27;Cricket records&#x27; section of the &quot;Wisden Cricketers&#x27; Almanack&quot;, which he maintained for 22 years. He was also briefly a correspondent for the &quot;Mail on Sunday&quot;.

==Honours and awards==
In 1998, Frindall was made an honorary Doctor of Technology by Staffordshire University, for his contribution to statistics. He was appointed an MBE for services to cricket and broadcasting in the 2004 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours. He received several awards from the Beard Liberation Front, including &quot;Beard of the Year&quot;.

Frindall was the first president of British Blind Sport, a charity co-ordinating sport for the blind and partially sighted.

==Personal life==
Frindall was married three times. He married Maureen Wesson in 1960, and they had two sons and a daughter together. After their divorce in 1970, he was married to Jacqueline Seager in May 1970. After a second divorce in 1980, he married Deborah Brown in 1992; they had a daughter. Away from &quot;TMS&quot; he lived in Wiltshire, latterly at Urchfont near Devizes, and was an accomplished after-dinner speaker, telling tales of the commentary box, which often displayed his excellent powers of mimicry; he could do Arlott and Trueman brilliantly.

==Death==
Frindall died at the Great Western Hospital in Swindon on 29 January 2009, following a short illness after contracting Legionnaires&#x27; disease during a charity cricketing tour of Dubai with the Lord&#x27;s Taverners. He was survived by his third wife, Debbie, who used to deliver his lunch to the commentary box each day, and his four children. His funeral was held at St Michael and All Angels Church, Urchfont on 13 February 2009.

<text>Escapist fiction, also known as escape fiction, escapist literature, or simply escapism, is fiction that provides escapism by immersing readers in a &quot;new world&quot; created by the author. The genre aims to compensate for a real world the reader perceives as arbitrary and unpredictable compared to the clear rules of the constructed &quot;new world&quot;. Typically, an author of escapist fiction offers structure, rationality and resolution to real world problems throughout their medium. The genre facilitates mentalisation; that is, escapist fiction encourages psychological engagement from the reader. Escapist fiction is often contrasted with realism, which confronts the reader with the harsh reality of war, disease, family dysfunction, crime, foreclosure, death, etc. It encompasses a number of different genres within it; any fiction that immerses the reader into a world different from their own is fundamentally escapist fiction. Escapist literature aims to give readers imaginative entertainment rather than to address contemporary issues and provoke serious and critical thoughts.

Historically, the arts, and literature in particular, have been acknowledged for its ability to distract readers from the hardships of reality. During the Great Depression, readers turned to escapist fiction as it provided them a mental escape from the bleakness of the economy during that period of time. Fiction books and novels were an affordable and easy means for readers to escape into another world, so people used escapist fiction to provide them with a temporary psychological escape from the realities of their world.

Labelling a work &quot;escapist fiction&quot; can be to minimise it. Those who defend works described as escapist either assert that they are not escapist—for example, that a science fiction novel&#x27;s satiric aspects address real life—or defend the notion of &quot;escape&quot; as such, not &quot;escapism&quot;.

Escapist fiction does not have a formal literary definition and can variously be used as a synonym for genre fiction, commercial fiction, popular fiction, or formula fiction. Genres that can function as escapist fiction include:
* Bodice rippers/Romance novels
* Fantasy fiction
* Horror fiction
* Pulp fiction
* Science fiction, Utopian and dystopian fiction
* Thrillers, Detective novels, and Spy novels
* Action/Adventure fiction
* Superhero films
* Supernatural fiction
* Soap Opera
*Animation
*Saturday Morning Cartoons
*Movie Theater
*Puppet Show
*Dinner theatre
 *Shakespeare in The Park

*Midnight Movie
*Farce

== Characteristics ==
The concept of individuals using different forms of medium, such as fiction, to &quot;escape&quot; from the limitations and dissatisfaction of everyday life is known as &quot;escapist fiction&quot;. It is because of this that some people may argue that most fiction and the act of reading itself, is a pursuit of escapism.

J. R. R. Tolkien, a linguistic scholar, is one of the essential figures in escapist fiction. He is the author of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, which is a classic example of escapist fiction. He wrote it to illustrate the meaning of his essay &quot;On Fairy-Stories&quot;. He admitted that fairy stories were something of an escape, he believed people should be provided an escape from the world of factories, machine guns and bombs. Though fairy-stories are by no means the only medium of escape, they are one of the more obvious and (to some) outrageous forms of &quot;escapist&quot; literature. The popular titles such as the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series by written by J. K. Rowling, &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot; by C. S. Lewis, Suzanne Collins&#x27; &quot;The Hunger Games,&quot; and Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, are examples of escapist fiction. Each of these novels allow the reader to essentially escape into a fantasy world that is not their own. It can be argued that these novels, and similar novels, add to the understanding that escapist fiction is not a negative thing stating that literary fiction critics misunderstood the term as denial or evasion of real life issues instead of layered and complex way of looking at the world and that escapism and realism are not mutually exclusive.

These novels can provide readers with a moral compass or teach them lessons, they can be interpreted as a medium to represent and overcome an individual&#x27;s personal fears, shortcomings, and, at times the need for this &quot;escape&quot;. The secondary world, or fantastical one, is something that closely mirrors the primary one and would not be successful or satisfying if readers could not imagine it as realistic and relatable. Escapist fiction employs narrative strategies that engage and immerse readers whilst also distancing reader from their world and society. Escapist fiction seeks to engage readers in reflective and inquisitive processes encouraging readers to question and challenge their own cultural and social realities. A key element in escapist fiction is using techniques that encourage readers to enter into a new world whilst dually constructing a position of critical engagement. That is, a position whereby readers are encouraged to think critically and reflect upon contemporary social ideologies; identity, agency, the environment, social constructs, politics etc.

== Context and origin ==
During the Great Depression in the 1930s, people began to turn to escapist fiction because it provided readers with a mental escape from the alarming rates of unemployment and the overall decline of the economy during that period of time. Despite the economic devastation of the Great Depression during this period of time people were granted the opportunity to experience leisure time. Popular culture, and the entertainment and amusement it provided may be considered crucial in maintaining the public&#x27;s well being during the harsh reality of the period. Reading genres such as escapist fiction during this period allowed people to escape from the uncertainties, anxieties and loss of self-esteem resulting from the Great Depression period. Popular culture, in particular escapist fiction as a genre, thrived and evolved during the 1930s unlike other industries. Owing to the unemployment during the depression, people had more free time and sought-after ways to fill their time and escape the bleak reality they faced. Most popular culture and fiction created during the period of 1929 to 1941 did not deal with or contain any explicit references to the harsh realities of the Great Depression as a topic. This further supports this idea that in this context popular culture and fiction were largely utilised as a vehicle to escape the deprived and alienated living conditions characteristic of the period. In the 1950s and 1960s people tended to view the topic of escapism through a socio-political perspective, analysing how the dysfunctions of society trigger peoples need for escape. Reading fiction during the Great Depression was popular, readers searching for escapist literature had a vast array of materials to choose from, such as &quot;pulps&quot;, comic strips, comic books, fiction novels, etc.
The designation of escape in literature, known as escapist fiction, dates back to the 1930s. The word &quot;escapism&quot; was born in the 1930s and grew rapidly in usage. In the 1940s and the 1950s the term escapism in terms of literature was largely criticised. In the 1960s and 1970s the concept of &quot;escape&quot; in literature emerged as a mode of dealing with imperfect existence where the reader could temporarily escape reality. The conceptual idea and intention of escapist literature is to erase difference and to free readers of the intricacies and responsibilities of historical specificity.

== Ideology ==
Fantasy literature is escapist in nature, creating another world where the reader and protagonist escape their familiar surroundings and enter into a different and new environment. Escapist fiction creates these alternate, fantasy worlds to escape the immediate socio-political and economic settings of the real world. The secondary world created in works of escapist fiction is something that closely mirrors the primary one. The secondary world is also a way of understanding and coping with the things we want to escape from in our primary world. This secondary world would not be successful if readers did not see it as plausible, real, and relating to their own world. Escapist fiction, in particular fantasy fiction, does allow a departure from our world in that it frees itself from the restraints of normality and everyday life. Much of escapist fiction is allegorical and utilises features of worldliness in a variety of ways in order to comment on modern life. Escapist fiction often seeks to examine a deeper element of human existence and purpose. Escapist literature tends to confront contemporary issues, in particular moral and political matters, through a moral journey the reader undertakes where they can learn important life lessons in the fictional world. Escapist fiction can provide readers with a rich literature that deals with universal issues of humanity, especially the matters of childhood experience and adolescence. Escapist fiction authors construct alternate worlds in order to comment on our world implicitly through the differences and explicitly in the similarities. The fundamental purpose of escapist fiction is to comment on the real world and explore the moral, social, political and philosophical dilemmas that exist within it. Through confronting contemporary issues, escapist fiction authors aim to shift conventional perspectives and reveal a moral insight. As a genre of fiction that requires a substantial level of immersion into the world of the text, escapist fiction has the potential to greatly influence readers.

== Scholarship and criticism ==
There are many negative connotations attached to escapist fiction. Some literary critics and academics have classified escapist fiction and genres of science-fiction, thriller, mystery, romance and fantasy, as sub-literary and unworthy of being regarded as true literature. Early critics complained that escapist fiction as a literary genre misleads readers in terms of the harsh truths of reality. Early entertainment and literature tended to view escapist fiction as a lower-class phenomenon. Assuming that the alienation, deprivation and restriction of lower-class life caused a desire to escape in these &quot;underprivileged&quot; individuals. These critics deem escapist fiction to be shallow and superficial, with its worth being degraded to simply a source of entertainment. Some literary critics have deemed escapist fiction as frivolous and frequently dismiss it as a literary genre. These people argue that escapist fiction has little value for adolescent socialisation.

On the other hand, some literary critics hold escapist fiction in high regard, expressing it as a genre possessing a thematic depth and ideological complexity that is both appealing to readers and influential. These people argue against the negative connotations associated with escapist fiction. They argue that through encouraging readers to &quot;escape&quot; escapist fiction has the ability to position its readers to be perceptive to didactic and potentially formative ideological assumptions. Those who advocate for escapist fiction as a genre believe it holds a formative value for adolescents as they mature and can therefore offer similar socialising value to readers. For a long time creators and consumers of escapist fiction have been placed (and still are placed) in a position of inferiority, therefore, escapist fiction is an excluded genre from recognition and scholarship. The ideological views presented in escapist fiction are often implicit, that is, representations throughout escapist literature are informed and structured according to the accepted cultural and societal constructions.

== Examples ==
Most genres that belong under the title of popular fiction are considered to be escapist literature, including, romance novels, mystery novels, fantasy novels, horror fiction, science fiction, pulp fiction, thrillers. Popular fiction authors, such as, Agatha Christie, Enid Blyton, Barbara Cartland, Stephen King, J. K. Rowling, J. R. R. Tolkien, and Danielle Steel can be categorised as authors of escapist literature.

=== Common characteristics, techniques and features ===
One of the most well-known canonical examples of escapist literature is Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. This work of escapist fiction describes characters in an entirely new, fictional universe complete with its own history and languages. Tolkien explores the themes of right and wrong, and emphasises the significance of small acts of bravery. These are themes that are prominent in most escapist literature.

Escapist literature aims to create a relatable and believable alternate world, where the inhabitants struggle with dilemmas that the reader may encounter. Escapist fiction contains elements of reality, self-improvement and deep-seated truths, and can explore moral and ethical themes within an entertaining medium. There is an intrinsic need for escape that is embedded within humans to maintain sanity, escapist literature allows a window for readers to view historical and instinctual lessons. Escapist fiction can be a representation for how things ought to be in the world, encouraging readers to understand underlying problems and challenges of the real world within the context of an alternate world.

As a multifaceted literary from containing several genres, escapist fiction contains thematic depth and complex ideologies that seek to persuade the reader to reconsider their views of the world. Escapist fiction uses techniques that seek to encourage readers engagement and fulfilment of &quot;escape&quot; through the use of closely focalised narration. The use of present tense narration is also prevalent in escapist fiction as it invites readers to engage directly with character, story and setting. Narration is a significant feature of escapist fiction as it is imperative for maximum engagement, as such, the displacement of readers into another world affects ideological interpellation and interpretations.

<doc id="1325506" wikidata="Q6561538" url="?curid=1325506" title="Over-the-line">
<text>Over-the-line is a bat-and-ball sport, a game related to baseball and softball. Like those games, it involves a batter, pitcher, and fielders. Because a game requires only three people per team, it is considerably easier to get a good informal game going. The equipment consists of a rope (or lines marked in the sand), an &quot;official&quot; softball bat &amp; an &quot;official&quot; Orange rubber DeBeer softball. No gloves are allowed while fielding in the Men&#x27;s divisions unless 60+ years of age. However, gloves are allowed for the women&#x27;s divisions. Junior (typically 20 years or below) events also allow a glove on defense. A single golf glove may be used when batting. Gameplay, however, is very different. 
The name &quot;over-the-line&quot; is a registered trademark of the Old Mission Beach Athletic Club (OMBAC) of San Diego, California, which organizes an annual tournament that is one of the city&#x27;s largest summer social events. It is also known as OTL (also trademarked by OMBAC). OMBAC allows other organizations to license the trademark for their own events for a nominal fee.
An over-the-line court is normally made up on a beach and comprises a triangle and an open-ended rectangle marked by ropes or lines in the sand. The base (&quot;The Line&quot;) of the triangle is long, and the distance from the line to the opposite point (&quot;Home&quot;) is also . The rectangle is composed of two parallel ropes or lines that extend out indefinitely away from home starting from the two ends of The Line and at a right angle to The Line. The area between the parallel ropes and over The Line is fair territory. Everything other than the triangle and fair territory is foul territory.

Unlike in softball, the batter and pitcher are on the same team. The batter stands at Home. The pitcher stands anywhere in front of The Line, not in the triangle. Fielders (the other team) stand behind The Line, in fair territory. The objective for the batter is to get a hit which is to hit the ball into fair territory without a fielder catching it. A hit may also be made when the fielder who catches the ball crosses over the line (or the line&#x27;s extension) or drops the ball in either fair or foul territory. No bases are physically run, however.

An out is made if (a) the ball is hit into your triangle, (b) a batter gets a strike (swings and completely misses), (c) the defenders catch the ball without crossing over The Line or its extensions, (d) a batter has two fouls (a foul is a ball that lands in foul territory, a pitch taken at or a balk), (e) a player bats out of order, or (f) either the pitcher or batter touches but does not catch a struck ball (if the pitcher or batter catches it, there is a no pitch). Unlike baseball and softball, where the foul lines are in fair territory, the ropes are in foul territory. Three outs end the half-inning, as in regular baseball and softball.

The scoring system is as follows:
# The third hit in an inning scores one run and each subsequent hit scores another run and
# A home run (a ball that lands past the Fielder farthest from The Line, not over, just needs to be past) without it being touched by a Fielder scores a run and the unscored hits that preceded it. The hits are then reset to zero.

== Annual tournament ==

Over-the-line was first played in Mission Beach in San Diego, California, in the 1950s and continues to thrive in the area. It is seen largely as a novelty game in the inland counties (and, debatably, the beach counties as well), but still persists as a physical education activity at local high schools, and most visibly in the practice of an annual tournament held on Fiesta Island. By far the locale&#x27;s most notorious activity, the annual &quot;OMBAC World Championship Over The Line Tournament&quot;, organized by Old Mission Beach Athletic Club, is a prominent event in San Diego&#x27;s beach sports life. The tournament has a history of adult-themed team names, often with variations of the sport&#x27;s equipment — namely bats and balls — that are seen as explicit enough to discourage most youth attendance. As such, the tournament has gained a negative reputation over the years for these hedonistic and sexual overtones. Despite its infamous reputation, however, the game has grown in popularity among the San Diego populace and governing bodies over the years, even surpassing about 60,000 spectators over the two July weekends the annual tournament was hosted in 2011. To help highlight the sport rather than the spectacle and encourage more family-friendly participation, OMBAC has made strides to cut back on these and some of the tournament&#x27;s other, more offensive, elements by de-emphasizing slogans such as &quot;beer, babes, and bats on the beach.&quot;

The annual World Championships now gathers more than 1200 teams from all over the world separated into multiple divisions. Players range in age from 18 to 80 years old and are split by gender. In an effort to help further the sport, an OTL Players Association was established several years ago. They currently host several additional tournaments each year.

<doc id="1325521" wikidata="Q1677861" url="?curid=1325521" title="Jacques-François Ancelot">
<text>Jacques-Arsène-Polycarpe-François Ancelot (9 January 1794 – 7 September 1854) was a French dramatist and litterateur.

==Biography==
Born in Le Havre, Ancelot became a clerk in the admiralty, and retained his position until the Revolution of 1830. In 1816 his play &quot;Warwick&quot; was accepted by the Théâtre Français, but never produced, and three years later a five-act tragedy, &quot;Louis IX&quot;, was staged. Three editions of the play were speedily exhausted; it had a run of fifty representations, and brought him a pension of 2000 francs from Louis XVIII. His next work, &quot;Le Maire du palais&quot;, was played in 1825 with less success; but for it he received the cross of the Légion d&#x27;honneur. In 1824 he produced &quot;Fiesque&quot;, a clever adaptation of Schiller&#x27;s &quot;Fiesco&quot;. In 1828 appeared &quot;Olga, ou l&#x27;orpheline russe&quot;, the plot of which had been inspired by a voyage he made to Russia in 1826. About the same period he produced in succession &quot;Marie de Brabant&quot; (1825), a poem in six cantos; &quot;L&#x27;Homme du monde&quot; (1827), a novel in four volumes, afterwards dramatized with success; and in 1829 a play, &quot;Elisabeth d&#x27;Angleterre&quot;.

By the Revolution of July 1830 he lost at once his royal pension and his office as librarian at Meudon; and he was chiefly employed during the next ten years in writing vaudevilles and light dramas and comedies. His play &quot;Têtes Rondes et Cavaliers&quot;, co-authored with Joseph Xavier Saintine, was premiered at the Théâtre du Vaudeville in Paris on 25 September 1833; it also formed the basis for the libretto of the 1835 opera &quot;I Puritani&quot;, by Vincenzo Bellini. A tragedy, &quot;Maria Padilla&quot; (1838), gained him admission to the Académie française in 1841. Ancelot was sent by the French government in 1849 to Turin, Florence, Brussels and other capitals, to negotiate on the subject of international copyright; and the treaties which were concluded soon after were the result, in a great measure, of his tact and intelligence.

Ancelot&#x27;s wife, Marguerite, was a noted painter, writer and also a playwright, and hosted an important literary salon in Paris from 1822 to 1866.

<text>China Petroleum and Chemical Corporation, or Sinopec Group, is a Chinese oil and gas enterprise based in Chaoyang District, Beijing. The SASAC administers China Petroleum and Chemical Corporation for the benefit of State Council of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. China Petroleum and Chemical Corporation operates a publicly traded subsidiary, called Sinopec, listed in Hong Kong and Shanghai stock exchanges. China Petroleum and Chemical Corporation is the world&#x27;s largest oil refining conglomerate, state owned enterprise, and second highest revenue company in the world behind Walmart.

==History==
=== Domestic ===

In 1994, Sinopec was among the large industrial state-owned enterprises of China which were selected for a pilot program of restructuring as state holding companies, thereby enabling partial public listings of its subsidiaries&#x27; assets.

Sinopec Limited was established as a joint stock entity under the China Petrochemical Corporation Group (Sinopec Group) in February 2000. The company was simultaneously listed in Hong Kong, New York, and London in October 2000. The IPO raised $3.5 billion. A Shanghai listing was completed in June 2001. Prior to its operation as a company Sinopec&#x27;s assets came from the Ministry of Petroleum Industry and the Ministry of Chemical Industry which partially privatized in the 1980s. Given its legacy asset base from Sinopec Group, analysts have categorized it as a more downstream oil player than PetroChina. However, since 1998 Sinopec has expanded into upstream endeavors. This expansion began with a state mandated asset swap with China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) which gave some of Sinopec&#x27;s refineries to CNPC in return for Sinopec acquiring some of CNPC&#x27;s upstream assets. 

China entered the WTO in 2001 which some experts claim put additional pressure on their domestic oil industry to be efficient. In the lead up to going public, Sinopec cut over 200,000 jobs from its roster.

BP partnered with Sinopec, in 2005, to build SECCO an ethylene derivatives plant with an initial investment of $2.7 billion. It is located in the Shanghai Chemical Industry Park, and generates over 3.2 million tons of petrochemical products annually. In 2017, Sinopec bought out the remainder of BP&#x27;s stake in SECCO through its Gaoqiao subsidiary for $1.68 billion. Gaoqiao&#x27;s operations predate the creation of Sinopec and it operates 75 plants for producing finished petroleum products such as fuels, oils, organic compounds. Ineos bought out half of Sinopec&#x27;s share of SECCO in 2022 as part of a broader partnership deal.

Sinopec operates the Jiujang Petrochemical Complex which was originally constructed in 1975 and has received a series of improvements over time. The refinery processes 8 million tonnes of crude oil per year.Xi Jinping visited the refinery, in 2023, when the company highlighted the importance of Socialism with Chinese characteristics and presented awards.

Sinopec posted a 6.8% operating margin for the 2006 financial year. Profit was limited in part by government price controls on downstream petrochemical products. The National Development and Reform Commission sets gasoline and diesel prices and the Ministry of Finance collects windfall tax on upstream profits. At the beginning of 2006, Chinese retail gasoline and diesel sales were not profitable for Sinopec and sales were hurting the company&#x27;s financials. To pressure the NDRC, Sinopec and CNPC cut production causing long lines at the pump. This lead to NDRC approving a 15% increase in the price at the pump. To offset losses from the price controls, the state gave Sinopec $1.1 billion in subsidy during 2005 and $647 million in 2006. This finance example demonstrates of Sinopec&#x27;s implementation of policy adjusted profit. Chinese methods on how to articulate, quantify, and report the sometimes conflicting interests of profit and political policy have evolved during over time. Some commentators on the Shanghai Stock Market, where Sinopec trades, call these methods &quot;valuation with Chinese characteristics&quot;. Sinopec demonstrated the &quot;one profit, five rates&quot; method in 2023. This method calls for assessing the company&#x27;s performance with profit, &quot;asset-liability ratio, return on equity, operating cash ratio, overall labor productivity, and R&amp;D investment intensity&quot;.

In February 2007, Saudi Aramco and Exxon signed a deal with Sinopec to revamp the Fujian oil refinery and triple its capacity to by 2009. The Saudi Aramco investment is strategically aligned because Saudi Aramco produces a heavier crude oil which is not preferable for other Chinese refining facilities. Aramco, Exxon and Sinopec also signed contracts for a fuel marketing venture that will manage 750 service stations and a network of terminals in Fujian province. Their subsidiaries also expanded cooperation in Tianjin the following year. They invested over $3 billion from 2008 to 2019 expanding the ethylene production capacity multiple times and finally achieving 1.3 million tons per year of production. In Fujian, Sinopec also operates the Gulei Industrial Park. It began as a joint venture with a group of Taiwanese companies operating as Dynamic Ever Investments in 2015. The venture took $4 billion of investment and has a production capacity of 1 million tonnes of ethylene per year. At the time of its approval it was the only Taiwanese petrochemical joint venture in mainland China. It was approved by the Fujian branch of the NDRC which owns a 25% stake in the project. The plant began producing downstream chemicals in 2018 and became fully online in 2021. Phase two began, in 2024, when Saudi Aramco made an additional $9.8 billion investment in the facilities. These expansions are scheduled to be fully operational in 2030. 

Sinopec completed construction of a new ethylene plant in Wuhan at the end of 2012. The construction of this plant was done as a joint venture with the South Korean SK Group. This facility was planned in alignment with the National Development and Reform Commission&#x27;s goal of producing more ethylene domestically in order to rely less heavily on foreign imports. It will provide 800,000 tons/year which is a significant step towards the NDRC&#x27;s 2015 goal of raising domestic production by 7.5 millions tons/year.

In March 2013, Sinopec agreed to pay $1.5 billion for its parent company&#x27;s overseas oil and gas-producing assets.

Zhejiang Oil Products Company was originally founded in 1950, but began operating under Sinopec in 1998. It is Sinopec&#x27;s highest selling oil refinery and one of the most important companies in Zhejiang. Sinopec has continuously improved the refining capacity and it ranks as one of the largest refineries in the world. The refinery prioritizes output of non-fuel chemicals at a notably higher rate than comparable refineries. This large scale production, particularly of aromatic compounds hurt foreign competitors. This attracted further investment in China from Saudi Aramco which acquired a 10% stake in Zhejiang Oil Products Company in 2023.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Sinopec reported a loss of 23 billion yuan in the January to June time frame of 2020. In 2021, they reported a 22% increase in revenue as the demand for fuel and oil slowly returned to normal. In 2022, the company reported a 25% net income increase in the first quarter. Diesel output was increased by almost 10% that year and the gasoline production saw only a 0.7% increase.

In 2021, Sinopec began a partnership with NIO, when they unveiled that a NIO Power Swap Station 2.9 would be put into the Sinopec Chaoying Station in Beijing. Additionally, the partnership was to include cooperation between the two companies in new materials, smart EV technology, Battery-as-a-Service (BaaS), construction of recreational facilities, as well as the purchase of vehicles.

China&#x27;s imports of U.S. natural gas will more than double. In March 2022, a memorandum of understanding was signed between Sinopec and Aramco to strengthen the already existing ties between the companies and to improve their downstream operations.

The Hainan Baling Chemical New Material Company, a Sinopec subsidiary in Hainan, opened a one million tonne per year Styrene-butadiene (SBC) plant in 2023. This new facility made Sinopec the largest producer of SBC in the world at the time.

Sinopec began operating the deepest oil well in Asia in 2023. As part of Project Deep Earth the drill went 9432m below Xinjiang.

Sinopec and BP have worked together since Sinopec formed. Their joint venture in Zhejiang had 2024 gas stations in 2021. They signed a memorandum of strategic cooperation with BP at the Davos Economic Forum in 2024. Sinopec has set a goal of building 5000 new EV charging stations by 2025 and plans to cooperate with BP on achieving that goal. These and other of Sinopec&#x27;s environmental goals are aligned with the Fourteenth five-year plan.

=== International ===

Sinopec has demonstrated a willingness, characteristic Chinese national oil companies, to invest in foreign, often risky, infrastructure. These firms work in concert with the Chinese state owned financial sector via direct low cost financing and indirect infrastructure agreements between foreign nations and Chinese banks. Several experts claim that the role of direct financing support is not as important as indirect support. Large foreign purchases are particularly notable in the Chinese context because they require approval by the National Development and Reform Commission and the State Council. Sinopec made failed attempts to acquire Iranian oil reserves in 2001 and Kazakh reserves in 2003. In subsequent years, Sinopec relied more heavily on off-taker agreements to gain access to foreign markets. The 2007–2008 financial crisis made a large impact on Chinese foreign policy and Chinese oil companies put a higher priority on mergers and acquisitions in the following years.

According to the OECD, foreign oil ventures are an attractive investment for Chinese national oil companies because China is a large importer of oil and wants to control its supply chain. Some Chinese observes agree with this assessment and highlight Sinopec&#x27;s 2005 goal of importing 15 million tons of crude oil for refinement in China. China&#x27;s Go Out policy explicitly stated, in 2001, that Sinopec should &quot;make effective use of overseas resources, build the overseas oil and gas supply bases and diversify the oil imports&quot;. This was revised in 2006 to &quot;broaden international oil and gas cooperation&quot;. According to the company, in 2022, foreign operations were staffed 74% by local workers rather than Chinese employees.

Sinopec began its partnership with Iran in 2001, and signed a 30 year deal to invest $70 billion in the development of Yadavaran Field in 2004. Contract negotiation for this program took three years such that technical work and funding did not actually begin until 2007. The US pressured China to block the investment due to sanctions, but Iran claims that pressure did not delay the deal. Iran expressed pleasure with the deal and stated the goal of replacing Japan with China as the primary exporter of Iranian oil. There is little agreement about the exact amount of oil and gas available through the Yadavaran project, but all claim that it is a large oil field by global standards. The first phase of drilling was completed in 2012 and production continued to expand. Sinopec claims to have ceased buying this oil due to US sanctions in 2019.

Sinopec established its first drilling rig in Saudi Arabia in 2000. In 2004, Sinopec began exploring in Saudi Arabia.

Unipec, a subsidiary of Sinopec, signed a contract with French oil company Total Gabon in February 2002. Under the contract China, for the first time, bought Gabonese crude oil. During his African visit, in 2004, Chinese President Hu Jintao signed a series of bilateral trade accords with his Gabonese counterpart Omar Bongo, including a &quot;memorandum of agreement aimed at showing the parties&#x27; desire to develop exploration, exploitation, refining and export activities of oil products&quot;. Three onshore fields were to be explored. One of the three blocks, LT2000, is some southeast of Gabon&#x27;s economic hub, Port Gentil, which lies south of the capital, Libreville, on the Atlantic coast. The other two — DR200 and GT2000 - are around northeast of Port Gentil, according to the Gabonese oil ministry. In 2013 and 2014 Sinopec and the Gabonese government had significant disputes over licensing and fees. The Gabonese government nationalized one of the oilfields that Sinopec was previously licensed to extract from. Ultimately negotiations between the parties resulted in new leases for Sinopec&#x27;s further extraction.

In 2004, the Export–Import Bank of China signed a $2 billion loan with Angola to finance infrastructure projects by Chinese companies. This led to the Angolan government blocking a deal between Shell and India&#x27;s Oil and Natural Gas Corporation in favor of a deal with Sinopec.

In 2005, Sinopec and CNPC jointly purchased EnCana an Ecuadorian Petrochemical company for $1.42 billion. The purchase gave the joint venture, called Andes Petroleum Company, access to over 62,000 barrels per day of crude and the OCP pipeline which can pump 450,000 barrels per day. It was the largest petrochemical deal in Ecuadorian history. Beginning in 2012, Chinese banks began large financing agreements with Ecuador to pre-pay for oil procured via Andes Petroleum. Ecuador conducted major oil industry reforms in 2007 and 2010 which promoted many international oil companies to exit the Ecuadorian market. Sinopec, on the other hand, remained. As part of these reforms, Ecuador required that local labor be used for over 90% of unskilled and administrative positions. This put an end to further disputes about local job creation. International observers note that Andes Petroleum&#x27;s operations were among the most successful in Ecuador through 2014. This success prompted an expansion of its operations. The company has generally had better relations with the local population than EnCana did. Most of the planned expansions were halted in 2019 when opposition from environmental activists and small indigenous tribes prompted Ecuadorian courts to find that the tribes had not been properly consulted.

Sinopec is a partner in Petrodar Operating Company Ltd., a consortium whose partners also include China National Petroleum Corporation and Sudapet (the Sudanese state-owned oil company), among others. In 2005, Petrodar commenced production of oil in blocks 3 and 7 in South-east Sudan and transported them via its new pipeline. Petrodar&#x27;s operations represent a major increase in overall Sudanese oil production. Sinopec is also looking into other companies such as ERHC Energy which has multiple oil block assets in the Joint Development Zone. When South Sudan seceded it took most of Sudan&#x27;s oil reserves with it. The Petrodas pipeline is used to transport South Sudan&#x27;s oil for export in Sudan. In 2024, fighting in the vicinity of Singa, Sudan halted the flow.

In 2006, Sinopec began operations in Russia with a Rosneft partnership. The companies invested in Sakhalin-III and oil was first drilled in 2006. Rosneft expanded its cooperation with Sinopec in a joint venture called Udmurtneft. They acquired access to 551 million barrels of proven reserves and facilities capable of producing 120,000 barrels per day. The entirety of the deal was financed by Sinopec, but the total price was not disclosed. The sellers claimed offers were $4 billion.
In 2007, in eastern Ethiopia&#x27;s Ogaden Desert, a raid by an ethnic Somali rebel group on a Sinopec drilling site left 74 dead including 9 Chinese oil workers, and 7 kidnapped. The rebels, the Ogaden National Liberation Front (ONLF), later released the seven abductees and warned foreign companies against working in the area. Sinopec said it had no plans to pull out of the resource-rich region despite the attack. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Liu Jianchao says that China strongly condemns the violent attack carried out by Somalian insurgents on the premises of the oil company Sinopec in Ethiopia.

In 2008, Sinopec bought Tanganyika Oil for $2 billion giving Sinopec access to its Syrian oil fields. These fields were reported to have over a billion barrels of crude reserves and a trillion cubic feet of natural gas reserve. However, the Syrian investments became significantly less valuable in 2012 when the Syrian civil war began. The turmoil forced Sinopec to stop regular operations in Syria. The company negotiated with several parties in Syria on multiple occasions in an attempt to restart operations.

Sinopec also began investing in Australia in 2008 with its $594 million purchase of a 60% stake in AED Oil. AED was heavily indebted at the time of the purchase in part due to the Puffin oil fields producing less than expected. Sinopec took over operation of these fields after the sale.

In 2009, Sinopec acquired Addax Petroleum Corp for $7.24 billion. This was the largest foreign purchase by a Chinese company. Addax was producing an average of 136,500 barrels per day. Addax was based in Geneva at the time, but the Geneva office was closed in 2017 after Sinopec agreed to pay $31.8 million to settle a Swiss bribery investigation of their operations in Nigeria. Sinopec claimed the office closure was due to low oil prices. The alleged bribes stemmed from a tax dispute between Sinopec Addax and the Nigerian government. Both sides claimed they had not received their fair share of benefits. The dispute was settled in 2015. Addax&#x27;s resources were concentrated in West Africa and Kurdistan. Sinopec&#x27;s assumption of the agreements with the Kurds created difficulty in forming new agreements with the Iraqi government because Iraq has a long standing policy against dealing with anyone who makes agreements with the Kurds. However these issues did not spread to other Chinese energy companies.

On 13 April 2010 the company announced acquisition of Conoco Phillips&#x27;s 9% stake in the Canadian oil sand firms, Syncrude, for $4.65bn. While largely welcomed by industry, Sinopec&#x27;s Syncrude stake has raised concerns about the influence the Chinese government may try to exert on Canadian policy makers. The following year, Sinopec took over Daylight Energy for C$2.2 billion ($2.1 billion). Daylight was then renamed Sinopec Daylight Energy Ltd.. The OECD and Chinese observers note Sinopec&#x27;s attraction to the Syncrude deal is partly explained by a desire to acquire technical knowledge on oil sands extraction which can be used to boost domestic oil production.

Sinopec invested $7.1 billion in Repsol Brazil to begin a new partnership in 2010. Chinese observers note that part of Sinopec&#x27;s motivation for the deal was to bring deep water drilling expertise to China. In 2011, Sinopec additionally invested $5.2 billion for a 30 percent stake in the Brazilian unit of Galp Energia SGPS SA which owns the rights to biggest discovered oil reserve in the western hemisphere since 1976. This brought the total investment of Chinese energy companies in foreign oil assets for the year to $16 billion.

Sinopec partnered with Chevron Corporation on a deep water drilling operation in Indonesdia in 2011. The project is located in the Kutai Basin and has access to 15 million barrels of crude oil reserve and 700 billion cubic feet of natural gas. The deal closed with Sinopec getting an 18% stake for $680 million. This project aligned with China&#x27;s goal of doubling gas&#x27; share of energy production during the 2009-2015 period.

Unipec first became involved in Ghana in December 2011 when Ghana National Petroleum Corporation agreed to supply 13,000 barrels of oil per day for the following 15 years in return for the Master Facility Agreement. The MFA was a $3 billion six year loan from CDB which Ghanaian President Mills and Hu-Jintao directly negotiated on. The MFA also required Ghana to spend most of the funds on projects constructed by Chinese contractors. Unipec was awarded the first $750 million of these funds to build the Atuabo Gas Plant. In 2013, Unipec halted work on the project to pressure Ghana into making amendments to the MFA that CDB had requested. By 2014, Ghana had only received $600 million of the promised MFA funds.

On 31 October 2011 Sinopec Addax acquired Shell Oil Company&#x27;s 80% share of an exploration firm called Pecten that explores and drills in various offshore locations including the oil basin near Douala, Cameroon in cooperation with TotalEnergies.

BP and Sinopec was expanded on an existing base of joint ventures via new bunker fuel projects in 2015. Bunker fuel was then delivered to ports in Singapore, China, and Europe in 2020.

Sinopec Addax made a $1.5 billion investment in North Sea drilling operations in 2012. The investment was rebranded multiple times. Originally, the deal was with Talisman Energy and Sinopec exited this investment after a dispute with Repsol was settled for $2.1 billion. The dispute began in 2015 over amounts paid by Sinopec and was settled in 2023.

In 2013, company sold a 30 percent stake of an oil and gas block in Myanmar to Taiwan&#x27;s CPC Corp. This was followed by Sinopec&#x27;s acquisition of a 33% stake in Apache Corporation&#x27;s oil and gas business in Egypt for $3.1 billion.

In June 2013, Sinopec agreed to acquire Marathon Oil Corp&#x27;s Angolan offshore oil and gas field for $1.52 billion. As of at least 2023, Sinopec is a part minority owner of several offshore projects via Sinopec&#x27;s half ownership of a joint venture with the private company Sonangol Sinopec International. Sinopec is also a part owner of the joint venture POLY-GCL Petroleum, which as of 2023 is developing a $4 billion natural gas project in Ethiopia, which will include a pipeline to the Djiboutian coast and an export terminal. According to David H. Shinn and academic Joshua Eisenman, the Ethiopian project underscore China&#x27;s commitment to expanding its import of liquified natural gas from African countries.

In November 2021, U.S. producer Venture Global LNG signed a twenty-year contract with Sinopec to supply liquefied natural gas (LNG). In January 2022 they offered to re-sell LNG to take advantage of high Asian spot prices.

Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine the company continued doing business in Russia. For this reason Ukraine listed Sinopec as an International Sponsors of War. Unipec, a subsidiary of Sinopec, is an intermediary for banned Russian oil.

In April 2023, an agreement was signed between Sinopec and QatarEnergy, making Sinopec the first Asian buyer to participate in the eastern expansion of Qatar&#x27;s North Field liquefied natural gas project, with a 5% stake in an 8 million tonnes per year LNG train. The contract has a 27-year term making it the longest ever purchase agreement for LNG.

At the end of June 2023, Sinopec Overseas Investment Holding was established as a vehicle for investment, construction and operation of overseas refineries. Overseas investments at the time amount to 400,000 barrels per day at the Yasref refinery, as well as the $10 billion Amur Gas Chemical Complex in East Siberia.

In September 2023, Sinopec used a tender to purchase 30 cargoes of LNG from more than 10 suppliers for additional supply to begin in October 2023. This additional supply helped China during the winter months as well as offset the lacking supply from Venture Global.

On 17 October 2023, an equity agreement was signed between Sinopec and KazMunayGas JSC for a 30% stake in a $7.7bn polyethylene project in Kazakhstan, which is expected to start construction in the second half of 2024.

In 2023, Sinopec was approved to invest $4.5 billion in refinery construction at Hambantota International Port, Sri Lanka.

== Governance ==
Sinopec is one of the &quot;core&quot; central SOEs overseen by SASAC.

The chairman of China Petroleum and Chemical Corporation, like all Chinese National Oil Companies, is a vice minister. This is a political appointment set by the Ministry of Personnel. This means that the post is always given to high ranking communist party members as a reward for career achievement in the industry. Due to the high ranking nature of China Petroleum and Chemical Corporation&#x27;s leaders in the communist party, the party does not have total control over the company and the company can exert influence on the government to get support in financing, international agreements, and pricing. For example, even though the state owns China Petroleum and Chemical Corporation, the company did not pay the state any dividends until 2008. China Petroleum and Chemical Corporation also appoints a member to the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. Chinese officials have seen some of Sinopec&#x27;s investments as too politically risky. The Iran and Sudan oil partnerships in particular led to regulatory change by State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council to hold Sinopec&#x27;s leaders personally responsible if risky investments cost the government financially.
Sinopec is governed by a Board of directors. The members are nominated by a committee including the chairman of the board and then board makes decisions on these nominations. The board has highlighted its achievement on diversity, including gender diversity, in its annual report. The report highlights that 10% of the members of Board of Directors are female and 31% of the employees are female. Sinopec&#x27;s audits, like other publicly traded Chinese firms, are not subject to independent oversight.

==Environmental and safety record==

In 2004, Sinopec prospected for oil in the 1,550 square kilometers of Loango National Park in southern Gabon and encountered criticism for what domestic and foreign environmental critics said were poor and damaging methods. Primatology professor Christophe Boesch of the US-based environmental organization, the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), criticized the use of dynamite and heavy machinery in exploration and road construction by Sinopec through park, noting that it might drive native gorillas deeper into the jungle, where they would be outside legal restrictions on hunting. Gabonese law states that industries can extract oil from national parks, but must rehabilitate them to the prior condition. Boesch, and other international experts, have suggested that Sinopec use other methods such as horizontal drilling to minimize its environmental footprint. Sinopec&#x27;s activities in Gabon&#x27;s national parks were suspended in September 2006, by the Gabonese national parks council. In 2007, Sinopec redid its earlier environmental study, this time in conjunction with the Gabonese environmentalist group Enviropass and the World Wildlife Foundation, winning high marks from Gabonese, Western, and Chinese conservation experts. Shortly thereafter, Sinopec resumed production with more environmentally friendly methods.

On 21 December 2006, gas started leaking during the drilling of a test well by the Sinopec Southern Prospecting and Development Branch in Quingxi. 12,380 people were evacuated after the leakage occurred. It took at least three attempts and two weeks for the company to seal the leak.

China&#x27;s top environmental watchdog warned Sinopec in 2007 to stop operations at one of its oil fields due to chronic river pollution. Zhongyuan Oilfields Petrochemical Company, a unit of Sinopec, had failed to meet waste water treatment requirements and had been ordered to pay a pollution fine and operations had to be halted, according to the State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA).

Guangdong Provincial Environment Bureau (GPEB) had also issued a red sign warning to 19 companies, including Sinopec Guangzhou, in February 2008. By GPEB&#x27;s standard, the companies that have involved in excessive emissions or caused serious environmental pollution accidents will be given the red sign warning and will be placed under strict supervision.

The former head of the companies&#x27; board of directors Chen Tonghai was sentenced to death in July 2009 after being accused of corruption. He had been relieved of his post in 2007.

An oil pipeline explosion on Friday, 22 November 2013, in Qingdao, Shandong province killed at least 62 people, injuring 136, and displacing hundreds more after oil previously leaking onto a street during the day ignited.

== Renewable energy ==
As of 2021 Sinopec was the largest supplier of geothermal energy in China. Sinopec plans to expand this with the goal of creating what their leadership calls &quot;smogless cities&quot;.

Sinopec has developed a megatonnes carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) project in China. It consists of two parts, the Sinopec Qilu carbon capture and the Shengli Oil Field shifting and storage. The project has been operational since January 2022. Sinopec has partnered with other firms for additional research and development CCUS projects.

By 2021, Sinopec was already the largest Chinese producer of grey hydrogen which is hydrogen fuel produced via petrochemical processing without recapturing the carbon. In 2023, Sinopec constructed its first solar powered green hydrogen facility in Xinjiang which plans to produce annually 20,000 tonnes be transported to and consumed by Sinopec&#x27;s Tahe refinery. Sinopec&#x27;s Demonstration Project of Hydrogen Transmission Pipeline from Ulanqab to Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region will connect additional grey, blue, and green hydrogen projects to Beijing by building a pipeline transportation network from Inner Mongolia to Beijing. Sinopec claims a lack of transportation infrastructure is one of the main barriers to hydrogen adoption. One such example is a 20,000 tonne per year green hydrogen wind farm built outside Ordos City in 2023.

== Research Institutions ==
Sinopec operates several research institutions. It has operated the Research Institute for Petroleum Processing (RIPP) since before its IPO. The RIPP began operation in 1956 and continues to create new patents which Sinopec can leverage in its operations.

<doc id="1325535" wikidata="Q1186372" url="?curid=1325535" title="John W. Henry">
<text>John William Henry II (born September 13, 1949) is an American businessman and the founder of John W. Henry &amp; Company, an investment management firm. He is the principal owner of Liverpool Football Club, the Boston Red Sox, the Pittsburgh Penguins, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, and co-owner of RFK Racing. As of October 2024, &quot;Forbes&quot; estimated his net worth to be US$6 billion.

==Early life and education==
Henry was born to John William Henry Sr. and Lois Henry (née Osborne) on September 13, 1949, in Quincy, Illinois. His parents were soybean farmers, and he split his time growing up between Illinois and Arkansas. 

At age 15, his asthmatic condition prompted his family to move to Apple Valley, California, where Henry attended and graduated from Victor Valley High School in Victorville, California. 

Henry then attended but did not graduate from four separate colleges and universities, Victor Valley College, and then University of California, Riverside, University of California, Irvine, and UCLA, where he majored in philosophy. 

He attributes not graduating to the time he spent performing and touring with two bands, Elysian Fields and Hillary.

==Career==
Henry started trading corn and soybean futures to learn the basics of hedging the price risk of holding an inventory of these commodities, whether in storage or out in the field. In 1976, a commodities broker at Reynolds Securities asked him to advise other farmers, but he declined. After spending a summer in Norway with his first wife, Mai, Henry developed a mechanical trend following method for managing a futures trading account. He tested his trend-reversal method—which was never out of the market but always held a position (either long or short) in every one of the markets in the account&#x27;s &quot;basket&quot; of commodities—&quot;using his own money,&quot; according to his marketing materials from 1983. 

When that test proved successful, he founded John W. Henry &amp; Company in 1981, opened a small office across the street from the airport in Irvine, California, and began marketing his management to the largest commodity brokerage firms in America. That proved so successful by 1983 that he moved to considerably larger quarters at Fashion Island in Newport Beach. In 1989, Henry moved to Westport, Connecticut. Two years later, Henry established a second office in Boca Raton.

===JWH===
JWH was established in 1981 and began taking retail clients in 1982. The firm&#x27;s management methods make mechanical, non-discretionary trading decisions in response to systematic determinations of reversals in each market&#x27;s direction, with the explicit intention of precluding not only human emotion, but also any subjective evaluation of factors outside of price behavior, such as the fundamentals, to trigger each decision to be long or short each market, or not.

In March 2006, &quot;Boston&quot; magazine estimated Henry&#x27;s net worth at $1.1 billion, but also reported that his firm had experienced recent difficulties.

On November 9, 2012, the firm announced that it would stop managing clients&#x27; money by December 31, 2012, and Henry confirmed that total assets under the firm&#x27;s management had fallen from $2.5 billion in 2006 to less than $100 million as of late 2012.

===Sports ownership===
Henry grew up a fan of the St. Louis Cardinals, especially their star Stan Musial. After acquiring his fortune, his first foray into professional sports was in purchasing a Minor League Baseball team, the Tucson Toros of the Pacific Coast League, in 1989. He was also one of the founders of the Senior Professional Baseball Association, a winter league in Florida composed of retired major league players.

Henry co-owned the winning team in the 1989–90 season, the West Palm Beach Tropics, managed by Dick Williams, former manager of the Boston Red Sox&#x27;s 1967 team, known as the &quot;Impossible Dream&quot; team.

In 1990, Henry sold his interest in the team, and the league went out of business the following year. The same year, he negotiated to purchase the Orlando Magic, a National Basketball Association team. He also was briefly the lead general for the Colorado Rockies, a Major League Baseball expansion team, and headed a group attempting to acquire the National Hockey League&#x27;s expansion team in Florida, which was ultimately awarded to Phil and Tony Esposito, who create the Tampa Bay Lightning. Henry subsequently negotiated to buy the Miami Heat and later the New Jersey Nets.

Henry entered Major League Baseball with his purchase of a small interest in the New York Yankees in 1991. Henry became the sole owner of the Florida Marlins in 1999, purchasing the club from Wayne Huizenga for a reported $158 million. In January 2002, Henry sold the Marlins in a multi-franchise deal to Jeffrey Loria, then owner of the Montreal Expos, which is now the Washington Nationals.

====Fenway Sports Group====
In 2001, Henry partnered with Tom Werner, The New York Times Company, and other investors to found New England Sports Ventures (NESV) in a successful bid to buy the Boston Red Sox from Yawkey Trust headed by John Harrington. Henry became principal owner of the Red Sox, with Werner as chairman. 

The company has since become majority owner of English Premier League club Liverpool F.C., the Pittsburgh Penguins, the New England Sports Network, Fenway Park, Fenway Sports Management, and other assets.

In 2009, the company made its first foray into European sports with an unsuccessful bid for the French Ligue 1 club Olympique de Marseille.

NESV changed its name to Fenway Sports Group in March 2011.

====Boston Red Sox====

Henry canceled the previous owners&#x27; plans to demolish Fenway Park and build a new stadium next door. Instead, Henry renovated Fenway—among other things, adding seats over the Green Monster—enabling the park to celebrate its centennial in 2012. 

Henry and Werner assembled a front-office team headed by Larry Lucchino with the goal of &quot;breaking the Curse of the Bambino.&quot; He also hired baseball sabermetrics pioneer Bill James, whose work became widely known after the 2003 publication of &quot;&quot;. Henry accomplished his goal in the 2004 World Series, defeating his former childhood favorite Cardinals. The team won the 2007 World Series against a franchise with which Henry had pre-expansion involvement, the Rockies, and the 2018 World Series against the Dodgers. The Sox beat the Cardinals again in the 2013 World Series. 

In August 2017, Henry said the team would lead a campaign to change the name of Yawkey Way, a section of Boston where Fenway Park is located. The Red Sox had been the last team in Major League Baseball to integrate, and Henry said, &quot;I am still haunted by what went on here a long time before we arrived.&quot; The change was approved by the City of Boston in April 2018, and the name reverted to Jersey Street in May 2018.

====Liverpool Football Club====
In October 2010 the Fenway Sports Group took over Liverpool F.C. The UEFA Financial Fair Play Regulations may have been a factor in the decision. The previous owners, Tom Hicks and George N. Gillett, Jr., had become extremely unpopular among Liverpool fans for their failure to deliver on the promise that no debt would be placed onto the club, and the proposal of Liverpool leaving Anfield as disrespectful treatment of its manager and front office and for their allegedly misleading statements about planned and past investment in players. 

After losing around £154 million on the pressured sale of their debt-ridden club, Hicks and Gillett announced that they would sue co-owners and creditors for at least $1.6 billion for the &quot;extraordinary swindle&quot; they suffered. In January 2013, Hicks and Gillett had lost a Court of Appeal case and agreed to drop the suit.

On February 26, 2012, Liverpool won the 2012 Football League Cup Final at Wembley Stadium, beating Cardiff City 3–2 on penalties after the game finished 1–1 after 90 minutes and 2–2 after extra time. This was Liverpool&#x27;s first trophy since the 2006 FA Cup Final win over West Ham United on May 13, 2006, at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. In May 2012 he made a controversial decision by firing coach and club icon Kenny Dalglish citing the club&#x27;s poor league results. This was regarded as a poor decision by some soccer pundits such as Dalglish&#x27;s friend Alan Hansen, given Dalglish&#x27;s success in lifting the club from four points above the relegation zone to a cup win. In July 2012, after successfully persuading Brendan Rodgers to become the new coach, Henry attributed parting company with Dalglish as being unrelated to failing to win the FA Cup or the Suarez case, but a product of the club&#x27;s poor league performance in the second half of the 2011–12 season.

Rodgers almost took Liverpool to their first Premier League title in over 20 years during the 2013–14 season; however, poor performances in the subsequent season and a bad start to the 2015–16 season saw Henry sack Brendan Rodgers as Liverpool coach on October 4, 2015. On October 8, 2015, Henry appointed Jürgen Klopp as the new coach of Liverpool F.C. The move was praised by Liverpool supporters and seen as a show of Henry&#x27;s ambition for the club. Klopp led Liverpool to two finals during the 2015–16 season (the League Cup and the Europa League). In 2018 Liverpool reached the Champions League final for the first time in 11 years. In 2019 Liverpool reached the Champions League Final for the second consecutive year and won it, beating fellow English club Tottenham Hotspur, 2–0. Liverpool went on to win the Premier League title in the 2019–20 season; Liverpool&#x27;s first league title in 30 years, and their first since the Premier League was formed.

In April 2021, Liverpool were announced as a founding member of the European Super League, which would have effectively ended the pyramid system of European soccer and placed Liverpool in a closed league without prospects for meritocratic relegation and promotion. Liverpool and the five other English clubs involved backed out within two days after a strong backlash. This prompted Henry to issue an official apology to Liverpool fans, taking responsibility for the events that had occurred.

====NASCAR====
In 2007, Henry&#x27;s Fenway Sports Group bought a 50% stake in Jack Roush&#x27;s Roush Racing stock car racing team. Driver Matt Kenseth won the Auto Club 500 at the California Speedway in February 2007 marking Henry&#x27;s first win as an owner. In February 2009 the team won their first Daytona 500 with Matt Kenseth. Henry is currently listed as the owner of the #17 Ford driven by NASCAR Cup Series driver Chris Buescher.

====iRacing.com Motorsport Simulations====
In September 2004 Henry and David Kaemmer founded iRacing.com Motorsport Simulations for developing a racing simulation service aimed at both real-world racers and racing simulator enthusiasts. The service was launched in August 2008.

===Newspaper ownership===
In the predawn hours of August 3, 2013, both &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot; carried stories on their web sites reporting that Henry had agreed to purchase the former along with the &quot;Telegram &amp; Gazette&quot; newspaper of Worcester, Massachusetts, and related New England media properties for $70 million in cash from The New York Times Company, which paid $1.1 billion for &quot;The Globe&quot; in 1993. The &quot;Globe&quot;″s story described Henry as &quot;a personally shy businessman with a history of bold bets.&quot; The &quot;Times&quot; story quoted &quot;Times&quot; spokesperson Eileen Murphy as confirming the sale deal.

The stories noted that Henry had initially been among a group of partners who had joined in bidding on &quot;The Globe&quot; properties, but ended up agreeing to acquire them individually. However, &quot;The Times&quot; story reported him saying: &quot;In coming days there will be announcements concerning those joining me in this community commitment and effort.&quot;

After the announcement, the ownership of &quot;The San Diego Union-Tribune&quot; (then known as &quot;U-T San Diego&quot;) alleged that it had outbid Henry for &quot;The Globe&quot; but that the management of The Times Company had not fairly handled the process, to the detriment of Times Company shareholders.

In 2014, Henry sold the Worcester &quot;Telegram &amp; Gazette&quot; to Halifax Media Group, which had previously purchased 16 former New York Times Company newspapers in 2011.

==Awards and honors==
* Four-time World Series champion as principal owner of the Boston Red Sox.
* 2024 Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement, presented by guitarist and founder of Led Zeppelin, Jimmy Page

==Personal life==
Henry enjoys playing baseball simulation games, including &quot;Out of the Park Baseball&quot;.

==In popular culture==

Henry was briefly portrayed by Arliss Howard in the 2011 film &quot;Moneyball&quot;, which follows Oakland Athletics general manager Billy Beane and his quest to build a winning team in 2002. Towards the end of the film, Beane travels to Boston&#x27;s Fenway Park where he meets with Henry, who wants Beane to become the new GM of the Red Sox. 

The film depicts Beane turning down a five-year, $12.5 million contract with the Boston Red Sox and returning to the Oakland Athletics, but adds that the Red Sox, despite failing to hire Beane, implemented many of his &quot;Moneyball&quot; ideas and went on to win the 2004 World Series, marking the first Red Sox championship in 86 years.

<text>Jane Jamieson (born 23 June 1975) is a track and field athlete from Australia.

Jamieson competed in the heptathlon in the Olympic Games, World Championships and Commonwealth Games, finishing with Top-10 results at each level, including a gold medal at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester.

After the 2000 Olympic Games, Jamieson was hampered by a string of knee, hamstring and calf injuries and missed the 2004 Olympic Games.

Jamieson returned from injury to qualify for the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, but failed to complete the competition after suffering a calf strain to her left leg combining with the hamstring injury she suffered six weeks before the start of the Melbourne Games.

Jamieson signalled her desire to continue on to the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing and the 2010 Commonwealth Games in New Delhi, but was not selected for either.

<text>Jean François Victor Aicard (4 February 1848 – 13 May 1921) was a French poet, dramatist, and novelist.

==Biography==
He was born in Toulon. His father, Jean Aicard, was a journalist of some distinction, and the son began his career in 1867 with &quot;Les Jeunes Croyances&quot;, followed in 1870 by a one-act play produced at the Marseille theatre.

His poems include: &quot;Les Rebellions et les apaisements&quot; (1871); &quot;Poèmes de Provence&quot; (1874), and &quot;La Chanson de l&#x27;enfant&quot; (1876), both of which were crowned by the Academy; &quot;Miette et Noré&quot; (1880), a Provençal idyll; &quot;Le Livre d&#x27;heures de l&#x27;amour&quot; (1887); &quot;Jésus&quot; (1896); a collection of poems for children (1912) and &quot;Hollande, Algerie&quot; (1913), as well as various volumes of war poetry. Of his plays the most successful was &quot;Le Père Lebonnard&quot; (1890), which was originally produced at the Théâtre Libre. Among his other works are the novels, &quot;Le Roi de Camargue&quot; (1890), &quot;L&#x27;Ame d&#x27;un enfant&quot; (1898) and &quot;Tata&quot; (1901), &quot;Benjamine&quot; (1906), &quot;Arlette des Mayans&quot; (1917), and two volumes of adventure stories, &quot;Un Bandit a la Française&quot; and its sequel &quot;Le fameux chevalier Gaspard de Besse&quot;, both in 1919. &quot;La Vénus de Milo&quot; (1874) was an account of the discovery of the statue from unpublished documents.

&quot;Dark Carnival&quot; was Bradbury&#x27;s first published book. 3,112 copies were printed by Arkham House, under the editorial direction of August Derleth. All but six of the stories had been first published elsewhere, although Bradbury revised some of the texts.

Fifteen of the 27 stories were reprinted in &quot;The October Country&quot; in 1955, some in revised form. Those stories are &quot;The Next in Line&quot;, &quot;Skeleton&quot;, &quot;The Jar&quot;, &quot;The Lake&quot;, &quot;The Emissary&quot;, &quot;The Small Assassin&quot;, &quot;The Crowd&quot;, &quot;Jack-in-the-Box&quot;, &quot;The Scythe&quot;, &quot;Uncle Einar&quot;, &quot;The Wind&quot;, &quot;The Man Upstairs&quot;, &quot;There Was an Old Woman&quot;, &quot;The Cistern&quot; and &quot;The Homecoming&quot;.

Of the remainder, eight have been reprinted in one or more collections. 
* &quot;The Traveler&quot; and &quot;The Coffin&quot; are in &quot;The Stories of Ray Bradbury&quot; 
* &quot;The Night&quot; is in &quot;The Stories of Ray Bradbury&quot; and &quot;The Small Assassin&quot;, a British-only collection 
* &quot;Let&#x27;s Play &#x27;Poison&#x27;&quot; is in &quot;Bradbury Stories: 100 of His Most Celebrated Tales&quot; and &quot;The Small Assassin&quot; 
* &quot;The Tombstone&quot; is in &quot;The Toynbee Convector&quot; and &quot;The Small Assassin&quot;
* &quot;The Smiling People&quot;, &quot;The Dead Man&quot; and &quot;The Handler&quot; are in &quot;Bradbury Stories&quot; and &quot;The Small Assassin&quot;.

&quot;The Night Sets&quot;, &quot;The Maiden&quot;, &quot;Reunion&quot; and &quot;Interim&quot; have not been anthologized as of 2010.

For many years, Bradbury did not permit &quot;Dark Carnival&quot; to be reprinted, since updated versions of many of the stories were collected as &quot;The October Country&quot;. However, a limited edition of &quot;Dark Carnival&quot;, with five extra stories and a new introduction by Bradbury, was printed by Gauntlet Press in 2001.

On August 22, 2006, &quot;The Homecoming&quot; was published as a stand-alone short story with illustrations by Dave McKean.

<doc id="1325554" wikidata="Q39560" url="?curid=1325554" title="Artashat, Armenia">
<text>Artashat ( ) is a town and administrative center of the Artashat Municipality and the Ararat Province of Armenia. It is located on the Azat River in the Ararat Plain, 30 km southeast of Yerevan.

Artashat was originally a village called Ghamarlu, established by Armenian migrants from Iran in 1828–29. It grew into a large village by the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In 1945, it was renamed after the ancient city of Artashat (Artaxata), the ruins of which are located southeast of the city. It received the status of an urban-type settlement in 1946 and that of a city in 1962, growing into an important industrial center in subsequent years.

Artashat is located on the Yerevan-Goris-Stepanakert highway and the currently inoperative Yerevan-Nakhchivan-Baku and Nakhchivan-Tabriz railway. As of the 2022 census, the town had a population of 19,020.

==Name==
Modern Artashat is named after the ancient city of Artashat (also known as Artaxata), the ruins of which are located around 8 km southeast of the modern city. Ancient Artashat served as the capital of the Kingdom of Armenia for nearly 350 years, with some interruptions, after its founding in 176 BC. It was named after its founder King Artashes I, the founder of the Artaxiad dynasty. The name of the city is derived from Iranian languages. It can be interpreted as meaning &quot;the joy of &quot;Arta&quot; (truth),&quot; although it is actually a shortening of &quot;Artaxšas-šāt&quot;, meaning &#x27;the joy of Artashes.&#x27; Old Artashat was also known as , meaning &#x27;court/seat of the Armenians,&#x27; which was also the name of the canton in which it was located. The modern settlement was a village called Ghamarlu (from Turkic, popularly understood as &#x27;moonlike&#x27; or &#x27;moonlit&#x27;) or Verin (&#x27;upper&#x27;) Ghamarlu until it was renamed Artashat in 1945.

==History==
According to the &quot;Dictionary of Toponymy of Armenia and Adjacent Territories&quot;, the site of the modern town of Artashat was uninhabited prior to the conquest of the territory by the Russian Empire in 1828. The new village of Ghamarlu (or Verin Ghamarlu) was founded there in 1828–29 by Armenians immigrating from the districts of Khoy and Salmas in Iran. By the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Ghamarlu had become a large village where gardening, cotton growing, and viticulture were developed. The village produced home-made Armenian brandy and had a winery (founded 1904). These economic activities declined from 1914 to 1920. In 1930, the Ghamarlu District was founded with Ghamarlu as its center. In 1945, the village and district were both renamed Artashat. Artashat received the status of an urban-type settlement in 1946 and a plan for the city was drawn up in 1948. It received the status of a &quot;city of district subordination&quot; city in 1962 and was re-planned in 1968. The former villages of Nerkin (Lower) Ghamarlu and Novruzlu were incorporated into the city. In 1970, Artashat received the status of a &quot;city of republican subordination.&quot; During the Soviet period, particularly after World War II, industry was developed in Artashat and the city became an industrial center, mainly in the spheres of food processing and building materials production. In 1995, with the new law of the territorial administration of the Republic of Armenia, Artashat became the capital of the newly formed Ararat Province.

==Geography==

Artashat is situated in the central part of modern-day Armenia, occupying the southeastern part of the Ararat plain, only 3.5 km east of the Araks River on the Armenia-Turkey border. It is located on the left side of the Azat River. At an approximate height of 830 meters above sea level, the town is dominated by the Yeranos mountains from the north, the mountains of Gegham, Dahnak and Mzhkatar from the east, and the Urts mountains from the southeast.

Currently, Artashat is divided into 4 districts: Novruzlu, Kentron, Ghamarlu and Southwestern district. Almost half of the population of the town resides in the Southwestern district. The town is surrounded by the villages of Mrgavan, Vostan and Shahumyan from the north, east and the south respectively.

===Climate===
Artashat has a cold semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BSk&quot;).
==Demographics==

The majority of the population in Artashat are ethnic Armenians whose ancestors migrated from the Iranian districts of Khoy and Salmas, after the Russo-Persian War of 1826–28. They belong to the Armenian Apostolic Church. The regulating body of the church is the Araratian Pontifical Diocese, headed by Archbishop Navasard Kchoyan (seat in Yerevan).

The town&#x27;s new church of Surp Hovhannes (Saint John the Evangelist) was consecrated on 31 May 2015.

Artashat is home to tiny Assyrian and Russian communities.

The population of Artashat since 1945 is as follows:
== Culture ==

The town has a palace of culture, an art center named after Charles Aznavour, a drama theatre named after Amo Kharazyan and a public library named after Ohan Chubaryan (opened in 1948).

In 2004, a new amusement park was inaugurated in the center of Artashat, which is used to host public celebrations, concerts and musical shows at nights.

During the events dedicated to the 1600th anniversary of the invention of the Armenian alphabet, sculptors from all over Armenia and the diaspora created many cultural monuments in the center of Artashat. A monument to King Artashes I also stands in the center of the city.

At present, the Artashat Drama Theatre named after Amo Kharazyan regularly performs several Armenian and international classic as well as modern works. In addition, the town has its domestic TV station, as well as a number of local newspapers.

==Transportation==

Artashat is a major point on the M-2 Motorway that connects the capital Yerevan with southern Armenia reaching up to the Iranian border.

The town has a railway station that used to connect Yerevan with the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic during the Soviet years.

==Economy==

After facing serious difficulties during the economic crisis of the 1990s in Armenia, many firms in Artashat overcame the hard situation and started producing their products to serve the domestic and international markets. Currently, Artashat is home to many large industrial firms, mainly involved in food processing and building materials. The Artfood Artashat Cannery (established 1961) is among the leading processed food producers in Armenia. The brandy and vodka producer Shaumyan Alco has operated in the town since 2007. In 2009, the mineral water and soft drinks company Ararat Group opened a factory in Artashat with a total investment of US$27 million. Other industrial plants of Artashat include Izipanel, which specializes in sandwich panel manufacturing, as well as many small plants that produce building materials, textile, and other products. Many large construction companies operate in the town as well.

==Education==
As of 2016, Artashat has 6 public schools, 7 kindergartens, 1 musical school named after Alexander Melik Pashaev (opened in 1956), 1 art academy and 2 sport schools.

==Sport==

Artashat has a municipal football stadium opened in 1960, where many competitions and championships for young football teams and athletics are held. FC Dvin Artashat, founded in 1982 as Olympia Artashat, was the only football club in the city. After the 1999 Armenian Premier League season, the club was dissolved due to financial difficulties and is currently inactive from professional football.

The stadium of Artashat is the regular home of the annual National Athletics Championship of Armenia.

<doc id="1325558" wikidata="Q1218454" url="?curid=1325558" title="The Golden Apples of the Sun">
<text>The Golden Apples of the Sun is an anthology of 22 short stories by American writer Ray Bradbury. It was published by Doubleday &amp; Company in 1953.

The book&#x27;s title is also the title of the final story in the collection. The words &quot;the golden apples of the sun&quot; are from the last line of the final stanza of W. B. Yeats&#x27; poem &quot;The Song of Wandering Aengus&quot; (1899):

Bradbury prefaces his book with the last three lines of this poem. When asked what attracted him to the line &quot;the golden apples of the sun&quot;, he said, &quot;[My wife] Maggie introduced me to Romantic poetry when we were dating, and I loved it. I love that line in the poem, and it was a metaphor for my story, about taking a cup full of fire from the sun.&quot;

&quot;The Golden Apples of the Sun&quot; was Bradbury&#x27;s third published collection of short stories. The first, &quot;Dark Carnival&quot;, was published by Arkham House in 1947; the second, &quot;The Illustrated Man&quot;, was published by Doubleday &amp; Company in 1951.

==Contents==
In 1990, Bantam Books collected most of the stories from &quot;R Is for Rocket&quot; (1962) and &quot;The Golden Apples of the Sun&quot; into a semi-omnibus edition titled &quot;Classic Stories 1&quot;. In 1997, Avon Books printed a new edition of the omnibus, titling it &quot;The Golden Apples of the Sun and Other Stories&quot;. Harper Perennial titled their 2005 edition as &quot;A Sound of Thunder and Other Stories&quot;.

The semi-omnibus editions omit three of the stories that appear in &quot;The Golden Apples of the Sun&quot;: &quot;The Pedestrian&quot; (1951), &quot;Invisible Boy&quot; (1945), and &quot;Hail and Farewell&quot; (1953).

==Reception==
Writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Charles Poore reported that Bradbury &quot;writes in a style that seems to have been nourished on the poets and fabulists of the Irish Literary Renaissance&quot;, and said he was &quot;wonderfully adept at getting to the heart of his story without talking all day long about it and around it.&quot;

Anthony Boucher and J. Francis McComas of &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot; found &quot;Golden Apples&quot; to be a &quot;most uncertain reading experience… material of a curiously mixed quality; writing that is often simply and perceptively moving [and] just as often sadly lacking any particular strength or color&quot;.

&quot;Imagination&quot; reviewer Mark Reinsberg called Bradbury &quot;a gifted writer&quot;, but complained that he had &quot;a tendency to overestimate the power of style to nourish anemic themes.&quot;

Groff Conklin of &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot; praised the collection, saying it included &quot;some of the best imaginative stories [Bradbury] or anyone else has ever written. One cannot even begin to describe their delights.&quot;

<text>Wonderful Days (also known as Sky Blue) is a South Korean animated science fiction film, released in 2003, written and directed by Kim Moon-saeng. It features backdrops rendered using photo-realistic computer-generated imagery (CGI), comparable to those in the film &quot;Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within&quot;, along with the use of highly detailed models for some of the backdrops into which the cel animated characters were then animated. However, convincing CGI animation of humans (especially human movement) was not attempted. The backgrounds in the film were shot with traditional motion control techniques, then processed to look like computer graphics. The vehicles were all rendered, and the characters were cel animated.

== Plot ==
&quot;Wonderful Days&quot; is set in 2142. Environmental pollution has led to a breakdown of human civilization. A technologically advanced city named Ecoban was built and it harvests energy from the DELOS System, which uses pollution in a carbonite catalyzed reaction to generate power. Carbonite extraction is carried out by people who live outside the city in the surrounding wasteland. Among them is an enigmatic young man known as Shua. He ends up in a love triangle with his childhood friend, a girl named Jay, and her superior, Ecoban security commander Cade as his rival.

The film deals with environmental destruction, pollution and class struggle.

== Voice Cast ==

== Production ==
Kim Moon-saeng made his feature directorial debut after having previously directed commercials for various advertising agencies.

Along with CG effects, a set of miniatures for buildings, mechanics, and characters were built and filmed with HDW-F900 which was co-developed by Sony and Lucasfilm and one of two prototype Frazier lens (the other was used for &quot;Star Wars&quot; by Lucasfilm).

Micah Wright and Jay Lender contributed to the script of the film, although they have not been credited in the final film.

== Releases ==
The film has been released in numerous Western countries such as the US and Great Britain under the title &quot;Sky Blue&quot;. These versions have been slightly distorted, with the loss of two minutes of the running time compared to the original Korean cut. Other Western countries such as France and Finland have kept its original title—which is a Hangul transliteration of the English phrase &quot;Wonderful Days&quot; (it would be rendered in Revised Romanization as &quot;&quot;). An all-region 2-disc collector&#x27;s edition DVD to the dubbed version of the film was released in the UK on November 14, 2005. A Blu-ray of the film was eventually released in the UK on June 8, 2008. The film was scheduled for release in the US on Blu-ray disc on June 28, 2008. As that date neared, it was rescheduled for June 23, 2009, however, the financial situation of Palisades Tartan in America has thrown a US domestic release into doubt.

In Japan, the film was adapted by Gainax. According to adaptation director Hiroshi Yamaga, Gainax changed the direction of the film to make the dialogue less &quot;alien&quot; to Japanese viewers.

The film was released on DVD in Korea on September 6, 2003. On May 27, 2004, the film was re-released on a 3-disc limited original edition DVD in Korea that features a director&#x27;s cut of the film. This version includes 9 minutes of additional footage that wasn&#x27;t present in the original cut, plus a few changes to the dialogue. On May 15, 2013, the director&#x27;s cut was released on Blu-ray, but uses the bonus material from the DVD to the theatrical cut.

== Festivals ==
&quot;Wonderful Days&quot; was screened at the following film festivals:
* Sitges International Film Festival, 2003;
* San Sebastian International Film Festival, 2003;
* Cannes Film Festival, 2003;
* Sundance Film Festival, 2004;

<doc id="1325588" wikidata="Q221314" url="?curid=1325588" title="We Built This City">
<text>&quot;We Built This City&quot; is the debut single by American rock band Starship, from their 1985 debut album &quot;Knee Deep in the Hoopla&quot;. It was written by English musicians Martin Page and Bernie Taupin, who were both living in Los Angeles at the time, and was originally intended as a lament against the closure of many of that city&#x27;s live music clubs.

The song peaked at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Outside the United States, &quot;We Built This City&quot; topped the charts in Australia and Canada, peaked inside the Top 10 of the charts in Germany, the Republic of Ireland, Sweden and Switzerland, the Top 20 on the charts in Belgium, New Zealand and the United Kingdom and the Top 30 of the charts in Austria and the Netherlands.

The song has gained significant scorn, both for the inscrutability of its lyrics (notably the line &quot;Marconi plays the mamba&quot;), and for the contrast between the song&#x27;s anti-corporate message and its polished, &quot;corporate rock&quot; sound. It topped a 2011 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; poll of worst songs of the 1980s by a wide margin, and the magazines &quot;Blender&quot; and &quot;GQ&quot; both called it the worst song of all time.

The album&#x27;s title, &quot;Knee Deep in the Hoopla&quot;, is taken from a lyric in the first verse of this song.

== Content and production ==
Song co-writers Martin Page and Bernie Taupin have stated that the song is about the decline of live-performance clubs in Los Angeles during the 1980s. In 2013, Taupin told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that the &quot;original song was a very dark kind of mid-tempo song ... about how club life in L.A. was being killed off and live acts had no place to go ... A guy called Peter Wolf [the album&#x27;s producer] ... got ahold of the demo and totally changed it. He jerry-rigged it into the pop hit it was&quot;. In an interview with Songfacts, Page added that the &quot;demo was quite high-energy techno, because that was the sound of the band I was in ... it was a little more edgy. And I&#x27;m very pleased with what Starship did with it, because they made it a universally appealing song&quot;.

Though &quot;We Built This City&quot; was originally written about Los Angeles, the Starship rendition references San Francisco (the hometown of both Starship and its predecessors, Jefferson Airplane and Jefferson Starship). MTV executive and former DJ Les Garland provided the DJ voiceover during the song&#x27;s bridge. While &quot;the city by the bay&quot; refers to San Francisco, the other two phrases used by Garland—&quot;the city that rocks&quot; and &quot;The City That Never Sleeps&quot;—refer to Cleveland, Ohio, and New York City, respectively. To capitalize on this, several radio stations, with the help of jingle company JAM Creative Productions, customized the bridge when broadcasting the song by adding descriptions of their own local areas or inserting their idents.

The song was engineered by producer Bill Bottrell, written by Bernie Taupin, Martin Page, Dennis Lambert and Peter Wolf and arranged by Bottrell and Jasun Martz with shared lead vocals by Mickey Thomas and Grace Slick.

==Reception==

&quot;Billboard&quot; said that this &quot;unusual rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll anthem is as wise as it is rebellious&quot;. &quot;Cash Box&quot; called it &quot;an ear-catching tune&quot; and described it as &quot;dance rock with sharp hooks&quot;.

&quot;We Built This City&quot; received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Rock Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group in 1986.

Half Man Half Biscuit parodied the song on their &quot;Achtung Bono&quot; album, &quot;We Built This Village on a Trad. Arr. Tune&quot;.

===&quot;Blender&quot; magazine&#x27;s 50 Most Awesomely Bad Songs Ever===
In 2004, the magazine &quot;Blender&quot; ran a feature on &quot;The 50 Worst Songs Ever&quot;, in conjunction with the VH1 Special &quot;The 50 Most Awesomely Bad Songs...Ever&quot;. To qualify, songs had to be well-known hits; the list also avoided novelty songs, and multiple songs by the same artist. &quot;We Built This City&quot; came in at #1. According to &quot;Blender&quot; editor Craig Marks, the choice was nearly unanimous among those who had been polled. Marks said of the song, &quot;It purports to be anti-commercial but reeks of &#x27;80s corporate-rock commercialism. It&#x27;s a real reflection of what practically killed rock music in the &#x27;80s.&quot; He referred to the line of the song &quot;Marconi plays the mamba&quot;, asking, &quot;Who is Marconi? And what is the mamba? The mamba is the deadliest snake in the world, so he must have meant the mambo, but it sounds so much like &#x27;mamba&#x27; that every lyric website writes it that way. It makes sense neither way.&quot; The &quot;Blender&quot; feature also noted the irony of the song lamenting &quot;they&#x27;re always changing corporation names&quot;, given Starship&#x27;s own frequent name changes.

Asked about the listing, Mickey Thomas, one of the singers of Starship, said he was surprised at the ranking, but also &quot;thrilled&quot; because of the other high-profile groups on the list, saying, &quot;I wish Blender had called us for a group shot. I&#x27;d love to have my picture taken with Stevie Wonder and Paul McCartney.&quot; (Wonder and McCartney were listed together at #10 for their 1982 duet &quot;Ebony and Ivory&quot;.) Asked again about the listing in 2010, Thomas said: &quot;From what I heard, they got so much flak about it that they sort of retracted their statements in a way about the song. And not only that, but &quot;Blender&quot;″s folded, and we&#x27;re still here.&quot;

&quot;Richmond Times-Dispatch&quot; music critic Melissa Ruggieri argued that &quot;Nothing&#x27;s Gonna Stop Us Now&quot; and &quot;Sara&quot; were Starship songs that were more suitable for the top of the list than &quot;We Built This City&quot;, a song Ruggieri said &quot;references Marconi, the father of the radio...inserted a cool snippet of DJ chatter from the band&#x27;s beloved San Francisco...[and] found Grace Slick enunciating the phrase &#x27;corporation games&#x27; with nutty abandon.&quot;

===&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; Top Ten Worst Songs of the 1980s===
In 2011, a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine online readers poll named &quot;We Built This City&quot; the worst song of the 1980s. The song&#x27;s winning margin was so large that the magazine reported it &quot;could be the biggest blow-out victory in the history of the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; Readers Poll&quot;.

===&quot;GQ&quot; Worst Song of All Time===
In August 2016, &quot;GQ&quot; magazine declared this song as the worst of all time, referring to it as &quot;the most detested song in human history&quot;. The article covered Bernie Taupin and Martin Page&#x27;s roles in writing an early version of the song, the song&#x27;s development into its final version, its massive success and backlash, and Grace Slick&#x27;s inconsistent statements about whether she liked the song.

===LadBaby version===
In December 2018, British blogger LadBaby released a comedy version of the song with a sausage roll theme (the refrain being &quot;We Built This City on Sausage Rolls&quot;) as a charity single whose profits went to The Trussell Trust. It debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart, beating Ava Max&#x27;s &quot;Sweet but Psycho&quot; and Ariana Grande&#x27;s &quot;Thank U, Next&quot; to the 2018 Christmas number one.

=== Other versions ===
American indie rock band Cursive covered the song in 2010 for the first season of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;″s &quot;A.V. Undercover&quot; web series.

=== Popular culture ===
In 2024, a commercial for the toilet paper brand &quot;Quilted Northern&quot; parodied the song as &quot;We Quilt This City&quot;.

<text>The Union Pacific Railroad&#x27;s M-10002 was a diesel-electric streamliner train built in 1936 by Pullman-Standard, with prime movers from the Winton Engine division of General Motors Corporation and General Electric generator, control equipment and traction motors. It was the UP&#x27;s third streamliner, and the last turret-cab streamliner.

The original order was for two 1200 hp power cars, M-10002 and M-10003, of the same design as M-10001. However, the demands of Chicago-to-west-coast service led UP to expand the consists from six to nine cars and seek more power for the larger trainsets. Following the demonstration of multiple unit control systems with the EMC 1800 hp B-B units, the new technology was used to increase the power of M-10002 by adding a booster unit with the 900 hp engine that had been removed from M-10001 when it was rebuilt prior to entering regular service. The order for M-10003 was cancelled and the order number was used for one of the four more powerful locomotive sets built after M-10002.

The cab unit was fitted with a V16 Winton 201-A diesel engine and booster was equipped with a V12 Winton 201-A engine. The cab and booster units were articulated together with a span bolster, giving them an effective wheel arrangement of B-B+B-B, but they were not articulated with the train and therefore formed the Union Pacific&#x27;s first separable diesel locomotive. The consist of nine passenger cars made it the longest streamliner trainset yet introduced.

M-10002 entered service as the &quot;City of Los Angeles&quot; on May 15, 1936, the day after the Santa Fe Railroad introduced their first non-streamlined diesel-hauled, heavyweight &quot;Super Chief&quot; on their competing Chicago, Illinois to Los Angeles, California route. After the introduction of a full-sized train powered by the new EMC E2 locomotive as the &quot;City of Los Angeles&quot; in December 1937, the train was withdrawn from service for approximately three months then reassigned to the &quot;City of Portland&quot; to replace the M-10001. In July 1941, the train was replaced on that route with a train powered by an EMC E3 locomotive set and placed in storage. The train was reactivated in April 1942 to operate on a Portland-Seattle connection, then withdrawn for the third and final time in May 1943 and the passenger cars removed. The locomotive units were moved to El Segundo, California in December 1946, for experiments with coal-fueled gas turbine locomotive power by a Northrop-Hendy partnership; the project was abandoned and the locomotives were scrapped in December 1947.

M-10002 remained the longest in Chicago-to-west-coast service among the original fleet of Union Pacific streamliners, just under five years.

<doc id="1325610" wikidata="Q208031" url="?curid=1325610" title="Enon (band)">
<text>Enon was an indie rock band founded by John Schmersal, Rick Lee, and Steve Calhoon that was active from 1997 to 2011; for most of its history, however, Enon was a three-piece outfit composed of Schmersal, Toko Yasuda, and Matt Schulz. Though situated for a time in Philadelphia, Enon was primarily known for being part of the New York music scene.

Enon was known for using Moog synthesizers and Teisco guitars. Schmersal&#x27;s green guitar he often used on stage was a Teisco TG-64, and he also owns a Teisco Del Rey. Yasuda played a Fender Jazz Bass with an adapted tuning machine, which allowed quickly tuning to D from E. Schmersal also owns a custom built Twister guitar built by Yuri Landman, an alternate version of the Springtime exclusively crafted for Enon with some additional features such as a scalloped fretboard and an additional pickup in the bridge.

Enon released 4 studio albums, 2 instrumental albums, a compilation, 17 singles and multiple free song downloads throughout the band&#x27;s lifespan. After breaking up in 2011, Yasuda went on to start her own solo project; Plvs Vltra, Schulz went on to play in Holy Fuck, and Schmersal reunited with Brainiac to perform live and released cancelled material after nearly 20 years of inactivity.

==History==
===1997-2001: Formation, Long Play, Believo!===
Schmersal was originally in the band Brainiac and formed Enon (named after the village in Ohio, which is close to Schmersal&#x27;s hometown of Dayton) with Lee and Calhoon following the death of Brainiac&#x27;s singer Timmy Taylor and their subsequent disbandment. After Brainiac, Schmersal made a solo album under the name John Stuart Mill. Rick Lee and Steve Calhoon were both previous members of the band Skeleton Key, a befriended band Brainiac had toured with. Together they formed Enon. Lee created a number of percussion sounds for the band playing a &quot;junk kit&quot; including a Radio Flyer wagon, propane tank, and old hubcaps. Enon released a short instrumental album named &quot;Long Play&quot; in 1998, some of the songs from the album were later adapted for their future studio work.

After the release of their first studio album Believo!, which was Produced by D. Sardy and signed to his SeeThru Broadcasting label in 1999, Calhoon left the band and was replaced by Toko Yasuda (bass/vocals/keyboard) and Matt Schulz (drums). Yasuda was previously in the bands Blonde Redhead, The Lapse and The Van Pelt. In 2000, Schmersal performed the theme song for Funny Garbage&#x27;s “Katbot” interactive website, with small contributions from other Enon members.

===2002-2005: High Society, Songs of the Month, Hocus Pocus, Lost Marbles===
SeeThru Broadcasting was initially set to release Enon&#x27;s upcoming studio album in September 2001, but the label decided to close following the 9/11 attacks in New York. Enon temporarily released their second instrumental album &quot;On Hold&quot; in 2001 to compensate fans for waiting. Enon signed with the Chicago-based indie label, Touch and Go Records after the closing of SeeThru Broadcasting, with a new lineup, label, and sound; Enon released their second studio album High Society in 2002, after around half a year of limbo, and toured with The Faint. High Society was generally praised by critics for its showcase of the band&#x27;s evolving sound, and the addition of Yasuda as a lead singer on most of the album. Enon also released a self titled EP earlier in the year, containing 7 tracks; most of which were featured on their future compilation, Lost Marbles and Exploded Evidence.

From April 2002 to December 2003, Enon released a free unreleased song once a month on their official website. All songs were made available as 128 kbit/s MP3 downloads and only available during the month they were released. Shortly after the release of High Society, Lee left the band, and Enon went on to release &quot;Hocus Pocus&quot; in 2003. Hocus Pocus received mixed reviews from critics, partially due to its heavy experimentation and disorienting tracklist; although praise was given to Schmersal and Yasuda&#x27;s vocal and writing collaboration on tracks like &quot;Murder Sounds&quot;, and &quot;Starcastic&quot;. Enon released a collection of singles and previously difficult to find internet-released songs with a bonus DVD entitled Lost Marbles and Exploded Evidence in February 2005, the collection was generally liked by critics. Also in 2005, Schmersal relocated to Philadelphia and opened his own recording studio. Mean Reds, Thunderbirds Are Now! and other bands recorded albums with Schmersal in this period. Schmersal re-recorded the &quot;Katbot&quot; theme song, after the show had been picked up by Disney in late 2005; the song went unused however, as the show went unaired and was eventually quietly cancelled after 4 episodes were produced.

===2006-2011: Commercial work, Grass Geysers, Collaborations, and Breakup===
After opening his studio, and working with Disney on Katbot in 2005, Schemersal&#x27;s music was used for series opens, promo packages and channel branding for Sundance Channel, as well as scoring work for the animated feature Monster House (with composer David Sardy) and the award-winning 2007 indie film Tie A Yellow Ribbon. While performing with Enon, Schmersal (sometimes accompanied by Yasuda) found himself in demand as a composer for short films, animated programs, bumpers and interstitials, and commercials for clients including Disney, Cartoon Network, MTV and Nickelodeon. Many of these instrumentals feature the signature electro-analog quirkiness emblematic of Enon.

In 2007, all three members of Enon contributed to Les Savy Fav&#x27;s album Let&#x27;s Stay Friends. Yasuda also did vocal contributions to previous recordings of this band, e.g. the first track of The Cat and the Cobra. Later in the year, Enon released their fourth and final studio album, &quot;Grass Geysers...Carbon Clouds&quot; on Touch and Go Records on October 9, 2007. to generally positive reviews, higher than their previous album; Hocus Pocus. Although the album leaked early on September 5, sales were still high on digitally storefronts like iTunes, with an exclusive song being offered to boost sales on the platform. To accompany the release of Grass Geysers, Believo! received a reissue by Touch and Go the same day, which contained all of its music videos.

In summer 2008, drummer Matt Schulz announced that he would be leaving the group to pursue other interests. Afterwards he joined Holy Fuck as a touring member. Brainiac&#x27;s former bassist, Monasterio, released an album in 2008 with a new band called Model/Actress; with Schmersal making appearances on the album. An otherwise unreleased song called &quot;We Are The Robots&quot; was used in the October 2008 episode of cult children&#x27;s TV series Yo Gabba Gabba! titled &quot;Robot.&quot; The 1:21 song was accompanied by animation of robots playing with children and assisting with household chores. In 2009, Schmersal and Yasuda recorded the opening theme for PBS Kids show Dash&#x27;s Dance Party.

In a May 2011 interview, after touring with Caribou for a good portion of 2010 and 2011, Schmersal confirmed the band &quot;is pretty much over&quot; with no plans to follow up on &quot;Grass Geysers...Carbon Clouds&quot;. From 2011 to 2014 Yasuda toured with St. Vincent playing synth.

==Side projects==
===John Stuart Mill===
Prior to the recording and release of Believo!, Schmersal recorded and released a solo album under the name John Stuart Mill, after the British philosopher and political economist. Schemeral released one 13-track album, &quot;Forget Everything,&quot; as John Stuart Mill on See-Thru Broadcasting in 1999. The album was released on CD only and quickly went out of print when the label folded. Columbus-based Scioto Records reissued &quot;Forget Everything&quot; on Bandcamp and on vinyl in 2016.

===Crooks On Tape===
In 2010 Schmersal reteamed with Enon&#x27;s Rick Lee and drummer Joey Galvan to create the improvisational trio Crooks On Tape. The band released the album &quot;Fingerprint&quot; on Misra Records in 2013 and an instrumental, vinyl-only album &quot;In The Realm Of The Ancient Minor&quot; on Pure Orgone for Record Store Day 2015.

===Plvs Vltra===
Since 2012 Yasuda has recorded under the name Plvs Vltra, releasing the solo album &quot;Parthenon&quot; on Spectrum Spools in 2012. Schmersal produced that album, which also features appearances from Danny Ray Thompson of the Sun Ra Arkestra, Scott Allen of Thunderbirds Are Now, Thomas Keville of Man Man.

In 2013 Plvs Vltra released the non-LP single &quot;Rooftop Arcade&quot; b/w &quot;Mesopotamia&quot; on Columbus-based Scioto Records. That same year, Plvs Vltra released second album &quot;Yo-Yo Blue&quot; on Bandcamp and on the cassette-only label Field Hymns.

===Vertical Scratchers===
In 2014 Schmersal collaborated with drummer Christian Eric Beaulieu (Triclops!, Anywhere, Peace Creeps) to form Vertical Scratchers. The band released the album &quot;Daughter of Everything&quot; on Merge Records in 2014 which featured guest appearances by Jonathan Hischke (Flying Luttenbachers, Hella, Broken Bells) and fellow Daytonite Robert Pollard (Guided By Voices). Pitchfork gave the album a 7.2 rating, calling the music &quot;rock‘n’roll rendered on Etch A Sketch...occasionally, you find yourself marveling at an accidental masterpiece.&quot;

Vertical Scratchers also contributed an exclusive track, &quot;Jackie&#x27;s Favorite,&quot; to the Merge 7-inch box set &quot;Or Thousands Of Prizes.&quot;

<text>Luis José Santander (born April 8, 1960) is a Venezuelan actor. He was born in the United States and raised in Venezuela.

==Biography==
Santander was born in Fort Collins, Colorado, USA, where his parents were studying. Santander arrived in Venezuela at an early age, and grew up in an environment where artistic manifestations were present every day as painters, poets, and illustrious musicians who visited the house of his parents.

After completing his primary and secondary studies, he put aside his parents dream that he study medicine, instead choosing to study acting. He achieved a scholarship to study drama in the United States in Bridgeport Connecticut, where he perfected the mastery of the language of Shakespeare.

Santander has received several awards among which are: Mara Gold, Meridian Gold, TVyNovelas, Silver Star——the latter two of Mexico, among others. His popularity has steadily increased and with it he has received multiple invitations to participate in events and programs in America, Europe, and even Asia.

==Career==
Santander was not an instant sensation, as he had to work hard to become famous. He labored as an actor in small plays around Venezuela when his chance to become famous arrived in 1987. That year, he made his television debut in &quot;Y la Luna Tambien&quot; (&quot;And the Moon Too&quot;), which became a major international hit, reaching important numbers in Puerto Rico, Mexico and Ecuador, among others. It wasn&#x27;t until 1988, however, when, at the age of 28, he became a teen idol following the smash success of &quot;Niña Bonita&quot; (&quot;Pretty Girl&quot;). This production, which was produced by Venevision and had nothing in common storywise with the latter Hollywood hit &quot;Pretty Woman&quot;, was a major hit all over Latin America propelling Santander and his female co-star, Ruddy Rodríguez, into super-stardom in the area. The telenovela&#x27;s title song &quot;Tan Enamorados&quot; also propelled singer Ricardo Montaner into international fame.

&quot;Niña Bonita&quot;″s success raised both Santander and Rodriguez&#x27;s rentability in the high-paying Hispanic soap opera world. In Santander&#x27;s case, he followed &quot;Niña Bonita&quot; with &quot;Maribel&quot; in 1989. While not as successful as &quot;Niña Bonita]]&quot;, &quot;Maribel&quot; was also a large hit for the Venezuelan actor.

In 1991, he participated in &quot;Mundo de Fieras&quot;, which was another large success on the Venezuelan and United States Latino television viewer&#x27;s ratings.

By then, his telenovelas had caused so much interest, that Santander became well known in Europe as well, with many of his soap operas being shown in places like Russia and Hungary.

In 1993, Santander participated in &quot;Macarena&quot;. In 1994, he participated in &quot;Morena Clara&quot; (&quot;Brown Girl&quot;), which, again, would prove that he was among Venezuelans&#x27; favorite actors.

In a surprise move, he went to Mexico in 1995, contracted by that country&#x27;s largest network, Televisa, to film &quot;Lazos de Amor&quot;, (&quot;Love Ties&quot;) alongside Mexican superstar Lucero. Odd as it might sound to many, at the age of 37, Santander recovered his status as a teen idol, at least in Mexico, where that soap opera became a classic of Mexican television, due in part to the following he generated among Mexican teenaged girl. Afterward, he starred in &quot;Te sigo amando&quot; (&quot;I will still love you&quot;) (1996) with Claudia Ramirez and Sergio Goyri.

After filming &quot;Vidas Prestadas&quot; (&quot;Borrowed Lives&quot;) in 2000, Santander has lived in semi-retirement, often flying between Mexico and Venezuela for interviews and special occasions, including appearing in &quot;Inocente de ti&quot; alongside Camila Sodi and Valentino Lanus.

In 2006, Santander returned to Venezuela to star in the telenovela &quot;Silvia Rivas, divorciada&quot;. In 2007, Santander appeared in the telenovela &quot;Voltea pa&#x27; que te enamores&quot;.

In 2007, he was also invited to participate in the telenovela &quot;Pasión&quot; which was produced by Carla Estrada in Mexico and was shown in several countries around the world. Santander played &quot;Foreman&quot;, a British pirate. Carla Estrada also produced &quot;Lazos de Amor&quot; (Love Ties) which was mentioned before.

<doc id="1325621" wikidata="Q170532" url="?curid=1325621" title="Amasya">
<text>Amasya () is a city in northern Turkey, in the Black Sea Region. It was called Amaseia or Amasia in antiquity. It is the seat of Amasya Province and Amasya District. Its population is 114,921 (2021). Amasya stands in the mountains above the Black Sea (Karadeniz) coast, set apart from the rest of Anatolia in a narrow valley along the banks of the Yeşilırmak River. Although near the Black Sea, this area is high above the coast and has an inland climate, well-suited to growing apples, for which Amasya province, one of the provinces in north-central Anatolia Turkey, is famed. It was the home of the geographer Strabo and the birthplace of the 15th century Armenian scholar and physician Amirdovlat Amasiatsi. Located in a narrow cleft of the Yeşilırmak (Iris) river, it has a history of 7,500 years with many traces still evident today.

In antiquity, Amaseia was a fortified city high on the cliffs above the river. It has a long history as a wealthy provincial capital, producing kings and princes, artists, scientists, poets and thinkers, from the kings of Pontus, through Strabo the geographer, to many generations of the Ottoman imperial dynasty. With its Ottoman-period wooden houses and the tombs of the Pontus kings carved into the cliffs overhead, Amasya is attractive to visitors. In recent years, there has been much investment in tourism, and therefore more foreign and Turkish tourists have visited the city.

During the early Ottoman rule, it was customary for young Ottoman princes to be sent to Amasya to govern and gain experience. Amasya was also the birthplace of the Ottoman sultans Murad I and Selim I. Traditional Ottoman houses near the Yeşilırmak and the other main historical buildings have been restored; these traditional Yalıboyu houses are now used as cafes, restaurants, pubs and hotels. Behind the Ottoman wooden houses one can see the rock tombs of the Pontic kings.

==Etymology==

According to Strabo the Greek name Ἀμάσεια comes from Amasis, the queen of the Amazons, who were said to have lived here. The name has changed little throughout history: Ἀμάσεια, &quot;Amaseia&quot;, &quot;Amassia&quot; and &quot;Amasia&quot; are all found on ancient Greek and Roman coinage and continue to be used in modern Greek. Armenian Ամասիա, Ottoman Turkish اماسیه, and modern Turkish &quot;Amasya&quot; all represent the same pronunciation.

== History ==
===Antiquity===
Archaeological research shows that Amasya was first settled by the Hittites and subsequently by Phrygians, Cimmerians, Lydians, Greeks, Persians, and Armenians.

===Hellenistic period===
An independent Pontic kingdom with its capital at Amaseia was established by the Persian Mithridatic dynasty at the end of the 4th century BC, in the wake of Alexander&#x27;s conquests. In the 1st century BC, it briefly contested Rome&#x27;s hegemony in Anatolia. By 183 BC, the city was settled by Greeks, eventually becoming the capital of the Kingdom of Pontus from 333 BC to 26 BC. Today, there are prominent ruins including the royal tombs of Pontus in the rocks above the riverbank in the centre of the city. Ancient district in northeastern Anatolia adjoining the Black Sea.

===Roman-Byzantine period===
Amaseia was captured by a force led by the Roman Lucullus in 70 BC from Armenia and was quickly made a free city and administrative center of his new province of Bithynia and Pontus by Pompey. By this time, Amaseia was a thriving city, the home of thinkers, writers and poets, and one of them, Strabo, left a full description of Amaseia as it was between 60 BC and 19 AD. Around 2 or 3 BC, it was incorporated into the Roman province of Galatia, in the district of Pontus Galaticus. Around the year 112, the emperor Trajan designated it a part of the province of Cappadocia. Later in the 2nd century it gained the titles &#x27;metropolis&#x27; and &#x27;first city&#x27;. After the division of the Roman Empire by emperor Diocletian the city became part of the East Roman Empire (the Byzantine Empire). At this time it had a predominantly Greek-speaking population.

Amaseia was also referenced in the first book of the Alexiad. Amaseia was the town where Emperor Alexios I Komnenos received the Norman general Ursel as a captive from the Turkic general Tutach. Ursel had, according to the book, looted and pillaged the Eastern provinces of the Byzantine Empire until the at-the-time General Alexios convinced Tutach to capture him. Alexios agreed that he would pay &quot;...such a sum of money as no one ever gained before.&quot; to Tutach for the capture of Ursel, however Alexios had no cash to give and the Emperor was unable to fund it, so he attempted to raise money from the people of Amaseia, however this caused serious unrest. However, after a speech by Alexios, he arranged a mock-blinding of Ursel which promptly caused the people to contribute funds. However, this is likely to be biased.

Saints Theodore of Amasea (died by 319), a warrior saint, and the local bishop Asterius of Amasea (died ), some of whose polished sermons survive, are notable Christian figures from the period.

In 2013, a 24-square-meter Christian mosaic belonging to the floor of a chapel was discovered, near a site where an illegal archaeological dig had been attempted. The mosaic, depicts apples, an apple tree, partridges and many geometric figures.

=== Early Turkish rulers ===

In 1075, ending 700 years of Byzantine rule, Amasya was conquered by the Turkmen Danishmend emirs. It served as their capital until the annexation of the Danishmendid dominions by the Seljuk ruler Kilij Arslan II. When he died, his realm was divided among his sons, and Amasya passed to Nizam ad-Din Arghun Shah. His rule was brief, as he lost it to his brother Rukn ad-Din Suleiman Shah, who subsequently became Sultan. During the 13th century the city passed under the control of the Mongol Ilkhanate, and was ruled by Mongol governors, except for a brief rule by Taj ad-Din Altintash, son of the last Seljuk sultan, Mesud II.
Under the Seljuks and the Ilkhan, the city became a centre of Islamic culture and produced some notable individuals such as Yaqut al-Musta&#x27;simi (1221–1298) calligrapher and secretary of the last Abbasid caliph who was a Greek native of Amasya. Schools, mosques, tombs and other architecture of this period still remain.

In 1341, the emir Habiloghlu occupied the city, before it came under the rule of the Eretnid emirate. Hadji Shadgeldi Pasha took Amasya from the Eretnids under Ali Bey, and successfully fended off the claims of Kadi Burhan al-Din, who had supplanted the Eretnids. Shadgeldi was succeeded by his son Ahmed, who managed to retain his autonomy for a while, with Ottoman assistance; but in 1391/92, the mounting pressure forced him to cede the city to the Ottoman sultan Bayezid I, who installed his son, the future Mehmed I, as its governor.

===Ottoman era===

After the disastrous Battle of Ankara in 1402, Mehmed I fled to Amasya, which (along with nearby Tokat) became his main residence and stronghold during the Ottoman Interregnum.

As a result, the city enjoyed a special status under the Ottomans. A number of Ottoman princes were sent to the province of Amasya (the Rûm Eyalet) as governors in their youth, from Mehmed II in the late 14th century to Bayezid II in the 15th century, through to Murat III in the 16th century.

Suleiman the Magnificent often stayed in the city, and even received the Habsburg ambassador Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq there. Already distinguished a cultural centre under the Seljuks, Amasya now &quot;became one of the main seats of learning in Anatolia&quot;.

Between 1530 and 1545, several travelers documented a blood libel against some of the town&#x27;s Jews. After the disappearance of a local Christian, several Jews living in town were blamed for killing him for ritual reasons. The Jews confessed under torture and were hanged. When the supposed victim was discovered to still be alive, Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent ordered that all accusations regarding religious rituals should be judged under &quot;royal&quot; and not local court. In 1555, Amasya was also the location for the signing of the Peace of Amasya with the Safavid dynasty of Persia.

The population of Amasya at this time was very different from that of most other cities in the Ottoman Empire, as it was part of their training for the future sultans to learn about every nation of the Empire. Every millet of the Empire was represented in Amasya in a particular village—such as a Greek village, an Armenian village, a Bosnian village, a Tatar village, a Turkish village etc. (see: 1927 Population count data by DİE)
In the late 19th century, the city had 25,000–30,000 inhabitants, mostly Turks, but also some Armenians and Greeks.

=== World War I and the Turkish War of Independence ===

In 1919 Amasya was the location of the final planning meetings held by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk for the building of a Turkish army to establish the Turkish republic following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire at the end of the First World War. It was here that Mustafa Kemal made the announcement of the Turkish War of Independence in the Amasya Circular. This circular is considered as the first written document putting the Turkish War of Independence in motion. The circular, distributed across Anatolia, declared Turkey&#x27;s independence and integrity to be in danger and called for a national conference to be held in Sivas (Sivas Congress) and before that, for a preparatory congress comprising representatives from the eastern provinces of Anatolia to be held in Erzurum in July (Erzurum Congress).

During the years of World War I and the Turkish War of Independence, the Christian inhabitants of Amasya (Armenian and Greek) suffered from atrocities. Many Armenian civilians fleeing the attacks sought refuge at the American missionary school Anatolia College, located in Merzifon outside Amasya. In 1921, Turkish troops closed down the school, and the local population relocated to Thessaloniki after the population exchange between Greece and Turkey. Also, in 1921 there was the Amasya trials which were special ad hoc trials, organized by the Turkish National Movement, with the purpose to kill the Greek representatives of Pontus region under a legal pretext.

== Ecclesiastical history ==
Amasea became the seat of a Christian metropolitan bishop in the Eastern Roman Empire, in particular from the 3rd century AD. As capital of the Late Roman province of Helenopontus, it also became its Metropolitan Archbishopric and included the suffragans of Amisus, Andrapa, Euchaitae, Ibora, Sinope, Zaliche and Zela. In the 10th century the metropolis ranked 11th among the metropolises of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. From the 12th century the Christian element was reduced due to the Turkic migrations into Anatolia. The Orthodox metropolis of Amasea was active until the Population exchange between Greece and Turkey (1923) and in 1922 counted c. 40,000 Christians, 20,000 of them being Greek speakers. Last active metropolitan bishop was Germanos Karavangelis.

== The legend of Ferhat and Shirin ==
In its Turkish version, this classic tale of oriental folklore is held to have taken place in Amasya. The nearby mountain &quot;Ferhat&quot; is named for Farhad (Turkish spelling Ferhat), the hero of the legend, who for love of the princess Shirin (Turkish spelling Şirin) tried to win her father&#x27;s favour and permission by tunnelling through the mountain to bring spring water to his palace. Sadly, while he was working he was sent the false information that Shirin had died; upon which he threw himself onto the rocks in his grief. And his beloved princess died soon after. The story has since become a play by Nâzım Hikmet, a novel by Talip Apaydın, and an opera by Arif Melikov.

== Geography ==
Situated between the Black Sea and inner Anatolia in a region of fertile plains irrigated by the Tersakan, Çekerek and Yeşilırmak rivers, Amasya lies in a beautiful narrow river valley, bounded by almost vertical cliffs and the high peaks of the Canik and Pontus mountains. Despite the mountainous location, it is not far above sea level. This makes its climate more temperate.

Five bridges cross the river, and most of the town lies on the southern bank, spread along the river. The climb up to the higher ground is very steep, making the valley walls virtually uninhabitable. The town is shaped like the letter &#x27;v&#x27; as it follows a sharp bend in the river.

<doc id="1325628" wikidata="Q306528" url="?curid=1325628" title="Austrian folk dance">
<text>Austrian folk dancing is mostly associated with Schuhplattler, Ländler, polka and waltz. However, there are other dances such as Zwiefacher, &quot;Kontratänze&quot; and &quot;Sprachinseltänze&quot;.

==Types of dance==

In Austria, folk dances in general are known as &quot;Folkloretänze&quot;, i.e. &quot;folklore dances&quot;, whereas the Austrian type of folk dance is known as &quot;Volkstanz&quot; (literally &quot;folk dance&quot;).

Figure dancing is a type of dance where different figures are put together with a certain tune and given a name. Round dancing, which includes the waltz, the polka, Zwiefacher etc., involves basic steps which can be danced to different tunes. In folk dancing, the waltz and the polka are in a different form to standard ballroom dancing.

&quot;Sprachinseltänze&quot; (literally &quot;language island dances&quot;) are those dances which are actually by German-speaking minorities (see German as a Minority Language) living outside Austria, but which originate in Austria, e.g. those of Transylvania. One example of this type of dance is the &quot;Rediwaire&quot;.

==Misconceptions==
There are some misconceptions about Austrian folk tradition:
*The &quot;Ländler&quot;, as performed in the film &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, is &quot;not&quot; a traditional Ländler, but a choreographed derivative of this Austrian form of folk dance.
*The &quot;Chicken Dance&quot; is &quot;not&quot; an Austrian folk dance, nor is it from Austria.
*The song &quot;Edelweiss&quot; is &quot;not&quot; an Austrian folk song, and it is &quot;not&quot; the national anthem of Austria. The national anthem of Austria is &quot;Land der Berge, Land am Strome&quot;. &quot;Edelweiss&quot; was created specifically for &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;.

==Festivals==
Austrian folk dance festivals follow a common sequence: 
*everybody gets onto the dance floor and dances the opening round
*a welcoming speech is made
*waltzes are danced in blocks, with breaks in between.
*finally a special dance, often with a goodbye song.

Viennese festivals usually have four long sets of dances, with long breaks and figure dancing in between. Other parts of Austria have a larger number of shorter blocks (three to five dances each) with shorter breaks between them, and more figure dancing.

Though attended only by a tradition-minded minority, Vienna folk dance events are carefully organized events often taking place at extraordinary locations, such as, the &quot;Alpenverein&quot;, the Autumn Dance at baroque Belvedere (palace), the Ländler dances (the traditional music of which bears the rhythm from which in the 19th century the Vienna waltz music was developed), and the summer dances which take place twice each week during summer holiday season (July and August).

==Musical instruments==
Typical instruments for Austrian folk dance are the Styrian harmonica (a type of accordion), the fiddle, the clarinet, the harp, the flute and brass bands. Dances are often accompanied by the contrabass or the guitar. Unlike modern Austrian folk-pop music, drums are not used.

<doc id="1325634" wikidata="Q533098" url="?curid=1325634" title="Katherine Woodville, Duchess of Buckingham">
<text>Katherine Woodville (also spelled Catherine Wydville, Wydeville, or Widvile) (c. 1458 – 18 May 1497) was the Duchess of Buckingham and a medieval English noblewoman.

==Early life==
Katherine was the daughter of Richard Woodville, 1st Earl Rivers, and Jacquetta of Luxembourg. When her sister Elizabeth married Edward IV of England, the King elevated and promoted many members of the Woodville family. Elizabeth Woodville&#x27;s household records for 1466/67 indicate that Katherine was being raised in the queen&#x27;s household.

==First marriage==
Sometime before the coronation of Elizabeth in May 1465, Katherine was married to Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham; both were still children. A contemporary description of Elizabeth Woodville&#x27;s coronation relates that Katherine and her husband were carried on squires&#x27; shoulders due to their youth. According to Dominic Mancini, Buckingham resented his marriage to a woman of inferior birth. However, the couple had four children:
* Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham (3 February 1478 – 17 May 1521)
* Elizabeth Stafford, Countess of Sussex ( – 11 May 1532)
* Henry Stafford, 1st Earl of Wiltshire ( – 6 April 1523)
* Anne Stafford, Countess of Huntingdon ( – 1544)

In 1483, Buckingham first allied himself to the Duke of Gloucester, helping him succeed to the throne as King Richard III, and then to Henry Tudor, leading an unsuccessful rebellion in his name. Buckingham was executed for treason on 2 November 1483.

==Second marriage==
After Richard III was defeated by Henry Tudor at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485, Katherine married the new king&#x27;s uncle Jasper Tudor on 7 November 1485.

==Third marriage==

After Jasper&#x27;s death in December 1495, Katherine married – not later than 24 February 1496 – Sir Richard Wingfield, who outlived her.

==Depiction in fiction==
Katherine is the main protagonist in Susan Higginbotham&#x27;s 2010 historical novel &quot;The Stolen Crown&quot;. She is briefly mentioned in Philippa Gregory&#x27;s historical novels &quot;The White Queen&quot; (2009), &quot;The Red Queen&quot; (2010), and &quot;The White Princess&quot; (2013).

<text>Samuel Menashe (September 16, 1925 – August 22, 2011) was an American poet.

==Biography==
Born in New York City as Samuel Menashe Weisberg, the son of Russian-Jewish immigrant parents, Menashe grew up in Elmhurst, Queens, and graduated from Townsend Harris High School and Queens College where he majored in biochemistry. During World War II he served in the US Army infantry, and in 1944 fought in the Battle of the Bulge. After the war, he used his GI Bill money to study at the Sorbonne where he received a Ph.D. for the thesis &quot;Un essai sur l&#x27;expérience poétique (étude introspective)&quot; in 1950.

In the 1950s, Menashe returned to New York where, except for frequent sojourns in England and Ireland, he lived most of his life. In 1961, he garnered the blessing of the British poet Kathleen Raine who arranged for his first book, &quot;The Many Named Beloved&quot;, to be published by Victor Gollancz in London. Menashe&#x27;s short, intense, spiritual poems, which canvass existential dilemmas and use implication and wordplay as a way of deepening the linguistic force of his words, gained wide renown in Britain from reviewers such as Donald Davie, who became one of Menashe&#x27;s most committed backers. He was later included in the Penguin Modern Poets series.

In 2004 he became the first poet honored with the &quot;Neglected Masters Award&quot; given by Poetry magazine and the Poetry Foundation. The award was also to include a book to be published by the Library of America, which turned out to be a &quot;Selected Poems&quot; edited by Ricks. This volume appeared in 2005 on the occasion of the poet&#x27;s 80th birthday, and was widely reviewed. A revised edition, with ten additional poems, was published in 2008. Bloodaxe Books in the UK published the volume (which also contained a DVD film about the poet&#x27;s life and work) in 2009.

Menashe was also a teacher and writing instructor. During the 1960s, he taught literature and poetry courses at C. W. Post College. Previously, he taught at Bard College.

Menashe died in his sleep in New York on August 22, 2011.

<text>Korwin is a Polish coat of arms. It was used by several szlachta families in the times of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and by the Russian Counts Korwin-Litwicki tracing their origin back to Empress Catherine the Great.

==History==




For some reason, an old Polish chivalry clan from Sarmatian breeding, chose raven as his symbol. Perhaps it was their totem symbol because those clans, then pagans, were more ancients than the christening of Poland and the rise of the Kingdom of Piast Dynasty.
Many centuries later, we know about it from a grant of privilege to Wawrzęta (or &quot;Wawrzyniec&quot; - Lawrence) Korwin z Ślepowrony from Duke Konrad I of Masovia, at Warsaw in 1224, according to Jan Długosz, Bartholomew Paprocki, Count Juliusz Ostrowski, etc. The authors understand the Korwin &quot;proper&quot; actual drawing came to Poland from Hungary, more or less two centuries later.

The so-called Roman-Hungarian legend of Korwin starts in the 16th century under the influence of Renaissance humanism culture and vivacious contacts between Polish nobility and Hungarian Royal Court. In that kingdom, the Wallachian-Hungarian family of Korvin had flourish in 1400, and a baroque legend argues them descending from one of the Roman &quot;gens&quot; Valerii. At one time there was in Rome a distinguished tribune named Marcus Valerius Corvus, a Roman general who got the agnomen Corvinus in the following manner: In 349BC, the Roman Army moved against the Barbarians, and before the battle began, a warrior of great size and strength came forward and challenged anyone in the Roman cavalry to single combat, whereupon Valerius stepped forward. Just as he was about to engage the barbarian, a raven flew from a trunk, perched upon Valerius&#x27;s helmet, and began to attack his foe&#x27;s eyes with its beak so fiercely that the warrior was blind. With this, the Roman beat him easily, and from that time, Valerius was called Corvinus (from &quot;Corvus&quot;, &quot;raven&quot;). His descendant, Marcus Valerius Messalla Corvinus (64BC – 8AD) was chosen to the Roman consulate with Caesar Augustus and the Baroque authors understand he became a big landowner in the Dacian-Panonnian frontiers. If however any of his supposed Hungarians descendants, and a Polish branch of this family carried on the name, nobody really knows...

It is true that Janos Hunyadi and his son Matthias Corvinus Hunyadi, King of Hungary and anti-king of Bohemia, called themselves &quot;Corvinus&quot; and had their coins minted displaying a “raven with a ring”. The epithet &quot;Corvinus&quot; was coined by Matthias&#x27; biographer, the Italian Antonio Bonfini, who claimed that the Hunyadi family descended from Marcus Valerius Corvinus.

The Hungarian legend relates that when a raven carried off the ring King Matthias had removed from his finger he chased the bird down and slew him retrieving the ring, and in commemoration of this event, he took the raven as a symbol for his signet sign. Really, this coat of arms was used by Matthias&#x27;s ancestors far earlier than he did. His own father John Hunyadi, voivode of Transylvania and regent of Hungary, is known as &quot;Ioannes Corvinus&quot; in Medieval Latin. In addition the Silesian Annals (other version of this legend) tell that was not the king himself who shot the raven but a Polish soldier, who was rewarded with the Korwin coat of arms. Matthias Corvinus was also ruler of the Duchy of Głogów, and as titular Bohemian king (and as conqueror most of territory of the Bohemian Crown), suzerain of all Silesian duchies.

Actually, Matthias Corvinus raised the Black Army which is recognized as the first standing continental European fighting force not under conscription and with regular pay since the Roman Empire. The soldiers of the Black Army were mainly Bohemian mercenaries (former Hussites), but Poles, Germans, Hungarians and adventurers from all over Europe joined as well. Sometimes officers were rewarded with lands and ennoblement. This may be a more realistic origin of the Korwin coat of arms, in Silesia at first (part of the Bohemian kingdom), and all around the Polish–Lithuanian commonwealth later. In time, baroque authors related the old Slepowron coat of arms with then more &quot;fashionable&quot; name Korwin.

Korwin coat of arms can be found on the tombstone of the Chancellor of Cracow Academy Łukasz Noskowski (also &quot;Łukasz of Noskowa&quot;; †1532), buried in St. Mary&#x27;s Basilica, Kraków. Image of a raven also appears on the city seal of Głogów from March 17, 1490. A raven sitting on a branch was the emblem of the Corvinus/Korwin family, which ruled in the Duchy of Głogów in the second half of the 15th century and gave their emblem to the city.

==Blazon==

Gules, on a cut off tree stump laid sideways proper, between two upper and two lower knots stands a left facing raven sable, in its beak, a ring or with the diamond facing down. In the crest, above a crowned helmet, there are three ostrich feathers.

&quot;Korwin I sometimes known as &quot;Ślepowron variation&quot; - In a red field, a black raven is facing left with a gold ring in its beak; it stands on a natural tree-stump, lying crosswise with two knots on top and two on the bottom. Over the helmet and the coronet are three ostrich feathers. It’s one of the oldest Polish coats of arms, but neither Długosz nor official records from the fifteenth century tell about it. writes this coat of arms is separated from the Ślepowron only in the first decades of the sixteenth century (at the beginning, only Paprocki treated these two heraldic emblems as separates). Proof this fact some families that later used Korwin coat of arms but in the fifteenth century were still considered to be in Ślepowron clan, (Kochanowski family, for example). The name Ślepowron referred to the emblem, and the battle cry or &quot;call&quot; was &quot;Bojno&quot; or Bujno, as it’s proved in official records. Korwin coat of arms, being a later emblem, had no call.&quot;

&quot;Korwin II – Reversing the figures is a common tool in Polish heraldry, which doesn’t follow the general principles of the Western heraldry; there is also an inverted Korwin facing right (instead of the usual drawing facing left). Niesiecki himself mentions it.&quot;

&quot;Korwin III – In a red field there is a black raven with a gold ring in its beak, over a cut stump lying across, between two knots on each side. Above the helmet and the coronet there is the same raven with a ring. There are similarities between the crest of this variation and the crest of Ślepowron coat of arms.&quot;

<text>Drakkhen is an early-3D role-playing video game, initially developed and published by Infogrames for the Amiga and Atari ST, and subsequently ported to several other platforms, including MS-DOS and Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It was a very early game in the North American SNES library, and as such, received almost universal coverage in previews of the then-upcoming SNES in gaming magazines of 1990 and early 1991.

&quot;Drakkhen&quot; was notable for being among the first role-playing games to feature a three-dimensional playing field and for being an early example of the real-time tactics genre. It did not employ a fully 3D game engine, instead implementing a hybrid approach using vectors and bitmapped character-scaling algorithms. &quot;Drakkhen&quot; features an animated day-night cycle, and the ability to wander freely about the game world, both rarities for a game of its era. The game spawned a sequel, &quot;Dragon View&quot;, for the SNES.

== Gameplay ==

A player may freely travel the entirety of &quot;Drakkhen&quot;&#x27;s game world not long after beginning a new game, although this can be unwise in practice. Chance encounters with hostile monsters are regular, but in contrast to other RPGs, the player may be attacked while stationary. All battles are automated by default but allow the player to micromanage their four combatants. The player is given time to focus on the real-time tactics of each enemy encounter, such as activating defense magic, moving around, or switching weapons on the fly. The player&#x27;s party may also be accosted at night when viewing constellations in the sky, or any time after bumping into a half-buried urn.

The player may attempt to flee from attackers or retaliate against foes who, when defeated, grants all party members experience points that go towards leveling up and improving character stats.
Each of the characters in the player&#x27;s party have health points, magic points for spellcasting, power, defense, physique, fortune, intelligence, knowledge, and agility; each stat has a direct effect on how a character plays. Character stats are assigned by the player at the start of the game using a cap-and-trade system. Each party member fills one of the four roles: scout, wizard, fighter, and priest, each with different strengths and abilities. Items can be purchased from traveling merchants who ambush the party, or at the tavern. Items are categorized as armor, weapons, healing items, rings, and misc. (such as torches).

Past castles can be revisited at any time, which themselves act like Temples found in &quot;Legend of Zelda&quot; games. Castles are self-contained levels with obstacles, loot, enemies, and maze-like architecture; and they each must be visited at least once.

Drakkhen&#x27;s gameplay is colored by its early-game brutality and surreal enemy encounters, the former especially in the SNES version. One special enemy is relegated solely to appearing when the player kicks one of the many urns in the ground. Upon doing so, a black, stationary canine head rises from beneath the floor to shoot bolts from its eyes. These encounters are quickly fatal to new players who don&#x27;t know any better. They offer no experience points, suggesting that kicking an urn is frowned upon. Another difficult enemy is the &quot;Shadow Man&quot;, a tall figure that can unexpectedly lift itself out of the ground, accompanied by an ominous tune. Each enemy has movement and attack differences, some being less subtle than others, such as enemies that zigzag sporadically at a much greater speed than the player&#x27;s party can keep up with. The game contains over one hundred different enemy variants.

=== Differences between computer and SNES game ===
The SNES version of Drakkhen is drastically different to its PC predecessor, especially in visual layout and color scheme.

Predating both &quot;Ultima Underworld&quot; (1992) and &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; (1991), &quot;Drakkhen&quot; was among the first action RPGs to utilize a permanent, real-time, text-adventure log window, demonstrating large influence from MUD games. This log functions like a dungeon master, frequently telling the player how much damage an attack did, explaining the outcome of intended actions, acting as the player&#x27;s five senses, et cetera. This feature was de-emphasized and presented more elegantly for the SNES. The computer versions made heavier use of the adventure game buttons within castles to solve deeper and more plentiful obstacles. The originals were criticized for lacking a compass, which the SNES developers took to heart when they made changes to the new version. The SNES doesn&#x27;t use a visual compass but instead tells the player which of the 360-degrees he or she faces anytime the game is paused. The computer versions allow for greater nuance when traveling the 3D island, playing to the strength of utilizing a mouse cursor, while the SNES version uses the directional pad. As such, maneuvering around scenery is clunkier.

The short story collection that came with the game, aside from expanding the story of the game itself, also incorporated clues as to what the player needed to do, what enemies would be difficult, and other such context that the player was expected to know before playing. The SNES re-release of &quot;Drakkhen&quot; didn&#x27;t come with this supplemental book that was written by Gary Gygax, who had a hand in designing the gameplay and story of the original, as well as many enemies. This exclusion was likely because the game story was entirely rewritten, which nevertheless rendered the SNES version without the context necessary to experience the game the way the developers intended. With one or more party members dead at any point in the game, the player is at a crippling disadvantage and is incentivized to go on a pilgrimage to the nearest Anak holy temple to revive their dead. In general, the SNES version has fewer NPCs that can be approached.

Fleeing any battle in the SNES version is as simple as tapping the L and R bumpers, which makes all battles outside castles entirely optional, as this doesn&#x27;t give enemies the opportunity to attack. The interface was changed to utilize visual means to more quickly communicate ideas, and the clutter originally covering the left half of the screen was condensed into the bottom. In the original two versions, crossing the borders between continental divisions would require a wait while the game loaded. In the SNES version, crossings are instantaneous; however, if the player attempts to cross between areas before the first few story beats, they are sharply rebuked.

== Background ==
The setting of &quot;Drakkhen&quot; is a large rectangular island, divided laterally into four smaller regions. Each region has its own terrain and climate and is ruled by two members of the Drakkhen caste, with each of them living in their own castle. The continent is bounded on all sides by a vast ocean; walking into this, or any other body of water, will result in the speedy drowning of all party members.

Much of the game is spent traveling between castles, carrying out various political missions at the behest of the ruling Drakkhen elite. A player may also wander around without having a particular goal or destination, perhaps in the spirit of adventure, or exploration, or to fight wildlife, monsters, and strange supernatural entities, who may yield loot if they are defeated. Serious setbacks can easily occur through the death of one or more party members in combat, and bringing them back to life will often involve difficult and arduous travel in order to reach an Anak, where healing and resurrection are performed pro bono. If all four characters succumb to injury or drowning, the player will be informed of the dire consequences for the game world, before being returned to the title screen.

==Storyline==
The story differs depending on which version is being played.

=== The original versions ===
Long ago, the magic of &quot;the world&quot; faded away with the slaying of the final dragon by a selfish paladin all the while a plague is decimating humanity. Long after, a caravel ship of foreign countrymen shipwrecked on the island where the final dragon died, only to be attacked and sunk by a foe unknown and unseen from their perspective. These foes revealed themselves to be lizard-people, thought to be the evolved survivors of the ancient dragons and the dominant people of the island. Four survivors made it ashore and vowed to stick together. They soon discovered that to take back the island in the name of humanity and to end the curse, they will need to pillage the nine gem tears and use them to summon the dragon god. To their surprise, certain princes and princess of the Drakkhen clan offer their support—even their life—for the party, believing that their kind was never meant for Earth. As such, the four heroes get caught up in an ongoing war between those acting for the survival of their own kind, and those who see themselves as abominations.

An included short story book expands the backstory.

=== SNES alternate storyline ===
The storyline for the SNES game is the result of a broken translation and rewrite of the original, as well as lack of supplemental stories. Drakkhen was developed by a French team, which was then translated into Japanese for the Super Famicom, which was then translated to English and further rewritten with help from the original French developers. To exemplify the telephone effect of all this, the original game contained a French translation of an Emily Dickinson as quoted by a mysterious wizard, and that French translation of an English poem was then translated further into Japanese for the Super Famicom version, and then translated again back into English from Japanese. The version of the Dickinson poem that survived into the SNES version of the game is almost unrecognizable and difficult to comprehend.

According to the SNES game, a subset of humans known as the Drakkonian people are presently doomed, for the dragon gods of the four elements judged them as unworthy and are soon to put an end to their survival. Each god has a son and daughter dragon prince and princess who rule the island of Drakkhen. Drakkhen, himself, is a 5th dragon god, one who the other four stole eight of the nine, magic, blue artifacts (the Nine Tears) from, to do their cruel bidding upon the Drakkonian people. Four warriors stepped up to the challenge of proving their worth as a people to Drakkhen. Their agreement is that if they can recover his eight Tears, their people will be spared, and the four Gods, their offspring, and their offspring&#x27;s lizard-people armies will all perish instead. Like in the other version of the story, some sons and daughters of the Gods agree to help the player even if it means they suffer extinction for doing so, demonstrating a deep selflessness.

=== Continental divisions ===
; Arctic Wasteland:Domain of the Prince and Princess of Air, both of whom live in large glacier-shaped castles.
; Swampland (dark green):Domain of the Prince and Princess of Water, the former living in a large castle and the latter in what resembles a pagoda. This area has the greatest number of rivers and lakes.
; Grassland (light green):Domain of the Prince and Princess of Earth, who live in identical-looking castles. This is where the adventure begins. In the centre is a glowing boundary that is heavily guarded.
; Desert: Domain of the Prince and Princess of Fire, the former living in what resembles an Aztec pyramid and the latter in a large Taj Mahal or mosque-like building (incorrectly called a &quot;minaret&quot;).

== Music and audio ==
&quot;Drakkhen&quot; is known for its unusual sound effects; in lieu of speech, monsters and NPCs make noises that resemble belching, chittering, or inarticulate rumbling. Early releases made only limited use of music during gameplay, but the game&#x27;s soundtrack was expanded for the SNES version.

The SNES version of the game censors the screams of the &quot;Love Monster.&quot; In the original, a shadow shaped like a frantic, giant woman repeatedly shouts &quot;I love you&quot; in a chorus of demonic voices, but in the SNES version, she instead moans not unlike how other enemies do. This may be related to Nintendo wanting to keep their reputation as a family-friendly operation without any traces of sensuality.

== Development and ports ==
&quot;Drakkhen&quot; was originally released in 1989 by Infogrames two years after being presented at gaming expos. It was translated for North American release in 1990 by Draconian, a label from Data East. By the time review copies of the original were given to the press, Infogrames claimed to have no &quot;immediate&quot; intention of porting the game. The many subsequent computer ports were unannounced until the DOS port was about to be released in late 1989. In 1991, &quot;Drakkhen&quot; was ported to the Super Nintendo by Kemco-Seika, who made several revisions to the game, mostly by necessity.

In February 2018, the DOS version of the game was made available on Steam and in June 2018 on GOG.com. It was published under Piko Interactive&#x27;s Classics Digital brand. It was also released for Evercade, included in &quot;Piko Interactive Collection 1&quot; cartridge.

== Reception ==

&quot;Drakkhen&quot; was a commercial success, with sales of more than 350,000 units.

In the May 1990 edition of &quot;Games International&quot;, Mike Siggins noted the new-at-the-time open sandbox design, where players could wander in any direction, seeking adventure. However, Siggins was peeved by &quot;the regular use of problems and puzzles to impede progress.&quot; He liked the &quot;well-done&quot; documentation, and admired the graphics. He concluded by giving the game an average score of 7 out of 10, although he gave the graphics an excellent rating of 9 out of 10, saying, &quot;These games are really fantasy wargames rather than true role-playing exercises but &quot;Drakkhen&quot; at least pushes the standard out a little further and makes for a tough game with plenty of scope, graced with those remarkable Infogrames graphics.&quot;

In the August 1990 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue #160), Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser admired the Amiga versions&#x27;s &quot;amazing graphics, enthralling music, and incredible game environment&quot;, but admitted that it was &quot;one of the toughest fantasy adventure games for a novice to survive that we&#x27;ve yet encountered.&quot; They gave the game an excellent rating of 4½ out of 5, saying, &quot;If you are easily put off by frustration, avoid this adventure. But if a challenge is your desire, and if superb animation and plot are what you want, &quot;Drakkhen&quot; is for you [...] &quot;Drakkhen&quot; offers a high dollar-to-entertainment ratio and provides gamers with a chance to experience gaming originality, new programming techniques, and superb sound and music enhancements.&quot;

Editor Paul Rand of &quot;Computer and Video Game Magazine&quot; gave the original versions 83 out of 100, praising the music and graphics, but finding the value of the game to be lukewarm. He was also impressed by the imaginative creatures and the sense of terror some enemies caused him.

&quot;Nintendo Power&quot; gave the SNES version a mixed, aggregate score of 3.1 out of 5 stars. Super Gamer reviewed the SNES Version and gave an overall score of 84% writing: &quot;The perspective is unusual for an RPG; a fast-scrolling 3-D landscape heavily populated with well-drawn monsters. Imaginative and unusual this is a decent introduction to RPGs.&quot; Retrospective reception of the SNES version has been very mixed, with many YouTubers and bloggers calling it confusing and &quot;unplayable&quot; by modern standards, while others find it appealing for its experimental nature; openness-to-interpretation, unintentionally-cryptic story; and intense absurdities.

Jim Trunzo reviewed &quot;Drakkhen&quot; in &quot;White Wolf&quot; #24 (Dec./Jan., 1990), rating it a 4 out of 5 and stated that &quot;Data East has given much thought and preparation to &quot;Drakkhen&quot; and it shows. In spite of the game&#x27;s difficulty and the frustration that can result from it, &quot;Drakkhen&quot; boasts such excellent graphics and arresting game play that one is willing to invest the time learning the nuances that lead to success.&quot;

<doc id="1325659" wikidata="Q7330041" url="?curid=1325659" title="Richard Wingfield">
<text>Sir Richard Wingfield of Kimbolton Castle (c. 1469 – 22 July 1525) was an influential courtier and diplomat in the early years of the Tudor dynasty of England.

==Life==
He was born at Letheringham, Suffolk to Sir John Wingfield (c. 1428 – 10 May 1481) and his wife Elizabeth FitzLewis (c. 1431–1497) who was born in West Horndon, Essex, to John FitzLewis and Anne Montague. He was the eleventh of twelve sons; and brother to Humphrey Wingfield. His paternal grandparents were Sir Robert Wingfield and Elizabeth Gousell. He was one of the major landowners in Huntingdonshire and lived at Kimbolton Castle.

Wingfield became a courtier during the reign of Henry VII of England. He married Katherine Woodville sometime after 1495. She was daughter to Richard Woodville, 1st Earl Rivers and Jacquetta of Luxembourg, sister to Elizabeth Woodville, sister-in-law to Edward IV of England and widow of both Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham, and Jasper Tudor, 1st Duke of Bedford. The marriage made him an uncle-by-marriage to Queen consort Elizabeth of York and her husband Henry VII.

He was made Lord Deputy of Calais in 1511. With Sir Edward Poynings and others he was sent in 1512 to arrange a Holy League between Pope Julius II, the English king and other European sovereigns.

In 1507 Wingfield was sent to the Netherlands in order to attempt the arrangement of a marriage between Archduke Charles of Austria and Princess Mary Tudor of England, to secure a dynastic alliance between the Tudors and the rising Habsburgs. Mary was betrothed to Charles in 1507 but it was called off several years later in 1514 due to the stalling of the Hapsburgs because of Charles&#x27;s weak health. Mary was instead married to Louis XII of France the same year. Wingfield was also occupied in discharging his duties at Calais, but in 1519 he resigned his post there and returned to England.

In 1520, Wingfield was appointed English ambassador to France (to the court of Francis I of France). He is known to have helped to arrange the meeting between Henry VIII of England and Francis at the Field of the Cloth of Gold. He twice visited Emperor Charles V in 1521 in an effort to convince him against declaring war on Francis I.

Henry VIII created him a Knight of the Garter in 1522. The future Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor was the only other Knight created during that year. Wingfield was made Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster in 1524. For his services Wingfield was granted lands throughout the Kingdom of England, notably Kimbolton Castle which was further expanded by him.

In 1525, Wingfield was sent by Henry VIII on a mission to the Spanish court at Toledo. He died there on 22 July 1525 and was buried at the church of San Juan de los Reyes. His widow was later married first to Sir Nicholas Harvey of Ickworth and secondly to Sir Robert Tyrwhitt of Kettleby.

==Family==
Wingfield married Katherine, née Woodville, shortly after the 1495 death of her second husband, Jasper Tudor; she was a sister of Queen Elizabeth Woodville. Katherine died in 1497, and Wingfield was a widower for some time. He married in about 1513, his second wife, Bridget Wiltshire, daughter and heiress of Sir John Wiltshire of Stone Castle and Isabella Clothall. They were parents to ten children:

*Charles Wingfield of Kimbolton Castle (1513 – 24 May 1540). He married Joan Knollys, a sister to Sir Francis Knollys and sister-in-law to Lady Catherine Carey.
*Thomas Maria Wingfield of Stonely Priory, Huntingdonshire. A Member of Parliament. He first married Margaret, widow of naval captain William Sabyn, and secondly Margaret Kerrye. The unusual middle name of Maria was due to he fact he was named after both his godparents, Thomas after Thomas Wolsey whom the Wingfields were related to and Maria after Mary Tudor, Queen of France a relative of his father through his marriage to her great-aunt and also through her marriage to Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk who was related to the Wingfield family via his grandmother, Elizabeth Wingfield.
*Jacques Wingfield of Stone Castle (c. 1519–1587?). A politician first known for long-term service to Stephen Gardiner, Bishop of Winchester.
*Lawrence Henry Wingfield.
*Jane Wingfield. Married first Thomas Worlich of Alconbury and secondly Francis Roe.
*Mary Wingfield.
*Margaret Wingfield. She married first Sir Thomas Newman and secondly a son of the Moyle family.
*Anne Wingfield. She married into the Maidenhead family.
*Elizabeth Wingfield. She married into the Latimer family.
*Catherine Wingfield.

<text>Aralvaimozhi is a panchayat town in Kanniyakumari District in the state of Tamil Nadu, India. It is a small town situated in southern India. The town was earlier called as &quot;Aramboly&quot; during the colonial period.

==History==
Aralvaimozhi pass was a strategically important gap or mountain pass in the southernmost end of Western Ghats. It connected erstwhile Travancore with Madras Presidency. Many of the invasions faced by the Chera and the successor kingdoms came via this ghat.

The name &quot;Aral&quot; was derived from the fort built and maintained by the rulers of Venad and later by the kingdom of Travancore to defend the kingdom from invasions from the east regions. It is also said that Aralvaimozhi means whispering wind. The whistling sound of wind in the region might have led to such a name.

Aralvaimozhi Fort was one of the most important forts of Travancore. It was constructed around 1740 by Eustachius De Lannoy along with Udayagiri Fort, Vattakottai Fort and Travancore lines. The fort was captured by the English East India Company in 1809 from the soldiers loyal to Velu Thampi Dalawa. The remains of the fort can be seen near railway station, but neglected by both railway and archeology departments.

== Demographics ==
According to the 2011 census, Aralvaimozhi had an estimated population of 22,846, of which 11,373 were males and 11,473 were females, meaning a female-male ratio of 1.01, above the Tamil Nadu state average of 0.996 and well above the national average of 0.929 females/male. The child sex ratio of Aralvaimozhi is 1.012, higher than the state average of 9.43. Aralvaimozhi has a literacy rate of 89.26%. In Aralvaimozhi, Male literacy is around 92.34% while female literacy rate is 86.20%.

==Culture==
During the invasion of Sultan Alauddin Khilji of Delhi in 1311 AD by Malik Kapoor, Meenakshi Amman and Sundareeswarar were brought from Madurai to Venadu and hid in Parakodi Kandan Shasta temple near Aralvaaimozhi. Until 1368, Meenakshi Amman remained in Aralvaimozhi. From there she was taken back to Madurai.

&quot;Some details about the Turkish Embassy Radio system :&quot;

The transmitter was the old driver CTD 500 with SSA 400 or SSA 1000. Receiver was the CR 300, two of them in the cabinet. The intention was to use space diversity. No place for two &quot;real&quot; Antennas, the second receiver got an active antenna AA300. Each receiver had a FSK demodulator, CRFD 1000.

The main use  for the second receiver became a broadcast receiver. The system used FEC, equipment from Siemens, FEC 100. It could handle a total loss of signal for 1,5 second.

Antennas used was a logper from Granger, 6- 30 MHz. This Antenna used wires instead of solid elements. Some stations got an ATU 1000 with a 10m whip.

The teleprinter came from SAGEM, similar to Siemens T100.

Some 30-40 embassies was installed, from Washington in the West to Beijing in the East. The main station in Ankara had 12 Transmitters, remote controlled. some 400W some 1000 W. Remote control was via &quot; Voice Frequency Telegraph&quot; VFT system made by SRT.

Before SRT got the order a test system was set up between Berne and Ankara, everything worked fine and MOFA in Ankara signed the order.

<text>Hersham is a suburban village in Surrey, within the M25 and the Greater London Built-up Area. It has a mixture of low and high rise housing and has four technology/trading estates. Hersham is contiguous with Walton-on-Thames, its post town, to the north and northwest, and with Esher to the east.

Hersham is served by Hersham and Walton-on-Thames railway stations with a minimum of two trains per hour and differing types of services on the South West Main Line.

Two golf courses are within its bounds, Burhill Golf Club and Hersham Village Golf Club; considerable other land is wooded, used for mixed farming or Esher Rugby Club, much of which is Metropolitan Green Belt.

==History==
According to &quot;Hersham in Surrey&quot;:

That this could have been constructed at all indicates a fairly large population in the district, a chieftain of some sort, organised labour and a desperate perhaps recurring danger. Bronze and Iron Age burials have been found on the slopes of the hill which was clearly a feature of some importance in ancient times.

The Anglo-Saxons may well have been the first permanent settlers here; they gave the name to the place and no older remains of actual dwellings in areas not mentioned above have been found. In the 12th century it was written Haverichesham suggesting Haeferick&#x27;s hamlet or river bend settlement. By contraction the name become Haverisham, Haversham, Harsham or Hersham before finally settling only on the latter.

Hersham&#x27;s first chapel of ease (Holy Trinity church, which was demolished in 1889 having been superseded) was built of yellow brick in Anglo-Norman style in 1839. Similarly congregationalists had a Round Chapel which existed from 1844 until 1961, the year in which the single dual carriageway in Hersham was created, and enabling its construction.

Instead of merely (for vestry and property owning matters such as poor relief, road maintenance, manorial ownership, land tax and tithes) being the southern hamlet of Walton, Hersham became an ecclesiastical parish in 1851. The dividing line was what then officially termed the &quot;London and South Western Railway line&quot; and all borders remain almost unchanged by later local government and ecclesiastical parish decisions. The present Anglican church of St. Peter was built by Mr. J. L. Pearson, R.A., in 1887 on a site was given by Lieut. Col. Terry of Burvale, Hersham. It is of brick and stone in 13th-century style, has a nave and aisles, five arcades, chancel, transepts, and a western tower and spire.

Hersham has an interesting industrial history with notable companies such as ABC Motors, Air Products, Faulkners, Hackbridge &amp; Hewittick and Vickers-Armstrongs all having factories in the village during the last century. In 1929 an aeroplane designed by Anthony Fletcher was constructed in the village by ABC Motors. Designed by Anthony Fletcher and fitted with an ABC Scorpion aero engine, this was test flown from nearby Brooklands and had could have been built in quantity but became a victim of the economic depression of 1929-32. Other specialist Hersham firms include coachbuilders Compton &amp; Herman Ltd based in Molesey Road in the 1920s before being renamed Compton Motor Body Builders and later moving first to Kingston and then to New Malden.

In World War II, in a daring daylight raid on 4 September 1940, German bombers successfully attacked the important Vickers aircraft factory at Brooklands killing nearly 90 people. Four of the victims were never identified but buried in Hersham&#x27;s Burvale Cemetery and another Vickers worker, 36 year old William E Hunt, was buried close by. Luftwaffe bombers also dropped various bombs on and around Hersham and six V-1 flying bombs exploded in the parish. Besides the significant contribution of ABC Motors to the British war effort with products that included auxiliary power units for Short Sunderland flying boats), Vickers-Armstrongs had four secret production sites in the village and its surrounding parish occupied the existing Ben Stanley Ltd bus depot and workshop in Burwood Road as part of its dispersed Tinsmiths Department. Known as depot &#x27;W15&#x27;, this site supplied essential sheet metal parts for Vickers Wellington and Vickers Warwick aircraft manufactured at Brooklands. The other locations were at Burhill Golf Club (&#x27;W32&#x27;- see below) plus Corbie Wood (&#x27;W86&#x27; which included both a Bellman hangar and an Air Ministry T.2 Type hangar) and Riseholme (&#x27;W63&#x27;), both located on the St George&#x27;s Hill side of Seven Hills Road.

;Moor Hall, Syklesmore or Southwood Manor
Hersham contained one manor alone known as Morehall alias Sylkesmore or Southwood. Mention of a court held at Hersham in 1272 by Reginald de Imworth and Matilda his wife, may indicate that he was then lord of the manor. When Henry VIII built Nonsuch Palace in Cheam as many as eighty loads of timber were obtained from Southwood, or the South Woods, for it. In 1540 he purchased from John Carleton the &quot;manor of Morehall or Sylkesmore&quot; in Hersham, together with lands and woods in Burwood and Hatch in Hersham. The manor remained in the possession of the Crown, and was granted by Philip II of Spain and Mary I of England to David Vincent. In 1579 Queen Elizabeth granted to Thomas Vincent &quot;the manor, site, and demesne lands of Morehall, and the wood called Sylkesmore coppice&quot;. In the 18th century and until 1802 at least, the estate, then known as &#x27;the manor of Southwood and Silksmore,&#x27; appears to have been held by the Frederick family.

;Whiteley Village

This private retirement village, which allocates some of its accommodation to disabled poor residents, is set in a lightly undulating, elevated, wooded part of Hersham and was created from a bequest of £1m left by a London department store pioneer William Whiteley.

==Geography==

Hersham is in the borough of Elmbridge, in northwest Surrey and has no particular sub-localities except for Burwood Park, which alongside certain other addresses in the village is, when published for any purposes, due to its proximity to Walton-on-Thames railway station, done so under the name of Hersham&#x27;s post town only, Walton on Thames. A planned community also exists in the south almost entirely for the retired, Whiteley Village.

In the nucleus of the village is Hersham Green, of open space on which regular events take place throughout the year. Just across from the green is a shopping centre, consisting of multiple shops and restaurants. Within a few minutes walk of the village centre in the east are green fields and meadows alongside the River Mole and footpaths both through and by fields used for mixed farming.

The parish boundaries run from the South West Main Line railway in the North to the East and through St George&#x27;s Hill in the West.
Places within Hersham therefore technically include part of Saint George&#x27;s Hill, all of Burwood Park and Whiteley Village.

==Notable events==
King George III visited Weylands farm in Hersham where he saw the first drill plough. Queen Victoria wrote in her diary how she saw her first steam train in Hersham when she was a young girl.

In more recent times the punk group Sham 69 with lead singer Jimmy Pursey, had its roots in Hersham. The band&#x27;s biggest hit was &quot;Hersham Boys&quot;. Sham 69 took their name from the remnants of a piece of graffiti in the area which made reference to when Walton and Hersham Football Club secured the Athenian League title in 1969.

Due to its proximity to London and Shepperton Studios, Hersham is frequently a filming location for film and television productions including &quot;Nighty Night&quot;, &quot;The Glass&quot;, and &quot;Monty Python&quot; The second series of the TV show, &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot; was filmed in Hersham. &quot;The Mummy&quot; was filmed in Hersham. The TV Show &quot;Not Going Out is filmed in Hersham as was Never the Twain and several TV and Film advertisements

Hersham is also home to Britain&#x27;s largest colony of parakeets near Esher Rugby Club. This was estimated in 2004 to have consisted of around 7,000 birds.

==Education==
Within Hersham is the mixed, secondary Three Rivers Academy. The school holds specialist Business and Enterprise College status, and boasts an impressive drama programme. Its roll holds approx. 1200 students. Hersham also has three primary schools – Burhill, became primary in 2015, Bell Farm, became primary in 2014 and Cardinal Newman.

==Sport==

===Rugby===
Esher RFC is a multi-pitch rugby union club in Hersham since approximately 1939 (see notes). Their first men&#x27;s team is notable in the region and saw 2012-14 among the upper 50% of clubs in RFU National League 1 (the third level of the sport in England), having been relegated in the previous season. Esher play at The Rugby Ground, 369 Molesey Road. The 1st XV play in a black-amber strip.

TV presenter John Inverdale has long been associated with the club, albeit the 2010s saw his involvement diminish.

===Golf===
Hersham Village Golf Club is on the south side of the village; snooker player John Virgo is a former president.

Hersham&#x27;s large second golf club is Burhill Golf Club (with North and South courses, the latter of which has been added near Burwood Park. Early in World War II, Barnes Wallis and several hundred staff were evacuated to Burhill Golf Club from the nearby Vickers-Armstrongs aircraft factory at Brooklands and designed the legendary Dambusters &#x27;bouncing bomb&#x27; there.

==Economy==
Four technology/trading estates exist in Hersham:
*Hersham Place Business Park
*Hersham Trading Estate
*Riverdene Industrial Estate
*Hersham Green Technology Park
A major nearby conjoined set of trading estates spans the Weybridge/Byfleet border at Brooklands and Heathrow Airport also has a range of employers, though this is across Walton-on-Thames itself and the borough of Spelthorne. Most important to the local economy is the accessibility of Central London – see Rail below, with more than 500,000 train entries and exits per annum recorded across the two stations bordering and in the village itself.

The very modest High Street contains almost entirely only convenience and socialising stores; fashion and leisure shops are to be found less than to the north, in Walton on Thames. As part of the development of Hersham a new shopping centre was built in the early 1980s with a large supermarket (30k sq feet ).

==Transport==

===Rail===
Hersham is served by Hersham and Walton-on-Thames railway stations with a minimum of two trains per hour even on Sundays and differing types of services on the South West Main Line. Fast trains stopping at Walton-on-Thames reach London Waterloo within 30 minutes.

===Roads===
The M25 Junction 10 is 4 miles away and an A-roads and dual carriageway connect neighbouring (but not contiguous) Esher and the almost bordering towns of Weybridge and Cobham, across a narrow strip of Walton on Thames.

==Demography and housing==

The average level of accommodation in the region composed of detached houses was 28%, the average that was apartments was 22.6%.
The proportion of households in the settlement who owned their home outright compares to the regional average of 35.1%. The proportion who owned their home with a loan compares to the regional average of 32.5%. The remaining % is made up of rented dwellings (plus a negligible % of households living rent-free).

<doc id="1325686" wikidata="Q1502213" url="?curid=1325686" title="Genidentity">
<text>As introduced by Kurt Lewin, genidentity is an &quot;existential relationship&quot; underlying the genesis of an object from one moment to the next. What we usually consider to be an object really consists of multiple entities, which are the phases of the object at various times. Two objects are not identical because they have the same properties in common, but because one has developed from the other. 
Lewin introduced the concept in his 1922 Habilitationsschrift &quot;Der Begriff der Genese in Physik, Biologie und Entwicklungsgeschichte&quot;. It is today perhaps the only surviving evidence of Lewin&#x27;s influence on the philosophy of science. However, this concept never became an object of widespread discussion and debate in its own terms. Rather, it was extracted from its context by philosophers such as Rudolf Carnap, Hans Hermes, Hans Reichenbach, Adolph Grünbaum, and Bas van Fraassen who incorporated this concept into their own theories such as the topology of the universe or the axiomatization of mechanics. Lewin&#x27;s idea was to compare and contrast the concept of genidentity in various branches of science, thereby laying bare the characteristic structure of each and making their classification possible in the first place. 

== Classification of Natural Sciences ==

In his thesis mentioned above, Lewin compares physics (in which he includes chemistry) and biology (which he divides into organic biology and evolutionary history of life). A comparison of this kind presupposes that it is possible to find equivalent notions in both sciences. According to Lewin, the concept of &quot;genidentity&quot; in the various sciences meets this requirement.

Lewin distinguishes between partial and total genidentity. This is due to the difficulty caused by parts of objects: for instance, an object might disintegrate into several pieces in the course of its development. As we follow such an object through time, only a small portion of it may remain. Lewin says that two objects existing at different times are partly genidentical if at least some part of the later object was present in the earlier object. By contrast, he says that two objects are totally genidentical if and only if at neither of the considered times there is any distinct object partially genidentical to one of the two objects concerned. 

Lewin also introduces the idea of viewing physical bodies as links in a so-called &quot;development chain&quot;. According to this approach, between two totally genidentical objects there always exists, at any intermediate time, an object totally genidentical with each. Thus genidentity implies the existence of an entire infinite series of intermediate objects. In this Lewin sees an analogy between physical objects and real numbers, as defined by so-called Dedekind cuts in the ordering of rational numbers. 

Genidentity so defined is postulated to have various characteristics, such as symmetry, transitivity, density, and continuity. When reviewed in the light of contemporary standards of logical precision, it becomes clear that Lewin had the correct intuition, even though he did not have the benefit of a highly developed terminology of definition theory or modern day symbolic logic. 

However, genidentity has never been explicitly discussed in the experimental sciences. Rather, it has always been a basic assumption hovering in the background, tacitly assumed. The credit for having made these assumptions explicit for the first time doubtlessly belongs to Kurt Lewin, usually renowned for his psychological work in the field of Gestalt psychology.

<text>The National Anthem of the Kyrgyz Republic was adopted on 18 December 1992 by a resolution of the Supreme Council of Kyrgyzstan. The music was composed by and , and the words were written by and .

Initially, the anthem consisted of three verses and a chorus; however, by the resolution of the Supreme Council of the Kyrgyz Republic N 2648-V of 27 December 2012, the second verse was excluded.

== History ==

Written by Jalil Sadykov and Shabdanbek Kuluyev and composed by Nasyr Davlesov and Kalyi Moldobasanov, the anthem was adopted on 18 December 1992 by a resolution of the Supreme Council.

In the 2000s, several public figures began initiatives to change the lyrics of the anthem. They considered the meaning of the word in the second stanza, (), to be contradictory, with the negative prefix giving the word () the opposite meaning. Thus, the following verse was ommitted:

In 2011, the Supreme Council set up a commission to change the lyrics of the national anthem and the flag, which had also been under dispute over the use of red and the flaming sun. The flag would not be changed, but after considering many proposals for changes to the lyrics or a new second verse, the commission, headed by Abdyrakhman Mamataliev, concluded to remove the verse entirely, stating there were generally contradictions in it. The Jogorku Kengesh voted in favour of the commission&#x27;s proposal on 27 December 2012 with resolution N 2648-V.

== Lyrics ==

== Protocol ==
When the anthem is being performed at official ceremonies and social functions, the protocol is to put the hands over their heart if one is a civilian, which follows the American example for the playing of &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;. When in formation, officers of the Armed Forces of Kyrgyzstan perform a Russian-style salute while enlisted personnel present arms with whatever weapon they might have in hand, outside of formation, all personnel salute.
